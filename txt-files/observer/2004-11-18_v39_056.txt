By CLAIRE HEININGER News Editor 
ller legacy lies ahead in the White House, but Condoleezza Rice's roots are at Notre Dame. 
President Bush's nominee for the next Secretary of State ­who earned her master's degree from the University, served on the Board of Trustees and received an honorary doctorate when she delivered the com­mencement address in 1995 ­first visited the school at the urg­ing of University President­Emeritus Father Theodore llesburgh. 
Rice, a star pupil at the University of Denver, "was going to look at colleges out east ­Harvard, Yale," Hesburgh said. "So I said, 'Well, you can't get there without going by Notre Dame s~.you've got to [come] see us first.

ND makes 5 year deal with SBC for network 
By AMANDA MICHAELS Associare News Editor 

SBC Communications announced plans Tuesday for a multi-million dollar, five-year deal with Notre Dame that will make the campus home to one of the largest, state-of-the-art Voice over Internet Protocol (VoiP) networks in the country. 
The VoiP system will replace the current phone network with an Internet-based system that will link users to advanced fea­tures like a single inbox for voice and e-mail messages, "click-to-call" functionality from computers and "find me, follow me" call routing options, according to an SBC press release. Additionally, a "plug­and-play" service allows for the addition of new phones and service and location changes. 
Accessible campus-wide and via the internet, the network makes users reachable outside the office -a problem with the current, Centrex-based system. 
"We're not just replacing phones, we're outfitting the University with a completely new network which enables to bring together voice and data systems into single network," SBC representative Sarah Silva said.

By MADDIE HANNA News Writer 

Andy Thayer, founder of the Chicago Anti-Bashing Network, spoke about inequality and dis­crimination directed at gays and lesbians members of the South Bend community Wednesday night at the Notre Dame Center for Social Concerns. 
"If we're going to combat the problem of anti-gay violence, we need to go to the root of the problem. The question is, what gives rise to this hatred of gay people?" Thayer asked. 
In answering that question, Thayer blamed the government. 
"If the government says it's okay to dehumanize humans, it sends a message to society at large," he said. "The fact of the

Giri advocates gender justice 
By APRIL THOMAS 
News Writer 
World-renowned women's social activist Dr. V. Mohini Giri brought her message of gender justice to Saint Mary's College Wednesday. 
No stranger to the spotlight, Giri is the daughter-in-law of the former president of India, the late Shri. V. V. Giri. She is also the founding president of the War Widows Association, a for­mer chairperson for the National Commission for Women, and author of "Kanya-Exploitation of Little Angels" and several other gender-based works. 
Giri casually noted that her preferred lecture audience is men. 
"Women don't need to hear they're subjugated," Giri said. "They already know they are." 
Giri's lil'e in India has given her inspiration to change the culture of female submission, which she feels is upheld both by patri­archy and social norms. Giri said that in India it is common for a woman to be tortured for her dowry debt. Some women may be expected to throw themselves on their husbands' funeral pyres, or are confined to a dark room for forty days of isolation follow­ing their spouse's death. 
"My job as a social activist is to stop these harmful norms," Giri said. 
Violence against women also emerges as a social normalcy. "Alcohol is a great curse in India," Giri said. 
Many men spend their incomes on alcohol, leaving their wives and children undernourished. Giri noted that female infanticide and poverty also specifically tar­gets Indian women. Most women have no land rights or means of individual e·conomic survival. 
"Women are the poorest of the poor," Giri said. "We must mobi­lize women toward self-sufficien­cy." 
Giri explained that her work strives to spread this self-suffi­ciency through three modes of empowerment -women must be informed of their legal and social rights, women must be· given leadership training and they must have access to micro­credits, or pooled community financial resources, enabling women to pursue entrepreneur­ship. 
"Only 80 percent of Indian women can read and write," Giri said. "Just 1 percent can enter college." 
Thus, to encourage wide­spread delivery messages of empowerment, Giri's organiza­tions create dramas, street plays and songs to reach women from all walks of education, not mere­ly the literate. 
Giri addressed the political arena as a crucial position for women to establish a voice in policymaking. Giri asserted that she will push for 33 percent female representation in Indian parliament, a step of affirmative action. 
"The situation of women in politics is very sad. India has only 8 percent women represen­
tatives," Giri said. "In the United States, it is only 14 percent." Giri's activism resonated with Saint Mary's junior Katie Kelly. 
"She's a visionary," Kelly said. "She is very passionate about women obtaining political posi­tions. It's not about power, but social change." 
Anita Houck of the Saint Mary's religious education department organized Giri's visit. 
"I knew she was a perfect fit for what we're doing here with justice education, women's stud­ies and religious studies," Houck said. 
Giri's adamancy of peace addressed both India's three wars with Pakistan, and the United States' current war with Iraq. Speaking from her experi­ence collectively reaching out to Pakistani women during war, Giri called for dialogue and insisted that women play a vital role in establishing harmony. 
"Peace and women are inter­connected," Giri said. "And with­out peace there is no develop­ment." 
Though conditions now are far from favorable, Giri insists that education is vital in establishing gender equality -especially developing courses in men's studies. Female submission is not merely "women's problem." 
"We need to help teach men to be responsible husbands, sons, brothers and friends of the women in their lives," said Giri.

Implementation of the sys­tem will begin in 2005 and continue over the next two to three years, according to Silva. 
"This is not like an all-at­once, grand restructuring," Silva said. "It's a gradual phased migration." 
Silva also said that SBC expects the transition process to be relatively hassle-free. 
"Because they're both SBC systems, we can integrate the systems as you move from wireline into VoiP infrastruc­ture to make the transition smooth," Silva said.

"We are excited 
to work with the 
University of Notre Dame in implementing one of the largest migrations to hosted VoiP to date," Cathy Coughlin, president of Business Communications Services, SBC Global Services, Inc. said in a press release. "We have provided reliable solutions to educational insti­tutions of all sizes for more than a century, and we believe the University of Notre Dame's forward-thinking approach will serve as a model for other customers with large, com­plex campus environments that are looking to migrate to a hosted IP solution."

Thayer said that the Joss of constitutional rights for gays would endanger the rights of all Americans. 
"You allow the far right in this country to pick on, to vilify any group of Americans -you allow them to get away with that. and it sets a horrible precedent for other people," Thayer said. 
Swit1:hing to the topic of gay marriage, Thayer said that 1,1:~8 federal rights are obtained by marriage. They inelude access to pension and Social Security survivors' bene­lits, immigration rights, medical care,\ and the ability to adopt childrnn, among many others. 
"Many gay and lesbian cou­ples are forced to immigrate from this country because they can't get their partner natural­ized," Thaynr said. 
H111:alling one woman's com­plaint about the immigration laws, Thayer said, ..She told me, 'I can bring my dog into this country, but I can't bring my wife."' 
Thayer said that 52 percent of heterosexual couples are currently raising kids. llowever, what many people don't know is that a full 33 percent of gay eouples and 42 percent of les­bian couples arc also bringing up children, Thayer said. . 
"Marriage is a survival issue for many people in the gay and lesbian community," Thayer said. "The issue here is civil marriage. The government, which all of us pay taxes to -is it going to treat us as human beings?" 
Thayer also referring to the ability of gays to marry in Canada and the Netherlands. 
"There are truly equal mar­riage rights, and you can't say the sky is falling in [because of them I," he said. "Maybe the Netherlands lhasl something up on the U.S. The U.S. is a world leader in family dysfunction." 
Thayer also talked about for­mer Speaker of the House Next Gingrich's criticism of the gay community. 
"Those who vilify us are some of the best destroyers of the family. For example, take Nnwt Cingrieh," he said. 
Pointing out Cingrich's flawed history as a family man, Thayer rnferrnd to the former Speaker of the House's multiple divorces. 
"Thny [critics of gay mar­riageI can never seem to map it out how our marriages affect theirs. They must bn truly inse­cure in their own marriages," he said. 
Thaynr criticized former presidential candidate John K11rry and the Democrats for not taking a dear stand on gay righL'> in this month's election. 
"Civil rights and equality is likn a light switch -it's either im or oil'. Equality or discrimi­nation'?" he said. 
Thaynr also said that gays and lesbians should not settle f'or dvilunions, but stand up f'or themsnlves.

Attendance at the National Association of Graduate and Professional Students confer­ence and upcoming legislation in the U.S. congress concern­ing graduate students were the main concerns at Tuesday's Graduate Student Union meeting. 
President John Young and eo-vice president Amanda

The first would make all future graduate student stipends tax exempt. The sec­ond, which will be addressed later in the U.S. Congress' agenda, is the renewal of the lligher Education Act.

Matthews said she felt that the'conference helped to foster good working relationships with other graduate students and contacts from other schools. 
"Our objective was to seek out and make contacts with those organizations, and we were able to achieve that," she said. 
After the overview of NAGPS' main functions, Young also discussed two pieces of leg­islation up for consideration in the coming year that the NAGPS will focus on. The outcome of both pieces of legislation, Young said, would be extremely impor-

He proposed that

"I think we [The GSU] ~ have the funds to send a few graduate stu­dents from Notre Dame to help

Matthews said the NAGPS conference provided a way for graduate students to help pro­mote their needs in a setting where they can be effective. 
"We think that Graduate stu­dents have a very strong voice, we just need that to be repre­sented within our national government." Matthews said. "We think that if we give our students an opportunity to speak we feel that they can voice our concerns clearly and strongly. We're just trying to

Catholic Cardinal condemns media, partisan forces for attacking U.S. bishops 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON Washington Cardinal Theodore McCarrick blamed the media and partisan activists for unjustly attacking U.S. Roman Catholic bishops who spoke out this elec­tion year on whether dis­senting Catholic politi­cians should receive Communion. He accused them of spreading inter­nal dissension among church leaders. 
In a speech delivered behind closed doors and released Wednesday, McCarrick pleaded for unity among his col­leagues. 
"The media or partisan forces. sometimes tried to pit one bishop against another. I look around the room and see bishops who have been unfairly attacked as partisan, oth­ers who have been called cowards," he said during a private session of the

Iraqi suicide bomber blasts convoy 
Associated Press 
BAGHDAD, Iraq -A suicide car bomber blasted an American con­voy north of Baghdad and U.S. troops battled insurgents west of the capital Wednesday as a wave of violence across Iraq's Sunni Muslim heartland killed at least 27 people. 
American forces pursued their search-and-destroy mission against the remaining holdouts in the for­mer insurgent bastion of Fallujah, and to the north, American forces pressed an offensive to reclaim part of the city of Mosul from mili­tants. 
November became one of Iraq's bloodiest months as the U.S. death toll in the war in Iraq reached 1,206 with new Defense Department identifications Tuesday night and Wednesday, according to an Associated Press tally. 

On Wednesday, a suicide attacker drove his bomb-laden car into a 
U.S. convoy during fierce fighting in the town of Beiji, 155 miles north of the Baghdad, killing 10 people and wounding 12, including three American soldiers. Another attack on a convoy of civilian con­tractors in Beiji caused no casual­ties. 
Elsewhere, a three-hour gunbat­tle between militants and U.S. forces after nightfall left seven peo­ple dead and 13 hurt in Ramadi, a city west of Fallujah. 
Insurgents fired rocket-propelled grenades, mortar and Kalashnikov rifles at American forces in the city center, Zayout district and along the main highway in town, said Abele!. Karim al-Hiti of Ramadi General Hospital. 
Ramadi, about 70 miles west of Baghdad, falls within the restive Sunni Triangle area north and west of the capital where the bulk of insurgent attacks have erupted. 
Although fighting has ebbed in Fal)ujah, it has not ceased. The 
U.S. military said pockets of insur­gents remain even though the city is fully occupied by American troops.

Utility holding company pays up 
CINCINNATI -A Cinergy Corp. affiliate agreed to pay a $3 million fine to settle feder­al regulatory charges that two traders in the energy company's Houston-based natural gas trading operation falsely reported information on gas deals. 
The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission announced the fine Tuesday, say­ing two traders with Cinergy Marketing & Trading knowingly reported inaccurate infor­mation from August 2000 to July 2002 to two McGraw-Hill publications that compile prices used to settle trades in natural gas markets. 
The wmpany admitted no wrongdoing but agreed to the finfl to end the case, Cinergy spohsman Steve Brash said Wednesday. Cinergy fired one of the traders and trans­ferred the other to another job off the trading floor. he said. 
An number of false trades were submitted by e-mail and telephone, the commission said. 
Kohl's sued over look~alike shoes 
GHAND HAPIDS, Mich. -Wolverine World Wide Inc. has filed a patent-infringement law­suit against Harbor Footwear Group Ltd. and Kohl's Corp., claiming the companies copied and sold popular styles of Wolverine's Merrell brand of shoes. 
The lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court in Grand Hapids and seeks an unspecified amount of money. It also asks that the defen­dants be prohibited from making and selling specific styles of Harbor's GBX brand of adult and children's shoes. 
"While the footwear community typically respeets the ereative rights and the intellectu­al property developed by other eompanies, some in our industry find it easier to copy suc­cessful patterns rather than develop their own styles," said Jacques Lavertue, president of Wolverine's Outdoor Group. "Merrell will not tolerate the violation of our innovative and proprietary designs and will aggressively defend our intellectual property through the courts." 
A man who answered the telephone Tuesday at Port Washington, N.Y.-based Harbor said the company would not publiely comment about the lawsuit.

12 filtns cotnpete for Oscar 
·Academy documentary nominees announced 
Associated Press 
LOS ANGELES --The fast-food indictment "Super Size Me" is among 12 films competing for best documentary at the Academy Awards. 
Other documentaries on the list of contenders released Tuesday by the Academy of Motion Picture Arl<; and Sciences include "Tupac: Resurrection," an examination of the life of slain rapper Tupac Shakur; the surfing chronicle "Riding Giants," the first docu­mentary ever to open the Sundance Film Festival; and "Born Into Brothels," a look at the harsh lives of children of Calcutta prostitutes, which won Sundance's audience award for favorite documentary last January. 
"Super Size Me" hilariously traees director Morgan Spurlock's physical and emotional deteriora­tion during a month he spent on an all-McDonald's diet. 
The film is one of the highest­grossing documentaries ever with $11.5 million at the domestic box ol'fiee. "Super Size Me" ranked behind "Fahrenheit 9/11," which grossPd $120 million, as the No. 2 documentary of 2004.

safe space for people who live alternative lifestyles," Anna Gomberg, graduate stu­dent and co-coordinator of the unrecognized student group AllianceND, said. 
She said this is the second year the orange T-shirt demonstration has occurred. Sponsored by the Notre Dame department of sociology, the Graduate Student Union and other student groups, yester­day's events had no official connection to AllianceND. 
'Although Gomberg said there had been some nega­tive feedback to the events, overall, she was very pleased with the reaction and the "positive energy" she had witnessed. 
"I think Notre Dame has a long ways to go in terms of becoming a eomfortable place for people of all sexual orientations, but I think that it has come very far," she said. 
Gomberg also said that around 500 shirts had been sold already this year. 
Students choose the date for the demonstrations and events to coincide with the opening of the play "Angels in America" in Washington Hall. 
Freshman Scott Dilts expressed regret that these events were even necessary. 
"It's sad that we need to have a day like this. There shouldn't be any question that homosexuals deserve our respect, or that any other 
group of people does," Dilts said. 
However, Dilts also said he didn't think the shirts would be effective in changing peo­ple's opinions. 
"You wear it if you support gays and don't wear it if you don't. It's just a declaration of the position you already hold," he said. 
Eugene Walls, graduate student, fully supported yes­terday's events, saying, 
"It's a good way to keep the dialogue going. We feel that on campus, it's really a monologue," he said. 
According to Walls, the campus culture is ready to 
support a Gay Straight Alliance. 
"Six hundred plus people wearing this shirt is probably the largest show of solidarity on this campus. The administration, that's the only culture here that's not ready," Walls said. 
Sophomore Monica Nanda said also consid­ered the day's events very effective.

Jones said that he thought the shirt demonstration was unnecessary. 
"If you're going to be gay, that's fine, but you don't need to broadcast it to everyone. Besides, there's plenty of other things people get excluded for that nobody parades around," he said. 
Like Jones, sophomore Tommy Forr criticized the shirts and. closet, saying both events went too far as pubic demonstrations. 
"The closet's a little over­board," Forr said. "[The

shirt] is just too ambiguous for me to wear. I think we need to accept them [gays and les­bians] as peo­ple, but the shirts imply we should accept a lifestyle, and I'm not going to do that." 
Senior Chris Christensen organized a counter demon­stration for stu­dents to dress 
up instead of wearing the 
see stealing or lying," Christensen said. 
He said that dressing up could even show respect for gay students. 
"At the prompting of a friend, I think it's a very good idea for us to dress up as a show of respect and even honor for those who struggle with homosexual tendencies," he said. 
Senior Monica Kolf also dressed up for the occasion. 
"It's not that we're focusing on homosexuality, but on marriage," she said. 
Even with the presence of these negative opinions, some thought the Princeton Review's ranking of Notre Dame as number one for "Alternative Lifestyles not an Alternative" was largely inac­curate. 
"I don't think we deserve the number one ranking on Princeton Review at all. I think students in general are pretty accepting -it's more of the administration not accepting AllianceND," Stagl said. 
Sister Mary Louise Gude, advisor to the Standing Committee on Gay and Lesbian Student Needs, said that she did not consider the stereotype perpetuated by the Princeton Review to be valid. 
"I don't think it's the case, and I don't think the gay and 
·lesbian students would say that either. If you're out on this campus, you're well treated -that's what the gay and lesbian students would say," she said.

"I think this is awesome. It's a bigger success than last year, which is saying a lot," she said. 
However, some students commented negatively on the shirts and closet. 
"It's pretty anti-Catholic," freshman Blake Jones said. "It seems to me that we can be accepting without wearing orange shirts. 

"First, it does not insult. But, it gives us the opportuni­ty to explain what we really think about the gay and les­bian issue -that we don't hate gays and lesbians, but we simply disagree with their choices and see those choic­es, not the individuals, as objectively immoral, like we

The Notre Dame Center for Ethics and Culture's fifth annual fall conf$3-rence vvill examine the variety of vvays in vvhich the fine arts can help build a more genuinely Christian civilization in an era that is ever more deeply post­Christian in its character. Our first triennial series culminated in proposals on hovv to build a genuine culture of life, and last year's conference reflected on the renevve:~l and formation at the heart of such a culture. This conference vvill focus our reflection on the fine arts and their place in a culture of life.

Jesus' true message, the man opined with some conviction, had been about Jovfl (Jesus was for it) and tolerance (he was in favor of that tool. But the Church had twisted that message and made it about rules and, while we were on the subject, Christians are hypocrites too.

asked, fully knowing that the question 
was unanswerable. 

The first systematic attempt by schol­ars to get behind the gospels to the Jesus of history began in Germany in the 19th century, at more or less the same lime that Leopold von Hanke, the father of modern historical scholarship, offered the novel suggestion that the 
·historian should limit himself' to describing the events of the past as they had happened. Scholars wrote widely­read and controversial tomes offering to revnal the man behind the myths. When George Elliot translated one of these works, David Strauss' "Life of Jesus," the publie was scandalized. 
The common flaw of these 19th cen­tury lives of Jesus was diagnosed by Albert Schweitzer, a missionary doctor and musicologist who himself has a fair claim to being one of the most remark­able men to have ever lived. Schweitzer surveyed the work of these historians and conducted that the authors had all constructed an image of Jesus which corresponded with their own moral convictions. The historical Jesus was a mirror in which people saw, not their own reflection, but the personification of their ideals. 
Schweitzer was only concerned with the historians, but his lesson applies more generally: tell me what you make of Jesus and I'll tell you who you are. 

When we read William Blake calling Christ an artist it tells us a lot about Blake but nothing about Jesus. Oscar Wilde had the talent to be a professor of Greek, thought not the temperament, and when he was a prisoner in Heading Gaol he sustained himself through a dose reading of the Gospels in the origi­nal Greek. And yet even those of us who have to rely upon a translation can see that the conclusion he drew, that Christ was a supreme poet, was largely a result of his wishful thinking. 
In the Gospels we find what we are 

looking for, and nothing else. To some Jesus is nothing more than a font of ''I'm OK, you're OK" banalities, a YMCA camp counselor who somehow got mis­taken for the Messiah. 
To others he appears to be a mar­tyred advoeatn for their favorite cause. Jesus said "Blessed are the peacemak­ers," which has a nice ring to it, and is just vague enough to sncure the nod­ding of heads from almost any audi­ence. lie also said "I have not come to bring peaee, but a sword," although I don't expeet you '11 see that chalked onto a sidnwalk any tin~e soon. 
Some are as interested in Jesus' silence as in his teaching. As far as we know, Jesus never explieitly eondemned same-sex intercourse, although that seems like slim evidence for the conclu­sion that he was the only rabbi in the first century who saw nothing wrong with it. But he was not silent about het­erosexual lust or the love of wealth, and taught that both were serious spiritual dangers. We should not b(~ surprised if those who disagree with the Catholic position on homosexuality have little patience with those who quote scripture only when it forbids that for which they have never felt desire. 
In preparation fi>r writing this artiele I resolved to reread the Gospels. It proved harder than I expoeted. W.Il. Auden once said that a real book is not one that we read, but one that reads us. The Jesus of the Gospels is rather like that. Whereas the Jesus we know is a comfortable figure; the Jesus who knows us is altogether more frighten­ing. But if that wasn't the case, what could his forgiveness mean'?

Let the light of '# 1' shine again 
I remember the light that used to shine down upon us from the "#1" high above campus during the 1988 and 1989 sea­sons and the sense of spirit and confi­dence that accompanied it. I imagine that the students on campus today must look up at its darkened framework and wonder about the magic of a not-too-dis­tant yesteryear. 
I fondly recall traveling from New York to watch the Irish do battle during the late '70s under coach Dan Devine, a few fleeting moments of glory under coach Gerry Faust during the early '80s and, of course, my years as a student under coach Lou Holtz. I arrived at Notre Dame during the fall of 1989 on the heels of the national championship. Our team was number one in the land and the prevailing thought that year was not whether we would win but rather if the opposition would score. The campus was disappointed by narrow victories, some­what sated by blowouts and devastated by that awful defeat at the callous hands of our archrival, the Miami Hurricanes. Ah yes, Catholics v. Convicts. 
Much has changed. The landscape of college football has been altered and the 24 hours a day, seven days a week ban­ter of cable television has enabled a multitude of schools to achieve some­what comparable exposure. Granted, scholarships have been lessened

them and supporting them in the face of all the Notre Dame naysayers that I encounter everyday. 
Although I have rarely been as frus­trated with a Notre Dame team, perhaps that frustration is an initial spark signal­ing our bright future. I did not experi­ence that level of frustration very often over the course of the last 10 years. But this current team is different, and they evoke those troubling emotions because they are capable of doing and achieving so much good. Perhaps the coaching staff must be heJd accountable for failing to realize this potential on the playing field but the potential is there, and we must attribute a portion of that to the efforts of coach Tyrone Willingham and his staff. 
I truly believe that there is a light at the end of the tunnel and that Willingham will guide our University toward that light if he is given the chance. Better yet, maybe that light is not at the end of the tunnel but high above campus, festering in that all too dormant "#1," which waits to shine down on the current student body once again. Then they will know that the old "#1" it is not mere legend, that the light did shine and can and will shine again.

ALBUM REVIEWS 
John Mayer hits his stride 
By BECCA SAUNDERS Assistant Scene Editor 
The best version of John Mayer is him in concert. Live, Mayer often extends his songs to upwards of 10 minutes, feeling every chord he pJays as he grooves across the stage. -Mayer's talent exceeds what any listener can grasp from his studio albums, and as such the "As/Is" album is a little piece of soulful heaven for any Mayer fan, and is at least an interesting album for others. For any­one who wants to belt along to many of Mayer's hits over the entire span of his career, "As/Is" is a good album. But for anyone who wants to hear a spectacular guitar player and musician hit his stride, "As/Is" is the album. 
The "As/Is" collection has only recent­ly been released by Mayer on iTunes. 

comes in the form of "Blues Intro" and "Inner City Blues (Make Me Wanna Holler)." Both tracks feature Mayer playing a bluesy beat, with a little funk twist in "Inner City Blues," which fea­tures a OJ and shows a different side of Mayer's musical prowess. 
For the most part the songs sound similar to their studio recordings. They are just extended and expounded upon by Mayer musically and vocally. With only seven tracks on the first album and eight on the second, it is obvious the songs are extended in length quite a bit. Generally the songs are all between five and 10 minutes, often doubling, and sometimes almost tripling, the time of the studio recorded versions. This gives Mayer time to play music related to the song, and at times seemingly completely unrelated to the song, but even the improvisation is better than what many people release after months in the stu­dio. 
"As/Is" is a must for any Mayer fan who has never seen him in concert. Live Mayer cuts loose and lets the music con­trol the show and thus the pure music is very obviously the driving force on "As/Is." There is only a slight bit of irri­tating crowd background noise and par­ticipation, but when it exists, it is not extremely distracting. "As/Is" is Mayer at his best. The album may not be easy to get a hold of (it is chiefly only avail­able online). but it is well worth the trouble.

As/Is John Mayer 
Aware/Columbia 


For sale as an album only, Mayer's live performances from his tour this past summer in Houston, Cleveland, Philadelphia and Mountain View, Calif. are each on a separate album titled "As/Is: Houston," etc. However, avail­able on an actual album is a collection of live performances, from a larger vari­ety of venues. Recordings from Ohio, New Jersey, Texas, California and even a Kansas show compose the two-disc set of 15 songs. 
The majority of the songs are ones nearly anyone remotely familiar with Mayer will recognize. The hits are there, "No Such Thing," "Your Body is a Wonderland," "Come Back to Bed," along with others. However, there are also a couple of tracks that are a bit harder to find, such as the most suc­cessful song from his first independent release, "Comfortable." The real novelty 



Brooks and Dunn do it again 

up to the No. 1 spot on the "Hot Country Singles" Billboard chart. The song must be a parental favorite with lyrics that include, "Well, they won't go to bed I or do what you said or eat their food I They cry and they fuzz and you can't I even cuss 'cause they'll say it, too I You're tired and you're numb I and you're stressed and you're mad I and she smiles and says 'I love you, Dad." 
The other new tracks are "Independent Trucker," and "A Man. This Lonely." Both are excellent addi­tions to the ever popular collection. 
The group has come a long way since the-release of its debut album "Brand New Moon,'' which propelled it to almost instantaneous fame. The song "Boot Scootin' Boogie," from the album is considered a country music classic. With Dunn leading vocals, and Brooks working the guitar, the viva­cious twosoiT,le has established a hefty collection of awards and accolades. This year marks the 1Oth year Brooks and Dunn has taken home the much­esteemed "Vocal Duet of the Year" Country Music Award. The two have also received the "Top Vocal Duet" American Country Music Award for a 
total of seven years. 
Their compilation of smash hit records and animated songs are no doubt proof this record will be hang­ing out at the top of the Billboards charts for a reasonably long time. Finishing up its third week on the charts since its Oct. 19 release, "The Greatest Hits Collection, Vol. 2," comes in at an impressive No. 6 posi­tion. New listeners and long-time fanatics alike can easily enjoy this CD, which is jam-packed with the group's best hits since 1998.

Picking up where they left off in 1998, Brooks and Dunn's ""The Greatest Hits Collection, Vol. 2" oozes chart-topping hits. With many records under its cowboy hats, this dynamic duo knows exactly what to do to satis­l'y its fans and pick some new ones up along the way. 
Consistently at the top of their game, Leon "Kix" Brooks and Ronnie Dunn have created a style of music now referred to as "New Traditionalist Country." Still maintaining its honky­tonk image, the vocal duo has effec­tively added the influences of pop and rock, and pushed its fan base beyond the limits of country enthusiasts. 
"The Greatest Hits Collection, Vol. 2" is basically a guaranteed favorite for

Brooks and Dunn fans, since it includes all of the duo's most recent radio frontrunners. The reminiscent and romantic songs, "Red Dirt Road," and "My Heart is Lost to you," are two of the more mellow ballads the duo have chosen to present. Also brought in are foot tapping songs "You Can't Take the Hooky-Tonk" and "Ain't Nothing 'Bout You." Naturally the hit "Only in America" is included, with lyrics that shout, "Only in America I Dreaming in red, white and blue I Only in America I Where we dream as big as we want to I We all get a chance I Everybody gets to dance." It was an uplifting patriotic broadcast following the September 11 terrorist attacks. 
Along with previously released favorites, three new songs are also thrown into the inix. "That's What its All About," has already reached air waves, and made its way all the way

mass schedule 
considerations ... The Reason(s) Why We Sing 
by Karen Schneider-Kirner Director, Handbefl and Celebration Choirs Assistant Director, Folk Choir Assistant Organist, BasiUca of the Sacred Heart 
This coming Monday, November 22, we mark the feast day of Saint Cecilia, patroness of church music, virgin and martyr. This is an important feast day for the hundreds of students who serve weekly in hall chapels and in the Basilica as ministers of music. Members of Campus Ministry choirs will gather at the 5:15pm Basilica Mass tomorrow to celebrate the saint's upcoming feast and gather in fellowship. 
~aint <!Cecilia, l9rap for Ws! 
Who exactly was St. Cecilia? Many details of her life will forever remain unknown, but appearing around the middle of the fifth century was a document entitled "Acts of the Martyrdom of St. Cecilia," which related the story of her life. A Christian by birth to an upper class family, Cecilia was given in marriage by her family to a noble pagan youth, Valerianus. She, however, was determined to uphold her virginity, having dedicated herself to God. On her wedding day, while musical instruments we_re playing, she appeared to be "singing in her heart alone to God." She was said to have professed, "Make my heart and body pure that I may not be confounded." 
At a time when Christianity was illegal in Rome, she ended up converting her husband and his brother to the faith. Not long after, they were beheaded for this. Cecilia was discovered not long after and was ordered to meet a similar fate. The first attempts at execution were miraculously unsuccessful, and during this time of suffering she saw to it that her assets were given to the poor and that her house would be used as a church. 
There are many medieval portraits of the saint from the 14th and 15th centuries where Cecilia is represented playing the organ. W~en the Academy of Music was founded in Rome in 1584, she was named patroness of this institution, at which time her veneration as the patroness of church music became more universal. 
Musicians have a very important role in the Church, and we musicians on the staff of Campus Ministry are very indebted to the generosity and talents that our students share sowillinglyweekafterweek. As the U.S. Catholic bishops' document "Music in Catholic Worship" states, "Among the many signs and symbols used by the Church to celebrate its faith, music is of preeminent importance." Why might this be true? 
As the document continues, "Music should assist the assembled believers to express and share the gift of faith that is within them and to nourish and strengthen their interior commitment of faith. It shquld heighten the texts so that they speak more fully and more effectively. The quality of joy and enthusiasm which music adds to community worship cannot be gained in any other way." This is a huge responsibility, and this is why musicians train so long and hard to perfect their craft. 
Music is unquestionably a great gift from God. Music lifts us up when we feel downtrodden, helps us express what is in the depths of our hearts, deepens our prayer when words can go no further, and unifies many disparate voices into one great voice of praise. While styles of music and choices of instruments may vary from Mass to Mass, when all strive to make Mass a prayer, the end result is that men and women of faith are proclaiming and sharing their faith in prayer, so that Christ may grow among us all. We are so blessed to be at Notre Dame, which celebrates the intertwining of faith and intellect, with so many opportunities for spiritual development. Soli Deo Gloria!

DENVEH -Prosecutors 
dropped  a  marijuana pos­ 
session  charge against  
Denver  Nugget  star  

Carmelo Anthony on Wediwsday, saying it would be tough to get a conviction after a friend claimed the drug was his, not Anthony's. 
Anthony was charged with possessing less than I ounco of marijuana on Oct. 15 after a bag with the drug was found in his backpack as the team wait­ed to board a l"light to Milwaukee for a preseason game. 
Anthony said the drug 
belonged to a friend, James Cunningham. Cunningham signed an al"lidavit saying it was his. 
Cunningham, who often stays with Anthony when he is in town on business, said he borrowed the back­pack without Anthony's knowledge and aceidental­ly left the marijuana in it. 
"Carmelo is happy to huvn been vindieatod by the casn being dismissed," said Anthony's attornoy, Daniel Hecht. "From the boginning, lw has said ho was innocent and rwver intended to possess the marijuana." 
Shortly after Anthony was charged, Nuggets gen-

INDIANAPOLIS -The Indianapolis Colts could be playing the Chicago Boars Sunday without their starting guards.

Guard Hiek DeMulling has be1m limited in practice because of a bruised chest. He was replaced in the starting lineup last week by rookie Jake Scott. 
But the Colts were dealt another blow Wednesday when backup guard Makoa Freitas could not practice bocause he hurt his back lifting weights Monday. If Freitas can't play, coach Tony Dungy said rookie Ryan Lilja would likely make his first NFL start. 
The Colts also put offensivn line­man Trevor Hutton on the active ros­ter, signed offensive lineman Joe.

end ofseason 
RALEIGII, N.C. -East Carolina football coach John Thompson will step down at the end of the season, a school source told The Associated Press on Wednesday. 
Thompson, 3-18 in two seasons, was to announce his resignation Wednesday at an afternoon news conference on the school's campus in Greenville, according to the source, who spoke on condition of' anonymity. 
Thompson will coach the Pirates in their last two games, the source said. 
The Pirates (2-7, 2-5 Conference USA) play Memphis on Saturday, then finish their season Nov. 27 against North Carolina Stahl. 
The move comes about two months after Terry 1lolland was hired as ath­letic director at East Carolina. 
Thompson was the defensive coor­dinator at Florida when he was hired to take over from Steve Logan in December 2002. The East Carolina job was his f'irst lwad coaching assignment arter 20 years as an assistant at eight schools. Percival aS!rees to two-year

Irish sign 7 players to national letters of intent 
By JUSTIN SCHUVER Associate Spores Editor 
Irish coach Dave Poulin recently announced the signing of seven players to national letters of intent to play for Notre Dame. Four of the seven players will join the team in the 2005-06 season, while the remaining three will defer for until the 2006-07 season. 
Forwards Eric Condra (Livonia, Mich.) and Christian Hanson (Venetia, Pa.) along with goalie Jordan Pearce· (Anchorage, Alaska) and defenseman Jamie Silverson (Thunder Bay, Ont.) are the four who signed to play next season immediately. Defenseman Kyle Lawson (New Hudson, Mich.) and forwards Kevin Deeth (Gig Harbor, Wash.) and Ryan Thang (Edina, Minn.) will defer and play one more year of junior hockey before coming to the Irish. 
Condra, Hanson, Pearce and Silverson will step in next season to help fill the void left by the graduating class of 2005 that will include current senior forward Cory McLean, goalie Morgan Cey and defenseman Joe Zurenko. 
Pearce will especially be a big part of the future of the Irish, and should continue the line of impres­sive Notre Dame netminders, join­ing current sophomore David Brown and junior Rory Walsh in the mix for goaltending next sea­son. 
The 6-foot-1, 195-pound goalie is currently one of the best goal­tenders in the United States Hockey League, playing for the Lincoln Stars. Pearce is already familiar with the Joyce Center ice, after playing with the U.S. National Team Development Program Under-18 hockey team in an exhibition last year. 
Pearce started the game against the Irish, making 25 saves in Notre Dame's 4-0 victory over the Under-18 team. 
"This might be the best goalie recruit in the country," Poulin said. "Y<'m're looking at a kid who is excelling in Lincoln and who continues the tradition we're mak­ing of being a program for out­standing goalies." 
Silverson could be another play­er in the mold of current sopho­more defenseman Wes O'Neill -a big tall defenseman with skills. The 6-foot-4, 225-pound defense­man is currently a member of the British Columbia Hockey League's Salmon Arm Silverbacks. 
He was a teammate of O'Neill and current Irish freshman for­ward Victor Oreskovich on Ontario's Under-17 team at the 2002 Canadian Championships in Nova Scotia. 
"[Silverson] is probably even bigger than Wes," Poulin said. "[Silverson] was Wes' defensive partner on that U-17 team and they complimented each other real well."

Associated Press COLUMBUS, Ohio Jamaica failed to advance in World Cup qualifying, tying the United States 1-1 Wednesday in a game the Reggae Boyz needed to win. For the Americans, the match was merely a tuneup and a chance to give several young players World Cup qualifying experience. The Americans, who got a goal from Eddie Johnson, won a spot in next year's six-team regional finals with a 6-0 win over Panama last month. Panama advanced to the regional finals with a 3-0 win over El Salvador on Wednesday. Johnson scored in the 15th minute for the Americans on a lofting pass from Pablo Mastroeni. Andy Williams tied the score in the 27th minute on a penalty kick. The Jamaicans played with the ferocity of a team that had everything to lose, win­ning the ball in the air and challenging the U.S. defense in the second half by pulling all of their players up the field.

Jan1aica plays United States to a 1-1 dravv 
tributed to the physical play 
that dominated throughout. 
There were 38 fouls -13 for 
the Americans and 26 for ·Jamaica. 
Jamaica would have 
advanced with a win, or a tie 
coupled with a Panama tie or 
loss. The Reggae Boyz were 
seeking to return to the World 
Cup after qualifying in 1998 
and falling short in 2002. 
Up-and-comer Johnson 
scored for the fifth time in 
three games. Mastroeni lofted 
a pass over the Jamaican 
defense line, and Johnsob 
gave the ball a quick tap with 
his right foot then knocked it 
past diving goalkeeper 
Donovan Ricketts with his 
left. 
Johnson, 20, a forward on­
the MLS' Dallas Burn, has 
scored five goals in only 61 
minutes of play on the U.S. 
team. 
The Jamaicans evened the 
score after a defensive miscue 
by an American player mak­
ing his first World Cup quali­
fying appearance. 
Ramiro Corrales threw him­
self in front of Ricardo Fuller 
to break up a run to the goal. 
Williams' penalty kick sailed 
low,_ past a diving Kasey 
Keller. 
The Americans went a man 
down in the 73rd minute 
when defender Oguchi 
Onyewu collected his second 
yellow card for a hand ball 
and was ejected. 
The Reggae Boyz were 
unable to capitalize. Their 
best scoring chance in the 
second half came in the 84th 
minute when substitute 
Marlon King broke free near 
the goal. He could only man­
age a weak shot that went 
directly into the hands of 
Keller. 
The Americans began the 
game conservatively, focusing 
on short passes in the mid­
field. In the fourth minute, 
Johnson collected the ball in 
front of the goal after Ricketts 
tried to clear but only got a 
piece of it.· Instead of taking 
the shot from 10 yards out, 
Johnson passed it back. 
The Americans came back 
in the second half with two 
forwards instead of three, 
and bunkered in front of the 
goal to prevent a loss. 
The U.S. extended its 
unbeaten streak to 13 games, 
the longest in team history. 
Their only loss in 2004 was to 
the Netherlands in February.

while Stires does the play-by­play. 
''I'm just trying it out," Riley said of the radio broadcasting. "''m just excited I got to catch the first two games. and broad­casting is something I'm inter­estf~d in. So when I am in town, Sean lets me be his sidekick. He does his job and lets me talk a little bit. And I'm calling Notre Dame games, so it makes it a lit­tle easier for me." 
Hiley, a member of the 2001 Notre Dame national champi­onship team, returned to Notre Dame with yet another award. as 
she was part of "It was amazing to said it was an the U.S. women's be {in Athens for amazing feeling.

that won the gold it into words," medal in Athens. she said. "You're I Iowever, she was Ruth Riley standing up not originally there, seeing
former Irish center 
represent your country is such an honor -to be over there and wearing a jersey that says 'USA."' 
For the girl from small-town Macy, Ind., being an Olympian has been a life-long dream. 
"Since I was little [I wanted to play in the Olympics!," Hiley said. "The WNBA wasn't around, so that wasn't a goal when I was growing up. So when you're sitting there, a lit­tle girl watching the Olympics, that's what you dream of, that's the ultimate level of accomplish­ment. So I'm blessed to be able to do that." 
And when Riley stood on the gold medal stand with her teammates, listening to the national anthem being played, she 
selected to the team. But when DeLisha Milton-Jones went down with an injury, Riley was asked to join the team. And as a result, she won gold. 
The women defeated Australia for the gold medal by a score of 73-63 on Hiley's 25th birthday in August. Riley aver­aged 3.4 points and 2.4 rebounds in seven games for the United States. 
"It was amazing to be there," Hiley said of her trip to Athens. "[In theI Opening Ceremonies, you're with so many different countries, athletes from all over the world, playing different sports, and you're all there together, competing trying to get the same goal. Being able to 
your flag being 

raised, you're lis­tening to the national anthem and knowing that so many peo­ple back home are supporting what you do, and knowing that you put so much hard work into getting to that point -it's just awesome." 
For Riley, the gold medal is just another accomplishment to add to her laundry list of acco­lades. Riley was named the Most Outstanding Player of the 2001 Final Four, where she scored 46 points and grabbed 20 rebounds to lead the Irish to the championship with wins over Connecticut and Purdue. 
From there, Riley went on to the WNBA's Detroit Shock, where she picked up where she left off. With Notre Dame grad Bill Laimbeer as her coach, she led the Shock to its first-ever WNBA title in 2003, and was named the Most Valuable Player of the Finals. She remains the only_ athlete in Notre Dame his­tory to be named the MVP of both the NCAA tournament and a professional championship. 
In the WNBA, she has been outstanding, much like her tenure at Notre Dame. Hiley averaged 9.6 points and 5.9 rebounds per game in 2003, including her inspirational 27­point performance in last year's title game. 
Riley said that all three of her championships are equally spe­cial to her. 
"It's kind of hard to compare the three because they're so uniquely different," Riley said. "All are just awesome experi­ences for me." 
But regardless of what she has accomplished, Riley main­tains the humble attitude that she had in 2001 when Notre Dame won the national champi­onship. 
''I'm just blessed," she said of her success. ''I've put in a lot of hard work, and I've had a lot of great coaches along the way, good teammates who've helped me and sometimes made me look like a better player then I probably was at that point. But it's just amazing. And I'm just excited about what I've been able to accomplish and hoping to do more in the future." 
And with a NCAA Championship, WNBA Championship and a gold medal under her belt, who knows what Riley will find to win next.

Boxing 
continued from page 24 
Bouts tonight at 7 p.m. in aux­iliary gym 1 of the Joyce Center. 
Modeled after the Bengal Bouts, the Baraka Bouts will raise money for Holy Cross mis­sion schools in Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania. Admission is $2 and T-shirts featuring the Baraka Bouts logo and a quote from Muhammad Ali will be sold for $15. 
"This year is the first year we're actually having a tourna­ment," club president Amanda Borys said. "So we're really excited about it." 
There isn:t a specific dollar amount the club wants to raise but Borys believes a figure around $10,000 would satisfy her. 
"It would be a nice, round number to shoot for," Borys· said. "I think it can be done but it's going to take a lot of hard work and a lot of people coming." 
The club has been around for nine years. However, the women were not allowed to fight in pub­lic until spring 2003 when. a number of club members fought on the under card to the Bengal Bouts. Last fall the club held its first independent event, featur­ing 19 exhibition matches. 
Tonight there will be 11 brack­ets with boxers seeded according to experience and ability. Champions will be crowned in each four-person bracket. 
"The more experienced boxers are obviously seeded higher than some of the less experienced boxers," Kwiatt said. "But pretty much everyone is around the same area of skill level so we should see some good, clean fights." 
The club has been practicing since the first week of school under the assistance of first-year coach Stefan Borovina, a 2004 Notre Dame graduate and two­time Bengal Bout heavyweight champion. Since most of the girls have no boxing experience prior to college, they must rely on Borovina's knowledge and their own skills acquired playing other sports. 
Borys played basketball, vol­leyball and soccer in high school and likes the competitive atmos­phere the boxing club provides for her at Notre Dame. 
"I think that in the club there's people that want to do it for fun, people that want to learn how to box and then there's people that have that really competitive, killer instinct," she said. "I might be one of those people." 
The competitive nature of the sport was one of the draws for Kwiatt, but there were also other aspects that drew her to the club. 
"Probably the best part of box­ing is really getting to know a great bunch of girls who are out to challenge themselves mental­ly, emotionally and physically," she said. "But, at the same time, doing it all for a good cause." 
Senior Melanie Irvine joined the women's boxing club three years ago when a friend of hers was competing in the Bengal Bouts. 
"I saw that there were women involved [in boxing] and I was really interested because it seemed like a unique thing to be doing," she said. "So I went out the next year and loved it so much I never turned back."

Duke 
continued from page 24 
But for the Irish. it wasn't just Battnast. Shn was joined by tlm~e other Irish playnrs in dou­ble-figures. Fresh man ChareI Allen playPd the best game of her young c.aret~r. linishing with 16 points, thrPn assists, three steals, two blocks and three rebounds. Slw was a spark for tlw Irish olT the bench, playing :~2 minutes. Allen also played solid dnftmsn on Dukn's star, Moniqun Currin, limiting her to 14 points on 6-for-1 !J shooting. 
"I thought the story of the gamn was Chand Allen," McGraw said. "To have to guard Monique Currie, who's one of the best players in the country, and..she did an excellent job on her. 
The game started with the Irish being down most of the first half. Duke dominated the ofTnnsive boards, pulling down 14 in just the lirst half. But even without Batteast, the Irish hung in tlwrn, with the help of a solid defensive efl'ort that limited the Blue D1wils to 28 first-half points, while countering with 26 of their own. 
To start the second half, the Irish found themselves down 39­32 with 16:08 to play, the biggnst lnad for either team at that point. Batteast was on the lwnch with three fouls, and McGraw decided to bring her back in, despite the fouls. 

"I thought if the game is going to get out of hand, we need to get her back in there," McGraw said. 
Batteast responded with a steal, a 3-pointer and two assists, and the lead was cut to 44-41 with 13:48 to play. 
Then with eight minutes to play, the senior took over, scor­ing 10 straight to put the Irish up 65-58, and NotJ-n Dame never looked back. 
"I thought down the stretch, we got great shots from Jackie and big rebounds from every­body," McGraw said. 
Notre Dame switched to play a 2-3 zone, and the Duke offense was shut down. The Blue Devils were outrebounded by the Irish 42-39, despite playing no player shorter than 5-foot-10. 
"I was really pleased with our defensive effort overall," McGraw said. "I thought we did a really good job of playing the zone. I think that changed the game. We switched from man to zone, and that broke the game open for us." 
Megan Dully hit <J-for-1 0 from the free throw line, all in the second half, to iee the game, and the Irish defense held strong. 
"I was really pleased with the way we handled ourselves with poise dow11 the stretch," McGraw said. 
Duffy finished with 15 points and seven assists. Also in dou­ble-figures was Courtney La Yore, who scored 13 points and grabbed 11 rebounds. 
For the Blue Devils, Currie was joined in double-figures by Mistie Williams ( 10 points, eight rebounds) and Alison Bales (11 points, seven blocks). 
With the win. Notre Dame advances to the !huLls of the pre­season WNIT, where it will faen No. 10 Ohio State at home Saturday at 7 p.m. 
Notes: 
+ Irish guard Tulyah (;aines was not drossed for Wednesday's game. She sum~red a nnek injury Friday night against Illinois State. McGraw said shn dons not expnet Gaines back until next week.

Allen 
continued from page 24 
With the BluP Devils desperate­ly tryin~ to stop hot-handed Jacqunlirw Battnast in the seeond half, Allen slipped into the enwicns of Duke's zone dnlimsn. Twice Allen knocked down criti­cal 3-pointers that brou~ht the Irish within tlm~n points at the I:~:4X mark of tlw second half and tiedtlw ganw at 9:37. 
"Siw ("amn of age today--shn's no longer a fmshman." Irish coach Mufl(t McGraw said. "She just played a spectacular ganw." 
!\lien finishml with 1(, points, thrne assists. tlm~e reb(·Jtrnds and two stPals in :~2 minutes. When Notrn Damn rw«'dnd a turnover, a basknt or anythin~ in .bntwnnn, Allen snenwd to bP there. 
"Siw killed us." l>uke I wad coarh Gail GonstPnkors said. 
Aside from Allnn 's outstanding play, NotrP Danw won beeause it learnPd quirkly that h~tting the physical Blun I>Pvils do as thny pleasmf wasn't going to work. 
Erwin deddml to do somethin~ about it. Down thrne poinL'i with about 14 minutes Jell. MeGraw put in 

Erwin to give the team a lift. The 
(,-foot-1 sophomorn entangled 
hersolf with the ag).,'Tnssive Williams on several possessions 
bPI'ore finally getting into the 
Blue Dnvil li>rward's face. Even 
though Erwin picked up a ques­
tionable tnehnical f(ml fi>r the c:qnfrontation, she did mueh 
more for the Irish by sparkin~ 
tlw Joyce Center erowd, and her teammates. 
Aller Duke star Monique Currie madn one-of-two free throws, Notre Dame took over the game. Trailing by four at the time, the Irish ended the game with a 35­20 run. 
"I rnally think Crystal Erwin lwlpnd us Ibn aggressive]," MeCraw said. "She gave us ennr­gy and changed the whole tone and ~ave us a positive, upbeat attitude eoming into the game. That was really big." 
Notn~ Dame was a good team last season, but it took them 13 games and a mediocre 7-6 start, to rnalize just how good. This season's squad has shown the ability to not only establish itself as a contender, but as a team to bn fimrnd. The Irish have the tal­ent--that's not a surprise to anyone. But what else they lnarrwd Wednesday is how to play with a swagger. They 
weren't intimidated by the No.6 
team in the nation coming to 
South Bend for an early-season 
matehup. 
When the Blue Dnvils thmw a 
punch, the Irish eame baek with 
a combination. When Duke tried 
to get physical under the glass, 
Notre Dame didn't shy away. And 
when one of the nation's best 
teams --a team with a legitimate 
shot at a national title --wanted 
to rwnble, it was McGraw's 
squad who said "Bring it on." 
The 2004-05 Irish have proved in the bnginning stages of the season that they will be in the national spotlight for thn lon~­haul. This is a team that has all the parts to advanen much far­tlwr than last season's Sweet 16 group did. 
McGraw put it best in the post­
~ame press conference: 
"We're light-years away from 
last year at this point," she said. 
That's scary fi>r anyone in 
Notre Dame's way this season. 
Just ask No. 6 Duke.

Notre DamP knpt itsnll' in thn game just long enough for Jacqueline Battnast to eomn back in tlw game after two early lilllls. Then slw took over, as No. 1 I Notrn Dame knocked olr No. (J Duke 76-65 WedJH~sday night at tho Joycn Center in the semifinals of the presea­son Wonwn's National Invitation Tournament. 
Bat.lnast scored 10 straight points to give the Irish a (J5-5H lead with 4:50 n~maining.

Battnast had only played 10 minutns in the first half dun to foul trouble, and she picked up lwr thin! foul just over two minutes into thn seeond half. llowever, she eame back strong on ollimse. dnspitn the faet that two of her linlls were offensive fouls. "I just tried to be aggressive," Battnast said, who finished with 17 points, seven assists and liw rnbounds. "I know that I had a cou­ple of charges bPfon~. hut the coadws told me to keep taking it. And onen a eouple start­ed falling, I thought it was better if I shot." It was the most physieal game the Irish have played this seasor1, as pressure delimsn was played from start to finish. But Notn~ Danw's 50-point seeond half was too mud1 fi1r Duke. "I thought it was a very hard fought game, and I thought they playnd an (1Xcnptional see­ond half. hit some big shots, some big 3s and just really wore us down," Duke eoaeh Gail Goestnnkors said.

And Notre Dame displayed some intestinal fortitude in its 7(,-65 win against the Bhw Devils in the semifinals of the prnseason Women's National Invitation Tournament that last season's team simply never had. 
A big reason for that change was Allen. The thin guard from Monessen, Pnnn. rarely shows emotion on the rourt. Allen simply does any­thing her team needs, all the while keeping that same stonn-hard, unassuming stare on her face. 
Wednesday evening, Notre Dame fans got to see just how good this rapidly rising star will beeome in an Irish uniform.
