Passing on a tradition 
A Notre Dame student passes on the tradition ofFrisbee throw­ing to a youngster on campus. The we/came appearance ofthe sun yesterday brought many students onto the quads. The abnonnally grecll weather should continuefor the nextfew days, giving more excuses to get awayfrom the books for awhile and enjoy the great outdoors.

Partygoers at the·Beaux Arts Ball will have the chance to "paint the town red" tonight, but they almost lost that chance earlier this week when publicity for the ball included painting the campus red. 
The ball was almost cancelled when publi<;ity measures such as painting sidewalks and covering statues with red plastic were viewed as extreme by the administration, according tojoseph Pitchford, presi­dent of the Notre Dame chapter of the American Institute of Architec­ture. 
Some publicity measures "were too loud, and smacked ofvandalism" in the opinion of the administration, Pitchford said. ' 
Members of the ball committee met with john Goldrick, dean ofstu­dents, earlier this week to discuss the publicity problem, Pitchford said. 
The committee took responsibil­ity for the publicity, he said, al­though it had not sanctioned some of the controversial methods. 
Goldrick could not be reached for comment. 
. The ball will be held tonight in the Architecture Building, and will feature the new wave group "Cause for Passion," whose sound resembles the Human League. 
Pitchford said the event is unique because it is the only party held in an academic building. "It's a chance to open up one of the nicest buildings on campus to the students," he said. 

Pitchford said he hoped the ball would "lead the charge to having fun without alcohol." Problems last year with alcohol being sneaked into the ball resulted in the committee being put on probation, he said. 
This year security will be on hand to insure that the alcohol policy is enforced, he said. 
Tickets can be purchased for $5 in advance and 56 at the door. Pitchford said many tickets will probably be sold today. Capacity ticket sale is 300, he said. 
Proceeds from the ball will be used to pay for special architecture events such as the architecture lecture series and field trips during the year. 


Science requirement will not change from two semesters 
Editor's Note: Last spring the Uni­versity Curriculum Committee released a report outlining several major changes in Notre Dame's core curriculum. But for the most part, the committee left alone the two-semester require­ment in natural science. The issue is examined in the following story, part three ofa four-part se­ries focusing on the committee's report. 
By MARKS. PANKOWSKI 
Copy Editor 
As luck would have it, he landed on green, and while sipping on a Michelob, he was asked to name the common term for acetyl­salicylic acid. 
"C'mon," he groaned. "Is thii Trivial Pursuit or science class?" 
Fortunately, it was just a board game, but more and more educators across the nation are worried that college graduates in non-technical fields are becoming scientifically illiterate. 
Notre Dame is no exception. But after studying the problem for a year, the ad hoc University Curric­ulum Committee decided not to recommend another course in nat­ural science. 
Instead, the proposed natural science requirement, which will be voted on by the Academic Council on Monday, would re­quire two semesters to be com­pleted by the end of the sophomore year. 
The University's present natural science requirement, normally satisfied by students as freshmen, is also two semesters to be com­pleted by the sophomore year. 
What's the difference? 
"Ifthe proposed natural science requirement is approved, it will remove the restraint on students and will give them more freedom in choosing," said Timothy O'Meara, who as provost is chief academic officer at Notre Dame. "At the present, if you do not take the science requirement in your freshman year, you have to take a foreign language." 
The curriculum committee's proposal, according to O'Meara, would allow freshmen the option of taking an elective instead of a natural science or foreign lan­guage. 

Although the committee's report recommends additional re­quirements in other academic fields, such as in the fine arts, it does not recommend additional requirements in science. This 

~urricu~um

~errev1ew 
move has received mixed reviews among faculty and administrators. 
"I was disappointed that there were not any more science re­quirements added," said Rudolph Bottei, professor and assistant chairman of the chemistry depart­ment. "Two semesters of science has been the requirement for ages. There's been an explosion ofscien­tific and technological knowledge, so an additional requirement in science is not asking too much from the student." 
But Morton Fuchs, professor and chairman of the biology and microbiology department, disagreed. 
"Forcing non-science majors to take a second year of science doesn't accomplish much. I think it's important that non-science majors take more (than the two re­quired semesters), but I think it's .;:ounter-productive to stuff it down their throats. 
"I think if you have to force people to take courses above and beyond a certain minimum that they don't want to take, it hurts the learning process," said Fuchs. "If you're not interested in a course you're not going to learn from it." 
But the committee's natural sci­ence recommendation, issued last spring as part of an analysis of the University core curriculum, has been criticized for not going far enough. 
"The world is rapidly changing because of technology," said Mark McCready, a chemical engineering professor. "There are a lot of ethi­cal questions that involve science and many decisions are based on scientific reasoning, but the people making those decisions are politicians and lawyers." 
A quieter issue within the debate focused on one reason the curriculum committee left the sci­ence requirement at two semesters. 
"We are trying to give depart­
ments  and  students  themselves  
more  choice  regarding  what  
would  be  the  most  appropriate  

mix of courses for their educa­tional goals," said George Howard, assistant professor in psychology and a member of the University Curriculum Committee. 
"It is not appropriate for us to decide what should be the average or the best number of science courses but to specify what was the absolute minimum for some­one to have a liberal education," said Howard.

Patients no longer at mercy of doctors when lives on line 
By MICHAEL). CHMIEL 

StaffReporter 
Patients are no longer at the mercy of a decision made by their doctors when their bodies and lives are at stake, said Dr. Edmund Pel­legrino, director of the Kennedy In­stitute of Ethics at Georgetown University. 
Pellegrino gave a lecture yester­day at the Notre Dame Law School on the topic of "Medical Ethics in a Pluralistic Society -The Move from Substantive to Procedural Ethics." 
"Medical ethics today is the one ethical arena that will involve every­one," said Pellegrino. He said three reasons account for the relevance of medical ethics to people today. 
First, he said, the power of medi­cal technology has improved. "It makes a difference what your doctor decides. We are in a golden age of therapeutics. The physician can af­fect your life in its most intimate detail," he said. 

Secondly, he said society in the present is one lacking in moral con­sensus. He said that "pluralism to large degree" exists today, as opposed to the past when people lived in a predominantly Christian society. 
Thirdly, Pellegrino said there is a "democratization of every aspect of human life today." People want a say in decision-making and many dis­trust experts and professionals, he said. 
"I believe that the move is essen­tial and necessary and is keeping with the dignity of the human per­son to participate in the decisions that affect him or her," said Pel­legrino.

Are the Democrats doomed to suffer defeats? 
.,1 
During the months following a Presidential election, it is common for the leaders of the losing party to get together and try to figure out what Went wrong the previous fall. The Democrats, stung by a second consecutive 
Brian McKeon 
reflecting 

whitewash, have recently been trying to "reconstruct" the party in hopes of regaining the White House in 1988. 
This year, with talk ofan emerging Republi· can coaliton and a "changing tide" in Ameri­can politics, the Democrats seem especially nervous. At a recent meeting of House Democrats, Horace Busby, a political analyst who was an aide to PresidentJohnson, warned that the party "is in the eye of a storm ... which is wiping out the base on which many Democrats think they stand." He went on, "I do not believe there is any credible basis to argue that the Democrats are still in a contest for the White House." 
The Democrats are not exactly unified as they plan their course for the future. A num­ber of leading Democratic officials recently set up a leadership conference outside of the Democratic National Committee to influence policy. They feel the party must change course and pull itself away from special inter­est groups. Many top Democrats expressed concern when Paul Kirk was recently elected chairman of the Democratic National Com­mittee. Mr. Kirk is a former aide ofSenator Ed­ward Kennedy and is seen as beholden to labor interests; these Democrats feel Kirk presents the type ofimage the Democrats are trying to get rid of. 
The signs for the Democratic Party are not encouraging. The South, once a stronghold of the Democrats, no longer can be relied upon. The whites in this region hold the key. In last fall's election, only a little more than one­fourth of white Southerners voted for Walter Mondale. The Democrats didn't help their cause by placing two Northern liberals on the ticket. Population shifts also may affect the party. A recent Library of Congress study predicted that ifpopulation trends of the last decade continue after I990, the Northern in­dustrial and farm states could lose up to 19 additional Congressional seats to the South and West, both strongholds of Reagan conser­vatism. Congressional seats determine the number of votes in the Electoral College, which actually elects a President. 
Is the Democratic Party headed for a per­manent decline? Perhaps. The anxiety dis­played by the Democrats, however, seems a bit premature. The doomsayers seem to be ig­noring some important realities. For instance, it is true that the Democrats have lost four out of the last five elections. But we must remem­ber that two ofthese losses were to extremely popular incumbents (Nixon and Reagan). An­other loss came at a low point in our nation's history, with American hostages abroad and inflation at a record high level. The other loss, in 1968, was by the smallest of margins, and came in a year when there was a third-party candidate. 
In addition, the Democrats have yet to lose their appeal below the national level. The Democrats hold a solid majority in the House, have a good chance of recapturing the Senate next year, and hold onto a vast majority of state and local offices. 
One important reason the Republicans have done so well in the past few elections is due to their tremendous organization. This has enabled them to build up large campaign treasuries, while the Democrats were scram­bling to pay off old campaign debts. 
Asecond important reason for the Republi­can success story has been Ronald Reagan himself. Whether you like him or not, Reagan is an incredibly popular figure. Most people who disagree with the man even claim to like him personally. Yet Reagan was unable to con­vert this popularity into any gains in Congress; in fact, the Democrats picked up seats in both houses. 
The Republicans are not invincible. They will most likely experience a tough battle for the nomination in 1988 which will shake party unity. While the Republicans have potentially electable candidates in Robert Dole, Jack Kemp and Howard Baker, no one knows if the man tapped to succeed Reagan will enjoy similar popularity. 
In the gloom surrounding a terrible loss, it is not uncommon for the losers to point fin­gers, to put the blame on this mistake or that fault. The Democrats have done an able job of this in the past few months. While of course adjustments must be made within the party, it is important that the Democrats not get so caught up with change that they become mir­rors to the Republicans, betraying their basic values or ideals. To do so could shatter the party permanently.

ture. Not a single article -not even a photo­graph-appeared on any ofthe 20 pages on this most important occasion. 
Instead, on the most prominent corner of the front page, there was a photograph of a man cleaning up a donkey's droppings. There is something intriguing about The Observer's sense ofhistory.

Can't fool all the people all the time here at ND 
Dear Editor: 

I am very enraged by the events depicted 
on the front and back pages of The Observer 
ofApril II. 

The Bookstore Basketball Tournament rules state that only members of the Notre Dame and Saint Mary's faculties, staffs and stu­dent bodies are eligible to participate in the tournament. Yet in blatant disregard for this regulation, we see on the sports page a picture ofVice President George Bush with a caption describing the play of his team in the tourna­ment. This is incredible! I know for a fact that Bush is not a member of the faculties, staffs or student bodies of the two schools, and he is still allowed to play. I do not care if he is the vice president -that does not make him spe-


Salute to Architecture did not receive coverage 
Dear Editor: 

One of the most extraordinary events to happen on campus this year took place on Tuesday, April 9. Pietro Belluschi, Philip Johnson and John Burgee visited our campus as guests ofthe University's Salute to Architec­ture. Belluschi and Johnson are recipients of the Gold Medal, the highest award given by the American Institute ofArchitects. 
Burgee, a I956 graduate of this University, 
is a partner in one of the most prestigious ar­
chitecture firms in America today. Many ofus 
know Johnson/Burgee as the creators ofCen­
tury Center in South Bend and the new A.T. & 
T. Bldg. in New York. 

These men came to Notre Dame to share· their thoughts on architecture with us. Their experience, intelligence, and the quality of their work make them extremely qualified to do this. The symposium, attended by many, was a rare opportunity for architects to dis­cuss the state of their profession. Later in the afternoon, Fr. Hesburgh conferred honorary doctorate degrees on Belluschi and Johnson, in a ceremony attended by Fr. Joyce and Provost O'Meara. 
In the April I 0 issue of The Observer, no mention was made of the Salute to Architec-
Doonesbury 

cial and he is still subject to the same rules we all are. 
Ifthis action isn't sickening enough, on the front page we see a lame attempt to "cover up" Bush's presence in the tournament by making it seem as if he was elsewhere at the time. On the front page is a picture of some­one who is supposedly Bush while the caption describes the "vice president" throwing out the first ball at a major league baseb;] game. 
Be serious. This photo is obviously some­one masquerading as Bush at the ballgame! This may have fooled the less enlightened crowd at the game, but you cannot put one over on us Someone wishing to enhance his team's chances persuaded the vice president to play on his team. Worried that someone might recognize Bush and report the infrac­tion, the parties responsible sent an unnamed person to masquerade as Bush elsewhere while the basketball game was in progress, so they could pass Bush off as "a guy who just happens to look like the Second-in-Command of the greatest country on the face of the earth." 
I was tipped off to this whole scheme by closely examining the page one picture. There, the imposter so exhaustedfrom his trip to impersonate Bush, mistakenly threw out a basketball at the opening ceremonies. You will see it too if you examine the picture closely. 
I am shocked not only that this sort of thing

Do not prevent the CIA from interviewing here 
Dear Editor: 

Although the CIA's recruiting at colleges may have been protested on many campuses, not all students feel the same way. I for one support the CIA and would like to see Notre Dame graduates in the CIA. It would be an honorary way to serve this country ofours in which too many take its privileges for granted. 
Ifstudents disagree with CIA actions, I feel it would be more effective if they wrote let­ters to their congressmen explaining their opinions. To take their frustrations out on the recruiters is childish, immature and spineless. I have not heard of any students being kid­napped to be (interrogated) interviewed by the CIA. To prevent those who wish to be in­terviewed the chance to interview is oppres­sion. Those students who keep the recruiters from interviewing are resorting to the same supposed oppression that they are protesting.

Special birthday wishes for a special woman 
Rev. Robert 
Griffin 
Letters to a Lonely God 
S
ister Dolorilda, C.S.C., is having a birthday week. On Wednesday, she was 82. It's not polite to men­tion a woman's age, a la'\\'Yer's income or an athlete's grades; but having reached the landmark age of three score and ten which the Bible allows, you should celebrate the bonus years after 70 as though you were being presented with merit badges. 
The older I get, the less coy I am about hiding my age. It takes stamina to survive very long in a tough world. 
Every student who attends Mass at Sacred Heart Church has seen Sister Dolorilda: a small, white­haired lady with a gentle voice and wise eyes, always dressed in a blue veil and wearing the silver locket that identifies the Holy Cross sisters. 
Sister Dolorilda, a recently retired receptionist at Moreau Seminary, now assists Sister Gertrudis and Sister Suzanne in taking care of the liturgies on busy feast days and resides with the two in the Student Health Center. 
I met Sister twenty years ago at the Holy Cross House --I was sick and she was my nurse. Priests, when they are ailing, are as cantankerous as everyone else. Some of us get as scared or nervous as little children. 

In 1965, Sister Dolorilda was the Florence Nightingale who brought us medicine and soothed our pil­lows, along with some of the sweetest-tempered brothers in the world. 
I could see that it must take great faith to care for the boys ofsummer in their ruin, because life saves its dirtiest tricks for the sick room. Some ofthe greatest personalities in Catholic education wasted away to leanness and temper at Holy Cross House. 
"Do not go gentle into that good night," the poet Dylan Thomas urged his father at the checkout counter; "Rage, rage, against the dying of the light." A few ofour Holy Cross priests, devastated phys­ically, have not gone gentle; they raged so much that King Lear on the heath would have been proud of them. 
The peace ofacceptance finally comes to all. They're as meek and mild as lambs going through the valley of the shadow ofdeath. Sister Dolorilda, watching and praying, saw dozens going home to God. There were many evenings when she must have felt tired ofbeing a servant of the sick to the saints, though she was quick to praise them as gentlemen ofthe Cross, and encouraged them with her faith. If forgiveness were ever necessary, she forgave them without being

The new wave band, "Cause for Passion" will provide entertainment as well as a reason to dance. It all starts at 9:30p.m. in the Architecture Building and tickets will be sold in advance for $5 or at the door for S6.

The Friday Night Film Series includes tonight's presentation, Sweet Hours in the Annenburg Auditorium, admission: $2.50. Spain's most important director presents the story ofa gentle, con­templative poet who is obsessed with the past--the war, his family, his sexy maid Gilda and with every boy's dream: his stunningly seductive mother. The film circles around and through Juan's memories in elegant pirouettes. 
conscious of what she was doing as a compassionate sister, incapable of holding a grudge. 
In 1965, as a priest in his prime years, I felt very sorry for myself on the casualty list. I kept getting more and more wounded by stress. Then I broke my arm and later, my leg. I was afraid I would be an invalid forever. Sister Dolorilda helped me through the months ofgloom with her kindness. 
One morning the photographer came, and we were lined up to have our pictures taken. No one had to tell me that the Community wanted an up-to-date mug shot to use on an obituary card. I was beside myself with anger and fear. At age 38, out ofdue season, I was being pro­cessed for burial. I hated being treated as though there were a possibility of my dying. 
On one of the most depressing days of mylife, Sister Dolorilda cheered me up. We were both converts to the Catholic faith and remember the same Gospel hymns. She encouraged me to talk about the songs offaith I love. She left me believing that I still had a future. There's something about "Shall We Gather at the River?" that leaves you with hope, not because it promises heaven, but because it reminds you ofcamp meetings when you were young. 
Many of us in Holy Cross owe debts ofgratitude to Sister Dolorilda. Even the younger mem­bers, whom she served as morale officer at the seminary, have reasons to love her. R.L. Stevenson dedicates "A Child's Garden of Verses" to Allison, his nurse, "From her boy." His dedicatory poem almost works as the speech I could make Sister Dolorilda on her birthday: 
For the long nightsyou lay awake And watchedfor my unworthy 
sake 

Foryour most comfortable band 
That led me through the uneven 
land 

Forall the story booksyou read 
For all thepain you comforted 
Grant it, heaven, that all who 
read 

Mayfind as dear a nurse at need 
But Notre Dame is not a child's 
garden, and I wasn't a boy in 1965, 
and Sister Dolorilda is a professional 
woman who shouldn't be sentimen­
talized as an ex-nanny. 
She didn't enter the religious life until she was 42. You couldn't mistake her for one of the old­fashioned sisters who used to kiss the pastor's hand out of reverence for alter Cbristus. She has the good sense of the convert who was nei­ther startled nor liberated by the changes ofVatican II. 
Converts have the wisdom not to 
be surpised at doing things as Cat­
holics that they were used to doing 
as Protestants. All traditions are full 
ofgrace; and in the worship ofGod, 
there is nothing new under the sun. 
I'm amused at how much of the old 
luggage gets thrown overboard by 
old timers frantic to be liberal and 
modern. 
Sister Dolorilda's style ofreligion 
seems timeless as a faith for all 
seasons ofher life. She knows Christ 
wisely; and He's the same yesterday, 
today and forever. Christians need 
to be tolerant with their God, and 
patient with the Church.

heart about Sister Dolorilda. She doesn't talk about herself, and I can't be sure how well I know her. It surprises me to realize I only know her by her religious name. I've never heard her family name or the name she was given at birth. I wouldn't want to embarrass her. She may not want her name in the paper. I just want to let her know in a special way that I admire and love her. She is a representative ofthe Holy Cross nuns who have had essential roles at Notre Dame since the time ofSorin. I'm sending them this thank you note in Sister Dolorilda's birthday week. 
She said to me yesterday: "I'm waiting for Halley's comet to come back. It will be visible to us soon. I saw it with my father in 1910. He said: 'When it comes back again, you'll be an old lady.'" 
The earth has spun around a few times since 1910. Sister Dolorilda 
·has lived through difficult decades 
ofa turbulent century. Nowadays, 
Halley's comet is not the sign in the 
sky that we're waiting for with 
dread. It was a long time ago that 
she lived on a farm in Michigan, 
making bread in her mother's 
kitchen. She grew up in the years 
before the country lost its in­
nocence. I would loved to have 
known Dolorilda as a young woman 
from America's heartland. 
Halley's comet may make as many curtain calls as a vaudeville star. I hope there will always be Holy cross sisters like Dolorilda to get excited at something that has the appearance ofa fallen star. The constellations stay fixed in the firmament to declare the glory of God like a choir. They are not more faithful than the American women ofthe Catholic Church.

This spring, many changes are beingconsidered for the 1985 Notre Dame football squad in regards to as­signments for players on the field. 
Many of these changes are being made in order fill vacancies created through the graduation of senior starters from this past year's squad. 
On offense, a big gap that is being looked at is the tight-end spot for­merly filled by graduating senior Mark Bavaro. In order to provide depth an increase the competition at the position, sophomore Tom Reh­der has been moved from a back-up role as a defensive tackle to tight· end. 
"The Rehder switch was a very important move because we're looking for a specific person to fill that void due to the graduation of Mark Bavaro," explains offensive co­ordinator Mike Stock. "Tom's adjust­ment has been good for him and for us. Right now, he's working very hard, and each day, he's getting a little bit better. The competition that he's had with himself to learn the position has been very good, and the competition that he's had with Joel Williams ha.~ madeJoel Williams better, and that, I think, can make the team a lot sounder down the road." 
As an incoming freshman, the 6-7,. 251-pound Rehder was recruited as a tight end. Last season, however, he was switched to a back-up role at de­fensive tackle. This coming season, the Santa Maria, Ca., native will look to compete for the starting tight-end spot. 
"I'm excited about moving back," said Rehder. "I played it in high

school and in my freshman year here. Playing is the goal · I.want to play, and if the coach feels that we have a surplus on the defensive line, then my chancesare much greater at a position where we are weak." 
On the offensive line, there will be a shift in the duties of junior Ron Plantz. Plantz, who was listed as a guard and quick tackle last year will make a permanent move to the cen­ter spot on the line. 
A vacancy at center was created by the graduation of all-American Mike Kelley. With Plantz listed at 6­4, 271-pounds, Stock is confident that he will step in and do a more than adequate job. 
In the offensive backfield, receivers Milt Jackson and Tim Brown have switched assignments. Entering his senior year,Jackson will move out to the split end while the freshman Brown will move to flanker. 
Both receivers are happy with their new assignments. Brown is pleased becasue he will be in motion

"DePaul is considerably weaker than the Big 10 schools," admits Fal­lon. "We haven't had much trouble with them in the past. However, their coach, George Lott, is a very astute coach, and it is a long-time rivalry, so we'll have to play well. 
"Western Michigan, on the other hand, is one of the favorites in the Mid-America Conference," Fallon continues. "We expect them to be very tough. Most of their players are pretty highly ranked, and their No. 1 doubles team was ranked in the top t1ve in the country earlier in the year."

the Midwest so far this year," says O'Leary of the 2-6 Scots. "They've scored a lot ofgoals this season ( 111 in eight games), but they've also given up a lot ( 108). I think they'll be pretty dose to the level of Lake Forest (a 9-2loser to the Irish earlier this year)." 
Attackman Bob Trocchi played a major role (four goals, one assist) in last year's Notre Dame win, and he should do the same this year. The senior has 39 points ( 24 goals, 15 as­sists) this year to lead the team in scoring, giving him 123 for his career. If he picks up three points against the Scots, he will move into first place on the all-time Irish scoring list, passing Steve Pearsall's total of 12 5.

The 14th annual Bookstore Bas· kctball Tournament completed its third day with 40 teams advancing to the second round, while 40 others must wait until next year. 
Red Barons proved itself as one of the teams to beat as it shot down In­dira Gandhi and 4 Guys Who Can Shoot by a 21-10 score. Marty Roddy employed a deadly hook shot and a strong inside game to make I 1-of-16 from the floor. Varsity basketball player Casey Newell only hit on four of ten shots, but Tom Antonini and John Stein each sank three hoops to contribute to the victory. 
Still Virtually Unknown made a name for itself in easily handling Pits by a 21· 7 score. Jim Reed poured in six ha~kets, while Dave Machtolf and Mike Za~ke each added five for the winners. 
Shysters, another seeded team, out-fought '11le Bully Bunch by the score of 2 1-1 5. Tom Lange popped in nine shots on only 14 attempts, while David Corrigan added seven

Red Barons take first-round Bookstore game convincingly 
Men's tennis team looks to rebound today vs. DePaul 
By MARlY BURNS 
Sports Writer 
'11lc Big I 0, that ancient con­glomerate ofbig midwestern univer· sities, ha~ been nothing but big trouble this season for the Notre Dame men's tennis team. Wednes­day afternoon at Ann Arbor, Mic­higan, the Irish suffered their third straight defeat to competition from the Big I 0, as Michigan cruised to an easy 9-0 victory. Prior to the Mic­higan match, the Irish had fallen to Indiana, 5-2, and then to Ohio State, who drubbed the Irish by an 8-1 margin. 
Irish coach Tom Fallon and his 14­9 tennis squad can now take big con­solation in the fact that they will play two teams that are not members of the Big I 0. The Irish will play host to DePaul this afternoon at 3 p.m., before traveling to Western Mic­higan on Sunday for their match against the Broncos. 
Although both DePaul and West· ern Michigan are capable of giving the Irish a tough time, they do not figure to play as well as did Michigan on Wednesday. The Wolverines simply tore into the Irish, drawing blood immediately on Notre Dame's No. I singles player, Joe Nelligan. The junior captain tried to rebound from his 6-3 loss in the first set, but he did not have enough to tame his opponent, Jim Sharton, as he went down 6-3, 6-2. No. 2 singles player Mike Gibbons then tried to rally the Irish, but he fell short also, 7-5, 6-2. 
After those losses, Fallon was dis­appointed, but not upset with his two players. 
"Michigan's Jim Sharton is prob­ably the number-one player in the Big I 0 right now," says Fallon. "Also, Gibbon's opponent played very well. They were just too tough for us." 
When the Michigan contest was all over, the Irish had lost all six 


Lacrosse team takes on MLA rival Wooster 
By MIKE SULLIVAN 
Sports Writer 
lbe Notre Dame lacrosse team will try to extend its Midwest Lacrosse Association record to 4-0 tomorrow when it travels to Wooster, Ohio, to take on the Fight­ing Scots of the College of Wooster. 
'Inc contest will mark the begin­ning of a tough MLA road schedule for the Irish who also must play away games with Denison, Michigan State and Ohio State. Because Rich O'Leary's squad has a poor 1-5 record on the road this season, the team's chances of repeating as con· ference champions could hinge on its ability to win away from Cartier Field. 
"The fact that we're playing on the road makes this game very impor­tant," says O'Leary, who is hoping his team can win its I Oth straight MLA game tomorrow. "We haven't won yet on the road in the Midwest, so we need to show that we can do 
it." 
In order to win, though, Notre Dame will have to beat Wooster on the same field where the Scots han­dled the Irish, 22-16, two years ago. In that game, Notre Dame could not keep Wooster's offense from wiping out a four-goal Irish lead. 
The high-scoring Scots also will have revenge on their minds after dropping an I 1-6 game to Notre Dame at Cartier last year. 

"More than likely, Wooster will be the toughest team we've played in

they were clobbered by Tofu Vegetables I by another 21-4 score. Bill Zadell and Matt Hanley eAch connected on six shots to lead Tofu Vegetables I to a fine 21-of·.:U shoot­ing performance. Tofu Vegetables I also displayed a fine defense, as it held its opponents to only 16 shots. 
Next Thursday's second round game between Tofu Vegetabales I and 2 Ionic, 2 Doric, and l Early Corinthian has shaped into one of the top second round games, as each team was impressive in their big vic· tories yesterday.

Ideal weather conditions, with warm temperatures and no wind, prevailed throughout the after­noon's games. lbe fine weather con­tributed to several fine shooting performances. 
Steve Nicgorski of Let's Go Crazy did just that and poured in 14 bas· kets on only 20 shots. His 14 points tied for the high of the day, and en· abled his team to easily defeat Bink by a 21·10 score. 
Pee Wee and the Wee Bees flew high in beating Big Dan and the Eight Balls 21-3. George Hardart shot 8-of­1 0 while Dave Adams added seven to lead the victors' 21-of-34 shoot­ing.

singles matches, and all three doubles matches. In one of those doubles matches, Notre Dame's No. 2 doubles team of David Obert and Tom Grier made a valiant effort to ruin Michigan's shutout hopes, but they eventually gave way 6-7,6-3, 6­2. 
Fallon, needless to say, was anx­ious to get away from the Big l 0 for awhile. 
"The Big 1 0 is very tough this year," notes the 29th-year Irish men­tor. "Michigan is one of the five teams that could win the confer· ence. They were simply too good for us. The guys played pretty well, but it was just a combination of our lack ot experience, and the fact that the Big 10 is too tough." 

The Irish will not have to worry about the Big 10 for a couple of games, but the problem with the lack ofexperience is one that, unfor­tunately, cannot be dodged through the schedule. Two freshmen, Dan Walsh and Paul Daggs, have been called on by Fallon to play key roles for this year's squad, and No. 5 singles player Tom Grier, although a sophomore, is playing for the first year on the squad, after playing on the B-team last year. 
"Ourproblem seems to be that we have a lot of new faces on the squad," says Fallon. "We're getting experience the hard way. I do think that we're improving with each game though. We're making mistakes but we're learning from them." 
Fallon hopes that the Irish learned well from their competent foes from the Big I 0, as they may need every· thing possible to get by a talented Western Michigan team. But before the Irish can worry about that match with the Broncos, they must put away Catholic-rival DePaul. Looking ahead to these two matches, Fallon seems confident, especially con· cerning the DePaul contest.

Baseball team gets timely hitting, solid relief in doubleheader sweep 
By CHUCK FREEBY 
Sports writer 

At times this year, the Irish baseball team has had timely hitting. At times, the Irish have had fine relief pitching. Yesterday, the Irish finally had both those ingredients at the same time and turned it into a doubleheader sweep of visiting Bethel, 9-6 and 8-5, at Jake Kline Field. 
The bullpen was the key for the 9-1 5-1 Irish, as Jason Schomer and Steve Powell each came in early to record their first wins of the year. In the opener, Schomer had some rough going relieving starter Mark Watzke in the fourth. However, the senior fireman settled down after that inning, giving up only three singles the rest of the way. In the nightcap, Powell pitched 3-1/3 innings of shutout relief, until the Pilots notched three runs in the seventh. 
Irish skipper Larry Gallo was pleased with his bul· !pen's performance. "The kids came in and threw strikes, and that's what got the job done." 
While the bullpen held thing.<> in check, the Irish bats rallied for come-from-behind efforts in both games. In game one, the Irish took control with four runs in the fifth, two scoring on Mike Doming's bases-loaded double. Mike Trudeau also contributed to the Irish cause with three RBI. 
In game two, the Irish also benefitted from a four-
run outburst, this one coming in the third. Ifwalking 
is good for the heart, the Irish should be extremely 
healthy now, as four bases on balls helped the inning 
along, two of them coming with the bases loaded. 
Tom Shields and Mike McNeill each drove in a pair of 
runs, as four Irish players collected two hits. 
"We've had difficulty scoring runs at times this year," commented Gallo. "We've been getting men on base, and today we got the key hits. We got a good effort from people like Tom Shields who had sore shoulder and Jackie Moran who was sick as a dog, but still played. That's the kind of leadership we've been looking for." 
Notre Dame now prepares for its first Midwestern City Conference action this weekend, when the defending North division champion Xavier Mus­keteers come toJake Kline Field for twinbills on Sat· urday and Sunday beginning at noon. Gallo Is well aware of the task ahead for his club. 
"This weekend is a key for us this year," remarks the Irish mentor. "Xavier likes to run a lot, and has a veteran ball team. We're going to have to get some good outings from our staff, and keep the bats going." 
Probable starters for the Irish will be Buster Lopes (2-3, 7.36 ERA) and Kevin Chenail ( 1-0, 0.75 ERA) on Saturday. On Sunday, Brad Cross (0-3, 8.14 ERA) andJoe Dobosh (0-3, 8.21 ERA) should get the nod.
