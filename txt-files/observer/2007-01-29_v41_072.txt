Basketball ticket sales, crowds strong 
By EMMA DRISCOLL 
News Wrirer 
Last year's change to the Notre Dame's men's basketball student tick­eting policy may have helped keep this year's ticket sales strong and the crowd enthusiastic, said Director of Ticket Operations Josh Berlo. 
"I would say our ticket sales are pretty similar compared to the last couple years," Berlo said on Jan. 22, noting that while sales haven't signfi­cantly increased, crowd energy has. 
The policy for student tickets was altered last year to allow students to "share booklets," Berlo said, a change that has boosted consistent student attendance. 

This change was made "due to the fact that we had sold out our student tickets a couple years in a row and found that there were more students who wanted to attend," Berlo said. 
Due to the number of games on the men's basketball schedule, Berlo said, students were not always able to attend every game. The ticket poli­cy change was made to "make it so as many students as possible could attend [the games]," he said. 
The basketball team currently has a 17-game winning streak at home, something Berlo said probably also encourages attendance -which, in turn, helps the team. 
"The crowds this year have been great. They've been into the game,

Students travel to D.C. for war protest 
Justice coalition. 
Junior Mike McCann said he was "a little hesitant at first" in deciding to go on the trip, not wanting "to go to something that was antago­nistic." But he said the protest didn't have that kind of spirit. 
"[It was] a message of peace and bringing home the troops ... There were people of a lot of different ages and a lot of different back­grounds. It wasn't just a bunch of hippie college kids -it was people in wheel­chairs, moms pushing kids in strollers, older couples and young kids," McCann said. 
Angulo said several pro­testers from other countries, including Iraq and England, were present.

Notre Dame students returned to campus Sunday after joining tens of thou­sands in Washington, D.C. to protest the Iraq war and other policies of the Bush administration. Saturday's protest marked a "turning point in the anti-war move­ment," said Michael Angulo, vice-president of Notre Dame's Progressive Student Alliance. 
"I think that everyone had a really good time and I think that the protest in general was a really good thing," he said 
Angulo organized the group of 30 students to drive to Washington on Friday for the protest, a function sponsored by the United for Peace and

Com_puter sparks fire in Siegfried 
Dorm incurs minor damage, no injuries 
By MARCELA BERRIOS 
News Writer 
Siegfried Hall was evacuated early Saturday morning when sophomore Dan Zimmerman's computer went up in flames, causing minor damage but leaving residents stranded out­side for almost an hour. 
Zimmerman was not in the room when his computer's bat­tery overheated and exploded, creating two-and-a-half to three-foot-high flames, Siegfried assistant rector Peter Lively said. 
A handful of Zimmerman's neighbors -including sopho­mores Tomas Castillo, Mike Hawking and Robbie Bernardin -smelled the smoke, immedi­ately unplugged the computer and opened the windows to vent the room. 
When the laptop ignited, they notified resident assistant Anh Nguyen and Lively, who grabbed a fire extinguisher and smothered the flames before the Notre Dame Fire Department and Notre Dame Security/Police (NDSP) arrived. 
Lively said Friday's fire was the most potentially destructive fire he has seen in his seven years at Notre Dame and Siegfried Hall. 
Residents became aware of the flames at approximately 
1:10 a.m., and NDSP and the firefighters arrived shortly

INSIDE COLUMN 
Looking good, ND 
After spending my Sunday immersed in writings of genocide, ancient trade and fine art for this week's classes, I've decided to devote this column to some­thing vastly more superficial for my own sanity and for your guilt-free Steve Kerins reading pleasure. 
While I was 
News Wire 
studying this after­
Editor
noon, I often glanced up at friends, classmates and strangers as they walked past my booth in LaFortune. As the hours passed, one thought kept popping into my head: 
"You're looking good lately, Notre Dame." Before I write further, let me be clear: I'm well aware that I'm no fashionista. 
Naturally, I like to look good when the weather is fine. True to my preppy roots, I value a golden fake-and-bake, double-popped pastels and liberal application of greasy hair products. But I recognize that in South Bend, there comes a point in January where even the best of us are tempted to leave suede jackets at home in favor of a much warmer North Face. 
Yet today, I witnessed something bold, something beautiful, and I'd like to raise my figurative glass to those of you who went above and beyond. It's 10 degrees outside, and you're still looking fine. 
It could be that those New Year's res­olutions to spend some time at Rolfs or cut back on late night LaFun runs are starting to show. Or maybe Santa splurged on some high-end Christmas clothing. Sometimes it only takes a mis­chievous grin at a friend across the room or a sultry glance up from your homework for your peers to take notice. 
In three-and-a-half years at Notre Dame, I've learned two key lessons the hard way. 
First, relentless cold, snow and the unyielding permacloud can make win­ter a depressing time in South Bend. 
Second, despite its numerous and varied positive attributes, our University can heap a hearty helping of Catholic guilt on the unwary. My philos­ophy, for what little it's worth, is that from time to time, it's okay to be super­ficial. 
I applaud our dedicated administra­tors, our talented faculty and many of our selfless and humble peers for their devotion to integrity, ethics and social justice. But I find that if I don't indulge in some quality self-absorption on a regular basis, their admonitions start to wear off for lack of behavior I can be ashamed of. 
So please, go ahead. Hike over to FunTan and start working on that bikini body. Spend some extra time on those abs so you can impress the ladies with more than your ability to shotgun beers. Throw pragmatism and grandma's birthday money to the wind, head to the mall and buy yourself those new shoes you've been greedily eyeballing. You know you deserve them. 
In fact, I might see you there, because I'm going to buy a pair myself. In the immortal words of Bobby Brown, it's my prerogative. 
Keep up the good work, Notre Dame, because you're starting to impress me ... right down to the surface.

Stolen Bigfoot statue found without feet 
FEDERAL WAY, Wash. ­An imposing, wood-carved Bigfoot statue stolen from outside a doctor's office has been recovered -minus its big feet. 
An anonymous tip led police to the 400-pound sculpture beneath a pile of debris in a backyard about a block from where it was snatched Monday. Two people confessed and could face theft charges. 
The likeness of the leg­endary ape-like creature of the Northwest used to stand 8 feet high, but its 16-inch-long feet had been sawed off at the ankles, leaving it 18 inches shorter. 
''I'm glad we got him before they cut him anymore," said chiropractor Tom Payne, who had the statue made 5 1/2 years ago and planted at the foot of his secluded driveway as a landmark for patients. 
Dog reunites with family after six years 
ST. LOUIS -Cujo was a frisky 7 -year-old when he sneaked out of' his owners' south St. Louis yard in July 2000. Now, thinner and gray­er and with a tale that would be fascinating if only he could tell it, the golden retriever is back with the Barczewski 
family. 

"It's a miracle," Noreen Barczewski, 41, said at Friday's reunion. "We found 
him!" 

Six years and a side trip to Columbia can do a lot to a dog, but it was unmistakably Cujo. 
After slipping away from home, Cujo somehow ended up 120 miles in Columbia in the home of an elderly woman. When the woman entered a nursing home, the dog was sent to the Central Missouri Humane Society in Columbia.

Professor looks at political stability 
By JACKIE MULLEN 
News Writer 
Professor Cecilia Martinez­Gallardo of the Centro de Investigaci6n y Docencia Econ6micas (CIDE) in Mexico spoke about the cor­relation between the average expected tenure of a cabinet member in 12 Latin American countries and the stability of that mem­ber's government in a lec­ture Thursday in the Hesburgh Center. 
Martinez-Gallardo said many presidents restructure cabinets in order to over­come congressional con­straints, and that the action is most typical of presidents with a weak political basis. 
She said cabinet appoint­ments supply a president with "flexibility in impend­ing crises" and allows them to "avoid deadlock." 
"Under certain circum­stances, presidents will find appointments the best strat­egy to move policy," she said. 
The equilibrium of a coun­try's government, so far as the cabinet influences the larger regime, is affected by the ability of the president to change the cabinet, the ability to use appointments to deal with problems and the constitutionally-imposed constraints on the president, such as formal censure power, she said. 



Based on her research, Martinez-Gallardo concluded that, counterintuitively, the presence of formal legisla­tive censure power increases the possibility of removing a cabinet member by 200 per­cent, compared to presiden­tial systems where the con­appointments to influence public conception regarding the effectiveness of the gov­ernment, and also as a scare tactic directed toward other members of the cabinet.

Business club holds All-Council meeting 
ByJENNMETZ News Writer 
The Student International Business Council will hold its All-Council meeting this Tuesday at 7 p.m. in the Mendoza College of Business' Jordan Auditorium, gathering students of all majors to hear board members speak about career and internship opportunities the club can pro­vide. 
Marketing director sophomore Megan Marsh said the club gives students the ability to gain hands-on experience with real­world companies. 
"It's a great club people aren't aware of," she said. "We send people around the world on internships and to work with major corporations." 
The club, which has been on campus since 1989, has worked with companies like Nintendo, Credit Suisse and Discover Card in the past. 
Marsh said she hopes the meeting will allow more stu­dents to get involved with SIBC. 
"We're really not that new," she said. "People just haven't heard of us. 
The club's goal is "to empower students through the ethical advancement of international commerce by developing leader­ship, entrepreneurial ability, practical management skills and global interaction," according to the SIBC mission statement. 
It focuses on areas including business, consulting, accounting, financ.e, global development, human resources, internship opportunities and marketing. Within these categories, mem­bers can participate in projects, which vary depending on the area of interest. 
"We learn presentation skills, gain contacts, learn communica­tion skills and are presented with leadership positions to become more involved," Marsh said. 
Marsh said the club has links to approximately 20 internation­al summer internships and an alumni network called the International Business Council. This network offers mentoring and networking events. 
Part of the club's vision is to work for peace through com­merce, said both Marsh and SIBC president Kevin Rauseo. 
"We as a council strive to make a difference in the world and ultimately achieve peace within it, through commerce," he said. 
Upcoming events this semester include a spring forum with speakers from the international business world and round table dinners for a smaller, more social setting to discuss projects and ideas.

"While some would have you believe that the reason we're running these deficits is because of the war on terror­ism and incremental homeland security costs, that's just not factually accurate," he said. 
While the country accrued more than $450 billion in arrears last year, approximate­ly $100 billion were related to Iraq and Afghanistan, he said. 
The rest of the bill belonged Americans, but 

Walker said the fiscal crisis demanded drastic measures. 
"Tough choices are required," he said. "We will not be able to grow our way out of this problem." 
In response to the growing problem, Walker and the GAO launched the "Fiscal Wake-Up Tour," a series of nationwide forums to discuss the federal government's deficit and the challenges posed by existing fiscal trends. 
They've already visited sev­eral universities, including 
Ohio  State  University,  
University  of  Chicago,  
University  of  Colorado,  
University  of  Missouri,  

University of Nebraska and Duke University, according to the GAO Web site. 
Walker said it was important to awaken in young people the desire to serve their country, and he offered the students in Jordan personal advice, telling them to give two years of their lives to public 
responsibility of 
"making America great again." 
He also favored increasing the transparency and com­pleteness of the President's budget proposals and tax 
expenditures  to  return  to  
America its glory  - from  an  
accountant's perspective.  

That would deter uninhibited credit expenditures that "ungenerously grow upon prosperity the burden that [leaders today] ought to bear," he said. 
The taxpayers, he said, have failed to carry the load. 
Walker said $365 billion had been lost at the close of 2006 as result of the taxpayers' fail­ure to meet their obligations, excessive deductions and other tax-related violations. 
The GAO's reform proposals called for an expansion of the tax bases and a simultaneous conservation of rates that will stimulate further economic growth. 
Walker also scrutinized the intersection of taxation proce­dures and health care. 
"The single largest tax pref­erence in the code is still health insurance," he said in reference to the exemption of an employer's health insur­ance costs on the employee's return. 
He said this practice further disconnects the taxpayer from bearing the burden of his or her own health care, returning to his argument in favor of increased individual contribu­tions to the relief of America's deficit. 
"We will ultimately rise to the challenge," Walker said. "We just need to do it sooner rather than later."

Cardinal: Vatican should resist China 
VATICAN CITY -Hong Kong's outspoken car­dinal Joseph Zen said it was time for the Vatican to take a more uncompromising line toward the Chinese government, which broke with the Church more than 50 years ago and has sought to maintain control of Catholic institutions. 
The Vatican has long indicated that it wants to establish diplomatic relations with Beijing, even at the cost of moving its embassy from Taiwan. Currently, worship is only allowed in govern­ment-controlled churches, but as many as 10 million Catholics are estimated to belong to unofficial congregations loyal to Rome. 
The last months have seen a series of arrests of priests in China, according to Asia News, a Vatican-affiliated news agency. At least 17 underground bishops have disappeared, been arrested or detained in isolation. Twenty priests have been arrested and at least five, detained on Dec. 27 in Hebei, are still in prison, the agency reported last week. 
Irish accept Protestant police force 
DUBLIN, Ireland-Sinn Fein members over­whelmingly voted Sunday to begin cooperating with the Northern Ireland police, a long­unthinkable commitment that could spur the return of a Catholic-Protestant administration for the British territory. 
The result -confirmed by a sea of raised hands but no formally recorded vote -meant Sinn Fein, once a hard-left party committed to a socialist revolution, has abandoned its decades­old hostility to law and order. 
It strongly improved the chances of reviving power-sharing, the long-elusive goal of the 1998 Good Friday peace pact, by Britain's deadline of March 26. 
Nearly all speakers said they were voting to dump their party's anti-police position for the sake of peace.

WASHINGTON-In an action branded a back­door draft by some critics, the military over the past several years has held tens of thousand of soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines on the job and in war zones beyond their retirement dates or enlistment length. 
It is a widely disliked practice that the Pentagon, under new Defense Secretary Robert Gates, is trying to figure out how to cut back on. Gates has ordered that the practice -known as "stop loss"-must "be minimized." At the same time, he is looking for ways to decrease the hardship for troops and their families, recruit more people for a larger military and reassess how the active duty and reserves are used. 
"It's long overdue," said Jules Lobel, vice presi­dent of the Center for Constitutional Rights and lawyer for some in the military who have chal­lenged the policy in court. 
Prince Charles visits Harlem youth 
NEW YORK -Prince Charles and his wife Camilla visited Harlem Sunday, making a stop at a charter school where they answered children's questions and the prince took some time to shoot hoops with a basketball team. 
The Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall arrived in New York from Philadelphia by a private train and visited Harlem Children's Zone, which runs the Promise Academy and a range of social services for Harlem. The royal couple are on a weekend visit to the United States that focuses on youth development.

Fewer meth labs found in Indiana 
INDIANAPOLIS-Changes in Indiana law restricting access to cold medicines and the way farmers handle chemicals have led to a decrease in the number of methamphetamine labs found in the state, according to the Indiana State Police. 
As the highly addictive drug spread into Indiana in the late 1990s, meth-lab discoveries went from something rare to something all too common. 
But the number of labs busted is declining. In 2004, police in Indiana found 1,549 labs. The number of clandestine labs declined in 2005 to 1,303 around the state, with 989 found by State Police. 
Biden: Weak support for Bush 
Committee chair estimates twenty Senators agree with President's Iraq plan 
Associated Press 

WASHINGTON -The Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman on Sunday dismissed criticism a resolution opposing a troop buildup in Iraq would embolden the enemy and estimated perhaps only 20 senators believe President Bush "is headed in the right direction." 
"It's not the American peo­ple or the U.S. Congress who are emboldening the enemy," said Biden, D-Del., and White House hopeful in 2008. "It's the failed policy of this president -going to war without a strategy, going to war prematurely." 
The Senate's top Republican, Mitch McConnell, cast doubt that a clear majority would be able to coalesce behind one of the many competing resolutions on Iraq. ''I'm not certain any" will get the necessary votes, he said. 
The Democratic-controlled Senate plans to begin debate this week on a nonbinding resolution declaring that Bush's proposal to send 21,500 more troops to Baghdad and Anbar province is "not in the national interest."

SAG honors actors in ceremony 
Associated Press 
LOS ANGELES -Helen Mirren of "The Queen" and Forest Whitaker of "The Last King of Scotland" won Screen Actors Guild Awards on Sunday as best lead players, their latest prizes on the road to the Academy Awards. 
The road-trip romp "Little Miss Sunshine" won the prize for best film ensemble, the guild's equivalent of a best­picture award. 
Solidifying their positions as Oscar favorites, Mirren won for playing British monarch Elizabeth II and Whitaker for starring as Ugandan dictator Idi Amin. 
Eddie Murphy and Jennifer Hudson won supporting-acting honors as soulful singers in "Dreamgirls," reinforcing their status as Oscar front­runners as well. 
The best-picture Oscar race, though, remains wide open, with "The Queen" and "Little Miss Sunshine" up against three sprawling dramas, "The Departed," "Babel" and "Letters From Iwo Jima." 
Mirren said she initially was dismayed at the prospect of donning Elizabeth II's conser­vative wardrobe, including sensible shoes and tweed skirts. 
"I thought, I can't play any­one who chooses to wear those clothes. I just can't do it," said Mirren, who also won the guild honor for best actress in a miniseries as the current monarch's namesake in "Elizabeth I." 
"But I learned to love the person who chooses to wear those clothes, because I

"Because of you, I was able to work and learn from the best. Yes, you are the best," said Hudson, who added thanks to the actors guild. "Just thank you for noticing little old me and accepting me."

IN BRIEF 
Intel tech taraets developina world 
DAVOS, Switzerland -New technoTogies are ready to be used to advance health care, while a plan to bring computers and fast Internet access to the developing world is being undertaken, Craig Barrett, the chairman of Intel Corp. said in an interview Saturday. 
In the spirit of the World Economic Forum's annual meeting, which has focused on bringing the fruits of technology to the developing world, he said a recent trek to countries like Egypt, Chile, Peru, South Africa and China, among others, showed that there is a need for cheap access to computers and the Internet. 
"It's a little bit like the education initiatives," said Barrett, who chairs the U.N. Global Alliance for ICT and Development. "Education is the key." 
Part of that effort, at least for Intel, is the deployment of programs focused on improving education and speeding up the availability of cheap access to computers and the Internet. 
The company has said it plans to train some 4.7 million teachers by 2011 in China, India, Egypt, Latin America, Saudi Arabia and South Africa, through its Intel Teach program. 
Intel also plans to donate more than 36,000 computers with Internet connectivity to Brazil, Chile, China, India and South Africa. 
YouTube will share revenue with users 
DAVOS, Switzerland -Chad Hurley, co­founder of YouTube, said Saturday that his wildly successful site will start sharing rev­enue with its millions of users. 
Hurley said one of the major proposed innovations is a way to allow users to be paid for content. YouTube, which was sold to Google for $1.65 billion in November, has become an Internet phenomenon since it began to catch on in late 2005. Some 70 mil­lion videos are viewed on the site each day. 
"We are getting an audience large enough where we have an opportunity to support creativity, to foster creativity through shar­ing revenue with our users," Hurley said. "So in the coming months we are going to be opening that up." 
Hurley, who at 30 is one of the youngest Internet multimillionaires, gave no details of how much users might receive, or what mechanism would be used.

DAVOS -The United

Saturday to liberalize global

"I think it is now more

Palestinian factions urged to talk 
Associated Press 
GAZA CITY -Saudi Arabia's king urged Palestinian rival fac­tions Sunday to hold talks in the holy city of Mecca as fighting between the Hamas and Fatah movements persisted in Gaza with no clear winner emerging. 
Early Monday, Hamas fighters mobilized around the main Fatah stronghold, the Preventive Security headquar­ters, and threatened to attack. Information Minister Youssef Rizka of Hamas warned the two sides were close to civil war and called President Mahmoud Abbas of Fatah to order his forces back to their bases. 
The bitter rivals have been buying, smuggling and building weapons for months trying to gain an edge, but they have held back from all-out battle and find themselves in a stalemate. 
That leaves many Palestinians with grim hopes that a power­sharing deal still can be worked out between the Islamic mili­tants of Hamas and the more moderate Abbas of Fatah. 
Saudi King Abdullah called the factional fighting a "shame" that has undermined the Palestinian cause and urged both sides to join talks mediated by his country, Saudi Arabia's official news agency reported. 
"I urge them to hold an emer­gency meeting in Mecca to dis­cuss the contentious matters without any intervention from outside," Abdullah told the

Experts expect the pattern to continue. "They are equal par­ties," analyst Nasser AI Lahham said. "No one can cancel the other out." 
Thirty Palestinians, including two children, have died during the latest outburst of street fighting that began Thursday, 
Several kid­

Hot spots in the fighting include the headquarters of Abbas' security forces, Hamas­run mosques and the homes and offices of leaders from both sides, where guards hunker down behind concrete barriers and piles of sandbags. 
Traffic jams are getting worse by the day in Gaza City's already crowded streets because more and more roads are being closed to motorists by the rival security forces. 
Tourism_ jeopardizes future of national park 
Associated Press 
YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK, Calif. -The plunging waterfalls and soaring crags chiseled by the Merced River draw millions of visitors each year, but the crowds are pre­cisely what threatens the waterway and the park. 
Efforts to safeguard the Merced have spawned a court battle over the future of devel­opment in Yosemite National Park's most popular stretch. The case may come down to the challenge facing all of America's parks: Should they remain open to everyone, or should access be limited in the interest of protecting them? 
In November, a federal judge barred crews from fin­ishing $60 million in construc­tion projects in Yosemite Valley, siding with a small group of environmentalists who sued the federal govern­ment, saying further commer­cial development would bring greater numbers of visitors, thus threatening the Merced's fragile ecosystem. 
"The park's plans for com­mercialization could damage Yosemite for future genera­tions," said Bridget Kerr, a member of Friends of Yosemite Valley, one of two local environmental groups that filed the suit. 
The government is appeal­ing, fearing the ruling could

force the National Park Service to limit the number of people allowed into Yosemite each day, a precedent it does­n't want to see echoed in other parks. 
"I don't think we've ever had a ruling with these kind of implications," said Kerri Cahill, a Denver-based plan­ner for the park service. "It's going to have a direct influ­ence on the public who care about these places." 
The case has Yosemite's most loyal advocates sharply divided over how to balance preservation with access to public lands. Even environ­mentalists can't agree on how to minimize the human foot­print -some believe cars should be kept out entirely; others say visitors should have to make reservations in advance. 
Yosemite was the first land in the country set aside for its scenic beauty, declared a pub­lic trust in 1864 by Abraham Lincoln. Its 1,200 square miles of granite peaks and towering waterfalls became a national park in 1890, and with few exceptions its gates have been open to all ever since, though backcountry permits are limited to mini­mize the human impact on wilderness areas. 
The Merced itself is protect­ed under the federal Wild and Scenic Rivers Act.

Re-state of the Union 
The following excerpts are from various State of the Union Addresses throughout America's history. Due to space limitations, there's not much of each address, but I think that a pattern may emerge nonethe­less. 
Calvin Coolidge, Dec. 4, 1928: 'The practical application of economy to the resources of the country calls for conser­vation ... We have a conservation board working on our oil problem. This is of the utmost importance to the future well-being of our people in this age of oil-burning engines and the general application ofgasoline to transportation." 
Herbert Hoover, Dec. 3, 1929: "Conservation of national resources is a fixed policy of the Government ... Conservation of our oil and gas resources against future need is a national np,cessity." 
Harry S. Truman, Jan. 9, 1952: "In the Middle East political tensions and the oil controversy in Iran are keeping the region in a turmoil." 
Richard Nixon, Jan. 30, 197 4: "These measures will require the oil companies and other energy producers to provide the public with the necessary information on their supplies. They will prevent the injus­tice of windfall profits for a few as a result of the sacrifices of the millions of Americans." 
Gerald R. Ford, Jan. 15, 1975: "But in all honesty, we cannot put all of the blame on the oil-exporting nations. We, the United States, are not blameless. Our growing dependence upon foreign sources has been adding to our vulnerability for years and years, and we did nothing to prepare our­selves for such an event as the embargo of 1973." 
Gerald R. Ford, Jan. 19, 1976: "Taking a longer look at America's future, there can be neither sustained growth nor more jobs unless we continue to have an assured supply of energy to run our economy. 

Will McAuliffe 
Strategery Analyst 

Domestic production of oil and gas is still 
declining. 

Our dependence on foreign oil at high 
prices is still too great, draining jobs and 
dollars away from our own economy at the . rate of $125 per year for every American." 
Gerald H. Ford, Jan. 12, 1977: "In 1973 
we were dependent upon foreign oil 
in1ports for 36 percent of our needs. Today, 
WA are 40-percent dependent, and we'll 
pay out $34 billion for foreign oil this year. 
Such vulnerability at present or in the 
future is intolerable and must be ended." 
Jimmy Carter, Jan. 19, 1978: "Every day 
we spend more than $120 million for for­
eign oil ... Now we know what we must do, 
increase production. We must cut down on 
waste. And we must use more of those 
fuels which are plentiful and more perma­
nent." 

Jimmy Carter, Jan. 21, 1980: "The crises 
in Iran and Afghanistan have dramatized a 
very important lesson: Our excessive 
dependence on foreign oil is a clear and 
present danger to our Nation's security. 
The need has never been more urgent. At 
long last, we must have a clear, compre­
hensive energy policy for the United 
States." 

Jimmy Carter, Jan. Hi, 1981: "An effec­
tive national energy plan is essential to 
increase domestic production of oil and 
gas, to encourage conservation of our 
scarce energy resources, to stimulate con­
version to more abundant fuels, and to 
mduce our trade deficit." 
Honald Reagan, Jan. 26, 1982: "By 
deregulating oil we've come closer to 
achieving energy independence and helped 
bring down the cost of gasoline and heat­
ing fuel." 

George H.W. Bush, Feb. 9, 1989: "And in 
some cases, the gulfs and oceans off our 
shores hold the promise of oil and gas 
reserves which can make our nation more 
secure and less dependent on foreign oil." 
George H.W. Bush, Jan. 29, 1991: "Most 
Americans know instinctively why we are 
in the Gulf. They know we had to stop 
Sad dam now, not later ... They know we 
must make sure that control of the world's 
oil resources does not fall into hls hands only to finance further aggression." 
Bill Clinton, Feb. 17, 1993: "Our plan includes a tax on energy as the best way to provide us with new revenue to lower the deficit and invest in our people. Moreover, unlike other taxes, this one reduces pollu­tion, increases energy efficiency, and eases our dependence on oil from unstable regions of the world." 
George W. Bush, Jan. 29, 2002: "This Congress must act to encourage conserva­tion, promote technology, build infrastruc­ture, and it must act to increase energy production at home so America is less dependent on foreign oil." 
George W. Bush, Jan. 31,2006: "Breakthroughs on this and other new technologies will help us reach another great goal: to replace more than 75 per­cent of our oil imports from the Middle East by 2025." 
George W. Bush, Jan. 23, 2007: "For too long, our nation has been dependent on foreign oil. And this dependence leaves us more vulnerable to hostile regimes, and to terrorists who could cause huge disrup­tions of oil shipments ... raise the price of oil ... and do great harm to our economy." 
I hope you've caught on by now. 
For almost 80 years, our nation's leaders have been aware of and supposedly have been attempting to conserve our domestic resources while at the same time attempt­ing to curb our appetite for and depend­ence upon foreign oil. It's up to us as Americans to make this administration, Congress and ourselves accountable for such a change. Only through the elimina­tion of unnecessary tax breaks for big oil companies and establishment of incentives for alternative energies can we truly free ourselves from our oil addiction.

McAlarney suspension evaluated 
University's decision consistent 

There is a common theme that students feel that McAlarney's suspension from school was completely overboard. What students fail to realize is that this seems consistent with Notre Dame's punishments in the past for marijuana. While I was at school I knew of another regular non-athlete student who was caught with weed and consequently suspended for a semester. Maybe in both cases the sentence didn't fit the crime but it appears as if this is what the school has deemed to be the correct punishment. The bottom line is if McAlarney did not do it then we wouldn't have this problem. 
Chris Orenchuk class of 2005 Cleveland, Ohio Jan. 26 

Punishment too severe for crime 
This is one of the many responses I'm sure you have received to Lucy Lopez' Letter to the Editor ("McAlarney suspension justified," Jan. 25) regarding the justification of Kyle McAlarney's suspension following his marijuana possession charge. I completely agree with her contention that Notre Dame is one of the most highly scrutinized in the world, and as such, must maintain its respected reputation. 
However, to suggest the unwavering appropriateness of this punishment for one of its students in possession of a small amount of marijuana is ridiculous. The purpose of rules and regulations for any organization, duLac for Notre Dame, is to provide protections for the individuals of the organization. I think it would be safe to assume that McAlarney accepted responsibility for his actions by committing to a pretrial diversion program in which he will be subject to random drug tests for the next 11 months and a substance abuse assessment. 
A suspension of two semesters already defies precedent because the most common punishment is a one-semester suspension. How can anyone expect that such a span away from school could benefit McAlarney? Is he going to grow intellectually by missing two semesters of classes, thus being forced to play academic catch-up for the rest of his undergraduate career? Does he need to have the constant reminder of his mistake by sitting at home until next fall to learn his lesson? Obviously, the university needed to administer some sort of penalty to McAlarney, but ifthe school wishes to protect its image, a punishment respecting a student's decision to take responsibility for his actions would be more appro­priate for next time. It is too bad they cannot renege on their decision on this case.

Case deserves better handling 
Kyle McAlarney made a grave error in judgment. Since he proba­bly hasn't even reached legal drink­ing age, he will have a lifetime to teach others how much he learned from this experience. 
Notre Dame appears to have made even greater grievous errors of judgment; first of all, by not releasing a public statement in defense of its actions. Right or wrong, this case needed to be han­dled more carefully due to the pub­lic exposure it has commanded. The McAlarney family and the entire Notre Dame community would have benefitted from an explanation from the University why athletic director Kevin White and basketball coach Mike Brey have reportedly responded that they were shocked by the hardline disposition handed down. Maybe it's because the University does not have a defensible position? 
After reading the student hand­book for the first time in over 40 years, I was impressed by its calling students to accountability for their actions. This accountability was noted to be a difficult process, "par­ticularly ... on those rare occasions when the conduct in question is so intolerable in terms of community standards as to warrant separation from the University." I submit that McAlarney's conduct was not intol­erable in terms of overall Notre Dame community standards. I was shocked to learn that first offense OWl's are punishable by discipli­nary "probation" for one semester, and second offense OWl's are pun­ishabla by disciplinary "suspension" for one semester: yet McAlarney received two semesters' disciplinary "suspension" for his marijuana pos­session arrest. 
Furthermore, normal society's constitutional due processes are unavailable to the accused. The potential is ripe for uneven, irra­tional application of both the disci­plinary process and its final judg­ment. I'm certain these disciplinary procedures were neither written nor endorsed by the University's school of law. Of even greater import, the handbook begins with the University mission statement, describing Notre Dame as a place of teaching and community prompted by God's grace to assist the world in creating justice grounded in love and that emphasis on community in Catholicism explains why Notre Dame has fostered familial bonds in its institutional life. 
It seems Notre Dame has ignored its own mission statement, maybe because we abandoned its underly­ing premises in handling this case. What are we actually teaching McAlarney? Was he provided jus­tice grounded in love? Have we actually fostered familial bonding here? By my count, our beloved University has undertaken its mis­sion for almost 165 years. It's time, and Notre Dame needs to get this one right.

'Bigot' an unfairly applied tertn 
As exemplified by Liz Coffey's column ("Save it for the toilet," Jan. 25), it's politically cor­rect these days to label someone who is opposed to illegal immigration as "anti-immigrant" and thus a bigot. I personally believe that bigotry is a terrible thing. As such, I consider it a serious charge to call someone a bigot. 
Anyone who makes the charge should have a good basis for it. In making the leap to call­ing those in the Minuteman Project bigots, Coffey fails to establish such a basis. Why are they bigots? Ifit's because most of those coming across the Mexico-Arizona border are Mexicans, then why aren't the "Minutemen" doing anything to stop Mexicans who enter our country legally? Why didn't they do this before 9/11? She fails to even address the pos­sibility that the modern-day "Minutemen" are motivated by a sincere desire to prevent ille­gal immigration and the dangers of terrorism and various other problems that come along with it. In fact, the only rationale she even entertains is that they are just bigots. I doubt that Coffey has been to the border or met any of the "Minutemen," yet she knows they are bigots? 
Coffey's making assumptions about people without really knowing about them sounds more like bigotry than anything about the "Minutemen." Is it bigoted to try and prevent people from coming into this country illegally? Ifthat's the case, then I guess all of our bor­der security measures are bigoted. The fact that we even have checkpoints where people must stop to come across the border legally must be bigotry too. U.S. Border Patrol Agents? 
Bigots, I guess. They are trying to stop illegal entry in to the U.S., after all. 
I am not sure I agree with the approach taken by the Minuteman Project. Anything that resembles vigilantism has the potential to degenerate into something dangerous, and gen­erally it is better to let law enforcement do its job. But that does not make the Minuteman Project a group of bigots. Ifshe is opposed to the Minuteman Project, is Coffey also opposed to adding more Border Patrol Agents to stop, or at least reduce, illegal immigration? Ifso, what is her solution to the problem? Or does she even think there is a problem? 
I happen to think one of the biggest problems our country faces is border security, partic­ularly in light of 9/11. Even with all the partisanship in Washington right now, you would be hard-pressed to find many in Congress on either side of the aisle who disagree with that. Given the seriousness of what is at stake with respect to terrorism, ifI have to, I am willing to endure being called (unfairly and inaccurately) a bigot for opposing illegal immigration. But it's too bad ifthat's the case. Maybe the hate finger is pointed in the wrong direction, Ms. Coffey.

'Le Medecin' just what the doctor ordered 
By ANALISE LIPARI Assistant Scene Editor 
Despite the blanket of newly fallen snow and the obvious language barrier with most of its audience, the annual French Theatre Production class's per­formance of Moliere's "Le Medecin malgre lui" drew a full house Sunday at the DeBartolo Performing Art Center's (DPAC) Philbin Theater. 
With its blend of witty dialogue, physical humor and outrageous situa­tions, "Le Medecin malgre lui" drew the crowd in through the strength of the students. 
Moliere's centuries-old text takes its comedic cues from the exploits of Sganarelle, the frequently intoxicated stick collector who spends his days nursing (and often singing to) a bottle of wine and occasionally beating his wife. 
Few playwrights could create humor and sympathy out of such a character, but the strength of Moliere's comedic writing helps make Sganarelle a mem­orable and amusing protagonist. 

Professor Paul McDowell gives Sganarelle a thick, booming voice to match his faux-portly figure, and an over-the-top sense of self-importance helps cement the image of this most loutish of leads. 
The play opens with an angry dis­pute between Sganarelle and Martino (Anne Lauer), his beleaguered and oft­beaten spouse. The rapport between McDowell's Sganarelle and Lauer's Martine implies a humorous power struggle at the core of their relation­ship, with Martine criticizing his drunken gluttony and Sganarelle defending himself with roundabout "logic" and a large stick. 
To get back at her husband, Martine conspires with an unwitting pair of servants, Lucas (Tom Dorwart) and Valere (Mary Corrigan) try to trick Sganarelle into believing he is a doc­tor (or "medecin") in order to treat the dire condition of Lucinde (Jana Miller), the newly-mute daughter of a wealthy neighbor, Geronte (Michael Barrett). 
What follows is a zany mix of physi­cal comedy and Moliere's sharp wit, as

The latest in the "NO Presents: Live at the Morris" series of attractions at South Bend's Morris Performing Arts Center, the Moscow Festival Ballet's production of Tchaikovsky's "Swan Lake" elevated a simple Saturday night into a euphoric experience of music and dance. The prodigious skill of each member of the company, combined with beautiful cos­tumes, lush lighting and scenery and the venerable score itself, created an unfor­gettable evening of dancing. Despite being performed without the aid of an orchestra, and instead incorporating the use of a recording of the ballet's score, the production was an exuberant suc­cess. 
The three act story of "Swan Lake" opens at an event in honor of Prince Siegfried's birthday, at the behest of his mother, the Queen. Courtiers, peasants and the court jester each perform vari­ous dances in celebration of the Prince, and Siegfried receives a crossbow as a coming-of-age gift. The multiple smaller dances featured during this portion of the ballet were of a more lighthearted nature than much of the rest of the bal­let's more dramatic portions, especially the numbers where the court jester took center stage. 
As the ballet continues, that evening, Siegfried explores the woods with his crossbow and discovers a mysterious group of white swans who -in 
Ruthart. By day, the women are swans, but by moonlight chango back into their human forms. The queen of the swans, the beautiful Odette, falls in love with the Prince, and he vows to save her life by deelaring his true love for her at tomorrow's Ball. 
It is here, as Siegfried first discovers the bewitched swans, when the famous theme of "Swan Lake" is first heard, and Sganarelle comes to believe he is a doctor, and proceeds to treat patients with items such as wine and cheese. 
As is custom with most works of Moliere, at the center of the turmoil is a thwarted pair of young lovers, Lucinde and the poor but sweet Leandre (Matthew Goodrich). 
Lucinde has been promised by her father to an unseen and older wealthy man, and until Leandre's miniscule fortune can compete, the two are doomed. That is, until Sganarelle decides to get himself involved. 
Hounding out the cast are Heidi Storer as Jacqueline, the wet nurse in whom Sganarelle is all-too-interested, and Theresa Welch and Stephanie Brauer as Parette and Perrinette, respectively, two local women who misguidedly seek the help of the reput­ed "medecin" to treat their sick rela­tive. 
The production's energy and sense of humor undoubtedly came from the stu­dents. From Dorwart's Lucas, who stomps and hops across each scene, to Miller's gibberish mutterings as Lucinde pretends to be mute, the cast's care and dedication to the production shone through. 
As the case may often be with per­formances held in the Philbin Theater, the set itself was essentially nonexist­ent, with little but a stool and a pile of sticks to stand for forests and houses alike. 
With the colorful costumes and ani­mated performances, however, such a stark set allowed the focus of the pro­duction to be on both the players themselves and the humor of their speech. 
The continued strength and success of each year's performance is, accord­ing to McDowell, due to none other than the students themselves. 
"It's all because of what the students find in each other," McDowell said at the end of Sunday afternoon's final performance. "It's what they find in a playwright who hasn't graced this earth in over 300 years."

Hutbart strangely appears at the ball with Odile, his daughter who has been disguised to look remarkably similar to Odette.

It is only when Siegfried flees to Swan Lake and defeats Rotbart that he and Odette can finally be united and the swans can be free. 
The Russian Festival Ballet dancers, especially those in the roles of Siegfried and Odette, were remarkably talented. The role of Odette is considered to be one of the most technically difficult in the entirety of classical ballet, as the bal­lerina plays both the white swan, Odette, and the black swan, Odile, as well as performing over thirty fouettes en tour­nant during the ballet's third act. Olga Grigorieva, the ballerina who danced the role of Odette/Odile, seemed to have mastered the difficulties of the role with ease, playing both the timid and pure Odette and the seductive Odile very well. 
The costumes and scenery were very well done, adding to the production's elegant feel. The lighting in particular was striking. The ballet's finale closed with the rising of the sun, as a stage for­merly bathed in a blue and green wash was subtly overcome with the warm, pinkish-white glow of morning.

Shakespeare shake-up retells classic story 
By MICHELLE FORDICE Assistant Scene Editor 
The story of Romeo and Juliet has been reinvented time and time again in everything from the 1996 "Romeo + Juliet" staring Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes, to the upcoming animated film "Gnomeo and Juliet" starring lawn gnomes and produced by Elton John, but some versions stand out for their memorability and appeal. Summer Shakespeare's "The Romeo and Juliet Story: In Concert" brings the best of these together in a wonderful show that focuses on the timelessness of the love between Romeo and Juliet. 
The production, adapted by the pro­ducing artist director of Notre Dame's Summer Shakespeare, Jay Skelton, unites songs from Charles Gounod's opera "Romeo Et Juliette," Leonard Bernstein's "West Side Story," parts of Shakespeare's original dialogue, and an original narration. The music was pro­vided on-stage by the wonderful thirty piece New Millennium Orchestra of Chicago joined by nine Notre Dame stu­dents. 
Doug MacKechnie did a superb job as the narrator. In his role he took on nearly all of the play's characters except Romeo and Juliet, simply but strongly switching from one character to another with a small change in pos­ture or by using the occasional prop, such as glasses for Friar Lawrence. The choice to concentrate the action of the play not directly involving the two lovers into one actor was a wise one. MacKechnie was able to act as a sound­board for the love story around him so that the audience was allowed to con­centrate purely on the love of Romeo and Juliet, leaving behind for a moment the other plotlines and themes of the play that are generally more conflict­ual. 
The rest of the cast consisted of two pairs of lovers, one pair taking on the majority of the acting and the other the singing. Steven Marzoff and Blair Robertson made good use of their act­ing scenes to both pay tribute to the original Shakespearean dialogue and portray the youth and passion of Romeo and Juliet. Stacey Tappan, a Lyric Opera of Chicago soprano, and Jay Morrissey, tenor and Notre Dame alum, both rose to the occasion in singing the ranging parts between the opera and the musical. Together all four did a beautiful job depicting the love story and, most importantly, the transitions between the actors were smooth. Furthermore, by using multiple actors to play the same characters, as well as mixing the pairs, it allowed the audience to truly focus on Romeo and Juliet as a whole, and not one single production. 
"The Homeo and Juliet Story: In Concert" seamlessly united a 16th cen­tury play, a 19th century opera, and a 20th century musical into a production that showcased so many of the inter­pretations of Romeo and Juliet that it actually reduced the show down to the essential vision of the lovers. In doing so, it proved that the story of the two "star cross'd lovers" would romance its audience no matter their surroundings. 

"The Romeo and Juliet Story: In Concert" was a special off-season event for the Summer Shakespeare company whose proceeds went toward establish­ing the Dr. Paul A. Rathburn Scholarship Fun. Rathburn is a profes­sor emeritus of English at Notre Dame who founded Summer Shakespeare and received both the Charles E. Sheedy Award for Excellence in Teaching (1983) and the Frank O'Malley Award for Teaching Excellence (1999).

MOVIE REVIEW 
Family 'Pursuit': Two Smiths star in 'Happyness' 
By SEAN SWEANY Assistant Scene Editor 
The "Will Smith Show" has become something of a given at the American box office. Every several years, the comedic actor would turn out a block­buster film that went on to earn huge profits in its first weekend, quickly tapering off until the movie aired on network television 12 months later. 
These films -like "Men in Black" or "1, Robot" -were fun and turned Smith into a star, but aside from "Ali," never cemented his status as a legiti­mate actor. Smith's latest film, "The Pursuit of Happyness," however, puts this criticism to rest and has shown the world that Smith has immense acting talent. 
The film tells the true story of Chris Gardner (Smith), a salesman struggling to support his wife (Thandie Newton, "Crash") and son (Jaden Smith) while entertaining dreams of becoming a stockbroker in 1980s San Francisco. lie acts upon his goals -undergoing a 1-in-20 shot of becoming a broker -in the face of his wife leaving him and having to live out of homeless shelters with his son. Despite the fact that Gardner is extremely intelligent and hard-working, failure seems to find him at every corner, denying him his dream of becoming happy. 
It is obvious that "Happyness" (the title is misspelled because of the way the word is written on the wall outside Gardner's son's daycare center) was designed for Smith, and without him. it would not work. His charm and humor stand out against the suffering and sadness which he must endure, which creates a very real and emotional char­acter. The audience thrives on the high points and sinks to the low ones togeth­er with Smith, whose superb perform­ance earned him an Oscar nomination for Best Actor. 
Nowhere is this emotional roller coaster more apparent than in a scene where Gardner and his son go from playfully running from imaginary dinosaurs in a deserted subway station to shamefully trying to sleep in the sta­tion's bathroom while someone pounds on the locked door from the outside. 
Smith's son Jaden performs remark­ably well in his first big-screen appearance and the connection between real life father and son is evi­dent in their characters, which only makes the movie more believable. 
"The Pursuit of 
Happyness" is the first American film The Pursuit of 
for Italian director Gabrielle Muccino, who creates a

harsh, gritty world, but does

not bring anything outstanding to the table. Smith's act­ing dazzles here, but everything else seems so ordi-nary and unimaginative that one can­not help but wonder if the only intent in producing "Happyness" was for Smith to be nominated for an Oscar. 

This type of story is of course a recurring Hollywood theme, and just about anyone is able to guess whether Gardner succeeds in the end. In the face of these obstacles, one would hope that a director could keep the film fresh and original, but Muccino ­while he does not do a bad job ­attempts nothing to make the film stand head and shoulders above the many others that inhabit the genre. 
In spite of any possible missed oppor­tunity for "The Pursuit of Happyness" to be an outstanding film, Will Smith, like his character in the movie, takes on a seemingly insurmountable burden -to make the film a very good one ­and succeeds. "Happyness" ultimately becomes another "Will Smith Show," but one that is inspirational. uplifting and worth watching over and over again.

Associated Press 

SAN DIEGO -Tiger Woods is more interested in a fifth green jacket at the Masters than 11 straight victories on the PGA Tour. 
At this rate, he might have a chance to get both. 
Woods resumed his improbable pursuit of Byron Nelson with a pre­dictable result at the Buick Invitational on Sunday, winning for the third straight year to stretch his PGA Tour winning streak to seven. That's the second­longest streak in tour histo­ry behind Nelson in 1945, and there is little evidence anyone can stop him. 
"It ain't easy beating that guy," said Charles Howell III, who certainly tried. 
Woods caught up to the pack with a 3-wood from 276 yards to set up a 25­foot eagle putt on the ninth hole. He buried the hopes of his final challenger with a 9-iron to 2 1/2 feet on the 17th hole for birdie. His final act was figuring out how to get his ball out of a small hole in front of the 18th green, hitting it with the edge of his sand wedge to 3 feet for a par and a two-shot victory. 
It gave him a 6-under 66, the best score all week on the demanding South Course, site of the U.S. Open next year. Nelson's record often has been thought to be untouchable, which now describes the world's No. 1 player. 
"As far as how special seven is, you're in elite company," Woods said. "There's only one person ahead of you. He's one of the greatest legends in the history of the game. To be in company like with Mr. Nelson ... it's pretty spe­cial." 
This is the second time Woods has made a run at Nelson, who died in September. Woods won six straight in 2000, a streak that Phil Mickeslon stopped at Torrey Pines. But against a cast of challengers short on experience or victories, Woods met little resistance in winning at Torrey Pines for the fifth time in 10 tries. 
The only question is the veracity of the streak ­Woods failed to win once in Europe and twice in Asia during his run -and when he will resume his chase of Nelson's mark. 
Woods believes his win­ning streak ended when he lost in the first round of the HSBC World Match Play Championship last September, a European tour event. The PGA Tour record book only reflects its own tournaments. 
All that matters to Woods is his pursuit of Jack Nicklaus' record 18 profes­sional majors.

Federer reaches double digits
for Grand Slam titles 
MELBOURNE, Australia -Roger Federer captured his lOth Grand Slam singles title without dropping a set, finishing a dominating run through the Australian Open by beating Fernando Gonzalez of Chile 7-6 (2), 6-4, 6-4 in Sunday's final. 
Federer improved his winning streak to a career-best 36 match­es, became the first man in the Open era to twice win three straight majors and has won six of the last seven Grand Slam titles ­his only loss was in the French Open final to Rafael N ada!. 
It also was the first time that a champion went through a major without dropping a set since the 1980 French Open, when Bjorn Borg did it for the third time. Ken Rosewall, who was sitting in the stands, was the last man to accom­plish the feat at the Australian Open, in 1971. 
With Barbaro's life in the 
balance, doctors make cast 
PHILADELPHIA-A custom-made cast was removed and Barbaro under­went a procedure on his right hind leg Saturday, the same leg the Kentucky Derby winner shattered eight months ago in the Preakness. 
It is the first time in weeks the right hind leg has been the focus of con­cern. For months, it was the left hind leg that put Barbaro's recovery in serious jeopardy because of laminitis, the often-fatal hoof disease. 
"They did some procedures on the one he originally injured," co-owner Roy Jackson told The Associated Press on Saturday night. "He had a little bit of a bruise, an abscess. I should let New Bolton fill you in on the proce­dure." 
Gail Luciani, a spokeswoman for the University of Pennsylvania's veteri­nary school, would not confirm if a procedure was performed on Barbaro by chief surgeon Dean Richardson and had no additional comment. 
Cowboys may hire Turner 
over Garrett as head coach 
IRVING, Texas-Norv Turner got the best out of Troy Aikman, Emmitt Smith and Michael Irvin when he was the Dallas Cowboys' offensive coordinator. 
He thinks he can do the same with Tony Ramo, Terrell Owens and the rest of the club as their next head coach. 
Turner interviewed for the job Sunday, becoming the seventh ­and likely final -candidate being considered by owner Jerry Jones. 
"I was excited to get a chance to visit and talk about things that are important to me," said Turner, San Francisco's offensive coordinator. "In this league, it's all about timing and circumstance.... I've got a lot of confidence in the things I can do. I think there are a lot of people in this league that look at it in that manner." 
Turner was the offensive coordi­nator in Dallas from 1991-93.

Bears arrive in Miami to begin Super Bowl week 
Associated Press 
MIAMI -Coach Lovie Smith thumbed through the Indianapolis Colts press guide on a three-hour flight that delivered the Bears from the cold of Chicago to the warm comfort of Florida -a trip that landed them back at the Super Bowl. 
"I looked at 18 pages of Peyton Manning," Smith said Sunday night, about two hours after the Bears touched down at Miami International Airport. 
The Bears know they will have to contain No. 18, the Colts' star quarterback, in one week at Dophin Stadium, or they won't finish off the goal they set for themselves way back in the spring. 
Wearing an orange tie reflecting one of the Bears' team colors, Smith bounded down the steps of the plane and hurried to one of six buses waiting to take his team to the hotel. 
"I was one of the first guys to get off the plane, I got a chance to get my seat real quick and see the players get off and see the smiles on their faces," Smith said. 
"We feel good about where we are right now, but you know they all say the same thing: One more step, and they can't wait. ... " 
Their chartered plane sport­ed a big Bears logo on the side when it arrived at Miami International Airport. As they taxied up, the pilot opened the window of the mammoth jetlin­er and flew a Bears flag. 
The temperature was about 60 degrees warmer than the frigid teens the Bears left on a trip that whisked them from snow-covered fields to palm trees. 
It also took Smith just three seasons to land the Bears back in the Super Bowl for the first time since 1986. 
The team hotel, just five min­utes away from the airport and miles from the glitter of South Beach, featured a big orange and blue 'C' on the elevator doors and a large sign above many of the doorways with "Finish" sandwiched by two said rookie Devin Hester, who Bears could be because they New Orleans and its top­Bears heads. played in college at Miami.

Bucks beat Knicks, end losing streak 
Associated Press 
MILWAUKEE -Up two with 28 seconds left, Mo Williams didn't want to give the charging Knicks another chance. 
"I told myself, 'I'm going to take the shot and if I do miss it, they aren't going to have a lot of time left,"' Williams said. "I had to set it up right." 
Williams had 30 points, includ­ing an awkward, 20-foot jumper with 3.1 seconds left, and 10 assists to lift the Milwaukee Bucks to a 107-105 victory over the New York Knicks on Sunday to snap a six-game losing streak. 
The Knicks nearly came back anyway after Williams' shot. 
Jamal Crawford hit an open 3 to make it 106-105 and the Knicks fouled Williams with 0.4 seconds left. 
Williams, who meant to miss his second free throw, made it, giving the Knicks a chance to tie or win. 
"The way things have been going lately when I made it I thought we were going to over­time," Williams said. "We played too well today to get a moral vic­tory." 
But Crawford couldn't get a 3­pointer off from the corner in time. 
"I was trying to rush just to get it up," said Crawford, who wasn't sure if the shot even would have counted. 
Williams, who missed the last nine games after spraining his left shoulder in a collision on Jan. 8 at Denver, brought some des­perately needed energy and bailed out the struggling Bucks after they nearly blew a 13-point lead with just under 9 minutes to play. 
Milwaukee, which had lost 11 of its last 12 and nearly complet­ed its first winless month at home in more than 15 years, outhus­tled the Knicks for most of the game before New York made a furious rally. 
"We just can't put ourselves in situations like that," said Stephon Marbury, who finished with 15 points. "We put ourselves in a tough situation where we had to fight to come back. Those guys, they hadn't won a game, so we kind of expected them to come out and play the way they played. For us as a team, we've got to come out more prepared." 
Crawford, who scored 17 points in the fourth and finished with 26, started by scoring the Knicks' first 10 points of the final quarter. He picked up his fifth foul with 5:05 left and the Knicks down 91-85, but New York didn't fold. 
Andrew Bogut, who had 18 points and nine rebounds, fin­ished a fast break with a dunk with 1:33 left to make it 102-95, but Marbury scored the next five points off two free throws and a long 3-pointer to make it 102-100 with a minute to go.

With injury probleins over, Ducks down Stars 

Associated Press 
ANAHEIM, Calif. -Jean­Sebastien Giguere refused to blame the Anaheim Ducks' recent skid on injuries to himself and defensemen Chris Pronger and Francois Beauchemin. 
Now that they're all back, there are no excuses. 
Andy McDonald scored twice and Teemu Selanne had a goal and an assist, leading the Ducks to a 4-1 victory over the Dallas Stars on Sunday. 
Pronger returned to the lineup after missing nine games with a broken left foot, and Beauchemin played for the first time since Dec. 26 after being sidelined for 11 games with a lacerated spleen. 
"We all know that injuries are part of this game, but it's not an excuse whether we're going to win or lose. It's about 20 guys working hard," Giguere said. 
"The fact that the three of us were injured had nothing to do with us losing some games. It had everything to do with guys not bearing down in our zone and not doing the little things we were doing at the beginning of the season." 
Playing for the first time since Jan. 19 because of the All-Star break, the rested and replenished Ducks displayed the form that resulted in their 25-3-6 start. The victory was only their third in 12 games and snapped a four-game losing streak. 
Dustin Penner also scored and Giguere made 30 saves after missing 11 games with a strained groin. 
The 2003 playoff MVP, who was leading the NHL with 23 wins when he was injured Dec. 26 at San Jose, gave up his only goal on a penalty shot by Jere Lehtinen with 12:14 remaining.

Irish split road matches with Virginia, W & M 
By DEIRDRE KRASULA Sports Writer 
It may have been a long trip back to South Bend, but it was worth the trip for Notre Dame. 
The Irish fought severe weather delays coming home from Virginia and William and Mary in order to make it back for a match against Indiana today at 4 p.m. 
"There were obviously con­cerns about out ability to get into South Bend," head coach Bobby Bayliss said, "and for the guys to get a good night rest and be ready to play [Monday]." 
Notre Dame split its two matches this weekend. The Irish opened their season with a 6-1 loss to No. 8 Virginia Friday. Senior Ryan Keckley was the sole Irish player to gar­ner a win, knocking off Ted Angelinos at No. 5 singles 7­6(1), 6-2. Keckley battled the match on a sore ankle -play had to stop so that the senior could have his ankle taped to allow him to finish. 

The Irish fell behind early on in the match, dropping all three doubles challenges to the Cavaliers. Keckley and junior Sheeva Parbhu (No. 11) fell 8-4 to Somdev Devvarman and Treat Huey (No. 8). The other two matches followed suit with the No. 2 and 3 teams both dropping their matches 8-5. 
Besides Keckley's win, the rest of the day wasn't very suc­cessful for the Irish. After drop­ping set point in the first set, senior Stephen Bass (No. 14) succumbed to Devvarman (No. 8) 7 -6(6), 6-1. Parbhu (No. 30) struggled to succeed at second doubles falling 7 -6(2), 7-5 to Huey (No. 10).

Belles fall to Calvin 
for third straight loss 
By LORENZO REYES Sports Writer 
Saint Mary's fell short to Calvin 129-86 Friday at South Bend's Washington High School. 
It was the Belles' third straight defeat in MIAA action. 
The Knights were able to come out on top for seven of the 11 swimming events. They had six different swimmers win individual events and won the 200-meter medley relay. 
Calvin was also able to secure valuable second and third place finishes in many events. 
Freshman Sara Niemann pro­vided a bright spot for Saint Mary's. Niemann won the 50­meter freestyle with a time of 
26.95 and the 100-yard back­stroke in 1:07.13. 
The Belles also won the 100­meter breaststroke as junior Kelly Tighe posted a time of 
1:16.22 and the 1,000-meter freestyle as Melissa Gerbeth posted a time of 11:03.88. 
Belles coach Ryan Dombkowski also found posi­tives in swimmers that didn't win. 
"[Freshman] Merec;lith Lierz had a fantastic swim in the 100 free as did [sophomore] Jennifer Nicol in the 100 but­terfly," Dombkowski said. 
Niemann talked about the mindset entering the meet and some of her personal goals. 
"For this meet against Calvin, I think everyone had the mindset that we would have the chance to compete against some very fast swim­mers," she said. "Personally, I wanted a chance to compete in some of my weaker events before conference, and have some fast competition to race." 
Despite the loss, Dombkowski said he thinks the team has improved this season. 
"I think we've made great progress both in and out of the water," he said. "Only four of our current team members were on the on the squad last year, meaning basically our whole team was new. 
"After almost a complete sea­son, we're not only better in the water in just about every event, but we're better as a unit as well." 
Niemann said she is excited about the young team's poten­tial in future years. 
"I didn't really know what to expect from Saint Mary's com­ing into the season," she said. "But as the season comes to a close, I couldn't be happier. Everyone has worked hard to improve and I excited to see what happens at conference, and what next year will bring. We've become more competi­tive and hopefully we can get even stronger next year." 
However, before the Belles can worry about the off-season and next year, they have the MIAA Swimming & Diving Championships in Grand Rapids, Mich. from Feb. 8-10. 
"We'll need to focus on improving the little aspects of our races; starts, turns, finish­es, etc," Dombkowski said of his team's chances in Grand Rapids. "We've already started resting a bit to get our bodies physically ready to be our best, but we also have to focus on strategy and getting our minds mentally prepared for the championships as well. 
"A three-day meet with pre­lims in the morning and finals at night can be both physically and mentally exhausting, so we'll have to be prepared for the challenges ahead."

ND avenges only 2006 loss against Vanderbilt 
By CHRIS HINE Sports Wri rer 
The No.4 Irish kicked off their dual match season this weekend, winning two matches against Illinois and avenging their lone 2006 loss against No. 12 Vanderbilt. 
"It was great for us to come out and not only open our home schedule with a victory, but to get a victory against such a quality opponent is tremendous," Irish coach Jay Louderback said. "I know this game meant a lot to our returning players after last season's meeting." 
Sophomore Katie Potts sealed the 4-3 victory for the Irish over the Commodores Sunday, rallying from a 5-3 first set deficit to defeat Vanderbilt junior Caroline Ferrell 7-5, 6-4. 
"It was a good tough match," Louderback said. "We needed to get a tough match in before the [ITA National Indoor Championship]." 
Notre Dame started the match against Vanderbilt by sweeping all three doubles matches and taking a 1-0 lead. 
"For us, it was a big win in the doubles," Louderback said. "It's big for us to go out and start 1­0." 
The No. 11 ranked team of sen­iors Catrina and Christian Thompson defeated Ferrell and Amanda Taylor 8-3, while the No. 5 team of sophomore Kelcy Tefft and junior Brook Buck survived a scare from Taka Bertrand and Catherine Newman to win 8-7 and give Notre Dame the doubles point. Freshmen Cosmina Ciobanu and Kali Krisik complet­ed the sweep in doubles by knocking off Liberty Sveke and Courtney Ulery 8-4. 
No. 41 Catrina Thompson won a pivotal singles match against No. 42 Taylor 6-1, 6-4. 
"Catrina Thompson played very well. She and Christian played very well in the doubles and then she had a good singles match," Louderback said. 
Ciobanu also won her singles match over Sveke 6-1, 6-4 to give the Irish a 2-0 lead on the day and improve her singles record to 12-4 on the year. 
"Cosmina played a very, very solid singles match," Louderback said. "[Sveke] is a hard kid to play indoors because she hits the ball big and comes into the net a lot." 
Vanderbilt gained some ground as its No. 57 Taka Bertrand defeated Notre Dame's No. 31 Colleen Rielley while Ulery defeated Tefft 7-6 (6), 6-1 and No. 24 Catherine Newman knocked off Christian Thompson 6-4, 6-1 before Potts clinched the match for the Irish. 
On Friday, the Irish swept Illinois and its head coach, for­mer Irish assistant Michelle Dasso, 7-0 in Champaign, Ill. 
The Irish are 2-0 in their dual match season and will next par­ticipate in the ITA National Indoor Championships Thursday. 
"It should be good because there are sixteen teams there and fourteen of them are in the top eighteen in the country," Louderback said. "It should be a good tournament."

Top teams get best of Irish at NYU Duals 
By KEN FOWLER Sports Editor 
All wasn't right for the Irish. 
A week after finishing 16-1 in the Notre Dame Duals at the Joyce Center, Notre Dame post­ed a 7-5 combined record in the NYU Duals Sunday at the Coles Sports Center. 
The No. 4 Irish women went 4-2, highlighted by a thrilling 14-13 victory over No. 5 Northwestern. Senior epeeist Amy Orlando -a key figure in Notre Dame's comeback win over Ohio State last week --won 4-3 in sudden death over Wildcats freshman Christa French for the deciding point. 

The Notre Dame women also posted an easier, 16-11 win over No. 6 St. John's. The Irish fell 15-12 to Columbia-Barnard, while the Ohio State women returned the favor from the Notre Dame Duals to the Irish with a 14-13 win on neutral ter­ritory. 
The No. 5 Irish men went 3-3, falling to each top-1 0 team they faced while beating Stevens Tech, Yale and the host squad. Yale and NYU received votes in the most recent U.S. Fencing Coaches Association Top-10 poll. 
Stevens Tech participated only on the men's side and fell 17-10 to Notre Dame. 
Columbia, which finished fifth in the 2006 NCAA Championships, topped Notre Dame in both dual meets. The No. 2 Lions beat the No. 4 Irish 15-2, and the No. 4 Columbia men's team earned a come­from-behind victory over the No. 5 Irish. 
Notre Dame took an 11-9 lead with seven bouts remaining, but Columbia posted a furious come­back that included live straight wins for a 15-12 decision. 
The Irish tore through the host squad, beating the Violet men and women by identical 21-6 marks. The Violet women went 0-6 on the day, while the men were 2-3. 
Notre Dame beat Yale 22-5 on the men's side and 19-8 on the women's side. 
Two fencers at opposite ends of their college careers were Notre Dame's top performers in New York. 
Men's senior sabre Patrick Ghattas and women's freshman epeeist Kelley Hurley each fin­ished the competition 17-1 in the day's bouts.

Seniors strong in Shamrock 
By GREG ARBOGAST 
Sports Writer 

The Notre Dame men and women walked out of Holfs Aquatic Center for the linal time this season with a combined record of 5-3 in this past weHk­end's Sharnnu:k Invitational. 
Both teams hosted Big East rivals West Virginia and Connecticut in addition to out­of-conference squads Penn State and Oakland. The meet was scored as a quadruple dual meet between each of the live teams. 
The No. 19 women handily dispatched of Oakland (310-54), Connecticut (293-7(>) and West Virginia (222.50-147.50), but suffered their first dual meet loss of the season at the hands of No. 15 Penn State, 213.50 to 156.50. 
Of the four results, the Irish placed the most emphasis on their convincing win over the Mountaineers, who will likely be one of Notre Dame's toughest competitors at the Big East Championships. 
"We knew they were out to get us right now because this would be a good indication of where we stand going into the Big East [ehampionships]," sen­ior Katie Carroll said. "We feel more secure heading into the Big East knowing we have the ability to beat them." 
Carroll, one of many Irish seniors swimming in Holfs for the linal time this past week­end. left her mark. Her time of 
16:27.48 in the 1,650-yard freestyle bested her own pool record by more than 10 sec­onds. rellow senior Julia Quinn also set a new pool record as her time of 2:16.26 in the 200­yard breaststroke lert Julia llardy's 2005 mark in her wake. 
"I wasn't expeeting Ito get the result I did 1." Carroll said. "It hit a couple of us that this was our last time swimming at this place, so it was nice to go out on a high note." 
Carroll also touched the wall first in the 200-yard individual medley with a time of 2:02.40. Over the course of the two days, Notre Dame amassed nine sec­ond place linishes, two of which came from sophomore Christa Riggins, who placed second in both the 1 00 and 200-freestyle. Higgins also teamed up with Carroll, Caroline Johnson and Hebeeca Grove to take second in the 200-yard freestyle relay. 
On the men's side, No. 17 Notre Dame defeated Oakland (230-139) and Connecticut (284-86), but fell short against Penn State (221.5-147.5) and No. 19 West Virginia (228-142). 
Notre Dame was the latest to be overwhelmed by the Mountaineer tidal wave, which has destroyed 13 consecutive opponents in addition to a first place finish at the Maryland Invitational. West Virginia won 12 of the 20 events on the weekend, and the Mountaineers won 6 consecutive races on Saturday morning. 
"This weekend helped us realize that we have a major ehallenge [in West Virginia] ahead of us for the Big East championships," Irish coach Tim Welsh said. "We've been in this position before, and we know what to do in it. Game 
on." 
A bright spot for the Irish was sophomore diver Michael Bulfin who picked up two of the three Notre Dame victories on the weekend. On Friday evening, Bullin set a pool record in the one-meter diving with a total of 
339.40 points, and he nearly duplicated his efforts on Saturday missing the pool record in the three-meter diving by 5.5 points. 
"He's an outstanding diver," Welsh said. "He's been doing very well all year, and every­thing is really coming together for him at the right time." 
Other highlights on the week­end for the Irish included sweeping the top 4 spots in the 500-yard freestyle led by senior Ted Brown's time of 4:31.55. Notre Dame also took three of the top five spots in the 200­yard freestyle. 
Both the men and women will travel to Louisville next week­end for their final meet before the Big East championships Feb. 14.

Wildcat forward Dante Cunningham and guard Reggie Redding cut the lead to 66-63 with 18 seconds left. 
After an inbounds pass slipped through the hands of irish forward Zach Hillesland, Villanova had a chance to tie the game, but Redding and forward Curtis Sumpter missed open three-point attempts, giving Notre Dame its 15th home victory of the season. 
"[Villanova] was really good. It's the best team that's come into this building. We just had a hard time scoring on them," Brey said. "I think it was a step forward for us because we haven't had to muck one out like that." 
A three-point goal by Villanova forward Shane Clark gave the Wildcats a 60-57 lead with 3:46 remaining -but that would be Villanova's last field goal. Notre Dame forward Ryan Ayers sparked the late Irish run a minute later with a three to tie the game at 60 and then converted two of three free throws on the next possession to give Notre Dame a 62-60 lead. 
"It felt good," Ayers said. "It was nice to be out there at the end, in crunch time, pull out a win, and help my team." 
The Irish played the last 7:12 without their leading scorer, for­ward Russell Carter -who's aver­aging 18.4 points per game this year, good for second in the Big East. 
"We were doing a pretty good job on (Carter) for once," Villanova coach Jay Wright said. 
Brey benched Carter, who fm­ished with 14 points on 3-for-11 shooting, after he picked up two fouls on consecutive possessions. 
"I took him out not to take him out the rest of the game. I took him out just to get a blow and have [assistant] coach [Gene] Cross talk to him a little bit," Brey said. "Then the group that was in there started playing pretty well. So, you stick with it and let that group fin­ish the game." 
Notre Dame struggled to just 21 points in the first half and faced a four-point halftime deficit. 
"They're doubling you, they're scrambling you. There's not a rhyme or reason to [Villanova's defense] sometimes, but it's so fast and physical," Brey said. "You're not running your offense against them. You're just trying to make two or three passes, hit the open man, and hope to make the right play." 

The lrish were able to work the ball inside better in the second half -whether through passing or penetration from point guard Tory Jackson-and create open looks inside and outside. Notre Dame shot 41 percent in the second half compared to just 29 percent in the first half. 
"It was just a matter of making more passes there. Their pressure kind of got to us in the first half and made us go faster than we wanted to," Hillesland said. "It was just a matter of calming down and making two and three more passes and just getting them to move around before we really attacked." 
Both teams had to adjust their respective game-plans to inconsis­tent officiating. 
The first foul of the game occurred with 13:23 left in the first half, but in the second half, Villanova was called for its seventh team foul after only 3 minutes of play. Cunningham and Oark each picked up their fourth fouls early in the second half. 
Cunningham, who finished with 11 points and seven rebounds, came out after his fourth, which gave Notre Dame an opportunity to work the ball inside. Irish for­ward Rob Kurz, who ended up with a double-double -compiling 10 points and 10 rebounds-also committed his fourth foul early in the half. 
The tight officiating in the sec­ond half allowed Notre Dame to shoot 29 free throws in the second half and make 24 compared to Villanova's 12-of-18 from the char­ity stripe. 
Reynolds led the Wildcats with 19 points on 5-of-14 shooting while forward Curtis Sumpter added 11 points and ten rebounds. 
Notre Dame avenged its 102-87 loss against the Wildcats two weeks ago in Philadelphia. 
The Irish travel to Syracuse Tuesday to take on the Orange in the Carrier Dome.

Return

ment Friday that he will return to Notre Dame for summer classes and apply for re-admit­tance in the fall, in time for next basketball season. 
But his teammates' fears were assuaged a day sooner. 
"He left a message [Thursday] on a lot of people's phones say­ing 'don't worry about me, focus on the season,"' freshman point guard Tory Jackson said after Saturday's 66-63 win over Villanova. "Then he gave us a hint. He said 'we've got a lot of work to do next year. Once we received the messages, we were like, 'Man, he's coming back."' 
Irish coach Mike Brey announced McAlarney's plan to return to the team during Friday's practice, Jackson said. 
The news was especially important to the freshman point guard, who had been McAlarney's backup. 
"I was sad," Jackson said. "Kyle was a good friend and I looked up to him a lot, like an older brother. I'm happy that I get to play with him for two more years." 
Jackson wasn't the only Notre Dame player excited to hear of McAlarney's return. 
"We're excited to have him back next year because he's not only a good player, but also a great teammate," junior for­ward Rob Kurz said. 
Kurz said he was glad that McAlarney, who waited weeks between his arrest Dec. 28 and the announcement of his sus­pension last Tuesday, could have some closure of the situa­tion and plan his future with certainty. 
"We've been through a lot with him, although it's nothing compared to what he's been through," Kurz said. "We were all kind of frustrated with the process and how things ended up, but we know he's coming back now, basically for us, and that's good." 
McAlarney's high school coach, Rich Postiglione, said Friday he expected the sopho­more to return. 
"Kyle is a person who has a fierce loyalty to his school, to his coach, to his peers, to his teammates," Postiglione said. "Kyle wants to do this right. He wants to finish what he started. This is not a weak-minded kid who's going to take the best offer. He's stronger than that." 
Postiglione, who coached McAlarney at Moore Catholic in Staten Island, also said he's sure McAlarney will come back to Notre Dame stronger and even more driven to succeed. 
''I'm very proud of him and the way he's handled this," he said. "He hasn't run and hid. [He's] ready to move on and be productive." 

As a sign of unity and support for McAlarney, each Irish play­er wrote "23," the point guard's jersey number, on their shoes for the game against the Wildcats. 
Sophomores Zach Hillesland and Ryan Ayers also wore sweatbands on their arms with "KM 23" written on them. 
"We all just wanted to do something for him," Kurz said.

Newsom drops 30 in road victory 
By BILL BRINK 
Sports Writer 
Center Erin Newsom had 30 points and 11 rebounds as Saint Mary's defeated Tri-State 83-66 Saturday in Angola, Ind. 
The win -the Belles' second over Tri-State this season ­boosted their record to 8-10, 7-4 in MIAA play. 
The Belles came out firing, leading 10-0 in the first five min­utes of the game and never trail­ing. The Thunder would battle back, closing the gap to as close as one, but went into halftime down 42-34. 
"It is very important to get off to a good start," Belles coach Jennifer Henley said. "If you don't, you play catch up the rest of the game. We try to set the tone of the game in the first couple possessions." 
In the second half, Tri-State kept the game surprisingly close, trailing by as little as three at some points. With 9:24 left in the game, however, the Belles took over and led by at least nine points for the rest of the game. 
Henley said the improved play of Newsom and forward Anna Kammrath, who had 11 points and 7 rebounds Saturday, has helped guards Alison Kessler and Bridget Lipke, the Belles leading scorers for most of this season. 
"We have been able to take the pressure off of Alison as we move along in the season," Henley said. "More and more players are step­ping up at the offensive end of things that we are a more difficult team to defend than what we were at the start of the year. I think that Alison and Bridget Lipke are carrying this team, there just isn't as much pressure as there was early on." 
Lipke had 13 points and 11 assists and came two rebounds shy of a triple-double Saturday. 
Rebounding -a part of the game the Belles struggled with early in the year and which Henley said she stresses often in practice -was not a problem for Saint Mary's against the Thunder. The Belles out-rebounded Tri­State 47-32. 
Saint Mary's now has sole pos­session of third place in the MIAA standings. It faces fourth-place Olivet at home Wednesday. 
The game also produced a mile­stone for Lipke, who broke the Saint Mary's record for assists in a career. Lipke, who now has 364 assists, passed Tammye Radke's previous mark of 353, set back in 1984-88. 
"[Lipke] understands the offense we have put in this season so well, that I let her call out our plays for the majority of the game," Henley said. "She has a great read on what her team­mates can do and she has also stepped up her on contributions this season at both ends of the court. [The record] is something that this team really strived to help her achieve and we couldn't be happier for her."

"I was overdue this weekend -I had a lot of chances -it was nice to see one fmally go in," Deeth said. "Our line battled all weekend so it was good to get a big one like that." 
Deeth, Condra and linemate Ryan Thang-Notre Dame's top scoring line this year -were successfully shut down for the majority of the game by a swarming Miami defense. 
The No. 8/9 RedHawks held Notre Dame to only three shots in the first period -its lowest total of the season. 
"I thought we were lethargic in the first period -it seemed like both teams spent a lot on Friday night. Tonight was a much slow­er paced game," Irish coach Jeff Jackson said Saturday. 
Senior captain Ryan Jones led the way offensively for visiting Miami with a goal and an assist Saturday night, bringing his week­sophomore Brian Kaufman cut across the crease and slid the puck over the goal line for a 2-0 lead.

remaining in the opening period. The freshman defender turned the puck over and the RedHawks quickly worked the puck around the zone to Jones, who was wait­ing just outside the crease. 
In the second, Jones ripped a shot from the top of the circles on an odd-man rush. The puck bounced in and out of Irish net­minder Dave Brown's glove and less than two min­utes after the opening drop when he scooped up a rebound off of a Garret Regan shot. 
A few minutes later freshman Dan Kissel exploded off the bench in his first shift and beat Miami goalie Charlie Effinger with a low, hard shot to the stick side. The goal, which was assist­ed by senior defenseman Tom

"We did a lot of really good things and unfortunately our biggest problem was that we just couldn't score, and I think the turnovers were a result of not having the open looks we would normally get and maybe forcing the ball a little bit," McGraw said. 
One of the bright spots in the Irish loss, McGraw said, was the play of her three freshmen ­center Erica Williamson and guards Ashley Barlow and Melissa Lechlitner. 
"That's a pretty intimidating environment -the biggest crowd we'd played in front of since Tennessee -and thought they handled them­selves really well," McGraw said. "I think that we outscored their bench [23-16]. I think that's a big thing for us." 
The loss was Notre Dame's second in a row -the first time this season it has lost back-to­hack games. The Irish will try to turn their luck around Wednesday as they finish off a three-game road trip at Pittsburgh.

This weekend improvnd Notre Dame's record to 21-5-2 overall and kept them three points ahead of the HedHawks in the conference standings.

NO TRACK AND FIELD 
ND Invite another success 
31 athletes qualify for the Big East tourney at weekend's home meet 
By JAY FITZPATRICK 
Sports Writer 
Notre Dame continued its strong indoor track season with an impressive performance Saturday at the Loftus Center in the Notre Dame Invitational. qualifying an additional 31 ath­letes for the Big East champi­onships. 
The main reason the Irish have been so successful this season -especially at the Notre Dame Invitational -is their hard training in prepara­tion for the indoor season, said distance runner Patrick Smyth. 
"I think our training over break [has been important for our success]. The indoor season is so short that you really have to come into it as soon as possi­ble," he said. "So with the sea­son being so short you just have to get on it right away and try to get in at a fast time and try to qualify for the NCAAs." 
The Irish were headlined by their men's mile team, which qualified six runners for the Big East meet and took home six of the top 10 final times. 
Leading the pack for the men's mile race was senior All­American Thomas Chamney, who set a new personal best with a finish of 4:02.63. Following Chamney across the line for the Irish were junior Jake Watson and sophomore Smyth. who each set new best­times at 4:03.30 and 4:08.89 respectively. Joining these three in qualifying were senior Todd Ptacek (4:09.45), junior Adam Currie (4:12.06) and junior Brett Adams (4:12.98). 
"With our long break we have to work hard," Smyth said. "I know Thomas Chamney and Jake Watson !went] to Albuquerque, which is 6,000 plus feet of altitude, and I was in Salt Lake City, Utah, which is in the high altitude and we all trained [hard] and came back in shape." 
The men's team's sprinters also performed well at the invite, garnering 10 bids. Freshman Jeff Farnell set two new personal bests in the 60 meters and 200 meters, as did senior Jordan Powell in the 200 meters and 400 meters. Freshman Austin Wechter and sophomore Bill Buzaid also qualified in the 400 meters. Rounding out the male quali­fiers were sophomore Bob Kueny in the 500 meters and junior John Cavanaugh and freshmen Jim Notwell and Cameron Eckert in the 800 meters. 
On the women's side, the sprinters were able to hold their own, with seven qualifying 

times. Even though the Irish 
earned seven bids, they only 
went to four different runners. 
The trio of senior Okechi 
Ogbuokiri, junior Crysta 
Swayzer and freshman Joanna 
Schultz were all double quali­
fiers in both the 200 and 400 
meter dashes. Junior 
Dominique Manning set two . new personal bests, winning the 
60-moter dash in only 7.85 sec­
onds and qualifying for the 60­
meter hurdles in 8.61 seconds. 
Also qualifying for the women 

were Brianne Schmidt in the 
800 meters, sophomore llcidi 
Rocha and freshman Lindsey 
Ferguson in the 3,000 meter 
and seniors Amy Kohlmeier and 
Katie DeHusso in the mile. 
With the impressive qualifying 

numbers and one meet remain­
ing, the Irish are confident in 
their chances at a Big East 
indoor championship this sea­
son. 
"Everybody's showing that 

they're in shape and they want 
to win a Big East title," Smyth 
said. "I think we were third last 
year and we're showing some 
more motivation. I know a Jot of 
the sprinters are getting a lot 
more people qualified, and the 
distance team is holding our 
own as well." 
The Irish resume competition 

this weekend at home with the 
Meyo Invitational.

Besting the best 
Irish win one, tie one to move to 9-1-1 when playing ranked teams 
By DAN MURPHY Sports Writer 
With seven minutes remaining in Saturday night's game, Miami goaltender Jeff Zatkoff looked poised to collect his second shutout of the season and earn a series split with No. 3 Notre Dame -but that changed in a flash. 
Two Irish goals tied the game as the squads skated to a 2-2 draw at the Joyce Center in the second game of a weekend series between Notre Dame and the No. 819 Hndl-lawks. 
Junior Mark Van Guilder got the Irish on the scoreboard by deflecting aWes O'Neill shot from the point past Zatkoff at 13:16 of the third period. 

"[Senior center Jason] Paige got a big faceoff win and we just tried to get some bodies in front of Zatkoff," Van Guilder said. "Wes made a great play to put the puck right on my stick and I just had to tip it in." 
The goal provided a much needed spark for a Notre Dame club that struggled to get any offense going through the first 50 minutes of play. 
Four minutes after Van Guilder scored, sophomore Erik Condra created a turnover behind the Miami net and the loose puck squirted out in front of the crease. Freshman Kevin Deeth

NO WOMEN'S BASKETBALL 
Huskies shut down ND sharpshooter Allen in victory 
By JAY FITZPATRICK Sports Writer 
Despite plenty of effort from start to finish, Notre Dame could not get a shot to fall, los­ing to No. 517 Connecticut 64-47 Saturday night at Gampel Pavilion in Storrs, Conn. 
"I think our resilience again [was a strength]. I think it's been tremendous," Irish coach Muffet McGraw said Sunday by phone. "I think we really just couldn't make a shot and we played pretty good defensively." 
Notre Dame was unable to find its offensive rhythm throughout the game, shooting only 24.2 percent (16-of-66) from the floor to Connecticut's 
46.7 percent. 
One main aspect of the team's offensive struggles was the fact that guard Charel Allen -Notre Dame's leading scorer -was unable to find her shot, finishing with only eight points on 2-of-17 shooting. 

"We really need Charel to shoot the ball. That's something she's been doing well for us all year long," McGraw said. "She was covered really well and Kalana Greene from Connecticut did just a great job on her." 
McGraw also said that one of the most important issues in the Irish offense based on the loss at Conneetieut will be to find another consistent scorer to complement Allen. 
"We needed somebody to step up and take over a little bit of the scoring," she said. "And Crystal Erwin did a very good job, and Erica Williamson. But we just need a little bit more help for her." 
The Irish played tight against the Lady Huskies for the first half' and were only down 12-11 at 10:39 to play in the half after forward Erwin sank a 3-pointer. 
But the Irish offense started to lag as Connecticut pulled far­ther away and the half drew to a dose at 29-23. 
Following the intermission, the Irish were unable to create an offensive spark and the Lady Huskies quickly increased their lead. Huskies center Tina Charles took control of the game in the post, blocking shots and grabbing rebounds to secure the
