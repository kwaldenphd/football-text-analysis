In Brief ~ 
Dr. Robert A. Howland, professor of mechanical engint:ering, was named outstanding teacher ofthe year Friday night at the 1984 Honor Award Ceremony of the College of Engineering. Howland, whose classes include mechanics for sophomore en­gineers, was recognized for his. ability to teach beyond the equations and relate the systematic approach ofsolving engineering problems. Dean Roger Schmitz, who read a citation announcing the award, said Howland has earned the respect of h.is students by his open-ended office hours, wit and involvement in extra-curriculars. Also at the honors banquet, four senior engineering students -Anna Bleyer, Mark Kraemer, David Sarphie and Mary Sokoloski -were given the Rev. Thomas A. Steiner Prize, which annually honors the college's top graduates. Dr. Lionel Baldwin, dean of Colorado State Univer­sity's College of Engineering, was awarded the 1984 Engineering Honor Award. -The Obseroer 
Mishawaka police arrested a Notre Dame 
junior Friday afternoon at the University Park Mall when the student got into a fight with an off-duty South Bend police officer. Detective Sgt. Jerry Schroder said the student was arrested at 5:15 and was transferred to St. Joseph County Jail Friday night. Schroder would not elaborate on details of the incident. He said the off-duty policeman was working as a security officer for Hudson's Depart­ment Store. Formal charges are expected to be filed today. -The Obserrer

Didyou failto report some income, to claim tax credits or deductions, or errouneously claim deductions or credits to which you were not entitled on a previously filed federal income tax return? You can correct these errors by filing an amended return, the Internal Rev~nue Service said. The amended return is filed on Form 1040X, "Amended U.S. lndividuallncome Tax Return," and can be used to correct any previously filed Form I 040, I 040A or 1 040EZ. Form 1040X must be filed within three years from the date of the 
original return or within two years from the time the tax was paid, whichever is later. It is not necessary to file an amended return to correct addition and subtraction errors, or if you failed to submit a rl·quired schedule. Form 1040X and instructions may be obtained by calling the IRS toll-free at 1-800-424-1040. -The Obseroer

dosed this weekend while tests attempted to discover whether an employee might have transmitted bacteria during food handling or preparation. The investigation began after 33 of 36 members of the University's development department staff became ill after a lunch­con at the dub on April 27 with symptoms of nausea, vomiting and cramps. Members of another luncheon party on Monday also became ill. No one was hospitalized. john Deitchley, food supervisor for the St. Joseph County Health Department, said test results of employee stool cultures probably would not be completed until last night.

Theology requirements misguided 

The Real World. 
The very idea is enough to send shivers down rhe 
spine ofany red-blooded Domer. Yet in a few weeks all 
of us will pack off into that world of unwashed dishes 
and unpaid bills-some ofus for good. 
Few would argue that Notre Dame is representative 
of the so-called real world. In the real world there are 
no parietals and no exams. And, everyone isn't Catholic. 
Roman Catholicism always has been an integral part of this University, and indeed this Catholic character, together with Knute Rockne and his football legacy, comprise Notre Dame in a nutshell. Without its out­standing Catholic tradition, Notre Dame just wouldn't be Notre Dame. 
This Catholic environment attracts many students to the University. Most appreciate the opportunity to grow in faith with others of their own religious tradi­tion. But in a school that's 92 percent Catholic, it's easy to forget other religions exist. 
Upon leaving the sanctity ofNotre Dame, we will have to deal with people who at-

religion. If one is unwilling to study Catholicism one should, perhaps, choose another University. 
As a Catholic university, Notre Dame certainly wants to promote Catholicism. Does it, however, want to promote narrowness as well? Yes, Yes, Yes!!! Byrestrict­ing our opportunity to study other theologies, these new requirements narrow the scope ofour education. 
To be Catholic is not to be exclusively Catholic. As a 
university which claims to provide its students with a liberal education, Notre Dame is obligated to allow and even encourage us to explore a cross-section of opinions and beliefs. 
Another probable result

are ignorant of other beliefs and religious traditions? Apparently some members of the Theology Depart­ment think so. 
In case you haven't heard, the Department has recently changed its requirements. All studentsare now required to complete a two-course sequence in Cath­olic theology. 
Thus, students interested in studying other religious traditions will have to use an elective to do so. For en­gineers and others who have virtually no free electives, the opportunity to study Islam or Judaism has all but vanished. 
Since many students opt to take their second course in Catholic theology anyway, this requirement may seem rather insignificant. Consider, however, that this new restriction all but guarantees the vast majority of students graduating from Notre Dame will have had little or no contact with other religious traditions. 
Some will argue this is a Catholic university and as such has a responsibility to educate its students in this majors will be instructed by 
faculty members teaching outside their own areas of 
concentration. 
An educated person should at least be familiar with 
religious traditions outside his or her own, and a mem­
ber of society who seeks to understand and deal with 
others cannot be insensitive to their religious tradi­
tions. 
Students should be encouraged to explore and un­derstand other religions if they so desire. The Catholic tradition of Notre Dame will not be furthered, and Notre Dame's image as a fine university may actually be ·harmed by this limifon our opportunity to study other 
theologies. 
These requirements will only further the unrealistic 
image of an all-Catholic world. Protestants on campus 
(yes, there are some) complain other students 
automatically assume they are Gltholic. Some claim 
Catholic students demonstrate almost no knowledge of 
non-Catholic denominations. 
In a school where non-Catholics arc a minority, this is 
understandable. In the "real world," where Catholics 
are the minority, ignorance ofother religious traditions 
will appear as just that -ignorance.

Police ticket students in tavern raids Friday 
Special to the Observer 
Thirty-seven tickets were issued, some to Notre Dame and Saint Mary's students, and a tavern owner was arrested late Friday when In­diana State Police excise officers and South Bend police raided Corby's Tavern and Bridget McGuire's Fill­ing Station. 
Sgt. Greg Deitchley, an excise of­ficer said he did not have figures to break down the citations between students and local residents. 
Deitchley said the 37 tickets in­cluded citations for underage drink­ing, possession of false identification, and consumption of alcoholic beverages by a minor. He said 29 youths were given citations for violations of state liquor laws. Some received more than one cita­tion. 
Harold Rowley, the owner of Corby's Tavern, was arrested and charged with interfering with a police officer. He was released Satur­day morning from the St. Joseph CountyJail. 
Deitchley said Rowley "became beli'igerent" while police were trying to conduct their investigation at Corby's Tavern. He said when Rowley "got in the way" ofthe inves­tigation, he was arrested. 
Deitchley said the youths were taken to the main South Bend police station to be given citations, but were not arrested. He said the local residents were released to their parents. 
Those given citations will have to appear within five days in traffic and misdemeanor court, where they could be fined, Deitchley said. He said they might have to appear in In­dianapolis before the Indiana Al­coholic Beverage Commision (ABC). 
Deitchley said the raids were part of Project SUDS (Stop Underage Drinking Sales), which is a program ofthe governor's task force on drunk driving. 
Deitchley said one of the goals of Project SUDS is to combine the ef­forts of local and state law enforce­ment agencies. 

Senator expects FCE minimum to be passed 
ByJOHN MENNELL 
SeniorStaffReporter 
Enough Faculty/Course Evalua­tion forms should be returned to satisfy student government officials and legitimize a report to be published next year. 
In an Observer article Friday, Bob Riley, former District Two senator who organized the survey, said at least 40 percent needed to be returned. Last night he told The Ob­server, "I'm not worried that we can get the 40 percent." 
Although he cannot determine the full effect ofthe Observer article and a letter sent to all students over the weekend asking for support, Riley expects them to help. 
Ifless than 40 percent of the sur­veys are returned, an attempt will be made to publish the report for cer­tain classes where there was enough response. 
Riley emphasized the problem with mail clerks not putting the forms in the boxes. "We took the time to put the labels on the en­velopes so they would get delivered," he said, "We wanted to make sure everyone got one." Some clerks delayed a few days but got them delivered. The only hall with a major delvery problem was Alumni. 
Riley had harsh words for the Alumni mail clerk, Mike James, who was the head of the Senior Fellow Committee. In Alumni, the forms were thrown in a pile and discarded a few days later when they were not picked up by students. "We worked long and hard to get these out," Riley said. He said he was dis­appointed the process was inter­rupted by someone n_ot doing a job he was paid to do. 
Alumni residents who wish to fill out a form but did not receive one should contact student government offices, Riley said. The cost of the survey was approximately S1000, according to Riley. "Other schools may spend 30 times as much and have paid staffs," he said. "The form was small and incomplete but it was the best we could do with our budget." The report based on the survey will be published sometime next year but details are not yet finalized. 

Du Lac report released. 
ByDAN McCULLOUGH 
News Editor 
The purpose ·oftheJudicial Coun­cil's report on Du Lac, the Notre Dame guide to student life, is "basically to give the administration an idea of how the students felt about it and to show we felt it could be improved," explained Bill Ber­gamo, a member ofthe council's Du Lac Review Committee. 
The report was released yester­day. 
Bergamo explained the Judicial Council reviews the Notre Dame book of rules and regulations every few years to give it student input and make it more applicable to current situations. In reviewing the current handbook, Bergamo said the com­mittee "reworded some ofthe rules" and made some recommendations on changes ofcurrent rules. 
One ofthe immediate concerns of the committee was to match the punishment to the offense, said outgoing Judicial Council Coor­dinator Bob Gleason. "Du Lac for­merly never tied the punishment to the rule," he said. To correct this, Gleason said the committee has recommended the punishment be placed in bold print directly beneath the rule. "Whether you agree or dis­agree with a penalty, the student should know what the penalty is for breaking a regulation." 
From the committee, the report is given to members of the administra­tion, including Dean of Students James Roemer and Vice President for Student Affairs Father John Van Wolvlear. 
Among the recommendations of the committee, the sentence, "The University rules set few limits on stu­dent behavior precisely because there are more positive reasons for the students to do that themselves," is recommended to be removed from Du Lac's preamble to "better preserve the credibility ofthe entire section." 
Commented Bergamo, "Incoming freshmen read that and then con­tinue to read the rest of the pages of rules and they're going to think, 'Who are they trying to kid?' " 
The report also comments on stu­
dent conduct away from campus.

SEOUL, South Korea As HOO,OOO people watched yesterday, Pope John Paul II canonized 103 martyrs, including Korea's first saints, in a tribute to the country's w-owing Roman Catholic Church. Before the ceremony, police seized a student who brandished a toy pis­tol at thl· pope's motorcade.

President Reagan "wants to send 

you young people all over Central 
America, hut he sure as hell doesn't 
give a damn about taking care of 
veterans," said Steve Marozsan, 
chairman of Veterans For Constitu­
tional Rights, Inc. 
Marozsan, a veteran from South Bend, was referring to Reagan's lack of support for a legislative bill that "would give veterans the rights ...that every Amercan citizen has," he said. 
The bill, which is being co­sponsored by presidential candidate Gary Hart, has two aims. 
First, it would give veterans the ability to appeal to a federal court if they disagreed with a Veteran's Ad­ministration decision. The VA decides whether or not a disabled veteran is eligible for monthly com­pensation for his injuries. 
Under the present law, a veteran may only appeal to the Board of Veteran Appeals, which is part ofthe VA. 
The problem with the VA, said Marozsan, is they work under a quota 1>-ystem. "Each year, only 12

"How long have we waited for this day. How fervently we have prayed for this moment to arrive," said Car­dinal Stephen Kim, the Roman Cath· olic Archbishop of Seoul, in an emotional welcome. 
The canonization of 93 Korean and I 0 French martyrs slain in Korea, the first such ceremony outside the Vatican since the 13th century, was hailed by the Vatican as the pontiffs "personal tribute" to the world's fastest growing Roman Catholic Church. 
The church, which has been gaining members at an annual rate of nearly 10 percent for three decades, has I.7 million adherents among South Korea's 40 million people. 
In his homily, John Paul said the

Second, Hart's bill would increase a veteran's chances ofwinning an ap­peal within the VA, said Marozsan. Under a present law, written in 1913, if a veteran wishes to hire a lawyer for his hearing at the Board of Veteran Appeals, the most the attor­ney is permitted to charge is $10. 
Few lawyers will work for this fee, maintains Marozsan. Hart's bill will let the lawyers charge up to 25 per· cent of the award the veteran is seeking. 
The bill has been passed un­animously by the Senate, but has not yet been voted on by the House of Representatives. The reason for this, said Marozsan, is that the bill must frrst go to the House Veteran Affairs Committee.

University to pass Observer budget 
ByJEFF HARRINGTON 
Senior StaffReporter 
The University will approve The Obseroer's first full-year budget plan since the newspaper joined Notre Dame's accounting system this semester, Father David Tyson, ex­ecutive assistant to the president, said yesterday. 
"I hope to have it finaJly approved 
(today) or Tuesday. I think our 
accounting people were very 
pleased with it," said Tyson, who 
acts as The Observer's budget unit 
director. 
Observer fmances were officially placed under the Budget Unit Con­trol System Feb. 1, nearly five months after the University ordered the paper to join its internal budget system or face the cutoff of ap­proximately 570,000 in student fees. The request came in the wake of a University-conducted audit of the paper last summer which revealed several cases of financial mismanagement in the '82-'83 Ob­seroer operation. 
The paper's operation under the 
new system has been "working very 
effectively," Tyson said. "I have 
heard of no complaints. We tried to 
talk out the snags .. .in earlier 
meetings." 
Observer officials, however, are 
still wary ofUniversity financial con­
trol. ''I'm not happy to be on the 
Budget Unit system, but at this point 
in time it's a necessary evil," Ob­
server Editor-in-Chief Bob Vonder­heide said. 
Noting the paper had "no choice"but to join the University system, Vonderheide said the ques­tion of financial control dictating editorial content still remains. "A newspaper whose finances are con­trolled by an organization it normal­ly scrutinizes is not an independent newspaper. It's conceivable that the University will interfere with the editorial side of The Obseroer. We look in our files and find that in 1975 they confiscated Observers for run­ning an abonion ad ...How can we trust them?" 
Vonderheide added, "As of now, we've been pleased with the Univer­sity's conscious desire to stay out of the editorial (side of the paper). It's been working up to now, but we're still kind ofcautious." 
Maripat Horne, Observer control­
· ler, agreed. "We haven't had any problems yet with (the University) questioning how the money is being spent. I feel that if they wanted to, they could easily dictate editorial control, but I don't foresee such a problem." 
Tyson said he "would be surprised if (The Obseroer) said there would be any interference be­cause of financial control." The im­passe earlier in the semester was clearly the University saying finan­cial accountability and coming un­der the system were separate from editorial control.

Both parties rank the role offinan­cial aid for Observer employees as the key problem yet to be solved. The federal government requires students to report all income earned to determine their aid packages. Un­der the Budget Unit Control System, some students have had their loans reduced since the University now has access to Obseroer employees' earnings. 
"The (financial aid) problem still exists ....There is nothing I know of the University can do to be of as­sistance because of federal laws," said Tyson. "The problem is that when University checks are issued, we're accountable with respect to financial aid." 
Vonderheide agreed the "biggest problem" inherent in the budget unit system is the financial aid rift. "I can't foresee it being a major problem but it will cause some headaches .... For the vast majority ofpeople up here it will never cause a problem." 
Vonderheide was optimistic The Observer would eventually gain financial independence from the University. Calculating the newspaper would make 525,000 this school year, he said The Ob­server is "not going to be on (the University budget system) forever. If we continue to make $25,000 eventually we'll be at a point of being independent." 
"That's the bottom line: to even­tually handle everything on our own." 
Concerning the right of The Ob­server to one day take itselfoffofthe budget unit system, Tyson said, "That's one ofthose 'what if kind of things ....What if The Obseroer becomes financially independent? It would have to be examined at the time." 
"I hope The Observer will see ( lhe 
University budget system) as more 
ofa benefit than a detriment."

"There is a deepening concensus to help those who abuse." Agraduate student at Notre Dame for three years, Parent holds strong convictions concern· ing the duty ofthe University.

Hesburgh favors LaFortune work 
By MARK POTIER 
Copy litlttor 
lfnivc:rsity Prc:sident Fathc:r Thc:odorc: Hc:shurgh had some: good nc:ws last night ahout the proposed rc:novation of LaFortune Student Cc:nter. llt:shurgh said, "We'll see what it's going to cost, and I'll just have: to go out and raise the monc:y." Last wc:c:k in an interview, Executive Assistant to the: President, Father David Tyson, had called money a "major ohstack" for the proposed 
renovations to the student center. 
lleshurgh, spt·aking in an inter­

view last night in Cavanaugh Hall, 
where he said Mass, appeared quite 
supportive: of the: plan to renovate 
Lafortune. "I asked Tyson to put 
plans togc:thc:r to do what they can 
to the huilding from top to bottom. I 
told him to see what you can do with 
it in the most creative and im­aginative way possible," Hesburgh said. Last week a committee of five ~tudents and Director ofStudent Ac· tivities James McDonnell gave Tyson a set of ideas for the renova­tion ofLaFortune. 

Murday report studies quality of student life 
By ROBERT SIENKIEWICZ 
StaffReporter 
"Administrators arc singled out from faculty mc:mbcrs and hall rec­tors, apparently because of the at­titude students perceive .... Grantt·d, the University is not a democracy hut students need to have a sense that their opinions are respected," states the Notre Dame Student Life Needs Assessment Report. 
A study of student life was made during the Spring of 1982 with the cooperation of the University ad­ministration. The rcst·arch was con­ducted through the University of South Carolina's Psychology Depart· mcnt to ensure objectivity and con­fidentiality. 
The report, written hy David Murday, was requested by Notre Damt· Studt·nt Government. In

Engineering  Department  Albin

In agreement with the Philosophy Department, the Committee advo­cated the University requirement in Philosophy become a two-semester introductory course. Because the two semesters would, in effect, be one course, the committee recom­mended that two semesters be taken within the first two years ofstudy in consecutive semesters. 
Presently, most students fulfill their natural science requirement in the freshman year. Easing this re· quirement, the committee recom­mendt·d the courses in science be completed hy the end ofsophomore yt·ar. There wao; some discussion of adding a third required course, but tht·re was not t·nough support to make such a change. 
The present curriculum demands students take two semesters of marht·matics in their freshman year. The committt·e's report proposes that only one semestt·r must he taken in the first year, but both must be satisfied by the end of the sopho­more year. 
The committee proposed that the frrst Theology required course cover tht· critical study of scripture 
Last night Tyson said the plans are now being worked on by the ar­chitecture firm of Cole Associates Inc. Cole · Associates have done 
"most ofthe renovations on campus, including all of the dorm renova­tions," Tyson said. The architects arc now working up a general plan to present to the Officers ofthe Univer­sity. Once the Officers approve a plan, the architects have to convert the general plan into specifics. Tyson said, "That part generally does not take as long as making up the initial general plan." Tyson es­timated last week it would take "three to four weeks" for the ar­chitects to draw up the initial plans." 
Hesburgh said, "I've been talking 

about  this  (the  renovation  of  
Lafortune)  for  months,  but  it  
doesn't  seem  to  move  too fast  at  

times." Tyson stated, "I'm hoping and I think Father Hesburgh is too that if the initial plans are done in June we can get them approved in June." Tyson said the time the plans are approved "depends on who of the Officers is around during the 
the administration's eyes, however, 
this objectivity and confidentiality 
was not ensured. According to 
Director of Student Activities Jim 
McDonnell, "I felt that the report 
was hasically a conflict ofinterest." 
McDonnell went on to cite the relationship between the '81-'82 student body president, Don Mur­day, and the writer of the report, Dave Murday. "When you're the stu­dent body president trying to bring about some change, you can't get your brother to conduct a study." 
According to Murday, it took five months to complete. The research, which took place between january and May, included structured inter­views, a survey ofselected students, faculty, and administrators, and a later survey of a random sample of students, faculty, and ad­ministrators. 
Christian thought and life. This recommendation was made in ac­cord with those offered by the Theology Department. Students will have to begin satisfying their Theol­ogy requirement within the first two years, according to the recom­mended changes. 
The proposed requirement in fine arts or literature and the additional requirement in history or social science can be satisfied at any time. No changes were suggested in the structure of Composition and Literature, Freshman Seminar, Physi­cal Education or ROTC require­ments. 
Provost Timothy O'Meara, wh< organized the committee during tht Spring semester of 1983, said now that the committee's report is com­pleted, it will be sent to various uni­versity councils including all of the College Councils and the Faculty Senate. Input will be directed to the Executive Committee of the Academic Council. The report will then be discussed by the Academic Council. 
According to O'Meara, "The Academic Council is the main body on curriculum." The decision of the Academic Council will become policy "for all practical purposes." Of t'ourse the University president will have to give his approval, but "I cannot ever recall the presiden· going another way," said O'Meara. 
Commenting on the report, the provost said,"l think it's a good report, hut I don't want to go into 
summer." But he added, "we can pass them around even ifeveryone is not here and so get approval for them." Although no work can start i.tntil the plans are approved by the Officers, Hesburgh said that is "no big problem." He said, "We can go over the plans quickly. If they are good we can approve them as soon as we have them. It could take five minutes in a meeting." 
Hesburgh said, "Assuming I have 
the money, we want to do whatever 
we can this summer." Tyson said, 
"Some of the work can be started 
this summer, but I'm doubtful that 
any major reconstruction or renova­
tion could be started and completed 
during the summer." He cited, 
"some of the plans groups have for 
moving and some of the painting on 
the first floor" as work that could be 
completed this summer. 
Hesburgh thinks the renovation 
will be expensive. He said, "It will 
probably cost at least a million dol­
lars." He intends to get involved 
with the fundraising for the project. 
He said, "I'll just have to go out and 
fmd someone willing to part with at 
least a million dollars." 
Hesburgh said, "We have lots of 
space we can make use of, lets see 
what we can do with it." As an ex­
ample he said, "We have a full floor 
of social space in both of the 
Pasquerillas but I've gone through . 
there when there has been no one in 1 
there." 
Speaking to a group ofstudents in 
Cavanaugh's study lounge last night 
Hesburgh claimed, "I said to Tyson, 
for the love of Mike, let's get that 
place fixed up, lets go from top to 
bottom and see what we can do with 
it and let's not just put bandages on 
the place."

Professor's Apple program bought 
By NANCY HUET 
News Staff 
While most students bring apples to teachers, this time the teacher brings an "Apple" to the students. 
). Philip Bays, professor of Chemistry at Saint Mary's, has created a computer program for use on Apple computers. Bays has created a way to improve under­standing and to practice applying the technique of molecular stereoc­hemistry. 
Bays wrote a computer program which deals specifically with these concepts of organic chemistry. Compress, a chemistry computer programming company in New Hampshire bought it and is now marketing it as an instructional package. 
-

The program, entitled "Organic Stereochemistry," illustrates three­dimensional features of organic molecules. The package includes a tutorial which defines terms and gives examples. It also features some practice problems which cor­respond to these concepts. 
Bays said this program is advan­tageous to "both students and professors." It allows students to receive a complete set of instruc­tions and to see 3-D displays that are not possible to illustrate in the class­room, he said. It also provides access to an infinite number of randomly generated drill problems. 
This technique is an effective way to provide organic students with drills on 3-D molecular chemistry that are not available in textbooks, he said.

Bays was introduced to the tutorial chemistry method about ten years ago when he began ex­perimenting on the computer. He used the Intercolor Computer Sys­tem at Saint Mary's College to teach himself the BASIC language and become familiar with graphics and character manipulation. 
Bays used his command of the BASIC language, his ability to use graphics and his understanding ofin­structional needs to develop the program which illustrates the stereochemistry of Organic molecules. 
"I was learning new techniques as I was writing the program," Bays said. He experimented in his chemistry courses while he made revisions. "My students served as guinea pigs," he said. In two years he created this "thought provoking" tutorial. 
Bays had not planned on selling the program at first. The more he developed it, the more it seemed unlike any other instructional program, he said. 
He informed Compress Computer Company about his program. After making a few minor changes, he was able to market the program with Compress. The company sells it as a floppy diskette made only for the 48K Apple. It is sold in individual packages for $65 or with a back-up copy for $75.It is available in hard disk for network systems. 
While it is sold directly to institu­tions or through publishers which market it as a supplement to a textbook, students may purchase it for their own use. 
Although he was unaware of the demand or response of customers through Compress, Bays referred to the "optimistic" reaction from those who had used it before it was marketed.

Mondale beats Hart in Texas 
Associated Press 

AUSTIN, Tex. Walter F. Mondale got the support he wanted deep in the heart ofTexas and Gary Hart's state campaign manager sug­gested yesterday it might be time for the senator to consider ending his presidential quest. But Hart said he has no intention of dropping out of the race. 
"It will be difficult now for him, having lost Texas, to win the nomination," Rep. Martin Frost, D­Texas, told a news conference the morning after Mondale captured the major share of delegates elected ~n state precinct caucuses. 
Mondale and Hart were campaigning in Ohio yesterday and the Rev. Jesse Jackson, a surprise winner Saturday in the Louisiana primary, was in North Carolina. 
At a news conference in Washing­ton before flying to Cleveland, Hart said, "The issue is not who wins states, but who wins delegates." 
Hart also repeated his contention that with the exception of Missouri, Mondale has never topped 50 per­cent, therefore failing "to demonstrate that he represents the real majority ofthis party."

Showcase 
Sir Obnoxious 
Mission accomplished 
by Marc Ramirez 
features columnist 
O
bviously there is nothing more for Sir Obnoxious to do here. 
Ever since Sir Obnoxious came to Notre Dame late last year, 
obnoxiousness has begun to climb at a steady rate, and now it rears 
its ugly skull without any shame at all. As it should, ofcourse. 
But the point has been reached where Sir Obnoxious' presence is no longer necessary. When Sir Obnoxious first arrived there was a mission to fulflil -one, to preach the tenets ofboorishness, and two, to get rid ofMiss Manners. But the mission has been accomplished, and things seem to be running quite smoothly. 
Sir Obnoxious was pleased to see such events as Viking Night at South Dining Hall, where people heroically ate without bending their elbows. Such was indicative ofSir Obnoxious' own eating habits, and Sir Obnoxious even learned a few new tricks from the grubby infidels. 
But then Sir Obnoxious was mildly surprised -no, quite surprised -at what transpired next. Sir Obnoxious talked and talked about the wonders ofrudeness, and directed all ofthose harangues toward the masses. In Notre Dame's case, that was the stu­dents. But strangely enough, it was the administration that responded most enthusiastically to Sir Obnoxious' call. And it did it in the most obnoxious way possible -without any style at all. 
It nitpicked at the students, provoking anger with every jab. It at­tempted to irk students by taking over financial control ofthe stu­dent paper, but when that didn't work, it turned to down-and-dirty methods of being obnoxious. 
It invaded dorm food sales without any warning, poked around for something to criticize, and was obnoxious enough not to even pur­chase anything. 
It planted nice green grass on the quads, made it absolutely per­fect to play Frisbee, baseball and football on, and then told everyone to stay off. 
It came out with a wonderfully worded, immensely popular al­cohol policy with incredibly obnoxious restrictions including the number ofpeople in each room. 
The administration's timing was atrocious, and therefore it was good. 
But the students made Sir Obnoxious proud by responding with obnoxiousness oftheir own. The night the alcohol policy was an­nounced, almost 2,000 screaming, raving students stormed Alumni and Corby Halls, and they were very obnoxious indeed. 
The day after, several students admirably attempted to outdo the Viking Dinner by holding a drunken bash in the South Dining Hall. 
The point ofall this is, ofcourse, that Sir Obnoxious no longer needs to be here. It seems that obnoxiousness has fmally triumphed over the wimpyness ofpoliteness. And Sir Obnoxious' bitter rival, Miss Manners -she sent flowers last week just to make Sir Ob­noxious angry -has been run out of town. 
So Sir Obnoxious is prepared to depart from this place, proud ofall 
that has been accomplished. But ofcourse a few last pointers on the 
art ofobnoxiousness must be left behind. 
Remember to never open doors for anyone unless you enteror ex­
it first. 
Always strive to be creative at the breakfast, lunch and dinner tables. Invent new colors through mixing drinks such as grape juice and chocolate milk, or create new recipes to take home to mom by combining foods such as ravioli and Lucky Charms. 
See how far you can throw a biscuit, or ifyou can land a cookie in the bowl ofyogurt four tables down from you. Drive peoplecrazy by dropping a glass on the floor and catching it before that fatal second bounce. Or see how far you can roll an apple down the aisle before it hits someone's foot. 
As people are studying, ask them trivia questions which you know 
will stump them, but will intrigue them so much they won't be able 
to stop thinking about them. 
Go to movies that you've already seen, make sure you sit behind 
people who have never seen them, and tell them everything that's 
going to happen throughout the entire movie. An interesting twist is 
to do this and then change the ending. 
Sir Obnoxious would love to say goodbye, but since farewells al­ways seem to end up being extremely sappy and melodramatic, Sir Obnoxious hates them. So it appears a return to sunny Beverly Hills is next on the agenda. Or maybe Sir Obnoxious will attempt to teach obnoxiousness at Miami University. 
Well, maybe not. 

Dear Sir Obnoxious: 
Guess what/ did the other night? I thinkyou'lllike it. I went to see the 7:00 showing of"The Big Chill" at the Engineering Auditorium, and I got in free! I went early to get in line, and the auditorium was open, and there was no one around, so I went in and sat down. Pretty soon so did a whole bunch ofother people, and they never bothered to collect from us! And the movie was great, too! What do you think about that? 
Bill, the Free Loafer 

Disgusting Reader: 
First ofall, it is painfully obvious that you don't know the ftrst thing about obnoxiousness by your placing ofthe word "dear" before Sir Obnoxious' name. Second, Idon't like your name, and third, I don't likeyou. And I happen to know that you went to the 9:30 showingof ofa movie during)ames Bond week and you got overcharged by ftfty cents. So there. Get a clue.

f the new alcohol policy made any provisions for burning books, The Complete Book ofBeer D1"inking Games would probably be the first on the pile. 
Simply put, this book is a collec­
tion ofimaginative ways to consume 
large quantities ofbeer. Fifty games 
-including such favoritt:s as Quar­
ters, Acey-Deucy, and Mexican ­
provide for hours ofenjoyment for 
everyone from the lighte:lt 
lightweight to the most hard-core 
partier. 

Beyond the game descriptions, the book contains essays. lists, and trivia in much the same style as any ofthe popular Official Whatever Handbooks. 
The games are organiz,~d into five 
sections corresponding to each 
games's rate ofalcohol consump­
tion, or "boot factor." Games with a 
boot factor ofone are designed, according to the book, "for the beginner who wishes to experience the excitement and cameraderie of beer-gaming." An example ofa boot factor one game is "Burn-out." 
In "Burn-out" a napkin is placed over the mouth ofa glass whose edge has been moistened slightly to hold the napkin. A dime is placed in the centerofthe napkin. Players take turns burningsmall holes in the nap­kin with a cigarette. The player who makes the dime drop into the glass is the loser and must drink a predetermined quantity ofbeer. 
Boot factor five games are played for the express purpose ofgetting drunk quickly. "Boot-a-Bout" is one such game. 
"Boot-a-Bout" is a method for determining who buys each pitcher. One player buys the ftrst pitcher and drinks as much of the beer as he desires. H~ then passes the pitcher 
to the next player who does the 
same. The person who drinks from 
the pitcher before the player who 
empties it buys the next one. 
One ofthe ftrst subjects the book addresses is beer-gaming etiquette. Ten different rules are suggested, including no pointing, no using the work "drink" in any ofits forms, and the discreet digit rule. When the dis­creet digit rule goes into effect, any player may -at any time -dis­creetly hang his foreftnger off the edge of the table. Each player who notices must do the same thing. The last person tp hang his digit drinks. 
In an attempt to include some so­dally redeeming quality, The Com­plete Book ofBeerDrinking Games 
dedicates an entire page to the evils ofdriving drunk. In a word-Don't. 
The Complete Book ofBeer Drinking Games is useful as a reference book, but it lacks quality entertainment. Inane jokes and an over-worked vomitting theme detract from the book, but one can fmd a few flashes ofinspired humor scattered throughout. 

Movies It l.1as all the ingredients, bu.t doesn't quite swing it 
by Cat Francis 
features copy editor 
" swingShift" is a nostalgic look 
at the World War II years and the women who went to work at the jobs vacated by men gone to war. It is also a curiously disappointing movie. 
I wasn't sure what to ~~xpect from "Swing Shift." And I don't think the makers ofthe movie were sure either. It seemed random, a collec­tion ofscenes and an occasional humorous line. 
The movie's plot is relatively simple. Goldie Hawn plays Kay Walsh, the devoted and conscien­tious wife ofJack (Ed Harris). Her abject devotion to her husband at the movie's beginning will set on edge the teeth ofevery feminist in the audience. Jack goes offto war and Kay decides to take a job at MacBride Aircraft Company. 
The movie focuses on the trans­formation ofKay, from demure and naive to self-assertive and willing to explore her own feelings. In this, she is aided by two friends: her next-

night). But then, inexplicably, it 
becomes lost somewhere among the 
tangled and confused emotions of 
the players. The ending is a let­
down, as well as being more than a 
little predictable. 
Russell pulls up some ofthe movie's quality, but only in a minor fashion. His performance as Lock­hardt, an aspiring jazz musician, is an interesting contrast to his work in "Silkwood." But since he is the most likable character in the entire movie, the audience is even more disappointed by the ending, in which he simply wanders away from the action ofthe plot. 
Hawn is adequate as Kay, and does 
a credible job ofportrayinga woman 
who begins to realize she can be 
somethingother than a complement 
to her husband. But she does not do 
enough. The only major change we 
see in the character bythe end ofthe 
ftlm is that she is no longer fetching 
her husband's beer. 
"Swing Shift" has a promising and 
amusing plot, nice camera work, and 
some top rate actors. But some­

the resultant mishmash is not worth ·the price ofadmission.

Investigating one's employment opportunities 
In my more charitable moments, I have tended to believe that those individuals did not understand that their irresponsibility could adversely affect others. In light of the fact that many corporations are cutting back on the number ofcampuses they visit, we can ill afford to have people miss interviews for other than legitimate emergencies. We are in­stituting more stringent sanctions to prevent a repeat of this unfortunate occurrence next year. 
The young man I have just referred to is not exceptional when compared to many Notre Dame students. We have a tremendously talented group of men and women who are destined to be leaders in all areas ofendeavor. It is my job to help cultivate that enormous potential by providing as many avenues as possible to facilitate deliberate, systematic career exploration by our students. 
Since there is little in life which so strongly influences one's self-image and self-esteem as does one's vocation, I carmot stress enough the need to investigate and plan for entry into the world of work. It really can make a dif­ference in your life.

never developed positive ways ofdealingwith even themselves? 
A modern student center might also make student functions more palatable to those nuns, brothers and priests who claim to be so concerned about student alcohol abuse, yet are rarely seen making contact.with students outside offormal situations. Maybe school of­ficials can bartend at student functions and make better judgments about which students have had enough to drink. 
The administration must get out ofthe habit of using rules to deal with student problems. Don't hand us ultimatums and walk away secure in the beliefthat you have done all you can. Better leadership, harder work and sen­sitivity on the part of both the administration and students will solve most ofour problems. 
We must change the attitude that getting drunk every weekend is okay before we can solve the alcohol problem. A rule banning al­cohol may be useful in keeping some students from succumbing to peer pressure to get drunk, for fear ofpunishment. But a change in attitudes, better leadership and a new student center are all better ways of dealing with al­cohol and meeting a genuine student need for an improved social atmosphere.

It is an unfortunate indication of our times that even at a prestigious institution like Notre Dame, many students worry a great deal ahout their employment prospects.

freshman. Just being associated with Notre Dame meant something special; something I could never quite grasp until I lost most of those feelings. 
In the days prior to my decision to attend Notre Dame, my vision of the Golden Dome was quite different from my present one. I thought the administrators of the nation's leading Catholic institution would be willing to work together with students to create an atmosphere ofmutual respect and admiration. Today I am not so sure. 
The new alcohol policy should not be too surprising to seniors, who have seen the party situation at Notre Dame go from bad to worse; from a restriction on section parties and kegs to an elimination of non-alcoholic get toget­hers. What has happened to the sense of cooperation and mutual respect between the Notre Dame administration, faculty and stu­dents. 
Contrary to what many believe, nothinghas happened -it neverexisted. At least students have a clear picture ofwhere they stand now, even if it is under the feet of the administra­tion. There has always been a parent-child relationship, and unless both students and faculty mem~rs step back and redefine their goals and determine positive methods to achieve them, that relationship will remain. 
The controversy over the alcohol policy is just another case in point which illustrates the strained relationship between students and administrators. The alcohol policy has brought more insanity to the Notre Dame campus than a U.S.C. pep rally. Why? 
Both the Notre Dame administration and its students arc guilty of throwing a religious in­stitution into the unbecoming thrill-seeking and every individual a good job upon gradua­tion. Even the many types of services offered by my office only go so far in assisting stu­dents. The effort and initiative of the in­dividual is the key element for success. · Employment success is a function of being alert to opportunities to learn about career options and the process ofgetting a job. I wish 
that I periodically had a captive audience of 
students so I could bring to their attention the 
various things they could do to fmd challeng­
ing, rewarding work. 
Instead, they must avail themselves to the services and activities. Sadly, there are many students who, for a variety ofreasons, do not plan in any systematic way and who needless­ly panick this time ofyear. 
It is gratifying to find the exceptional per­son who has been alert and whose planning has paid off. Several weeks ago I met a recent graduate of another major midwestern uni­versity who recounted the process he had followed in determining his career choice and in getting the highly responsible position he currently holds. 
I was very impressed with the conscious 

and deliberate research he had conducted to 
become more knowledgeable about his 
career. What was most impressive was that he 
The secular Notre Da:me of the 
secularworld ofthe 1980s. Life at Notre Dame is so boring that we are seeking to spice it up with a heated controversy that quite frankly, "doesn't amount to a hill ofbeans." 
Everyone wants to live a thrillng fun-filled life. The people ofthe 80s tend to believe that if life is not one continuous orgasmic ex­perience, it is somehow unfulfulling. We have all exaggerated the amount offun we had on spring breaks or how much more "fun" our home towns are than South Bend. But none of us have had as much fun as we have described Some ofus tell stories which makes it hard to believe we've slept since birth. 
We must realize that some less-than­exciting things are worthwhile (homework for example) and that some exciting things are not worthwhile (a rally supporting al­cohol for example). 
Men will never achieve peace because they don't want it. Saying,"we had a useful con­versation with the administration," is not as exciting as saying, "we stormed the ad­ministration building and shook it to its raf­ters." 
For the administration, saying "we finally took a tough stance against alcohol," makes them seem more important than saying, "we have worked harder with students to find al­ternatives to alcohol." In a religious atmos­phere, cooperation should always be a wonderfully thrilling sign that maybe some­day all men can come together for a long boring handskake. 
We have already embarassed ourselves on national television and degraded our campus with ridiculous barmers. Notre Dame must put an end to this thrill-seeking adventure and analyze what has transpired. 
The administration has shown poor leader­ship by being unsympathetic and nearsighted. By attaching too much importance to its job, the administration could be guilty of thrill­seeking. They have changed from a covert to an overt parenting role with words like "expulsion" and "non-negotiable." The ad­ministration has overestimated the alcohol problem and taken on an almost crusade-like stance against drunkenness. 
In the future, university officials should never discount the possibility that students are capable ofproviding useful input into Uni­versity policies which affect them. 
There are those students who would be un­had begun his investigations in his freshman · year, ancl had continued to gather information throughout his entire college career. 

He had attended various career-related meetings, read pertinent books and periodi­cals, talked to faculty, used his school's career and placement resources, sought advice from alumni, spoken to upperclassmen in his field, and actively participated in the professional association related to his discipline. Armed with so much practical knowledge, he knew that he would be a much more proficient in­terviewee. Based on his current position, he was obviously right. 
Another topic we discussed was corporate college recruiting in general. This young man was somewhat critical of a few of his fellow students for being poorly prepared for their intervic:ws because he perceived, quite cor­rectly, that employers formed opinions ofthe school based on their interactions with a small number ofindividual students. 
He observed that students often do not 
realize that their actions have ramifications 
beyond their own employment. I have seen 
evidence ofthat this year, not so much in lack 
of preparation for interviews, but in the 
aston~.hingly large number of students who 
did not show up for their job interviews. 
reasonable regardless of the level of sensitivity and insight shown by the ad­ministration. However, the alcohol policy has shock<~d and disheartened even the most sensitive students. 
Some consider alcohol the sole issue, and will be lamenting the university's decision un­til they receive their diplomas. These students arc University puppets. The administration has used their seeming dependence on al­cohol for thrill and excitement to point out why their policy is so urgent. 
Drinking beer should not have as much in­flueno:e on student socializing as some stu­dents would lead us to believe. These students have lied to themselves by exaggerating the amount of fun they have had on their al­coholie trips. If our socializing depends so much on alcohol, then changes are needed. 
Another group of students has a more legitimate gripe. These students arc not total­ly su1prised by the new policyand would have taken the more sensible parts ofthe directive in stride were it not for the administration's total disregard for student input. These stu­dent:> are more concerned with the student­administration relationship, and realize that social life, not alcohol, is the major issue. 
It is not surprising that a Catholic institu­tion would somehow modify its alcohol policy. Limiting the students' capacity to throw non-alcoholic parties, however, is a bit extreme. 
Thte most disappointing part of the ad­ministration's proposal is the failure to provide meaningful direction for student so­cial life. Ifthe administration had cared to lis­ten, Notre Dame's students could have provided some meaningful suggestions. 
TI1e most obvious suggestion would be for the University to build a new student center. Maybe a bowling alley, pool tables, video games, a place to eat, a dance floor larger than Senior Bar's 4 x 4 foot square, and music videos. Classwork and schoolwork are impor­tant parts of college life, but learning how to relate to people in different settings is just as important. 
Notre Dame should be a place for today's leaders and a breeding ground for future leaders. But the people here are so homogeneous that they may fmd it difficult to rela:re to people outside this closed setting. What would happen ifNotre Dame's students

in control, but Berman again brought MSU closer by scoring at the end ofthe half. 
The Spartans continued to roll in the second half. Bermalil trimmed the lead to 6-5 in the opening seconds of the half, and, almost ten minutes later, the score had not changed. However, Dan Christ tied the score at six with 5:02 left in the quarter. Seven seconds later, Christ fed Pat Cherry on a fastbreak to put MSU in front for the first and last time, 7-6. 
MSU continued to dominate play until the final minute of the quarter when Trocchi took a pass from Grote to tie the score. The goal seemed to spur the Irish as they quickly jumped out into the lead on a goal by John Wilson. Pearsall then scored 20 seconds into the fourth quarter to increase the lead to 1 0-8. 
Once again, though, MSU fought back. The teams traded goals, but with less than three minutes remain­ing, Irish goalie Rob Simpson, who would stop 21 MSU shots in the game, dropped the ball while trying to clear it. Wilke picked up the loose 
ball and scored easily to cut the lead to 10-9. 
The goal seemed to stun the Irish and the Spartans capitalized by scoring 23 seconds later to tie the game. MSU then controlled the en· suing face-offand Notre Dame hopes did not look good. 
However, MSU threw the ball away, setting the stage for Trocchi's big goal. 
Despite the MLA title, however, Notre Dame's season is over. Be· cause most of the Irish opponents are Division III, while the Irish have to be Division I, Notre Dame does not qualify for the Division I post­season tournament.

Saint Mary's soccer club defeats ND 
ByJEAN CRUTCHER 
Sports Writer 
The Saint Mary's soccer club ended is spring season over An Tos­tal weekend by capturing first place in the Notre Dame tournament. 
The Belles defeated Notre Dame 3-I in the final to win the same tournament that they could only finish fourth in last year. 
Saint Mary's beat Kalamazoo 1-0 and Northwestern 3-0 to reach the 
final~. 
Coach John Akers attributes the 
success of the club to the 
"dedication of the players and the 
coach. There is also a lot ofcompeti­
tion within the team which helps to 
drive the players to do their best." 
Akers also mentioned that the support and help of the athletic department, college, and grounds crew "is appreciated and has helped the club. Instead of being shoved off behind Angela, the club has been allowed to use the Madelleva field. This location has caused more campus interest n the sport." 
This past winter, Saint Mary's hosted its first annual indoor tourna­ment. The Belles won the consola­tion bracket by beating Notre Dame. 
Looking to next fall, Saint Mary's will be following an lntercollegate schedule and will play such schools as Michigan, Michigan State, Northwestern, and Marquette. 
Because so much interest has been shown in the sport, "there probably will be tryouts," said Akers. "We are looking forward to the return of people from foreign studies programs who we are sure will blend in well with the returning members of the team as well as new freshmen." 
"We are fortunate that this year a great many freshmen joined the club and that we are only losing four seniors. We anticipate that the quality of play will improve next year and that the club will be very competitive."
