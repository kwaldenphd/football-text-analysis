Athletes fail in most important game: life 
IN BRIEF 
Indiana University is cracking down on alcohol use by the members of fraternities. The IU Alumni Interfrater­nity Council recently passed a resolution banning alcohol from Greek-sponsored events both on and off campus. Last weekend IU officials raided five fraternity houses, confiscating six kegs of beer at one. Formal charges and disciplinary actions will be pursued against this and an­other house which was charged with minor offenses. No alcohol was found in the other three fraternities. -The Indiana Daily Student 
A lesbian marriage has caused an Indianapolis Quaker congregation to sever its ties with its state organization rather than recant the marriage, church officials said this week. The marriage of two women last October at North Meadow Circle of Friends touched off a controversy that congregation leaders feared would result in some kind of disciplinary action from its state governing body, the West­ern Yearly Meeting. "We are like other churches," said the organization's clerk, Lester Paulson. "We are really struggling. It's not an easy thing to deal with." -Associated Press

After working in the sports media this sum­mer, I have come to one conclusion. Most pro­fessional athletes and their fans need to face a unique dilemma in American sport. 
Most sports, at least at the professional level, are arguably being played with the greatest skill and determination ever. But, at the same time, the athletes who are performing at a peak level are failing miserably in life. 
Let's take a look back at some of the year's worst stories. 
Champion Mike Tyson disposed of the only supposed heavyweight challenger Michael Spinks in just 91 seconds. Since then, Tyson has engaged in a better brawl with Mitch Green outside of, well you figure it out, a 24 hour cloth­ing store (which Tyson says) or a 24 hour nightclub in the Bronx. Earlier, Tyson made quick work of a parking attendant at a concert in Los Angeles and added to his reputation by quarreling with his management, his wife, and his mother-in-law. 
The Boston Red Sox have graced the nation's sports pages this summer with their winning streak. But even more has been said about Wade "Delta Force" Boggs who apparently had been running around with Ms. Margo Adams on team road trips for a couple of years, while Mrs. Boggs stayed in Boston raising a family. As this hit the press, Wade had the nerve to say that the marital ordeal strengthened the Boggs family. 
That's just great: affairs in the papers, boxing matches in and out of the ring, and ram­pant drug abuse across the board in sports. What seems to be lacking is some sort of social responsibility an athlete should feel for the people who not only put them on a pedestal, but also indirectly pay his exorbidant salary. 
This abuse of sport is just recently coming about, or at least just recently being heard about by the general public. Here's one reason why. It's because athletes have been put above everyone else for so long that if a writer or broadcaster has something bad to say about him, the athlete can deny everything and never speak to the journalist again. 
The late Dick Young, a New York Daily News sports columnist, would attest to this. Young felt athletes should be treated like everyone else and once asked Mets' fans to boo Dwight Gooden, a symbol for what was going wrong in sports, upon his return from drug rehab. Mets' fans responded angrily to Young's plea and gave Gooden standing ovations time after time. 
At the same time, these wonderful athletes can pad their living comforts by using the press to demand trades, complain about fan treat­ment, and then write a book about it all. Need I go any further than Brian Bosworth's com­pelling autobiography "The Boz: The Autobi­ography of a Modern Day Anti-Hero"? Classy Brian can tell everybody about recruiting

and m room on game days, but what about his own steroid use? It's always neat to look back on things everybody, including yourself, did while having a four year free ride but quietly forgetting your mistakes. 
The same goes for Lawrence Taylor, the poet laureate and possibly the most intimidating player in the National Football League. If he's not dancing on a quarterback's head, he can usually be found holding out of camp for money apparently used for his on-again off-again drug habit. And in this tough world called the N.F.L., Mr. Rozelle sits Mr. Taylor down for 30 days to get his act together. It doesn't matter that it's happened before or that everyone, except Rozelle and management, knew Taylor was off the wagon this training camp. 
These incidents paint a sad picture of Amer­ican sport today. At a time where we should be celebrating the on-the-field accomplishments of the Tyson, Gretzky, and Canseco, we are muddling through stories of Robin Givens, Norby Walters, and Margo Adams. And the owners apparently cannot persuade themselves or their pocketbooks to take a stand on the ath­letes' responsibility toward themselves and the people who pay to see them. When's the last time you've seen an owner or coach say that a player has a problem. Instead, it's usually "he'll be back in 21 days." 
Athletes are people too. The press hounds them, and it's the press' responsibility to cover them as closely as possible. Both the press and the athletes' salaries are being paid by those ­who pay attention to them. Unfortunately, a lot

Spicer stresses greater student accessibility to computers at NO 
By MICHAEL WELLS 
News Staff 
Bringing together all of the computing at Notre Dame un­der one office and improving facilities will be the major goals of the new Office of Uni­versiy Computing, according to the University's newly ap­pointed Assistant Provost for University Computing Donald Spicer. 
The improvement of com­puter accessibility for students and faculty is an important priority, said Spicer. This will be addressed over the next few months by the opening of two new Macintosh labs. 
The first of these is scheduled to open in the basement of the LaFortune Student Center in early October. The new room will contain 50 Macintosh com­puters. 
Spicer also said that an even larger lab, this one to be lo­cated in the Hesburgh Library, should be finished over the Christmas break. 
Another important task which Spicer has given priority to is the encouraging of "non­traditional" new uses for com­puters within different depart­ments. This would entail making use of computers to aid research and study in such diverse fields as sociology, graphic arts, and engineering. 
"I'm very enthusiastic about the direction computing is going to take at Notre Dame," says Spicer. "There's wonder­ful potential here." 

Donald Spicer 

Spicer, who left his adminis­trative post at Dartmouth Col­lege to accept the newly created assistant provost posi­tion at Notre Dame in June, is here largely as a result of the report of a 1986 task force on computing at the university. 
According to Spicer, the com­mittee found the university's program severely behind cur­rent standards, and one recommendation was the crea­tion of the new office. 
" Spicer joins Notre Dame at a time when the improvement of computing capabilities

ranks as one of the University's highest priority needs," said Associate Provost Roger Schmitz. 
Spicer said that while the new office wants to unify the University's differing com­puter systems under its direc­tion, the colleges which now have their own computer re­sources will not have them brought under its control. "We are in charge of new initia­tives," Spicer said. 
The O'Shaughnessy Macin­tosh lab, for example, will remain the charge of the Col­lege of Arts and Letters. Spicer said, however, that it was just refurbished as a joint venture between his office and the Col­lege. 
What plans does Spicer have for the near future? The next step after creating the new of­fice is "to address the other recommendations of the task force, which call for a signifi­cant financial investment." 
Spicer said that the receipt of a grant from a computer firm is expected to be an­nounced shortly, providing some of this funding. 
"I think computing at Notre Dame has fallen behind. It's really a matter of providing the overall direction to make it into a modern resource for the stu­dents and f acuity," said Spicer. 
racism is an ideology and thus, is hard to eliminate, he cited rational arguments as the only means of combatting racism. Those people who refuse to give up their prejudices despite strong factual arguments have a "cognitive incapacity." This general inability or unwilling­ness to accept the facts can only be remedied by "sending them to psychotherapy," joked Appiah. 
"Education is only one part of a complicated society and we must be modest before taking all of the credit," he added. 


NO mainframe worth less than new PC 
By DANNIKA SIMPSON 
News Staff 
The University is currently looking for a new computer to replace its IBM mainframe, which reportedly is worth only $2,000. 
Jim Wruck, director of the University computing center, declined to say how much the mainframe cost or why its value has depreciated so much. He said the computer was pur­chased and installed "between '83 and '84." 
The mainframe, an IBM model 3033, occupies a large room in the Computing Center and Mathematics Building. The model was invented in 1975 and has given the University community years of reliable service, Wruck said. 
The Computer Merchant's Blue Book lists the University's

mainframe computer at a value of $2,000. That's compa­rable to the cost of a new per­sonal computer. 
Serving as a general times­hare for the University com­munity, the machine transfers electronic mail on campus, as well as throughout the nation. It is also capable of communi­
cating  with  other  computers  
around the world.  
"Until  we  have  something  

fairly clear to be a proper in­vestment, we'll live with what we have," Wruck said. 
About a year ago, a speciai task force recommended that the University invest between 20 and 25 million dollars in a new computer system, Wruck said. 
As for the old system, officals are working to create more work stations for teachers and students as well as updating the Macintosh computer lab in O'Shaughnessy Hall, said Wruck. 
A new system would make research easier for students, said Wruck, who added that he would like to see the system be­come an open resource to the community. 
"It does not make sense for a student to have to go to a fac­ulty member to get an ac­count," Wruck said. "We know we have a lot of work to do. We are at the start."

Plus grading system debuts 
By MAURA KRAUSE Staff Reporter 
A new grading system with plus and minus grades has been implemented by the Academic Council and is currently in ef­fect at both Notre Dame and Saint Mary's College. 
This new system was enacted last spring when the Academic Council approved the plan brought forth by the Student Senate in cooperation with the registrar, said Dan Gerlach, a student member of the Council. 
"The idea," said Gerlach, "which was discussed at one meeting and voted on at the next, had many (committee members) in favor of it. This high level of interest made it possible for the Council to pass this. The final vote of the Coun­cil was very strong in favor of the new system." 
The registrar supported the plus and minus grading system for "two main reasons -­l.because of the strong student interest in it, and 2.Notre Dame was the only school of this

This new gradi~g system wil allow "graduate schools and law schools to more accurately compare Notre Dame appli­cants to other applicants and with it teachers can also more accurately assess students' work," said Gerlach. An "explanation of the new system will be on the back of up­perclassmen's transcripts to alleviate confusion," said Ger­lach. 
Gerlach said that the Council approved the grading plan last spring on the day that the stu­dents running for class office were permitted to hang their campaign posters, many of which claimed to be in strong favor of having a system of plus and minus grades initiated. 
The grades will first appear on the Fall 1988 grade reports.

First Pershings Leave Heilbronn 
U.S. army trucks carrying sections of nine Pershing II missiles roll out of the U.S. Pershing II site Camp Redleg at Waldheide near Heilbronn, West Germany yesterday morning on their way to the United States, where they will be destroyed in the framework of the Intermediate Range 
Nuclear Forces Treaty. See story below. 


First US missiles pulled from Europe 
Associated Press  
FRANKFURT, Germany-­Five West Europeans  West years took  ato  fter the  

streets in massive anti-missile protests, the United States on Thursday began removing its intermediate-range rockets in accordance with a superpower treaty signed last year. 
A truck convoy hauled nine Pershing 2 missiles from a base near Stuttgart, and U.S. offi­cials said they would remove the remaining 420 medium-and shorter-range missiles from Western Europe in the next 36 months. 
"This is an important event in post-war history," West Ger­man government spokesman Friedheim Ost told a news con­ference in Bonn. 
The stationing of the missiles had sparked huge protests in Western Europe, including a coordinated demonstration in 
several cities that drew hundreds of thousands of people in October 1983. Deploy­ment of the missiles began the following month. 
But the anti-missile fervor waned, and by the time Presi­dent Reagan and Soviet leader missiles in December, only a handful of protesters was still active in West Germany.

U.S. army trucks carrying the missiles left the Heilbronn site in southern Germany, about 35 miles north of Stuttgart. 
A rocket motor explosion at Heilbronn in January 1985 killed three U.S. soldiers and injured 16 others. West Ger­man news reports said the ac­cident led then-Defense Mini­ster Manfred Woerner to promise · residents that Heilbronn would be the first site from which missiles would be removed. 
U.S. Navy Cmdr. Gerry Ryan of European Command Headquarters in Stuttgart told The Associated Press: "It's the first time that U.S. intermediate-range missiles have been withdrawn in Europe. 
"The remainder of the U.S. Army European-based, intermediate-range nuclear missiles are scheduled to be removed over a 36-month per­iod," he added.

Ticket scalping ban enforced this fall 
By KELLEY TUTHILL News Staff 
Scalpers beware: the Uni­versity is no longer going to tolerate individuals making a profit from Notre Dame foot­ball tickets. 
Ticket Manager Bubba Cun­ningham said that those found selling tickets for a price higher than face value will be escorted off campus and their tickets confiscated. The ticket office will then be able to use their computers to find the original purchaser. This per­son will then be denied future ticket sales. 
Although scalping of tickets is not against Indiana law, it is against University regulations. 
Cunningham said that this year his office has the coopera­tion of the campus security as well as the city, state, and county police forces. "They're willing to help because they, too, hate to see people walking around with a fistful of ~ick­ets," said Cunningham. "These men and their families

The syllabus for Malloy's class includes seven novels, one play, and two movies. The reading list includes such varied works as Elie Wiesel's "Night", James Joyce's "A Portrait of an Artist as a Young Man", and Turgenev's "Fat­hers and Sons".

Do any of these freshmen feel intimidated by their teacher's "other job"? Not if Malloy can help it. "By the end of the first class I had all of my students learn each others' names. I want them to feel comfortable with each other," Malloy said.

The new enforcement of the University's scalping law is a result of a situation that has continually worsened over the years, said Cunningham. "People shouldn't be able to make a profit from Notre Dame tickets considering that my office turns down 140,000

added.  
Cunningham  cautions  all  

those who exchange or sell their tickets at face value to be sure the tickets will be used by that individual and not scalped. "Simply put, one should only purchase tickets to the games they want to go to." 
A new system has been developed to alleviate the prob­lem of individuals with extra tickets on game day. Cunnin­gham said that the tickets can be brought to a window outside of Gate 14 where they will be resold. 
The ticket owner would fill out a card so that he or she could be reimbursed for the

Abortion debate lacks Christian context 
A recent article in the Observer con­cerning abortion and the question of morality surrounding it seems to indi­cate that there is a definite lack of knowledge of Catholic moral teaching on the issue. It would seem reasonable that in a Catholic university any issue that we address regarding faith and morality should be discussed in light of the authoritative teaching of the Church. After all, Christ did establish the Church, and He gave her the au­thority to instruct. Unfortunately much discussion about abortion, even in Cath­olic circles, is done without any regard to the teaching of Christ through His Church. Thus the arguments presented are often seen to be severely flawed. I shall speak of three areas in which this problem is most evident. 
John Raphael, Jr. 
guest column 
The first misconception is the debate concerning when exactly human life begins. Because there is medical con­troversy over this, it is often presented as an argument in favor of abortion. However this is not a valid supporting argument in for the morality of abor­tion. In the "Pocket Catholic Diction­ary," by Father John Hardon, S.J., direct abortion is defined as "any destruction of the product of human conception, whether before or after im­plantation in the womb...As a willful attack on unborn human life, no matter what the motive, direct abortion is al­ways a grave moral evil. ... The es­sential sinfulness of direct abortion con­sists in the homocidal intent to kill innocent life. This factor places the con­troverted question as to precisely when life begins, outside the ambit of the moral issue; as it also makes the now commonly held Catholic position that human life begins at conception equally outside the heart of the Church's teach­ing about the grave sinfulness of direct abortion." Thus, it can be seen that for one who claims to be Catholic, the ques­tion of abortion is neither ambiguous nor debateable. The distinction often made between atrocities such as the Holocaust, heinous crime that it was, and abortion is irrelevant to the moral question --and furthermore, any argu­ment which places the unborn out of the realm of human life. Thus, allowing direct abortion is completely inconsis­tent with Christian moral teaching. 
The second point that I would like to 
discuss is a rather short but very im­portant one. Often it is presented as an argument in favor of abortion that other unborns, or even newborns, can be aided by organs of the aborted. It is also said that in the case of incest or rape, an abortion should be allowed. The premise behind these arguments is the same; namely, that one should do evil in order to bring about a good. St. Paul in his letter to the Romans (Rm. 3:8) teaches that the Christian is forbidden to act in this way; thus, again it is seen that in light of Catholic morality this argument is invalid. 
The third point often brought up is that by not allowing a woman to choose to have an abortion, her rights are vio­lated. Thus anyone opposed to abortion is sexist. Our late Holy Father Pope Paul VI had this to say on the subject: "Respect for human life is called for from the time that the process of gen­eration begins. From the time that the ovum is fertilized a life is begun which is neither that of the father nor of the mother. It is rather the life of a new human being with its own growth." Consequently, "divine law and natural reason exclude all right to the direct killing of a human being" (Declaration on Procured Abortion, III, 12). The question is not then one of denying cer­tain women their rights; rather it is one of denying a whole class of men and women, the millions of aborted un­borns, their rights. As long as we are innocent, no one has the right to take our lives. Yet there are those who, on a false understanding of human rights, would take the innocent lives of the un­born. Those who claim that women (or men who consent) have the right to abortion, also claim the right to sin be­cause Catholic morality regards direct abortion as a grave moral evil. 
As Christians we are called to be the salt of the earth. We must not go flat. We have the responsibility to bring Christ and His saving precepts into the world. We cannot be guided in faith and morality by a world that has made leaps and bounds in technological ad­vances, but has also regressed to the renunciation of God and fallen into moral blindness. We must proclaim to the world that Christ is the way, truth and life. And we do this by proclaiming moral truth in all areas and concerning all issues. This means that, with regard to abortion and other issues, we owe it not only to our society, but also to God to proclaim the truth concerning abor­tion. This is the Spirit and letter of Vatican II: The Council proclaims: "Whatever is opposed to life itself, such as any type of murder, genocide, abor­tion, euthanasia and willful self­destruction...all these and others of their like are infamies indeed. They poison human society, but they do more harm to those who do them then to those who suffer the injury. Moreover they are a supreme dishonor to the Creator." ( Gaudium et Spes, 27). 

The Second Vatican Council reaf­firmed the constant teaching of the Church. As Catholics what more do we need besides the word of God as taught to us buy the faith? How can we call ourselves believing Catholics if we dis­agree with something the Church so firmly teaches? One would have to as­sume that many Catholics today are simply unaware of what the Church teaches. They simply do not realize this is not an issue of choice, and that to entertain that direct abortion is morally permissible is completely in­consistent with Christianity. Often, ap­peals are made to compassion when dealing with abortion and other sensi­tive issues; this is correct. Compassion, however, does not mean taking the path of least resistance nor that of maximal convenience. It means, as the Latin root makes clear, to suffer with. Al­ways, we must beseech the mercy of God and ask Him for the grace to over­come our adversities, but we show no compassion--in fact, we do the greatest harm to all involved --when we turn away from the saving precepts of our Lord.

P.O. Box Q 
ROTC inconsistent with Catholic beliefs 
Dear Editor: 

I read with fascination Major S. A. Lindsey's Viewpoint column in the Aug. 26 Observer. While it never achieves precision, the column's apparent design is to express its author's anxiety about a recent examination undergone by the University's ROTC programs, undertaken by twelve University fac­ulty members and underwritten by the University's Provost. Major Lindsey fears that the publicity surrounding the examination and subsequent "Report on Ethical Aspects of the ROTC Pro­gram" might afflict impressionable readers with a suspicion that "the mil­itary is the only profession with moral or ethical challenges." To dispel this, the Major presents an exotic catalogue: mandatory drug testing in the Marine Corps, the military chaplaincy, service fundraising drives, and the oath to defend the Constitution ("a pretty moral and ethical document"). He con­cludes that "Christian values should pose no spiritual dilemma to Notre Dame midshipmen." He describes those of us who have misgivings about the appropriateness of ROTC on a Cath­olic campus as "moralists," and I suspect that his use of the term is derisive. 
The word "killing," the major reminds us, cannot be found in any De­partment of Defense mission state­ment. I don't doubt him. The word is missing from most pro-abortion rheto­ric, too. "Exploiting" is probably ab­sent from Playboy's editorial state­ment of purpose, too. So what? Military organizations are designed to kill people for reasons of state. It may be possible to be simultaneously a Christ­ian and an effective soldier, but it should be crystal clear that military science will always be profoundly at odds with a faith which respects no na­tional boundaries and insists that all human beings, even the major and I, are sons and daughters of the same fa­ther.

Doc's golden discovery 
KENDRA MORRILL accent writer 
Y
ears ago, Doc Pierce sold bottles of a potion called "Golden Discovery," which was actually booze but sure made his patients feel good. 
Today, Doc Pierce's restau­rant will undoubtedly be a golden discovery to those who haven't tried it yet. 
The warm, rustic atmo­sphere of Doc's--which is friendly and casual, yet romantic at the same time-­creates the perfect setting in which to enjoy a relaxed, ex­cellent meal from appetizer to dessert. (For those desir­ing a really intimate meal, Doc's has one booth that seats only two people side by side at the table.) 
One suggestion--make reservations a day in ad­vance. Those without reserva­tions are still seated, but not before a lengthy wait. If you do have reservations and are not seated on time, the Doc­tor will furnish cocktails while you wait. We, however, were seated nearly a half hour before we were supposed to have been seated. 
If perfection is possible in a meal, Doc Pierce's achieved it. We started off the evening with a bottle of Sauvignon Blanc ($9.00), a white wine that would enhance any meal, especially the fish or chicken dishes. 
A huge portion of potato skins ($3.25), topped with melted cheese, bacon bits and served with sour cream, began the meal. The skins were excellent and are ideal for two to share. Other tempt­ing appetizers on the menu are the sauteed mushrooms ($2.45), french onion soup au gratin ($1.95) and cocktail delights ($3.95 or $7.45), which are unpeeled shrimp simmered in beer and avail­able by the quarter or half pound. · 
The entrees alone would be enough to satisfy the hungriest person and are amazingly low-priced for the quantity and quality of the food, including a tossed salad, hot bread and choice of baked potato, steak fries or rice. 
The salads were enormous, covering what would be a normal dinner plate. The bleu cheese dressing was deli­cious, containing large chunks of cheese, and the homemade croutons--deep­fried with parmesan cheese, garlic and seasoning salt-­were the highlight of the salad. 
The orange roughy ($8.95) was absolutely fantastic. The large, mild filet, baked with a sour cream and parmesan cheese topping, was cooked to white, flaky perfection and served with lemon and melted butter on the side. With a baked potato (easily six inches long) served with sour cream and butter, the dinner was one of the best I've ever eaten. 
The chicken mornay ($7.95) was equally delectable and prepared in an equally generous portion. The fresh boneless breast of chicken was sauteed in herb butter and white wine and topped

or over 100 years the Adminis­F tration Building with its brilliant Golden Dome supporting the majes­tic statue of the Virgin Mary has been the heart and the focal point of this University. The statue and dome symbolize the ambitions and dreams of 28-year-old Father Ed­ward Sorin who founded the Univer­sity in 1842 and named it Notre Dame in honor of his special patro­ness, Our Lady. 
According to Thomas J. Schlereth's book, "The University of Notre Dame: A Portrait of Its His­tory and Campus," the story of the Dome begins in 1844 when construc­tion was completed on the first main building. This building was the basis of Father Sorin's young University and the site where the majority of the institution's activities took place. Academic instruction was from elementary to college preparatory, with only about 12 college level stu­dents. 
But Father Sorin envisioned big­ger things for his University. So, in spite of tight finances, he decided to expand Notre Dame in 1863 by reconstucting the original building, and replacing it with a grander, more impressive structure topped by a white dome and statue. 
All of the classrooms, dormitories and faculty sleeping quarters, as ' well as the library, museum and dining halls were situated in the new main building. When fire destroyed the still new main building and four adjacent structures on April 23, 1879, most people assumed that the staggering financial loss would mean the end of Notre Dame. However, the now elderly Sorin was determined not to give up on what he had put his en­tire life into developing. Four days after the fire, he addressed the com­munity and declared his intention to rebuild the University. 
The April 22, 1879 edition of the South Bend Tribune quoted Sorin as saying, "Tomorrow we will begin again and build it bigger; and when it is built, we will put a gold dome on top with a golden statue of the Mother of God so that everyone who comes this way will know to whom we owe whatever great future this place has." 
Fundraising committees were formed immediately, and donations were collected from all over the United States. The following week,

listener to properly place the group somewhere in the musi­cal spectrum. 
It is obvious both from the album notes and the album itself that the group is moving away from its pop­oriented cast into a more jazz and instrumental strain. Yet, the album is named Confes­sions of a Pop Group, which seems to suggest that the music produced on it should be the mainstream. The al­bum notes claim that if we were all conscientious music listeners, this is what we would listen to all the time (a strong statement from a group whose highest Ameri­can chart position is just into the top 60). 
One has to think that Con­fessions indicates an attempt at a lyrical message that will respond to this claim. Unfor­tunately, all too often sub­stance is provided by brood­ing black and white cover shots. Seriousness is all well and good; after all, each gen­eration of bright intellectuals needs someone (or more than one someone) to say nice things nicely. Sooner or later· though, they have to provide consider himself in serious violation of his vow of poverty. 
It used to be that a priest being changed from one parish to another would receive his marching orders on Tuesday. He was expected to fold his tents like the Arabs and silently steal away to his new rectory, reporting to his new boss on Saturday, ready to hear the afternoon confessions. A modern priest might need that much time to get his bar supplies packed and delivered. 
Why must a modern priest spoil himself with the knick­knacks of luxury and im­pedimenta that slow him down more than an albatross around his neck? One priest I know had an excuse for buying a Cadillac: "Noth­ing," he said, "is too good for the Blessed Sacrament;" meaning that when he brings the Eucharist to the sick, the Real Presence needs leg room that you can't find in a cramped little Volkswagen. Who can question this man's respect for Jesus? 
In honesty, I am not so reli­gious. I have pictures I point to when I'm trying toes­tablish my identity as a sensi­tive person deserving of respect. I have conversation pieces that come in handy when I'm tired of talking about myself. I have one or two collector's items that I show to acquaintances, hoping to make them jealous.

I am astounded at the sheer volume of things I own: Lladro figurines, for example. I have 28 of those Spanish porcelains, arranged on shelves that were built to hold them. I have a set of seven Havilland china plates hang­ing on the wall next to the 

Lladros to give the wall color and a balancing richness. 
An old-fashioned priest would never allow his life to be so cluttered with earthly possessions that slow down his mobility. He'd observe the Gospel directive as a wise rule to live his life by: "Don't carry excess luggage, and don't take anything with you that you can't carry easily on your back." 
The old-fashioned priest would consider that owning a stereo, a television set, three radios, four typewriters, doz­ens of records, hundreds of books, plus other miscel-· laneous treasure costing a pretty penny, plus a closet full of clothes which, if stitched together end to end, would cover as much ground as the main tent used in a three-ring circus--the old-style priest, having so much tran­sitory stuff to care for, would

The Administration Build­ing's completed dimensions are 320 feet by 155 feet and from its base to the top of the statue, it towers 206 feet above the ground, the highest building on campus. 

For over a its century of existence the Administration Building has had more diverse uses than any other building at Notre Dame. The base­ment, which was once used for trunk storage, classrooms, lavatories, and dining halls now is the location of the purchasing depar­tment, the cashier's office, the ad­missions office and the comptrol­ler's office. 
On the second floor, where the main entrance is located, the presi­dent's and vice president's offices, sleeping rooms and parlors were once where Information Services is today. The Provost's Office was formerly the University Parlor where concerts and receptions were held. 
The third and fourth floors were used for dormitories. In addition, the fourth floor housed the library. Architecture, sculpture, mechanical drawing and photography were taught on the fifth floor, which is now closed to the public due to fire hazards. 
In addition, the fifth floor was the location of the University museum and various academic departments. Finally, there were originally two chapels and 22 classrooms scattered throughout the building. 
The history of the multipurpose Administration Building is filled with numerous traditions. For ex­ample, The use of the main front steps used to be restricted to only visitors, faculty and alumni. Com­mencement exercises were held in the main building with a procession down the front steps. Only after successfully completing a degree program was the graduate con­idered equal enough to ascend the steps and smoke on the porch with his professors. 
Over the years there have been several proposals to demolish or reconstruct the Administration Building, but just as Father Sorin's dream of establishing a prominent Catholic University refused to be squelched by various hardships, the Dome remains standing, as a bright symbol of our University's tradition and future. 
Sizzle without substance 
a little steak with their sizzle. The sizzle is of course the delicious sound, but the steak is hardly enough to feed a soul on the Lost Hope Diet. "To busy living in the past to live in the future" (from the title track) doesn't sound as if a great thinker is in our midst. 
None of the oh-so­considered doodlings offered on this album approach the much more lively, fun spirit of the group's earlier songs, especially their mild Ameri­can hit "Shout to the Top." 
Let's not forget, though, that sizzle is still important. On this level The Style Coun­cil seems very well named. Style drips from this album. The vocals are haunting on the ballads and inspiring on the upbeat tunes, especially the female voice that seems to have appeared from nowhere. (There is no men­tion, only a photo of her to be found on the notes.) The in­

strumental pieces are clever and keep your attention in a way that "the Wave" doesn't. The songs are just plain beau­tiful. There is no other way to describe them. Plenty of strings and piano parts mix and accent quality harmonies--something rare in music today. Without a doubt, Confessions has true technical excellence. 
The quality music makes it hard to dislike this group, even if they lack true sub­stance. After all, finding sub­
. stance is not an easy thing to do. Nevertheless, there is something scary about liking this album. On the one hand, it is wonderful listening. The music is pleasantly moody. It constantly brings to mind well-dressed people sipping cocktails and discussing Allan Bloom. But Style Council is the kind of gin-and-tonic music your parents probably would like and, let's face it, that's pretty frightening.

My nephew already has a watch, he tells me; if he considers my watch expen­dable, he is not apt to be ex­cited over the trophy that honors me as the Senior Class Fellow of 1973. Lladros and unicorn plates will be someth­ing his wife can enjoy, so I guard them as heirlooms charming enough for the fam­ily to hold onto. Maybe my superiors, reading this column, will regard it as a last will and testament, naming my sister's boy as the beneficiary of the left-over valuables in my life that the Holy Cross Community doesn't want. 
A Bible verse I memorized as a child is appropiately didactic: "A good name is rather to be chosen than great riche, and a loving na­ture is better than silver and gold." I believe the verse; however, I wouldn't mind 
"Celibacy can be 
a real pain if you 
don't have rela­
tives who want to 
inherit your watch 
and the brass 
plaques with your 
name on them." 
having great riches, either silver or gold, or valuable property I can't take with me, interest-bearing bonds that I can leave in my will. I gave up all such forms of earthly vanity when I took the vow of poverty. As a re­placement, I substituted deli­cate items that I'm afraid of breaking, instead of working to acquire a spotless reputa­tion and a Christ-like disposi­tion. Now I'm punished by worry over thieves breaking in or moths corrupting the treasure-trove I have set my heart on. I could end up like Marley's ghost wearing chains made from boxes and ledgers he has to drag around through dusty rooms he is doomed to haunt. 
Does God really mind if I keep a few pretty things that will become hand-me-downs to my nearest, dearest rela­tive? If I thought He did, I would hold a garage sale, the proceeds of which would go to the missions. Tired as I am from dragging breakables from one dorm to another, I would give them up happily, if I felt that I needed to do so, to save my soul. 
Coventry Patmore has a poem he called "The Toys," about a child who has cried himself to sleep after being harshly punished: " ... on a table drawn beside his bedHe had put within his reach!A box of counters and a red­veined stone/A piece of glass abraded by the beach/And six or seven shells/A bottle with bluebells/And two French cop­per coins, ranged there with careful art;ro comfort his sad heart." 
The boy's father, grieving because he unjustly struck the lad, prays that when he himself lies asleep in death, God will look on him pater­nally as He remembers "of what joys1Ie made his toys." Instead of chastising him for his childishness, he hopes God will treat him with tenderness and kindness. 
May God think gently of me, wearing myself out over playthings which couldn't be more of a nuisance if they were the rock that old Sisyphus kept pushing up the hill, so that it could roll back down on him as soon as he reached the top.

continued from page 8 with mornay sauce, moz­zerella and parmesan cheese. The sauce, butter and cheeses came through enough to add a delicious flavor but without drowning the tender chicken. As a final touch to an excel­lent dinner, the menu offers two desserts, Chocolate Frozen Yogurt Fudge Pie ($1.95) or New York Style Cheese Cake ($1.75) with Strawberries (add $.30), which is as good as any cheese cake one might find in the The Big Apple. 
As well as milk, hot or iced tea, soft drinks and coffee, Doc Pierce's offers specialty drinks and an adequate wine list. 
The service was excellent-­very attentive and conscien­tious without being overbear­ing and rushed. Our waitress, Dina, even took the time to relate some of the history of Doc's, which is owned by the same owners as The Em­porium. 
The original Doc Pierce may not be selling his "Gol­den Discovery" anymore, but the restaurant makes up for him. It sure makes its pa­trons feel good.

Irish still unsure about kicking, punting positions 
By THERESA KELLY Assistant Sports Editor 
Take five guys with a grand total of two minutes and 39 seconds of playing time, and what you've got is a rebuilding project. 
Three walk-ons, a former basketball player and one scholarship holder make up the kicking game for Vinny Cer­rato, the Irish recruiting coord­inator who works with the punters and kickers during the season. 
The key to the Irish kicking game (and everyone else's) is consistency. 
"When we all started out, we knew what we needed most was consistency," Cerrato said of his inexperienced crew. "I have to say that every one of those guys has really im­proved." 
This is the second consecu­tive starting-from-scratch season for Cerrato. Last year, Ted Gradel replaced Irish record-holder (field goals in a game, season and career, at­tempts in a season, career percentage and season percentage) John Carney at placekicker, and Vince Phelan 
Baseball roundup 
won the punting job with ex­actly one collegiate punt on his resume. 
Phelan ended up setting a career mark for punting average last season, but both 

Reggie Ho 
Gradel and Phelan have been lost to gr:;tduation. 
Stepping into Gradel's shoes (which probablv will be too big for him) is junior Reggie Ho, of Kaneohe, Hawaii, who had one successful point-after last season. 
"I'm not exactly big in stat­
ure," the 5-5, 135-pounder said. 
Ho's deadly accuracy may be combined with the stronger foot of sophomore Billy Hack­ett, the only scholarship kicker on the team. 
"I came in very confident this fall," Hackett, a native of Sarasota, Fla., said. "I started having trouble with field goals inside the 30, but I've corrected the problem this past week." 
According to Cerrato, Hack­ett, also the only kicker with game experience (2:39) and Ho may share the kicking duties this season, with Ho taking the extra points and short field goals and Hackett making the longer attempts. 
"Billy and Reggie have both come very far," Cerrato said. "Reggie has always been pretty consistent, but he's got­ten even better, and Billy has a strong leg. There's a good possibility that we'll be working with both of them, seeing them in the game depending on the situation." 
Two seniors and a sophomore are battling for the puntingjob, and again, consistency is the key. Sophomore Jim Sexton of South Bend has been the most consistent this fall, according to Cerrato. 
If the first game were today, what would happen? 

Tigers lose, _Red Sox win 
Associated Press 
DETROIT -Rob Deer's two­run single keyed a five-run fifth inning and Mike Birkbeck won his eighth game since being recalled from the minors as the Milwaukee Brewers beat the Detroit Tigers 6-2 Thursday night. 
The first-place Tigers, who have lost eight of their last 10, saw their lead in the American League East drop to 1 1-2 games over the idle Boston Red Sox.

UM's QB is still unknown 
Associated Press 
ANN ARBOR, Mich. -The jury's still out on Michigan's starting quarterback, with five players vying for the position ­six, if you count coach Bo Schembechler's tongue-in­cheek candidacy. 
Schembechler said Thursday that he hasn't decided who will call the signals against Notre 
Dame  on  Sept.  10  in  South  
Bend, Ind.  
"You don't  want  to  put  a  

young guy in a bad position," Schembechler told a news con­ference. "I would say we're probably leaning a little bit toward a veteran. But that doesn't mean that's chiseled in stone." 
Demetrius Brown, a junior, started 10 of 12 games last year but threw 16 interceptions, seven at Michigan State. The other quarterbacks are junior Michael Taylor and red-shirt freshmen Wilbur Odom, Eric Bush and Ken Sollom.

Blue Jays 5, Rangers 1 
TORONTO -Jimmy Key pitched a six-hitter for eight in­nings and Ernie Whitt homered, leading the Toronto Blue Jays to a 5-1 victory over the Texas Rangers Thursday night. 
Key, 9-4, struck out five and walked two before being relieved by Tom Henke to start the ninth. Key outdueled knuckleballer Charlie Hough, 11-15, who gave up six hits, four walks and five runs in 5 1-3 in­nings. 
Tigers get O's Lynn, but not for post-season 
DETROIT -Veteran out­fielder Fred Lynn, obtained by the Detroit Tigers as pennant 
insurance, cannot qualify for postseason play because he missed a deadline for reporting to the club by 10 minutes, team officials said Thursday. 
"It's not even a question of 'may not' " be eligible, Tigers spokesman Greg Shea said. "He is not." 
Red Sox 4, Angels 2 
ANAHEIM, Calif. -Larry Parrish's two-run homer keyed a four-run sixth inning that lifted the Boston Red Sox to a 4-2 victory over the California Angels Thursday night. 
With Boston trailing 2-0 on Wally Joyner's two-run homer in the fifth, Dwight Evans led off the sixth with a single off Terry Clark, 6-3. Evans moved around to third base on a pair of infield groundouts before scoring on Todd Benzinger's single.

"I don't think we'd punt," Sexton said. 
"Really, though, I think I've 
progressed well," he contin­
ued. "But then again, so has 
everyone else. We're all 

Sean Connor 
working, all getting better at the same pace." 
Also in contention for the punting job is Sean Connor from Ziegler, Illinois. Mter three seasons on the basketball team, Connor gave up his final season to try out for football. 
"It was a tough decision," Connor said. "I've missed foot­ball. I haven't really played football since high school, so I'm really excited about this season." 
Pete Hartweger of Creve Coeur, Mo., is the final maq in contention for the punting job. 
"It's been a great fall," he said. "Everything's gone bet­ter than I expected. Starting out, I had no idea what would happen; I just knew that every­one had a good chance." 
For both the positions, the competition is intense. 
"Both those guys have been punting well, especially Jim," Connor said of his competition. "It's going to be tough to get the job." 
"Any one of us could be playing at a different school," Sexton said. 
Cerrato said a team can't overlook the importance of the kicking game. 
"Having a great player on the kicking team is as valuable as having an offensive or de­fensive star," he said. "Something like one in five plays involves kicking, so you can't underestimate the value. Ifyou get the field position, you gain a real advantage. 
"It takes some good people to make the kicking game a weapon instead of a liability."

Becker's Open ends quickly 
Darren (not Ce Ce) Cahill ousts 5th seed in straight sets 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK -Boris Becker was upset by a lightly-regarded Australian in straight sets at the U.S. open Thursday while Pam Shriver was ousted by the third best tennis player in the Soviet Union. 
Steffi Graf and Martina Nav­ratilova kept form in perspec­tive and cruised into the third round. 
Becker, a West German seeded No. 5 and still seeking his first U.S. Open title, was given an unexpected exit by Darren Cahill 6-3, 6-3, 6-2. 
Cahill is no relation to Notre Dame sophomore Ce Ce Cahill of the Irish women's tennis team. 
"What can you do? it's the 
U.S. Open and you have to do your best," the two-time Wimbledon champion said. "It's just that my best wasn't good enough today." 
Becker's sore feet were sprayed with a freezing sub­stance several times during the match, but it didn't help the fifth seed. 
"When I was pushing for a couple of shots, all of a sudden the pain came very strongly. Then I couldn't play the next few points," said Becker, who withdrew from last month's 
Hoosiers

tween the two teams. The Hoosiers lead the Irish 3-1 in the lifetime series. 
Notre Dame counters the Hoosiers with eight returning monogram winners including five starters from last season's North Star Conference cham­pions. Although the team has posted two consecutive 30-win seasons, it has yet to make an appearance in the NCAA post­season tournament. Head Co­ach Art Lambert has set his sights on the tournament by Canadian Open because of 

similar foot problems. 
"All he had to do was hit the 
ball a little away from the cen­
ter and I couldn't reach it. I 
don't think it was a difficult 
match for him." 
Brad Gilbert, who beat Be­
cker in the fourth round at last 
year's Open, was an upset vic­
tim Thursday. The No. 11 seed 
lost to Jaime Yzaga of Peru 1-6, 
6-0, 6-4, 6-2. 
Third-seeded Stefan Edberg 
breezed past Guy Forget of 
France 7-5, 6-1, 6-3, while No. 2 
Mats Wilander got a scare from 
hard-serving Kevin Curren 
before prevailing 3-6, 6-3, 6-2, 
3-6, 6-3. 

"It's tough against Curren 
because he hits so hard," said 
Wilander, who is now 12-1 in 
five-set Grand Slam matches. 
"I couldn't get any rhythm." 
Shriver was eliminated by 
Leila Meskhi 4-6, 6-1, 6-4. 
Graf, going for the first 
Grand Slam sweep since 1970, 
beat Manon Bollegraf of the 
Netherlands 6-1,6-0, while Nav­
ratilova, seeking her third 
straight Open title, ousted Elly 
Hakami 6-2, 6-1. 
Meskhi, a 20-year-old who is ranked behind Natalia Zvereva and Larisa Savchenko in the Soviet Union, rallied from a 2-4 deficit in the final set and dug 
handing the team a grueling schedule that includes nine of last year's top 14 teams. 
As for Indiana, the Irish hope to avenge last year's loss. 
"Last year's match against Indiana," said Coach Lambert, "was our worst hitting game of the season. 
"Opening with a win can do more for a successful season than anything." continued Lambert. "The key to our game is passing and ball con­trol, without them, it will be a long season." The nucleus of the team is made up of seniors. Team captain Maureen Shea will handle much of the outside 
out of a 0-40 hole in the final 
game. 
"The idea was to stay as 
close as possible, not lose my 
serve and take chances on 
Shriver's serve," Meskhi said 
through her translator, Soviet 
team coach Olga Morozova. 
Also advancing to the third round were fifth-seeded Gabriela Sabatini, No. 10 Claudia Kohde-Kilsch and No. 11 Zina Garrison. 
Sabatini beat American Beverly Bowes 6-2, 6-0, Kohde­Kilsch eliminated Raffaela Reggi of Italy 6-2, 2-6, 6-4, and Garrison topped Helen Kelesi of Canada 3-6, 7-5, 6-0 
Men's winners included third-seeded Stefan Edberg, No. 8 Miloslav Mecir and No. 10 Henri Leconte. 
Edberg beat Guy Forget of France 7-5, 6-1, 6-3, Mecir defeated American Sammy Giammalva 6-4, 6-1, 7-6 (7-5), and Leconte downed Barry Moir of South Africa 6-0, 6-4, 6-4. 
Shriver won two tourna­ments and reached three other finals before coming down with mononucleosis just before Wimbledon. She has struggled ever since, reaching a low point last month with a loss in Los Angeles to 15-year-old Amy Frazier.

Aggie QB back home at LSU 
Richardson returning to his roots for A&M-LSU skirmish 
Associated Press 
LSU's official homecoming isn't scheduled until Oct. 29. But it will be a homecoming of a different sort Saturday night when Texas A&M visits Baton Rouge. 
Bucky Richardson, A&M's sophomore quarterback, grew up seven miles from Tiger Stadium and ''always dreamed about playing there.'' 
But as he grew older, Rich­ardson's dream of starring in an LSU uniform began to fade. He signed with Texas A&M and started five games last season as a true freshman. At LSU, which already had an outstand­ing quarterback in Tom Hod­son, he probably would have been redshirted. 
This will be Richardson's first visit to Tiger Stadium in an enemy uniform. LSU coach Mike Archer says he made the right choice of schools. 

"In recruiting Bucky, I stressed to him that he had to make the decision that was right for him," Archer said. "He made the right decision to go to Texas A&M. He led them to the Southwest Conference championship and the Cotton Bowl last year." 
Richardson has no regrets about leaving home. 
"You grow and yoli mat1,1re and your horizons are a lot broader once you take your recruiting trips and see every­thing," Richardson said. "It's just a learning process, and I felt it was best for me to move on. 
"There are other programs in the country just like the one you grow up around. I didn't really realize that until I got out and visited and saw the sup­port of all those schools. 
"I think the mature players are able to pack up and leave home because they know that's the best thing for them. I'm not saying that people who stay home are immature. I'm just saying that you have to realize what's the best for you. The best for me was coming to A&M." 
USC 34, BC 7 
NEWTON, Mass. -Rodney Peete's passing set up two touchdowns by Aaron Emanuel and a pair of field goals by Quin Rodriguez Thursday night as eighth-ranked Southern Cal whipped Boston College 34-7 in a 1988 football opener. 
Peete, a fifth-year senior who led USC to the Pac-10 champi­onship last year, picked apart BC's secondary while complet­ing 21 of 33 passes for 271 yards and one touchdown.
