In Brief 
"The Bomb" Is a fake hand grenade handed out for the worst question asked in a Harvard Business School class. Police who evacuated the building yesterday and called in the bomb squad after "The Bomb" wasfound in a student's mailbox had some questions of their own. David Moyer, the winner ofthe weekly award, said he put the phony grenade in his mailbox because he had lost his room key playing soccer and needed to buy a new one. The bomb squad loaded "The Bomb" into an armored trailer and towed it away. Things were straightened out within an hour, Moyer said. -AP

across campus, students are slamming their books closed, turning their calculators off and pulling the plug on their electric typewriters. They have logged a pact that cable television could have on social life at couple of hours of homework and now it is time for a Notre Dame.

that cable television would be a poor addition to campus life. As nice as the major networks are, the similar programming of ABC, CBS and NBC can get a little monotonous at times. After all, there is more being offered on television today than silly sitcoms and over· sexed soaps. Cable channels offer an alternative. 
But just how much of an alternative will students receive? 
There are literally hundreds of cable channels available for interested subscribers. Most channels, like ESPN the Cable News Network and the USA Network, featu;e popular and basically unobjectionable material. But what about networks which offer more controver­sial programs? What about Cinemax and Showtime, which mix soft-core pornography and violent films with their usual fare of major movies? And what about the Playboy channel?

The mere fact that a student has taken the initiative to look into this issue is cause for enthusiasm. Addition· ally, the administration seems to be keeping an open mind with regard to cable. Vice President for Student Affairs Father David Tyson has hesitations but offered support for the idea, Willis said. 
All in all, it is an exciting proposition. So if Notre Dame ever does get cable television, the first TV party on campus will be in my room.

Study Help Program gives friendship, too 
ByJOHN FUSSA 
News Staff 
The Neighborhood Study Help Program returned this year stronger than ever, with 250 to 300 Notre Dame and Saint Mary's students con­tributing to the academic and social development oflocal children. 
According to the program's co­presidents Debbie Doherty and Tom Pigott, campus awareness of the program is a result of the strong commitment to the program by those involved. 
In order to solve the problems of tutor absence and program disor­ganization that occurred so fre­quently last year, Secretary Martha Massman, Doherty and Pigott spent the summer reorganizing the program. They said they considered this year crucial for the program. The program's staff determined that commitment should be their most important priority. 
All volunteers are aware of this emphasis and most share the dedica­tion, said Piggot. 
Most problems stem from oc­casional absences by the children, very successful thus far, and tutor response has been overwhelmingly positive, she said. 
The 12 tutoring centers throug­hout South Bend are filled to capacity with both students and tutors, Doherty said, and with more volunteers and successful fundraisers the program will expand 
The program often goes beyond 
its one-hour tutoring sessions, the 
co-presidents said. They said stu­
dents and tutors often participate in 
skating parties, picnics, and movies. 
Sometimes personal relationships evolve. Doherty, while tutoring as a junior, developed a close personal relationship with the 16-year-old student she had been assigned. They grew very dose, and the girl often phoned and visited Doherty at Notre Dame. 
When the student ~carne In­volved in a complicated and confus­ing personal situation, she turned to Doherty for advice and comfort. The situation was resolved In what the student and Doherty consider the best possible way.

PLO says 60 killed in Israeli raid which retaliated for holiday deaths 
HAMAM PLAGE, Tunisia -Streak­ing I, 500 mlles across the Mediter­ranean Sea, Israeli warplanes bombed Palestine Liberation Or­ganization headquarters in a Tunis suburb yesterday and the PLO said as many as 60 people were killed. 
The jets swept low over the coast to strike Yasser Arafat's headquarters only 12 miles south of the Tunisian capital. Although Arafat escaped the devastating attack, the Israeli bombs destroyed his political headquarters. his residence and the homes ofseveral PLO officials. 
Dressed in military fatigues and appearing distressed, Arafat and an aide inspected the damage and talked with the wounded. Arafat has made his main headquarters in Tunisia since he was driven out of Beirut by the Israelis in 1982. 
In Tel Aviv, Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin told a briefing the raid was to retaliate for the Yom Kippur slayings of three Israelis aboard a yacht in Cyprus. He called it a war­ning to terrorists "that the long arm of the Israel Defense Forces will reach them wherever they are." 
Although a caller claiming to represent the PLO group "Force 1 7" c'aimed responsibility for the attack In Cyprus, the PLO has denied in­volvement. 
Lt. Gen. Moshe Levy, Israel's chief of staff, told a briefing in Tel Aviv that as many as 50 people were killed in Tuesday's raid. Medical sources In Tunis put the death toll at

Worry follows farmers to farm 'World's Fair' 
Aseoclated Pre KNIGHTSTOWN, Ind. -Farmer Tony Cain attended yesterday's opening of the 1985 Farm Progress Show, but he was shopping for in­formation that will help keep him afloat another year rather than a shiny red new combine. "I don't have any money to make any purchases," said Cain, 30, who with his brother farms 900 acres of corn and soybeans near Brookston in White County. "We just have to make do with what we got." The Farm Progress Show has often been billed as the "World's Fair of Agriculture," and the director ofthis year's event, Kevin Wheeler, describes it as "a selling atmosphere, not a fair." Farmers and exhibitors, though, talk with uncertainty about what the future holds for them, and for many, making new investments isn't pos­sible or wise. "Our bank and several banks in our area are very nervous, not just about our farm, but other farms as well," Cain said. "This year we had to break even or show some profit or 
they  were  going  to  think  about

Planes still 'safest way' 
Aseoclated Preu 

WASHINGTON While ack­nowledging problems in air safety, the chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board said yesterday that airliners are still "the safest way to travel" and the public should not be unduly alarmed by the rash ofaviation accidents this year. 
But NTSB chairman Jim Burnett told the Senate Commerce aviation subcommittee that the Federal Avia­tion Administration has failed to respond to changes brought on by airline deregulation, including the rapid increase in the number of small airlines and increased air traf­fic. 
He said FAA inspectors are not only too few in number but often

curred. "I am convinced that we 
express our gratitude for both by 
continuing the dialogue with the 
world, solidifying the social ministry 
in the Church, and stating publicly .. 
. on a range of social issues which 
bear upon the human dignity of the 
person." 
Bernardin turned the discussion 
over to O'Connor, who built on the 
topic ofpastoral letter methodology 
by speaking on and from the 
development of the second draft of 
the pastoral on the economy. 
O'Connor began by telling the audience about his recent visits to poverty-stricken Ethiopia, Nicaragua, and the Dominican Republic, which led to a passage in the bishops' letter: "the tenets of Chuch teaching take on new morality when we see poverty in our world." 
A precipitating factor of the pas­toral on the economy was a sermon by the pope in Yankee Stadium in 1979, when he said, "riches and freedom create a special obligation and a special dignity ofevery human person." 
"We're not trying to indict the wealthy for being wealthy," he said. "Christ demands attention to the poor that is more than token." 
O'Connor explained the develop­ment of the first draft of the letter, saying that the model for the pas-rowing has built steadily for two or three years, he said. Combine that with a surplus ofcrops and declining prices, and he wonders what field he'll be in five or 10 years from now, hesah:l. 
"The small farmer won't be around someday," Cain said. "Sometimes you can't get to sleep at night because you're thinking about it." 
Jim Lacina, Massey-Ferguson Inc.'s product marketing manager for tractors, was more upbeat about the crowd's attitude as curious farmers examined the company's new rotary combine, which lists for more than 1118,000 and costs anot­her 130,000 to outfit for the farm fields. 
"It's not a negative attitude, and that's a positive development in it· self," Lacina said. "I guess they're shopping and looking for something to break here (for the better) in the future. 
"There are some very interested people. The majority of shoppers just are seeing what's out there so they can keep up with the industry," Lacina said. 
The show, whose site alternates between Illinois, Indiana and Iowa, is being held on two farms just west of Knightstown and north ofU.S. 40. It drew an estimated 70,000 people yesterday, and organizers have predicted a total attendance near 300,000 before its end tomorrow. 
have "a very gentlemenly" relation­ship with the airlines they are supposed to monitor. Breakdowns in communications and coordina­tion among air traffic controllers, especially in towers ofbusy airports, also remain "very disturbing," he said. 
The hearing was called to ex­amine a variety of alr safety issue against a backdrop of an unprece­dented string of airline accidents worldwide that has claimed more than 1,600 lives this year. 
Asked whether air travel was safe, Burnett, whose agency investigates airline accidents, replied: "I don't think there's any basis for the avia­tion consumer to be alarmed over a degradation ofsafety." 
toral on peace was used. Interviews were conducted with experts, and "we produced an imperfect docu­ment . . . and pleaded for honest responses to it." 
The bishops received I0,000 pages of response, "generally most supportive, and recognizing the need for something to be done." · 
The second draft of the letter will not be released until Oct. 7, but O'Connor quoted parts of It, saying it "looked at the broadest spectrum ofproposals." 
O'Connor said the best moral judgments of the bishops said that the positions of the letter "deserve deference, sincere study, contribu­tions by readers, and perhaps rejec­tion ..." 
"But they plead for a hearing, a reading and praying," he continued. 
There are five chapters to the second draft of the letter, with topics including: The Church and. the future of the U.S. economy, Christian vocation in the world today, right to life, labor unions, un­employment, minorities and poverty. 
O'Connor ended by stressing the Importance of the Church teachings in the world. "The ministry of the Church has given firsthand knowledge ofhopes and struggles of all in the world," he said. 
"It is our commitment, our hope, and our dream to do what we pos­sibly can do to bring about for all people what we call the American dream," he continued, calling for a "plea for love" to bring this about. 

about 30 and said about 100 were injured. Israel has bombed guerrilla bases 

pl~es bombed an Iraqi nuclear reactor near Baghdad. Israel also mounted the airborne mission in 1976 and rescued hostages held at Entebbe airport in Uganda. 
Tuesday's raid provoked expres­sions of anger from other Arab countries and Tunisia called for ac­tion by the U.N. Security Council. 
In Washington, the Reagan ad­ministration suggested it considered the raid an act ofself-defense. 
State Department spokesman Charles Redman said, "As a matter of principle, it is our view that it is legitimate self defense to respond appropriately to acts of terrorism." But he said the administration did not have all the facts. 
Redman denied a report by Libyan radio that the Israeli planes were launched from an American aircraft carrier and said the United States was not informed before the raid. 
Israeli officials would not say how many or what kind of planes were involved in the raid, but Israeli military sources said the aircraft were refueled over the Mediter­ranean during their 3,000-mile mis­sion. 
Witnesses in Hamam Plage said they saw four jets conduct bombing runs. One PLO spokesman said six Phantom jets were involved while another PLO spokesman mentioned eight jets. The Israeli arsenal con­tains Phantom jets, but also more modern F-16 and D-15 warplanes. 
The only target missed in the raid was the PLO's communications center, but there was a large bomb crater nearby.

r ~ People should consider the implication of labels 

The latest movement in Washington has set its sights on rating rock music lyrics. I do not think this is right and I felt compelled to urge all open-minded persons to seriously consider the implications of this new movement to "control" rock lyrics. 
Tim Adams 

guest column 
First, what the Parent's Music Resource Center is asking the record industry to do is akin to asking it to cut off its own right arm. The Resource Center demands that all records contain some sort universal ratings code. Okay so who is going to rate the records? There are approximately 2,500 al­bums released a year with an average of say, nine or ten on each one. That works out to about 25,000 songs a year which need to be judged as "X," "R," "PG," or whatever; and the 
r judging process can be nothing but com-
r 
pletely subjective when it comes to songs with innuendos. Mandyck compared this sys­tem to that used by the Motion Picture As­sociation of America. There are only about 325 rums rated each year. The Resource Center wants this system to be performed voluntarily by the recording industry, which is an expensive and time consuming process in itself. 
Second, the Resource Center also demands that lyrics be printed on the outside jacket ofa record, so that parents can "approve" of what their child buys. This is ridiculous. Record labels do not have control over lyrics and whether or not they can be printed; the publishing companies do.Just look on any old record with lyrics included and see where it reads, "All lyrics reprinted with permission." )ust getting lyrics printed is a logistical mess of red tape. 
Third, the Resource Center want record labels to make lyrics available to radio sta­tions, so that they can decide whether or not to play the songs. Again, another costly and ineffective move; the FCC already regulates what can and cannot be said over the airwaves. If your child can detect innuendos in Sheena Easton's "Sugar Walls," then he or she is past being affected by such lyrics. Un­less, ofcourse, you have neglected to instill in your child a sense of what is right or wrong, normal or perverse. Ifa child has been taught these things at an early age, then he or she should not be swayed by cuss words or whatever. The same thing applies to Prince's much cited "Darling Nikki." If a child knows what "masturbating" means, then he or she should recognize that it is something normal. The more you hide things from children, the more they are going to want to find out about them. 
Last, and most importantly, I think what the Resource Center wantsis censorship, and that scares the hell out ofme. Ifa record is given an "R" rating, for example, radio stations might make it a policy never to play anything from it.

r P.O.Box Q 
Faulty analysis made in Safranek's column 
DearEditor: 

I lament with Stephen Safranek's view in his column on Sept.30, that the Sacrament of Penance is a neglected celebrationin this time of the Church's life, but I lament even more his mistaken theology about the sacrament and his half-hearted analysis ofits demise. 
Among his mistakes are the following. First, Lent is not "the time offasting and preparation in anticipation ofChrist)esus's resurrection;" it is a season of baptismal renewal for the Christian people in light ofthe resurrection of Christ which has already occurred. 
Further, we cannot "make sacrifices to God in reparation" for our sins, because nothing we do can influence God's intention of salva­tion for us; we can only accept and rejoice in his gracious gift of mercy. Christ gave the Church no "explicit admonition" to institute Penance; the Church has simply extended Christ's mercy and forgiveness in its mission (lnd sacramental practice. 
Finally, Penance is not the "Sacrament of Reconciliation;" it is one ofat.least three such sacraments, joined with Baptism and yes, the Eucharist. 
These mistakes of the first two paragraphs aside, Safranek's hope in the future ofPenance would have been better served if he had spoken with Stacy Bonanni, whose column followed his, rather than reflecting on the half­hour confessions of nuns. (Did he ever con­sider that the priest may have been brow-beating the woman?) Bonanni's call to justice, that is, the restoration of right relationships in Christ, is the key to the revitalization ofPenance in the Church's life. 
The core of the celebration of Penance is that our commitment to right our wrong relationships with our sisters and brothers in the Church, in the world, with nature and with God, is met with God's gifts ofmercy and forgiveness. It is a celebration of God's ever­lasting love and the beginning ofour renewed life in Christ. Penance is nothing more -and nothing less -than recommitting ourselves to the life and responsibilities of our baptism into Christ. 
The renewal of Penance, then, will depend less on meditating about the confessions of nuns, and more on meditating about the Gospel of Christ which points us in the ways of justice and peace with our sisters and brot­hers, and thus with our God.

Separate schools enjoy unique opportunities 
DearEditor: 
In light of recent discussion of who's who, and what's what, we decided to write a letter. To begin, we must say that Notre Dame stu­dents are Notre Dame students, and Saint Mary's students are Saint Mary's students. We have a lot to be proud ofas individual schools and as a community. We all should be thankful that we have advantages of both a small col­lege and a large university. 
We are one community of two schools which has clubs, plays, workshops, fundraisers, masses, classes, choirs and social events together. While we are not one school, we have unique opportunities ofbeing able to share these strengths and capabilities toget­her and grow with them. 
There always will be disagreements over who's who and what's what, but we think it is best to remember that we are very lucky to have the benefits ofeach school. 
What more can we say?

Thank you, Ann Pettifer, once again for a fine letter to the editor. I am glad to see that The Observer continues to provide a place for people to express issues of injustice. Your revelatory denouncement of patriarchy and sexism is one that is most welcome and must be heard by all. 
Although your critique may be uncom­fortable for some to hear, for many more it is refreshing and inspiring. I believe that you, as the first woman student here at Notre Dame, have been a good role model for other women here. I hope University members can

Big record chain stores like Musicland might refuse to stock records with "bad" ratings. That is censorship. Okay so you say, "Well, the artists just have to learn not to put any of­fensive material on an album." What happens to freedom ofexpression, or artistic integrity? They are thrown out the window, just be­cause a group of well-connected Washington women decide they do not like what Judas Priest said or what Prince did on stage. 
It is interesting to note that the Resource Center does have some power to force the Recording Association of America to bend, simply because the husbands of the Resource Center members, some ofwhom are congres­smen, can veto the Recording Association's proposed law to issue a tax on blank tape sales if they do not conform. The Recording As­sociation is damned if they do, and damned if they don't. 
Ah, ain't that America.

Help Mexic~ City begin to pick up the pieces 
DearEditor: 

Mexico City is a city of hope, brotherhood and solidarity. Every citizen is giving his/her best to help save lives, give shelter, feed and clothe those that were hurt by the earthquakes. 
The downtown area of the city was very badly hurt (less than one-sixth of the metropolitan area). The majority of the build­ings that collapsed were offices, and because of the hour, many people were in them. 
The proportion ofdeaths is very small, less than 5,000 lost lives in a city of 17 million in­habitants. 
I am sure that ifyou had been close by, you would be giving us aid. 
Because of the distance, all you can do is help collect funds to help reconstruct our city, our hospitals, our schools, our homes. Maybe the International Student Organiza­tion, together with some of the other clubs, could coordinate the fund raising. They can contact the Mexican Consulate in Chicago to receive instructions as to how to send the money to the fund for reconstruction. 
In name of my city, I thank you in advance 
for your help.

Senior walk -on 

Hard work pays off for Monahan 
By MARlYSTRASEN 
Sports Writer 

As far as raw talent is concerned, Notre Dame fullback Tom Monahan is not among the nation's best. But weakness in the ability category is not about to stop this senior from succeeding. 
In short, he's a winner. 

"JudgingTom on his ability alone, you might not expect him to play college football," says Irish assistant head coach Mal Moore, "but that's before you take a look at how hard he works and his dedication to the game." 
During his senior year at Arcola High School in Arcola, W., Monahan did not appear destined to wear the blue and gold for Notre Dame. Al­though he rushed for better than 1,300 yards and earned all-league status, he was not recruited by the Irish. 
"I was looked at by a few Division II schools," Monahan says, "but the offers stopped coming when I told them I was going to Notre Dame. I wanted to walk on. I wanted to see if I could play big-time college foot­ball." 
The choice was a natural one for the 5-10, 210-pounder. His father Tim is a former Irish football player, and his uncle Jim was captain ofthe basketball team in 1967. Playing football for Notre Dame was some­thing he wanted to do, and that's ex­actly what he did. 
"I was invited to join the prep team as soon as practice started," he says. "They already had looked at some films ofme and had decided to keep me around. (The prep team) wasn't too bad. I hoped to get my chance to move up when (Mark) Brooks and (Chris) Smith left. I knew I couldn't beat them out." 
Monahan was given his chance earlier, however, carrying the ball twice for 1 7 yards in Notre Dame's 55-14 thrashing of Colorado last season. With the graduation of Brooks and Smith last spring, Monahan is behind only sophomore Frank Starns on the depth chart this fall. 
Moore can only praise the efforts ofhis fullback. 
:·Irish hope to rebound ·today against Falcons 
ByPHRWOLF 
Assistant SportS Editor 

The Notre Dame soccer team will play host to Bowling Green on Alumni Field this afternoon at 4 in an attempt to continue the rescue ofits 2-7-1 season. 
The 2-5-2 Falcons are comingoff a tie last weekend with national powerhouse Akron, so they are ex­pected to be flying high. 
The Irish are coming off a weekend which saw an overtime victory at Wisconsin-Green Bay and a narrow loss at Northwestern. Today's meeting with the Falcons will be the fourth for the two teams. Bowling Green leads the series, 2-1, with Notre Dame owning the most recent victory, 2-1 in 1980. 
Overcoming the negative feelings from the disappointing game at Northwestern probably will be the biggest task for the Irish today. Notre Dame Head Coach Dennis Grace says his players are up to the challenge. 
"I'm convinced that this team has always risen to the occasion," Grace said Monday. "They've risen to the challenges and the obstacles in front ofthem before, and I'll be extremely disappointed if they don't do the same thing against Bowling Green. 
"The thing to do is not to dwell on the loss at this point." 
Grace was having trouble getting Sunday's loss out of his mind on Monday, though. 
The contest was played on what the Irish coach called "one of the worst fields I have seen in years." The playing surface was marred by rocks 'and clumps of dirt, and the field was particularly narrow. "The field was the great equalizer" that made the matchup between the Irish and the Wildcats close, Grace said. 
Not wishing to use the field as an excuse, however, Grace offered his team's overconfidence as a possible reason for the 1-0 loss. 
"At no time did we feel a sense of urgency," he said. "I really don't think those kids (the Irish) thought they could lose that game. We played hard and did what we could on a rotten field." 
The difference in the score came from Northwestern freshmanJimmy Muldoon, who scored with only two minutes remaining in the match. Muldoon was one ofthe high school seniors whom Grace recruited most heavily last year. 
His goal came on a breakaway which provided the Wildcats with one of their only scoring oppor­tunities in an Irish-dominated second half. Notre Dame had numerous chances at goalkeeper Bill Evans, but could not get the ball in the net. 
"It seems like every time we make a mistake, we pay big dividends, we pay a bigprice," Grace said, as he has many times this season. "But when the other teams make mistakes, we don't capitalize." 
The Irish were able to capitalize on their own good play Saturday, when they beat Wisconsin-Green Bay, 3-2, in overtime. 
Notre Dame got goals from Mar­vin Lett, Bill Gross and Martin Man­gialardi to notch the victory. Tom Gerlacher and Joe Sternberg con­tributed one assist each. 
Approximately 1500 spectators were inattendance at the homecom­ing game for the Phoenix. The Irish also were up against a referee whom Grace said was biased to the home team, and several Notre Dame players still were recovering from the flu which swept through the team last week. In short, the Irish faced "a tremendous battle," as the visiting coach called it. . 
Grace said the adverse conditions that the Irish had faced previously this season tuned them up for that battle, however. 
"We fought like heck. We did the things we had to do," he said. "We played a great second half, we really put it to them, and we beat a heck­uva team at their homecoming. Everything was in their favor. Everything was going their way, but we just beat them with a great ef­fort." 
Another great effort will be re­quired today against Bowling Green if the Irish hope to improve their record. 
AMERICAN
How you live CANCER may save your life. +I SOCIETY~ 
"Most walk-ons don't get the same work that the regulars get," he says. "When his opportunity came along, he made the most of it. He made himself into a good, sound football player." 
Monahan has carried the ball three times this season for a total of 11 yards. He's a quiet person, both on and off the field. When given the chance, he gets the job done. These qualities earned him the number­two fullback position, along with a scholarship last spring. 
"You have to like to hit," he says. "You have to abuse your body. Ifyou want to mal!:e it, you can't think about it. You just have to go out and do it. I don't have any special talents. I just go out there and do whatever I can." 
Irish fans can look forward to watching more hardnose football from Monahan for the remainder of this season, and probably in 1986 as well. He has one year of eligibility remaining, and plans to mal!:e the most ofit. 
"They've asked me to come back next year," he explains. "Right now, I plan to stay here as long as they want me." 
Moore realizes the value of Monahan perhaps better than anyone. 
"He's not gifted with natural ability," says the Irish coach, "but he's up there with the best of them in heart. You have to tip your hat to him." 
Consider it done.

Farley beats Lyons, Lewis; 
P.E. also remains unbeaten 
By KEVIN HERBERT 
Sports Writer 

The mighty Farley flag football team returned to its championship form last week by picking up two big wins while outscoring its opponents 42-0. 
At the midway point of this season, there are only two un­defeated teams remaining. One is the defending champ, Farley, and the other is last year's runner-up, Pasquerilla East. 
There were three games last Thursday. Farley, after a last second 14-12 win over Lyons, continued its winning ways by trouncing Lewis, 26-0. 
Pasquerilla East opened up a potent offense to defeat its counter­part, Paquerilla West, 31-13. 
In the other game Thursday, the dark horse of this year's flag football field, Lyons, downed the always gritty Breen-Phillips, 14-6. 
"Last season, we did not have a single senior so we did not lose anyone. We have a great freshman crop that adds talent to our team while allowing the entire squad to

below right. night to up its record to 2-1. Lyons' 
Mets tip Cardinals in 11 innings 
ST. LOUIS -Darryl Strawberry hit a two-out home run in the 11th inning and Ron Darling combined with Jesse Orosco on a four-hitter last night, keeping the New York Mets alive in the National League East with dramatic 1-0 triumph over the St. Louis Cardinals. 
Strawberry's 28th homer, which came after reliever Ken Dayley struck out the first two batters he faced, capped a game otherwise dominated by Darling and St. Louis starter John Tudor. Neither Darling nor Tudor, however, got a decision. 
The victory in the opener of the three-game series pulled the Mets within two games of first-place St. Louis and kept the Cardinals' magic number for clinching the division at four. 
Tudor, who leads the major leagues with 1 0 shutouts, blanked the Mets for 1 0 innings on six hits. Darling shut out New York on four hits for nine innings. 
Dayley, 4-4, replaced Tudor to start the 11th and struck out Keith Hernandez and Gary Carter. But Strawberry hit a 1-1 pitch into the right-field bleachers for the game's only run. 
Orosco, 8-6, pitched out of trouble in both the lOth and 11th in­nings. In the 1Oth, the Cardinals had runners on first and secondwith two outs before pinch-hitter Jack Clark flied out. 
In the 11th, center fielder Mookie Wilson dropped Tommy Herr's shal­low fly for a two-base error, and Herr took third on a groundout by pinch­hitter Brian Harper. Orosco ended the game by retiring pinch-hitter Ivan DeJesus on a fly ball to Wilson. 
A crowd of 46,026, the -largest at Busch Stadium since aJune 30 game against New York, watched the game on a brisk night. 
The Mets had mounted scoring threats in the seventh and again in the ninth, and both times Tudor was equal to the challenge. 
see BASEBALL, page 9 
only defeat occurred at the hands of Farley in a game that is still under protest. 
In Sunday's action, Pasquerilla West rebounded from its defeat to blank Walsh, 22-0. Meanwhile in a close affair, Pasquerilla East defeated the struggling Lewis Chickens 8-6. 
In the other game Sunday, Farley continued its lnterhall flag football dominance by defeating rival Breen Phillips, 16-0. 
"Their offensive pass attack was awesome. It broke our pass defense. We contained Farley's running game and option, but their passing was great," said BP coach Ann Schwartz. 
The victory leaves Farley at 3-0 while lowering BP's ledger to 1-2. Despite the slow start, Schwartz is still optimistic. · 
"We will bounce back and see them again in the playoffs." Pasquerilla East upped their season record to 4-0 last night by 
defeating Walsh, 14-0. Just how good PE is remains to be seen, but the light will begin to be shone Sun­day. Thus far, PE's defeated op­ponents combined record is 3-10. 
Sunday, however, PE will play the talented team from Lyons in a game which may prove to be a good in­dicator ofwho will challenge Farley for the title. 
Before Lyons plays PE, they will have to square off against PW in a 7 
p.m. start on Cartier field this evening. Following this contest, Far­ley will be pitted against hapless Badin (0-3). 
The final game tonight will com­mence at 9 p.m., featuring Lewis (0­
3) versus BP ( 1-2 ). 
Two other games, aside from PE vs. Lyons, will be played Sunday. At 8 
p.m. Badin and Lewis will tangle while at 9 p.m. PW and Farley will match up for battle. 

Belles beat Irish 
By ANDREA LaFRENIERE 
Sports Writer 

The Saint Mary's soccer team defeated the Notre Dame Women's Soccer Club yesterday afternoon at Stepan Field by a score of 2-0. The win was the first of the season for the Belles, whose record now stands at 1-6. 
With a minute left in the first half of the game, junior Mary Anne Perri scored the first goal for Saint Mary's off a throw in by sop­homore teammate Landry Clement. 
Senior Sue Schier! scored the second goal for the Belles three minutes into the second half. Schier! was assisted on the play by freshman Sarah Creech. 
Saint Mary's coach John Akers was quite pleased with the team's performance and noted that the Belles' defense particularly con­tributed to the win. 
"I really thought our defense came together today. We played with intensity for a full 90 minutes," he said. "I thought Gloria Eleuteri, Anne Pechous, Mary Beth Proost, Ann-Nora Ehret and Maureen Murphy all contributed to our strong defensive play. Our goalie, Patty Hatfield, did an excellent job also. 
"Sarah Creech started at midfield for the first time today, and she, too, played well." The Belles' next game is against Wheaton College Saturday at 1 
p.m. on Angela Field. 

"I'm hoping we can play with the same determined defense and keep working the ball at midfield," Akers said. 
Life is more than volleyball for Belles' Reidy 
Transferring from a state university of 33,000 students to a small women's college can be quite a culture shock as far as the people, the classes and the way of life are con­cerned. But Mary Reidy, a junior member of the Saint Mary's volleyball team, has made quite a habit of ex­periencing different ways of living. Not only did she make the big move from Bloomington, Ind., after her freshman year at Indiana, but she also has taken the Urban Plunge in the housing projects on Chicago's South Side, as well as spendingfour weeks as a camp counselor in upper Wiscon­sin's wilderness. 
An economics major who "never, never" wants to work in a bank like everyone else in her field, would someday like to help the type of people she visited in Chicago's projects. 
"I talked to people in the housing projects just to see what was happening in their lives. I talked about what the government was and wasn't doing. I also talked to high school kids about their expectations and aspirations. 
"There's so much that can be done ifsomeone is willing to organize it. I want to put my economics major toward developing areas ofthis kind." 
For Reidy, a native of Lake Bluff, Ill., one of Chicago's wealthier northern suburbs, the Urban Plunge experience last year really opened her eyes to the way people live right in her own hometown. 
Last summer proved to be another learning experience for the 20-year-old LeMans resident. Instead of heading to the big city, however, she went back to nature. 
After lifeguarding at a private dub for the first two months last summer, Reidy set out for Boulder Junction, Wis., for another eye-opening experience as a camp coun­selor for 13-year old girls in the middle ofthe wilderness. 
"I had nine girls in my cabin and I took half of them at a time on five-day canoe trips. It was a really good ex­perience and a definite challenge. It was also nice to just

everything. It was a big culture shock coming back to school and smelling ethanol when your're used to waking up to loons and bald eagles." 
On her second canoe trip, it rained the whole time, and in order to eat, they had to build a fire which consisted of burning birch bark under a tarp. According to Reidy, there were none ofthe modern conveniences ofhome available. 
"It shows you what's real in life. Going to these two schools, you sometimes forget about what really matters," she says. 
"The kids were really depending on you, not only to lead on the trips but they also asked your advice on everything." With only a map to guide her on the canoe trips, she 
admitted it was quite scary at times. "The big joke was 'Don't give Mary the map, or we'll get lost."' 
Although no official captain has been elected for the vol­leyball team this year, the Belles will be well guided by Reidy. 
Being the only upper classman on this year's nine­member team has put the 5-9 hitter in a position to take on some leadership responsibilities. 
"I'm very pleased with the leadership role she has just naturally taken over," says Head Coach MaryJo Lambert. 
"Last year I didn't voice my opinions. I didn't take a stand as a leader," says Reidy, the team's middle blocker and last season's most-improved-player award winner. 
"I have played just as long as the sophomores, but since I'm the oldest on the team I think more is expected ofme." 
Not only is three-fourths ofthis year's team composed of newcomers, but Reidy also had to adjust to the style of a new coach, an adjustment she gladly accepted. 
"MaryJo is a great coach. She gives her all and always has something positive to say. She's out to help everyone. She really cares about you as a person. And the morale of the team is much better this year," says Reidy. 
The decision to go to Saint Mary's was based on several factors, none ofwhich had to do with volleyball. 
"When I was a senior in high school, I vowed never to go to Saint Mary's or Notre Dame. I had tons of relatives who went to both schools, and I was just applying to a lot ofbig schools in the Midwest to play volleyball," says Reidy. "I was going to walk on at Iowa, but then I decided to go to (Indiana) and just play intramurals. I had put too much emphasis on volleyball my senior year." 
Reidy's athletic career at Lake Forest High School con­sisted of being a three-year letter winner on the school's volleyball team, receiving MVP honors her junior and senior years. She also ran varsity track all four years, qualifying for the state championships in the 800 medley relay. 
In February of her freshman year at I.U., Reidy enter­tained thoughts ofgoing to Saint Mary's, afterall. 
"It was a good decision. I liked I.U., but it was just too big and hard to make friends. You'd meet someone one semester then never see them again. I wanted to go to a place where you made good friends and kept them. I also didn't like the Greek system. Saint Mary's had a good atmo­sphere and good people," says Reidy, who was this year's transfer chairman on the orientation committee. 
With her family moving to San Diego soon, Reidy will experience yet another way oflife on the West Coast. And if past experiences are any indication, Mary Reidy will meet the challenge and make the most ofher situation.
