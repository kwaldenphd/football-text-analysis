New engineering building approved 
'Huge learning center,' Stinson-Remick Hall to be built on current University Club site 


By KATE ANTONACCI News Ediror 
Yet another part of the University's 10-year strategic plan will come to life in the next few years in the form of a new $69.4 million College of Engineering building, the University officially announced Tuesday. 
The Board of Trustees approved plans for the 142,000 square-foot construction on Notre Dame Avenue at its Feb. 2 meeting. 
The construction -which will sit between the McKenna Center for Continuing Education and the Hesburgh Center for International Studies -will replace the existing University Oub. 
The building project comes at a time of expansion for the engineer­ing department in terms of increasing numbers of students and faculty joining the College. 
"This wonderful new facility will address multiple needs in our College of Engineering -providing much needed space for our emerg­ing research in nano technology and energy, and enhancing the interdisciplinary experiences of our undergraduates," University President Father John Jenkins said in a press release. 
The building -to be named Stillson-Remick Hall-will boast an 11,800-square-foot seniicon­ductor processing and device fabri­cation clean room, a nano technol­ogy research center and an Energy Center, according to the release. 
The structure -whose exterior will stick to the "brick gothic" style seen on campus -will also fea­ture a "huge learning center" for undergraduate engineers, which Executive Vice President John Aflleck-Graves said the University desperately needs. ·

NO hosts eating disorder conference 
By AARON STEINER News Writer 
Eating disorders, disordered eating and body image issues are among some of the most pressing issues of our day, especially on college campuses, says Notre Dame graduate student Ali Wishon. This weekend Student Government leaders hope to address the problem with the inaugural Notre Dame Eating Disorders Conference. 
The conference -which runs Thursday through Saturday -is a joint effort of the Student Government, the Gender Issues Committee and other campus groups. 
Titled "Eating Disorders and the Campus Culture," the event will bring together experts in the field that will address a broad audience including students, fac­ulty, staff and administration from Notre Dame, as well as researchers, graduate students and representatives from treat­ment and counseling centers across the country -all with hopes of promoting awareness, research and further action. 
A first for Notre Dame, the nation 
The student-led and student­organized conference is one of the first of its kind in the nation, said event organizer and student body president Lizzi Shappell said. 
"Typically, these conferences are organized out of the University's counseling center, out of the biology, sociology or psychology department or organ­ized by other national organiza­tions," Shappell said. 
An event like this is "very novel throughout the country," she said. 
Wishon, who coordinated the event along with Senate Gender Issues Chair Ashley Weiss, said a conference like this -focused on the college environment as a fac­tor in eating disorders -isn't typical. 
"It's difficult, because there are only a handful of people who are studying eating disorders right

Kite given rights to develop 
Eddy construction to begin by end of 2007 
By KAITLYNN RIELY Associate News Ediror 
Plans for the development of Eddy Street Commons took a leap forward Tuesday when the University announced it had entered into an agreement with Kite Realty Group Trust to give the group exclusive rights to prepare and implement a design for a com­mercial district south of campus. 
Notre Dame Executive Vice President John Aflleck-Graves said the search for a contractor began almost two years ago. From the approximately 90 firms the University approached, Kite was selected for the task. 
"We decided that Kite was the most qualified," Affieck-Graves said. "It was a very, very careful process." 
The Indianapolis-based compa­ny has plans to build a mixed-use area near the intersection of Eddy Street and Angela Boulevard on approximately 30 acres of land currently owned by the University. The plan includes a retail center, a full-service hotel with business conference facilities, office space and condominiums, townhouses and apartments. The development is expected to take up more than 500,000 square feet south from Edison Road to Howard Street. 
In a press release from Notre Dame's Office of News and Information, Thomas K. McGowan, Kite's executive vice president and chief operation offi­cer, said the company was pleased to have been chosen as the devel­oper for the project.

Frigid air causes pipes to burst, flood Keough 
By KATE ANTONACCI 
News Ediror 
With South Bend temperatures dipping well below zero degrees this week, all it took was a slightly­cracked window or an ·unsecured door for heating pipes to burst twice in Keough Hall -once early Sunday morning and again Monday morning -causing serious flooding in the men's dormitory. 
"The freezing isn't the problem ­it's when it starts to melt that the water starts flowing," said Scott Kachmarik, associate director in the office of residence life and housing. 
The most serious flood involved a discharge of Keough's fire sprinkler system in the front entryway just after 7 a.m. on Monday, said rector Mark DeMott. 

Notre Dame Security/Police (NDSP) arrived quickly on the scene to help "keep damage to a mini­mum," DeMott said. 
Building Services in normally the first on scene to begin water clean up and to "assist in any further damage by moving items and belongings and working to contain the spread and flow of the water," Kachmarik said. 
"They also will immediately check the floors below and work to mini­mize the damage of water that might be running down the walls and through the ceiling," he said.

A matter of race 

Today is National Black HIV/AIDS Awareness Day. I imagine the emergent social problem ofAIDS in the African American community may lie far from the minds ofmost Notre Dame students, but it does not, on this day, lie far from mine. 
Steve Kerins 

I have lived in Wilmington, Delaware, since I News was 10 years old. Production Although Delaware 
Editor 

is bland in many ways, it has a partic­ularly long, regrettable history of poor race relations. Disparities in HIV rates are just the latest in a long line ofproblems to divide ethnic and racial enclaves in my city. 
More than 20 percent ofDelaware resi­dents categorized themselves as "black" in the last census. African American history runs richly through the state. Wilmington is home to the oldest black church in the country. As the East Coast's northernmost outpost of segregation, crossing Delaware's northern border marked a vast improve­ment in conditions for thousands of African Americans in the early 20th century. 
As in many states, race relations did not quickly improve following desegregation. Riots in Wilmington following the assassi­nation ofMartin Luther King, Jr., in 1968 prompted the governor to deploy the National Guard, which remained in place until the following year. 
Although public schools were eventually legally integrated, de facto segregation remains the norm throughout much ofthe state. 
In response to desegregation, many white families chose to withdraw their chil­dren from the public school system. In my county today, about a third ofschool-age kids are enrolled in private or parochial schools. Public education is grossly under­funded in Delaware compared with neigh­boring states. 
Race relations also remain exceptionally poor in Delaware. The Wilmington Police Department engages in 'Jump-outs," in which officers spring from unmarked vans and detain individuals loitering on the street. The detainees are then typically photographed, searched, and fingerprint­ed. The program has drawn heavy criti­cism for civil rights violations and possible racial profiling. 
Wilmington has one ofthe highest per capita HIV infection rates in the country, especially among African American men. Delaware was one of the last states to implement a needle exchange program for intravenous drug users, thanks to stalling on the part oflegislators from rural, largely white areas ofthe state. HIV infection, of course entirely preventable, may be reach­ing epidemic proportions just miles from my home. 
In my otherwise commendable (and almost entirely white) private high school, the effects ofracism were rarely discussed. This seemed unusual to me given that its leafy property sat mere blocks from some ofthe poorest black neighborhoods in the United States. I wondered whether we might have heard more about local social issues ifthe neighborhood residents had been white. 
At Notre Dame, another place where uncomfortable issues of race can some­times be pushed under the rug, I hope we can take a moment today to ask ourselves what we can do to combat this latest mani­festation ofracial antipathy. I don't have the answers, but maybe tOgether we can think ofsome.

Teen gets frostbite after run 
BUFFALO, Minn. -A teenager who wanted to con­tinue the family tradition of running around the garden barefoot during halftime of the Super Bowl game has learned a painful lesson. 
It was 17 below zero at halftime Sunday in this city about 30 miles northwest of Minneapolis, and D.J. Brown's dad said it was too cold to continue the tradi­tion. But the 18-year-old sen­ior at Buffalo High School ran outside in his T-shirt and jeans, threw off his socks and shoes, and ran around the block. 
"I consider myself having a high pain threshold, and this was just so 10 out of 10," he said. "I was, like, chewing on a towel." 
He was treated for second­degree frostbite on both feet at the burn center at Hennepin County Medical Center in Minneapolis and was on crutches and pain medication Monday.

A total of 290 runners from around the world, ranging in age from 18 to 77, competed in the 30th annual race up the famed sky­scraper. 
Dold's winning time of 10 minutes, 25 seconds was just over his 2006 time of 10 minutes, 19 seconds. 
Another German, 23-year­old Jahn Mattias, came in second with a time of 10 minutes, 56 seconds. 
The runners raced up 86 floors, or 1,576 steps, from the building's Art Deco lobby.

COUNCIL OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Men1bers discuss use of SUB funds 
BySONIARAO 
News Writer 
Members discussed redefining the purpose of the Student Union Board's "carry forward" fund dur­ing the Council of Representatives (COR) meeting in Lafortune Tuesday evening. 
The lund, which has served as a reservoir for all unused funding from Student Government, Judicial Council, Hall President's Council and Student Union Board (SUB), has accumulated well over $100,000. 
SUB manager Patrick Vassel said it's "a large amount of money that seems that it's not being put to the best use." 
Money from the fund l!as not been drawn from any student organizations, student body presi­dent Lizzi Shappell said. 
"I can't recall anyone ever asking for money out of [the carry forward fundi," Shappell said. 
There was a general consensus in putting the money in the carry forward fund toward an endow­ment, using the interest from it each year toward SUB functions. According to a sununary of Student Union Programming distributed before the meeting, "Major speak­ers, national and international leaders, personalities, and the types of speakers that Notre Dame should attract to campus are nor­mally above the total allocation for all speakers. Likewise, major per­formers cost at least $100,000 for talent alone. Obviously, this is an area of student life that is under­funded." 
Breen-Phillips senator Maris Braun noted that SUB could invite bigger bands to concerts and improve overall student life at Notre Dame ifit had the money. 
"I don't think it comes down to the fact that SUB can't do it," Braun said. "I think it's just that we don't have the money." 
Vassel said the speaker series and concert series that exist at other universities would be a great asset to Notre Dame, but "dollar signs were just flying through my head as I was sitting in the Joyce Center because those things aren't cheap," he said. 
Discussion on endowment possi­bilities was tabled until more spe­cific information could be obtained about money in the fund. 
In other COR news: 
+ 
Vice president Bill Andrichik reported on the Student Senate opinion about the presidential divi­sion of SUB's budget discussed dur­ing last Tuesday's COR meeting. Senate members seemed to agree that the division should be put under student government rather than SUB, but wanted to "make sure that the money would still be available and that FMB would con­sider it a separate entity." As for moving SUB's oversight level from $5,000 to $10,000, Andrichik said members thought it "contentious."

Author, politician to inaugurate series 
By KATIE KOHLER Assistant News Editor 
The first annual Plamondon Endowed Lecture in Communications Studies at Saint Mary's begins today with nation­
ally accred­ited author and political campaign expert Dr. Kathleen H a l l Jamieson. 
The lec­


ture, enti-Jamieson t l e d "Deception in Politics," is 
free and open to the public. It will be held at 7:30 p.m. in the Little Theater in the Moreau Center for the Arts on Saint Mary's campus. 
The lecture will focus on the role of the media, namely television, in shaping elec­tions today and in the past. Jamieson will also heavily focus on the 2004 presiden­tial election. 
The series, named for Ann Plamondon, a professor in the Communications Department since 1981, was initiated by fellow communi­cations professor and department chair Dr. John Pauley. 
"Dr. Plamondon is a long­standing member of our department. In honor of her retirement at the end of this academic year, we wanted to give ongoing tribute to her by establishing this series," Pauley said. 
Plamondon's influence on her students prompted the creation of the event, as for­mer students provided the funding to endow the series. 
"I think it's wonderful that we have the chance to do this," Plamondon said. "We didn't have any real ways to bring in a fascinating expert in communications and now we can. I just think it's great." 
Jamieson is the first speak­er in this annual series and was chosen for her extensive work with elections, cam­paign ads and her role as a political critic in several important elections. 
Jamieson is the Director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center and a professor of communications at the Annenberg School of Communication at the University of Pennsylvania. She has written several books on the topic of cam­paign deception and their influence on election results. 
In addition to her role at UPENN, Jamieson serves as a political contributor to CBS News. During the 1996 pres­idential debates, she also appeared on "The News Hour" with Jim Lehrer. For her work in the field, she has been labeled an expert in political communications. 
"She is in the top of her field and embodies what we, at Saint Mary's, stand for," Pauley said. "She is a great person to inaugurate the event." 
While Jamieson is a woman, the series will not be limited to female speakers. 
"Dr. Jamieson is just a great speaker and a strong figure in communications. In choosing the speaker next year, we will look for people with similar qualifications, regardless of gender," Pauley said. 
Pauley and other members of the communications department are hoping for a considerable turnout at the event. 
"We have contacted faculty of American studies and political science students over at Notre Dame as well as local schools such as IUSB," Pauley said. 
Plamondon, who also resides in New York, hopes for the continued success of the program. 
"In the future, I would love to come back each year. It all depends on where I am," she said. 
This is not Jamieson's first visit to the College. She was also present at the sesqui­centennial in 1994.

"This is a wonderful opportu­nity for us to develop a project of this magnitude that will simulta­neously serve as an extension of the University and an addition to the community," he said. 
Kite was announced as the preferred developer in August and the last few months have consisted of negotiations about how Kite would use the land and how it would divide the amount of retail area versus residential area, in addition to other con­cerns the University posed. 
"We just weren't going to give it to them and let them do what­ever they wanted to do," Aflleck­Graves said.

experts. 
Both keynote speakers are "huge" for the conference's inaugural year, Shappell said. 
"Dr. Olivardia is one of the top researchers in the field, espe­cially in male eating disorders," Shappell said. Olivardia studies body image issues in men and is co-author of the book "The Adonis Complex." 
Greenfield has won HBO awards and gained national recognition for her documen­tary film "THIN". The film screening and discussion with Greenfield will help to balance Olivardia's presentation, Shappell said. 
"It's great we have the pop culture element in Lauren Greenfield. but also the more academic element in Dr. Olivardia," she said. 
"We've really tried to identify the key players in the field," Wishon said. "We tried to bring together a group of people who are covering all aspects of eat­ing disorders, since they are so complex." 
In addition to presenters and campus resources, the University Counseling Center, the University Health Center and Campus Ministry will be featured in a Notre Dame panel discussion on Friday, Weiss said. 
"We have the unique opportu­nity to talk about what our resources are and what our resources could be, [becoming] a leader in how eating disorders are addressed on campuses," Shappell said. 
Number one focus: students 
"We're doing this for the stu­dents," said Wishon of the con­ference's overall purpose. "We want to get people talking and people to realize that this is a serious, life threatening issue on college campuses." 
Shappell agreed, saying that operation. 
"We decided that this would be something that our students would enjoy. We are the people who will push the project," Affleck-Graves said. "In that sense, we've done all the plan­ning up till now. But now it's time to hand the planning over to the developers and let them do it." 
The retail development and the construction of new apart­ments, condominiums and town houses on the corner of Eddy Street and Angela is the first phase of a five-part plan. 
The University has also dis­cussed plans with Kite to build a technology park, to extend Napoleon Street and construct residential housing along the extended area and to add addi­tional retail and services near the Five Points intersection. Parts of the project will proceed at a pace dependant on city approval. Kite has the responsi­bility to get all its plans through the city council, Aftleck-Graves said. 
He said does not know what 
this is a "unique opportunity to hear and even interact with some of the leaders in this fiflld." 
In addition to stimulating dis­cussion among students, organ­izers say that they hope the · event results in a greater emphasis on eating disorders across campus. 
"My greatest hope is that this starts research and discussion . . . as to how we address this issue, both academically and in campus life," Shappell said. 
Beyond Notre Dame, Wishon said she hopes the event will inspire all people attending to effect change. 
"We have brought together an exceptional group of researchers, and hope that everyone in attendance will walk away with a better under­standing of the complexity and urgency of the issue," Wishon said. 
A long time in the making 
Student Government initia­tives have addressed eating dis­orders issues in the past, but student government leaders have been working on the idea of a broader event with a greater impact for years, according to Wishon. 
"After watching several friends struggle with eating dis­orders, [former student body president] Adam Istvan decided that the Gender Issues Committee needed to take a closer look at the issue," Wishon said. 
Since then, Wishon and Shappell have coordinated Eating Disorder Awareness Weeks for the past two years. 
The pair had "talked for a long time ... about how we wanted to take it to the next level," Shappell said. 
When Shappell was elected president in 2006, Wishon said they were ready to pursue organizing a large-scale confer­ence. 
"When I was elected presi­dent, it was something that I was very passionate about, so we decided to [start] the very

the cost of tho project will be, since Kite has not disclosed il<i budget to thn University. 
Aftleck-Graves said he hoped Kite would break ground on tho project by the end of 2007. 
"Hopefully the whole project will be done in four or five years." 
The construction work should not impact Notre Dame's cam­pus, he said. 
"We are hoping it's going to be very attractive to the students," Affleck-Graves said. "It will be a place where they can go and do some shopping, they can do relaxing ... but I don't think con­struction will afl"ect campus at all."

The ideal start date lor construc­tion would be late November, Aflleck-Graves said, though work may be delayed until early 2008 if all of the planning is not complete by the fall. Construction is expected to be compleied in late 2009 or early 2010. 
The construction timeline was moved up because funds were col­lected earlier than expected. 
The University began to raise money lilT the new building in early 2000-2001, Aflleck-Graves said, and it took five years to close the project.

The construction firm will work with the architect in final­izing the architectural design and doing the design drawing." 
Gradually, the University will "move to place where we say, this is what we need, this is the funding that we have, this is what we can do," Aflleck-Graves said. 
In order for construction to begin, the University Club -a private not­for-profit organization founded in 1958-will be demolished. 
"!The University Club is] an inde­pnndent organization, with an inde­pendent board of directors," Affleck­Graves said. "We don't have much control of the University Oub." 
The lJniversity Club was first warned about the possibility of being demolished in 2002, Aflleck-Graves said. A few years later, Affleck­Graves "gave them notice they would have to be out sometime after December 2005." 
One alternative is to move the club to what currently is Greenfield's International Cafe in the Hesburgh Center. But Aflleck-Graves said that it is "really their decision" as the University has no control over the club. 
The building gains its name from the principal benefactors.-Kenneth and Ann Stinson and Jack and Mary Ann Remick. Kenneth Stinson grad­uated from the University in 1964 and currently sits on the Board of Trustees. Jack Remiek graduated in 1959 and sits on the University's advisory council for the College of Engineering.  
The learning center will be named after benefactors Ted and Tracy McCourtney.

Cockpit video documents death 
LONDON -A leaked cockpit video pub­lished Tuesday captures a dramatic exchange between two American pilots whose voices choke up when they learn they have killed a British soldier in a 2003 friendly fire incident in Iraq. 'Tm going to be sick," one pilot says, later adding "we're in jail, dude." 
Despite British requests, the Pentagon had refused to release the video to the family of Lance Cpl. Matty Hull, who died when at least one U.S. jet flred on his convoy in the south­ern city of Basra. But after excerpts of the video were published in The Sun newspaper, and the footage was widely broadcast, U.S. authorities agreed to release it for the British inquest. 
Neither pilot from the Boise, Idaho-based 190th Fighter Squadron was disciplined in the U.S. military's own investigation, which concluded the pilots "followed the procedures and processes for engaging targets," Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman said Tuesday. 
Palestine tries to negotiate truce 
RIYADH -Palestinian factions on the brink of civil war gathered Tuesday in Mecca, Islam's holiest city, in a last-ditch effort to end their bloody conflict. The Saudi-led push is key to any future peace talks with Israel-and to Arab efforts to blunt Iran's growing power. 
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas of Fatah and Khaied Mashaal, leader of the militant l-lamas movement, flew to the Saudi city of Jiddah before heading to Mecca to meet their host, King Abdullah, ahead of the start of talks Wednesday. 
The talks are open-ended, a reflection of Saudi Arabia's determination to keep them going until the Palestinians reach a deal for power-sharing in a new coalition government.

Court hears libby grand jury tapes 
WASHINGTON -On grand jury audiotapes played at his trial on Tuesday, former White House aide I. Lewis Libby said he learned about a CIA officer from Vice President Dick Cheney, forgot it, then learned it again from NBC News reporter Tim Russert a month later. 
The complicated history of Libby's recollections is at the heart of his perjury and obstruction trial in exposing of the identity of Valerie Plame, a CIA employee. She is married to war critic and former Ambassador Joseph Wilson. 
Judge orders Church record release 
LOS ANGELES -A judge Tuesday ordered the Roman Catholic Church to release insurance records and confiden­tial files related to a priest who had been convicted of molestation before being transferred to California. 
Superior Court Judge Peter D. Lichtman ordered the Archdiocese of Milwaukee to make public 3,000 pages of insurance records and hundreds of pages from files on Siegfried Widera. 
Lichtman wrote that Widera's files prove that "priests with known sexual proclivi­ties have been handed off from location to another without regard to the potential harm to the children of the Church." Kathleen Hohl, a spokeswoman for the Archdiocese of Milwaukee, said it would abide by the ruling but declined further comment.

Scrap gathering proves dangerous 
SOUTH BEND -Dennis Mackey has col­lected scrap metal for money, and he knows that gathering it can be dangerous. 
"It depends on what kind of scrapping you do. You have to use common sense," he said Monday as he stood waiting for lunch at the Hope Hescue Mission just south of downtown. 
Scrapping has drawn attention in this northern Indiana city since the bodies of four homeless men known to be "scrappers" were found last month in manholes 75 yards apart. The men were killed when they were struck in the head with blunt instruments, police say.

Iran blames U.S. for kidnapping 
Diplomat's seizure may further inflame tensions between Washington, Tehran 
Associated Press 
BAGHDAD -Gunmen wearing Iraqi army uni­forms seized an Iranian diplomat as he drove through central Baghdad, officials said Tuesday. Iran said it held the United States responsible for the diplo­mat's "safety and life." 
One Iraqi government offi­cial said the Iranian diplo­mat was detained Sunday by an Iraqi army unit that reports directly to the U.S. military. A military spokesman denied any U.S. troops or Iraqis that report to them were involved. 
"We've checked with our units and it was not an MNF-1 (Multi-National Forces -Iraq) unit that participated in that event," said Lt. Col. Christopher Garver, a U.S. military spokesman. 
Iraqis also faced more vio­lence on Tuesday as U.S. and Iraqi forces set up more checkpoints in preparation for a security sweep in Baghdad amid complaints that the operation was mov­ing too slowly. 
Prime Minister Nouri al­Maliki acknowledged that preparations for the crack­down were off to a slow start.

Kachmarik's office has also heard of problems in "one other hall, which hasn't been con­firmed."

"Because of the extremely cold temperatures and wind chills, the Department of Facilities Operations has requested assis­tance to insure that residence hall windows are shut tightly and secured," the e-mail said.

Students unable to regulate the heat in their dorm rooms were encouraged in the e-mail to notifY a member of residence hall staff so "a work order can be submitted for diagnosis and repair."

IN BRIEF 
NBC Universal hires new CEO Zucker 
NEW YORK -How Jeff Zucker handled adversity as NBC plunged to fourth place in the prime-time ratings was one of the measur­ing sticks General Electric Co. chief Jeffrey Immelt used in choosing him to run NBC Universal. Immelt said Tuesday. 
Zucker's rise from directing Katie Couric in the morning to running a huge media con­glomerate was completed when corporate owner GE announced his appointment as president and CEO of NBC Universal. He replaces Bob Wright, who has run NBC for 21 years. 
Zucker, 41 and a two-time cancer survivor, has essentially been trying out for Wright's job over the past two years in running the compa­ny's television operations. 
"We like the way Jeff has handled tough times," said Jeffrey Immelt, chairman and CEO of GE. "He never got down and continued to drive the company in a positive way." 
In addition to directing NBC's attempts to revive its prime-time fortunes, Zucker is in charge of a stable of networks including USA, CNBC, MSNBC, Bravo, Sci Fi and Telemundo. The company also owns the Universal movie studio and theme parks in Florida and California. 
Coca-Cola secretary faces jail time 
ATLANTA -The government said in court papers Tuesday it believes a former Coca-Cola secretary convicted of conspiring to steal trade secrets from the beverage giant should be jailed immediately because she poses a flight risk. 
In a motion filed in U.S. District Court in Atlanta, Assistant U.S. Attorney Byung J. Pak said clothing, prescription medication, papers and other personal items were found in Joya Williams' Mustang during a search after a fire destroyed her apartment Friday. 
The fire, which has been ruled accidental by local officials in Norcross, occurred nearly 90 minutes after the guilty verdict was reached in federal court in Atlanta. 
Wal-Mart faces class-action suit 
1.5 million female employees allege retailer discriminated in pay, promotion 
Associated Press  
SAN FRANCISCO ­A fed­ 
eral appeals court ruled  
Tuesday that Wal-Mart  
Stores Inc., the world's  
largest private employer,  
must face a class-action law­ 
suit alleging as many as 1.5  
million former and current  
female employees were dis­ 
criminated against in pay  
and promotions.  
The ruling by the 9th U.S.  
Circuit Court of Appeals  
upholds a 2004 federal  
judge's decision to let the  
nation's largest class-action  
employment discrimination  
lawsuit go to trial, possibly  
exposing the Bentonville,  
Ark.-based retailing power­ 
house to billions of dollars in  
damages.  
"Plaintiff's expert opinions,

plaintiff's contention that

court wrote in a 2-1 deci­

Face book, Comcast ally to air series 
Associated Press 
PHILADELPHIA -Comcast Corp. and Facebook.com are joining forces to create a television series from user-generated videos that will appear online and through video on demand. 
Called "Facebook Diaries," the series will consist of 10 half-hour episodes produced by R.J. Cutler, known for his edgy work gathering stories from regular folks in shows such as "American High," a non­fiction TV series chronicling the lives of suburban teens at an Illinois high school. 
The shows, which will start air­ing later this year, will be seen simultaneously on Facebook and Comcast's Ziddio.com, a video uploading Web site similar to YouTube that was launched late 
last year. The videos also will be carried on Comcast's video on demand service, which stores shows on its cable TV system for viewers to watchwhenever they want. 
"We've been having some dia­logue with Comcast for a couple of months just on and off, just as they were putting their video plans together," Owen Van Natta, chief operating officer of based Facebook, said Tuesday. "Then we engaged R.J. Cutler and we came up with this idea." 
He said the ability to get users' videos on cable TV as well as online appealed to the company. The social networking Web site doesn't have a video uploading feature; users share links to their favorite videos. The deal with Philadelphia-based Comcast, the 

nation's largest cable TV operator, will expand Facebook's video shar­ing capability. 
The deal also is expected to drive more Web traffic to Ziddio from Facebook's more than 16 mil­lion users. Facebook, based in Palo Alto, Calif., is the second biggest social networking site behind News Corp.'s MySpace.com and the seventh most trafficked site in the country. 
"We're tapping into Facebook's very large and very young demo­graphic," said Elizabeth Schimel, senior vice president of entertain­ment for Comcast Interactive Media. 
Comcast and Facebook wouldn't comment on the deal's details, but Van Natta did say there will be "sponsorship and advertising opportunities."

bad laws and make poor decisions on a daily basis, it is still disgusting, but it happens so frequently nowadays that I'm never surprised. However, there are a number of reasons why the dorm drunk is preferable to the United States government. 
Firstly, the "legislation" emanating from the dorm drunk rarely impacts me, despite the fact that I live in Fisher Hall as well. Sure, l might catch an occasional whiff of upchucked Blazing Sea Nuggets (rightfully so). I might have to side-step them on the second floor stairwell on the way to lunch on Tuesday afternoon. I might even have to help the dorm drunk stumble into his loft and turn him on his side so he can pass out. But the dorm drunk's actions rarely have a lasting impact on me; they are fleeting college experiences that I will one day look back on and laugh about. I'm never worried that the dorm drunk is going to install surveil­lance cameras in my room or steal my money and call it the income tax. The dorm drunk will never ban drinking or gambling and tell me it is for my own good. The government, on the other hand, does all these things with impuni­ty. 
Secondly, the dorm drunk doesn't even attempt to rationalize his actions. He knows his actions are corrupt and doesn't make vagup, references to inco-

He doesn't start wars and then pretend the purpose was to spread "democracy" or "freedom." He doesn't pretend that his actions are anything other than what they are-he engages in no dou­ble-speak. The US government and its politicians, on the other hand, do all theso things. 
Thirdly, the dorm drunk usually limits his partying to the area directly around the dorm. lle is seen as a good-natured fellow (albeit a drunk one) by the rest ol' the Notre Dame community who rarely does them wrong. Yes, he might occasionally wander in a drunken haze all over campus and pee on the side of another dorm, but he parties almost exdusively in Fishor Hall. Unless one of the other dorms hurts his person or steals his booze, ho has no motivation to venture outside the walls of Fisher. His actions are confined to his home. He exists pnaeefully alongside everyone elsn. The dorm drunk does not go bray­ing into battle likn a learning-disabled jackass against another dorm that did him little or no wrong. The dorm drunk isn't foolish enough to give those who already don't like his partying ways another excuse to hate him. He does not warmonger. The US government, on the other hand, does all of these things. 

Finally, the dorm drunk isn't too much of a burden on society. Yes, per­haps he will mistake a fellow Fisherman's laptop for a urinal in the wee hours or the morning or pass out naked in Ellie's bed (our rector's dog) in the middle of the first floor entrance way, but at least his shenanigans pro­vide much needed college stories to a college that is relatively tame compared to other schools. Although it is true that he wreaks havoc on other people's belongings, he is still personally fiscally responsible for whatever damage he causes. He cannot legally take 39 per­cent of my earnings without repercus­sion. He is not endowed with the power to take half of the belongings of my dead relative without suffering the con­sequences of doing so. lie can't institute pri1grams to punish the productive for being successful. The US government, on the other hand, does all of these things. 
While there is certainly a resem­blance between the US government and our dorm drunk, the dorm drunk is obviously preferable to the US govern­ment. Let's replace our representatives with dorm drunks. It can't get any worse.

Human rights violations often ignored 
According to a recent BBC undercover investigation, Oct. 1 has many interesting meanings in the People's Republic of China. It is, of course, the country's National Day. It is also, the BBC reports, the peak of organ sea­

ed by many a rich Westerner in need of a liver or two). The reason for this October surge in organ supply is simple, the BBC reports: Prisoner executions in China always go up before the national holiday. 
The BBC learned of this fall prisoner organ harvest through hidden camera footage taken by BBC correspondent Rupert Wingfield Hayes. In the video, Hayes strolls into one of the largest organ transplant centers in Northern China in order to procure a liver for his "ailing father." Not particularly in the mood for subterfuge, Hayes asks the doctors ifthey . received the organs from executed prison­ers. The hospital officials cheerfully pro­claim, 'The prisoners on death row have done many bad things. Before they die they give their organs as a present to soci­ety." 
However, Hayes notes that the idea that Chinese prisoners are willfully donating their organs to "society" (i.e. to rich Westerners) is tenuous at best. In a coun­try where convicts are often taken directly from the courtroom to the execution ground and due process is a figment of the imagination, ethical considerations about prisoners' rights seem a bit out of place. Indeed, Hayes' conversation with the father of an executed prisoner highlights this reality. When asked whether his son ever consulted with him about donating his organs after his execution, the father replies, "I didn't even get to see my son after he was arrested...The day he was shot they called me and said I could come and pick up his ashes." 
This practice should be disturbing to Westerners for a few reasons. Most obvi­ously, the Chinese government's decision to profit off the remains of executed prison­ers is one more nail in the coffm of civil lib­erties in the country. Even more impor­tantly, unrestricted organ harvesting cre­ates a juicy financial incentive to maximize the number of executions in China, which already happens to execute more people than the rest of the world combined. Yet perhaps the most frightening part about China's crimes against its citizens is that, for the most part, we don't care about them. 
Specifically, the West seems to be suffer­ing from a bad case of myopia. A 2005 Pew Research Center Global Attitudes Poll found that, in countries such as Britain, Germany, Spain, France and Russia, China is viewed far more favorably than the, United States. One can only conclude that a giant fourth of July organ harvest might do the trick in winning these nations' approval. 
Another revealing instance of Western apathy toward non-Western abuses is the ongoing U.S. military prison abuse scan,­dal. If foreign prisoners are mistreated by Americans, activists immediately spark a worldwide, front-page furor-and right­fully so. But when it comes to the far more routine, and more sinister, abuse of prison­ers' rights in China, we are deaf and dumb. Since it is not the U.S. committing the acts, Americans feel no guilt, Europeans feel no vindictiveness, and therefore no one has any notable reason to object. 
Nor is China the only country that stands to gain from this selective moral blindness. Africa is another success story, where for years massive human rights abuses went effectively unchallenged while the world arbitrarily decided to monitor other issues, such as the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, with eagle eyes. A bit of data from the Center for Public Affairs in Jerusalem: Between the years 2000 to 2003, Amnesty International released 52 reports on Sudan, where, even before Darfur, a heavi­ly civilian-targeting civil war was killing hundreds of thousands. In the same inter­val, 190 were released about Israel. 

In any objective valuation, these num­bers would make no sense. But who ever said objectivity mattered? Indeed, when the United States and Israel are viewed by many as the greatest human rights viola­tors in the world, while a country like Sudan has as recently as 2005 served on the U.N. Commission for Human Rights, it quickly becomes clear that Lady Logic has run away from us. Similarly, while China conducts executions en masse and then makes a profit off the bodies of the deceased, and the world claps its hands in approval, we can rest assured that objec­tivity lies safely in its grave. Such selective morality, which lacks any and all perspec­tive on who the true enemies of human rights in our world are, is a farce at best, and a crime against humanity at worst.

Do you know what some people in Indonesia were doing last night? One hundred thousand people in the capital

city of Jakarta were sleeping in mosques, hotels, government buildings or wherever else they could find because their homes were wiped out in massive floods this past Friday. 
Now don't get me wrong. I'm not say­ing everyone who watched the Super Bowl or bought Super Bowl merchan­dise should feel guilty about doing so. I watch it every year and always enjoy it. But even as we enjoy the luxuries we're fortunate enough to have, we need to think responsibly about what we do with the country's many resources. 
In the United States, we can have pretty much whatever we want. And even if you're one of the poorer people in the United States, you're still much better off than many in Africa and Southeast Asia. And we think that's how it's supposed to be. I'm afraid former President George H.W. Bush spoke for many when he once said, "The American lifestyle is not up for negotia­tion." But where does our lifestyle leave the rest of the world? 
Perhaps the simplest way to illustrate this comes from The Miniature Earth project. They've produced a video that can be seen at http:/1216.70.117.172/me_english-.htm. According to the film, if you keep your clothes in a closet, your food in a refrig­erator, you sleep in a bed and you have a roof over your head, then you are wealthier than 7 5 percent of the world's population. 
So what does all this tell us? First, I hope none of us take for granted how truly blessed we are. Stop complaining about your professor, your classes, your roommate, your living situation or how "poor" you are. You're one of the one percent of people worldwide who is able to go to college. If anything should char­acterize the citizens of the United States, it should be a profound sense of gratitude and humility because, for whatever reason, God has blessed us with some amazing resources few oth­ers have. 

The hard fact is that if we really want­ed, we could end poverty. The only thing stopping us is our excessively affluent lifestyle, but we have to decide, are they up for negotiation ... or not?

Inside the Worl 
The Future of lnteracti 
Wll WOULD LIKE TO PLAY 
By MICHELLE FORDICE Scene Writer 
Nintendo took a chance with the release of the Wii. It would not compete with the latest Microsoft and Sony releases by traditional meas­ures-such as enhanced, high-definition graph­ics -but Nintendo's innovation made the Wii a highly interactive console that appeals to both hardcore and casual garners. 
Nintendo's new system packs power, cus­tomization and high levels of interactivity into its hardware for the intense garners while adopting a sleek, white look similar to the iPod in order to attract a more general audience. 
The Wii comes with an LED equipped sensor bar (centered above or below any television screen) that in conjunction with the remote picks up the player's movements. The console is the smallest of all Nintendo units, only about the size of three DVD cases, and can be oriented horizontally or vertically. The front of the con­sole accepts Wii optical disks and Nintendo GameCube discs (though not standard DVDs and COs). The console also has two USB ports and one SD card slot. The remotes run on AA batter­ies. 
The remotes (or Wiimotes) are surprisingly sensitive. While there are limitations as to how far and from what angle a player can approach the sensor, the remotes can distinguish a multi­tude of different motions and provide six degrees of movement. Most of the time, the required motions are intuitive. The remote takes some time to get used to for more complex games, but the basic games, like those offered in "WiiSports," can be picked up in a couple of plays. 
Often, for those more complex games the remote is paired with the included nunchuck, which adds on an analog stick and two addition­al buttons. The remote has a speaker on it, allowing the user to hear the sounds of their movements, such as the clash of a sword. Nintendo also included a vibrating feature on the remote, which is often used to remind the player to make a menu choice. An additional controller can be purchased that allows users to play clas­sic Nintendo games they have downloaded to their Wii. 
"WiiSports" -a game which comes bundled with the console -allows users to play bared­down versions of games including tennis, golf, bowling, boxing and baseball. Tennis and boxing stand out as the more fun of the five, but all the WiiSports games are entertaining as players physically roll their bowling ball down the alley and swing their tennis racquet. 
Other games specifically designed to be played on the Wii showcase the range of its ability. "WarioWare: Smooth Moves" requires the user (like in past editions of the game) to play a series of short, random games in which they must fig­ure out what to do on their own. There are no more button combinations; the player has to move the remote in many different ways, all of which the system can differentiate, from letting it drop in free fall, hitting it between two hands or using it like a pencil. "Super Monkey Ball: Banana Blitz," which similarly cashes in on the motion capability of the remote, is a little more difficult to use as the motions are a little less intuitive, but can be just as fun. 
Wii also works well with more traditional games that have been updated to work with the Wii controllers, such as "The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess" and "Madden NFL 07." Players swing their sword and throw passes, making the games more immersive than their predecessors. The Wii console is also backwards compatible with all Nintendo GameCube soft­ware, though a GameCube controller is still nec­essary to enjoy these games. 
The interactivity of the Wii makes it most suit­able for multiplayer use. Unfortunately, most of the multiplayer games require the use of multi­ple remotes, which adds on hefty $60 fee for each new remote and nunchuk pair. 
Unlike other game consoles, the Wii is attempting to create a more versatile piece of equipment than just a pure video game system. Users can upload photos from their SD memory See Also cards and use the basic 
image editor to view and "Console evolution flirts change them (mostly in with virtual reality" fun, rather than serious ways). They can leave messages for other play­ers on the console and send messages over the internet and to cell phones. Also if they connect the Wii to the internet, users can check the weather, surf the internet, use the shopping channels and get news updates. After creating a Mii -a 3-D caricature of the user -players can store up to 10 on the remote and bring them to play on another Wii console. Eventually, Wii is supposed to have on-line game play where garners play as their Miis in multi­player online games, although this feature has not yet been perfected.This merger of gaming with online interactivity will bring a sense of community to video gaming that has never been accomplished before. One thing that needs to be improved on the Wii is the straps on the remote. Considering how much the remote swings around, Nintendo should have created a stronger way of keeping it attached to the user's wrist to prevent it from flying across the room. However, Nintendo is offering to replace the original straps with new ones made from a slightly thicker material. As video games like "Guitar Hero" and others become more and more immersive as gaming technology becomes more advanced, the versa­tility and interactivity of the Wii should serve it well.

2600 in 1977, which was capable of using game cartridges so multiple games could be purchased and played on the system. Although it took some time to be noticed, it became the best selling present dur­ing the Christmas season in 1979, selling over a million units. 
By 1982, the Atari was selling eight million units per year, making it the most successful game console of the late 1970s and early '80s, and familiarizing users with a diverse array of games including "Pac~ Man," "Space Invaders" and the first incarnation of "Donkey Kong." 
Following the success of the Atari 2600, it would be some years before something truly lasting would be released in the world of the home console market. The Commodore 64, released in 1982, had the most advanced graphics at the time but was a system that straddled the gap between home computer and home console. Quickly overtaken by other video game and home computer companies, it would last for a few years more but not as long as the now dominant market names. 
Mario takes control 
The next windfall for video gamers·camein 1985 in the form of the Nintendo Famicom, or Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) outside of Asia. Bundled with the now leg­endary "Super Mario Bros.," this console signaled the end of the 1983 crash and defined what is consid­ered a video game console today. Still revered by many as the symbol of their childhood, this system was a big success not only in Asia, but also North America, having sold over 60 million units since its launch. 
Nintendo was the first console maker to openly accept games from third-party developers. Capcom's "Mega-Man" franchise and Square Enix's (then Squaresoft) "Final Fantasy" series were games that have become the stuff of legend but were not developed in house by Nintendo. This is not to say Nintendo did not make games for its own sys­tem. The "Mario Bros.," "Zelda" and "Metroid" series were all created by Nintendo and are still being released today for newer systems. With games such as these, Nintendo showed not only technical advance­ment in its console hardware, but a creative capacity in game design that altered what people thought

were video games. 
All good things must come to an end and it was no different for Nintendo's near monopoly on the video game market. In 1989, the Japanese gaming company Sega released the Sega Genesis in America. This system was an improvement over the old NES due to the increase from an 8-bit to a 16­bit processor. 
Increased graphics capabilities were showcased in the now famous Sega franchise, "Sonic the Hedgehog." Another advancement on the part of Sega, which predicted the rise of the CD formatted game, came in the form of Sega CD. This could play music CDs and some games. As foresighted as this was, the CDs suffered from extended load times, which hampered the success of this console. 
Nintendo, seeing competition in the form of better graphics and game franchise creations from Sega, released the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES). Available in North America in 1991, this system sparked the biggest con­sole war in the history of video games between the Sega Genesis and the SNES. With games such as "The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past," Nintendo took back some of the market share it had lost to Sega. Other games such as "Super Mario Kart" helped the SNES become a home console staple. 
Games go 3-D 
The Nintendo 64, released in 1996, was a huge jump in graphics capabilities from the old 16-bit SNES. As the title of the console makes clear, this was a 64-bit sys­tem that had the first fully 3-D graphics showcased in games such as "Super Mario 64" and "The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time." Aside from these games. the first person shooter (FPS) based on the James Bond film "Goldeneye" paved the way for the explosion of first person shooters so popular today as shown in games like "Halo." 
Sony also jumped into the console market with its release of the PS1 in 1995. The biggest change in video games associated with the PS1 was the shift to games on CDs instead of cartridges. Also, separate, remov­able memory cards used to save games were introduced, allowing people to transport their memory

cards to play saved games instead of an entire system. Load times were somewhat of an issue -the main reason the Nintendo 64 opted for the cartridge format -however, the CD format offered third-party devel­opers more disc capacity and the ability to create epic RPGs such as the successful "Final Fantasy VII." 
After these, Sega had its last con­sole, the Dreamcast, which was one of the first consoles to be able to connect to the internet and allow game play over it. However, due to poor business decisions, Sega left the console industry and is now focused on being a third-party game developer. Nintendo released the Gamecube, which focused on fami­lies and social game play with games such as "Mario Party" and "Super Smash Brothers Melee," the sequel to the very popular "Super Smash Brothers" on the Nintendo 
64. Sony has had the most success so far with its Playstation 2. This system currently has the lion's share of the market even with Microsoft's introduction of its own Xbox. 
The situation today is one of held breath and anticipation. Nintendo has released its Wii, Microsoft has the Xbox 360 and Sony has the Playstation 3. No one system has emerged as the victor in this seventh generation of video game consoles. 
The high-definition DVD war is now in play as Sony is backing Blu­Ray and Microsoft backs HD-DVD. "Gears of War" for the Xbox 360 has set the tone for FPSs and Wri's revo­lutionary controller is the first major change in controller technology since the inception of the home con­sole. Sony has many loyal fans but the high price and current lack of games has left the Playstation 3 struggling. 
The history of the home console is one of creative genius and hard-line business. From humble beginnings with analog technology and no more graphic power than two bars hitting a circle across the screen, video games are a mainstay for everyone from children to business profes­sionals. As more and more people who grew up with video games enter their adulthood and have chil­dren of their own, the future is bright for this always innovative entertainment.

Figure skating earns silver medal in event 
Special to The Observer 
Notre Dame participated in the second annual West Coast Round Robin, hosted by Washington. The Irish dropped a pair of matches in opening play, but rebounded to win two matches to close out the weekend. 
Friday, the Irish fell to the host Huskies 6-3. James Zhang and Phil Moss posted straight game wins at No. 1 and No. 9, respec­tively, while Pedro Gochicoa came back to win a dose five game con­test at No. 6. Later on Friday, Notre Dame dropped its second match, 9-0, to No. 19 Stanford. 
Saturday saw fortune smile on the Irish as they opened with a 5­4 victory over USC. No. 2 Javier Palomo, No. 4 Mike McConnell, No. 5 Jose Palomo, No. 7 Leigh Chapman and No. 9 Julian Lagoy won for Notre Dame, while Zhang, Moss, Gochicoa and Thomas Lee also played hard in losing close matches. 
The Irish completed the tourna­ment on a high note, with a 6-3 win over Cal. Zhang, Javier Palomo and Moss won four game matches at the top three spots. Jose Palomo and Lee posted four game wins as well at Nos. 5 and 6, and Chapman came from 2-0 down to win a 3-2 contest at No. 7.

The Irish skated to music from "Phantom of the Opera", the Addams Family theme song and a musical score from "Edward Scissorhands" 
This season featured a pair of silver medalist finishes and a first place at the Dr. Porter competi­tion in December. The Irish will conclude their performances with a Feb. 25 exhibition, "Ice Ice Baby", at the Joyce Center. 
Women's Water Polo 
In their first game of the sea­son, the Irish gained a major vic­tory over the Michigan State Alumni team, which boasted six players from the 2006 National Championship team. With two scores by Bridget O'Neill, and one each from Cristina Romano, Kat Kennifer and MC Cimino, the Irish took a 5-4 lead late in the game before the Spartans scored a quick goal before time expired, forcing sudden death overtime. 

Bridget O'Neill scored the win­ning shot in the second period of OT on a pass from Kristin Schmitt. Freshman goalie Betsy O'Neill came up huge in the goal, recording 14 saves. 
The Irish next faced Wisconsin. En route to a 15-2 victory, every­one got good minutes for Notre Dame. Schmitt, who had five goals, led the Irish in scoring. Romano, who had four, and Kelly Horner, who had two, were also strong offensively for Notre Dame. Cimino. Katie Godfrey, Emily Harig, and Kristen Harchut all added to the tally, and goalie Maggie I Iyde came out with eight saves, including a blocked penalty shot to shut down the Badgers. 
Sunday morning pitted Notre Dame against the Toronto. The Canadians came out first, scoring three quick goals. The Irish answered with two scores by Horner and one by Romano to tie it up. 
Four unanswered Canadian goals were just enough to keep the Irish at bay. despite a quick hat trick by Bridget O'Neill in the fourth quarter, ending the game at a 7-6 loss. Betsy O'Neill had 15 saves in goal. 
Playing for third place in the tournament, the Irish met hosts Michigan State in a defensive struggle, with no score put on board until the end of the third quarter. With only one score by Romano, the Irish lost 2-1. Betsy O'Neill had eight saves in goal. 
Women's Ice Hockey 
Notre Dame traveled to Chicago to play three different squads. Friday night, it struggled the entire game against the'"Flash, yet prevailed 3-2. While the Flash scored first in the first period, Notre Dame senior Annie Tilton answered with a goal in the sec­ond period. 
In the third period the game picked up and the Irish scored twice more. First, freshmen Emily Chappell scored with an assist from sophomore Margaret Knoedler, and then Knoedler found the net, assisted by sopho­more Lauren Beuke. The Flash scored once more but the Irish held on for the victory. 
The Irish dominated Saturday's game against the Tigers. The Irish had four goals in the first period alone. Beuke scored first off of a pass from senior Jed goal in the second period. 
Senior goaltender Mindy Stack played a solid game as she backed up the Irish defensively. The Tigers broke their scoreless run with a goal within the last minute of playing time, but the Irish stayed on top to win 5-1. 
Sunday morning, Notre Dame faced off with the Penguins, its fmal opponent for the weekend. Chappell opened the first period with a goal off an assist by Knoedler and sophomore Amy Wilbelmy. 
Notre Dame eventually pulled out the 3-1 win. 
The team's success this week­end helped to boost its overall record to 14-5-1, which is impor­tant as its starts looking at the upcoming playoff games.

per game. 
"I think our post play overall has helped our recent success with the win streak," Henley said. 

Both Kammrath and Newsom feel that their indi­vidual contributions merely dovetail with the team's play as a whole. 
"Our team has shown that it is very balanced, and if one player can't get the job done, others have been able to have big nights," Kammrath said. "We have had quite a few games when more than two players have been in double figures. It's hard for other teams to handle a team like ours." 
Nevertheless, there is a strong association between the six games the Belles played ­five of which were victories between Jan. 13 and Jan. 31 -and the performance of Newsom and Kammrath. 
After the first six games of the season, Kammrath aver­aged 6.5 points and 5.5 rebounds in 24 minutes per game, while Newsom aver­aged 7.9 and 5.9 in 21.9 min­utes. 
During the recent six-game stretch, Kammrath averaged 
29.5 minutes per game, scored 
10.2 points and pulled down 
9.2 boards. 
Newsom averaged 30.5 min­utes, 15.8 points and 7.8 rebounds during the same period. 
It was in that span that each player brought their true potential into stark relief. 
On Jan. 20 against Adrian, Kammrath broke out for 25 points and 14 rebounds, shooting 10-of-14 from the field. 
"It was fun to play that game in particular because everyone did so great," Kammrath said. "I just found myself open on offense and was able to con­vert." 
Newsom displayed the same abilities on Jan. 27 against Tri-State, scoring 30 points and gral!lbing 11 rebounds while shooting 7-of-13. 
"We definitely had a height advantage which all of us post players made good use of," Newsom said. 
Henley also noted the size difference. 
"Our guards recognized this early and got Erin the ball," she said. 
As a result, Newsom was named the MIAA Player of the Week that week. 
Both players have taken the increased action in stride. 
"I don't care how many min­utes I play as long as we walk away with a win," Newsom said. 
Kammrath, in her first sea­son at the college level, had a tougher adjustment period, but started to feel comfortable around the fifth or sixth game of the season. 
"At the beginning, it was scary for me to be playing at a college level. I was nervous and didn't have much confi­dence in myself," she said. 
Kammrath and Newsom have a competitive but helpful relationship with each other, continuously trying to make the other better. 
"Anna [Kammrath] is great to play with," Newsom said. "She's a very supportive and unselfish teammate."

and added 12 rebounds against the Blue Demons. She leads the Cardinals with 21.7­points (49 percent from the field) and 11.5 rebounds per game. 
McCoughtry was also recent­ly named to the John R. Wooden Midseason All­American team, a prestigious group of 20 players who will compete for the Player of the Year award at the end of the season. 
But the recognized forward is only one reason why the Irish will have their hands full in the paint. 
Although Notre Dame out­rebounded West Virginia 46­to-23, it faces a Louisville team who averages 10 more rebounds per game than Notre Dame does -the Cardinals grab 47.8 boards per game compared to Notre Dame's 37.8. 
Aside from McCoughtry, cen­ter Jazz Covington (7.5 rebounds per game) will be another obstacle in the post. Louisville also holds a plus­
10.8 rebounds per game ratio over their opponents. 
But for all of Louisville's strengths in the post -they struggle from the perimeter. The Cardinals have shot only 29 percent from behind the arc and in their two losses com-bined sank only 20 percent of their three-point attempts. 


Both Louisville losses have come on the road -a 106-94 overtime loss at Providence Jan. 3 and a 74-58 lost to South Florida on Jan. 16. And McGraw understands the importance of capitalizing on the home-court advantage. 
"You have to take care of your home court," McGraw said. "Everyone in the league is struggling to win on the road. There's not been a decent road win until [Monday] night when Connecticut beat Marquette -that was I think the first one. I think we really have got to take care of our home court. And we have a lot of great opportunities coming up." 
Junior guard Charel Allen will lead the Irish offensively. Allen was named to the Big East Honor Roll for the third time last week, and she also has one Big East Player of the Week under her belt this sea­son. 
The most important factor, however, may still be the Joyce Center and the fans who were noticeably absent on Super Bowl Sunday. 
"We're hoping that the crowd comes back for [Wednesday's Gamel," McGraw said. "We're going to need all the help we can get."

ers will mark the second straight top-1 0 class accord­ing to Tom Lemming, the national recruiting analyst for CSTV. 
On one end is Armando Allen, a 5-foot-10 running back from a Miami suburb. On the other is Chris Little, a 6-foot-5, 340-pound tackle from Jeffersonville, Ga. 
In between are the coveted Clausen, an Italian kid named Ragone from Weis' old Jersey stomping grounds and a wide receiver from Tennessee with a name that destirwd him for Golden glory. 
The Irish are expected to land only two defensive line­men -end Kerry Neal and tackle Ian Williams -but will grab two running backs, two receivers and five offensive linemen. And the one quar­terback everyone wanted but only Weis got. 
It's the second straight year the Irish will bring in two top tailbacks, and this year's receivers compare favorably to last year's group. What's more, after receiving a bare cupboard on the offensive line, Weis restocked the shelves with six big men last year and this year's five. 

But the recruiting saga this year was more moving than most. Clausen's commitment helped the Irish reel in the top offensive recruits, Lemming said, but the Irish experienced frustration on the defensive side of the ball. 
Linebacker Chris Donald passed on the Irish and will stay in state to be a Volunteer. Lineman Will Blackwell of West Monroe, La., chose LSU after the Sugar Bowl. Lineman Martez Wilson of Chicago will sign with Ron Zook and Illinois, while Anaheim linebacker Chris Galippo will go to USC. 
The worst for Notre Dame, though, was losing defensive end Justin Trattou of Hamsey, 
N.J. Lemming doesn't have him rated in his top 100, but Scout.com ranks him as the fourth best defensive end prospect in the country. He committed to Notre Dame in June but visited Florida Jan. 19 and soon thereafter told Weis he'd be going to Florida

The Irish picked up two verbal commitments after Trattou's switch, but line­backer Brian Smith and kick­er Brandon Walker don't enter as difference makers the way Trattou could have. 
But starting today, Trattou and Donald, Blackwell and Wilson, Galippo and everyone else will mean nothing to Notre Dame unless they see the field against the Irish. Notre Dame will continue striding in the Red Queen race that is recruiting, forget­ting the past and looking at the future. 
The recruits who sign today will talk to media only once or twice between now and their sophomore seasons, and the continual rebuilding focus will shift to a new year of high school players. Analysts and coaches are already fol­lowing current juniors des­tined to make an impact in Division I. 
But today, the Irish can be happy with what they've got. The next national signing day is a long way away.

Newsom led the team with 10 rebounds. 
Harris led the Knights with 17 points on 6-of-9 shooting. Forward Lisa Winkle had 13 rebounds. 
The game marked the sec­ond-lowest point total for Saint Mary's on the season. The Belles scored 42 points in a loss to Hope on Nov. 28. 
The loss came after a two­day delay due to a blizzard in the Grand Rapids area. Henley hoped the delay had no effect on the game. 
"I talked to the kids about it. but at this point in the season, it's all mental," she said. "You have to be ready to go. I would hope something like a delay that's out of our control would­n't affect us." 
Despite the team's lackluster play, Henley credited Calvin's skill. 
"You have to give Calvin credit," she said. "They're ranked [high] in the country for a reason."

Notre Dame broke its three­game losing streak with a 77­67 win over West Virginia Sunday, but it will face anoth­er tough challenge in No. 17 Louisville tonight at 7 at the Joyce Center.
