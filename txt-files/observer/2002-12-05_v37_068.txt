Senate criticizes First Year of Studies 
By MEGHANNE DOWNES 
A.ssisrant New~ Editor 
The Student Senate unani­mously passed a resolt.1tion that urged lhc First Year of Studies lo review its evaluation pruct\Sses because it feels that student needs were not being addressed. 
Work began on this rcsolu lion last year after Jeremy Staley, senator from Sorin l!all, noted his disappointment with First Year of Studies. Staley said, "First Year of Studies is not really in touch with what the students need. There is a big discrepancy over what it claims to do and what it does." 
Members of the Academic Affairs Committee met with Eileen Kolman, dean of the First Year of Studies, and reported that the meeting was unproductive, said Staley. This led to the drafting of the reso-requirements and expressed of a survey that freshmen are Senate offered itself as a 1u tion and Staley said, "It's a uncertainty about the purpose asked to complete each spring, resource for First Year of recommendation and we want and quality of peer advising. said Staley.

Notre Dame No. l in students overseas 
Special lo The Observer 

Notre Dame has the highest percentage of students partici­pating in study abroad pro­grams among American research universities, according to a new report from the Institute of International Education (IIE). 
For 2000-01, the most recent academic year for which statis­tics are available, 39.2 percent of Notre Dame students had participated in study programs in other countries. Yeshiva University in New York City is second with 38.8 percent, fol­lowed by Cornell (28.2), Duke 
(26.5) and Georgetown (26.5) universities. 
With a total of 1,133 students who studied abroad, Notre Dame is among the 24 universi­ties with more than 1,000 stu­dents who studied in another country. Michigan State University ranks first for the actual number of students (1,835) studying abroad but is 19th on a percentage basis at 
19.2 percent. 

Turnitin.com detects student plagiarism 
By CAITLIN EARLY 
News Writer 
In a recent e-mail sent to the entire student body, the Honor Code Committee addressed sever­al points of concern surrounding the University's use of Turnitin.com, an online plagia­rbm-detection company. 
Turnitin.com enables professors ,m<l faculty members to submit a student's paper and to receive a set of "Originality Heports" within 24 hours. revealing if any Internet documents or resources are used in the student's work. 
The most contested aspect of Turnitin.com, however, is the direct submission of students' work without any prior indication of plagiarL'im. 
The Honor Code Committee's official response to the use of Turnitin.com recommends, "A student's work be submitted to Turnitin.com only if the instructor of the course believes there are reasonable grounds for suspecting academic dishonesty on the part of the student." 
As it currently stands, only about five professors are submit­ting all students' papers to Turnitin.com. 
"With regnrd to Turnitin.com. the I lonor Code Committee feels that automatic submission of papers without prior suspicion of plagiarism expre~r,s a degree of distrust that is at odds with the very spirit of the Honor Code," said Thomas Flint. faculty Honor Code officer. 
Students' reactions towards the use oITurnitin.com continue to be mixed. 
"We found that most students were initially weary when they were informed about Turnitin.com. Some students feel that the plagiarism service is ben­eficial because it ensures that their peers will be more honest. Others, however, are concerned that use of Turnitin.com under­mines the whole idea of honor," said Maura Kellv, a student mem­ber of the University Academic Honor Code Committee. 
The University decided to con­tract the services of Tumitin.com for this academic year in response to ihe ovenvhelming problem of computer-related cheating that continues to plague Notre Dame, as well as many other colleges throughout the country. 
"In the past few years, many professors have been looking for a tool, like Turnitin.com, to deal with the rising problem of online plagiarism. The University has a yearly contract with Turnitin.com and wn ¼'ill continue to re-evalu­ate the use of its services in ihe years to come," said Flint.

SMC sponsors religion forum 
By MEIANIE BECKER 
News Writer 
In order to increase reli­
gious awareness on campus 
during the holiday season, 
the Student Diversity Board 
(SDB) hosted a forum on 
major world religions in the 
Haggar College Center last 
night. 

"This was to provide .awareness of other religions, 
some knowledge and to erase

senta­Doherty, t i V e spoke of her Anita Anita Doherty experiences of Doherty SDB spirituality representative being brought 
said. 
A panel of students, faculty and staff represented six religions. 
Johnea Brooks De-Vitta, senior humanistic studies major spoke about Baha'i and its origins. Founded in Persia during the mid-19th century, followers of Baha'i believe that there is one God who created all messengers, or prophets to guide individ­ual search for faith during times of spiritual crisis. De-

Vitta explained there are several obligatory prayers but little ritual in Baha'i and that there are 19 days of fasting during sunlight hours in March. 
Cindy Mongrain, a member of Campus Ministry present­ed Roman Catholicism and described the ritual practices and sacraments of Catholics. Catholicism is a faith com­munity that believes the end of life to be the beginning of a new life, Mongrain said.

"A Jot of times Christians will move into different denomination !of Christianity] to find the prac­tice that fit their beliefs," Doherty explained. 
Junior Nila Ahmad, SDB vice-president, represented Islam and explained how it is practiced in daily life. 
The six core beliefs of Islam are that there is one God, belief in all prophets of all religions, belief in reli­gious books of all religions, belief in all angles and Mohammed as the messen­ger and the Day of Judgment. 
The five pillars, prayer five times a day (Salat), Charity (Zakat), a month of fasting (Ramadah). pilgrimage to Mecca (Hajj) and the belief in one God (Kalima) are the principles in which Muslims live their lives. 
"We fast so that we may empathize and know what it means to be poor," Ahmad said. 
Carla Johnson, professional writing specialist and English Department assistant of writing proficiency profes­sor, spoke on Judaism. Judaism was the first monotheistic religion and the root of Christianity and Islam.

Editor
many commit­ments are being made, and others broken. 

While home over the break my best friend from high school shocked me with her pronouncement that she was becoming a nun. 
Now I shouldn't say that it was a com­plete shock because it is something she has been considering for a couple of years no_w but I never actually thought she would do it. 
Now it's not like you can just wake up one day and say, "I think I'm going to be a nun," and you can just join a con­vent like that. It is a major commitment and it will take her several years to actually receive the title of Sister. 
Apparently there are three levels before you make final vows. First there is postulancy, when you live in the con­vent for one to two years, then there is novitiate, which is the beginning stage of religious life and is another two years, and then there is the junior pro­fessed stage, which is the first profes­sion of vows of chastity, poverty and obedience. It is only after five years of yearly renewing these vows that per­petual vows are taken and only then will my friend give herself forever to God. 
The time and contemplation that goes in to becoming a nun has made be aware of the commitments many seniors are making, especially when I consider the amount of seniors becom­ing engaged. Marriage is just as an important commitment as a vocation but it worries me when so many today seem to rush to get married. When you consider that the divorce rate in America hovers around 50 percent, maybe a longer period oftime between becoming engaged and married should be made. It's not that I don't believe young people are capable of making long term commitments; my parents were married at 18 and have been together for over 20 years but it seems like people just don't take marriage as seriously. 
Consider all the celebrities that seem to easily marry and divorce, over and over again. I'm not saying that celebri­ties are representative ofmost people but that there even is the attitude that marriages can so easily be absolved is demonstrative of the lack ofrespect for the institution ofmarriage. I mean look at J-Lo, that girl really needs to slow down before she turns into today's Elizabeth Taylor. 
For me having a friend that is going to be a nun, and knowing the great commitment she is making, has made me reevaluate the commitments in my own life and how I plan to fulfill them.

Outspoken priest breaks ranks in Boston diocese 
Associated Press 
BOSTON 
The Rev. John D'Arcy told his superiors just what he thought about a priest sus­pected of sex abuse. alco­holism and drug use so fre­quent he was known as a "pothead." 
"If a man like this does not seek help. he should not be given an assignment,· D'Arcy wrote in 1983 to Bishop Thomas Daily about the Rev. Richard Buntel. 
The letter was not unusual for D'Arcy -he sent notes seeking to intervene in at least three cases of troubled priests in the Boston Archdiocese, some of which were released Tuesday among a cache of documents related to the clergy sex abuse crisis. 
But D'Arcy's outspoken­ness was so rare among the Boston clergy, it highlights 
their errant colleagues range from a church culture keen on avoiding scandal to simple ignorance that crimes were being commit­ted. 
There's also little evidence speaking out had an effect. Bunte! was reassigne-d despite D'Arcy's warning that he was called a "pot­head" by members of a for­mer parish because of fre­quent drug use. 
Buntel was placed on administrative leave in March 1994. That year. an allegation from 1983 resur­faced that he had offered cocaine to a 15-year-old boy for sex. 
In most cases, however, priests had no direct knowl­edge of their colleagues' crimes and were reluctant to act on distant rumors of problems, said the Rev. Robert Bullock, head of the by priests might saved or

D'Arcy, who is now bishop of the Fort Wayne-South Bend diocese in [ndiana, was out of town and did not respond to calls for com­ment. He explained his rationale for coming for­ward in a letter about Bunte!, written while he was an auxiliary bishop in Boston.

In 1978, when Cardinal Humberto Medeiros led the archdiocese, D'Arcy wrote to church officials relaying complaints about the Rev. Thomas Forry's abrasive manner, according to the church files released Tuesday. A year later, after Forry was accused of beat­ing up a housekeeper, D'Arcy wrote again.

church leader released earlier, D'Arcy a l s o wrote to Cardinal Bernard Law. warning him about reassigning John Geoghan. who was ousted from the priesthood and has since been convicted of sexual abuse. rn the letter, D'Arcy cited Geoghan's history of sexually abusing young boys. A spokeswoman for the archdiocese did not immedi­ately return a telephone call seeking comment. Roderick MacLeish, an attorney for alleged abuse victims, said D'Arcy took a stand because he was one of few Catholic officials who truly cared about the vic­tims. But the Rev. Thomas Reese, a priest and editor of the Jesuit magazine America, said many clergy­men may have called church officials with concerns, but not wanted to go on record with a letter. Reese adde.i that priests are taught to be nonjudg­mental as part of their pro­fession, and that could lead them to give other clergy a pass when things seem awry. "It's the same kind of blindness people have when it happens in families," Reese said. 
He added that criminal priests are often expert deceivers, and can fool even the people they live and eat with daily. 
"These guy are incredibly manipulative and they lie," he said. "They could get Academy Awards." 
Dean Hoge, a Catholic University sociologist who has studied the priesthood, said while priests may not know intimate details about each other, the culture also reflexively protects itself, keeping scandal bottled inside. 
"It's a little like a club or military unit," he said. "In general, there's not much whistleblowing."

Bush: al-Qaida responsible for attacks on Kenya 
Associated Press 
WASIIINGTON 
In a grim update on terror­ism's global reach, President Bush said Wednesday he believes Osama bin Laden's network was involved in last week's Kenya attacks, and he complained that terrorists ha·ve been able to "stop the peace process" in the Middle East. 
Pledging anew to fight ter­rorism "wherever it exists," Bush sidestepped the question of whether bin Laden's al­Qaida organization has infil­trated the West Bank but said tMroristn in general has left its mark on the Israeli­Palestinian conl1ict. 
"I am conccrnocl that terror­ists have disrupted the ability for peace-loving people to move a procnss forward," the president told reporters in a brief exchange about Iraq and the war on terrorism. 
Bush said he understands both Israel's need to fight ter­rorism and the Palestinian people's desire to improve their living conditions. Ile pledged to continue working on both fronts. 
"But the net effect of terror­ism is to not only stop the peace process. but is to cause suffering amongst all the peo­ple of the region," Bush said. "i\nd that's why our war against terror must remain steadfast and strong wherever terror exists." 
Since the first days af'ter the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on Washington and New York, Bush has said tho war against terrorism is a global proposi tion. His remarks Wednesday indicated he believes the Middle East peace process will be in jeopardy until terrorism is cui:bed. 
The remarks were made in advance of a Dec. 20 confer­ence in Washington to plot peace moves in the Middle East. Even as they prepare for the summit of U.S., Hussian and European diplomats, administration officials con­cede there is little chance for headway in the talks amid vio­lence and terror attacks in the region. 
Bush was asked whether he is concerned that al-Qaida, feeding off the harsh plight of many Palestinians, may be gaining a foothold on the West Bank. 
"I am concerned about al­Qaida anywhere," the presi­dent replied. "I believe that al­Qaida was involved in the African bombings in Kenya. I believe al-Qaida hates free­dom." 
Evidence continues to mount that al-Qaida was behind the Kenya attacks -a bombing at a hotel frequented by Israelis and the firing of missiles at an Israeli charter flight.

Iraq protests -weapons inspections, calls experts spies 
Associated Press 
BAGHDAD Iraq protested sharply Wednesday over 
U.N. weapons inspectors' surprise intru­sion into one of Saddam Hussein's presi­dential palaces, accusing the arms experts of being spies and staging the palace search as a provocation that could lead to war. 
The harshest criticism came from Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan, who charged -in language reminiscent of clashes with inspectors in the 1990s ­that the new teams of U.N. monitors are gathering intelligence for Washington and Israel. 
"Their work is to spy to serve the CIA and Mossad," Israel's intelligence ser­vice, Ramadan claimed to a visiting dele­gation of Egyptian professionals. 
Ramadan, known for his fiery state­ments, claimed to his all-Arab audience that the inspectors went to the palace hoping to provoke the Iraqis into refus­ing them entrance -something he said would be interpreted as a "material breach" of the U.N. resolution that man­dated the inspections, and a cause for war. 
The resolution includes "several land mines," Ramadan said, "and the aim is that one of them will go off." 
Responding to Iraqi protests over Tuesday's palace visit, a U .N. official countered that the inspectors are taking the right approach -navigating between Iraqi complaints and U.S. pres­sure for more "severe" inspections. And, said inspections team leader Demetrius Perricos, "we are getting results." 
Among other things, Perricos reported that on a five-hour inspection of a desert installation his experts secured a dozen Iraqi artillery shells -previously known to be there -that were loaded with a powerful chemical weapon, the agent for mustard gas. It was the first report of such armaments traced and controlled in the week-old round of new inspections. 
The inspections resumed last week after a four-year suspension, under a new U.N. Security Council resolution requiring Iraq to surrender any remain­ing weapons of mass destruction and shut down any programs to make them. 
A critical deadline approaches this weekend for the Baghdad government. On Saturday, a day ahead of the dead­line, it is expected to submit a declara­tion to the United Nations on any Iraqi weapons of mass destruction, as well as on nuclear, chemical and biological pro­grams it says are peaceful.

Prime Minister Ariel Sharon said that as pllft of the U.S.-sponsored "road map" for Mideast peace, Palestinians could set up a temporary state in part of the West Bank and much of Gaza. But Foreign Minister Benjamin Nctanyahu said that even before peace talks, Palestinians would have to give up their demand to relocate millions of refugees in Israel. 
U.S. plans Turkish army bases upgrade: 
A top U.S. official said Wednesday that Iraq is "sur­rounded" and that Washington is looking to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to upgrade Turkish bases that could be used in a war against the coun­try.

Judge rules on "dirty" bomb suspect: 
Overriding government objections. a judge ruled Wednesday that a formtlr Chicago gang member accused of plotting with al-Qaida to detonate a radioactive "dirty" bomb can argue he was improperly detained as an enemy combatant. Although U.S. District Judge Michael Mukasey upheld President Bush's authority to detain enemy combatants. even if they are U.S. citizens. he also carved a role for the judiciary to make sure the executive branch was doing so properly. 
Perilous snow forces school closings: 
A vast storm spread freezing rain and up to a foot of snow from the Texas Panhandle to Virginia on Wednesday, shutting down hundreds of schools, making highways dangerously slick and knocking out power to nearly 100,000 people. "Everybody needs to stay home," Oklahoma Highway Patrol Lt. Jerry Treadwell said. 
Panel permits Law to file bankruptcy: 
A financial panel of the Boston Archdiocese gave Cardinal Bernard Law permission Wednesday to file for bankruptcy as the church tries to settle poten­tially crippling lawsuits in the priest sex abuse scan dal. Law would need approval frorn the Vatican before filing for bankruptcy. No Roman Catholic archdiocese in the United States has ever taken such a step, which would give a secular court con­trol over its finances and open it up to unprecedent­ed scrutiny. 
Clouds delay landing of space shuttle: 
Thick clouds moved in at the last minute and pre­vented space shuttle Endeavour from returning to Earth on Wednesday with the former residents of the international space station. The delay added a 183rd day in orbit for American astronaut Peggy Whitson and her two cosmonaut crewmates -and probably a 184th day. given Thursday's stormy forecast.

most basic and frequently used prayer. The Torah, which became the first five books of the Christian Bible, is used as the religious book of Judaism. 
"[Historically] The Sberna becomes the last rite of the Christian," Johnson said. 
Additional dietary and kosher restrictions exist in Judaism as a sign of the respect of all life forms, including animals. After death they believe there is no hell, but estrangement from God from those who have sinned and not done peni­tence. 
Within Judaism there are three branches of faith. Orthodox, the strictest sector, has dress regulations, preser vation of life by refraining from birth control and abor­tion, and sex segregation. The Conservative sector allows for men and women to worship together but does not allow for the prevention of birth. Reformed Jews have a differ­ent interpretation of Judaism and have female rabbis. 
"There are different views [between branches] of gender and how strictly laws should be enforced," Johnson said. 
Tanushree Bera, first-year biology and physics major, spoke about Hinduism. 
Known as the oldest reli­gion, Hinduism has three Gods, Brahma (the creator). Vishnu (the protector) and Shiva (the destroyer of evil). 
Hinduism was the root of what is known as the caste system. Brahmins (priests and teachers), Kstriya (Rulers and Warriors), Vaiysa (Tradesman and craftsman) and Sudra (the menial workers) make up Hindu society.

IN BRIEF 
Mechanists urge vote ratification 
United Airlines mechanic Ricky Taube drove 70 miles to his union hall last week to vote against wage cuts the carrier says are neces­sary to keep it out of bankruptcy. 
On Thursday, he planned to repeat that sce­nario in a second mechanics' vote that could unravel United's effort to avoid a Chapter 11 filing. 
But a government panel took the urgency out of the vote late Wednesday, rejecting the airline's request for a federal loan guarantee it needed to avoid defaulting on nearly $1 bil­lion in debt due next week. 
The Machinist's union had no immediate comment on the decision by the Air Transportation Stabilization Board, and cir­cumstances surrounding Thursday's vote were unclear. 
American to fire flight attendants 
American Airlines will trim 1,100 flight attendants in coming months as it prepares to operate fewer flights next spring. 
The company will offer voluntary options such as job sharing and leaves of absences to reduce the flight attendant numbers, American spokesman Todd Burke said Tuesday. 
fle said that the window for night atten­dants to take the options will begin Dec. 11 and close Jan. 7. After that, American will have a clearer idea of how many will be laid off. Any job cu ts would take place Feb. 1, Burke said. 
The Fort Worth, Texas-based company noti­fied the Association of Professional Flight t\ttendanls, the union representing American night attendants. on Monday. 
Union spokesman George Price said American's absence program will provide night attendants with all of their regular employee benefits, but no paycheck. 
t\merican has about 21,000 active atten­dants. Layoffs would begin with the newest employees. 
United loses loan guarantee 
. Company set­back after Feds reject plea 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON 
United Airlines lost its bid for $1.8 billion in federal loan guarantees Wednesday. a major set­back to the nation's sec­ond-largest air carrier in its efforts to avoid bankruptcy. 
The Air Transportation Stabilization Board said that despite efforts to pare costs, "the business plan submitted by the company is not financially sound." 
Chicago-based UAL Corp., United's parent com­pany, had asked that the government guarantee $1.8 billion of a $2 billion pri­vate loan package. Without the guarantee and the loan, the airline said it would probably have to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. 
The $1.8 billion is the largest request received by the board, double the amount that US Airways was conditionally granted earlier this year.

Waiting for What? ­
¦ by Kelly Rich ­
111
Campus Ministry Intern 
..... 
It's hard co believe the end of the semester is already so quickly approaching. Just a few months out of undergrad, I remember all too well the nervous craze of finishing up class work while at the same rime getting ready to leave for home, or trying to pack up an entire dorm room before heading 
-
into a semester abroad. 
... 
This is che context in which most of us find ourselves as the Advent season begins. fu the four Decembers of my undergraduate career came and went, it's not that I wasn't mindful of a spirit of waiting. I was waiting alright -waiting for finals to be over, the semester to be done and for Christ­
-
mas break to begin. But each year, when I finally made ir home and joined my parish for the fourth la. Sunday of Advent, I was inevitably saddened by the realization that the season had, once again, passed me by with my hardly noticing ir. And I would promise myself char rhe next year would be 
..... 
different. 
.....
Now almost one week into this year's Advem season, and remembering the promise I made to myselfso many cin~es before, I would like to invite you to chink with me about what exactly this rime of the year signifies for us as Christians. During this season we are reminded that we know neither the day nor the hour that Christ will come again, and Advent is meant, in part, to turn our minds and ­hearts to preparing for that unknown day. But the season is not simply about something far off and 
undisclosed; it is about remembering that ­Christ has already come, and that the King­111 dom, though nor fully so, is already among

come Christ for one another. How do we do this? -waiting for finals to be over, We can start by asking ourselves: Who is Christ? He is the Lord of Love. If we want to let the Lord of Love
the semester to be done and 
live in us, we must ourselves be defined by love. Perhaps
for Christmas break to begin. we can say with confidence that we love our friends and family well. And yet, Christ tells us to love even our enemies. How well do we love the person who has be­trayed us in some way, the person who we find to be stubborn, or hard of heart? "Love is the measure," Dostoevsky wrote. Let us make it our measure. 
Christ is the Prince of Peace. As violence and war increase in every part of the world, and our own country prepares for war against Iraq, we are challenged to ask ourselves if we reveal the Prince of Peace in the way we live and love. Or instead, do we argue that peace is not practical, and speak of waging a war we claim can be just. Proclaiming a message of peace and non-violence -proclaiming God's own mercy and forgiveness -is most certainly counter-cultural, but it is the message of Christ, and so for us who call ourselves Christians, can there be anything else? 
Christ is the Lamb of God. During Advent we are asked to think ofhow we make ofourselves a sacrifice for others. Do we give of our time and resources -which are economic, but are also spiritual, emotional, and intellectual -to help others? Do we seek out the lonely, the despairing, the excluded, the poor, the sick, and the hungry, in order to offer what we have to care fot what they lack? Are we liberators as Christ was, working on behalf of the oppressed and marginalized, which includes people as close as our own community and as far as other pans of the world? What gifts has God given each of us to offer for the sake ofthe rest of the Body, and do we use our gifts for this end, rather than for our own gain? 
These challenges are great, but they should not overwhelm. Rather, they should keep us hopeful, for it is in accepting them that we accept the invitation to life in Christ, and Christ's life in us. Our joy during this season of Advent is in knowing that although we wait for Christ's coming again in glory, we have the opportunity by our own lives co let him come every day on earth.

Chavez's government. howev­er. insisted oil operations were normal. Thousands of Chavez supporters staglid rallies in two · downtown Caracas plazas. 
Opposition and government delegates met with Organization of American States Secretary General Cesar Gaviria to explore resuming talks on an electoral solution to the crisis. 
Hopes for a solution grew after the national elections council voted 4-1 Tuesday to hold a nonbinding referendum on Chavez's rule on Feb. 2. Council members said their vote should overcome objections by the Supreme Court. which ruled last week at least four votes were needed. 
The opposition threatened to intensify the strike. 
"We ratify the success of this active strike, and if necessary in the coming days it will become 
even more active," said strike 
leader Carlos Ortega, president of the country's biggest group of labor unions. 
Chavez, who canceled a planned trip to Brazil on Wednesday, has insisted that the constitution allows a binding vote only halfway into his six­year presidency, in Aui,rust. He called the strike a "desperate" effort to oust him and said it would fail.

This summer I was a best man at the wedding of a close friend. I say "a" best man because, by a somewhat unorthodox arrangement, I was shar­ing the hon or with two other friends. But while we were three in Peter Wicks number, we were one in purpose: We all wanted to

Abroad
wedding was the 
best day of our friend's life, while at the same time accepting the least possible amount of responsibility. 

Two duties were absolutely unavoidable. Firstly. each of us had to wake up nightly in a cold sweat after dreaming of increasingly elaborate scenarios involving the loss of the rings (on good nights, involving the loss of the rings and Oscar Winner Halle Berry). 
Secondly, we had to organize the stag night. The stag night tradition began in England as a ritual to ward off evil spirits, but that was a long time ago. In these less superstitious times the principal purpose of the stag night is to get the maximum amount of alcohol into the groom in the shortest time possible. 
Traditionally, the stag night took place on the night before the wed­ding, but a full two weeks before the ceremony has become the norm in modern England. This gives the groom ample time to have his stom­ach pumped and let the hair grow back. Organizing the stag night requires a delicate sense of judgment: As best men it was up to us to navi­gate between the Scylla of a sober groom and the Charybdis of a dead one. (The bride was particularly insis­tent that the latter outcome would not be tolerated.) 
We did not take on the challenge empty-handed. To aid us in our duties, we had acquired the Bottle Bong, a device of such fiendish bril­liance it's hard to imagine how people ever got blood poisoning without it. 
Deceptively simple in appearance, the Bottle Bong is in essence two rub­ber tubes, a short thick one and a long thin one which fits into its side. Used correctly, the bong is capable of thrusting the entire contents of a beer bottle down the user's throat in a matter of seconds. (I don't fully understand the scientific principle involved, but I think it has something to do with quantum gravity.) With the possible exception of the Resident Evil series of video games, science has never been so much fun. 
This powerful device was ideally suited for our nefarious purposes, and yet on the back of the packet were printed the following words: not for use with alcohol. As shameless abdi­cations of responsibility go, this was almost heroic in its brazenness. It occurred to us that other companies would do well to learn from the Bottle Bong's manufacturers. For instance, Smith & Wesson might have avoided all their expensive legal difficulties by the simply selling their handguns in packaging which clearly explained that they were "under no circum­stances to be used with bullets." 
Our attempts to do permanent dam­age to the groom's liver were based solely on reverence for tradition; there was no malice involved. But that is not to say we were without griev­ance; the groom had after all man­aged to organize a wedding which, at three to zero, had what is probably the worst ratio of single best men to unmarried bridesmaids in human his­tory. 
Now, I don't want to come across as another hormonal, sex-obsessed guy, but those of you who have never 
watched close friends your own age 
get married will just have to take my 
word for it that the aphrodisiac effect 
of such events is so well-established 
as to constitute a scientific law. Since 
the wedding, all three of us have been 
feeling rather, well, not to put to fine 
a point on it, frisky. 
Shortly after the wedding Andy 
actually asked out a complete 
stranger on the street. Sh13 said "Yes," 
which is the sort of thing that hap­
pens in movies, except that she wasn't 
on the run from corrupt government 
operatives from whom she had stolen 
crucial computer files. Or if she was, 
she didn't mention it. 
Meanwhile, Mark has announced 
that he's looking for a wife, which is 
fine except that I have images of him 
going up to women and saying things 
like, "I was wondering whether you'd 
like to get some coffee sometime, 
because I'm terrified of dying alone." 
It was his birthday last month. I sent 
him a copy of "The Rules." 
As for myself, I spent most of the 
summer watching "The West Wing" 
on DVD and developing a serious 
crush on Stockard Channing. It may 
seem like a pipe dream. but according 
to the Internet she's had so many hus­
bands that from a statistical point of 
view, it's almost inevitable that we'll 
get married.

Holidays should be a time for action and change 
LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Notre Dame should decline a BCS invitation 
The Notre Dame Mission Statement claims. "The University is dedicated to the pursuit and sharing of truth for its own sake." A noble ideal by a noble institution. But is Notre Dame willing to put life to those words when the issue is football? 
I am an Iowa Hawkeye. l graduated long ago, but black and gold runs through my veins as strong as the green and gold that drives many a Notre Dame alum. Yours is a prestigious school. Its history, academic and athletic, is the stuff of legend. The University of Iowa is no lesser place, but it is less­er known. Our universities are now brought together in a controversy not of their own making, but real nonetheless. Although the issue will not be framed until this Saturday's contests are finished, the question will likely be who is more worthy of a Bowl Championship Series (BCS) bid: Iowa or Notre Dame. Make no mistake, I recognize this is not a question of biblical propor­tions. But to those who love their school's football (and no one loves it more then the legions of Notre Dame), it is an issue of some importance. 
We llawkeyes are rightly proud of our team's accomplishments this year. Lacking the opportunity to match talents in a playoff system, the Hawkeyes. like the Fighting Irish. must rely on computers and pollsters to determine their role in the ycarend beauty pageant known as the BCS. 
But college football is big business. and the BCS is college football. So. the question posed is whether Notre Dame. with a l0-2 record but unavoidable fan and media appeal. should be given a BCS berth over higher ranked 11-1 Iowa. Such issues should be decided on the field, not through binary combat. However, lacking that opportunity, record and ranking should be enough to give Iowa the BCS bowl it deserves. Unfortunately, at this point, football apparently means less than the balance sheet of viewership and attendance. 
My purpose in writing is to ask this University to demonstrate its pursuit of faith and truth. What better opportunity to rise above in a show of honor and courage then to say to the BCS, "Thanks, but no thanks." Yours is a school based on noble pursuits. Your coach is a man of integrity. Live your ideals of "truth for its own sake," and tell the BCS that at least for this one year, the University of Iowa is the better team and more deserving of a BCS bid.

The "Holiday Season" is a time full of joy in which we are thankful for family and friends. We show this love by visit­ing our favorite shopping centers, whether it is the local mall or the local bookstore, and buying gifls for our Paul Graham loved ones. We start off this sea­son by giving 
Another

Perspective

thing and every­
body. 
Thanksgiving is a day dedicated to giving thanks for all that we have -it is a reflection on our lives. This past Thanksgiving, 1gave thanks for my parents and friends; for my brother and sister and for my safe journeys. I also gave thanks that ! have a house, that I have food, that I have a job and that I have an education. 
Many people arc thankful for similar masons and for similar possessions, but this docs not give us permission to be apathetic about what others are unable to have. By being thankful. we are admitting to ourselves that we have what others do not. 
As we proclaim our thanks, we must realize that our gratitude comes from our recognition that others are not so lucky. This is recognition that others are victims of oppression and violence, attend poor schools, live paycheck to paycheck and are struggling just to make it. 
This Christmas season, in the memo­ry of Jesus Christ. many of us will come together with our families to feast and give presents. Jesus taught us how to live. He acted as an example of how to live the good life. He ate with sinners, healed the poor and criticized the wealthy and powerful for their habits and lifestyles. In memory of His life and of what He did for us, we take time off school and work to celebrate Him. 
We celebrate by going to the mall to buy presents rep­resenting our love for our family and friends. We buy Abercrombie and Fitch, Aeropostale, Tommy llilliger. Nike and the likes. We buy expen­sive chocolates. plan large feasts with fal birds as the center piece, decorate a tree with ornaments and write cards to loved ones. 
Many of us will go on consuming as if there are no problems in the world; to some, there are no major or unsolvable problems in the world. But in the other "world," the world where a majority of people throughout our country live, the world of poverty and struggle, Christmas will come with layoffs, lost homes, lower wages and bombings in 
Iraq. How is it possible to celebrate 
Christmas in the traditional American way: full of consumption and at the same time joyfully? This Christmas will still be Jesus' birthday. the celebration 
most likely will still continue, but the authentic joy is gone. Instead, sorrow will permeate the lives of those affected by greedy economic and foreign poli­cy. Many of us will try to for­
get and go on shopping and buying and 
consuming like the good capitalist Americans 

we are, the way our President so confidently commanded us to do. But how can there be Christmas when so many are unemployed, in poverty, going hungry and left home­less? This is injustice. 
How can we. as students at Notre Dame, celebrate the Christmas season when many workers on this campus are afraid to speak up about their con­ditions, when they have no real voice or bargaining ability with the adminis­tration and when they are often over­worked? 
I am not requesting that we remem­ber and pray for others who have less or pray for workers' rights here or 
elsewhere. We have all heard this 
request, and many of us have followed 
through. I am asking more of each of' 
us. I am asking that we dedicate our­
selves -starting now. starting this 
Christmas season -to working for 
change. I am asking that we nut only 
remember others when we open our 
presents. but also that we work for a 
more just world. This is our gift to 
those we will never meet in life. 
We have an obligation to do more and to work for more. We have an obligation to light for the poor of our country and of the world. We have an obligation to make sacrifices, to give up some of our possessions -to opt for the poor by doing everything we can. We have to change how we live. We cannot let Wal-mart tell us how to love each other, nor should we allow McDonald's tell us how to cat. We must start working for peace and justice. 
Christmas is meant to be a time of joy. but how can we ignore what is happening in the world right now? This is what Jesus asked us to do, and this is· what we must do. We should not brush off the widespread poverty and suffer­ing of this country. We have an obliga­tion to do more.

MOVIE REVIEW 

Bond returns for 'Another Day' 
By C. SPENCER BEGGS 
Scene Editor 

While "Die Another Day" is the 20th installment in the James Bond franchise. this film pounds the final nail into Bond creator Ian flcmming's coffin. The series has long since forgotten the heydays of Sean Connery's dashing secret agent. The recent slew of Bond films seem to have dropped the secret part: Bond is more like­ly to pull out his Berretta and blast American secret agent. Jinx isn't the run­of-the-mill "oh. James" Bond girl. rather she's Bond's equal in every way. Of course, she's still uncontrollably attracted to him. 
"Die Another Day" doesn't really have an innovative plot, but it is an incredible trib­ute to the franchise. For example. when Bond first sees Jinx emerge from the ocean ala Phoebe Cates from "Fast Times at Ridegcmont High," the shot (and bikini) are recreations of the entrance of the first Bond girl, Honey Ryder (Ursella Andrews), from the first Bond movje, 1962's "Dr.

Stephens, John Cleese
and there's still plenty of classic 
Bond elements that show through. 

"Die Another Day" begins with Bond (Pierce Brosnan) surfing on typhoon-like waves onto the coast of North Korea to stop the sale of some high tech military equipment to a obtusely evil warmonger general by impersonating the moneyman. But Bond's plan is botched when he's almost instantly recognized. After a slightly tough to swallow hovertank battle, Bond is captured and tortured in a prison as the classic opening sequence of writhing sil­houettes of naked women dance to the Bond theme song, this time covered by Madonna. 
Bond is eventually ransomed by M6 when the name of one of their agents is broadcast from the prison. Thinking Bond had cracked his cool. his boss, M (Dame Judi Dench), makes a prisoner swap. Back in an M6 medical facility, M rescinds Bond's double-0 status. Bond, of course, immediately escapes and begins an investi­gation into who set him up, taking him all around the globe including exotic locations like Havana and Iceland. But Bond doesn't have to take this one on alone; Halle Berry joins as the latest Bond girl named Jinx, an Bond. "Die Another 
Day" even come deliciously close to parodying itself ala "Austin Powers;" the bad guy has a conve­niently placed Earth-destroying laser beam in space. 
"Die Another Day" suffers from a bit of awkward acting. Surprisingly, a lot of this comes from Berry who sounds like she's reading from a children's book at times. Even worse is a bit part written in for Madonna; while she contributes a decent theme song, there should be a constitution­al amendment forbidding her from appear­ing in movies ever again. 
And like other recent Bond films, the bad guy has to have a justification for why he's evil. This time it's because his father didn't love him enough. Seriously, audiences can probably accept an old school irrational drive to destroy the world from any guy who has his own laser beam in space. 
The film muscles through most of these difficulties. Brosnan has mastered his ver­sion of Bond and carries the film. Of course. he's aided by a bunch of cool new gadgets like an invisible Aston Martin and a shockwave ring. A:nd the Bond girls aren't exactly unappealing either. 
But Berry may end up being more than

one of Bond's conquests; there's been a considerable buzz in Hollywood that MGM may spin-off the Jinx into a new franchise of secret agent films. Perhaps this may end up being a profitable venture', but given Berry's lackluster performance in "Die Another Day," MGM might be well advised to let Jinx work her voodoo in just one film like the other memorable but oh so forget­table Bond girls.

THE ARBITER OF TASTE 
Moore bowls a strike in 'Columbine' 
Michael Moore's latest documentary is a curious case of' slovenly brilliance. The unanimous winner of the Jury Prize at the Cannes Film Festival this spring, "Bowling for Columbine" became the first documentary to compete in the competition in 46 years. Ever since 1989's "Hoger and Mc," Michael Moore has offered us a candid and satirical look at the absurd 
in American cul­
ture. 
This lime Moore sets a table or criti­cal inquiry over America's gun­craze with servings of media mania and corporate controversy. invites president of the National Hitle Association Charlton Heston, James Nichols (broth­er of Timothy McVeigh partner Terry Nichols) and Marilyn Manson for candid interviews and lays out the April 1999 Columbine High School tragedy as the centerpiece. 
The film takes its title from reports that students Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold went bowling the morning before they went on their killing spree in Littleton, Colo. "Columbine" follows Moore on his quest to !ind out why America suffers from an epidemic of murder. 
Moore begins his search for answers by opening an account at a Michigan bank that gives new customers a free gun. While flipping though their cata­logue of rifles he asks incredulously, "You mean you're a bank and a licensed lirearms dealer?" 
Ile then travels to one of the world's largest weapons manufacturer, Lockheed Martin, which is located just a few miles from Columbine High and takes a tour. While there he points out that the United States dropped its largest amount of bombs during the war in Kosovo the morning of the Columbine shootings. Moore also has a very scary visit with Terry Nichols in which Nichols explains just how easy it is to make a bomb and later tells Moore how Timothy

Michael Moore's documentary "Bowling for Columbine" Is a crltlcal look at the epidemic of violent crime In America. The film consists mostly of candid Interviews with celebrities on topics from guns and racism to corporate greed. 
McVeigh was "a nice guy" during the months he stayed at Terry's house. 
Moore also serves up a few surprises. Dick Clark of "American Bandstand" fame turns out to be not such a nice guy and Charlton Heston reveals he is a racist. while Marilyn Manson (whose music was initially cited as partly to blame for the shootings at Columbine) turns out to be thoughtful and eloquent. He also interviews a few students and a politician in Canada where 7 million guns are present in 10 million house­holds but murder is practically nonexist­ent about issues such as healthcare, unemployment, welfare, the media and why they think America has such a problem with guns. 
While interviewing a college professor who recently wrote a book on what the media chooses to cover and why, the man tells Moore that although gun relat­ed violence has decreased by 20 percent in the last 15 years, news coverage of it has increased 600 percent. Half of the film is made up entirely by interviews and that is where Moore shows his genius. Although he sometimes uses the camera as both a pulpit and as a way to bully people, which happens when he takes his crusade to Kmart headquar­ters, Moore does his best work by simply getting people to speak candidly about their views. Most of what was educa­tional and terrifying in this film actually came from people just answering hon­estly about what they thought. 
What makes "Columbine" a solid film is that Moore does his homework by sighting very interesting facts and statis­tics. Moore points out that the NRA was founded in 1871, the same year that the KKK was declared an illegal terrorist organization and that 33 million people in the U.S. live in poverty. He illustrates that the requested increase for the against the Soviets. While all of this information flashes on the silver screen. we hear Louis Armstrong's "What a Wonderful World" playing in the back­ground. 
Moore can either been viewed as tak­ing things too far in this film about vio­lence in America or he can be seen as a whistleblower who does not cut his enemy any unnecessary slack. Rarely clean-shaven and always with his shirt un-tucked, Moore can sometimes come across as a too slovenly and conde­scending to make an honest documen­tary. He points his linger sharply at both corporate America and American for­eign policy in both the recent Bush and Clinton administrations, which has the potential to make some viewers a little uncomfortable.

The film is also served well by its edit­ing and music. Moore chooses clips from local and national news stations depict­ing messages meant to scare and manip­ulate people. fie points out that Americans live in a media culture and contrasts relatively non-dramatic clips from the BBC news with those from the United States in which the anchor's voice carries shrill. alarmed tones and suspenseful music plays in the back­ground.

"Bowling for Columbine" is a film that is designed to affect its viewers and is hugely successful in this attempt. In my experience, it left most of its audience either walking out of the theater or in thankful applause. While no doubt Moore certainly has his detractors. as will "Columbine," his insights and irony arc brilliant. It is unfortunate that this film probably will be missed by those who need to see it most.

Sollmann tabbed as preseason Big East Player of the Year 
Special to The Observer 
The preseason accolades have started to pour in for the Notre Dame baseball team, with junior second baseman Steve Sollmann and sophomore righthander Grant Johnson earning individ­ual honors while the Irish have been picked to repeat as Big East conference champions. 
The National College Baseball 

... 
Writers Association named Sollmann a preseason second team All-American while the Big East coaches tabbed him as the 2003 preseason Big East Player of the Year. Johnson was named a third team NCBWA prcseason All-American and joined Sollmann on the 15-player pre­season all-Big East team. 
Sollmann -whose .362 career batting average ranks ninth in Notre Dame history -overcame an injury-plagued first half of the 2002 season by hitting .561 f23­for-41) in nine 2002 NCAA Tournament games. He also had 12 runs batted in. scored 15 runs, made just one error and did not strike out in those nine NCAA games. 
After batting just .171 through his first 11 games of the 2002 season, Sollmann recovered to match his 2001 mark and post a .362 season batting average. He finished among the Big East overall 2002 leaders in hits (fifth), runs (fifth) and triples (fourth). Sollmann's other season stats included 47 RBI. two home runs, eight doubles, 6-of-6 stolen bases and just eight errors in 59 games played (.969 fielding pct.). 
His clutch hitting included a .443 hatting average with run­ners in scoring position, high­lighted by the game-tying hit in the ninth-inning rally that elimi­nated Rice from the College World Series. 

Johnson -who earned Freshman All-America honors from Baseball America and Collegiate Baseball -capped his stellar rookie season by earn­ing a spot on the U.S. National Team. He was part of the start­ing rotation on an elite staff that set a Team USA record with its 
1.48 summer ERA. 
Johnson's freshman season with the Irish included a 3.46 ERA in 18 appearances. The 6-6, 220-pounder led the Big East in overall innings pitched (101.1) while ranking second among Big East players in overall wins (9­5). third in starts (14) and sixth in strikeouts (86). His other 2002 stats included 44 walks. 94 hits allowed, a .249 opponent batting average, five wild pitches and nine hit hatters. 
Collegiate Baseball named Johnson the national pitcher of the week after his one-hit, one­walk performance in the 25-1 NCAA Tournament win over South Alabama -becoming just the 13th pitcher, and fourth since 1981, ever to toss a no-hit­ter or one-hitter in the NCAAs, He followed up that win with an opening-game victory in the Super Regional round at top­ranked Florida State. 
Notre Dame received nine of a maximum 10 first-place votes in the Big East preseason poll. Other top teams in the poll were Virginia Tech, Boston College and Rutgers.

Wagner scores 29 as Cavaliers end 15-game skid 
a 16-0 spurt that took up the first half of the fourth quarter. Elden Campbell had a jumper, a layup after an offensive rebound and a pair of free throws during the run, while Courtney Alexander hit two free throws and a 3­pointcr that gave the Hornets a 77-60 lead with just under six minutes left. 
Toronto failed to score on eight straight possessions during the run, missing seven shots -one al'ter an offensive rebound ­and turning the ball over twice. 
Jamaal Mashburn scored 10 for New Orleans, as did Campbell coming off the bench. 
Both teams struggled in the first half. 
Four minutes into the second quarter the Hornets were shout­ing about 25 percent and looking sluggish compared to their victo­ry in Chicago a night earlier. But the Haptors could only push their lead as high as nine. 
New Orleans then put together a quick 7-0 run to tie the game at 31. It started with a 3-pointcr from Mashburn. 
Davis followed with layup after putting the ball behind his back during the drive. 
Davis then stoic the ball and dunked. 
The teams fought evenly through the rest of the period. After Carter caught a high pass in the lane and converted a reverse dunk, the Hornets missed their next shot, but Davis stole the ball back quickly and fed Magloire for a tomahawk jam to give the Hornets a 41-40 lead at halftime.

CLEVELAND 

Rookie Dajuan Wagner scored 29 points to help the Cleveland Cavaliers snap their 15-game losing streak with a 111-101 vic­tory over tho Chicago Bulls. 
Hookie Carlos Boozer and Hicky Davis each scored 26 poinls for the Cavs, who won for the lirsl time since a home-open­ing triumph over the Nl3A cham­pion Los Angeles takers on Nov. 
5. The losing streak was four shy of the franchise's worst single­season loss string, set at the end of the 1981-82 season. 
Jalen Hose scored 37 points to lead the Bulls, who have lost eight straight and 14 of 16. 
Cleveland's two rookies missed all rour of their shots in the fourth quarter as Chicago cut a 20-point deficit to four. Boozer went scoreless and Wagner had only one point in the period. 
Hose sparked a 23-7 charge that brought the Bulls within 103-99 with 1:38 to play. Davis drove for a layup 17 seconds later for a 105-99 lead and hit two free throws with 41 seconds left to make it 107-99. 
The announced attendance of 7,295 was the lowest for a Cleveland home game since Jan. 6, 1988, when 7,017 saw a victo­ry over the L.A. Clippers. 
Davis returned from a two­game suspension by coach John Lucas for an on-court argument with teammate Tyrone Hill last Friday. 
Before the g,l!:me, Davis addressed the issue for the first time and said his outburst came out of the frustration of losing. 
Hill also returned after missing two games with a sprained left ankle. He had nine rebounds as Cleveland controlled the boards,. 56-38. 
Sixers 99, Celtics 93 
Allen Iverson had 27 points and Derrick Coleman scored a season-high 20 as the Philadelphia 76ers extended their winning streak to eight and stayed perfect at home with vic­tory over the Boston Celtics. 
Eric Snow made a spinning 12­foot jumper to break a 92-92 tie, and Coleman made a 3-pointer with 1:10 left to cap a 9-0 run and give Philadelphia a 97 -92 lead. Iverson made two free throws with 28 seconds left to seal the win. 
Keith Van Horn had 13 points and matched a season-high with 13 rebounds, and Snow added 13 points and eight assists for the 76ers, who are 10-0 at home. The start is Philadelphia's best since winning 22 in a row to begin the 1966-67 season. It is the longest home winning streak since 1999. 
Paul Pierce had 34 points, Antoine Walker had 19 points, nine rebounds and seven assists and Walter McCarty scored 10 for the Celtics. 
A driving layup by Walker gave the Celtics a 92-88 lead with 
3:36 left. Snow answered with a layup to pull the 76ers within two, and a leaner by Iverson knotted the score at 92. 
After trailing by as many as 16 in the first half, Philadelphia came back to tie the score at 60 when Iverson made a 3-pointer with 6:40 left in the third. The Sixers scored 13 of the last 16 points of the quarter to lead 75­71 after three. 
After a 3-pointer by McCarty, Boston took a 54-38 advantage with 2:45 left in the first half. The 76ers then scored 11 of the last 13 points to pull within seven, 56-49, at the break. 
Wizards 88, Pistons 83 
Jerry Stackhouse and Michael Jordan combined for 16 points in the fourth quarter as the Washington Wizards beat the Detroit Pistons. 
The game marked Stackhouse's first regular-season appearance at the Palace since being traded from the Pistons to the Wizards for Richard Hamilton in September. 
Stackhouse and Jordan each scored eight points in the final period, and both finished with 
21. 

Chucky Atkins led Detroit with 17 and Cliff Robinson and Richard Hamilton had 16 each. 
The game was tied at 81 with 
1:30 to play when Jordan rebounded a miss by Larry Hughes and was fouled by Robinson. He hit both free throws, and after Ben Wallace missed at the other end, Stackhouse made one of two from the line to make it 84-81 with 54 seconds left. 
Stackhouse fouled Hamilton, who made one of two free throws. Jordan lost the ball out of bounds under pressure from Atkins, and Brendan Haywood fouled Robinson at the other end. Robinson missed the second of two free throws, leaving Detroit down 84-83 with 16.5 seconds left. 
Robinson then fouled Jordan, who made both shots to give the Wizards a three-point edge. Atkins missed a long 3-pointer, and Stackhouse put the game away with two free throws. 
Hornets 89, Raptors 74 
Baron Davis returned from a two-game absence to score 18 points as the New Orleans Hornets defeated the Toronto Raptors. 
Davis, who has a herniated disc in his back, started stow, hit­ting one of his first four shots and turning the ball over once. But his ballhandling and passing looked sharp after that, including several spin and behind-the-back moves as he drove to the hoop. 
Davis also had eight rebounds, and his five assists could have been higher if several crisp pass­es inside hadn't been mishandled or ended up as missed shots. 
Jamaal Magloire added 16 points and P.J. Brown 15 for New Orleans. now 10-0 at home. 
Vince Carter scored 26 for Toronto, but he had little help as the Raptors shot 36 percent (30­of-83) and went stone cold dur­ing a critical stretch of the fourth quarter. Antonio Davis had 11 rebounds but shot only 1-for-15 from the field. Alvin Williams scored 13 for Toronto.

Judge awards $506 million to 46 videotaped athletes 
Associated Pren 
CHICAGO 
A federal judge has ordered eight companies and three people to pay $506 million to 46 male college athletes who were secretly videotaped in locker rooms, restrooms and showers. 
The videotapes were sold through Internet sites advertis­ing "hot younger dudes." 
"We look at this judgment as the court system sending a sig­nal to the sexual predators that they're not going to get away with this," said attorney 

Cindy Fluxgold, who repre­sents several of the athletes. 
U.S. District Court Judge Charles P. Kocoras' decision, handed down last week, grants each of the 46 plaintiffs $1 mil­lion in compensatory damages and $10 million in punitive damages. The remainder of the $506 million award pays costs and attorneys' fees. 
Kocoras also ordered the defendants to surrender the videotapes and get out of the business of making and selling them. 
The tapes, with names such as "Straight Off the Mat" and "Voyeur Time," first came to light in April 1999, when the Chicago Tribune reported that hidden-camera videotapes, including footage taken during a 1995 wrestling tournament at Northwestern University, were being marketed online and by mail. 
No criminal charges were filed. Illinois has since enacted a law making it illegal to secretly film anyone in locker rooms or bathrooms. 
Fluxgold said that the 46 unnamed plaintiffs represent a fraction of the men caught on tape, many of whom have not been identified. She said she didn't have an accurate count of how many athletes were videotaped, but that the num­ber is "in the multiple hun­dreds of people." 
The lawsuit alleged invasion of privacy, unlawful use of (he plaintiffs' images for monetary gain, and mail and wire fraud under the federal Hacketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. 
The plaintiffs, who were granted anonymity by the court, are described in the lawsuit as 28 "John Does" and ~unknown Illinois State University football players." 
The lawsuit says they are past or present athletes at 

Northwestern, Illinois, Illinois State, Eastern Illinois, Indiana, Penn, Iowa State and Michigan State. 
Kocoras· judgment was entered against Franco Production, Franko Productions, Rodeo, Hidvidco, Hidvidco-Atlas Video Release, AMO Video, Atlas Video, Gamport/Earthlink, and indi­viduals Daniel Franco, George Jachem and R.D. Couture. 
The District Court clerk's office said no attorneys had appeared on behalf of the defendants since at least 2000. No telephone numbers could immediately be found. 
NCAA BASKETBALL 

Webber's father admits receiving gifts from booster 
Associated Press 
DETROIT 
The father of former Michigan basketball star Chris Webber acknowledged in testi­mony before a federal grand jury that he took gifts from a banned booster. 
Mayce Webber Jr.'s admis­sion in court documents was the first time he publicly acknowledged taking anything from Eddie Martin, who plead­ed guilty in May to money laun­dering and admitted lending $616,000 to four former Michigan players. The Detroit News reported Wednesday. 

Webber Jr., his son and sis­ter-in-law, Charlene Johnson, were indicted in September for conspiring to obstruct justice and making a false statement to a grand jury. All three have pleaded innocent. Each charge is punishable by up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine. 
Webber Jr. "acknowledged that Martin had given some gifts to him, and Martin put a hotel bill on a charge card and was paid back," his lawyer, Hobert Morgan, said in a request last month in U.S. 
District Court that the indict­ment to he dismissed. Morgan declined comment Tuesday. Webber Jr. testified in June 2000. 
According to the News, a uni­versity report said that Martin paid for a hotel room for an unidentified player's father and apparently was repaid in cash. Martin violated NCAA rules when he paid for the room. 
Prosecutors said Martin gave the Webber family $280,000 between 1988 and 1993, but Webber Jr. denied the claims in March. 
Now with the Sacramento Kings, Chris Webber told the grand jury in August 2000 that he took gifts from Martin in high school, but couldn't remember whether he took money while at Michigan, according to a partial transcript of his testimony. 
Steven Levy, who represents Webber Jr.'s sister-in-law, Johnson, said she wouldn't accept any plea bargain ·and doubted any of the three defen­dants would plead guilty to a lesser offense. 
Attorneys for the Webbers won't comment on possibilities of a plea bargain. 

U.S. 
District Judge Nancy Edmunds will meet with attor­neys Monday to decide when to hear defense motions calling for the prosecution's indictment to be thrown out. 

Keith Corbett, head of the 

U.S. 
attorney's organized crime strike force in Detroit, said if the trials were scheduled dur­ing the NBA season, Webber would still be expected to show up. 


The government may seek to delay Martin's Feb. 20 sentenc­ing until after he testifies at a criminal trial.

NHL 
Sharks hire Wilson as new head coach 
SAN JOSE, Calif. 

Hon Wilson was hi.red to coach the San Jose Sharks, days after Lhe team fired Darryl Sutter and his two assistants. 
Wilson, fired by Washington lasL May after four mostly suc­cessfu I seasons. coached the 
U.S. team in the 1998 Olympics and in two World Cups. He also spent four years as the first coach of' division rival Anaheim. 
The Sharks moved quickly to fill lhcir vacancy with a veteran coach. Sutter. the winningest coach in franchise history, was fired on Sunday along with assistants Hich Preston and Lorne Molleknn in a surprising shakeup of' a struggling team that aspires to be a Stanley Cup contender. 
"Hon Wilson is an experi­enced NHL coach with a strong truck record in both the regu­lar season and the playoffs," Sharks general manager Dean Lombardi said in a release. 
The Sharks struggled to an 8­12-2-2 start that put them in las l place in the Pacific Division. but they got a 3-2 overtime victory over Phoenix on Tuesday night with scout Cap Bander and team executive Doug Wilson coaching the team. 
Hon Wilson got his first head coaching job in Anaheim in 1993. In his fourth year with the Mighty Ducks, Wilson coached Teemu Selanne, who is now the Sharks' leading goal scorer. 
Wilson had his greatest suc­cess in Washington, where he led the Capitals to the Stanley Cup finals in 1998. He won two division titles, and he led Washington to 102 points in the 2000-01 season -more points than the Sharks have earned in any of their 12 sea­sons. 
Wilson had been out of coaching since leaving Washington, where the Capitals missed the playolfs by two points following a 36-3:i­11-2 season. He apparently was the only candidate inter­viewed by Lombardi, who promised his search wouldn't take more than a few days. 
Wilson will make his debut as the Sharks' sixth permanent head coach on Friday night, when San Jose hosts Columbus. Following Saturday night's home game against Nashville, the Sharks have four days off, which will allow Wilson to further implement his plans. 
Sutter led the Sharks to five consecutive seasons of improved point totals, but was fired after San Jose's slow start. 
NFL 

Faulk may start Sunday vs. Chiefs 
A.sociated Press 
ST. LOUIS 

There's a chance St. Louis Rams running back Marshall Faulk could make his first start in four weeks Sunday at Kansas City. 
Faulk played as a reserve last week after missing two games with a high sprain on his right ankle, and he ran nine times for 29 yards. Head coach Mike Martz said that Faulk was "no worse for the wear." 
Offensive tackle Orlando Pace might miss the rest of the season with what Martz characterized as a "significant hamstring tear." 
"If we have him back at the end of the year for a game, I think we'd be very fortunate," the coach said. 
Martz said rookie Lamar Gordon, despite continued fum­bling problems, probably would get his third straight start at tail­back. But he left the door open for Faulk. who again is listed as questionable. 
"I don't know where Marshall is for sure." Martz said. "As the week goes on, if he feels real good, then we'll start him. But that'll be up to Marshall." 
Martz said the injury isn't going to heal before the olfseason. 
"I think this is something he's going to have to deal with," Martz said. "It probably won't get a whole heck of a lot better through the rest of the season, so we'll monitor that." 
Quarterbacks Kurt Warner and Marc Bulger also were listed as questionable, although Warner is expected to miss at least two weeks with a broken hand. Bulger has made slow progress after spraining a ligament on his right index linger Nov. 18 against the Rears. Martz said he would like to hold him out of practice all week. 
Martz added that Bulger's fin­ger can be taped to allow him to throw Sunday if needed. He'll probably be the backup behind Jamie Martin, although the Rams also re-signed Scott Covington. 

MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL 
Sox' Tho111as running out of time 
Associated Press 

CHICAGO Frank Thoma.<; is running out of time to find a better deal. 
The two-time AL MVP has until Dec. 7 to sign with another club or return to his existing contract with the Chicago White Sox. Thomas is testing the free agent market for the first time in his career after the White Sox invoked a contract clause that allows them to defer most of his $10 million salary. 
"Frank's a free agent, and he's still out there exploring," White Sox general manager Kenny Williams said. ''He will inform us on the seventh as to what he's found and we'll continue to moni­tor it up until that date. At that point and time, on the seventh, I'll have more to say on the subject." 
But odds are Thomas will find himself back in a White Sox uni­form again next season. The free agent market is tighter than in recent years with the luxury tax looming, and there's been little visible interest in the slugger. 
If Thomas does stay in Chicago, his paychecks are going to have a few less zeros. 
Thomas signed a contract in 1997 that was to pay him $9,927,000 in each of the next four seasons, including $3,827,000 deferred with 7 .73 percent compounded interest. But because he didn't make the All-Star team, didn't finish among the top 10 in MVP voting and didn't win a Silver Slugger this season, the White Sox invoked what's called the "diminished skills" clause, allowing them to cut his upfront salary.

Alabama head coach Dennis Franchione looks on in his team's game against Oklahoma earlier this season. Franchione is rumored to be the leading to replace R.C. Slocum as head coach at Texas A&M. 
Franchione to Aggies rum.ors continue

NCAA FOOTBALL 


Associated Press 
COi.LEGE STATION, Texas 
Texas A&M president Robert Gates declined to confirm reports that school officials had received per­mission to speak with Alabama coach Dennis Franchione about becom­ing the Aggies coach. 
Told that Alabama ath­letic director Mal Moore confirmed Wednesday that A&M officials had asked for and received permission to talk with Franchione, Gates only replied, "That sounds reliable." 
Gates, speaking face-to­face to reporters for the first time since firing coach R.C. Slocum on Monday, wouldn't go into detail about the plans for replac­ing the 14-year head coach. 

"We have a process under way in looking for a new coach," Gates said. "I hope we'll have some results soon. That's all I'll say about the future." 
Gates also wasn't specific about a timetable for find­ing Slocum's replacement. 
"I hope soon," he said. 
Franchione has for sever­al weeks been considered a possible replacement for Slocum. even before the coach was fired Monday, three days after a 50-20 loss to Texas that ended a 6-6 regular season. That matched the Aggies' worst record in 14 seasons under Slocum. 
Franchione Jed Alabama to a 17 -8 record over the past two seasons, finishing at 10-3 this season after 21-16 victory at Hawaii on Saturday night. 
The Crimson Tide, which is on NCAA probation for recruiting violations that occurred before Franchione took the job, isn't eligible for a bowl game this year or next year. 
Franchione hasn't yet signed a contract extension with Alabama reported to be worth $15 million over 10 years. 
"I will not impede coach Franchione in any manner if he wishes to talk to A&M," Moore said in a statement. "However, I want to stress that we want coach Franchione to finish his coaching career at the University of Alabama. 
"We have made what we feel is a strong and fair contractual offer for him to stay." 
Before going to Alabama, Franchione was at TCU for three seasons. He led the Horned Frogs, 1-10 the year before he arrived, to three straight bowl games and the share of the WAC title his last two years.

IN BRIEF 

LeCiair out 10 to 12 weeks 
Flyers star John LeClair had shoul­der surgery and is expected to be out 10 to 12 weeks. 
The 33-year-old left wing left the hospital in minimal pain within a few hours of the operation with his arm in a sling, Dr. Peter Deluca said. 
Whether LcClair immediately begins rehabilitation will depend on how he feels Thursday, Deluca said. 
Deluca, the team orthopedist. was one of two surgeons who operated at Hahnemann University Hospital. 
LeClair injured his shoulder after colliding with Pittsburgh defenseman Marc Bergevin last week. 
A three-time 50-goal scorer, LeClair was plagued by back injuries in recent years, twice having surgery. He had 25 goals and 26 assists last season and played every game. He has 11 goals and six assists this season. 
LeClair had surgery in July to clean out scar tissue and was pain-free until his shoulder injury. 
He is the team's highest-paid play­er, signing a five-year, $45 million contract in 2001. 
Prentice signs with Arizona 
Running back Travis Prentice signed with the Arizona Cardinals on Wednesday after being cut by the Houston Texans in training camp. 
Thomas Jones broke a hand two weeks ago, leaving Arizona with just two running backs -Marcel Shipp and Damien Anderson. Jones told the Cardinals he slammed his hand against a counter while trying to answer a phone at home. 
To make room for Prentice, Arizona released safety Don Morgan. 
Prentice has been out of football since the Texans cut him. He was Cleveland's third-round draft pick in 2000 and led the Browns in rushing as a rookie with 512 yards on 173 carries. 
He was traded to Minnesota last year and appeared in 14 games, pri­marily on special teams. He was waived by the Vikings on May 2. 
Prentice, 5-foot-11 and 221 pounds, set NCAA career records in points, rushing touchdowns and overall touchdowns in four seasons at Miami of Ohio. 
Browns great Reynolds dies 
Billy Reynolds, a kick returner on the Cleveland Browns' championship team in 1954, died at 71. 
Reynolds died at the suburban Bedford Medical Center. He had been recuperating from hip replacement surgery. 
In 1954, Reynolds led the NFL in kickoff returns. He set up two touch­downs with punt returns in the Browns' victory against the Detroit Lions in the title game that season. 
The 5-foot-10 haltback played in college at Pittsburgh, where he was known as "The Rock." Reynolds was drafted by the Browns in the second round 
His funeral is Saturday in Northfield, Ohio.

Bowl. Washington State and Iowa would play in the Rose Bowl and USC and the Big 12 champ would meet in the Orange Bowl. 
The Irish still have a narrow chance of squeaking into a BCS bowl. If 7-4 UCLA beats 9-2 Washington State, USC would win the Pac-10 title and the automatic Rose Bowl berth awarded to the confer­ence champion. where they would probably face Iowa. That frees up an at-large bid that would most likely be given to Notre Dame. 
If Miami makes the Fiesta Bowl, the Orange Bowl would be able to select its at-large team first. 
In addition to Notre Dame, an Orange Bowl official said the bowl is also considering 10-2 Kansas State, which promised the ·orange Bowl Tuesday it would buv 25,000 tickets if selected. · 

Another, more unlikely, sce­nario involves undefeated Miami losing to 9-3 Virginia Tech this weekend. 
The loss would move 11-1 Georgia into the national championship game and pos­sibly knock USC out of its automatic spot. 
Then the Sugar Bowl could select Notre Dame. 
Minutes after Notre Dame lost to USC 44-13, Irish coach Tyrone Willingham started arguing his team's case for a BCS berth. 
"The case is that we've played 12 ballgames and we've won 10 of those ball­games," he said. "We've been a very improved and very sound football team. This one game can not be a true indi­cator of that." 
But Willingham's campaign­ing won't have any impact unless UCLA wins Saturday.

The Notre Dame mens swim­ming and diving team will have plenty of chances to show its talent in the pool this weekend. 
The Irish host the Notre Dame Invitational starting today at Rolfs Aquatic Center. Five other teams will be in attendance at the three-day event -Virginia, Louisville. Wyoming, North Dakota tunity for the freshmen to see what the championship format is like at the college level," Obringer said. 
At the Invitational, look for the relays to be close races. Several teams from the com­peting schools have similar times, and winning the valu­able double relay points could give a school the edge in win­ning the Invitational.

preparation for the meet. Several of the participating teams have faced one another or common opponents already this season. Louisville lost to West Virginia and TCU -a team the Irish defeated Nov. 
16. Wyoming beat North Dakota in a dual meet earlier. 
The three-day format will be a test of the swimmers' endurance and focus. Team unity and support is crucial in keeping the athletes motivated all weekend. 
"Having a good team atmos­phere while we're out there has a bigger effect than other people think," Randolph said. "Just staying motivated and cheering for each other is really huge." 
The Notre Dame Invitational will be a great opportunity for the Irish (4-3) to make a state­ment in the pool and prepare themselves for important upcoming meets. 
The Invitational will take place all day today, Friday and Saturday.

T i m Randolph said Wyoming and North Dakota also have swimmers with fast times. 
Notre Dame will look to dominate the field after a close loss to a talented Purdue team. The three-day meet for­mat is similar to the schedule of the Big East Championships in February. 
"We feel really prepared for this meet," Obringer said. "It will be a good marker of where we are with our season right now." 
The Irish will concentrate on qualifying swimmers for the Big East Championships, espe­cially the freshmen.

and they play defense like USC and we thought that would be an advantage for us to have had a game like that, so we thought we'd be a little more ready," McGraw said. "But we actually looked really unpre­pared." 
The Irish saw domination only once in the game. In the opening minutes of the second half, after allowing the Crusaders to score on two Jeanette Gray free-throws, Notre Dame scored 12 unan­swered points in three min­utes, taking a 42-30 lead with 15 minutes left to play. 
"We got out and were able to transition and got some easy baskets," McGraw said. "That's what we had not been getting and did not get outside of that little stretch." 
After that. it was a struggle for Notre Dame to keep the lead. With just under five min­utes remaining, Le 'Tania Severe, who had the best Notre Dame defensive perfor­mance along with 15 points, scored Notre Dame's last field goal. It was all foul shooting for the rest of the game. In fact, in the second half of play, Notre Dame scored 23 points on foul shots; the Irish only scored 20 points from the floor.

. No. 9 Irish have trouble with Valparaiso, but escape with 74-. 68 victory 
By KA TIE McVOY Associate Sports Editor 
VALPARAISO, Ind. The war wasn't holy. Nonetheless, the crusade 

was on. 
Valparaiso was on a quest to end its 15-game losing streak to Notre Dame, and the Crusaders almost reached the promised land. 
With just under two minutes

win. 
"We played fearlessly," said Crusaders guard Kathy Knoester, who totaled 14 points in a strong second half of play. 
Under tho leadership of junior Suzie Hammel, who scored 17 points, the Crusaders played above and beyond the expectations of their opponent. In the first half. Valparaiso rebounded from a nine-point deficit to bring the game within three as the teams headed into the locker room. 
"I thought Hammel was out­standing," McGraw said. "She was impossible for us to guard . .. We just didn't have an 

left, ihe Crusaders were trailing the ninth­ranked Irish by only seven. 
But the Irish won the final battle, and Notre Dame man­aged the 7 4­68 victory. · 

''This has-been a tough place to play. ... We're thinking about not coming here anymore." 
Muffet McGraw Irish coach 
But right now, they don't want to have to fight again. 
"This has been a tough place for us to play," Irish coach Muffet McGraw said. " ... We're thinking about not com­ing here anymore." 
Valparaiso came out ready to play. The Crusaders looked intense, they looked prepared, and, most importantly, they looked like they wanted to answer for her. She did pretty much whatever she wanted to." 
The lrish, on the other h a n d  looked any­thing but ready to play and 

McGraw had to keep her team focused on the task at hand. In the first half, Notre Dame only out-rebounded its much small­er opponent by two. The Irish looked sluggish and, despite facing a similar defense in USC, the offense looked like it was completely unfamiliar with its opponent.
