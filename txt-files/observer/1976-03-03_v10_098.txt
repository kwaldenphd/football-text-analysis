Fall completion slated for Huddle renovation 
by Chris Hopkins 
Staff Reoorter 
and 
Don Reimer Senior Staff Reporter 
The renovation and expansion of the Huddle will cost the University $300.000 and should be completed by the end of the fall semester, Bro. Just Paczesny, vice president for student affairs, has announced. 
Paczesny revealed the future plans for the Huddle at a town meeting two weeks ago. Among the revisions will be the addition of a Baskin-Robbins ice cream counter and the expansion of the Huddle's dining facilities to include a large Barnaby-style restaurant. 
The construction of the restaur­ant facility will necessitate extend­ing the Huddle over the roof of the pool room in LaFortune. An artist's conception of the restaurant shows a setting with heavy oak furniture and barrel-back chairs. Lighting fixtures will extend from the var­ious wooden beams creating what Paczesny envisions as "a cozy, softly lighted dining area." 
The new restaurant, which will be run by Notre Dame Food Service, will feature a menu that varies according to the patrons' demands. The menu will offer a fare ranging from steaks to pizza and hamburgers. besides the selec-

Also. because this restaurant will have extended hours to meet varying customer demands, the menu will vary with the hours, according to Paczesny. 
John Reid, assistant director of Student Activities, expressed hope that the new restaurant will attract a variety of people to the student center and allow for a mixing among students and faculty mem­bers. 
Paczesny explained rile purpose of the new facility is to 'provide an interesting and attractive eating place with a more substantial menu than sandwiches." He noted that there would not be a "21" bar because this restaurant will be open to all students. 
According to Reid. future plans for the area around LaFortune include the development of the courtyard bordered by Nieuwland, Hayes-Healy and Hoynes Hall into a park-like area for students to relax in. 
Paczesny voiced optimism about the completion of the new restaur­ant, including that he was not in the process of looking for benefac­tors interested in expanding the Huddle. "I have a positive feeling we will be able to get done on the schedule that we anticipate," he stated. 

Jackson leads primary field 
There were a lot of self-proclaim-· 
ed winners in Tuesday's primaries, 
but Jimmy Carter, who has done a 
lot of similar proclaiming in the 
past, wasn't among them. 
President Ford on the Republi­can side and Henry Jackson, George Wallace, and Morris Udall on the Democratic all saw good things in the day's results in Massachusetts and Vermont. 
But Carter, who won in Vermont and New Hampshire and had done well in early caucuses, was running fourth in Massachusetts, and a spokesman said "we were out resourced" by Jackson, Wallace and Udall. who ran ahead of him. 
Asked about Carter's prediction that he would at least finish in the top three, the spokesman, Hamil­ton Jordan, said: 'We were wrong.' 
Elsewhere, there was wide­spread cheer, with a notable excep­. . Sen. Birch Bayh of Indiana, was running seventh in Mass­usetts. 
Jackson credits labor support 
Jackson, who led the crowded Democratic field in Massachusetts, credited his considerable labor support for the showing and predie­ted even bigger things to come in the April 6 New York primary. 
'To get the Democraic nomina­tion, one must carry the industrial states," said the senator from Washington, who came in seventh in Massachusetts four years ago. "We're going to win New York ... it could even be a landslide, that's the meaning of Massachusetts." 
Wallace, running second to Jack­son in Massachusetts, said he considered it a victory if he finished in the top three. He told a rally in Miami: "Whether they like it or not, I'm running second and they thought I would run last." 
Ford, unopposed on the Republi­can ballot in Vermont and winner over Ronald Reagan in Massachu­setts had his say through his press secretary, Ron Nessen said: 
"Today's victories in Massachu­setts and Vermont and last week's victory in New Hampshire indicate

Udall, running third in Massa­chusetts took heart farom his showing as leader of the liberal group. "We're absolutely delight­ed; we buried the left," said Paul Tully, his state coordinator. 
Udall's goal had been to gain a position that would enable him tyo claim the clear lead among liberal Democrats, for what he said would be a direct confrontation with Carter or Jackson later in the primary season. 
But Bayh indicated the end might be near. 
"tomorrow," Bayh said in a statement, "I am going to meet with several others who have been involved in the campaign and we're going to together determine what role I should play in electing a Democratic president who can put this country in the kind of shape it should have been in all alonsz."

Security apprehends Keenan Hall burglars 
by Frank Tennant Staff Reporter 

Director of Security, Arthur Pears said two teenagers were apprehended after attempting to rob a room in Keenan Hall on Thursday, February 26. The bur­glars were caught in their car at 8:26p.m. 
He described the non-student burglars as black males, ages 18 and 19. Security stopped the car and upon a "consent search found a butcher knife and a 22-calibre pistol with cartridges," Pears said. 
Security then took the two to the county jail and had warrants issu.d for their arrest. 
Pears said "its the same old story, they entered the room through the unlocked door.'' It was a combination room. he said, and one of the roommates who knew the others were out heard noises and surprised them. 
Pears praised the student's actions, "as the burglars ran out he grabbed a calculator from one, notified security and we were able to catch them." 
Through descriptions, the two possibly could have been the same two who were in Howard Hall the previous night. In that burglary a stereo was taken. 
Pears also revealed another in­cident which occurred on February 
18. At 4:54 a.m., security discov­ered a glass display case had been broken into in the Tom Dooley Room of LaFortune Student Center. Br. Francis Gorch, man­ager of LaFortune, said the robbery occurred between 12:30 a.m. and when security discovered it. He claimed "there was more than one person involved." Gorch noted a picture knocked off the wall and an overturned plant as an indication of their escape route. 
way. With 84 percent of the Vermont 
precincts  tallied,  this  was  the  
picture:  
Carter  11,801  or  44  percent;  

Shriver 7,930 or 30 percent; Harris 4,154 or 16 percent. Mrs. McCor­mack had to percent there. 
Ford men had been jittery about Massachusetts, even though they organized and advertised while Reagan didn't. There is a conser­vative bloc in the minority Republi­can party here. 
But Reagan didn't appear to be polling any votes outside that predictable base. 
With 31 percent of the precincts counted, it stood: Ford 21,479 or 62 percent; Reagan 11,929 or 34 percent. 
The other Republicans were voting no preference, which would send uncommitted delegates to the national convention. Ford and Reagan will divide 43 national convention delegates on the basis of their showings. 
In Vermont, with 84 percent of the vote in, the Republican vote broke this way: 
Ford 20.286 or 84 percent; Reagan 3, 735 or 16 percent. But neither party's delegates will be bound by the outcome there. 
Gorch said "they had to size up the job beforehand." The lock on the sliding glass door of the case was broken without cracking the glass. Gorch said it would take time to do that. 
Pears said the theives took many medals. including the Legion of Merit, which had heen awarded to Dr. Dooley. They also took three small boxes with crosses in them, three medium sized china cups with handles and an opiuru.oscale with weights. according to Pears. 
"To an individual they had no value but they did have great value to the university in the collection," said Gorch. "I don't know their intention in taking the things becll'Hse they would be hard to pawn," he added. 
Pears said they have no leads. There was no inventory of the items so Security had pictures taken of similar items and sent these to state, county and city authorities. 
Gorch concluded, "we can only hope this publicity will induce someone to bring them back.'' 
With spring break coming soon. Pears said security on campus will be the same as over the longer breaks. All halls will be open. he cited the directive from Dean Roemer, and doors will be secured from lunch Saturday, March 13 thru Sunday, March 21. Rectors will inform Security what kind of lock they want and what doors they want locked. Pears added it is important that students make sure their rector knows if they are staying over break. 
''I don't think leaving one door open is advisable," Pears said, "because it makes the hall just as vulnerable." He said the best way is to give each student a key so they let themselve in and out as they would at home.

t=================lntemational Radical bombings 
SAPPORO, Japan --A powerful explosion in a state office building that killed two persons and injured 85 touched off fears yesterday of a new wave of radical bombings in Japan. 
Police said they believed the blast in the entrance hall of the 12-story building as people were going to work was caused by a time bomb. Three hours after the explosion, an organization calling itself "East Asia Anti-Japanese Armed Front" said it had set the bomb to show opposition to "Japanese imperialism."

NEW ORLEANS--Throngs of costumed maskers and colorful floats marked New Orleans' 119th annual Mardi Gras fling yesterday before the 40-day Lenten fast as thousands yelled the traditional "throw me something, mister" along carnival parade routes. 
Maskers cast a couple of million beads, baubles and carnival coins to the scrambling throngs from the rumbling floats of Rex, Comus, Zulu and 300-odd decorated trucks. 
Gas prices rose; will drop 
CIDCAGO --The price of gasoline in northern Indiana increased an average of 7.7 cents in the last year, but prices now appear to be headed back down, the Chicago Motor Club said yesterday.

WASHINGTON (AP) -The Sen­ate Foreign Relations Committee on Tuesday approved the nomina­tion of William W. Scranton to be ambassador to the United Nations after Scranton vowed to respond forcefully to criticism from Third World nations. 
Scranton said that while he will offer cooperation and understand­ing to all, U.S. action to cut off foreign aid to nations that consist­ently obstruct legitimate U.S. goals "may be useful in certain places and certain times." 
But he added that while this tactic might offer useful leverage, "I don't think this is a weapon we'd want to use in great proliferation . We can overdo it. It should be used sparingly." 
The former Pennsylvania gov­ernor, a 1964 aspirant for the Republican presidential nomina­tion, said he supports full efforts to insure the military security of the state of Israel, but he said that at the same time it must also be recognized that ''without friends and helpfulness on the other side. our role will be extremely diffi­cult." 
Scranton said that while he 
approves of the way in which his 
predecessor, Daniel Patrick Moyn­
ihan, spoke back to hostile critics,

Pat's." Moynihan drew both praise and criticism for his flamboyant performance at the United Nations and the softspoken Scranton said Moynihan had succeeded in raising the morale of the American people. 
Scranton decried the recent UN vote equating Zionism with racism as "that terrible resolution." He said the world body had indulged in an ''everybody-jump-on-Israel type of performance." 
Scranton said he believes that 

the tide of confrontation may be 
receding at the United Nations. He 
said he would take to heart advice from senators who said the time may have come for the United States to display a more measured and tolerant attitude toward criti­cism from poor nations with legiti­mate aspirations for political inde­pendence and economic develop­ment.

Senate members also questioned the representative nature of the Academic Council in comments arising from discussion of a Senate proposal rejected by the Council at its Feb. 23 meeting. Among the issues debated were the accounta­bility of Council members to their constituencies and the balance of representation between faculty and administrative interests. 
Faculty Evaluations Committee Chairman Robert Farrow said in his progress report to the Senate that evaluatoin results are "used prom­inently by CAP (Committees on Appointments and Promotions) and the administration. "We don't know if it measures what it purports to measure," he noted, and "no validity. study has been conducted to our knowledge." 
His committee was concerned, Farrow said, by the "very general" nature of the questionnaire items and the ten per cent student response to the open forms. "They tend to the two extremes", Farrow said of the latter. 
Studies at other universities have discovered over 20 variables which affect such evaluations, Farrow said. They include the time of day at which the class meets. whether it is required or an elective. the type of class (lab. seminar, lecture) and the age of the professor. 
Farrow said his committee will examine the qualifying varibles at Notre Dame and conduct factor and item analysis of internal consisten­cy. They will use this data to compile a guide on "how to interpret the numbers for the benefit of the administration and CAP," he continued. Farrow noted that there currently exist no resources at the University to help faculty members who may find themselves defficient in some area of teaching, and siad his committee will recomment several Teacher Training programs and resources. 
Finally, Farrow reported thathis committee was examining more closely the possibility of replacing the current evaluation forms with a more valid form. . 
In other business, Senate Chair­

man Paul Conway reported that a Senate Committee report on the appointments and promotions pro­cess was passed in part by the Academic Council at its last meet­ing. _The Council approved a Senate recommendation outlining appointments and promotions procedures and providing for an explanation to the departmental CAP concerned when its recom­mendations are not accepted, by the provost or the president of the university. A section which would have established ad hoc commit­tees to hear cases appealed by the departmental CAP was rejected by the Academic Council. 
Conway said that the negative vote reflected a number of disagreements with parts of the propo~al rather than a solid block of opposition. The Senate voted to return the proposal to committee for further consideration. 
In discussing the CAP proposal. members of the Senate commented on the structure of the Academic Council. Senate member James Cushing stated that "the Academ­ic Council has no sense of repre­senting anybody" and said that the "sanitized minutes" and lack of roll call vote give Council members "no sense of accountability to their constituency." 
NEW 
MODEL! 

Senate member Vincent DeSan­tis noted that the Academic Council "is not democratic" and that "the president is not bound" by Council decisions. DeSantis also said that the Council is "stacked" and observed that assistant deans are not members of the Council, while assistants to the provost are. 
Senate Vice-Chairman Robert Kerby, who is an ex-officio member of the Academic Council, said that he has become "a firm believer in most of the criticism of the Aca­demic Council," but still believes that it is "the only constitutional way of changing things and it will not change unless we can present concrete proposals which represent a consensus of the Senate." 
The Senate defeated motion bv DeSantis th:!l it "go on rcl'Ord t;) ask the President of the UniversitY to consider giving up the Presi­dent's Dinner this Mav and term­inate the event effective Ma,. 1976, and to contribute the apprn~· imate cost of the dinner to tlw Notre Dame Hunger Coalition." 
Senate members argued that th<.· dinner is the onlv social event for the entire faculty, including tho!->e who have retired, and that it affords an opportunity to rCl'Ognize those faculty members who arc retiring or being promoted.

Teacher Evaluation forms should serve the primary purpose of providing "pertinent feedback" to help teachers improve their teach­ing ability and effectiveness, ac­cording to a report of the Faculty Senate Committee on Faculty Eval­uations. 
Speaking at a meeting of the full Senate last night, Committee Chairman Robert Farrow stated that the evaluations "should be for the benefit of the teacher and not for others to evaluate him in terms of raises, promotions, etc."

SB 1: An Enemy 
iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiipat ric i a berge son 
For those who would like to fantasize that the days of Nixon's and Mitchell's regime of "law and order" is behind America, Senate Bill #1 (S-1) may come as a surprise. Officially named the "Criminal Justice Codification, Revision and Reform Act of 1975," it is ostensibly designed, with both liberal and conservative support, to modernize the Federal Criminal Code. Although its original purpose may have been just that, in the hands of Nixon's Justice Department the bill became a lengthy document of political repression. Today, S-1 is pending in the Senate ofthe United States. 
Unless it is soundly defeated, our constitutional and democratic rights will be seriously compromised. 
S-1 embodies a major assault on the First Amendment. It revives the provisions of the infamous Smith Act, which was passed 30 years ago and later became the basis for the McCarthy witch-hunts of the 1950's. The Smith Act prohibited anyone from advocating or teaching the desirability of overthrowing the government by force or violence. In 1957, the Supreme Court found the Smith Act to be essentially unconstitutional. However, S-1 reverts to the Smith Act, albeit in a disguised form. The term "advocacy" is not used but instead the words "incitement to ...conduct"' are substituted. A person is liable for a prison term of 15 years and a fine of $100,000 if, ·'with intent to bring about the forcible overthrow or destruction of the government of the United States or of any state as speedily as circumstances permit, he incites other persons to engage in conduct that then or at some future time would facilitate overthrow or destruction of such government; or organizes, leads, recruits members for, or participates as an active member in, an organization or group that has as a purpose such incitement.'' 
The use of such terms as "incites," "speedily as circumstances permits," "at some future time" and "facilitate" obviously gives the prosecutor unbridled discretion. Under such language, nearly anyone who voices a "radical" opinion of the government could neatly fit within the statutory prohibition. The activity proscribed is so far away from immediate action that advocacy is indeed being penalized. S-1 could then easily become the legal basis for a police state. 
S-1 also defines a "riot" as a "public disturbance involving an assemblage of 10 or more persons that, by violent and tumultuous conduct, creates a grave danger of injury or damage to persons or property.'' This definition requires proof that the danger was "grave" but the threatened "injury or damage" need not be significant. The civil rights and antiwar demonstrations of the past would then be tantamount to a riot, and participators could face a 3 or 7 year prison term. The right to assemble could well become a thing of the past under S-1. 
The national defense provisions of S-1 are equally as chilling. S-1 would make it a crime to delay or obstruct the "production, repair, or delivery" of any property suited for "national defense use" if the activity would be done ''in reckless disregard of the fact that this conduct might impair the ability of the U.S. to prepare for defense activities." Such activities as picket lines to protest napalm manufacture or protests against arms shipments to foreign governments might fall within the prohibition.· The penalty is 3 years in jail and can be increased to 7 years during a "national defense emergency," which the President is authorized to declare whenever he finds an "actual or threatened disturbance of the international relations of the U.S." Other provisions of S-1 redefine treason, sabotage, and sedition in similarly vague language. 
These are only examples of the ominous implications S-1 would have on our constitutional freedoms. What is so puzzling is the lack of publicity that the bill has received in the "responsible" press. Radical papers and underground weeklies have publicized the dangers of S-1 but the majority of the American public is unaware of this legislation. The American Civil Liberties Union and the National Lawyers Guild have taken up the fight against S-1 but they have encountered stiff resistance from the Ford Administration. Only powerful pressure from the people, in the form of letters, telegrams, and petitions, will stop S-1's passage. It would be indeed be tragic if, by their silence and passivity, the American people condone a return to repression.

The expression "overwhelming odds" becomes an understatement when one considers what the Saint Mary's basketball team has over­come to end up in the State Basketball Tourney this Friday at Terre Haute. 
If Coach Monica Doyle has any advice for the team's upcoming state tourney it's "to keep their heads together and we can take them." "Them" being the three other teams competing: Goshen, who has defeated them in the past; Franklin, whom they'll play in the first round; and Marion College from the Indianapolis area.  
The State Tourney operates as follows: the runner-up of the northern sector plays the winner of the southern and vice versa. They 
play by double elimination with only one team going to the nation­als. The other teams continue to play for second, third and fourth positions, which means as things stand now Saint Mary's is fourth in the state. 
The team has practiced in insuf­ficient gym facilities--picture Regi­na North as a gym--as a new team with their new coach Doyle. Keeping these facts in mind, the results arc truly astounding. 
To begin with, every player on the team has scored and, more importantly, has enabled the coach to change starting positions and players at will. Needless to say this can only be done when a team plays as a team. 
As far as individual scoring goes, 
four players on the team have 
scored 100 points or more. Leading 
the regular season scoring is Meg 
Holland, a freshman from McLean, 
Virginia with 143 points. Holland 
is followed by junior Cathy Maddox 
of Wilmette, Ill., with 126 points, 
and freshmen Kathleen Cullen 
from Victoria, Texas and Martha 
Kelley from Paletine, 111.--both 
with 100 points even. 
The regular season's overall 
statistics are also impressive. The 
team has wound up with a 10-3 
record in season play and has 
qualified for the Indiana State 
tourney. Grace College had won 
56-53 and Indiana Institute of 
Technology had won 60-48 during 
the season. Saint Mary's conquer­
ed these defeats by shellacking 
Grace 61-38 after a halftime score 
of 32-30, and by inching past 
Indiana Institute 45-43 in a tightly 
played game in which they were 
down 23-22 at halftime. 
As for SMC-ND statistics, Saint 
Mary's defeated Notre Dame by a 
wide margin in its first match 
59-50. and a not-so-wide margin in 
the second game 28-27. 
All of these statistics have spark-

As assistant dean of students Stevie Wernig pointed out, "They­'re doing so well without the gym, just think of what they could do with it." 
Credit cannot be given to the team alone. however, as they'd be the first to point out. Coach Doyle, whose ten-year competitive tennis record seems an unlikely require­ment for a basketball coach, has done an outstanding iob with 13 
coached basket~all althou~h she has "had expenence coachtng and being coached." Perhaps more bask~tball coac?es s~ould look into 
tenms. Doyle s attttude towards the future, however, is to "take each game one at a time" and sees one of the team's greatest attri­
butes in their "relaxed attitude... 

"They're out there to have fun--which is probably the whole 
philosophy behind it," explains Doyle. "Losses to Manchester and Goshen didn't up~.et them because 
they played well. Other coaches have noticed and complimented Doyle on the team's behavior. 
If they should take it all at the tourney, Saint Mary's would be heading for the nationals in Akron, Ohio. Supporters can still ride with the team to the State Tourney this Friday as of this moment for $10, which covers hotel costs. 
Saint Mary's begins its first match at 8 p.m. in Terre Haut~ against Franklin. Hopefully, the whole Saint Mary's-Notre Dame community will be behind them.

ND icers looking for home ice edge
by Paul Hess 
Tuesday afternoon in upstate Indiana was, in a word, miserable. Typically South Bend, to put it another way. With the temperature hovering about forty degrees and a dreary mist suspending itself above the Notre Dame campus, it was the kind of day that made one think at least twice before getting out of bed. Beneath the south dome of the ACC all was quiet, as Digger Phelps' roundball crew had been given a rare reprieve following a trying weekend. 
Over in the north end, however, it was business as usual as the Fighting Irish hockey squad prepared for yet another weekend. 
Coach Lefty Smith's talented young team is undoubtedly very tired of the word "crucial" by now. But such is the nature of the WCHA race this year. In a season-long scramble reminiscent of the American League in 1967, or the National in '64, no one team of group of teams has established itself as elite among the rest. With two games remaining for each team, for example, not one of the league's ten schools has been eliminated from the playoff picture. And the seemingly endless possible combinations of teams, foes, and sites are enough to befuddle even the most adept student of Math 104. 
Notre Dame's position is particularly confusing. With a two-game series at Wisconsin beginning Saturday, the Irish are currently tied for fourth place with Michigan, three points behind no. 3 Minnesota. Fourth place is the spot that Lefty's troops have coveted all season long, as the top four finishers in the WCHA standings get the

all-important home ice advantage for the playoffs opening round. Considering that Wisconsin is in last place, "playing mostly for pride" as Lefty puts it, and that God--namely, a Spartan sweep of their home and home no hockey player ever tried to avoid a fight more than Alex Michigan's final opponent, Michigan State, is in second, encounters with Michigan (admittedly possible, but "we did), and each must watch the opener of the series from Notre Dame's chances appear pretty good. can't count on it," says Lefty)--can give Notre Dame the the stands. "Losing Pirus and Nugent isn't going to help 
But due to the fact that the Wolverines totaled more home ice advantage in the event of a split. Two victories, us any," Lefty confides. "Still, our squad has fought goals than the Irish in their four meetings this year, a tie in or at least a win and a tie, are in order if the visitors from against adversity all year long," he adds. "I think we are the final standings with the Wolves would do the Irish no du Lac are to open the playoffs at home, and failure to do ready for the challenge." good. Of course, third place is not out of the question, so has traditionally been the WCHA's answer to hari-kari. Following Sunday's game, the Irish will return home to either--two Notre Dame wins coupled with a pair of North The task is a formidable one for a number of reasons. regroup, then begin practice Monday for the first round of Dakota triumphs over Minnesota "would be ideal," says First of all, the Irish are playing on the road, and a sweep the playoffs, which begins Wednesday. As to whom Lefty. In that case (assuming that Michigan doesn't on foreign ice has been somewhat of an anomaly in the they'll play and where, well ... your guess is as good as any. sweep), Lefty's squad would be at home against Colorado league this season. Moreover, they're playing at The opening series are two-game affairs whose winner is College, "the most advantageous situation," as Lefty sees Madison, the closest thing in college hockey to UCLA's determined by the most total goals. In essence, it's a it. "We're just hoping North Dakota plays some inspired Pauley Pavilion. Lastly, and perhaps most important of one hundred and twenty minute game, with the second hockey this weekend," the amiable Irish coach candidly all, they'll be playing the first game of the series Saturday "half" played on Thursday night. The secund round of declares. night without the services of their top two right wings, playoffs is slated for the following Saturday and Sunday, 
But North Dakota's not the only team that Lefty's Alex Pirus and Kevin Nugent. and the two teams left advance to Denver and the NCAA 
counting on to play ''some inspired hockey this weekend,'' Pirus and Nugent were unfortunately infused with the Championships. "That's six games in nine days for us," because "everything else is academic," as the saying spirit of the Bengal Bouts last Saturday against Duluth Lefty concludes, leaving little doubt that he wouldn't mind goes, unless the Irish win two at Wisconsin. Only an act of (though it must be said in defense of "Pie" that probably playing a couple more afterwards. 


The Irish Eye 

~ 
During the last week of March, Notre Dame will be competing for the national championship in Philadelphia. This isn't optimistic speculation about the basketball team, it is the truth about the fencing team.
I
' Yes, while Notre Dame sports fans spend hours puzzling over where the 
I 
basketball and hockey teams will go in their respective tournaments, and
I 
who they will have to play, few know that the fencing team is as good as r there. Presently, the Irish hold a 21-0 record. They have compiled a string of 39 consecutive victories, an all-time Notre Dame record. There is no
i 
~ official poll for college fencing teams, but unofficially, Notre Dame is number one. Coach Mike DeCicco has already notified the officials that
I 
ND will be represented at the tournament, scheduled for March 26th and
I 
27th at Pennsylvania University. Indeed, 1975-76 seems to be the peak of what has been a gradual rise in
t 
the Notre Dame fencing program. The Irish have improved yearly, 
! I I 
finishing third in the nation last season. Coach DeCicco feels that part of the reason is that young fencers now realize that Notre Dame does devote itself to fencers, that the sport does exist here. Thus the school is acquiring better athletes.
