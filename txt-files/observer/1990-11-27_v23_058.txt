Parking changes accommodate off-campus students 
By SIOBHAN MCCARTHY News Writer 
Noticnable improvnmnnts will be made in the availability of spneial events parking to ac­commodate morn off-campus students after Wndnesday, due to a recent security decision to limit the amount of faculty and visitor parking around the sta­dium. 
Phil .Johnson, assistant direc­tor of Sncurity, met with the Campus Lifn Council Monday to discuss recent expansions and changes in campus parking. 
According to a security press n~leas1~. "Beginning November 2K, 1990. all parking for bas­kntball games and other events at the .Ioyce Athletic and Con­vocation Center will be south of the .I.A.C.C. in the area com­monly known as Hed Field East. Lots west of Junipm Hoad are not open to basketball and event parking." 
Don Dedrick. director of Physical Plant. commented, "The basketball parking will be greatly enhancHd" by these new ehangHs. "I think it will be ter­rille for basketball games and concerts." 
Dedrick is curn~ntly a mem­ber of the Ad lloc Parking Committee. a temporary group which has bmm formed specifi­cally to address the campus parking problnms. The group is mainly eoncnrned "with exist­ing faeilitiHs," according to .Johnson. Although it does not IHIVP the authority to construct rww fadlitil~s. decisions regard­ing eonstruction are made by I>edrirk. 
A recent decision by the Ad lloc Parking Committee de­creased the number of "relatively unused" faculty and staff spaces in the area by Alumni-Senior Club and re­duced the size of the visitors' lot to roughly 100 spaces. Con­sequently, approximately 400 places in the C1 parking lot were made available for stu­dent use. "This committee deci­sion was based on the fact that spaces were not being utilized. It only made sense," said John­son. 
"We just try to give student input into allocating the limited amounts of parking space," said senior Ed Philbin, Ad Hoc student representative. "We just try to allocate it in the fairest way." He and junior Dave McManus both represent the student body in these meetings, and welcome all suggestions for change. 
Two basic problems have been identified with on-campus student parking: the safety of those who must park their cars in poorly lit and far-off areas, and the comfort of students forced to walk through bad weather conditions in order to park in the D2 lot. 
As far as available space, Johnson said, "Hight now we have adequate space to meet parking conditions. It's just not as convenient as students would like." 
Other security changes have evolved in order to accommo­date students and faculty. The Notre Dame/Saint Mary's shut-

ND students call for an official policy on racism 
By COLLEEN GANNON News Writer 
Th1! lack of a specitic racial harassment policy at Notre Dame has led an ad hoc student coalition against racism to write an open letter to the Administration regarding the adoption of an offidal policy on racism. 
We want people "to recognizo that racial discrimination and harassment exist on this cam· pus." said senior Alicia Sierra, nu-1mber of the ND/SMC Democratic Socialists of America steering committee. 
The open lettor, ondorsed by nilw student organizations, demandHd that a specific pro­eodure for the final approval of the racial statement be out­lined, that an approvfld policy bll ineorporated in the next ndition of du Lac and that the University respond to the ad hoe student coalition against racism by informing them of its intentions eoncerning this rnattllr. 
Sierra hand-delivered the letter to University President Father Edward Malloy, Vice­President of Student Affairs Patricia O'Hara, and Provost Timothy O'Meara on the morning of Nov. 14. The 
coalition did not receive any type of response as of Nov. 26. According to O'Meara, a re­sponse to the letter will come. 
"At the same time that the University is making a public effort to raise minority enroll­ment, they are not addressing the needs of minority students," Sierra said. The university is raising numbers without ad­dressing the practical issues, she said. 
"We want them to deal with all the aspeets that go with having a diverse campus," said senior Michele Cage, co-presi­dent of the Black Cultural Arts Council. 
Senior Corey Collins, presi­dent of the ND/SMC chapter of the NAACP spoke of alleged ra­cial harassment incidents at Notre Dame in the past. Ac­cording to him, some professors made comments that students perceived to be racially discriminatory. He has also heard stories that minority students are often stopped on campus and asked for identifi­cation by campus security without any provocation. 
"When we stop people on campus and ask for identifica­tion, It is because we are inves­tigating something," said Hex

Harvard sued by coalition for minorities 
CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) -A group of Harvard Law School students turned their legal training into a weapon against their own school with a lawsuit aimed at getting more minorities hired as professors. 
"Today we use the only in­strument of power Harvard Law School seems to under• stand," said second-year student John Bonifaz. "Today we take Harvard to court." 
The lawsuit filed Tuesday and signed by 11 students accused the Ivy League school of failing to hire any minority women, American Indians, Asian-Americans, disabled people, openly homosexual men and women, or Hispanics to the permanent faculty. 
It also claims Harvard dis­criminates against white women and blacks in its faculty hiring. 
"The complaint does not have merit, and in due course we will submit a formal response to the Superior Court," law Dean Robert Clark said in a state· ment. 


Origin of fire at Saint Mary's remains in cloud of ambiguity 
By ANNA MARIE TABOR Assistant Saint Mary's Editor 
A Thanksgiving tire at Saint Mary's has left the community confused over the cause of the blaze. 
Richard Chlebek, director of Saint Mary's security, believes the fire started on the second floor of Augusta Hall in a wicker wastebasket. His specu­lation is based on a fire de­partment investigators' theory. 
There were only two students in Augusta over break, but they were not in the hall when the tire broke out. The nuns staying in the south section evacuated the building when the smoke hazards became evident. 
"We doubt that the tire origi­nated in the wastebasket due to the fact that none of us smoke and no flammable materials were in the basket," said Gina Mascia, Kathy Mulrooney, and Laura Stanosheck, seniors in Augusta. 
Although the wicker basket was allegedly one-third burnlld, Chlebek puts faith in the fact that the firefighters have inves­tigated the causes of many fires. "They are professionals. Their expertise has to be taken into consideration." 
A fire alarm and sprinkler system alerted the Notre Dame and South Bend Fire Depart­ments at about 11 p.m. on Nov. 
22. Even though the fire was extinguished 45 minutes later, the firefighters stayed until 1 
a.m. to make sure it did not flare up again. 
The seniors "lost all of our furniture to fire damage and our clothes, shoes, books and stereo to water and smoke damage," they said. There has also beP.n some heat damage to the ceiling area and the exte­rior aluminum window frames. 
The fire damage was confined to the room in which the fire started, although there was water damage to other areas of the building. The women af­fected by the damage have been given rooms in Regina Hall but are presently at friends' apartments off campus. They have not yet been told when they can move back in the dorm, the seniors explained. 
Chlebek said that as far as he knows. everyone else has been moved back into the convent and hall. He believes that the situation has been handled "superbly," and is thankful that there were "no injuries or loss of life."

INSIDE COLUMN 


Collective punishment always fails 
When I was in the 
second grade (at an­
other great Catholic 
school, St. Patrick's), 
somebody in my class 
stole a little girl's 
candy bar. (And, NO, 
Mom, it wasn't me! 


Why do you ask?) Paul Pearson 
Ms. Almeda, our 

teacher, was very Asst. News Editor 
upset. She demanded 

that the guilty party return the candy bar 
immediately. No one even moved. 
Therefore, Ms. Almeda introduced the 
class to a form of justice which would 
change us forever-collective punishment. 
She refused to let anyone in the class 
(including the little girl whose candy bar 
was stolen) go outside for recess. 
Instead, she made us sit at our desks with 
our heads down until the guilty party re­
turned the stolen property. 
It didn't work. No one confessed to the 
crime, and all of us missed recess. 
The guilty boy later turned himself in (and apologized to the victim), but the damage was done. I resented Ms. Almeda for pun­ishing me for a crime she knew I wouldn't commit. It was unfair, cruel, and pointless. It turned a roomful of second-grade cherubs a little more cynical towards the abilities of teachers. 
The moral of the story: collective punish­ment doesn't work, whether the crime is the theft of a candy bar or the property damage caused by a snowball fight. 
Last year, for those of you who don't re­member, Father David Tyson, then vice president of Student Affairs, responded to the destruction of many South Quad win­dows (including the one in his own room) by denying every single dorm their University matching funds, regardless of whether any­one from that dorm was present at the 
fi~. . I was at last year's snowball fight (NO, Mom, I did not break any windows), and I 
never saw anyone from Siegfried Hall so much as lift a single snowflake. However, due to collective punishment, that hall was 
denied the funds to buy a piano (that's fair and just, huh?) 
Just as it failed in second grade, collective punishment failed at Notre Dame last year. Matching funds were eventually reinstated, and all that the punishment achieved was to give Father Tyson the nickname of "Father Snowball." 
He's now at the University of Portland, and if it snows in Portland, I'm sure the students will learn to disagree with his poli­cies as much as some of us did. 
Fortunately, no snow has fallen yet this year. Therefore, Professor O'Hara, it is not too late to change your stance on collective punishment. Please don't make the same mistake that Ms. Almeda and Father Snow­ball made. Trust me, you will regret it.

WORLD 
John Major, British treasury chief, has announced that he is to stand in Tuesday's Conservative Party leadership election after news of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's sudden decision to resign. In an effort to in­fluence who her successor will be, the outgoing prime minister let it be known that she would support Major 

in Tuesday's election. Major, 47, is the son of a circus performer and ended his formal education at age 16. He worked his way up from laborer and welfare recipient to banker, and was elected to Parliament in 1981. Thatcher appointed him foreign secretary last year, then chancellor of the exchequer. He will challenge former Defense Secre­tary Michael Heseltine and Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd, whose supporters argued that these candidates would be better able to lead Britain if war broke out in 
the Persian Gulf.

A defendant in the Central Park jogger trial testified Monday that police hit, coached an~ de­ceived him to make him confess to attackmg a female runner who was gang-raped and almost beaten to death. Kharey Wise, 18, also said detec­tives took him to a blood-covered spot in the northern end of Central Park and told him to dip his fingers into the woman's congealed blood a~d smear it on his clothing. Defense lawyer Cohn Moore said he called Wise as a witness to try to convince the jury that police and prosecutors used "Hitlerian tactics" to make his client incrim­inate himself. Wise testified that Detective Robert Nugent slapped him and called him .a liar afte~ the teen told of his whereabouts the mght of April 
19, 1989. Wise said he gave police an incriminat­ing statement only after Detective John Hartigan told him to lie to Nugent. 
President Najibullah of Afghanistan said Monday he has received proposals from the exiled king and Moslem rebels that could help end the 12-year-old civil war. Najibullah said the proposals from former King Zahir Shah and the mujahedeen guerrillas were made last week during his four-day trip to Geneva. He did not give details of the plans. "We talked with a number of opposi­tion leaders and exchanged views for a political settle­ment," the 43-year-old president told a news conference in the Afghan capital of Kabul. His remarks were broad­cast later by state Kabul Radio on a program directed toward the more than 5 million Afghan refugees living in neighboring Iran and Pakistan. "I can say that. I am pleased and satisfied with the results of that meetmg. It could be the real foundation for future meetings," he said. The Afghan president also said he stopped briefly in Mashad, Iran, en route to Geneva for talks with govern­ment officials. Najibullah and his government have re­peatedly claimed to have had contacts with the muja­hedeen, or Islamic holy warriors, over the past two years.

Panel discusses women in the job market 
By ANDREA CAVANAUGH 
News Writer 
Women have an advantage in the job market said Shirley Scott, English department chairwoman of Western Michi­gan University. 
In the panel discussion titled "Women and the Job Market," Scott was joined by Adrian Vanderwielen of the Upjohn Company and Ewa Ziarek, as­sistant professor of English at Notre Dame, in discussing the problems confronting women in the job market today. 
Vanderwielen conveyed the perspective of the male em­ployer in industry and science. He concentrated upon the im­portance of the resume for fe­male job seekers. In reviewing resumes, Vanderwielen said that employers are using new strategies such as targeted se­lection and job dimension judgements. These new proce­dures assist employers in find­ing better qualified applicants without making judgements based mainly on the applicants behavior in the interview. 
Vanderwielen stated that the resume is "the most important document you will produce in your career." In writing this document, his advice was to emphasize the fact that the ap­plicant is a woman or minority. Today, many employers are conscious of a need to hire more women and minorities. 
Also, it is important to list one's organizations, honors, overall GPA, and GPA in one's major. Related work experience and special emphasis on the personal research project are beneficial to the substance of the resume, he said. All the panelists emphasized the need to be specific and list only the facts. 
Ziarek presented the perspec­tive of the recently hired female in an academic position. She highlighted the importance "' publications in the job seeking process. "Publications are very important. The days when peo­ple hire Ph.Ds looking mainly at future promise are gone," she said. 
Employers want to hire stu­dents active in research. She viewed published work as a way for women to legitimize themselves in academic circles. Although they are not the only way to be selected for a job, she said, they are an important component of the resume. 
According to Ziarek, "Women graduate students need to be more aggressive" in publishing material because males receive "more positive comments" to pursue publishable material. Students can find themselves with a distinct advantage if their research style is exciting. 
Most articles are rejected by publishers because they are dull. It is very difficult for stu­dents to take the "imaginative leap from a seminar paper to a publishing authority on a par­ticular subject," says Ziarek. 
"It is a good time for women in the academic job market," said Scott from the perspective of a female employer. Consider­ing the interest of academic of­fices to balance their employ­ment, statistics show that women have a better chance than the average white male. However, Scott does not feel that this should deter women from establishing their "singularity as a candidate." 
"Interviewers are looking for a triple threat," said Scott in that a candidate's desirability is judged upon how good of a scholar, teacher, and colleague she could be. Scott mentioned two characteristics of intelli­gence and responsibility that are especially important in the selection process. 
Scott advised women "to be yourself but want to be your best self."

Racism 
continued from page 1 
Rakow, director of Notre Dame 
security. "I know we are not as 
a matter of policy or procedure 
stopping people just because of 
what they look like." 
"The majority of the time it is 
because we either had a theft 
or an incident in a dormitory or 
someone has been reported to 
be a suspicious person," Rakow 
said. However, he indicated that 
officers are getting better at the 
manner in which they approach 
people. 
Rakow further spoke of new 
federal legislation, which goes 
into effect in Sept. 1991, that 
requires campuses to report 
hate-bias crimes. "Incidents of 
racial harassment will have to 
be tracked by this new federal 
legislation," he said. 
"We always try to encourage 
people if they feel like they are 
being victimized because of 
their race that they report that 
to us," Rakow said. 
However, students have no 
formal channels to complain 
about racial harassment, 
Collins said. "They should be 
able to go to the student hand­
book" added Sierra, "and look 
who it is specifically they have 
to speak to and exactly what 
kind of procedure they will 
have to go [through] make a 
formal complaint." 
While Notre Dame became 
coed in the 1970s, minorities 
have been here a lot longer 
than that, Collins said. At pre­
sent, a specific sexual harass­
ment policy exists, but a similar 
racial policy does not. 
At the end of the 1989 fall semester, the Provost's Office organized an ad hoc committee consisting of students, faculty, and staff to write a racial ha­rassment policy at Notre Dame. 
According to Cage, "The statement submitted by the committee appears to have been "put on a back burner." 
"Apparently there is no for­mal procedure for approving or disapproving the statement that the committee endorsed," said Sierra. The coalition asks that the Administration review the committee's statement and inform them of the results. 
According to O'Meara, "The status is as follows: that we have discussed it with several people in the Administration and faculty members, particu­larly with the deans and the vice-presidents." 
He further stated that there are two values in question here. "The first one is that we are 
absolutely opposed to racial

ter damage.  transit officials praised the underground rail system,  

which has 730 miles of track 
and 468 stations. 
"But," Lebow said, "we also 
recognize that our obligation 
is to people who use the 
system to get to and from 
work." 
Close to 90 percent of the system's 3.5 million daily riders had asked the agency to do something about the beggars, he said. 
The result was imposition of the begging ban in October 1989. The objective: crack down on vagrancy in subways, where many of the city's esti­mated 80,000 homeless people go to stay warm, sleep and beg for small change. 
No fine is imposed. Beggars are merely removed or directed to a service agency for help. 
The ban outlaws begging near subway stairways, escalators and elevators or within 25 feet of token booths. It does not affect subway musicians, homeless selling the "Street News" newspaper published by the homeless, or those soliciting for charitable, Advocates for the homeless, 

however, said the ban only 
shifts the misery elsewhere. 
"Flushing them out of the 
subways is not going to make 
the problem go away," said 
Mary Brosnahan, head of the 
Coalition for the Homeless. 
Begging in subway trains has always been prohibited, but it persists. And many people believe widespread begging in the stations will eventually resume and be ignored. 
"People are going to do what they have to do in order to survive,"Brosnahan said. 
She called the ban "totally unenforceable." 
But transit police say the ban has been effective in removing what were virtual underground encampments of homeless people. No figures were available to substantiate this. 
As for the subway riding public, the ban and the court fight are irrelevant, said Gene Russianoff of the Straphangers Campaign, a subway riders advocacy group.

rassment," he said. 
Since a particular form in­cludes racial harassment through speech, O'Meara indi­cated the second value to be, "the value of freedom of ex­pression." 
"The whole ambiguity and vagueness of the situation gives me the impression that the Administration is not really carrying through on their commitment," Collins said. 
According to Sierra, the coalition published the open let­ter in the Observer on Nov. 19 to inform the entire community about the situation. 
"We realize this is not just a minority issue," but an issue that effects the well-being of the whole community, said Collins. 
If the-letter recipients do not respond by Dec. 1, "something will be done," said Collins. "We have a group of students really serious about this and we are going to see it through until the end," he said. 
Supreme Court's refusal Mon­
day to review a ban on 
subway begging, saying it 
helps restore order 
underground. But advocates 
of the homeless decried it as 
hurting the poor. 

"What this decision does is gives police the authority to arbitrarily harass homeless and poor people," said Doug Lasdon, a lawyer from the Legal Action Center for the Homeless. The group asked the Supreme Court to hear the case. "We're obviously disappointed." 
Without comment, the high court let stand the year-old ban on subway begging. Opponents had argued that it infringed on the First Amendment right to free speech. Because the court gave no opinion on the legal arguments, no legal precedent was set in letting the ban stand. 
"Nobody likes to push around poor people," said Jared Lebow, a spokesman for the Transit Authority which imposed the ban. The TA runs

Students rally 
Teargas fired by police surrounds students armed with firebombs during the anti-government demon­stration inside the campus of Sogan University in Seoul Friday afternoon. Some 500 radical students called on President Roh Tae-woo to resign during the rally. 
BEIJING (AP) -1\vo strate­gists of last year's pro-democ­racy movement have been charged with plotting to over­throw the government, a crime punishable by death, Chinese sources said Monday. 
The accused men are Chen Zeming, 37, who was publisher of the now-banned Economic Studies Weekly, and Wang Juntao, 32, who was its editor. They were also charged with counter­revolutionary incitement. 
The charges, which come more than a year after the two were arrested, are the most serious brought so far against any intellectuals involved in the June 1989 protests, which were crushed by the military. 
Their families received offi­cial notices late last week of the charges, said sources who spoke on condition of anonymity. No trial dates were set. 
In charging the two, the government moved closer to confronting the sensitive issue of what role high-level support and behind-the-

crushed, the official media ac­
cused Chen and Wang of being 
"black hands" who manipu­

to topple the government. 
Hong Kong news reports 
said the two men, both 
participants in earlier

Lebanese army tanks guard truckloads of artillery shells and am­munition evacuated by Christian militiamen from east Beirut under a government plan to reunite the war-divided Lebqnese capital in a demilitarized "Greater Beirut" on Sunday. 
In wake of violence, lsrrel fears losing their homeland 
MASSUA, Occupied West Bank (AP) -A series of bloody border incidents has given Israelis a feeling that their frontiers are closing in on them. 
In the latest attack, a gun­man crossed the Egyptian bor­der north of the Red Sea port of Eilat on Sunday and killed four Israelis on a desert road. It shocked Israelis, who have grown used to the 11-year-old formal peace on the Egyptian front. 
On the Jordan border, where an unofficial peace has reigned since 1971, guerrillas have killed two Israeli soldiers this month. The raids have raised concerns here that King Hussein of Jordan is losing control of the extremists in his midst. 
On Saturday night, an Israeli gunboat sank a dinghy which the army said was ferrying gunmen from Lebanon to Is­rael. Hours later, the army said, a woman with explosives strapped to her body blew herself up next to an Israeli army patrol in south Lebanon. wounding two soldiers. 
The Lebanon front has long been Israel's most troublesome border. But now that Syria controls Lebanon, Israel worries about losing its self-declared security strip in southern Lebanon. 
At Massua, an Israeli farming settlement in the occupied West Bank 15 miles north of Jericho, the tension is inescapable. 
Two miles from here, a Jor­danian teenager crept across the Jordan River one November night, shot dead the Israeli guarding a forward emplacement and would have killed more soldiers had one not clubbed him into submission. 
The Israelis' obvious state of unreadiness reflected how much Israel has come to take the peace on this border for granted. It has since moved in better-trained forces, but "we definitely expect more of the 
same," says Yossi Olmert, di­
rector of the Government 
Press Office. 
"This past summer things have gotten worse and worse. It makes us very uncomfort­able," a Massua woman said last week as she wrapped bunches of hothouse roses for export to Europe. She spoke on condition of anonymity. 
That morning the settlement kept its gates shut until 9 a.m. because a Jordanian soldier was thought to have infiltrated across the Jordan River during the night.

Japanese company purchases the MCA Corp. for $6.6 billion 
TOKYO (AP) -In the largest Japanese purchase of a U.S. company, Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. announced today that it is buying MCA Corp., owner of Universal Studios, in a deal worth $6.6 billion. 
Matsushita, a $37.8 billion giant known for such brand names as Panasonic, Quasar and Technics, is Japan's biggest manufacturer of con­sumer electronics equipment. 
By buying the maker of such box office hits as "Jaws" and "Back to the Future," Mat­sushita seemed to be trying to keep pace with archrival Sony Corp., which bought Columbia Pictures for $5 billion a year ago, analysts said. 
Universal is the fourth Hollywood studio to come under foreign control. The deal seems likely to heighten fears in the United States that too many major U.S. companies are falling under Japanese control. 
Asked how the purchase would affect U.S.-Japan rela­tions, Matsushita's president, Akio Tanii, said jokingly that he hoped "MCA will make a movie called 'Japan-Bashing."' 
Under the agreement, Mat­sushita is to start a cash tender offer of $66 a share for MCA's about 92.8 million shares of common stock by Nov. 30. 
MCA shareholders will also get stock in a television station that cannot be sold to Mat­sushita because federal rules prohibit foreign-based compa­nies from owning U.S. broad­cast stations. 
The deal calls for MCA shareholders to get one share in a new company that will own MCA's New York-area television station, WWOR, for every five shares of MCA stock they own just before the tender offer is completed. 
Company officials have esti­mated the new shares will be worth about $5 for every share of MCA stock. Adding that to the $66 per share in 
ca.sh brings the per-share 
value to $71, or nearly $6.6 
billion, for MCA's fully diluted 
shares. 
In trading on the New York 
Stock Exchange, MCA was the 
most actively traded issue, 
slipping 25 cents a share by 
late morning to $65.12 1/2. 
MCA Corp.'s chairman and chief executive officer, 7 7­year-old Lew Wasserman, stands to earn about about $355 million from the deal. Wasserman had personal holdings of 5 million MCA shares, or 7 percent, and controlled an additional 6 mil­lion through trusts and chari­ties. 
"Matsushita is a great inter­national company," Wasser­man said. "This combination assures the structural integrity of MCA and its worldwide operation. MCA will continue to operate under its own name and will be run by its existing management." 
The purchase, which followed two months of intense, sometimes frustrating negotiations, is seen as Matsushita's attempt to dominate the growing merger of technological hardware and entertainment industries. 
"Software and hardware have been developing simulta­neously -they are like wheels of the same car," Tanii said at company headquarters in Osaka. "We intend that excellent works made by MCA will be distributed all over the world through a variety of media." 

Analysts say Matsushita will now have a ready stock of high-profile movie and television programming to use for its high definition television, considered the next 
generation  in  home  
entertainment.  
Nonetheless,  several  

analysts said the much-touted "natural" linkup· between hardware manufacturers and movie, video and TV entertainment companies is still an unproven strategy. For 
one thing, digitalizing older movies and TV programs for high definition TV is very expensive. 
"It looks like they're doing it and trying to figure out strat­egy afterward," said Mike Jeremy, an analyst in Tokyo for Baring Securities. 
In Japan, Matsushita is jok­ingly called "Maneshita," or "copycat," for its custom of in­troducing products only after its competitors have tested the market for them. 
But some people envision a future of integrated home en­tertainment consoles that would include high definition TV, a personal computer, stereo and other gadgetry. And that future may accrue to the company with the most prominent image, analysts said.

Advocate for elderly Indians urges a return to old values 
AJ.BUQUEHQUE, N.M. (AP) -The old values, from a time wlwn neighbors eared about one anollwr and youngsters respected their elders, must be rnsurreeted or the future will hold little hopt~ for elderly Indians, an advocate says. 
Curtis Cook, executive direc­tor of the Albuquerque-based National Indian Council on Aging lne., said the growing ranks of Indian elderly make that philosophy even more erudal. 
"We're in the midst of an in­crease in elders and decreasing resources," Cook said in a recent luncheon speech to the National Congrnss of American Indians convention. "Something has to change." 
The 1990 census is expected to show an 83 percent increase in the population of Indian elders since the last count taken a decade ago, he said. 
"There's no way that the '90s can have any kind of new federalism or any kind of hope for the future of American Indian elders" unless the teachings and ways of the past 
are learned and practiced, Cook said. 
Cook, a non-Indian who has worked with American Indians for more than 25 years, urged changes in laws and policies and pressed for a c..ommitment among governments and youth to serve older people. 
Cook criticized the Indian Health Service and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development for what he called policies that hurt elderly Indians. 
He said HUD will not build homes for Indians over 62, and in some cases will allow only the nuclear family -not grandparents -to live in houses built with federal money. 
That effectively abolished housing for Indian elderly at a time when statistics show that 
23.6 percent live at substan­dard levels, he said. 
Cook said the II-IS has no specialized geriatric care or research.

Youth group fights drugs 
Starlett Clark sings in the most recent performance of the FAT Girls at Owensboro High School in Owensboro, Ky. The group, formed at Girls Incorporated of Owensboro-Davies County three years ago, convey anti-drug messages through song and dance. 
NEW YORK (AP) -John Klein weeds a row of beets and white radishes with a turn-of-the-century, wood­and-iron push hoe. Nearby, tall zucchini plants sprout limp yellow blossoms. His mother, Barbara, sells corn, cucumbers, tomatoes and fruit to passers-by from a stand on the street. 
This is New York City's last family farm, two green acres in the Fresh Meadows section of Queens, surrounded by small brick apartment houses, an elementary school, paved ball court, and a broad street noisy with buses and traffic from nearby expressways. 
"A couple of weeks ago, these guys from Florida got off the Clearview Expressway and came down the street asking directions, and they couldn't believe there was a farm in the middle of Queens. They thought they were in the Twilight Zone," said Klein, 25, a fourth-generation farmer. 
The two acres -slightly bigger than a square city block, with a chain-link fence on three sides and a lawn and tall oaks in front -are all that's left of a 1 00-acre spread that was sold off piece by piece over the years. 
The Kleins grow beets, car­rots, scallions, radishes, basil, dill, parsley, cucumbers, squash, and kohlrabies ­"stuff that doesn't need that much room to grow," Klein ex­plained. 
The rows are so short, he has to weed them by hand. "It's too small to use a tractor," he said. "By the time you got there, you'd have to turn it around." 
But the family also grows corn, melons and produce that needs more space on 100 acres in Riverhead, on Long Island's eastern tip. It's trucked in each day to the farm stand. 
Open July to November, seven days a week from 9 
a.m. to 6 p.m., the farm stand on 195th Street and 73rd Avenue does a brisk business. 
"In Queens, to find a farmer's market, this is really an oasis," said Sylvia Ehrlich as she examined tomatoes. 
"I come here all the time ­the stuff is delicious," agreed Michael Morache, who was buying zucchinis. 
Freshness is key. "I go out and pick it in the morning and by the end of the day, it's home in their refrigerator," said Klein. "We run out and pick the basil and dill and parsley right away for people because if you leave it out for a half-hour, it gets wilted." 

His great-grandfather, Adam, began farming in Fresh Meadows in the 1890s. !lis great-aunts, Margaret and Stella, live in two brick houses on the remaining two acres. 
Why keep the Queens land, when the family owns 100 acres in Riverhead? 
"It's definitely a tradition, but it's making a living also," said Klein. "If you go out to Riverhead, on every corner there's a farmstand. But we're the last ones here." 
Certainly Queens is better known as home to the Mets, Archie Bunker and 2 million of the city's 7.5 million residents than as an agricultural community. 
But Queens, like the four other boroughs, has a rich farming past dating to the 1600s. Only in the 1800s did industry and housing begin to replace open space around the city. Narrow, winding streets in Lower Manhattan recall cowpaths. Bleecker Street in Greenwich Village harks back to the Bleecker Farm of colonial times.

r r Patriarchal society makes God's male image understandable 
Dear Editor: 
I found myself agreeing with Dana Dillon's letter (The Observer, Oct. 31), but she overlooks a key point in the de­bate over inclusive language in reference to God -our lan­guage is always going to fall short of the grandeur of God. I do not call God "Father" be­cause I think of him as a man. I call him "Father" because it is then that I can relate to "Him" -not to "Parent" or "Godself' or any other bizarre epithet. 
Ms. Dillon urges us to "refuse to confine our God according to the limitations of our own lan­guage and understanding." Unless I try to bring God into the realm of my understanding and language, I cannot worship Him; I cannot think of Him; I cannot relate to Him. The masculine references I apply to God do not define him; they do not limit him; they are for me. They give me access to my Lord and my Savior. Delete these "limiting" words, and I am left with a God I cannot know. 
If we fail to acknowledge the wholeness of God and fail to see his mothering of us, blame it not on the traditional wording, but look instead to the closed minds and narrow vision of we his people. We, in our ig­norance, try to build him in our minds from the words up in­stead of finding him in our hearts and there surrendering to him, finding the words on our lips as only feeble attempts to bring ourselves to him. 
Secondly, it is entirely under­standable (with all arguments of whether it is right aside) that, given the Judea-Christian tradition and the patriarchal society from which it sprang, 
DOONESBURY 
God would develop a masculine image. The Jews spoke of the awesome might of the Lord and the early Christians of submis­sion to God's will. In a patriar­chal society, these are not roles generally associated with women.'(That does not make it evil and mean, degrading sex­ism, but simply the natural course of development; if it had been a matriarchal society, then we would most likely be using feminine references to God.) 
The point remains, however, that the masculine images did not come from God, but from us (men and women). God does not call himself masculine, but only "I am who am." We are now witnessing a reaction against our patriarchal society, but it is still with us (and thus I think the male images are justi­fied if used pr()perly). 
I think it a shame that our patriarchal society is being re­placed by a neuter one, for we seem to be making eunuchs of our society and ourselves. Someday our children will look up not to "Mom and Dad," but to "Parent and Parent." I dread the day, for it seem a sacrifice of the vividness of our humanity to the cold black and white of humanist "fairness." I hope we do not "dehumanize" our God as much. I will call him Father; I will call her Mother, Brother, Sister, Lord, Teacher, but not "It." Although our language will always fall short of the everything that is God, it is by far more horrible to say nothing than to try in our meager way to say something. 
Jesus Christ, himself, in­structed me to address God as Abba, Father, and there is no compromise in that address. Any limitation is in our own minds. Ms. Dillon's point is well ness, I urge you to look beyond taken. But I have found God the words. If you still cannot within my heart, and I rec­accept it, then do as you will. ognize the words for the vehi­But realize that I find your cles that they are. They do re­'inclusive language" address main very integral vehicles. If much more limiting than my you are uncomfortable address­"limited" one. My soul has ing God as Father because you found its voice, and it worries find the "limiting" address in­not over semantics. Find your compatible with His unlimited-own voice, but do not seek to force yours on me. As for the liturgy, that will be decided by the congregation according to its own "voice," and we still have tradition and the instruction of Jesus.

Click. Whirr. "Hi. We're not here right now, but if you leave your..." 
In an alarming trend, more and more Americans are hang­ing up before hearing " ... name and number." Fortunately, more and more Notre Dame and Saint Mary's students are taking action to alleviate this problem by recording answer­ing machines messages that shock, cajole, or soothe hesitant callers into leaving messages. 
"We're not home right now" just doesn't cut it anymore. 
In the realm of social phobias, fear of answering machines reigns supreme, threatened only by the recent resurgence of fear of office supply stores and fear of crossing guards. At least one conscientious student, quite possibly a psychology major, is taking this neurosis seriously. 
In the background, the caller hears calm. welcoming music (the kind yuppie parents play for a fetus in the womb). A low voice leads you in meditatio.n, purring, "Close your eyes ... just brPathe ... good air in -bad air out... that's right..." If the caller is still awake by the end of the spiritual journey, he or she should be sufficiently relaxed to spnak into the machine. 
Another approach is to make your caller feel right at home. One Farley resident has a recording that features -who else? -that beacon of security, Mom. "Hi. This is--'s mother. She can't talk on the phone or go to any parties because she:s grounded." Be forewarned, though: in utilizing a maternal figure, there is always the danger of having an averse effect. .. the caller may run away instead of leaving a message. 
Some of the more sports­minded students on campus have tried appealing to the Fighting Irish spirit of the hesi­tant caller. One machine owner boasts that "pnople have called

"There is always a chance that a caller with your affinity for, say, Barry Manilow, and respond more warmly to your message ­perhaps chiming in with a chorus or two of 'I Write the Songs."' 
in from all over the country" to hear his recorded tribute to the NO-Miami game. It concludes, inspirationally, "October 20, 1990. Let's relive the moment." 
Another tactic to try is the distasteful message. A favorite spokesperson is the Blue Jogger, and can be heard all over campus. For example, "Hi. This is the Blue Jogger. -­and --can't come to the phone right now -they're busy hitting me." Groans of pain in­terspersed in the message are a convincing touch. The tacky topic of the moment, of course, is the ''I've fallen and I can't get up" commercial, which can be adapted to any answering ma­chine. 
Then there is the low-pressure, no-hassle, no-promises message. A Flanner phone number offers the realistic statement, "We'll try to get back to you before the next major holiday." 
It's important to remember, however, that the effectiveness of an answering machine message does not necessarily depend on word choice, or even a distinct theme. Think style. One off­campus phone number used an unconventional method, which consisted of grasping the phone cord and swinging the receiver overhead, in a circular motion, while requesting callers' to leave their number. "First they sound far away, then they sound close," testified one amazed listener. 


(Editor's note: this procedure is not recommended for owners of cellular phones.) 
Don't forget -your answering machine is a prime opportunity to express your musical taste. There is always the chance that a caller will identify with your affinity for. say, Barry Manilow, and respond more warmly to your message perhaps chiming in with a chorus or. two of "I Write the Songs." In fact, the PW residents who possess the Manilow message have even received calls from "the ghost of Andy Gibb." 
Conversely, expressing your musical distaste can make for an original message. Four roommates in Keenan claim to be unable to make it to the phone because they're "sleeping out for New Kid tickets." Apparently they're not worried about alienating any adolescent female phone callers. 
Another alternative is to ap­peal to the caller's sense of nostalgia. An inhabitant of Lyons has a message that be­gins with a disco medley and then says, "The 70's will be back... and so will --. Disco will find you wherever you are. Leave your name, phone num­ber, and astrological sign." Original. yes. but the machine owner admits that "people usu­ally hang up when they hear the first strains of 'Funkytown. "' 
Are none of these messages convincing you? Do you still find yourself unable to speak into a machine, becoming em­barrassingly dysfunctional in society, bursting into anguished tears at the sound of any loud beep? With the increasing number of digital watches in the world, now is the time to take the first step in the long healing process. If nothing else works, try FRED, the ultimate answering machine. This un­threatening, anonymous method just might be the an­swer for you -and you might solve the problem of the alcohol policy at the same time.

Thn jury is out on stand-up comedian Hobert Battle and he has been found guilty. Ilis charges: incurring laughter bnyond the call of duty. 
On Wednesday, November 28, at 9:00 
p.m.. his wave of crime will continue at ThtHidore's. lie will perform there with thrne other Notre Dame students, Will Clark, head writer for the Keenan Revue for the past two years, Chris Dellicarpini, and Tim Farish.Battle, a Notre Dame graduate, has aetually been spending more of his time finding guilt than anything else. 
He carried on a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde existence for many years as a stolid, straight-faced, prosecutor by day and a boyish, giggling, comedian by night. Finally in May, he quit his job as a prosecutor and assumed comedy as a full-time occupation. 
Comedy came to Battle naturally. In high school, he was voted wittiest student. At NO, he was the head writer of the Keenan Revue. When he went on to law school at William and Mary, he performed at a student comedy show, "Libel Night." 
He has worked clubs in Washington D.C., Maryland, Virginia, and Pennsylvania, to name a few. He also performs at colleges, corporate meetings and comedian competitions. 
As far as material goes, he draws many of his jokes from his former profession. Aside from that, he includes political jokes and any interesting or quirky stories he might have picked up. He is noted for his quick wit and ability to make everyday happenings seem hu­morous. 
Tickets are three dollars and there will be food and beverages available. SUB is sponsoring this event.

Marinovich and Co. 
Notre Dame held Royster to four yards on two carries, however, and defensive tackle Bob Dahl forced Marinovich into an incomplete pass on third down. USC settled for a 22-yard Quin Rodriguez field goal, its only points of the half. 
"I thought it would be a high­scoring game, especially when we first came out and moved the ball down the field," USC wide receiver Gary Wellman said. "But then we got down in­side the 20 and couldn't punch it in." 

"They were moving the ball," said Notre Dame cornerback a Todd Lyght, "but they weren't putting points on the board,

When Notre Dame failed to score in four attempts from the Trojan two early in the fourth quarter, many feared the lost opportunity would come back to haunt the Irish. 
The defense turned back four USC drives in the final 11 min­utes, though, to preserve Notre Dame's four-point victory. With just over a minute remaining in the game, Marinovich com­pleted two quick passes to the Irish 46, but a holding penalty

The Irish defense, after allowing 20 or more points for a school-record seven straight games, held USC to six .pomts and no TO's. 
and two incompletions brought up a fourth-and-11 situation from the Trojan 44. 
Marinovich hit Wellman with a 10-yard pass to the Irish 46, but Lyght knocked Wellman out of bounds as the receiver tried to stretch for the first down. 
"A big key for us was to tackle them after they caught the ball," Lyght said. "I dropped back to the first down marker and kept (Wellman} in front of me." 
Marinovich thought other­wise, and his subsequent out­burst resulted in a 15-yard un­sportsmanlike conduct penalty. 
"I couldn't believe that last call," Marinovich said. "I expect to be homered in South Bend, but not in the Coliseum. It was just a bad spot. I knew it would come down to the last series." 
So did Notre Dame nose tackle Chris Zorich, who wanted desperately to exorcise the ghosts in his mind from last weekend's last-minute loss to Penn State. 
"I didn't want it to end up like it did last week," said Zorich, who made sure USC didn't come back by sacking Marinovich on the game's final play.

line too much at the end of the half," said McGraw, "but after halftime, we backed off a little bit, and did better about not fouling." 
Evansville got within six early in the second half, but Notre Dame quickly responded to build the lead back to 54-39, and the Aces were never within ten the rest of the way. 
Karen Robinson led the Irish, tying her career high with 26 points, as well as dishing off 10 assists and capturing six steals. Krissi Davis added 15 and Margaret Nowlin chipped in 12. Diane Starry had 18 points and Humphries 13 to pace Evansville. 
The Irish outrebounded Evansville 38-28, including 16 at the offensive end. 
"The coaches said we needed to crash the boards on offense," said Davis. "Rebounding will be key for us all year. We start with a small lineup, so we need to rebound well every single time, crashing hard." 
Evansville played almost exclusively a two-three zone the whole game, which Ace head coach Bill Barnett said was in part a response to the Irish team speed. 
"We were concerned with Notre Dame's quickness ad­vantage when considering all five matchups," said Barnett. 
Notre Dame's quickness was displayed in its forcing 26 turnovers and collecting 17 steals, leading to numerous fast-break points. 
"Give credit to Robinson and (Coquese) Washington for creating steals and turnovers," said Barnett. 
Kristin Knapp led the five Irish freshmen with eight points off the bench as all the newcomers made contributions. 
"I think the freshman have a lot of talent, and can come in and contribute," said Robinson. "They need to pick up what they have to do better, and get over their nervousness a little bit." 
The Irish next play Friday night in Los Angeles against UCLA. 
"I think UCLA is becoming a rivalry," said Robinson. "They'll be raring to go against us. We just need to play an intense game and rebound well."

Colorado remains in the top spot of this week's National Collegiate Sportswriters' Poll, while Notre Dame moved up one spot to sixth. 
The Buffaloes, idle this week, received 14 of 21 possible first­place votes and 401 total points. Georgia Tech stayed in second position. The Yellow Jackets garnered four first­place votes and 386 points. 
Texas jumped one spot to third after clinching the Southwest Conference title with a 23-13 win over Baylor. Miami, 33-7 winners over Syracuse, fell to fourth. BYU, 45-10 winners over Utah State, was fifth, followed by the Irish-10-6 victors over USC-Florida, Florida State, Washington, and Penn State. 
Nebraska tumbled from 10th to 16th after losing to Oklahoma 45-10 Friday, while Rose Bowl-bound Iowa fell three spots to 17th with its 31­24 loss to Minnesota.

Notre Dame head coach Lou Holtz finally let the word "Reisman" slip off his lips in front of both Raghib Ismail and the press after Saturday's 10-6 Irish victory over USC. 
"I don't know what will happen with the Reisman," Holtz told Ismail in the lock­erroom after the game, "but if you don't win it, they ought to stop giving it." 
Ismail strengthened his Reisman status by gaining 189 total yards against the Trojans in his last game of the regular season. Now all he can do is wait for the Downtown Athletic Club to announce the winner in New York City on Saturday. 
The junior flanker, as usual, seemed embarrassed by all the post-game atten­tion. Still, he appreciated Holtz's comments. 
"He doesn't usually say things like that," Ismail said. "I take that as a compli­ment." 
Ismail earned Holtz's com­pliments by catching two passes for 70 yards, rushing six times for 39 yards and returning seven kicks for 80 yards. He did all this despite a deep thigh bruise injury which bothered him throughout the contest. 
"I had doubts whether I'd play well enough to help the team out because I didn't get to practice all week," Ismail said. 
He piled up impressive numbers nonetheless, and now it is up to the voters to decide whether Ismail is the best player in college foot­ball. His main competition will come from Brigham Young quarterback Ty Detmer and Colorado tail­back Eric Bieniemy. 
"Those guys really have some large numbers," Ismail marvelled. "Compared to them I don't have the statistics." 
Freshman Willie Clark ap­pears to have found a home on defense. Clark started his second consecutive game at free safety Saturday after being converted from run­ning back the week before the Tennessee game. 
Clark, who also started against Penn State, had three tackles and broke up a pass against the Trojans. 
Notre Dame's first official practice in preparation for the Orange Bowl will be Saturday. Irish seniors-will be off this week while mem­bers of the coaching staff conduct recruiting trips and the rest of the team partici­pates in winter conditioning drills. 
Two USC players reached milestones against the Irish. Tailback Mazio Royster's 51 rushing yards put him over 1,000 on the· season as he became only the third Trojan rusher to top the 1,000 yard mark as a sophomore (Charles White and Anthony Davis were the others). 
Flanker Gary Wellman, with nine receptions for 101 yards, set a new USC single­season receiving yardage record.

The win pushed Arizona to 3­0 and into the finals against second-ranked Arkansas. Notre Dame fell to 2-1 and a matchup with sixth-ranked Duke in the consolation game. 
"We were anticipating that they would drop back and force us to shoot the outside shot," Olson said. "I think they did what they had to do. The bad news for them was that we hit the shots."

Duke built a 19-12 advantage in the first half, but the Irish tied the game at 19 and again at 31. The Blue Devils then scored 12 of the next 14 points to take a 43-33 halftime lead. 
Bill McCaffrey-a last name all too familiar to Notre Dame football fans-led Duke with 21 points. His brother, Ed, caught 11 passes for Stanford when it upset top-ranked Notre Dame on the football field in October. 
"It's part of my job to hit the open shots if they're there," McCaffrey said. "When we gained momentum, I didn't take it upon myself to get the ball, but it was a total team effort, and when they got me the ball I was able to hit my shots." 

The Blue Devils placed three other players in double fig­ures-Christian Laettner with 16, Grant Hill with 14 and Bobby Hurley with 10. Laettner also pulled down 13 rebounds. 
Notre Dame also had four players in double figures-LaPhonso Ellis with 19 points, Sweet and Kevin Ellery with 18 and Elmer Bennett with 
17. Tim Singleton dished out a game-high 10 assists. 
"I didn't do anything against Arizona," said Ellis, who had just five points in that game. "That's not LaPhonso Ellis. I came out tonight to get some­thing done."

ND beats Alabama-Huntsville 
It's four in a row for hockey team as Irish sweep two 
The two teams, perhaps feel­ing the affects of Friday's game, came out sluggish Saturday afternoon. Both Louder and Charger goalie Bob Thompson had an easy time of it in the first period, as neither team had any serious scoring chances. 
In the second period, referees called 12 penalties, giving both teams ample opportunities on the power play, but neither team could capitalize with the man advantage. In fact, the Irish's first goal came when they were shorthanded as Curry scored on a breakaway. 
Notre Dame nearly had its second goal when Tom Miniscalco fed Pat Arendt in the right circle, and Arendt beat Thompson over his right shoul­der. The referee ruled no goal, however, saying the whistle had blown before the goal when the net came off its moorings. This was not the first controversial call by referee Michael O'Donnell. 
"I think the referee made a couple of questionable calls both ways which set both teams off," said Schafer. "However, we showed more composure when we needed to, and it paid dividends for us." 
Indeed it did, as two minutes later, Scott Vickman took a re­bound and scored from the right wing. Thompson blocked the shot, but the puck fell be­hind him and trickled across the goal line. 
The Irish took a 3-0 lead only 15 seconds into the third period on the power play when Eric Gregiore fired the puck past Thompson for his fourth goal of the season. 
At 4:06, Alabama-lluntsville's Graham Fair fired a shot from between the circles that beat Louder to the left corner to put the Chargers on the board. 
Five minutes later, Charger Jim Goonan intercepted the puck and passed to Bryan Moller streaking across the goal area. Moller scored to cut the Irish lead to 3-2. 
When Sterling Black was whistled for a five-minute penalty at 15:05, Schafer could sense the momentum, and per­haps the victory, slipping away. 
"Our goal was simply to clear our own zone, take no chances, and we did a pretty good job," said Schafer. "They had a flurry, but we had players willing to block shots." 
Said Charger coach Doug Ross: "We played a strong third period, but just couldn't tie it up. We had lots of oppor­tunities, but we didn't convert with goals. We didn't achieve our goal of attaining a split, and I am disappointed in that." 
Notre Dame's power play continued to sputter. The Irish only converted 2-14 power play opportunities this weekend, and for the year, 8-63. 
"Unfortunately, this remains our one area for improvement," said Schafer. "We've only con­verted 12 percent of our power plays, and that figure should be doubled." 
However, Schafer generally was pleased with his team's play. 
"We've now won four in a row, and I'm happy about that," Schafer said. 
ATTENTION SENIORS 
Dear Senior: Greetings from your Senior Service Commissioner! I just wanted to update you on what the class service project is for this coming Christmas season. In case you don't remember, last year our class raised about 600 dollars in order to sponsor 6 families affiliated with the Salvation Army. Each family received gifts and groceries for the Christmas holidays. This year the Senior class is able to support 4 families. I am looking for people who are willing to give up some time to shop and wrap gifts for our adopted families. You will be working with just one family and will have the pleasure of meeting them when you deliver the goods. If you are interested in helping I'd appreciate a call from you the week after Thanksgiving break (#3608). The families will really appreciate your effort. I look forward to hearing from you.

In a game marred by 27 penalties and numerous missed opportunities, the Notre Dame hockey team defeated Alabama-Huntsville 3-2 to sweep the weekend series from the Chargers. 
The Irish took the first game 8-7 in overtime Friday evening when Chris Tschupp scored his first goal of the year with 2:08 into the extra period. 
"It was a hard-earned sweep," said Irish head coach Ric Schafer. "It was hard­fought. It took everything we had and then some." 
Notre Dame twice came back from deficits in the third period of game one. Down 6-4 after Don Rugg's second goal of the year for the Chargers, the Irish scored two goals within 39 sec­

The Irish applied tremendous pressure on Huntsville goalie Randy Resek. With eight sec­onds left, Irish left wing Mike Curry slipped the puck past Resek, and the two teams went to overtime knotted at seven. 
''I'm really proud of how we played [in the first game]," said Schafer. "It was a classic ex­ample of not quitting."

LOS ANGELES-According to legend, a shillelagh is a club made of only oak or blackthorn saplings from Ireland because they are the only woods tougher than an Irish skull. 
An emerald-studded sham­rock was added to the club, a trophy that annually passes between the winner of the Notre Dame-USC game, for the eighth straight year largely because nothing was tougher than the Irish defense on Saturday. 
The defense limited Southern California to two field goals and sacked Trojan quarterback Todd Marinovich six times in No. 7 Notre Dame's final regular season game, a 10-6 win over 18th­ranked USC in the Los Angeles Coliseum.

After allowing 20 or more points in seven straight games for the first time in Notre Dame history, the Irish defense responded with its strongest effort of the season against the Trojans. 
"Whatever it takes," said Irish outside linebacker Scott Kowalkowski. "We've been in so many big games this year, we know what it takes to win." 

Women down Aces in opener 
Robinson has 26 
By RENE FERRAN 
Sports Writer 
As Irish sports fans' thoughts turn from football to basketball, don't forget to check out the Notre Dame women's basketball team. 
Notre Dame, using an ag­gressive man-to-man defense for most of the game, led from start to finish in an 83­65 victory over Evansville Monday night in its season opener. 
The Irish set the tempo early by pressing Evansville. The lead got as high as 43-25 with 2:03 left in the first half when they exploited the absence of Ace point guard Amy Humphries. 
"I thought man-to-man de­fense was the way to go," said Irish head coach Muffet McGraw. "We wanted to ap­ply pressure when (Humphries) went out of the game." 
When Humphries returned, however, the Irish failed to adjust, and Evansville cut the lead to 43-32 at the half.

ND game plan can't stop Arizona, 91-61 
By GREG GUFFEY 
Sports Editor 
NEW YORK-Notre Dame stuck to its game plan against third-ranked Arizona in the semifinals of the Dodge NIT, but Wildcat forward Chris Mills didn't cooperate. 
Mills, a sophomore transfer from Kentucky, scored a career­high 25 points to lead the Wildcats to a 91-61 victory over the Irish in Madison Square Garden. 
The Irish keyed on Arizona's strong inside tandem of Brian Williams and Sean Rooks and that allowed Mills the outside shot. He responded by hitting nine of 15 field goals including five of nine three-pointers. 
"We felt like Mills was in a slump," said Notre Dame for­ward Kevin Ellery. "But he came out and hit the shots. We stayed in our game plan." 
Williams and Rooks combined for just 13 points, more than 19 under their average in the first two NIT games. But Mills, who hit just one of seven field goals in the second round against East Tennessee State, picked up the slack with his best game of 
On Saturday, Notre Dame prevented USC from establishing a balanced offensive attack by holding 1,000-yard rusher Mazio Royster (110.2 yards per game) to 51 yards on 19 car­ries and the Trojans to a net 29 yards rushing for the game. 
"Our defense was excellent," Head Coach Lou Holtz said. "We gave up no big plays and played against the run very well." 
The Irish defense looked anything but excellent on Southern Cal's opening drive. When the Trojans drove 69 yards in 10 plays to the Irish nine, the question on everybody's mind was whether or not Notre Dame's offense could keep pace with

"It seemed like they were sagging back," Mills said. "They wanted to stop our big men ~ho have been playing so well. 
"We were ready for them in­side," Irish center Keith Tower said. "Coming in, we were going to play off Mills because we thought he was a suspect outside shooter. Once they started hitting outside, we had to spread it out." 
Daimon Sweet led Notre Dame with 21 points, but the biggest story was Arizona's ability to shut down LaPhonso Ellis and Elmer Bennett. Ellis had five points and Bennett zero, with a combined 2-of-19 shooting. To compound his problems, Ellis picked up his second foul with less than seven minutes gone in the first half. 
"I just couldn't get it going tonight," Ellis said. "The shots weren't falling from the outside and then I got into foul trouble. I had to put a little more arc on the ball down low, but outside it didn't bother me."
