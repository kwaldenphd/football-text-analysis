ND can learn from MU's mistakes 
The April 13 Marquette Tribune reported a story 
with more far-reaching implications than might first he 
suspected. This unobtrusive story in the twice-weekly 
student newspaper could affect us here at Notre Dame 
as well as students at private colleges and universities 
all across the country. 
The administration ofMarquette banned the showing 
of "Porky's" and "Monty Python's Meaning of Life" in 
the University-owned-and-operated movie theatre. 
'"Porky's' was not approved because ofthe excessive 
amount of sex, and 'The Meaning of Life' was not ap­
proved because of its anti-Catholic humor," explained Judy Shields, Marquette's assistant dean ofstudents. 
To argue that these movies ought to he shown for their social worth and meaningful message would be futile. "Porky's" has been called a thoroughly stupid movie, and "The Meaning of Life" did poke fun at Cat­holics, including a scene whi<:h portrayed an un­employed Catholic father who threatened to sell his children for scientific ex-

what they want. Ifthe students want to see these movies 
they can always walk down Wisconsin Avenue to a 
privately owned theatre. 
While these points are all viable, they sidestep the 
issue. The administration may own the theatre, but they 
cannot ultimately control what the student chooses to 
view. If they are truly concerned with preserving the 
moral integrity of the student body, then they should 
not subject every film to approval or veto. The best way 
to deal with this issue would be to organize a commit­
tee of administration mem­

view and discuss the merits 
see movies such as this probably aren't concerned with thl.' social implications to begin with, hut rather 
with entertaining them­selves at a funny movie. 
The Marquette ad­ministration's rash action has set a dangerous prece­dent which could he followed by other private in­stitutions, such as Notre Dame. By forbidding their students from seeing these 
particular movies in their theatre they are saying they have the right to control of each film and judge by democratic, not di<:tatorial power. 
The relationship hetwl.'l.'n 

the situation in Milwaukee and Notre Dame is obvious. Presently, the Student Union films shown in tht· Engineer­ing Auditorium do not have to meet with the approval of the administration. But what would happen if the people on the third floor of the Ad­ministration Building hap­pened to pick up a copy of Marquette's newspaper and read the unohstrusive story? 
what films their students can 
view. 
The administration seems to think they are worthy judges of morality, and by banning these films they are preserving the moral conscience of their students. What they are actually doing is retarding the moral growth of Marquette students. In order to fully develop a sense of morality towards what films an individual chooses to see, he or she must be allowed to have a choice. 
But the administration at Marquette has decided the best way for an individual to develop this ability to make moral choices is to offer no alternatives. 
Some may feel that Marquette's administration was correct in stopping these movies from being shown. These films aren't likely to change the world with their significance, and it might be counterproductive to show them since they don't exacty promote the ideals of Marquette'sJesuit tradition. After all, the administra­tion owns the theatre and they have the right to show 
They might just think it is a pretty good idea. The recent alcohol policy illustrates how the administration can reconsider their own policies after reviewing those of other schools, such as Brigham Young and Indiana L'niversity. 
The censorship question is a tricky one. At what point must the people in charge step in and ban the showing of a movie they find offensive? Anti-Catholicism and sexual immaturity are enough to make the Marquette administration take action. So far, the Notre Dame stu­dent government has not been confronted with this situation. 
The liberal attitude ofour administration has saved us from the Marquette situation and continues to distin­guish us from other Catholic attitudes. But the ad­ministration must be careful to maintain this attitude if they hope to preserve the Notre Dame image, which may be our most valuable asset.

An Tostal fun to start off today with decathlon event 
By CAROLYN GILLESPIE 
News Staff 
Since its founding by the Hall Presidents' Council in I967, AnTos­tal has grown into one ofthe biggest events of the year. lt is a much­needed and much-anticipated excuse to act a little crazy for a while before the crush offinals. 
There is a multitude of activities planned for each day, all promising to be adventurous. The key to the success of An Tostal '84, according to Chairman DaveJakopin, is "active student participation." The events can be an excellant opportunity to boost student morale and promote campus unity. A lot of time, energy and hard work by the An Tostal com­mittee has given the events potential for great success ifeveryone gets in­volved. · 
Following is a briefpreview ofthe coming events. Today 
This is the frrst hig day, to kick off 
the festival with three new activities: 
Decathlon 
-to take place at Father Sorin's Statue; the winner will carry a torch Saturday morning to lead the Chariot Procession. 

Slam 
Dunk Contest -to take place at the Bookstore Courts. 

Airband 
Competition -to take place at Father Sorin's Statue, finalists will compete at the Irish Wake Saturday night in Stepan Cen­ter. Thursday 


Both campuses will be active tomorrow. A picnic will start things off at Saint Mary's, with such events as a canoe race, a tricycle race and the famous "jail" game. One main at­traction will he the Mr. Campus Contest, held in Angela Athletic Facility. The Beer Garden will begin at 9:30 at Senior Bar ( 3 Budweisers for S I!). Friday 
All stage activities will take place at Father Sorin's Statue with a band to provide music all afternoon. Various events held on the quads will include contests such as car stuffing, donut eating, and the hilarious Dating Game. On Green Field the infamous Keg Toss and Matress Races will be taking place. 
The new contest referred to as Miss Mud will also be held Friday. Miss Mud is parallel to Mr. Campus. She will lead the Chariot Procession on Saturday along with him and the decathalon winners to start the ever­famous mud fights. The contest itself will not be based upon looks but rather upon answering questions correctly. Saturday 
This day is full of events ranging from a road rally, a campus-wide pic­nic to the popular mud pits. Before the famous Charriot Races take place, there will he a Mud Pillow Fight, Mud Wheelbarrow Race and Mud Volleyball. Bookstore Basket­hall semifinals will also be going on. The highlight of the day will be the Irish Wake featuring the band Airian, to be held in Stepan Center. Sunday

rest to those who have actively par­
ticipated in the past five days. The 
main attraction will be the

Soviets employ boiDbs against Afghan rebels 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -The Reagan ad­ministration said yesterday that Soviet forces have opened a major offensive against rebels in Afghanis­tan and a Pentagon spokesman said "it appears their force levels of per· sonnel. aircraft and armor may he higher than ever before." 
Defense Department spokesman Michael Burch also said the Soviets "probably have begun to employ high-altitude bombing" for the first time in their four-year effort to suppress Afghan resistance which began with a Soviet invasion in late 1979. 
"It appears that some sort of spring offensive has begun," Burch said in response to questions. 
At the State Department, spokes­man Alan Romberg said the United States has confirmed from several sources that the new Soviet military offensive includes "high-altitude saturation bombing" up and down the 70-mile-long Panjsher Valley north of Kabul, the Afghan capital. The rebels have a stronghold in the valley. 
Romberg said the bombing began 
on Friday and continued Saturday. 
"There is also a large convoy of 
several hundred Soviet vehicles 
which has started to move north 
from the mouth of the valley," Rom­
bersaid. 
In addition, he said other Soviet 

Chicago man shoots wife, children to death 
Associated Press 
CHICAGO -A man shot his wife and two children to death yesterday, then ran down the stairs of a high­rise housing project firing on "everyone he encountered," police said. A bystander died and four "sweep operations" are taking place in western Afghanistan near Herat and near Jalalabad, the country's second and third largest cities after Kabul. 
Other such operations are taking place in northern Afghanistan, close to the Soviet border, Romberg said. 
He reported increased resistance activtty near Kabul, saying Mujahidin resistance fighters have carried out numerous raids and at· tacks on the main road from the Soviet l Inion to Kabul. 
The State Department spokesman 
noted that the Soviets previously 
have carried out six unsuccessful 
campaigns in the Panjsher Valley. 

He said the most recent of them was in the summer of 1982 before a truce was worked out between the Soviets and the Afghan resistance commander in the Panjsher, Ahmad Shah Masood. 
Other sources said up to 20,000 
Soviet troops may he involved in the 
new offensive, along with more than 
500 tanks and armored troop car­
riers, plus 60 to 80 heavily armed 
helicopter gunships. 

Burch did not specifically identify the types of bombers being used by the Soviets against targets in the val­ley, but he told reporters that "I wouldnt quarrel" with reports that the Soviets have sent Tll-16 Badger bombers against the Afghans from bases in the southern part of the 
Soviet Union. 

people were wounded before police 
shot  down  the  gunman  in  the  
parking Jot.  
Officers said a family  dispute  

sparked the shooting spree by . Charles Hunt, 37. A neighbor said Hunt was "very strange" and that she had reported to police in the past 
that he was abusing his family. 

Two people remained hospitalized Tuesday afternoon after the incident at Theodore K. Lawless Gardens, a normally quiet, middle class residence on the South Side. 
Cmdr. James Delaney said that at about 8 a.m., Hunt fatally shot his wife, Betty, 50, his son, Charles Jr., I 7, and his daughter, Linda, I 5, in the family's 23rd-floor apartment. 
He then dashed downstairs to the 18th floor and killed Gloria Carney, 49, with three shots to the head, police said. 
He then went to the building's lobby, where he shot "everyone he encountered, wounding 29-year-old Londa McDaniels, and a boy," Delaney said. 
"I saw him shoot the woman as she was pressing the elevator but· ton," said W.L Williams, who was repairing his car outside the build­ing. "He stepped outside the lobby and fired more shots into it." 
Delaney said Hunt walked outside and shot the building's manager, Robert Gholar, 31. 
"He ... shot Robert in the face and reloaded the gun," Williams said. "I yelled for Robert to run and that's when the police pulled up." 
Delaney said Hunt then raced through the building's parking lot, firing at police. Witnesses said Hunt appeared to be reloading the automotic pistol as he was felled by a hail ofpolice gunfire.

Bolstc:ring the analysts' predic­tions the economy was not growing too energetically, the Commerce Department said factory orders for "hig ticket" durable goods climbed

Restoring prestige to the Senior Fellow Award 
I think it goes without saying that the Senior Class Fellow award is in trouble; this year's tlasn1 has made that clear. I should like to make a modest proposal concerning this award; one that would reston· its original in-
Richard Conklin Guest column 
tention and, I hope, some of the educational usdtllness it was meant to have. 
lip front, two disclaimers. I spt·ak here as an individual and nor as a mt·mbcr of tht· llniver­sily Administration. Also, I do nor mean to dis­parage those mt·mbcrs of the Notre Daml· community who have recl'ived the award in rlTent years. 
Each of these individuals deserved some honor; but the Senior Clas.o; Fdlow award, at least as it was originally conl-civcd, was not thl· appropriate honor. 
The Senior Class Fdlow award was original­ly moddnl on the Chubb Fellowships at Yale l Jnivcrsity. Chubb Fellows arc drawn from the influence hierarchy of the nation, most often the area of puhli<: sl·rvice, and come to Yale not for a quick, in-and-out kcture, but for " more leisurely stay that includes informal give-and-take with the students. 
The University committed itself to finding funding for such a fellowship (which is cost­ly); Father Hesburgh offered his clout in extending invitations; and the Provost's Office promised to coordinate the selection process. In the early days ofthe award, the late William Burke, associate provost, helped a Senior Clao;s Committee to winnow nominations and to produce a short list ofcandidates. 
The most successful Senior Class Fellow wao; Eugene McCarthy in 1969. McCarthy talked to classes, led seminars, dined with stu­dt·nts and otherwise spent his two days on campus living the life of the University. I remember one lengthy night session -a col­loquy in the best tradition of medieval academic taverns -spent on the second floor ofthe old Alumni-Senior club. 
Timing was the one major problem in the award's early days. The Senior Class commit­tee did not begin work until the first semester of their Jao;t year, and often dill not begin is­suing invitations until spring. If the first per­son on the list wa'> unable to spend time on campus (a token appearance was not suffi­cient), an invitation went out 10 No. 2, and so 
on. The longest lead time -say, two months -was insufficient to commandeer the calen­dars ofthe people ofthe calibre the award sug­gested. 
As the selectors dropped from No. I to No. 2 to No. 3, often accompanied by publicity, the award suffered. Eventually, it was turned into an award honoring someone within the community, and even the idea of this person beingobliged to involve himselfor herselfin a special educational role was lost in the crowded days ofApril. 
It became, quite frankly, an internal and titular honor, exactly the opposite of what it was intended to be. 
What to do? 

First, return the locus ofcoordination ofthe Senior Fellow search to the Provost's Office, with a member of its stalf becoming non­voting chair ofthe selection committee, insur­ing continuity and underlining the educational nature of the award. 
Second, make the Junior Class officers ex­officio the Senior Class Fellow selection com­mittee, and give them a deadline ofthe end of their junior year to come up with a short list, after inviting nominations from the entire class. 
Third, have a bias toward persons with a 
Notre Dame connection, but do not make a 
previous association with the University a pre­
requisite. In other words, first think ofpeople 
such as John Noonan, Michael Novak, Father 
Bryan Hehir, Congressman Romano Mazzoli, 
and Governor Bruce Babbit, all of whom 
know the University and its culture. 
But do not exclude, for example, a member of the President's cabinet, whom we have reason to believe might come, simply because he or she is a stranger to campus. 
Fourth, make sure that the invitation goes out the summer before the senior year begins, with the candidate allowed to choose a con­venient date during the coming academic year. This should lacgely overcome the timing problem. 
Fifth, insist on more than a perfunctory campus appearance and provide an honorarium sufficient to interest persons who have no trouble filling their calendars. 
If we adopt these measures, I believe we can recover the original purpose and prestige ofthe Senior Fellow award.

In a recent trip to Mexico, I int£'Tlliewed "Mario", an Argentinian who may lexilimately be consi~Jered an exp£>rl in guer-
Santiago O'Donnell 
Free-lance 
ril/a ideology and methods. Mario's bm·k­gmund includes a master in philosophy from the PorztifiL·al Catholic Universi~y in Rio dejaneiro, Brazil, three years as a math andpbllosopbv student and class delegate at the llnirersi~y ofBuenos Aires and, more im­portant~v. four years of direct inc,olr,ement with the Montoneros Organization, one of the major urban guerrilla mcwements in !.atin America. 
Wbv didyou becomea "guerrillero"? What does it mean to be one? Why ditl you leave the gru>rillas? What do you see as the future ofrer,olulions in !.alin America? These uere the questions I posed as I turned on tbe tape record(>r. 
"When I entered the University of But·nos Airt·s in 1961 I had to work to make a Jiving, which madt· it difficult to study. The only pl·ople I found recc:ptivc: to this problem and 10 thl· probkm ofthl· university's strict admis­sion code were students with lc:ftist ideas. 
"I became a das.o; dclcgatt· and obtained some reforms in the admissions policy, which tnt to an offl·r to join Communist Youth. I at·­t-c:ptl·d their invitation, seduced by the Marx­ist intl·rpretation of history and influenced by the literature that drculated at the time. 
"A year later I bel·ame a member of the (communist) parry ant.! wa.~ assigned 10 a group working in thl· barrio with the poor. I rl·alizc:d that thl· potential for revolution was not in the communist party. 
"The: barrios were Peronist and they would not accl·pt communist material even if it was 
free. But the coinmuni!;t party was not the on­
ly Marxist group in Argentina, and I began to 
contact sectors in the Pcronist youth, even­
tually I became a member ofCooke's group. 

"Cooke was the Cuban contact in Argen­
tina, and the first group of Argentine 
'guerrilleros' received military training in 
Cuba via Cooke. But this group was more a 
family-type discussion group, and all it of­
fered, was a remote possibility to travel to 
Cuba So after a few months, I left this group 
and joined others in the peronist youth. they 
gave me what I was looking for, military in­
struction." 

What kind ofmilitary instruction didyou receive? "It was pretty primitive, basically oriented 
,towards explosives, and how to construct 
them with materials that could be purchased 
in drug stores, or here and there. Many of 
these groups rejected military paraphernalia 
likl· bazookas and the like. 

"The idea was to usc easily accessible hand 
guns and explosives or flammable materials, 
so that the common person could identify 
with the revolution and eventually become 
involved. The weapon ofpoor people is the 22 
pistol; you assault a bank with a 22, not with a 
grenade or a fancy machine gun." 

Mario did not raise his voice at any point oftbe interoiew, but be uasJar from being indifferent. Ser,eral times be interrupted his speech, started shaking his legs, took a bearry toke offofhis cigarette, and reached into his memoryfor uords, then return to his story. 
"One day I met an old friend from the Uni­versity, and we decided to form a closed ter­rorist group, separated from the other armed groups (for our personal security). We managed to do a few things, like gather I.D.S., and pull robberies to get money for buying wl·apons." 
E'llf!tllual~y you got arrested, didn'tyou? 

"Well, in one of these episodes two mem­lx·rs ofour group were arrested. They did nor ric the man well enough and he managed to yell at a polkeman that was pa'>sing by, Anoth­er mistake they made was to wait for the elevator instead of running down the stairs. When I arrived at home, the police were waiting for me. I was given three years, but 
after a year and a halfI was freed on probation. 
"During this period I made contact with the 
Montoneros, and when I left prison I joined 
them. I did this partly because it wao; the guer­
rilla organization with the most Nietzchean 
'will to power,' and partly because it was 
cleacly emerging a..-the dominant group with­
in the mobilized sectors, and I didn't want to 
miss the bus. That is how I became involved 
with the 'hardcore' guerillas, which is what 
you asked me at the beginning." 

Going to a morepsycbologicallellf!l, what made you join the guerrillas? What was the limit that bad to be transposed for you to pick up a gun? 
"There wasn't a specific event or thing, rather ideology weighed a lot .. When you have an idea of revolution in your head, and you combine it with the rebellion of the popular sectors, you believe that your idea is correct. But to what extent the popular sectors would follow the revolutionary process, and how to lead them were problems that I would dis­cover later. Injustice? I could make a long list of injustices: the electoral proscription of the Peronist party, the (military) dictatorships and many other things .... 
"The example of the Tupamacos (in Uruguay) led me to believe in the revolution­ary potential ofthe urban guerrilla" 
In 1979 Montonero member, Ana Maria Gonzales, placed a bomb under the bed of Chief Police Commissioner Cardozo using herfriendship with Cardozo's daughter. As a guerrilla, are there any limits to your use of violence? 
"I always avoided .. .I was able to avoid ­and in this sense I was lucky -I wao; able to avoid this type of situation ...Of course you can never be I00 percent sure, but I never killed anybody ...But sometimes you ace in a situation where you ace a friend of the daughter ofthe chiefofpolice, and the atmos­phere is heavy with all the killings that have been taking place, and someone from the leadership comes up to you and tells you that since you are her friend you should put a bomb under her father's bed. Maybe Ana Maria would have never kilkd anyone in her life, but she was the only one with the oppor­tunity to do it 
"Anyway, by that time I had left the Guerril­las and wao; working with the Peronist party. I thought that the killings hadn't taken us anywhere. We had nobody behind us, and they had thousands of policemen waiting in line." 
Why didyou Iealie the Montoneros? 
'It's hard to explain, but at the time there was no way of controlling the violence, be­cause the leadership of the Montonccos did not want to admit it had been defeated, and the pattern of violence that had been es­tablished was impossible to control. So my proposal to the leadership -a proposal that had significant support -was to admit our defeat, distribute the money among the needy, distribute the weapons and wait for the situation to change. Also I began to value human life more, which is something we had had contempt for. In relation to our families, to other people's life, etc." 
Why did the revolution fail in Argentina? 
· "In the I..atin American context, revolution is necessary in some cases -like in N icacagua or El Salvador -is to be expected. But in South America, I can justify violence only in some cases, but cannot accept the idea of revolution. I believe it obtains the opposite result from what it seeks, because the forces we manage to gather ace violently dispersed by the enemy. 
"I believe that the revolution is justified when the population assumes it and takes part in it. In South America the revolution is only an adventure ofthe petit-bourgeoisie." 
Under what circumstances would you pick up a gun again? 
'Only to defend my daughter." 
Soyou have discarded anyfuture personal inllolvement in armed insurrection as a political option. 
"In terms of Argentine politics today I do. I cannot focsee a situation that would put me in a position to do so. I could only be taken to that situation if I decided to live in Argentina at any cost. But today I have a different perspective. If things get bad in a place I take the first plane and leave."

Don't take music away 
Dear Editor: 
I am writing · fit regards to a recent memorandum sent to all dorms by Dean of Students, James A. Roemer. The memoran­dum stated that a number of complaints had been received by Roemer, from visitors and faculty, about the practice ofstudents playing their stereos with the speakers in the win­dows facing the outside. In summary, Roemer asked that this practice be discouraged and that RA's try to enforce the discouragement. 
I wonder who has been complaining so to Dean Roemer. Obviously some persons with absolutely no tolerance for popular music have been ruffling some of the administra­tion's feathers. Is it that these people have neurotic tendencies and can not cope with musical stimulus, or is it just that these people have an innate disliking for music? 
Roemer clearly stated that faculty and visitors have been making the complaints. The funny part of this is that most faculty and visitors do not even live here. The campus is primarily the home of the students. I have never yet come in contact with a student who thought that the playing ofsuch music was of ill practice. In fact, most students feel that the music is relaxing and adds some spice to an already nice day. 
Enforcing Dean Roemer's request would only cause more tension between the ad­ministration and the students. We may not be able to drink, walk on the grass, or be with our girlfriend after 2 a.m., but God help us ifyou take away our music.

Move off campus 
DearEditor 
This afternoon I had the opportunity to watch the student demonstration in front of the administration building. While I admired the unified student reaction to the new al­cohol policy, I think the demonstrators mere­ly displayed why such a policy was formulated . Shouting "Let's get drunk" demonstrates the unhealthy student attitude towards alcohol use. 
Furthermore protesting to an administra­tion which practices "in loco parentis" is al­most certainly bound to fail. The administration may listen to student opinion, but they certainly have no obligation to make concessions to the students. 
If students truly wish to exercise greater control over their lives, there is one very dear, viable option. The population of South Bend has declined approximately 20,000 in the past 20 years, leaving thousands ofcheap, unused housing units. Moving off campus would not only allow students to do as they . see fit,. but it would cause students to mature much more rapidly than they would living on campus. 
Signing housing leases, paying rent, and buying groceries might sound like a headache, but such things are part of the real world, a world those living on campus are insulated from. 
I would venture to say that the varying cir­cumstances under which off-campus students would be living would create more diversity in an otherwise rather homogeneous student body. A mass off-campus migration would also leave the administration with a lot of empty rooms, something which will influence policy in favor of those wishing to, or forced to, stay on campus.

Student Union fiasco 
DearEditor: 
During spring break we traveled to Aspen, 
Colorado on a Student Union sponsored and 
organized ski trip. Although we had a great 
time skiing, we were extremely disappointed 
with the way the trip was organized. 
In fact, the trip was so poorly run by the Student Union representatives, Alyson Miller and Deborah Hickey, who did not have to pay for the trip, that we would not recommend a Student Union sponsored trip to anyone. 
Let us cite a few of the more blatant ex­
amples of the Student Union's and group 
leader's unexcusably poor organization and 
management of the trip. First, we were told 
that bus transportation was too expensive, al­though the buses to Florida were very reasonably priced. 
Instead, we traveled,in compact cars with­out ski racks that ended up costing ap­proximately $80 per person, even though five persons were squeezed into each car. When we arrived at Aspen we were not given the Summit Party Cards that were a part ofour ski package and were necessary for admittance to all ofthe group activities planned by the travel agency. 
Although the condominium accomoda­tions were excellent, they lacked the pool and jacuzzi we were promised and they were defmitely not within walking distance of the ski slopes. 
Although we could go on to cite numerous other problems, we think the ones mentioned are enough to give a good idea of the overall poor quality of the Student Union trip management. To prevent a reccurrence ofthis situation, we are submitting a complete list of the problems to the Student Union. 
Hopefully, with more careful planning and control and selection of more competent and courteous trip representatives, fiascos such as this year's trip can be alleviated before they occur.

Ruppe is sound choice 
DearEditor: 
Your April 13 editorial on the choice of Peace Corps Director Loret Ruppe as com­mencement speaker had the uncertain credibility that one might expect from an ldi Amin writing on human rights or James Watt writing on diplomacy. You may see that even by the use of these names the issue is polarized. 
Distorting Mrs. Ruppe's values by calling her pro-abortion is similar to labeling her a Bolshevik pig, or a Red sympathizer in 1950, it's a loaded term and not fair in your usage. As with parts ofthe Alcohol Policy, this approach insensitively closes the issue to proper discus­sion. 
You can see that Mrs. Woidat, in her letter to the editor on April 18, quickly focused in on this single volatile issue, with a judgement which her daughter may not in fact share. 
The controversy concerning tape recorded conversations with a Peace Corps deputy, seems to be little more than the backwash from the much larger whirlpool that Ed Meese found himself caught in because of his own indiscretions. 
Loret Ruppe has reinstilled the Peace Corps with an Esprit de corps and vision that has been absent from the organization since the departure ofSargent Shriver. Loret Ruppe has taken an organization that was at its nadir, and has restored it in the world community as a respected human service organization. 
Within weeks of her appointment, the in­
tegrity of the Peace Corps was jeopardized 
when her department was to report to a CIA 
alumnus. Loret Ruppe showed that she was 
both a competent administrator and a quick 
thinking "street fighter" when she successful· 
ly opposed that arrangement. 
Thus, in an important way, she helped to regain much of the credibility that the Peace Corps had lost because of previous dealings with Central Intelligence. The deputy whose conversations were recorded had allegedly both resisted Mrs. Ruppe direction and covertly her leadership. 
The job of Peace Corps director demands a tremendous amount of travel to coordinate a thin world-wide organization, hence it is criti­cal that Loret Ruppe have reliable deputies. 
The deputy in question had reportedly lied 
to her on various occasions and was subvert­
ing her leadership. Therefore recording these 
conversations within the organization was 
primarily a defensive manoeuvere albeit an in­
discreet one. 
The effectiveness restored to the Peace 
Corps, and the newfound integrity and vision 
that Loret Ruppe has given that organization 
should alone be enough to qualify her to be 
commencement speaker. At Notre Dame we 
have demonstrated an unyielding commit­
ment to social concerns both here and abroad. 
To honor someone who shares with us this Christian zeal and love is only natural. 
As a woman and parent, Loret Ruppe has, with her husband Phil, raised six beautiful children, while managing two homes in both Maryland and Michigan while Phil served as Congressman from Michigan. 
As an unpaid administrator, volunteer or board member she has managed countless projects and events to serve her community. Your editorial challenged Mrs. Ruppe's credentials with an insensitivity hinting of sexism, as ifyou expected her resume to em­ulate that ofa primary wage earner. 
Had Loret been professionally employed, and her husband at home rearing six children, then her resume would more accurately reflect the dynamism and skill ofthe outstand­ing person that I personally know her to be. 
I would like to commend our administra­tion for an exceptional choice. Loret Ruppe is truly worthy to succeed others we have previously honored;John Kennedy, the Presi­dent who established the Peace Corps ( Laetare Medal '61 ); Kathyrn Graham, the publisher of the newspaper that exposed Watergate (commencement '74); and Robert Sargent Shriver, the first Director ofthe Peace Corps (Laetare Medal '68)

Paranoid policy 

DearEditor: 
As a high school senior last year, I looked forward to coming to Notre Dame this year. I had heard from many sources that I would receive a complete education at this univer­sity. I expected that while I was being chal­lenged academically I also would mature both socially and morally and upon my graduation I would have received this so-called complete education. 
Instead, I am now awakened to the reality that I attend a school with a paranoid ad­ministration who has lost all perspective of educating young adults in the 1980s. I receive much more trust and responsibility from my parents who realize that I cannot be protected in a glass bubble away from all the world's problems. · 
Instead of concentrating with the overall welfare of the students, this administration focuses its attention on liability and the "golden" image ofNotre Dame. The events of the past week are sterling examples of an at­titude that the administration has been displaying all year long. 
This attitude sees the administration as the 
all-knowing parent who controls the 
troublesome child otherwise known as the 
student body. This school has the unique 
combination of great students and rectors 
who can work together to implement a realis­
tic policy. Unfortunately, a realistic policy was 
not adopted. 
I sincerely believe that ifthe administration and student government could work togeth­er, a viable solution can be found. If the ad­ministration persists in ignoring realities, I see catastrophic consequences for the future of Notre Dame.

Traffic deaths 

DearEditor: 
Hey Father Beauchamp and Father Hes­. burgh get a clue! As one of the students on 
campus who does not drink, I can truly ap­
preciate your concern and feeling of need to 
take action on this matter, but let's do it in a 
responsible and realistic manner. 
Obviously, you feel that a Notre Dame de­
gree is the most important thing to anyone 
attending school here and that because ofthis 
beliefthe administration can take any action it 
deems warranted without prolonged student 
protest. I think that you are about to find out 
how wrong that beliefis. 
Students here will only put up with so much 
before they take extreme action. Think about 
the costs of such action: It won't be long 
before your policy hits the nationwide press 
and when it does you can bet the publicity 
will be neither fair nor unbiased. Once this 
happens you can bet alumni will get involved 
and what happens if they side with the stu­
dents? Unless I am mistaken a fair amount of 
money comes from those alumni, what hap­
pens ifit stops coming in? What about incom­
ing freshman and transfer students who will 
hear about the matter and take the attitude of 
realizing just how uncooperative and un· 
Iars will cure a diseased and now dead social life? 
You know it's amazing, we are supposedly 
the most brilliant students in America, with a 
supposedly equally brilliant administration 
and they come up with a plan that looks like it 
was drawn up by fourth graders. Fr. Beauc­
hamp says, "The whole party scene leads to 
alcohol abuse, so we've got to eliminate it." 
Well I tell you what Father, why don't you go 
ahead and do that and when you're finished 
why don't you and Father Hesburgh go to 
Congress and get a Jaw passed banning cars on 
American roads, after all they do lead to a 
whole lot oftraffic deaths.

Realistic concern 
DearEditor: 
Having just learned of the University's new 
policy with regard to studenr socializing on 
campus, I am somewhat disturbed. 
First, I would like to acknowledge your ap­
parent good intentions behind the recent 
decision to limit students' parties on campus 
to twice the number of people as those resi­
dents who host the gathering. 
Nevertheless, I feel that this policy is ex­
cessive and fails to recognize circumstances 
peculiar to the geographic location and stu­
dents, characteristics ofNotre Dame. 
As you know, Notre Dame's campus is its 
own enclave, for the most part severed by dis· 
tance and a paucity of social attractions from 
the city of South Bend. Despite my own 
gregarious nature and incessant search for 
socializing, I only ventured into South Bend 
on a few occasions during my years at Notre 
Dame. 
I honestly felt quite fortunate that my desire 
to meet and mingle with students in a non­
academic setting could be satiated by visiting 
parties held in various dorms on weekends. 
Many fond memories and lasting friendships 
derived from my attendance of many such 
soirees. 
Furthermore, I can not recall one instance 
of serious personal or property harm at­
tributable to such parties. Resident Assistants 
were always close at hand, though their 
services were rarely required. 
Notre Dame fortunately requires of its stu­
dents a tedious and demanding academic ef­
fort during the week. Weekend parties, even 
large ones -served more than just to allow 
students to indulge in some beer. It enabled 
them to deservedly relax and to create and to 
strengthen friendships with fellow men and 
women from the Notre Dame/Saint Mary's 
community. I feel sorry for those young adults 
whowill now be deprived ofthis opportunity. 
Finally, I want to express my realistic con­
cern that this decision will certainly lead to more accidents -perhaps fatal -by causing more students to transplant their socializing -off-campus. Obviously, some students will 
drink too much. 
I would rather have this take place on 
campus than off; where not only an irrespon­
sible or overzealous student suffers the conse-· 
quences ofoverdrinking, but where innocent 
people will be endangered. 
I appreciate your concern for the health 
and safety ofthe youngadults on campus, but I 
ardently disagree with this decision and hope 
it will be reconsidered.

Another damp day 
DearEditor: 
Tuesday morning I woke up, but I did not look out my window. Upon leaving the dorm, I was surprised at the sight of snow falling. It was going to be another damp, dreary day for Domers. 
Later that morning, as reached for The Ob­server at the dining hall, I noticed the faces of those people reading the article regarding the new alcohol policy. I wondered, on this damp, dreary day for Domers, "Is a wet campus really a happy campus?"

New Tarzan not an adventure filnt 
by Cat Francis 
features copy editor _ 
T
here I was, sitting in the theatre, eating my popcorn and waiting for Warner Brothers' new film, "Greystoke: The Legend ofTarzan, Lord of the Apes." 
"This is going to be Adventure," I thought. "This is going to be Tarzan swinging on vines, fighting elep­hants, beating his chest and all sorts ofgood stuff." 
It wasn't. 
"Greystoke" is, more than any­thing else, a psychological movie. It shows the mental struggles ofa human caught between the demands of the society in which he was raised and the society into which he is pulled. Christopher Lambert, playing Lord Clayton (Tarzan), shows the inner battle ofa man who exits the jungles ofAfrica and moves into a more perilous and complex jungle, human society. 
The movie is filmed beautifully. The viewer is treated to shots of waterfalls, towering trees, a mul­titude ofwild animals and later, to the beauties of the English 



Records 
countryside. However, I have some bones to pick with "Greystoke." It has been advertised as being absolutely true to the book by Edgar Rice Burroughs and the advertisers have been a little smug about this. But there were enough discrepancies to bother anyone who has read the book 
The major irritant lies in the fact that although the movie is subtitled "The Legend ofTarzan, Lord ofthe Apes," the name Tarzan is never mentioned in the movie. Lambert is referred to throughout the film as Lord Clayton. I have nothing against this except for the fact that ifsome­thing is mentioned in the title, it should be included in the movie. 
"Greystoke" is long -two and a halfhours. The beginning uses up excessive time amoung the apes, proceeding at a plodding pace which continues until Clayton arrives in England. 
The apes are wonderful. The makeup is painstaking and flawless. 
John Huston, the movie's director, 
hired Roger Fouts, an expert on 
primates, as a consultant for the film 
and Fouts' efforts add greatly to the 
realistic appearances. 
"Greystoke" contains the last screen appearance ofSir Ralph Ric­hardson, who died last year. Ric­hardson is delightful as the 6th Earl ofGreystoke, Clayton's grandfather. His performance is nicely comple­mented by the acting ofAnnie Mac­Dowell, who playsjane Porter, the Earl's American ward. 
Huston is best known for his work, "Chariots of Fire" and "Greystoke" contains several ofthe actors from that movie. Among these are Cheryl Campbell, who plays Clayton's mother, and Ian Holm, who plays Phillippe d'Arnot, the Belgian explorer who is saved by Clayton and later takes him back to England. 
The movie is filled with emotion, perhaps because ofthe series of people who die in Clayton's arms. This gets a trifle tiresome, but I couldn't help reflecting that under the same circumstances, like Clayton, I might have, ifyou'll excuse the expression ... gone ape. 

99 Luftballoons a one-song albunt 



Kevin Williams 
features staff writer 
I
fever an album had a single song as its selling point, Nena's 99 Lufthallons is that album. The title cut has been at the top ofthe charts in Europe and America for months. But as for the rest of the album ­not very impressive. 
99 Lufthallons suffers from one 
very serious deficiency -engineer­
ing. The few good qualities that the 
album might possess are hidden by 
the generally poor quality ofthe 
recording itself. 
Because ofthe extremely low 
record level on both the LP and cas­
sette versions ofthe album, the 
volume on a stereo must be turned 
up so high that noises like turntable 
rumble and tape hiss become annoy­ing. Better stereo systems will eliminate some of this noise, but even the most expensive stereo can't compensate for a poor mixing job. 
Ordinarily, well engineered al­bums combine the separate tracks -individual instruments, voices, etc. -into a finished product that highlights the good qualities of the individual elements. 99 Luftballons fails to do this. 
It is dominated by a bass drum that obscures almost all of the in­strumentation and most of the vo­cals. 99 Luftballons has some very good saxophone and keyboard sec­tions, but these are generally con­cealed by a pounding, driving beat. 


Given a decent production,99 Luftballons would not be a bad al­bum -maybe not awe inspiring, but once you get around the bass drum, definitely listenable. 
The album's format -one side of English songs and a second side of German songs -seemsonly natural for a German band trying to make it big in America 
The English side ofthe album shows offthe band more than the German side. There are some interesting saxophone lines in the songs"?" and "Let Me Be Your Pirate," which also happens to con­tain some minor guitar brilliance. 
"Let Me Be Your Pirate" is one of the better cuts on the album. It is a slow-paced song, reminiscent of some older Lou Reed tunes. The drumming highlights the sound in­stead ofsmothering it. Unfortunate­ly, this is about the only song where this is true. 
"Let Me Be Your Pirate" closes out the first side and "Kino" opens the second. It starts out with a good in­troduction without any drums ­good enough to get your hopes up. But before long, the bass drum en­ters. 
The album ends with the title cut, "99 Luftballons." The lead singer, presumably Nena, has a very good voice, and this song shows it off well. Again, engineering problems give one the impression that she's singing out ofa closet, but at least it sounds like the door is open. 
99 Luftballons is not a debut al­bum on a par with that ofa group like Asia, but there is probably a good reason. It seems reasonable to guess that Nena did not have a con­tract with a major studio prior to recording their album, and hence had to pay for their own studio time. It wouldn't be difficult, especially in Germany, to find an inexpensive recording studio where a small band could cut an album. 
99 Lufthallons is not a g.reat al­bum, but Ncna has potential.

Fighting over cats and dogs  
by Cat Francis features copy editor  
In the April 16 edition of"The Observer," Paul Cimino presented us with an article entitled "On the SuperiorityofDogs." In answer to the multitude ofoutraged readers who, Iam convinced, are crying out in the wilderness ofindignation, I am presenting the other side of the story. Why, Cimino asks, are Garfield and Heathcliffso popular? The answer should be apparent. Cats, because of their intelligence and independence, simply are more capable of humor than dogs. Dogs are too busy fawning over people to have time out for a good joke. At this point, someone may bring up the subject ofSnoopy. Snoopy is an exception in the annals ofdoggie-dom, exhibiting none ofthe characteristic servility and drooling enthusiasm so common to canines. This leads me to believe Snoopy is a farce perpetuated by two particularly active cats in a beagle costume. Before anyone accuses me ofbeinga dog-hater, I will observe that I own a dog. Her name is Suzie. She is a dalmatian. She sleeps on the foot ofmy bed. She does not sleep there out ofany sense ofloyalty, but because she likes my electric blanket. Susie has clearly demonstrated to me the true extent ofcanine in­telligence. How smart can an animal be who, after the 500th time she has heard the word "walk" mentioned in conversation, still runs frantically for her leash? How smart is a creature who, at least once per day, crawls under the sofa and gets trapped? How intelligent is a beast who thinks Frisbees are edible? Suzie is the original Destructomatic Dog. She has chewed count­less shoes, not to mention baskets, purses, rolls ofpaper towels, books and a wastebasket, into ribbons. The debris from this activity is piled by the dog under the dining room table, where she, under the illusion that she is a giant hamster, appears to be building a nest. Cats, aside from the occasional claw mar,k, leave no permanent damage. The legend ofman's best friend is a myth. Any dog who runs into a burning house is not thinking about saving his or her master but rather considering the perishability offood dishes. The same applies to burglars. A dog who barks at intruders is not trying to save the household possessions, but protecting the steak bone concealed un­der an armchair. Acat doesn't even bother pretending loyalty. They let you know exactly where you stand early in the game. Dogs are motivated by food, and they will go to any length to preserve their pipeline to it. If this means jumping all over a person when he comes home, or fetching slippers, or sitting up and doing ridiculous but cute tricks, they'll do it. I've never seen a cat rolling over and playing dead for a bowlful ofKibbles n' Bits.

Baltimore seeks stay 
Associated Press 
CHICAGO -An attorney for Bal· timore asked a U.S. appellate panel yesterday to stay a lower court order requiring the city to notify the Na­tional FootballLeague it will halt its lawsuit seeking to block the transfer of the Colts' franchise to In­dianapolis. 
"We filed the papers this morning (with the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals)," said attorney Edwin Thomas. 
The motion for the emergency stay was taken under advisement by the appellate court. Thomas said an­other motion was ftled to allow Bal· timore to continue with its condemnation suit, a legal strategy which would allow the city to wrest ownership of the team from Robert lrsay. 
No date for a ruling on either mo­tion was set immediately. lrsay moved the team from Baltimore to Indianapolis on March 
28.

sions, which gave the seeded Brick 
Throwers quite a fight before falling, 
21-15. 
The Modem Lovers were winners 
again, this time with a 21-12 victory 
over Hoop da Doop. Peter Graham 
took the honors as the best lover of 
the day with 1 0-for-20 shooting. 
The Near-Perfection Award for 
the day goes to Rick Louthan of 
Armed and Dangerous II. Louthan 
hit seven shots in a row, and then 
ruined his perfect game just before 
the end, and he finished the day at 
7-for-9. His team, however, did not 
fade as it saw the demise of Thy 
Kingdom Come, 21-17. 
The Bookstore Basketball Addict 
Award goes to Bob Brogan of the 
Corby Tooters. Brogan decided to 
play yesterday despite a a case of 
mono which he is battling, and he 
scored five points to help his team 
past Hoosiers, 21-14. 
Today, the 32-team field will be 
trimmed to 16 in the fifth round of 
Bookstore XIII. The games will be 
played at 4:45 p.m., 5:30 p.m., and 
6:30p.m. on all ofthe regularcourts. 
At 5:30 p.m., two games seem to 
be at the top ofthe games-to-see list, 
so it all depends on what quad you 
like to watch basketball. The 
Modern Lovers will demonsrate 
their style on Stepan 4 against Team 
136, while the Padres meet Return of Pigbag on Bookstore 9. Both games promise to be exciting. 
At 6:1 5 p.m., you can pick a good game at any of the three tournament sites. Stepan 1 is the place for the matchup between the Fun Bunch Five and Corby's Three Reverends of Jesse Jackson and Two Guys to At­tract the White Vote. Lyons 11 will be the location of the game that pits Over the Limit against Scratch Twice and the Three Itches. 
The most interesting game at 6: 15 p.m., though may be on Bookstore 
10. That is where Sorin rector Ed­ward "Monk" Malloy and his Sorin teammates on The Shootist will take on Tequila White Lightning IV, an­other team of Sorin residents. This Battle ofSorin pits two of the better teams in this year's tournament against each other.

Northwestern spoils day 

Tennis team loses last home match 
By ED KONRADY 
Sports Wrlter 
The Notre Dame men's tennis 
team expc:rknced both the thrill of 
victory and the agony ofdefeat over 
this Easter break. 
A loss to Purdue on Wednesday, a third-place finish in tht· Midwestern City Conference Championships, a blowout of DePaul Monday, and a tough loss to Northwestern yester­day kept the Irish busy. 
The Wildcats spoiled the last homestand of the year for Notre Dame, 6-3. In the singles matches, Pat Shields and Captain Tim Noonan were victorious for the Irish. 
Shields, who finished second in 
his flight in the MCC Champion­
sh!ps, extended his winning streak 
with a victory over Dan Christian, 6­
3,6-4. 
Noonan, who was playing his last match at Notn: Dame, pulled out a 6-4, 6-7, 6-0 victory over Marco Wem. After the match, Noonan ad­mitted, "It (leaving Notre Dame) really hasn't sunk in yet. I just wish I could have gone out with a win." 
The third point for the Irish was provided by the third doubles team ofJoe Nelligan and Doug Pratt, with a 6-3, 6-4 victory over Wem and Christian. 
The loss put Notre Dame's record 

At Indianapolis 
at 0-5 against Big Ten teams. However, the Irish will have a chance to try to turn the tide against the Michigan State Spartans, their next foe, this Saturday. 
"I was pleased with our play, despite the loss," said Head Coach Tom Fallon. "I thought we played very well. A couple of points would have turned it around." 
Monday, the Irish travelled to Chicago to pay a visit to the DePaul Blue Demons. Notre Dame swept the competition, 9-0, at the Mid­town Tennis Club. 
Pat Shields made his first ap­pearance at fifth singles and Doug Pratt played sixth singles as Paul Najarian missed the match due to a sore back. This was Shields' first ap­pearance at fifth since his back in­jury at the beginning of the spring season. 
The bright spot of the weekend was the strong play ofthe Irish in the MCC Championships. Notre Dame was expected to finish third behind Oral Roberts and Oklahoma City College, but the race was much closer than expected. 
"We played well," said Fallon. "We put three in the finals; unfor­tunately only one was able to win. Nelligan lost in three sets, and Shields lost to a good player. 
"We're playing very well now, and hopefully we can keep it up." 

The only Irish player to win his flight was Paul Najarian at fifth singles. 
"I was very happy, and I thought I played well, concentrated well. I won all of the big points -I was really up for it and I had a little bit of luck," Najarian said. 
"I had two wins against guys who were favored over me, and I put up a good show and won. The difference in the final between me and my op­ponent was the fact that I came back strong after losing the first set in a really close tiebreaker, even strong­er than in the first set. 
"I just raised my game up a notch," Najarian continued. "I didn't suffer the letdown he was expect­ing." 
With the strenuous schedule the Irish have been facing, it was a mistake that keyed Najarian's vic­tory. 
"I think I played so well because I accidently missed practice the day before," said Najarian, "and I got an extra day ofrest which I needed, and I came back well rested." 
Wednesday, the tennis team dropped an 8-1 decision to Purdue, extending the Big Ten jinx. The only point was provided by Paul Ghidotti at third singles with a 6-3, 3-6, 6-2 victory over Bill Sheley. 


Track team takes second place 
Once again, James Patterson was a standout in the jumping competi­tion. A nominee for the Athlete of the Meet award, the top-flight con­tender won the long jump ( 23-8 and three-quarter inches) and placed second in the triple jump. 
"He had a decent jump consider­ing the weather conditions," Piane said. 
In the steeple ch_ase, Irish senior Ed Juba splashed h1s way to a first­1 place finish with a 9:09.00 clocking. Dan Shannon turned in an im­pressive 47.5-second 400-meter time, good enough for second place. Assistant Coach Ed Kelly labeled his performance as "outstanding." 
Other Irish trackmen who turned in noteworthy outings include Phil Gilmore (second in the 100­meters), Mitch Van Eyken (second in the 200-meters), Jim Tyler (second in the 1,500-meters), Andy Dillon (second in the 5,000­meters), Tom Warth (second in the 10,000-meters), and the 4x100 relay team ofGilmore, Shannon, Van Eyken, and Patterson, which took second with a time of42.2 seconds. 
"The kids did a good job. No doubt about it. We went out there and just competed," Piane remarked. "But we can be a lot bet­ter. We are still far away from what we should be doing."

It was an ali-day downpour that members of the Notre Dame track team had to endure as they com­peted in their first scoring meet of the outdoor season at the Indiana In­tercollegiate Meet in Indianapolis last weekend. 
Said coach Joe Piaue of the weather: "It was horrible. It caused a lot of problems." Still, the Irish ran well. 
The Irish track team nearly knocked off the strongly favored 1984 Big Ten indoor champions of Indiana with a strong second place finish.

sion I team), 8-5, which also shows that they have a good defense. They're always a well-coached team, so we'll have our work cut out for 
us." 
The closest that the two teams have come to a common opponent is William & Mary. The Irish dropped a 16-6 game at William & Mary early in the season. Denison has not played William & Mary, but it did beat Washington & Lee, which 
"I was really pleased. I had to be," noted Piane. "The other teams, and even the press, picked us third or fourth at best. We lost by twelve points, which isn't all that much." 
Piane pointed to the shot put as the crucial event. The Irish, due to the fact that they did not enter anyone in the competition, could only watch as Indiana scored big points in the field event 
"We had them scared," Piane said. "Without the shot put we could have beaten them, and that's not what Indiana expected." 
Indiana topped the field of over twenty teams with 139 points. Be­hind the Hoosiers came the Irish ( 127), and Purdue( 103). 
playing and practice time since the Wooster win, though. Bad weather ha-; made practicing difficult, and a 23-4 rout of Wittenberg last Wed­nesday did not provide the Irish with much competition. The only good action came on Saturday in an exhibition game against the Michi­gan Lacrosse Club. Notre Dame lost, 12-11, but the competition wa<; very talented and included many college 
graduates. 
The tough competition at Michi­gan could be very helpful when Denison visits. The game, which begins at 3:30 p.m., is crucial for the Irish if they hope to make a run at Ohio Wesleyan's MLA title. 
crushed William & Mary by an identical 16-6 score. 
O'Leary can only hope that playing on the home field will help his team's performance likt· it did in the home opener against Wooster. In that game, Notre Dame jumpc:d out to a big 5-0 lead after the first quarter, and Wooster never got closer than two the rest of the way. O'Leary had directed his team to he very aggressive and push the hall down the field, a strategy which he again will use today. 
"We're just going to try to be real aggressive again and try to control the hall," O'Leary says. "We've been getting more offense from our middies recently and they've been doing a good job creating scoring situations. We're going to try to get them to control the tempo of the game." 
O'Leary is concerned that his tt·am has not had enough good

Trivial Pursuits of a different kind

Sports Writer 
Irish Items 

Hello again, everybody! 
Recently, this campus, as well as the nation ha~ been ovt·rcome by 
a disease which is quite contagious (and this ha~ nothing to do with 
alcohol). It can strike at any time, but usually occurs in small groups 
who have gathered together for a commmon cause, and the attacks 
usually occur during the evening hours. Once a recipient of the 
disease, the victims usually become paralyzed in a circle around an 
artifact ofthis plague. 
The disease is known as trivia/us pursuitus, and it hao; taken this 
column as its latest victim (although there are some who would say 
this column has been a trivial pursuit all year long). Be that as it may, 
my crack research staff has searched hither and yon to come up with

your prowess. Some of these you will find easy, but altogether, this 
little test will be good preparation for your worst final exam. llle
