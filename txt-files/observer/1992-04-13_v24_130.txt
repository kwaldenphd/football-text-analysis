Regina resident victim of rape 
By AMY GREENWOOD 
Saint Mary's News Editor 
A Saint Mary's student was raped by an acquaintance at 8 p.m. last Thursday in her Regina Hall dorm room, according to Saint Mary's Security. 
The incident was classified as forcible rape according to a security report. 
The victim was taken to Saint Mary's Health Services after reporting the incident. She was then transferred to Saint Joseph's Medical Center for treatment. 
She refused to file a police report. 
The Saint Mary' Office of Residence Life has contacted the victim to offer support services, according to Mary Kelleher, director of Residence Life. 
"We will provide options, such as counseling, prosecution, pastoral support, et cetera, for the victim so she can regain some control of the sit­uation," she said. 
Kelleher said that this is not the first on-campus rape at Saint Mary's, but it is the first time ever that a rape was reported immediately after it oc­curred. 
"It is foolish to think that we can protect

Pro-life, pro-choice activists stage demonstration 
By MEREDITH MCCULLOUGH 
Assistant News Editor 
The pr"o-life, pro-choice de­bate manifested itself Friday in a demonstration held at the Women's Pavilion, 2010 Iron­wood Circle. 
Picket signs in hand, mem­bers of Notre. Dame/Saint Mary's Pro-life chapter met in front of the clinic at 8 a.m. prepared to show "witness" and pray for women who turn to abortion, according to Bill Keen and Elsa Scheidler, co-presidents of the group. 
"No one is here to judge any­one, because we care for them (the women entering the clinic) and want to give them alterna­tives," said Keen. 
Publicity generated by the Right to Life Week attracted an unusually large number of par­ticipants, said Scheidler. Includ­ing a few South .Bend residents and about nine or 10 students from Trinity High School, Keen estimated that between 80 and 90 individuals took part in the demonstration throughout the day. 
Carrying signs of a different

nature, a band of pro-choice activists were on hand as well conducting a counter-protest. 
Notre Dame graduate student, Laura Schwingel said she organized this "contingency group" when she heard that the Right to Life protesters were planning to march. 
Schwingel and her group of nearly 40 students and South Bend residents came together in this "non-confrontational, nonviolent" way in order to show their support for women and their right to choose, ac­cording to Schwingel. 

"Abortion is a hard choice for any woman to make," she said. "We offered compassion rather than harassment." 
While the pro-life individuals marched in front of the clinic softly singing hymns and pray­ing, the pro-choice group marched on the Woman's Pavilion property and escorted women from their cars to the facility's door. 
There is no report that violent activities took place Friday afternoon, but members of the pro-life faction claimed that clinic employees showed hostil-
Buchanan to deliver policy address at ND 
Special to The Observer 
Hepublican Presidential Candidate Patrick Buchanan will visit Notre Dame April 21 to deliver a major policy address, law professor Charles Rice announced Friday. 
The address will take place in the Law School at noon. according to Rice. Buchanan will eat lunch and meet with students in the law school lounge after the talk. 
Buchanan, who is on the ballot for Indiana's May 5 Republican presidential primary, was invited by Lester Fortney, a second-year law student and chairman of Notre Dame students for Pat Buchanan. 
"The Buchanan appearance at Notre Dame is important not only because it will be a major address, but because it comes at the initiation of students who are taking an active interest in political issues," said Rice, Third Congressional District coordinator for the Pat Buchanan for President Campaign. 
Although the topic of the Buchanan address will be announced later, Fortney said he hopes that students will "take advantage of this unique op­portunity to meet with a candidate for President." 

ity toward the demonstrators. 
According to Keen, clinic staff members, including the clinic's doctor, periodically approached the pro-life activists "yelling offensive remarks and profanity." 
"We know we are having an effect when we see how upset and angry they are," said Keen. "They don't like to see us be­cause they know we speak the truth." 
Damm asserted, however, that there were no such outbursts. "I never witnessed a clinic di­rector being hostile," she said.

demonstration in front of 
the Administration------­Building. Let's stop to think about that for a minute. Wasn't it adults who came 'up with the idea of parietals in the first place. Kids make a lot of sense. I was supposed to be tutoring last week, but while the eight year olds crawled under the desks, and the junior high studs told dirty jokes, I ended up in a discussion with some pre-teenie hoppers about, what else, boys. After asking me if I had a boyfriend and pasting a huge "L" for "loser" on my forehead when I told her no, one smug looking 12-year­old came out with this gem: "Why don't you just call someone up and· ask him to go with you? He'll probably say 'yes.'" She even offered to do it for me. I remembered the rituals of grade school dating, imagined myself with six other 12­year-olds sitting in someone's bedroom huddled around the phone, and laughed at their naivete. But then it hit me that she had a point. If you want something, you have to ask for it. Especially at this university. Right now there are a lot of opportunities for students to make their desires known. Believe it or not, the administration is actually looking for student input with the Colloquy 2000. I don't know if it will do any good, and a lot of faculty members have said it won't, but it sure can't hurt to try. A while ago, Father Malloy asked students to write him a letter saying what they think about the University. Write him! "Dmlj Monk, Your-University is a nice place to look at, but it needs a few things. I'd like to see a student bill of rights, smaller classes, and co­ed dormitories. I'm tired of huge classes, I don't like parietals, and I want my teachers to like it here. Thanks, Becky" There's also some organizations to turn to. Tell your hall presidents what you want. Force these people to take their jobs seriously and do more than eat pizza. HPC has the potential to be an effective group. Call up your student senator and tell him or her your concerns. Student government represents the students, and they have to know what you want to do their jobs. Fill out those surveys SUB sends around. Join the group petitioning for co-ed housing, or the Adult Students for Adult Privileges group. Protest parietals. My little councilor had some other advice too. If I really wanted a boyfriend, she thought I should cut my bangs and curl them. I cringed at the thought. But she had another point. Sometimes you have to make sacrifices. If you want to see changes at this place, you're going to have to sacrifice something-your time. You didn't really want to go the -library anyway. You've seen that episode of "Cheers" five times already. Go do something!

ND student accused of attempted fraud, theft 
BY JULIE BARRETT Assistant News Editor 
Notre Dame student Marvin "Rusty" Setzer was charged last Thursday in Superior Court with attempted fraud and theft, according to Tom Richards of the Mishawaka Police Depart­ment. 
Setzer. a former Notre Dame football player, was arrested at 
L.S. Ayres in University Park mall April 8 after allegedly at­tempting to use a stolen credit eard, said Richards. 
Aceording to Richards, the credit card came from Notre Dame student Margaret Dougherty's book bag which was stolen from South Dining Hall while she was eating din­ner Wednesday. 
Setzer, 22, is accused of at­tempted fraud for allegedly trying to use an L.S. Ayres card in the name of Veronica Dougherty, Margaret's mother, to buy three pairs of shorts, reported the Tribune. 
According to the Tribune, a security officer at L.S. Ayres saw Setzer throw something away in a trash can, and when the guard inspected the trash he found Margaret Dougherty's driver's license, calling card, bank card and video store card. 
Along with her wallet, Dougherty said her book bag contained a cassette player and tapes, Richards said. The Tri­bune reported that police, after receiving Setzer's permission to search his car, found a tape player and cassettes that matched Dougherty's descrip­tion. 
This incidence is the second felony case filed against Setzer in two days. 
Earlier April 8,. he was charged with theft in connec­tion with a stolen biology text­book that was found at Pan­dora's Books in South Bend, according to the Tribune. 
The Tribune reported that Setzer is accused of exerting unauthorized control over a bi­ology textbook owned by grad­uate student John Burns by selling it to Pandora's Books. 
Setzer is free on a $500 bond and is to return to court April 16 for a trial date.

Board suggests changes for bar 
By DAVID KINNEY News Editor 
Members of the St. Joseph County Alcoholic Beverage Board recommended that workers at The Commons should help those needing to contact police, according to Sgt. Wanda Shock of the South Bend Police. 
Commons owners Gregorio and Pasquale Anastasio were called before the board in re­sponse to reports that employ­ees of the bar had not let crime victims enter the building to use the phone on at least two occa­sions, Shock said. 

The board recommended that "any crime victim will be al­lowed to stand in the doorway while police are called," said Shock. 
While the Anatasios would not comment on the case, Shock said that they believed that there was some misunder­standing about the two inci­dents and that employees had, in fact, tried to help the victims. 
One concern of the owners was allowing minors to enter the bar, Shock said. However, the bar would not be penalized under such circumstances, she added. 
Shock said that the bar has been very cooperative in the past, and does not expect prob­lems in the future. "There could have been a misunderstanding," she said. 
The recommendation is put on the bar's record, and the 
board will determine whether 
they have followed through this 
fall when the bar's liquor li­
cense is up for renewal, she 
said. 
Police brought the problem to the attention of the board after Mishawaka residents Mike and Mark Wamsley, bot~ 22, re­ported that a bartender refused · to allow them to use the tele­phone after they were threat­ened by a man with a handgun 
at about 1 a.m. on Feb. 11. 
In a separate incident, three men in the rear of the bar robbed South Bend resident Michael Drinane, 20, and Notre Dame student Julie Garden, 21, of jewelry and wallets on Oct. 27, 1991. The two reported that they were not allowed to use the telephone because the bartender told them it was too noisy.

Student arrested at demonstration 
By MEREDITH MCCULLOUGH Assistant News Editor 
Notre Dame junior, Bill Keen was arrested Friday 
while  participating  in  a  
demonstration  at  the  
Women's Pavilion.  

Keen was approached by the South Bend Police when a clinic employee recognized him as a frequent protestor at the facility and claimed that he was a potential trou­ble-maker, according to Keen. 
Examining his record, police found a warrant for his arrest, said Keen. 
On April 5. 1991, Keen had been among 115 protestors arrested while participating in a "rescue," or more active demonstration, on the clinic's property. 
As a result of this incident, Keen was fined $185, but be­cause he failed to pay, Keen said that the charge re­mained on his record. 
When he was questioned by the police last Friday, the un­paid fine was discovered and Keen was arrested. 
Though he was taken to jail, he was released later that afternoon after paying the $185 fine, he said. 
Upon his release, Keen said he returned to the "all legal" demonstration and continued

TWA reduces fares to stay competitive 
NEW YORK (AP) -Trans World Airlines, one of the na­tion's weakest carriers, said Sunday it would cut many ticket prices an additional 10 to 20 percent in response to a price program announced last week by American Airlines. 
TWA didn't say it was matching the new price struc­ture as had many other carri­ers, but said its new fares would keep its ticket prices up to 40 percent lower than its competitors on some coast-to­coast flights and for travelers who agree to fly through its St. Louis.hub.

Rafsanjani government predicts landslide victory 

TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -The 
government predicted Sunday 
that backers of President 
Hashnmi Hafsanjani would win 
a landslide victory in parlia­
mentary elections, bolstering 
his drive to liberalize the econ­
omy and mend ties with the 
West. 
The early results from Fri­
day's voting appeared to be a 
sharp setback for more-radical 
followers of the late Ayatollah 
Huhollah Khomeini. who havn 
dominated the 270-seat par­
liament, or Majlis. 
Iran's official news.media 
who won enough votes to cap­
ture a seat outright wnre mem­
bers of the Society of Combat­
ant Clergymen. whose leader is 
Hafsanjani. 
The other 68 decided races 
were in remote areas and the 
aff1liation of the winners was 
not immediately clear. 
But the fact that the govern­ment-run news agency was predicting victory early indi­cated confidence that the mea­sures Hafsanjani took before the vote to eliminate as many radical critics as possible proved successful. 
A week before the election, the Council of Guardians. a 12­man review panel of religious and civilian legal experts, elim­inated one-third of the 3,000 candidates. 
About 13.5 million votes had been counted in 189 districts as of Sunday, with final results from all 196 districts expected within two days, the Islamic Hepublic News Agency said. The electorate is estimated at 30 million, with anyone over 15 in the population of 60 million allowed to vote. 
With•lO percent of the poten­tial three million votes counted in the key Tehran area, all but one of the top 30 vote-winners were members of Rafsanjani's society. His most rabid oppo­nents in parliament, Mehdi Karrubi, the speaker, and Ali Akbar Mohtashemi, a former 
interior minister, were far 
down the list for deciding can­
didates for the runoff election. 
Rafsanjani's supporters, 
pushing pragmatic government 
measures, clashed repeatedly 
in the previous parliament with 
radicals intent on emphasizing 
religious fervor at home and 
Islamic revolution abroad. 
The radicals also wanted ex­
tensive state ownership of 
business, while the technocrats 
argued for a more open econ­
omy to deal with Iran's high 
inflation and unemployment 
and the lack of reconstruction 
since the 1980-88 war with 
Iraq. 
In Washington, President 
Bush's national security ad­
viser, Brent Scowcroft, said that 
"I think what you would call 
moderates seem to have done 
quite well" in Iran. 
But Scowcroft also said on NBC's "Meet the Press" that a big military buildup by Iran raised questions about Rafsan­jani's commitment to modera­tion. 
Rafsanjani has advocated change since Khomeini died three years ago, and the elec­tion was the first chance for Iranians to have a say. 
While Khomeini is still revered as a saint, enthusiasm for the mass rallies and con­stant political sloganeering born during the Islamic revolu­tion has dimmed. 
Rafsanjani also has gradually loosened the strict enforcement of Islamic laws since the end of the war with Iraq. The religious police who ensured that women did not show any hair and cou­ples did not touch are gone, folded into the regular police or sent to rural public works pro­jects.

Soviet prisoner shares words of peace 
By CARA ECKMAN 
News Writer 
Catholics can attain peace for humanity through lives of active prayer and through protest against the injustices of the twentieth century, said Josyp Terelya, a Ukrainian Catholic and former Soviet political prisoner. 
Terelya spoke on the need for Catholics to serve as an evan­gelical force in the world in a lecture Friday titled, "A Pris­oner of Conscience." 
As a result of his attempts to spread the Catholic faith in the Ukraine, Terelya spent twenty years in Soviet prisons. Although the son of high-rank­ing Communist Party officials, Terelya was raised in the out­lawed Catholic faith by his grandmother and participated in underground ·religious groups. 
After his conscription into the Soviet army, Terelya decided that rather than avoid the draft, he would attempt to evangelize his fellow soldiers. As a result, he was arrested and received 
~TUDENT­
GDVIIIMIIT 
his first of eight prison sentences. 
Terelya said that his faith in­tensified due to several mystical experiences, including an ap­parition of the Blessed Mother. 
He described the apparition, which occurred after a ex­tremely brutal beating. 
"I was put into a special freezer cell. After ten minutes time, I began to lose the physi­cal ability to move," he said. "It was so cold that the roots of my hair began to hurt." 
Terelya said that he had ac­cepted that he was about to die when he experienced an unex­pected physical sensation. "I felt an intense light. I was thinking that these were hallucinations that occur before you freeze to death," he said. "I heard a voice, and after the voice came, I felt a warm hand come over my eyes. 
"Almost in an instant, my body was warm, physically warm. I saw before me a young lady of about eighteen or twenty ... She radiated such a beauty that our language can not express. Just a goodness that radiated," he said. 
According to Terelya, imme­diately after his apparition, the prison alarms sounded, and several guards rushed into the freezing cell. "The guards came in and they asked, "What have you been burning in this cell?" Terelya said, "I told them our Blessed Mother came and she saved me." 
Since his release from prison; Terelya has proclaimed his ap­paritions around the world and visited the sites of other Marian apparitions. These apparitions emphasize the importance of prayer in achieving the end of injustice, said Terelya. 
He referr·ed to the Marian apparitions in Fatima, Portugal, saying, "Fatima is the beginning and ending of Communism. At Fatima, it was told that Russia would be converted. But it was also told that there will be conversion of Muslims and Jews." 
These revelations will not be fulfilled until Catholics around the world dedicate themselves to lives of prayer, said Terelya. 
"There is still a lot of work to be done for Russia to be con­verted. We still have a lot of work to do in praying for this to occur," he said. 

Terelya, who exiled to Canada,-warned against the tendency for democratic soci­eties to become insensitive to social injustices. "Believe me,» he said, "it was easier to keep my faith in the Soviet Union than it is for me here. There, we knew who we were afraid of. We knew who to hide from." 
He said that Catholics must take an active role in bringing an end to injustice. "The great­est sin of the apostolic Church is to be silent where sin is pre­sent," he said. 
Terelya added that he is con­fident in the Catholic Church's ability to fulfill its evangelical mission. "The Catholic faith is an optimistic faith. We should not have any doubts in our hearts," he said. "We are Catholics and we are building the future millennium of peace." 
Terelya's lecture was pre­sented in the auditorium of the Galvin Life Sciences Building and sponsored by the Knights of Columbus.

Pope plans 
visit to 
Denver 

DENVER (AP) -Pope John 
Paul II said Sunday he would 
tra~el to Denver for the 
Roman Catholic Church's 
eighth annual world youth 
day next year, his first U.S. 
trip in six years. 
Denver edged out Buffalo, 
N.Y., and Minneapolis-St. 
Paul to play host to the papal 
visit, which will coincide with 
the week-long youth 
conference in August 1993. 
"I have selected the city of 
Denver, in the noted Rocky 
Mountains, in the state of 
Colorado, which has not been 
included on the itinerary of 
my previous apostolic trips" 
to the United States, the pope 
told 30,000 worshippers at 
an open-air Palm Sunday 
Mass at Vatican City. 
Catholics rejoiced as they 
heard the news during 
church services across Col­
orado. 
"I think it will be a dream 
come true," said Renee Fa~ 
jardo of Denver. 
"It's a once~in-a-llfetime ex­
perience," said .17-year-old 
Tara Needbone of 
Northglenn. She said she 
hoped the visit and the con~ 
ference would help young 
people address such issues as 
racism and drug abuse. 
A U.S. bishops• statement 
said Denver was an 
"attractive" location for His.; 
panics in the southwestern 
United States and Central 
America. Surveys indicate the 
U.S. Catholic Church will be 50 percent Hispanic by 2020. 
Denver has about 2i5,000 
Hispanics, the largest popula· 
tion of the three cities consid­
ered for the conference. Its 
Catholic population is esti­
mated at 330,000. 
Gov. Roy Romer heralded 
Colorado's victory at an out~ 
door news conference with 
Denver Archbishop Francis 
Stafford. Romer said the 
youth conference would be a 
chance for Colorado residents 
of all religions to plan for the 
future. 
"Ultimately, matters of the 
spirit do shape our values 
whether privately or govern­
mentally:' he told the crowd 
ofabout 100. 
In New York, Bishop Ed­
ward Head of the Diocese of 
Buffalo said be was dis­
appointedthe city wasn't 
selected, brit pleased it was a 
finalist. 
"The fact that we were con· si9,ered. is In itself<!... mark.i)f recognition of the warmness arid• the good.ness .o.f the people of our diocese and of ·tJut entire western New York 
area," he said. 
Minneapolis-St. Paul.Arch· 
bishop John Roach said he, 
,too, was disappointed, but 
was .pleased that the 
conference would be in the 
United States. 
"The particular city was 
less important than the fact 
that it was to be to America," 
Roach said. He said youth 
from his archdiocese will "go 
to Denver in great numbers, I 
hope, and take advantage of 
this marvelous opportunity." 
The pope hasn't announced 
any other stops on his U.S. 
visit. 
Even before Denver was se­lected, Catholic officials drew up a tentative schedule detailing the pope's ap­pearances from his arrival at Stapl~ton International Airport Aug. 13, 1993, to his d~parturetwo dayslater. In. :.

BUSINESS BRIEFS 
Consumer orices rjse ..WASHINGTON, D.C. -Consumer prices, jolted by sharp increases for food, gasoline and clothing, rose 0.5 percent last month, the 
U.S. Labor Department said. It was the biggest increase in the Consumer Price Index in 17 months. Though, economists on Friday dismissed the surge as a one-time event unlikely to be repeated given the economy's prolonged weakness and expected anemic recovery. 
a· r" vic or causes sur e 

L NOON -Britain's financial markets cheered the Conservative party's election victory with a surge in the pound and a near­record, 5.6 percent jump in· stock prices. Prime Minister John Major's come-from­behind victory in Thursday's election will help the British economy recover from its deep, lingering recession by ending political uncertainty and boosting confidence, business leaders said. 
IBM~Ians cutbacks ... 
• N WYORK -International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) began notifying thousands of employees they are "surplus" and will have to find a job elsewhere in the computer maker or accept severance pay. The notifications, which began Friday, are part of a plan IBM announced in December to eliminate up to 20,000 jobs worldwide this year. But some analysts believe the reductions will be even greater. 
FCC rules on radio ownership llrWASHINGTON, D.C. -The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) ruled broadcasters may more than double the number of radio stations they can own nationwide. The revisions, announced Friday, allow a single licensee to own up to 30 AM radio stations and 30 FM stations nationwide. Most owners are now limited to 12 AM properties and 12 FM. 
Bush to give order on union fee use 

WASHINGTON (AP) -President Bush plans to order federal contractors Monday to post notices at job sites telling non-union employees they can insist their union fees not support political activities they op­pose. 
As the president signs an executive order to that effect, the Labor Department will announce a new rule requiring unions to report separately how much they spend for political activities, lobbying and contract negotiations, a White House source said Sunday. 
Such measures, strongly opposed by unions, will curtail their support of Democratic candidates in this election year. Unions endorse far more Democrats than Republicans. 
The White House source said an estimated 3 million workers out of 19 million with labor contracts are in union or agency shops where they must pay dues to a union while re-

George Bush 
maining a non-member. He said a published report that the new rules will deprive the unions of $2.4 billion "is probably in the ballpark." 
Plans by the president first were reported by The New York Times. The president's order will enforce a 1988 Supreme Court decision that 
held such non-union workers may be required to pay for collective bargaining and representation on labor management issues, not for other union activities. 
Unions cannot use dues for direct campaign contributions under federal Jaw, but it can be used for telephone banks, newsletters and get-out-the­vote drives. 
The refunds will not be available to union members, even if they object to the union's political activities. 
The individual in the Supreme Court case, electronics technician Harry Beck, will be at the White House event on Monday, the administration official said. 
The president had only been in office for a few months when he proposed that the change be made through legislation, as part of his campaign finance package. But Congress didn't act on the package. 
Caterpillar to hire replacements during strike 
CHICAGO (AP) -Caterpillar Inc. is going ahead with plans to hire replacements for striking United Auto Workers, even as the two sides meet Monday in a federal mediator's office to explore ending a 5-month-old strike. 
Expectations for overcoming their impasse do not necessarily match the hopes of communities that are home to almost 13,000 out-of-work employees, and analysts predict both the company and workers could hold out a lot longer. 
"This is not to negotiate, this is to find out if there's any grounds for negotiation," Caterpillar spokesman Gil Nolde said Sunday. "We very strongly believe we are still at impasse." 

Caterpillar and the UAW agreed to meet at 10 a.m. in suburban Hinsdale at the invitation of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, which has an office there. 
The company insists that mediation is not on the agenda, although Bernard DeLury, the mediation service director, is to participate. 
Even if he mediates, he can only try to persuade two sides to close the chasm that separates them on wages, health benefits and whether a new Cat contract should follow the pattern of UAW pacts with other major companies. That is far different from arbitration, in which an authorized arbitrator can decide a dispute. 
The talks are the first since negotiations collapsed March 26. The strike enters its 24th week Monday, when Caterpillar plans to go ahead by interviewing an undisclosed number of potential replacements, company spokesman Bill Lane said. 
"We've started at least one facility (in) the process of recalling laid-off workers," he said Sunday. About 2,400 Caterpillar workers who were laid off over the months before the strike began have first rights to return, and they will be regarded as strikers if they do not, Lane said.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Celebration welcoming new members into community 
Dear Editor: 
Since early September of last year, several among us at Notre Dame have been prepar­ing for entrance into the Catholic community. These thirteen men and women have undergone a dynamic process of conversion and faith formation and now stand ready to enter into full membership in the Catholic Church. 
Eight of these men and women have been baptized. They will join us in the Catholic faith and receive the sacra­ments of Confirmation and Eucharist 'through the Rite of Entrance into Full Communion. This rite will take place on Tuesday, April 14 at 5 p.m. in Sacred Heart Basilica. The participating candidates are: Rick Alvarez, Gurli Blomberg, Christopher Blum Bruce Bradley, David Gardey, John Gorkowski, Lisa Kirner and Leslie Palmer. 
The remaining five have not yet been baptized and will celebrate the Rite of initiation at the Easter Vigil mass on Saturday, April 18 at 10 p.m., again in Sacred Heart Basilica. At that time thes.e five will receive the sacraments of Baptism, Confirmation and Eucharist. They are: Patrick Hall, Erin Montgomery, William Robinson, Jason Shaw and Eric Zmarlzy. 
All members of the Notre Dame and Sacred Heart faith community are invited to join in our welcoming these new members and to support them in the faith commitment they have made.

Racist letter only continues legacy of hatred, ignorance 
Letter reveals closeminded prejudice

This is in response to Jeffrey O'Donnell's letter about Japanese business practices: "Welcome to capitalism, you Flaming Racist!" 
I can only thank God that we have hysterical facists like Mr. O'Donnell to maintain institu-

Dear Editor: 
I am writing in response to the Anti-Japanese letter sub­mitted by Jeffrey O'Donnell. In his letter, Mr. O'Donnell por­trays the people of Japan as emotionless automatons con­trolled by a ruthless MIT! (Ministry of International Trade and Industry) whose sole objective is "to undermine the industrial potential of the United States and to conquer the American market." Mr. O'Donnell's understanding of the Japanese is, at best, simplistic and ignorant, at worst, blatantly racist. 
Mr. O'Donnell's assertion that there exist unfair trade practices in some Japanese markets is well taken. I firmly agree that in a number of ar­eas, especially agriculture, Japan needs to liberalize its markets and make it easier for foreign businesses to compete on equitable terms. 
Mr. O'Donnell's conclusion, however, that these practices and the success of Japan in general are indicative of a sub­versive Japanese conspiracy to destroy America economically is patently absurd. 
It is clear to me that Mr. O'Donnell does not view the Japanese even as human. Rather, he sees them as a terri­fying economic force intent on America's downfall. He has de­humanized them so that he can consequently speak of them in terms of simplistic, single­minded characteristics not easily attributable to complex human beings. 
This is the same attitude that brought us the ignorant WWII "Know Your Enemy" films which portrayed the Japanese as passionless tools of the Emperor, and it is the paranoid escalation of this sentiment that made possible the rational­ization of the inexcusable in­ternment of Japanese­Americans during that same period. 

Mr. O'Donnell exhibits this attitude in his critique of Professor Cumming's compari­son of Japan's economic rise with that of America in the 1920's. O'Donnell claims that a key difference exists in that America was "not working in coordination with big busi­nesses planning the destruction of British industry." 
He says that "Both Britain and the USA had similar eco­nomic systems." His irrational conclusion that the differences in economic systems implies a maliciously evil design on the part of the Japanese is ludi­crous. It follows the same logic as the argument that different means evil, a remark with clear racist implications. 
His ignorant assertion that "Business considerations in Japan completely outweigh all other factors, even those of po­litical and global responsibil­ity," implying that only the Japanese are guilty of pursuing national interests ahead of global ones, is further evidence that he is incapable of objec­tively criticizing Japan. 
Finally, his malicious specu­lation that "if Japan were the head of the coalition, Saddam Hussein would control 40 percent of the world's oil and they would be happily paying $50 per barrel" speaks most eloquently of his fanatical prejudice against the Japanese. 
In regard to Mr. O'Donnell's mature conclusion that "we must first stop believing that it's our fault and that they just work harder," I would like to respond to him that the Japanese do in fact work harder. 
I had the opportunity to in­tern last summer in Japan with a company owned• by a Japanese graduate of the Notre Dame MBA program. As an in­tern, I was only required to put in a 40 hour week. The regular employees, however, regularly put in 60+ hour weeks, all of the overtime unpaid. I am not asserting that this extended work period is the sole cause for the Japanese economic suc­cess, but I do think that it is a much more plausible explana­tion than Mr. O'Donnell's para­noid delusion of a Japanese conspiracy. 
Bigotry, in some appalling form or another, will never cease to exist, and to argue against its irrationality is a fruitless task. I do not expect in this letter to convince Mr. O'Donnell that he is wrong. It is clear to me that he has re­treated into a neurotic haven and closed his mind to rational discourse. 
What I do hope to accomplish is to reveal to more objective individuals the closeminded prejudice underlying Mr. O'Donnell's remarks and, in doing so, prevent the further spread of its malignant influ­ence.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Student is tired of complaints against Bush as speaker 
Dear Editor: 
It is totally outrageous that the administration of our uni­versity has picked such a con­troversial figure as President George Bush to be the speaker at commencement. I feel that the person or persons in charge of the selection should have picked someone more represen­tative of society. 
Let's see . . . The fact that they have picked someone who is a member of the government, especially during an election year, is gross, so it can't be a politician, or even a mailman. Their choice of someone who is a war-mongering fascist is obscene, so the person should not be a soldier, or even a child who played army as a little kid. 
In fact, I think we should eliminate anyone who ever felt the pangs of competition, since war is really nothing but little boys who haven't grown up yet using real guns instead of squirt guns. Therefore, it can't be a male, since all males are psycho mil-rats, and there would never be another war if women (excuse me, I mean womyn) were in charge (like Margaret "Hello Argentina" Thatcher). 
It can't be someone who is white, since white (excuse me, I mean pigmentally-challenged) people have no realization about the strife of the minori­ties in this country. 
No heterosexuals should be allowed, since they don't repre­sent the total spectrum of sex­ual orientation in this country. 
We can't allow a non-devel­opmentally challenged person to speak, because this would mean that the university is en­dorsing the belief that handi­capped people have problems to overcome. 
If a person has a home, they should not be allowed to speak, because that won't show the suffering that our millions of homeless (excuse me, domi­cilely-challenged) people have to endure on a regular basis. 
How old is President Bush. anyway? I propose that no one older than twenty-six be al­lowed to speak, as this person would not be representative of the group to whom he will be speaking. 
President Bush doesn't like broccoli, does he! We can't have a speaker who discriminates among vegetables! How do you think they feel? 
By accepting someone who went to Yale, we are endorsing Ivy-centrism. It is terrible that people who have educations as based on western thought as Yale graduates are allowed to speak in public at all. 
President Bush grew up in America, right? America is a developed country. If we want a speaker to be totally politically correct, it should be someone who has never seen a toaster before. 

Well, I could go on forever, but let's end this by saying that what this year's senior class needs is someone who will not offend anyone and will be rep­resentative of the whole world. I propose a female, bi-sexual, fifteen-year old, omnivorous, albino, nomadic Bushman to act as our speaker for this year. I truly believe that every Domer would be the better for it. 
As you have probably guessed by now, I am really tired of all the whining that has accompa­nied the announcement that the President will be our speaker. My entire family is looking for­ward to seeing the President speak, as am I. 
It is absolutely ridiculous for people to complain that the most important man in America has deemed our university an important enough institution that he should accept an invitation to speak to our senior class. 
Instead of complaining about his policies, as too many of you are doing, do something about it. Join a society for the home­less, donate your money to en­vironmental causes, give your time to a political party, do what you can to improve what is wrong with this world. If this means vote against President Bush in the upcoming election, do so. Please, however, do not attempt to lessen the honor he has placed upon our school by saying he is not an adequate speaker, or that our school has endorsed him by choosing him as our speaker. In faet, he has endorsed our school by choos­ing it from among dozens of in­vitations he has no doubt re­ceived.

emember when all you wanted for Christmas was that new play-doh machine, the one that came with five different colors of clay? What if all you wanted was a new roof, a new furnace, hot running water, or a 
new paint job on your house? 
For many elderly, disabled, and low­income homeowners in South Bend this is a wish that is ramly granted, unless Christmas comes in April. 
Christmas has come in April for the past three years, and this year is no different. This year over fifty families, two churches, and two parks in the St. Casimir/Ford Street neighborhood were renovated and restored over the past two weekends. 
On April 4, local tradesmen and eighty Notre Dame ROTC students volunteered their time and energy to replace rooves, install bathrooms, and provide other major repairs to several locations in that area. 
On April 11, at least fourteen hundwd Notre Dame and Saint Mary's students as well as nearly one thousand volunteers from the city of South Bend participated in Christmas in April. 
Notre Dame seniors Lora Mangan, Isabel Navarrete, and Bubba Scheibel have been involved with Christmas in April since it first came to South Bend four years ago. For the past three years, they have worked to organize the thousands of volunteers from Notre Dame. 
All agreed that every year they are amazed at how quickly the work gets done; volunteers leave campus at 7:30 
a.m. and are usually finished by 3 p.m. 
The students come from a diverse group, ranging from freshmen to graduate students, all wanting to give something back to the community. 
As Notre Dame senior and four-time 

'lis the season 
Fourth annual Christmas in April project continues past success 
participant Gaby Clark explained, "It's important to build the relationship with our community. Most people don't see conditions different from their own. This is a chance to get out and do that. It's also a great way to meet tons of people from ND." 
For those who were new to the Christmas in April experience, many were unsure of what to expect. Still, they shared the idea of giving back to the community. 
Missy Pumphrey, a Notre Dame freshman, stated, "We have so much that we should be able to give back to the community. This is a great opportunity to help out." 
Graduate student Moses Garcia agreed, saying, "I was interested in doing this because it's a way for me to feel good about being a Christian." As part of Professor Jakab's conversa­tional Spanish class, Garcia and his classmates hoped to be able to use their language skills to communicate better with the residents of the neighborhood. 

Other reasons for volunteering were more personal. As Saint Mary's junior Julie Marsh explained, "My dad's been a house captain for the past two years at home. This is the first chance I've had to be involved. It's really an im­portant experience." 
There were also those with a more humorous approach to the day. Notre Dame freshman Amy Weuestefeld commented, "I thought it'd be hysterical to watch my friends operating power tools." 
Christmas in April is a national non­profit organization that provides warm, dry housing for those who cannot fix their homes themselves because of physical or financial limitations: The South Bend chapter is sponsored by the city of South Bend, the University of Notre Dame, and the Chamber of Commerce of St. Joseph County. 
The large job of organizing over one thousand student volunteers is undertaken by a committee of students under the direction of Phil Johnson, assistant director of security at Notre Dame. 
In his opinion, "Christmas in April is such a rewarding experience. I come away feeling I've received more than I've given. You really can see what you did; with such tangible results you know you've done something good. This weaves the fabric of community tighter, and that is the Notre Dame family." 
Senior Bubba Scheibel, who has been involved with the program the past four years, felt that "Phil does it all. We get the people, but he works with the administration to pull everything together." 
Photographer Steve Connelly travels to different college campuses around the country taking pictures for yearbooks. While at Notre Dame on Saturday morning watching the volunteers depart for the various sites, he observed, "The elitist view of Notre Dame isn't really valid. I've never seen anything of this scale on any campus, and I go to a lot of 'good' schools. Yale, Northwestern, Georgetown." 
Notre Dame sophomores Jessica Hoida, Ann Cook and Tim Van de Walle were members of the student committee who organized Notre Dame's part in Christmas in April. Van de Walle emphasized that "providing shelter is one of the most basic needs. The work that gets done is incredible ­it's not just touch-up stuiT." 
According to Lora Mangan, with the limit of fourteen hundred volunteers this year every person would have something meaningful to do. 
Isabel Navarrete stated, "Anyone who can participate is encouraged to, but we really need monetary donations. Funds won't allow us to use the large number of people that we can get from the Notre Dame community." 
Funded by a variety of loans, grants, and corporate contributions, Christmas in April will accept individual dona­tions at Christmas in April, 521 Eclipse Place, South Bend, IN, 46628. 
Saint Mary's presents cultural awareness event 
... 
By ERIN BROWN 
Accent Writer 
This week Saint Mary's will encounter for the first time a cultural experience called "We Are Family." 
The three day event begin­ning on Monday was organized to promote cultural awareness. Various 1wents are being sponsored by the M.I.N.T. (Minority, International. Non­Traditional student life) Committee Board of Governance, Marriott Food Services, and a committee of ten Saint Mary's students who got the events ofT the ground. 
The most impressive aspect about the program is that the entire experience is student planned and organized. The original initiator was M.I.N.T. Commissioner Tina Buchanan, who wanted to encourage cul­tural exploration. She felt that a program such as this one would do just that. 
According to Buchanan, "Women on campus need to learn that there are (many different) things that go on here." Buchanan said that she came up with the idea and suggested it to some students who she thought would be interested. 

With fellow B.O.G. members Delia Garcia and Jennifer Rasmussen, Buachan sent let­ters to other students. Everyone was very receptive and worked hard on the pro­gram, she said. "We got people thinking, involved and con­cerned. More ideas can be generated from this." 
The events in the line-up for this week include: Family Photos: Images of Our 
People to be presented Monday by Dr. Pat Washington, Director of M.I.N.T., Manini Smarth, English Department Lecturer, and Notre Dame history pro­fessor, Marcia Sawyer. The event will take place at 7 p.m. in Haggar Parlor. Monday is also Indian Food Night at the dining hall. 
There will be a lecture called "Embracing the World" on Tuesday. Saint Mary's Economics Lecturer, Ravindra Parashar will speak at 12:15 
p.m. in Haggar Parlor. The dining hall will also be 
preparing Soul Food. 
On Wednesday, the third and final night of the events, will be "Party All Over the World." Mr. Benito Salazar, a Spanish guitarist, will perform at 8:15 
p.m. at Dalloway's Coffeehouse. Then at Dalloway's at 9 p.m. will be live music and folkdancing from such countries as Greece, Turkey, Bulgaria, and South Africa . 
Buchanan. who will hold the same position again next year, hopes to continue the program and sponsor more activities in the years to come.

SMC softball 
splits two at 

North Central 
By JENNIFER GUSTAFSON Sports Writer 
The Saint Mary's softball tf~am upped its record to 9-8 on the season after walking away from the North Central College tournament with onH win and one loss on Saturday. 
The day began with a 7-4 loss to tough division III opponent Elmhurst College. 
Elmhurst started thn game by scoring fiw runs in the first in­ning and two in the second, while thf' BPIIPs went scoreless in the first two. Aftllr this drive, the BPIIes turned the tables and wtmt on a 4-0 run for the remainder of the game. 
According to sophomore co­captain Jane Murphy, a change In intensity was the main con­tributor to this turn around. 
uour intensity picked up a lot after the first two innings be­cause of all of the mental er­rors that had been made. We started playing with our heads in the game." 
The intensity level remained high throughout the second game, against Trinity College as the Belles easily defeated them 11-4. The Belles played strong from the beginning and dominated the entire game. 
"We were very offensively ag­gressive throughout the game, and had few mental errors." Murphy said. 
The Belles were supposed to play a third game against North Central College, but the game was called because o darkness. 
Murphy believes that the Belles pHrformance this week­end should help them in the games to come. 
" We are more confident after playing well this weekend. The experience was good for our young infield. and we played much more aggressively, both oiTensively and defensively." 
Once again freshman Lisa Bright was called upon by the Belles. Bright went the distance on the mound both games. As well as pitching well, she also contributed two doubles in the second game to help add to the victory. 
The Belles look to continue their winning ways today against Albion College. Last year the Belles split with the Brittons, but hope to walk away with two wins this year. Although the Brittons have a pretty good sophomore pitcher. they graduated their catcher and shortstop last year, both o whom were key players. The game is the make-up of a game that was called earlier this sea­son because of the weather.

Lacrosse dominates Mount Saint Mary's 
By GEORGE DOHRMANN Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame lacrosse team showed no signs of being content with its first national ranking in two years, stunning Mt. St. Mary's 13-3. 
A week after the USILA tagged the Irish 22nd in their weekly poll, Randy Colley netted five goals, and the Notre Dame dHfense used a team effort to conquer the Mount. 
"We don't talk much about it," coach Kevin Corrigan remarked about the team's national ranking. "We just take a lot of pride in the way we have been playing." 
At times, Mt. St. Mary's looked more like the Belles from the St. Mary's across the road, as a host of Irish defenders, led by Pete Senger and Doug Murray bullied the Mount into submission. 
"We've played real aggressive and I think that took them away from some of the things they wanted to do," said Corrigan. 
The Mount managed only one goal in the first half, which came early in the opening period. 
After the lone score, the Irish held Mt. St. Mary's scoreless for a 22-minute span. Occupying the goal during that stretch was junior Chris Parent who has shined this season between the posts. '

manhandling the Mount, Colley and the rest of the Notre Dame attack was improving their scoring average. 
Ed Lamb and Willie Sutton chalked up two goals apiece from their midfield positions. The duo were two of seven players to victimize the Mt. St. Mary's defense. 
The performance by senior attackman Mike Sullivan was once again brilliant. His goal and two assists on Saturday moved him only three points away from the Notre Dame all­time scoring mark, currently held by Joe Franklin an Irish player from 1983-86. 
Although he is excited about the opportunity to eclipse the record, Sullivan is more focused on the team's goals for the rest of the season. 
"Right now I am more concerned about the remaining games, and the opportunity to get into the NCAA tournament," said Sullivan. "It would definitely be great to get the record, but it is something which I am not concerned with right now." 
Sullivan and the rest of the Irish have focused their attention to Stony Brook, their opponent today at Moose Krause Stadium. 
"We expect to face a similar team to Mt. St. Mary's," commented Corrigan about Stony Brook. "They will be a little better about trying to control the tempo of the game than Mt. St. Mary's." 
Notre Dame has not faced Stony Brook since 1989 in Corrigan's coaching debut for the Irish. The Irish fell 8-7 in that matchup, but a repeat of

Pfeffer a record-breaker at Little States Invite 

By NICOLE MCGRATH Saint Mary's Sports Editor 
Hunning on the nation's best track at Indiana University­Purdue University in Indianapolis at the Little States Invitational, the Saint Mary's track team turned in a dazzling performance, courtesy of senior Lynn Pfeffer. 
Pfeffer left opponents in the dust by placing first place in the ·avelin throwing for one hundred and twenty-three feet and nine inches. She set a new school record as well as setting a Little States record. 
"Lynn had a super meet and put in a good performance," said Coach Larry Szczechowski. "The weather was nice and there was a charged atmo­sphere." 
In the triple jump, Pfeffer placed fifth jumping thirty­three feet and eight inches set­ting another school record. She also had a personal best in the long jump placing sixteen feet and one and a half inches. 
Senior Sharon Fisher ran the 1500m where she had a per­sonal best time of 5:32.77. Meanwhile, Darcy Bishop tore up the lanes with personal best in two events. For the 100m. 
she had a time of 13.15 while in 
the 200m Darcy had a time o 
29.01. 
The Belles were short a run­ner for the 4x4 relay but they found that senior Katie Linehan easily filled in. Linehan. who is basically a sprinter, did a great job of keeping the Belles on track, according to Szczechowski. 
Youth on the team proved to be a boost for the Belles. Freshmen Moja Brennan and Karen Cook had success in their events. For Brennan, she ran the 100m setting a personal best of 13.62. Meanwhile, Cook placed seventh in the BOOm having a personal best o 3:52.05. 
"It's not easy when you're in­experienced," said Szczechowski, " but they stepped out and did a real nice job." 
The Belles' sophomores also had a strong showing at the meet. .Jackie Buckley ran the 3,000m scoring a personal best of 12:24.74. She was impressive because she had her ankle taped up due to a minor injury. 
"Jackie had a very gutty per­formance," stated Szczechowski. "She set a goal and achieved her best time."

revenue sport, you're a fool to think otherwise. But you don't expect to get dropped," MeCann commented. 
Notre Dame Sports Information Director John I Ieisler said that the decision to discontinue the program was not made for monetary rea­sons. 
"Ultimately, we feel the funds allocated to wrestling can bet­ter be be directed toward pro­grams that will more directly impact a larger portion of the student body and the University community." Rosenthal added. 
llowever, any reassignment of scholarship funds could not take place immediately beeause Notre Dame will honor its commitment to any current re­cipients of grants-in-aid. 
Assistant coach Rick Stewart will not be retained by the University. 
"lie's got a wife and three young children. But he's the best, and he's a high-profile figure. I expect Hick to find something beeause he's just too good not to be hired," McCann said of his assistant. 
Also, one has to wonder about the futures of the Irish wrestlers, especially McGrew, who was highly recruited out of high school and has two years of eligibility remaining. 
McCann feels that each wrestler's situation is different. "It depends on the kid, what year he's in and how much eli· 
gibility he has left. It's a deci­sion they're going to have to come up with, whether they de­cide on another program or stay {at Notre Dame) to com­plete their degree," McCann said. 
"I recommend to them that they take a day or so and let the shock sink in a bit and decide for themselves what they want. I'll help each kid in any way if I can." 

Men's tennis MCC champs again 
By JONATHAN JENSEN 
Sports Writer 
Here they go again. 

The Notre Dame men's tennis 
team has been a member of the 
Midwestern Collegiate 
Conference for four years now, 
and each year the results in the 
conference tournament have 
been remarkably similar. 

Four conference champi­onships, four MCC coach of the year awards for Irish coach Bob Bayliss, and 35 of the 36 possible titles have followed the Irish's participation in the con­ference, with this year's per­formance strictly following the prescribed formula. 
This year the lrish, despite resting its top singles player and two top doubles teams, won all nine flights in straight sets to capture its fourth con­secutive title. 
"It's always tough to assume the mantle of the favorite," noted Bayliss. "Sometimes you find yourself playing not lose rather than playing to win, but I think we handled it well." 
That could be a major under­statement. Because third­ranked David DiLucia rested his sore shoulder this weekend, all of the singles players moved up one spot. Nevertheless, Andy Zurcher, Chuck Coleman, Will Forsyth, Tom North, Ron Rosas, and Chris Wojtalik all won titles on straight-set victories. 
Coleman and Rosas each won their third MCC title, and Zurcher's 6-2, 6-2 victory over Butler's Ludovid Aaron in the top singles match gave him his second championship. 
In the doubles competition, the Irish's sweep was a little more impressive. Moving from third to first-doubles was the sophomore team of Tom North and Tad Eckert, and they re­sponded with a 6-1, 6-1 title win over Evansville's Brad Slack and Carl Underwood. 
At second-doubles, the Irish planned to go with the team of sophomore Todd Wilson and 
"We did everything the university expected and were competitive with the Big-10, which is the highest quality wrestling in the country." 
"We've come a long way in a short time, and I've got to feel good about that. Looking back we've had some good times."

freshman Antonio Payumo. However, Payumo came down with an illness on Friday and was unable to compete at full strength. So Chris Wojtalik stepped in and the two beat Butler's Oliver Blackhouse and James Ward 6-4, 6-4 to win the title. 
"They played a real talented team," said Bayliss, "And they responded to the challenge." 
At three-doubles, Bayliss went with the tandem of sophomore Allan Lopez and freshman Horst Dziura. After breezing past their first-round opponent, they faced set point down 5-4 in the opening set of a match against Mike Harley and Matt Rohl of Evansville. They battled back to win the set and then won a tiebreaker in the second set to win the match 7­5, 7-6. 
On Sunday they won the con­ference title with an impressive 6-1, 6-1 win over Butler's Matt Schiller and Paul Feindt. 
"They playnd a lot sharper on Sunday," said Bayliss. "Allan has grown a lot over the past year, and this win gives us a good look at the long-term fu­ture." 
All in all, Bayliss was most impressed with thn way the team never lost sight of their goal. 
"It would have been easy to lose focus and sight of what we wHre out on the court for," said Bayliss, "But we never did."

out powerful Taylor, 9-0 
By NICOLE MCGRATH Saint Mary's Sports Editor 
Saint Mary's tennis team smoked yet another opponent on Saturday by downing Taylor 9-0. 
First singles Ellen Mayer blasted Tica Laughner away 6­0, 6-3. 
The Lady Trojans boasted of two of the states' top singles' players, freshmen Andrea Beutler and Dana Steckley, but even their skill could not choke up a set. 
Second· singles Marie Koscielski stole away a poten­tial win 6-2, 7-6 (8-6) from Beutler . Teammate Mary Cosgrove swiftly defeated Lisa Gallagher 6-1, 6-1. 
Natalie Kloepfer, at fourth singles, stunned highly touted Steckley 6-4, 6-0. Thayma Darby still rode her hot streak by beating Jennifer Rudloph 6­1, 6-0. Darby now boosts her record to 13-1. 
Rounding up the singles, Andrea Ayers completed their 
domination by defeating Nicki Kemp 6-1, 7-5. 
First doubles duo Mayer and Koscielski had to fight for a win over Laughner and Gallagher 6­3, 4-6, 7-6 (7-1). According to Mary Ellen Smith, standing in for Coach Jo-Ann Nester, this doubles match was tough. 
"At the end of the third set, they wanted it," said Smith, "and they went after it." 
Cosgrove and Ayers, second doubles team, struck down Beutler and Steckley 6-3, 6-2. Finally third doubles cohorts Darby and Shannon McGinn took down Rudolph and Kemp 6-2, 6-1. 
"We were clearly a more su­perior team," stated Nester after the Belles' win. 
As for the rest of the season, Nester cautions that it is still too soon to think about post­season play in the Division III tournament. 
"After break, Kalamazoo College will be the turning point where we can start looking forward to the nationals," said Nester.

a 390-foot line drive over the right-center field wall to give the Aces a 3-1 lead. 
"Those two leadoff walks hurt us," said Murphy. "Sinnes is an effectively wild pitcher, and sometimes he walks people. But he did a good job of bounc­ing back." 
The Irish rebounded in the bottom of the fourth. With two outs, Lisanti and Layson reached on errors, and Mee took advantage. Mee crushed Evansville starter Curtis Broome's first pitch over the right field fence to put Notre Dame up for good, 4-3. 
On Sunday afternoon, a ter­rific performance from pitcher Leahy powered the Irish to a 4­0 win over visiting Evansville. 
Leahy's four-hit shutout not only completed a four-game sweep of the Aces, but it also impressed the throng of pro scouts that came to watch the 6-7 junior prospect perform. 
"Our pitching has been out­standing all weekend," said Irish head coach Pat Murphy, "So it is no surprise that Pat pitched well." 
Leahy's teammates also gave him four runs to work with even though it was more than he needed. 
The Irish started it off in the first, with Layson walking and advancing to third on a sacri­fice by Mee and a groundout from Counsell. Layson then brought home the first Irish run when Danapilis reached base on an error. 
Notre Dame manufactured another run in similar fashion in the second, with freshman Paul Failla singling, stealing second, and then scoring on a Dan Bautch fielders choice. 
Failla lit a fire with another single in the fourth, followed by a walk from Edwin Hartwell. Bautch then got his second and third RBI's of the afternoon as he singled to bring both of the runners home.

Surprised wrestling team speaks out 
By JIM VOGL Assistant Sports Editor 
Notre Dame Athletic Director 

Hichard Hosenthal's an­
nouncement that wrestling 
would be terminated as a var­
sity sport made a devastating 
impact on a large sector of the 
school's community, including 
coaches, players, alumni and 
fans. 
Fran McCann, head coach of 

the program for eight years, 
had perhaps the most at stake. 
MeCann, whose 50-53-1 record 
at the Irish helm came against 
the nation's very best wrestling 
programs, felt next year would 
be one of his best, certainly not 
his last. 
Although obviously jilted, 
McCann responded with grace 
and understanding in accepting 
a teaching position in the P.E. 
department next year while 
continuing to coordinate sum­
mer athletic camps at the 
University. 
"They're being good to me," he said, unable to hide the hurt in his voice. "I have my Masters in Physical Education and taught full time in college for 16 years. There's not much market out there for a 52 year­old ex-wrestling coach ... " 
McCann's job was always to help others. Now, it's no dif­ferent, as he devotes himself to helping others recover from the initial shock. 
First on the list is McCann's six-year assistant Rick Stewart, who now finds himself unem­ployed. 
"Hick's got a wive and three young children," said McCann. "But he's the best; he's a high­profile figure and I expect Rick to lind something, because he's just too good not to be hired." 
Stewart, a Duncan, Ok., na-

funds to boost some other program. The wrestling squad, for example, could have trimmed the number of avail­able scholarships from the NCM maximum of 11 down to six or seven, and that would have generated additional rev­enue. 
Or, possibly along with some small eutbacks in the wrestling program, the University could trim the budgets of some other programs. Just because the wrestlers do not bring in as much money as the football or basketball programs does not mean that the athletes do not train as hard or put forth as much effort in representing the University in competition as the players on those squads do. 
In effect, it seems as though the University has done the wrestlers an injustice, without warning stripping them of their status as a varsity team. It might behoove some of the members of the squad to look into other schools to continue their wrestling, should they want to continue their wrestling careers. 
More importantly, the Athletic Department should rethink its action. Who's to say that some other program might not disappear in the future? Some of the other coaches at Notre Dame might not be too comfortable at the moment. However, in the future, should we have a Physical Education Department full of ex-coaches, then we will have one of the best departments around, something Notre Dame could b1~ proud of. 
It should be interesting to see where the money goes. 
tive, wrestled at Oklahoma 
State, and was assistant coach 
for both his alma mater and 
Clemson before coming to Notre 
Dame. 
Junior Emil Soehnlen. like the 
majority of the wrestlers, ex­
pressed the utmost respect for 
the Irish coaches. 
"They're the reason why I 
came, why a lot of these people 
came and then the university to 
treat them like they are, it 
doesn't show a lot of concern." 
Marcus Gowens, a four-year starter under McCann, ex­pressed bitterness and confu­sion after hearing the news. 
"Rosenthal has a personal vendetta against the, wrestling program. He doesn't like the coaches but is afraid to fire them, so instead he cuts the whole program." 
McCann expressed concern for former wrestlers like Gowens, who will have little remind them of their endless hours of hard work on Notre Dame's mats and weight rooms. 
"It's going to be hard on the alumni because there's nothing to come back to. They have the school, but it's not going to be the same." 
The announcement could not have come as a bigger shock to McCann, who was first ap­proached by Rosenthal on Thursday. On Friday afternoon, he got the tragic news. 
Then, he had to deliver the toughest speech in his 23-year college coaching career. 
"He really didn't have to say much. His tears said about it all," reported junior Emil Soehnlen. "He just said he'd do anything for us, if we wanted to transfer he said he would talk to other coaches." 
"They're hurt, they're obvi­ou&Y__ A_isappointed and 

shocked," said McCann shortly 
after meeting with the team. "I 
saw obvious pain." 

Freshman Mike Fox explained 
the unexpectedness of the news 
that took the team by storm. 

"At 3 p.m., we were in the weight room lifting. At 4, we find out we don't have a pro­gram anymore." 
"Taking wrestling away was crushing to me," said Fox, who along with the rest of Notre Dame's young and talented squad, have a lot to consider in a short period of time. The signing date to be eligible to wrestle next season for another school is Wednesday, April15. 
"The toughest part about it is, next year we thought we'd have an excellent team," said McCann, who would have lost four senior starters and still probably returned with an even better team. 
J.J. McGrew, the 177-pound sophomore who entered the NCAA finals in both of his first two years, would have returned as a strong candidate for All­American this time around. Also, the team would have been bolstered by the return of red­shirt heavyweight Steve King. 
Freshmen starters Matt Beaujon, Mike Fox and Ed Jamieson, and late-season sen­sations Harris Brumer and Brian Murphy showed signs producing strong sophomore seasons. Sophomore 118­pounder Chris Jensen will also have his Irish career severed and unfulfilled. 
"We'll have to make our deci­sions on where we want to go to college all over again," said Fox. 
"A lot of us have been wrestling since first-grade, kindergarten," said Soehnlen. "It's not all they know how to do, but wrestling's a major part of their life. It's like getting a leg cut off; it's always been there. Now you're really putting them in a bad situation to make them decide." 

"It's the type of sport that's gets in your blood, the amount of time and dedication," McCann reiterated. "They've competed since their early teens and before. They always knew it would end one day, but not prematurely; that's the real shock, that it was so unex­pected." 
Juniors Jamie Boyd and Soehnlen, who have finally established themselves at Notre Dame but still have a lot of goals to meet, face equally tough decisions. 
Said Sochnlen: "I don't want to live the rest of my life saying, should I have wrestled my se­nior year in college? I was so close this year to doing a lot. I lose to the national champ 5-3 and lost to many All-Americans by a point. I think I'm right there." 
McCann knows the impact of dropping the program devas­tates the lives of young wrestlers and veteran coaches alike. "I don't know if I ever will (get over it). It's taken 20 some years to get in my blood, and knowing that it's taken away is hard." 
As for his crew, "They've been a a close knit group in the last several years and now thpy're all s lit u . "

From the Sidelines 
University does wrestlers an injustice 

The 1992 NCAA wrestling championships were held in Oklahoma City this past Mareh, and Notre Dame sent three athletes to the competition to showcase their talents. 
Marcus Gowens, J . .J. McGrew, and Chuck Weaver all performed admirably at the competition. Gowens reaehed the medal round before falling to Oklahoma's Shawn Harrison. 
McGrew cruised to victories in his first two matchl~s before faltBring. 
Weaver dropped his opBning tournament match to North Carolina State's Sylvester Terkay, who had ripped through a 27-0 regular season and eventually finished sBcond. After a tough 3-0 victory over Missouri's JBremy Lay, Weaver fell to Lorenzo Neal of Fresno State. 
For Gowens and Weaver, seniors, this season marked a final chance for glory, a farewell tour of sorts. But for McGrew and all the other underclassmen on the squad, they all had next year to look forward to, with the possibility of bigger and better things to come. 
Unfortunately, they had all hopes wiped out when the athletic director Dick Hosenthal announeed on Friday that the University was dropping the wrestling program. Budget cuts had to be made, 
" and the axe-wielding architects of the athletic department decided to slice the wrestlers away. The wrestling team has been successful, as this year's results undoubtedly display. Three wrestlers in the NCAA championships is a strong showing, and it held the promise of top­notch recruiting and even more success in the coming years. Now. however. people like J.J. McGrew, who turned down more traditional Wrt$tling powerhouses, instead gambling on an up-and-coming wrestling program at Notre Dame, will have to look somewhere else to get the chance to perfect their skills. The hard work and dedication put in here is gone, as is a ehanee of getting Notre Dame's first wrestling national champion. As far as the coaehes are concerned, head coach Fran McCann will be transferred to the Physical Education department, while assistant Rick Stewart is seeking employment elsewhere. · Wrestling is not represented in any intramural programs, nor can one opt to take it in physieal education freshmen year. Surely other options were available that would have been less damaging. Wrestling might not have been a big monetary draw for the University, but there are other sports that don't exactly pack in the crowds either. That should not have been an excuse. The Athletic Department has a rather largn budget, and could have simply cut baek on the program if they needed extra

Oh, what a weekend. 
The 22nd ranked Notre Dame baseball team (18-9) swept Midwestern Collegiate Conference rival Evansville in four straight games over the course of the weekend. Irish pitchers Chris Michalak, AI Walania, David Sinnes, and Pat Leahy turned in stellar perfor­mances on the mound en route to the sweep. 
In Friday night's series opener at Coveleski Stadium, Michalak (5-1) had complete control over the Purple Aces in his complete game in which the Irish shut out Evansville 6-0. 
"I was trying to keep the ball on the ground and let our defense do their job," said Michalak. "I got into the groove early and was able to go right at the hitters." 
The Irish got on the board early in the game scoring once in the first inning and mounting a three-run rally in the second. 
Evansville starter John MacCauley (5­
4) ran into some control problems in the third inning. Adam Maisano and Bob Lisanti got the inning started with back­to-hack singles, but Maisano got caught leaning at second by Aces' catcher Sal Fasano. Layson reached base on a throwing error by shortstop Aaron Gries. MacCauley then served up a pair of walks to Mee and Craig Counsell which brought home Lisanti.
