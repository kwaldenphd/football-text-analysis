INSIDE COLUMN 




TheYear of Women needs broader focus 
Once again this Uni­versity has decided to broaden the perspec­tives of its students by dedicating the whole year to a par­ticular issue and this year it's women. As a 


woman, and especially Lisa Eaton 
as a gender studies concentrator. I ought Production Manager 
to be thrilled that the university is open minded enough to spend an entire year dealing with issues that are particularly close to my heart, but I'm not. I think that The Year of Women is an all time low in the history of "The Year of... 
The university hopes to raise the con­sciousness of the students by focusing this year on women's issues. This is an excellent idea, especially in view of the current state of male-female relations on this campus, but "The Year of..." context is not the proper place to do this. 
The objection I have to the whole idea is that this year is just a superficial and tem­porary remedy to problems that run very deep. Once this year is over, I predict that women's issues will follow the path of cul­tural diversity and the family to become just a fond memory for the administration to smile about. 
If the consci{msness of the student body is really going to be changed in respect to women's issues, it is going to have to be a long term process, not a quick fix remedy. The administration ought to make male-fe­male relations on this campus a permanent focus for the next few years. I propose, in­stead of the Year of Women, the Decade of Gender Relations. 
Secondly,. the Year of Women is directly relevant to less than half of the Notre Dame student body. If awareness is the goal of the university, it should choose a topic that every person on this campus can relate to directly. Women's issues are really only rel­evant to· women. Let's face it, no matter how liberated and understanding a guy may be, the Year of Women really does not apply to him. 
Cultural diversity was broad enough to encompass all types of people, as was the Year of the Family. Although the last two years have not been as enlightened as this year's topic, they were far more holistic. I think the university ought to strive to focus on issues that are important to alt students. 
Rather than emphasizing the differences between students, they ought to try to focus on the issues that will unite them. For ex­ample, the Year of Political Awareness or the Year of International Relations would be broad enough to be interesting to all people. 
I applaud the university's attempts to fo­cus on women's issues in a positive and constructive manner. I simply feel that they are being short-sighted in believing that the Year of Women will accomplish anything permanent in the way of change on this campus.

Pope John Paul II on Wednesday urged forgiveness and reconciliation in Burundi, a central African nation with a history of tribal warfare and repression of Roman Catholics. He also said the AIDS virus, which has ravaged Africa, was a moral issue that calls for changes in sexual behavior. The church condemns the use of condoms to check the spread of the deadly disease. The pope said the church has a duty to assist AIDS sufferers with health care and moral support. "These people often tend to close themselves in an anguished silence," he said.

Ousted Communist Party chief Zhao Ziyang was seen in public for the first time in about 16 months, playing golf with his wife, Japanese diplomats said Thursday. The sighting was the first since May 1989, when Zhao made a tearful visit to students demonstrating for democracy in Tiananmen Square. A month later, after the violent June 3-4 military crackdown, Zhao was stripped of all his posts. He was accused of "splitting the party" by supporting the popular pro-democracy movement, which officially is referred to as a "counter­revolutionary rebellion."

BCAC to be more active 
By DANNIKA SIMPSON News Writer 
The Black Cultural Arts Council (BCAC) announced plans to become more active in the Notre Dame and South Bend Community at its meeting Wednesday evening. · 
One of the goals Co-President Tony Smith announced is to become more involved with the South Bend community. The club will be working with the Upward Bound program. Two days a week they will tutor un­derpriveleged high school stu­dents who are interested in go­ing to college. The tutors will work one on one with students and try to keep them interested in higher education. 
In addition, a program will be started to provide positive role models for high school students. College students wil be matched with high school students who are in need of positive role models. The col­lege students will be available to listen to the students needs and will try to help them with problems they may encounter. 
The BCAC will also work with the Big Brother/Big Sister program of South Bend. The officers would like to give something back to the South Bend community and think these programs are a good way of doing so. 
The BCAC wants to become more involved with the Notre Dame community. They will work with the Student Senate in hopes to address areas of mi­nority student concerns. They will act as a support network for all minority students and plan to become more visible in the Notre Dame community. They want to be known for more than the annual fashion and talent show. 
The BCAC also voted to change the name of the organi­zation. Member's feel that .a name change will more clearly define the goals they have set for this year.

Non-smokers still face risk 
BOSTON (AP) -Non-smok­ers who grew up with smoking parents face double the usual risk of lung cancer, according to a study that provides new evidence of the dangers of sec­ondhand smoke. 
The report estimates that 17 percent of all lung cancer in the United States among people who never smoked cigarettes results from their exposure to smokers during childhood and adolescence. 

smoke. 
"It makes a strong case that exposure to secondhand smoke as a child increases your risk as an adult. This is quite con­vincing," commented Dr. Stan­ton Glantz of the University of Ca1ifornia, San Francisco. 
The study, published in Thursday's New England Jour­nal of Medicine, was based on a survey of 191 non-smokers in New York state who were diag­nosed with lung cancer during the early 1980s. Researchers calculated their lifetime expo­sure to cigarette smoke and 
compared  it  with  that  of  
healthy non-smokers.  
The  researchers  added  up  

each person's "smoker-years." This is the years they lived in a house multiplied by the number of smokers there. For instance, someone who lived at home for 18 years with two smoking parents had exposure of 36 smoker-years. 
"Here is another piece of evi­dence that smoke from other people's cigarettes is harmful to your health. This is the first finding that indicates that ex­posure early in life may be par­ticularly important," said Dr.

Hoosiers pay lowest auto iinsurance rates in· nation 
N.J. drivers pay the highest premiums, with Washington, D.C. not far behind 
INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -Indi­ana motorists pay the nation's 13th lowest rate for auto in­surance, averaging about $454 a year, the Alliance of American Insurers rtported Wednesday. 
A major reason for the mod­erate rate is that Hoosiers have 69 percent fewer auto-related lawsuits and 39 percent fewer car thefts than drivers in most states, said company President Franklin Nutter. 
"The system in Indiana seems to be working well," said Nut­ter, speaking at the annual 
CHERRY HILL, N.J. Harvey,. Lamm ra chairman and officer of Subaru lea, vyhich merged with ·Fuji Heavy Ltd., the companies nounced Tuesday. 
The ..joint announcement came four days after the merger ~hat made Subaru of America a wholly subsidiary of Fuji dustries, the Jatlanese facturer that cars. ;¥:¥ 
Lamm: one of the of Subaru of America became its 1986. 
meeting of the Insurance Insti­tute of Indiana. "The cost of auto insurance may be a major issue in some states, but it shouldn't be in Indiana." 
Nutter said there is a miscon­ception that people pay a large chunk of their household in­comes on car insurance. 
However, Hoosier car owners pay just 1.9 percent of their budgets on auto premiums while spending 1.1 percent on life insurance and 1.6 percent on health insurance, Nutter said. 
By comparison, llndiana resi­dents spend 29.6 percent of their annual budget on housing, 
16.7 percent on transportation and 15.1 percent on food, he said. 
New Jersey has the nation's highest auto premiums, a steep $1,100 on avera!~e. primarily because it has the nation's highest number of cars per square mile, Nutter said. Washington, D.C., ranked sec­ond with an 11verage annual premium of abo.... , $879. 
Sparsely populated Nebraska has the nation's cheapest auto premiums, with an average of $336 a year. 
To lower Indiana auto premi­ums even more, Nutter sug­gested being careful when buy­ing a car because newer, more expensive automobiles or ones with fewer safety features are more expensive to insure. He also suggested raising de­ductibles, insuring all house­hold cars under the same policy and keeping a clean driving 
record. Steve Williams, president of the insurance institute, said Nutter's figures agree with a finding by the State Motor Ve­hicles Issues Committee, which reviewed Hoosier auto premi­ums this summer and found last month that no changes were necessary. 
Nutter heads a national trade association representing 170 property and casualty insur­ance companies. 

'Vanishing lady' leaves fortune 
LONDON (AP) -Before she died in January, Dorothea Allen destroyed family papers and letters and tore the date and place of birth from her pass­port. She left more than $2.8 million in cash, no traceable next of kin, no will, no birth certificate, no marriage certifi­cate, and a growing list of claimants to her fortune. 
So far, 31 people have come forward. claiming to be heirs of the woman known in British newspapers as "the vanishing lady." 
By law, claimants have 12 years to prove they are blood relatives. If they fail, the for­tune goes to the state treasury. 
Treasury lawyers ordered the sale of her effects, including mink coats, a 1972 Rolls-Royce Corniche and a 1964 Daimler. jewelry, paintings, furniture, silver and other trappings from a glamorous past that by some accounts included a trip across the dance floor with Fred As­taire. 

The sale, conducted Tuesday by Sotheby's at her 300-year­old home, added $1.08 million cash to the estate. The home it­self, in the village of Sutton-un­der-Brailes 90 miles northwest of London, is expected to fetch another $1.3 million when it is sold. 
According to Sotheby's, the latest claimant to come for­ward is Wilfried Kluber from Baden-Baden, West Germany, who says his grandmother was Mrs. Allen's sister. 
Kluber told Sotheby's that his grandmother's maiden name was Farquharson, and that Mrs. Allen was born in 1901. His letter has been passed along to the treasury, Sotheby's said. 
The Times of London said an­other claimant is Merilyn Hor­ton of Cleveland, Ohio. It re­ported that Mrs. Horton says her great-grandfather was a Scottish immigrant named Far­quharson.

EDITORIAL 

Students must seize chance to participate 
In their campaign last spring, Student Body President 
Rob Pasin and Vice-President Fred Tombar said the students were their top priority for the coming year. This fall, Pasin and Tombar have made a concerted effort to listen to the thoughts of their constituents. 
The first Student Body Address tonight in the Center for Continuing Education, will give students a long-­awaited opportunity to voice their opinions to their leaders. Students are strongly encouraged to attend the address-as contributors, as well as listeners. 
Pasin and Tombar are hosting the event, which will be open to all students. The address, as well as the question and answer session which will follow, exemplifies their desire for increased student input. Communication, however, is a two-way street. Just as Pasin and Tombar are making the effort to communicate with the students, the students must also do their part by attending the lecture, asking questions and making their voices heard. 
Notre Dame students have a right to know what is happening on campus. Along with that right comes the duty to contribute and actively participate in discussion and debate. Passive complaining will accomplish nothing. 
One of complaints heard most frequently on campus is the administration's alleged failure to consult the students on important decisions. A perfect example of this is the change in the alcohol policy at SYRs two years ago. Most of the student body was irate because they felt their opinions were ignored when the change was affected. 
Pasin and Tombar are trying to foster student involvement in light of these complaints. For their efforts to be successful, the students must respond. If the students wish to be treated like mature, thoughtful individuals, they must seize this opportunity to prove themselves. 
Pasin and Tombar are making a concerted effort to keep the communication lines open between students and student government. To achieve this aim, they have installed a telephone hot line for student complaints, and have also scheduled dorm visits to personally consult with residents of each hall. Tonight's Student Body Address is also an important step toward this end. 
The student leaders are making a visible effort to serve the students. It is in the student body's best interest to respond. 
DOONESBURY 
U.S. seeks out uses for military might 
By Enrique Dussel 

Iraq's invasion of Kuwait cannot be legitimized by any means .. . as no military intervention can. Latin Americans, especially, can understand the feeling of the Kuwaiti people after so many 
U.S. interventions in the last centuries. 
In my opinion, the present situation in the "Gulf crisis" and the massive deployment of U.S. troops in the region point to several remarkable situations in the U.S. (and also at the University of Notre Dame). 
1) It appears that, in the 1980s, U.S. society has been very susceptible to a special mixture of nationalist-populist­religious-military-white male­discourse of the White House and most of the national mass media. In these days, some even try to make obnoxious comparisons between the U.S. invasion in Panama and the one in Kuwait. The former is justified by the claim that it was a "legitimate national security problem" and resulted in U.S. troops "placing" a new (U.S. friendly) government, while the "naked aggression" of Iraq, led by a crazy man similar to Hitler, has to be condemned strongly. The 'innocent help' of the U.S. in Panama killed around 4,000 Panamanians. The quick and massive military reaction of the 
U.S. in the Gulf, once one considers the one hundred-plus direct U.S. military interventions in Latin America alone in this century and the recent recurrence of an emphasis on the "autonomy of the nations" and the "sovereignty of states," cannot have any credibility at all and seems to be nothing more than an open hypocrisy. 
2) Far more important, and sadly for all "Rambos," the U.S. is no longer economically able to lead a massive intervention or war, as it did in Vietnam. The U.S. hegemony seems to have accepted a new international labour division; it intervenes militarily, and the affected nations pay the costs (as some European nations and Japan have already accepted). The U.S. military might become (or already is) an international mercenary troop, doing all the dirty work other nations will not do. 
3) Far more serious is the fact that the present "Gulf crisis" might become a personal issue for Bush in the next few months. It seems to be the case that a military solution is not now possible-either in Kuwait or in Iraq. How will Bush react to the increasing pressure of the U.S. population if more than 50,000 soldiers will have to stay in the region and no immediate "actions" are taken (especially in the case of the hostages)? Isn't a military action going to be necessary to reassert Bush's reputation, to justify the costs and deaths in "accidents"? 
4) Did the Bush Admin­istration calculate the risks of sending troops to Saudi Arabia before the UN? A long military presence of the U.S. in the region might have significant effects. How long and how many soldiers will have to stay, even if Kuwait is "recovered"? How will the Arabic population feel if their holy places (Mecca, Medina) are invaded by foreign (non-believing) soldiers? 
5) In this decade, the U.S. will face an increasingly Islamic fundamentalist movement in the Gulf region and in Asia. This movement will be radically hostile to U.S. interests and "superbly" armed by the U.S. itself (as Noriega, an ex-friend of Bush, was). See, for instance, the cases of Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, Afghanistan (Mudjaheidin) and North Africa. 
In this context, the U.S. war machine is working full time at high speed in all possible medias, searching for all kinds of arguments to justify an unjustified military intervention in Iraq. After reading the newspaper or watching TV, one may experience this new "we­feeling." But let us face it: Believing in the "sovereignty of states" argument in the U.S. version is nothing more than naive innocence, which, while having devastating effects in other countries, is especially difficult to accept for an important part of the U.S. population-primarily the military forces themselves. 
Enrique Dussel is a graduate student in the Department of Economics.

Saint Mary's to finish Fall Foray with luau 
BETH KESSLER accent writer 
To complete a week of activi­ties labeled the Fall Foray, Saint Mary's has planned a joint ND­SMC luau. The event will take place on Friday, September 7, from 8:30p.m. to 11:00 p.m. on the steps of Haggar Hall at Saint Mary's. 
In the Hawaiian spirit leis will be given away, and food with a Hawaiian flare will be served. The area will be lit by torches, which will not only provide an appropriate setting, but should help deter the mosquitoes. 
The main emphasis of the evening will be on dancing to the music of the Generics. In­cluded in the activities will be a limbo contest. 
Organized by Amy Halstead and Wendy Kemp, heads of Special Cultural Activities for the Student Activities Board of SMC, the idea for this event came to them last spring .. Hal­stead said they felt there was a lack of non-date dances on the ND and SMC campuses. She and Kemp wanted to provide a fun way for people to get to­gether, dance and socialize, without the necessity of having a date. 

The theme of a Hawaiian luau added an interesting twist. By having it early in the year it will allow freshmen to get involved, transfers to meet people, and upperclassmen to reacquaint themselves with fellow stu­dents. 

Halstead described the luau as a "pre-party," suggesting that it would be a good place to start Friday evening before moving on to a more private party. 
'The area will be lit by torches, which will not only provide an appropriate setting, but should help deter the mosquitoes. ' 
The luau is sponsored by the Student Activities Board of Saint Mary's and is open to all Notre Dame and Saint Mary's students. Halstead is optimistic about a good turnout and extends an invitation to all those who are interested in dancing under the starry skies of Indiana, and maybe allowing the imagination to wander a lit­tle into more tropical climes. 
Settimi's comedy-mime-roller skating show comes to Theodore's 
The Spirit of Notre Dame 

To rise stronger than ever after defeat: To be gracious and proud, though we've been beat; To savor a win with laughter and with whoops, Yet, extending a hand to opposing troops; To never forget, 'fore or after the game. This is part ofthe Spirit of ol' Notre Dame. 
But it's more than nice guys in vict'ry and loss; Or 'membrance of grotto, dome, spire, and lakes' moss. It's giving to each hour that certain plus: Sixty full minutes of the best in us. It's the will to excel in all that we dare, For Him and for her, whose children we are. It's a force and a drive impelling us choose Good over evil, though we seemingly lose. 
It's a spark-aftre!-passed on and on' By Notre Dame men, by father and son. 
Oh, it's wond'rous and awesome, this fire and this force; 
This Spirit that inspires us, this eternal resource. So cherish it dearly, more precious than gold, And when dark hours gather, we'll turn up the flame Of the glorious Spirit of ol' Notre Dame! 
Editor's Note: This was written by Paul A. Fzsher. a 1943 graduate ofNotre Dame, and sent to Ara Parsegian six days after ND lost to USC. 
Special to the Observer 
The Entertainer of the Year is on his way to Notre Dame? 
No, this is not a joke. Tim Settimi will appear on Friday, September 7, at 8:00 p.m. in Theodore's. 
Settimi, voted 1989 Perform­ing Artist of the Year during the "Campus Entertainer of the Year" presenti'.tion of the Na­tional Associatwn for Campus Activities, has performed his one man show "I'm OK-An Evening with Tim Settimi" for over 1000 colleges and univer­sities. 
Having appeared in concert with such diverse performers as Gloria Estefan and the Miami Sound Machine, Doc Sev­erinson, Steve Martin, Willie Nelson, and Kenny Loggins, Settimi would be entertaining for almost any audience. 
Settimi began his live perfor­mance career as a street per­fonner, appearing in such cities as Boston, Toronto, New York, Montreal and his native Chicago. 
A current resident of Atlanta, Settimi's talents have translated well to television and movies, with appearances on "Comedy Tonight," Showtime's "Atlanta Laff-Otr' and in the feature film "The Prize Fighter" with Tim Conway. 
Settimi's current show com­bines mime, comedy, original music, memorable characters and athletic pratfall roller skating that delights all. 
New work in progress for the most honored artist in the Na­tional Association for Campus Activities is a collection of the­atrical interpretations of origi­nal music. The show, tenta­tively titled "Behind Bars," is a live music video, weaving a narrative through eight songs. 
To see more of this talented performer, be sure to catch his act at Theodore's Friday at 8:00 p.m.

McEnroe, Sampras win Open matches
TV 
continued from page 16 
they thought was a five-year, $350 million agreement with the CFA that included Notre Dame. CBS, meanwhile, couldn't offer enough money to broadcast Elkhart High School games, let alone the CFA. 
Both ABC and CBS became aware of the contract after NBC approached Notre Dame. Hence, that eliminated any fo­rum for bidding. And with the intense bidding wars that the networks are waging for sports rights these days, who knows how big the Notre Dame price tag could have been? 
ABC, when it realized Notre Dame would not be a part of the CFA package, devalued its entire five-year deal by an esti­mated $50 million, with the CFA teams losing $30 million. (The remaining $20 million would have gone directly to Notre Dame). 
So, essentially, ABC's $50 million cutback translates into what the network believes is Notre Dame's worth to college football. That's some $12 mil­lion more than what NBC says Notre Dame football is worth. 
Hmmm. Just imagine if ABC and CBS joined NBC in the bar­gaining talks last February and were asked to start the bidding on Irish football. There's not an auctioneer in the country
. 
The Observer 

who could have kept pace. 
f\ 

bidding war could have shat­tered the reported $38 million offer sheet. 
The obvious question arises: 
Why didn't Notre Dame go for 
. the whole enchilada by selling 
itself to the entire market? 
"That's not the way we func­tion," says Beauchamp, who was unfairly cast as the bad guy in this entire soap opera. "NBC came to us and said we'll broadcast these games for this many years and this much money. Now CBS didn't ap­proach us. We are not inter­ested in getting into a bidding war. We felt it presented ethical problems." 
-So ABC and CBS still cry foul. Members of CFA are aghast at the unbelievable wealth that the 
contract will generate for one school. And the University of Kansas announced it won't play a two-game ba'sketball series with the Irish. (Boy, there go our winter weekends). 
But these people haven't con­sidered how much Notre Dame could have made if it didn't go along with a silent, one-to-one agreement with NBC. They also fail to recognize that Notre Dame could have made similar contracts in the past. 
Says Don Criqui, an Irish alum who ironically may call the games for NBC: "Notre Dame could've opened a con­tract similar to this 2S years ago and could've accrued up to $250 million by now. But the university went along as a team player. It stuck by the C:FA and NCAA." 
Forget what could have been. Imagine what it could be after the NBC contract expires. 
Let the bidding begin. 
NEW YORK (AP) -John McEnroe, leaping improbably into the U.S. Open semifinals, toyed with the biggest of the new breed of power hitters, and Ivan Lendl faded against a teen he taught too well. 
McEnroe, 31, played like the master of old in a 6-1, 6-4, 6-4 victory Wedensday night over David Wheaton, a 21-year-old giant with a blazing serve and nothing else that could match the talents of the four-time champion. 
McEnroe treated Wheaton as if he were a beginner, teasing him with drop-shot volleys, passing him easily, returning thundering serves with a flick of the wrist. 
The unseeded McEnroe, who hadn't reached the semifinals here since he was runnerup in 1985, will next take on Pete Sampras, a 19-year-old who serves as hard as Wheaton but also has many of the touch shots and ground strokes that have been McEnroe's trade­mark. 
McEnroe's sweeping serve kept Wheaton off balance, sometimes reaching far out of the court, most of the night, and his brilliant passing shots and volleys intimidated the 6­foot-4 Wheaton. 
"He hit some pretty good shots at the beginning and scared me away from the net," Wheaton said. 
Sampras, touted as one of the best young American power hit­ters in tennis, blasted 24 aces and 27 service winners at up to 120 mph and broke through to the top rank with a 6-4, 7-6 (7­4), 3-6, 4-6, 6-2 victory over Lendl, a three-time champion. 
Sampras, battered so badly in the third and fourth sets that pigeons seemed to circle over him like buzzards, refused to give up in the final set. He charged back with all the youthful strength he possessed to reach the semifinals of a Grand Slam tournament for the first time. 
The slim, slope-shouldered 19-year-old from Rancho Palos Verdes, Calif., stopped making the backhand errors that plagued him in the sets Lendl won, and poured on the heat on 
his serve to end Lendl's streak 

of eight straight appearances 
in the finals. Lendl was tied for 
the record with Bill Tilden, who 
reached the finals every year 
from 1918-1925. 
Lendl, a physical fitness buff who is among the best five-set players in tennis, could take some pride in helping Sampras rise to the top echelon of the game. They practiced together for 10 days at Lendl's house in Greenwich, Conn., a couple of years ago and Lendl gave the youngster crucial tips. 
"He had me biking 15 or 20 miles a day," said Sampras, who also got some ideas on diet and match preparation. "We talked a lot and he told me how you have to work to make it. He's a true professional in ev­ery sense of the word. 
"It was ironic. I was thinking about it during the match be­cause he told me you have to train so hard that you can't walk home. I felt just as fit as he did out there." 
"I don't believe what's hap­pening now. It's a dream come true," Sampras said after the 4-hour, 5-minute match. "This is what I've been working for all summer. This is the reward right now."

ND welcomes Weekend of Champions 
By KEN TYSIAC 

Associate Sports Editor 
Yesterday Notre Dame offi­cials announced the completion of a schedule for the October 4­7 Weekend of Champions, which will give several Irish sports teams an opportunity to showcase their skills against top competition. 
Highlights of the weekend will include appearances by the Olympic gold medalist Janet Evans and the Stanford men's and women's swim teams, the Wichita State baseball team which won the College World Series in 1989 and the Stanford men's and women's tennis teams, which have won nine out of a possible ten NCAA titles in the past five years. 
Also scheduled for the week­end are the Irish Soccer Classic and the Golden Dome Volleyball Classic. Ohio State, Creighton and Western Michigan will participate in the soccer tour­nament, while LSU, Oklahoma and Hofstra will compete in the volleyball tourney. And last, but not least, the Irish football squad will host Stanford. 
"All in all, if you enjoy sports and enjoy the opportunity to see amateur sports at its best, collegiate sports at its best, you will be getting a special treat on this weekend," Notre Dame Athletic Director Dick Rosenthal said. 
Mayor Joe Kernan, a former Irish baseball player, also voiced his enthusiasm for the upcoming collegiate sports ex­travaganza. 
"I think what we have seen over the past few years is a re­turn to excellence in all of the (Irish athletic) programs," Kernan said. "I hope that not only the student body and some of the people who are in for the football game and the Notre Dame family, but also parts of the greater community will be able to participate as well." 
Evans, who won three indi­vidual NCAA titles in 1990 and is a world record holder, will lead the Stanford men's and women's swimming teams against the Irish at 4 p.m. on Friday, October 5 at the Rolfs Aquatic Center. The Stanford men's team finished third in the NCAAs in 1990 and won three national championships in the 1980s. 
Irish baseball Coach Pat Murphy will try to find a way to defeat Wichita State in games on October 4 and 5 at Coveleski Stadium. The Shockers have a pitcher named Tyler Green who is one of the most sought-after prospects in the country. Murphy's squad also has a pretty talented pitcher in sophomore David Sinnes, who led Division I hurlers with a

played in a collegiate football game, but that hasn't stopped predictors from including him in the elite inner circle of pre­season All-America picks.

the 1987 season for academic reasons. And don't even worry about the fact that Notre Dame has never had a Butkus award winner. 
Just remember the success he had in the 1988 national cham­pionship season. 
Stonebreaker, playing inside linebacker at the "eagle" posi­tion, spent more time on the field than any other linebacker. He ranked second on the team in tackles (1 04), including a 17­tackle performance vs. Michigan State and a 16-tackle effort vs. Michigan. He finished third in the Butkus balloting in 1988 behind Derrick Thomas of Alabama and Broderick Thomas of Nebraska. 
In 1989 Stonebreaker was forced to sit out the season due to circumstances resulting from a February 1989 automo­bile accident. Despite having to come back from a drastic hip injury and having not played in more than a year, he is a fron­trunner for the top national honor for linebackers. 
··u's something that's good that after having to sit out with my problems, shows that after hours and months of rehabili­tation, I can come out and get back to form, said the 6-1, 228­pound Stonebreaker. "It's also something that, if the defense plays well, then the defensive accolades are going to come." 
Defensive accolades started brewing in the 1990 spring football practice when Stonebreaker earned defensive MVP honors after making six tackles in the Blue-Gold game. 
"I don't know if there's any great attention for this award," said Stonebreaker. "It's just the kind of thing where they'll vote on it after the season. It's not

Switzer takes to the road to promote his dirty laundry 
Last week, former Oklahoma football coach Barry Switzer voiced his con­cern for the integrity of colle­giate athletics by charging unidentified Notre Dame rep­resentatives with offering 
Tony Brooks "illegal induce-
Frank Pastor 
ments" in violation of NCAA recruiting rules in his autobi-Football Notebook 
ography, "Bootlegger's Boy". . . This week, Switzer departs on a multi-City speak­ing tour to promote his new book and, presumably, air more dirty laundry. , 
But before he decides to become college football s collective conscience, perhaps Switzer should step back for a moment and consider the deep impres­sion he has left on the Oklahoma football program. 
Since tendering his resignation as head coach of the Sooners on June 19, 1989 amidst allegations from Oklahoma administrators that he had gambled on college football, fixed drug tests and permitted the use of cocaine on his team, Switzer has spent the past year rationalizing his actions and trying to 

convince the rest of the country that. things at 
Oklahoma  weren't  as  bad  as  they might  have  
seemed.  
So, in  a  last-ditch attempt to  deflect attention  

from the Oklahoma football program, Switzer de­cided to write a book and make some allegations of his own. 
The object of his accusations is Brooks, not sur­prising considering that many consider Switze.r:s failure to land the Tulsa star in 1987 and the cnti­cism from boosters that followed as major factors in his decision to leave the university. 
It also is not surprising considering Brooks's on­again, off-again status at Notre Dame. J.ust w?en Brooks thought his troubles were behmd h1m, Switzer points to his recruitment as an example of everything that is wrong with college football. 
Switzer claimed knowledge of the "apparent" vio­lation in 1987, but chose not to inform the NCAA because he feared alienating a major Tulsa contrib­utor who happened to be a Notre Dame graduate. 
Oddly enough, Switzer concluded his tirade against Notre Dame with a pronouncement about the "pressure placed upon college administrators 
because of the constant need for money and the im­
pact that it has upon athletics." 
Switzer spent Tuesday fielding questions from re­
porters concerning his recent admission to The 
National that he knew some Sooners players were 
taking steroids during his time there and failed to 
confront them about the problem. 
Answering the reporters' queries with anything but the class and dignity with which Notre Dame head coach Lou Holtz has responded to his accusers in recent weeks, Switzer sounded downright of­fended by the whole matter. 
"Taking steroids?" Switzer said. "Everybody's 
taking them. Oklahoma, Nebraska, for years did it. 
No one thought anything about it. 
"It had been going on for years and no one cared because no one was getting hurt. You're not robbing 7 -Elevens, you're not murdering someone to get steroids." 
Apparently the events of the past few years have numbed Switzer to the effects of a simple NCAA in­fraction.

INSIDE COLUMN 

Shedding light on the topic of parking 
Question: What gives off the most light in the D2 park­ing lot? 
Answer: A full moon. Until the adminis­tration decidfs to put 


in some more :ights in Robyn Simmons D2, it looks like the man on the moon will Asst. Accent Editor be the only person watching over the students who have to walk through the poorly lit parking lot at night. 
For those people who might not be famil­iar with this particular parking lot, D2 has lights set up around the perimeter of the lot, but there isn't any sufficient lighting in the center of the lot--where all of the cars are parked. 
The parking lot is so dark that it is diffi­cult for students to even find their car, and spending 15 minutes wandering around a dark parking lot is equivalent to someone wearing a big sign on their chest saying, "Rob Me." 
As a result, anybody who needs to use their car at night would be risking their safety by walking there alone, and even if they did have one or two friends accompa­nying them, there are still plenty of hiding places for a band of attackers to lie in wait for unsuspecting students. 
The solution is simple: get more lights in D2. The more lights there are, the less hid­ing places there are for thieves and as­sailants, and the safer the students will be. Adding a few more security guards wouldn't hurt either. 
The University's Safewalk program is a step in the right direction towards increas­ing student safety, but the parking lots are so dark at night that I doubt even the bravest safewalkers would want to trot through D2. Students shouldn't have to add a can of mace to their keychains because the administration doesn't feel like adding a few more lights in the lots. 
Something tells me that this University has enough money to afford to put up more lights in all of the campus parking lots. As the number of on-and off-campus attacks escalates, the administration should become increasingly aware of the problem of poorly lit parking lots and do something to rectify that situation. 
The problem of insufficient lighting in the parking lots has gone on for an inexcusably long time. What has to happen before the administration decides to do something about this serious safety problem? I cer­tainly hope it doesn't take another attack in the parking lot to get the administration to do something that should have been done a long time ago. 
This University needs to "lighten up" in more ways than one.

Drug lord can be extradited despite new policy 
BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) ­Despite the government's offer to stop extraditing drug king­pins, Colombia's senior cocaine kingpin still would be sent to the United States for trial, a top government official said Thursday. 
Pablo Escobar, head of the Medellin cocaine cartel, would be sent to the United States un­less he turns himself in and confesses all his crimes, said the official, who is involved in policy and decision-making. He spoke to reporters on condition of anonymity. 
The Bush administration cau­tiously endorsed the new policy. "If the government and people of Colombia are now able to enforce their own laws against drug trafficking -prosecuting, convicting, and incarcerating 
these thugs-so much the bet­ter," Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said in a statement from Washington. 
But he warned that "if the so-called extraditables fail to take advantage of this opportunity to surrender ... we will continue to support Colombia's effort to arrest and extradite them to the United States for trial." 
President Cesar Gaviria modi­fled a year-old policy by an­nouncing Wednesday that co­caine traffickers who surrender to Colombian authorities will not be extradited to the United States. 
Gaviria said the decision, which came in the form of an official decree, applies to those who surrender, not those cap­tured by police. 
"If Escobar were captured to­day, he would be extradited," said the official who spoke Thursday. 

He said Colombia would not allow the new measure to be­come a "joke" in which major drug criminals confess only mi­nor crimes to avoid extradition. 
"If Pablo Escobar surren­dered but failed to confess all of his crimes, he would run the risk of being extradited," he added. 
The government hopes to con­vince medium-and lower-level drug smugglers to surrender and cooperate with authorities, he said. 
Officials blame the Medellin cartel, which Escobar leads, for killing about 500 Colombians the past year, including three presidential candidates. 
Thousands of others have died in fighting between rival drug gangs and violence by right-wing death squads financed by drug traffickers. 
During the past year, the Medellin cartel has been de­manding an end to extradition, the fate it fears most. 
In repeated statements, drug traffickers have offered to turn themselves in to Colombian judges, in an apparent attempt to persuade the government to end extraditions. 
The Medellin cartel in July de­dared a unilateral cease-fire in its terrorist attacks, apparently hoping the new administration would end extraditions. Gaviria was inaugurated Aug. 7. 
The official said it was neces­sary to show the Colombian people that the president is seeking solutions based on the country's own justice system. 
Total reliance on foreign courts saps people's confidence in Colombia's institutions, he added. 
Gaviria's predecessor, Virgilio Barco, undertook extraditions to the United States a year ago, after drug traffickers declared war on the state. 
Extraditions are controversial in Colombia because many peo­ple believe sending citizens to face trial abroad is an insult to national pride. 
However, Colombia's justice system has so far failed to keep any major trafficker in jail. Drug lords often bribe or threaten officials into letting them go free.

CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS 
Bush will appear on Iraqi TV, but on own terms, spokesman says 
TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) ­President Bush will accept Saddam Hussein's offer to broadcast a message to Iraq, but . only on his own terms, Bush's spokesman said Thursday. The president will make a tape in lieu of an inter­view with an Iraqi TV crew. 
"It's a real opportunity," Bush said of Saddam's offer to televise the U.S. leader's com­ments. Bush's spokesman said the president had "a very dis­tinct message" to give the Iraqi people about American reasons for the massive military buildup in the Persian Gulf. 
Iraqi Ambassador Mohamed al-Mashat said in Washington that "of course" Iraqi TV would air Bush's message "in its entirety without editing. Here you edit, in Iraq we do not edit." 
Spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Bush's address would be eight to 10 minutes long. 
"We will have a whole pack­age for broadcast on Iraqi tele­vision, and then we'll have a State Department interpreter who will provide the interpreta­tion some way" into Arabic, Fitzwater said, adding that the tape will be released generally. 
On another topic, looking ahead to this weekend's super­power summit, Bush said he will use the meeting not only to discuss the Persian Gulf with Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev but to press for a quick resolution to strategic arms talks. 

Before embarking on a one­day political trip to Kansas and Florida on Thursday, Bush spoke by telephone with a num­ber of world leaders on the gulf situation and his upcoming meeting with Gorbachev. They included Syrian President Hafez al-Assad, Turkish President Turgut Ozal, French President Francois Mitterrand and West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, the White House said. 
He also called United Nations Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar to thank him for his unsuccessful try at resolving the gulf crisis in talks last week in Iraq. 
Bush also met Thursday with Israel's visiting foreign minis­ter, David Levy, in Washington. 
Naji al-Hadithi, director gen­eral of Iraq's Information Ministry, said in Baghdad that an Iraqi television crew was ready to go to Washington to interview Bush for a broadcast on state-run television. 
Fitzwater said that wouldn't be necessary-"we'll produce it ourselves." 
"Although we have not heard from Iraq directly, we accept their offer of a broadcast to the Iraqi people. The president will tape a message to the Iraqi people in the next few days which will be provided to the Iraqi information minister," Fitzwater told reporters ac­companying Bush on Air Force 
One. 
Bush has said he wished he could have the media access in Iraq that Saddam has had on 
U.S. television. The Iraqi presi­dent's statements and appear­ances have been broadcast widely, many of them on live and unedited CNN reports. 
"The president has a very dis­tinct message that he wants to give to the people of Iraq about our purpose for being in the gulf. He thinks this is a good opportunity," Fitzwater said. 
On a separate matter, Fitzwater said that there is no new economic package for the Soviet Union in the offering, although the Sunday summit meeting in Helsinki will offer a chance to talk about "technical assistance."

Special to the Observer 
"Psaltery," a collection of li­
turgical music by Steven 
Warner, associate director of 
the University of Notre Dame's 
Office of Campus Ministry, has 
been recently published by GIA 
Publications of Chicago. 
The collection includes ten re­sponsorial psalm settings for keyboard, guitar, harp, vocal soloist and four-part choir. The music was written by Warner for Sunday Masses at Notre Dame. 
A combination of two genres 
of sacred music designed for 
use by liturgical assemblies 
with either organ or guitar as 
the leading instrument, 
"Psaltery," according to 
Warner, "seeks to bring to­
gether contemporary liturgical 
music, by way of its lyricism 
and expressiveness on the gui­
tar, with traditional chant 
styles, with its free-flowing 
sense of rhythm and modal 
progressions." 
Some of the material in the collection have been approved for inclusion in the "Canadian Book of Worship," the hymnal used by most Catholics in Canada. 
Warner has worked in the University's Campus Ministry office since 1979, when he be­gan work on a master of arts degree in liturgical studies at Notre Dame. Among the musi­cal instruments with which he is proficient are the guitar and the Irish harp. 
Warner is director of the Notre Dame Folk Choir, which regularly leads the music at the 
11:45 a.m. Sunday Mass at Sacred Heart Church. He has taken the choir on two interna­tional tours, both to the Republic of Ireland, in 1988 and 1990. 
For the last two year, he has managed Campus Ministry's li­turgical celebration of the Feast of Saint Patrick, using music written in collaboration with with parishes and litunti­
cal centers in Ireland and di­recting the Folk Choir in a recording of the Mass. 

sider another request for bond reduction and wanted to hear medical testimony about Humphrey's mental condition. 
RU!!,SO did not comment after"\ard on whether he would seek another hearing. He said he was preparing for the trial on the aggravated assault charge, tentatively scheduled for Odober. 
Humphrey's grandmother testified she didn't want to press charges and would wel­come Humphrey back into her home, where Humphrey's mother also lives, in Indialantic, 180 miles from Gainesville. 
"I want it dropped ... defi­nitely," Elna Hlavaty, her right cheek and right eye badly bruised, said as Humphrey watched. 
She said she didn't fear her grandson, although she had called police repeatedly. 
She said she couldn't remem­her anything about the night of the incident other than that she hurt her right side when she fell on a concrete floor. The 79­year-old Hlavaty protested she was old and ill and couldn't an­swer any more questions from prosecutors. 
Sheriff's Deputy Douglas Hammack testified she told him the night of the arrest that she feared Humphrey would beat her again. Humphrey started banging his head against his patrol car when Hammack put him inside, the deputy testified. 
Hammack said he had gone to the grandmother's home five or six times on disturbance complaints and was told Humphrey was refusing to take 
medicine to control mood swings. 
He testified on one visit he had Humphrey remove a knife from the front seat of his car and lock it in the trunk. 
Besides Humphrey's apart­ment, detectives searched his grandmother's home and his black Cadillac. Authorities said the grandmother's home was unoccupied during the search because the family was at the hearing. 
George Humphrey, a University of Florida senior, charged that his younger brother is being made a scape­goat and that the press is sen­sationalizing the killings. 
"Ed didn't do it, Ed didn't do it. He's not capable of it," Humphrey told reporters in Sharpes.

Prepping for rugby 
The Observer /David Short 

Although rugby does not have the status that football does on this campus, several interh~ll teams have sprung up around campus for this interesting game including these players shown stretchmg out. 
Special to the Observer 
"Bruce Bobick: Beans, Quilts, Chance and Determinism," a one-man show featuring quilts and quilt paintings, will open at the Suite Museum of Art Sept. 9 (Sunday) and will continue through October 21. 
Bobick received his master of fine arts degree from Notre Dame in 1958. He is professor and chairman of the de­partment of art at West Georgia College, Carrollton, Ga. 
The quilt series grew out of Bobick's interest in the workings of the subconscious and Louis Pasteur's words, "Chance favors the prepared mind." The exhibit explores "the opposing concepts of de­terminism and free will," Bobick said. 
"In studying history, one becomes aware of the sup­posedly random flukes of luck that have resulted in famous discoveries or inventions, and by knowing that the subcon­scious mind is active during sleep," he said, "I thought it appropriate to do a series of quilts made by grandmothers of famous individuals. The im­ages on the quilts permeated the subconscious of the sleeping children night after night and led directly to the famous discovery, invention, or work of 
art." 
Bobick will be present at the opening of his exhibition and will speak about his "use of beans as a metaphor for the human condition." 
Museum hours are 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. Thursday (when classes are in session). The museum is closed Monday and all major holidays. Admission is free.

The stage was set for the re­opening when barricades at Kahnawake came down last week after an agreement was reached between the army and Mohawks. 
But in Kahnesatake -where the Mohawk deadlock began over a land dispute -soldiers spent Wednesday firming up their positions around the last Warrior stronghold. 
The deadlock at Oka began when provincial police stormed a barricade the Mohawks erected to stop the town's plans to expand the local golf course, saying the property in question was part of their ancestral land.

Two fashionably dressed Soviet women taste American pizzas at the first ever Pizza Hut in the USSR Wednesday. The restaurant in undergoing a week of trial and is to be officially opened next week. 
NASA will make next try at launch mid-Sept 
CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -NASA said Thursday it will replace the fuel pump that likely caused its latest failure to get astronauts back in space and try again in mid-September to launch Columbia. 
NASA Administrator Richard Truly said a new pump will be installed this weekend. If that seems to correct the problem, a fourth launch attempt will be made to launch the shuttle with an astronomical observatory early in the week of Sept. 17. 
"It's not a 100 percent guar­antee. But it's the one shot we have to get the Astro mission airborne" before Discovery's scheduled flight with the Ulysses satellite in October, Truly said. 
The unit is bolted in and can be replaced easily, said launch director Bob Sieck. Crews can­not enter the compartment until Friday because propel­lants remain aboard, prevent­ing a new pump from being in­stalled until Saturday. 
On Wednesday, NASA called off its third attempt to send Columbia on a mission to study some of the hottest objects in the universe with the $150 mil­lion Astro observatory. Thursday's early morning launch was scrubbed after hy­drogen flooded into the rear compartment. 
Officials continued filling Columbia's massive external tank to pinpoint the source and narrowed their search to the shuttle's three recirculation pumps. 
Each of the shuttle's three main engines has a pump. 
Officials were uncertain which one might be leaking or whether there were other holes. 

The pumps are part of the plumbing in the rear of the shuttle, where pipes range in diameter up to 17 inches. They are directly in front of the huge engines and are accessible through side doors. 
"We're not talking about a large leak. We're talking about an extremely small leak," said Forrest McCartney, director of Kennedy Space Center. "It's very elusive and very frustrat­ing." 
"It is a real booger to try to find and isolate," shuttle boss Robert Crippen said. 
If a new pump does not cor­rect Columbia's leaks or the launch is delayed too long, the mission will wait until after Discovery's flight with Ulysses, a satellite being sent on a five­year journey to explore the sun's polar regions. Discovery must lift off between Oct. 5 to Oct. 23 to take advantage of the proper planet alignment. 
"Ulysses is our first priority and we will not compromise that," said William Lenoir, head of NASA's space. flight program. 
Columbia's seven astronauts left for their training base in Houston at dawn. 
The mood at the space center was one of disappointment mixed with relief. 

"My first reaction was frus­tration," said program scientist Ed Weiler. "But my next thought was, 'My God, I'm glad they stopped, some of my friends are aboard.' "

Lasting friendships start with Best Buddies program 
By Cecelia Burger 
Mary is a friend of mine. 
There are many things I can tell you about her. For instance, she is a black female in her early thirties. She lives and works in the community. She likes movies and music. She likes to get books to read from the library. And she is especially fond of Pizza Hut pizza, Kentucky Fried Chicken and strawberry ice cream. Mary is friendly but quiet when you first meet her. When she warms up, however, her p·ersonality makes her impossible to resist. Obviously, Mary is a very special person to those who know her. But there is something about Mary which a description of her would be incomplete without; Mary is severely retarded and handicapped. 
Mary and I were paired together through Best Buddies, a program sponsored by the Kennedy Foundation which works through Logan Center. Upon seeing her for the first time, it was apparent that she is disabled. After getting to know her, it was quite enlightening (and surprising) to realize that she is also very able. This occurred the moment I stopped looking at the handicap and began to look at the person beyond the handicap. Some would say that Mary is special, and I agree wholeheartedly. But Mary is not special in my eyes because she mentally retarded or handicapped, but because of the feeling of friendship and caring which has grown betweun us. 
Our relationship has been one of fairly rapid development. In the beginning when I would go to see Mary, I would have to initiate all of the conversation. 
DOONESBURY 

other visits. Obviously, she was getting to know me pretty well. 
After that, I wanted to get around the problem of her viewing all my actions as favors to her, (she thanked me for everything, not realizing that I wanted to see her and do things with her). I also wanted her to start caHing me if she wanted to see me. I found that the best way to let her know these things was just to come out and say them. It was amazing how well that worked. I was extremely aware of the rare honesty and openness that was so prominent in our developing relationship. 
After that "stage," Mary became even more interactive, asking me things, remembering things we had conversed about on previous visits and asking me about them (i.e. "How was your test?"), asking what I wanted to do, wanting to share with me (secrets as well as food), and calling me if I didn't call when I said I would. 
Mary's presence in my life has had an immense impact on my views of mental retardation, the handicapped, and even the basic meaning of the worri "friendship." At first, I d~d not know what to expect, and I was a little apprehensive about working with Mary; I had never had much contact with the Sometimes it was like a police interrogation. I had trouble getting responses, and I didn't know if I was talking "above her level of understanding," or perhaps she just found me boring. I feared that a normal pattern of authoritarian figure and dependant was quickly forming. I decided to stop asking so many questions. 
When Mary and I would go to the movies or some other place, we would ride in the car, listen to music and just enjoy one another. I asked one or two questions and then paused for a time, waiting for a response. Little by little, Mary became more comfortable with me and I with her. She stopped being so uncomfortable about asking me for help or telling me she couldn't do some things because of her handicap. I, in turn, felt more at ease with her handicap and asking about her abilities like the distance she could walk, if she could go up stairs, or if she took the bus to work by herself. I had been telling her some things about myself each visit. Then one day, about the fifth visit, Mary got into the car and, to my astonishment, began the conversation. Not only did she begin, she talked a good five minutes straight! She answered all the questions that I had asked her consistently on our mentally retarded. However, my relationship with Mary has dissolved many of the fears I had. 
My views of challenges, and of people in general, have also been influenced. Mary faces challenges and difficulties in daily life and survival. So much of what is automatic for me presents problems for her. She really has accomplished a tremendous amount. She has worked hard and deserves dignity and respect like anyone else. Instead, she lives in a world where many look down on her and patronize her, focusing on what she can't do rather than what she ran. 
I have also learned about the value of people. So many things about Mary are innate in the human condition. She feels both pain and pleasure, satisfaction and dissatisfaction, approval and disgust. She has ideas and opinions. She laughs and cries and gets angry. She experiences fear and doubt, but she also has her own little successes just like everyone else. Most importantly, she loves and accepts, and desires love and acceptance. 
Mary is mentally retarded. She is also handicapped. She doesn't fit into what most of society may classify as normal. She has limits. But beyond all the labels and stereotypes is a learning. loving, breathing individual who has as much human value as anyone does, and she wants very much what other non-handicapped people want out of their lives. Her intelligence and abilities are limited in some respects, but that is part of Mary; they are only two factors that shape her as an individual. 
Part of friendship is accepting the limits of your friends and cherishing the parts which are truly beautiful and valuable. Yes, Mary is my friend, she is special, and she has taught me the true meaning of friendship. 
I think the Friendship Program is an excellent idea which benefits both participants. The mentally retarded person gets a chance to be socialized, integrated, and experience some normalization of activities with non­handicapped people. The non­handicapped person gets the chance to work with a mentally retarded person and develop a relationship, realizing that such people are not really different in the aspects of human value which really matter.

The last three letters in WAOR stand for Adult Oriented Rock, but the station attracts its listeners from diverse age groups. The latest statistics show that music lovers from 12 to 54 are loyally tuned to 95.3 
FM. 
Tom Reed, a part-time disc jockey for the station, says that this loyal audience catapulted the station into the number one ratings spot for local radio stations in the spring of 1990. This is the first time in WAOR's

n this day and age people are looking for variety in their lis­tening experience. Along with a desire to please, popular demand and competitive forces are two factors that drive Mishawaka's ZIP 104 radio station to fulfill these expectations of its listeners. 
Disk Jockey Steve O'Brien, 
who is the current music direc­
tor, believes that it is important 
to "keep in touch with what is 
going on in the listener's mind." 
O'Brien says ZIP 104 relies on 
the basic format of CHR 
(Contemporary Hit Radio) to 
satisfy its "selective audience," 
which is concentrated between 
the 18 to 34 age group, or as 
O'Brien puts it, "the post-baby­
boomers." 
ZIP 104 's song list would be 
best described as a Top 40 
conglomeration, attracting the 
teenager, young adult, and the 
average married couple under 
36. 
Contest give-aways center 
around the radio's main prod­
uct-music. One such contest 13 year history that they have topped the charts. 

Reed believes a wide variety of music equals success. "We try to go from real classics, late 1960s and early 1970s, to the more recent rock. But even our current stuff has to fit the rock and roll style," he says. 
Special promotions also cater to the different audiences. The older crowd, primarily day listeners, hear OJ Billy Dee's "Rock and Soul Cafe" in the lunch hour. Reed says that caller requests during this weekday program "range from Motown to traditional rock." 
Contests geared toward the younger crowd promote new artists by offering free COs to certain callers. Occasionally, a bar that advertises on WAOR will donate tickets to

give-away is.tbe free music weekend, during which time COs, cassettes, and stereos are given away. Another popular prize give-away is the Club Card Promo, which gives those listeners possessing a Club Card a chance to win prizes valued at $250 if their number is called over the radio. 
Although promos and con­tests are common among most radio stations, O'Brien stresses that there "is a difference" be­tween ZIP 104 and other radio stations. In order to attract more listeners and retain pre­sent ones, O'Brien says "It is important to build a better product." ZIP 104 accomplishes this task through a "consistent product," says O'Brien, who compares the station's success to that of a Me Donalds. "When you get a cheeseburger at Me Donalds, you know it will be the events for the station to gi 
away. 

"Block Party Weekends" new station program that three songs in a row by the same artists. According to Reed, this has significantly "boosted the reputation of station."

By combining great rock roll with a unique personal touch, WAOR has apparently found a good formula for cess.

O'Brien says that there to be "a lot of hype" about ranking of radio stations. It not the aim of ZIP 104 to get .every listener out there, but rather to focus on the its selective audience. 
Some of f1e ways ZIP 104 complishes the task of in touch with its audience is through surveys and live broadcasts. 
O'Brien describes the obje tive of this radio station as "serving, entertaining, and i forming its listeners." 
One advantage of this servi is advertising at an affordab rate. "Radio can reach a tho sand people cheaper that an other form of media," says O'Brien. That advantage is p of what ZIP 104 is all about.

U 
93 is no longer a Top 40 station. 
Before the 
fans of Mark 

Durocher, Nicky 93, and the like ru. 'h to change their dials to another station that plays the hot hits of today, it must be made clear that U93 has not changed its format, simply the title of the format. 
"Top 40" has become passe in radio circles; the correct name is contemporary hit radio, or CHR, according to Jack Swart, the Radio Manager of WNDU 93. 
The station is currently enjoy­ing a run as the top-rated radio station in the overall area as well as in several key demo­graphic groups. Arbitron, the ratings system U93 subscribes to, rates them number one in the 18-49 age group, with a 
17.7 share of the audience, and also number one in the 18-34 group with a 19.5 share. 
These numbers are based on the average percentage of lis­teners tuned in to U93 during the hours of 6 a.m. to midnight, seven days a week. Swart says there are a number of rea­sons the station is so successful. 
First among these is the i.ype of music the station plays. The playlist is selected by the pro­gram and music directors, who are influenced by requests from listeners and from sales in local record stores. The biggest hits are placed on the playlist in heavy rotation for a period of 12 to 13 weeks, at which time their rotation is diminished. A song is taken off the playlist anytime from one to one and a half years after its first ap­pearance. 
Because of th~ various tastes of its listeners, the station plays various styles of pop, including soul, hard rock, and rap, if it has crossover appeal. 
The popularity of certain disc jockeys also contributes to the 
station's success. According to U93's overall strategy, the more high profile, energetic DJs are featured during the morning and afternoon driving time. The morning show, headed by Durocher, also boasts a stable of popular characters in a comic format. 
Special programming on weekends includes Rick Dees' Weekly Top 40 on Saturday mornings, and America's Top 40 on Sunday mornings, as well as. Sunday evening's Hitline, a syndicated call-in show featur­ing various artists. 
Perhaps the main factor that leaves U93 fans glued to their stereos, however, is the exten­sive call-in giveaway program the station utilizes. Both inde­pendently and in conjunction wlith sponsors, U93 gives away South Bend Sox tickets, concert tickets, and restaurant gift cer­tificates, as well as larger prizes such as trips, stereo sys­tems, and merchants' giveaway packages. Recent promotions included the $10,000 Key Song and the Endless Summer fea­tures. 
WNDU is affiliated with the University and expresses this by following university policy on such things as the advertising it accepts for airplay. Swart says the station wishes to "reflect the same basic message as that of the University." The station promotes itself mostly through advertising on TV's Channel16, and through billboards in the area. 
As to the competition pro­vided them by similar stations such as ZIP 104, Swart replies that U93 was the first station of its format in this area, and that gives it an advantage over the others. He states that U93's flow of air talent is stronger and that they are in touch with the community better than any of their competition. 
With the air of one in com­mand of the situation, he says simply, "We just keep beating them."

Shortly before being killed in action in 1918, the English war hero Wilfred Owen finished an anti-war poem which was as truthful as a poem can be: "If you could hear, at every jolt, the blood/Come gargling from the froth-corrupted lungs/Obscene as cancer.../My friend, you would not tell with such high zestffo children ar­dent for some desperate glory/fhe old lie: Dulce et decorum est/Pre patria mori." 
The "old Lie" began with Homer, writing in the Illiad: "A glorious death is his/Who for his country falls. "Homer prob­ably didn't believe it was a lie, or he wouldn't have written it. Hemingway was so contemptu­ous of the "old Lie" that he tried to destroy the myth: "They wrote in the old days that it is sweet and fitting to die for one's country. But in modern war there is nothing sweet nor fitting in your dying. You will die like a dog for no good rea­son." 
Has Hemingway replaced one "old Lie" with another lie when he says, "You will die like a dog for no good reason"? Are you willing to believe that all the 
G.l. Joes who fell in battle on their way to liberating Hitler's death camps died in vain? What if the poet Yeats, who wrote "The Second Coming," turns out to be prophetic, as though he had foresight about the events now unfolding in the Persion Gulf. "Surely the Second Coming is a Hand/ ... somewhere in sands of the deserVA shape with lion body traordinary collection of talent, of human knowledge, that has ever been gathered together at the White House-with the pos­sible exception of when Thomas Jefferson dined alone." 
Nevertheless, O'Connor be­comes the Supreme Court jus­tice because that's the way the cookie must crumble in this age of women's lib. Jefferson, the genius, is left to mediate on Ecclesiastes: "The race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favor to men of skill; but time and chance happeneth to them all." 
A university committed to coeducation has to put its money where its mouth is in making the appointments that give minorities their place in the sun; frankly, the appoint­ments tend to be a breath of fresh air. It would be churlish for the goats in the talent pool to be a jealous of the sheep gathered at the right hand of the Father Almight. The Miltons, bucking for promotion, have no choice but to remain mute, glorious, and untenured; and the Cromwells, hoping to make heads roll as academic deans, stay guiltless of their colleagues' blood. 
Are there jobs in the groves of academe-like that of dragon-slayer or head football coach-that you must be a member of an inner circle-like the knights of the Round Table-to apply for? Indubitably. If the time came when men and women were equally eligible to serve as king or queen for a day, we could celebrate the "Year of Being Human," so we could all feel good about ourselves as people not conscious of each other as members of a minority group in need of stroking. I'll be joining a minority group of my own very soon: as a senior citizen I'll hear Time's winged chariot hurrying near. As a priest, I'm the member of a minority group that's considered spoiled. The truth is that today priests must stay on the defensive to keep their self-respect. 
I'm so happy to celebrate the "Year of Woman." I hope the time will not be taken up with pope-bashing. Women, I'm willing to agree, have a right to control their own bodies. That 
Has Hemingway replaced one "old Lie" with another lie when he says, "You will die like a dog for no good reason." 
doesn't mean they have a right to abort babies taking up space in their wombs like a house guest, for those innocents didn't invite themselves to life's feast. Is it sexist of me to say this? I'm ready and willing to be sensitive to any issue the women want me to be sensitive to, as long as it's "dulce et decorum est,' and not a lie. It's not only cowgirls who get the blues; when the bell tolls, it tolls for all of us. 
Letters to a Lonely God 
and the head of a man/A gaze blank and pitiless as the sun,/Is moving its slow thighs/while all about iVReel shadows of the indignant desert birds.!fhe darkness drops again; but now I know!fhat twenty centuries of stony sleep/Were vexed to nightmare by a rocking cra­dle/And what rough beast, its hour come round at lasVSlouches towards Bethlehem to be born?" 
If the scenario in the Middle­East is being written for Armageddon, should lads "ardent for some desperate glory" retire to a neutral corner, while the battles are being fought for the soul of mankind? Maybe there's a mid­dle ground between the "old Lie" that says it's sweet and proper to die for the father­land, and Hemingway's cyni­cism, "You will die like a dog for no reason." Christianity tells us that the greatest love one can possess is the act of laying down his live for his friend. Arlington Cemetery would be a national embar­rassment if we conclud that all the great sacrificies of the war dead were made "for no good reason." We should be able to agree among ourselves that war is hell without replacing "the old Lie" with Hemingway's half-truth. 


At Notre Dame, celebreating "Year of Women," we should be able to spend time dispelling the myth that men are superior without replacing it with an~ other myth. Eliot's Becket told us that the last temptation is the greatest treason: "to do the right deed for the wrong reason." We shouldn't be tempted to think that Notre Dame owes the ladies the "Year ofWomen", because "every year so far has been the year of men". Even in the real world, it isn't true to say that white males always have their back­sides in a tub of butter. The real truth is that in this genera­tion of emerging minorities, men are taking turns with the women in being the underdogs. 
How could it be otherwise? If the President decides that the politics of liberation mandate him to appoint a woman to the Supreme Court, Sandra Day O'Connor's stand-in will be nominated to fill the vacancy, even if Thomas Jefferson is waiting in the wings. Sandra Day O'Connor's stand-in may be an inspiried choice, gifted in doing her job well, and everyone will applaud the President's choice. Jefferson may be de­serving of President Kennedy's high praise at a dinner for the American Nobel Prize winners: "I think this is the most ex-

performance in the Buffaloes' 31-31 tie against Tennessee couldn't have helped his chances. Hagan is an option quarterback in the mold of Tony Rice and, for that reason, he won't be able to impress the Heisman voters with his pass­ing marks. 
Junior Ty Detmer of Brigham Young, USC sophomore Todd Marinovich and Miami senior Craig Erickson are the best of a strong contingent of quarter­backs vying for the award. Detmer is the finest passer in the group, but Marinovich and Erickson both play for high­profile programs which could garner them a few extra votes. 
The 1990 Heisman field lacks a solid running back candidate of the Barry Sanders variety, but Houston senior Chuck Weatherspoon, Pittsburgh ju­nior Curvin Richards and Fresno State senior Aaron 
Craver and Alabama senior Siran Stacy will make strong bids for the award. Tennessee sophomore Chuck Webb, a top preseason candidate, is out for the season after tearing the an­terior cruciate ligament in his right knee. 
Red Sox in flux over Clemens's shoulder injury 
BOSTON (AP) -Roger Clemens of the Boston Red Sox was reported "much more comfortable" Thursday as he underwent hospital tests for a painful right shoulder. 
Dr. Arthur Pappas, the Red Sox' team physician, said pain and swelling had "subsided significantly.'' 
"Those are encouraging signs and he's more comfortable, but that doesn't necessarily corre­late with what's happening in­
  
 

side his shoulder," Pappas said. 
Pappas, an orthopedic spe­cialist, said that while there are  "optimistic signs" he had to  wait until the results of tests  become known, probably on 
Friday.  
Clemens, who has a 20-6  record and leads the major leagues with a 1.98 earned run  average and 204 strikeouts,  underwent extensive tests at the University of Massachusetts  
Medical Center.  Clemens took had X-rays and a Magnetic Resonance Imaging  
procedure done.  
Pappas virtually ruled out any  rotator cuff trouble and said Clemens problem is "more lim- ited to two tendons in the front  of the shoulder."

Lou speak!:; out 
On football: "Football is an extension of life. Everything that you're going to face in life in the years to come is involved in football. You have some goals, you have some direction. You've got to develop your skills, your talent, your abilities. You've got to vtork exceptionally hard. It's also a game where !IOU need other people. Your future or your success depends on others. You can be a great receiver but if the quarterback doesn't get you the ball, you can't display your talents or abilities. And if you do all this, you still may not get the recognition you think you deserve. You win and they give it to somebody else. You don't get the promotion to the first team.' 
On winning and losing: "You have heartaches and you have disappointments. Things don't go well and you lose. You don't necessarily have a lot of friends. You have to hire pallbearers for your own funeral. And when you win, you have all kinds of people rejoicing and all of a sudden you find out that's not really what's important in life or in football." 
On the volume of mail hE! receives: "We spend half of our time opening mail about speaking requests. I am not a speaker. I'm a coach. I can't imagine going a1nywhere that the volume of mail I get would diminish. If I became a mailman, I wouldn't handle as much mail as I do now." 
On pressure: "I do not feel pressure to win · none. There's never been anyone from the administration who has said that we have to win this game. I like to win and I'm sure they're disappointed when we don't win. Pressure is going to take a big exam when you haven't studied. I do feel pressure to run the program and have our players reflect lhe standards that Notre Dame values and cherishes. We just do the best we can and let things take care of themselves." 
On criticism and accusations: "It seems that the more success you have, the more situations like that arise. It hurts you with some of the things you can't control. You have to look at yourself and say, 'Did I do the right thing?' If the answer is no, you just have to go on. If the answer is yes, you have to ask what you could do to improve that." 
On real pressure: "When you're 35 and the bank turned down your request to re-mortgage the farm, you've got a crop in the field, you've got six hungry youngsters and your wife ran off with the drummer, you'll understand that there's got to be a resilience to you, some determination, something to get you through tough times." 
On life: "Be a participant in life. Do not be a spectator. You do something to experience what it's like. You can do it once and experience it a thousand times. Instead of staying on the sofa watching TV, go do aomething."

But Holtz did win. 
After a 5-6 opening season, Holtz led the 1987 team to an 8-4 mark and an appearance in the Cotton Bowl. He followed that with a perfect 12-0 mark in 1988 and the national cham­pionship. The encore was a 12­1 record and a second-place rankin!! in 1989.

"People said we lacked disci­pline and that we were a bunch of thugs," Holtz said. "You look at it and you say, 'I can't change what they said.' You look at it and see if there is any truth to it. There was no truth that we had thugs on our team. Sometimes, they make bad de­cisions, but they're great peo­ple." 
The tunnel incidents were just a small part of the off-field problems Holtz has faced in the past two years. There have been suspensions of key play­ers, allegations of widespread steroid use among Irish play­ers, accusations of recruiting violations and even charges of telephone misuse.

Coast Conference finals, de­feating NCAA co-champion Virginia along the way. Junior forward Clint Carnell and ju­nior George Dunn are the cornerstones of Duke. 
Berticelli's positive frame of mind has already worn off onto this Notre Dame team. 
"It's a test," said junior goal­keeper Peter Gulli. "We plared well (in an exhibition) agamst Indiana, and that gave us con­fidence we could play with Top 20 teams." 
Senior co-captain Paul LaVigne thinks the Irish have become more focused. "The in­tensity level is key." he said. "What you do in practice is what you do in games, and we've had good intensity levels in practice." 
The road doesn't get any easier for the Irish after Friday's game with the Blue Devils, as Notre Dame will face another strong ACC team in North Carolina State on Sunday. 
The Wolfpack, ranked 17th in 
the nation by Soccer America, 
have two wins so far in the '90 
campaign. against the same 
Jacksonville and UNC­
Greensboro teams beaten by 
Duke. N.C. State's attack has 
proved dangerous this season, 
propelling the 'Pack to a com­
bined 11-1 score irt their two 
victories. 
N.C. State was 8-8-1 last sea­son, respectable considering the strength of the ACC, and re­turns eight starters off that team. Stars for the Wolfpack include All-ACC midfielder Dario Brose, as well as forward Henry Gutierrez, and keeper Dale Allred, who played in every single minute of competition last season. 
The Irish aren't looking past the Blue Devils at the Wolfpack, though. 
"N.C. State is equal, if not tougher than Duke, but we want to take one game at a time," Gulli said. "We'll think about State after Duke." 
Berticelli is confident but cau­tious about his team's chances. "We can be competitive," he said, "but they're experienced 
teams, and we're less experi­
enced, so it's very, very impor­
tant for us to play well as a 
unit. If we do, then we can give 
them a tough match." 
Road trips such as these are a key component in taking a team to the championship-caliber level, and if the enthusiasm the players show and the overtime period against Dayton are any indicators, the Irish could upset a ranked team in the very near future.

Nasty boys meet as 'Canes travel west to take on BYU 

CORAL GABLES, Fla. (AP) ­Defensive tackle Russell Maryland has coined a label worthy of boxing promoter Don King for Saturday's game between football heavyweights Miami and Brigham Young. 
"Nasty from the East meets Nasty from the West," Miami's Maryland said with a chuckle. 
The top-ranked Hurricanes travel to Utah for their season opener bearing a tradition of verbal intimidation -.on-the­field taunting and off-the-field boasting. Brigham Young, though it is a Mormon school, has been accused in recent years of playing dirty. 
"They're religious and every­thing," Maryland said. "But I guess they're human, too. They're just like us in a sense." 
The 16th-ranked Cougars' opener last Saturday at Texas-El Paso did nothing to improve their image. A 30-10 victory was marred by a bench-clearing brawl in the third quarter and the ejection of star halfback Matt Bellini. 
"I don't expect that to happen with us," Miami coach Dennis Erickson said, "because we never do that kind of stuff." His comment drew laughter from reporters. 
In truth, Miami's reputation has improved since Erickson The Observer/Andrew McCloskey became coach last year. He has Mitch Kern and the Irish will face Duke and N.C. State this weekend. cracked down on taunting and has warned the Hurricanes to

"It's taken a lot to kind of

At BYU, the bad-boy image contrasts with school rules that prphimt students from using tobacco, alcohol or caffeine. Cougars coach La Veil Edwards said fights such as the one last Saturday happen once in a while; Bellini said he and his teammates are football players, not angels. 
Nasty East and Nasty West have met once before, in 1988. The Hurricanes won 41-17 and came away from the game shaking their heads about Brigham Young's four flagrant 15-yard penalties.

Saturday, the Belles travel to Kalamazoo to ocmpete in the Hornet Invitational.

Agassi, Becker win at Open 
NEW YORK (AP) -Sassy and flashy and psyched to the max, Andre Agassi put on a show of blast-away tennis to set up a fiery match against Boris Becker in the U.S. Open semifi­nals. 
Agassi, hungry for his first Grand Slam, chewed up Soviet Andrei Cherkasov 6-2, 6-2, 6-3 Thursday night and gave fur­ther proof that he isn't just the tennis world's loudest dresser.

from side to side, desperately chasing balls and finally hitting them wide or into the net. Agassi finished the set with a service winner to take the game at love. 
It was more of the same in the second set and third, Cherkasov breaking Agassi a few times but Agassi coming right back with his relentless assault. 
"He has powerful ground­strokes. I think the best in the world," said Cherkasov, a 20­year-old born on the Fourth of July.

runs in the family. Her father John Slosar played basketball at John Carroll University. 
"My Dad's been my biggest inspiration," Slosar said. "He doesn't really know volleyball, but he's always been my mental coach. He really understands." 
Slosar basically had her pick of the crop coming out of high school. She had scholarship of­fers for basketball but none of the schools appealed to her. Her decision came down to the University of Michigan (which also offered her a golf scholar­ship) and Notre Dame. 
"Michigan had a really good engineering program too, but nothing beats the tradition of Notre Dame. The community spirit is great here. My recruit­ing visit told me where I wanted to be." 
Ah yes, yet another loss for Michigan at the hands of the Irish. 
Slosar is making a good ad­justment to the college game. "The game moves much quicker at this level. T.eams like Stanford and Texas are strong teams. It's boom, boom, boom. The play out West is much

quicker than in the Midwest. I'm still getting used to it, but it doesn't come all at once." 
"Jennifer is making tremen­dous progress," said Lambert. "She's really coming into her own. Her defense is improved and her passing is better. She's starting to hit like we expected her to hit. When she's on like .< she was against Washington State (18 kills), we can just get the sideout and keep giving her the ball to score." 
Again, like most varsity ath­letes on this campus, Jennifer is never satisfied. 
"There's not one part of my game I don't need to work on. It's mostly a matter of being consistent. I love to hit, but even that needs work." 
Still, this looks like it could be the year for Jennifer Slosar. She played 22 games as a freshman and 62 as a sopho­more. She was second on the team last year with a 2.69 kill average (137 total kills). She had some of her best games against teams in the Top 25. She had 16 kills and four ser­vice aces against Illinois (ranked seventh this year), as well as 16 kills against Kentucky and 15 against Texas-Arlington. 
''I'm really excited about this year," Slosar said."We have a tough schedule, but in order to be the best you have to play the best. Everyone on the team feels that way." 
Unfortunately, Slosar won't be in action for the Irish this weekend. She has been plagued by shin splints in the last few years, but after an unusual amount of pain, a bone scan yesterday revealed a stress fracture in her right ankle. 
"That's not what she needed right now" Lambert said. "We don't know when she'll be back." 
Slosar on the other hand, has different ideas. 
"I'm being fitted for a brace. I won't play this weekend but I'm looking to play in the Big Four TournamenL{Sept. 14­15]." 
A great competitor isn't kept down. 

Women's soccer squad flies south for weekend 
By DAVE DIETEMAN Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame women's soccer team takes to the skies this weekend as it flies south for matchups against Top 20 opponents Duke and UNC­Greensboro. 
The Irish set off for sunny North Carolina at 8 a.m. Friday morning, in order that they may have ample time to gear up for a Saturday showdown with Duke at 2 p.m. and a Sunday meeting with Greensboro at 1 p.m. 
Does this sound simple? Fly down, win, fly home. Not quite. The Irish are in for two hard­fought games this weekend. Duke, which was ranked 20th in Division I in the most recent NCAA poll, recently trounced fifth-ranked William and Mary (at William and Mary), raising Duke's record on the young season to 2-0. In their first game, the Blue Devils handily dispatched Mercer 6-0 at Duke. 
"Duke is scary," noted Irish head coach Chris Petrucelli. "They have lots of firepower up front, and they are solid at ev­ery position. Mary Pat Rosenthal, the daughter of Notre Dame Athletic Director Dick Rosenthal, is a tough full­back for Duke. We definitely have to be aware of her when we're taking corner kicks. 
"But of course, she is only one of many talented players. It's a difficult situation to go to their place, both because they are playing well now and we have a young team." 
Similarly, UNC-Greensboro, Petrucelli's alma mater, has been in the Top 20 of Division II each of the past three years. 
"Greensboro is a young and talented program," explained Petrucelli. "They are at a point where they have lots of juniors playing, while we have lots of freshmen playing. Again, they will be difficult to beat. The hardest part is that we have to play them the day after we play Duke." · 
Yet the Irish, who tied Wisconsin 1-1 at Wisconsin (no easy feat) in an exhibition game, are 1-0 on the regular season after a 5-1 victory over Northeast Missouri State last national championships on the Giolitto, who scored two ful for Saturday and possible have too many injuries." field we'll be playing on, and it goals in Notre Dame's season­for Sunday, will be temporarily "As far as the season is con­has many good memories for opener, is a junior midfielder, replaced by freshman Andrea cerned, we need to be encour­me.

Team. The Regional team takes the best players of a certain age in a given region (in Petrucelli's case, the best 16­year-olds from Maine to Virginia) from their respective state teams, before turning them over to the United States National Team. 
"Duke may be rated higher than us, but we have a good chance to beat them," stated a determined Marianne Giolitto. ''I'm really excited about this trip; I can't wait to play. Right now I'm just thinking about Duke. After the game with Duke is over, then I'll think about Greensboro."

A few days after the Sports Illustrated article appeared accusing Notre Dame of widepsread steroid use in its football program head coach Lou Holtz received a phone call from one of his fraternity brothers at Kent St<.te. 
"He said 'You've got the worst job in the country,'" Holtz said. "He said. 'you're in the worst profession you could be in.' He said, 'We were right

... in college. You sure aren't very smart."' "Now I don't know whether he was trying to be funny or what. One thing was obvious ­he was glad he had his job and I had mine. But I told him, 'I'm in the greatest profession in the world and I'm at the greatest place in the world.'" As he enters his fifth season at Notre Dame, one gets the feeling that Holtz has genuinely found happiness in the most pressure-filled program in the nation. While dealing with steroids, suspensions and pre-game fights, Holtz has managed a 37-11 record in four seasons at the helm of the Irish program.

Volleyball to host Invitational 
By MIKE KAMPADT 
Sports Writer 
The women's volleyball team hopes this weekend is as good as last weekend was bad. After dropping their first three matches of the year, the Irish host the Notre Dame Invitational at the Joyce ACC Friday and Saturday. 
Notre Dame takes on Evansville at 8 p.m. on Friday. Saturday it's back to the court early with a 10 a.m. match against Saint Louis and then a 8 p.m. contest with the Broncos of Western Michigan University. 
"I have no idea what to ex­pect from these teams," said head coach Art Lambert. "We played Western Michigan last year, but they lost everybody and they have a very young

He is 24-1 in the past two sea­sons, including a national championship in 1988. 
"Every other place there was something missing," Holtz said. "You think it's special here but you don't really understand what it's all about. It happens when you're part of the family. I don't want to be a well-known person. I n_ight be because there's no way you can't be at Notre Dame. I just want to coach here, live here and iden­tify with Notre Dame." 
In the early 1950s Holtz was one of 7 4 boys out for the East Liverpool, Ohio, High School football team. The number would ewmtuallv dwindle to 26 by the end of the season. 
That Holtz was one of those final 26 tells a lot about his character and also a lot about what he expects from those people around him. 
"Our high school coach was very tough, very demanding," Holtz said. "The only reason I didn't quit was that I couldn't figure out how I could tell my dad who was in the Pacific (in World War II) or my uncle who in the Battle of the Bulge that it was too tough. You just don't tell people who went through

team. Still, they're well coached and will be formidable for us. We haven't played Evansville or Saint Louis for three or four years so I don't know a thing about them." 
The Irish recovered from last weekend to have a good pro­ductive week of practice. 
"Things went very well this week," said Lambert. "I was pleased. Now we just have to

There used to be an unwritten rule in college football that the Heisman Trophy would not be awarded to underclassmen. 
But with the recent exodus of juniors into the NFL, the senior Heisman Trophy candidate is quickly becoming an endan­gered species. 
This year is no exception as six underclassmen, including two sophomores, are consid­ered strong favorites to win college football's most presti­gious award. It is conceivable that all five invitations to February's trophy presentation in New York's plush Downtown Athletic Club could go to under­classmen. 
Leading the pack is Notre Dame's own Raghib Ismail, widely considered the most ex­citing player in the country. Ismail's versatility knows no bounds as he has been utilized in much the same way as former Irish standout and Heisman Trophy winner Tim Brown, seeing action at

"We practiced really well this week," agreed junior outside hitter Jennifer Slosar, one of last weekend's bright spots who will be sidelined this week­end by a stress fracture in her right ankle. 
"Everyone was pretty upset after last weekend. We know those teams were very heatable. We could have won them all. We can really be an excellent team, it's just that so far our work in practice and the game have been totally different. 
"We can make the NCAAs if we pull together. Everybody has to have their best game all the time. We have to focus and put our minds to it." 
Those are two of things that are firm beliefs of Jennifer

Not one to waste time, Ismail began gathering admirers with his special teams play during his freshman campaign, Notre Dame's 1988 National Championship season. Ismail was awarded the NCAA statis­tical title for kickoff returns despite falling two returns short of the number needed to qualify. The NCAA awarded him the title because his 36.1-yard average would still have led the country even if two returns of zero yards were averaged into his total. 
Now a junior, Ismail returns as a consensus All-American and The Sporting News's num­ber-one preseason candidate for the Heisman. However, the one factor standing between Ismail and the Heisman Trophy

New head soccer coach Mike Berticelli is about to experience two more firsts at Notre Dame --his first regular-season road trip and his first match with a Top 20 opponent as the coach of ND. The Irish travel to Durham, N.C., to participate in the Metropolitan Life Classic, where they will face lOth­ranked Duke tonight, and 17th-ranked N.C. State on Sunday. 
Notre Dame soccer fans had some cause for concern throughout much of last Saturday's opener versus Dayton, as the Irish were something less than sharp. Much of that concern evapo­rated after a Notre Dame scoring blitz that ultimately gave them a 5-l overtime victory. At least it did in the mind of Coach Berticelli. 
"Hopefully playing better at the end has given us some momentum," Berticelli said, "but the level of competition will be far higher than against Dayton." 
Tonight the Irish will face a team that has already notched two wins against quality opponents, as Duke downed Jacksonville and the University of North Carolina--Greensboro ear­lier this season. 
The Blue Devils return nine starters from a team that compiled a 10-5-1 record and reached the Atlantic
