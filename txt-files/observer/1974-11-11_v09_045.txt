SMC cites unfair ticket pr1ces 
by Bob Mader Staff Reporter 

St.· Mary's students and administrators have charged unfair treatment in the sale of season basketball tickets. St. Mary's season tickets cost $10 more than identical Notre Dame tickets. 
St. Mary's season tickets were sold this year for $28 and restricted to bleacher seats only, apparently because the compromise on student season ticket prices worked out by Student Body President Pat McLaughlip and University Executive Vice­President Edmund Joyce did not extend to St. Mary's students. 
The inequity in prices was never brought up during the furor that erupted over the doubling of Notre Dame season ticket prices. McLaughlin was astonished when asked about the difference in prices. 
"We never talked of St. Mary's tickets being higher <during the compromise talks). We assumed that the prices would be the same because no one had said anything different," Me Laughlin said. 
ACC Ticket Manager Don Bouffard said that McLaughlin should have been aware of the price difference, since the Notre Dame Athletic Depart­ment sent a bulletin announcing ticket prices and dates of sale to McLaughlin, the Observer, and the Scholastic. 
McLaughlin and Tom Drape, Observer editor-in­chief, deny receiveing such a bulletin. Scholastic Pditor Jim Gresser stated that to the best of his knowledge the magazine did not receive the bulletin. 
Stevie Wernig, assistant to the vice-president of ,;tudent affairs at St. Mary's, said she talked to Sr. .John Miriam Jones, assistant provost, to see if the prices could be equalized. Wernig and Jones l'egularly work together on joint student affairs matters. Jones told Wernig that it would be im-Basketball ticket prices for SMC students have

possible to equalize the prices, because "it has always been set up that way." 
Wernig was pessimistic when asked about the chances of the prices being the same in th near future. "There would have to be a complete change of attitude concerning St. Mary's over at the Notre Dame Athletic Department," Wernig said. 
St. Mary's students did not learn of the $28 price until they received the ticket applications in the mail, according to Wernig. Some St. Mary's students wanted to write "boycott" across the applications and mail them back to the athletic department. Wernig stated that the student affairs office discouraged this action, because she felt that St. Mary's students may have been denied tickets altogether in the future :as a result. 
"It's unfortunate," Wernig commented. "Notre Dame has the right to treat its students differently from those of other schools. The thing is that it's still a discount even though it's not as big as the discount Notre Dame students get, but I don't think it helps bring the two campuses together. The two institutions work together and there should be more coopperation on this than there is." 
Many St. Mary's students when telephoned at random said they did not buy tickets because of the high prices. One student said she believes that none ol the fourth floor of Regina South had bought tickets due to the expense. A majority of the responses were unprintable. 
St. Mary's students also have to sit in a special section of the bleachers. Bouffard said that if SMC students were allowed to sit anywhere in the bleachers, they would "force Notre Dame students, who should have and advantage in ticket choice, out of the best seats." 
Joanne Garrett, SMC legislative commissioner, said although she did not buy basketball tickets last year, she clarly remembers sitting among Notre Dame student her 1freshman year. When she asked Bouffard about this he told her St. Mary's students had never sat in the same sections with Notre Dame students. 
"I think it's stupid," one St. Mary's student commented. "I can just see all the St. Mary's girls sitting together waving their hankies, and yelling 'yea, team'. It's really queer." 
Both Bouffard and John Stephens, assistant· director of athletics, said the higher prices and a separate section for St. Mary's students do not constitute discrimination. "It's a case where you give your own people the benefit," Stephens said. 
Some St. Mary's students felt they received their tickets too close to last Friday's deadline, and really had no time to react ot what they felt was unfair. Bouffard said any delay in mailing the ticket ap­plications was caused when McLaughlin and Joyce were hammering out the price compromise for Notre Dame students. Bouffard said the ap­plications were mailed a "week or two" before the semester break. 
Bouffard pointed out that the spouses of married students could not sit in the Notre Dame student section, since that would also "give non-students better seats than they should get." 
World food crisis becomes major concern 
by Gregg B. Bangs Staff Reporter 

Amid the press coverage of Watergate, national elections and the economy, an important but timeless problem has become the 
study of both the media and social groups. The world food crisis, which is affecting all parts of the globe, has become the subject of many recent documentaries and magazine articles. There is presently a World Hunger Council being held in Rome to discuss the crisis and offer some viable solutions. 
The interest in this problem has also spread to college campuses throughout the United States. This past November 3, 2,000 college students at Yale University fasted one day to demonstrate their concern over the problem. The money saved by not having to prepare meals for these students was donated to the cause of combating world hunger. 
A number of students and faculty members here at the Notre Dame community have shown concern over this problem. CILA, Campus Ministries, the Program in Non­violence and other interested people have banded together to form a committee known as the Hunger Coalition. The group was formed as a result of several students expressing interest in the problem at a CILA meeting in late September. 
The goals of the group are twofold. One goal is to "raise the consciousness of the Notre Dame­South Bend community concerning the main spiritual, moral, and social issues related to the many dimensions of the world food crisis, according to a memo written at a meeting in regard to the Hunger Coalition. 
To achieve this consciousness ­raising the group plans to enlist the help of resource persons from the Notre Dame-South Bend Com­munity to help people understand the main issues. These educat. Jttal programs will be more than one-shot deals, so that in­terested parties can develop a framework from which to un­derstand the crisis of world hunger. 
The other goal of the coalition is 
to "develop a variety of creative 
action responses to the problems 
so that during the educational 
experience it will be possible to 
have a real compassion for some of 
the persons and issues involved. 
To ask Fr. Hesburgh to confirm 
some of the action strategies which 
would include influencing the 
dining halls and food­
sales in ways of collecting money 
to be sent abroad," the memo also 
stated. 
Two panel discussions have been 
held thus far in fulfillment of the educational goal of the group. On October 10, faculty members 

Robert Mcintosh of Ecology, Julian Pleasants of Microbiology and Erhard Winkler of the Earth Sciences Department met to discuss "Issues and Prospects." Professors Peter Walshe, Karamjit Rai and Oscar Brookins of the government, biology and economics departments respec­tively met on Oct. 17 to discuss the crisis in India and Africa. 
A third discussion period will take place Thursday, November 14, on "The Ethics of Food, Population, and Energy." Panel members for this particular meeting will include Edward Malley of the Theology Depart­ment, Edward Manier of the Philosophy Department and Bglsil O'Leary of the Program in Non­Violence. 
Two events have been p1anned for the month of Novemlller, to meet the second goal of the coalition. "Next week we are going to stand outside . the dining halls asking-the students to bypass sa dinner to show their support of our cause," Tim Scully, a member of the coalition, explained. 
Scully added that if the response_ was favorable, a programmightbe worked out with the dining halls that would enable a student to bypass a normal meal in exchange for a low protein, low calorie meal." This meal would enable The next planned general students who are interested in this meeting of the coalition is cause to come together," he said. scheduled for December 2. 
On Nov. 26, Hesburgh will say a Anybody interested in joining the 'Vlass and address himself to the coalition should call Mary Ann problem of world hunger. All are Roemer, the "connector for the welcome to atten~. coalition,"at 6536 or 8832.

to complete the 15-week semester. 
Classes will usually meet once a week on Thursday nights. Students , however, will be ex­pected to attend occasional sessions on Wednesday and Friday mornings between 10 a.m. and noon. 
Each of the four units will have a guest speaker for its final Thur­sday night session. These lectures which will be presented in the Memorial Library Auditorium, will be open to the public free of charge. Afterwards, the speaker will meet with the seminar priv11tely to discuss topics of study. 
In order to give the students maximum exposure to the guest lecturer, he will have breakfast with them before leaving the next morning. 
The four speakers invited to join the seminar are Professor William 
Y. Adams, an anthropologist from the University of Kentucky; Professor Thomas Jacobson, a prehistoric archeologist from Indiana University; Professor Ray Sieber, an art historian from In­
diana University; and John Cotter, 
curator of historical American 
archeology at the University of 
Pennsylvania. Adams and 
Jacobson have already accepted 
the invitation. 
"Material objects of every 
description are often valuable data 
in several fields," Bellis said. 
"The archeologist, the classicist, the artist and the historian all have 'an interest in material culture." 
Rushton pointed out that 
although information is most often 
gathered from literary sources 
objects themselves can be a data 
base. "The problem is that the 
data objects hold is not already 
reduced to words; we have to find 
a method to get at it," he said. 
Explaining how the new course 
originated, Bellis said, "We (the 
four professors) each had been 
doing some work with the material 
culture last f!._li, and we often 
discussed how our technizues 
compare. Last spring we began 
talking about what we could do, if 
we were allowed to have a course." 
Vacca emphasized that the seminar is not intended to be a comprehensive study of material culture. "We are simply going to look at different approaches to material culture," he said. 
"We are looking for people in­
terested in exploring ideas-people 
who are conceptually or 
theoretically orientated," Rushton 
added. 
Students need not be majors in one of the four departments in­volved to enroll in the seminar; however, they must receive per­mission from one of the four professors. The limited number of seats in the class will not be filled on a first-come-first-served basis but according to the qualifications of those wishing to join. Students interested should contact professors Bellis, Vacca, Rushton or Schlereth as soon as possible.

Student calendar opinion voiced 
by Terry Keeney 
News Editor 

A random survey of students concerning the current academic calendar reveals that 46 per cent of those polled would favor a similar fall calendar next year. These results, coming in the wake of the week-long October break, indicate a marked increase in student support· of the current fall calen­dar. 
Majority favors break 

The survey, conducted over the weekend among 382 Notre Dame and St. Mary's students, shows that 54 per cent of the students would not favor the mid-semester break next year if it would mean starting classes in August.

An evening symposium on education and the science of creative intelligence, sponsored by the American Foundation for the Science of Creative Intelligence, will be held in the Memorial Library Auditorium on Tuesday, November 12, from 7:30 until 10 p.m. 
Featured speakers will be Frederick J. Crosson, PhD, dean of the College of Arts and Letters and author of several books; Donald A. Dake, superintendent of the South Bend community school cor­poration; and Lawrence Farwell, international director of the World Plan Executive Council, Maharishi International University.

88 per cent of those polled opposed the August start.ing date for classes. 
When asked if they would favor a week-long mid-semester break next fall even though it might mean beginniQgclasses in August, 204 students said yes. Two hun­dred eighteen students did not favor the week-long break coupled with the Aue:ust start. 
The survey found that about 85 per cent of the student body left campus during the break. Of the students polled 67 oP.r cent categorized the breakadds a time primarily spent relaxing. Twenty­five per cent stated that they spent most of their break time engaged in school work. 
Leaving early and returning late 
The survey revealed that 35 per cent of those polled either left campus before the break officially began on Friday October 25 or returned after classes resumed on November 4. 

Such erosion of student at­tendance immediately before and after break was an issue in the debate on the new calender before the Academic Council last year. 
Earliest start on record 

The' current fall academic claendar marked the earliest start of classes in Notre Dame history. It also provided for the first full­week mid-semester break in the fall. <The spring semester has traditionally had a mid-semester break.)

man, woman and devil 

a previevvby rrary ellen mccndre\NS 
Thursday, N9vember 14th, the Dance and Drama Series of the Cultural Arts Com­mission will present the New York Theater Company's production of "The Apple Tree." 
Composed of three short musicals held together by the common theme of Man, Woman, and Devil, "The Apple Tree" is the work of Jerry Bock and Sheldon Harnick. Besides this musical hit they are well known for such successes as "Fiddler on the Roof" and "Fiorello." 
The first musical is based on the short story, "Diary of Adam and Eve" by Mark Twain. America's beloved satirist lives up to his reputation for biting wit in this "razor sharp" mock of the war between man and woman which began in the Garden of Eden. Set in modern times, Henry Hewes of The Saturday Review wrote of it: 
" ... Adam is portrayed amusingly as an rasygoing, not too bright young man out­maneuvered into a marriage and a rathrrhood he doesn't appreciate until he bt>comrs a widower. Eve is revealed as self­crntered. impelled to homemaking and mothrrhood." 
The dialogue is comic but the story of Adam and Eve's discovery of sex and love is appealing and touchingly funny. 
The second segment of "The Apple Tree" is based on Frank Stockton's classic short story "The Lady or the Tiger." First published in 1884, the story has continued to tantalize audiences with its either-or choice. 
This production is set in a semi-barbaric kingdom where a king offers a prisoner the choice between two doors. At the outset of the action a balladeer sings the song "I'll Tell You the Truth" but the audience waits in suspense as the prisoner chooses the way that will render him either a man-eating tiger or the princess of the kingdom. 
Jules Feiffer is the author of 
"Passionalla" the story on which the third musical is based. A multi-talented man, Feiffer is probably best known as a car­toonist whose portrayals of modern day dreads and anxieties have been in syn­dicated newspapers throguhout the United States. "Passionalla" is the modern day version of the Cinderella story. A satirization of Hollywood, the tale opens with a forlorn chimney sweep girl singing her dream of becoming a movie star. Sure enough, with the help of her friendly fairy godmother, she is miraculously trans­fromed into a glamourous movie star. Yet she ends up making a mockery of her glamour girl image when she plays the role of her old chimney sweep self in order to win both an Adademy Award and the love of her boyfriend. 

First produced on Broadway by Mike Nichols, "The Apple Tree" is part of the repetory that the New York Theater Company will be staging in its 1974-75 season. The company will be touring colleges and universities across the United States with "The Apple Tree," "The Fantastiks," and "Berlin to Broadway with Kurt Weil." 
The New York Theater Company was established in 1969 as the musical theater division of the National Shakespeare Company. Newsweek called the company one of the more worthy theatrical en­
. terprises currently around town and Anna Kisselgoff of the New York Times wrote that the "productions are fully professional compared to Broadway, the actors relating to the material and the audience." 
The company has an exelllent director in Richard Ronald Beebe. Since getting his 
M.A. in theater in 1935 at the University of Michigan, Mr. Beebe has gone on to amass credits in over sixty stage productions. He established Studio 872 in Zwabrucken Germany where he worked as director choreographer and designer in such show~ as "Guys and Dolls", "On the Town" , and "Look Homeward Angel." He has won awards for best set designer and best actor. His latest effort was the production of "Arturo Ui" with Al Pacino. 
The greatest innovation since plots, as one critic wrote--you cannot pass up "The Apple Tree." The novelty of three separate musicals combined in one is sure to delight you. Tickets for the 8:00p.m. performance go on sale November 7th at the Student Union Ticket Office. Admission is $2.00 for students and $3.00 for adults.

The Features Page of Friday's Observer erroneously listed prices for "The Apple Tree" at $7.00 and $2.00. Tickets are $3.00 for adults and $2.00 for students.

Castellino receives $25,000 grant 
Dr. Francis J. Castellino, associate professor of biochemistry at the l.J"ruversity of Notre Dame, has been awarded a Dreyfus Teacher-Scholar Grant of $25,000 by the Camille and Henry Dreyfus Foundation, Ind., New York. 
The purpose f the grants, which have been awarded annually since 1970, is to promote the careers of outstanding young teacher­scientists. The funds are to be used at t'ach recipient's discretion to carry out original teaching and research ideas in the fields of chemistry, biochemistry and chemical engineering .A sup­plementary grant is awarded to the nominating institution. 
Dr. Jeremiah P. Freeman, chairman of the Notre Dame chemistry department, called the Dreyfus Grant "a prestigious award for a young chemist." 
Since joining the University faculty in 1970, Castellino has been investigating the mechanisms by which the human body forms and dissolves blood clots. In addition, he teaches physical chemistry to undergraduate students and biochemistry to first-year medical students from the South Bend Center for Medical Education of Indiana University School of Medicine located at Notre Dame. 

The 31-year old chemist has established the existence and significance of two major forms of plasminogen in the human circilation. His research group is mvolved in determining the molecular events which occur in the physiological and pathological activation of plasminogen to the blood clot dissolving enzyme plasmin. Recently, he was invited to present his work at international conferences at Bsle, Switzerland. 
Castellino's research has been supported primarily by grants from the National Institutes of Health <NIH) and th eAmerican Heart Associaion. He recently received a fiv.e-year Research Career Development Award from NIH. 
The author of more than 25 ar­ticles in scientific publications, Castellino also is vice-chariman of the Rsearch Council of the Indiana Heart Association. He is an elected member of the American Socoety of Bilogicasl Chemists, the Thrombosis Council of the a,erican Heart Association, and the Task Force on Plasminogen and Plasmin of the Subcommittee on Standdards of the International Committeee on Thrombosis and Hemostasis, and a member of the New York Academy of Sciences and the American Association for the Advancement of Science.

was also the recipent of a 
Guggenheim Fellowship for study 
in England, a senior fellowship 
from the National Endowmenljfor 
the Humanities, and study grants 
from the American Council of 
Learned Socieites and the Social 
Science Research Council. He has 
been a member of Phi Beta Kappa, 
national honor society, since 1954. 
The author of more than 20 
publications, including the current 
"Witchcraft in the Middle Ages" 
and "Mediaeval Christianity," 
Russell is presently completing a 
"History of the Concept of Evil in 
Western Europe 1050-1200" for 
Cornell University Press. Some of 
his other articles include "Saint 
Boniface and the Eccentrics," 
"Dissent and Reform in the Early 
Middle Ages," and chapters on 
"Catholicism," "Heresy," and 
"Papacy" in Handbook of World
