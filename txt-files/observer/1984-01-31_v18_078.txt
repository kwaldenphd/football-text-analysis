The quadrennial ritual 
More than a thousand members of the Notre Dame and Saint Mary's community will descend on Stepan Center April 4. Crowded under the curved roof, they will spend hours cheering, chanting and listening to speeches. 
Aspringtime pep rally, perhaps? 
No, but a Notre Dame tradition, nonetheless -a 
tradition that has occurred only ten times in the past 44 
years. 

These students, faculty members, administrators and honored guests will meet with one goal in mind -to choose the Democratic candidate for the United States presidential election. 
While the final decision will not have much impact on the 1984 election as a whole, it will have a great and lasting impact on the people who participate. 
The Mock Convention has become a valuable and fascinating addition to the Notre Dame and Saint Mary's education process since the event was started in 1940. The convention is one ofthe

rhetoric. With the majority of the student body from out ofstate, perhaps students lose much with the politi· cal process -to the point most don't even bother to vote absentee in their homestate elections. Perhaps stu· dents become too immersed in campus happenings and social concerns to recogize the importance ofthe dec· tion process. Maybe they are weary of annually voting for student representatives who are accorded little 
authority in the collegiate setting. 
Although it is called the "Mock" Convention, the results it produces arc very 
oldest in the country and remains one of the most realistic. 
The fact that it is a quad· rennial ritual makes it even more valuable. It also demands a fresh approach to each convention. "It has to be sold new every four years," says Convention Coordinator Tom O'Leary. "It is a tradition that no one knows about." 
It is an opportunity that should not be overlooked. 
The tentative platform for the April convention will be ready by early March, according to O'Leary. This is 

simply a preliminary step ­the platform will be debated, amended and voted on at the convention. Campus special interest groups will soon begin debating election issues in order to prepare prospective delegates for the event. All students will receive information about becoming a delegate through the mail in mid-February. 
The coordinators are planning as realistic a conven· tion as possible. Stepan will contain all the banners, bal· loons and hoopla that will pervade the Democratic Convention in San Francisco this summer. Each delegate will represent his or her actual homestatc. O'Leary's planning committee is working on getting at least one of the Democratic candidates to come to ND for the convention. The convention will continue until it reaches a consensus -even if that takes until 4:20 a.m., like it did in 1972 when Hubert Humphrey was nominated.

real for Notre Dame and Saint Mary's. Rather than simply trying to predict who the Democratic candidate will be, the convention is a chance to state the choice of the student body. The 1984 Democratic candidates arc a colorful crowd and should not be ignored. The Mock Convention allows students the time and setting to ex· amine candidates and issues -and to make plans for their personal decision in November. 
The issues are the essence ofthe convention. While the mock convention nominee 

will pull little weight in the national race, the decision students make on issues while participating will have far-reaching effects. By the final day of the convention, April 7, approximately a thousand student delegates will have produced a plat­form that represents the goals and ideals of the 1984 student body. 
There is virtually no other way to gain such an over· view ofthe current generation. No otherform ofgather· ing such information -even a referendum, a phone poll or personal interviews -could be as exciting or as accurate as the Mock Convention. 
Politicians and their campaigns are often cynically dismissed in the academic setting. The Mock Conven· tion provides the forum to scrutinize candidates and issues in an uncommon setting. Without the adherent biases oftelevision or newspapers to obscure the event, participants can view the presidential race in a fresh, and perhaps encouraging manner.

Saint Mary's Board reviews coming events 
By FRANK LIPO 
News Staff 
The need for a Sunday mass at LeMans Hall was among the topics discussed at last night's Saint Mary's Board ofGovernance meeting. 
Student Body President Elaine H<~ctor also announced upcoming Student Government sponsored events. 
i\ post-Keenan Review party will be held this Friday from I l p.m. to 3 
a.m. in the Haggar College ('..enter. Student Government elections are scheduled Feb. 9 from 7 am. to 6 
p.m.. also in the Haggar Center. These ekctions have in the past been hdd in the dining hall. In other news, a new copy machine is now at the Haggar Center through the ef­forts of Student Government. The traditional "Little Sibling Weekend" is scheduled for Apri16-7. The Board will discuss this event at a future meeting. 

Saint Mary's Student Government is sponsoring a lecture by humorist Fran Lebowitz at 8 p.m., Feb. 7 at Carroll Hall. Lebowitz is the author of two best-selling books and is cur­rently a columnist for Mademoiselle magazine. The lecture is free to the public. 
The Board also discussed the pos­sibility of a Sunday mass at LeMans Hall. Although there are ap­proximately 500 residents of LeMans, they can only attend masses at Regina or Holy Cross. Of the 313 students surveyed by the Board, 253 or 81/, would prefer a mass at LeMans. The obstacles to a Lemans mass are poor acoustics in the chapel there as well as an awkward physical layout. Solutions such as remodeling or moving a Sunday mass from Regina to Stapleton Lounge in LeMans were discussed. This issue will be looked at again before any proposals are made.

U.S. negotiator Rowny anticipates arins talks with Soviets very soon 
Associated Press 

WASHINGTON -U.S. negotiator Edward Rowny said yesterday the 
United States would consider any serious Soviet proposals, including curbs on new U.S. nuclear missiles in Europe, in an effort to work out a strategic arms control agreement. 
After a half-hour meeting with President Reagan, Rowny told reporters he has a number ofU.S. ap­proaches or "trade-ofiS" to present if the Soviets agree to resume discus­
sions in Geneva, Switzerland. 

"It's in their interest to come back," Rowny said. "We are now in a position, when we return to the table, to make a breakthrough." 
Negotiations to curb medium­range missiles in Europe and separate talks on controlling inter­continental nuclear weapons are stalemated. The Soviets disrupted both discussions to protest installa­tion of U.S. Pershing 2 missiles in West Germany and cruise missiles in Britain. 
"We have some concrete proposals on trade-ofiS," Rowny said. 
Rowny was unwilling to predict whether the Soviets would agree to ftx a date for another round of the Strategic Arms Reduction Talks. 
"There are all kinds of signals coming out," said Rowny, who heads the li.S. delegation to the START talks. 
Rowny said Reagan agreed a settlement might be based on trim­ming the ll.S. lead in some weapons ifthe Soviets gave ground on others. 
For instance, the U.S. negotiator said, "we believe our advantages in bombers and cruise missiles can be traded offfor their advantages in bal­listic missiles." 
In the past, tli'e United States has resisted Soviet efforts to include European-based missiles in the START discussions. But Rowny said that "if the Soviets say they want to talk and they begin bringing up other issues, we're going to listen to any proposal they have." 
The White House meeting followed Reagan's announcement Sunday night that he was seeking re­election. Rowny denied there was a political motive in the timing of Reagan's focus on arms-reduction talks. 
In another development, White House spokesman Larry Speakes said 
U.S. nuclear tests will be announced only when they are considered "significant." 
He said the criteria were the im­portance ofthe test and the effect on the area surrouding the Nevada test site near Las Vegas. 
A White House official, who spoke only on condition that he not be identified, said the decision was based on "growing concern over site security, heightened by partially successful attempts by anti-nuclear 
groups to penetrate the test site." 
Soviet-American agreements per­mit only underground nuclear tests and limit them to I 50 kilotons. For several years. U.S. tests were dis­closed to the public. 
Until now, the R:agan administra­tion has refrained from making new proposals aimed at wooing the Soviets back to Geneva. But, in a statement, Rowny said Reagan agreed that "we are now in a posi­tion, when we return to the table..." 
Critics of the U.S. strategy of keeping the European missile talks separate from those on intercon­tinental weapons say that merging the two sets of negotiations and put­ting all issues on the table at once could improve prospects for a trade­off. 
Three arms control experts, two Americans and one West German, said at a news conference yesterday the medium-range and strategic arms talks should have been merged in the first place. 
Paul Warnke, chief U.S. negotiator of the SALT II treaty, said the medium-range talks "were always on the respirator and once the NATO deployment began, the plug was pulled." 
William Hyland, former deputy as­sistant national security adviser to President Ford, said separation of the talks "was a mistake."

Student Senate gives go ahead to resolution granting academic credit 
By CAROL CAMP 
Senior Staff Reporter 

A resolution granting academic credit for Student Government and Student Union members was passed at last night'~ Student Senate meeting. 
The proposal, which is subject to the approval of administration offi­cials. did not specify who should receive credit or how many hours of credit would be awarded. Senators merely concurred that students in­volved in Student Government and Student Union should receive some 
type of non-financial compensation 
for their efforts. 

In addition, the Senate adopted an official policy concerning the usc of alcohol on campus. A committee comprised of Student Body Presi­dent Brian Callaghan, Vice President Peggy Prevoznik, and Senators Ouis Tayback, Rob Bertino, Suzy Joyce. Mike Flint, andJim Slatt t cry created a policy calling for: 
Endorsement of the HPC plan which would reprimand the alcohol abuser on an individual basis. 
Ensuring that previously adopted guidelines for food and other non­alcoholic items at parties would be uniformly enforced in all dorms on campus. 
Increasing student activity fees and hall taxes in order to provide Student Union and individual hall councils with additional revenue for planning functions which provide alternatives to drinking. 
In effect, the Senate proposal em­phasizes stricter enforcement of the 

Observer 
CLASSIFIEDS 
rules which presently govern al­cohol use. Callaghan noted the policy "is not earth-shattering, but it does propose some changes; name­ly, to enforce the existing rules." 
He added, "Once the public report comes out, we can key in on specific areas -this is more theoreti­cal." 
The Senate policy will be presented at the Board of Trustees meeting in Key Biscayne February 9­10 and to the Committee on Alcohol Awareness prior to the release of its final report.

Before tht· revolurion, the llnited States shipped arms and machinery to the shah's government while Iranian tankers loaded with oil, caviar and intricate rugs arrived on American shores. 
In 1978, trade soared to S6.6 bil­lion, with rhe United States selling S 3. 7 hillion worth of goods, more than to any other nation outside Western Europe and Japan. 
Those commercial lies ended abruptly when Khomeini came to power, expropriated American companies and later seized the U.S. embassy in Tehran. Former Presi­dent Jimmy Carter imposed restric­tions on trade, but the trade embargo was lifted in January 1981 as part of agreement releasing the American hostages. 
Even so, trade betwet·n the two countries was so low in 198I the Commerce Department didn't bother to keep figurt·s.

cooperation of the hall rectors. "If public notice is given and ret·tors or rectoresscs spread the word to the hall staff to keep an eye out for the items it would really help," said Gorch. Terry and Gon:h both agree that Notre Dame is not a p<>lice state and a room -to-room search is out ofthe <IUt:stion. 
Terry believes adding a few more security guards would not really help the problem ofstudent theft. "If each studt·nt had a more respectful and responsible attitude toward obeying the law there would be no nt·ed for more security," he said. 
Gorch feels since most of the ob­jects in Lafortune were gifts to the University, the students should have mort· appreciation for them. 
said Kathleen Keirn, 1 specialist on 
Iran at the G>mmerce Department. 
If for example, a U.S. company sold 
machinery to a broker in West Ger­
many, who in turn sold it to Iran, the 
export transaction would be 
recorded between the United States 
and West Germany. 

Exports to Iran are still small. amounting to $170 million from January through November 1':183. That compares with Sl0 I million in 19H2. The exports were primarily machinery parts for motor vehicles, aircraft and oil exploration. 
Imports from Iran to the United 
States totaled S I billion for the first 
I I months of 1983, more than 
double the 19H2 level of S461 mil­
lion. Ninety percent was oil and spe­
cial petroleum products. 
A State Department official, speaking anonymously, said there are no legal contracts between American companies and Iran for oil because the Iranians have barred them. So, all of the oil is bought through traders on the spot market. 
Iran, the official said, barters oil with countries other than the United States, and that oil often ends up on the free marker where it might be bought by an American firm at a good price. 
The Reagan administration in­tends to make it even harder to do business with Iran. On )an. 23, the administration branded Iran as a country that exports terrorism and imposed tighter export controls.

WASHINGTON President Reagan is planning an active cam­paign outside the Rose Garden this spring, although he faces no opposi­tion for his party's presidential nomination, and he said yesterday he favors a debate with his Democratic opponent . 
Reagan, who will battle for many of the same labor votes that helped him win the 1980 election, argued his tax cut program benefited a wider range of Americans than did an extensive tax reduction offered by President John F. Kennedy 22 years ago. 
"Our tax program was fair," said Reagan. "It was fair across the board." 
With Sunday's formal announce­ment of his candidacy behind him, Reagan began a busy schedule that includes several trips out of Wash­ington each month and speeches in the capital. 
Yesterday, the audience was the National Religious Broadcasters' convention. Today he will fly to Chicago for a I0-minute speech to a convention ofthe sand and gravel in­dustf)'.

would debate his Democratic op­ponent, when nominated, Reagan replied: "In principle, I support debates. J favor that idea." 
Edward J Rollins, director of the Reagan campaign organization, said, "Today if the election were held, it would be far more of a rout than it was in 1980." 
He said Reagan's longtime politi­cal advisers "could not find four states in the country in which we are trailing." He said an election now would show Reagan winning 45 or 46 states with 55 percent to 57 per­cent of the vote. 
The Reagan campaign organiza­tion has 140 fulltime employes on its staff, I00 state chairmen :md co­chairmen in place, and two stories of rented space in an office building at the foot ofCapitol HilL 
It includes several former White House staff members, beginning with Rollins, the president's former 
political  adviser,  and  Rollins'  
deputy, Lee Atwater.  
Michael  K. Deaver,  the deputy  

chief of the White House staff and one of Reagan's closest advisers, said Reagan will seek to appeal to blue­collar workers, who proved to be a 
key clement in his landslide elec­
toral victOf)' in 1980. 

Deaver and other Reagan aides are 
quick to express their admiration for 
the support former Vice President 
Walter F. Mondale is getting from 
the AFL-CIO, as well as for the highly 
charged state of his campaign or­
ganization. 

"With that organization and a full­
time committment (from organized 
labor), we have a lot to be cvn­
cerned about," said Jim Lake, 
spokesman for the Reagan-Bush '84 
re-election committee. "Mondale's 
very tough and he's also very carel;.JI. 
He doesn't make mistakes. 
The Reagan campaign won't send the president to the Iowa and New Hampshire primaries as a lone voice against the Democrats. He will studiously avoid the sites ofbattle in the Democrats' campaign, sending surrogate campaigners to respond to the charges. 
A major share of the Reagan or­ganization's S26 million primaf)· campaign budget will go to voter registration projects, which Lake said would be "very critk·al to Ronald Reagan's re-election."

Until last month, the housing authority operated 52 apartments for whites in a predominantly white area of town and 52 apartments for blacks in a predominantly black area. 
Officials said they didn't segregate by policy, but that applicants always chose to live with their own race. 
But two black families filed suit in 1980 claiming they were denied housing because of the segregation. They won and U.S. District Judge William Wayne Justice of Tyler or­dered the apartment swap. He also ordered the housing authority to maintain a 50-SO racial balance in both cemplexes. 
Many white residents, however, found new homes rather than trans­fer to the formerly black housing project. 
As of last week, the formerly all­white complex had 26 white households, 24 black, one Mexican­American and one vacancy, Caviness said. 
The formerly all-black complex had 29 black families, 10 white and 13 vacancies. 
Caviness said she doubts she will ever be able to meet the court­ordered racial balance. 
"It was the hardest thing I've ever done," said Carrie Middleton, 77, one ofthe black residents ordered to 
move.

Housing contracts: signing away alcohol? 
Notre Dame students who plan to live on campus next year must return their housing contracts to the Office ofStudent Residences by Thursday. 
Because the University guarantees housing for all incoming freshman, the housing office must know how many current students plan to live in the dorms next year. Only then can thl·y decide whether there is enough space, and what steps they should take if more space is needed. 
Usually panic sets in around February and March when students request more housing than the University can provide. Talk of off-campus lotteries has become almost as much a part of spring as Bookstore Basketball and An Tostal. But this spring may be different. 
Ever since rumors ofa dry campus began to circulate, many students have considered moving off-campus. But many are in limbo, knowing that the University wants to do something next year, though no one is quite sure what. 
The executive committee of the Board of Trustees will review the commission's report later this February. According to Father Beauchamp, they could take several actions -give their approval, tell the commission to start over again, leave the matter to the discretion of administrators or wait for the entire Board ofTrustees to consider the mat­ter. 
But once again students have been put in an unfair position. To get a spot on campus next semester they must sign a contract and put S200 on the line. Those who plan to be resident assistants must swear allegiance to a policy which hasn't been formulated yet. 
To be fair to those who have submitted contracts, the University should eitherdelay implementation ofthe policy, or better, allow students to move off-campus without having to pay the S200 penalty.

The advertisers, as usual, have their fingers on the pulse ofthe public. Anxiety about com· puters turns up in just about every public­opinion poll or, for that matter, any conversation with a cab driver. 
A Louis Harris poll, for instance, shows great apprehension about both computers and their adjunct, the robot. At the same time that the public welcomes these innovations, it recognizes that they mean a loss of jobs ­some of them forever. 
But if a columnist is enticled to a guess, there is another kind of anxiety fueling the computer boom and it has little to do with jo~s. That anxiety is the one parents have for board nor when he sits before the computer is there an adult around -neither a parent nor a teacher. The kid is "struggling" in a world bereft of adults, a world in which adults are either too expensive (school) or too busy 
(home) to take time with him. 
This computer then is nothing less than a baby-sitter cum tutor. It is an electronic pacifier that will help junior with his homework when both parents are either at work or too fatigued when at home to grapple with their child's homework. The anxiety that the computer alleviates has only partly to do with a child's learningdifficulties. It also has to do with the trouble working parents have in finding time to deal with their child's dif­ficulty. 
If that is the case, then the computer will tum out to be nothing more than a gussied up 

A computer will not teach adultery, but there is little rea<;Qn to think that by itself it will teach motivation or discipline. It will hardly sit the kid down and make him or her work and it will not dial the phone to call the office if junior decides his homework can wait, but the TV cannot. As wonderful as the tutorial programs are, they are no substitute for either teacher or parent _.. especially ifthe learning is coming hard. 
So back to the kid in the commercial. Not for the last time in his life is he struggling ­computer or no computer. In fact, we're all struggling -struggling both at our jobs and at parenting and knowing, sometimes reluctant· ly, that there really is a "device" for struggli~ children. Most homes and schools already have one. It's called an adult. It's programmc!d to teach.

Billy Sims' testimony continues 
By MARTI AHERN 
·Associated Press 
Billy Sims admitted yesterday that 
he wanted to help his friend and 
agent Jerry Argovitz build a football 
team, but said he signed with the 
United States Football League Hous­
ton Gamblers only because Argovitz 
lied to him. 
Sims said in U.S. District Court he 
signed the Gamblers contract be­
cause he wanted to help Argovitz 
and because "I didn't want to go to a 
team that didn't want me." 
Sims signed contracts last year 
with both the USFL expansion team 
and the National Football League 
Detroit lions. He later sued the 
Gamblers and part-owner Argovitz 
on the grounds that Argovitz mis­
represented him in both sets ofcon­
tract negotiations. 
When asked by Argovitz' attorney, Steve Susman, whether he felt his former agent "intentionally lied to you to get you to sign," Sims replied, "intentionally, yes." 
Earlier in the trial, the running back testified that Argovitz had led him to believe contract talks with the lions had ended before he signed with the Gamblers. 
Sims said he felt his agent acted improperly "due to the fact that on­going negotiations were going on with the Lions when I signed." 
Argovitz was "not being fair with me from the beginning," Sims said.

The Notre Dame men's and women's fc:ndn~ tc:ams improvc:d their rc:cords as they wc:nt un­ddc:att:d over the weekc:nd in Columbus, Ohio. 
The Irish men knockl·d off North Carolina Statt· .23-4. Miami of Ohio .2'4-3. and highly touted North Carolina IH-9. Tht· victories im­provt'd their rc:cord to 9-0 while c:xtt·ndin~ thc:ir unddc:ated streak to 
16 mt-cts 16 met·ts going hack to February 9, 19H_>,, when they lost to Wayne State, 14-13. 
"Wt'rt· on a roll ri~ht now," ex­plained lkad Coach Mike: DeCicco. "We pi<:kc:d up an impressive win over a strong North Carolina squad (and the: team) is fendn~ with con­fidt·nce." 
The Irish sabre squad boosted its impressive: record to 77-11 as they wt·nt 19-3 against the three teams. Junior captain Mike: Janis ( 2I-I on the season) lost his first bout of the year against North Carolina while improving his lift-time record to 96­22 (fifth on the all-time Irish sabre squad list). 
Sophomore John Edwards rc:mained undcfeatc:d at I4-0 as he was 6-0 on Saturday. and sophomore Tony Consoli also was unbeaten over the weekend at 3-0 ( I6-2 on the season). 
The epee squad full of youth and determination improved its season mark to a surprising 70-18 at Columbus. Junior captain Andy Quaroni (I H-I on the season) led the epeeists despite losing his first bout also to the Tarhecls. He did im­prove his lifetime ledger to 8I-I S (he is sixth on the all-time epee list). Also impressive was frc:shman John Haugh, 4-I ( 12-I on the season) and sophomore Brian St. Clair , 5-1 ( I4­5). 
The foil squad led by frc:shman Charles Higgs-Coulthard,7-0, and sophomore Mike Vander Vclden, 4­2, improved its season record to 60­2H. Higgs-Coulthard, who is 26-1 for the year, is udcfeated in his last 24 bouts. Dave Router also went un­defeated at 3-0 ( I I-6 on the season).

Skaters

arrive 
Associated Press 
An IH-member U.S. speed skating team flew into Sarajevo on la~t night, the first American athletes to arrive for the XIV winter Olympics starting here next week. 
Three members of the squad and the team's head coach, Dianne Holum, did not make it. They com­peted in the women's World All­around Championships in Deventer, Holland, during the weekend and failed to join the team as planned. 
"I don't know if they're still in Amsterdam or ifthey got to Zagreb," said Bill Cushman, manager of the 
U.S. speed skating team, as the Americans checked into the Olym­pic Village. 
Among the missing U.S. skaters was Mary Docter of Madison, Wis., 
who  won  a  bronze  medal  in  the  
3,000  meters  in  Deventer  but  
finished a lowly I Oth overall.  

Most of the U.S. team, including the women's sprint skaters, has been working out in Davos, Switzerland, before the Olympics. 
Only three members on the team have skated here before, Danny Jan­sen of West Allls, Wis., and Dave Silk ofButte, Mont., andjane Goldman of Glenview, Ill. They competed in the World junior Championships last 
year.. 
his men must avoid a letdown as 
they are only halfway through their 
sea'ilm. 
The Irish ladies wen: also success­
ful on Saturday as they lost only two 
bouts in downing North Carolina 
State. 14-.2. and :\iiami ofOhio, 16-0. 
"I was proud of the way the women n·sponded after the heartbreaking loss to Wisconsin." explaint·d DeOcco. "We were able to fence a lot of people (and) our depth may become a factor latt·r this season." 
Leading the way for the Irish was freshman Cindy Weeks who posted a spotless 5-0 ( 7-.3 on rhe season). Janet Sullivan and Sharon DiNicola also posted solid victories of3-0 and 2-0 respectively. 
"Cindy (Weeks) really came through this weekend," said DeCk­co. "Hopefully. ht·r performance in Columbus will help build some con­fidence." 
The Irish fencers will take their 
show hack on the road on Saturday, 
February 4 when they travel to An­
gola where: they will duel Tri-State,

tant win, but she felt that this one was important for different reasons. 
"This was a big win for us because it got us out of a rut," said the Irish coach. "It's a little early to say whether or not this victory will turn things around for us, but there were a lot of positive signs. We needed people to play well, to play hard, to produce a total team effort. We got that tonight." 
Schueth, who like the rest of the team, is playing solidly of late, cited the team's progress as well. 
"We're really start:_ing to play well together," said the junior center. "It's too bad that it's this late in the season, but we've still got enough games left to win our conference (the Irish are currently in second place). 
"It was important for us to avenge the earlier defl.:at to DePaul. Per­sonally, I'm feding more com­fortable with my inside game, and I'm playing hard. The team is playing tough too, and everyone is feeling comfortable. We're staring to gell now."

SIU loses out 

Fastest mile relay time disallowed 
Associated Press 

A world's-best indoor clocking in the mile relay cannot be recognized as either a world or American record, a spokesman for The Ath­letics Congress said yessterday. 
The team of Perry Duncan, Tony Adams, Elvis Forde and Michael Franks was clocked at ~ minutes, 
H.94 seconds dring a triangular meet with host Indiana and Wisconstn at the Ill fiddhouse on Saturday. 
Although the Southern lllinois time is considered a world's best, it is not recognized as a world's record by the International Amateur Ath· ktk Federation be<:ause of a great disparity in indoor tracks. 
"It's almost like comparing applt's and oranges," TAC spokesman Pete Cava said. 

He also said the time "cannot be recognized as an American record because Forde (who is from Bar­bados) is a foreigner." 
The quarter-mile splits on In­diana's regulation track were hand-clocked. Duncan was timed at 47.25, Adams at 48.49, Forde at 
46.74 and Franks at 46.25. 
Franks, who only began running the quarter-mile last summer, qualified for the NCAA finals last season and competed international­ly for several U.S. amateur squads.

Irish women solidly defeat rival DePaul 
By LARRY BURKE 
Sports Writer 

Going into last night's game at the 
ACC, the Notre Dame women's bas· 
ketball team had a lot in common 
with the Lady Blue Demons of 
DePaul. Both teams had records of 
2-2 in the North Star Conference, 
and both were 7-10 overall. Both 
teams were also struggling to find a 
consistent winning combination. 
There was, however, one major 
difference between the two teams. 
The difference was DePaul's 16­
point victory the last time the two 
teams met on)an. 21 in Chicago. 
The Irish were out to even the 
score last night, and did just that, 
pulling away from De Paul in the 
second halfto win by a 78-62 score. 
"I definitely believe that we had a 
score to settle with DePaul," said 
Irish Coach Mary DiStanislao."l was 
pleased that the team felt that way 
also. I think we played better be­
cause ofit." 

Things started out slowly for the Irisl;l, as they had trouble with a stingy DePaul defense. Notre Dame matched the Lady Blue Demons basket-for-basket until the seven­minute mark of the first half, when DePaul forwardsjanine Douglas and Mary Lou O'Brien combined to score six straight points, giving the 
.visitors a 2 5-19 lead. 

DiStanislao called for a timeout at 
that moment, and it proved to be the 
turning point of the game. The Irish 
stormed back with nine unanswered 
points (six by sophomore forward 
Trena Keys) to take a 28-25 lead. 
They never trailed again. 

Notre Dame had a ~4-30 lead at 
the half, but came out looking for 
more. Led by Keys' sharpshooting and the tough inside play of junior center Mary Beth Schueth, the Irish began to puU away, taking a I~-point lead midway through the second half. 
"What we've needed all along is one or two dominant players, the kind that come through under pressure," said DiStanisao. "Tonight we got that kind of performance. Trena knew it was on her shoulders, and she came through for us. The same goes for Mary Beth, who along with Lavetta (Willis) and Carrie (Bates), really controlled the boards." 
In addition to the dominant play of leading scorers Keys ( 21 points) and Schueth ( 20 points), DiStanislao had a lot more to be happy about. 
"We got good perimeter shooting from Vonnie (Thompson) and Lynn (Ebben)," said the Irish coach. "Lynn also played very well defensively, and Vonnie is improv­ing with every game, showing grace under pressure. Ruth (Kaiser) also played well for us." 
DePaul was unable to rally in the 
second half, as the Irish took control 
at both ends of the court and won 
going away. Junior guard Laura 
Dougherty hit two free throws in the 
final minute to put the Irish up by 
14. In the process, Dougherty added to her nation-leading foul shooting statistics that now read 41 for 43 (.953 ). Following a DePaul basket, Thompson and Bates each sank a pair offree throws to forge the final score. 
TJIStanislao was hesitant to call the victory the biggest win of the season for the Irish, citing Notre Dame's 70­61 victory over UCLA as an impor­
