Alcohol issue kicks off Student Union lectures 
ByJANE KRAVCIK 
StaffReporter 
The posters around campus have finally announced it -"ACCENT is here." 
ACCENT is a lecture series sponsored by the student union and the Hall Academic Commission. It begins tonight at 7 p.m. in the Breen­Phillips hall lounge. 
The first lecture, by Father Wil­liam Beauchamp, administrative as­sistant to the executive vice-president, and Brian Callaghan, student body president, will be a dis­cussion of the alcohol problem and its possible solutions. Beauchamp is chairman of the alcohol commis­sion. The lecture is sponsored by the academic councils of Howard and Breen-Phillips Halls. 

This lecture will be the first of many, according to Series Com­misioner Maureen Carson, who commented, "This series is an op­portunity for the halls to get someone other than sports coaches to speak in the halls. There are many untapped people." 
The idea for the series came from Dr. James McDonnell, director of student activities. The student union then began to work on the idea last semester when faculty and staff members were contacted and asked which topics they would be willing to speak about. According to Carson, "The faculty and administrators were very receptive to speaking to students." 


Last-minute appeal by students prompts reversal of housing policy 
ByTHERESA GUARINO 
Copy Editor 
Because of an eleventh-hour plea with the Saint Mary's administration, students picking rooms for the fall semester's on-campus housing this week will not have to work around approximately 100 previously blocked-off rooms. 
An open meeting ofapproximate­ly 300 students with College Presi­dent John Duggan led to changes which left most of the students op­timistic. 
As Sophomore Louise Berezny said, "We are really excited -now we have a chance at rooms we want to live in, instead of rooms we are forced to live in." 
Problems started last week when students discovered that 26 rooms in LeMans, 33 rooms in Holy Cmss and 58 rooms in McCandless Halls 
had been reserved for next year's 
freshman class. The sophomore class council began a petition drive over the weekend and eventually gathered ten pages of signatures. The petition was presented to Dug­~an yesterday by three sophomore representatives. 
Meanwhile, signs wen: posted in the halls, asking students to gather in the LeMans lobby at 4 p.m.. By the time Duggan arrived, approximately 300 freshmen, sophomores and juniors were waiting. Duggan said he had been unaware of many of the housing changes and arranged an immediate meeting with Director of Housing Pat Rissmeyer. 
The decision Duggan and Ris­smeyer made to unblock rooms was effective immediately, in time for last night's junior room picks. 
Sophomore Class Treasurer Janet Biegel helped to write the petition and was one of the officers to meet with Duggan personally. She said Duggan seemed to be misinformed on the background ofthe housing in­tegration plan but after talking with the students he was anxious to straighten the situation out. Duggan told Biegel after his meeting to speak with Rissmeyer or Dean of Students Sr. Karol Jackowski about any changes that were made. According to Biegel, Rissmeyer said rooms were unblocked "in light of the number ofpetitions and the number ofstudents present to meet with Dr. Duggan." 
Many students had not been opposed to the integration ofdorms. hut "just to the way it was handled." This year's freshmen and sopho­mores were to he the classes most affected by the change. Many claimed that they thought sections were going to be blocked off instead of individual rooms until the housing maps were posted in the Lemans lobby. 
Duggan would not comment on 
the housing changes, and Rissmeyer 
and Jackowski were unavailable. 


Lecture addresses porn problem 
By LESLIE HANNA 
News Staff 
The presence of pornography in American society is a response to the age-old laws of supply and demand, according to Fr. Bruce Rit­ter, the director ofCovenant House, a rescue-protection agency operat­ing-in New York Citv. 
During last Sunday afternoon's lecture in the Library Auditorium Ritter explained to a large audience, "Our kids are not the problem. We, the adults, are the problem. Our kids become the problem only when they adopt our values, when they agree sex is entertainment." 
As the Covenant House director, Ritter operates shelters for the homeless youths of New York City. The Under 21 shelter is one of the 
best known. 
"We have a sex industry in this 
country because we want one," said 
Ritter, whose lecture was sponsored 
by the Law School. The attitudes 
propagating this system are more 
wide-spread than might be ex­
pected, he continued. Again, it is a 
pervasive middle class attitude of 
sex as entertainment that lies behind 
the industry. 
Ritter gave several examples of how sex is used as entertainment in the U.S.. The biggest market for home videotapes is in hard core por­nography. Daily television program­ming also reveals the overwhelming American demand for sex as amuse­ment. 
Ritter spoke ofthe Broadway play, Oh! Calcutta, saying that for four­teen years millions of Americans have paid $25 to watch naked young bodies on stage imitating acts of sodomy and call it sophisticated, high class entertainment. Down the street, others pay 25 cents to see a peep-show. Morally, there is really no difference between the two ac­tions, he commented. 
The situation is hopeless until we change our attitudes, according to Ritter, who claims the primary problems are moral and ethical, not economic. 
Ritter's background in medieval theology and his former professorial position at Manhattan College did not lead him to discovering the needs of the poor. Rather, a direct confrontation between he and his students caused a change in con­sciousness and a change in careers. The student body president inter­rupted Mass one Sunday as Ritter finished a sermon on zeal and com­mittment. Standing up, the student charged Ritter with not practicing what he preached himself. Ritter, stunned, thought about it. 
He quickly concluded the student was right, and moved to a tem:ment apartment on the Lower East Side. Soon, runaways, flocked to his door seeking protection in increasing numbers daily. He bought bunk beds, but very soon needed more room and more help. 
Ritter returned to Manhattan Col­lege and asked his former students to come help; to practice what they preached. They did, and Covenant House was born. 
"Covenant House is not a hideout, a hangout. It is a·t;anctuary," said Rit­ter. The shelter operates on a no­questions asked basis. 
"There are no strings on the kids," explained Ritter. "We make a covenant with them, not a contract. We're saying to them 'We're glad you're here. We hope you stay. Don't go away.' We have very serious policies about no drugs, no violence." As the name indicates, the crisis center operates on a fun­damental agreement, or covenant. 


Counselor says students need to speak up about drinking 
Editor's Note: The following is the first in a series offour articles examining the role of alt·obol on the Notre Dame campus and proposals to implement a new alcohol policy. 
ByJOE INCARDONA 
StaffReporter 
The committee has polled, talked, ques­tioned and interviewed, but an expert on al­cohol abuse here says that the Committee on the Responsible llse of Alcohol still has not received enough input from students in its at­tempt to draft an alcohol policy for Notre Dame. 
"I think the students have to stop blowing in the wind and make their opinions loud and clear now instead of later saying, 'Well, they didn't ask us,' " says Peggy Cronin, an expert consulted by the committee and a counselor at the Counseling and Psychological Services Center. 
"Students quite seriously have a respon­

sibility to speak up and say what suggestions they have," she says. 
The committee, formed last spring by Provost Timothy O'Meara, is one of the recommendations of the Priorities and Com­mitments for Excellence report, a detailed description of goals for the University released in November 1982 by O'Meara. Father William Beauchamp, administrative as­sistant to the executive vice president, chairs the committee. 
Cronin, hired as Notre Dame's first alcohol counselor in 1975, believes there are widespread problems with drinking on campus. She sees the condition as stemming from the attitudes students develop toward al­cohol while at Notre Dame. 
"There are a lot of alcohol-related problems," says Cronin. "Part of that is be: cause this university -in its style, its manners and its history -is openly a drinking com­munity. It does not frown on drunkenness, but instead accepts it. That's the flaw." 
Cronin cites a survey conducted by an al­cohol researcher at Indiana University which found that approximately seven percent '.>f students who drink will become either severe alcohol abusers or alcoholics, while about ten percent ofall drinkers will become problem drinkers. 
"From what I've seen here, I would guess that we're probably not at seven percent ­we may be closer to ten percent, because of the acceptance ofdrunkenness," she notes. 
"The attitude is really the key," says Cronin. "Ifstudents are tired ofseeing drunkenness as a habitual thing that's allowed in the dorm. then they are the ones who can turn it around." 
However, Cronin does not have any problems with those students who drink moderately. "That is what alcohol is about ­

Hall rectors must learn the lessons of time 
It takes talent to be a good rector or rectress -talent which a few hall staff members sorely lack. 
Sometime during the year, students hav~: a chance to appraise hall staff members with evaluation forms. For the most part, students get along well with the dorm staff and list ft:w complaints. 
But in a few dorms, people run out of ink before "speaking" their minds. The process resembles student evaluations ofsome tenured professors -complain all you want, but nothing will change. There is mort: to managing a dorm than being a good den mother or drill sergeant, how~:ver. 
Notre Dame has an age-old legacy of drill-sergeant 
rectors. Talk to any alumnus from the 50s and you'll 
ht:ar plenty ofstorks about rectors and their antics. 
One reportedly wort: a shoe and a sock so ht: could 
race down tht: hall, though he seemed to be walking 
ratht:r slowly. Trying to out­
smart the rectors who were 
dents who break parietals, 
trying to outsmart the stu­
have a bit to learn about the 
dents was half the fun of dorm life. 
In the 60s, however, stu­dents decided to challenge the authority of rectors, 
mad~: with a letter to all 6,700 students over Easter break. This so-called "Winter of our Discontt:nt" message was heard round 
the nation when it was reprinted in the National Ob­server and quoted in Time. 
Both sides had a point. Students were tired of having the religious, many of whom were unqualified as staff members, scattered throughout the dorms. After all, they argued, being a priest or brother isn'tprima facie proof that one can lead a community. 
Hesburgh was quick to add it wasn't a prima facie indictment either. 
In one passage he asked students why they were so upset: "if anyone seriously believes he cannot become well educated here without a car, or girls in his room, or if.one really thinks his personal freedom is impossibly restricted by curfew, or state laws on drinking, or the presence of prksts in the residence halls, then I think the only honest reaction is to get free of Notre Dame, not to expect Notre Dame to lose its unique character

The Congregation of Holy Cross no longer runs the 
University, and hi-education has been a part of Notre 
Dame for twelve years now. But students still complain 
about religious staff who, in their eyes, are unfit for the 
job. 

Many complaints are reasonable. Those rectors who 
threatt:n freshmen during the orientation week or, even 
worse, stay up all night on Fridays and Saturdays, finding 
inventive ways to catch stu­
foundations of Christian

The Univ~:rsity also has had its shart: of alcoholic staff members in recent years, many of whom are ,..;;. religious. Such rectors and rectresses often arc popular 
with students. Unable to handle their own prohkms, many alcoholics turn thdr backs on students and, for some reason, fare incredibly well on evaluations. 
Perhaps the solution which students offered in the early 60s was a hit extreme. But 22 years later, the campus still has a few rectors and rectresst:s who, wt:re it not for their vows, never would be in the public rela­tions business. 
Maybe tht: University should be a bit more selective in the future, choosing those with talents before giving spots to religious who want the jobs. 
With any luck, we have passed the days ofHesburgh's "get free ofNotre Dame" solution.

Senate postpones election decision 

By CAROL CAMP 
Senior StaffReporter 
At last night's Senate meeting, Ombudsman Director Andy Tucker and Judicial Coordinator Bob Gleason announced that the guidelines for future student body elections will be determined at a later date. 
Tucker clarified OBUD's position on the controversy surrounding last week's student body electons: 
"Basically, we believe that rules should be equally applied to everyone ... it is the opinion of the Steering Committee that we will not leave OBUD open to charges of un· fairness." 
Judicial Coordinator Bob Gleason 
commented that "although I regret the promotion the issue got in the Observer, I don't regret having brought it up." 
In other business, the Senate ap· proved an amendment to a proposal increasing the number of representatives on the Student Uni­on Steering Committee. In addition to the committee's present member­ship, the outgoing Student Union Director and Comptroller will have input in selecting the organization's new officers. Also, outgoing com­missioners will have a voice in choosing their successors. Chair­men of newly created committees will be chosen by the members of the Steering Committee as well as by the half of the Student Body Presi-
dent/Vice President combination that does not regularly serve as a Steering Committee member. 
Once again, Student Union Direc­tor Dave Drouillard advocated the addition oftwo Student Union Com­missioners as voting members ofthe Senate. Despite previous support for the proposal, it was was defeated by a vote of6-11. 
Drouillard expressed his dissatis­faction with the Senate's decision by saying that he was "extremely dis­pleased" with the result ofthe vote. 
Finally, the Senate passed a resolu­tion requesting that the beginning of the academic year be moved from the last Monday in August to the fourth Monday.

it's for people 
who can and know how to use it 
without hooking into it out of a 

need," she says. "Rather than asking if people should engage in respon­sible drinking, I think a choice has to .be made. There are people who can and do drink responsibly, but there ,are some who, when they make their choice, are not capable of being 
responsible drinkers." 
Cronin is not sure which ofthe al­
ternatives proposed by the alcohol 
committee would be most effective. 
She does agree with the committee, 
however, that the present situation 


concerning the use of alcohol on campus does warrant a change in policy. 
"I guess really if we're going to be straight we need to go with the state law, meaning it needs to be a '21' campus," says Cronin. "But that's the dilemma -it's going to be kind ofa police job, and I think that stinks." 
Cronin believes social functions which focus on drinking have in­fluenced much ofthe concern about the present alcohol policy. This year's resident assistants met with an alcohol study group from Michigan State last September, and Cronin says that alcohol-based parties was one ofthe major topics discussed. 
"What they talked about was if there are social occasions where al­cohol is served, the occasion should be for something -it shouldn't be primarily a drinking party," says Cronin. She also points out that regulations calling for I 5 percent of the party budget to be spent on non­alcoholic beverages and another ten percent on food have not been en­forced very effectively, a factor which tends to make drinking the focus ofactivity at social functions. 
Cronin believes the al­cohol committee will not be able to find a viable solution overnight "I rather doubt they'll come up with something this year," Cronin said. "I think in the coming months they will try to firm up something on a long-term basis. I would guess by the following year they might come up with something that can be lived with in terms of rules."

A voiding grief's plunge toward self -pity

mankind in having to grieve. It is no consola­tion that the t·xpericnces of loss, pain and suffering arc universal. 
What is not universal is the response each individual fashions from the ubiquitous prest·nn· of loss. Many recover while others lx:come pnmant·nt t·asualties. All people are inter-dependent in their struggle for balance when grt·at loss conu·s. We do need each other. 
As we love, we share. As we share, we help each other. A personal example will show how very mm:h another person's courage hdpt·d lift mt· from a degree ofself-pity that, at times, approachcd despair. 
In April. I was on the campus of the Univer­sity of Wyoming. A heavy snowfall of the prc­vious day was already beginning to melt. Fratt·rnity row was alive with young mcn strippnl to thc waist basking in the dclights of a bright mid-day sun. 

Amplified to the seventh power, the blare of music erupted from each frat house and carried far across campus. Following the long days of winter, spring is always welcome in Wyoming. School would soon be out. The campus was in a fcstiv~ mood. 
Anoon visit in Mcintyre Hall with one ofmy daughters had been difficult. Her sadness was a painful reminder ofthc sadness present in all members ofmy family. I felt the need to take a walk to siphon offsome of my sorrow. 
The music along fraternity row penetrated my soul as noise and discordant sound. I remember weeping and being embarrassed as passing students saw this. As I walked, I felt 
worse. 

"God," I asked amidst tears, "why have I been stricken so? Why is my burden so much greater than the burden ofothers?" 
Across the quad, about 30 students, men of Sigma Chi, were having a kcggcr party on their front lawn. As I passed their house, I tjukkcncd my pace to avoid further embar­rassment. I felt totaJiy alien to the joyous rite ofspring going on all about me. I hurried to a meeting that I had no desire to attend. 
From the corner of my eye, I saw my pace being matched by that ofa young man coming across the wet snow toward me. 
"You sure look sad, Mister; I'll bet a beer will help. Please join us?" I mumbled some­thing about "thanks, but no thanks." It should have been clear to him that I wanted to be left 
alone to walk in the abyss ofmy grief. I walked 
faster. 
"Arc you sure, mister?" he called after me. 

"We have plenty ofhot dogs and hamburgers. 
We'd love to have you join us. Are you sure 
you don't want anything?" I thought: "Of 
course I am sure. Arc you blind? Can't you sec 
I want to be left alone?" 
I hesitated just a moment. I turned to look at 

him more closely. He was not the usual col­
lege student. He was not at all like the other 
young men in his group. He had no arms. I 
looked more closely to be certain his arms 
were really missing and not just tucked inside 
a coat. There were no arms. 
He stood erect and armless while telling me that I looked sad As he smiled, he said a beer would go a long way toward making me feel better. His manner and his words suggested that having arms wasn't all that important. 
I knew I must join him and his friends. He looked pleased; I felt ashamed. My spirits shifted just a bit and I did welcome his invita­tion "to dive in." 
Over an outdoor grill, we shared ex­periences. I had lost daughters and he had been born of a mother who had taken thalidomide during her pregnancy. Yes, it had been difficult for him eversince birth and, yes, he knew it would continue to be difficult for him throughout his life. 
Other handicaps were part of his thalidomide syndrome. But his mind and his spirit had been spared and they sparkled in the high country sun ofwhat had become for me a much more promising day. 
His friends joined in our visit. They were enrolled in pre-law, pre-med, agriculture, a broad range ofcollegiate courses. This young man was studying social work. My opinion of the young, of his generation, sometimes am­bivalent in the past, soared. My pride in our state and in our university was evident. 
Helen Keller wrote from the prison of her blindness: "Self-pity is our worst enemy and if we yield to it, we can never do anything wise in the world." 
It is in submission to self-pity that we com­mit a crime against our nature. To yield to this powerful force compounds any problem. In so doing, any chance we have of gaining wis­dom from our suffering is lost. 
As I left the front lawn of the Sigma Chi house, I continued to grieve but the example ofmy young friend transfused me. Jt felt like a cool cloth on a fevered brow. As I walk into the New Year, often alone and in sadness, the memory ofmy young friend walks with me.l

Of elevators and times tables 
Two students, Adam and Julie, are waiting for an elevator on thc seventh floor of the library. Thcy havc not spoken to each other bdilrt·. 

Michael Varga Eavesdropping 

ADAM: Where do these elevators go? Jlii.IE: (startled at first) I... I heard that they haVl· a carrl'l on tht· thirtccnth floor. (lJoth lm1gb a hitnen'OUS~}'. ) ADAM: Just think ofall this time we waste. J liLIE: Ycs, hut at least it gives us an cxeuse for hdng late to class. ADAM: But this is just not productive.

Dear J!ditor: 
I laving rcn·ntly joined the faculty of thc Thcology Department at Notre Damc after twt·nty·two years of teaching in a major Prott·stant tht·ological seminary as an United Methodist ministcr. I think your lt'ad articlc in the l't·b. 17 issue is most misleading. 
It would bt· presumptuous to sp(:ak for thc othcr Protestant members of tht· Theol­ogy Department, hut I myself have:· never 


when I'd be riding with my Dad in his car. We would do the teens times tables. ADAM: What? JUI.IE: You know, the seventeen times table,. t(Jr example. Seventeen times one, seventeen times two, and so on. ADAM: And you call that productive, huh? JULIE: Sure. ADAM: Wcll, I'll trust my calculator the next time I need to know what seventeen timcs twelve is. )l!I.II!: Two hundred and four. ADAM: Is that right? JULIE: You wouldn't have to ask if you and your Dad had done the teens times tahlcs!(laughing ) " ADAM: I never knew my Dad. My parents were divorccd when I was a baby. 
JUUE: Oh, I'm...I'm sorry... I didn't mean to... ADAM: It's OK. My Mom knew her times tables! (chuckling) So...what could we do that would be productive? JULIE: Ifyou don't like times tables, how about state capitals? ADAM: You've got to be kidding. JULIE: No, it can be fun. What's the capital of Pennsylvania? ADAM: Two hundred and four. 


BoxQ 
known any instance in my two years ofteach­ing herc in which I was treated as anything lt'ss than a "first-class ...citizen" by the Depart­ment, nor do Isense any desire whatsoever for "phasing out Protestant theology in the dcpartment." Indeed, I happen to be teaching Rcfi1rmation sacramental theology this semes­ter. 
As a tenured faculty member at full profes­sor rank, I certainly do not expect the ecumenical character of the Department to disappear nor would I have left a tenured posi­tion elsewhere ifl expected such to happen.

ADAM: So now I'm ready to graduate, is that it? 
Of course, the only question I'll be asked in ADAM: (to ]UUE) Go ahead. I'll catch the 
job interviews will be: "Young man, what is seventeen times twelve?" JULIE: (smiling) You never know when it might come up! But you don't know what the capital ofPennsylvania is, do you? ADAM: Harrisburg. JULIE: I'm impressed. Your Mom knew her capitals, too. ADAM: Not quite. I was born in Pittsburgh. 
How about you? JUUE: Atlanta. Hey look! One is finally arriv­ing! ADAM: And it's going our way. Down! JUUE: Well, this has been fun. By the way, what's your name? ADAM: It doesn't have to end here. JULIE: That's quite a name. The computer must chop offtwo thirds ofit on your records. What do they call you for short? ADAM: Adam. No ...1 mean...we can chat in the elevator. 
JULIE: Come on! You must be new here. No one talks in an elevator.

(The elevator doors close and the elevator disappears) 
ADAM: We arc going to he late for cla.o;s. JULIE: You're right. But mine is a math clat;s and we're reviewing the seventeen tim_!;s table. I can afford to he late. ADAM: Quick! What's seventeen times seven­teen? JULIE: Seventeen squared! ADAM: Aha! You don't know. JULIE: My Dad and I weren't that productive. 
(!tnother elevatorarrives, and this time there is room for the two students. As they enter it, Adam whispers tojulie.) 
ADAM: Two hundred and eighty-nine. Now you'll never forget it. 
(Julie smiles atAdam as the doors close, and they silently descend to thefirst floor. )

Clubs 
continuedfrom page 8 
the: rugby club seems ready to gain 
another bt·rth in the: Nationals. 
The: Crt·w club has also had an ex· 
cc:ptional year. Before: competition 
even started, the: team encountered 
its first succc:s.'i. A new boathouse 
was compktc:d, filling a void for the 
club. It is located downtown along 
the river in Viewing Park, ncar the 
Century Center. 
The: team also anJuirc:d many new 
boats, a great hdp since the: club has 
expanded quickly. A total of 40 
novice men and 2'i novice women 
are now on the team, with "novice" 
describing a member with less than 
I 0 months of crt·w experience at 
Notre Dame. 
The rest of the club is made up of 16 varsity men and 12 varsity women. "Varsity" describes a mem­ber with more than 10 months ex­perience. 
The main race for the varsity members during the: fall was The Head of the Charles, which took place in Boston, Mass.The men's heavyweight boat took twentieth place out of 40 teams, while the women's heavyweight entry was 13 out of tht· 26 teams entered. 
The: men's novice: team competed in the: Frostbite Regatta in Philadel­phia, Pa. and finished 12 out of 27 entries. 
Crew coach John Thompson was pkasc:d with the results. "We were racing some crew teams, such as Harvard, that compete on a much higher level, with hundreds ofmem­bers and a huge budget,"he said. 
One bright spot for the club this year has been the accomplishment of team member John Younger, a junior. He was recently selected to join a 40-member U.S. Lightweight Team after being tested at a regional competition center in Madison, Wis. 
At a summer camp in Princeton, N.J., Younger will compete for one 

of 16 spots on the U.S. team that will 
participate in the lightweight crew 
world championships in Europe. 
As spring draws near, the team will ready itself for a busy season by spending Spring Break in Austin, Tx. While there, they will practice and compete with eight other crew teams. 
The team will then participate in races almost every weekend after that, finishing up the season with the Mid-west Sprints in Madison. This race will consist of 26 crew teams, and according to Thompson "will basically be the Md-west champion­ship." 
Medals will be awarded to the top three finishers in the race, and Thompson feels that both the men's varsity and the men's novice teams "have definite potential for medals." The expectations seem to be realis­tic, since the club did beat all of its Mid-west competition at the race in Boston in the fall.
