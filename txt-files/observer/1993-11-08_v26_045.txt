Weekend Wheels up and running despite cuts 
By LIZ FORAN 
News Writer 
The Weekend Wheels pro­gram started up again last weekend despite budgeting cuts and lack of interest which had made it doubtful that the program would run again this year, according to Jackie Macy, co-chair of Hall President's Council (HPC). 
"We are very excited about it," she said. 
Weekend Wheels transports students from several off-cam­pus sites such as popular bars, Lafayette Square and Turtle Creek safely back to campus. It was begun two years ago by HPC as an alternative trans­portation and an attempt to re­duce driving while intoxicated, said Macy. 
HPC funds the program at a cost of nine thousand dollars per year. Last year, Student 
Government cut the funds allot­ted to HPC for this program be­cause of a decline in riders and in the hope that the Taxi Voucher system would be in effect by now, said Chris Canzoniero, co-chair of HPC. 
A lack of publicity was cited as one of reasons for the decline in students using Weekend Wheels, according to Macy. 
HPC petitioned the Student Senate for more funds for the Weekend Wheels program, ac­cording to Macy. After the ap­proval of additional funds, HPC began an extensive publicity campaign, which includes the signs, posters and ads which appear around campus stating times, pick-up sites and drop­off points, she said. 
"It is a valuable program," said Canzoniero. "We are happy that it is being given

While several Notre Dame professors agree that a publi­cation like The Guide serves as a useful tool for undergradu­ates as they choose their cours­es, faculty members also recog­nize that a portion of its success depends on their own participa­tion. 
"It seems to me that the in­formation it provides is quite useful," said Professor Paul Weithman of the Philosophy department. "What I am sorry about is that there isn't a wider range of professors included." 
Professor Hichard Sheehan, chair of the Faculty Senate, agreed. "It is disappointing that more faculty didn't participate. The students clearly went 

Reno urges nation to refocus on children 
By SARAH DORAN 
Assistant News Editor 
Urging all Americans to re­focus themselves on their own families and also on children who are less fortunate, Attorney General Janet Reno called for an investment in the nation's most precious resource -its children -in an interac­tive telecast aired nationwide yesterday. 
The telecast, "Home Improvement: Building Family Esteem," was the eighth in the biennial series on the family. which is sponsored and pro­duced by the Notre Dame Alumni Association. 
"Too often as a nation and as a family we have forgotten our children," said Reno, whose career has been marked by a focus on children and family is­sues. "We must reacquaint ourselves to this most impor­tant resource." 
"Schools and parents must reach out and serve as mentors to the children," said Reno, mentioning her frequent trips 



Objectivity key to faculty confidence 
By KATIE MURPHY 
News Writer 

A combination of consistent objectivity and accuracy is the key to gaining the faculty's con­fidence in a student evaluation handbook such as The Guide, according to David Nuscher, the 1991-93 editor-in-chief of the CUE, Harvard University's stu­dent evaluation book. 
"We just make it clear that 
through a lot of work to put it together." 
Approximately 65 professors are published in this first edi­tion of The Guide, and over 80 classes are featured. Last spring student government sent 
to Washington, D.C. area schools to interact with kids. 
Reno stressed the importance of the family leave programs like that of her former work­place, the Dade County (Fl.) State Attorney's office, as being models to bridge the gap of family unity that exists for many 'latch' key children. 
Also among the program's featured guests were the best-­selling authors of How To Talk So Kids Will Listen and Listen So Kids Will Talk, Adele Faber and Elaine Mazlish, and a panel of speakers including Miguel Franco, assistant pro­fessor of psychology at Notre Dame, Huth Warren, liaison for parents education with the South Bend School Corporation, Augustus Jordan, a South Bend psychologist specializing in family therapy and child de­pression, and Mary Roemer, a South Bend therapist in private practice. 
The panel and guests ad­dressed questions based on their model of family self es­teem, whose five components we publish what we find,'' said Nuscher. "There are always a few (professors) who do not understand the rigorous edito­rial processes that our reviews go through. It is the professor's problem... if students have criticized his or her perfor­mance." 
The CUE, backed by a 25­year history, was the model for The Guide. Notre Dame stu~ dent government's new course

"The primary goal of a family is to launch kids into adulthood and to do so it must provide a sense of where they are going," said Franco. 
Warren also stressed the need for goal setting in families to set a sense of purpose. 
"Internal motivations in the family serve to identify its iden­tity," she said. 
Both Faber and Mazlish stressed the importance of de­veloping a unity in the family that encourages a autonomy of its members. 
"Families must hear each other out," said Faber. "They must listen to the feelings of the other people openly." 
The telecast was transmitted via satellite to more than 1000 schools, a potential 20 million cable viewers, 150 church groups, and 200 alumni clubs. Copies will be available in December for $25.

Some professors may have wanted to see the end result before they took part, because a past effort at a student eval­uation book was fairly "unpro­fessional," said Arnold. 
However. several instructors thought The Guide was an im­provement over past attempts.

INSIDE COLUMN WORLD AT AGLANCE 


Ack! 'Bloom County' fans refllefllber 
Four years ago this month, Opus the Penguin made a surprise, albeit dis­heartening, appeara'nce in the comic strip Ziggy. Opus's cameo in Tom Wilson's comic strip might have been humorous had Opus not recently lost his "ob as the star of Bloom County. On Aug. 6, 1989, the doors of one of the world's most famous bach­elor pads, the Bloom Boarding House, had closed forever. 
Opus and Ronald-Ann, his small traveling companion, were shipped ofT to Outland, along with the infamous Bill the Cat. But the voices o Milo, Binkley, Steve Dallas, Cutter John, Portnoy, Oliver Wendall Jones and many other memorable characters were silenced forever when Berke Breathed ended the strip with a heartwarming and nostalgic final week. I gasped in horror as I awoke one morning to find the comic strip Cathy in the slot where my eyes had been glued for years. 
Bloom County fans know in their hearts that Outland pales in comparison to its predecessor, which might have been the best political car­toon of all time. Although die-hard fans love Breathed, we also know that Outland tries to be too much all at once. It falls into the category o an inept, albeit amusing, spinoiT. Outland is to Bloom County as Joanie Loves Chachie was to Happy Days. 
Bloom County perfected the art of the political lampoon. It was both subtle and direct, hilari­ous and poignant. The only thing Bloom County asked of its reader was to accept the fact that a dysfunctional black family, a dysfunctional white family, a perverted bachelor and a truck­load of animals could live togther under one roof. 
Bloom County mercilessly and tactlessly slashed out at all that is wrong in the world: inept politicians, whiny self-interest groups, nauseating PC banner-carriers, racism, the deteriorating American family. You name it, and Bloom County said something about it. But the strip managed to do some things almost no other political strip has done: it was never mean-spirited, and it made you care deeply about its characters. Half the nation must have cried when Opus found out that his real mother was dead. 
The best part of Bloom County, though, was the humor. No strip has ever approached its comic genius. I started reading it in grade school. I laughed my head off then, although I did not understand all of its subtleties. Now I go back and reread the books and roar until it hurts. 
Who else would embarrass the politically cor­rect with such patronizing suggestions changing the name of "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" to "Pitch Black and the Seven Big llonkies?" Who else would chop an old man's head off because he squeezed the Charmin in the grocery store check-out line? 
And who else could dream up Oliver Wendall Jones, the tiny ten-year old prodigy who built an atomic bomb for his gradeschool science fair by scraping "the luminous stuff off 9,700 old glow-in-the dark watch hands?" Berke Breathed and Bloom County. That's who. 
Of the Bloom County gang I can only say this: I miss you all and pray doubtfully for your return. Until then, I guess I'll have to settle for Doonesbury. But I still refuse to read Cathy.

An arrest warrant for Theresa Jimmie Knorr, 47, was circulated Sunday to the National Crime Information Center, said Johnnie Smith, Placer County sheriff's inspector. Authorities were searching for her nation­wide. Knorr allegedly enlist­ed the aid of the two sons in the incineration slaying of one daughter in 1984 and the beating and starvation slaying of the other daughter in 1985.

Tainted blood, needles stolen with Buick 

HIGHLAND, Ind. 
Vials of blood, syringes and needles -all believed tainted by the virus the causes AIDS -were contained in a car that was stolen from a supermarket parking lot. Police broadcast a warning about the automobile's con­tents after a nurse who owns the blue 1988 Buick Skyhawk 2-door reported she had the tainted supplies. The car, which had Illinois plates RF-9840, was reported stolen around 8 p.m. Saturday from the Ultra shopping center in Highland. The nurse later called police after she got home to say that she forgot to report the contents when she reported the car stolen, said police. The nurse said she had drawn blood from homebound HIV patients in her care and was going to turn in the vials of blood to a laboratory for analysis, said police. The nurse wasn't identified.

Those accused of the 1984 and 1985 deaths are not accused of killing Norris, Smith said. But he added that detectives want to take a closer look because of the recent developments.

Son of Sam serial slayer says he's sorry 

NEW YORK 
David Berkowitz. the notorious "Son of Sam" serial killer who terrorized New York, has apologized from prison for his deadly deeds. Berkowitz, 40, said the goal of the 13 shootings-which killed six people -"was to bring chaos to the city... bringing the city of New York to its knees and so forth, which was part of the plan." The shootings began on July 29, 1976 and continued for 13 months. It wasn't until the fourth attack, in January 1977, that police recognized a pattern. Berkowitz was dubbed the ".44-caliber killer." lie left a note at the site of his sixth attack, a double murder. "I am the Son o Sam," he wrote. Sam, he later told police, was Sam Carr, his neighbor, whose dog "told me to kill." The killer's favorite target was women with long dark hair, often parked in lover's lanes after a date. New Yorkers changed their hairstyles and habits to avoid becoming his victim. Police traced a parking ticket issued at one mur­der scene and arrested Berkowitz outside his Yonkers apartment in 1977. He pleaded guilty. lie claims there was a conspiracy, but evidence proves otherwise. 
Everest group fined for not having permit 
KATMANDU, Nepal 
They came, they saw, and they conquered the world's tallest mountain. Then the British expedition was fined $100,000 for not having a permit. Four members of the team scaled Mount Everest last month, even though their government permit was good only for Mount Lhotse, a sister peak that is 926 feet shorter. The fine is twice the amount mountaineers have to pay to climb the 29,028­foot Mount Everest, the Tourism Ministry said Sunday. The offenders were John Scott Mcivor, 39, a British accountant living in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, and Ginette Lesley Harrison, a 35-year-old doctor from Bristol. England. The two reached the peak first Oct. 7. They were followed two days later by Martin Barnicott, 41, a mountain guide from Gwynedd, Wales. and American lumber businessman Lee Nobmann, 43, from Petaluma, Calif.

it should." After seeing this ini­tial publication, however, he would encourage faculty mem­bers to allow their classes to be surveyed. 
Professor John Duman, chair of biological sciences, also sup­ports student government's ef­forts "as long as it's done pro­
fessionally and with the good representation of the students." "The booklet does serve a purpose," said Duman. 
Philosophy Professor William Ramsey echoed Duman's com­ments, although he does have some reservations about the evaluation process. 
"Students do have a right to know what other students think," said Ramsey. "The biggest worry with these things is that they turn into a popular­ity contest for the professors." 
It is necessary for students to 
have access to information 
about instructors, but often­
times students will give higher 
ratings to the more "entertain­
ing" professors who may not 
"provide the greatest informa­
tion or education," according to 
Ramsey. 
"We've all had teachers that ·were not very good, but not all 
teachers are stand-up comics," 
agreed Duman. 

"Student reactions to the pop­ularity of a teacher shouldn't be equated with the quality of the teaching," said Weithman. 
One professor who asked not to be identified and was evalu­ated in The Guide character­ized his experience with the publication as a "disaster." His class discussions depended on teacher assistants (TA's), and when the evaluations of his TA's were included with his av­erage, their rankings brought his overall score down. Compared to all of his past evaluations, his average score in The Guide was the lowest he had ever received. 
"I don't choose my TA's. They are given to me," the professor said. 
Student government also mis­placed the written comments of his students, the professor said, so the numbers could not be placed in context with the sum­mary.

The spokeswoman, who was not identified by name, said among the injured was a

More than 11,000 people, almost all of them black, have been killed in political violence in South Africa in the past three years. Most of the killing has been linked to rivalry between the ANC and Inkatha. 
The SAPA news agency quot­ed an ANC spokeswoman as describing Molefe and his fol­lowers as a "fairly isolated band of ANC members in the middle of an IFP area." 
In Natal Province and espe­cially the Zulu homeland of KwaZulu, younger, urbanized Zulus tend to support the ANC and its goal of a united South Africa with cultural freedoms for minority groups.

Georgian troops leave rebel base 
By LIAM McDOWALL 
Associated Press 

TBILISI, Georgia 
Georgian leader Eduard 
Shevardnadze ordered gov­
ernment troops out of the rebel 
stronghold of Zugdidi on 
Sunday to avoid "unpleasant 
incidents" between his forces 
and the town's residents. 

Shevardnadze's troops cap­tured Zugdidi on Saturday without resistance from forces trying to restore ousted na­tionalist President Zviad Gamsakhurdia. 
"We had to terminate the fas­cist actions of Gamsakhurdia," Shevardnadze said Sunday in Zugdidi while meeting with civilians and policemen. "Now it is high time to restore normal life to Georgia." 
Zaza Kandalaki, a spokesman for the Georgian leader, said the decision to leave Zugdidi in the hands of police was "taken by Shevardnadze to avoid un­pleasant incidents between its 
inhabitants" and government 
troops. 

Last week, Shevardnadze 
promised to try to prevent any 
looting in rebel territory by the 
paramilitary groups that make 
up his army, which has been 
prone to pillaging captured 
towns in the past. 

On Saturday, Georgian Defense Ministry spokesman Giya Chikovani said rebel lead­ers, including Gamsakhurdia, had fled north to Abkhazia, a province controlled by sepa­ratists. But Abkhazian officials denied he was there. 
In five weeks of fighting, Gamsakhurdia's forces had inflicted a series of humililtting defeats on government troops, demoralized by the recent loss of Abkhazia, a rich province along the Black Sea. 
But a week ago, buoyed by support from Russian troops sent to guard railroads and other key facilities in the for­mer Soviet republic, Shevardnadze's forces took the offensive. 
It wasn't clear whether the 
victory would hold. Less than 
two years ago, government 
troops marched into Zugdidi to 
crush Gamsakhurdia's forces. 
Many residents of the area, Gamsakhurdia's home province, continued to wage a guerrilla war. 
On Sunday, four pro­Shevardnadze soldiers and two civilians were killed in a "ter­rorist act" in a village near Khobi, a government-held town in western Georgia, Defense Ministry spokesman Soso Margishvili said on Georgian TV. He gave no further details. 
Shevardnadze's appeal for Russian help has opened him up to the nationalist rebels' ac­cusations he surrendered the country to Moscow. 
Gamsakhurdia was Georgia's first democratically elected president. Accused of dictato­rial rule, he was ousted in a military revolt in January 1992.

PLO official confesses to spying for Israel 
Aasociated Press 
MANAMA, Bahrain 
A PLO communications ex­pert in Tunisia has confessed to spying for Israel. a Saudi newspaper reported Sunday, in the second allegation in a week of an Israeli spy in the 
r>to. 
The new report heightened fears that a full-scale espi­onage network had extensively infiltrated the Tunis headquar­ters of the Palestine Liberation Organization. 
The London-based Arabic daily Asharq Al-Awsat said Mohammed Sadeq. who was in charge of the PLO's radio com­munications service. sur­rendered and confessed last week. 
The communications center in Hamam ei-Chatt. about 20 miles south of Tunis, was re­sponsible for sending PLO Chairman Vasser Ararat's coded messages to his offices around the world. 
The newspaper quoted unidentified ·Palestinian secu­rity sources as saying Sadeq's spying was uncovered follow· ing reports last week that Adnan Yassen, a PLO consular official in Tunis, confessed he worked for Mossad, Israel's spy agency. 
The Asharq Al·Awsat news· paper said PLO .sources would· n't comment further on the new case until an investigation into Yassen was complete. 
Tunisian police found wire­less bugging devices planted by Yassen in PLO offices, PLO sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Saturday. 
The listening devices may have allowed the Israelis to hear PLO strategy sessions for the secret Norway talks this fall on peace plans with Israel. Arafat participated in the ses­sions.

Bank 

Palestinian gunmen opened fire Sunday on a car carrying a prominent right-wing rabbi, killing his driver and injuring the rabbi. 
Jewish settlers responded with protests, a veiled threat to murder Arabs in revenge, and reported shootings of Palestinians. 
Rabbi Haim Druchman, a for­mer legislator of the right-wing National Religious Party, suf­fered light wounds in the arm and shoulder. His driver, Gaza Strip settler Ephraim Ayubi, was killed, the army said. 
They were traveling near the Palestinian village of Beit Kabel outside Hebron when Arabs in a passing vehicle opened fire, the army said. 
It was unclear whether Druchman, a founder of the Gush Emunim settler move­ment, had been targeted. West 
Appeals made before election in Jordan 
By JAMAL HALABY 
Associated Press 
AMMAN, Jordan 
Candidates made last-minute appeals Sunday for votes in Jordan's first multiparty elec­tions since 1956, in which pro­ponents of peace with Israel are expected to retain a major­ity in parliament. 
Monday's elections come af­ter Israeli officials confirmed over the weekend that Jordan and Israel are close to reaching a peace agreement. King Hussein has not yet made any public comment. 
While Muslim fundamental­ists are expected to win the sin­gle largest bloc in the 80-seat lower house of parliament. con­servative and tribal members who support Hussein's pro­peace policy are expected to keep a majority of seats. 
The bicameral legislature must ratify any peace agree­ment, although Hussein retains ultimate authority with the power to dissolve parliament and rule by decree. The 40-seat upper house is appointed by Hussein and normally backs him. 
Jordan and Israel signed an agenda for peace talks on Sept. 14, a day after Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization reached a peace accord that provides for Palestinian self-rule in the oc­cupied territories. 
But while peace has played a role in campaigns, Jordanians appear more concerned with poverty and unemployment. The country is straining under a $6.5 billion foreign debt and $4 billion in losses stemming from 1990-91 Gulf crisis, when trade with Iraq, Jordan's biggest trading partner, was blocked. 
For the most part the cam­paign ended peacefully. Police briefly detained a Muslim fun­damentalist candidate after he and supporters roughed up two members of a moderate Islamic party, the state-run Petra news agency said. 
Candidates held rallies, passed out fliers and pounded the pavement to win support in this nation of 3. 9 million peo­ple. They placed hundreds of ads in the mass circulation Al­Rai daily promising a better fu­ture. 
Thousands of banners re­mained draped over streets and tens of thousands of posters have been plastered on lamp­posts and shop windows. 
The fundamentalist Muslim Brotherhood and leftist groups oppose the U.S.-backed peace process. The Brotherhood ad-

Bank commander Gen. Nehemiya Tamari told re­porters that the shooting had been random. 
The Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a PLO faction led by Nayef Hawatmeh, took responsibility for the at­tack in an announcement in Damascus. Syria. The group opposes the Israel-PLO peace talks. 
But Israel radio said authori­ties believed the attack was carried out by the militant Islamic group Hamas, also op­posed to the peace talks. 
The killing, on a busy road linking Hebron to the Mediterranean coast, was the second in the occupied West Bank in two weeks. The stab­bing of a settler Oct. 29 set off several days of riots. 
Aharon Domb, a spokesman for the settlers, said they would make sure the territories would "roar and tremble as long as Jews are being killed every week." 
In Hebron, Jewish settlers 
from the nearby Kiryat Arba settlement burned Arab cars and rampaged through the market smashing windows, overturning tables and shooting in the air, Arab reporters said. Three Arabs were reportedly treated for bullet wounds in the legs or arms. 
A fourth Palestinian was shot in the chest while driving by Kfar Darom, the Gaza settle­ment where Ayubi lived, Arab reports said. 
Palestinians retaliated with firebomb assaults on Israeli cars in the Jerusalem area and the West Bank, but no one was injured, Israeli reports said. The army erected roadblocks throughout the territories to search for the Arab gunmen and closed off the Hebron area. Most Palestinians were pre­vented from entering Israel, where many work. 
Several hundred settlers tied up traffic in downtown Jerusalem by sitting down in a main road after Ayubi's fu­neral. 
vocates Israel's destruction while the leftists say the pro­cess has failed to provide for a Palestinian state. 
Both groups appear to have failed to turn their opposition into an election winner, even though half the population is of Palestinian descent. Analysts said the lineup in the parlia­ment was unlikely to change much. 
The Brotherhood had 22 seats in the outgoing parlia­ment. It was a thorn in the side of the government, but the chamber largely backed Hussein. The left, meanwhile, is split among communists, Baathists and pan-Arab na­tionalists. 
Tribal leaders, who form the bedrock of Hussein's support, were likely to increase their power. They stand to benefit most from a new one-person, one-vote system that weakens the Brotherhood's electoral backing.

Look; I am here, you are there. I know only what The Observer reports. The Observer reports rites that seem out of place and out of touch. Maybe they are not out of place. In re reading the Sept. 30 article I notice that not all of the stu­dents think that these rites ar, great fun. ·

Should · the students from one dorm be significantly different from an­other? One dorm might excell at fund raisers; another might be known for excellent pre­game food.

Try to make sure that dorm identity does not create a "us vs. them" head set.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Dorm initiation ceremonies smack of dreaded fraternities' 
Dear Editor: 
Artictes from The Observer (Sept. 30 and Oct. 19) prompt this letter of observation and opinion. 
The proclamations from the Office of Student Affairs are of­ten viewed with amusement, indifference, distain, or out­rage. I find it unusual that I concur with Student Affairs on their censure of hall initiations. 
Hall initiations smack of fra­ternalism: i.e. fraternities and sororities. At du Lac, hall initia­tions sound like "closed shop" fraternities_ Admissions says that you can come here; hous­ing tells you where. At colleges and universities where sorori­ties and fraternities exist. alter­natives exist. There is a choice made in rushing and pledging. There are dorms and off-cam­pus for the non Greek inclined. Individuals get to make individ­ual choices. 
Freshman year, especially the first weeks, is a daunting expe­rience. We try to find our place, or our path, that will integrate us into the community at Notre Dame. Any activity that is not totally welcoming should be curtailed. What is good fun to a

VIEWPOINT 
CHARLES RICE RIGHT OR WRONG? 
Gay rights supporters should spread word ofAIDS 
Columnist could be a hypocrite, too 
In the October 14 issue of The Observer, 276 faculty and staff members signed an ad to "affirm our conviction that Notre Dame and Saint Mary's ought to become safer places for those in them who are ad­dressing questions about their sexual orientation." The sign­ers' intention was "to offer some help to the vulnerable." That intention was commend­able. Contrary to their intent, however, the signers rendered a serious disservice to those they sought to serve, the "les­bian, gay, and bisexual mem­bers of our community." 
The main explicit thrust of the ad was to oppose various forms of "harassment" of ho­mosexuals including "physical 
violence." On this point the care, in employment of teach­

"human diversity." 
All the more so with the ho­mosexual tendency, the prac­tice of which is potentially sui­cidal to the participants. According to the Centers for Disease Control, through the end of 1992, 57 percent of adult or adolescent AIDS cases in the United States were homosexual or bisexual men and six percent were homosexual or bisexual IV drug users while 23 percent were other IV drug users. San Francisco officials estimate that, of the 58,000 homosexual men in that city, 43 percent are HIV positive. It takes an aver­age of 8.5 years for someone with HIV to develop AIDS, as they all do, and those with AIDS live an average of 3.5-4 years. 
In the face of this appalling reality, the signers of the ad offered not one word of counsel to homosexuals to avoid the po­tentially suicidal practice of their disordered inclination. And the imprecision of the ad's language invited a justifiable inference that the signers do not regard the homosexual ten­dency as disordered and its practice as intrinsically evil. The ad laments that "Notre Dame and Saint Mary's are not always places where human diversity is comfortably toler­and that its practice is a valid personal option. "If the writer of the ad and any signers intended to convey that impression, they should have had the candor to put those views up front rather than to insinuate them by omis­sion and imprecision. If they had such an implicit agenda, they poorly served the homo­sexuals who can act on the ad's inferences only at peril to their lives as well as their souls. 
If any signers did not intend to convey a benign impression as to the disorder and its prac­tice, they ought to be more careful about signing mass-cir­culated pronouncements, in­cluding especially those printed on lavender paper as this one was. If the signers want to

Dear Editor: 
I must say that Rolando de Aguiar really went out on a limb in his recent Inside Column (The Observer, Nov. 2) by boldly pronouncing that Florida State will trample the Irish on Nov. 13. Let's look at his prediction: FSU, the fa­vorite, will win big. That cer­tainly took a great deal of imag­ination. 
Was there any reason to write this column? Irish fans have been eyeing this game since opening day, hoping that if we could enter it undefeated, we'd have a legitimate shot at the national championship. In two weeks, we will. However, after reading de Aguiar's proclamation, I think I'd rather just scalp my ticket and spend the afternoon watching in­fomercials on the local cable channels. Does he really think

Keith Carlson broke past the Butler defense off a Dean pass and scored to give the Irish the 2-0 halftime lead. 
Though Notre Dame kept the pressure on the Bulldogs throughout the second half, they could not capitalize on a few good scoring opportunities. 
The defense, however, led by midfielders Kevin Adkisson and Tont Richardson, stepped its play up a notch, and shut down any offensive surge that Butler could muster. The installment of freshman Peter Gansler into both games aided the Irish de-

assisting on the first and Daws and Masters assisting on the second. 
Although the score does not indi­cate much of a contest, the Irish were not pleased with their play overall. Petrucelli described it as "lackluster." 
"I think the other team was a lit­tle intimidated and I think we were looking ahead a little bit," he said. 
"By the end of the game we were playing very well," he added, "but there were times in the game when we were having trouble connect­ing." 
"It was difficult for the starting

The Irish advanced to the cham­pionship game after handily defeating Butler in the semifinals on Friday afternoon. 
Both Daws and Masters scored two goals while McCarthy and junior Jodi Hartwig each earned two assists. 
Masters scored first for Notre Dame 30:41 into the first half and was followed six minutes later by Vogel. It was Vogel's first goal of the season. Hartwig and tri-captain Andi Kurek assisted Masters' score and tri-captain Alison Lester and junior Tiffany Thompson assisted Vogel's goal. 
Daws added another goal before

have the talent to do that," said Lanza. "We knew that if no­body scored on us, we'd win." 
To add to the tournament vic­tory, Adkisson, Dean, and Palmer were selected along with Bader and Lanza to the All-Tournament Team. 
With the two victories this weekend Notre Dame improved their record to 15-5. They will receive their seed in the NCAA tournament later this after­noon.

Beth Crauder put the Bulldogs on the board 11:19 into the second half and cut the Irish lead to 3-1. 
Daws responded five minutes later with another Irish insurance goal and Masters secured the vic­tory with just over 15 minutes remaining. 
"We were hungry on Friday," Petrucelli said. "I was really happy with the way we played."

Although not completely satisfied with the power play (only 1 of 29 on the season), Schafer did notice some improvement. "It was at least a threat tonight," he said. 
"The theme for the night was hard work," said Schafer. "We won the battle for the loose pucks. We worked hard enough to win." 
Mason, who is college hock­ey's winningest coach, saw the same hustle from the Irish. "If they play like that they're going to have some success this year," said Mason.

"Louder came up with the crucial saves all night," agreed Mason. 

Both coaches were actually pleased with the tie. Mason was happy to escape the

Dallas honors Landry, then posts sixth straight win l 
Associated Press "There's no tear," Cowboys week against Philadelphia. New England at Foxboro. Moon, benched earlier this 
On a day when the Dallas Cowboys remembered their past, they reminded everyone why they may be the NFL's team of the present, too. 
Former coach Tom L a n d r y returned to T e x a s Stadium for the first time since he was 


fired almost 
Emmitt Smith 

five· years ago by new owner Jerry Jones, and saw the Cowboys dominate the New York Giants 31-9 Sunday. 
Landry came back to be pre­sented as the eighth member of the Dallas Cowboys Ring of Honor. He coached the team for its first 29 seasons, won 270 games and led it to five Super Bowls. 
"I have no animosity," Landry said. "Considering what Jerry paid for the team he had the right to do anything he wanted to. I'm happy with the way the Cowboys are going now. The hard feelings are over." 
Landry watched as his suc­cessor, Jimmy Johnson, used Emmitt Smith and Troy Aikman to lead the defending Super Bowl champions to their sixth straight win. 
Aikman, however, left with a strained left hamstring midway through the third quarter. His status for next week's game against Phoenix is uncertain. 
trainer Kevin O'Neill said. "We want to see how he responds in 24 to 48 hours. It will tell us more. But I wouldn't rule out the possibility he will play next week against Phoenix." 
Cowboys 31, Giants 9 
Aikman completed his first 10 passes, including two touch­downs to Alvin Harper,.before hurting himself with 9:30 left in the third quarter and Dallas ahead 17-6. Aikman went down while being chased by defensive end Keith Hamilton. 
Jason Garrett replaced Aik­man and completed 5 of 6 pass­es for 34 yards. He guided Dallas on its last two touch­down drives, both capped by short runs by Smith. 
Smith ran for 117 yards on 24 carries despite a bruised shoulder. The Cowboys are 6-0 since starting 0-2 without Smith. They moved one game ahead of New York {5-3) in the NFC East. 
Phil Simms and backup Kent Graham combined to throw for 214 yards and were sacked five times. 
Jets 27, Dolphins 10 
The Jets. who have beaten 
Shula more than any other 
team, did it again in East 
Rutherford, N.J. The Jets have 
won 21 times against Shula, 
including a victory over the 
Baltimore Colts in the third Su­
per Bowl. 
The Dolphins are 6-2, with 
both losses to New York Shula 
will try for his 325th win next 
Boomer Esilison completed 23-of-32 passes for 256 yards and three touchdowns for the Jets {4-4). 
For the first time since Dan Marino was lost for the season with an Achilles tendon injury, Scott Mitchell flopped as Mi­ami's quarterback. Mitchell, the AFC Offensive Player of the Month for October, was 23-for­44 for 293 yards, much of it after the game had been de­cided. 
Broncos 29, Browns 14 
John Elway once again led Denver over Cleveland, throw­ing a season-high three touch­down passes. 
The Broncos (5-3) have 14 of their last 16 against the Browns (5-3). Elway is 9-2 in that time, including three dramatic wins in AFC championship games. 
Elway leads the NFL with 15 touchdown passes, only seven away from his career high set in 1985. He passed for 244 yards in guiding the AFC's highest-scoring team. 
Bernie Kosar returned as 
Cleveland's starting quarter­
back, but the Browns still en­
dured their most lopsided home 
loss in Bill Belichick's three 
years as coach. Kosar threw 
two scoring passes to Michael 
Jackson. 
Bills 13, Patriots 10 
Steve Christie kicked the ty­
ing field goal with 14 seconds 
left in regulation and booted a 
32-yard field goal 9:22 into 
overtime, lifting Buffalo over

The Bills (7-1) rallied from a 10-0 deficit in the fourth quar­ter and won their fifth straight game. The Patriots (1-8) have lost four in a row and have dropped five games by three points or less. 
Jim Kelly started the game­winning drive with a 46-yard completion to Andre Reed to the New England 19. Thurman Thomas ran twice for 5 yards, and Christie made the winning kick on third down. 
Christie tied it with a 27­yard kick in the closing seconds of regulation. 
Lions 23, Buccaneers 0 
Barry Sanders, focusing on football rather than finances, ran for 187 yards and the De­troit (2-6) defense posted its first shutout in 10 years. The win at the Silverdome made the Lions 7-2, their best start since 1962. Tampa Bay fell to 2-6. 
Sanders carried 29 times in the second-best rushing game of his career. His status for the upcoming bye week is uncer­tain because of a contract dis­pute, and one of Sanders' agents says he would not be surprised if the star running back walks out. 
Raiders 16, Bears 14 
Kevin Butler missed a 30­
yard field goal attempt on the 
final play of the game as Los 
Angeles held off Chicago's late 
rally at Soldier Field. 
Jim Harbaugh threw a 13­
yard touchdown pass to Terry 
Obee with 1:13 to play, cutting 
the Raiders' lead to two points. 
The Bears then recovered an 
onside kick and moved down to 
the 2. 

The Bears ran two plays be­

also missed from 21 yards with 
5:21 remaining. 
Jeff Jaeger kicked three field 
goals for the Raiders (5-3). 
Chicago (3-5) lost its third in a 
row.

season at New England, com­pleted his first eight passes and fmished 36 of 55. He threw two interceptions, both into the Seattle {5-5) end zone. Moon threw for 300 yards for the 37th time in his career. Only Dan Fouts and Dan Marino have done it more often. 
Chargers 30, Vikings 17 
Natrone Means ran for 105 yards, including the go-ahead touchdown early in the fourth quarter, and San Diego beat Minnesota at the Metrodome. 
The Chargers (4-4) won their second in a row. Last year, they rebounded from an 0-4 start and won the AFC West with an 11-5 mark. 
The defending NFC Central champion Vikings (4-4), who blew a 14-point lead in the fourth quarter last week against Detroit, fell 2 1/2 games behind the Lions. 
Means gained 89 yards in the fourth quarter. His 7-yard run with 10:12 left put the Chargers ahead 23-17. 
John Friesz passed for 268 yards and two scores for San Diego. 
Steelers 24, Bengals 16 
Neil O'Donnell put Pittsburgh 
in a 16-point hole with poor 
play early in the game, then 
rallied the Steelers to victory in 
Cincinnati. 
The Steelers (5-3) made 
their biggest comeback under

gals fell to 0-8 for the third time 
in franchise history. 
Darryl.Williams intercepted 
O'Donnell's pass and returned 
it for a 97-yard touchdown in

halftime, and went on to lead 
Pittsburgh to its sixth straight 
win over the Bengals.

season, the Irish were 1-5-1 versus ranked opponents. 
The big question for the Irish this season is not whether they will be invited, but rather to where they will be invited. 
The squad hopes to host the first two rounds of the tourna­ment at home in Alumni Field. 
The team is 19-2 and ranked first in the Central Region. The Irish will play the first two rounds against Central Region opponents, against which they have a 36 game winning streak. 
Typically, the highest seeded team is awarded the home field advantage for tournament games. However, the NCAA may strip Notre Dame of this right due to conflicts caused by this weekend's football game with Florida State.

Previously, only the Final Four was held at a single site. Only once in the past 12 sea­sons has the top seeded team been stripped of the right to host the games. 
Petrucelli said that it would not be fair for the NCAA to award the games to another team because Notre Dame has already solved problems such as parking, traffic and hotel ac­commodations. 
"I think that we've made a great effort at showing the committee that we can pull this thing off," he said. "If the com­mittee is fair, there shouldn't be a reason why we can't host 
it. .. The team is also emphasizing the fact that the enormous me­dia contingency which is com­ing to Notre Dame for the Florida State game would be very beneficial to women's soc­cer due to the national expo­sure that would be received. Petrucelli believes that Notre Dame's chances to host the Central Region sectional are "50-50". "I think they're afraid of Florida State," he said.

Saint Mary's seniors go out with win 
By CHERYL GILLILAND Sports Writer 
In their season finale, the Saint Mary's College volleyball team brought home a victory as they beat Chicago State University, 15-12, 15-6, 13-15, 15-12. 
Saturday's victory was the last win in an eight-game win­ning streak and gave the Belles a final record of 22-9, which is one of the best final records in Saint Mary's history. · "It was a really good way to finish up the season," said coach Julie Schroeder-Biek. "Everyone got to play and I think we put forth a good team effort." 
Five seniors, including co­captains Kim Branstetter and Michelle Martino, Erica Freitag, Andrea Salazar, and Mary Wheeler, ended their Saint Mary's volleyball career on Saturday. 
''I'm really pleased with our record, and I thought Julie re­ally coached us well," said Branstetter, who had 8 kills, 15 digs, and a total of 8 points in Saturday's game. "I thought we were very good this year; we worked hard and played well together." 
Schroeder-Biek noted that Chicago State has greatly im­proved from last year."They were really hitting the ball well, " she commented. "They came in and did their job." 
"I thought we all played tough, and I'm glad everyone got a chance to play," said Branstetter. "It was nice to end our season on a win." 
All five seniors were starters this season and in Saturday's game, except Salazar, who was out with an injury."The seniors had a lot of talent, personality, and experience," commented Schroeder-Biek. "They will def­initely be missed." 
Many of the statistics from Saturday's game can be at­tributed to the senior players. Martino had 35 assists, 8 digs, 4 service aces, and 13 points for the whole night. Wheeler added 7 kills, and Fritag had 13 kills, 3 service aces, and a total of 9 points. Sophomore tri-cap­tain Sara Stronczek also added 9 kills, 3 service aces, and a total of 10 points for the game. 
"Because we had five seniors, who were all in primary lead­ership positions, we will be looking for the five sophomores to step into leadership roles next year," said Schroeder­Biek. 
Schroeder-Biek also men­tioned that she is looking for more setters for next year. She is expecting freshman Mindy Cota, who was unable to play this year, to come in strong next year. Schroeder-Biek will also be looking for more incom­ing freshmen because only five sophomores and three fresh­men will be returning. 
"''m going to miss playing. It's hard to believe that it is fi­nally over," commented Branstetter. "I wish all the un­derclassmen the best of luck with their goals in Saint Mary's volleyball."

If the Nebraska Cornhuskers somehow manage to play for the national championship, they'll have Glen Mason to 
thank. 

The Kansas coach elected to go for a 2­point conver­sion at the end of Saturday's game with his team trailing 


21-20. Asheiki Preston threw to the corner of the end zone and the ball float­ed between several players before landing on the ground . 
Did Mason consider kicking the extra point for a 21-21 tie? 
"I would have gone for two if all we needed to win the Big Eight championship was a tie," he said. 
The failed conversion and Nebraska's ensuing recovery of the onside kick at Lawrence, Kan., kept the Cornhuskers undefeated and possibly headed for a national championship matchup in the Orange Bowl. 
Nebraska (9-0, 5-0) advanced two spots to No. 4 in Sunday's AP poll and has two games remaining-both at home­against unranked Iowa State and No. 17 Oklahoma. 
No. 1 Florida State 49, 
Maryland 20 
At College Park, Md., the Seminoles (9-0, 7-0 ACC) didn't look as dominant as they had previously. Maryland (1-8, 1-5) scored more points against Florida State than any team this season, but backup quar­terback Danny Kanell, subbing for injured Chrlie Ward, threw five TO passes in his first start. 
No. 3 Miami 35, Pitt 7 
Miami hasn't posted a shutout on the road since 1968, but the Hurricanes (7-1, 5-0 Big East) almost did it at Pittsburgh. The Panthers (2-7, 1-4) scored with 
10:41 remaining after a turnover. No. 5 Ohio State 14, No. 14 Wisconsin 14

Hockey ties No.7 Michigan St. 
By TIM SHERMAN 
Sports Writer 
In the first of a home-and­home series, the Notre Dame hockey team traveled to Michi­gan State on Friday night. only to be shutout by a score of 3-0. 
However. the Irish rebounded nicely Saturday night at home by skating to a 1-1 tie with the seventh-ranked Spartans. 
This weekend' s games were important for the Irish for a number of reasons. First, it showed that the team is capa­ble of coming back from a loss with a strong performance. It also served as valuable experi­ence for the freshmen, as many got their first significant min­utes against top-notch competi­tion. Most importantly, it showed teams around the 
C.C.H.A. that Notre Dame has the ability and desire to play with anyone in the league. 
The first game of the series started well for the Irish, who seemed to adjust well to the changes coach Ric Schafer made during the week of prac­tice. 
Goalie Wade Salzman, getting his first career start, showed little signs of nervousness. He stopped all five shots in the first period. The line changes also seemed to add some spark to the offense, as many of their eight first-period shots were quality scoring opportunities. Unfortunately, Michigan State goalie Mike Buzak was tough, denying all eight. 
The 6, 622 fans who packed Munn Arena finally had reason to cheer early in the second period when Bart Turner scored on a deflected shot. Following the fortunate bounce for the Spartans, the Irish once again had opportunities to tie the game, but failed to finish. 
MSU took control of the game midway through the sec­ond period. At the 9:04 mark, left-winger Steve Guolla took advantage of a Notre Dame penalty by scoring his fifth goal of the young season on a feed from Rem Murray. 
The Irish did not quit, though, as they once again stepped up their intensity in an attempt to get back into the game. How­ever, Buzak denied any such notion with a couple of key saves. Sophomore center Jamie Ling consistently pro­vided his Irish teammates with opportunities but no one could solve Buzak. 
The third period was marred by penalties, as nine were called in the first nine minutes. Neither squad could capitalize until the 9:44 mark, when MSU winger Michael Burkett tipped in a Steve Suk drive to give the Spartans their second power­play goal of the evening and a commanding 3-0 lead. 
ND failed to mount any significant offensive pressure the rest of the way, as they managed only four shots. 
Although Salzman played well, especially considering the circumstances, Schafer decided to start senior Greg Louder in Saturday's rematch. The deci­sion turned out well, as Louder combi.ed with a strong defen­sive performance to allow just one goal. 
Like the previous night's 

-
game, the two clubs skated to a scoreless tie after the first pe­riod. Although ND ended the period with nine shots, their first true scoring bid did not come until the 9:00 mark of the If period. From that point on, the Irish carried play into the break. 
Notre Dame came out hus­tling in the second period. Strong forechecking and solid 
hitting allowed the Irish to maintain offensive pressure throughout the period. With 
7:34 left in the middle period, Ling stole a pass in the Spartan zone and converted it into the Irish's first goal in five periods. 
"I just took a chance on the pass, because I noticed they had been doing it all night. He put it on my stick and Buzak gave high glove (side)," said Ling, whose goal marked the first time the Irish scored first since their first game. 
The lead was short-lived as the Spartans took quick advan­tage of an Irish penalty to knot the score at one. Guolla, on a nice feed from Kelly Harper. beat Louder through the legs. The two-goal spurt in a two­minute span was the only scor­ing of the night. 
The Irish offense looked crisp in the third period with their passes and their hustling style. The Irish fought hard for loose pucks, dove to block shots, and took the body at every opportu­nity. MSU coach Ron Mason appreciated the effort. "Notre Dame skates and works hard," he said. 
Despite the solid work, the Irish could not regain the lead. As has been the case thus far, they made some chances for themselves in both the third period and the overtime, yet could not convert. "We con­trolled the puck," said Ling. "Things are starting to come together for us. We'll keep working." 
On the defensive side, the team played very well. They did allow two breakaways, which Louder stonewalled, but on the whole turned in an excellent game. In particular, captain Matt Osiecki was outstanding. 
"Osiecki was a force. He's like a linebacker on blades," said Schafer. 
In addition to Osiecki's effort, Louder was superb after a night off. "Greg Louder did everything we asked and

After two heart-breaking sea­sons which ended with the Irish not being invited to the national tournament, the squad will finally be given its chance tomorrow when the NCAA an­nounces its tournament seed­ings. The Irish are currently ranked third in the nation and are 5-2 against nationally ranked opponents. Their only two losses came at the hands of top-ranked North Carolina and second-ranked Stanford.

Seniors go out on inspiring note 
By TIMOTHY SEYMOUR Assistant Sporrs Editor 

Not in their house. Not in their last regular season home game. 
The seniors on the Notre Dame volleyball made it perfectly clear that their finale would be repre­sentative of the achievements they have brought to the program, reducing Xavier to an unthreat­ening 'Opponent X' in dominating the Musketeers 15-11, 15-7, 15-3 en route to their third consecu­tive MCC regular season title. · 
"I definitely think it brought out a lot of emo­tion and heart in the seniors," noted Irish head coach Debbie Brown, whose 17th-ranked squad improved to 21-5. "They wanted to make their potentially last opportunity to play at home a good effort." 
Only three seniors were able to play for the Irish, as Molly Stark was forced to the sideline by an ankle injury, but they took over from the beginning. An ace by setter and co-captain Janelle Karlan gave Notre Dame a 1-0 lead, fol­lowed by a block by the other co-captain, Julie Harris. The third senior to start, defensive spe­cialist Dyan Boulac, made her presence felt with a sprawling dig that stopped a momentary Musketeer rally and gave the Irish possession. 
After the individual efforts, the seniors showed why teamwork has earned the Irish the recogni­tion they've gotten this season, as a Boulac pass and Karlan set ended in a Harris kill and Notre Dame point. 
"It aroused a lot of emotion, and was some­
