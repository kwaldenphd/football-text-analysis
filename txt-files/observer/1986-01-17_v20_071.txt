Negotiators optimistic as arms talks get underway 
~lated Prc:M 
GF.NEVA -The chief Soviet 
negotiator said yesterday that the 
first order of business for the new 
round of arms talks is dealing with a 
Kremlin proposal intended to rid 
Europe of nuclear missiles. 
After a 1 0-week break the U.S.­Sovict arms negotiations resumed yesterday, one day after Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev put forth a plan for eliminating nuclear weapons in several stages by the year 2000. 
Wa~hington welcomed Gorbac­hev's proposals · but cautiously. The Reagan administration expressed concern because he linked arms reduction to suapping the Strategic Defense Initiative, the U.S. research project on space-based defense commonly called "Star Wars." 
The opening session at the Soviet Mis.~ion began on an optimistic note. Chief U.S. negotiator Max Kampel­man said his team was "anxious" for an accord and his Soviet counter­part, Viktor Karpov, expressed hope of a "creative search for a solution." 
Star Wars has been a major stick­ing point in the talks since this series began last March. Three rounds have produced no sign of progress on the issue. 
Karpov told reporters before the 
U.S. delegation arrived, "the Star Wars program is very dangerous and we feel that banning of that program is very Important for reducing arms, first ofall nuclear arms. 
"Blame the United States, not me," for the superpower disagreement on Star Wars, he said. The Soviet Union claims the plan is offensive, not defensive, and will extend the arms race 10 space. 
The United States says it is com­m"itted to the Strategic Defense In­itiative and does not intend to scrap it. The Reagan administration con­tends that a defense system in space would make the world more secure. 
Karpov said the "direct task" of the negotiators is to deal with the

Special to The Observer 
Ann Titus, a 1980 graduate of Notre Dame who has served the Hunger Action Coalition and the Food Pantry Program in her native Pittsburgh area, will receive the 1986 Dr. Thomas Dooley Award of the Alumni Association. 
The award is named for Notre Dame alumnus Dooley and is presented to a graduate ofthe last I 0 years who has engaged in extraordi­nary service for the benefit of his or her fellowmen. 
A theology major at Notre Dame, Titus joined the Hunger Coaltition as a volunteer shortly after gradua­tion. In the spring of 1982, she became the first Vista volunteer for the Food Pantry Program, a series of satelllte food banks in Allegheny County assisting families and in­dividuals from eastern Ohio to central Pennsylvania. The organiza­tion increased its aid from one mil­lion pounds of food distributed in 1981 to more than seven million pounds this year, and has a goal of one million pounds per month for needy families with the addition ofa new warehouse. · 
Titus is studying for a master's degree at Carnegie-Mellon Univer­sity and plans to use her new management and business tech­niques in future projects of the program, one of which uses county parkgrounds to grow produce for eligible families. 
Directors of the Alumni Assocaia­tion will be joined by former board 
members  at  the  annual  winter  
meeting  beginning  Jan.  27  on  
campus.  

The award, a miniature replica of the Dooley statue recently installed at the Grotto, will be presented to 

Space shuttle's bad luck continues 
"->elated PTc:M 
SPACE CENTER, HOUSTON-Rain and fog in Florida kept luckless Columbia from landing yesterday, and NASA said failure to bring the shuttle back to its home port today would force: cancellation of a March tllght devoted to Halley's Comet. 
The astronauts, who endured a record seven delays before finally launching their mission Sunday, were instructed to aim toward a 
7: 1 2 a.m. EST landing today at the Kennedy Space Center. 
But National Aeronautics and Space Administration officials said the Florida weather forecast was un­certain and it was expected to be even worse tomorrow. 
Officials said If the prospects ap­peared dim for Columbia being able to land in Florida today or tomor­row, it would be diverted to Ed­wards Air Force Base in California, landing there at 8:39am. EST today. 
Columbia's planned landing yes­terday was cancelled just 19 minutes before mission commander Robert Gibson was to trigger rocket engine firings that would drop the winged craft out oforbit. 
The wave-off yesterday was the eighth operational delay for Colum­bia's flight. Launch of the mission was postponed seven times over 25 days before it lifted off last Sunday. The delays put NASA into a tight schedule bind to meet the agency's goal this year oflaunching 15 shuttle flights, including the comet study mission. 
Columbia is scheduled to be launched again on March 6, carrying into orbit an an array of instruments focused on Halley's comet. The launch date was selected to coincide with the comet fly-by of Soviet and Eu~opean satellites. 

Officials said if Columbia is forced to land in California, it will take about six days to return the spacecraft to Kennedy. This would not leave enough time to prepare Columbia for the March 6 launch date. As a result, the Halley's comet observation flight would be can­celled, NASA said. 
Rep. Bill Nelson, D-Fia., is flying on Columbia as a congressional ob­server. Others on the crew are Charles Bolden, Steve Hawley, George Nelson, RCA engineer Robert Cenker and astronaut Franklin Chang-Diaz, the first Hispanic-American to fly in space. 
Titus at the Friday evening banquet Jan. 31. She will be accompanied by her parents, who live in Pittsburgh. 
University President Father Theodore Hesburgh and Executive Vice President Father EdmundJoyce will participate in dedication ceremonies for the new Dooley statue at 2 p.m. Saturday, Feb. 1. 
A videotape record of the dedica­tion will be shown during the halftime of the Notre Dame­Marquette basketball game begin­ning at 4 p.m. in the ACC. 
Rudy Torrini, a 1958 graduate of Notre Dame and art faculty member at Fonbonne College in Dooley's native St. Louis, completed the statue as a gift to the University with financial help from alumni and friends of Notre Dame in the St. Louis area.

Saint Mary's yearbooks arrive after extended wait 
By PEGGY PROSSER 
StaffReporter 
The long-awaited 1984-85 Saint 
Mary's yearbook, the Blue Mantle, 
will be distributed to Saint Mary's 
students within two weeks, accord· 
ing to Pam Demers, the yearbook's 
editor-in-chief. 
Demers blamed the printing delay 
on production problems, mis­
management of resources, deadline 
over-runs and a lack oforganization. 
All of these problems can be at­
tributed to last year's Blue: Mantle 
staff, she said. 
"I had no idea when we'd get 
them (the yearbooks) back. With all 
the problems the staff had last year, 
it was almost impossible to tell," 
Demers said. "I thought they would 
be ready when we came back in Sep­
tember," she added. "What hap­
pened was that last year's editor 
took on too much, and was left to do 
all the work herself. She had very 
little support from her staff," said 
Demers. 

The Student Activities office has been receiving complaJnts from stu­dents about when the yearbooks Will be: distributed, Demers said. She: explained that students wishing to order the yearbooks have the cost added into their first semester's tui· · tion, so the: yearbooks are paid for in advance. 
"People have: paid for it, and should be wondering where it is," said Demers. 
Students, who have been waiting several months past the expected September arrival date, said they were not informed ofthe reasons for the delay. When told of the: year­books' arrival, several students reacted with surprise. 
"Are we going to be getting them? I know we paid for It," said junior Lori Bernat. 
Junior Anna Gaffney added, "We: haven't heard anythingabout them.l think everyone forgot." 
Students wlll receive a letter ex­plaining where: and when the year­books will be distributed, Demers said.

Six more moons discovered around planet by Voyager 2 
PASADENA, Calif. The: Voyager 2 spacecraft has dis­covered six more small moons around the planet Uranus, dou· bling to 12 the number ofmoons now known to orbit the seventh planet from the sun, NASA said yesterday. 
Scientists believe Voyager may find as many as 18 additional moons, which would raise the to­tal to 30 and "mean that Uranus has more moons than any of the: other planets," said Ellis Miner, deputy Voyager project scientist atJet Propulsion Laboratory. 
Saturn now holds the: solar sys­tem record, with 20 moons, followed by Jupiter with 16, he: said. 

The six newly discovered moons are clustered at roughly the same distance from the: planet, which "possibly implies they arc: a result of a larger satelllte that broke up," Miner said. 
That theory will be: bolstered if Voyager 2's television cameras finds that the moons have: ir­regular shapes when it makes its closest approach to Uranus and its moons and rings onJan. 24, he added.

In Brief 
An earthworm fraud case ended yesterday when two men pleaded guilty in Springfield, ill., to federal mail-fraud charges and agreed to testify against two other officials ofan Indiana company that allegedly sold worthless earthworm farms in a phony get-rich-quick scheme. David Long of Laguna Hills, Calif., and Mic­hael Robeson of Indianapolis, former salesmen for Superior Worm Brokers Exchange, agreed to return $82,000 to 30 growers who invested in the company's earthworm farms. Federal prosecutors say the company bilked 103 central Illinois residents of more than $230,000. The pair admitted making misrepresentations to lure cus­tomers, including claims that a limited number of worm growers would be solicited, that worms had great sales potential and ihat the company would provide expert advice. ·AP 
Bernard Goetz gained a small victory yesterday when at­tempted murder and assault charges were dropped against the sub· way gunman by a judge who ordered the case presented to a third grand jury. Three charges ofcriminal possession of a weapon were retained against Goetz, who said he shot four youths on a subway train more than a year ago when he believed they were about to rob him. The four counts ofattempted murder and four counts ofassault were dropped by Judge Stephen Crane because of a "prejudicial er­ror'' in instructing the second grand jury that indicted Goetz, ac­cording to court papers released by Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau. ·AP · 
Smokeless tobacco may cause cancer, 
according to a national scientific panel. Decrying a growing use of snuff and other smokeless tobacco, the panel said Wednesday the public should be warned of "conyincing evidence" linking such products to cancer. "This is not a safe alternative to cigarette smoking," said Consensus Development Conference chairman Brian MacMahon, noting that studies show some people have switched to smokeless tobacco in response to warnings linking smoking and can· cer. Snuff, in particular, has been growing in popularity among teen­age boys, who make up nearly 3 million ofthe 1 0 million Americans the panel estimates have used smokeless tobacco during the past year, the group's statement said. Some studies have found substantial use by boys in the third grade. ·Ap

Slain activist's legacy is his words, not celebrations honoring him 
"/ just want to do God's will. And He's always allowed me to go to the mountain. And I've looked over, anaI've seen the promised land .... So I'm happy tonight. I'm not worried about anything. I'm not fearing any man." 
·The Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. 
from his speech at Birmingham, Ala. 
the evening before his assassination 
(April3, 1968). 
Martin Luther King Jr. would have celebrated his 57th birthday two days ago. Instead, many famous and not-so-famous folk of the United States held Wednes­day's celebration for him. Speeches, plaques and celebrations are certain to continue through Monday's federal holiday. 
Wednesday's celebrations came from around the 
country:

King relied on passive resistance and nonviolence. But his focus was on the confrontational aspects ofsuch tactics and the potential for change of those tactics. Rage at the evils of injustice will make a better world only ifthat rage is kept under control and used as a tool for change. 
A federal holiday honoring King is a mockery unless it remains a vehicle for such change and not a sugary­sweet holiday honoring a dusty historical figure. King's holiday should remain a rallying point for change. It

There is a common thread which ties all of these celebrations together. History reveals King as a great man. He was the spark which ignited a nation to action against injustice. It was he and his followers who made a difference in their world and it was their efforts that snowballed into a national movement. 
Yet, although the U.S. civil rights movement is under­standably what is most closely associated with King, this federal holiday has the potential to be so much more. 
Much of King's greatness seems to be lost in generalizations. By labeling King a great black leader, or a great civil rights leader, much ofwhat he stood for is pushed into the background.

He gave us advice on the way in which he climbed the mountain and looked at the promised land.

Prisoners free captives as 30-hour ordeal ends 
AMoclated PreM 
YPSILANTI, Mich. -Two armed Inmates who held three people hostage at knifepolnt in a maximum­security prison for about 30 hours releasc:d their captives unharmed yesterday and surrendered, aut· horltles said. 
The two inmates, who took the hostages at I 0:4"i a.m. Wednesday, received assurances that they would be transferred from the Huron Val­ley Men's Facllity to federal prisons, said Marvin May, a spokesman for the state Department of Correc­tions. He would not identify the federal prisons. 
The prisoners also were granted Interviews with Depmy Corrections Director Dan Bolden, but their demand to meet with the news media was denied. 
The hostages were released at 4:26p.m., May said. They were iden­tified as john Saren, 50, a food­service:: supervisor from Ypsilanti; Ron lksbrough, 48, a guard from Saline::; and Darwin Gravitt, 36, an Inmate:: who worked In the kitchen. 
Gravitt was placed In "an isolation unit," said Thomas Phillips, a correc­tions spokesman. There had been 
some question whether Gravitt was 
a hostage or a participant, but aut­
horities said they concluded he was 
a hostage. 
Warden Dan Bolden was inter· 
viewing the inmates and state police 
were talking to the hostages. 
A fourth person taken hostage, 
guard Dennis Easley, 27, ofYpsilanti, 
was releasc:d about 12 hours after 
the Incident began In exchange for a

"They asked for amnesty a while 
back and that was denied," he said. 
The inmates were identified as Namon Travis, 40, convicted ofrape and armed robbery and serving a life sentence, and Elvis Williams, 31, ser­ving time for armed robbery. 
The incident was touched off by Travis' learning his efforts failed to halt his transfer, scheduled for yes­terday, to Southern Michigan Prison at Jackson, said Gail Light, a spokes­woman for the state Department of Corrections. 
"He (Travis) claimed to have an enemy there and tried to talk his way out of the transfer. When he was un· successful, he went Into the yard and tried to mobilize prisoners," Light said.

"We have much work yet to do," she said. 
The dedication of King's bust came four days before the first offi· cial federal holiday Is held on Mon­day in observance of his birth 57 years ago. King actually was born on Jan. 15. 
Among those attending the dedication were Sen. Charles Mat· hias, R-Md., and former Rep. Jonat­han Bingham, D·N.Y., co-sponsors of the legislation authorizing a King statue in the halls of Congress, which approved their resolution In December 1982. 
Mathias said It was fitting that a memorial to King be placed alongside statues ofWashington,Jef· ferson and Lincoln In the Rotunda, but he added: 
"When you see a lunch counter with black and white Americans eating together, then you sc:e his monument. When you see black and white children playing together In a

gham or a voting booth In Selma, 
then you see his monument. When 
you see black Americans and white 
Americans working together for a 
better life for all Americans, then 
you see his monument. " 
The audience heard the reading of a message from President Reagan, who saluted all who have continued to work for "a truly color-blind America" since King's death.

Seven states named as possibllities for next nuclear waste disposal site 
WASHINGTON -The Energy Department yesterday selected seven states as possibilities for a second vault to store highly radioactive nuclear waste for I 0,000 years. The selections set off im­mediate cries of "Not in my back yard!" from governors and other of­ficials. 
"If it's not a good site, it's to the state's advantage and ours to find that out," said Ben Rusche, head of DOE's civilian radioactive waste office. 
Congress in 1982 directed the department to plan for two under­ground repositories, using different geologies ifpossible, to isolate an ex­pected 140,000 metric tons ­154,000 U.S. tons -of spent reactor fuel, weapons waste and other highly radioactive material. 
The 12 sites chosen yesterday are granite or other crystalline rock formations -three in Minnesota, two each in Maine, North Carolina and Virginia and one each in New Hampshire, Georgia and Wisconsin. 
An additional eight sites -five in Minnesota and one eacti in Georgia, Wisconsin and New Hampshire ­were chosen as backups in case any of the front-runners has to be dropped, an event Rusche said was unlikely. 
Only one site actually has been authorized by Congress, which would have to approve a second. DOE earlier chose a salt formation in Texas, a basalt formation in Was­hington state and a tuff formation in Nevada as finalists for the first repository, with a presidential deci­sion scheduled for 1991 on which one to use. 
Until Congress decides on a second site, the first is limited to 70,000 mettic tons, although Rusche said either could hold all ex­pected material. He said it was "not a foregone conclusion" that a second site actually will be decided upon. 
If a second site is chosen, the deci­sion would come in 1998 for use in about 2006. 

Researchers find key to AIDS virus 
NEW YORK -Researchers have found the lock-and-key by which the AIDS virus zeroes in on its target in the body's immune system, raising new hopes for a vaccine against the deadly disease. 
In a report to be published today in Science magazine, the researchers said the finding suggests new ways of stopping or preventing AIDS in­fections, either by treating immune cells to reject the AIDS virus or by using drugs to attack the part of the virus that directs it toward immune cells. 
Scientists have known that the AIDS virus has a very particular preference for a specific white blood cell called the T-4 lym­phocyte. The T-4 cells play a critical role in the body's immune system by directing the function of other blood cells. 
When the T-4 cells are infected with the AIDS virus, they cannot coordinate the immune system and the body becomes susceptible to the bizarre infections and unusual can-

Reagan vows to study Soviet plan carefully 
Assoclatcd Press 
WASHINGTON President Reagan said yesterday that the Kremlin's sweeping plan for nuclear disarmament by the end of the cen­tury is encouraging and "different from things that we've heard in the past," and he promised to analyze it carefully. 
However, the administration firmly rejected Moscow's fresh demand for a scrapping of "Star Wars" missile-defense research and a proposed moratorium on nuclear testing. 
In unveiling the new offer Wed­nesday, Soviet leader Mikhail Gor­bachev insisted that the disarmament process could proceed only if the United States and the Soviet Union "renounce the development, testing and deploy­ment" of so-called space-strike weapons, the Kremlin's term for Star Wars. The administration calls the plan the Strategic Defense Initiative, or SOl. 
After reviewing the Soviet plan overnight, the administration mixed cautious praise of some elements with criticism ofother aspects. 
Reagan reserved judgment on whether it signaled that the Soviets are serious about negotiating an arms agreement. 
"We're going to find out," he said, answering reporters' questions briefly during a picture-taking ses­sion in the Cabinet Room. 
"We're grateful for the offer," the president said. Asked whether it could lead toward disarmament, he said, "We're studying it with great care and it is going to depend on what takes place in Geneva'.'

cers seen in AIDS patients. 
The new research, by Dr.J. Steven McDougal and colleagues at the Center for Disease Control in At­lanta, explains how the AIDS virus is able to discriminate among many white blood cells and infect only the T-4 cells. 
The researchers showed that an AIDS infection begins when a virus protein called gp110 recognizes and binds to the so-called T-4 protein on the T-4 cells.

Fraternities foster qualities ND does not need 
As an alumna of Notre Dame presently teaching at a decidedly Greek college (Lafayette College in Easton, Pa.,) and having attended a Greek-dominated undergraduate institution (St. Francis College in Loretto, Pa,) I must take exception to Tim Burke's call for the Greek system oflifestyle at Notre Dame in The Observer on Dec. 4. Burke, one of the reasons people think about John Belushi smashing beer cans into his forehead, etc., when fraternities and sororities are men­tioned is logical -it happens, and it happens often. 
Nancy}. McCreary guest column 
Lafayette houses 15 national frats and five national sororities, as well as a number of regional Greek organizations. St. Francis has seven national frats and two sororities. Rather than giving students a "sense of freedom, unity, and independence," they foster divi­sion, coersion, and a homogeneity which any academic institution, especially Notre Dame, doesn't need. Since much "social activity" (I use the term loosely to describe not just drinking, but getting p---eyed drunk!) is linked to Greeks, alternatives are unaccepted and virtually nil. In addition, there is tremendous peerpressure exerted bystudents on students to "belong" not just to any frat/sorority, but, to the "right" one. The psychological hazing is terrible; the physical hazing is worse. As an undergrad, two friends broke their 'code of silence' regarding hell nights -not a pleasant 
story. It was dominated by such interesting pasttimes designed to promote unity and sup­port as hanging pledges upside-down from rafters, hands tied behind backs, stuffing as many marshmallows as possible into facial orfices, ringing bells tied by strings to some­what more sensitive portions of the anatomy. All of this after eight to 12 weeks, nearly 10 percent of a collegiate career, being a "pledge" and watching grades and relation­ships turn to dust. My friends said they thought they would be different once they were brothers -then sheepishly confessed that they weren't, they couldn't , the system demanded it ofthem. 
Still, we never thought it was too bad, from what we could see -all of those stories of people really getting hurt when what we saw was just harmless fun. Unfortunately, during my junior year, a bright young sophomore hoping to go to med school, nearly failing two classs because ofpledging, slit his wrists in an attempt to end his life. No longer just harmless fun. And you call this "unity and support": Where were those understanding brothers who recognized tht the guy had been pushed beyond his limit? This is understanding and independence? 
Iffraternities and sororities were now what they were at their inception-groups ofpeople dedicated to academics, discussing recent books, authors, ideas, philosophies, theologies -then perhaps they would be a worthwhile unit of interaction. But then, as students, we probably wouldn't want them around since they wouldn't be a place where "students would know where to go for fun on weekends." The interhall system at Notre 
Dame, although perhaps limited (only per­haps) is still far superior a social system, fos­tering much more companionable support, unity and even some competition without the demand of a choice on the part ofunaffiliated sutdents, or the Insidious peer pressure to get into the "right" dorm. Of course, not all col­leges have these kinds of difficulties with Greeks; some have fewer, some have more. Lafayette spent about S900 one weekend be­cause of vandalism after a standard weekend "pub night/' not to mention the student upon whose car was dropped the contents of a 
room -primarily the furniture. I doubt if her insurance company saw that as positive social activity. 
Certainly, visiting a campus where Greeks abound is one thing. Living in it and with it is entirely something else. From experience, I've found out what. Having done both, I sug­gest, Burke, that you go elsewhere and do the same. Perhaps your opinion will not change, but I'd lay money that it would.

Single-sex dormitories fortify wall between sexes 
Learning to appreciate the opposite sex is a beneficial and enlightening capability. Men and women have unique perspectives on the world. Because of the inherent differences and the unlike ways in which each is raised, both have valuable and distinctive viewpoints to offer the other. 
Greg Stohr 
life goes on 
Yet, beginning in early childhood, facets of 
society erect a wall, which separates males and females and prevents them from learning from each other. Parental rules, single-sex high schools, and learned prejudices all can help build this wall. Such a separator can be beneficial because it does prevent the im­mature misuse of interaction between the sexes, especially among adolescents. But to fully appreciate the world as adults we must eventually tear down the wall and begin to un­derstand the unique viewpoint of the op­posite sex. 
Here at Notre Dame, though, the wall stands tall and strong, preventing the growth of intersexual relations. A definite attitude of "us and them" still thrives between the sexes. Students think in terms of "the guys in my hall" and "the girls from-----Hall." Much ofthe blame for this continuing ignorance must fall on the single-sex residence system, which not only fails to tear down the wall but actually fortifies it. 

The University promotes overcoming this wall only to a limited extent. Limited visita­tion and 24-hour lounges do exist, but these privileges only dtip away at the wall and do so little to discourage the attitude of "us and them." The message to the students is that there is one type of people with whom they can associate fully and another type with whom they can only have limited association. 
Just as one learns from the dorm atmo­sphere how to live constantly with many ot­hers, seeing members of the opposite sex as parts ofone's constant life can help a person to learn from them. Having to go out ofone's way -either across the quad or through an often­busy telephone line, which leads to an often­unoccupied room -whenever we wish to communicate with someone of the opposite sex sharply reduces understanding between the sexes. Only through intense, constant relationships with the other gender can one truly see through the physical differences to learn from the other sex. Sadly, such relation­ships are hard to develop in a school where males and females are so set apart for all four 
years. 
Granted, single-sex dorms do allow for privacy, which many students value very much, and we must respect the rights ofthose who do not wish to relinquish that privacy. Living in a co-ed hall can only be an option for

students. In addition, single-sex halls might indeed reduce w-hat some might consider ex­cessive social/sexual activity or even promote emphasis on book-learning by creat­ing a little more time for studying. Problems resulting from such distorted values or poor time management, however, likely would be minimal at a university where students must be considered responsible young adults even to gain admission. 
Despite these possible advantages, the present living arrangements force us to sacrifice another type oflearning-something so many ofus here lack -learning to overcome the wall, to appreciate fully the true value of the opposite sex. Perhaps it is simply a matter ofpriorities. 
I just think the University has its priorities in the wrong order.

"I work at Irish Gardens so that I can see which girl gets the most flowers, and I figure she's gotta be pretty wild, so I call her up," Keith Spatz said. 
"Who was it that said, stop and smell the flowers? Also it's fun and we love it here. We never leave, we stay after 5:30 until they drag us away," Marc Antonetti commented.

lin has performed with the New York, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Chicago, Houston and Minnesota orchestras in addition to many others around the country. His performances abroad include con­certs with the London, Rotterdam, Montreal and Israel orchestras. His 
tone, technique and musical knowledge has been praised by critics and audiences around the world. 
A native ofTaiwan, lin is the only Taiwanese violinist to have been invited to perform in China, where he has made two concert and reci­tal tours and taught master classes. He also performs frequently in Australia and the Far East. 
lin began violin studies at the age offive and gave his first public performance when he was seven. At 12 he went to Australia to study at the Sydney Conservatorium, and at

She added that the "happy people" ofIrish Gardens will be moving to take up residence in the former Interna­tional Student Lounge in a few weeks.

8:15 p.m. Beside "Concerto for Violin and Orchestra in G minor," included in the third concert ofthe Orchestra's 1985-86 season are Igor Stravinsky's "Card Game in Three 
Deals," which was first performed in 19 3 7, and, as a finale, Johannes Brahms' "Symphony No. 2 in D major." Completed in 1877, Brahms attributed the ease and grace ofthe melodies in this symphony to the charms ofthe Austrian summer resort where he was living. The four-movement symphony was first performed in 1877 by the Vienna Philharmonic under the direction ofHans Richter. 
Immediately preceding the con­cert, Maestro Kiesler will present his discussion series, "Concert Comments." This question-and­answer session is held on the main floor section ofthe Auditorium at 7:15p.m., and all concert ticket holders are invited to attend. 
For information and tickets, contact the Symphony office at 232-6343. Fifteen minutes before the concert, second-balcony stu­dent tickets go on sale at a reduced S4.

Christmas spirit should last throughout the year 
Chrismas has come,the goose was nice and fat and we were pleased to put a penny in the old man's hat. That was weeks ago, and now is the time to get on with life. No more holly and Ivy, no bright lights or bows and ribbons, or sugar cookies or Santa Clauses or nativity scenes. The empty, life-sized nativity scene by the grotto symbolizes that the season is over and we must move on. 
Jeanne Grammens 
ask not 

So, welcome back to the world of gray Januarys, schedule changes and late-night studying. Pretty depressing after such a jolly, happy season. People often call the weeks and months following the Christmas season, "the suicide season." Valentine's Day is supposed to curb this depression. Creating a holiday in the dreary months between Christmas and Spring gives people something to look for­ward to. But Valentine's Day is many long weeks away, and it does not compare to the all-encompassing Christmas season. 
'lbat's what it's all about though, isn't it? Christmas season is a time of anticipation. Everyont· is looking forward to something, whether it be new skis, a chance to be with the family, or the arrival of mankind's Savior. In this atmosphere of expectation, people are kind and loving to one another (unless they are Christmas shopping). Before the actual an­niversary of the birth of the Savior, human beings create the feeling ofChrist among us as they love their neighbors as themselves. People seem more willing to do for others, in a way different than the rest ofthe year. That is why humans love the Christmas season so much, and when it is over, a huge void rushes in. 
Isn't it ironic, that the love, the joy, the un­selfishness of Christ exists in anticipation of Christ, but ends after Christmas day? We spend at least four weeks preparing for Christ's day, but as soon as the scent of fir starts to fade, people go back to the regular pattern of life. As quickly as the Christmas decorations are stripped away, so too does the warm feeling of the holidays get stored away until next year. 
Five weeks ago, the life-sized nativity scene appeared at the Grotto. As I stared at it, I finally realized what was missing. The baby Jesus was yet to be placed in the crib. Since the baby Is firmly glued to the miniature at home. I never reali-.et1 the Church waits until Christmas day to lay the babe in the manger. At the time, I was enjoying the joy of the season (finals had not started), and I began to think of how backwards we are about Christmas. Seeing how empty and barren the manger was before Christmas day, helped me realize how barren and empty we would all be if Christ never came. Yet, just as the child Is laid in the manger, we all start to feel the Christmas spirit fade. We've done all our merry-making, all our gift giving, all our extra­special Christmas loving. Logically, the celebration should start the moment the child is laid in the manger. The Christmas season should begin on Christmas Day. 
As things stand now, life does not end after Christmas day. After the immediate sadness, people get back into the swing of things. People find things to look forward to, and they contnue to love, laugh and learn. But they also continue to pass each other by, to "look out for themselves," to forget the feeling of Christmas. During the five-week Christmas season, people seem to be more aware ofeach other, as they unite in anticipation. Hugs and smiles and "Merry Christmas" abound. Christmas cards to long-lost friends and relatives drive the postal service crazy. Mot­hers find time to bake dozens of Christmas cookies. Even brothers find time to buy Christmas presents (as long as sisters will wrap them). People find time for people. People are aware of people. People love people during the season ofChristmas. 
Christ is definitely among us during the season of the anniversary ofhis birth. Yet, it Is not appropriate the season following His birth should be the "suicide season." It would make sense if in the weeks or days prior to Christmas, an awareness ofthe void existed; if we looked to the empty manger and waited for the joy and peace ofChrist to be among us. But the days, week and even months following Christmas day should truly be the time to celebrate. Bring out the holly, the Christmas tree, the presents, the lights and especially the mistletoe, on Christmas day. If we could feel the presence of a great love during the sludgy winter days, the drizzly spring rains, the carefree summer months and the crisp autumn season, then the expression of the miracle would not be confined to a five-week period. The Christmas season could be a year­round event.

Despite all the tragedies, 1985 was a year of hope 
What will we remember of the year 1985? 
1985 was undoubtedly the year of ter­rorism. Nameless and faceless, it struck out at Innocent people to attain its goals. Terrorism struck a jetliner on a flight from Athens, a cruise ship In the Mediterranean, a govern­ment building in Bogata, Columbia, and the airpons In Rome and Vienna. Terrorism claimed 721 lives in the year 1985, among them an I I year-old American schoolgirl and a 68 year-old invalid. 1985 was a violent and bloody year. 
Eric M. Bergamo here's to future days 
Nature claimed her own victims during 1985. An earthquake decimated Mexico City, killing thousands and leaving scores home­less. Three hurricanes hit the seacoasts of the United States. Although there were few deaths, damage was estimated at $1.5 billion. But the mightiest killer was a volcano in Colombia which in the span of only a few hours killed over 25,000 people. 
1985 was the worst year for aviation fatalities. A Japanese Air Unes 747 carrying 524 passengers and crew slammed into a mountainsidt". Miraculously, four people somehow survived the devastating crash. An 
Air India 747 crashed into the Atlantic, a tar­end the famine there. By the end of 1985, get of a suspected bomb planted by Shikh ex-. progress had been made in feeding the people 
tremists. Recently 248 servicemen and women of the 101st Airborne Division lost their lives when the Arrow Air charter jet they were coming home in crashed near Gander, Newfoundland. 
Violence Increased in South Africa as blacks demonstrated against apartheid. Over 1,000 died in violence related to apartheid. Presi­dent Botha declared a state ofemergency and even limited the freedom of the foriegn press to cover the demonstrations. In America, stu­dents protested at colleges across the nation to force divestment in companies doing busi­ness in South Africa. "Sun City" became the protest song against apatheid. 
But there were also signs of hope for the future in 1985. 
For the first time in six years, the leaders of the United States and the Soviet Union met face to face to discuss the problems facing them. Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev held private meetings during the two-day summit in Geneva, and the two professed to work more closely to end the arms race. 
There was the celebration known as Live Aid in 1985. In an effort to raise money to help alleviate hunger in drought-stricken Ethiopia, concerts were held on the same day in Lon­don and Philadelphia. Performers played to capacity crowds at both locations as Uve Aid raised millions of dollars to send to Africa to of Ethiopia, though much more still had to be done. 
In 1985 there was a new medical worry called AIDS. Halley's Comet returned to the heavens after a 76-year absence in 1985. Space shuttle flights became so common as to be routine and proved that man can build ob­jects in space. 
1985 saw the San Francisco 49ers crowned Super Bowl champions. 1985 saw the cagey Wildcats of Villanova upset the mighty Hoyas ofGeorgetown for the NCAA basketball cham­pionship. The Kansas City Royals took the World Series Championship away from the St. Louis Cardinals. But there was also the dark side of sports-the drug problems, the point­shaving scandals, and a riot at a soccer match that killed 38 people. 
We went "Back to the Future" in 1985 and made that movie the year's biggest hit. 
Sylvester Stallone staged a two-man assault, as Rocky and as Rambo, on the movie box offices of America. Bruce Springsteen and Madonna were the biggest stars in the rock-and-roll scene. NBC became the top network due to the success of Bill Cosby and "The Cosby Show." Steven Spielberg seemed to be everywhere. If he wasn't producing movies like "Back to the Future" and "Goonies," he was working on his first television series, "Amazing Stories," for NBC. "Amadeus" won the Oscar for best picture. 
What kind ofa year was 1985? Charles Dick­ens may have stated it the best. 
"It was the best oftimes, it was the worst of times." 
May we hope that 1986 brings more ofthe better times for all ofus.

P.O. Box Q 
Blockade may alleviate future Libyan terrorism 
Dear Editor: 
Mary Healy's article ofJan. 16 in The Obser­ver describes the United States' inability to ef­fectively combat the terrorist threat to American citizens . 
It is agreed that random, or even highly­selective strikes by American military forces would involve the deaths of many innocent civilians. As a civilized nation, we must notal­low ourselves to become so vindictive as to defeat our original purpose and lower our­selves to barbarism. We cannot stand by and watch our citizens become victims of suicidally-fanatic terrorists. 
The fact remains, however, that the proper course ofaction is not to attempt to conduct a "surgical strike." This threat to our well-being has recently been projected into our own country by libya's leader, Khadafy. A similar threat from another nation, had it not been employng the ambiguous spectre of ter­rorism, would have been met head-on by the United States. 
The agents ofterrorism are preparing them­selves for war against our country. We do have the means to prevent these criminals from being aided and abetted by other nations. The United States could blockade Ubya until it sur­rendered the terrorists that we know to be there. This would defuse the situation by ap­plying economic pressure on the country wit­hout having to coax our allies to end trade. We would end It for them. Any casualties then en­countered would be a result ofmilitary action taken against us and would not Involve civilians . 
The support of the Soviet Union in this ac­tion would be welcome, but not necessary. We successively used a blockade against the Soviet Union in the Cuban Missile Crisis. The current situation demands that we take action to head off the spread of terrorism and anar­chism before It Is too late.

Women's basketball team meets Detroit in North Star matchup 
ByLARRY BURKE 
Assistant Sports Editor 
The Notre Dame women's basket­ball team will be looking to open a successful "second season" tonight when it takes on the Titans of Detroit at 7:30 in the ACC. 
Tonight's game is the North Star Conference opener for the Irish, and Mary DiStanislao's squad will need to rack up some wins in conference play ifit is to attract any post-season tournament opportunities. 
Tonight's game is the second of a five-game homestand for the Irish. On Sunday, Notre Dame will take on Boston University at 2 p.m. in the ACC in a non-conference game. before closing out the homestand with North Star foes LoyolaOan. 23) and DePaul Oan. 26). 
The Irish currently stand at 7-5 after a convincing 75-42 win over Marquette in the ACC Monday night. 
Notre Dame beat Detroit twice last season, enroute to a 13-1 North Star record and a runaway con­ference tide. Sophomore center Sandy Botham scored 2I points in Notre Dame's 76-62 victory at Calihan Hall, and the Irish com­pleted a sweep of the season series with a 66-53 win at the ACC. 
Coach Dewayne Jones' Titans will bring a 7-4 record to the ACC tonight. Detroit was I 7-11 overall and 9-3 in the North Star Conference last season. In their conference

hockey and executed well. I don't 
know (why the team played as it did 
on the trip). I don't know if it was 
too long a layoff or, if it was motel­
itis, being on the road such a long 
time and playing that many games." 
Notre Dame's first stop was at the Syracuse Invitational Tournament on Dec. 27 and 28. In their first game, the Irish dropped an 8-7 deci­sion to the Red Raiders ofColgate, a team that beat the Irish last season, I3-4. Tim Reilly paced the Irish at­tack with a hat trick while. Brent Chapman added a goal and four as­sists, and Tom Mooney had two goals and two assists. Colgate's Gerard Waslen and Mark Holmes led the winning effort with a pair of goals each. 
Next up for the Irish were the Broncos of Western Michigan. The Broncos showed the Irish why they are currently ranked tenth in the na­tion by soundly beating them, 11-2. Western Michigan scored six times in the first period and kept the Irish off the scoreboard until the third period when Reilly netted a pair of goals off Bob Theabeau assists. Reilly's five goals led the tourna­ment in scoring, and he was named to the all-tournament team. 
Notre Dame spent the New Year's holiday in Plattsburgh, N.Y., where they played two games with the Car­dinals of SUNY-Plattsburgh. New Year's Eve was less than joyous for the Irish as Plattsburgh beat them, 10-7, and came back on the first day of '86 to drop the Irish, 15-7. Bob Thebeau had hat tricks in each con­test, the third and fourth of his career. 
Despite the poor showing on the trip, Smith said these games were necessary for the future of Notre Dame hockey. 
"We knew what we were going against. The competition was better than what we had run into before, but these games were important to show people where we are and where we want to go." 
The Irish look to get back on the victory trail this weekend against Dearborn, a team that swept them 

opener in Cincinnati on Monday, 
Detroit trounced Xavier, I02-67. 
The Titans have three players with double-figure scoring averages: junior forward Cassandra Pack at 
21.7 points per game, junior guard Daphne Smith at 21.0 points per game, and junior center Mary Kay Whalen at I0.5 points per game. 
"Detroit is a very solid team with good talent," says DiStanislao. "This is our first conference game of the season and it will be a crucial game for us to go out and play hard. Detroit will be tough with Pack at forward and Smith at guard. Those are two ofthe top players in ourcon­ference and I expect them to play very well. 
"Whalen has added a lot to this team with her scoring and rebound­ing. She's averaging eight rebounds a game and she will be a factor under the boards. We will have to play a solid game for all 40 minutes if we want to come away with a win." 
Notre Dame leads the overall series with Detroit 4-1, with Detroit's only win comingat Calihan Hall in 1984 by an 85-80 score. 
DiStanislao should have her whole squad reasonably healthy for tonight's contest, including fresh­man Heidi Bunek, who has missed the past month with a stress fracture of the right leg. Bunek came back in Monday's game to play II minutes, contributing four points. Before her injury Bunek was averaging 13 points and five rebounds per game. 
home record of 5-1-l. The team is also finally healthy but will play wit­hout Chapman, who received a game disqualification in Plattsburgh and, under the rules, is ineligible this weekend. 
"The team's attitude and work et­hic have been e:~~:cellent this week," commented Smith. "These two games with Dearborn are very welcome as we try to get the bad taste (ofdefeat) out ofour mouths." 
"We're going to take it one day at a 
time with Heidi," says DiStanislao. 
"So far she's feeling pretty good, but 
she's still got a lot of time to make 
up." 
Sunday's game will be the first 
meeting ever between Notre Dame 
and Boston University. Coach 
Christine Basile's Terriers were 4-7 
before Wednesday's clash with New 
Hampshire. BU was 14-I4 overall 
last season. Top scorer for the Ter­
riers are Andrea Ashtuck ( 13.1 ppg., 
7.7 rpg.) and Renee Kurowski ( 12.0 ppg., 4.0 rpg.). 
"HU had a dry spell early in the season when the lost four straight games," noted DiStanislao. "But now they're starting to play good basket­balll and we expect a very tough game from them when they come into the ACC. Ashtuck is a very good player and she is only a freshman so she'll get better as the season goes along. 
"BU is also getting good play from Renee Kurowski at guard. This game is a good test for us since it will be our last non-conference gae of the season." 
IRISH ITEMS -Senior forward Trena Keys needs only 125 points to become Notre Dame's all-time leading scorer. . . Tip-off time for the DePaul game onjan. 26at the ACC has been changed from 2 p.m. to 4:15p.m.
