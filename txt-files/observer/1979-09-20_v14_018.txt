In November 
John Paul II summons extraordinary conclave 
VATICAN CITY (AP) -Pope John Paul II has summoned cardinals ofthe Roman Catholic Church to an extraordinary conclave in November a month after he returns from a nine-day visit to the United States and Ireland, Vatican sources said yesterday. 
The meeting was reported as 
the pontiff faced growin~ com­
plaints from workers 10 the 
Vatican who are seeking in­
creased pay and better working 
conditions. A spokesman for 
the Vatican's 1,700 lay workers 
announced plans to organize a 
union to press theirdemands ­
the first time any organized 
labor activity was reported in 
the Holy See. 
The sources said the conclave 
of the pope with all 131 cardin­
als would be unprecedented in 
modern times. The exact scope 
and purpose was not given, and 
there was no official confirma­
t:on. 
In the past, the cardinals -or princes of the church -have met privately only to elect popes or to attend consistories called by the pope to name new cardin­als, the sources noted. 
Vatican analysts said the pope may be convening the meeting to review the first year of his pontificate. He was elected by the cardinals on Oct. 16, 1978. 
The pope returns to Rome on Oct. 8, after two days·in Ireland and a week-long visit to six U.S. cities -Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, Des Moines and Washington. 
''Some cardinals have sought 
dari~cations on a number ofr 
doctnnal matters the pope fias· touched on, and I think the pope may want to give 'them an 
opportunity to ask questions,'' one analyst said. 
Speculation also centered 3:round a possible papal in~tia­tlve to promote Chnsuan umty. 
The pontiff also may want to rule on rebel Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre, traditionalist prelate defying Vatican direc­tives on the modern Mass and 
other changes instituted by Vatican Council II of 1962-1965, a convocation of both the car­dinals and the world's Roman Catholic bishops. In what Vati£an sources said  prelate who was stripped of his priestly functions by Pope Paul VI. The analysts said the pope also might use the occasion to announce the name of a cardin­ pectore, " Latin for "in his breast." The pu1 ~ hve used the practice to pn ,ect a preble· named cardinal if he is in a communist cvuntry or anothe-r sensitive area.

Busick reports on stolen tickets 
by Stephen Sharp 
Thieves stole 36 season ticket packets from the mailboxes of South Bend residents, accord­ing to Mike Busick, ACC ticket manager. 
"Stealing mail is a federal offense," said Busick. "In my 5 years as ticket manager we've 
had  one  or  two  isolated  inci­ 
dents of theft, but  never  any­ 
thing of this proportion.''  

The mailbox thefts first came to Busick's attention 10 days ago when an ND faculty mem­ber called to report that his tickets had been stolen. He had learned of the theft from his newsboy, who said he saw 4 white males remove an envel­ope from the mailbox. Before the men drove off in a Volks­wagen; the newsboy said he heard one of the men say that it was time to get the ''other envelopes. ''

Busick said he expects the tickets to be scalped at a high price and is concerned about fans who eventually buy them. After these scalper's victims enter the stadium and sit in the stolen seats, ushers will escort them to the stadium security office for questioning. 
If the ~arne doesn't sell out, ushers will try to find different seats for those holding stolen tickets. If the game does sell out, however, ushers will escort the cheated fans from the stadium. Bu~ick wants fans to avoid this embarrassment. 

"I don't want students pay­ing scalper's prices for tickets and having their parents or other family members evicted from thf:" game," said Busick. 
Busick emphasized that any­one offered tickets by a scalper should contact the ticket office before buying in order to avoid confusion and financial loss. 

Robinson blames .food_fi~hts on drunken student conduct 
by Tim Sullivan StaffReporter 

In reaction to massive food fights in both dining halls after the 
Michigan football victory Saturday, Robert J. Robinson, Senior 
Food Service Director, released a statement yesterday which 
blames the incidents on "drunken, disorderly behavior." He 
also called for internal action by the student body to prevent a 
recurrance of the problem. 

"I'm not in love with what happened," Robinson statd, "but I 
won't condemn the student body. This is the work of a few 
drunken people, not everyone." 

According to one student witness, conditions in the North 
Dining Hall were ''chaotic; everyone was involved.'' Dining Hall 
employees said that large amounts of food were thrown and 
stuaents engaged in a great deal of ''drunken and abusive 
behavior. " 

· Bob Smith, manager of the South Dining Hall, called security 
and closed down one section for twenty minutes when conditions 
became uncontrollable. This is the first time that security has 
been called to the dining halls for food fights. 

One student worker suffere.d a chipped tooth and a bloody nose 
when he was assaulted in the North Dining Hall; two suspects 
were immediately apprehended. Though only 2 ID cards were. 
confiscated in this incident, dining hall workers said that many

WASHINGTON (AP) -A top 'Israeli official accused the United States of "showing 

I
weakness" in an unusual public shouting match that under­1 scores differences between the 
l
two countries. "You are soft," Defense Min­ister Ezer Weizman told Assist­

j 
ant Secretary of State Harold Saunders at the height of the exchange, "You lost Ethiopia. You lost Angola. And you lost Iran.'' 
In a tense exchange lasting more than an hour, Saunders, known as a soft-spoken diplo­mat, fired back that bombing southern Lebanon ultimately will prove to be a foreign policy disaster for Israel. 
" I'm warning you, Lebanon will be Jour VIetnam," Saun­ders tol W eizman. 
But Weizman, Israel's first air force chief, did not yield. 
"Don't tell me how to do anything," he said. And he then cnticized U.S. policy in Ethiopia, Angola and Iran. 
The arguTnent, in English, was carried on during a Saturday night cocktail f' .1 r r \. a1 the home of Israeli Ambassador Ephraim Evron. The guests included Defense Secretary Harold Brown and U.S. Middle East mediator Robert Strauss, but they had left before Saunders and W eizman, leaning on a bar in a paneled wood alcove, had their dispute. 
Israeli reports said it appar­ently was set off when Saunders admonished W eizman that the United States was not com­pletely consulted on an Egyp­tian-Israeli plan to patrol the Sinai Desert. 
"Is this called friendship?" s~ltmders reportedly asked. Fared ;vith published accounts ,,. <uur dispute, Weizman and Saunders wenl our of their ;vay Wednesday to project a spirit of good-fellowship. 
Reporters were advised to assemble in the lobby of the State Department where the two ministers, breaking off talks about Sinai peacekeeping operations, appeared. 
''I was very sorry it blew up like that," Weizman said. "But this is it, this is a democracy.'' 
W eizman called Saunders a friend and said, "Today we were very calm, and as usual, extremely friendly.'' 
One of the differences be­tween the United States and Israel is Israel's policy of bomb­ing Palestinian outposts in southern Lebanon, sometimes with the loss of civilian life On Wednesday, the United States again criticized the raids. 
The Israeli defense minister, in the exchange Saturday night with Saunders, s:-1id the prob­lem is that 15 ,OOl · .. ,"lf"d Pales­tine Liberation Organization

But Ms. Hennig objects to the ''gamesmanship'' approach to mastering the business world because, she says, "lt is not a game. Women who are taught to view it that way come away with negative feelings -that it'd dumb, or silly -and with no skills for dealing with it.''

Genius disappears 




Fantasy game causes concern 
by janet Rigaux 
] ames Dallas Egbert III, a 16-year-old genius Michigan State University student who was missing for 29 days was at ftrst feared dead by investiga­tors because of what appeared to be a live enactment of the game ''Dungeons and Drag­gons," an intellectual fantasy game. According to the Sept. 9 Chicago Tribune, Egbert was last seen in his dormitory cafeteria Aug 15. 
Inve~Ligators connected his disappearance with ''Dungeons and Dragons'' because of sever­al clues they found in his room and received from an­onymous sources. Egbert was reponed to be a "Dungeons and Dragons'' player in the Sept. 15 Detroit Free Press. 
The main clue that the investigators followed was what looked like a cn1de map made out of stickpins ~ nd thumbtacks left in Egbert's room that many thou~ht could lead to his where­abouts. The map seemed to be similiar to one that is used in

Boy genius reappears just as mysteriously as he vanished ; detective responsible 
EAST LANSING•Mich. (AP) ­The fall term opens this week at Michigan State University, but officials say they con't expect 16-year-old ] ames Dallas Eg­bert III back on the campus from which he vanished for a month for reasons still a mys­tery to even his parents. 
Before the computer science whiz turned UJ? safe last week, police and pnvate detectives, fearing he might be dead, conducted extensive searches of the subterranean entrails of the campus. 
The full story of his strange vanishing act perhaps is known only to the young man himself, and he is undergoing medical care near Dallas. 
"It's still a mystery to me," the youth's fathet, James Dal­las Egbert II, said in a tele­phone interview Tuesday from Dayton, Ohio, where her is a practicing optometrist. ''I don't think there's any actual prsf>f offoul play,rr~.­

Egbert said the full story may eventually come out, but ad­ded, ''I'm not going to push for it." 
Young Egbert, who has an IQ of 145, was picked up last Thursday at an undisclosed location after on Aug. 15. He was found by William Dear, a Texas private investigator hired by the farnily. 
E~bert, a sophomore at the umversity, was hunted for days in steam tunnels under the campus where he was known to act out a medieval fantasy game called "Dungeons and Dra­gons.'' The search later shifted to Wisconsin, where a conven­tion of devotees of the game was held. 
He was located after he made a series of emotional pre-dawn phone calls to Dear. The detective says thre GJther un­identified persons-two men and a woman-are linked to the disappearance, but have been 
. promised they ·W@n'·t-be·l'rostt~·· "Dungeons and Dragons" and looked like it may have been a lay-out of the MSU steam heating system, "a maze of underground tunnels that carry steam pipes and electrical con­duits to most buildings on the sprawling campus, reported the 
T1:bunr 
Egbert was found Sept. 13 by William Dear, a private investi­gator hired by the boy's family. His whereabouts and actions for those 29 days are not bein~ disclosed "to protect the famt­ly," according to the Press. 
Ken Peczkowski, owner of the Griffon Bookstore which is the center for "dungeons and drag­ons" in South Bend, said that after the articles connecting Egbert's disappearance with "dungeons and dragons" came out, he had many parents consider not allowing their childreh to play the game anymore. 
''Now thin~s have cooled off and in fact the articles are giving TSR (the company that produces and promotes ''Dun­geons and Dragons'') free 
cuted by the Egbert family. 
The youth's father thinks the 
detective is not telling every­
thing he knows. 
"I think without a doubt 
William Dear knows the com­
plete story,'' Egbert said. 
But Dear insisted he hasn't 
questioned young Egbert, even 
though he says he's as close to 
him as anybody. 
"I know when we tried to talk 
to him on the plane, it upset 
him," Dear said. "Once I feel 
that he's okay, maybe he'll 
remember-l'm not sure he re­
members." 
A friend of Egbert's, however, 
reportedly has talked with the 
youth since his reappearance. 
"He said the teacher. his 
paren1 -the people on his 'dormitory) floor, just every­body was JUmping down ·his throat and he wanted to get his head together," the Detroit ·Free Press quoted the unnamed 
friend as saying. '"' publicity," Peczkowski noted. He-also stated that the articles were misrepresenting the game. 
''Simply stated D&D is a multi-player game of fantasy role playing, where the rules give systems of resolution for common game occurrences, lists and explanations of things which are not actual (monster, spells and magic items), sys­tems for interaction and suggestions as to how to put this into the campaign, that is create the milieu, according to Gary Gygax, a founder of the game. DM (dungeon master) and Ior all of the players decide it should end. As with any exercise in fantasy it requires suspension of disbelief. Those who ftnd the game interesting will soon enough thereafter create their own sort of involve­ment and belief.'' 
Peczkowski elaborated, saying, "D&D is really a safe game that allows you to use you; imagination and act out a

Hall boards have been put under study for the first semes­ter to determine exactly what a hall board's functions are at present and what its functions will be in the future.

Through ND/AI 



Campus group aids prisoners abroad 
by Ros~marie Lawrence 
Three political prisoners are free and one is to be released because of the efforts of the Notre Dame chapter of Amnesty International (ND-AI), a social consciousness group. ND-AI hoJ?eS to aid more pri­soners th1s year through its letter-writing campaign. 
AI works for the release of persons who are held solely for their beliefs, language, ethnic origin, sex, religion or color, but only if these persons have not used or supported violence~ 
In 1961 a London lawyer, Peter Benenson, began fi letter­writing campaign to peacefully protest such illegal imprison­ment. Since then, Amnesty International has gained 168,000 members in 107 coun­tries and has helped 16,000 persons of whom 10,600 are now free. 
Each chapter "adopts" three political ,pnsoners, one from a Commumst country, one from a non-communist developed r:ountry and one from a third-world non-aligned nation, b..-t never from its native country. 

Following Benenson's ex­ample, the group writes letters to the prisoner's family and may help them financially. In addition, the group writes to government officials of the prisoner's country and asks for his release. AI never takes credit for the release of the prisoner. 
In 1977, Amnesty Interna­tional won the Nobel Peace Prize for its impartial efforts to further world peace. 
Early in 1977, Gilburt Loescher, a Notre Dame pro­fessor, civil rights author and member of the London chaeter of AI investigated the possibil­ity ofan ND chapter ofAmnesty International. A New York representative helped to organ­ize the group and since then, it has attracted faculty and stu­dents as well as South Bend residents. Loescher said that recently the balance of mem­bership has shifted toward a student majority. 
Monday, 28 persons attended an organizational meeting of ND-AI. John T. Murphy, student coordinator of the cam­pus chapter said the group is waiting for the London office to send them the names and addresses of a new prisoner. 
They are. presently helping a newly-freed man in Rhodesia by sending him and seven dependents relief money of $50 each month. 
"Although $50 doesn't sound like much here, in Rhodesia it is enough to keep this family alive. The man's fields had been burned and he had no way to feed his family," said Murphy. 
On campus this semester, AI is co-sponsoring the South African Conference on Oct. 12-13 with the World Hunger Coalition. In December, AI will present World Human Rights Day in an effort to raise total consciousness. Interested stu­dents should contact Professor Loescher or]ohn T. Murphy for more information on Amnesty International.

brush above Los Angeles, 8,200 acres of forest 50 miles north­west of Sacramento, and across 3,000 acres of forest in Plumas County in the northern part of the state. 
Because of the extreme ftre danger, the U.S. Forest Service revoked all burnin~ permits in the state's 17 nauonal forests yesterday and placed tight limits on access to four South­ern California preserves. A day earlier, the state hac! revoked all state burning permits on the 
31  million  acres  under  its  
control.  
Thousands  of  men  and  

women were working the ftre lines, and reserve firefighters were being flown in to relieve exhausted federal, state and county units. 
In the Eagle Canyon fire in Santa Barbara County, flames raced down the canyon after a fire broke out Tuesday, jumped a coast highway, and burned a path to the beach before swin~­mg north, finding more fuel m the Los Padres National Forest. The cause of the initial ftre was not known. 
Firefighters stabilized the fire at the edge of two large housing tracts, but several hun­

About 30 miles ofU.S. 101, a major coastal route, was closed · between Santa Barbara and Lampoc on Tuesday because of the ftres.

• • . Earthquake shakes Italy 
ROME (AP) -An earthquake shook central Italy from Flor­ence in the north to Naples in the south shortly before mid­night yesterday, killing at least ftve people and sending thou­sandsrunning into the streets. Buildings were damaged in dozens of towns including Rome. 
The worst-hit area was around 
Norcia, a medieval town of 
7,000 in the Umbrian region, ·the hilly heart of Italy. 
Police said a family of three died when a house collapsed at San Marco and two persons died under debris in Chtavano. Both villages are near Norcia. 
The streets of Norcia and villages in the Nerina Valley were littered with stones, bricks and chunks of walls. The Norcia Hospital was evacuated. 
Authorities reported tens of thousands of persons were camping out overnight in the Umbrian area. 
In Rome and the Vatican, walls of palaces and churches shook vtsibly. Chandeliers swayed and beds slid on the floor. Dogs barked and child­ren cried while anti-theft sirens of thousands ofcars were set off by the earth's movement. 
Police said there were no reports of casualties in the capital, and major historical structures such as the Colos­seum and the Forum appeared undamaged. 
The quake was felt throughout the Vatican, including the papal palace where John Paul II was reported still awake.

"I ~::..&l·L want to overreact, explamed Robmson, smce ultimately it boils down to peer pressure. The students must try to work out an internal solution.'' 
The statement, written and released by Robinson, called for student reaction in such public forums as The Observer, an~ ha11 council meetings. It also charges the Student Food Advtsory Board with the responsibility of addressing the matter at thetr ftrst meeting. It was not immediately clear when the ftrst meeting would take place. 
"I fully expect, after a big win, people on the tables singing the fight song,'' Robinson said, "This is a part of college life. I don't like it, however, when they start to thrqw food.'' . 
Robinson said that the situation will be closely momtored after the upcoming Purdue game, "We have rules and we must enforce them," he emphasized. We will pull IDs ifwe have to." 
He related the incident of lastJear's "Viking Night," when disorderly students threw food an created a mess in_both dinin~ halls. "Like that incident, we will try to stop tt before tt happens," he said. . .

Social Concerns Film Series ... 
Paying Union Dues ... Norma Rae 
Since its release in the winter of 
1979, "Norma· Rae" has received 
mostly favorable reviews from the 
more popularly known film critics. 
Some of its harshest reviews have 
come largely from those who_ expect 
either too much or the worst of the 
American labor movement. As one 
formerly involved in the J.P. Stevens 
textile workers' struggle (which is 
what the movie is really about), I 
ascribe to neither set of expectations 
about trade unionism. Yet, I deem 
the movie a fairly accurate and 
appealing portrayal of the workers' 
struggle, symbolized by Norma Rae 
(in real life Crystal Lee Jordan, now 
living in Burlington, North Carolina), 
against the most anti-union company 
in the federal courts and National 
Labor Relations Board annals dating 
back to 1937, symbolized by the O.P. 
Henley Company (in real life the J.P. 
Stevens Company). 
While serving as Catholic Liason for 
the Amalgamated Clothing and Tex­
tile Workers Union in its boycott of 
theJ .P. Stevens' products, I strained 
to maintain my objectivity and credi­
bility. My personaL efforts were 
aided by the public record of the 
company compared to the union's, 
and by the company's refusal to a 
public debate or any third-party 
mediation of the issues. This 
contrasted greatly with the union's 
openness to cooperation with others. 
When the movie "Norma Rae" 
became a helpful public relations 
instrument, I took pains to research 
the genesis of the film. The results 
w<-r<· affirmative. 
The film is one more creation, without ACTWU'S prompting or collaboration, of a director know for his box-office successes and failures with "social issue" films. Before ·the film was released Twentieth Century Fox was threatened by Crytal Lee Jordan with a lawsuit 
Another view 
If the Social Concerns Film Series is supposed to provide us with food for intellectual and ethical . thought (not to mention action), then "Norma Rae" can only be compared to a fast-food franchise for social justice junkies. Its smorgasbord of social injustices go down too easily to be fully digested and are thus of no nutritional value to the consumer's consctence. 
Among the dishes quickly offered up are capitalist exploitation in a small, southern, one company O.P. Stevens?), mill town; church collusion with the company and therefore moral (though certainly not financial) bankruptcy; blue-collar alienation amidst sweat-shop conditions; sexploitation and sexual hypocrisy; ractal prejudice; anti­semitism; brown lung disease; deafness, even if only temporary as the company doctor assures Norm' Rae's long-suffering silent mother; heart attack, its symptoms also only temporary for _her red-neck, though loving soon-to-be-dead father ... the possibilities are endless, so h.ave it your way. 
If film is supposed to entertain us with an interesting story, good acting, fine photography, etc., then ''Norma Rae'' can only be compared to a magic show. Its visual images across the screen are quicker than the mind, mostly because they are so superficial. The movie goes through a series of well paced tricks and gimmicks that titillate and humor us, but leave us wanting -and certainly deserving -something of greater 
-~ance. 
for invasion of privacy. After conferences between the producers and Crystal Lee Jordan some changes were made. Privacy was better protected, no factual dis­tortion was introduced, and the lawsuit has not ensued. 
Approaches were made to textile companies to do action filming on their premises. Repeated rejec­tions finally prompted cooperation from a unionized plant in Alabama. To simulate the noise and cotton­dust levels prevalent in most Southern textile mills, some noise­abating devices were temporarily adjusted and plant sweeping and air­removal procedures were suspended for a time. 
No halo-effect was added to Crys­tal Lee's characte:ization. In fact, 
A fine example of this is the 
improbability of Ruben Washofsky's courtly love for Norma Rae, whtch becomes a tease for both her and us, but which does go through the appropriat_!:" motion~: he rescues her from the villainous traveling sales­man who offers her a steak dmner, a box of pralines and three orgasms in exchange for his own adulterous, sexual pleasure; he then tempts her by swimming nude while she washes his outer garments (not his underwear!); and he finally leaves her aching to be kissed outside the redeemed mill (i.e., castle), as he rides off on his trusty Pinto, armed for further adventures with three ftling cabinets, an off-print machine, and a typewriter. Sir Galahad could not have done it better. 
And how quick.ly the racial tension 
is overcome, if tension you can cill it when there is only one confrontation in the entire movie, and that one a mere exchange of punches. Our fearless knight, armed with pen and pamphlet and crested with a hammer and cycle star of David, succeeds here too. 
These, and other situations, are perverse because gratuitous; they are no more substantial than a ma_gic show, no more nourishing than a fast food meal. A Big Mac I can take when the family is in a hurry or the budget a squeeze, but when McDonald's tries to convince me that I should celebrate my wedding anniversary there... 
The substance of the Norma Rae 
story is far other than the movie 
would have us believe. Those of you some of the more moving scenes of the film depict her rambunctious anger and explanation to her chil­dren of her not-so-delicate past. There was some dissatisfaction by the union's leadership with the or­ganizer's behavior. Both Crystal Lee and the organizer have some cri'ticism of the union. Yet, sev­eral "talk-show" appearances by Crystal Lee reveal her continued support for the unionization of tex­tile workers. 
Contrast was made between Black Church support and White church opposition or lethargy toward the tex­tile workers' struggle. While his­torically and currently there appear exceptions, the film's account is gen­erally true. Since the film's com­pletion support among White reli-
Rev. Pat Sullivan 
who saw her on ''60 Minutes'' andI or ''Tommorrow'' already know that she is a fine, strong woman of integrity, as Sally Field convincingly depicted her, but also know that 1) the mill was never unionized, 2) the husband did not stay married to her long enough to see her grow ''tired, sick, and old" (as Sonny promises he will), and 3) neither Ruben nor the stillborn union were able to force the Henley mill to rehire Norma Rae. That the movie leaves the audience thinking all three of these things come to pass is a cinematic injustice in itself, and whatever value derives from exposing viewers to the sweat-shop horrors of small mill towns, and the guts and beauty of an uneducated, but committed woman is largely dissipated by the valueless, nutritton­less way in which artistic liberties were taken. 
Perhaps the writer and Ior director, in an attempt to redress the various illusions and distortions, intended the poignancy of the last scene to steer us back to reality. There we see Norma Rae, fenced out from work and friends for whom she· sacrificed so much, away from husband and family, deserted by her courtly lover, Sir Ruben. She's left with nothing but her Dylan Thomas words about love, death, and suffering -things of substance (as Ruben calls them) which the movie itselffails to give us. 
It is a moving scene, perhaps an acknowledgement of the reality upon which the movie and we should be strengthened, but one scene is not enough to redeem the movie from its magica~ illusions and fast food packagmg.

gious groups has increased, due largely to increased publicity about the .T .P. Stepht>ns controversy. The 
Nationai Council of Churches, the 1')7') !'rt:sbyterian General Assem­bly, and the Catholic Bishops in Southeast dioceses have said some 
very uncomplimentary things about the J.P. Stevens Company's behav­ior. There are many reasons for White religious groups' indifference or opposition. Among them are a reluctance to alienate a large mem­bership among management, a wide­spread ignorance about labor law, and the complexities of the tex­tile industry. 
While the film depicted company tactics to discourage union-support and collusion with public officials, the examples were of the more blatant wpe. More subtle tactics were missing. That is, viewers were not exposed to endless legal delays that sap initial unionizing fervor, nor to private meetings among like-minded managers, nor to firing of union-organizers, nor refusal of loans or credit by local banks and store-keepers prior to a union election. 
. Perhaps such detailed presentation of J.P. Stevens tactics is asking more than time limitations allowed in a film, which was so gentle on ACTWU. However, such a film, should be taken as no more repre­sentative of all corporations, any more than "Blue Collar" and "F. I.S.T." should, be taken as repre­sentative of all unions. Most importantly, any such films should, hopefully, prompt us to·.. become more informed about and Involved . in improving relationships between corporations and unions.

For energy efforts 
State cotntnends Fr. Riehle 
by john Cassidy 

Fr. ] ames Riehle, the direc­tor of the Energy Conservation Department at the University, has saved an estimated $600,000 in energy costs over the past 4 to 5 years, according to the Indiana Department of Commerce Energy Group. 
Riehle explained, "Energy was conserved in part due to the new timers on the lights in the classrooms, the new ther­mostats in the halls, and engin­eering improvements in the power plant itself.'' 
According to Riehle, "With proper use of the thermostats in each room, the University hopes to save 20 to 30 percent of the fuel it consumes.'' Instruction sheets on the use an proper treatment of the thermostats will soon be dis­tributed, he said. 
Riehle said hefore:-;ees no".ew major developments to help conserve energy in the near future, but we will be using a new shut-off system on the motors that heat Hayes-Healy and the Law School for when they are not in use. " 
'

Riehle also stated that ''Notre Dame should have no fears aboJ.!t having enough heat this winter as the school will remain independent and is capable of burning oil, coal, or natural gas. ' ' ·

Women adjust to corporate

communtty 
NEW YORK (AP) -No lamb 
venturing into the world of 
corporate wolves need wander 
blindly ever again. Indeed, 
the mmd boggles at the choices 
facing a woman who wants to 
learn her way around the 
corporate world. 
She can attend a host of 
"workshops" and "seminars" 
that purport to tutor female 
beginners on corporate politics. 
She can buy a book like 
"Games Mother Never Taught 
You; Corporate Gamesmanship 
for Women," or "Winning at 
Office Politics," or "The 
Woman's Dress for Success 
Book,'' or ''Business as a 
Game,'' or ''Think Like a Man 
Act Like a Lady, Work Like ~ 
Dog." 
. Everybody, it seems, is try­
mg to help -and to cash in on a 
good thing: the new demand in 
business for women to fill 
executive and management 
jobs and the soaring number of 
women with a new ambition to 
pursue careers -not just jobs ­
m the corporate world. 
But academic and coporate 
experts warn that an ambitious 
woman who masters the 
fashionable "corporate games­
manship'' approach to getting 
ahead may be doing herself 
more harm than good. 
"You can carry these things 
too far," says Pat Carlson, a 
senior management develop­
ment consultant with 
Prudential Insurance in 
Newark, "What I'm finding 
now among young women is 
more and more concern with 
gamesmanship and not enough 
concern about doing the job.'' 
Dr. Margaret Hennig, co­director of the graduate pro­gram in management at Simmons College in Boston, calls the corporate gamesman­ship approach ''gimmicky,'' and adds: "You cannot deal with sophisticated problems like these by talking in banali­ties.'' 
"I don't see that these seminars do much good -all this stuff is so fundamental, so basic, that a smart woman picks it up instantly," says Thomas Hubbard, president of The Career Planning Corp.

Asa student, probably your biggest single task is information pro­cessing. You spend more time absorbing, analyzing, and memorizing facts than anything else. And most ofthat informa­tion is in the form ofprinted words. 
Think what you could accomplish ifyou had your own personal computer that could digest all your reading almost as fast as you can turn pages. The time and efficiency you'd gain could make a big change for the better in your life right now. 
Ofcourse, you already have such a device -it's called a brain. But you're probably not using even a tenth ofits capacity. Because just as a computer is ~mly as good as its programs, your brain is only as powerful as the way you use it. And when it comes to reading, most of us are still stuck with the painfully slow methods we learned in grade school. Methods that are so inefficient that your brain actually gets bored and distracted between words (which is why you prob­ably find it hard to concentrate when you're studying). 
Evelyn Wood would like you to spend an hour with us to discover some of the miraculous things your brain can do with the proper training. In a single, free, 1 hour demonstration, you'll find out why most people are such poor readers, and how our new RD2 course can increase your reading speed at least 300%, with better concentration and retention. As part ofthe bargain, we'll show you some new reading techniques designed to in­crease your speed immediately, with good comprehension-afterjust this one free demonstration. 
Evelyn Wood RD2 can open the door to big things for you: better grades, more leisure time, and a whole new pos­itive outlook on studying. 
And it will only cost you an hour of "computer time" to find out how.

U.S. remains w-atchdog force in Mid-East 
Washington (AP)-Up to 200 
U.S. civilians would remain in the Sinai Desert to help monitor the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty under a tentative agree­ment announced yesterday. 
American aerial reconnais­sance also was assigned a key role in the formula reached durin& two days of intensive negotiations. The principal peacekeeping role was &iven to Egypt and Israel, whtch will form mixed patrols. 
Secretary of State Cyrus Vance, flanked by smiling Egyptian and Israeli ministers, announced the settlement at the State Department. 
He said U.N. truce super­visors might play a supple­mentary role. But Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe Dayan made clear that Egypt and Israel were assuming the major responsibility. 
Congress will have to give its approval for Americans to re­main in the Sinai, Vance said the formula also will be submit­ted to the Egyptian and Israeli governments. 
Initially, the U.N. Emergency Force was to monitor Israel's withdrawal over three years u~der terms of the peace treaty wtth Egypt. But the Soviet Union, in deference to Arab allies opposed to the treaty, blocked that approach in the 
U.N. Security Council. 

University seeks to reach high school students 
Each year more and more high school juniors and seniors express an interest in attending the University of Notre Dame. 
Many of these interested students have no contact with 
Notre  Dame  other  than  that  
provided  by  the  application  
catalogue.  

Last year, concern over pro­viding adequate, responsible, and factual information to pros­pective applicants brought about the initiation of the Undergraduate Schools Com­mittee. The Undergraduate Schools Committee is a joint venture of the Office of Admis­sions and Student Government consisting of students who have expressed a desire to visit their high school as a representative of the University. All inter­ested students must be inter­viewed by a representative of the Admissions Office and, if selected for the program, must attend a training session some­time during the week before October break. Visits to high schools will take place over October break. 
Any students interested in applying must pick up an application at either the Admis­sions Office, 413 Flanner Hall, or 204 Lyons Hall and must return the application to one of those locations no later than September 25. Early appli­cation is encouraged. The ftrst 150 applicants will be contacted and scheduled for an interview. Anyone having questions regarding the Undergraduate Schools Committee should con­tact Terri Wareham at 7883 or Tom Kozloski at 6981.

[continued on page 4] 
J-Boards. O'Hare feels the hall J -Boards must bl·Lome open to students. He said he bf"lieves ther can _do ~his by ''developing an tdenncy m the hall and bv becoming more aligned with hall government. Keeping the lines of communication open be­tween the hall J -Board and the hall government will make the board more open to the stu­dents." 
Shaughnessy agreed with this and added, "Most impor­tant in establishing the hall J-Boards is to get the rector to recognize it and get the stu­dents aware of it. This should be done by the )-Board chair­men." 
The J -Council wants to help 
the hall J -Boards not onlv with 
judicial matters but others as 
well, O'Hare said. O'Hare and 
Shaughnessy stated that '')­
Boards are not limited just to 
offenses--they can aid the hall 
government in revisions of hall 
constitutions, hall elections and 
other matters. They should be 
a source of advice for students 
who desire information about 
duLac." 
To help the hallJ-Boards, the · council held a workshop for hall J-Board chairmen last Thurs­day. The workshop was organi­ed by the counseling center. O'Hare said rhaL the workshop went well and was very pleased with the fact that each hall had a representative at the work­shop. 
J -Boards are still concerned with disciplinary actions and holding hearings on offenses. The general .t>rocedure for hall offenses requtres the accused to attend a hearing by the J-Board or to go to the hall rector. Yet some hall J-Boards aren't util­ized ~ffectively by students, accordmg to Shau~hnessy. 
O'Hare sees this not as the fault of the rector, but "due possibly to traditions within the hall. Perhaps a certain hall board wasn't effective in a certain incident so the residents of that hall don't use it." 
As both O'Hare and Shaughnessy emphasized, the goal of the J -Council and J-Boards this year is to make students aware of their pres­ence and to become a source of information to students. They want to be sure students know where they stand if accused of an offense. Shaughnessy summed it up: "We want to make hall life easier and more enjoyable for the students."

"Obviously, we had to ftnd a way to deal with that important issue, and we have done so satisfactorily," Vance said. 
American technicians were ftrst sent to the Sinai in 1975 to help monitor two partial Israeli pullbacks. The mission was supposed to end, with the U.N. force taking over. 
Keeping the Americans there, Vance said, "ij., merely an extension of the role which the Sinai fteld mission has been playing in the past." 
Vance stressed that the ar­rangement is an interim one-to last up to three years. Beyond that point, he said, there is no agreement.

Belles, Irish battle to tie 

by Beth Huffman Women's Sports Editor 

When St. Mary's and Notre Dame women meet on an athletic field, the intense com­petitive spirit and rivalry can lead to an exciting contest. Such was the case last night, when the Irish and the Belles battled to a 2-2 tie in field hockey action at Cartier Field. 
The Notre Dame team, play­ing their first game of the year, opened the scoring, as junior Pat Crowell scored on an assist from freshman Kathy Ray. Later in the first half senior co-captain Sue McGlinn added the final Irish tally, assisted by Ray and Crowell.

The 6-foot-9 forward, who shunned reporters last season-­supposedly because he wanted his teammares to share the limeligh: ··now talks to anyone who poses a question at Celtics' workouts at Hellenic College in 
Brookline, Mass. "I don't have any statistical ~oals," Bird said last week. 
'I just want to go out on the floor every night and give 100 percent." 
Is playing in the NBA the realization of a lifelong dream? "Not really," he answers. 
•'When I was in college, all I thought about was college games. It's dangerous to think too far ahead. Now, it's a whole new game."

match, but senior Kelly Sullivan brought the Belles even with her goal. 
"I am very pleased with the hard work in practice and in our season opener,'' Irish coach Astrid Hotvedt said after the game. "The girls showed good poise and stick work.'' 
Last night's contest was the third for the Belles this year, after dropping matches to Taylor (5-0) and DePaul (2-1), and coach Ann Diede was pleased with the team's perfor­mance. "We improved as we played--we're a young team with not much experience, with six players new to the squad. The tie was a good team effort, with all the squad members contributing. :• 
The nature of the rivalry led to some intense play on both sides. "We were really up for the Notre Dame match," Diede said, "and it added greatly to our playing." Hotvedt added that • 'we were missing oppor­tuniti~s early in t~e g~~e. We were JUSt too exctted. 
Hotvedt said much of the trouble the Irish encountered stemmed from the difficulties they had converting the ball from defense to offense. 
"We have a lot of good talent, especially in the fresh­men,'' said Irish co-captain Donna Carini, "and combined with our experience we do well. But s.~metimes things don't mesh. 
"Things didn't come toget­her all the time,'~ added co-cap­rain McGiin. "The offense did do a good job around the .cage, however.'' McGlinn said the Irish schedule is tough this year, but feels • • the team should do really well." 
The Belles will try and im­prove their season record of 0-2-1 when they meet Goshen next Tuesday in a home con­test, beginning at 4:30p.m. on the field next to Madeleva. 
The Irish face Taylor this Saturday on Cartier Field be­ginning at 11 a.m.

jackson-Yankees feuding continues 
NEW YORK (AP) -Reggie Jackson's running feud with owner George Steinbrenner of the New York Yankees intensi­fied Tuesday, and Manager Billy Martin reportedly ha15 insisted that the volatile, $2.9 million superstar be traded. 
In Cleveland, where the Yan­kees played the Indians in a night game, Martin acknowl­edged that he had talked with General Manager Cedric Tallis about possible trades -• 'Not just Jackson'' -but denied he had specifically put the finger on Reggie. 
"I have said that I. get tired of 
rid·inr up the paper every day ::nd ;l'vmg a headline about this player saying something about that player or the owner," 
Martin said. 
"It's not the Yankee way. It's disruptive. I don't like it." 
Steinqrenner, meanwhile, held a drawn-out meeting in his New York headquarters with Tallis. Afterward, Steinbren­ner said he did not want to get personally involved in the latest controversy which grew out of the Catfish Hunter Day Sunday at Yankee Stadium. Tallis was equally dose-mouthed. 
However, a Yankee source said Martin twice had stormed into Tallis' office in recent days and requested that some provi­sion be made for trading Jack­son. Martin reportedly cited perils to team morale. 
] ackson, frequently at odds with both Martin and Stein­brenner, relighted old fires with the assertion that he was de­nied the privelege Sunday of presenting a special gift to his long-time teammate and friend pitcher Hunter, who has an­nounce retirement at the end of the season. 
Reggie, a teammate with Hun­ter on the Oakland A's champi­onship teams in 1972-73-74, said he had brought to the stadium a golden replica of the World Series trophy with 26 golden banners appropri3:tely engraved: "World Champwns 1972-1973-1974-1977-1978. To Catfish Hunter From Reggie Jackson." 
"George wouldn't let me pre­sent it on the field,'' Jackson told the New York Daily News. "I don't know why. I am not trying to be different. I am giving it because Cat and I have been together 10 years ... '' 
Steinbrenner did. deny that he 
had nixed Reggies's special act. "I didn't 'know anything about it," the owner said. "Last week Mickey Norabito (Yankee publicity director) had told me Reggie wanted to present the players' gift to Catfish. I said OK if that's what the players want.''

Leveling commences 
Groundleveling has begun on the construction site for Saint Mary's new softball field, track, and field hockey field. Accord­ing to Saint Mary's Athletic Director, Jerry Dallessio, LaFre Excavating Inc., ofOsceola, has been chosen for the project which is located behind the McCandless parking lot. 
Hopes are that the softball field will be completed for the start of the Belles' spring season. Last year's 5-5 Belles team hosted its home games at Boland Park. 
A field hockey field will be constructed at the site, however this field is not slated for completion until next fall. Currently the SMC field hockey team practices and competes on the field adjacent to Madeleva Hall. 
A cinder track will surround the new field hockey green. 
The track, also to be completed by the fall of 1980, will open for recreation purposes. Currently Saint Mary's does have cross country running as a club sport, but there is no track team. 
Funds for the fields and track were appropriated through a special account.
