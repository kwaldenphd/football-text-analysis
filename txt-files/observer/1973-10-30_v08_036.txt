SLC listens to status of blacks 
Black Student Affairs Director addresses meeting 
by Kurt Heinz Staff Reporter 
The status of Black Students on campus was the dominant concern of Monday's Student Life Council meeting. 
Cassell Lawson, director of Black Student Mfairs, addressed the meeting and then answered the council's questions along with students Ron Newkirk, Lionel Phillips, and Stan Harris. 
Lawson said that he was satisfied with Univer­sity's improvement in the area but suggested that more should be done. 
Noting that the University had adhered to the demand of hiring him, Lawson called for the hiring of more black rectors assistants. Last year there were two black RA's while this year there are three. 
Black house plans 
Lawson said that the demands for a black house 
somewhere off-campus are dormant due to the 
success of the Black Cultural Arts Center. The 
center is used by the UJAMMA Society, the New 
Frontier Society, and Black graduate students. 
Lawson claimed that the criticism that white students are intimidated by the Black Cultural Arts Center is not valid. He noted that at the last func­tion 25 whites were present out of a crowd of 75. 
Lawson also citicized the administration for not 
consulting black leaders before making ad­
ministrative appointments. 
.B. policeman hurt in game enthusiasm 
by Valerie Zurblis Staff Reporter 
The enthusiasm of last Satur­day's victory celebration resulted in the destruction of the goal post at the south end of the stadium and 
the  injury  of  a  South  Bend  
policeman.  
Sargeant  Bruce  Stickley  ap­ 

parently tried to stop the group of fans from tearing down the poles when he was hit over they eye with one of the poles. 
The unconscious policeman was then taken to the hospital by squad car, received five sutures and was released. He went blank on the incident and doesn't remember what exactly happened. The in­vestigation is still under way and as of yet there is no evidence that any other assault occurred. 
Robert Cahill, Business Manager of Athletics, says his main concern at the game was where he was going to get another goal post for this week's home game against Navy. Since it is too late in the season to order another pair of $1800 goal posts one from a practice field will be modified to comply with collegate rules. It will not be arched and therefore it won't match the other post but it will be workable. 
Cahill expected the students to try to pull the poles down but didn't expect them to be completely destroyed. "If they pull this one down, I won't know what to do," commented Cahill. 
The injury to Stickley was regretted most by Cahill. He was also concerned about the extra trampling the field received. Due to a bad fungus on the turf this year even the J.V. players have been forced to play on the artificial turf instead of the stadium. 
He felt that it was unfortunate for the coaching staff and football team that they have to play on a field that is not up to par. 
Dean of Students, Fr. Terence Lally, understands how the fans felt after the win but was worried that someone could possibly be trampled or seriously hurt. He w~s more apprehensive, though, w1th students, alumni, and staff who drink in excess at the games. He feels they are "unaccountable for their actions and are un­conscious to the other people around them." 
Fr. Lally commented that although the victory was a great one and he understands the exuberance of the fans, he wonders what they do with the goal post after they take it home.'' 
"The appointment of the Minority Affairs Commissioner seemed to be arbitrary," he said. "Though I do not disagree with the appointment, I feel that some of the black leaders should have been consulted. I would hope that the University would not follow this precedent." 
Long range goals 
Lawson said that his long range goal was to assure the academic excellence of black students. 
He revealed that there was a strong chance that a faculty member would donate $1,000 to help this goal. The money would be used to reward students who improved their grade point averages. 
Under the plan, Lawson said, groups of students in each dormitory would register with Lawson's office. Money would go to the group with the most improved average, as well as the student who most improved. 
Increased enrollment 
When asked in what areas the University could be doing more, Lawson replied that they could be doing more to increase black enrollment. "The national average is 5.6 per cent black students, while Notre Dame has less than 3 per cent. So, I think a lot more could be done here," he said. 
Newkirk, Phillips, and Harris generally con­curred with Lawson's remarks. They emphasized that spending money was a great problem among black students, noting that many students accepted on scholarship still can not afford to attend. 
Newkirk said that "most blacks need more money. We feel that we can handle the problems of grades and the social life, but money is the real problem." 

Blacks in student gov't. 
All three expressed the desire to elect qualified blacks to Student Government. The possibility of representatives of Lawson's office attending SLC meetings on a regualr basis was also discussed. 
In other business, the SLC discussed the rewriting of the Student Manual. Father David Shlaer, director of Student Mfairs said that the entire manual needed rewriting, not just the rules. It was decided that the new rules would be promulgated by the dean of students office. 
Student rights next topic 
The council will take up the question of rewriting 
the student rights section of the manual, at next 
Monday's meeting. 
Nominations for the University and Appeals 
Boards will also be voted on at the next meeting, 
which will be held in executive session.

.. Washington UPI -The White House recommended Monday that the controversial issue of trade concessions for the Soviet Union be temporarily shelved while negotiations are under way to acheve peace in the Middle East. 
But Peter M. Flanigan, an assistant to the President for in­ternational economic affairs, said the basic position of the administration that commercial reactions with the Soviet Union should be broadened had not changed.

suggests U.S. parliament 
by Pat Hanifin 
Staff Reporter 
Prof. I<,erdinand A. Hermens claimed in his lecturl! last night that Vietnam and Watergate are inherent in our system of govern­ment and that we should change to an English-model parliamentary system. 
"The President has acted in disregard of the people and reality," according to Hermans, which Congress has failed to take positive action 
"The executive must be more than an executor" Hermens said. "The law cannot cover all situations, especially in foreign affairs, and we need somebody who can take quick and decisive action. But at the same time this has raised the danger of irrational decisions by presidents who are cut off from the American people and from reality by their power." 
Hermens, a former government professor , claimed that this separation from reality was particularly apparent in the domestic . Watergate situation where inexperienced White House staff members failed to criticize decisions and acted in "a vacuum of free and independent discussion." Without this in ­dependent criticism, Hermens said, there is no "test of reality." 
It is here that Congresss becomes valuable in foreign policy making and according to Hermens view, Congress has three special roles: using its broad contacts with the people to develop a consensus; restraining the executive by in­dependent criticism; and taking constructive action as part of the foriegn policy team. 
"Unfortunately," Hermens pointed out, "Congress has been isolated from the decision making process, and when in the past they have taken action, it has generally been merely nagative opposition to the President. Because Congress is so large and varied they find it very difficult to reach agreement on positive action." 
Hermens, Fellow of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for 'Scholars at the Smithsonian Institute, offered as a possible solution to the problem the change to a parliamentary system as in England. "The advantages would be that the members of the cabinet would also be members of the legislature, powerful and in­dependent in their own right, and wojld represent all major views in the majority party. And if the prime minister goes his own way too much the legislature can throw the rascals out". 
However, Hermens pointed out there was far too much opposition on the part of the public for this to have any practical chance of coming to pass. "As a partial 1 solution we might retain the

Give A Ticket 
The Neighborhood Study Help Tutoring Program is once again asking the Notre Dame student body todonate their tickets to the Navy game this Saturday and the student body should answer that call. 
For the past three years, the program has met with amazing success habeing been endorsed by both Fr. Hesburgh and Ara. Upwards of two hundred South Bend kids have benefited from this program each year in the past. And now the program needs the help of us all again. 
Thetimeis appropriate. Fresh from the exuberance of the ND over USC triumph, the team is -going to match plays with Navy. Let's face it, barring unforeseen accidents and bad breaks, we should beat Navy without too much trouble. The game will nonetheless be exciting as always but to give up your ticket for such a worthy cause this time will not work all that great a hardship on you. WNDU will televise the game anyway. These kids will most likely be getting their first chance to see a college football game. Moreove1r, it is a Notre Dame game which wm mean a great deal more to these kids not only now but in retrospect in years to come. 
As for future home games, there will be Air Force on Thanksgiving Day and, most likely, a bowl game in our im­mediate future, somissingthis one Navy game at home, while a sacrifice since we must keep rolling on, in the long run will not hurt either you or the team. Giving up the tickets will mean a lot to the team and having a stand full of kids cheer for the Irish can only spur the team to even greater lheights of glory. 
But more important than these pragmatic reasons is that you should donate your ticket not only as a sacrifice, but also because it is a Christian act of giving something needed to one who needs.

Sorry, Psych-ers 
Charges in yesterday's Observer that Friday's rally was a poor one stand today. However, the charges that a lack of foresight plagued the rally were perhaps a bit injudicious. 
Rally organizer Dan Doody accepted the full blame yesterday for the poor rally but admitted that many of the problems were things beyond his control. 
For example, Stepan Center had been contracted last May for the rally and three weeks prior to the rally, the event was kicked out to make room for the Homecoming dance. Use of the Fieldhouse and the ACC could not be obtained so Doody was forced to find a well-lighted areaand the Stepan lot was the best available area. 
A proper stage could not be built because thematerialshad been destroyed when the storage barn on campus burned 
daanesbury 

down in September. The area for the band was roped off, but Doody said they missed the entrance prepared for them and in attempting to get in from the other side of the stage, a great many students had to be pushed out of the way. In that excitement, the two speakers that were to be used were pushed over and one of them was knocked out of commission. 
Doody claimed that it was a minor miracle that the rally came off and no one was hurt in a crowd that was clearly out of contr<Jl. · 
He's right on the point and The Ob­server must admit that we jumped the gun on Doody's group. Een though it was a bad rally, the circumstances surrounding it make it now impossible to pin any blame.

Last Paint Impeachment on Suspicion 
j.napier 

"Impeach Nixon," the cry rises. "Yes, impeach him." Why? "Because we suspect he is guilty of stealing money to build two 
palaces, we think he offered ITT a plum in exchange for San Diego; and we think he danced in the cacophanous ethics of Robert Vesco. Yes, because we think he did all this, he must be impeached. No need for further investigation. We suspect him now; impeach him now." 
And so history may now record the first President ever impeached on suspicion. 
This suspicion is a verypotent tool. Many peoples have used it to eradicate the worst elements in their societies. Suspicion enabled the Puritans to eradicate witches. Ancient societies employed suspicion to stone devils out of people, while the inquisition utilized it as a weapon against heretics. Fortunately, suspicion excised this villainy from each of these societies before it was too late. 
Let it be with America, too. Let Richard Nixon and the witches stand together on the same scaffold. 
I:.ocal Lynching 
"Nixon is above the law," claim the impeachers. 
But where does their suspicion end and their direct proof begin? One would hardly state such drastic condemnations on mere suspicion. Indeed, respectable journalism and formal critics often pride themselves on being above suspicion and conjecture. For them, judgment begins where rumor ends and guilt can be proven. 
Perhaps local, respectable journalism is privy to information inaccessible to the remainder of the world. Local journalism may have found a cache of Perry Mason evidence buried in the laws of logic. If the world also follows the rules of the syllogism, maybe they too will become as enlightened as the local seers. Try it world: 
Premise: Richard Nixon is a crook. (Impeachers say they've always known this.) 
Premise: Some crooked acts have taken place while Nixon was in office. 
Conclusion: Nixon must be in on it. 
Clearly, numerous "If's" permeate this "Syllogism" (pardon me, Greeks). When these ifs are viewed by people who have never claimed a close afinity to Richard Nixon, they may encounter a propensity to jump from the springboard of suspicion into the empty pool of un­justified conclusions. 
The Cox Issue 

Was Cox's firing an impeachable· offense? From a strictly legal point of view, Cox is an employee of the executive branch. Does the head of the executive branch of the United Stateshave a legal right to terminate the employment of an executive branch employee? No one denies Richard Nixon possesses this legal privilege. 
However, if Nixon does have this right and if he does exercise this right, can he be impeached for what he was legally entitled to do? Although the impeachers amazingly still cry, "Yes", the absurdity of their position is obvious. The impeachers simply do not realize im­peachment is not a question of whether one agrees with the firing of Cox, but whether or not the President may be impeached for actions well within his legal rights. 
Keep Away From Salem 
If the House of Representatives does intend to continue with im­peachemnt proceedings with only the suspicion of the present, it must revert to a definition of impeachment last used when Justice William 
0. Douglas was threatened with impeachment. As one House leader said, "An impeachable offense is anything the House thinks is an impeachable offense," The danger in this attitude is clear. 
Unless the impeachment movement rises above the primitive "Gut", suspicion level of the present, the movement will continue to wallow somewhere in between a political vendetta reminiscent of An­
drew Johnson's days and the suspicion of Salem. Our republic needs neither.

Kissinger's Prize 
Editor: 
Mr. Barrett's editorial on Kissinger and Tho misses the whole point of the Nobel Peace Prize. The record of award win­ners would seem to indicate that the Prize is awarded more for honest effort to achieve peace and a stable world order than for the achievement of peace itself. So it was, for example , with Willy Brandt. By no stretch of the imagination could it be said that he achieved detente in Europe or that he even achieved detente between the two Germanys. He did change the direction of West German foreign poicy by committing the 
Federal Republic to an ac­ceptance of the status quo in Europe and to the renunciation of violence and force in redressing whatever wrongs may have been inflicted on Germany as a result of World War II. We do not know whether Brandt's policy in the long run will achieve peace in Europe. Dissident men of letters in the Soviet Union have warned us that detente may actually lead to greater tyranny than now exists in the world. Be that as it may, Brandt won the Nobel Prize, and justifiably so, because of his honest effort to acheive detente and thus to pierce, however slightly, the barriers that separate men from each other in today's world. Some men have been awarded the Nobel Peach Prize because of their dreams of peace. Witness Martin Luther King. Why then should we reproach Kissinger for accepting the peace Prize. We forget that peace comes in many shadings. Though the guns in Vietnam are not silent, the level of violence has been reduced immesaurably, and largely because of the patience , good will, and craftsmanship of Tho and Kissinger. This is no mean accomplishment and one fully deserving, in my view, of the Nobel Peace Prize.

Mockery of Prayer 

Editor: I was shocked to encounter this noon. over the execrable coffee of the North Dining Hall, the little blurb hiding at the bottom of th~ second last page of today's <Oc­tober 25th) Observer entitled "Stanford Prays for Irish Vic­tory." I thought that the idea of 
purchasing favors from the almighty, banished once from the Church in her shame over the simonistic practices of John Tetzel and others in the Middle Ages, and banished again to a lesser degree by Vatican II, was a thankfully dead practice. 
But the consciousness of Western consumism, coupled with a misguided thirst for victory, manages once again to raise this unpretty Lazarus from the dead. The next step, I guess, is to equip the football players with shields and paint small crosses on their helmets. 
For there exists a subtle dif­ference between praying for the ability to live up to one's potential; for the ability to r <!main gracious win or lose, and praying for God to use his influence to direct events in one's favor. Upon reflection, the latter type of prayer defeats the purpose of the competition: to show the excellence which man can achieve through hard work and determination. What good are our achievements if they are handed to us by God on a silver platter? If "Notre Dame will win over all" is fulfilled merely due to divine intervention, the pride we take in the achievements of our community is made a mockery. 
Sincerely, 
J. Timothy Walsh 
The Need for Mary 

Editor, Notre Dame -23 So. Cal. -14 
I for one do NOT necessarily believe that there may be even the slightest connection between the above score and the Stanford Hall rosary of which you wrote on Thursday the 25th: 
"Jim Hoolihan commented that 'Stanford is sponsoring the rosary to re-establish the old Notre Dame tradition of putting God on our side." 
However, for those among our Notre Dame Students, who through human respect, (which stems from accepting very questionable theology, or doctrines which violate what they learned at home) have not the intestinal stamina they need as good Catholics from a genuinely good Catholic family to continue their true and inspiring traditions of their homelife here at Notre Dame, Jim Hoolihan's words are Providentially a clarion call to ALL Catholic students (not only the football squad) to get back to center. 
Where were all of you this month when 20 to 50 of us daily at 7 p.m. gathered at the Grotto to pray the rosary. Two nights we had the leader'of the great Family Rosary Crusade himself-Father Pat Peyton, a Holy Cross priest. 
This, boys, is only a reminder of something that Notre Dame has to give that does not ask more money of you but grants benefits far beyond anything money can buy. Perhaps you might start an evening rosary in your hall chapels, and when May-the Month of Our Lady comes around, we'll all gather around the replica of Lourdes -l,OOO'sof us -to praise in prayer and song the true Notre Dame (French for Our Lady) whose statue tops the golden dome and in whose name this the greatest Catholic University in the USA was brought to life, and will continue as Catholic and the greatest ONLY if you do your part.. .be faithful to your background 100 percent. 
Wishfully and prayerfully yours, Rev. W.A. Monaghan, C.S.C.

Dear Editor: 
In reply to a sick letter written by a member of the not-so-silent minority female sex on campus in Tuesday's, October 16th issue of the Observer , I must say -Grow Up, Laureen Goers! Your high school publication immaturity is out of line here. Mike Welby wrote a very good article about the ratio of men (some of us) and girls at Notre Dame, (Observer, Thur­sday, October lith . ) I saw no implication that he was, "dumped by a Notre Dame student". If he was, and assuming it was a girl, I'm sure he realizes that no better fortune could have fallen upon him. After all, general consensus has it that dating SMC or ND girls can be hazardous to one's health. 
The implication of a loser being a guy who succeeds in obtaining a date with an ND or SMC girl is a journalistic masterpiece because of its truth in may cases. The statement about "wallflowers" is basic fact! How many of us have ever gone to a party where wallflowers were not present? Very few, Miss Goers refers to Welby's passage about wallflowers as "worthless trash." I must

Hesburgh guests at Bulla Shed 
Fr. Theodore Hesburgh will be the first guest at the new Bulla Shed bi-monthly luncheon beginning this Wednesday, Oc­tober 31, at 12:00 noon. All members of the ND-SMC com­munity are invited to join the guest of the day for an informal luncheon and talk session. 
"There are many good people on this campus who most of us only hear about, or see from afar," said Fr. Tom Stella, director of Bulla Shed. "I think it is a real service to the community to offer an op­portunity for closer contact, and an exchange of ideas," he added. 
Farley Hall sophomore Chris Gallagher and freshman Kevin McCormick are the student organizers of the luncheon program. Submarine sandwiches, soup, and potato chips are on the menu for these twice monthly Wednesday gatherings.

~K~e~e~n~a-n-.-----=--o---=---illon, Howard on top 

by Sam Yan,DUcc; 
By 4 o'clock Saturday afternoon Notre Dame's varsity football team had taken a gigantic step in the direction of a post-season bowl game and a possible national championship. By that same time Sunday afternoon three IH teams­Dillon, Howard, and Keenan--had captured league titles and are now looking forward to the interhall playoffs. 
Powerful Dillon (who are those gu¥s? )won convincingly 34-Q, while Howard, which dethroned Morrissey as League number 1 champs, defeated St. Joe, 8-o. 
Keenan notched the final playoff berth in the easiest of all possible ways, by forfeit as Off-Campus was unable to field the required 11 men. 
Howard and Keenan square off this Sunday in the opening playoff game. 
Wed., October 24 SORIN 14 PANGBORN 0 
Although not quite has happy as the three league champions, Sorin did manage a small celebration after capturing its only win of the season. 
Tim DeMarais provided the only points necessary when he returned a Pangborn punt 65 yards for a touchdown D~Marais also figured in the insurance TD as he caught a 30 yd. bomb from QB John Lar­sburgh. 
Sorin captain John Powers wished to express the teams gratitude to Coach Doctor James Carbarry for all the time and effort he spend on the team. He also added "It's a great way to end the season." 
STANFORD 8 GRACE 0 
Everyone knows that statistics are fo( losers. This adage -was illustrated once again Wednesday night. Grace, although playing a fine overall defensive game, lapsed once, but that once was enough to cost them the game. 
Stanford struck when a backup quarterback George Parker hit 
Mike Pulman with a 40 yd. TD bomb. The 8 points was cushion enough as Stanford's staunch 
defense stymied Grace twice in­side the 10 yard line. The win kept

ALUMNI 21 HOLY CROSS 7 

In the nightcap Holy Cross 
shocked Alumni with a quick first 
period touchdown, a 55 yard strike 
from Jeff Butryn to Mike 
Hildebrand. 

Alumni remained cool, however, 
and scored three times in the 
second half. It was a particularly 
frustrating game for Holy Cross as 
2 long touchdown plays were nullified by penalties. 
Sunday, October 28 
MORRISSEY 25 LYONS 0 

Morrissey ended its season in a 
predictable way--by clobbering 
winless Lyons. The Marauders, 
borrowing a play used by Alabama 
last week, scored on the first play 
of the game when quarterback Tim 
Puntarelli connected with Bob 
Zierk on a 65 yard touchdown pass. 
Puntarelli struck against from 

long range (45 yards) in the third 
period and then from in close (H 
yards) in the fourth quarter; Fran 
Finnegan was the target on both 
occasions. Fullback Jim Dwyer added a final TD when he dove' over from 2 yards out. Wayne w.. aver capped the Marauder scoring by drop kicking the extra point. 
DILLON 34 HOLY CROSS 0 

Undefeated Dillon, showing off its rugged ground attack, prepared for the interhall playoffs by walloping Holy Cross. Mike O'Neil provided more than enough offensive punch scoring three times and accumulating over 200 total yards in offense. 
Also seeing paydirt for the "Big Red" were Craig Tighe and Joe Reppernhoff. Holy Cross gridders had nothing to cheer about Sunday afternoon and little to show for the IH season finishing 0-3-1. 
Boaters go 1-1-1,

The Irish soccer squad has been 
busy the last two weeks with two 
road games and a game under the 
Cartier Field lights. 

Bradley beat Notre Dame in Peoria, Illinois 5-4 on October 13. The Irish had a bad first half but got one score each from Louis Monserrat and Pat Flood, and a pair of goals from Jafar Moghadam in the second frame. Mike Fitzgerald and Rich Hichwa were the other Irish standouts in the loss. 
On Friday night at home, ND ripped apart Eastern Michigan 4-Q. Steve Malpica tallied once, Bob Donovan canned one, and Moghadam collected 2 more points. Jafar leads the team in scoring this year with 8 goals. 
Yesterday Grace College tied the Irish 2-2 at Grace. Shawn Carroll and Pat Flood supplied the scoring punch for the Irish. "We played a good second half after they played a strong first half," said team 
ball in the net." 

Friday night at 7:00 p.m. ND hosts Northwestern on CartierYds. 
Field. The Irish will be trying to
52 

improve their 2-4-2 record against
36 

NU. The Irish are expecting a close 85 ball game. Notre Dame has only 2 23, remaining games after Friday's 35' contest. 
The Interhall season came to a close Sunday; playoffs will get underway next weekend. 
STANFORD 14 FLANNER 7 

Upset minded Flanner, which held a 7-0 halftime lead, finally succumbed to Stanford's 14 point secol1d half surge. 
Planner had grabbed the lead on a 10 yard scoring pitch from Steve Sonetello to AI Bucci. Stanford retaliated with Bill Blum's 12 yard bootleg. Blum then bombed 25 yards to Mike Pulamn for the decisive score. DHB Pete Diamond doused Planner's upset hopes with 2 second half in­terceptions. 
HOWARD 8 ST. JOE 0 

Howard, coming on stronger than Tarzan after the ivory thieves, picked up its fourth win of the year as well as the League number 1 championship. 
Although the offense sputtered after Rick Arrensburgh's first period touchdown, the defense registered its third consecutive whitewash. 
The loss dropped St. Joe's season record to 2-3. 
ZAHM 20 CAVANAUGH 0 

Cavanaugh's offensive antics 
were wilder than a monkey on 50 
feet of new grapevine but they 
weren't enough to stop Zahm from 
gaining its third victory. 

Zahm tailback Jack Leich 
scored twice, once on a 53 yard 
sweep and the other on a 10 yard 
run. Mike Mountford also got into . 
the act by picking off a Cavanaugh, 
fumble in mid-air and bee-lining it 
35 yards into the end zone.
