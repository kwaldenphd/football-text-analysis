Hesburgh recalls, contrasts activislll during Vietnam. era, today 
Alumni, University President Emeritus emphasize different natures of demonstrations from 1970s to present 
By EILEEN DUFFY 
Assistant News Editor 
Editor's Note: This is the sec­ond article in a three-part series examining activism at Notre Dame: its current role on cam­pus, how that role has changed and what those changes mean for the future. 
A<> is the case with universities nationwide, activism at Notre Dame has redefined itself as an effort to steer the boat in a cer­tain direction, rather than rock­ing it. 
Many college students of the late 1960s and early 1970s turned to sit-ins. lie-ins and stone-throwings to get their point across, inducting those at Notre Dame -until then­University President Father Theodore Hesburgh told them, "Enough." 
He established guidelines for protestors, allowing their voices to be heard while prohibiting any infringement upon other stu­dents' rights. Violent protests stopped and other universities attempted similar efforts. 
While the heated, excited activism of the 1970s has sub­sided nationwide, there still remains a stereotype that Notre Dame lacks passionate protest­ing. 
Is the climate today an exten­sion of Hesburgh's influence, where the University's readiness to discuss problems makes activism unnecessary -and therefore somewhat invisible ­at Notre Dame? Does today's lack of loud protest stem from apathy? Or is activism simply not what it used to be? 
"Tough Times" 
When the possibility of a war in Vietnam came to light, college students from Berkeley to Columbia staged violent protests, taking their anger against the 
U.S. government out on ROTC buildings, CIA recruiters and their university presidents ­who, they claimed, were hiding behind closed doors and not li<>­tening to them. 
At Columbia, students took over President Grayson Kirk's office, where they rummaged through his files, drank, smoked

BCAC shovv to highlight fashion, hip-hop culture 
By GENE NOONE 
News Writer 

The students in the Black Cultural Arts Council (BCAC) have spent a week polishing the runway and perfecting their struts for Saturday's annual spring fashion show at the Century Center in South Bend. 
Titled "I Love Hip Hop," this year's production marks the BCAC's 30th anniversary -but while the history of the club will be a focal point, the history of hip-hop will take center stage. 
"The show takes a look at the evolution of hip-hop and its impact on fashion not only as a style of music but also as a culture," said junior Brittny Flint, one of the show's coordinators. 
Flint said students will model clothing from DEB, Cache, the Gap, Charlotte Russe, New York Style and 101 Collections to the beats of hip-hop hits. 
"It is a huge production that everyone has put a lot of hard work into," she said. 
Twenty-nine Notre Dame and Saint Mary's students will model the designs, Flint said, while near­ly 40 students will be involved in the production's overall organiza­tion. 
The team of coordinators collab­orated to bring different fashions to the show -but they also brought a new perspective to the BCAC's production.

A series of unfortunate events 
I went to sleep late and when I woke up this morning I got tangled up in my bed sheets and the loft's

on my right ankle 
News Editor 
and I made a noise loud enough to wake up my roommate and I could tell it was going to be a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad day. 
My roommate Alexa called NDSP and soon three firemen came to our room but I couldn't get up from the floor to change my clothes or brush my teeth because my ankle hurt too much so they saw me in my ugliest pajamas and carried me down the lobby and to Health Services with bad breath. I think I'll move to Australia. 
The nurse looked at my X-rays and said I had a nasty sprain and a hairline frac­ture and she gave me crutches and then I asked as a joke ifit was a bad idea to go dancing at Fever and drink until sprain­ing my left ankle. She didn't even answer. I could tell it was going to be a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad day. 
By the time I returned to McGlinn it was noon and I hadn't showered and smelled like Ben Gay so I hopped in to take a bath and forgot I had scheduled a phone inter­view about my summer internship at that time. Next week I'm moving to Australia. 
On my long walk from McGlinn to DeBartolo it was raining, I remembered my freshman year living in Walsh and its central location and I wondered if air con­ditioning was worth the switch to McGlinn because the distance factor was adding to my excruciating pain. It was a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad day. 
I finally arrived at DeBartolo only to realize the class I had rushed to catch had been let out early and I went to the bath­room to see why my arms and upper body hurt so much. 
I lifted my shirt and the area under my arm was red and my friend Goose told me I shouldn't place the weight of my body on the arm support bar but rather on the hand bar. I think tomorrow I'll be bruised as ifsomeone had dropkicked me. 
I thought I would check Televisionwithoutpity.com to read about Monday's episode of "24," which I missed and didn't tape, but at least I could always read the summary online. For the first time since I can recall, however, Televisionwithoutpity.com was down and I couldn't get my daily fix of Hollywood with a twist of sarcasm. I was having a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad day. 
Dinner was out of the question because I had to work at The Observer all night so I got Grah-n-Go. I don't need to tell you why this only contributed to my bad day. 
My friend liz told me "Model Behavior," a Disney Channel original movie starring Justin Timberlake in his *NSYNC days was on, but I knew no one at The Observer would want to watch it so I repressed my guilty pleasure and realized there's no freedom of expression at Notre Dame ifI can't tell everyone I still pray for an *NSYNC reunion without fearing rolling eyes. 
Maybe I could move to Australia and away from the anti boy-band Scrooges. 
My mother, however, called while I was at work and said I just said that because I had a bad day and that some days are like that -even in Australia.

Man: Ex's sex change should end alimony 
CLEARWATER, Fla. ­Lawrence Roach agreed to pay alimony to the woman he divorced, not the man she became after a sex change, his lawyers argued Tuesday in an effort to end the pay­ments. But the ex-wife's attorneys said the operation doesn't alter the agreement. 
The lawyers and Circuit Judge Jack R. St. Arnold agreed the case delves into relatively unchartered legal territory. They found only a 2004 Ohio case that addressed whether or not a transsexual could still collect alimony after a sex change. 
"There is not a lot out 
there to help us," St. Arnold said. 
Roach and his wife, Julia, divorced in 2004 after 18 years of marriage. The 48­year-old utility worker agreed to pay her $1,250 a month in alimony. Since then, Julia Roach, 55, had a sex change and legally changed her name to Julio Roberto Silverwolf. 
Man's ear bitten off In soccer brawl 
ATHENS, Greece -Four men have been arrested on the island of Crete after part of a man's ear was bitten off during a brawl after Greece's 4-1 loss to Turkey in a European Championship qualifier. 
The incident occurred Saturday near the town of lerapetra during a fight between Bulgarian workers and local Greek men who had been watching the match on television, police said Tuesday. 
Local businessman Dimitris Tsimbibakis was hospitalized after a man bit his ear. He told authorities he had inter­vened to try and break up the fight but was beaten by four Bulgarian men. 
The fight apparently start­ed after the Bulgarian men cheered Turkey's goals.

Nun key to late pope's beatification 
PARIS -Sister Marie-Simon-Pierre is the French nun whose testimony of a mystery cure from Parkinson's disease will likely be accepted as the miracle the Vatican needs to beatify Pope John Paul II, an official at the Paris maternity hospital where she works said Wednesday. 
The identity of the nun has been one of the Catholic Church's most closely guarded secrets. The nun says that she was cured of Parkinson's after she and her community of nuns prayed to John Paul. 
In Rome, Monsignor Slawomir Oder, the Polish cleric spearheading the John Paul's beatification cause, said the bishop in the woman's diocese would announce details about her case during his Palm Sunday Mass this weekend. 
U.S., Russia discuss missile defense 
WASHINGTON -Russian President Vladimir Putin registered his concerns Wednesday with President Bush about a planned U.S. missile defense system in Central Europe in a conversation that highlighted strains between the two nations. 
After the phone call, a White House spokesman said Bush emphasized to the Russian president that missile defenses in Europe were intended to protect against an evolving threat from the Middle East. 
It is "a threat that we share in common with Europe and Russia," said Gordon Johndroe, the National Security Council spokesman. 
According to the Kremlin, Bush expressed a willingness to discuss the project with Russia in detail in the interest of mutual security. 
A longtime analyst of U.S.-Russia relations said the relationship between the two coun­tries "is in serious trouble."

Gonzales: Prosecutors not loyal 
WASHINGTON -Eight federal prosecu­tors were fired last year because they did not sufficiently support President Bush's priorities, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales' former chief of staff says in remarks prepared for delivery to Congress on Thursday.

Leader calls for opening of Nazi files 
WASHINGTON -A Jewish leader who survived the Holocaust as a boy by hiding in basements and attics urged countries to speed the opening of vast files on Nazi con­centration camps and their victims. 
Leo Rechter, president of the U.S.-based National Association of Jewish Child Holocaust Survivors, told Congress on Wednesday that Nazi war records stored in Bad Arolsen, Germany, should be opened urgently for a dying generation of survivors. 
Witnesses testifying Wednesday expressed frustration the commission has waited so long to release the files.

Shukri Mohamed Ibrahim, 9, was pro­nounced dead at the scene Tuesday. Her brother, Hassan Mohamed Ibrahim, 14, was in critical condition Wednesday at Methodist Hospital. 
The boy was riding a bicycle and his sister was on foot behind him along a city street, police said. 
Indianapolis Metropolitan Police said Margaret Graves, 42, apparently fell asleep before her car crossed two lanes of traffic, striking the children.

British captives shown on Arab TV 
Blair won't negotiate with Iran except to discuss the return ofsailors, marines 
Associated Press 
TEHRAN -Iran aired a video Wednesday of 15 cap­tured British sailors and marines, showing the only woman captive saying her group had "trespassed" in Iranian waters. Britain angrily denounced the video as a "completely unaccept­able" display of prisoners. 
The Iranian foreign minis­ter said officials would look into releasing the female sailor soon, but backed off reports she would be freed Wednesday or Thursday. 
British Prime Minister Tony Blair's government announced it was freezing all dealings with Iran except to negotiate the release of its personnel, adding to a public exchange of sharp com­ments that pushed up ten­sions in a standoff helping fuel a spike in world oil prices. 

Britain's military released a GPS readout it said proved the Royal Navy personnel were seized 1.7 nautical miles inside Iraqi waters Friday.

Darfur 
continued from page 1 
Messinger, a former Democratic nominee for mayor of New York City, encouraged action from all individuals in what she called, "the moral legacy we will leave to our children and grandchildren." 
She said the Janjaweed militia, a group funded and armed by the Sudanese government, has waged genocide against the inhabitants of the Darfur region in the eastern part of Sudan since February 2003 -although there are very few distinct ethnic or religious dif­ferences between the two sides of the conflict, Messinger said. Both the Darfurian residents and the .Janjaweed militants, she said, are Muslim. 
"You can go online and read the complete history of the genocide, but you simply can't get it to make sense," Messinger said. 
The region's Muslim identity, however, cannot be automatically treated as an explanation for the genocide, she said, cautioning stu­dents against faulting a religious identity for an act of human evil. 
"Don't make the mistake of assigning [the blame] to any one group of people," she said. "Whatever it is that caused this is the same as it was in Germany and Cambodia." 
Messinger framed her speech as a "plea to a powerful universi­ty" to help stop the genocide in Darfur and prevent further mas­sacres in the world. She urged Notre Dame and Indiana to divest from companies that buy or sell Sudanese oil, as 38 other colleges and universities across the nation have done already. She also said individuals should push private investing firms, such as Fidelity and Berkshire Hathaway, to fol­low that lead. 

Messinger said each of the 2.5 millitm Darfur refugees has his or her own story -but all of these stories "are chillingly the same." 
When the Janjaweed attack a village, they start by bombing the town using Sudanese government planes painted white to look like humanitarian aid planes, she said. The Janjaweed militia then enters the village on horseback and trucks, brandishing knives, slaughtering the men, raping the women, killing·the children and killing the livestock, whose car­casses they use to contaminate the well water, Messinger said. 
"Rape is being used as a weapon of war in Darfur," she said. "It is incomprehensible, but it is happening." 
Messinger described the refugee camps in Darfur and Chad as "appearing to stretch for­ever across the desert." 
In these camps, the women attempt to support themselves by gathering firewood, but they often must venture more than two kilo­meters outside the camps -at risk of attacked by the Janjaweed -to find any tree branches. 
One woman, nonetheless, told Messinger she wouldn't consider sending her husband or her son because she feared they would get killed ifthey were captured. 
"I only get raped," she said. 
In light of the tragedies that are repeated every day in Darfur, the question of what needs to be done to stop the cycle naturally pres­ents itself, she said. 
While Messinger said she acknowledges no single individual can save the world, every bit of effort counts. She cited an old Hebrew teaching that says "It's not our responsibility to complete 
the world, but we're not allowed 
to refuse to participate." 
Individuals can participate by 
contacting local officials, especial­
ly at the state level, she said. After 
the Indiana House of 
Representatives unanimously 
passed Bill 1484 that mandated 
divestment from companies that 
give money to Sudan, the bill died 
Wednesday. The chairman of the 
committee that reviews House 
bills before they are presented to 
the state senate rejected tho reso­
lution -a disappointing event for 
Messinger. 
Messinger urged individuals to 
become informed in these issues, call the White Ilouse comment line, write to local newspapers, raise awarnness in the communi­ty and tell family and friends about the cri<>is. She told students to consider participating in the ongoing Africa Awanmess Week on campus, as there will be a ·march Thursday outside Main 
Building to protest the gnnoeide. 
Messinger said people always 
question what they would have 
done had they been presented 
with the opportunity to save Jews 
during the Holocaust. But she said 
she does not bnlieve this question 
is relevant, saying individuals 
should "question not what would 
you have done, but what are you 
doing." 

She termed her organization's 
work in Darfur a "Holocaust 
memorial program," inviting stu­
dents to help stop the bloodshed 
before the tragedy reaches levels 
of atrocity akin to the Holocaust. 
"There's a lot of work to be 
done, and I hope that more of you 
will join us," she said.

IN BRIEF 
U.S., Iranian tensions affect oil prices 
NEW YORK -Oil prices rose to a six­month high above $64 a barrel Wednesday amid rising tensions between Iran and the West and as inventories declined in the U.S. 
Though denied by the U.S. military, it was rumored that Iran fired a missile at an American ship in the Persian Gulf. 
Iran, one of the largest oil producers, is located along the Strait of Hormuz, through which much of the world's oil is transport­ed. Traders worry that oil supplies could be disrupted if unrest escalates there. 
Falling U.S. inventories of crude oil, gaso­line and distillates added to supply con­cerns, keeping prices high. 
Humors about a military confrontation spurred panic buying in after-hours trading Tuesday, sending oil prices above $68 in a matter of minutes. Hising tensions between Iran and the West have created a potential­ly dangerous situation in the Gulf and mar­kets are jumpy. 


Bemanke scolds investors as stocks fall 
NEW YORK-Stocks fell Wednesday after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke chided investors who may have looked past long-standing concerns about inflation. The Dow Jones industrials fell nearly 100 points, the third straight session of declines. 
A rise in oil prices to a six-month high and a weaker-than-expected rise in orders for large manufactured goods compounded investors' concerns Wednesday. 
In Capitol Hill testimony, Bernanke said while core inflation slowed modestly in the second half of 2006, recent readings remain "uncomfortably high." He also said troubles among some mortgage lenders that cater to those with poor credit don't appear to have spread to the broader economy, though he added the situation requires further obser­vation. 
Stocks rallied last week after investors interpreted language from the Fed as open­ing the way to the possibility of a reduction in interest rates. But concerns about stub­born inflation could reverse investors' hopes for a reduction in rates, even as the economy continues to cool.

Democrats predict surplus 
House plans to create windfall in five years iftax cuts allowed to expire 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -House Democrats pressed ahead Wednesday with a budget plan predicting a sizable surplus in five years, but only if President Bush's tax cuts expire in 2010 as scheduled. 
The majority Democrats' $2.9 trillion budget outline for next year would produce a $153 billion surplus in 2012 while raising spending for vet­erans, education, defense and national security. 
Democrats say the plan would finally mean a surplus after years of red ink under Bush and a GOP-controlled Congress. 
Republicans sa:d allowing tax cuts passed in 2001 and 2003 to expire in 2010 would amount to the "largest tax increase in American history." 
The future of the Bush tax cuts will likely be decided after the 2008 presidential election. While in the majority, congres­sional Republicans never held votes to make all of them per­manent, despite Bush's annual calls to do so. 
Under Congress' budget process, the annual budget resolution is a nonbinding out­line that guides future legisla­tion. It allows the two parties to show voters their competing fiscal visions, often without having to take the politically difficult votes to implement them. 
The Democratic budget blue­print calls for a nearly $25 bil­lion increase next year for domestic programs popular with lawmakers in both par­ties, approving Bush's record budget increase for the Pentagon's non-war budget and $145 billion for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan next year. 
Those spending boosts would cause the deficit to rise from $209 billion this year to $241 billion in 2009 before increased revenues from the expiration of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts rapidly generate a surplus. 
Republicans credit those tax cuts -on income, invest­ments, estates, married cou­ples and families with children, among other things -with reviving the economy from a recession early in Bush's first term. 
Extending those tax cuts would cost about $250 billion in 2012 alone. Democrats acknowledge many of the pro­visions -especially those aimed at middle-income tax­payers -will be renewed. 
"That decision will be taken when we reach it. When we have to cross that bridge, we'll cross that bridge," said House Budget Committee Chairman John Spratt Jr., D-S.C. "We hope we'll have a surplus by that point in time." 
For now, the budget plan would require lawmakers 
seeking to cut taxes or boost benefit programs -such as Medicare, children's health care or farm subsidies -to "pay for" the changes with tax increases or offsetting spend­ing cuts. 
That rule would greatly com­plicate efforts later this year to boost funding for a popular health insurance program for poor children. 
Democrats opted to put off politically painful decisions on shoring up the finances of Medicare and Social Security. 
Republicans countered with an alternative plan cutting $279 billion from federal bene­fit programs such as Medicare and Medicaid over the next five years -far greater cuts than proposed by Bush in February. 
The plan, authored by Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, top Republican on the budget panel, would fully extend the 2001 and 2003 rounds of tax cuts, at a cost of about $450 billion. But Ryan's plan is cer­tain to lose by a big margin Thursday. 
The Democratic measure is largely a response to com­plaints that Bush has short­changed programs funded each year by appropriations bills -including education, health research and grants to local governments -while offering big increases to the Pentagon and providing tax cuts tilted toward affluent, GOP-leaning constituencies. 

Marine Corps prohibits ne"W 'extra-large tattoos' 
Associated Press 
OCEANSIDE, Calif. -Five tat­tooed skulls stretch from Marine Cpl. Jeremy Slaton's right elbow to his wrist, spelling out the word "Death." He planned to add a tattoo spelling "Life" on his left arm, but that's on hold because of a Marine policy tak­ing effect Sunday. 
The Marines arc banning any new, extra-large tattoos below the elbow or the knee, saying such body art is harmful to the Corps' spit-and-polish image. 
Slaton and other grunts are not pleased. 
"I guess I'll get the other half later," grumbled the 24-year-old leatherneck from Eden Prairie, Minn. "It's kind of messed up." 
For many Marines, getting a tattoo is a rite of passage. They commonly get their forearms inscribed to remember fallen comrades, combat tours or loved ones, and often ask for. exotic designs that incorporate the Marine motto, Semper Fi, or "Always faithful." 
Dozens of Marines from Camp Pendleton, the West Coast's biggest Marine base, made last­minute trips to tattoo parlors in nearby Oceanside before the ban kicked in. 
"This is something I love to do," said Cpl. David Nadrchal, 20, of Pomona, who made an appointment to get an Iraqi flag and his deployment dates etched onto his lower leg. "The fact I can't put something on my body that I want -it's a big thing to tell me I can't do that." 
Nadrchal said he is unsure whether he will re-enlist: "There's all these little things. They are slowly chipping away at us." 
Marine Corps Commandant Gen. James T. Conway announced the policy change last week. 
"Some Marines have taken the liberty of tattooing themselves to a point that is contrary to our professional demeanor and the high standards America has come to expect from us," he said. "I believe tattoos of an excessive nature do not repre­sent our traditional values." 
The ban is aimed primarily at "sleeve" tattoos, the large and often elaborate designs on the biceps and forearms of many Marines. Similar designs on the lower legs will be forbidden as well. So will very large tattoos on the upper arm, if they are visible when a Marine wears his work­out T-shirt. Small, individual tat­toos will still be allowed on the arms and legs. The Marines already ban them on the hands. 
Marines already tattooed are exempt from the ban but cannot add to their designs anyone caught with fresh ink in the wrong places could be barred from re-enlistment or face disci­plinary action. Getting a prohib­ited tattoo coulq constitute a vio­lation of a lawful order, punish­able by up to two years in prison and a dishonorable discharge, Marine spokesman 1st Lt. Brian Donnelly said.

Without men like Crenshaw, the unit would not have been as successful, Gov. Mike Beebe said Tuesday as he presented Crenshaw a plaque for his dedi­cation, service and commit­ment. 
"I don't think there's any question that nobody had a greater track record as a unit in World War II than the Tuskegee Airmen," Beebe said. "Over 100 kills and . . . not a single loss in combat as a result of enemy fire. That didn't just happen, somebody trained those guys to be that good." 
Two historians have said research shows the Airmen did lose some planes to enemy fire during World War II, and one former bomber co-pilot said last year that his plane was shot down while being escorted by the unit. Few would question, though, that the Tuskegee Airmen made a powerful contri­bution. 
Crenshaw, 89, was named Primary Flight Instructor in 1942 at Tuskegee Army Air Field in Tuskegee, Ala. 
"I sent all the other guys over there," Crenshaw said. "My job was to shove them out and make sure they had a good understanding ... of how to go out, fight and come back to home base." 
On Thursday, he and about 200 other survivors of the Tuskegee Airmen will receive the Congressional Gold Medal in the Rotunda of the Capitol, a venue their race once would have prevented them from entering. The medal is the high­est civilian award bestowed by Congress, and also may be awarded to military personnel.

COLUMBUS, Ohio -Ohio University revoked the master's degree of a mechanical engi­neering student accused of using others' work in a thesis, the most severe action yet in a review of dozens of research papers, the school said Wednesday. 
The university would not identify the student or give details about the questioned portions of the thesis, citing academic privacy laws. 
The student appealed after being notified of the university's

plan in February, but Provost Kathy Krendl denied the appeal. 
The university said it was fin­ishing up a sweeping review of dissertations and theses it start­ed last year after a graduate student reported to administra­tors that he found plagiarized passages while doing research using archived theses in a uni­versity library. 
The school, which barred two professors who oversaw many of the theses from advising graduate students, checked 180 mechanical engineering papers for cheating. Some of the papers were selected randomly from 1, 500 submitted since 1980 to the school's Russ College of Engineering and Technology. The university, in Athens in southeast Ohio, used computer programs to compare them with papers that had simi­lar titles or departments, check­ing for duplications in the texts. 

Colleen Girton, a spokes­woman for the engineering col­lege, said the school undertook rigorous steps to root out pla­giarism, and a Rutgers University professor specializ­ing in academic dishonesty agreed. 
"I don't know of any other school that has gone to such great lengths to identify cheat­ing," said Donald McCabe, who helped Ohio University officials design their review process. 
Twelve graduates were required to rewrite all or parts of their theses that contained minor infractions, such as improper citations of others' work, university spokeswoman Sally Linder said. A decision to strip someone's degree means the student went beyond improper citation by being intentionally deceptive and knowingly using plagiarized

Paul Coffey was one of the greatest defensemen ever to play in the National Hockey League. During his career, he scored 396 goals and played in 14 NHL All-Star Games. 
So sometimes when I want to impress people, I say that this sovereign on skates is my uncle. We do share a last name, after all. 
I tell them that Uncle Paul was born in Ontario, Canada, and that he's 45 years old. I even mention that Uncle Paul ranks second all-time among NIIL defensemen in career goals, assists and points. 
The statistics are true. But is it true that he's my dad's brother? Absolutely not. 
I could admit to being a liar. but in the spirit of a certain upcoming holiday, 
a.k.a. April Fool's Day, let's just say that I attempt to fool people-tho problem being that few people are, in fact, fooled by my fib. 
Why? Because my potential fool-ees always want to know more. The typical fib-breaking question-"What's your Uncle Paul like at Thanksgiving dinner?" 
But of course, Paul has never spent the fourth Thursday of November feast-

ing on my Grandma Tootsie's prized bird. 
I could've answered my potential fool­ees by citing Paul's Canadian heritage and then insisting that he doesn't observe Amerkan Thanksgiving. But that would've been just as disappointing as the answer I usually give -I attrib­ute Paul's Thanksgiving absence to a family feud. 
This obviously prompts more question­ing, as the potential fool-ces try to glean insight into Paul's character. The ques­tions -"Why would your father light with a three-time winner of the James Norris Memorial Trophy?" "Doesn't your turkey-basting grandmother miss him?" "And if' Paul were at Thanksgiving, would he watch the Detroit Lions game on TV?" 
But of' course, I can shed no light on his NFL loyaltic~s. While I may have memorized some of the celebrated num­ber seven's statistics, I don't know wh0ther he'd l'old or crumple his napkin. I don't know whether he'd want the dark meat of the turkey or the white meat. I don't nven know whether he'd usc his fork or his lingers to eat that turkey. 
But I do know this-life is in thn details. 
Anyone who can spell "Wikipedia" can see that Paul Col'l'ey was inducted into the NIIL Hall of Fame in 2004. But what about the first thing he said after he heard he'd be commemorated forever in Toronto? Who was the first person he told? And how did he choose the outfit he wore to the ceremony? That's what makes Paul interesting; that's what his life's about. 
I don't know those details. So clearly, I don't know Paul either. 
Likewise, your 3.96 GPA and Flex 14 Meal Plan can only say so much about you. And what people want to know about you is not that you've been on the Dean's List every semester. Anyone who ean hack into IrishLink can see that. But instead -why do you always study in that particular study carrel? Why can't you survive without reading the New York Times before breakfast every morning? What's the one thing that you're most thankful for? That's what makes you interesting; that's what your life's about. 
In the end, it wouldn't make me much more interesting if Paul Cofl'ey did, in I'aet, mail me a check for my birthday each year. Perhaps what makes me interesting is that I feel so compelled to lie about it. 
Life is in the details.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Protests aimed at solidarity 
I want to offer a reflection on the purpose ofthe protests held by members ofthe Catholic Peace Fellowship and Catholic Workers questioning the presence of ROTC at Notre Dame. In "Solicitudo Rei Socialis," Pope John Paul II told Catholics that the only way to dismantle structures of sin is to approach them in a diametrically opposed attitude, i.e. solidarity {SRS, no. 38). In this spirit of Christian solidarity, the protest held in front ofthe Main Building called the administration to examine its contribution in training sol­diers to fight in a war that two popes and the vast majority of bishops worldwide have called illegal, immoral and unjust. 
This is not to say that the soldiers that ROTC trains are immoral or unjust people. It is my firm conviction, however, that this has to do with the ethical formation that Notre Dame tries to provide and not with a ROTC program that systematically trains many of our noblest young men and women to dehumanize the other and surrender their con­sciences. In effect, ROTC soldiers are put in a position in which, as Christians, they must dismiss the prevailing norm of our military, that soldiers ought not be conscientious peo­ple. In this way, the protests were a call to solidarity not only with Iraqis, but with soldiers who struggle to live their faith in conscience. 
This protest must also not be viewed in isolation. One problem with protests in general and the anti-war move­ment in particular is that they are done in confrontation with those in power. However, to encourage conversion of hearts and the fostering of solidarity for peace, dialogue and common discernment are also necessary. The Notre Dame Peace Fellowship, ofwhich I am a member, has been and will continue to be dedicated to dialogue and friendship with the soldiers on our campus. In this way, it can be hoped that conscience can be restored to our consideration ofwar and peace, and that Americans reject a dehumanized vision of the enemy and build peace with love in our hearts. 
Bradley Jenkins off campus senior March 28 
Students not apathetic 
Believe it or not activism, can be practiced by both liberals and conservatives. The March 28 cover story ("Campus struggles with activism, apathy") only tells a partial story from a biased point of view. From the ridiculous claim that the Iraq war may "potentially" last as long as our 20-year involvement in Vietnam to the one-sided coverage of social activism, Eileen DuftY and Meghan Wons fail to tell a truthful and fair story. Conservatives proudly and strongly have taken action in defense of our positions. Scores of students traveled to our nation's capital to mark the anniversary of the infamous Roe v. Wade decision. Many more were active on Rep. Chocola's re-election campaign. Is that not activism? While it may be true that Notre Dame does not have the level of activism of UC-Berkeley, the levels are far healthier than the authors portray. 
Patrick George Siegfried Hall sophomore March 28 

Calls to examine the repercussions of our actions · 
We owe it to the University 

It is sadly ironic that Patrick McMaster's insights ("Nothing wrong with our 'Reputation,"' March 28) appeared on the same day as a piece examining student apathy. I hope McMaster's jocular tone shows he meant to exaggerate. However, ifhis letter is even partly based on gen­uine viewpoints-his own, or of anyone in our community-we have other serious problems on our campus. To be clear, this isn't a tirade against college drinking. 
We're all supposed to be adults here: we can make our own decisions. But ifour entire social lives revolve around the Bud lights in our hands, I think we're negatively impacting Notre Dame beyond Friday night. We're disrespecting our futures and those who work to offer us futures. McMaster discusses students' lack ofreal responsibility, and he's right. I'm not support­ing a family or running a country; I can afford to have fun. Time with friends is an essential part of our college experience. However, I hope we're not paying more than $40,000 a year just to get wasted every weekend and attend a few classes in between. 
Think of everyt11ing else we have to engage us. Academic inquiry and research beyond our normal classes. Creative and performing arts. Service and social action groups working on issues in our local and global communities. These, and much more, teach us to stretch our minds beyond textbook information and to develop an informed worldview-essential quali­ties for our leadership. Having a couple drinks on occasion probably doesn't prevent us from engaging in what our university has to offer. But we could question whether excessive drinking now keeps us from opportunities we can't buy at a bar. That would be disrespecting our future. Tied in with personal lack of respect is lack ofrespect for our educators. I'll use the term edu­cator broadly: from professors and administrators to all the service people who run our school. 
Don't we understand that everyone here is working for our benefit? I've talked to numerous custodians who enjoy their jobs here because they love to see students inspired. Again, we don't need to forsake all "normal" college social life to respect our educators. However, maybe we should think carefully about how we show gratefulness to people who give us so much. Don't we owe it to ourselves, and our community, to take advantage oftl1e whole Notre Dame experience? To not waste it away?

Creation doesn't entitle excess 
Fifty. Seven. Zero. Fifty is the nunilier of dollars I would pay Patrick McMaster to read Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics. Seven is the nunilier of times I swore while reading his Letter to the Editor. Zero is the nunilier oftrue statements he made in it. 
Is all we have to worry about as Notre Dame students when to eat? If so, then my pessimism about intellectual life on this campus has been confirmed. If any­one really thinks that he is attending this University, at the cost of 40 some-odd thousand dollars a year, simply to get wasted and "have fun,'1 then the so-called "townies" do have a right to be upset. Are we not students at the nation's foremost Catholic university to develop our minds and to learn how to lead a life ofvirtue? 
McMaster's letter shows that the for­mer has been forgotten and the latter has been mocked. If God did not want us to partake in the miraculous golden good­ness that is beer, why would he create it in the first place? What about food? If he didn't want us to eat it, then why would good-tasting food exist? The answer is that God most certainly wants us to par­take in the things of creation, alcohol and good food included. However, the ability to partake is not license to abuse. To jus­tify drunkenness to the point ofvomiting with a miracle of our Lord is analogous to justifying severe obesity with God's cre­ation offood to begin with. Just as a puri­tanical, or as McMaster calls it, a "prohi­bition-reminiscent," attitude errs on a deficiency in partaking in pleasure, so too 
does his attitude err on the side of excess. Both puritanism and drunkenness with regard to drinking are vices, and virtue is found in temperance -knowing what, where, when and {perhaps most impor­tantly) how much to drink. 
I now realize I erred in my earlier statement; one thing McMaster said is almost correct, and sadly so. His letter itself proves it: "trying to convince college students not to drink makes less sense than the Church of Scientology." But this effort is only absurd because of the outra­geously widespread lack ofrationality among students. I would not be surprised ifthe majority of students, who, accord­ing to McMaster, lack any rational capaci­ty when it comes to pleasure, are inca­pable of being convinced of any truth at all.

Purpose of 'Touchdown Moses' 
No.1 Moses 

I am sure you have received many letters in regards to the March 27 Letter to the Editor titled '"First Down Moses" underlies negative attitudes toward other religions.' "First down" Moses? Are you kidding? This was a man who parted the Red Sea, spoke with burning shrubbery and induced swarms oflocusts to descend upon the Egyptians. Does the scowling statue with finger upraised really appear be celebrating a first down? Are we return­ing to the dark days of the Bob Davie Era where a first down was cause for biblical figures to stand on the heads ofthe vanquished in celebration? While we're making ludicrous comparisons between fig­ures such as Moses and the Sept. 11 tragedy, why not knock the individual on the library down a few pegs. How about "Complete Catch" Jesus instead? Don't sell the proud tradition ofthe University short -it's "Nunilier One Moses." 
Matthew McCoyd Chicago, Ill. Class of2000 March 28 

Moses was an honorable man 
While reading the March 27 edition of The Observer, I saw the Letter to the Editor by Xavier Lebec regarding First Down Moses. What Lebec fails to realize in his argument is that a greater picture exists. 
First, let us for a moment discuss gods {not just the Jewish/Christian God) at the time the Old Testament was writ­ten. Gods were viewed at that time as wrathful deities, capa­ble oftwo emotions: neutrality and anger. People from every nation would smite others in the name oftheir god. The more violence displayed, the more powerful the god was viewed to be. In order to contend with the other gods, the Jewish/Christian God had to follow a sinillar model. It would be far too idealistic to assume that the Israelites would have followed a pacifistic, "weak-looking" God, when they were surrounded by hundreds of other powerful gods. However, one major difference exists between the Jewish/Christian God and the other gods: the element oflove. The Jewish/Christian God is the only God from that time period to exhibit love and compassion for his people. This is not to say that God did not punish his people; the verses Lebec cites from Exodus describe an instance in which God had to correct his people. The difference is in God's reaction after the punishment, which is one oflove. 
In addition, It would be incredibly foolish to assume that any god would condone the worship of other gods. I challenge Lebec to find any god that condones the worship of gods from other religions. I very seriously doubt that Buddha would con­done the worship ofJesus, or that Allah would allow his peo­ple to worship Buddha. We shouldn't hold the Jewish/Christian God to any other standard. 
Lastly, to hold the University responsible for building "a stat­ue commemorating atrocities sinillar to those of Sept. 11" is not only irrelevant, but completely inappropriate. This is a Christian institution, and it simply built a statue to a man vital to the history ofthe Christian faith. Moses was simply follow­ing God"s command, as he was told to do. To blame Moses and label him a "terrorist" is offensive to the Christian faith. Moses is ofincredible importance to the development ofthe Jewish and ultimately Christian faith, and he should be rewarded and honored as such.

'Shooter' hits mark for some, fires blanks for others

Arguably the best action films are a solid combination of tension. explosions and comedy. If it has a serviceable plot, that's even better -but it's not entirely necessary. "Shooter," directed by Antoine Fuqua ("Training Day"), definitely meets these criteria. 
The f11m opens with a prologue that introduces Bob Lee Swagger (Mark Wahlberg). a Marine sniper, and his 

partner who are Ethiopia. The mis­sion goes wrong, his partner is killed and Swagger is left without sup­port and forced to find his own way out.

secretly looks into the case when he real­izes that there arc facts that don't match up. He evades the government of'lieials, which sets up the cat-and-mouse chase that dominates the movie. 
On the whole, "Shooter" works wnll as a shoot-em-up action flick that is steeped in political intrigue, in the vein of the "Bourne" movies. Like the "Bourne" franchise, "Shooter" is also taknn from a book -it's based on Stephen Hunter's novel "Point of Impact." Depending on the success of the movie, ·thern are two more Swagger books that could be made into movies, giving Wahlberg his first 
franchise. 
weakest part of the 
film is the political intrigue that remains in the film, as it is extremely undeveloped and only used when it is needed to continue the action. The last quarter of the movie takes a downward spiral in terms of plot, becoming highly unrealistic and at times confusing until the very end of the film. 
Aside from the frequent explosions, the film's real enjoyment comes from its per­formances. Mark Wahlberg does an out­standing job as the renegade action hero and has further solidified himself as one of the big players in Hollywood today. Also turning in a great performance is Michael Pena as the FBI agent still wet behind the ears. The scene-stealer of the film however goes to the brief appear-
By BRIAN DOXTADER Senior Staff Writer 
Howard Hawks once quipped that a great film is "three good scenes" and "no bad scenes." Antoine Fuqua's "Shooter" manages to fulfill the former, but it's the second part of Hawks' definition that sinks the film. As per its title, "Shooter" doesn't have a lot on its mind, past blood-letting destruction, but its pretense toward social awareness renders the picture inelleetive, even as a mochanical blockbuster. 
"Shooter" follows Bob Lee Swagger (Mark Wahlberg), a retired military sniper who is pressed back into service by Colonel Johnson (Danny Glover). Johnson informs Swagger that there is going to be an attempt on the President's life and asks him to help figure out where and when the killer may strike. Swagger reluctantly agrees, but soon discovers that the whole thing is a set-up and he is chased by the FBI. Along the way, he enli<>ts the help of a rookie agent named Nick Memphis (Michael Pena) and 

ance by Lev on I lelm ("The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada"), who delivers an unforgettable turn as the expert of all things gun-related. Ned Beatty ("Rudy") and Elias Koteas ("Zodiac") do well in the bad-guy roles as a corrupt senator and nearly-psychotic agent. 
Turning in a surprisingly awful per­formance is Danny Glover. Not only is he completely unconvincing (and seemingly bored) throughout the film, but for some unbeknownst reason he speaks with an atrocious and laughable lisp. It's similar to when someone shoves a lot of cotton in their mouths to try to imitate Brando in "The Godfather," and instead comes off looking like a slobbering idiot. Considering the experience that he had in the "Lethal Weapon" franchise, it is highly disappointing to see him doing such a poor job. · 
While it is far from being a perfectly­contrived action flick, "Shooter" accom­plishes what it's there to do and is an enjoyable popcorn movie.

girlfriend, Sarah (Kate Mara). It isn't long before he dis­covers a full-blown conspiracy involv­ing Montana Sen. Charles Meachum (Ned Beatty). 

It's not that "Shooter" is a badly made film, though its penchant for awkward cuts renders parts of it initially (and momentar­ily) incomprehensible. There are several well-choreographed scenes, particularly an opening sequence (which ultimately winds up being the film's best segment) and a carnage-ridden battle outside of a house. 
The problem, however, is that "Shooter" is not nearly as complicated as it sounds. In fact, it purports to be a "thinldng-man's thriller" and, through awkward dialogue reaction is to cringe. 
As "Shooter" progress­
es, it becomes increas­
ingly obvious that the 

violence of the tilm is not the means to an end, it is the end ­Swagger's solution seems fueled by the sys­tem's failures, but that's precisely when "Shooter" loses the thread and becomes unrealistic and unlikeable. 
The film's pretenses toward social awareness make it even more mindless ­its naivety is cloying, its observations shal­low and contrived, its convictions laugh­able. There are no more redeeming quali­ties here than there were in "Rambo," and at least that film had the courage to revel in its buffoonery. "Shooter" is ultimately so simple-minded in its vigilantism that it becomes almost offensive -the longer the film drags on and the more people that Swagger kills, the harder it becomes to support him as a character. Yet the film treats Swagger like the ultimate hero ­the audience is clearly supposed to root for this guy, but his methods and ruthless and his moral character questionable. 
Nothing really sets "Shooter" apart, and the problems of plotting and dialogue are enough to make it a forgettable film. Wahlberg is game throughout, but not even his charisma can save "Shooter" from being another picture that fails to live up to Fuqua's potential. Nobody will likely go into "Shooter" expecting a masterpiece, but they might be expecting a fun and exciting, if pointless, action thriller -but even that audience will leave disappointed, because "Shooter" is a film that wants to be mor:e, when it should've known enough to be less.

DVD REVIEW 
'Blood Diamond' sparkles on special-edition DVD 
By SEAN SWEANY 
Assistant Scene Editor 
Very seldom do movies come along that combine an all-star cast, heavy action and a eompelling moral message into a successful and cohesive package. "Blood Diamond" is one of those movies. 
This Ed Zwick ("The Last Samurai") film examines what happens when dia­mond smuggler Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio) and a fisherman named Solomon (Djimon Ilounsou, "The Island") eross paths in war-torn Sierra Leone while rescuing both a rare and immensely valuable pink diamond and the tisherman's kidnapped son from sav­age militia forces. 
What ensues is a tense and jealous conf1iet between Archer's desire for the diamond and Solomon's quest to reunite with his son. Each man is forced to help the other in order to achieve his goals, until each realizes he is working harder to help the other man than himself. 
A war journalist (Jennifer Connelly) who accompanies the two men serves as the lens through which the events of the 
Blood Diamond 
Two-Disc Special Edition 
Warner Horne Video 


movie occur, offering insights and chal­lenges to their dilemma, but never judg­ing anyone's actions, no matter how self­ish they may be. 
The actors in "Blood Diamond" are superb, especially DiCaprio and Hounsou, whose performances earned them Academy Award nominations for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor, respectively. DiCaprio shows a dark and tormented side -while pulling off a South African accent -that continually forces the audience to question his motives and morals. 
This movie is Hounsou's jump from obscure supporting actor to lead actor, for his role is just as central to "Blood Diamond" as DiCaprio's. He handles the spotlight with ease and demonstrates that he has the ability to act right along­side the major players in Hollywood. 
The tale "Blood Diamond" tells is very human, but the scope is as epic of any of Zwick's prior films, including his most recent, "The Last Samurai." The main action scene in the film is the recreation of the siege of Freetown, a 1999 rebel attack. on Sierra Leone's capi­tal city. The violent and brutal scene 

lasts several minutes and is heavy on gun­shots, explosions and adrenaline, setting the tone for the rest of the film. 
The third critical component of "Blood Diamond" is the grip­ping message it tells about "conflict dia­monds"-diamonds acquired in war-torn countries like Sierra Leone of the 1990s and sold on the world market. The images and plot (which is inspired by a true story) give audiences cause to stop and wonder where our jewelry really comes from. 


The two-disc special edition DVD has special features that give viewers further cause to wonder about this important topic. "Blood on the Stone" is an inform­ative hour-long documentary that details the journey of a diamond from the earth to the store, shedding light on this some­times difficult and tension-filled process. 
Other features include an inside look at the effort put into the siege of Freetown sequence and an insightful commentary from Zwick. The presenta­tion of the film is excellent, especially highlighting the sound editing and mix­ing, which also earned "Blood Diamond" an Oscar nomination. 
While "Blood Diamond" did not win any Oscars among its five nominations, this does not detract from the fact that it was one of the best films of 2006. Strong acting combines with an exciting and thought-provoking story that keeps the audience engaged from beginning to end. While the two-disc DVD does not overflow with features, there is a perfect mix of extras that detail both the film and its message. Just like the title sug­gests, "Blood Diamond" is ultimately all about a mix -between brutality and beauty -where we all must find a happy medium.

By SEAN SWEANY 
Assistant Scene Editor 
With the abundance of "slasher" films taking over the horror genre at the box office, Hollywood seems to have shied away from making the "monster" film in attempts to scare audiences. Gone are films like "Godzilla" and 
tions. Fans of the fad­ing genre received cause to hope when it was announced that the South Korean monster film "Gwoemul" would be released in the 
U.S. under the title "The Host." 
As a highly anticipated foreign film, expectations were high that "The Host" would become the next "Jaws" upon its stateside release. Unfortunately, some­where between a tadpole being mutat­ed into a giant tadpole and people try­ing to kill it with Molotov cocktails, the film falls far short of these expecta­tions. 
The movie begins when a U.S. mili­tary facility dumps toxic chemicals into Seoul's Han River, eventually causing an innocent tadpole to morph into a giant, man-eating tadpole. When it several movies 
into one. There is a storyline about the deadbeat sin­gle father trying to raise a daughter. There is a storyline about a family try­ing to cope with its emotional difficul­ties. There is an undercurrent of satire about U.S. involvement in an affair that should rightfully be handled by South Korea. And hanging over all of this is a storyline about a giant mutant tadpole. 
No matter that any of these stories could have potential if developed prop­erly -they are so lazily developed by director Joon-Ho Bong that no one ends up caring at the end of the film which characters will live or die. More often than not, humor arises -unin­tentionally -out of situations in the film, even in what should be a sad scene when the family is mourning the death of one of their own. 


The most depressing aspect of "The Host" is that the monster is not scary. The CGI is poor and the monster mostly lumbers around like a St. Bernard, making it funnier than anything else. We assume that the monster is a "host," but this is not made clear, nor is there anything at the end of the movie to frighten viewers that the mutant has spawned offspring that will continue to terrorize society. 
The two-hour running time seems to drag on interminably, and at the film's conclusion, one wonders whether the plot could have been carried out in half the time so as to endure only half the pain. 
There is a chance that "The Host" is intentionally trying to be a B-list movie, but it fails at that goal. It also fails to do what a good monster movie should do -make the viewer fear the mon­ster. 
Viewers can rest assured that if they choose to endure "The Host," they will be no more afraid of tadpoles coming out of the theater as they did going in to it.

Associated Press 
PHOENIX-NFL com­missioner Roger Goodell hopes to hand down disci­plinary measures within 10 days of meeting with Tennessee cornerback Adam "Pacman" Jones and Cincinnati receiver Chris Henry. 
Goodell's new, stronger player-conduct policy has not been fully formulated, but he'll still meet next Tuesday with the two play­ers, who have had numer­ous run-ins with the law. 
"These are part of the hearings I've had with a player or coach facing dis­cipline decisions," Goodell said Wednesday as the league meetings conclud­ed. "It's to get their per­spective, look them in the eye and get them thinking. They are clearly (designed) to give me better info and more facts. I do it fre­quently." 

It could happen even more often, given the num­ber of off-field incidents that have recently plagued the league. 
Jones has talked to police in 10 separate inci­dents since being drafted in April 2005 and has been arrested five times. On Monday, Las Vegas police recommended prosecutors file a felony charge of coercion and misdemeanor charges of battery and 
IN BRIEF 
Bears fan prohibited from 
changing name to Manning 
DECATUR -Chicago Bears fan Scott Wiese is no Peyton Manning after all. 
Macon County Judge Katherine McCarthy ruled this week that Wiese can't legally call himself Peyton Manning because it would be too confusing and might infringe on the privacy of the Indianapolis Colts quarterback. 
And that's fine by Wiese. The 26-year-old resident of Forsyth, just north of Decatur, only was trying to change his name to make good on a bet he lost when the Colts beat the Bears in the Super Bowl. 
"I had told the judge that I was not doing this because I wanted to change my name, but I was doing it because I was honoring a bet," Wiese told the Decatur Herald & Review after Monday's ruling. "I think she understood that." 
threat against Jones, stem­ming from a Feb. 19 strip club fight and shooting. 
Henry is among nine Bengals players arrested in less than a year. He had four arrests in 14 months, including marijuana pos­session, a weapon charge and a drunken-driving count that resulted in a guilty plea to reckless operation of a vehicle. 
"I won't lump all of these incidents into a bowl and deal with it," Goodell said. ''I'm not trying to send a signal here and make examples of people. We'll do what we need to protect the integrity of the NFL. That's our objective." 
Jones' attorney, Manny Arora of Atlanta, said they hope the commissioner will wait until the Las Vegas case is resolved before taking action. 
If not, Jones is prepared to fight it legally, Arora said, especially if Jones were to receive a one-year suspension. 
"It's going to end up being a big fight. There'll be injunctions," Arora said. "The NFL will fight this and that. We're going to draw it out through the court, and the attention's going to go through the roof." 
The new player-conduct policy is expected to be in place before the April 28­29 draft. 

49ers ~back Gore gets 
new contract after big season 
SAN FRANCISCO -Running back Frank Gore has agreed to a four-year contract extension with the San Francisco 49ers, a reward for his team-record 1,695 yards rushing last season. 
Gore, who led the NFC in rushing in his second pro campaign, was due to earn $435,000 in the upcoming sea­son. With the extension, the Pro Bowl running back will be under contract to the 49ers through 2011 with a deal containing more than $14 million in guaranteed money. 
Niners coach Mike Nolan confinned the deal Wednesday morning at the NFL meetings in Phoenix. 
"He agreed yesterday," Nolan said. "He had a good day. 
"It's a little early; Frank just finished his second year. But we identified somebody we want in Frank. He's a young player and we wanted to extend it and it's still very early in his career." 
Roddick forced to retire 
from match due to injury 
KEY BISCAYNE, Fla. -Andy Roddick retired with a strained left hamstring in the first set Wednesday, allowing Andy Murray to advance to the semifinals of the Ericsson Open. 
Roddick said the injury occurred in the fifth game lunging at a shot. He called it quits trailing 5-3. 
"I just kind of jarred something at first," he said. "More and more it started becoming like a sharp pain, and then I started feeling it even when I was just kind of cruis­ing around the court, not even in points. It was steadily getting worse, which isn't a good sign." 
An MRI exam was scheduled. The injury leaves in doubt Roddick's availability for the U.S. Davis Cup team's match against Spain on April 6-8. 
Roddick said he thought of Davis Cup the moment he hurt himself.

Florida starters 111ake repeat chance possible 
Noah and Gators look for first back-to­hack titles in 15 years 
Associated Press 
GAINESVILLE, Fla. -When Corey Brewer, AI Harford and Joakim Noah announced they were coming back to Florida after last season, they were her­alded as unselfish. 
If they decided to stay another year, they might be considered foolish. 
That's why the Final Four probably will be the fmal run for coach Billy Donovan's dream team. Brewer, Harford and Noah are expected to turn pro after the season, breaking up the best team in school history and arguably one of the best in the college basketball in recent years. 
"We're just trying to fmish out strong and then we'll let the fans know and everybody else know what the deal is," Brewer said. "If we go out, we hope we go out with a national title." 
The Gators (33-5) are trying to become the first team in 15 years to win consecutive nation­al championships. They play UCLA (30-5) in the semifinals Saturday night in Atlanta, a rematch of last year's title game. 
Brewer, Harford and Noah combined for 41 points, 23 rebounds, 10 assists, nine blocks and four steals in the 73­57 victory over the Bruins in Indianapolis last April. ' 
Many thought the three soph­omores would turn pro a few days later, and probably end up as NBA lottery picks. But they surprised everyone by announc­ing in a choreographed skit at the team's championship cele­bration that they would be back to try to make history. 
It may have been an easy decision for Noah and Harford because of their family situa­tions; both grew up with money because their fathers were pro­fessional athletes. 
It was much more difficult for Brewer, whose dad farmed 100 acres of tobacco and soybeans in Portland, Tenn., and also moonlighted as a garbage col­lector in order to provide for the family needed. 
All the hard work might have taken a toll, too. Brewer's father, Ellis "Pee Wee" Brewer, had open-heart surgery and three angioplasties in recent years. He also had a leg ampu­tated in October because of complications from diabetes. 
"It was a tough decision," Brewer said about returning. "We could take care of our fami­lies, but we decided why not come back for another year and enjoy each other because we might not ever play together again." 
They've been even better this time around. 
Brewer improved his outside shooting. Harford developed post moves, started using his left hand and added a mid­range jump shot that he makes with regularity. Noah also got better with the ball and in the paint. 
Although all three honed their skills for the next level ­prompting speculation that they won't risk injury again by returning next year -they came back this season for other reasons. 
They wanted to play together, enjoy another year living togeth­er-Brewer, Harford, Noah and Taurean Green have been room­mates for three years -and make another postseason run. 
"We want to create a legacy," Noah said. "We want to make history. But we realize that we haven't won two championships yet. That's the goal. That's the ultimate goal. And it's close. It's really close. We realize to get there our total focus has to be on UCLA and nothing else." 
Regardless of how the season ends, the Gators already have established quite a legacy. 
They have won three consecu­tive Southeastern Conference tournament titles, an outright SEC regular-season title, a national title, two school-record 17 -game winning streaks and a school records for victories. 

NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL 
Final Four teams emerge 
Volunteers, Scarlet Knights, Tar Heels and Tigers to play for title 
Associated Press 

Half of the women's Final Four turned out as expected, with top seeds Tennessee and North Carolina facing off in a national semifinal. 
From the other side of the bracket emerged two unlikely championship contenders. 
LSU, burdened by controversy, and Rutgers, loaded with fresh­men, each upset a No. 1 seed to make it to Cleveland and create an unlikely matchup in the other semifinal on Sunday. 
"It's so hard to get to the Final Four now -the regionals are a lot like the Final Four used to be because there are so many great teams," North Carolina coach Sylvia I latch ell said Wednesday. "So many of the great teams have been eliminated. It's just so much more difficult to get there." 
Perhaps nobody had a tougher job than LSU acting coach Bob Starkey, who took over after Pokey Chatman's sudden resig­nation March 7 amid allegations of improper conduct with a for­mer player. 
Starkey won four straight games, including an upset of top-seeded Connecticut, to deliv­er the Lady Tigers' fourth straight Final Four appearance. 
"This has been a focused team from the very beginning of the season," Starkey said. "It made my job a little bit easier. I didn't have to create something that wasn't there. I just maybe had to draw them back and remind them of what we established." 
But reaching the sport's biggest stage is nothing new for the other thren coaches. 
Tennessee is making its 17th Final Four trip under Hall of Fame coach Pat Summitt, while

Rutgers coach C. Vivian Stringer, the only coach to take three schools to the Final Four, is here for the fourth time -a quarter-century after bringing Cheyney to the 1982 national semifmals. 
This time, she coaxed a Rutgers team that started the season 2-4 with five freshmen and no seniors to the Big East championship.

MLB 
Prior left off Cubs' opening-day roster 
Optioned to Triple-A Iowa after last game 
Associated Press 
MESA, Ariz. -Mark Prior was sent to the minors Wednesday where the Chicago Cubs hope he can regain the form that made him an 18­game winner and All-Star selection four years ago. 
Prior, whose career has been slowed by an assortment of injuries, was optioned to Triple-A Iowa right after his final spring training start. 
"It wasn't easy. But at the same time, this is good for his career," new Cubs manager Lou Piniella said. 
Prior had left the Cubs' clubhouse and wasn't avail­able for comment after pitch­ing just three innings in Chicago's 4-4 tie with the Colorado Rockies. 
"He handled it OK. He was­n't happy. He wasn't pleased. But you don't expect that," Piniella added. 
Prior, the second player cho­sen in the 2001 draft after a stellar final college season at Southern California, broke in with the Cubs in 2002. He has a 42-29 record, including 18­6 in 2003 when helped pitch Chicago into the playoffs. 
He was on the mound for Game 6 of the NL champi­onship series against Florida with the Cubs leading the series 3-2 and the game 3-0 before the Marlins rallied with eighth runs in the eighth. Florida went on to win Game 7 and then captured the World Series. 
Prior, 26, has started the last three seasons o~ the dis­abled list with an assortment of injuries to his Achilles, elbow and shoulder. He was limited to nine starts by shoulder problems a year ago when his record was just 1-6. 
He had four appearances and three starts this spring, pitching just 10 1-3 innings. 
The decision to go with Wade Miller as the fifth starter was announced Tuesday, so there was no place in the rotation for Prior, and his final spring outing really had no bearing on his chance to make the team. 
"I didn't want him to go out here and really really push to get a spot when in turn we had already made a decision on Miller," Piniella said. 
"I told Mark that there is a marked difference between what we are seeing now from what we were seeing much earlier in the spring. He's come a good ways. He just needs to continue to work." 
Prior gave up two hits and three runs against the Rockies, but they were all unearned because of sloppy play by the Cubs' outfield, which committed three errors. 
"He's making progress," general manager Jim Hendry said. "Every time out, he's been better. He's not quite there yet and I don't think he would disagree with that." 
Hendry said a member of the Cubs' staff would be pres­ent at every one of Prior's starts for Triple-A Iowa. 
"And obviously when he gets back to being where you want him to be, he'll be able to help us," Hendry said. "We'll make a spot for him when he's ready. I promise you that." 
But Hendry didn't put a timetable on Prior's return. 
"As long as he is making progress, what is the right time frame? A couple of weeks, a month?" Hendry said. "To me, if he keeps get­ting better, it will show up when he's ready for us." 
It was a long day for the Cubs' outfield. Alfonso Soriano missed a sinking liner for an error in thn first, ClifT Floyd had two errors in left. and Soriano and right fielder Jacque Jones let Troy Tulowitzki's long fly fall between them in the second for a double that led to a run. 
Soriano hit his fourth homer of the spring in the third, but then couldn't rP.ach Matt Holliday's fly to center that went for an RBI double in the fifth. 
Derrek Lee and Aramis Ramirez hit back-to-back homers off Tom Martin to tie the game in the sixth. 
Rockies starter Aaron Cook. who entered the game 4-0, allowed three hits and two runs -one earned -in four innings.

NCAA MEN'S BASKETBALL 
Collison tnakes Bruins forget they lost Fartnar 
Associated Press 
LOS ANGELES -UCLA fans were in mourning last June when Jordan Farmar, the Bruins' outstanding point guard, passed up his final two years of eligibility to turn professional. 
With the emergence of Darren Collison, memories of Farmar, who's mostly sitting and watch­ing as a rookie with the Los Angeles Lakers, have faded. 
"Jordan was very good. Darren has some natural athleti­cism, some natural quickness, that allows him to do some things for our team that we couldn't do last year," said UCLA coach Ben Howland. "Because of that, our team has really flour­ished." 
Collison has been especially effective in UCLA's march to the Final Four, averaging 13.8 points and doing an exceptional job of hawking the opposition's back­court players in four NCAA tour­nament games. 
UCLA leads with its defense ­one of the nation's best -and Collison is an extremely impor­tant ingredient in that regard. 
~ 
Sample.fares From South Bend to: 
Chicago  $131  
Atlanta  $182  
New York  

"Darren's probably a better on-ball defender than Jordan," Howland said. 
Collison played in all 39 games for the Bruins last year, averag­ing 5.5 points, 2.3 assists and 0.9 steals. The 6-foot-1 sophomore from Rancho Cucamonga aver­aged 12.8 points, 5.7 assists and 
2.3 steals this season. 
"Last year, I was providing energy ofT the bench, and I did absolutely what it took to help the team win, in whatever aspect," Collison said. "This year, I have a much bigger responsi­bility and a much bigger role. 
''I've got to be more mature in how to approach situations. I am an extension of the eoach. That's a big leadership role. I've got to make sure everybody's doing their job." 
Collison and the Bruins reached the NCM championship game last spring, losing 73"57 to Florida. The teams meet again Saturday in the national semifi­nals. 
"They came in for a reason. We came there just to be there," Collison recalled of last year's title gam_e.

NHL 
Miller, Sabres outlast Devils' patient gameplan 
Flyers put damper on Carolina's playoff prospects, Stumpe! forces shootout-then wins it as Florida beats Atlanta 
Associated Press 
BUFFALO. N.Y. -Now this was more to Ryan Miller's lik­ing. 
Unhappy with the Sabres' last outing, the goaltender was impressed with the patience Buffalo displayed in a 4-3 win over the New Jersey Devils on Wednesday night. 
Not only did the Sabres beat the opportunistic and defensive­minded Devils at their own game. the win inched Buffalo doser to clinching the Eastern Conference title. 
Not a bad way for the Sabres to bounce back from a sloppy 4­1 loss at Toronto last weekend, a game in which the goalie questioned his team's effort. 
"We got the rewards for play­ing the right way," said Miller, who stopped 28 shots. "The Devils play a very patient sys­tem that benefits them come playoff time. And we feel if we can play against that, we can play against a lot of teams in this league." 
Jochen Hecht scored twice, while the Sabres also got goals from rookie Daniel Paille and Ales Kotalik -both forwards playing their first games after missing extended stretches due to injuries. 
With six games left, the Sabres ( 49-20-7) extended their lead atop the East standings to seven points over the Devils, as well as idle Pittsburgh and Ottawa. Buffalo also moved into a tie for first place in the NHL with Nashville. 
Scott Gomez, Paul Martin and Zach Parise scored for the· Devils (45-24-8), who were coming off a 3-2 victory at the New York Islanders on Tuesday. Martin Brodeur stopped 19 shots and remains three wins short of matching Bernie Parent's single-season record for victories. 
Brodeur has 44 wins, tied with Vancouver's Roberto Luongo, for the NHL lead. 
"They hit their shots," said Brodeur, referring to the Sabres' final three goals coming on one-timers or off rebounds. "They sat back and were a pret­ty patient team. They didn't give us too much and they capital­ized on their opportunities." 
Just the way Sabres coach Lindy Ruff drew it up. It wasn't pretty, leading to a dull first two periods, but it was effective. 
"I think this was a real good win for our team," Ruff said. "The fact that we had to tone down the style of our play, that we had to be a lot more patient. And I thought we cleaned up a lot of the careless errors and the careless turnovers." 
The Sabres, who never trailed, took control when Paille and Hecht, with his second of the game, scored 4 minutes apart in the third period to put Buffalo ahead 3-1. 
Paille, back after missing 15 games with a broken finger, scored after Brodeur made the initial save on Adam Mair's shot from the right circle. Paille then beat Martin to the rebound and slid it through the goalie's legs. 
Hecht scored on a one-timer from the right circle, set up by

Martin cut the lead to 3-2 with 6:11 left, but Kotalik sealed the win 2 minutes later with a one-timer from the left circle. Kotalik returned after missing 16 games with a knee injury. 
"Now they have to go a long way to catch us," Kotalik said of the Sabres' conference rivals. "It's always a little confidence­booster for upcoming games." 
The Devils have the Atlantic Division race to focus on ­they're tied with Pittsburgh and both teams have five games left. 
The Penguins are on roll, 8-2­0 in their last 10, while the Devils are slumping, having lost five of their past eight. 
"They're not losing any games. They're just getting points left and right," Brodeur said of the Penguins. "So that's what we're aiming, to win every game and getting on a roll before the playoffs start." 
Flyers 5, Hurricanes 1 
With two road losses in two nights, the Carolina Hurricanes are perilously on the brink of spending the postseason at home instead of defending the Stanley Cup. 
Martin Biron stopped a penal­ty shot among his 23 saves and the Philadelphia Flyers stymied Carolina's playoff push with a win Wednesday night. 
"We need to put a good streak together," Carolina coach Peter Laviolette said. 
The Hurricanes could have moved into a playoff position in the Eastern Conference with a win. Instead, the defending champions are still on the out­side of the cutoff line after their second loss in two nights. 
They lost 6-1 at Toronto on T\tesday night and desperately need points out of all their final five games if they want to get back to the postseason. 
"Obviously, these are tough losses," Laviolette said. "We're in a fight to get back into the playoffs, so we need wins and we need to come on the road and take away points. We took away nothing." 
The NHL-worst Hyers were all but eliminated from the postseason picture in November and entered on a four-game los­ing streak. But sturdy goaltend­ing from Biron, two goals from Jeff Carter, and one each from Derian Hatcher, Mike Knuble and Braydon Coburn were enough for only their ninth home win this season. 
Ray Whitney scored his 30th goal for the Hurricanes, who have 84 points with five games left and trail Montreal and Tampa Bay by two points each for the final playoff spot. Montreal and Tampa Bay were both idle Wednesday night. 


"It doesn't mean we're out of the playoffs by any means," for­ward Craig Adams said. "Our fate is going to be in our hands. To lose two in a row is certainly going to make it a lot tougher." 
The Flyers went up 1-0 on Carter's 12th goal of the season late in the first. 
Then the Flyers got feisty after Adams drilled defenseman Denis Gauthier into the boards behind the net. Flyers defense­man Randy Jones went after Adams and got into a fight in the circle and was hit with a double minor. When the Flyers killed the penalty, they got one of the loudest ovations of the year. 
While Gauthier sprained his right wrist, the fight might have sparked them. 
A hooking penalty against Carolina was still being announced when Hatcher slid the puck between John Grahame's pads for a power­play goal and a 2-0 lead mid­way through the second. Grahame made 20 saves. 
Minutes later, Biron got to prove why the Flyers awarded him a $7 million, two-year con­tract a day earlier that firmly established him as their No. 1 goalie. 
Flyers defenseman Lasse Kukkonen closed his hand on the puck in the crease, setting up a penalty shot. Justin Williams streaked down the ice, but his shot was wide right and knocked off of Biron's leg pad and glove as the crowd roared in celebration. 
''I'm not known to be a great penalty shot or shootout guy, 
but you get lucky once in  a  
while," Biron said.  
Whitney  pulled  the  

Hurricanes to 2-1 with his shot from the point with 3.7 seconds to go. 
Any momentum the Hurricanes were hoping would carry over into the third was wiped out once Knuble and Coburn scored a little more than 90 seconds apart for a 4-1 lead. 
Carter added an empty-net goal with 32.7 seconds left. "We found a way to get that 
momentum back, get after it and have a great third period," Flyers coach John Stevens said. "Certainly, it was a great sign for us." 
Panthers 3, Thrashers 2 
The Florida Panthers are finally getting the hang of shootouts. They hope it isn't too late. 
Jozef Stumpe! scored the tying goal in the third period and notched the clincher in the shootout, leading the Panthers to a victory over the Atlanta Thrashers on Wednesday night. 
It was Florida's second victory in three shootouts after losing its first seven of the season. 
"If we'd won maybe half of those, we'd be in a different position right now," Stumpe! said. "But this was our problem and hopefully we're going to solve it and get better and better at it." 
Bryan Allen also scored for the Panthers, who are hanging on to slim playofl' hopes. Florida is in 12th place in the Eastern Conference and trails eighth­place Montreal by six points with five games left. 
The victory was only Florida's fourth in 18 overtimes this sea­son. The Panthers' 14 overtime losses arc tied for the most in the league with the Los Angeles Kings. 
Craig Anderson, in goal for Florida after Ed Belfour started a franchise-record 27 consecu­tive games, stopped 33 shots in regulation and overtime. He then stopped Vyacheslav Kozlov and Marian Hossa in the shootout. 
Anderson was 4-0 in shootouts this season for Rochester of the AHL, including three straight between Jan. 12-16. 
"It's a terrific feeling," Anderson said. "I give credit to the guys. If we don't score, we don't win. It's up to those guys to put it in, and they did a terrific jobofit." 
Vyacheslav Kozlov scored twice for Atlanta, which increased its Southeast Division lead to three points over idle Tampa Bay. Both teams have five games remaining. 
Kozlov also had a goal disal­lowed in the second period when the score was 1-1 after it was ruled he had kicked the puck in.

Nets win, gain stronger hold on playoff spot 
Spurs buckle down on defense and rally in fourth quarter to defeat Hornets 92-88, Barry hits four las~-quarter threes 
Associated Press 
EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. ­Rookie Josh Boone again pro­vided the New Jersey Nets a late-season lift in their push to nail down a playoff berth. 
Boone scored a career-high 22 points Wednesday night to lead the Nets to a 118-94 victo­ry over the Indiana Pacers. 
Boone came off the bench to hit 11 of 13 from the field. He also pulled down 10 rebounds in his second strong game. Boone was perfect on all 10 shots from the field in the Nets' 113-107 overtime win in Charlotte on Saturday. 
"It's great to be able to come out and contribute," Boone said. ''I've been working really hard in practice and waiting for my shot. Hecently, I've been get­ting it and I've been trying to make the best of my time." 
Bostjan Nachbar added 20 points before fouling out with 3 minutes remaining. Richard Jefferson had 14 points, Vince Carter scored 13, and Mikki Moore and Jason Kidd each had 12 as the Nets had six players in double figures. 
With the win, the Nets moved into seventh place in the Eastern Conference, a half­game ahead of Orlando and two games ahead of the Pacers and Knicks. 
"Indiana played last night and was short-handed without their best player," Nets coach Lawrence Frank said. "We took advantage of a team being short-handed and that is encouraging." 
Jermaine O'Neal, the Pacers' leading scorer, sat out the game with left ankle and knee sprains. Indiana could not over­come his loss, although Troy Murphy, who started in O'Neal's spot, had 13 points and 14 rebounds. 
O'Neal was averaging 20 points per game and had scored 39 and 32 points in his last two games. 
Shawne Williams led Indiana with 19 points. Mike Dunleavy added 14, Danny Granger and Darrell Armstrong each had 11, and Jamaal Tinsley had 10. 
The win was the second straight for New Jersey and its third in three games with the Pacers this year. 
Indiana has lost 16 of its last 18 games and 10 straight on the road. 
Carter hit a 3-pointer 2:29 into the game to give New Jersey a 9-6 lead. The Nets never trailed the rest of the way. 
New Jersey expanded that lead to 32-21 after one as Carter set the pace with nine points. 
The Nets lead by as many as 22 in the second quarter and took a 60-43 lead into the lock­er room at the half. Boone was 5-for-7 in the first half for 10 points to share the Nets' half­

time scoring lead with 
Jefferson. 

"Our undoing was the first 
half, where we shot 24 percent 
and gave up 58 (percent)," 
Pacers coach Hick Carlisle said. 
"You are not going to beat a 
quality team doing that, espe­
cially on the road. We have to 
be a lot better. We weren't. The 
result is obvious." 

The Nets outscored the Pacers 
31-23 in the third quarter as 
Kidd came alive with eight 
points after scoring only four in 
the first half. 

Kidd sat out the fourth quar­
ter and Carter played only 2 
minutes as the Nets reserves 
held the Pacers at bay. 
Spurs 92, Hornets 88 

Tim Duncan knew the San 
Antonio Spurs had to do some­
thing in the last quarter. · 
Down nine points going into 
the period, Dum~an had already 
done plenty, scoring 12 points 
in the third and hitting his first 
3-pointer of the season. 

So the Spurs turned up the defensive effort. holding the New Orleans Hornets to just 13 ·fourth-quarter points to win 
Wednesday. 

"We gave up a lot in tho previ­
ous quarters. It was a great way 
to turn it up," said Duncan, who 
led the Spurs with 31 points. 

Brent Barry hit four 3-point­
ers in the fourth quarter to help 
the Spurs rally for their fifth 
straight victory. lie finished 

with 15 points. Michael Finley added 13 and Manu Ginobili scored 12 for San Antonio. 
The Spurs swept their four-· game series with the Hornets, who have lost two in a row and are 4-6 in their last 10. New Orleans lost at home Tuesday to the league-leading Dallas Mavericks, 105-89. 
Chris Paul scored 20 points to lead six Hornets in double fig­ures. David West added 16, Jannero Pargo scored 13 and Hasual Butler had 12. 
Barry keyed the fourth-quar­ter rally. His third 3-pointer of the fourth quarter tied the game at 77 with 6:39 left. 
Finley's 3 gave San Antonio an 80-77 lead before Pargo tied it again.

Brown 
continued from page 24 
The Hobey Hat Trick includes Brown, junior for­ward Eric Ehn of Air Force and sophomore forward Ryan Duncan of North Dakota. The three finalists were picked by a 25-member selection com­mittee from a pool of 10 semi­finalists originally chosen by votes from every Division I head coach. 
"This is the ultimate in recognition," Irish coach Jeff Jackson said. ''I'm very happy for David, and I'm happy for our team too, because they're a part of David's success." 
The Hobey Baker is awarded to the college hockey player who displays, "strength of character on and off the ice, outstanding skills in all phases of the game, sportsmanship and scholastic achievements," the Hobey Baker Web site said. 
Brown, a native of Stoney Creek, Ont., was recently named CCHA player of the year and tournament most valuable player, after back­stopping the Irish to their first league regular season and playoff championships.

Irish win marks sixth shutout this season 
By DEIRDRE KRASULA 
Sports Writer 
When Notre Dame wins this season, it wins big. The No. 5 Irish swept Michigan State 7-0 on the road Wednesday to bring them to 1 7-3 on the season ­their sixth shutout so far. 
Due to inclement weather in East Lansing, the match, original­ly scheduled to be outside, was moved indoors. 
Notre Dame has struggled with the courts of the Michigan State Indoor Tennis Center in the past. The Irish inched past the Spartans in February 2005 with a 4-3 victory. 
With the decisive 7-0 win, Notre Dame ended any troubles it had with East Lansing. 
"This year, we laid those ghosts to rest," Notre Dame coach Bobby Bayliss said. 
The Irish jumped out to an early lead taking the doubles point. The team has faltered in doubles play recently but regained its momentum in its past two matches. 
Notre Dame relied heavily on singles play to secure wins in the final rounds of the Blue/Gray National Tennis Classic earlier this month. The Irish dropped the doubles point to Tulsa and Alabama in the semifinals and finals of the tournament before going on to win each match, and ultimately the championship 4-1. 
Bayliss said while the team has been struggling in doubles play, it has also been competing against very strong opponents. Tulsa's No. 41 duo of Diego Camacho and Ross Cunningham defeated Notre Dame's Barry King and Brett Helgeson 8-3 in the semifi­nals of the Blue/Gray. 
"We've been playing some pret­ty darn good doubles teams," them on, it's rewarding," Jackson said. "I spent a lot of personal time with David, and I certainly don't take any credit for his success, but I'm proud the time we spent together has helped him be recognized as one of the best players." 

Brown's superb stats, along with his league hardware, helped to make a case for his Hobey candidacy. The senior led the nation in goals-against average (1.58) and wins (30) this season, while he finished second in save percentage (.931). 
Jackson, who owns two national championships, has never had one of his players named to the final three Hobey spots in his eight years behind a college bench. The coach, in his second year at Notre Dame, said he first began to believe that Brown would make a run at the Hobey after the team turned the corner into the flnal third of the season. 
"When we won [the CCHA championship] at the Joe, I thought that might have pushed him over the top as a finalist for sure -if not the winner," Jackson said. 
After Notre Dame's 2-1 loss to Michigan State in the NCAA Tournament regionals Saturday, Brown's season was cut short one game before the Frozen Four -the weekend in which the Hobey is award­ed. Brown, however, is not the only one of the three finalists whose season is over. 
Ehn fell 4-3 to Minnesota with the rest of his Air Force squadron in the first round of the Tournament's Denver regional. Ehn finished the sea­son second in the nation in points (64) and assists (40), while he scored 24 goals. He is the first player from one of the military academies to make the top 10. 
North Dakota's Duncan. however, will be playing in St. Louis the day before the pres­entation when the Fighting Sioux face Boston College in the national semifinal. The 5­foot-8, 155 pound forward had 31 goals and 26 assists to fin­ish fourth in the nation in scoring with 57 points. 
Only two goaltenders have won the Ilobey in the award's 26-year history, the last of which was Ryan Miller of 
Michigan State in 2001  - now  
an  NIIL  All-Star  with  the  
Buffalo Sabres.  

"[The Hobey) should be about the player that has had the greatest impact in making his team successful," Jackson said of the Award. "And I don't think any one fits in that category as much as Dave does."

Notre Dame blanks Spartans 



Bayliss said. 
The Irish doubles teams had an easier time against Michigan State. Stephen Bass and Andrew Roth spent little time defeating Tyler Sauerbrey and Jason Norville 8-1 at the No. 3 spot. The No. 2 Irish doubles team of Brett Helgeson and Graham King clinched the doubles point with an 8-4 win over Michael Flowers and Alex Forger. Ryan Keckley and Sheeva Parbhu were unable to finish off the Irish burst and fell 8-6 to Adam Monich and Nick 
Rinks. · The team has been working on improving doubles play, Bayliss said, and it has paid off. 
"We have focused on our posi­tioning and our shot selection and it is paying some dividends," he said. 
After securing the doubles point, Notre Dame readily took to singles play. King was first off the courts for Notre Dame with a 6-0, 6-0 victory over Norville at the No. 4 spot. Keckley was next in line with another straight-set vic­tory, defeating Scott Rasmussen 6-3, 6-4. No. 54 Parbhu clinched the win for the Irish with a 6-1, 6-4 win over Forger. 
No. 8 Bass was last off the courts for the Irish as he battled in his second set against No. 45 Rinks. Bass took the first set 6-3 from Rinks but the second set was neck and neck and was forced into a tiebreaker. Bass finally won the set 9-7 for the match victory. 
"[Bass] is a terrific competitor," Bayliss said. "He hit big serves at key times in the match, and the win was a result of his ability to attack while still maintaining a solid back-court game." 
Bass's win over Rinks swept the match for Notre Dame. The Irish next take on No. 3 Ohio State Friday on the road.

All guts, no glory 
Weis' offensive line returns two starters 
By CHRIS HINE Sports Editor 
Media attention this spring may be focused on the skill positions, but Notre Dame's success hinges upon the play of the offensive line. 
Next season, the Irish return two starters to the line -fifth­year senior center John Sullivan and sophomore right tackle Sam Young -along with tight end John Carlson. 
Carlson, who was named offen­sive captain along with Travis Thomas, returns this spring after catching 47 passes for 634 yards last season and is adapting to his new leadership role. 
"Believe it or not. I do have a vocal side," Carlson said. "I prob­ably don't show it to [the media] very much, but behind closed doors it comes out sometimes." 
Carlson said he plans to lead more by example than words -a leadership style that runs in his family. 
"When I was a freshman in high school, my older brother Alex was a captain on my football team, basketball team and tennis team. Believe it or not, I played tennis," Carlson said. "We had a good relationship as brothers, but I always aspire to be like him as an athlete. He was one of those guys who led by example. He wasn't real vocal. When he need­ed to be he was, but I found just observing it was more effective at least with the guys we were around. That's what I aspire to be." 
Notre Dame coach Charlie Weis assigned a leadership position to Sullivan as well. Monday, Weis announced Sullivan would repre­sent the offensive line on the leadership committee. Sullivan will anchor an offensive front that returns just one other starter. 
Young will remain at right tack­le where he played last season, despite speculation that he would move to left tackle. 
"Anytime you got a guy that started 13 games at a position, he has a comfort playing that posi­tion," Irish offensive line coach

It is the first time in school history that an Irish player has reached the final three, continuing a season of firsts and never-have-befores for Notre Dame.

Irish hitters crush 
lowly Chicago State 
By CHRIS KHOREY Sports Ediror 

Notre Damo ended its three­game losing streak Wednesday with a resounding 14-4 win over struggling Chicago State on a rainy evening at Frank Eek Stadium. 
"We talked to the toam about not getting down and not getting frustrated," Irish coach Dave Schrage said. "They were loose today, they didn't stress out-they knocked some runs in. We really needed this from an emotional standpoint." 
The Irish evened their record at 12-12 with the non-conference win, while the Cougars dropped their second-straight game to fall to 1-24 on the season. 
Notre Dame got on the board early and often, getting two runs in the bottom of the frrst on an HBI single from center fielder Danny Dressman. The Irish added to their lead in the second when shorL<>top Brett Lilley, second base­man Jeremy Barnes and right fielder Michael Wright all crossed the plate to put Notre Dan1e up 5­0. 
The rout continued in the third, when left fielder Ross Brezovsky scored on a single by catcher Michael Smith. Smith reached home on a single by Lilley later in the inning, and Lilley scored on a single by third baseman A.J. Pollock. By the end of the liming, Notre Dame wa<> up 8-0 and every Irish player had reached base. 
The Cougars finally stopped the bleeding in the fourth. Side-arm­ing right-hander Mike Storrs eame

,_ Notre Dan1e postpones n1atchup with Rockets because of rain 
By MICHAEL BRYAN 
Sports Writer 
The only thing that could keep Notre Dame from another home win Wednesday wasn't its sched­uled opponent Toledo -it was the weather. 
Inclement weather postponed the non-conference matchup between the Irish (14-12) and the Rockets (4-14) to today. The game will still take place at 6 
p.m. at Ivy Field. 
Notre Dame enters the contest having won five in a row at home, a streak led by a red-hot pitching staff. Sophomore Brittney Bargar is 3-0 over the streak with an ERA of 0.35 and 20 strikeouts in 20 innings. For her three sparkling complete games, Bargar was named Big East player of the week. 
Freshman Heather Johnson, 

one of Notre Dame's offensive leaders during the streak. was also named to the Big East honor roll for the week. In the five Irish wins, Johnson battHd .538 with five doubles and six RBI. The infielder posted two three-hit games -including three doubles against Seton Hall -to match a Notre Dame record. 
The struggling Rockets head into South Bend on a three-game skid. Pitching woes have been the main source of Toledo's struggles -the Hockets have given up an average 6.8 runs per game. 
One of the few bright spots for Toledo this season has been first baseman Leslie Strong. The jun­ior has batted .370 on the sea­son, including four homers and 11 RBI. Aside from Strong, how­ever, the Rockets have also struggled on the offensive end ­no other batter is hitting over .250. 
The game against Toledo is an out-of-conference break for the Irish, who will return to Big East play this weekend with double­headers at home against Pittsburgh and Syracuse. The Hockets begin MAC conference play Saturday against. Buffalo.
