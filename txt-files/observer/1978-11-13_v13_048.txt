Officer refuses to take polygraph 
by Michael Lewis News Editor 
Thomas Balogh, a South Bend Police officer and former part-time Security officer at Notre Dame, may be relieved of his post tomor­row night at the South Bend board of Public Safety meeting. 
Police Chief Michael Borkowski told the South Bend Tribune Satur­day he will ask for Balogh's dismissal because Balogh refused to take a polygraph test in connec­tion with the recent arson fires at Notre Dame. 
Meanwhile. a team of investiga­tors headed by Dean of Students James Roemer is working on the case for the University. Richard Conklin, director of Information Services, explained that lie detector tests are being used ''to try to determine what actually happened.'' 
"Our investigations have caused us to give lie detector tests to several people. Some have already taken the test and others are scheduled to," he added. 
Commenting on the rumor that a security officer under investigation had a history of arson offenses, Conklin said, "There were certain things in that person's background that leads one to investigate that person." 
Conklin added, "there was a former employee who became a possible suspect in the case be­
cause  of  possible  motivation  in  
terms  of  getting  back  at  the  
University.''  

However, Conklin stressed, "Right now we have no concrete evidence linking the fires with any individual," noting that the investi­gation was pursuing all possible avenues. 
He explained that the investiga­tors were examining files to deter­mine if "anyone with the motive and opportunity" to set the fires coule be identified. 
Conklin declined to comment on Borkowski's request, noting that ''whatever circumstances Balogh finds himself in now are between himself and the Police Depart­ment." 
Balogh and former Security officer Robert Gardini both re­signed from the Security force after the fires, citing "personal rea­sons." Four of the five fires over October break were reported by Balogh and Gardini. 
In addition, Conklin said that Balogh's resignation came at the height of a conflict between Balogh and the University concerning handgun policy. Balogh claimed that, as a police officer, he is required to carry a handgun at all times, but University regulations, Conklin said, permit only the Director of Security and the three watch commanders to bear fire­arms. 
The Tribune reported that Balogh said he has personal distrust of polygraphs from knowledge of them in other cases. He also noted that polygraphs are not permitted as evidence in court. The Tribune quoted Balogh as saying, "Every­thing will be worked out without any further problems.'' 
The article also said Balogh plans to meet with Borkowski today to work out their difficulties, but 
·Balogh declined to say whether he would consent to take the poly­graph test. 
The Notre Dame investigators include Roemer, director of Secur­ity Joe Wall, and the St. Joseph County Sheriff's Office. The University also hired Michael

In special session 
Council outlines proposal 
by John McGrath Staff Reporter 
At a special session of the Hall Presidents Council last . night in Fisher Hall, Student Body Presi­dent Andy McKenna outlined the main points of a proposal dealing with the overcrowding situation on campus. 
The HPC reviewed the proposal, but took no action on it. The proposal was formulated by the Campus Life Council's Subcommit­tee on Overcrowding and will be presented for action at tonight's CLC meeting. 
"My feeling is that the Univer­sity realizes the crisis that any kind of lottery would cause,'' McKenna said. "After talking to Fr. Van (Wolvlear, Vice President for Stud­dent Affairs), I think that if the demand (for housing exceeds the supply, the Administration will be able to meet those demands." 
McKenna explained that the proposal's purpose is to present a list of housing alternatives to the Administration, "so that between now and Christmas, they should be able to line up plans to deal with the situation and then set priorities on how the alternatives should be implemented.'' 
The proposal deals with two courses of action; first, what McKenna called "band-aid solu­mentioned several possibilities to create more housing from space that is presently being used ineffi­ciently. 
tions,"  and  secondly,  long-term  
alternatives.  
The  Student  Body  President  

They include converting extra unused rooms for hall staff into residence rooms and the creation of new rooms in such dorms as Lewis and Holy Cross where there are large areas for social space. 
The proposal, as outlined by McKenna, also suggested a re­evaluation of the present Resident Assistant (RA) setup. 
'...the CU"wettgit~ fteaQi0eg the Cftmm...' 
The proposal focused on recruit­ing more RA's, especially Juniors, from inside the dorms themselves; moving up the date for RA selec­tion; and better use of some RA rooms, specifically those designed as doubles, but which are now being used by the RA only. 
McKenna went on to indicate a variety of long-term solutions in­cluding an investigation into the acquisition of some present struc­tures on campus. 
"We can pretty well rule out St. Joes, Brownson and Moreau Sem­inary right now, but Columba Hall would make an excellent residence hall," McKenna said. 
''The Brothers of the Holy Cross have a 99-year lease on that building, and although there are advantages to their moving, the situation is out of our hands right now," he quickly added. 
Other long-term options included the construction of townhouses similar to O'Hara-Grace, the pos­sible leasing of hotel or nursing home space, and the development of an off-campus mobile home court. 
McKenna also indicated that enrollment figures should be in­vestigated to determine whether the University is following any kind of definite plan for enrollment. 
"Then finally, if all the alterna­tives are exhausted, there would have to be some kind of lottery," McKenna explained, commenting, "I think the best way would be to go hall by hall.'' 
He stressed to the HPC that it presently appears very unlikely that there will be a lottery. 
He pointed out, however, that "if it would happen, it would tarnish the image of the Univer­sity ... Besides, if they ( administra­tion) are going to Jose a quarter of a million dollars (by not effectively using existing space), it would be better for them to put it into some kind of investment on campus so they could get their money out someday."

LATINA Italy [AP)··Police identified a man. gunned down at a stakeout for a prosecutor's killers as the brother of a terrorist sought in the Aldo Moro case. The critically wounded man was identified as Paolo Sebregondi, 31, elder brother of Stefano Sebregondi, 26, who is on the list of those sought for questioning in the kidnap-murder of former Premier Moro. Police sources had reported shortly after the arrest Saturday that the captured man was actually Stefano.

Protests sweep across Iran 
TEHRAN, Iran [AP] • Clashes 
between troops and anti-govern­
ment protesters claimed nine lives 
in Iran's oil belt, the Iranian news 
agency reported yesterday, and oil 
workers defied a government dead­
line for ending their crippling 
13-day-old strike. 
The opposition National Front 
Party issued a statement in Parie 
claiming another eight persons 
were killed in the city of Babil on 
the Caspian Sea, but that report 
could not be confirmed. 
A key anti-government Moslem 
religious leader, meanwhile, 
blamed President Carter for "c.om­
plicating" the Iranian crisis with 
his support of Shah Mohammad 
Reza Pahlavi. 
The reported violence was the 

bloodiest since the shah appointed 
a military-led government last 
Monday. 
The Pars news agency said six 

persons, including an army ser­
geant, were killed and 23 demon­
strators wounded Saturday in 
Khorramsbahr, about 410 miles 

southwest of Tehran. 
Protesters set fire to 15 banks and 

a number of shops before troops 
moved in to disperse them, Pars 
said. 
In Ahwaz, about 70 miles north of 

Khorramshar, soldiers shot and 
killed three persons Saturday when 
a group organizing a demonstration 
refused to disperse, Pars reported. 
The months-long anti-shah cam­

paign has been led by Moslem 
clergymen opposed to the shah's 
westernization of this traditional 
Islamic society and has been joined 
by political dissidents demanding 
democratic reforms of his authori­
tarian rule. 
The exiled Moslem leader 

Ayatullah Khomaini, a central fig­
ure in the opposition, said in an 
interview in Paris that Carter's 
"protection of he shah is complicat­
ing the current crisis in Iran." 
Most of Iran's 37,000 oil workers refused to obey government orders yestel'day to end their strike, which .has slashed oil exports by 60 percent and threatens the national 
economy. 
The oil workers launched their 

strike Oct.. 31 amid swelling opposi­
tion to the shah's rule. They also 
demanded a 22.5 percent pay hike, 
which was approved by the shah

'Death March' ends without incident 
by Sue Wuetcher Senior Staff Reporter 

No serious incidents were re­ported Friday afternoon during the annual Senior class "Death March," traditionally held the day before the last home football game. 
Dean of Students James Roemer said that he received a telephone call Friday afternoon about 4:20 
p.m. from the South Bend Police Department saying that officers would start making arrests. Stu­dents were openly drinking in the streets and blocking traffic. 
Roemer stated that he asked the police to give him 45 minutes to "clean house.'' He then called Mike Roohan, student body vice president, to send people to the bar area to spread the word about the possibility of arrests. 
Sergeant Russell Ryker of the South Bend Police Department noted that the march was not that much of a problem. "It's not that big of a deal," he said, "other than it creates traffic problems." 
Ryker stressed that most of the complaints received concerning the death march were related to traffic problems. "We don't care if they (the students) march,'~ he said, "if they would keep on the sidewalks or in only half of the street so that cars can get through. We don't wnat the kids to get run over." 
According to Ryker, no arrests were made during the march. He added that if arrests were to be

SU Record Store Best Choice 
an independent newspaper serving Box Q 
Vice-President for Student Affairs 
Father John Van Wolvlear will soon 
announce his decision on the Student 
Union Record Store proposal at tonight's
meeting. According to an article in last 
Friday's Observer, the position of Van 
Wolvrear Is still unclear. But if one 
examines the statements Van Wolvlear has 
made, It is obvious his position is more 
than unclear; It Is contradictory and 
unreasonable. 

When speaking to the Hall Presidents Council on Nov. 1, Van Wolvlear question­ed the effectiveness of a student-run business. Later, when commenting on the cash flow of the Student Union, Van Wolvlear reversed this objection of effec­tiveness and turned to another unrealistic concern. "The Student Union Is one thing," he said, "but this would be a business that you have to run, day In and day out, open and close It every day."What, Van Wolvlear may be asked, Is Campus Press, or, to stretch It further, the SU ticket office? Both these SU activities must be opened and closed every day.They have been effectively run by students for year. It Is obvious Van Wolvlear Is grasping at straws. 
Van Wolvlear then commented that SU Director, Bill Roche, has "researched this thing thorougly." It seems unlikely that Roche would pursue the proposal if tie had any doubt It could not be run well bystudents. The failure of an SU record store would reflect poorly on the credibility of the Union, and Roche In particular. Roche has already admitted he will drop the proposal if Van Wolvlear can find a fJood reason. As of yet, no "good reason' has been presented. · 
Van Wolvlear's most recent concern Is whether It would be better to have an SU record store, or a group of student-run businesses similar to Flanner Records. Byvoicing this concern Van Wolvlear has admitted the need for an alternative to the Hammes Bookstore record selection. But he Is also contradicting his other fears.

Liberals and Big Business 
=:::=:=:::-:::::=::::::::::::::::::::::::::=====:=============:=:=::::::::::=:=:::::::=:=:=:=:::=:::::::kevin richardson 
The following is a commentary concerning big business and liberal causes in America. It represents a personal interpretation of an article on the same subject contained in a newsletter sent by Congressman John M. Ashbrook of Ohio to his constituents. 
The most potent force in helping 
liberals achieve their goals in this 
country is not the liberal college 
professor or politician. It is not the 
news media or even the vocal and 
militant leaders of the large and 
powerful labor unions. The fact is 
that nothing has been more effec­
tive in promoting the cause of 
liberalism in American society than 
big business. 

(To the politically aware at Notre 
Dame, my views regarding free 
enterprise, the private sector, so­
cialism/ communism, big govern­
ment, and patriotism are well 
known. I am anything but anti­
business so my appraisal of this foe 
comes with enough credentials, I 
believe, to make the case objective­
ly.) 

Big business is an ever-present 
force in the iron triangle than runs 
American politics. This iron tri­
angle is, in part, made up of the big 
business types--mostly eastern and 
predominantly banking/invest· 
ment houses. They work side by 
side with elitist foundations and 
high-powered liberal interest lobby 
groups--who form the other two 
sides of the iron triangle to which I 
refer. 

These groups are closely tied to our government. The closer you study our government, the more you realize this silent but firm hand controls our destiny. The ranks of the most influential policy makers in our society are made of up those who go back and forth between the foundations, eastern big business boardrooms and the government. 
Typical examples of those who play this big business/foundation/ government game are Robert Mc­Namara, John Gardner and Cyrus Vance. McNamara went from Ford Motor Company to the government as Secretary of Defense and from

You name it--whether it's trade with the Communists, surrender of the Panama Canal, nationalization of our welfare system, establish-~ ment of a guaranteed income, "normalization" of U.S. relations with Communist China--you will find a group of decision makers who fit the mold I have cited above calling the shots. Former govern­ment officials along with the big business, foundation and academic types are running the show. They promote those causes quietly and, sad to say, very effectively. The average citizen is just a number to them. They know "best" and they will lead. 
Oh how the Council of the Americas must have gloated on January 18, 1978 when they met with President Carter ~nd his key 
.. or Har~ld Brown not his infamous Panama change. And on and on it goes. Carter reciprocated Congressman Ashbrook has stu­"The Council of the Americas is died this issue for more than 
· one of the most prestigious and twenty,years. He has thousands of influentialm groups of business pages in his files which detail over and professional leaders in our and over the shell game which is nation." Have you ever heard of outlined in this article. them? Probably not. They are part I have had my first encounter with of that secret government'' that the Iron Triangle in the past two influences all major actions in years. My experience comes from Washington. Their next target is dealing with the corporate pjolitical 
Castro's Cuba along the McGovern 
sellout line. 
The Trilateral Commission, which 
includes big businessmen at the 
very highest levels (such as David 
Rockefeller), met with Carter on 
Red China, offering to help bring 
about "normalization of relations." 
Time after time these eastern big 
business types have the key. 
This is not.a partisan issue. The 
Iron Triangle types have had the key to Republican White Houses, too. In fact, the thing that galls me the most is that most of these John Gardner-Robert McNamara types are Republicans. 1, like Congress­man Ashbrook, prefer to call them Trojan Horse Republicans. They don't believe anything that we conservatives, the dominant Repu­blicans believe. Every Democratic Admini~;tration puts a few Republi­cans in at top levels. They are almost always the eastern big business-foundation types and help make sure that we do not change their basic control over American politics. A change from Henry Kissinger to Cyrus Vance is not much of a chance. A change from . Robert McNamara. to Melvin Laird 
action committees (PACs) who, primarily, donate to liberal incum­bent Congressmen and ignore, for the most part, challengers who would undoubtedly vote for real free enterprise. These PAC direc­tors receive their marching orders from the eastern home offices of 
these giant corporations. 

Somewhere, sometime, some­place this disaster lobby of eastern big business/foundation/ academic types has to be displaced. Ameri­cans must elect someone who is truly an outsider. Jimmy Carter said he was an outsider. In truth he was the candidate of these eastern big business types more than the candidate of the rank and file bemocrats who worked so hard on his behalf. 
If we can start to understand this cozy relationship between the foun­dations, big, business and the government, we can begin to unlock their strangle-hold on the political process. It is vital to our survival that we break-up this · fraternity of government officials, corporate ex.ecutives and founda­tion chiefs. They have had it their . way too.Jon~, .Jt is-time for all 9f U'i 
discovered that I was sharing my crackers--not with my buddy--but with WORMS!!! 
Not only was there a family of 
·worms in each remaining cracker, but also a couple of larger critters (whose names I don't know, but they resembled large flees) were residing in my food. 
I realize I don't have to waste my time and your space describing how this affected my stomach, but I do want to squeeze in the fact that I become quite disturbed and dis­custed everytime I wonder how many of the little creatures I downed. 
Happy Belated Halloween to you, too, Notre Dame Vending and · Nabisco!!! 
people. 

So next time you're sitting in class and you hear how the coalition of conservatives and big business is responsible for our nation's pro­blems, think twice. Mention the facts presented in this article. Talk about the political prostitution of the corporate PACs who give the lion's share of their money to liberal incumbents in Congress. Talk about the eastern big business executives who suck eggs with the President and promise support for goals that are often not in the best interest of the country. 
Don't be surprised, however, if you have a very irate professor on your hands. You see, by mention­ing these facts, you will have blown the whistle on the greatest cover­up of all time--the secret relation­ship between big business and the 
.liberals.. .

Q. 

When the big weekend roDs around, I find myself left out in the cold. Now with winter coming on, I could really use some extra money to burn, to stay warm. Any Idea where I can pick up some extra bucks? 
A. 

Well, you can either sell your soul, or try the Morrissey Loan Fund. We suggest the latter. Located in the basement of LaFortune, the Morrissey Loan Fund is open Monday thru Friday from 11:30 to 
12:30. You can borrow up to 150 dollars with one day's notice. The interest is a nominal 1o/o and you must repay the loan within 30 days. Have a hot time! 
Q. 

Night Masses are fine but once in a whUe, I feel like getting dressed up to get back into the "Spirit" of things. What time are the services over in the big buDding next to the dome? 
A. 

The big building is called Sacred Heart Church. Masses in the main 
chapel are at 5:15p.m. on Saturday, then at 9:30, 10:45, and 12:15 
Sunday morning. In the Crypt, the masses are 6:00, 7:15, 8:30,

Yugoslavian prof to speak on 'Just Society' 
by Cathy Santoro 

Professor Mihailo Markovic, who was suspended from teaching in Yugos~ian universities because his teacHings on neo-Marxism were considered subversive to the State, will speak at Notre Dame today and tomorrow. 
Today's lecture at 8 p.m. in the Library Auditorium is entitled ''The Distribution of Power in a Just Society." Tomorrow at 10 
a.m. in the Library Lounge Mar­kovic will speak on "Scientific Predictions and Visions of the Future." The lectures are spon­sored by the Philosophy Depart­ment. 
Markovic is a member of the Praxis group which has been officially proscribed by the Yugos­lavian government. The Praxists are neo-Marxist philosophers who are "concerned about the freedom of the individual in a Marxist state" according to Fr. Ernan McMullin, Professor of Philosophy at Notre Dame. 
Markovic is one of seven phil­osophy professors who was forbid­den to teach in the Yugoslavian universities five years ago. He was suspended from teaching at the University of Belgrade after a battle between the State and the University Senate. Although the universities defended the Praxis group, President Tito and the Communist Party insisted they be suspended from teaching because their neo-Marxist views were con­sidered a danger to the State, McMullin added. 
McMullin describes Markovic as a "leading defender of modern human freedom, a freedom which has been undermined in Com­munist countries like the USSR and Yugoslavia." Markovic hopes to defend the individual against the authority of the State. McMullin states Markovic's theory is unique because he in arguing out of Marx's own text. 
Markovic is allowed to travel abroad and is currently teaching at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. He is known for his writings on neo-Marxist ethics, theories of freedom, and the philo­sophy of the social sciences. 
His works in English include From Affluence to Praxis: Philoso­phy and Social Criticism (1974), The Contemporary Marx (1974), and Self-Governing Socialism (1975). 
CUSTOMER INFORMATION FROM GENERAL MOTORS 
BOW TO PROTECT THE PAINT ON YOUR CAR 
GRAVEL, SUN, INDU$TRIAL POLLUTION, AND ROAD SALT CAUSE MOST PROBLEMS. 
Where you live and where you drive will determine the kind of problems you could have. 
If you drive on gravel roads or roads with a gravel shoulder, you can avoid nicks_ and scratches by increasing the distance between your car and the car in front of you. Tires, as you probably know, can pick up small stones and '"fling" them out at great velocity. If you're too close to the car ahead, the sharp stones will hit. your grillwork and fenders very hard. Increase the distance, and the stones lose their velocity and fall back to the ground before your car hits them. 
In areas of the CQuntry where"'the sun is very strong, some color change may occur over time unless you protect your car from direct sun. Parking in the shade is a good idea, and using a garage or some form of carport will, help to minimize the sun's effect not only on the paint. but on the interior trim, as well. 
Damage from industrial pollution is a problem in a few places. You can help pro­tect your car's finish from these pol.lutants by keeping your car m a garage. 
Road salt is extremely corrosive and can literally eat through paint and metal. So if you live in an area where salt is used extensively, wash your car frequently. Don't forget to rinse the underside of the car, too, where salt tends to collect. If you take it to a commercial car wash, remember, if they use recy­cled water, it may contain salt. ' 
We do recommend thatyou wax your car regularly. Use a wax that is also a cleaner or use a separate cleaner to remove accumulated dirt and salt. The wax will serve as a protective coating that can help to preserve the finish. 
But no matter what you do to protect your car's finish. some nicks and scratches are unavoidable. For the sake of your car's appearance and to 
~ avoid rust problems, buy some touch-up paint from your GM dealer or a local supplier. It comes in small quantities. and you can apply it yourself in a minute or two. While the paint never looks as good as when the car was new, the touched-up spot will look better than a nick, and the metal will be protected from exposure. 

Our goal at GM is to paint cars so_ that they look just great and really keep their looks. And we are try­ing to do ~o in a way that is energy-efficient, environ­mentally sound, and not harmful to the health of the people who do the painting. It's a tall order, but GM can do it. We're doing it now.

Answers to Friday's puzzle 


If you're a junior or a senior majoring ir1 math, physics or engineering, the Navy has a program you should know about. 
It's called the Nuclear Propulsion Offic,?r Candidate­Collegiate Program (NUPOC-C for short) a11.d if you qualify, you can earn as much as $650 a month right through your senior year. Then after 16 weeks of Officer C mdidate School, you'll receive an additional year of advanced technical 
education. This would cost you thousands in a civilian school, but in the Navy, we pay you. And at the enc of the year of training, you'll receive a $3,000 cash bonus. 
It isn't easy. There are fewer than 400 c penings and only one of every six applicants will be selected. :But if you ma:k:e it, you'll have qualified for an elite Jngineeri.ng training program. With unequaled hands-on responsibility, a $24,000 salary in four years, and gilt-edged qualifications for jobs in private industry should you decide to leave the Navy later. (But we don't think you'll want to.) 
Ask your placement officer to set up an interview with a Navy representative when he visits the campus or contact your Navy representative at 312-657-2169 (collect). If you prefer, send your resume to the Navy Nuclear Officer Program, Code 312-B537, 4015 Wilson Blvd., Arlington, Va. 22203, and a Navy representative will contact you directly.

[continued from page 8] and Brownschidle both in the sin bin, Bill Baker skated rings around the three Irish penalty killers right on the doorstep of the net and put a wrist shot by the helpless Laurion, whose head must have been spin­ning after making a flurry of saves just beforehand. It was not the only time in the International Falls, Minn., native showed signs of brilliance in that period. When the Irish coughed the puck up out front just two minutes into the game, Laurion robbed Steve Ulseth of a sure goal when, after being deked out of position, he caught a piece of the rising puck headed for a wide open net and defelected it over the crossbar. With seven minutes to go, Eric Strobel unleashed a tremendous slapshot to Laurion's blind side but he came sliding 
across for another acrobatic save to 
keep the game close. 

Don Micheletti notched his 
second goal ofthe series at 18:40 of 
the first period when he caught the 
Irish defense asleep and was able to set up right out in front of the crease and converted a Christoff pass into UM's second goal of the game. 
Both penalty boxes had standing room only at the end of the first, when, at 19:49, three players from each team were sent off for roughing after a heated pileup in front of the ND net. 
Minnesota goalie Steve Janaszek stopped Weltzin on a penalty shot one minute into the second period, when the Irish forward was pulled down from behing while skating uncontested on goal. Weltzin's wrist shot went high and wide, and Janaszek never touched the puck. 
Irish down Tennessee 
in their first meeting 
[continued from page 8] yards on six carries. Heavens now has a total of 705 yards rushing. Montana completed only 11 of the 25 passes he attempted, but those tosses were good for 144 yards. His counterpart, Streater, was accurate on 17 of his 28 passes for a total of 204 yards. For his 
efforts,  Streater  was  named  the  
game's  most  valuable  offensive  
player.  

The Notre Damlj defense was again lead by the linebacking tandem of Bob Golic and Steve Heimkriter, both of whom had 18 tackles in the game. Golic leads the team in total tackles with 133 and "Kritter" is right behind him with 129 stops. Their closest competitor is Mike Calhoun with 87. 
Golic summed up the sentiment of the graduating players saying, "it's over. There are no more home games. Four years really go fast." 
The victory boosts the Notre Dame record to 7-2 and closes out the home football schedule for 1978. The team will finish the regular season by traveling to Georgia Tech and then USC. With the loss, Tennessee's record drops to 2-5-1.

The Gophers increased their lead at 17:21 of the second period when Neal Broten put a 35-foot slap shot by Laurion's glove side for a 3-0 lead. The Irish failed to convert on a five-?n-three skating advantage four mmuted into the period while also holding the Gophers off when Kevin Humphreys received a five 
minute  major  for  elbowing  two  
minutes later.  .  
Tom Michalek prevented a  UM  

shutout with a neatly executed backhander that caught the upper right comer of the net at the 4:07 mark of the last period. Bart Larson stromed up ice 26 seconds later and beat the Irish defense to skate in on Laurion alone and beat him unassisted to end the scoring. The Irish were called for 29 minutes in penalties while the Gophers accumulated 25. 
"With as many penalties as we had called on us, we did and excellent job skating shorthand­ed," commented Smith. "I was pleased with our passing game as well. We did not come through when we had the skating advan­tage, however, and that is some­thing we will have to work on. 
"We won with an excellent, overall performance Friday night and they beat us Saturday. It's that simple. We now have a better idea of where we stand and what to work on so it is Just a matter of continuing to improve each week," Smith added. 
The Irish host the first of two consecutive home series this week­end when the Spartans of Michigan State visit the ACC.

[continued from page 8] seconds to play. 
Notre Dame's five starters-­Tripucka and Orlando Woolridge at forward, Flowers at center, and Branning and Wilcox in the back­court--could manage just 36 points between them. 
The Soviets led 53-41 at the intermission, and their lead was never in serious jeopardy in the second half. Branning fed Flowers underneath to pull the Irish to within four points at 61-57 with just under 15 minutes to play, but the Soviets scored 12 of the next 16 points to put the game out of reach. 
The international rules which governed the game placed the Russians at an obvious advantage, as they scored basket after basket ?ff their transition game, where just a step advantage often led to uncontested layups. 

The visitors also enjoyed some .rather creative officiating, which was maddening if not directly related to the outcome. On several ~casions the officials were ;tt a loss to explain their actions, especially in what instances the ball must be handled by a referee on inbounds plays. 
But the Irish were obviously rusty in their first game of the season. Notre Dame committed a total of27 turnovers, to the obvious dismay of Irish coach Digger Phelps, who several times showed his displeasure in front of the bench.
