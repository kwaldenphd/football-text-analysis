AIDS group o ers Quilt panel meetings 
By SARAH DORAN 
Associate News Editor 

In preparation for the upcom­ing campus display of The NAMES Project AIDS Memorial Quilt, AIDS Ministries/AIDS Assist of South Bend is inviting those interested in making a · quilt panel to work together each Saturday until the display arrives. 
"We want people to come here to try and get a sense of what they have to do to make a panel in the sense of organizing their emotions into a fabrica­tion," said Associate Director of AIDS Ministries/AIDS Assist Ethne Kennedy. 
The three by six foot panels are made in remembrance of someone who has died of AIDS. They are to be added to the AIDS Memorial Quilt, which has over 30,000 panels. 
A portion of AIDS Memorial Quilt -about 300 panels ­will be on display in Stepan Center February 25 through 27. 
The NAMES Project Foundation, which owns the AIDS Memorial Quilt, encour­ages area groups to hold meet­ings for those interested in making a panel as preparation for the display, she said. 
Although fabric materials and a quilt maker will be available, Kennedy expects that those who come to the meetings will be looking more for advice about "the story they want their panel to tell." 
"I think that the meetings will lean more towards sitting down and talking about ideas than learning about the technical working of a panel," she said. 
Panels submitted for inclu­sion will be displayed along side of the AIDS Memorial Quilt in the Stepan Center exhibit. 
Although the group is sched­uled to meet before the exhibit arrives, future meetings may be added after the display is over. 
"People will be inclined to make a panel only after they have seen the Quilt," said AIDS Ministries/AIDS Assist volunteer Kathleen Royer, who is also a service group coordinator at the Center for Social Concerns. 
The group will meet February 5, 12, and 19 from 2 to 5 p.m. at AIDS Ministries/AIDS Assist, which is located at 211 North Saint Louis Street. 
Literature outlining panel specifications and method to be followed for submission into the AIDS Memorial Quilt is avail­able at this office, the Center for Social Concerns, and the Hesburgh Library office of Campus Ministry.

U.S. grants IRA leader limited visa 
ByJIM ABRAMS 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON 
The United States granted a limited visa Sunday to Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, the Northern Irish political party that supports the out­lawed Irish Republican Army. 
The White House said in an­nouncing the step, which per­mit Adams to attend a New York conference, that President Clinton "supports this difficult decision and believes it will help advance the cause of peace in Northern Ireland." 
In London, the British gov­ernment said Sunday night it hoped that the decision to grant the two-day visa will per­suade Sinn Fein and the IRA allies to renounce violence in its campaign to seeking to end British rule in Northern Ireland. 
Clinton and Secretary of State Warren Christopher discussed the issue several times before the decision was made, State Department spokesman David Johnson said. 
The White House said Attorney General Janet Reno, at the recommendation of Christopher, issued a "waiver

Arafat says agreement with Israel near White homeland possible 
By ALEXANDER HIGGINS 
Associated Press 
DAVOS, Switzerland 
Israel and the Palestine Lib­eration Organization will reach a final agreement "very soon" for Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and Jericho, PLO chairman Yasser Arafat said Sunday. 
Israeli Foreign Minister Shi­mon Peres stopped short of any predictions on the arduous ne­gotiations. But Egyptian For­eign Minister Amr Moussa told reporters that the PLO-Israel talks had cleared all the major hurdles. 
"We would like to have a comprehensive peace," Peres told a privately organized gath­ering of political and business leaders from around the world. His speech contained no specifics. 
"We are still working," he also told reporters, saying many differences remained to be resolved.

CDC, colleges refine and refocus AIDS programs 
Editor's note: The follow­ing is the first in a three­part series examining AIDS education and awareness on college campuses. 
By JOHN LUCAS 
Associate News Ediror 
A series of 10 unique ads were released by the Centers For Disease Control (CDC) last month for broadcast over the television and radio airwaves. 
While the spots were not dif­ferent than previous ads in the fact that they advocated con­dom use or abstinence from sexual intercourse, most used the images or voices of Caucasian, African-American, or Hispanic young adults. 
The use of a young adults in the spots is a sign that the CDC has become increasingly con­cerned with the 18-25 age group's susceptibility to catch­ing sexually transmitted dis­eases, particularly AIDS, ac­cording to Melissa Shepherd, the CDC's chief of social marketing. 

"When looking at the 25 and under group, all indicators point to the fact that we need to look at HIV prevention mes­sages," she said. "There's a serious knowledge gap in the sexual behavior of that group. This is clearly a starting pbint." 
One of the biggest statistics supporting Shepherd's new program is a CDC study show­ing that by age 20, 86 percent of men and 77 percent of women report having had sex­ual intercourse, while far less use a condom, or engage in protected sex. 
Correct use of a condom will prevent AIDS and other sexu­ally transmitted diseases, Shepherd said, but it is vital that the under 25 age group begin to listen to the messages of the CDC. 
CAMPUSES RESPOND TO AIDS 

At the forefront of the battle to educate young adults are AIDS education programs and health clinics at colleges and universities across the nation. Since the CDC supports only a few programs at the college level, the institutions must make their own choices about how to best educate students about condom use. 
Serving a community of near­ly 50,000 undergraduate and graduate students, the University of Minnesota's health education program is the na­tion's largest, and a model for others across the country.· 
"Since we know that 75 per­cent of our population is sexu­ally active, we'll spend every dollar we get to increase the level of AIDS education here," said David Golden, University of Minnesota's director of health education. 
Several aspects of Minnesota's program include confidential AIDS testing, a stu­dent task force, and condom education and distribution. 
Golden  estimated  that  
Minnesota distributed  over  
40,000  condoms  last  year  
alone.  

"We give them (condoms) to RA's to give out, we give them to a houses, we even put them in candy machines -we dump them all over the place," he said. "After we put them in the machines, we did not receive one letter or call of complaint. That was beyond even my ex­pectation." 
Although Minnesota and other public institutions are able to distribute and educate students about condoms, Shep­herd said she would like to see more schools with religious affiliation do the same. 
"Condom education, used in a balanced approach, with education about abstinence, is not contrary to monogamy." she said. "There's really more middle ground here than you would believe. All we want to do is get the information out in a scientific manner." 
Being Catholic should not mean being uneducated, agreed Dr. Arnold Mazur. director of health services at Boston College, a Jesuit institution. 
"We're able to do a number of different things here, from a number of different angles," he said. 
The Boston College program includes pamphlets, photo dis­plays, AIDS education posters and even the NAMES project

Zhirinovsky: A sequel to skip 
Not so long ago, our--------------­
world was in a similar situ­ation as it is today. A once powerful country had been brought to its knees, and a seemingly ineffective gov­ernment was in charge of it. There was rampant inflation and many dissatis­fied citizens. In this mess, a small party had steadily Eric Ruethling climbed its way up from Photographer the pits of the extreme, 
minority parties and ________ established itself in the major house of the gov­ernment. 
The weak government was then turned over to that party's leader, who promised a new age of prosperity and increased standing in the world. That time was yesterday, sixty-one years ago. That country was Germany. That man was Adolf Hitler. 
How could such a man, come to power? He had been pushing his anti-Semitic message ever since his release from prison. He proposed the strengthening of Germany -a return to the days before the treaty of Versailles. 
The end result of it all was a nightmare o total war, mass exterminations, and mindless savagery. Most Americans view World War II as our shining moment in the world. You will find that many people in Europe find the war to mean much more, and to have a higher signifi­cance. 
Earlier this week, the anniversary of the siege of Leningrad was observed. A estimated 25 million people died in the Soviet Union during World War II. One would think that if someone was to insure that this never happened again, it would be Russia. We find quite the contrary. 
Recently, Vladimir Zhirinovsky, leader of the "Liberal Democrats", and his party acquired major gains in the parliament of Russia. His party's presence in such numbers could put the brakes on Yeltsin's attempts at reform. Many people, are stunned at this news. and are afraid of what is to come out of further elections. 
Not only does he present serious problems to the "westernization" of Russia, by proposing a return to the old workings of.the communistic age, he is also a stout racist and is hungry for conflict. He recently went on tour to several eastern European countries, and eventually found himself either barred from entering, or run out of the country by the populous ­because of previous rallies and speeches involv­ing racist topics. 
This guy is not a snake like David Duke, who puts on a pseudo-political image when talking to the press. He is a raving racist who says openly on a live interview with CNN that i America returns Alaska to the Russians, he'll send in the Russian military to " ... help you get rid of all the blacks." This is no Moammar Kaddafy, who threatens to use force and hides when our carriers sail into the Mediterranean. He is a loose cannon who sent members of his party to Iraq during Desert Storm to " ... fight American imperialism and their allies." This is no Saddam Hussein, who says he only wants to reclaim what is the rightful property of the Iraqi people. He is a war-monger who has men­tioned several campaign speeches, the conquest of former Warsaw Pact nations and former Soviet states as well as taking over parts o Finland, Mongolia, and even Japan. 
This man is not a simple-minded Adolf Hitler. This man will have several hundred nuclear warheads under his thumb if he comes to power, and the ignorance to use them.

World lags in education of girls 
WASHINGTON 
Some 85 million more boys than girls receive elemen­tary and secondary educations worldwide, according to a report that says the gender gap in education leads to more babies, more disease and greater hardship. 
The study, released Sunday by Population Action International, documents for the first time the gap in 112 countries and estimates the cost of equalizing education. 
"Educating girls is one of the best investments any country can make," said Joseph Speidel, president of PAl, which works for worldwide access to family plan­ning and population stabilization. 
Based on 1991 data. it says $6.5 billion annually could educate 76 million more girls to close the gap in coun­tries where it is most serious. 
The annual cost is estimated to triple over the next dozen years. but the report says it would pay back in lower fertility rates, fewer infant deaths, better hygiene, reduced poverty and higher literacy. 
"The educational status of women has a great deal to do with how many children they have and therefore population stability," said Shanti Conly, a population researcher who edited the study. 
Prominent economists and social scientist have come to agree in recent years that educating women helps im­prove conditions in developing countries, especially for rural people. 
The study rates each country on a 100-point scale ac­cording to the educational attainment of women, female­male enrollment ratios and the percentage of females en­rolled. 
France and Canada, where women average more than 11 years of schooling, top the list, both with scores above 99. 
At the bottom, scoring 21, is the central African nation of Chad, where the average woman has less than a month of formal schooling and there is one girl in sec­
"Doubtfire" tops Hanks' "Philadelphia'' 
LOS ANGELES 
"Mrs. Doubtfire" narrowly edged "Philadelphia" at the box office this weekend, according to industry esti­mates Sunday. "Mrs. Doubtfire," star­ring Robin Williams, earned about $8.1 million according to estimates released before the Super Bowl, which tradition­ally keeps viewers away from movie theaters. "Philadelphia," starring Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington, was 

close behind with $7.8 million. Final figures were to be released Monday. "Grumpy Old Men," pairing Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon, earned an estimated $5.1 million, and the new thriller "Blink" had $4.6 million. "Intersection" starring Richard Gere and Sharon Stone earned $4.3 million, and "Schindler's List" took in $3.5 million. "Iron Will" was seventh with $2.9 million, fol­lowed closely by "The Pelican Brief' with $2.8 million. "Shadowlands" and "Tombstone" rounded out the top 10 with $2.4 million and $2.3 million, respectively. 
Four Taco Bell employees shot

Four employees of a Taco Bell restaurant were found shot to death Sunday in an apparent robbery. The em­ployees were each shot several times, police told the Clarksville Leaf-Chronicle. The restaurant safe had been blown open and 20 or more spent shells from two weapons, a shotgun and a 9mm pistol, were strewn about the restaurant, police said. The victims had been work­ing the Saturday night shift. The restaurant's drive­through window closed at 2 a.m.; the dining room closed at midnight. A manager n{)ticed their cars in the parking

Ex-Supreme Wilson's son killed in wreck 
BARSTOW, Calif. 
Former Supremes singer Mary Wilson was injured and her 14-year-old son was killed when the Jeep she was driving hit a freeway median and overturned, authorities said Sunday. Rafael Ferrer was pronounced dead at Barstow Community Hospital about two hours after the 
7:30 a.m. Saturday crash, San Bernardino County Deputy Coroner Monika Padilla said. Wilson, 49, was taken to Lorna Linda University Medical Center, but her injuries weren't believed to be serious, Padilla said. Hospital spokesman David Schaefer refused to confirm or deny that Wilson was at the hospital. Wilson and her son were traveling from Los Angeles to Nevada and Wilson may have fallen asleep at the wheel, Padilla said. Wilson's Jeep Cherokee drifted to the right side of Interstate 15, and when she overcorrected the vehicle swerved across the highway, plowed into the median and overturned, Padilla said. Wilson, a Detroit native who lives in Los Angeles, was the only member of the Supremes to stay with the group from its 1959 inception to its breakup in 1977. Lead singer Diana Ross left in 1969. The Supremes' hits included "Where Did Our Love Go," "Baby Love," "Come See About Me," and "You Keep Me Hangin' On."

Trial for accused leader of Hamas group begins

JERUSALEM An Arab-American accused of

being a key organizer for the military arm of the militant Is­lamic Hamas movement went on trial Sunday behind closed doors. 
Mohammed Salah, a 39-year­old used-car dealer from Chicago, was arrested a year ago while visiting the occupied West Bank and indicted in Oc­tober. 
The charges against him were never made public, but Israel radio reported at the time that Salah was accused of commanding Hamas' armed underground. 
The army denied reporters entry to Sunday's proceedings at the Ramallah military court, just north of Jerusalem, saying it was a preliminary hearing and such sessions are usually held in secret. 
But Salah's attorney, Avigdor Feldman said the court was closed because a member of the Shin Bet security service who was testifying said he

Salah's family was also de­nied access to the courtroom, although an observer from the

Consulate spokeswoman Lea Perez said she would not com­ment on the trial while it was in progress. 
Israel has accused Salah of giving $60,000 to Hamas and claimed another $100,000 was found in his Jerusalem hotel room when he was arrested. He has also been accused of giving $96,000 to Hamas to establish an armed military force in August 1992. 
Salah, who has not lived in the West Bank for more than 20 years, has denied the alle­gations. He has said his visit last year was to distribut!'l char­ity from Palestinian-Americans.

Kevorkian rallies to gain support for amendment 
By JULIA PRO DIS 
Associated Press 
LIVONIA, Michigan 

Standing like a preacher on a candlelit, flowery pulpit, Dr. Jack Kevorkian began a peti­tion drive to legalize assisted suicide by urging about 700 Sunday churchgoers to join his crusade. 
Kevorkian needs more than 250,000 signatures to place a constitutional amendment on the November ballot. 
In a speech between services at St. Paul's Presbyterian Church, Kevorkian spoke of the "right not to suffer" and damned the "tyrants" who passed Michigan's law banning assisted suicide. 
"It's almost an insult to put this on the ballot. It's an insult to human reason. Why? Be­cause that right exists. We have to remind ourselves that right is there," said Kevorkian, who has been present at the deaths of 20 people since 1990. 
The enthusiastic audience gave several standing ovations as Kevorkian, a 65-year-old re­tired pathologist, spoke in front of a tall wooden crucifix and an open Bible. 
Two people holding Bibles over their heads briefly inter­rupted the program as one yelled, "This church has been cursed today!" 
"As a Christian, I think it's a disgrace that he stood in front of the crucifix," Dave Reuschle of Plymouth said after the rally. 
But others said Kevorkian's presence showed the church's open-mindedness. Kevorkian was invited to speak by Pastor Thomas Egglebeen, who said the belief of many Christians that suicide is a mortal sin is a fallacy borne of politics instead of theology. 
"It's a hoax that's been hoist­
ed upon us by the institu­
tionalized church. It's just not 
true," Egglebeen said. "There 
are six or seven incidents in 
scripture where a suicide is re­
ported and it's treated kindly 
and tragically. In no way at all 
is the person condemned." 
The Presbyterian Church it­
self has taken no stand on the 
issue, but it does favor abortion 
rights, Egglebeen said. 
Archbishop Adam Maida of 
the Roman Catholic 
Archdiocese of Detroit has spo­
ken out against Kevorkian and 
assisted suicide. 
After the rally, hundreds of 
people stood in line to shake 
Kevorkian's hand, get his auto­
graph or have their picture 
taken with him. Kevorkian was 
flanked by two bodyguards.

Under the ANC proposal, whites could vote April 27 on whether to establish a whites­only homeland. The ballot would be separate from na­tional elections April 27-29 for a new, multiracial government. The ANC is expected to win those elections.

The PLO leader took Peres by the hand Sunday to lead him up the stairs to the stage for a joint appearance before economic forum. 
The brotherly gesture con­trasted with Israeli Prime Min­ister Yitzhak Rabin's hesitation to shake Arafat's hand at the September 13 signing of the Is­raeli-PLO accord that set up the current talks. 
In Davos, Peres also trans­lated into English questions for Arafat from a French reporter and enthusiastically shook hands with the PLO leader for photographers. Both leaders smiled and appeared relaxed together. 
And the Israeli paid a tribute to Arafat that once would have been unthinkable, saying the PLO leader "personalizes the great suffering of the Pales­tinian people."

Schools see direct involvelllent 
with new student loan program 
Marquette 
. .

participates, Northwestern waits on plan 
By DAVID ClAIRMONT 
News Writer 
Within the next two months, colleges selected for the new federal student loan program will finish processing the exten­sive paperwork as they approach the actual loan date of July 1. 
The selected schools for the new federal student loan pro­gram represents a nation-wide involvement in the program. The final list of participants includes 34 public four-year colleges, 24 private four-year schools, nine community col­leges, and 38 proprietary schools. 
Each institution chosen for the program must have partici­pated in past federal loan pro­grams and have a loan default rate of less than 25 percent. Thr,y also must have used the Perkins aid ·program in the past and have the minimum techno­logical capabilities necessary to participate in the program by means of electronic networks. 
The group of schools chosen to participate in the program's first year is "intentionally well distributed," according to Daniel Goyette, director of the Office of Student Financial Aid at Marquette University. 
Most, if not all, schools will be involved in the program by the beginning of the 1995-96 academic year, said Goyette. Marquette, he predicts, will be among those schools and is "very much in support" of the program. 
The Marquette office is not presently advertising the pro­gram to its undergraduates, Goyette said, because it "impos­es an additional transition bur­den" on students. 
BRIEFS 
California schools suffer brunt of earthquakes 
The recent earthquakes in Los Angeles cause serious dam­age and the delay of classes at five colleges located near the epicenter. California State University at Northridge suf­fered the heaviest damage, with a parking structure collapsing, a science building catching fire, part of the library roof caving in, and computer terminals being damaged or destroyed. Administrators worried that student records could have been damaged or lost. with reg­istration and graduation beilig hindered by the potentially-lost data. 
Pierce College, Mission 
College, College of the Canyons, 
and Santa Monica college also 
·:  Students receive direct loans from their college instead of from · private lenders. .  Replaces the financially-troubled Pell Grant and Perkins Loan programs, saving taxpayers an estimated $4.3 billion through 1998. 
 
Has a flexible payment schedule, allowing students 10 years to repay loans or the option of national service work for two years in return for housing and expense money and a $5000 education voucher for each year of service. 

 
Lowers Stafford Loan rates by .6 percent by eliminating some 


current processing fees. .  Wilt allow the IRS to deduct money owed for loans from the · borrower's gross pay by 1996. 
MINUSES: 
 
National service plan accepts less than one percent of the nation's college students. 

 
Will not take full effect until 1998. Until then, only the neediest of students will be eligible to receive direct loans. 

 
Participation among schools is strictly voluntary, though most are expected to participate. 

 
Banks and loan organizations have raised questions about the ability of the Department of Education and colleges to manage the new system effectively. 

 
Payment of $10,000 per year was reduced to $5000 per year after successful lobbying by veterans' groups who claimed college students would receive more money than those who had risked their 




lives in the armed forces. 
"There is no need to give out the information to the students. It will be transparent to them," Goyette said. 
"The effect of its (the pro­gram's) implementation is unknown," said Rebecca Dixon, associate provost for University Enrollment at Northwestern University. "We are adopting a

going to make get­ting more money easy but it's not.'

wait and see attitude." 
Dixon noted that the current government program for finan­cial aid to students is a "gigan­tic multibillion dollar program" and it is unrealistic to expect to transfer such a system to a direct loan basis. 
"Students think it's going to make getting more money easy but it's not," Dixon said. 
Dixon explained that critics of the direct loan program have 
suffered severe structural dam­age and class delays. Administrators have been forced to find alternate loca­tions to resume classes until facilities can be repaired on campus. 
Swarthmore to transfer after harassment claim 
As punishment for harassing a female student for a date at Swarthmore College, freshman Etwart Yearwood is being sent to another school, with his tuition to be paid by Swarthmore. Ordered by the university to "actively avoid" student Alexis Clinansmith, Yearwood was suspended by the school's disciplinary board for violatjng its order and forced to undergo counseling at the school's expense. After two concerns. The first is that the government will not be able to run the program, at least not in the way which would be most benel1cial to the students. 
Because the government must hire the lowest-priced contract, which is often short­staffed and faced with high employee turnover, reorganiz­ing the federal educational funding will be very difficult, Dixon believes. 
The second problem Dixon pointed to was capitalizing on the program. Although the loans will start immediately, "the payback won't start for years," she said, stating that banks are the institutions with the experience in such matters as wire transfer of money in between accounts. 
Some colleges "will be absolutely dependent" on time­ly transfers of funds, Dixon observed. 
The federal direct loan pro­gram "will save students money, but the tax payers will pay for it," Dixon said. 
threatening to sue, Yearwood was offered the transfer com­promise by Swarthmore President Alfred H. Bloom. A temprary transfer to Columbia University had been planned, but the university has refused Yearwood's admission due to his academic record. 
Congressman proposes to protect ticket buyers 
With thousands of University of Wisconsin football fans denied entrance to the Rose Bowl after they had paid travel agents for unavailable tickets, Rep. Scott Klug, R-Wis., plans to propose the "Badger Fan Protection Act" in Congress to protect buyers of college bowl ·game and NCAA Final Four tournament tickets offered bv charter operations. If passed. 
Loan plan lost amid NAFTA, health care 
By DAVE TYLER 
News Writer 
Lost behind NAFTA, health care reform and foreign affairs events of 1993 was the announcement of the Clinton administration's new student loan program. 
The President's program favors direct loans between a university and its students·, rather than current policies which use government agen­cies as a middle man. 
The Clinton plan has several attractive features, including a flexible payment schedule that allows students up to ten years after graduation to pay back loans or the choice of partici­pating in Clinton's new nation­al service program. 
This method of payment allows college students to work as teachers, relief workers, police or other service-related workers for two years. The stu­dents would receive housing and expense money and a $5,000 education voucher for each year of service. 
The Clinton package would also help to lower interest rates. Loans would be paid back at .6 percent lower than the current Stafford loan rates. By 1996, borrowers may have the option of the IRS taking a percentage of their gross pay as payment for the loan. 
While the plan is inviting, there are several pitfalls asso­ciated with it. Clinton's nation­al service option will accept less than one percent of the nation's college students. 
Several veteran groups lob­bied the payment down from $10,000 a year, claiming that those who have served their country in the armed forces would be cheated if college stu­dents could recieve more money for less dangerous work. 
Other problems with the plan have evoked some criticism. While the plan will be available for the 1994-95 school year, the plan will not take full effect until1998. 
the Department of Transportation must approve package deals sold through agents as it already does for the Super bowl. 
University supports ban on whites from groups 
In response to the Black Law Student Association refusing to allow two white women to attend its meetings at Hamline University, in St. Paul, Minnesota, administrators expressed their support of the right of minority-student groups to exclude whites. Students plan to challenge the new policy which has yet to be approved by the trustees. 
Information from the Chronicle ofHigher Education 
NOTRE DAME 
Direct lending has recently emerged as one of the most contentious higher-education policy issues before Congress. 
Proponents of the new plan say direct lending will save the government billions of dollars by eliminating the need to sub­sidize lenders. However, banks and organizations that buy and sell loans say that direct lend­ing will lead to chaos because the Department of Education and colleges are ill-equipped to manage the system. 
Joe Russo, director of Financial aid at Notre Dame, has investigated this new plan and has expressed concern for the outcome of the first-year experiment with the system. 
His focus has been to create a system of financial aid that will be beneficial to both stu­dents and lenders. He feels that in order to improve the current system, specific revisions are needed. 
Included are the need for the standardization and of the entire student loans process to reduce cost to the government and borrowers, and the need to reduce defaults, protect the consumer, and more fairly dis­tribute responsibilities involved in administering the loans. 
Russo is skeptical of the new program, not wanting to see Notre Dame, which has a default rate of less than one percent, shaken by the new wave of reform. 
"The government may be able to pull it off this first year," Russo said. "It will be interesting to see." 
The 105 schools selected to participate in the Federal Direct Student Loan Program (FDSLP) for the 1994-95 acade­mic year represent a cross-sec­tion of public, private, four­year, two-year, and proprietary institutions. 
Notre Dame is not among these schools and probably will not be until 1996 when statis­tics will show the program's direct effect upon students and their colleges. 
"The fact that the University 
of Notre Dame has not volun­
teered as a nrst-year partici­
pant will have no negative 
impact on Notre Dame students 
for 1994-95, as the provisions 
for both loans are virtually the 
same," said Russo. 
Russo predicts that two years will show if the FDSLP will be effective in the long run. "In the third year, if it is success­ful, you'll see a whole bunch of schools participating, including ours possibly," Russo added. 
Information about the new 
program is currently available 
upon request at the financial 
aid office but only in text, as no 
simplified brochures are in cir­
culation yet. 
"Will it be cheaper? Will it 
save the money it's supposed to 
save? Will there be standard­
ization? Will it be more effi­
cient? Will it eliminate scam 
schools? Will it reduce the 
cost?" Russo inquired. !lis 
response: "To be announced."

I Irish take over first place in the MCC 

By DYLAN BARMMER 
Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame women's basket­ball team moved into sole possession of first place in the Midwestern Collegiate Conference with an impressive 80-67 homecourt win against Detroit Mercy Saturday night. 
The Irish win, coupled with a loss by Butler University to LaSalle earli­er that day, enabled the Irish to move into first place alone with a 4-1 MCC record. 
Going into Saturday's game, the Irish shared first place with both Butler and Detroit Mercy, with each team owning a 3-1 record in MCC play. 
Against the Titans, the Irish came out strong, controlling the tempo early. 
Senior forward Tootie Jones, who
.­
fmished the game with a career-best 22 points, scored first for the Irish, who went on an early 12-0 run to pull ahead of the Titans at 16-5 just 
6:41 into the game. The swarming Irish defense forced 11 Titan turnovers in the first half, and the offense lit up the board from long range, shooting 5 of 9 from 3­point range. 
This aggressive style of play on both sides of the ball contributed to a 41-30 Irish first half lead, and forced the Titans to play catchup in the sec­ond half. 
Tootie Jones had 10 points for the Irish in the first half, and senior for­ward Sherri Orlosky finished the half with 12, nine of which came off 3­point shots. 
In the second half of the game, the Irish had to contend with a more aggressive Titan team, led by guard Amira Danforth, who scored 16 sec­ond half points to finish with a game-high 25 points. ' 
The Titans, bolstered by the play of Danforth and the support of a group of vocal fans, pulled to within eight points of the Irish when Marnie Buchanan drained a 3-pointer to make it 59-51 with 9:51 left in the game. 
That was the closest Detroit Mercy would get, though, as Tootie Jones exploded for eight of the Irish's next 10 points, and freshman sensation Beth Morgan would connect for 10 second half points. 
A solid team effort would result in a 80-67 final score, as the Irish post­ed their 13th straight win against the Titans. Notre Dame now leads the series 19-2, including an 11-0 record at the JACC. 
Most importantly for the Irish, though, the win put the team, now 13-5, in complete control of first­place in the competitive MCC. 
Irish head coach Muffet McGraw was impressed \\'ith her team's per­formance, saying, "This was a really big win. With Butler's loss, we're now in sole possession of first place, which is where we want to stay. Tootie Jones played great and Sherri Orlosky also played very well, with a season-high 19. The bench also con­tributed well, and was an important factor in the game, as it has been all season." 
The next test for the Irish will come next Saturday when they travel to Chicago to face Loyola University (5-12 overall, 1-5 MCC). 
No journey is too long for Leary's family and friends 
By DYLAN BARMMER 
Sports Writer 

Fan support is something that any athlete appreciates, al­though sometimes to a degree. 
While most athletes will never get to meet many of their most ardent supporters, family mem­bers and close friends are often their most influential fans. 
When senior point guard and floor leader Kara Leary took to the court along with her team­mates on the Notre Dame women's basketball team in a crucial game against Detroit Mercy on Saturday night, eight such fans were in the stands at the JACC to see her play. 
Kara's mother, cousin, and six other friends made the 700 mile trip from Nashua, New Hampshire to root on the fiery 5-5 senior and her teammates. 
The group arrived at Michi­ana Regional Airport at 7 a.m. Saturday morning via a private jet called a Citation. The jet was piloted by Dick Hawkins and Don Cantrell, two friends of the Leary family. 
The arrival of the group came as a complete surprise to Leary, who helped contribute to the Irish's 80-67 win over the rival Titans with a team-high seven assists and five steals. 
Saturday's game was the fifth that Leary's mom has attended this year. She was also in at­tendance for the Brown Tour­nament at Providence, where Leary was named MVP. 
Leary has come a long way as a player for the Irish. 
A walk-on in her freshman and sophomore seasons, Leary took over the starting position midway through her sopho­more year, when the team was lacking in cohesiveness. 
The Irish went 8-4 after Leary's insertion into the start­ing lineup, and went on to the NCAA's, eventually winning their conference. 
Leary split time her junior season, playing in all but two games, and in this, her final season, Kara has found herself a team captain who is averag­ing nearly eight points a game and leading the Irish with 91 assists and 43 steals. 
It is play such as this that has earned Leary the admiration of many fans, who no doubt would agree with one of the family friends, who commented, "We were very fortunate to be able to see Kara play."

No Kidd-ing: Cal upsets No. 1 UCLA 
By WENDY E. LANE Associated Press 
OAKLAND, Calif. 

Jason Kidd took over the game, and once again a new team will take over the No. 1 ranking. 
Kidd had 18 points, a career-high 14 rebounds and 12 assists Sunday, leading California to an 85-70 upset of UCLA, which ensured itself of becoming the latest top-ranked team to have a short stay in that spot. 
The Bruins (14-1, 7-1 Pac­10), who were the last unde­feated team in Division I, never led during the game and shot ·ust 38 percent. They moved into the No. 1 spot last week, then barely beat Stanford, 69­65 Thursday night. 
Kidd stepped up after George Zidek's free throw with 
4:41 left pulled UCLA to 70-68. He fed a pass to Ryan Jamison for a layup, then proceeded to score nine of the last 11 points for the Golden Bears (12-4, 5­2). He added a steal and a de­fensive rebound in the waning minutes. 
"I just let the game come to me," Kidd said. "I don't tell myself to take over the game. I

go how the pace is going." 
The pace, which Kidd estab­lished from the start, was fast and the play physical. But Cal's switch to a zone defense forced the Bruins to go outside, where they were 1-for-19 from 3-point range. 
"It's hard to swallow," said forward Ed O'Bannon, whose 24 points led the Bruins. "We were used to winning. But I think we're good enough and confident enough to bounce back." 
"They did what they had to do," UCLA coach Jim Harrick said. "We came back. We got to the mountain. We just couldn't get over it." 
UCLA, which scored just three points in the final 5:34, couldn't overcome Cal's defense and couldn't stop Kidd at the end. 
"He's their floor general on the court," forward Charles O'Bannon said. "He won the game for them. That's what you expect but you really have to key in on the rest of the guys." 
But UCLA couldn't stop the other guys either. Monty Buck· ley got loose for 23 points on 8· for-12 shooting and Lamond Murray added 21.

Buckley scored 11 of Cal's first 13 points of the second half, giving the Bears a 58-43 ad­vantage with 15:08 to play. UCLA outscored Cal 11-2 to cut its deficit to six points with 
11:22 remaining. 
A free throw by Tyus Edney got the Bruins within 64-63 with 7:36 remaining, but he missed one to tie it. 
Injuries have forced Cal coach Todd Bozeman to use eight different starting lineups this season, and although his team registered a 98-93 upset at then-No. 6 Arizona, the Bears have been inconsistent, losing to Santa Clara and Stanford. 
"Our guys feel we're on o the best teams on the West Coast," Bozeman said. "But we need to work hard at being consistent for 40 minutes. I you can do it now, it shows you can do it at any time." 
Cal used the zone to hold the Bruins to 40 percent shooting in the first half and built 29-16 lead on a 3-pointer by Anwar McQueen with 9:19 to go in the period. UCLA answered with a 10·0 run started by two con­secutive three-point plays by O'Bannon.

Hockey 
continued from page 16 Louder with a minute left in an attempt to tie the contest. Right after Louder got off the ice, Mike Knuble found the empty net. Notre Dame sliced the lead in half with 23 seconds left when Brent Larnrnpa tipped in a Tim Harberts drive. The 2-1 score was short­lived, though, as Michigan won the ensuing draw and Kevin Hilton filled the empty net. Still, the Irish were proud of their performance. 
"They're definitely improv­ing as team," said Michigan coach Red Berenson. "If the trend continues, the next game will be a hell of a game. This game and the crowd is a trib­ute to college hockey." 
The crowd he was referring to set a new regular season NCAA record for a college hockey game. In fact, the annual event was oversold by 500 tickets. 
If the Irish want to a fifth shot at Michigan they have to start to win some games. Next weekend, Notre Dame enter­tains Miami of Ohio for two games.

Notre Dame and was interested in corning here, but opted for Providence. 
Want to know why? "I wanted to play in a great league," said Croshere. 
Even Friars coach Rick Barnes admitted after the game that Notre Dame needs a con­ference and that the Big East would be a good choice. 
"Players want to play in a conference" said Barnes. "Notre Dame has a mystique about it, but its basketball has been hurt by a !ask of affiliation with a league." 
All of this discussion is pos­sible because the Big East is considering realignment in the near future. Many envision a bigger Big East with two divi­sions. 
In the first division for bas­ketball-only schools would be: Georgetown, Seton Hall, Con­necticut, St. John's, Providence, Villanova, Notre Dame and De­Paul. 
In the second division for all­
sports schools would be: Syra­
cuse, Boston College, Miami, 
Pittsburgh, West Virginia, 
Temple, Rutgers and Virginia 
Tech. 

If this happens, the Big East is the best choice for Notre Dame because five of the other schools in the division would be Catholic and because it would not require the commitment of any other sports. 
Barnes sees benefits to the addition of Notre Dame and DePaul to the Big East. 
"From the Big East stand­point, it would be great for the conference. They're two out­standing institutions. They have a lot in common with us," said Barnes. "It would make Notre Dame a top-five program." 
Additionally, it's no secret that the athletic department has its eye on the bottom line and that the money is in televi­sion. 
The extension of the NBC football contract which includes four horne basketball games a year indicates that the powers that be are interested in getting more television coverage. 
The Big East, as one of the country's premier conferences, has extensive television cover­age. On almost any weekend, it is hard not to find a Big East game on one of the three net­works or on ESPN. 
It is also important to consid­er that a horne conference game would practically guaran­tee a sell-out. 
Although there was a large 

Monday, January 31, 1994 
contingent of fans at the Provi­dence game, there were also a lot of empty seats. 
MacLeod says that, "My ulti­mate goal is to build our team into a consistent power and get the Joyce Center to the point where you can't get a ticket. I want to get that done and get that building rockin' and I'm not going to be satisfied until that happens." 
The student support was more vocal during the second half, but the noise wasn't deaf­ening. 
Now, if the game had meant moving up in the Big East con­ference standings, a few eardrums would have been damaged and the students would have left sounding like Marge Simpson's sisters. 
A depressing statistic for this year's senior class is that it is the first class to come through Notre Dame in over forty years that never went to the NCAA Tournament. Providence is 11­5 and should probably finish somewhere in the middle of the Big East standings. 
But, with a championship tournament at the end of the season, the Friars have a chance to represent the Big East at the NCAA Tournament while the Irish players and fans will be left to watch March Madness from South Bend.

It's deja vu as Dallas dumps Buffalo again 
Bumbling Bills set record for futility 
By DAVE GOLDBERG Associated Press 
ATLANTA 
The Dallas Cowboys are champions again and the Buffalo Bills are the undisputed kings of the Super Bowl flop. 
The Cowboys and the Bills both made Super Bowl history Sunday, thanks to two unlikely stars, James Washington and a redeemed Leon Lett. 
Washington, a backup safety, had a hand in 17 of Dallas' points as they beat the Bills 30-13 and won their second straight NFL title and sent Buffalo to a record fourth straight Super Bowl defeat. 

No franchise in the history of American team sports has lost the championship game four straight times. 
Emmitt Smith ran for 132 yards and two touchdowns as Dallas 'became the lOth straight NFC team to win the league's title game by outscoring the Bills 24-0 in the second half after trail­ing 13-6 at halftime. 
But it was Washington who turned the game around as the Cowboys became just the fifth team to win in con­secutive years and tied San Francisco and Pittsburgh with four Super Bowl victories. 
Washington returned a fumble 46 yards for a touchdown, intercepted a pass in the fourth quarter that led to another, and forced a first-half fumble that led to a field goal. Both fumbles were by Buffalo's star running back, Thurman Thomas, whose frustration seemed to symbolize the entire team's. 
Lett, who has had to endure two notorious gaffes, made the play that turned the game, stripping Thomas of the ball on the third play of the second half with Buffalo holding a 13-6 lead. 
Washington, whose interception led to Dallas' first touchdown in last year's 52-17 rout of Buffalo, picked it up and rambled in for the touchdown that tied the game, changed the momentum for­ever and guaranteed Buffalo its place in NFL history. 
Smith and the Dallas defense then took over. 
Smith rushed rushing for 61 of his yards on the next drive, scoring from 15 yards out to give Dallas a 20-13 lead. Lett, Charles Haley, Jim Jeffcoat and Darren Woodson, meanwhile, all made big defensive plays to shut down the Buffalo offense.

Earthquake shakes Cal-State Northridge 
Observer Staff Report 

Basketball just doesn't seem as important to the Cal-State Northridge basketball team anymore. 
Recovery is what matters now. 
Two weeks ago, while the team was in Boulder, Colo. preparing for a game against the University of Colorado, the Northridge campus saw some of the worst damage from the earthquake that ravaged south­ern California on Jan. 17. 
Fourteen people died when an apartment building col­lapsed just two blocks from the university and nearly $125 mil­lion in damage was done to the school's 58 buildings. 
The quake also shook the spirits of the team members, who are now more concerned with rebuilding than rebound­ing. 
Long-time coach Pete Cassidy had a particularly tough time in the wake of the disaster. 
"This was really hard on (Cassidy)," Northridge sports information director Barry Smith said. "His wife called him in Boulder about 4:30 in the morning, told him there had been an earthquake, and that she was trapped in their apart­ment. 
"He coached the game not knowing whether she was safe or not because nobody could

AUBURN HILLS, Mich. Toward the end of the game, the giant scoreboard at the 
r Palace flashed "LOUDER". The 20,427 fans responded and cheered wildly. Since the crowd favored Michigan, the noise was in recognition of another victory. But Notre Dame supporters may have thought of it as ap­preciation for the performance of Louder, as in Greg, the Notre Dame goalie who kept the ex­plosive Wolverine offense off the scoreboard for more than 53 minutes. Despite Louder's brilliant ef­fort, the Irish dropped a 3-1 decision to No. 1 Michigan. The score is not indicative of the game, which included two empty net goals in the final minute. 
"It was a great effort all around," said Irish coach Ric Schafer. "It should have cul­minated in victory." 
Michigan sniper David Oliver disagreed. 
With 6:36 remaining in the game, and Michigan on a power play, the senior notched his 1 OOth career goal, beating Louder with a blast from the top of the left circle to put the Wolverines ahead 1-0. 
"We did a great job of penal­ty-killing," noted Schafer. "It was just a perfect shot in the left corner that no one was going to save." 
Notre Dame still had a hand­ful of quality chances to tie the game but Wolverine netminder Steve Shields, who holds the NCAA record for wins, was just as sensational as usual. He denied bid after bid, including shots by John Rushin and Da­vide DalGrande. 
Shields, along with Louder, was spectacular throughout, especially in the second period, when the Irish fired 24. Not one found the back of the net. 
"He's hard to get the puck by," stated Schafer matter-of­factly. "We think he's unortho­dox, but he is tough." 
At even strength, the Irish were just as tough. As talented and fast as the Michigan skaters were, Notre Dame's players were every bit as smart and hard-working. 
The Irish frustrated numer­ous Michigan rushes with pa­tient; strong-checking defense. In particular, Matt Osiecki, Garry Gruber, and Bryan Welch all played the body well. 
~hat they did let by, Louder was there to stop. 
"He just played a fantastic game," said Gruber. "It's a lot easier to play in front of some­one who you have a lot of confi­dence in. When they did get opportunities, he was there to make the save.'' 
Despite the team's efforts, the Irish were forced to pull
