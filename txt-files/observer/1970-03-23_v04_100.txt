Kunstler sees 70's as decade of resistance 
Eight turn in draft cards 
The Notre Dame Resistance last week increased its membership to eighteen persons, including those that renounced their draft cards last November. Six of the new me mhers are presently Notre Dame students, two are persons visiting the Notre Dame community, and three are dropouts from the University. 
The statement signed by all of the resisters says: "To carry a draft card today is to render homage to a murderous system. We can no longer cooperate with a system which makes objects of men and which deepens the exploitation of the poor and the blacks in American by sending them first to fight a war against the Vietnamest poor. we refuse any claim to privilege under such a system, whether it be that of student, wo­
man, father, or veteran. We wish country as a Maryknoll mission­

In his opening remarks he portrayed 
the city of Chicago as a figure for the 

mood of hatred and fear that he feels is . 
now the greatest obstacle to social change 
in the United States. 
"Chicago has become a way of life," 
Kunstler said. "What happened two years 
ago during the Democratic Convention 
crystallized for many of us its image as a 
microcosm of life in the 70's. The 
conspiracy trial signalled the end of one 
era and the beginning of another. It had a 
life and viatality of its own, and it still 
has it though the thunder of the 
courtroom has moved over into the 
appellate stage." 
Kunstler outlined some of the specific 
details that had led to the charging of 
eight members of the New Left with 
conspiracy involving actions taking place 
at the time of the 1968 Convention. He 
broadly described the history of the law 
that had led to the trial, declaring that 
the so-called Anti-Riot Act had been 
passed in Congress as part of a deal to 
support the Civil Rights Act. Kunstler 
said the Jaw had been formed in reaction 
to the ghetto riots that had followed the 
assasination of Martin Luther King and 
was part of an effort to obtain some legal 
means to deter the demonstrations 
scheduled to take place in Chicago. 
In explaining the events as they took 
place at the convention, Kunstler pointed 
out that the efforts of the demonstrators. 
to secure permits and accomodationf 
were denied by Chicago's Mayor Richard 
D;~ley. He accused Chicago officials of 
refusing priveleges to the demonstrators 
that had always been granted to other 
groups, such as the boy scouts, including 
the right to meet and sleep in the park. 
"As we all saw, the convention ended 
with the world watching the use of police 
force to curb dissent in the streets of 
Chicago," Kunstler said. "That scene has 
left scars on everyone's memory." 
Kunstler noted the command of then Attorney General Ramsey Clark to Chicago officials not to conduct any grand jury investigations under the Anti-Riot Law since the law was of doubtful constitutionality. He said Clark's orders were ignored by Justice William Campbell who instructed a grand 
jury, which Kunstler said Campbell called "my jury", to investigate and return indictments purposely excluding Clark from any access to the reports. Kunstler accused Daley of attempting to "wash the city's dirty linen" with a trial that would make the demonstrators look like "a 
bunch of hoodlums." 
"He proved himself to be a frightened 
man of yesterday trying to explain today 
in yesterday's terms," Kunstler said of 
Daley. "For people like these, the past is 
always more comfortable than the 
contemplation of an uncertain future." 
Kunstler said the eight demonstration 
leaders had been carefully chosen because 
they represented the best possible 
cross-section of the dissent movement, 
the young and the middle aged, the 
academic and the yippie, the SDS and the 
Black Panthers. 
He explained that the men had entered 
the trial with three thoughts in mind, 
rebutting the government's case, 
presenting the reasons for coming to 
Chicago, and attempting to show who the 
defendents were, what they stood for, 
and what they thought. 
"We were confronted with a judge with 
a rigid authoritarian personality, one who 
could not be impartial towards the 
defendents because he hated, detested 
and feared them. The disruptions that 
occurred were not part of a movement

To restrict 

Alumni entry 
by Cliff Wintrode and Jim Holsinger 
Alumni Hall residents at a h<.~ll meeting 
Saturday night decided to deny all 
visitors entrance to the hall on weekends 
unless as a guest of a hall resident. The 
move was made to prevent a repeat of 
Friday night's fight between hall 
residents, their friends, and black people 
from town. 
Immediately after the meeting two of 
the three doors to Alumni were locked 
and at least one security guard was posted 
inside the other door with instructions to 
check I D's and grant entrance only to hall 
members. When a guest came inside, a 
hall resident had to come to the door to 
meet him. 
The fight in Alumni Friday night began when football player Bill Barz, standing in the hallway by his room, was sucker punched in the face by a young black from town. · 
Barz, along with some of his friends who were standing by him, a moment earlier had been talking to a group of blacks among whom was the guy who hit him. 
Barz wrestled his attacker to the floor and was grabbed by friends of the black. At this point, the friends of Barz joined in the fight. 
The actual punching lasted for only about half a minute for almost immediately other people in the hall attracted by the noise successfully separated the blacks and the whites. 
The same restrictions will ·:certa_inly" be in effect the first weekend back Easter vacation, but beyond that "It is impossible to put a time limit on how long they will be in effect," said Alumni HaJI president Tom Schaefer. 
"The situation dictated immediate action to stop a reoccurrence of Friday night. This is something we need as immediate security," said Schaefer. 
"I think the hall generally is 100% behind the restrictions. They find them an inconvenience, but they realize it is a necessary inconvenience," added Schaefer. 
Schaefer said that there were no

A capacity-plus crowd of over 3,500 people filled Notre Dame's Stepan Center yesterday afternoon to hear William M. Kunstler, defense lawyer for the "Chicago Seven" lecture on the effects of the events surrounding the Chicago Conspiracy trial. Kunstler said the trial had sy mholized a transition in eras for the forces of dissent in America, ushering in an era of "resistance" to replace the era of "prot~st" that had characterized the 60's. 
Kunstler's appearance on the stage at Stepan was greeted by a standing ovation from the audience which lined the aisles and back of the room as well as filling all the seats on the floor. He acknowledged his longtime desire to see Notre Dame and speak to its students.

Cronin hits loss of Catholicism 
by Rich Smith 
"Although it cannot be proved statistically, there has been a definite loss of the Cath­olic spirit at Notre D;o~me." 
With those words, Dr. Edward Cronin, 1938 graduate of Notre Dame, inember of last year's Curriculum Revision Committee, and professor in the General Program of Liberal Arts, expres­sed his feelings concerning the current state of this community. 
Dr. Cronin cited the removal of the crucifix from classroom walls and the demise of class­room prayers as indicative of the decline of the University's Cath­olicism. 
Dr. Cronin said that he does not advocate a return to the Notre Dame of thirty-five years ago, but he stressed the import­ance of "being different from a school named after an Indian tribe or an oil baron." 
While emphasizing the fact that he did not desire a faculty that was all Catholic, Dr. Cronin said, "It makes a difference for the student if he's never said a prayer. It makes a difference for the student to see someone inside and, more importantly, outside the classroom who has a certain commitment in life." 
When asked about the rele­vance of a Catholic education in a non-Catholic world, Dr. Cronin cited the example of a person joining a labor union and later discovering that it was Commun­ist-backed. 
"Do you stay or leave? I say you stay with it and try to influence it. Sure the world isn't Catholic. It isn't even religious. But you can influence it. Yes, I think that the Catholic univer­sity can prepare a person for the world."

Postal talks may begin 
WASHINGTON (UPI) -The federal government, citing in­creasing reports of dissident mailmen returning to work, yesterday agreed to discuss the issues in the dispute with the seven postal unions if encough strikers are back on the job today. 
The announcement by Labor Secretary George P. Shultz was an apparent compromise of earlier government demands that no negotiations will be held until the men are back to work. 
Shultz said he would meet with the union leaders today "on the assumption that people will be back to work" but would not discuss the issues unless enough of the workers were back on the job and postal service restored. 
Although several large cities reported mailmen returning to work, still others voted yester­day to join the mailmen's strike. They did so in the face of a threat that federal troops would replace them. 
Maj. Gen. W. P. Wilson, head of the National Guard bureau, said he was prepared to get his guardsmen mobilized within 24 hours after receiving word from President Nixon to do so. Nixon, who canceled a weekend vaca­tion to watch developments from the White House, had hinted Saturday he would call in the troops if the strike lingered. 
Some postal clerks in Chicago, the largest U.S. mail center and a key to nationwide shutdown, and in Pittsburgh, returned to work yesterday, but the letter carriers stayed away. Letter carriers voted in Madison, Wis., Atlantic City, Camden and Tren­ton, N.J., and Royal Oak, Mich., to return to work, but their counterparts in other cities, such

as Philadelphia, Detroit and Brooklyn, voted to continue . their wildcat strike. They were 
joined by mailmen in Worcester, Mass., and Council Bluffs, Iowa. 
Mailmen in Louisville, Ky., Omaha and Baltimore voted yesterday not to strike, while other major cities scheduled votes for today. 
James H. Rademacher, presi­dent of the National Association of Letter Carriers, the main union in the walkouts, said yesterday postal workers were expected to return to work Monday in Scranton, Pa., Car­bondale, Ill., Las Vegas Nev., Houston, Tex., and Boulder and Colorado Springs, Colo. 
Citing these examples, Rade­macher said he expected "an almost complete return to work by Tuesday morning." 
The administration has insis­ted it has no voice in the matter of wages, since only Congress can grant pay increases. Senate Democratic leader Mike Mans­field said yesterday "we'll forego our Easter recess if we have to" to enact special legislation. The wildcat walkouts, which began Wednesday, already were show­ing their effects on the business and financial community where layoffs were threatened at some firms and others took steps to make deliveries without the mails. 
Rademacher said after the 90 minute meeting with Shultz yesterday that "certain subver­sive elements," particularly the Students for a Democratic Soci­ety, were the cause of the New York members voting for the first postal strike in U.S. history. 
"Last year members of the SDS took postal examinations 
and have entered the postal 

service," Rademacher said.

GSU discusses SLC, pay cafeteria

The Graduate Student Union debated Friday what action it would take regarding Student Life Council Seats and Cafeteria prices. 
After members of the G.S.U. requested membership on the S.L.C., the latter offered the graduates four non-voting seats. 
The reaction of the member­ship at Friday's meeting was divided into roughly three camps. Some favored accepting the proposal of the Council to send four members to the meet­ings to decide whether to ask for permanent seating, while others took a "thanks, but no thanks" attitude. A final group suggested that if the graduate students do not get voting representation, then they will declare themselves independent of any rules set by similar research on this matter last year ran into similar difficul­ties and found that one of the reasons for the high cost in the pay cafeteria was to make up for the waste caused by those who eat in the dining halls. 
Delegates also requested that the study be extended by asking that people in the restaurant

what  they  thought  about  the  
reasonability of figures.  

Copies of the report are avail­able for those who are interest­ed. 
In other business, the G.S.U. voted overwhelmingly to invite members of the faculty senate to join them at meetings with full speaking rights. 
Ed Isley is working on a study of the library with emphasis on the assignment of carrels. He pointed out that if any of the graduates have other complaints about the library facilities or services, they should contact him. 
Upcoming G.S.U. activities will feature a party on March 25 at the Issac Walton league and possible volleyball and softball leagues if someone can be found to run them. 
April .7 has been set as the date for a special meeting to consider and vote on the consti­tution. The next two regular meetings have been shifted to the meeting room at LaFortune Center due to the unavailability of the library auditorium.

George' "Buz" Craven ~~:[~.. Schmidt and Jim DeSapio. They will discuss cam­paign expenditures, poster sizes, and other various aspects of the election. 
A current bill before the Senate con<.:erning elections is the proposal to declare second semester Seniors ineligible to vote. This bill, written by Joseph Tigani of Fisher, and co-sponsor­ed by Thomas McDermott, would take away the vote from students who don't really have a stake in the Student Govern­ment. This would cover the Student Body President elec­tions and the Student Life Council elections, but not the Senate elections because they are held in the fall. The next item to come before the Senate was on the matter of Constitutional Revisions. Donald Mooney suggested that a com­mittee be formed to revise or rewrite the present Constitution. This committee would be made up of the new SBP, the SBVP, the new Stay senators, and members of the Hall Presidents council equal to the number of Stay Senators. The prime consi­deration of the Constitutional Revisions Committee would be Dave Krashna's proposal to abolish the Student Senate. The

With regard to the pay cafe· teria, Joe Marchese, who has researched the <.:osts and quality of the food for four and a half months, gave his report. 
Among the difficulties he en­countered was the fact that the management of the food services would not permit him to see the books on the financial opera· tions. Thus all of his figures are based only on the costs of the food to the cafeteria and the prices charged. Marchese admits that there might be justification for the high mark-ups, but says that it is impossible to find out unless he can have access to the costs for labor and overhead. He did, however, take shrinkage and the like into account. 
Among the highest mark-ups which he mentioned were lJ70'% for beets, 7':JO'Yr· for peaches, 340% for pork sandwiches and cod and 300')!. for apple juice. For example, he calculated that a class of this last wmmodity

the Age of Resistance? 
There are strange inconsistencies in William Kunstler's ideas about America-past, present and future-or at least in his rhetoric. 
Kuntsler claims that America is entering the decade of "resistance." Indeed it appears we are. People trust their government less and Jess or at least, are lead to believe that they should. The dissent of the 60's Kunstler states, just hasn't worked. War hasn't· ended, racism still exists and people are still starving. Dissent hasn't worked-resistance is the answer. 
It is that call which seems inconsistant-at least in the light of one of his opening remarks yesterday. Lawyer Kunstler said that he and the Chicago Seven defendants believed in the "system" ana that they had nothing to replace it with. What then indeed is the purpose 
of this new "decade of resistence". tf people believe in democracy then the watch word should be parti_cipation, not resistance. Participation in a democracy suggests a conftdence in the built in checks and balances of the system. Kuntsler argues that he, the other lawyers and the defendants in the ~hicago trial used outlandish and abusive language in reaction to a Judge that was u~fai~, prejudiced and not fulfilling his obligations ~nder the constitution. There is an appelate process which is mtended to consider those accusations. To argue that the defendants ~er~ l~ft wit~ no choice but to call the judge a "facist pig", to restst doesn t say much about belief in the court system. Peo~le who claim t~at they believe in democracy and yet who call for resistance are actmg more out of emotion than out of reason. Young people concerned that the war in Vietnam continues without a clear ~nd in sight smash windows or bum a bank as a sign of their frustration and for their "resistance to a government that won't end the_ tvar. Sei_zing buildings, burning banks, and calling judges and pohce~en ptgs and facists doesn't end wars, racism, or poverty. More tmp<:'rtantly such action doesn't help in bringing about understandmg or true peace-that peace which exists in the hearts of men who respect each other's opinions, freedom and integrity. No system of government is perfect and none will ever eradicate all ~he evils _that exist. The important thing is that the people in any soctety contmue to work for all that needs to be done. T~is country has at its disposal the potential to radically change the lives of all men of the world. It possesses knowledge and skills unparalleled in the history of mankind. America's most valuable asset however is it's spirit; its belief in the freedom and integrity of all men; its belief in justice. It is that concern, that spirit which is mirrored in the words of Kuntsler and men like him. It is that spirit too that makes Americans take note of his words and consider them. People have to begin to admit that fact. Dissent and forceful, vocal objection to the policy of our government ·are needed to assure that a governme)lt continues to work for the right goals. But calling for resistance to a government is quite a different thing. Overturning a school bus full of blacks in the South is an act of resistance that no one should condone. Can burning a bank for the opposite idiology be more tolerable? 
For this country to survive and to eradicate evil, and to provide freedom and justice people must continue to believe in democracy and the American commitment to work for improvement. 
Americans should guide their every action by that spirit. Whether William Kunt~ler likes to admit it or not, calling for resistance is a another step toward tearing America apart.

Yes, I know it's been quite a while, but you can't expect perfect service on the carry downs. 
Dave Lammers 
the Age of Impotence ? 
William Kunstler's account of the Chicago trial leads one to believe that the conspirators were John Mitchell, Thomas Foran, Judge Julius Hoffman, Mayor Daley, with the Southern Senators, the FBI, and the Chicago police acting as co-conspirators. 
The conspiracy law, we find, was a rider attached to the Martin Luther King Memorial civil Rights Act as a concession to the Southern Congressmen. Ramsey Clark, we are told, viewed the bill as unconstitutional and wanted indictments against the police and city officials rather than against any demonstrators. Clark even warned that if the Nixon Administration used the anti-riot act against Chicago demonsjrators, "It would be a clear sign that a crackdown was on its way." 
The crackdown came. Judge Hoffman was able to employ the immense powe_r of the state in what a Harvard Law School Professor called "an outrage unparalleled in American judicial history." The purpose of the efforts of the federal government was clearly to intimidate, to frighten, to terrorize, to use "preventive detention". As Deputy Attorney Gene"ral Richard Kleinstadt said: "I think if you could get all of them in the penitentiary you'd stop it. The ringleaders, I'm talking about." · 
Thus, the Jaw becomes not an instrument. of justice, but an instrument of terror. Phones are tapped, undercover agents are employed extensively, a conspiracy of New Left leaders -some of whom had not even met before the trial -is created, a prejudiced judge is employed, all of which is directed by the Justice Department. 
The jury of peers, which is intended to act as a check against such perversions of the trial system, was allowed to gain no perspective of the case. They were confused and uninformed about the true nature of the case, and their compromise decision reflected this failure. 
When the police and the law become instruments of terror for the purpose of repressing dissent, as they did in Chicago, law and order become a mere facade. Instead of being a means of resolving controversy, of deciding between conflicting interests, the powers of the state were used in Chicago as weapons against the potent force of New Left dissent. The authority, strength, and power of the court was used by the Nixon Administration as an attempt to dissolve its most vocal radical opponents. 
When terror is substituted for the true power of the state, when the Jaw become an instrument of violence against one group rather than a means of resolving human conflicts. the state has become 
impo.tent. When the state has lost its ability to effect the necess·ary changes that the members of the state require, the state has become impotent, it has lost its power, and it must resort to violence and massive untruths to retain its position. This takes for granted that a good state derives its power from the ability to effect social change, rather than through its ability to inflict punishment through the police or the penal system. 
In Chicago, the demonstrators were protesting a system which they judged to be impotent. They were protesting many things: the control of the electoral process by the Democratic party elite, the war, the inequality of wealth, the inequality of the races. 
We can each judge whether meaningful social change is being affected. We can each decide if the school system is progressing or disintegrating, if racism is being dealt with or preserved, if militarism is being fought or encouraged, if the poor are being helped or are remaining in squalor. 
If we are moving toward disaster, the rage of those that demand social change and do not see it will increase. If the state has become so large and so bureaucratized that it is unable to answer its dissenters, then trials such as Chicago will become commonplace, bombings will increase, the public officers will resort to terror and untruths on a wider scale. 
In the government must imprison its dissenters through Stalin-like terror tactics, then impotence has become dominant and violence has replaced the true power of the state. Let us hope that the state. will soon recognize that its power to affect social change does not depend on its ability to inflict violence on its dissenters.

parts. 

l was so pleased though with the way Bob Moore put it all together. We worked on it together throughout. I came to New York and was living in his apartment and he was an old friend. We had talked so much about the play before it was ever written and he was working in "Cactus Flower" and l was living in California, he took his vacation and came out there and spent a week. We used to drink a lot and stay up very late and talk about the state of the theatre and playwrighting in gen­eral and I told him about the play. He said, "I think the time is very right for it but you better do it quick because somebody else will," ahd then I remem­ber somebody asked me after I wrote the play why I did it and I said, "To beat the British". It seemed to me that it was going to come from England any minute. 
I just got it under the wire. 
"Staircase" had just come out and when I heard about "Fortune and Men's Eyes", I had a heart attack. l was already going around with the script of The Boys in the Band under my arm. I remember when I first came back to New York the first two plays I went to see ~ere "Fortune and Men's Eyes" and "The Birthday Party" was about but I just hoped that it didn't spoil the birthday event. As a matter of fact, that was one of the earlier ideas for a title but then I couldn't use it. I later found out that what I was afraid was going to happen to my play unfortunately my play did to 
some other people's plays. Arthur Law­rence had written a play which The Boys in the Band at least arrested for a few minutes but the play is now going to get done and I have spoken to Arthur since and he says that he has re-investigated his

drive down there on Friday nights and have dinner with him-and he was very, very hip to the literary scene. I used to take his judgement about most every­thing. I would read the play aloud to him-the scenes I had written-and when I told him the title he said it was just a terrible title. He always kept urging me to change the title and I had some other alternates but I never changed it.
