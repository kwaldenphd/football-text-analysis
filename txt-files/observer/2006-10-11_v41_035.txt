ND renews effort to attract faculty 
Jenkins builds on predecessors' tradition, creates office for recruiting Catholic profs 
By KAITLYNN RIELY 
News Writers 
Editor's Note: This is the sec­ond story in a three-part series examining the role of Catholic faculty at Notre Dame. 
While University President Father John Jenkins announced two weeks ago the creation of a new office to recruit Catholic fac­ulty members, that drive is noth­ing new to a school so deeply rooted in its religious identity. 
Aftpr all, when Father Edward Sorin founded Notrfl Dame more than 150 years ago, he dreamed it would become a great American Catholic university. 
So this year's more aggressive approach to bumping up the continually slipping percentage of faculty members who are Catholic -now just under 54 percent -is not a redefinition, but a "re-articulation" of the goals of the University, said Vice President and Associate Provost Jean Ann Unney. 
"Across the University there is attention now -but it's not that it wasn't there in the past -but more heightened [attention] per­haps, as to who we're hiring and whether they are Catholic or not," Unney said. 
That attention was certainly present during the tenure of University President Emeritus Father Edward Malloy, who was involved in crafting a part of Notre Dame's mission statement

'Gay? Fine by llle' shirts sprinkle calllpus 
By MARY KATE MALONE 
News Editor 
"Gay" might be fine by the stu­dents and faculty sporting bright orange shirts today, but more than two years after the "Gay? Fine by me" slogan first flooded campus, homosexual student groups are still not officially rec­ognized by the University -a fact that troubles gay activists both inside and outside Notre Dame. 
The first "Gay? Fine by me" T­shirt day was organized by then­senior Joe Dickmann in March 2004 to dispute a Princeton Review ranking that put Notre Dame at the top of the "Alternative Lifestyles not an Alternative" list. He wanted to prove that Notre Dame students were "gay-friendly," and he hoped the shirts would push the University to rethink its stance on gay and lesbian student groups. 

The 2,400 orange shirts dotting campus that day brought national media attention in what history professor Gail Bederman called a "breathtaking" example of stu­dent acceptance. 
Dickmann graduated two months later, but he said Tuesday from St. Louis that more work must be done. The shirts might have made students realize "there were allies on campus," but its statement has failed to penetrate the University's policy of not recognizing gay and lesbian student organizations, he said.

Buying groceries can be an annoyance for many Notre Dame students, especially those without access to a car. But because of the limited selection at the Huddle Mart, off-campus store runs are often necessary. Now, three business students hope to capitalize on these inconven­iences with a service that will deliver groceries directly to dorm rooms. 
Domer Delivery is a stu­dent-run business that pur­chases grocery and house­hold items -and just about anything else someone might want -from retail stores and delivers them to a stu­dent's dorm room for a small fee. Founded by senior Clint Gille, senior Mike Sciortino and junior Nick Zehrbach, the service receives orders for retail goods from Notre Dame and St. Mary's students online at www.domerdeliv­ery.com. 
The students founded the business as a project for their Introduction to Entrepre­neurship class with a $40 startup loan from their pro­fessor. The goal of the assign­ment, called 'The $25 Challenge,' is to make 1,000 percent of the startup cost as profit by Thanksgiving. The $25 Challenge is the same assignment that produced the "Charlie's Army" T-shirts last

Donations break$180 111illion 
Total for 2006 fiscal year hits record high 
By KATE ANTONACCI News Editor 
Notre Dame benefactors went above and beyond in the 2006 fiscal year and the University has the numbers -a record-high $180.7 mil­lion to be exact-to prove it, officials announced Monday. 
The amount is the highest the University has ever received in cash contribu­tions from alumni. parents and friends of Notre Dame, not including account pledges of future gifts, according to a University press release. 
"This record year in fund raising is tangible evidence of the enthusiasm in the Notre Dame family for the bold vision of our new presi­dent, Father John Jenkins. Indeed, Notre Dame benefac­tors are our co-creators in this venture, advancing the mission and tradition of the University in exceptional and exciting ways." said Lou Nanni, vice president for University Relations. 
The previous high of $173.7 million in 2004 was set largely due to the $50 million donation from the estate of Joan Kroc, the largest single contribution in the University's history.

Catastrophic co111puter crash 
Like many people today, I feel like I spend my life at a computer. Probably because I do, and I think it's starting to catch up with me. 
It all started to go downhill last year. I was sitting in my 
Laura Baumgartner
room on a 
warm and sunny after­News Writer noon enjoy­ing the breeze drifting in through my open window. I had just finished typing a paper and proofreading. I was ready to print. 
Disaster. 
My printer would not print. 
Fifteen minutes later I had unplugged, plugged-in, shut-down, restarted, jiggled and wiggled my way into a frenzy. The stupid hunk of plas­tic was obviously not going to fulfill its one purpose of existence. 
I thought to myself, well I'll just e­mail it and print it out at the library later. I had more important things to attend to at the time. I had new pho­tos from the weekend rotting on my digital camera, and they needed to be uploaded STAT. 
Catastrophe. 
Turns out my USB ports were on a level 5 meltdown. No printing. No uploading. 
One year later, I have learned to live without. 
The printer was one less thing to pack. I'm saving money on ink and paper, and I can make a quick stop at Walgreen's to have my photos put on a CD for about two dollars. Overall, my programs were still functioning, and at least my hard drive hadn't crashed. 
My computer and I were at peace. 
Until today that is. 
Today, I come home from class and sit down to check my e-mail. I gently . push the power button to wake my machine from sleep mode and am greeted by the most horrendous sound I have ever heard. 
My computer sounds like a garbage disposal with a spoon stuck in it inter­mingled with almost peaceful moments of a high-pitched whine somewhat similar to a table saw rip­ping through a two-by-four. 
Apocalypse. 
Approaching its fourth birthday my PC is well beyond the years of war­ranty coverage, and I am almost cer­tain all signs of functioning are about to cease. 
As I sit here and compose what could be my last Word document on the old boy, I can not help but remem­ber the good times. There were the late nights at the library, the warm sunny days by the lake or on the quad (noise update: it now sounds like a percolating-coffee-pot-and-shoelace­stuck-in-a-vacuum-cleaner hybrid) ... I can still remember when I brought him home from Best Buy. 
Maybe a little well-deserved rest will help him. Forget sleep mode, I need a button for drug-induced coma mode.

Donnelly visits Saint Mary's as race intensifies 
By KELLY MEEHAN Saint Mary's Editor 
When double Domer Joe Donnelly spoke to a crowd of 40 in Carroll Auditorium Tuesday night, he admitted it was not his first time on Saint Mary's campus. 
"The chance to speak with you is very special," he said. "While I was at Notre Dame I took some classes here, dined here [often] and was turned down by Saint Mary's girls many times." 
The Democratic candidate in the race for Indiana's Second Congressional District put jok­ing aside, however, to address voters' concerns about Iraq, foreign trade and the national budget. 
Donnelly visited the College in an effort to increase political activism and discuss his intense congressional race against current Republican Congressman Chris Chocola. Recent polls show Donnelly ahead of Chocola by approxi­mately 10 points, but Donnelly lost the 2004 race to Chocola 55 percent to 45 percent. 
Despite the disappointing loss just two years ago, the 2006 Congressional elections have a new spin, Donnelly said. 
The New York Times referred to the Second District as "ground zero" -a micro­cosm of all that needs to be improved in America, Donnelly said. 
"This is your country," he 
said. "You are going to shape and mold it through your votes. I hope to go to Congress and make this a better place for you." 
Donnelly said his race has received national attention because the party that wins is likely to control the House of Representatives, stressing that it is possible to "change the world right here in northern Indiana." 
He said the foreign reloca­tion of jobs has hit the Indiana economy hard, taking away

"The current leadership in Washington has not carried the ball and has let [the troops] down in making them success­ful." 
Donnelly asked how Washington leadership could be so unprepared for the cre­ation of success within Iraq. Not only are America's troops dying, but "there are a huge amount of Iraqis with no elec­tricity, water, or refrigera­

"Two counties from here are building the largest bio-diesel plant in the world.... [It] will put money in the pockets of 
U.S. farmers and make the economy more secure," he said. 
As students' concerns grow over the wartime situation in Iraq, Donnelly said the solution is to "stabilize the country." "[The War in Iraq] is an extraordinarily difficult situa­tion," he said. "It is easy to them," he said. 
Donnelly said he was concerned that Chocola votes in agreement with President Bush 95 per­cent of the time. 
"[Congressmen] need to ask tough questions," he said. 
"Where are weapons of mass destruction? ... Where is Al Qaeda? ... If we leave tomor­row I think that Iraq will become even more chaotic and disastrous ... We need to have Iraqi troops become more suc­cessful. 
"[We need to ask], what is the exact plan? We cannot drift along forever," he said. 

Donnelly also said he feared the $9 trillion national deficit is running dangerously high. 
"You are going to be making the decisions for your genera­tion and the people behind you," he said. "We are running up bills you have to pay. You have to step up and say, 'Enough."' 
Donnelly concluded his dis­cussion by fielding questions from the audience, who among other national interests was fixated by the campaign com­mercials Chocola aired against his competitor. 
Chocola has run slanderous ads against him for the past five months, Donnelly said. Donnelly's campaign, however, did not earn enough money to counter the commercials until September. 
When asked why he ran a counter-attack, Donnelly said if he doesn't, people will believe Chocola's ads. · 
Donnelly finished his talk by focusing on domestic and glob­al concerns. 
"Do want to fix Darfur? ... Do you want to fix Iraq? ... If so, elect a new Congress to make America the shining city on the hill you heard of. How do you do this? Start right here. 
"We can bring change," he said. "Change can begin with you. You are in a magical place for this congressional elec­tion."

At a time when nuclear threats from North Korea and Iran have the world on edge, 17 Notre Dame students will spend their fall break in Europe meeting with leaders of organizations committed to con­trolling the proliferation of nuclear arms and other weapons of mass destruction (WMD). 
The students are enrolled in a new seminar titled "(Non-) Proliferation of WMD," taught by political scientist Luc Reydams, who will lead the European field trip. 
Among the officials with whom they will meet is Ambassador Greg Schulte, the permanent U.S. representative to the International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations office in Vienna, and other international organizations in Vienna. He is responsible for advancing U.S. policies regarding proliferation, terrorism, organized crime and corruption, while pro­moting the peaceful use of nuclear energy. 
The Notre Dame students also will meet with officials at the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, Swedish Peace and Arbitration Society, Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons at The Hague, and Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty Organization in Vienna.

Beloved SMC duck duo vanishes 
Community suspects foul play; online forum searches for answers 
By COURTNEY BALL News Writer 
The recent disappearance of Saint Mary's most beloved duck duo has watchers fearing the worst, and disturbed students have begun to investigate the mystery. 
The popular duck pair goes by the names of Bonnie and Clyde or LaFawnduh and Kip, depending on whom you ask. Despite dis­agreement over what the famous duck pair should be called, every­one who saw them agreed that the two were inseparable. 
"They were together all of the time every day, walking side by side, and it was really cute," said Saint Mary's junior Andrea Moon. 
The faculty also took notice of the duo. Janet Flahaven, the assistant director of marketing at Saint Mary's, was one of its regu­lar watchers. 

"They were very social," she said. "They would waddle on up to people and look for food. They were part ofthe campus." 
However, early on a Sunday afternoon in September, the female duck went missing. The sight of the male duck swimming all alone concerned many stu-

ronment to be a place where gays come on purpose instead of by accident," Dickmann said. "I want the shirt program to be even big­ger and I want it run by an official club sanctioned by Student Activities." 
Despite Dickmann's sentiments, this year's "Gay? Fine by me" shirt organizers are striving for student awareness and acceptance, not necessarily University policy changes. 
Stacey Williams is leading the project this year -ordering about 200 orange T-shirts for today (though there is a "stockpile" of leftover shirts from previous years as well). The goal of the shirts is not to change minds, but to raise awareness that gay students are not alone, said AllianceND presi­dent Aine Richards. 
"I think there's a large group of students here that are welcoming and accepting and ifyou find those students, .it can be a very great place to be," Richards said. 
But she noted that many AllianceND members wearing the shirts today are hoping their efforts won't go unnoticed by the Office of Student Affairs. 
The Observer could not reach Assistant Vice President for Student Affairs SL<>ter Susan Dunn for comment Tuesday. Dunn is co­chair of the Core Council for Gay and Lesbian Students, a 12-mem­ber group of faculty, staff, adminis­trators and students that advises Vice President of Student Affairs Father Mark Poorman about gay and lesbian student needs. 
Dickmann agrees that the stu­dent body is generally accepting of gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, queer and questioning students but there is a disconnect, he said, between students and the University's administration. The University's policy r,asts a shadow over the progress that has been made so far on r,ampus, he said. 
"The word 'gay' itself is so taboo at Notre Dame's r,ampus and the administration evokes that by not allowing a gay student group," said Dickmann, who currently dents and faculty alike. 
"I saw the little brown and white one wandering aimlessly and quacking," said Moon, who began an online forum to investi­gate the disappearance. "I think he was trying to call out for the black duck. He did it all day. He just seemed lost." 
The forum received numerous responses from people wanting to know what had happened to the female duck and expressing their regret at the pair's separa­tion. 
"As much as I like seeing them together, it is even more heart­breaking to see him all alone," Moon said. "I would rather them both be taken." 
"We all just want them to be reunited," Flahaven said. 
Students have many theories on what happened to the missing mallard. Some believe she died or simply flew away. Saint Mary's freshman Carly O'Connor has another idea. 
"Last Friday I was sitting by the lake and noticed there was a new duck in town ... I think he kicked her out and replaced her with the mallard, because I saw them swimming together," she said. 
Soon after the female went, the male duck also disappeared. The most popular explanation is that someone from Security or Building Services caught the duck to take care of it over the winter. 
"Someone with a red truck came in mid-afternoon one Sunday and had the black duck caged in the back," said Angie Yates, assistant administrator in Marketing at Saint Mary's. "We assumed it was Building Services or Security. However, we called and both stated they had no involvement." 
A post in the Saint Mary's forum indicated that Officer Derrick Chambliss with the Security Department had taken the ducks to his farm. However, Chambliss denies any involve­ment. 
"I do not even own a farm," he said. 
No satisfactory explanation for the missing ducks has yet sur­faced. Wherever they have gone to, students and faculty are most concerned that they remain together. 
"I hated to see them separat­ed," Yates said. "I called them the dynamic duo."

Saint Mary's closes its only pool indefinitely 
serves on the Board of Directors for Fine by Me, Inc., a non-profit company that trademarked the "Gay? Fine by me" logo and has distributed 60,000 of the T-shirts to colleges, businesses and small communities since January 2005. 
"Particularly in a conservative community, people are often sur­prised with how many others agree with them," said Lucas Schaefer, Fine by Me's executive director. "The program can be empowering in terms of showing that support you have. 
"I think [the T-shirt] r,an start to move a campus in a different direction and it certainly sends a signal to the people who make pol­icy that homophobia is not tolerat­ed by a huge percentage of the campus." 
Bederman has witnessed that movement. She recalled teaching a history dass about 15 years ago examining gender in the Unitfld States since 1942. When she tried to devote one class to examining gay life during the time period, she found her students speechless. She asked if they had done the read­ing. 
"They said 'Oh no, professor, we did the reading. But we've never talked about homosexuality in public before and we just don't know what to say."' 
Bederman said shfl "can't imag­ine" Notre Dame students in 2006 feeling the way her students did in the early 90s. That's progress that can be partly attributed to the T­shirts, she said. 
"The shirt does a lot to say on an ongoing basis that we welcome the student of whatever sexuality," said Bederman. She also said the Core Council is also largely responsible liJr the ehange in stu­dent attitude toward homosexuali­ty. 
Regardless of University policy, Williams said the ellcctiveness of the shirts around campus today r,an be measured one student at a time. 
"There are members of this community who have open arms to all persons, regardless of sexual orientation." Williams said. "If only one student realizes that he or she is welcome here, the shirt campaign has fulfilled its purpose in my mind."

Deteriorated facilities led to College's decision 
By MANDl STIRONE News Writer 

When Saint Mary's students returned to school this August, they found the campus' only pool -housed inside Regina Hall -drained and empty. Though little information about the pool had been made avail­able since then, recently it was announced that the Regina pool would be closing indefinitely. · 
Initially, the pool was drained in order to determine the source of the leaks that caused the loss of thousands of gallons of water over the years, according to Lynn Kachmarik, the athletics director and swim team coach. 
Karen Johnson, vice president of Student Affairs, said the room that contains the pool and the age and extent of the damage of the actual pool are two major reasons for its closing. 
In Regina, the pool is enclosed in a glass courtyard with a roof overhead. Originally, this was an open-air courtyard with no pool and was later enclosed, but not specifically for a pool, Johnson explained. So when the pool was finally added, several problems came up, including issues with drainage, heating and moisture. 
The roof of the enclosed courtyard is also damaged, and there is currently a project underway to fix it, according to Johnson. 
The pool itself "is very old and damaged beyond repair," Johnson said. 
Unfortunately for students 
who use the pool, there will be no replacement pool -at least not for a while. Johnson said because of the construction of a new academic building, putting in a new pool isn't an option right now. 
There are alternatives to the Regina pool, according to Kachmarik. Students can use the swimming pool in Notre Dame's Rockne Memorial for recreational swimming. The swim team will continue to practice at LaSalle Academy and Rolfs· Aquatic Facility at Notre Dame, as they have been doing for quite some time, she said. Kachmarik said she is also planning on working with the Red Cross to find a way for stu­dents to still be able to get life­guard and WSI certifications. 
Despite the obvious loss to the Saint Mary's community, few students seemed concerned. Kelly Tighe, a member of the swim team, expressed con<;ern with the loss of her lifeguarding job at the pool. The pool's only benefit to the team, she said, was its availability as a place to make up for missed practices. 
Students who weren't on the swim teams seemed even more apathetic about the pool. 
"I don't think anyone cares about the pool," sophomore Meg Varty said, 'The pool was useless and the space could be used for something more use­ful." 
Heather Quick, a freshman was equally flippant concerning the pool. 
"I don't really care about the pool in Regina," she said. "It's disgusting."

In Germany, Putin called the killing of Anna Politkovskaya a "disgustingly cruel" crime that cannot go unpunished, but he also played down her influence on Russian political life as "very minor." 
No high-ranking government oflicials attend­ed the funeral of the award-winning journalist, who made her name fearlessly exposing abductions and torturP. in the war in Chechnya.

DETROIT-The U.S. toast Guard's proposal to periodically close 2,500 square miles of the Great Lakes for live machine-gun firing exercis­es is vital to maintaining its ability to protect the nation's security, commanders said Tuesday. 
A number of U.S. and Canadian mayors, as well as business leaders and environmentalists have criticized the proposal, saying it could be unsafe, disruptive and unnecessary. 
The Coast Guard says it has safely conducted live-fire tests in the nation's coastal waters for years. 
China condemns nuclear test 
Nation's U.N. ambassador says North Korea must face 'some punitive actions' 
Associated Press 
UNITED NATIONS North Korea must face "some punitive actions" for testing a nuclear· device, China's U.N. ambassador said Tuesday, suggesting that Beijing may be willing to impose some form of Security Council sanctions against Pyongyang. 
China's U.N. Ambassador Wang Guangya told reporters that the council must give a "firm, con­structive, appropriate but prudent response" to North Korea. 
"I think there has to be some punitive actions but also I think these actions have to be appropriate," he said. 
Wang spoke before a meeting of the five perma­nent members of the Security Council -Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States -plus Japan, to discuss a U.S.­proposed draft Security Council resolution. It would impose an array of sanctions, including a ban on imports of military goods and luxury items, and crack down on illegal financial dealings. 
While the U.S. and its allies want a swift, tough resolution, the question has been how much pun­ishment China would allow. China has been North Korea's major ally and a source of both food and fuel for the desperate­ly poor nation of 23 mil­lion. 
Wang's comments sug­gested that Beijing will at least allow some muscle in the resolution. 
The meeting ended with­out any decision. Experts from the 15 Security Council nations planned to convene again to discuss the American draft. 
"We're making progress and we'll keep at it steadi­ly," Britain's U.N. Ambassador Emyr Jones­Parry said. 
In Beijing earlier Tuesday, China's Foreign Ministry vented its anger against its communist ally over the test for a second day, with a spokesman saying that relations had been damaged. 


"The nuclear test will undoubtedly exert a nega­tive impact on our rela­tions," the spokesman, Liu Jianchao, said at a routine media briefing. He said Monday's test was done "flagrantly, and in disre­gard of the international community's shared oppo­sition." 
Wang went a step fur­ther than Liu, who said the time was not right for pun­ishment, much less mili­tary action. 
China finds North Korea as a useful if irritating buffer against U.S. forces station~d in South Korea. The worry for Beijing is that too much pressure could cause economically unsteady North Korea to collapse, sending North Koreans streaming across the border into northeast China and inviting inter­vention by the American military. 
The North, meanwhile, stepped up its threats aimed at Washington, say­ing it could fire a nuclear­tipped missile unless the United States acts to resolve its standoff with Pyongyang, the Yonhap news agency reported from Beijing. 
"We hope the situation will be resolved before an unfortunate incident of us firing a nuclear missile comes," Yonhap quoted an unidentified North Korean official as saying. "That depends on how the U.S. will act." 
The official said the 

nuclear test was "an expression of our intention to face the United States across the negotiating table," reported Yonhap, which didn't say how or where it contacted the offi­cial, or why no name was. given. 
Even if Pyongyang is confirmed to have nuclear weapons, experts say it's unlikely the North has a bomb design small and light enough to be mount­ed atop a missile. Their long-range missile capabil­ity also remains in ques­tion, after a test rocket in July apparently fizzled out shortly after takeoff. 
The Bush administration rejected anew Tuesday direct talks with North Korea and said it would not be intimidated by the reported threat. 
Ex-Foley aide to testify Thursday 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -Mark Foley's for­mer chief of staff, who says he warned the House speaker's staff three years ago of inappropriate Foley conduct toward male pages, is to testify Thursday before the House ethics committee. 
Kirk Fordham will insist that he warned Speaker Dennis Hastert's chief of staff about the conduct in 2003 or possibly the previous year, Fordham lawyer Timothy Heaphy said. 
Earlier Tuesday, Rep. Jim Kolbe of Arizona said a former page he had sponsored contacted his office in 2000 or 2001 to complain of e-mails from Foley, the Florida Republican who has ·resigned. Kolbe said he "passed along" the complaint to Foley and to then-House Clerk Jeff Trandahl. 

Trandahl's lawyer, Cono Namorato, said Trandahl "will cooperate fully with the FBI and the House ethics committee investigations." 
Trandahl has refused to discuss actions he took when he learned about Foley's approaches and, until now, had declined even to disclose the name of his attorney. 
Fordham is a key figure, not only because he's a former top aide to Foley, but because his public state­ments have been at odds with those of Hastert chief of staff Scott Palmer. Palmer denied Fordham's assertions that he warned Palmer about Foley at least three years ago. 
"He'll reaffirm things he said. He sticks by that," Heaphy said. 
Meanwhile, Hastert said Tuesday he'll dismiss anyone on his staff found to have covered up concerns about Foley's approaches to former pages.

Faculty 
continued from page 1 
directly tied to faculty· recruit­
ment: "The Catholic identity of the 
University depends upon, and is 
nurtured by, the continuing pres­
ence of a predominant number of 
Catholic intellectuals." 
"[A predomillant number] refers 
to both more than 50 percent and 
not simply being satisfied with 50 
percent," Malloy said. "It's an 
effort, without specifYing a specific 
number, to take seriously that 
numbers and percentages make a 
difference." 
Malloy said he and University 
President Emeritus Father 
Theodore Hesburgh believed, as 
Jenkins does now, that the pres­
ence of Catholic faculty makes an 
important contribution to the 
University. 
Internal, external aspirations 
In 2003, Malloy and other lead­ers of the University drafted a strategic plan called "Notre Dame 2010: Fulfilling the Promise," which described Notre Dame's commitment to become a premier university while simultaneously maintaining its Catholic identity. 
The agenda -which was approved by the Board of Trustees in 2004-outlined ways for Notre Dame to remain "the premier center of Catholic intellectual life" and promoted the recruitment of both Catholic intellectuals and non-Catholics who can contribute to broad conversation. The University must "recruit aggres­sively" to bring Catholic scholars to Notre Dame, the document said. 
His administration recognized the importance of actively seeking out Catholic faculty members, Malloy said, as their numbers gradually declined over the years -a decline he saw as a threat to Notre Dame's Catholic identity. 
"We felt that that was putting our academic mission and its con­nection to the Catholic identity of the institution at risk," Malloy said. 
Malloy took several steps during his presidency to maintain a pre­dominantly Catholic faculty. 
A simple first step was to find out whether faculty position appli­cants were Catholic. Notre Dame started to ask interested scholars to self-identify their religion as part of the application and inter­view process, Malloy said ­something he said "most Catholic universities" don't do at the time of hire. 
The University then designated some faculty positions as "targets of opportunities" so deans could hire Catholic scholars they other­wise may not have been able to hire, he said. To find applicable Catholic scholars, Malloy advanced efforts to identify Catholic students in graduate school who might teach at the University -and encouraged Notre Dame undergraduates to go to graduate school to prepare for future teaching careers. 
The Vatican document Ex Corde Ecclesiae, approved by U.S. Catholic bishops in 1999, described the identity and mission of Catholic universities in a way that closely parallels Notre Dame's mission: "The university should recruit and appoint faithful Catholics as professors so that, as much as possible, those commit­ted to the witness of faith will con­stitute a majority of the faculty." 
"The spirit of Ex Corde Ecclesiae is that we need to take seriously our mir.;sion and identity as a Catholic university," Malloy said. 
What that means, he said, is that the University should announce its Catholicity to "try to attract to our midst faculty and administrators and staff and stu­dents who think this provides a 
special dimension to the education 
available here." 
Mark Roche, dean of the College 
of Arts and Letters, said the 
University's commitment to a 
mostly Catholic faculty predates 
the Vatican document, calling it 
rather an "internal aspiration." 
A new strategy 
In his first address to the faculty 
last fall, Jenkins stated his com­
mitment to maintaining a pre­
dominance of Catholic faculty 
members at Notre Dame, describ­
ing the University's Catholic char­
acter as an academic strength. 
Maintaining this character is a 
goal Jenkins has established for 
his presidency. 
"Notre Dame was founded with 
a religious character," Jenkins 
said last October. "Its statutes 
state it should retain this charac­
ter in perpetuity. It is a priority of 
mine to keep this distinctive char­
acter strong." 
His second address to the facul­
ty renewed this commitment to 
strengthen the presence of 
Catholic faculty at Notre Dame 
and established a concrete plan to 
reverse the declining numbers of 
Catholic faculty -an office led by 
Father Robert Sullivan and fund­
ed by a donation from the Keough 
family designed to identify 
Catholic scholars. 
Sullivan, who as director of the 
Erasmus Institute has prior expe­
rience in bringing Catholic schol­
ars to the University, called the 
office an "information retrieval 
operation." 
The mission of this office, he 
said, is not to hire faculty mem­
bers -since this is the job ofeach 
individual college -but "simply 
to provide information." 
A newly developed database will 
fulfill that function. Roche 
approached Sullivan in June of 
2005 to ask him to create a direc­
tory of scholars, mainly Catholics, 
who would be qualified to teach in 
the College ofArts and Letters. 
Sullivan and those working with 
him collected hundreds of poten­
tial candidates for Roche. Last 
spring, University Provost Thomas 
Burish asked Sullivan to explore 
the possibility of expanding this 
database to find scholars to fill 
faculty positions in departments 
throughout the University. 
Those within the Notre Dame 
community who feel strongly 
about the importance of increas­
ing the number of Catholics on the 
faculty say they are encouraged 
by the latest push toward that 
goal. 
Malloy said Jenkins' speech was 
consistent with the University's 
aims throughout the years and 
that he is excited about the possi­
bility of boosting Catholic faculty 
numbers. 
"I have great confidence that both Father Jenkins and Provost Burish will pursue this goal with great enthusiasm and a recogni­tion that it's not an easy goal to achieve, but one that requires constant and dedicated effort," Malloy said. 
Roche called the Keough office a "very promising project." 
W. David Solomon, director of the Center for Ethics and Culture, agreed with Jenkins' statement that Notre Dame needs a strong preponderance of Catholics to retaih its identity. Faculty mem­
·bers set the tone of the University, 
Solomon said -but not everyone 
will embrace Jenkins' mission. 
"I think there are a fair number of faculty members that would like Notre Dame to be more like secular institutions," Solomon said. "I think they are going to feel threatened by Notre Dame's enthusiasm toward this goal." 
The third part of this series will explore the response of faculty members to Jenkins' initiative to recruit Catholic professors.

Africa

can get worse, you are wrong," said Chaza)l, the head of the School of Government and Society in the Academic College of Tel Aviv and a former member of the Israeli Parliament. "They can and they will [get worse1 unless these problems are corrected." 
She referred to the political breakdown ofstates due to ethnic fragmentation and conflict, famine and the AIDS epidemic. 
"Imagine what it must be like to wake up in the morning and not know if you will eat anything at all during the day," she said. "Most people in Africa live their lives this way-barely scratching subsistence." 
However, Chazan reminded her audience that hunger and poverty are not the end of Africa's trou­bles, as she suspected that rough­ly 60 percent of the population in several parts of the continent was infected with the HIV virus. 
"That's enough to send shivers down your back isn't it?" she said, noting gasps when she men­tioned the statistics. · 
Chazan compared the AIDS epidemic to a form of genocide. The world's sluggishness in react­ing despite millions of deaths is reminiscent of other genocides, such as the Holocaust, and in more recent years, the Rwandan massacres of 1994 and the ongo­ing crisis in Darfur, she said. 
One of the possible explana­tions for the international com­munity's hesitation to engage in Afiica could be the failed involve­ment of the United Nations and the United States in Somalia in 1993, which resulted in casualties for both sides, Chazan said. 
She warned against nations using this and other similar unsuccessful precedents as excuses to wash their hands of responsibility. 
"Sometimes engaging is painful but the alternative is worse," she said. 

As Africa is neglected by the more developed nations, she said, it is exposed to exploitation and abuse -such as arms trafficking and resource poaching, in refer­ence to foreign diamond smug­glers in the Ivory Coast. 
In outlining a recommended relief strategy for the internation­al community, Chazan said the establishment of "a global part­nership" is essential. 
"Africa cannot do without inter­national involvement, but the work needs to be done by the Afiicans, as they know the prob­lems they are facing better than anybody else," she said. 
She also spoke about providing aid that will first restore stability to the region -not just humani­tarian comfort. 
"Humanitarian work makes you feel better but focusing on the macro levelr.; of this problem is far more effective," she said. 
Though teaching villagers to read and write is an admirable accomplishment, Chazan argued there are more pressing needs that have to be fulfilled, such as the stabilization of regimes and state capabilities. 
She urged her audience to lobby in Washington D.C., London, or elsewhere to per­suade governments to invest in rebuilding African institutions and infrastructure -which has seriously deteriorated in most states as a result of the perpetual political turmoil and conflicts between ethnic factions. 
A member of the audience asked Chazan if she believed Notre Dame was making a mis­take by investing in the Millennium Development Initiative in Uganda, discussed in the Global Health Forum earlier this semester, which proposed teaching individuals how to over­come poverty. 
She replied that certainly these noble efforts alleviate the mis­eries of a few people, but that they do not offer long-term solu­tions to the continent's troubles. 
"If you ignore these basic needs, the [states] will continue to break down and as chaos grows, it will destroy all the good your humanitarian efforts may have done," she said. 
The lecture hit a sour note when an older man in the audi­ence vehemently grilled Chazan and demanded why she placed the burden of responsibility of the African crisis on the entire world, instead of telling affiuent African­Americans to return to their ancestral land and help. 
While the episode stirred ten­sion in the auditorium, Chazan remained collected. 
"Afiican-Americans are citizens of the United States -like any other white citizen -and this is their home," she said. "The Afiican continent is their respon­sibility as much as it is that of the entire world." 
At the beginning of the lecture she mentioned that her Jewish background, presence at a Catholic university, and African subject matter might have seemed a humorous combination. At the same time, she said the continent's troubles were so over­whelmingly catastrophic to human beings that any person in any corner of the world would inevitably be touched if he was well informed of the situation. 
"Those who have been to Africa know that once you've seen what's going on, once you've 
caught the bug ­ it stays with  
you," Chazan said.  
Notre  Dame  sophomore  

Alexandra Kotcheff agreed on the relevance of the topic to all stu­dents and future leaders. 
"This school embodies the sense of giving back to the com­munity -both locally and global­ly -and so it's really important to stay informed about the situa­tion at hand," she said. 
The lecture was sponsored by the Notre .Dame Holocaust Project, the Kroc. Institute, the Office of the Provost, and the Abrams Fund for Excellence in Jewish-Christian Studies.

IN BRIEF 
Weather shuts off Alaska pipeline 
ANCHORAGE, Alaska-The 800-mile trans­Alaska pipeline was closed down Tuesday after operators lost communications amid rainy weather to remote valves that close in the event of a spill. 
Mike Heatwole, spokesman for Alyeska Pipeline Service Co., said company protocol calls for the shutdown when valves cannot be shut down from long distance. The valves must be staffed by crews that can manually operate the valves, he said. 
Flooding caused by heavy rain in south-cen­tral Alaska is suspected of knocking out fiber optic communication lines along the highway, Heatwole said. 
Earlier Tuesday, a power outage caused by high winds forced BP PLC to close operations at Prudhoe Bay in northern Alaska, cutting production from 350,000 barre.ls to about 20,000 barrels, BP spokesman Daren Beaudo said. 
BP expected power back later Tuesday and anticipated ramping up production, said spokesman Daren Beaudo. 
Government cracks down on fraud 
WA..,HINGTON -Software maker Oracle Corp. agreed Tuesday to pay $98.5 million to settle com­plaints that it overcharged the government on multiple contracts, Justice Department officials said. 
The settlement with Oracle's PeopleSoft kicked off what the department called a crackdown on waste, fraud and abuse in federal contacts. 
Deputy Attorney General Paul McNulty was to announce the settlement with Oracle Corp. along with a new government-wide task force, including investigators from at least 20 federal agencies, at a late afternoon news conference in Washington. 
Oracle's PeopleSoft had a number of software and service contracts with the General Services Administration between 1997 and 2005, and pro­vided "defective price disclosures," according to an ollicial who spoke on condition of anonymi­ty because the settlement had not yet been announced. 
"At a time of heightened concern for our nation's security, every tax dollar is precious," said McNulty said in a statement. "We simply cannot tolerate fraud and abuse in government contracting."

Forecasts made for heating bills 
Natural gas costs expected to fall; oil and electricity prices predicted to rise 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON 
Families using natural gas 
can expect their heating 
bills to drop about $119 
this winter. Those who 
heat with oil or electricity 
are likely to see their bills 
rise. 
The government issued predictions Tuesday based on its forecast of a mild winter for most of the nation and its assessment of energy supplies and costs as the nation's oil and natural gas production and refinery output recov­er from hurricane damage in 2005. 
"This is a very different scene than we had a year ago in the wake of hurri­canes Katrina and Rita," said Guy Caruso, head of the Energy Information Administration, the Energy Department's statistical agency. 
The hurricanes knocked 
out 20 percent of the 
nation's gas production, 
severely damaged Gulf 
Coast gas processing facili­
ties and shut more than a 
dozen refineries -an 
impact "we're only now

"Most groups just make something and slap the Notre Dame logo on it and hope people buy it. We're trying to do something that might help students out a little bit," Sciortino said. 
The Domer Delivery team said their service can be a great assistance to all stu­dents, even to those who have a car, because of its convenience. For those stu­dents who do not have a car, Domer Delivery offers lower prices and better selection than the Huddle and more convenience than taking the Transpo bus or a cab to the store. And for students with access to a car, Domer Delivery saves time out of the day. · 
According to their Web site, "all orders placed by 1 p.m. on the date of purchase will be delivered between 6 p.m. and 8 p.m. on that day [ ... ] All orders placed after i p.m. will be delivered on the next day." 
Domer Delivery charges students a 15-17.5 percent delivery fee for each order. While this fee may sound high to students, "it's no dif­ferent than what you'd tip at a restaurant," Gille said. 
More importantly, the fee is also less expensive than the markup at the Huddle. According to Gille, a Snapple at the Huddle costs $1.42, which is marked up 80 per­cent over the same Snapple at Martin's. Similarly, the Huddle marks up Doritos 75 percent and Pop-Tarts 48 percent, he said. 
"In comparison, our fee really isn't that bad," Gille said.

New records were also set in a variety of categories. 
Unrestricted giving hit a record high $25.4 million, exc-eeding last year's record by $2.5 million. $17.6 million of that total were contributed by members of the Edward Frederick Sorin Society, the Founders Circle and President's Circle members, who donate $1,000, $3,000 and $25,000, respectively, each year in unrestricted gifts. 
A record-high 53.2 percent of undergraduate alumni donated in the 2006 fiscal year, breaking the record of 53 percent set in 1994. 
The University also received a record $132.4 mil­lion in new pledge commit­ments, five of which were for $10 million or more. 
Overall development pro­duction was $247.2 million, exceeding last year's record of $200.2 million. 
The Law School received $14.8 million in donations due to the increased push to raise money for the renova­tion of the school.

dorms, the company filled 10 orders off its Web site for items from Draino to black­lights, Zehrbach said. More promising, however, is that one order came from a satis­fied repeat customer and that the Web site is receiving 520 hits per day. 
"It's all about getting the word out right now," Zehrbach said. 
The Domer Delivery team said the open-endedness of its Web site -there is no list of things available for pur­chase -is just like being at the store, where the possibili­ties are seemingly limitless. 
There are, however, a few limits to what they can deliv­er. According to their Web site, Domer Delivery will not purchase or deliver "any alcohol or tobacco product [or] any pornographic mate­rials or contraceptives." 
In the long term, the Domer Delivery team hopes their venture can "help students out a little bit," Sciortino said.

Jonathan D. Nelson, 36, was accusPd of taking more than $77 million from the second-largest land-based oil and gas drilling rig lleet in North America through a bogus invoice scheme. AuthoritiPs said he spent the money on an airplane, an airfield, a cattle ranch, a truck stop, homes and vehicles. 
Nel'lon also was fined $200,000 and ordered to pay restitution of about $77 million minus tho money that has been recouped _ about $44 million _ from the sale of assets Nelson had purchased with the stolen money. lie had faced a maximum sentence of 30 years in prison and a $500,000 fme.

ees, and specifically to Mr. Talbott and Mr. Patterson." 
In an agreement with prosecu­tors, Nelson pleaded guilty in April to one count of wire fraud and aiding and abetting; and one count of engaging in monetary transactions derived from speci­fied unlawful activity and aiding and abetting. 
During the eight years that Nelson worked for the company his compensation package was estimated at $10 million. 
"We mentored him, we gave him opportunities most people would die to have," Talbott said. "He had the opportunity to become a wealthy man honestly." 
Nelson, who resigned in November, also was accused in a Securities and Exchange Commission civil lawsuit. He was named in a criminal complaint in November that accused him of falsely certifying an SEC report. The complaint came a day after the SEC sued Nelson alleging he embezzled the money.

GOP seeks crackdo-wn on illegal iiTIITiigrants 
Associated Press 
INDIANAPOLIS -Indiana House Republicans will seek legislation designed to crack down on illegal immigration in Indiana, although some of their proposals announced Tuesday already are covered under federal law. 
"Hoosiers are concerned that individuals living in this country illegally are receiving state benefits paid for by Hoosier tax dollars," said Rep. John Smith, R-Kokomo. "It's a problem that negatively affects every citizen in Indiana." 
Rep. Eric Turner, R-Gas City, said Republicans hoped the plan would have a "chilling effect" on the flow of illegal immigration in Indiana. 
House Democrats said they were against illegal immigra­tion, but said the bill lacked teeth because it did not include enhanced penalties for employers who hire illegal immigrants. 
Some of the proposals are designed to ensure that state agencies comply with federal laws by denying illegal immi­grants public benefits such as assisted housing, post-second­ary education, unemployment assistance, and health care paid through Medicaid. Republicans said a state law would reinforce such federal restrictions. 
Another provision would require the Indiana State Police to seek a pilot program with the federal government that would broaden the authority of troopers to inves­tigate immigration violations and detain illegal immigrants. 
Other provisions include requiring Indiana authorities to notify federal officials if incarcerated people are in the country illegally -something already in federal law. 
Another provision seeks the increase criminal penalties for those who provide or pos­sess fraudulent identification not issued by the state or fed­eral governments involving illegal immigrants. 
Other provision include passing a resolution urging the federal government to take stronger action to deter illegal immigration and give states more authority in that arena. 
According the Pew Research Center, there are between 55,000 to 85,000 illegal immi­grants in Indiana. 
Some of the provisions are similar to those in a bill that was defeated 74-19 last year. The GOP controls the Indiana House 52-48, and 32 Republicans -including Smith -voted against it fol­lowing an emotional speech by Rep. Mike Murphy, chair­man of the Marion County GOP. 
He said then that the bill went too far by barring illegal immigrants from receiving child protective services in abuse cases, and denying even those suspected of being here unlawfully due process rights. He also said people might take such a law beyond its intent, and there could be a day when people walking the streets would have to wear a marker showing they were legal. 
IVORY COAST 
UN: Smugglers export diamonds despite ban 
Associated Press 
ABIDJAN -Smugglers in war­divided Ivory Coast are violating a United Nations-imposed ban on diamond sales, illegally exporting the gems to neighboring .countries for overseas sales, according to a draft U.N. report obtained Tuesday by The Associated Press. 
The illegal trade in "conflict dia­monds" has long fueled African wars and the U.N. Security Council imposed the diamond embargo on Ivory Coast in a bid to keep rebels in the turbulent country from prof­iting from the gems. 
The draft report, which has not yet been published, says $9 million to $24 million worth of diamonds mined in the rebel-held north of the West African country are being sold on the international market each year via brokers in Ghana and Mali. 
Ivory Coast has been split in two since fighting erupted in 2002, and rebels control the arid northern half. About 10,000 U.N. and French peacekeepers have been deployed to maintain a fragile peace. 
Rebel officials could not immedi­ately be reached to comment on the report's findings. 
Earlier this year, U.N. experts compiling the report visited five diamond mining sites controlled by the New Forces rebel movement. 
The report identified four major diamond dealers -a Ivorian, a Malian, a Belgian and another whose nationality was not known -in the northern rebel town of Seguela. It also cited two Belgian buyers who relocated to Ghana fol­lowing the outbreak of Ivory Coast's war. 
A 60 percent rise in diamond exports from Ghana since 2000 could be explained by U.N. embar­goes on Ivorian and Uberian dia­monds, the report said. 
Ivorian rebels impose taxes on trucks carrying goods through their territory to finance their activities and admit to smuggling cocoa to neighboring countries. 
Porous borders and poor con­trols are to blame for the illicit dia­mond trade, according to the U.N. report, which urged Ghana and Mali to take steps to prevent Ivorian diamonds from being smuggled through their territory. 
The diamond ban made Ivory Coast part of the "Kimberley Process," established in 2002 to help control conflict diamonds ­sometimes called "blood dia­monds" -that have fueled and funded wars that killed millions in Angola, Congo, Sierra Leone and Uberia. 
The process is designed to track diamonds from mines to jewelry display cases, certifYing the origin of each stone.

I have always thought the llcsburgh Library a great place to do homework, but my studies this weekend were a struggle. 
The problem was the dflsks on the twelfth !loor. For all readers who have never ventured to the library's upper levels, the desks there arc not so much desks as striking wooden giants nestled at intervals throughout the stacks. All are crafted, not just made, of wood. All are pleasingly over­sized and bordered on three sides by short wooden walls. 
No view of good-looking premeds, no electric outlet for one's laptop, nothing. Complete sensory deprivation. In theory, these desks give college students the perfect environ­ment to study, sleep, drool, whatevflr. 
But alas, the hypnotic powflrs of thesfl desks have been rendered ineffective by the thick layer of graffiti that coats each one. 
The graffiti itself is wonderful in its diversity. Some is contemplative ("What is love?") and some is heart-rending ("Mike-don't let me go yet. I'm wait­ing for you.") Some is ironic ("I hate all you people who write on desks!") and

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Examining pro-life values 
As I walked through the rows of crosses on South Quad last week, ·I recalled the first, and only, meeting of the Right to Life dub I attended. Two years ago, I listened expectantly to their student leaders and heard the mission statement. I was told of the popularity of abortion and the pro­posed actions taken by the club to help stop it. The meeting ended. As every­one filed out of the LaFortune room. I followed, rather dissatisfied. Surely this could not have been the entirety of the meeting. 
The Catholie "pro-li!'e" mission is the protection of life from the .time of con­eeption until natural death. This means that it is not just a matter of' abortion, but of any injustice against the human person in which the inher­ent sanctity of' a person is ignored. As a potential member of the club, I perused the aetivities and lectures; tho topics were valuable and well meant, but it was decidedly abortion-focused. 
A couple months after this meeting the courts ruled against the continua­tion of medical eare for Terri Sehiavo; the courts ruled that she had no right to life. Where was the Right to Life out­ery on campus? Would her case have more weight if she were still a fetus? I realize the issue of abortion is a eriti­eal topie today, but we eannot loose sight of what it is to be pro-life. The Right to Life club avows that it is pro­life, but what is it but the Anti­Abortion league?

some is delightfully obsolete ("I luv BIUTNEY Spears.") From the compul­sive (an elaborate pen-on-wood etching of the Dome) to the politically incorrect ("Theology is Gay") to the timeless ("I hate physies!!!") to the profound ("If 4 out of 5 people sufTer from diarrhea, does the 5th enjoy it?"), the desks in the Hesburgh Library are records of thoughts that oceur to most sensory­deprived minds in passing but does not usually end up carved in wood. 
I've heard it suggested that the graffiti system is for many students a sort of confession. Sounds like a reaeh, but actually the idea is eompelling. Sinee Vatican II, countless Catholics have thrown Reconciliation by the wayside and yet retain that confessional mental­ity peculiar to the Church. With a little imagination, an anguished and deeply bored mind could easily turn the desks into confessionals. The readers of' the grafliti are then transformed into priests, hearing confessions and absolv­ing sins. 
Then again, consider the sehmuek who prof'p,ssed his or her "luv" for Britney Spears on a library desk near the BX 1620. Ms. Heeonciliation? Maybe not. 
Perhaps, then, the graffiti is an ongo­ing dialogue -a way for students to reach out to the rest of the community. There are all kinds of studies !loating around nowadays proving that advancements in technology isolate 
The ultimate question is this: who are we to narrow the Catholic under­standing of pro-life to include abortion, but exclude all other issues? We ean­not piek and ehoose. If we wish to be pro-life, we must seek to proteet all those in society who have no voice. Where are the crosses for those thou­sands dying from capital punishment each year? The mal-treated elderly and mentally disabled? The euthanasia victims? The mistreated prisoners of war? The hungry in Africa? Each of these groups has a right to life, but these people, just like the child in the womb, are being passed over by socie­ty. 
I realize that to give all these issues their proper due is a monumental task for any one group on Notre Dame's eampus, but I believe simply raising awareness of' these issues and some sort of address by the Hight to Life club is in order. Perhaps donate some money from the football coneession stand to other organizations besides the anti-abortion organizations or sponsor more lectures that incorporate a fuller understanding of being pro­life. As the named "Right to Life" club on campus, to ignore other groups where the sanetity of human life is threatened is not only an injustiee to these groups, but is also a disservice to the Notre Dame community, which has a right to be informed of these issues by the group that claims to protect them. So great are the injustices to the sanctity of life in today's world that we cannot, in the Catholic call for social people from one another to the point that they are uncomfortable relating to other human beings in person. They are foreed seek new ways to eonnect with others at an emotional level. For exam­ple, ten years ago, people wouldn't dream of letting anyone read their per­sonal journals. Now they post them online. Could desk graffiti yet be anoth­er way of expressing oneself without having actual human contaet? Faeebook for the unplugged? 
I don't know. What I do know is that the library is oeeupied, on any given afternoon, by hundreds of intelleetually inclined individuals, all brimming with youthful vigor and a professed thirst to make a mark on the world. All have been told that studying in the library will help them do just that. 
Then they lose focus and make their marks on the library instead. 
Maybe I'm being sanctimonious. After all, right now, I am making my mark on the world in a most eomfortable man­ner. In a few days this paper will be tucked into the library's mierofilm archives, in no danger of anyone scratching it out or writing over it.

Community acceptance of coming out 
When I came to Notre Dame four years ago, I was convineed that I had made a mistake. I knew that I was gay, and I felt that there was no one on this eampus who I could trust. I felt like I didn't belong. That being gay didn't belong at Notre Dame. 
It wasn't until! started seeing people wear the "Gay? Fine by me." shirts that I realized that I had judged this eampus too soon. In faet, I couldn't have been more wrong. 
Four years later, I ean confidently tell you that I have experienced infmitely more aeceptanee on this campus than rejection. In fact, sometimes aeceptance can eome from the most unusual of places. So to anyone who might be ques­tioning their sexual orientation, while everyone here might not aeeept you, there is an army of people, of every orientation, made up of faculty and classmates that are glad that you are here. And ifyou look, you'll find there is a list of just a few of those people in this Observer.

Where state and justice intersect 
This is part two in a three-part series examining capital punishment. 
Terre Haute, a city in Western Indiana, is the home of the only federal death chamber in the U.S., where inmates sentenced to death by the fed­eral government are executed by lethal

Columnist

Correctional Institute in Terre Haute is the intersection of State Road and Justice Drive. 
More than an intensely ironic image (captured in a photo of the street signs on Amnesty International USA's web­site), the literal meeting of State and Justice in such proximity to the only fed­eral death row in the U.S. provides a visible illustration of a current political shift in capital punishment advocacy and decisions. 
In his October 2 Viewpoint column, "You, Me & the Death Penalty," Will McAuliffe emphasized that each time a prisoner is removed from confinement and executed, the supervising state gov­ernment and judicial system acts on behalf of its people. 
Thinking that you and I, and the majority of citizens, endorse state-sanc­tioned homicide, most states currently uphold capital punishment-in our name. But recent developments and restrictions placed on the death penalty, both within state legislation and on the federal level, suggest that it doesn't have to be so. 
Whether it be the U.S. Supreme Court or the state of Illinois, American institu­tions are increasingly taking into account both domestic public opinion and widespread disapproval of the international community regarding the death penalty. And the Supreme Court's rationale in two major and recent capi­tal punishment rulings provides con­crete incentive to Americans to speak out on this issue, utilizing grassroots activism to institute change in state laws; which can then translate into fed­eral reform. 
Most recently, in 2005 the Supreme Court struck down the legality of exe­cuting juvenile offenders in Roper v. Simmons. The Court's decision took into account the increasing infrequency of the application of the death penalty to juveniles. At the time of the ruling, the juvenile death penalty was legal in twenty states, only six of which had exe­cuted prisoners for crimes committed as juveniles since 1989. In seeking a "national consensus," the Court decided to abolish the death penalty for all citi­zens younger than eighteen on a nation­al level. This decision aligned with American public opinion, as polls con­sistently reported that roughly 70 per­cent of the US population opposed the practice of a juvenile death penalty at the time of Roper v. Simmons. 

The international community provided even stronger opposition to juvenile exe­cutions. According to Amnesty International, Iran and the Democratic Republic of the Congo are the only other countries in the world that sanction the execution ofjuvenile offenders. Moreover, the practice directly violates numerous international human rights agreements, including the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. 
In 2002, with Atkins v. Virginia, the Supreme Court ruled that executing the mentally retarded violates the Eighth Amendment's ban on cruel and unusual punishment. The Court again took into account both international opinion and state laws. 
The Court's decision stated that the Eighth Amendment should be interpret­ed in light of the "evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society," which it said were indicated by reforms 'in state legislation. 
Justice John Paul Stevens, in writing for the Court in Atkins v. Virginia, noted that it is not the number of States with laws preventing the execution of men­tally retarded murder defendants that is especially significant (though eighteen states have banned it in the past fifteen years), but "the consistency of the direc­tion of change." 
This consistent shift in public opinion and state law regarding the death 
LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Rally reform needed for attendance increase 

Campus unity needed 
After reading the articles about no moti­vation last weekend for the Stanford game, I fully agree about the pep rally comments. I think that Siegfried President Tom Martin said it best: "Pep rallies are catered to the public." Tom is right; they are. Students are forced to arrive extremely early, not allowed to bring anything with them, and recite the same cheers over and over and over again. I have been coming to pep ral­lies since freshman year and they have not changed one bit except for the fact that we do not do that stupid clap thing that we did when Ty was the coach. I think that this is one problem that should be addressed: the fact that it seems to be more catered to the visitors rather than the student body. 
Another problem I think with the current pep rally system is the separation of dorms, the "Balkanization of Notre Dame." In my honest opinion, from Sunday through Thursday, dorm rivalries are alright, but on Friday and Saturday, you are a student at Notre Dame and a representative of Notre Dame, not Zahm or Keenan, or any other dorm on campus. I think that stu­dents should wear The Shirt to the pep ral­lies and bring the towels that Coach Weis gave us for Penn State and yell your head off like the game is going on. Cheer with your fellow students, not against them because they may live in another dorm. It may sound weak, but come on, I think it is ridiculous that at a pep rally, instead of cheering for Notre Dame, you are cheering against rival dorms. 
My father went here and graduated back in the 1970s. Back then, the pep rallies were held in Stepan and were basically riots: people throwing toilet paper, band playing, coaches and team yelling at the fans to cheer louder, you get the idea. Today, we have MCs who tell a little story, then porn squad and cheerleaders, then the band, then the players and coaches walk out, and then they speak, then they leave, then the band plays, then it is over. In a nutshell, the pep rallies are the same every week. 
I propose this: move the pep rallies back to Stepan. Stepan has no seats, hence nobody can sit down. Stepan is also small­er, so it would be louder, and loud noises excite people. Let in students and crazed fans only, everybody else who wants to sit down can go to the Joyce Center and watch it on screens from cameras inside Stepan. Have NDSP on hand, but in a state-school­type capacity. What I mean by this is crowd-control only. The police should not be there to wage war on our fun. They should be there to monitor everything and make sure the students do not fight or burn couches, etc. 
Let us drink for crying out loud. 
At other univer.sities where I have attended pep rallies, they will tell you to finish your beer. 
Stop citing kids. It's college. Have no MCs at all; have the Leprechaun introduce the team, band, everyone. Other than the play­ers and coaches, the Leprechaun should be the only guy with a microphone. 
Have everybody wear The Shirt and bring the green towels. Get the band in fast and keep playing; let the porn squad and cheerleaders in and dance, then bring in the team: make it like it used to be, create a tailgating, party atmosphere. We should not have to spend time in the pep rallies yelling at people to stand up. 
Attendance should not be decreasing, it should be increasing. Tossing out free shirts or providing incentives or some silly trophy is not going to make people decide to show up. The entire system itself must be changed. 
Pat Rigney senior off-campus Oct. 9 

Revert back to rallies of the 70s 
I'm a '76 alum who normally doesn't feel it's appropriate to get involved in The Observer's discussions. However, in the case of Rohan Anand's article on the decline in pep rally participation, I think a little "institutional memory" jog would be helpful. I've attended one of the events that ND now calls a "pep rally," and-in honor of Uoyd Bentsen-I have to say, ''I've known ND pep rallies. ND pep rallies were a friend of mine. But, current ND students, these are NOT real pep rallies!" 
Why don't today's students want to attend? Simple: Today's events are auto­mated, sanitized, emotionless shells of what used to rock Stepan Center and, before that, the Field House. You're a high IQ bunch-you can smell a fake a mile away. A real pep rally requires approxi­mately 30 minutes of the following:  A locale that ensures extremely crowded, standing-room-only conditions.  Attendance by only students, team, coach­es, and the band. (Everyone else should be afraid to attend.)  Room temperature of at least 90 degrees.  Poor loudspeaker quali­ty.  Loud, hoarse tributes by the coaching staff.  Loud, hoarse exhortations by select­ed team members.  Loud, hypnotic, repeated playing of the Victory March.  Constant screaming by students. 
I don't want to hear that Stepan is too small. It was too small in the '70s, too. That just gave us extra incentive to get there early and get in. Father Jenkins was in my class and Coach Weis was two years later. They remember what pep rallies used to be. Enlist them to help bring back the real Notre Dame pep rally experience. Believe me, you won't regret it.

penalty does not end with mentally-ill death row inmates; rather, it reflects an overall trend in a reforming criminal justice climate in our nation. For the first time since the death penalty's 1976 re-instatement, momentum has turned 
against capital punishment not only in public opinion, but also among judges 
and legislators. 
Cases like Roper v. ~immons and Atkins v. Virginia demonstrate that efforts at the state level can have an impact federally. In working for a moratorium on the death penalty in Indiana, we can embrace this trend, recognizing that local political action and grassroots activism can effect both state and federal decisions on capital punishment. 
This reality is a responsibility we must acknowledge as we work for the end of the use of the death penalty in Indiana, and move toward the day when the intersection of Justice Drive and State Road in Terre Haute will no longer be a site of irony.

From an early age, children are taught to look at Columbus as a hero. When they get older they celebrate actively or just enjoy the day off on the federal holi­day established to commemorate the glorious achievements of Christopher Columbus. 
However, fewer Americans are cele­brating each year. ln fact, people in seventeen states no longer recognize the holiday. On this Columbus Day more people need to take the time to think about what they are celebrating. 
When Columbus "discovered" America, there were millions of peo­ple thriving in this land. His contribu­tions to the indigenous groups were disease, slaughter, rape, greed and an interruption of well-balanced soci­eties. Truer facts about who Columbus really was have surfaced and many Americans, indigenous and non­indigenous alike, are re-examining Columbus' contribution to America. 
Through this, they give a more accurate portrayal. Teachers are offering young students honest accounts surrounding Columbus, allowing them to decide for them­selves: hero or villain. In celebrating this man's memory once a year, we have to ask ourselves: What are we really celebrating? For many indige­nous people, it is yet another reminder of colonization, pain and injustice ... America is celebrating genocide.

Especially entertaining is a short montage of "Sawyerisms" -the funny and sometimes allusive quotes, nick­names and sayings Sawyer (Josh Holloway) calls his fellow survivors. Some of these include "Freckles" for Kate and "Chewie" for Jin. 
More than eight hours of bonus fea­tures offer chances to deconstruct the show's mysteries. With another season under its belt, the "Lost" DVDs dig deeper into the show's mythos, elevat­ing this DVD set over its predecessor. 
On a technical level, each episode in the set is quite impressive. The lush, natural beauty of the island shines forth in the crisp widescreen presenta­tion. Enjoying "Lost" on a surround sound system literally puts the viewer in the jungle and makes Michael Giacchino's alternatively brooding and uplifting score all the better. 
By all accounts, most thought it would be difficult for this season of "Lost" to outdo the first season's release. However, this new special edi­tion outdoes its younger sibling in every way. It is truly everything a "Lost" fan can ask for, allowing them to fire up the DVD player, push the button and see what happens.

'LOST' THIRD SEASON REDISCOVERS 
Near the climactic end of the second season of"Lost,'~l the ominous Henry Gale, leader of the Others,l remarked that his followers -prone to wearing faka beards and kidnapping children -are "the good guys." This startling revelation led fans of the hit televi­sion show to question just how many groups o~ "Others" might exist on this paranormal island andl what their motives might be. 
Having recently begun its third season, the hit ABC drama "Lost" has become famous for a suspense-filled, mystery-driven plot that always seems to raise more: questions than it answers. With both season two and' the hatch done away with, the show's creators have stated that the focus will now turn towards the mysteri-'1 ous Others -specifically who they are, why they inhabit the island and what they want with everyone's favorite castaways. 
As the start of the third season, Jack (Matthew Fox), Kate (Evangeline Lilly) and Sawyer (Josh Holloway): were held captive by the Others in separate prison ce and each faced various dilemmas. Most notable was perhaps Jack's interaction with an Other named Juliet (Elizabeth Mitchell) and the emerging possibility o romance between the two. 
Other romances will emerge on the island this seaso as well, possibly between Kate and Sawyer, Charlie an Claire or between new cast members. Recent hires Rodrigo Santoro ("Love Actually") and Kiele Sanchez ("Stuck on You") will emerge as a good-looking couple that managed to remain unnoticed in the background of the island for two seasons. 
Although romance will play a big role in the third season (the show's creators have dubbed it the "season of romance"), "Lost" will stick to the formula that cata~ pulted it to fame. In true "Lost" fashion, this forebodes that castaways will die and that there will be enough plot twists and surprises to keep Hitchcock happy. 
The first six episodes of season three will act as a mini-series that focuses the spotlight on the Others (although it won't neglect the regular castaways and the events that have occurred since the hatch implod­

ed). After this, "Lost" will break until February, when it will return without a hiatus until what will likely be another clillhanger season finale. 
As the phenomenon that is "Lost" enters its junior year, it is perhaps embarking on its most exciting jour­ney yet. The show works so well because, at its heart, it explores humanity at its very best and very worst, allowing viewers to connect with the characters' emo­tional fluctuations under the harshest of conditions. 
With so many of the show's characters having reached stages ranging from depression to disbelief regarding their conceptions of life, the resolution of these dilemmas should make for excellent television.

within the hatch, the current season will have a chance to explore the page 14 mythology of the entire island, from its polar bears to the smoke monster to a four-toed statue of a giant foot seen in the season two finale. 
Insights into these mysteries keep the show's fan base appeased and maintain a freshness and vitality to "Lost" that many other programs lack. Series co-cre­ators J.J. Abrams and Damon Lindelof seem to have struck the perfect blend of humanity and mythology in their show. Between writing, directing and prodv.cing what has now become a behemoth, Abrams and Lindelof keep busy schedules but seem capable of maintaining the quality and originality that make "Lost" special. 
As "Lost" progresses through its third season, a con­

THE SIX DEGREES OF J .J. ABRAMS 
Plane crashes, covert agencies and impossible missions clutter the mind of one man, bubbling to the surface to satiate a global audience starved for serialized storytelling. He's been called the next Steven Spielberg, a television auteur whose moniker has become a name brand coveted by viewers and executives alike. Millions have been gambled on the chance that his next project will reach the heights enjoyed by "Alias" and "Lost," two good rea­sons for ABC's phoenix-like ascent to its current perch atop the ratings throne. 
As a television producer, writer, director, composer and actor, J .J. Abrams, 40, is a rare talent. As a child, Abrams would experiment with short films that he captured using a Super-8 camera. One of his first such efforts -a horror movie called "The Attic" -starred childhood friend Greg Grunberg, who now plays a lead role on NBC's "Heroes" and has made cameos in each of Abrams' shows. 
"[J.J.) shot it, then scratched in the monster, frame by frame. It was a bolt-of-lightning creature. He compen­sated ahead of time for where the monster would be," Grunberg said in an interview with USA Today. "We were, like, 11." 
Abrams hasn't lost that youthful enthusiasm despite a career that spans two decades. He's an executive producer on three different shows this season alone, all of which are on ABC -"Lost," "What About Brian" arid "Six Degrees." And if that doesn't seem taxing enough, those three shows are filmed in Hawaii, Los Angeles and New York, respectively. Juggling even two shows simultane­ously would be ahandful for anyone, but Abrams continues to balance the Herculean task of guiding these three shows with developing his burgeoning film career. 

The latest installment of the "Mission: Impossible" franchise, last May's "Mission: Impossible 
III," marked Abrams' fea­His Midas touch fold this season. He ture film directorial debut. has crossed the reteamed with Lindelof Critics and the general to pen "A Tale of Two

date, "Lost" continues to be a com­manding force in the ratings and one of the most hotly discussed shows on the air. 
But for both "Lost" fanatics and Abrams himself, it's been far too long since Abrams got his feet wet in the show's writing process. Since co-writ­ing the pilot with Damon Lindelof more than two years ago, Abrams 
finally returned to the 

role as writer and director in redeeming Ethan Hunt from the bullet-repelling caricature he became after John Woo's "M:I II." 
Executive producer and star Tom Cruise handpicked Abrams for the job after inhaling all 22 episodes of the fiist season of "Alias" -also a tense drama revolving around a secretive government agency -in just two days. 
Cruise is just one of many a televi­sion viewer mesmerized by Abrams' knack for serialized drama. Abrams has created or co-created three shows in his career to date -"Felicity," "Alias" and "Lost." And while "Lost" has revitalized serialized storytelling and spawned NBC's "Heroes" and CBS' "Jericho," Abrams hasn't forgot­ten a time when networks were "beg­ging him" to avoid serializing the story in "Felicity" and "Alias." 
As for Abrams' greatest success to 
The next chapter in Abrams' career will involve directing and producing "Star Trek XI," slated to revive the Star Trek franchise in 2008, and possibly directing the sea­son three finale of "Lost." 
Despite constantly having to swap his writer's cap for his director and producer hats, Abrams remains much the same person he was in-Sarah Lawrence College, the writer who would pen his own stories using Alvin Sargent's Academy Award-winning screenplay to "Ordinary People" as a guide. 
His Midas touch has crossed the line separating feature films from televi­sion, perhaps because Abrams recog­nizes the secret to his success better than anyone -it all starts and ends with the story.

"LOST." 

So says the stark, sprawling script across the television screen at the con­clusion of each week's episode of ABC's smash hit. "Lost," however, can describe more than simply the plight of the show's marooned characters. This show uses a formula only recently re­introduced to visual media: the concept of the serial, rather than episodic, tele­vision show. Unfortunately, the fallout between the two types of programs can leave the casual viewer both confused and frustrated. 
The first ap,pearance of the serial goes back to times before the advent of television, when cinemas showed weekly serial programs featuring a protagonist whose adventures always ended in a cliffhanger. Each install­ment of these stories, like those of Hopalong Cassidy or Flash Gordon in the 1930s and '40s, influenced subse­quent episodes in a manner not unlike "Lost" or "24" today. 
With the advent of television came a formula so familiar to modern audi­ences that it needs no introduction ­the episodic sitcom. Shows like "Father Knows Best," "The Donna Reed Show" and others profiled the weekly exploits of a set group of characters, with each installment's action closing off neatly at the episode's conclusion. 
"Friends," "Two and a Half Men" and "Everybody Loves Raymond" and are heirs to this formula today, as they pro­file the ongoing lives of characters through the lens of episodic, encapsu­lated narratives. 
What "Lost" and its co-creators J.J. Abrams and Damon Lindelof have done so thoroughly is bring television back to its roots in the serial films of the '40s and '50s. While most television dramas contain serial elements like general plotlines that arch over multi­ple episodes, they tend to have some degree of the episodic in their execu­tion. 
"Lost," in contrast, gets down to the true roots of serial programming by incorporating complex, multi-episode plotlines, integral details and cliffhang­ers into its structure -tactics that require a significant returning audi­ence week after week. 
It is this aspect of serialized story-

telling that draws in legions of fans. An aware audience might logically seek something intellectually challenging in its entertainment, and serials require some level of smarts in order to simply keep track of the plotlines involved. 
Serials also allow for extensive cre­ativity and character development. Imagine if "Saving Private Ryan" or "Forrest Gump" were 22 hours long­the sheer scope of narrative and artis­tic range in the original two-hour films would be exponentially

prime example. ABC recently launched an interactive web­site, the "Lost Experience," which fea­tures multiple puzzles, clips, links and character profiles in order for viewers to become further engulfed in the show's mysteries. It would seem as though there was no way for a serial's dedicated, returning audience to get enough. 
The problem, then, lies with the patience of that returning audience. Watching "Friends" is simple enough for the casual viewer, even with out­standing plot elements like Rachel's pregnancy or Monica and Chandler's infertility. A brief recap at the opening of each episode is all that a first-time viewer would need, as "Friends" and other sitcoms work and thrive in that week-to-week context. 

Shows like "Lost" and "24," however, require a bit more effort for those try­ing to jump on the bandwagon. As any devout fan of either program will tell these "newbies," it is nearly impossible 
to simply sit down and 
opments. 
Fixing this discrepancy can require hours of effort beyond watching the actual show, such as renting previous seasons on DVD or looking up episode summaries online. In truth, this process seems curiously counter-intu­itive when considering television is by far one of the most sedentary of pur­suits. Should TV require this much effort? 
"Lost" especially plays into this dichotomy between obsession and casual pastime. The world of "Lost" 
has become an ever-expanding phe­nomenon and an increasingly complex web of information. Passing references can return later as critical bits of infor­mation, and it seems that every facet of the show's universe is rapidly evolving and changing. 
For example, one item discovered after the fateful plane crash, a fiction­al, unpublished manuscript entitled "Bad Twin," has recently been pub­lished as an actual book, further adding to the show's already complex mythology. If "Lost" were an episodic program, these possibilities simply would not exist. 
Issues arise for the networks when choosing to invest in serialized pro­grams -particularly in light of rat­ings. From one angle, developing a show with a complicated history and mythology locks in a loyal contingent of fans, which spells out successful rat­ings and a guaranteed audience. "24" is another such program to find suc­cess in this way, as the serialized exploits of Jack Bauer (Kiefer Sutherland) are followed from season to season almost religiously by its dedi­cated viewers. 
Conversely, the accessibility of such programs to new audiences becomes increasingly limited as the show con­tinues its run. Fewer and fewer audi­ence members make the effort to stick around when something like "Lost" becomes too complicated to handle. This kind of problem inevitably limits the capacity for the show's audience to grow and, more practically, for its rat­ings capacity to increase. 
Advertising -dependent on success­ful ratings -is a central factor in the fate of any television show, making this is a real issue with serial program­ming. 
The serialization of television is, as "Lost" demonstrates, a chance for a formerly maligned medium to thrive creatively and stretch its wings. It allows for a complexity of narrative storytelling and a sense of artistic, aes­thetic and thematic achievement is now available for the taking. 
However, viewers -the ultimate capital of a television production -can be lost in the shuffle. How networks will determine the balance between creative storytelling and accessibility remains to be seen.

Associated Press 
NEW YORK -Joe Torre was in his office at Yankee Stadium on Tuesday, about to give the media his sea­son wrapup, when general manager Brian Cashman walked in and handed him his cell phone. 
George Steinbrenner was on the line. 
"He has informed me that I will be here as his manager next year," Torre 
said about  15 minutes  
later.  
And  with  that,  

Steinbrenner ended three days of speculation that followed his team's second straight first-round exit 

from the AL playoffs. 
Ever since Detroit elimi­nated the Yankees on Saturday, reports of Torre's imminent dismissal domi­nated New York media. When Steinbrenner left Monday to return to Tampa, Fla., he said he still hadn't made a decision. 
Would he revert to his old ways, when he changed managers 20 times from 1973-95? Or would he stick with the revered Torre, who led the team to four World Series titles in his first five years but none in the six seasons since? 
"Let's just say that he echoed support and com­
mitment to having me go on in this job," Torre said. "I felt comfortable with the conversation." 
Steinbrenner recounted the talk in a statement issued through spokesman Howard Rubenstein, saying he told Torre: "You're back for the year. I expect a great deal from you and the entire team. I have high expectations, and I want to see enthusiasm, a fighting spirit and a team that works together. Responsibility is yours, Joe, and all of the Yankees. 
"Yes, I am deeply disap­pointed about our loss this year," Steinbrenner added. "We have to do better, and I deeply want a champi­onship. It's about time." 
Since Saturday's loss, Steinbrenner spent his time listening to the advice of his top executives. On Monday, Torre spoke with him about 15-to-20 min­utes, and told him: "If you feel in your heart a change has to be made, go ahead and do it." After that phone call, Torre said he felt more confident he would keep his job. 
All the while, camera crews camped outside Torre's home in suburban Westchester. 
"I thought I had the cure for cancer or something," Torre said. 
IN BRIEF 
Toledo player dies after 
coronary vessel ruptures 
TOLEDO -A Toledo basketball player who collapsed during condi­tioning drills died of a ruptured blood vessel to his heart, according to pre­liminary autopsy results released Tuesday. 
Haris Charalambous, a backup cen­ter for the Rockets, was stricken Monday as players started some light running during a routine workout. His aortic arch ruptured, caused blood to fill the sac around his heart and stopped it from beating, said Dr. James Patrick, Lucas County coroner. 
Several more weeks of testing will be needed to determine what caused the rupture, a well-known cause of sudden death, Patrick said. 
"Even though the emergency response -what our trainers did was great-once the heart can't pump blood because of pressure around it, there's just not a very good likelihood that he is going to live," said Dr. Roger Kruse, team physician. 

NASCAR teammates feud 
after costly wreck 
CHARLOTTE-Here's one thing race fans won't see any time soon: Jimmie Johnson and Brian Vickers buddying up at the track, or any­where else. 
Johnson's anger toward his team­mate and friend had not subsided Tuesday, two days after Vickers wrecked Johnson and Dale Earnhardt Jr. on the final lap at Talladega Superspeedway. 
Johnson spent the bulk of his week­ly conference call avoiding even men­tioning Vickers' name, fmally unload­ing on his teammate about 20 min­utes in when asked if the two had spoken. 
"I got a message from him, but that was about it," Johnson said. "I don't have much to say or much to talk to him about." 
Asked if their relationship had changed, Johnson said he wasn't sure because it had only been two days since the incident. 
'HappY. to be alive,' Jackson 
apologizes to team 
INDIANAPOLIS -Indiana Pacers guard Stephen Jackson is "happy to be alive," after being punched in the mouth and hit by a car during a fight at a strip club in which police say he fired a gun in the air. 
"I want to apologize to my team­mates, to the fans and to this organi­zation," Jackson said Tuesday after his first practice since the fight early Friday. "It was a very unfortunate inci­dent. I definitely take responsibility for my action and everything I've done." 
Team president Larry Bird said he was disappointed, especially because the Pacers are still trying to win their fans back after the brawl with Detroit Pistons fans two years ago. Jackson was suspended 30 games for his part in the brawl. 
"This is a tough one, there's no question about it," Bird said. "We're not very happy with what happened, but we've got to move on and really concentrate on the season."

Rodriguez to stay in pinstripes 
G.M. Cashman denies New York is trying to trade third baseman 

Associated Press 
NEW YORK -Joe Torre will be back with the New York Yankees and it looks as though A-Rod will be, too. 
General manager Brian Cashman said the team had no intention of trading Alex Rodriguez, who failed to drive in a run in the playoffs for the second straight year and was dropped to eighth in the bat­ting order. 
"I fully expect him to be here," Cashman said Tuesday. "We're going to figure this thing out together." 
Earlier, Torre said he would return as manager for his 12th season. 
Rodriguez, who has a no­trade clause in his contract, struggled during his third sea­son with the Yankees and was booed throughout the year by fans at Yankee Stadium. Cashman revealed that teams inquired about Rodriguez's availability up until the July 31 deadline to make trades without waivers. 
"The first one I got hit on was late May, I think, or early June and then it got real heavy in the deadline period," Cashman said. 
Right after Saturday night's loss eliminated the Yankees, Cashman received an e-mail inquiry from a team. 
"I wanted to message back: 'Buzzard,' " Cashman said, adding that he expects to receive more offers during the offseason and intends to turn them down. 
Rodriguez, the reigning AL MVP, hit .290 with 35 homers and 121 RBis, and his 24 errors were the most 'among AL third basemen. He went 1­for-14 (.071) in the first-round playoff loss to Detroit and is 4-for-41 (.098) with no RBis in his last 12 postseason ga,mes. 
In New York, where the Yankees are always in the spotlight, Rodriguez has at times seemed uncomfortable in a clubhouse filled with other big stars. Torre said Rodriguez still feels the need to be the central run-produc­er, even though he has power­ful hitters next to him in the lineup. 
Even in an "off year" for Rodriguez, his run production was among baseball's best. 
"I know there would be interest in him. There's no denying that. He's a very tal­ented player," Cashman said. "Despite the difficult times that he's experienced here, people see the results and know that he's fighting not just the pitcher on the mound, he's fighting a lot more than that at times." 
After the Yankees were eliminated Saturday, Rodriguez said he wanted to 
stay with the team. 
He is owed, in effect, $66.6 million by New York over the last four seasons of his record $252 million, 10-year con­tract. Rodriguez receives $95 million, with the Yankees get­ting $28.4 million from Texas to offset part of that. 
"Alex Rodriguez is one of the important pieces to this puzzle here," Torre said. "He is a human being and there's a lot of times that he's not perceived that way. The fact of the matter is that he'll never be able to be compare9 to other people because, prob­ably, (oD the enormity of his ability." 
Cashman didn't think Rodriguez was angry about being dropped to eighth in the batting order in Game 4. He batted sixth in Games 1 and 2, and cleanup in Game 3. 
"I don't know if there is an issue from Alex's perspective about batting eighth. I haven't talked to him about it," Cashman said. "I know one thing that we try to do is check all egos at the door when it comes to who should play and when they should play, where they bat." 
Scott Buras, Rodriguez's agent, didn't return a call seeking comment. Cashman said if there was lingering dis­agreement, Rodriguez and Torre would have to settle it. 

NCAA FOOTBALL 
Indiana hopes to keep momentum 
Hoosiers look to start Big-1 0 win streak 
Associated Press 
BLOOMINGTON -When Terry Hoeppner met with his team Sunday, he sensed changes. 
Players were more upbeat, more enthusiastic and eager to keep the momentum rolling. 
Saturday's comeback at Illinois counted as only one notch in the win column, but it was clear by Tuesday that the improbable comeback meant much more to the Hoosiers. 
"The sun shines a little brighter and the water tastes a little better after you win," Hoeppner said at his weekly news conference. "I felt good after the game. It was really timely, and, hopefully, that's something we can build on."

Terry Hoeppner 
November 2001 will create a pro­

and an overall three-game skid that threatened to send Indiana's season into a tailspin after a befuddling loss to Wisconsin. 
Instead, the Hoosiers responded by demonstrating their resilience, their toughness and an ability to make the kind of plays Hoeppner anticipated all season. 
It was a refreshing change. 
"It kind of gives you a breath of fresh air," center Justin Frye said. "You get in a slump, you lose some games and that's when you get attacked from the outside. We have to use this to our advantage." 
From smiles to personal encounters and Internet exchanges to awards, the shift has noticeable everywhere players went. 
Austin Starr, who kicked the winning 33-yard field goal, said he's made many new friends around campus over the past several days. 
On Tuesday, kick returner Marcus Thigpen was named the Big Ten's special teams player of the week, marking the first time an Indiana player won that award since punter Drew Hagan on Oct. 31, 1999. 
Thigpen opened the third quarter with a 98-yard kickoff return to give Indiana its first lead against Illinois. 
With 197 return yards, Thigpen also set a school sin­gle-game record as he improved his national leading return average to 41.8 on kick­otis. 
His three return TDs also tied the Big Ten's single-season mark. which was set by Purdue's Stan Brown in 1970, and tied by Michigan State's DeAndra Cobb in 2003. 
Thigpen also rushed for 91 yards Saturday, easily his best effort of the season and the Hoosiers are hoping it's a start. 
"We wanted to establish the running game and we did that," Frye said. "Kellen (Lewis) made the right decisions, and I think it's a confidence-building thing for Marcus." 
It could, in fact, serve as a 
boost for the

ductive week as 
Indiana prepares for one of its biggest challenges of the season against No. 15 Iowa. 
But Hoeppner didn't have to see his players to sense the renewed vigor. 
"I always ask our strength coach how things are going in the weight room because that's a good test," Hoeppner said. 
"He said they were lifting with an extra smile on their face." 
Hoeppner, too, seemed more at ease Tuesday as he explained why he defended his players so passionately over the past cou­ple of weeks. 
"I see how they prepare and work on a daily basis," he said. 
But with the Hoosiers mired in a 25-7 deficit early in the second quarter, it took another pep talk from Hoeppner to get things righted. 
He called his defenders together on the sideline, a rare moment for the second-year coach, and the coaches decided to simplify the coverages. 
The Fighting Illini managed only one more score and put the Hoosiers in position to pro­duce their most significant vic­tory of the season.

McAllister satisfied vvith playing in Bush's shadovv 
Veteran running back quietly makes impact for 4-1 New Orleans with four touchdowns and 433 total yards 
Associated Press 
NEW ORLEANS -Tacklers buckled under the force of his stiff-arm, bounced off his low­ered shoulders and thick, churning legs, or lost their grip on his kicking feet. 
Others couldn't even get a hand on Deuce McAllister as he danced around them and accelerated upfield. 
''I'm pretty good for an older guy," McAllister, in his sixth season but still only 27, said with a confident grin. 
He also is pretty good for someone coming back from reconstructive knee surgery, often a tricky proposition for running backs, who tend to take more of a pounding than quarterbacks or receivers. 
If no one makes a fuss over how strong he's looked this season, the low-key country guy from central Mississippi appears content to continue chewing up yardage with quiet satisfaction. 

"People are going to make their opinion and comments in the way they choose," McAllister said. "It's something I can't control." 
For several years, McAllister has been the face of the New Orleans Saints, his No. 26 jer­sey worn by fans throughout the region. This season, how­ever, the more popular is the No. 25 worn by flashy rookie Reggie Bush, the Heisman Trophy winner whose selection by the Saints in last spring's draft set off an impromptu 
· citywide party for a full week­end. Bush once again grabbed the headlines in last Sunday's 24­21 victory over Tampa Bay with his first NFL touchdown, 
a game-winning 65-yard punt return late in the fourth quar­ter. 
"He can have it," a still grin­ning McAllister said without a moment's hesitation when asked about Bush stealing the spotlight. 
In that same game, McAllister rushed for 123 yards on 15 carries, an aver­age of 8.2 yards per run. His bruising, 57-yard run set up a

Quality In Everything We Do 
field goal. His 24-yard touch­down, during which he danced out of trouble in the backfield, slipped two tackles across the line of scrimmage and then cut sharply into the open field, gave New Orleans its first lead. 
Following the game,  McAllister was coy about the condition of his right knee, which still requires treatment to keep the swelling down after practice and games. 
He calls himself "game ready." 
"It doesn't matter," McAllister said. "I just try to go out there and play whether I'm 100 percent or 85 per­cent." 
Sharing carries with Bush, McAllister has only once bro­ken the 100-yard mark in a game this season. But he has averaged 4.8 yards per carry through five weeks. He also has a team-leading four touch­downs for the Saints, who are off to a surprising 4-1 start and in first place in the NFC South. 
"I knew coming here he was a Pro Bowl running back and a guy that's respected through­out the league," new Saints coach Sean Payton said. 
"The big thing is: How's he coming off of a season with a knee injury? I've been real pleased with everything I've seen, his work ethic. He's got his weight right where it needs to be. He's got his strength. He's playing with intensity. He's practicing well. ... 
"He played fantastic." 
Going by statistics, opposing defenses might be wise to give equal attention to McAllister and Bush, because Payton is balancing the pair's work evenly. McAllister has 79 car­ries and seven receptions for 433 total yards. Bush has 54 rushes and a league-leading 34 receptions for 420 total yards. 
But Bush, who lines up all over the field as either a run­ner or receiver, seems to be more distracting to defenders. Payton has used him as a decoy, sometimes freezing linebackers on fake handoffs to Bush during several of McAllister's runs. 
"Everyone focuses on Reggie, but at the end of the day No. .. 26 is a hell of a football play­er," Tampa Bay cornerback Brian Kelly said. 
McAllister said the fakes to Bush have made it easier for him to read the defensive pur­suit and find open running lanes. 
''I'll take some easy runs if that's what they're going to give me," McAllister said. "The defenses out there, they respect my talents enough. But obviously Reggie has talent as well, so they're definitely going to pay attention to him. 
"So give me a second or two and let me see the reads and I think I can make some plays."

"We are not playing as well as we need to play," Dungy said after Sunday's unimpressive 14­13 win. "It's probably my job to get us better. We will work on · that next week and the follow­ing week." 
Yet it's also possible these strong challenges may be just what Indy needs to eliminate the postseason blues. The Colts have tried it the other way and failed.

Certainly, Dungy doesn't want 1 03-yard kickoff returns forcing Manning to deliver another comeback drive, like he did against the Jets, just to create a mentally tougher team. 
But who would have expected the Colts to be 5-0 under these circumstances: 
-Former NFL sacks champi­on Dwight Freeney has been shut out the first five weeks. 
-Manning, a two-time MVP, has scored as many touchdowns (two) as the wide receiver tan­dem of Marvin Harrison and Reggie Wayne. 
-Former Pro Bowl defensive tackle Corey Simon, the Colts' best run-stuffer, was lost for the season after banging his knee in training camp Aug. 4. 
-Pro Bowl safety Bob Sanders and Adam Vinatieri, the NFL's best clutch kicker, haven't played since Week 2 against Houston because of injuries. 
-They had to contend with another traumatic experience when Wayne's older brother, Hashad, was killed in a traffic accident last month.

''I'm not sure that's ever been done in college competition," Kubinski said. 
Isban was pleased with the hole-in-one and also wasn't dis­appointed with Notre Dame's play. He noted that the Irish defeated four teams that had been ranked higher than Notre Dame entering the tournament. 
Baylor, Florida State, Vanderbilt and Augusta State had each received more votes in the Sagarin Performance Index than the Irish had before the Gridiron Classic. 
"We beat some good teams," lsban said. "For our team to fin­ish second, I was pretty pleased." 
Lamar University ran away with the victory as it carded a 20-over-par 860, 29 strokes ahead of the runner-up Irish. 
"I think we should have been a little more competitive with Lamar," senior captain Cole lsban said. 
Irish coach Jim Kubinski said that, before the event began, he had hoped to finish among the top three this week. 
''I'm happy with [our perform­ance]," Kubinski said. 
He also pointed out that some strong teams played in the event. 
"After the season's over, I think we'll look back and see five or six NCAA [regional-quali­fying] teams," Kubinski said. 
The Irish trailed by 19 shots after the first two rounds Monday. They lost more ground to Lamar Tuesday, which fin­ished No. 8 in last season's Golfstat rankings. 
"We played a little better [Monday]," Kubinski said. "The hole placements were a little tougher for the fmal round and the weather was worse." 

Leading the way for the Irish was Isban, who fmished in sec­ond place after a heartbreaking sequence on the eighteenth hole of the fmal round. 
Lamar's Justin Harding, who was tied with Isban after 53 holes of tournament play, made a 25-yard chip shot to birdie the final hole of the event while Isban watched from the fairway. 
"He had a tough shot and hit it too hard, but it just caught the hole," Isban said. 
Isban, who celebrated his birthday Tuesday, then narrowly missed a long birdie putt that would have put him into a play­
off against Harding. "Cole just missed the putt," Kubinski said. 
Isban recorded a par and fin­ished with a 4-over-par 214, good for a second-place tie with Vanderbilt's Luke List. 
''I'm happy with the way I played," Isban said. "There's not really much you can do about [the close loss]." 
Isban was joined by sopho­more Josh Sandman (+12), sen­ior Adam Gifford (+15), fresh­man Doug Fortner (+18) and junior Mike King (+25) as the top five scorers for the Irish.

Zahm vs. St. Ed's 
Tonight's 8 p.m. game between the Rabid Bats of Zahm (1-2) and the Stedsmen of St. Ed's (0-3) carries different meaning for each team. 
Zahm could advance to the playoffs with a win. St. Ed's doesn't have the same play­off aspirations; instead, it wants to play spoiler. 
The Rabid Bats could be the best comeback story of the year. A team that won last season's championship began this year 0-2, suffer­ing tough losses to Knott and Fisher. But a last-minute drive in the fourth quarter against Siegfried gave Zahm its first win and new hope. A victory tomorrow would pro­pel the Rabid Bats to third place in the Blue Division while a loss would drop them to sixth. 
"A win would be huge because we started 0-2, and the prospects looked pretty bleak," Zahm captain Sean Wieland said. 
The Stedsmen have not fared well so far this season, getting shutout out by the Siegfried, Sorin and Carroll. While the offense has

"We have to win the game with big kickoff returns," St. Ed's captain Ge Wang said. "I think as long as we hit our free throws we'll be fine." 
Wieland is quite aware of the possibility that St. Ed's could stop their season short, citing last year as an example. 
"Our final game last year was against Knott who was winless while we were unde­feated, and it was our tough­est game of the year," he said. "St. Ed's has nothing to lose tomorrow. They want a victory too. We just need to go out and put together four quarters."

Irish coach 
Samardzija's indi­vidual statistics are not as impor­tant as the overall statistics of the top two receivers in the core. 
"I think you really have to group the two receivers togeth­er," Weis said. "Group Jeff and Rhema [McKnight] together compared to Jeff and [2005 Irish starting receiver Maurice Stovall]." 
With McKnight's seven touch­down receptions and Samardzija's five, compared to Samardzija's nine and Stovall's one last season, Weis said he is content with the production. 
On defense, Weis said one of the biggest surprises he saw going over the statistics was the play of middle linebacker Maurice Crum. Playing strong­side linebacker in 2005, Crum had 24 tackles through six games. This season, he has 43 tackles, compared to the 30 tackles 2005 starting middle linebacker Corey Mays had through six games. 
But Weis said the combined statistics of Travis Thomas and Joe Brockington at weak-side linebacker was not as good as the play of 2005 starter Brandon Hoyte. 
"We have had a drop-off sta­tistically at the Will position," Weis said, using the team's pseudonym for the position. "Brandon had a lot more tack­les at the Will position, tackles for loss and sacks at this time, than we have right now.... Brandon would have a signifi­cant edge at that Will position 
Derek Landri at 
defensive tackle. 
Laws had nine tackles in the first six games of 2005 compared to 32 now. Landri went from 16 to 24. Ndukwe also has compiled far more tackles in 2006, going from 24 to 43 through six con­tests. 
"As I've talked about people who have played better, it's pretty obvious when you looked at [Ndukwe]," Weis said. 
Notes: 
+ Weis said Notre Dame coaches will use four of their allotted six in-season days off campus over the next two weeks for recruiting purposes. According to Weis, two of those days will be Thursday and Friday. 
"Now, some of [the coaches] will get to see a game on Thursday and a game on Friday," Weis said. "Some of the guys will just go to schools on Thursday and go to schools on Friday and see a game. Some of those guys will see two games on Friday where there's an afternoon game on Friday and there's a night game on Friday. But the coaching staff will be out." 
NCAA regulations allow only seven of 10 coaches on a coaching staff to be off campus recruiting at any one point. To maximize efficiency, Weis said he will employ a technique known as "tag-teaming" to con­nect recruits with specific coaches. 
"I need [defensive coordina­tor] Rick [Minter] here on Thursday," Weis said. "He'll go on the road for Friday, [and] [defensive line coach Jappy] Oliver will come off the road on Friday so that Coach Minter can get into his area for a full day." 

+Weis said he is experiment­ing with the possibility of fresh­men kickers Ryan Burkhart or Nate Whitaker taking Notre Dame's field goal attempts of more than 40 yards. Senior kicker Carl Gioia is 0-of-2 from that distance. 
"We're going to take a look at Burkhart; we're going to take a look at Whitaker," Weis said. "Let those guys kick from 40 to 50, see what it looks like." 
+Weis said a group of stu­dents tried to steal his golf cart during the weekend of the Notre Dame-Purdue game. 
"The most interesting [expe­rience] I've had so far were guys on reunion weekend try­ing to steal my golf cart at 4:30 in the morning coming back from the bars," Weis said. "I looked at them and I said, 'What the hell are you doing?' [They said,] 'We're trying to steal the golf cart.' I said, 'It's mine."' 
"I actually put them on my golf cart and drove them over to the dorm and piled them into a garbage can, got them back there."

Internal assessment 
Weis evaluates team at halfway point of season, singles out squad's best performers 
By KEN FOWLER Sports Ediror 
Charlie Weis is happy to have a bye week. 
In his weekly press conference Tuesday, Weis said he will use the week off to continue recruit­ing, rest injured players and look deeper into position and personnel battles. 
But, of course, it all started with statistics for the number­crunching coach. 
Weis went through nearly every major statistic and com­pared it to Notre Dame's per­formance up to this point of the 2005 season. And what he saw were generally close correla­tions. 
Weis noted that Irish quarter­back Brady Quinn's completion percentage through six games in 2006 (63.5) is "almost identical" to his percentage in 2005 (63.6). Quinn has thrown for two more touchdowns (16) this season but 45 yards a game (273) and one interception (4) less. 
"He's statistically done a little bit better job because of the 16­to-4 touchdown interception versus a 14-to-5 touchdown interception at the same time last year," Weis said. 
Weis noted that running back Darius Walker, who is averaging 88 rushing yards per game this season compared to 100 a year ago, has far more receiving yardage than he did in 2005. Walker has 38 catches for 258 yards in 2006. He had 21 recep­tions for 159 yards at this point

Green Wave hopes to drown Vermin 
Fisher, Carroll set to determine No. 1 seed for upcoming playoffs 
By MATT HOPKE Sports Writer 
The regular season's last night features a clash of the unbeatens as the Green Wave of Fisher (3-0) and the Vermin of Carroll (3-0) will meet tonight at 7 on Riehle Field. 
The winner will capture the regular season title in the Blue Division and the No. 1 seed in the playoffs. 
Adding to the significance of this game is the bad blood between the two teams. The Green Wave views the contest as a chance to reverse last year's 28-0 drubbing at the hands of the Vermin. 
"Carroll beat us pretty badly last year," Fisher captain Tom Bupalino said. "They're a big rival for us. We've lost to them the past two years, so every­one is pretty motivated for the game." 
The Vermin have impressed so far this season, outscoring their opponents 48-6 and recording two shutouts. The
