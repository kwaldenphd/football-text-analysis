SMC tuition increase to grolV for 2006-07 
Students express dissatisfaction with rising tuition bill; College credits inflation, high costs 
LAURA BAUMGARTNER 
News Writer 
As costs and inflation continue to rise, tuition increases will once again lighten Saint Mary's students' pockets next year. 
The March 21 announcement of a planned five percent increase in tuition and fees and three percent increase in room and board at the College has raised concern among students across campus. 
The Board of Trustees considered the proposed increase at meetings on Feb. 23 and 24, and voted to approve a greater change in tuition than it origi­nally planned. The average cost of attendance for a resident student will rise from $32,538 this year to $34,005 next year. 
"A three-percent increase in the room and board rate is the amount used in the multi-year projections we utilize as part of our planning process," Vice President of Finance and Administration Laurie Stickelmaier said. "We had originally projected a four percent increase in tuition, but substan­tial increases in utilities and benefits costs last year moved the Board to approve an increase of five percent." 

Though some students are concerned about the increasing cost of attending Saint Mary's, Stickelmaier said rising inflation rates and expenses incurred by the College have rendered the increase inevitable. 
"Saint Mary's, like colleges and uni­versities across the country, raises tuition and fees in an effort to keep pace with inflation and stay operationally strong," Stickelmaier said.

Alleged assault reported 
SMC says NDSP will lead investigation 
By AMANDA MICHAELS 
News Editor 
A Saint Mary's student was allegedly sexually assaulted on Notre Dame's campus late Friday evening or early Saturday morn­ing, according to an e-mail sent to Saint Mary's students Monday morning by Vice President of Student Affairs linda Timm. 
In the e-mail, Timm said the alleged victim had "just informed" College officials of the situation and "all campus services have been offered to [the alleged vic­tim] for her support and [Saint Mary's] will continue to provide assistance to her throughout her healing process." 
The alleged victim went to the hospital for "appropriate medical attention," the e-mail said, though information on when that visit occurred was not made available to The Observer. 
Saint Mary's spokeswoman Melanie McDonald would not comment on the details of the sit­uation, noting the investigation of the alleged incident is now in the hands of Notre Dame Security/Police (NDSP). 
"Saint Mary's responsibility was to issue a warning e-mail to stu­dents about what had been reported to us, and we did that," McDonald said. "Saint Mary's also has the responsibility to offer all the support we can to the student who came to us, and right now we are doing all we can for her." 
NDSP associate director Phil Johnson said NDSP is currently investigating the report of an alleged sexual assault that

Professor lectures on moral disagreement, Natural Law 

By BECKY HOGAN News Writer 
Renowned Notre Dame phi­losophy professor Alasdair Macintyre questioned 13th cen­tury Catholic theologian Thomas Aquinas' idea of the universality of primary precepts -morals such as honesty, the preservation of human life and respect for others' property ­at a lecture delivered to a near­ly-packed hall Monday. 
"My aim is to open up ques­tions, not to secure agreement," Macintyre said. "I hope to leave you more troubled." 
While Aquinas' Natural Law teaches that primary precepts are the same for all individuals and should therefore be obeyed by everyone, Macintyre said Natural Law is questionable because it suggests people should find a greater sense of uniformity and agreement con­cerning issues of morality. 
Macintyre examined dispari­ties in Aquinas' argument caused by five types of moral disagreement varying approaches to upholding human life, instances of tor­ture, human sexuality, honor and loyalty and economic fair­ness. 
"Rationality requires being together with other people," Macintyre said. "[When we engage in dialogue with others] we find that we disagree radi­cally. We should treat solitary deliberation as always resulting in error. Rationality is essen­tially social." 
Macintyre is recognized inter­nationally for his contributions to moral philosophy. His pub­lished books include "After Virtue," "Whose Justice? Which Rationality?," "Three Rival Versions of Moral En9uiry" and "Dependent Rational Animals." He has also taught at Oxford. Princeton, Duke and Vanderbilt. 
The lecture "Moral Disagreement" -was part of the Scholar in the Classroom lecture series sponsored by the Kaneb Center for Teaching and Learning.

Lesson One: K!wping Your Business Wlwre Your Business Belongs. Now, you might think that since we am eol­lege students that by this stage or our lives we would fully understand the purpose of toilets and urinals. The evi­dnncn we leave bnhind however, could load people to belinve othnrwise. 
This lnsson is a simpln one, but you will bn tested later so if you feel it is neeessary please tako notns. 
First. them is only onn plaec to go number two -this may seem like common snnsn, but believe mn for sonw people this eom~ept is still a mys­tnry -and that placn is in the toilnt. That's right I said IN tho toilet. not nnar tho toilet on the floor, or on tho toilet seat, but actually IN the toilet. (And af'tnr that you flush. But, let's not get ahnad of ourselves hero -flushing is a later lesson). 
Sncond, numbnr one also belongs IN the toilet. Little dribbles on the seat will rnsult in a lowering of your grade. There's paper in the bathroom for a reason, crumple some up (unless you're a folder, then by all means fold) and put it to good usn. No one likes a wet seat. 
Lnsson Two: These Aren't Bedpans, They Do Actually Flush. There has been somo confusion around campus about this subject, so we are going to dear this situation up early. Yes, some of tho toilets are old and don't have the power of a Flush-o-matic 2006, but that shiny silver handle-like object on tho baek of the toilet dons serve a pur­posn. It's not just them to make thfl toi­let look pretty. While it might require morn than one push, the little guys can get the job donn and remove any unsightly material that might be occu­pying the bowl. 
Well. we're running short on time hem and I don't want to overwhelm anyone on the first day. Quick review of the key eoneopL'i and then class will bn dismissed. Hemnmbnr the key con­cepts here are "in the toilet" and "flush." 
Praetice makes pnrfect, people, so get out there and use your new found knowledge.

Go to bed married, wake up divorced 
NEW DELIII -A Muslim eouple in India has been told by local Islamie leaders they must separate after the hus­band "divorced" his wife in his sleep, the P.ress Trust of India reported. 
Sohela Ansari told friends that her husband Aftab had uttered the word "talaq," or divorce, three times in his sleep, aceording to the report published in newspapers Monday. 
When local Islamic leaders heard, they said Aftab's words constituted a divorce under an Islamic procedure known as "triple talaq." The couple, married for 11 years with three children, were told they had to split. 
The religious leaders ruled that if the couple wanted to remarry they would have to wait at least 100 days. Sohela would also have to spend a night with another man and be divorced by him in turn. 
The couple, who live in the eastern state of West Bengal, have refused to obey the order and the issue has been referred to a loeal family counseling center.

BOARD OF GOVERNANCE 
Nevv officers take over 
By LIZ HARTER News Writer 
Student government officers said goodbye to senior leaders and welcomed fresh faces at the Saint Mary's Board of Governance (BOG) meeting Monday night at the second floor of the Student Center. 
The transition meeting took place with all members of the old BOG board present so the new board could get a better under­standing for how the meetings operate, student body president Kellye Mitros said. 
"This is a little bit different [than normal]. but you guys get the idea," Mitros said. 
Student body president-elect and current student body vice president Susan Mcllduff intro­duced the new board members who will officially take their posi­tions at next week's meeting. 
Mcllduff and vice president­elect Maggie Siefert have appointed 16 of the 23 board members, seven of whom they introduced at the meeting. These board members will be presiding along with Seifert over the BOG meetings during the 2006-07 school year. 
After introducing the new board members, current Residence Hall Association presi­dent Jackie Wright reminded members the Dance Marathon is taking place April 21 from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. the following morning. 
"It is 10 dollars per dancer, but you do get a free t-shirt," Wright said. 
Dancer sign-up packets are due by Friday afternoon, freshman class president Francesca Johnson said. 
At the end of the meeting, Mitros became tearful as she addressed the board for the last time as president. 
"I just wanted to say thank you to all of you ... from the bottom of my heart for making this such a wonderful experience for me." Mitros said. 
In other BOG news 
+"We already started our Facebook ads, and tickets are 'already being sold [for the Saint Mary's Tostal]," Student Activities Board [SAB] president Megan Cahill said.

COUNCIL OF REPRESENTATIVES 


Group concentrates on transition 
By KATHLEEN McDONNELL News Writer 
At the final Council of Representatives (COR) run by the current student govern­ment administration Monday night on the second floor of LaFortune, members dis­cussed the year's operations and approved a number of key council members for next year's term. 
The meeting focused on transition, as COR members evaluated this year's progress and planned for the student government turnover April 1. 
Student body president Dave Baron thanked council members for their time and effort, and cited the differ­ence COR has made this year in student government, par­ticularly in the area of com­munity relations. 
He then opened the floor to suggestions as to how the Baron administration could have done a better job run­ning student government. 
Representatives praised the administration's progress and offered suggestions to improve relations with the entire student body in the face of increasing apathy. Topics of discussion included ideas for improved campus stall notes, a general student homepage with links to all aspects of student govern­ment and programming and 
more open student govern­ment meetings in order to increase student input. 
President-elect Lizzi Shappell said increasing stu­dent participation by holding public student government meetings is a central part of her platform. She said stu­dents could expect to see this in the upcoming 
paign. Campus voter partici­pation is approximately 50 percent, she said, and she proposed a number of initia­tives with the goal of 67-per­cent participation in the next election.

A-wareness -week to address sexual assault 
By RYAN SYDLIK News Writer 
Notre Dame studnnt govern­ment has dubbed this week Sexual Assault Awareness Week, and has planned several featured events to edueate University students about sexual assault and other gender rela­tions topies. 
The Senate Gender Issues Committee, chaired by Ali Wishon, is responsible for plan­ning the week. 
This is the second year for the event, whieh began when Senate Gender Issues Committee then-ehairperson Lizzi Shappell was ehargnd with starting an awareness week challenging the campus to think about issues of sexual assault. 
The first flagship events marking this year's week is "Dating, Helating and the Hook­up Culture," a performance in which FIHEStarter peer eduea­tors p'erform sketches and involve audience membnrs in a presentation designed to address campus relationship and sexual assault issues. The first event took place in Pangborn Hall Monday night and the second will take place tonight at 9:15 p.m. in Farley IIall. 
The play "Sex Signals: The Heal Life, Funny, Sort-of lmprov Show about Dating and Other Stuff" is an educational play about issues of sexual assault and date rape relating to the college experience to be per­formed Tuesday at 9 p.m. in the Hesburgh Library's Carey Auditorium. 
"Must Sex T.V.," is a video showing that will take place Thursday, March 30 in various residence halls. 
The video uses childhood tele­vision shows to "assess how we may have been exposed to gen­der stereotypes and sexual assault in our favorite pro­grams," Shappell said. 
Shappell said those interested in watching the video should talk to their hall president for more information about show­ings. 
In addition to specific events, Sexual Assault Awareness Week is related to the launch of the newly created Men Against Violence (MAY) group, a Gender Relations Committee (GRC) task force composed of men commit­ted to ending sexual violence and domestic abuse. 
"Student Government Sexual Assault Awareness Week has brought together the Student Senate Gender Relations Committee and the Gender Relations Center (GRC), in addi­tion to many generous sponsors, to offer programs and aware­ness campaigns," Shappell said.

Raid stifles Iraqi government talks 
BAGHDAD -Shiite politicians raged at the United States and halted negotiations on a new government Monday after a military assault . killed at least 16 people in what Iraqis claim was a mosque. Fresh violence erupted in the north, with 40 killed in a suicide bombing. 
The firestorm of recrimination over Sunday's raid in northeast Baghdad will likely make it harder for Shiite politicians to keep a lid on their more angry followers as sectarian violence boils over, with at least 150 dead since Sunday. A unity government involving Shiites, Sunnis and Kurds is a benchmark for American hopes of starting to withdraw troops this summer. 
The U.S. military said in a statement that "no mosques were entered or damaged during this operation." It said the raid targeted a building used by "insurgents responsible for kidnapping and execution activities." 
Afghan convert evades death penalty 
KABUL -An Afghan man who faced the death penalty for converting from Islam to Christianity has appc!iled for asylum in another country, the United Nations said Monday after hundreds of Muslims marched against a court's decision to dismiss his case. 
Afghan oiTicials did not say whether Abdul Rahman had been released after the case against him was dismissed Sunday, but the U.N. statement came amid unconfirmed reports that he was being freed. 
"We do understand that he will be released," State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said in Washington.

Panel clears immigration legislation 
WASHINGTON -The Senate Judiciary Committee approved election-year immigra­tion legislation Monday that clears the way for millions of undocumented wbrkers to seck U.S. citizenship without having to first leave the country. 
After days of street demonstrations that stretched from California to the grounds of the U.S. Capitol, the committee also voted to strip out proposed criminal penalties for ref?­idents found to be in this country illegally. 
The panel's vote cleared the way for the full Senate to begin debate Tuesday on the emotional immigration issue. 
"All Americans wanted fairness and they got it this evening," said Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, the Massachusetts Democrat who played a pivotal role in drafting the legisla­tion, approved 12-6. 

Disguised mother abducts children 
ROANOKE RAPIDS, N.C. -A mother charged with abducting her two children was accused of posing as a man while on the run, and authorities say the heavyset woman with cropped hair and a slight mustache even had the kids calling her "Daddy." 
Shellie White, 30, said it was all a misun­derstanding, claiming in a jail interview with The Associated Press that she never tried to hide her identity or change her appearance. 
White was arrested in Roanoke Rapids on Friday, more than two years after she allegedly took her children from Arizona when they were 3 and 5. Investigators said she and another woman were living together as the children's father and mother.

U.N. rights commission closes 
New Human Rights Council plans to set tougher standards for member countries 
Associated Press 
GENEVA -The discred­ited U.N. Human Rights Commission held its last meeting Monday before being replaced by a new body, ending a 60-year his­tory in which some of the world's worst offenders often used their member­ship to protect one another from condemnation. 
Peruvian Ambassador Manuel Rodriguez Cuadros, chairman of the 53-nation commission, gaveled the final session to an end in a packed meet­ing hall at U.N. offices in Geneva as young cam­paigners took photographs and lamented the loss of a rights forum they said was unfairly disparaged. 
The new 4 7 -member Human Rights Council will hold its first meeting June 19 in Geneva and the U.N. General Assembly will vote on new members May 9. 

The commission, which originally was inspired by the United States, came to be discredited in recent years because it admitted countries with terrible human rights records ­such as Sudan, Libya, Zimbabwe and Cuba ­who tried to shield each other from censure.

continued from page 1 
Centlw has put posters up around campus that show campus leaders committed to ending violence for Sexual A-;sault Awareness Week. 
Graduate student Alex Chap11aux. f(JUnding member and co-adviser of MAV, sat outside South Dining llall Sunday night to encourage men to sign the pledge against rape and other violence. The pledge campaign will contin­ue at both dining halls through Tuesday night. 
"Our main goal is to ... educate men and to redefine masculinity in a positive way," he said. 
The idea to organize a ta.<;k force featuring men talking to other men about sexual assault grew out of a conference at DePauw University attended by Heather 

Tuition 
continued from page 1 
Despite the logic behind the increase, online campus forums have been flooded with unsatis­fied student reactions spurring debates about the reasons for and necessity of the decision. 
"It can be understood, to a degree, why increases arc made," sophomore Mary Catenacci said. "But it is faulty policy, given the economie climate, for students to bear the brunt of increased administrative expenditures, some [of which! may bn question­able in validity." 
While students recognize the influence of economic changes on the cost of attending college, soph­omore Erin Scott said the reality of student loans and the incurred debt many students will face after ~:,rraduation has created a negative pen:eption of ri-;ing costs. 
"Scott doesn't understand why the tuition increase is so large each year. 
"I am faced with the very real prospect of quite a lot of debt," Seott said. "The current issue of rising tuition costs does absolutely nothing to ease my worries." 
Questions have also been raised about the effect the increase will have on enrollment and the diver­sity of studenl'> who will consider Saint Mary's as an option ­something the College has strug­gled with in recent years. 
Senior Stephanie Mason said Hakoczy, director of the Gender Relations Center, student body president Dave Baron, student body vice president Lizzi Shappell in April. 

Men are often uncomfortable talking about violence against women in the manner in which it is usually presented, Chapeaux said. 
"The issues have always been approached from a woman's approach -women telling men what's right and what's wrong," he said. 
Hakoczy said the use of male leadership could be instrumental in decreasing the incidence of rape and sexual assault. 
"Women have been doing this work . . . since the women's move­ment in the '70s ... but when it comes down to it, men are the ones who hold the special power in this culture," she said. "In order for the violence to actually end, it 
tuition increases are nothing for­eign to her, as they have occurred annually since her freshman year. She expressed concerned, howev­er, that the most recent change will be taking it too far. 
"Before we know it, the [num­ber) of students here will probably decrease because tuition plus room and board are going to hit the roof and be too expensive for most students to afford," Mason said. 
Stickelmaier said she did not believe the increase would have a negative impact on enrollment. 
"As a tuition-driven institution, the money will fund basic operat­ing costs at the school," Stickelmaier said. 
The Saint Mary's tuition increases also compare favorably to those at other colleges and uni­versities across the nation, she said. 
"Based on a recent analysis, the average tuition increase for selected private institutions last year was 6.2 to 6.4 percent. The tuition increase at Saint Mary's is also significantly below the rate of increase at many public colleges across the country, which can reach the double digits." 
Next year's increase will be higher than the four-percent rise in tuition and three-percent rise in room and board students paid this year, but the change will still be below increases made at other institutions, she said.

IN BRIEF 

Biomet CEO resigns, stays consultant 
CHICAGO -Biomet Inc. said Monday that Dane Miller -co-founder, president and chief executive of the orthopedic products-maker ­has resigned and is retiring after nearly 30 years leading the company. 
The Warsaw, Ind.-based company said its board named General Counsel and Senior Vice President Daniel Hann as interim CEO and presi­dent. Biomet will consider internal and external candidates to fill the top executive post, and has­n't set a timeframe for making a decision. 
"It's difficult to predict how long that process will take," Hann said in an interview. 
Miller, 60, will remain a Biomet director and will serve as a consultant. He is one of Biomet's four founders and has been president, CEO and a director since the company's formation in 1977. Hann. 50, has been with Biomet since 1989 as an officer and director. 

Metals soar amid silver trade rumors 
NEW YORK -Silver rose to a .new 19-year high Monday, prompting a rise in other precious met­als as buyers poured in amid anticipation of final approval for a silver exchange-traded fund. 
The May silver contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange reached $10.94 an ounce Monday, then later settled at $10.895 an ounce, up 16 cents. 
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has approved the first part of the ETF proposal for trading on the American Stock Exchange. The market is awaiting final approval as the SEC goes through a registration transaction period. A for­mal launch date is not yet known. 
Silver's buying momentum did run into some profit-taking late in the session, but the white metal is widely expected to extend its rise. 
Analyst<; at MKS Finance said it expects silver to challenge major resistance at $11 an ounce, due to thH strong anticipation of the silver ETF listing. The rally in silver spilled over into the gold market where the most active April gold settled the day up $6.90 at $567.40 an ounce. Earlier, the con­tract reached a three-week high of $568.60 an ounce. 
Spot gold rose $7 to $567 an ounce. 
The most active April platinum contract settled $16.90 higher at $1,068.50 an ounce. Earlier, the contract rose to a 5 1/2-week high of$1,072.

Jimi llendrix's stunning and unorthodox version of 'The Star Spangled Banner' is rife with truth and beauty concerning the nature of existence. It is particularly poignant for the times in which we live, and indeed offers much knowledge . about statecraft and power for any age. llendrix's version, although made l~tmous by his Aug. 18, 1969 Woodstock performance, was a concert staple as far back as the fall of 1968 and was played into the summer of 1970. The song was symbolic of the entim spirit of the age and generation. 
Jimi's 'Star Spangled Banner' is a mael­strom of sonic power that instantly grips the listener with shrilly-sustained notes, wailing feedback, and loud distortion. The tflrrible sounds of war are reproduced by llendrix's guitar, and his genius. One can hear .Jimi's Stratocaster belting out the simulated sounds of guns and bombs whistling through the air-indeed a skill llendrix would later perfect in the song 'Machine Gun.' As I once heard 'The Star Spangled Banner' described, it seems to be a hulking behemoth that appears to be collapsing under its own burden. 
The state of American society was reflected in Hendrix's song. The nation was torn apart by civil unrest and the Vietnam War. America, like the great 
. dying beast that is Jimi's rendition, seemed to be falling apart at the seams due to her own exertions. This was a quite apt critique of the times and indeed, had change not occurred, America very well might have fallen into chaos. What makes Jimi's song a more apt criticism is that he did not intend for it to be a politi­cal statement. During his appearance on the Dick Cavett Show, Jimi responded to 

Ian Ronderos 
Liberated 

being pressed about the nature of his 
song by stating, "I thought it was beauti­
ful." The song was a manifestation and 
interpretation of the spirit flowing 
through the air. It was spontaneous and 
real; as such, it contains an honest inter­
pretation of this spirit, whether Jimi 
intended it or not. 
America changed so that the spirit embodied in the apocalyptic version was not borne out, and society stabilized. It would do Americans well to listen careful­ly to Jimi's version now, as America is heading down a similar path of discord and unrest. The state of afl'airs has not yet plunged Americans into the same level of discontent that was present in the latn­1960s, but things are clearly progressing towards that end. American foreign policy has become increasingly aggressive and arrogant. The mligious right is making an attack upon the secular nature of our gov­ernment, which our Deist founders deter­mined to be an essential part of the republic. Civil liberties are being eroded in the name of national security. Ire is growing for many. Many others buy into our government's policy, which makes a culture dash more than imminent. 
The essential problem that confronts us is power. America is the strongest nation in the world, and this has begun to play with our leaders. We understand that we can vent our strength more efl'ectively than any of the other powers in order to achieve what we will. Sometimes this is effected for the betterment of mankind, and other times it is effected for our advantage. This arbitrariness has created resentment domestic and abroad. The government ha..<; decided to rule in such a manner as to increase the prosperity of America as an institution, and the nation is conceived of as an abstract concept, rather than a collection of unique individ­uals. It is their conception of this abstract idea and the desire for its promulgation that has led to politicians' current fetish for foreign adventurism. 
Power is the same problem for Jimi's 'Star Spangled Banner.' !lis guitar screams and wails to point of breaking. The sheer sonic explosion can no longer contain itself and the song becomes liter­ally too strong to sustain its sharply vio­lent trajectory. The song descends into sonic dissonance and chaos. A'i stated above this is the same problem that con­temporary America is facing. The more the nation forcibly imposes itself upon the individual and upon the world at large, the more backlash it creates. America puts pressure upon the common bonds that link all people and nations together; this is a tension that cannot last. 
The solution can be found in the life and music of Jimi Hendrix. lie was a man who based his life upon love. This quotation of his best explains his outlook on life: "When the power of love overcomes the love of power the world will know peace." That is the answer; individuals need to make a personal change so that they look upon the world as what it is and affirm the beauty and love found within it. This leads tel'an appreciation lilr the common bond all people share. Everything and everyone is beautiful, because they are all contained within the same existence. Jimi Hendrix understood tlw power of all­encompassing love. When more people can feel this, they will make political change, just a..<> the 1960s generation did. Jimi's life was tragically short and maybe the· world cannot endure men like him, but I sure hope it can.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
U.S. Army doesn't honor ROTC contract 
I wanted to follow up on Gary Caruso's March 24 article, "Examining the decline of President Bush." 
I am the Notre Dame '96 alum who was refer­enced in the article as having filed a lawsuit in fed­eral court against the U.S. Army because they would not honor my contract. I signed a ROTC con­tract at Notre Dame in August of 1992 while I was 18 years old. In return for a partial scholarship, I was to serve eight years in the Army or Army Heserve. 
I enjoyed the time I spent in the Army Reserve, but quickly realized that it wasn't going to be a career for me. After my eight year service obliga­tion was completed, I resigned my commission. My resignation request was denied. I have resigned five times in the last two years and am approaching 10 years of service on an eight-year contract. I am now 32 years old and the contract that I signed as an 18-year~old at Notre Dame still affects my daily life. I have been told by Army reserve personnel that I can be retained until I am 50! 
A month after I filed a federal lawsuit, I was transferred to a reserve unit in North Carolina (I am from Massachusetts) for the sole purpose of involuntary mobilization to Iraq. I am to be mobi­lized on April 28 if my motion for a preliminary. injunction fails in federal court. 
I am confident that I will prevail in my federal suit, as four other officers who previously filed law­suits were successful. After the cases were filed and motions were made, the officers were granted their Honorable Discharges before going to trial. Unfortunately, these cases cannot be having a posi­tive effect on recruiting. I don't know of many 18­year-olds who want to make what they think is an eight-year decision but is slanted so that it directs the rest of their lives. I just hope that my suit results in a fifth Honorable Discharge. 
On Sept. 6, 2004, after my second res­ignation was denied. I contacted both Father Edward Malloy and Father John Jenkins asking them for help in dealing with the Army, as the eight-year ROTC contracts being signed on Notre Dame's campus didn't appear to be really eight-year contracts according to the Army or the Department of Defense. Since Notre Dame provides the Department of Defense with hundreds of new officers annually (and since the Secretary of the Army is also an ND alum), I thought that Notre  Dame would try to protect its stu­dents and alums against these deceitful practices that I described to the then­President and President-elect. 

I received no response from then-President Malloy. I called his office and faxed a copy of my letter to him since he wasn't receiving e-mails. I did receive a response from Jenkins, who explained as President-elect, he didn't feel he had the authority to intervene in this situation and this was a con­tract that I entered into with the Army. At the time, I thought Jenkins' explanation was fair as he hadn't been elevated to President. However, my opinion changed on Nov. 30, 2004 when I found out that Jenkins, not yet the university president, was a cat­alyst in the firing of Tyrone Willingham, another 
contract controversy. I felt that his lack of authority explanation was insincere. At the very least, Malloy or Jenkins could have asked someone from the Notre Dame legal team or law school to review the contracts being signed 
on campus to ascertain whether I was correct or to point out that 
in accordance with Page X, paragraph Z of the contract, the Army could actually keep me until I was 50. If I was cor­rect, the University could have initiated a dialogue with the Department of Defense 
demanding that the terms on ROTC contracts be honored. Otherwise, the University could threaten to reconsider its relation­ship with all of its ROTC programs. As Jenkins promotes "Catholic char­
acter," should he also not look out for the 18-year-old students who might not realize that their signatures could bind them until they are 50? It seems immoral and downright wrong for the University to turn a blind eye to its students and alums as the Department of Defense turns an eight­year contract into a 28-year contract. To me, deceitful language by the military seems a lot more harmful to the students at Notre Dame than watch­ing the Vagina Monologues.

It's time to get your Irish up 

Alas, it had to happen. The one Irishman without a sense of humor crawled out of his personal bog of self­regard and registered his disapproval of an athletic mascot. How noble, how original. 
Well, let me establish my bona fides too: I am Irish-American, a citizen of this great country and Ireland, by virtue of my parents' birth. Growing up in Brooklyn as a child of the urban working class, I can state to the super­cilious Richards that the moniker "Fighting Irish" represents more than a slur. It represents a measure of pride in what William Butler Yeats called the "indomitable Irishry." 
It also represents the survival of a. people who were relegated to the dust­bin of history by their colonial masters. And finally, it represents an ironical appreciation of the role history forced upon us. 
When G.K. Chesterton wrote his mas­terful aesthetic biography of George Bernard Shaw he attributed certain characteristics to Mr. Shaw that proved his status as an Irishman. Indeed, Shaw was a friend of Chesterton and reveled in the portrait. One of these characteristics was a ferocity of inten­tion and a clarity of result. As the great Gilbert Keith wrote: 
"This is probably why the Irishman succeeds in such professions as require a certain crystalline realism, especially about results. Such profes­sions are the soldier and the lawyer; these give ample opportunity for crimes, but not much for mere illu­sions. If you have composed a bad opera you may persuade yourself that it is a good one; if you have carved a bad statue you can think yourself bet­ter than Michelangelo. But if you have lost a battle you cannot believe you have won it; if your client is hanged you cannot pretend that you got him off." 
So, Richards, earn your kudos else­where. You do not understand what it means to be Irish. I rest confident in the knowledge that if this letter upsets you, then I have proven my point. 
Michael Ryan class of 1975 March 24 

'Irish' is an ethnicity, not a race 
I find that recent letters decrying the athletic moniker "Fighting Irish" contain factual inaccuracies and suggest that people may have misplaced priorities. 
First, I was not aware that the citizens of Ireland (and their descendants) were a distinctive race of humans. Yes, "Fighting Irish" may be perceived as an ethnic slur, but it is not racist. Second, what would these protesters prefer for an athletic nickname? How about the "Athletically Gifted Irish"? Perhaps in years wheil the teams were not performing well, we could call them the "Athletically Challenged Irish." 
If it's any reference to Irish that gets them ired (hmmm... I wonder if there's any connection between ire and Ireland; probably not, but it does make one wonder), then all that's necessary is to change Irish to something else. How about the "Fighting Student Athletes from the University of Notre Dame"? There's a catchy name. 
In case my point isn't getting through, consider other athletic nicknames: Fighting Saints, Fighting Quakers and Fighting Bishops. I don't think any­one seriously considers these ethnic or religious slurs. In fact, there's some­thing catchy, almost poetic, about the oxymorons. Or do you really believe that "Great Danes" (University of Albany) is an ethnic slur that I should consider offensive to my paternal heritage? After all, Great Dane implies dog, and we all know what dog connotes when applied to a human. Speaking for my maternal side (German-Irish), I am not the least offended by "Fighting Irish." Perhaps that's because I recognize "Fighting Irish" for what it is -an athletic nickname that says nothing about people of Irish origin. 
Dr. Richard Jensen Professor ofbiology Saint Mary's March 27 



What's in a name? 
A note from an outside observer to the President of Notre Dame in regard to recent remarks made about freedom of speech: 
The sponsors of the football program at Notre Dame have "many laudable goals;" howev­er, Ifail to see how the annual performance, at a multi-million dollar cost to the University, is an "appropriate means to these ends." I fail to see how it in any way conforms to the development of a "scholarly temperament" or nurture a "very distinct intellectual charac­ter." I am not entirely sure what "sacred values" it upholds in comparison to other value­promoting exercises on a college campus, such as enthusiastic student productions of con­temporary plays or alternative film festivals. Indeed, it could be argued in many ways that the football program at Notre Dame is clearly "at odds with" or "egregiously contrary to or inconsistent with certain fundamental values of a Catholic University." Thus I would "invite you to consider" that "wide publicity and prominence given such events," through mone­tarily enriching television network contracts, is hardly a way to "instrumentalize" the "col­lective identity" and "higher meaning" of a Catholic University. I am most concerned about the meaninglessness of the "community and culture" centered on entertainment and other false values it "strives to create." Therefore, I invite you to consider the witness of one Telemachus, a fourth-century monk who met his death at the hands of an angry crowd because he dared to challenge the legitimacy and sacred value of the gladiatorial games of his era and to abandon the current obsession with what may be faddish artistic experimen­tations which nonetheless leave much of value in their wake. Perhaps in truth the problem simply lies in the label. The emotion-eliciting appellations given to either "The Vagina Monologues" or a "Queer Film Festival" may just as well get in the way of the artistic integrity of the productions as would calling the football program at Notre Dame "Grunting Men Bashing Each Other About for the Blessed Mother."

For better or worse, it may very well be that drugs provide the missing link between music fans of all genres.

PERFORMANCE REVIEW 


Local jazz band lig: 
By MARK BEMENDERFER Assistant Scene Editor 
The Don Savoie band. While the name may not ring a bell with the average Notre Dame student, its musical talent and prowess is undeniable. 
Made up of members of the Notre Dame community, the band plays a variety of contemporary songs, ranging from the famous to the obscure. Its sound is a mix­ture of blues, bass and rock and roll-cre­ating an enjoyable experience for listeners. 
The group's latest performance was Saturday night at the Bookmaker's Pub. Playing to a packed audience consisting primarily of Notre Dame students, Frontman Don Savoie and his band easily kept the crowd entertained with a vast library of songs and abilities. They played songs by famous musicians, such as Tom Petty, but they put their own spin on the music, often taking time to simply jam. 
Savoie, an adjunct Notre Dame music professor for the past six years, is a veter­an musician and blues player. lie led the band through the night's selections using a variety of instruments, including the guitar, harmonica and keyboard. He also provided the primary vocals, spoke to the audience directly between songs and boosted audi­ence involvement with the performance. 
His experienee consists of 35 years of musical work in various parts of the world. Attending the University of Michigan, he learned blues and jazz in Detroit. lie then went on to play musie abroad in EuropP, and has played with such performers as Stevie Hay Vaughn. 
Backing Savoie were several proficient musical members from Notre Dame. 
Consisting of members from the student group "Appetite for Destruction," Matt Marnoeha, Uel Pitts and Brendon Collins demonstrated great stage presencP and complimented eaeh other well. Their diverse experience, ranging from Battle of the Bands to the recent production of "Footloose," was evident as they per­formed with Savoie. 
Matt Marnocha played the guitar to great effect, and show<~d his ability throughout the night in a varinty of complex songs. Playing the bass commendably was Uel Pitts, who provided back-up voeals in sev­eral songs to Savoie. Providing the rhythm for the band was Brnndon Collins on the drums, who entertained tho audience with an extended solo midway through the night. 
Each of the members of the band had a moment t.o shine as tlw night progressed, as thP music tlwy played kept space for improvisation and suloing. Tho band obvi­ously enjoyed performing together, and the enthusiasm provPd inf<~<:tious, sproading to the crowd and boosting the overall per­formance. 
The evening broke down into several segments. During the rests, Savoie and the rest of the band would mingle with the crowd, ehatting and having a good time. They were personable and friendly, creat­ing a casual environment with listeners. 
Audience partieipation was obviously high, to the point that one of Savoie's stu­dents, junior Tom HulTman, contributed his abilities with the guitar midway through the performance on a couple of songs. Savoie said such participation is common fare for the hand, as students of'ten play contributing roles in tho band. 
Overall, the performanee was a sueeess 

VIDEO GAME REVIEW 

'Powered Up' Cape 
By MARK BEMENDERFER Assistant Scene Editor 
Gaming platforms live and die by third party support. If a company ean't get games from developers, then the console is des­tined to struggle. Nintendo's Gamecube is a prime example of this, as its third-place ranking in the current console raee can be attributed to the lack of quality non­Nintcndo games. 
Sony is the current leader for a good rea­son. Being able to muster strong third party support from the likes of Capcom and Namco, the Playstation 2 has proven itself as a strong leader. Their PSP is still trying to secure the same success of its bigger broth­er however, and Sony has contracted Capcom to bring several quality titles to the tiny handheld to expedite the process. 
One of the latest ofl'erings on the PSP is "Mega Man Powered Up." The second "Mega Man" title that Capcom has ported, this is a remake of the original Nintendo classic. Like "Mega Man Maverick lluntP.r X," this new release features updated three­dimensional graphics, an improved storyline and added sounds. 
For those unfamiliar with Mega Man's leg­endary beginning -it starts with a bang. A mad scientist (Dr. Wily) decides to take over the world. To do so, he kidnaps eight robots created by the good Dr. Light. lie then reprograms these good robots, transforming them into tools f{Jr global domination. 
llis laboratory in shambles, Dr. Light is short on options for stopping the mad Dr. Wily. However, his assistant robot, Mega, offers to retake the wayward robots and stop Wily's plans of world domination. Dr. Light agrees and upgrades Mega, dubbing him Mega Man. 
Thus the game begins. The player con­trols the newly formed Mega Man on his quest to defeat the robot masters and save the world. As Mega Man defeats each of the robot masters, he assimilates a new special attack from his fallen foe, which can be used to defeat a different bad robot. Essentially an exaggeratnd version of paper­roek-seissor, each of the robot masters has a particular attack they are weak against. As an obvious example is how fire beats oil. 
However, this game is ealled "Powered Up," and it does earn that title. The first noticeable upgrade from the original is the graphics. Done in a three-dimensional, vaguely cartoon style; the vibrant eolors and shapes help compliment the game. 
Also powernd up is the story itsnlf. There 
is a new playable intro to the 


game, and seripted spoken dia­logue has bmm added as well. Mega Man will have a short conversation with each of the robot mastnrs before they bat­tle. 
But the primary area that has been upgraded has befm the gameplay value. Featuring a wealth of unlockables, the option for downloadable con­tent and a level builder,

Nets 110, Suns 72 
New Jersey's dominance of Phoenix was so stunning that Nets coach Lawrenee Frank had trouble keeping track of it. 
Nenad Krstic had 21 points and 10 rebounds, and the Nets won their ninth straight game, holding the Suns to their lowest point total of the season in a rout on Monday night. 
"Midway through the third quarter, I was working on my math skills," Frank said. "I said to one of the assistants, 'We're up what?' I couldn't figure out what it was. No one could have expected this. I had to look up at the scoreboard a couple of times to make sure the math was right." 
Vince Carter added 20 points for the Nets (41-28). who trimmed their magie number to clinch the Atlantic Division to five and the number to clinch an Eastern Conference playoff berth to two. 
The 38-point margin of victory was the biggest of the season for the Nets, whose previous best was a 28-point victory over Golden State on Dee. 18. That came during the Nets' season­high 10-game winning streak from Dee. 16 through Jan. 8. 
The Suns shot a franchise­worst 26.8 percent (26-of-97). The previous worst shooting night occurred 35 years ago, when the Suns shot 29.7 percent against Atlanta on March 10, 1971. 
"It was just one of those nights," the Nets' Richard Jefferson said. "It was a combi­nation of us playing good defense and getting good looks and good shots. We were fortu­nate to get them on a night where they didnt hit their shots." 

It was the second impressive victory in two nights for .the Nets, who won at Detroit 79-74 on Sunday night. 
"It was a rare opportunity in this league to take on two elitp teams on back-to-back nights, playing teams with two different styles and come away with two wins," Frank said.

Deron Williams had 20 points and five assists, and the Utah Jazz ended a two-game losing streak by beating the New Orleans Hornets Monday night. 
All five Utah starters scored in double figures and the Jazz pulled away with a 14-0 run in the third quarter while improv­ing to 33-37 -passing the slumping llornets (32-37) in the Western Conference standings. 
Both teams still trailed Sacramento (35-35) for the No. 8 seed in the playoffs. 
Matt 1-Iarpring had 15 points and 11 rebounds for Utah, which shot 56 percent (37 -for­
66) from the floor and outre-bounded the llornots 45-23. 

Carlos Boozer had 21 points and eight rebounds and Andrei Kirilenko finished with 13 points, eight assists, live blocks and six rebounds. 
The Hornets lost for the 12th time in 13 games and fell to 0-3 on a road trip that wraps up Wednesday at Golden State. 
Rasual Butler led the Hornets with 15 points. 
Leading scorer David West wasn't with the Hornets on Monday because of a sprained left ankle. The Hornets could have used him, especially in the second half as they scored just 28 points. 
Speedy Claxton scored 13 for the Hornnts in the f'irst half, then was shut out in the final two periods. New Orleans led by six in the second quarter before Utah took over the lead for good just before halflime. 
The Jazz selected Williams over Chris Paul with the No. 3 overall pick in the draft last summer and Williams outscored his fellow rookie 20-11, although Paul did have two more assists.

Associated Press 
J.J. Redick of Duke and Adam Morrison of Gonzaga spent all season locked in a bicoastal seoring race. Fittingly, they ended it as the only unanimous selec­tions for The Associated Press' All~America men's basketball team. 
Redick, the most prolific 3-point scorer in eollege history, was a repeat ehoice. He and Morrison were joined on the first team Monday by Redick's teammate Shelden Williams, Randy Foye of Villanova and Brandon Roy, Washington's first All­America in 53 years. 
Indiana's Mareo 

Killingsworth and Chris Quinn from Notre Dame, both seniors, were honor­able mentions . 
Redick and Morrison gave fans a "Can you top this?" seoring eompetition that ended with both receiving all 72 first-team votes from members of the national media panel that selects the weekly Top 25. The voting took plaee before the NCAA tourna­ment. 
Morrison, the only junior on an otherwise all-senior first team, won the seoring title with a 28.4 average, just ahead of Redick's 27.4. Morrison shot 43.7 pereent from 3-point range, while Redick hit 42.1 pereent 
IN BRIEF 
Roddick ready for Greul 
KEY BISCAYNE, Fla. -Andy Roddick heads into the fourth round of the Nasdaq-100 Open with only sketchy information about his next opponent. 
"I know what he looks like," Roddick said. 
Qualifier Simon Greul is a 24-year­old German ranked 130th. He carne to Key Biscayne with a career record of 1-5 on the ATP Tour. Unnerved playing on the stadium court Monday, he won a total of four points in the first set against Tim llenman. 
But the upstart from Stuttgart rallied Lo beat Henman 0-6, 6-1, 7-5, and he'll face Roddick on Tuesday. 
''I'm going to ask around and try to get more of an in-depth seouting report," Roddick said. 
It's an improbable pairing in a sec­tion of the draw Lhat induded Grand Slam champions Marat Safin and Lleyton Hewitt. Greul outlasted both and Pliminated three top-60 players. 

from beyond the arc. 
"It is a testament to the type of season each of us has had," Redick said. "Adam is certainly a great player and it is an honor to be unanimous pick along with him." 
Morrison said being an All-Ameriea isn't "some­thing you think about receiving when you start your eollegiate career, but to be assodated with some of the great names of col­lege basketball is an honor. I guess to be a unanimous pick with J.J. seems only fitting since the two of us have been followed so dosely this year. He's a great player." 
Morrison is Gonzaga's 
second All-America, joining Dan Dickau in 2002. 
This is the second time in three years there were two unanimous seleetions. In 2004, Jameer Nelson of Saint Joseph's and Emeka Okafor of Connecticut were unanimous. 
Redick is the first repeat first-teamer sinee Jason Williams, another Duke guard, in 2001 and 2002. 
Redick and Williams, a senior center who averaged 
18.4 points and 10.3 rebounds while shooting 58 percent from the field, are the ninth set of teammates to be selected to the first team and the first since Jason Williams and Shane Battier of Duke in 2001.

Special to The Observer 
The No. 21 Notre Dame men's volleyball club took to the courts for the first time since breaking into the top-25 national rank­ings for the first time in three years. The Irish opened play at Marquette against Wisconsin­Milwaukee, and won decisively 25-15, 25-16. The Irish dropped their second match to No. 2 seed Lakeland with a score of 25-23, 25-18. In the final opening bracket play, the Irish were vic­torious over Illinois-Chicago, 25­28, 25-24, behind aggressive serving and solid defense. 
In their fourth match, the Irish avenged a defeat earlier this season to Northern Illinois, rid­ing the serves of Mike Toomey to a 25-17, 28-30, 15-13 win. The Irish then fell in the semifi­nals to Wisconsin-Oshkosh, the number one ranked team in the country, 25-17,25-16. 
"We played a great tourna­ment," Irish captain and middle blocker Ryan Goes said. "We beat the teams we should have and fought with the teams who were better."

Sailing  

The Notre Dame sailing team hosted the annual Freshmen Icebreaker this past weekend on St. Joe's Lake. Fourteen teams from throughout the Midwest competed in the regatta. Notre Dame was led by skipper Jaci Chase and crew Joe Peris, who won the B division by consis­tently finishing in the top three. Paul Cordes and Tricia Hughes sailed in the A division and fin­ished in sixth place in their divi­sion, helping the team to a third-place finish overall behind Michigan and Owens College. 
A total of 13 races were held in both the A and B divisions. The remaining field, in order of finish, was Wisconsin, Bowling Green, John Carroll, Marquette, Michigan Blue, Miami (Ohio), Michigan State, Purdue, Iowa and Western Michigan. 
Ultimate 
The Notre Dame ultimate club held Whitesmoke, its lOth annu­al home tournament, this week­end at Riehle and West Quad fields, the first on campus venue in seven years. Ten men's and women's teams from throughout the 'area participated in the two­day event, including a team of Notre Dame women's ultimate alumni. The Irish women's squad defended their tourna­ment title, finishing undefeated for the weekend. 
During pool play on Saturday, the Notre Dame women opened up strong in their first game against Valparaiso. The stellar play of Notre Dame sophomor,e Loretta Brown and senior Kasey Farrell opened up the field and allowed the Irish to score easily against the Valparaiso defense, leading the team to a 13-2 win. The momentum of this win car­ried over to the team's next game against Michigan State B, where the experienced handling duo of seniors Chrissy Hedges and Lizzy Shiel broke down the zone defense and maintained strong offensive flow. This game was also a win for Notre Dame by a 10-1 margin. 
The third game of the day was against Illinois. Senior Chris Dube led Notre Dame to its third win of the day (12-6). Notre Dame sophomores Shannon Morrison and Shields Duss also looked more confident as han­dlers and made a number of great long passes to open up the game. Notre Dame's final Saturday game was against the alumni team. Both teams were evenly matched and traded points throughout most of the game. Irish juniors Rachel Meeks and Jen Pruchnik aided the Notre Dame effort with their abilities both as handlers and as receivers. The undergraduate team was unable to overcome the years of experience on the alumni team and lost 11-8. 
The tournament bracket began Sunday, and Notre Dame opened up against North Park. Notre Dame sophomore Libby Whiting played solid defense and Kerstin Palm had multiple endzone receptions that helped the team coast to a 13-0 victory. In the semifinals, Notre Dame defeated Ohio Northern, 13-5. The tournament finals featured a rematch of last year's finals, with the Irish facing off against Michigan State. The Spartans employed a zone defense to keep the score close in the first half, but in the second half Notre Dame pulled away, earn­ing a 13-5 win. For the second straight year, the Notre Dame women's team won its home tournament. 
The men's squad opened play against Marquette. With han­dlers Kyle Engoian and Andy Huffman swinging the disc well and throwing several big 
breaks, the Irish won handily with a final score of 13-4. 
Notre Dame then faced off against Western Michigan. The Irish came out strong, with freshman cutters Daniel Reimer and Danny Collom making good deep cuts and stretching the Western Michigan defense out. With the score 12-0, Ryan Butler threw a picture-perfect Hammer for a score to make the count 13-0. The Irish went on to win the game 14-1. 
Next, the Irish faced off against the Minnesota club team, Dingwop. The Irish traded points early, but as the game progressed a few key defensive breaks by Notre Dame freshman Ryan Gorman, helped the Irish win the game 13-8. 
For the last game of the day, the Irish played the Notre Dame alumni team, which boasts many players that play for nationals-caliber club teams. Patient offense helped the Irish score every time they received the disc and tight defense gave the alumni no slack. An early layout D by Notre Dame sopho­more Michael Florack helped set the tone for the entire game. When the. alumni looked for deep bucks, Notre Dame junior Steven Kurtz and graduate stu­dent Christopher O'Neill were right there to sky the alumni. Going to their own deep threat, senior Barrs Lang, Notre Dame capitalized on turns and slowly worked their way to a 15-11 vic­tory. For the last 10 points of the game, the alumni ran an excel­lent zone defense against the 

· Irish, but good work on the wings, especially on the part of Irish sophomore Nick Chambers, helped spread the defense out. 
Saturday, taking advantage of the winds that increased from five to 15 knots as the day pro­gressed. Notre Dame sopho­mores John Dailey and Caroline Nally began the regatta with a strong presence, taking eighth in their second race in the A division. Sophomore Chris May and junior Amy Becker followed with a fifth-place finish in their second race in the B division. 
Conditions Sunday began with winds around 12 knots, which slowly lightened as the last six races of the regatta were com­pleted. The dying winds did not hurt the Irish per­formance. Notre Dame sophomore Tim 
Notre Dame fmished ahead of follow MCSA representative Ohio and close behind Miami (Ohio). 
Cycling 
The cycling club participated in two criteriums this weekend, hosted by Marian College. The first was in Indianapolis and the second raced on Marian~s cam­pus, also in Indianapolis. Veteran cyclists Geoff Gisler, Matt Prygoski, Tim Campbell, Ty Baker and Meghan Johnson were joined by Jonathan Weyerbacher, Peter Nistler and Nathan Menendez for the Irish. 
Prygoski, Gisler and Campbell raced the men's B Division and all finished in the middle of the pack, while teammate Johnson had the club's strongest showing in the women's B event, finish­ing among the front riders. 
Weyerbacher competed with Nistler and Menendez in the D Division, and finished among the top-10, with Menendez not far behind. 
Sunday's course was a very technical layout, and Prygoski led the team with a top-20 fin­ish. Campbell and Gisler both finished with a chase group in the low 30's. 
Men's Rowing 
Notre Dame's eight-man and four-man crews began their spring racing season in Grand Rapids, Mich. The crews raced in the traditional­ly inclement weather condi­
adjusted to 1,700 
meters to account for the "crews rowing into an unusually strong current. The Notre Dame men squared off against crews from Michigan, Michigan State, Grand Valley State, Western Ontario, Western Michigan and Northern Michigan. 
The novice men's eight-man crew opened its season of racing in strong form. Notre Dame coxswain Bryce Chung led his crew of Karol Grzesiak (stroke), 
T. Riley Mazzacavallo, Andrew Matasic, Ray Schleck, Taylor Donaldson, Matt Napierski, Rob Bowen and Matt Degnan to a third-place fmish in 6:48 after a slow start.

Bonds hoping to 'stay sane' as season begins 
Associated Press 
SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. -Seven home runs shy of passing Babn Huth, this should be a time of unbridlnd joy and excitement for Barry Bonds. 
Not so, he says. 
"My life is in shambles. It is erazy," Bonds said Monday in an interview with The Assoeiated Press. "It couldn't get any crazier. I'm just trying to stay sane." 
Then, clearly joking, he went for shock value: 
"Go to the Empire State Building and jump off, commit suicide and people can say, 'Barry Bonds is finally dead.' Except for in San Francisco," he said. 'Til leave something for them." 
Despite those pronounce­ments, the 41-year-old Bonds has been upbeat and approach­able -by his standards -this spring despite the recent release of "Game of Shadows," the book detailing his alleged longtime regimen for taking performance-enhancing drugs.

"What's rny job deseription'! That's what I'm doing at that time," Bonds said. "No, I don't forget (what is said). I will never forget. I forgive you but I don't forget. I forgive every­body." 
Bonds teased about starting the season on the disabled list, -saying "it could happen" ­then changed his stance com­pletely and said he "will" play in one of the Giants' exhibition games back in the Bay Area later this week. 
Bonds certainly looks healthy and vibrant, though still a little heavier than usual. 
He spent the morning slurp­ing a smoothie while sitting in his corner locker, and wrestling with his personal videographer in the clubhouse. He stopped by the card table to socialize with teammates, too. Later, he had a lengthy sitdown with players' union head Donald Fehr. 
Bonds is scheduled to return to California on Tuesday -one day before the Giants officially break camp in Arizona -and work out Wednesday in San Francisco. 
Bonds played in only 14 games last season, all in September, following three operations on his troublesome right knee. An exam over the weekend on his elbow revealed inflammation. 
"It's fine," Bonds said. "The knee is good.... I've just got to get my strength back. My legs are fine. I just took a couple weeks orr from training." 
Bonds joked that he is ready for the season to start because tlwn "it's closer to being over." lie is in the final year of a $90 million, five-year contract and will be eligible for free agency al'ter the World Series.

ranks Notre Dame 15th in the Central region. 
Before the season began, Irish head coach Debby King said one of her team's long-term goals was to secure a spot in the NCAA tournament. King said the goal is still very much within reach but the Irish have not played as well as the coach would have liked. 
With poor performances in the Central District Classic February 19-21 and the 'Mo' Morial Tournament March 10­12, Notre Dame almost killed its chances for a post-season NCAA berth. 

The team placed 11th in a field of 14 teams at the Central District in Parrish, Fla. Two weeks later at the 'Mo' Moria!, Notre Dame finished last place in a field of 18. In both events, the Irish played many of their Central Region rivals. 
"After the first two tourna­ments, we were obviously very disappointed with our overall play," King said. 
But last week in the Dr. Donnis Thompson Invitational in Honolulu, Notre Dame found redemption with a fourth-place fmish against solid competition. 
"I talked to the team before the tournament in Hawaii and told them that they had to play really well in order to have a thread of hope [for an NCAA appearance]," King said. 
It was important for Notre Dame to beat UTEP and Kansas State and the golfers executed with an impressive 54-hole total of 906 -good enough to win those important head-to-head battles. 
The Irish head to Virginia for the James Madison Invitational April 8 and 9 where they will compete in their final tourna­ment before the Big East Championship. Neither of these two competitions will feature other teams from the Central Region and the squad will con­centrate solely on maintaining a low scoring average. 
"The tournament bids are determined based upon both scoring average and head-to head records, so we obviously still have something significant to play for," King said. 
The players also realize the importance of earning a spot in the NCAA Regional round. 
"We've gone to the tourna­ment the past two years so it would definitely be a letdown if we didn't get in," senior co-cap­tain Katie Brophy said. 
At the same time, Notre Dame understands how few teams make the tournament and how difficult it is to secure an invite. Unlike some the other major conferences, the Big East cham­pion does not receive an auto­matic berth so the Irish have to rely on an at-large bid. 
"[The NCAA tournament] is so prestigious so it would defmitely be a huge honor to be chosen again," Brophy said. "Hopefully, we can finish strong and get rewarded for it."

Irish sophomore David Gruener will take the mound for Notre Dame. The lefty will be making his first start this season and his second overall in a Notre Dame uniform. 
er, Gruener is no stranger to the rotation. He started nine games -throwing one complete game -for the Hays (Kan.) Larks of the Jayhawk League last sum­mer, fanning 59 batters in 52 innings pitched. 
In six appearances this spring, Gruener has a 2.57 ERA with five strikeouts and three walks in seven innings. 
"David has pitched very well," Mainieri said. "We just thought out of the bullpen." 
Mainieri said Gruener will not pitch deep into the game and will most likely be limited to three innings. He will be replaced by a platoon of reliev­ers to spread experience around the Irish bullpen. 
The Notre Dame bats are coming off a strong week, dur­ing which Notre Dame scored 32 total runs in three games against Georgetown and one run factory for the Irish this season, with the eight and nine holes producing 35 out of the team's 113 RBis (31 percent). 

Seniors Greg Lopez and Cody Rizzo -who currently bat in the eighth and ninth spots ­lead the team in RBis with 19 and 18, respectively.

on the quarterback just to per­form at a high level," Sharpley said. "To add another sport on that -and the academics -is a high task." 
Arter "shadowing" starter Brady Quinn for most of last sea­son in practices, Sharpley said this is his time to make a state­ment in the competition with sophomore quarterback David Wolke for the second-string posi­tion. 
"Hight now, it's my opportuni­ty," Sharpley said. "I think it is a crossroad, as I make or break what I'm going to be." 
lie said he wants to make the most of spring practices before highly toutnd incoming freshmen quarterbacks Zach Frazer and Demetrius Jones arrive at Notre Dame this fall. 
Before committing to football full-time for the spring, Sharpley played in live games -with one start -for the baseball team, going 1-f'or-R with four strike­outs, a walk and one RBI. 
"I had first been recruited to play baseball here," Sharpley said. "It nmlly helped attract me to Notre Dame [to bn able to play both I." 
Weis said Sharpley's limited role in baseball contributed to the dedsion to have him concen­trate solely on football during spring praetien. 
"If [two-sport athletes[ are a major factor for the other team and are handling what they do academically, then they can play [the other sport]," Weis said at Notre Dame's spring media day March 21. "If Sharpley were going to start at first base hitting 25 home runs, I think he might be over there with the baseball team. But he's not." 
Notre Dame's other current baseball-football athlete, rising senior receiver Jeff Samardzija, will stick with baseball while attending six of Notre Dame's 15 spring practices, Weis said. 
As a starting pitcher for Mainieri's squad, Samardzija went 8-1 in 2005 with a 3.89 ERA. This season, Samardzija is 2-1 in five appearances with a 
3.72 ERA. Samardzija then set school records with 15 touch­down catches and 1,249 receiv­ing yards last season for Weis. 
"Jeffs already established him­self on the football field as well as the baseball field, so that's why he gets all the time on the baseball field right now," Sharpley said. "I haven't estab­lished myself at either spot, but I'm here to play football right now." 
Sharpley said leaving the base­ball team just a dozen games into his first season was dillicult. 
"I definitely would like to play IbaseballI." Sharpley said. "It was fun to get to go on a couple of the trips with the team. I'm still going to be around those guys and support them at some of the games, especially the home ones." 
Sharpley said once spring foot­ball ends he will rejoin the base­ball team full"time.
