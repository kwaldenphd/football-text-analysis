Non-varsity Domer Runs too much in the fast-lane 
The Non-Varsity Athletics Domer Runs are not what they used to be. An epidemic of over­competitiveness has reached another '1ust-for­the-fun-of-lt" sporting event. 
Non-Varsity Athletics sponsors a three-and a six-mile run each semester. The Domer Runs are in the fall, followed by the Irish Spring Six In the spring. A small entry fee is required to cover the cost of the T-shirt that each finisher receives. The number of entrants has averaged around 200, consisting of.students, graduate students, faculty and staff. Sunday's turnout was good, but It cer­tainly was a different crowd. 
A major change this year was the Introduction of dorm competition. For the same fee, at least four runners could sign up together, representing their dorm. When I saw this, I knew that it would be a different race than the previous six-mile races that I have run in. The competition monster would attract the runners who wanted to win, while scaring away those who just wanted to run. 
One of the great features of the earlier runs was the spectrum ofability that came outon a Saturday morning. (The latest edition was moved to Sun­day, due to the football game.) Former high school track stars, occasional joggers, women, men, stu­dents and non-students showed up in every con­dition from being a model of superior fitness to being hung-over. The "real" runners could go and win the handful of trophies, while the rest of us worked on personal records, ran with friends, or simply stayed conscious long enough to cross the finish line. 
I am not a great runnq. I just started running the summer before my freshman year, after over­coming a phobia of muscle cramps. (If you've never run before, don't worry. They go away in a few weeks.) 
What attracted me to my first Domer Run was the challenge. Having never run six miles before, I didn't know if I could. This motivated me to train harder, and I ran what turned out tq be my best time ever. Each run after that I did worse, but I kept coming back. I enjoyed the crowd as well as pushing my body to the limit. 
Several others had the same attitude about the run. As runners passed me on the grueling two­mile stretch of the golf course, I received several encouraging words. "Keep It up ... don't give up yet" and "you're doing great" mean a lot when your legs are spaghetti. 
Though I ran a slow pace in the other races, I never had to worry about humiliation. Everyone supported everyone else all the way to the end. The runners that brought up the rear got the big­gest applause at the finish line, sweetening their personal victory. This year I brought up the rear, and I even ran It two minutes faster than last year. Where was everyone else who used to run even

slower than I did? They stayed home, wisely choosing to avoid the competition. 
As I rounded the fifth mile-marker, ready to collapse, I was greeted with, "Is there anyone left behind you guys?" That comment added two more miles to the run mentally. 
I had hoped to run a seven-minute mile this semester. After a few missed practice runs and several late nights during the week. I changed my goal. I decided to run the same pace as my friend Chris, who I suckered Into entering without pre­vious training. The heat dehydrated us quickly. The run soon began to be a quest for survival. 
 In the last mile, I told Chris not to worry about being last. The crowd always cheers for the final runners. When we crossed the finish line there was cheering. but not for us. They had already started the awards ceremony. I guess there were so many trophies to give away this time that they couldn't let non-serious runners like us hold up the show. 
Well, we did get our T-shirts. And no one will know whether we came in first or last. just that we ran In an event called the Domer Runs, which sounds impressive. I will run my eighth and final six-mile next spring to complete my T-shlrt ward­robe. Let's see fewer trophies and more hang­overs out there next time.

62 people killed in Beirut clashes 
Associated Press 
BEIRUT, Lebanon-Christian militia hardliners crushed a com­eback attempt by an ousted, pro­Syrian commander Sunday in 24 hours of street battles In Chris­tian east Beirut, which police said killed 62 people and wounded 198. 
Fighting began at dawn Satur­day when about 600 supporters of Elie Hobeika, former com­mander of the Lebanese Forces Christian militia, stormed across the Green Line dividing east Beirut from the Moslem western sector. 
"The last pocket of resistance was mopped up at daybreak, when 12 infiltrators from Elie Hobeika's supporters surren­dered," said a communique issued by the Lebanese Forces, the nation's largest Christian militia. 
Police confirmed that loyalists of Lebanese Forces Commander Samir Geagea defeated the pro­Hobeil~ attackers. 
There was no word on the whereabouts of Hobeika, who was ousted from the command of the Lebanese Forces by Geagea's hardliners Jan. 15 for signing a Syrlan-sponsored peace pact with Moslem militia leaders. President Amin Gemayel, himself a Maronite Catholic, was among the Chris­tians who felt the accord's power­sharing provisions conceded too, much to the Moslems. 
One report Sunday, not con­firmed, said Hobeika was in Chtaura, the Bekaa Valley town

tax code in a generation, politicians and economists stili argued over the impact of the changes on the nation's eco­nomy. 
Concerns for the economy have been raised because the bill would repeal the investment tax credit, a major job-creating in­centive for the past two decades, and shift $120 billion In taxes from Individuals to corporations over the next five years. 
The bill also would slash Indi­vidual and corporate rates; in 1988 the top Individual rate would drop to 33 percent, the 46 percent maximum corporate rate would fall to 34 percent. Several deductions and exclusions would be reduced or eliminated. 
Individual taxes will be cut by an average of 6. 1 percent by 1988 when most provisions will be In effect. But 20.4 million couples and Individuals will pay more. Their lower rates will not make up for the loss of deduc­tions.

Dial-a-Shrinks may be out-of-order 
Associated Press 
MINNEAPOLIS-People who need counseling can turn to an increasing number of telephone therapists who offer their clients the convenience and privacy of not having to leave their home or office. 
Psychologist Marilyn F. Mason operates Tele-Psych Inc. in Min­neapolis and says many of her clients are male executives too busy to visit her in person or con­cerned about being seen enter­ing a psychologist's office. 
Some psychologists, however, are not sure that such services are in the client's best interest. 
"We have some concerns about doing therapy in this way," said David H. Mills, ethics direc­tor of the Washington-based American Psychological Associa­tion. "Our ethics code says psychotherapy is done in the context of a personal visit." 
The association has no rules governing telephone psyc­hologists, who have been crop­ping up across the country in.in­creasing numbers, Mills said. But guidelines will probably be adopted by the end of January, he said. 
The names used by telephone 
psychologists, such as Shrink 
Link In New York and Dial-a­
Shrink in Los Angeles, are trou­
bling, Mills said. 
But he added: "we are more 
interested in what they are doing 
than in what they're calling them­
selves." 
Mason, who opened a tradi­tional practice In January and added telephone service in May, charges $20 for the first 10 min­utes, $11 for an additional 1 0 minutes, payable through major credit cards. For an hour chat, her fee is $75, $5 more than she charges for an office visit. 
Unlike Mills, Jacqueline Bouhoutsos, a UCLA psychology professor and founder of the As­sociation for Media Psychology, a sub-group of the American Psy­chological Association, said she isn't bothered by telephone psy­chology. 
She equates it with radio psy­chology, which she said the public perceives as educational rather than therapeutic. 
"Back in the late 70s, there was a concern on the part of a lot of mental health profes­sionals that this kind of advice­giving might be deleterious to listeners and or callers," Bouhoutsos said. 

Then in 1981, the American Psychological Association lifted its ban on radio psychology. 
"One would think in five years, since the ethics code was changed, that the possibility of damage would have surfaced," Bouhoutsos said. "The assump­tion is if the phenomenon is not helpful It is at least innocuous." 
Insurance companies cast a wary eye on telephone counsel­ing. 
Richard C. lmbert, president of American Professional Agency Inc., a major writer of mental health malpractice insurance, said he would cancel the policy of any psychologist he learned was doing telephone psychology work. 
Mason maintains that tele­phone counseling differs little from the work of traditional psyc­hologists. 
But she is quick to point out the limitations of working by phone, and her flyers say she makes referrals when necessary. 
Mason insists she isn't offering therapy by telephone. "You can't give therapy in two or three min­utes. That's not credible," she said. 

Hunt continues for injured killer 
Associated Press 
WRIGHT CITY, Mo.-Scores of officers hunting a former mental patient accused ofthree murders Investigated a vacant trailer home Sunday, the seventh day of the search, authorities said. 
The officers, hunting with bloodhounds and a helicopter, found no trace of Michael W. Jackson as of 9 p.m., said Hal Helterhoff, agent in charge ofthe FBI's St. Louis office. 
Officers found a door open on the trailer home, but they weren't certain if It there had been a break-in, he said. Evidence col­lected from the trailer was being sent to Jefferson City for analy­sis, Helterhoff said. 
Officers blocked off the area, and some residents were kept away from their homes while the search for the armed fugitive was being conducted. 
The bearded Jackson, 41, has been at large since Sept. 22, when authorities say he began his three-state spree of murder, abductions and theft. Fears about him shattered the calm of this eastern Missouri community of about 1, 200 people, and resi­dents began arming themselves and locking their doors. 
Earlier Sunday, vultures were seen circling over a wooded area near where Jackson was last seen, and about 50 officers combed the area. Nothing was found. 
"We've had several reports of buzzards circling," said Highway Patrol Sgt. Jim Lee. "Their choice of prey I guess you could say would be decaying animal remains. They are known to sort of zero in on (dead) possum, animals, humans, whoever." 
Lee said about 50 vultures were circling a section of woods 'just west of where he was last seen." 
Officers beAan their search at dawn Sunday in the southwest city limits and an area further south, said patrol Sgt. Ron Wiedemann. 

"I think a lot of people are starting to wonder" if Jackson isn't dead, Lee said. "You ask them (officers searching on foot) their opinion, and it's about 50­50." 
Lt. Roy Foss of the Highway Patrol said about half of the ap­proximately 100 officers who had been searching for Jackson were given the day off Sunday. He said the search would con­tinue until Jackson was found or there's evidence he was not in the area. 
"It's getting more difficult each day," Foss said. 
Bloodhounds were used in Sat­urday's search until heavy rain washed away the scent. A shoe belonging to Jackson was flown to Missouri from Indianapolis, where he lived, to give the dogs the scent. 

Liberal arts education valuable, say graduates 
Associated Press 
GREENCASTLE, Ind. -The value of a college education should not be measured In how well It prepares a student for a job right out of school, three well-known DePauw University graduates said. 
Former astronaut Joseph P. Al­len, former National Urban League director Vernon E. Jor­dan Jr. and Barbara Blakemore, managing editor of Family Circle magazine, spoke on the impor­tance of a liberal arts education during ceremonies marking the school's 150th anniversary. 
Allen, who graduated in 1959, said that during his days at DePauw students learned about vacuum tubes, binary machine language, and supersonic aerodynamics. 
But if students then focused only on those subjects, they would have reached their "practi­cal limits .. . in an unbelievably short time." Little that they learned then, he said, would have prepared them for orbiting

Students will benent if they have a solid background in lan­guage, philosophy, science, En­glish, speech and history, said Allen, a former mission specialist with the space shuttle program who is now a vice president of Space Industries Inc. of Hous­ton. 
Jordan, who graduated in 1957 and is now a lawyer in Washington, said a liberal arts education prepares a student for the "two-thirds of our life that is not about our jobs, our work or statuses, but about dailiness, about inwardness, about our capacity for affiliations. In other words, values." 
He said he left campus with an understanding of how to use the English language, the ebb and flow of history, a grasp of the· importance of science, an ap­preciation of art and literature and knowledge about state, federal and local governments and citizen responsibility.

parts of a place or a thing, an early stage,  
initiation, setting into motion. Are you  
with me,  Saint Mary's? Think back -no,  
no, not to Adam and Eve, just the month  
of August. You've already survived a lot  
of beginnings and first for the 1986-87  
year: classes, football season, dining hall  
food,  the  library basement,  University  
Park Mall, alumns, the sweet smell of et­

I  There are more beginnings. Think back  
to elections last February. Remember the  
three  aspiring  politicians  who  came  
knocking on your door at 11:.30 p.m. to  
Introduce themselves to you? That was  
us -Jeanne Heller, Sarah Cook. and Betsy  
Burke. Remember what we said to you?  
"We want to represent you and to work  
for you. We'd appreciate your support."  
Remember what you did? You elected usl  
So here we are, not exactly sitting around,  
but getting out Into the Saint Mary's Col­ 
lege community,  working with  depart­ 
ments and administration to Improve life  
on campus. FOR YOUI We represent you.  
Ifyou're not happy, we're not happy. Sort  
of -what I mean is, If we know you're not  

happy, then we're not happy. Admittedly, I can read minds. I can! I know -hard to believe. But it's true. However, Sarah and Betsy haven't quite mastered this trick yet, so we all need your feedback -your comments, concerns, questions, criticisms, and ultimately your respect. 
"Good enough", you're thinking, "but how do I do that?!" On girls! Tell me what you think! At 5'2" I'm pretty approachable. I answer to Jeanne, Jeano, Jeanne Marie, Babydoll, Heller, and various other names which can't be printed here. I'm easy to find! Know where the Haggar Col­lege Center is? There's a third floor -yes, the Student Government offlces are up there, it's not just a ploy to get you run­ning stairs. And inside the offlces ... the offlcersl Mine's the first one -either be­cause I'm the fearless leader or because that's the only office the couch will fit in. It's a comfortable couch, I'll let you sit on it. And ifyou don't like James Taylor, you can bring a tape of your own to play, and we'll just rap. I promise to be there Sun­day through ~ednesday from 6:00p.m. -10:00 p.m. Thursday nights we're all around, but you have to catch us between Bill Cosby and Hill Street, depending on what's going on. 
Ifyou don't want to see our faces, leave a note on the door, or call the offlces at 284-5.37.3 to gripe, or we can set up a time to do that lunch thing. Guaranteed -we are always available for lunch! If you have questions about who's who (SPB, VPSA, and VPAACR), or what's what (like Board of Governance, ,Programming Board, and Student Academic Council), we want to not only tell you, but also show you! Want to see what goes on at a meeting? I'll tell you this much -we have fun, we have food, and we get things done. 
Beginnings ... a new President, some awesome sports teams boasting winning records, active clubs and organizations, faculty who know you by name, and an effective Student Government. And did you check out that Science Building?! This is an exciting year for you, so take ad­vantage of the opportunities before you, and if you signed up for a group at Ac­tivities Night, how about following through? If you have an option, tell me, not your roommate! And don't forget about lunch -I'm in the book.

P.O.BoxQ 
Information in letter requires clarification 
Dear t:ditor: 

The Observer's account (911) of Vice President for Student Affairs Father David Tyson's July 7th Jetter to three members ofGays and Lesbians at Notre Dame/Saint Mary's College may provide the faculty's only Information concerning the matter, as well as its only opportunity for direct comment. The topics raised merit general and responsible consideration. 
GLND-SMC requested the use of Univer­sity owned facilities for sponsored events and the opportunity to advertise in Uni­versity owned media. University facilities can ordinarily be used to acquire, modify, and express opinions without any impli­cation that the University "sanctions" those opinions or warrants their conform­Ity with orthodox Catholic doctrine. ~m 1 mistaken about that policy, or did GLND-SMC request the use of university facilities for purposes other than the ac­quisltion, modiflcation, or expression of opinion? 
Issues touching sexual preference are central to the Identity of many persons and many communities. Differences of opinion concerning such issues ought to be treated with greater respect, and the differing parties out to accord each other a greater measure of sensitivity and dig­nity than would ordinarily characterize academic discourse. Denying persons the opportunity to express deeply held and rationally formed opinions is a most un­civil form of academic behavior. But why should a University offlcial go further and suggest that a group of dissenters can only have recourse to Campus Ministry or the Counseling Center? To do pen­ance, mend their ways and receive for­giveness for their sins? To·receive therapy and overcome their inability to function normally? 
Is more at stake here? Does someone think the expression of opinion favoring homosexuality constitutes a threat to this community? Is it somehow analogous to yelling "flrel!l" In a crowded theatre? Why should It be? I hope the purposes and principles underlying Fr. Tyson's letter can be clarified for us all. 
t:d Manier Assoc. Prof of Philosophy 
Bleak alternatives to SYRs are considered 
Dear t:ditor: 

In response to the Viewpoint column of September 2.3 namely, Lou Sarabando's "Abuse of alcohol runs ram­pant at hall SYR's," I must, in defense of the remaining shreds of the Notre Dame social scene, wonder if Sarabando is as naive as he appears. He is misinformed to think that hall SYR's are simply uncon­trolled drunkfests. Certainly there are many who choose to become inebriated every chance they get, but that is hardly the norm. There are many people who know how to drink conservatively and have fun doing that. 
My worry is that the increased anti­alcohol rhetoric proclaimed by all ofthese flaming teetotalers might actually lead to a decision by the administration to abolish SYR's. Can you imagine that? No SYR's? We would be the biggest group of unhappy campers known to man. It's bad enough that you are met by the South Bend SWAT team every time you attend an off-campus party, but no SYR's? What would we do to let off our steam? The only activities I could devise to replace SYR's would be campus-wide bridge tour­naments or weekly trips to University Park mall. 
So, to all the conservatives who can't stand the sight of alcohol, please under­stand -Notre·Dame is a good university and we work hard all week long. We deserve a good party once in a while.

Drawing a deep breath, Koli stepped Into his surflng rag. ran a hand through his hair and stepped out Into the sunlight to join the other surfer men. A hush fell over the crowd. All eyes were riveted on him. There was an agonizing moment of silence and then the crowd went wild. Throngs of people gathered around him admiring the Jams. Compliments for Koli's sewing expertise and design flowed over him. Men looked on with admira­tion and silently vowed to have their mates learn how to sew that style of surflng rag. 
Through the crowd, Kino caught a glimpse of Koli. She looked completely exhausted ex· cept for a light burning deep in her eyes, speaking of her love for him. And he realized all at once what she had gone through. He understood the mo­tivation behind her actions more completely than he ever thought possible. And at that moment he had never loved her more. 
There are many stories about Jams. One clan tried to decorate the rags with maple syrup and that is how we discovered maple leaf rag. Another clan contracted Jam fever... but as I said there are MANY stories and they have no place here. The story I have just told Is the story of how Jams came to be. Wasn't that nice? Well boys and girls It's time to go. Tomorrow we'll have some­thing new to talk about and won't that be fun. Be good now.

But Kino had eyes for only one of his clan. Her name was Koli, and she was the loveliest woman in the world. Koli adored Kino and would do anything for him gladly. The one exception was when Kino would ask her to mend his surfing rag. (In ancient times, men sometimes did this· sort of thing.) This she dreaded with all her heart and though she would agree, It was only her great love for him that allowed her to do so. 
Perhaps I didn't mention this, but Koli was a terrible seamstress. She could never re­member how to sew even the simplest of seams though the other women of the clan would teach her again and again. 
Months passed. Kino and Koli continued living the greatest romance of the century. Winter turned to spring. And the day of the clan's annual Celebration of New Life drew near. This was a day of thanks and praise for the passage of spring. There were parties and games and best of all, a giant surfing competition In which all of the tribesmen were entered. The clan looked forward lar, she would take too much off and the whole rag would have to be abandoned and another started. And so it went. She paced the floor. She gnashed her teeth and tore at her hair... 
Dawn broke. Kino arrived finding his love fast asleep In a pile of animal skins clutching the finished surfing rag in her fist. Gently removing It from her grasp, he kissed her and with a last look, left quietly to prepare himself for the day's competi­
tion. 
As the hours of the morning passed, Kino found himself to be very busy and never actually looked at his new surfing rag un­til It was time to dress for the contest. Imagine his horror and dismay, boys and girls, when he saw what Koli had donel He was not looking at the traditional sur­flng rag that every member of the tribe wore. t1e was looking at the flrst pair of Jams In the history of mankind. 
What would he do now? He 
would be laughed out ofthe clan I 
But after a moment's thought, 
Kino realized that there was 
nothing to do but put the Jams lukewarm and this puzzled Murphy who was quoted in The New York Times Review of Chil­dren's Books as saying. "Like a guy spends months writing. from like the bottom of his guts, and then they tell me I write like a Hoosier. I dunno man, you go flgure It out.. .. " 
In an attempt to bring this book to a larger audience, we have agreed to publish excerpts from "The Meaning of Existence and Other Stuff I Figured Out In the John." Present philosophy students will appreciate Murphy as he is more precise and to the point than Socrates or Aquinas ever was. Enjoy.

Broncos beat Pats to highlight NFL action

Sammy Winder and Gerald Wil­
lhite scored second-half touch­
downs and the Denver defense 
smothered New England in that 
half. rallying the unbeaten 
Broncos past the Patriots. 
Trailing 1.3-.3 at halftime, the 
Broncos scored on four of their 
five possessions in the second 
half. 
John Elway -who endured a dreadful first half, hitting on only six of 18 passes for 48 yards with one interception -returned to form on Denver's opening pos­session of the second half. He completed passes of 1 7 yards to Steve Watson and .32 yards to rookie Mark Jackson, then found tight end Clarence Kay for the 1-yard scoring toss. Bears 44, Bengals 7 
Sore-shouldered quarterback Jim McMahon threw three touch­down passes to Inspire a slug­gish Chicago offense to Its most 

productive performance of the 
season. 

The 4-0 Bears routed the 2-2 
Bengals in style reminiscent of 
their 1985 Super Bowl season, 
using McMahon's leadership to 
cash in on five interceptions by 
their hard-hitting linebackers 
and defensive secondary. 
Chicago built a 21-0 first quarter 
lead that was never in jeopardy. 
McMahon, making his first start since separating his shoulder three weeks ago, dove 1 yard for the Bears' first score, tossed a 2-yard scoring pass to running back Walter Payton, then launched a perfect 5.3-yard scoring bomb to wide receiver Willie Gault to complete the big­gest first-quarter scoring blitz against Cincinnati in five years. 
Steelers 22, Oilers 16 
Pittsburgh's Rick Woods returned a punt 41 yards in over­time to set up Walter Abercrombie's .3-yard touch­down run that gave the Steelers their victory over Houston. 
Steelers quarterback Mark

Malone went 11 yards on a boot­leg prior to Abercrombie's scoring run that gave Pittsburgh Its first win of the year, snapping a three-game losing streak. 
Pittsburgh's Gary Anderson kicked his third field goal of the game, a 28-yarder, to give the Steelers a 16-1.3 lead with 2:2.3 seconds left In regulation play. Houston quarterback Warren Moon rallied the Oilers with six straight completions to set up a 2.3-yard field goal by Tony Zen­dejas with 45 seconds left, sen­ding the game into overtime. 
Raiders 17, Chargers 13 
Marc Wilson threw two touch­down passes in a span of 41 seconds to spark the Los Angeles Raiders to their first win of the NFL season, a come-from­behind victory over San Diego. 
The decision left both teams with 1·.3 records. The Raiders, playing without star tailback Marcus Allen, who was sidelined because of a sprained ankle, opened the season by losing their first three games for the first time in 22 years. 

falcons 23, Bucs 20, OT 
Mlck Luckhurst's third field goal of the game, a .34-yarder 12:.35 into overtime, lifted At­lanta over Tampa Bay. The game-winning kick came at the end of a 1 0-play, 52-yard drive that consumed 6 minutes, 29 seconds and completed the Fal­cons' comeback from a 20-7 halftime deficit. 
The Falcons' 4-0 start is the best in the franchise's 21-year history. Tampa Bay, trying to reach the .500 mark for first time since the sixth week of the 1984 season, fell to 1-.3. 
Gerald Riggs, who rushed for 129 yards on 27 carries, launched the second-half rally with a 1-yard touchdown run In the third quarter.

Wade Boggs and the Boston Red Sox clinched the American League East with a win overToronto yesterday. Boggs went 1-4 for the game to drop Lanza, Tom Freeman. John As­kin and Byron Spruell. 
"Our line's awesome," said Johnson. "There's not much wrong you can do bet)ind these guys." 
Holtz, who was not sure how the Irish would do against the young Purdue defense, was very happy with the results. "I was sincere when I said this was the best defense that I had seen at Purdue," he said. "I didn't know if we would have the ability to run the football. 
"But we felt that ifwe are going to be a consistent football team, we will have to run the football, and I don't think it could have come out better (than this game)."

Irish sweep Valpo with strong pitching 
By STEVE MEGARGEE 
Sports Writer 
Pre-season reports ofthe Notre Dame baseball team suggested that the Irish might not have the pitching to win consistently. But if yesterday's doubleheader against Valparaiso is any indica­tion, the Irish might have much stronger pitching this spring than anyone expected. 
The Irish took a pair of seven­inning games. 5-0 and 7-4, from the Crusaders atJake Kline Field. A pair of freshman pitchers, Brian Piotrowicz and Mike Coffey, shut out Valparaiso in their first starts of the fall. The doubleheader sweep raised Notre Dame's fall record to 3-1. 
In the first game, Piotrowicz hurled a one-hitter, with an in­field single by third baseman Tim Pollert in the second Inning 
being  the  only  offense  the  
Crusaders could muster.  
"He  pitched  very well,"  said  

Irish head coach Larry Gallo. ''He stayed ahead In the count. I'm looking at him as a starter next spring. 
"We didn't play defense really well, but Plotrowicz came back and really bore down." 
Despite the four Irish errors in the first game, Plotrowicz praised the team's fielding. 
"The team backed me up and really supported me." said Piotrowicz. "Even when they made an error, they came back and made a good play later." 
Valparaiso pitcher Doug James was able to match Piotrowicz's performance for a while. The teams were scoreless after three innings, with each side managing only one hit. 
Junior left fielder Scott Rogers led the Irish out of their tempo­rary hitting hibernation by driving a home run to left-center field. giving Notre Dame a 2-0 lead. 
Brent Bartel became the new Valparaiso pitcher one batter later, and the Irish offense gave him a rude welcome to Jake Kline Field in the fifth inning. With John Flanagan and Pat Pesavento on base, sophomore third baseman Steve Skupien rifled a hit up the middle to score Flanagan. A fly ball scored Pesavento, and a double by Rogers scored Skupien. Rogers' hit gave him three runs batted in for the game, and closed the scoring at 5-0. 
"We scored a few more runs than we did last week." said Coach Gallo. "The more we play, the better we'll hit the ball." 
Notre Dame scored a total of only seven runs in a doubleheader against Bradley last week. The Irish scored twelve in yesterday's doubleheader. 
In the second game, Mike Cof­fey did not start out as effectively as Piotrowicz, giving up three hits and walking three batters in the first three innings, but he also allowed no runs during his five-inning stint. Valparaiso scored four runs off sophomore Tom Howard in the sixth inning. 
"He (Coffey) pitched well at spots. He got behind, but he made the pitches when he had to," said Coach Gallo. "Howard was a little bit rusty, and he gave up a few hits in a row." 
Using an almost entirely differ­ent lineup in the closing game, the Irish took advantage of Val­paraiso mistakes to take an early lead. 
After getting a run in the second Inning from sophomore left fielder Pat O'Brien, sloppy Crusader defense helped Notre Dame load the bases with nobody out in the third Inning. 
Skupien made the most of this opportunity by scooping a John Shorter pitch way over the left field fence to put the Irish ahead 5·0. 
Poor Valparaiso fielding led to two more Notre Dame runs in the fourth inning. as the Crusaders made two errors on one play to help the Irish tally their last two runs in the 7-4 win.

caught Holtz's attention more than his running. 
"Anthony Johnson is the guy who busted up the wedge on the kickoffs." said Holtz. "That's not his Intention, but he always seems to end up there." 
One of Johnson special teams 
tackles came on the kickoff im­
mediately following his fourth 
quarter touchdown run. 
But Johnson's running was just one of the key's to Notre Dame's successful running game. Holtz, who had been stressing the run all week in prac­tice, saw his running backs gain 
276 yards on 60 attempts, both highs for the season. 
In addition to Johnson, both Mark Green and Pernell Taylor had rushing touchdowns, and Tim Brown, D'Juan Francisco, and Braxston Banks combined to make the afternoon a long one for the Purdue defense. 
According to Holtz, though, the improvement in the running game over the previous weeks was bacause of the line. 
"We blocked better," Holtz said simply. "Our offensive line had been under Coach Tony Yelovich all week. and he kept saying that they'd be all right. But they really played hard, really played well." 
Johnson admitted that the run­ning is much easier behind the likes of Shawn Heffern, Chuck

The Saint Mary's varsity tennis team, whose record stands at 5­3, is still working towards its season goal of a perfect NAIA record. 
With their current losses falling to NCAA scholarship squads, the Belles maintain an undefeated division record. 
Last week. the team lost to St. Joseph's and Wisconsin­Milwaukee, by scores of 5-4, 5-4. 
"We should not have lost those close matches," said head coach Deb Laverie. " The team simply lacked tenacity." 
Matches are played against NCAA schools for experience. They do not affect the team's overall status in league stand­ings. Laverie explained. 
"We use the NCAA matches as learning experiences," she said. The Belles defeated league 
rival, St. Francis, 6-3, last week. 
"rt was a big win," said Deb. "St. Francis beat us last year to advance Into the Nationals." 
Last weekend, the squad travelled to DePauw, where they suffered a 6-3 defeat. Coach Laverie attributed the loss to lack of consistency. 
"The team members played well," she said. "They have the ability to win." 
Ability is one of the Belles' strongest points this season. One strength lies in freshman Jennifer Block. the No. 1 seed. 
"Jennifer has been phenomenal," exclaimed Laverie. "She beat girls who have been around college tennis for four years." 
Sophomore Shaun Boyd, has come from behind in two matches, forcing them to go three sets. 
Coach Laverie sighted, "Shaun has the desire to play hard and her hard work has paid-off." 
Freshman Buffy Heinz has ad­vanced from the number-three seed doubles, into the singles line-up. Heinz and senior cap­tain, Kim Drahota, are unbeaten In doubles matches. 
The team defeated Goshen, in a match which featured exhibi­tion play. Freshman Jane Schnell, was victorious over Gos­hen player, Emily Headings, 6-0, 6-1. Erin Flynn, a freshman, topped Wynee Martin 6-0,6-2. In doubles. the freshman team of Kelly Seppi and Lynda Cipowski handed a defeat to Headings and Martin, 6·0, 6-2. 
"These matches were very im­portant." said Laverle. "These girls have the heart to play and the desire to win," she said. 
This Tuesday, the Belles take on the University of Toledo as they prepare for their weekend Invitational.
