was quick to observe that " the role a student's room plays in campus life has changed drastically in the past 10 years and this change needs to be considered in any proposal." 

Connected with the problem of overcrowding, McKenna brought up the problem of social space and said, "We want to make sure that any solution to overcrowding does not occur at the expense of social space." 
'"'His list of priorities consists of ten other major points including developing a course evaluation booklet and a career/guidance/ counseling center, as well as continued folloup on social space proposals. 
Along with these goals, McKenna listed the development of a restaurant in . the basement of LaFortune with a "pizza parlor type atmosphere," the establish­ment of a Security Advisory Panel and a social life analysis as part of the list of priorities. 
"We also want to get laundry machines on the north quad," McKenna said. Rounding the list are proposals to put a student record store in LaFortune, projects to help develop student awareness in regards to the Third World Conference and actions to help strengthen ties with Saint Mary's student government. · 
Discussing improvements in stu­dent government, McKenna said he has appointed an Executive Coordinator to help in the admini­stration of student government objectives. Junior Andy Herring will serve in this post and will assist in the coordination of student government activities. 
To get more students involved in student government, McKenna said he hoped to utilize the task force idea. "It gives students a chance to participate without having to assume cabinet level amounts of responsibility." 
Noting that he will continue to act in his traditional capacities in regards to the Campus Life Coun­cil, Board of Commissioners and other campus activities, McKenna said that Student Body Vice Pres­ident Mike Roohan will "tackle the priorities list on a daily basil." 
"It is our belief that division of responsibilites will lead to a more effective student government," McKenna said. "Mike and I will work closely together on all of student government's objectives."

Donor grants 
new hall funds 
by Laura Larimore Staff Reporter 
Funds for a new residence hall, designed to accommodate a pro­jected increase in the enmllment of women at Notre Dame, have been donated to the University by a presently anonymous donor. 
According to Sr. John Miriam Jones, assistant provost, the sub­stantial donation was. given be­cause of the donor's "great deal of loyalty and love for Notre Dame.". 
The possibility of a tower is under discussion, although no de­cision on the design has been reached as yet. The planning is presently centering on the finances of construction. Although no building dates have been set, the new dorm may be completed within three years. 
Jones, with her Advisory Council for Women Students, has submit­ted a recommendation regarding social space in the new building, asking that it be used to help alleviate the shortage existing on campus brought out in the Commit­tee on Coeducation's report.

Cowboys, Patriots expected to win 
[Continued from page 8] 
The Pats defense is also superb. Nose guard Ray "Sugar Bear'' Hamilton, linebacker Sam Hunt and cornerback Mike Haynes are the starts of the stop troops. Ray Clayborn, who had a super rookie season on the special teams, could develop into an all-star at cornerback. 
Although the whole Stingley situation may have hurt this team psychologically, the Pats are still the class of the division. If they can remain healthy they have a good chance to reach the Super Bowl. BALTIMORE COLTS-The Colts always seem to be having salary problems-last year it was John Dutton, this year it's Lydell Mithcell. At least Dutton stayed with the team, Mitchell was shipped to San Diego for Joe Washington and a draft choice. If you don't think the Colts will miss Mitchell, just look at all the Colt records that Mitchell holds. 
He ranks right next to Lenny Moore in all the rushing and scoring categories. Even if Washington plays well, Mitchell will be missed. because he did so much for the Colt offense. 
Bert Jones still holds the reins to the Colt offense, but with Mitchel and tight end Raymond Chester no longer in the offensive lineup, Jones may be less effective. Rookie Reese McCall may be able to help at tight end, but no rookie will be able to fill Chester's shoes right away. The offensive line is solid, so Jones should normally have enough protection. 
The Colts defensive line is excellent. Dutton and Fred Cook are two good ends while Joe Erhmann and Mike

Barnes are two solid tackles. Rushing tne passer is their forte. Stan White is the best of a mediocre group of linebackers. The secondary is improving and .the recent acquisition of Dwight Harrison from Buffalo should help in this area. 
The prognosis for the Colsts is murky. Can Washington take Mitchell's place? If the answer to this question is yes, then the Colts should be in the fight for the AFC East crown. MIAMI DOLPHINS-The Dolphins have been the hardest hit by injuries this pre-season. A. J. Duhe and Bob Baumhower are both out for extended periods of time. That is the heart of the defensive line. Bob <§riese, the key to the offense, is out for at least four weeks, and possibly the whole season with torn ligaments in his knee. That just about puts the season down the drain. Except for the fact that the Dolphins have Don Shula. Without question, Shula has been the best coach in the NFL over the last four seasons. He has rebuilt the Miami team without having terrible records. He may just have something up his sleeve for this year. 
Don Strock will be the QB, barring any last minute changes. New RB Del Williams should add ~unch to the

running game, which was above average to begin wit]). Nat Moore is a fine wide receiver and Andre Tillman is becoming a good tight end. The offensive line is not quite the same as it was in the glory days of the Dolphins, but it is still one of the best in football. 
Defensively, the Dolphins strength is at linebacker. Kim Bokamper is almost there already. The secondary is young, but Shula felt sure enough about it to trade Vern Roberson to the 49ers as part of the Williams trade. If the defense is to meet the Shula standards, replacements must be found for Duhe and Baumhower. 
The Dolphins will be competitive, but they really must be 
'looking forward to next year. NEW YORK JETS-Coach Walt Michaels is entering his second year as Jet head man and the team seems to be improving. Richard Todd had a close to 400 yard passing game last year against the Raiders. That may be a portent of things to come. Receivers Wesley Walker and Jerome Barkum are the main ingredients in the aerial show. The line is anchored by youngsters Marvin Powell and Chris Ward. Within a few years, the Jets may have the best set of tackles in the game. The Jets running game needs to improve. 
Michaels is installing the 3-4 defense and most of the players are yound and untested. Linebacker Greg Buttle is the star of the defense. Burgess Owens is the best of an average, but still improving, secondary. 
The Jets are stuck with one of the toughest schedules in football. This is a better Jet team than last :year, but the schedule is too tough to expect more than six wins. BUFFALO BILLS-There is no more Juice in Buffalo, and there may be no more fans there either. Chuck Knox has moved to 11pper New York state from Los Angeles and the weather in Buffalo may be as bad as the team will be. 
Terry Miller tries to fill O.J.'s shoes. The rest of the offense is QB Joe Ferguson and WR Bob Chandler. The old Bill offensive line is still there, but it is more difficult to block for ordinary running backs than it is to block for Simpson. _ 
The Bills defense has been poor for years and it will remain so this year. The secondary is the only respectable area wi-th Tqny Greene and Mario Clark guarding the deep zones. 
The Bills might win four games. TOMORROW: THE NFC AND AFC CENTRAL DMSIONS

Irish coaches encouraged; face 'numbers situation' 
by Fnmk I.aGroUa Sporta Writer 
While most of Notre Dame's 
returning sons and daughters spent 
the weekend painting, pa~eling 
and partying, Dan Devine's Fight­
ing Irish took to the field on 
Saturday afternoon for a controlled 
scrimmage. The Blue team out­
scored their white-clad teammates, 
57-7, but the coaches found the 
day's activity encouraging. 
"Today was the first real test for 
the freshmen,'' commented 
Devine. "They realized that their 
performances were very important, 
especially with this year's numbers 
situation." 
The "numbers situation" that 
Devine refered to is causing much 
concern among college football 
coaches. He explained the implica­
tions the 95-man roster may have 
or. the 1978 football season. 
"Notre Dame does not take away a player's scholarship," he empha­sized. "That's one reason the 95-man limitation will hurt us a bit worse than many other schools. The roster limit is at its lowest point since World War II." 
With the roster set at 95 players 
avoiding injuries will be doubly 
important to the Irish. 
"We're looking pretty healthy," commented linebacker coach George Kelly. "We had a couple players sit out Saturday's workout, but they were only minor injuries. Healthwise we look pretty solid." 
A major cause of concern in the 
Tony 
Irish camp is the status of Scott 
Zettek. The supposed heir appar­ent to one of the defensive end positions vacated by graduated All-Americans Ross Browner and :Willie Fry, ·Zettek suffered a severe knee injury last spring and is physically unable to play. His status for the season is listed as questionable. John Hankerd, a sophomore linebacker, is listed as Zetteck's replacement at the end spot. Hankerd, along with Jeff Weston, Mike Calhoun and Jay Case, comprises a defensive line that Coach Joe Yonto terms, "res­pectable." 
"It's really difficult for me to say how good we'll be," Yonto reflect­ed after Saturday's workout. "We probably.won'tknow until the season gets underway. We're working hard and there is improve­ment every day. I'd have to say I'm optimistic." 
Individual statistics from the scrimmage were impressive. Quarterback Joe Montana com­pleted 8 ot 11 attempts for 121 yards while leading the Blue on five successive scoring drives. 
After two Joe Unis field goals, Mike Calhoun recovered a fumble and returned it 19 yards for the score. On their next possession, the Blue offense made good again as Dave Mitchell lumbered into the endzone from the two yard line. Montana did it again as he hit Jim Stone on the next series with a 19­yard pass to make the score 28-0 in favor of the Blue squad. 
·Then Rusty Lisch took over for Montana and directed the Blue machine to two additional touch­downs. The first came early in the third quarter when Lisch, on a quarterback keeper play, went in from the five yard line. On the next series, Dover scampered in from the 8 and gave the Blue a 43-0 advantage. For the afternoon Lisch was 4-of-7 for 46 yards. 
Tim Koegel had a decent after­noon for the White squad. The big sophomore threw the ball 24 times and connected on 9 for 148 yards. Greg Knafelc also directed the White attack with three comple­tions on three attempts. 
On the ground, Jerome Heavens led all rushers with 49 yards on nine carries. Vagas Ferguson was close behind his backfield mate with 34 yards also on nine carries. Ferguson also grabbed receivers honors with three receptions for 37 yards. 
''This season will be a test for our team," summarized Devine. "We are defending the national championship so everyone willplay their best game against us...and we have to face the toughest schedule anyone could ever ima­gine. Missouri, Michigan, Purdue, Michigan State and Pittsburgh in the first five games is enough for 

any team. 

The number one Irish defense, bolstered by the addition of Dave 
"We are looking good," he added. 

Waymer, held the second offensive unit to one touchdown in
"We have a great attitude, we're

Summer is not yet over, but the 1978 professional football season is only a few days away. The schedule of regular season games has been expanded from 14 to 16 games. The expanded schedule should give even more credence to the theory that it is the healthiest, and not necessarily the most talented team which wears the Super Bowl crown. 
In today's first part of a three-part NFL preview, the Eastern divisions of both the National and the American conferences are analyzed. 
NFCEAST 

DALLAS COWBOYS-The Cowboys have been, and remain 
the class of this division. The whole starting cast from last 
year's Super Bowl champion team returns, and the toughest 
job many of these players face is hanging on to their starting 
jobs because some of the anxious youngsters are hungry for 
playing time. 
The offense is directed by veteran quarterback Roger 
Staubach. Although he is 36 years old, the former Navy 
scrambler is still one of the best field generals in the game. 
Running back Tony Dorsett had an outstanding rookie 
season and seems to be on his way to a fine pro career. 
Backfield mate Robert Newhouse is a solid blocker and 
runner. Receivers Drew Pearson and Golden Richards are 
among the best in the NFC, as is tight end Billy Joe DuPree. 
The weakest part of the offensive unit is the line, but even 
that is stronger than last year. Tom Rafferty and Pat 
Donovan are both beginning their second season up front 
and the year's experience should help. 
Co-Super Bowl MVPs Harvey Martin and Randy White lead the reincarnated Doomsday Defense. Both Martin and White play on the line where they are most capably aided by Ed "Too Tall" Jones. Jones had a fine game against ·Minnesota in the NFC championship contest and followed. that with another good game in the Super Bowl. He should 
be ready for his best year. 
The linebacking, headed by sprinter Thomas Henderson, is getting better with each season. The secondary, which has always been sound, boasts the two best safties in football: Cliff Harris and Charlie Waters. Waters was a much-maligned cornerback, but he has found a home at saftey. 
The only area of concern for the Cowboys may be their placekicking. Effren Herrera was traded after he demanded a hnl!,e salary increase. However personnel director Gil E.·andt pointed out at the time of the trade that all of the placekickers in Cowboy history had been signed as free agents. 
The Cowboys should have little trouble in their division and only a bit more in the NFC playoffs. They should be back in the Super Bowl next January. 
WASHINGTON REDSKINS-TheSkins are one ot the many teams in the NFL that hopped on the coaching merry-go­round near the end of last season. New head man Jack Pardee did a good job with the Bears, but he's inheriting a much older group of players in Washington which may have difficulty with the 16 game schedule. 
Quarterback Billy Kilmer is still the hub of the offense. 
The former UCLA single wing tailback has become more 
injury prone with age and his backup, former NO signal 
caller Joe Theismann, could play a crucial role in the Skins 
fortunes this season. Running back Mike Thomas has 
played well for three years, while millionaire John Riggins 
has• been just adequate. Frank Grant and Jean Fugett are 
the two top receivers. The offensive line has been bolstered 
by the recent acquisition of Donnie Hickman and Jeff 
Williams from the Los Angeles Rams. Both should help 
right away. 
Defensively the Skins are solid with the acquisition of tackle Coy Bacon and cornerback Lemar Parrish, and such old veterans as Diron Talbert, Chris Hanburger and Ken Houston. 
Even though George Allen has left the nation's capital, his spirit remains in the form of the special teams. The Skins special teams are the best in the league and, even with the departure of Eddie Brown to the Rams, they should play a crucial role in many close games. 
NEW JERSEY GIANTS-The Giant~ ~re very much the same as last year -they have a solid defense but they can generate little offense. 
The Giants defensive line and linebackers are as good as any unit in the league. Brad Van Pelt has locked up the All-NFC spot at outside linebacker each of the past two seasons and he's just 27. Middle linebacker Harry Carson is being touted as the perennial All-Pro. Up front Troy Archer, Jack Gregory and John Mendenhall are all coming off fine seasons. The secondary needs some help but that may have arrived in the form of rookies Odis McKinney and Terry Jackson. 
The Giants offense is among the dullest in the league. Joe Pisarcik and Jerry Golstyn are fair quarterbacks at best. Larry Csonka is still arond at fullback, but he had only one good game last year. That being the season's finale against the Bears in the ice at Giants stadium. WR Johnny Perkins is developing into the deep threat the Giants need, but he needs someone who can get the ball consistently. The offensive line has added former Steeler Jim Clark and seems much improved. But there is still the weakness at the helm. 
The Giants greatest blessing this year is a relatively easy schedule. Their defense and the punting of Dave Jennings may give them seven or so wins. 
PHiLADELPHIA EAGLES-The Eagles have just what the Giants don't have in quarterback Ron Jaworski, but they lack the supporting cast to bring the infamous Philly fans a winner. 
Besides Jaworski, the big offensive weapon is Harold Charmicheal. The 6-8 wide receiver has been the most consistent Eagle over the past few seasons and he remains Jaworski's favorite target. The only real Eagle running threat is Wilbert Montgomery. Tom ''Silky" Sullivan has been dealt to Cleveland after many productive seasons as an Eagle. The offensive is-spearheaded by Jerry Sisemore and big Stan Walters. · 
The Eagles defense can be described in two words: Bill 
Bergy. The perennial All-Pro leads the Eagles in tackles 
every season. Middle guard Charlie Johnson may be the 
key to how well the Eagles defense performs. Randy Logan 
is the best of an average secondary. 
The Eagles have improved under Dick Vermeil but they 
still lack quality ball players in too many positions. 
ST. LOUIS CARDINALS-Picking the Cardinals to finish last may seem a bit drastic but look at the people they have lost since the end of last season. Terry Metcalf who, despite his fumbling, was the heart and soul of the Big Red offense. Ike Harris may not have been as flashy as Mel Gray, but he was just as effective. Conrad Dobler may have been over-publicized in St. Louis, but he was a good guard for the Cardinals. Finally, they lost Don Coryell, probably the best offensive football coach in the game. 
The Cards still have QB Jim Hart, RB Jim Otis, WR Gray 
and a fine offensive line, but there is no way that they will 
score as many points as they have in recent years. 
The Cards defense is sad. Before he left, Coryell said that 
maybe only one or two of his defensive players could start 
for the N.J. Giants. He is right. The Cardinal defense is 
porous. Remember what Bob Griese did to that defense on 
Thanksgiving day last year? 56 points went on the board 
that day, most of them through the air. 
New coach Bud Wilkinson will have his hands full trying 
to make this Cardinal team resemble those of prior years. 
AFCEAST 

NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS-Last year the Pats were picked 
by many people to win the AFC East, but a funny thing 
happened on the way to the Super Bowl. First and foremost, 
there was the holdout by the two best offensive linemen on 
the team, John Hannah and Leon Gray. That had the team 
in turmoil in the early weeks of the season. Then running 
back Andy Johnson was injured and lost for the season. 
These two events got the Pats off to a slow start from which 
they never recovered. 
But this year should be different. The losss of super 
receiver Darryl Stingly was a shock to everyone connected 
with the team and probably everyone in football. However, 
with the acquisition of Harold Jackson from the Rams, the 
talent loss at that position is not as considerable as it might 
have been. 
Offensively the Pats are led by yound Steve Grogan. Grogan has become one of the best quarterbacks in the league since the Pats traded Jim Plunkett. Plunkett, incidentally, was waived by the 49ers just recently. Sam . Cunningham had a 1,000-yard season last year along with 42 pass receptions. He is the best fullback in football right now. The Pats have another superb player in tight end Russ Francis. It's a toss-up between Francis and Oakland's Dave Casper as the best tight end in football. Hannah and Gray seem to be more content this year, but if either of them falters top pick Bob Cryder from Alabama can take their 
place.
