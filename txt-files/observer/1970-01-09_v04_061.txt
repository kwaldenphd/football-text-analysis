Bringing home the predicament of the Indian 
The following is a personal opinion article submitted bv Notre Dame student Joh~ Wilson. 

To those of you who may not have noticed, Notre Dame this week is the site of a conference on the plight of the American Indian. The lectures and discussions have had fair-sized crowds so far, with only a slight variation of faces at the different events. It is extremely ironic that the overwhelming and silent majority of Notre Dame stu­dents sit in their comfortable rooms in the buildings on the land stolen from the Potawat­omi tribe apparently obliv­ious to the historical and con­temporary conditions that · make our white race guilty of 
genocide.

inhuman murder and stealing: the average income of an American Indian is between $1000-$1500 annually (between one-third and one­half the rather minimal nat­ional poverty level); the aver­age education is 5 years of grade school; the suicide rate is the highest of any ethnic group in the world-in some tribes, reaching the unheard of proportion of ten times the national average; all stan­dards for measuring the qual­ity of medical facilities, from infant and maternal mortality rates to deaths from TB and massacre, and death marches. We continually broke our treaties with the Red man as we discovered that the land stolen at the expense of their 
lives and culture meant more profits for our pockets.

beyond the bounds of contin­

Since what the students

say or do has little relevance on this campus anyway, perhaps a little hope can be found in the words of Fr. Hesburgh, who was appar­ently invited to campus to pinch-hit for fellow liberal rhetorician, H.H. Humphrey. In his talk, Hesburgh gave a good analysis of the historical context for the present prob­lems, a context too often lost to Americans with good guy­bad guy mentalities, which in this case was created by cowboy and Indian propa­ganda of the media and of education (an Indian war is a massacre or a battle depend­ing on who won). He went on to say that the hope for the future lay in education, which several of the Indian representatives had previously expressed. Fr. Hesburgh left before any questions could be asked, but there are several ­that should be answered: Why does Notre Dame have 
o n I y one Indian student? Wha( does Notre Dame have to offer the Indian Amer­icans? Perhaps those q ues­tions are unanswerable, but the following should be answered soon: What in the future will this university provide for Indian Americans and other minority sub­cultures in recruiting, in counselling, in content cour­ses, in environment-in short, in the educational needs that 

.the Indians say they want and definitely have a right to? Let us hope Hesburgh's words will not go the way of other fine rhetoric (like "Christian

Affairs, which a couple of the Red representatives called "the Indian's worst enemy" cannot simply be rejected because it has such complete control. Indians have not been very militant in their demands for human rights since the last Indian war partially because of this Bureau which has both the money to buy elections for puppet tribal leasers, and the power to make the absurd living condition they provide for a dissenting individual and his family even more insub­stantial. Also, the Bureau has done much to perpetuate, or at least, maintain, an envir­onment that, whether inten­tionally or not, could only be d estructie for lnd ians as individuals and as cultures.

Another important q ues­tion was raised by Dr. Olson the first night: How can a university and a president that claims they want to do something for Indians justify 
accepting money from and complying with the recruit­ment for corporations that exploit the Indians of South America? Let us hope that the apparent contradiction between Fr. Hesburgh's words and his acceptance of university complicity to the extent of allowing ten stu­dents to be suspended for protesting that complicity is only apparent, instead of hypocritical. But unless he can and does either answer some serious questions and criticisms, or respond with immediate and effective changes, some one will have to inform the editors of Look magazine that their moral crusader exists only in words.

IS-minute rule 'protects complicity' 
'""'rhis is a second of a series tJf articles which will reprint the defense of the ten students who were suspended for their actions in the now CiA protest. Comments on their philosophies can be addressed to the Observer Box 1/. 
I. Now let us turn to the rule under which we have been summarily suspended and expelled. The rule combines in the over-burdened person of a single administrator the functions of police officer, prosecutor, judge, jury, and academic firing squad. The parallels between this procedure and martial law have been pointed out frequently. What is the reason for this severity? 
2. It is perhaps the most basic impulse of Anglo-Saxon common law-subsumed under the phrase "innocent until proven guilty"-that there be a temporal and personal separation in the process of apprehension, prosecution, judgement, and execution of sentence. This procedure is understood to apply at 
every level of our society, even for the most heinous crimes-murder, rape, the destruction of essential property. It is ludicrous to compare our action to crimes like these; yet the Administration has denied us the protection of this fundamental procedure. What is the reason for this 
? 

3. Finally, it should be clear that not all "disruptive" actions but only those with certain objectives are intended as the object of this rule. One may block a door-way, "substitute force for rational persuasion," or "impede normal University operations" in the course of a panty-raid, a week-end drunk, or an over-exuberant pep rally without fear that the "IS-minute rule" will be used against him. But the rule was immediately conceived and employed in response to actions of this sort 
when those actions were directed to political ends: specifically, ending University complicity. 
4. What, then, is the reason for the 
severity of the rule? The only answer we can surmise is that the Administration sees something much more important at stake when those actions are directed at the political stance of the University than when they merely "infringe on the rights of others" (often much more seriously than we did) with no overt political motive. And what is at stake is the perpetuation of the University as a service station for a system that lives on domestic and foreign countries repression. The IS-minute rule is designed to protect the University's complicity. The Administration seems to believe that the financial life-blood of the University as a research and d ment installation flows on 
with the political subjection of the University to military, governmental, and industrial organizations; the Administration must therefore prevent any effective threat to its political 
alignment and cater to the political opinions of these organizations and of those (wealthy) parents and alumni who share these opinions. It must prevent "embarrassing incidents" as 
well as any effective interference with its political stance. The University's constituency is, in short, not the community of teachers and students within it, but rather that "outside contituency", the political and economic system represented by the Board of Trustees! 
S. The principal audience, therefore, for the promulgation of the IS-minute rule was not the University community but rather that "outside community", for whose purposes the University is being run. It is being told in not uncertain terms that Notre Dame is a "safe" place and that the Administration will brook no interference from students or faculty with the cooperation of the University and that constituency. Of course the Administration must be ever wary of the slightest occasion for the use of that rule in order to demonstrate its resolve and prove in the face of critics from the outside it is no "paper tiger." Now we contend that a rule (a) promulgated-unilaterally and by fiat

If Lyons llall President Bruce Johnson has his way, full co­educational living will come to the Notre Dame campus long hefore anyone expected. John­son has proposed transforming Lyons into a co-ed dorm for the

The details of the proposal can be ironed out in a few weeks time. What is needed is the courage to admit that the proposal makes sense, has been found morally acceptable, and shoutd gladly be made fact m Lyons Hall next semester." 

The written proposal also quoted Father Theodore l-Ies­burgh, President of Notre Dame as saying that "we might create a total educational community that will be greater than the two separate opportunities that have existed thus far." 
obviously in haste, (b) to repress, in the harshest possible fashion any effective interference with the political function of the University, is no rule at all when the political stance which it protects becomes so evil as to be intolerable. 
6. On November 18, 1969, the Notre Dame Administration, fully cognizant of the year long debate concerning University complicity, presented us with an ominous alternative: either (a) we must acquiesce in the administration's endorsement of Dow, the CIA, and the structures and assumptions that they represent by the simultaneous scheduling of recruiting by these two organizations -squarely under the Golden Dome, literally and figuratively; or (b) we must prevent this affirmation of a vicious system, even if it meant that the Draconian rules for the protection of this perverse political relation would be used against us. We could find no third alternative: we therefore chose the 
latter course.

Aft~r reading the defense put out by the ten students who were disciplined for their actions during the Dow-CIA controversy I came away with the strong feeling that it was a time for decision. As the MCS put it, "Now is the time Brothers and sisters, for each and everyone of you to decide..." I have decided. 
The issue of University "complicity" as put forth in the defense gave me a fascinating insight into the workings of the radical mind. The complete paranoic rejection of society and indeed reality is disappointing. 
The condemnation of the University for allowing ROTC on cam­pus for "channeling" its graduates into industry and government, and for investing in corporations is downright childish. 
The question of ROTC has been debated back and forth for so long that it has degenerated into the hurling of hackneyed phrases by both sides. The simple fact of the matter is that the freedom of this nation depends on a strong and effective military. Aggression is deeply imbedded in human nature. I see little hope of eradicating this trait. As long as it exists our only defense will be the military. The only way we can have a strong military is to have a strong officer corps, which ROTC provides. The University would be failing in its duty towards this nation if it did not do all it could to insure a strong defense for it. 
The assertation that the University is "channeling" its graduates into government and industry is myopic to say the least. What other areas of employment are available to a college graduate? There is teaching to be sure, yet how many teachers can we use? There are very few fields of employment which do not fall into either of these two broad categories, so I really can't see any point here at all. I want to work in government. No one has channeled me. In fact I haven't talked about my aspirations with anyone in the school ad­ministration. 
There remains the rather explosive issue of corporate investment. No doubt some radicals will shudder with horror, but I see nothing wrong with Notre Dame investing in any and all legitimate corpora­tions. I include in this group those corporations which manufacture armaments for our nation's defense, or for the war in Vietnam. I see nothing un-Christian in adopting a strong posture of self-defense, or in waging a war to protect our interests by insuring that most of Southeast Asia will remain free. 
In short I completely reject the fanciful notion of "complicity" by the University. As I see it, the universities are a vital part of our society. They equip their graduates with the necessary skills to earn their living in the world. They provide a haven for the intellectuals in our society who are interested in knowledge for the sake of know­ledge, rather than in means of application to everyday life. By having ROTC on campus and by having most of its graduates go into busi­ness and government and by investing in corporations the univer­sities are guilty of nothing more than playing a vital and active role in serving the needs of our free society. 
The decision I mentioned in the opening paragraph concerns my future course of action. I am casting my lot with the forces of sanity. The lines have been drawn and the swords sharpened. There is to be no turning back. The revolution occurring in the country must be aimed towards achieving freedom and justice, not mob rule by left-wing brown shirts. The time is now, and the decision is yours; I have made mine.

Richard Conklin, Director of Public Information, and Phil McKenna, Student Body Presi­dent are among those scheduled to testify. 
If a temporary injunction is granted, the length will then be decided upon. The complaint for injunction states that the defen­dants and their consorts are enjoined and restrained from "congregating or assembling within the Administration Build­ing or in any corridor, stairway, doorway, or entrance thereinto in such a manner as to disrupt or interfere with the normal funct­ion conducted by the Placement Office ... or any other business office of the University." 
The order emphasizes the fact that the four are acting as "rep­resentatives of all others acting in consort or associated with them."

the university would discourage his committee's university benefactors, Dowdall said, "I have already talked to Mr. Frick about this and he showed no such squeamishness." 
While Dowdall p] repared for arranging finances, UAC chairman Tom Kronk turned toward getting the arts moving on campus second semester. Kronk and his group had been promised full use of the fieldhouse next semester with the university picking up the tab for lighting, heating and minor repairs. Permission was also given for one or two members of the UAC to reside in the fieldhouse so that artists can work early in the morning and late at night. 
While neither Dowdall nor Kronk wish to exaggerate the implications of President Hesburgh's letter, both hope that development of an engaging cultural arts center on campus might mean a change in the philosophy of the university from one of professionalism to one of fostering individual student growth. 
"We hope the success of talk about an art center will mean a reversal in the present trend toward technology and mass education in which every student becomes the computer card", said Dowdall. "We hope it means a change away from professionalism of the university, emphasis on graduate prestige, and the depersonaliza­tion of students", he said. 
"The arts is interested in things in people that aren't measurable", said Kronk. "We 

aren't  interested  in  
professionalism  but  in  
developing  the  person,"  he  
added.
