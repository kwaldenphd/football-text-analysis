PR director: Hesburgh not speaker 
By GREG LUCAS Staff Reporter 
Contrary to current rumors, University President Father Theodore Hesburgh will not be this year's commencement speaker, said Richard Conklin, director of Public Relations and Information. 
"I would not be surprised if (Hesburgh) speaks sometime during the ceremony, but he will not be the commencement speaker," Conklin said. 
According to Conklin, invita­tions have been sent out to this year's prospective graduation speaker and approximately 10 or 12 potential honorary degree recipients. 
Conklin said that names will not be released for about three weeks. "Our policy is to wait until we have heard from everyone before releasing names," said Conklin. 
"This year, the honorary degree members will be leaders in the areas that Father Hesburgh himself is distin­guished," such as civil rights and education, Conklin said. 
The the choice of who is in­vited to be commencement speaker is made entirely by Hesburgh and the Board of Trustees, Conklin said. The honorary degree recipients are chosen in the same manner, Conklin added. 


Aide told Reagan twice of Contra money link, according to report 
A'ssociated Press 
WASHINGTON -A Senate committee investigating the Iran-Contra affair could vote within three weeks on immu­nity for former White House aide John Poindexter, who-ac­cording to a published' report ­maintains he twice told the president that Iranian arms sales generated money for the Nicaraguan rebels. 
Some members of the Senate select committee are pushing for a speedy vote on immunity for key figures in the investi­gation, but other senators say that would be too soon. 
One congressional source said the Senate panel is "mov­ing toward a decision one way or the other'' on whether to give immunity to Poindexter, the former national security ad­viser, and fired White House aide Lt. Col. Oliver North, and perhaps North's associate, retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard Secord. 
But the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said it was too soon to say whether the necessary two-thirds majority of committee members would vote for immunity. 
Meanwhile, The Washington Post, citing "a well-placed le­gal source," said Poindexter contends that on two occasions in 1986 he told President Reagan that the arms sales to Iran were generating money for the Contras. 
This source, according to the newspaper's Sunday editions, said Poindexter did not tell the president of illegal diversion of the money, but did say the funds contributed by the Iranians or Israelis were a side benefit of the arms sales. 
A close Navy associate of Poindexter, who the newspa­per did not identify, said Poin­dexter in December told him his actions followed "the chain of command." 
White House officials, accor­ding to a "source close to the president" quoted by the Post, anticipate that Poindexter "will say he had direction and authority, directly or indirect­ly" from Reagan and that the former security adviser's tes­timony could damage the pres­ident's claim that he did not know of any diversion of funds from the arms sales to the Con­tras. 
The Tower commission, ap­pointed by the president to in­vestigate the Iran-Contra af­fair, said it found no evidence to dispute Reagan's contention that he had no knowledge of the diversion.

Work begins on athletic facility with astroturf surface 
By DIANE SCHROEDER Staff Reporter 
Construction is underway on a $6-million sports center in the northeast sector of the Notre Dame campus. 
The 600 by 200-foot building will be named for its principle benefactor and 1949 alumnus, John R. Loftus of St. Charles, Ill. 
The center is being built near the Eck Tennis Pavilion, which is also under construction. 
The new facility will be used primarily for varsity athletes, said Athletic Director Gene Corrigan. Areas previously used by var­sity athletes at the ACC will then be made available to Notre Dame students and fac­ulty members, he said. Those participating in intramural ac­tivities and physical education classes will also have access to the new facilities. 
The new building will encom­pass Meyo Field, an astroturf surface encircled by a track. 
Construction, which began four weeks ago, is scheduled to be completed by the end of Oc­tober, said Don Dedrick, direc­tor of the physical plant. 
The surrounding space will accommodate a weight room and exercise area, as well as sports classes and conference rooms, according to Corrigan. 
"One of the greatest benefits is the massive amount of space the building will make avail­able for recreation while reduc­ing the congestion at the Ath­letics and Convocation Center," said Corrigan. 
The new indoor track will be one of the finest in the country, allowing for faster times, said Corrigan. 
"Because the track will be so large, there will be fewer turns which will allow for more straight-away track and faster 


Mountain man Claude Dallas finally captured 
Associated Press 
RIVERSIDE, Calif. -Self­styled mountain man Claude Dallas, who escaped from the Idaho State Pententiary after being convicted of killing two state Fish and Game wardens, was captured Sunday in Cali­fornia, the FBI said. 
Dallas, using the alias Al Schrenk, was peacefully ar­rested at a convenience market in this ranching-area commu­nity 50 miles east of Los An­geles, said FBI spokesman Fred Regan. 
Dallas apparently had friends in the area, authorities said. 
"It's been a good day, a great day," said Owyhee County, Idaho, Sheriff Tim Nettleton after hearing about the cap­ture. Nettleton headed the ini­tial investigation that led to the 1982 capture of Dallas in Paradise Hill, Nev. 
"Claude Dallas, in the excep­tion of being a game hog and game officer killer, was a nice guy. A lot of people share his sentiments but they don't kill people." 
Dallas, 37, became a folk hero to some after cutting his way through two prison fences on March 30, Easter Sunday, and fleeing into the high desert of southern Idaho and northern Nevada. He was serving a 30­year sentence for manslaughter. 
Many admirers saw Dallas as a modern-day version of the rugged individual of the Old West. He was the subject of a CBS-TV movie last year, "Manhunt: Search for Claude Dallas," which many critics said romanticized the killer. 
"He's as much of a Western hero as Charles Manson," au­thor Jack Olsen, who researched Dallas for his book "Give a Boy a Gun," had said earlier. "Dallas would kill a lawman with about the same guilt and conscience as he eats his Wheaties in the morning." 
Dallas had managed to elude authorities for 16 months before finally being arrested in the 1981 slayings of the two game wardens, Bill Pogue and Conley Elms. 
He was put on the FBI's 10 Most Wanted list 47 days after his prison escape. A reward fund had grown to more than $15,000. 

times," said Corrigan. "Most indoor tracks have ten laps to the mile, and ours will have only five or six." 
The track and field area of the north dome of the ACC will be turned into basketball courts for the students, and the ACC varsity weight room will also be made accessible to the students, according to Cor­rigan.

ABC and CBS told the Writers Guild of America on Sunday that the union must pay for health benefits for 525 striking employees. Representatives of management and the union met for about eight hours Sunday to try to end the week-old strike, which began over what the union said were job security issues. They recessed at 9 p.m., and talks were to resume at 2 p.m. Tuesday, said union spokes­man Martin Waldman. "During the session, some minor areas were resolved, but there still has been no resolution of major issues," Waldman said. -Associated Press

Activity advisers should let students make the decisions 
Like the rest of the seniors, come spring break, my four years with The Observer will end. From then on, sitting at the managing editor's desk will be Mark Pankowski. It'll be up to him to handle the daily crises and to stay up until dawn, if necessary, to get the paper to the printer. 
Mark, I wish you nothing but the best. 
As I look back on four years, one of the things that has made working for The Observer so exciting is the ability to make decisions and to take responsibility for my actions. It's this decision-making ability that has motivated me to continue with this organization for four long years. Needless to say, the experiences I've had made it all worthwhile. 
But this year, the headlines in The Observer have marked an interesting but disturbing trend away from student leadership and respon­sibility. 
Consider Senior Bar. At the end of last se­mester, the Office of Student Activities hired a full-time general manager to oversee the opera­tions of the student-run Senior Club. The new professional manager assumed some of the re­sponsibilities that were previously solely han­dled by the student managers. 
Consider the incident with Scholastic. When the student editors ran an illustration showing a sexually explicit scene, the Office of Student Activities shut them down. Everyone cried "censorship." While the independence of stu­dent media is important, the real issue, I think, is that the Office of Student Activities, their "publisher," no longer trusts the student editors, whoever they may be in future years, to make responsible decisions. The student editors may have made a bad decision to run the artwork showing a sexually explicit scene. But the student editors should have been left to take the lumps from the bad publicity that the decision might have caused. 
Next consider what happened with the Dan­cin' Irish. The faculty board in control of ath­letics disbanded the Dancin' Irish on Jan. 20 after receiving letters complaining about the group's performances. The appeals committee reinstated the Dancin' Irish for one more year but added several stipulations to the organiza­tion's new lease on life. One of these was the appointment of an adviser to assume duties that the group's co-captains had previously handled. 
The trend that I perceive in each of these three incidents is that student leaders are playing less and less of a role in responsible decision-making because the University has decided that professionals are more competent to make vital decisions than are students. 


Of course, they're right. Professionals can do a better job running Scholastic or Senior Bar. But the point is is that students need to learn how to make 'decisions and they must be allowed to make the mistakes that decision-making in­evitably entails. . 
How should the University manage student­run organizations without impinging on their independence? Having advisers who would guide and direct, but leave the work and the responsibility to the students, is one good way. Advisers should never perform the work for the students, but should assist them when they encounter problems. 
Advisers should not be merely appointed by the University; they should be chosen by the student leaders and approved by the appropri­ate office within the administration. 
The Office of Student Activities should not have hired a full-time manager for Senior Bar. Instead, the student leaders should have hired someone to perform the bookkeeping and fin­ancial duties. This way, the students would have maintained the responsibility for running the organization. The Office of Student Activities could have remained in the position as adviser without intruding on student management. 
I sincerely hope that this trend will not touch The Observer after I'm gone. In the meantime, it's comforting to know that sitting at the desk I now occupy will be someone who will be able to make decisions, both good and bad, and to do the work that needs to be done.

Group sponsors collection contest 
By CARl MARTINEZ 
News staff 
The Friends of the Library are sponsoring "Print and Sound Collector's Contest ­1987" for Notre!Dame graduate and undergraduate students who have literary and music collections. 
The purpose of the contest is to recognize and encourage the intelligent formation of per­sonal libraries by Notre Dame students. Entries will be judged on the basis of a unify­ing theme and a discriminating selection of titles. 
Entries need not be extensive -25 titles would be sufficient. Deadline for entries is March 23. 
According to Vikki Maac­houk, special assistant to the Director of Libraries, the themes represent great diver­sity. "They include books, magazines, newspapers, com­pact discs, records, tapes ex­panded to poetry and new wave. I think the contest is unique. You can take it in any

direction you want to go. It's very broad. 
"This will be the first time the Friends have sponsored such a contest," said Maac­houk, who keeps contacts be­tween the group and the li­brary. 
Since the contest is new, the requirements for entries are loosely set to encourage creativity and allow for ver­sitility. 
"Because of the broadness of the contest it is hard to come up with judges and set rules. This is why we've decided to leave it quite loose. Those who will be judging include repre­sentatives from the music de­partment, English department and two librarians," she said. 
Kristen Trimme, American studies public relations intern, proposed the idea fQr the con­test last spring along with the help of John Harlan, special as­sistant to the Director of Libra­ries. 
"The Friends wanted a new activity and they liked Kris­ten's idea," said Maachouk. 
The proposal was approved last year in July 1987. 
To enter one must submit an essay of up to 500 words describing the origins and de­velopment of their collection. A bibliography must also be in­cluded. 
Winners will be awarded cash prizes and their collec­tions will be displayed in the department of Special Colllec­tions. They will also be invited to a special awards ceremony to be held March 31, 1987. David Vaisey, the librarian of the Bodleian Library of Oxford University, England, will ad­dress the Friends and winners on the occasion. 
The Friends of the Library is an association that has devoted its attention to the strengthen­ing of the Libraries in many ways. Basically, it assists in the funding for important ma­terials beyond the Libraries' budget, enabling the Libraries to expand their role as a cul­tural institution.

Security Beat 
The following incidents were re­ported to Notre Dame Security this week: 
Friday 
12:40 a.m. -An off-eampus gradua~e student's car was damaged while 1t was parked in the C-1lot. The damage was caused by another vehicle in a hit­and-run accident. No estimate of damage has been set. 
2:15a.m.-An off-eampus student re­ported the theft of his leather flight Jacket from the coat roo~ at t~e Alumni-Senior Club. The Jacket IS valued at $275. 
3:27 a.m. -A resident of Dillon Hall reported that he had been assaulted while at Chip's Lounge on S. Eddy Street. The assault took place at ap­proximately 2 a.m. The student was treated at St. Joseph Medical Center for minor injuries. Security is inves­tigating for possible suspects. 
2:00p.m.-The rector of Flanner Hall reported the theft of a set of window drapes from the elevator lobby of Flanner. The loss is approximately $500. There are no suspects at this time.

last day of classes before finals," McDaniel said. 
She said the station originally planned to begin broadcasting during the first week of March. "While we've received the equipment, trans­mitters and rack cabinets, we're still installing that equip­ment. 
"The equipment took longer to build than we and the com­pany expected," said McDaniel. She said she was hop!ng the equipment would ar­rive before March, "but it didn't arrive until last Friday." 
Another reason for the delay was that the station asked for special metering devices. "These meters can detect prob­lems with the transmissions of air waves, such as problems with the sound quality, or in­ability to broadcast to a certain dorm," said Me Daniel. 
She said a company called Radio Systems, Inc., based in Edgemont, Penn. is manufac­turing the equipment. 
The station decided to broad­cast with "100 percent facility power instead of using the old equipment which may produce more static. We want to make sure the system is tested and fine," she said. 
The offices will move from the O'Shaughnessy Towers to the second floor of LaFortune. McDaniel said not all of the equipment in the new office is new. "We have. the same turnt­able, cassette deck, and pro­gram board." 
McDaniel said the station 
may conduct a big promotional 
campaign because the station 
has been off the air for so long. 
She said staff morale is high. "They're psyched to get back from break and get on the air. Everyone has missed broad­casting," she said. 

3:15p.m. -A Dillon Hall resident re­ported that another vehicle had struck and damaged his car while it was parked in the Main Circle. Damage is estimated at $300. 
3:47p.m.-A Law School student re­ported that his wallet was stolen from his coat while he was in the library of the Law School. The coat was left on a chair in one of the study areas. Loss is set at $25. 
4:50 p.m. -A resident of Sorin Hall reported that vandalism had been done to his car while it was parked in the D-2 lot. The right wing vent latch was broken but no entry was made to the car. Damage is estimated at $100. 
9:00p.m-A University employee re­ported that the hood ornament from her car had been broken off while it was in the bookstore lot. Damage is set at $50. 
9:15p.m.-A resid~nt of O'Hara-Grace reported the theft of her bike. The bike was locked near the Engineering building at the time of the theft. Loss · is $80. 
10:30 p.m.-A resident of Mishawaka reported that the hood ornament from his 1986 Mercedes Benz was stolen while the car was parked in White Field. Value on the hood ornament is approximately $100. 
10:40 p.m. -Two vehicles were in­volved in a property damage traffic accident near the corner of Edison Road and Juniper Road. The first ve­hicle was stopped in traffic when the second car came from behind and struck the first from the rear. The driver of the second car said he was 
having problems with the brakes. Da­mages to both cars combined is ap­proximately $1,000. 
Saturday 
3:45p.m.-Security along with the ND Fire Department responded to Sorin Hall on an alarm. Upon arrival, units found that two posters on a bulletin board on the third floor had been set on fire. A third floor resident of Sorin found the fire and extinguished it prior to the arrival of the fire department. 
6:30p.m.-While on patrol, .a security officer found a down vest m the D-2 lot. The vest is being held at security until an owner can be contacted. 
9:40p.m.-A Granger, IN resident re­ported that his jacket was stolen from the arena of the ACC while he was at­tending the High School Sectional bas­ketball game. The victim sets ioss at $100. 
10:59 p.m.-Security and ND Fire De­partment responded to a false fire alarm at the ACC Units from both de­partments checked the building but no sign of fire was found. The alarm is believed to have been caused by a prankster. 
Sunday 
12:25 a.m. -A resident of South Bend reported that his car had been van­dalized while it was parked south of the ACC. The car's sunroof had been broken out and the vents of the car were thrown on the pavement. Damage is set at $220. 
1:45 a.m.-A Dillon Hall resident re­ported that as he was leaving the Alumni-Senior Club in his car, an un­known person struck his car with his bare hand. The driver then stopped the car to find out why this had been done. The suspect then continued to hit the windshield of the car until it cracked. When the driver asked why, the suspect came after the driver. At this point the driver left in his car. Damage is estimated at $200. The suspect is believed to be another Notre Dame stu­dent. 
Indictments expected in Iran deal 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK -Investigators working for the special prose­cutor examining the Iran arms deal expect to bring indict­ments and are studying cri­minal charges against current and former government offi­cials, The New York Times re­ported in Monday editions. 
The newspaper cited law en­forcement officials with knowl­edge of the investigation as saying investigators are focus­ing on at least three felonies: conspiring to defraud the gov­ernment, obstructing justice and making false statements to the government. 
The officials said special prosecutor Lawrence Walsh and his staff had not ruled out anyone, including senior Reagan administration offi­cials, as suspects, according to the Times.

'Amerika' demonstrates realistic loss of freedom 
Elliott Richardson, former Attorney General and Secretary of Defense un­der President Nixon, called it "xenop­hobic and "McCarthyesque .. both ludi­crous and dangerously misleading." Jeff Cohen of Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting groaned that "this shows the Soviets as dying to get at us.. it's the premise that's the problem.',:.Jts star, Kris Kristofferson, was disgu~d by it. "I hate the idea.'' Veteran Moscow cor­respondent Harrison Salisbury said it unrealistically shows a future United States "turning into a mass of quiver­ing protoplasm." So what was all the fuss about? Believe it or not, it was about ABC's miniseries Amerika. 
Kevin Smant 
guest column 

The show, charged left-wing critics, portrayed the Soviet Union as evil con­querors desiring nothing less than the total subjugation of the United States. In this way, it raises the temperature of East-West relations and possibly brings us a step closer to war. Part of Amerika was shot on location in Toronto. During the filming, protesters garbed in white robes drifted slowly 



P.O.BoxQ 
Only abstinence can stop AIDS epidemic 

Dear Editor: 
It was disappointing to read Tom Varnum's article appearing in the Feb. 25 edition of The Observer. Mr. Var­num's "preventive cure" for AIDS is reflective of the very same attitude which led to the intitial rise of the dis­ease -whatever feels good, do it; have sex, but make it "safe"; "protect your­self." I fail to understand how one fights promiscuity with invitation toward in­creasing promiscuity -and the adver­tising of condoms is just that. It will no more reduce the cases of AIDS than promoting the "pill" was "supposed" to decrease the number of unwanted pregnancies. The quick fix is really no fix; it only treats the symptoms of a much deeper and much more fatal problem. 
Doonesbury 
through the streets, holding lighted candles, and passing out leaflets. Propaganda Alert, screamed their message. The Cold War Comes To Our Neighborhood! 
In a way, peace protesters of this kind have always had powerful argumenta­tive tools. With shaky voice and un­steady hands they point to the gloom of cemeteries filled with war dead; to the pictures of the utter destruction and waste left by atomic bombs in Hiros­hima and Nagasaki; and to the current piles of nuclear weapons stocked by the Superpowers. War must be avoided at all costs, they preach. Hence a con­frontation with the Soviets, too, must be avoided. 
We on the other side have no such visible reminders. We have only an abstract ideal -one that is con­spicuously missing from the arguments of many peace activists. That ideal is freedom. And it is here that ABC's Amerika performs it most valuable ser­vice. Amerika presented to us, in living color, a horrifying vision of what it would mean to lose our freedom. Schoolchildren in this type of society are indoctrinated with a Marxist ver­sion of history. Capitalist America was evil, filled with enslaved workers and 
the decadent, wealthy few. The new or­der brings a vision of "socialist brot­herhood.'' All opponents of this new vi­sion must be "crushed.'' Talent is no longer the only criterion, a dancer is told. One now must also "cooperate." Those people that, for one reason or another, have run afoul of the govern­ment are "exiled" to distant places, and must live in shantytowns amid poverty and squalor. All news filters through a "National Network"; un­desirable happenings are censored. Due to the lack of food (the bulk of which has been expropriated for more deserving socialist brothers), coffee shops serve soybean pancakes and er­satz coffee. In order to travel from one "administrative district" to another in this new Amerika, one must have a spe­cial passport -obtainable only from the government. Sould one break any law, a "psychiatric hospital" could be one's next stop, in order to eliminate "antiso­cial behavior.'' And one could go on and on. 
It is important for us to see such things. Today, in our country, we have the freedom to believe what we wish, to live where we wish, and to worship what we wish. Almost no country has our material abundance. But what many seem not to understand is that 
Self-denial does not have to become a fad before it becomes livable. The Christian message is one of purification rather than self-gratification, and in­cludes the recognition that death may mean spiritual as well as physical. 
Robert Nicholas 


The Church is allowed to make some mistakes 
Dear Editor: 
In response to Steve Hipp's March 4 column, "Conscience Must be Formed Using Moral Precepts," I would like to share the observations of a Church his­torian. 
I did not attend Regina Coil's lecture, but based on the information provided by Mr. Hipp -what he terms "representative quotes" which I will presume capture the gist of her talk ­I remain puzzled as to how he can con­clude that Coli "rejects the authority of the magisterium.'' I see nothing overtly anti-Catholic in what she said. In fact, her basic argument, that the Church is culturally conditioned and in a constant process of historical evolu­tion, is not some fabrication of dissident American theologians. This view of the organic development of the Church ­commonplace among professional his­torians and theologians -was cogently argued by John Henry Newman back in the nineteenth century. 
In condemning Coli's view of the evolution of the Church, Mr. Hipp demonstrates that he has an a­historical understanding of the Catholic tradition. Does he really believe that Jesus gave us the Roman Catholic Church and all of its disciplinary decrees lock, stock and barrel? No in­formed thinker would defend such an anachronistic view of Church history. 
If Mr. Hipp were to crack open a good history book of the Church, he would

freedom, this abstract ideal, must be defended. Communist and other totalitarian regimes are not blind. They know, deep inside, that given a choice, people will choose a free society. Mil­lions of residents from behind the Iron Curtain have thus "voted with their feet" since 1945. There would be more, but such hindrances as the Berlin Wall, barbed wire borders, and mine fields have deterred would-be escapees. It should be no surprise, then, that there are those in this world who do not wish freedom well. In that sense, Amerika was right on target. 
Americans, than, need to realize their blessings. They need to participate in their democracy to assure its continued survival. We should be proud of what we have built here. And we need not be ashamed to take the steps necessary to defend it. Nikolai Vishnevsky of the So­viet Novosti "news agency" growled that the airing of Amerika would "boost anti-Sovietism.'' Well, anti-Soviet atti­tudes aren't as prevalent as I would like, Nikolai. But as long as the Soviet Union stands for what it does, I'll keep trying. 
Kevin Smant is a graduate student in history. 
find numerous instances where some of the Church's teachings -culturally and historically conditioned as they were -were re-examined, re-defined or scrapped. For example, the medieval Church condemned usury in no uncer­tain terms, but no prelate or pope would argue today that charging interest on a loan is a mortal sin. 
I think that Mr. Hipp needs to take a second look at what magisterial author­ity means and how it is formed. We Catholics are not Biblical fundamen­talists, nor should we look upon every word which issues from a pope or car­dinal as an infallible statement (the pope is only infallible when he speaks ex cathedra, and how often does he do that?) After all, the Church, though a divine institution, is run by men; and men, even those of good will, some­times make mistakes.

We all get enough of that in the real world. We don't need it on a TV show that formulates our minds. 
Perhaps the most important message I got out of watching "Sesame Street" last Monday came in a little skit about memories of the past and how they can blind a person to the realities of the present and the hope of the future. (Sure that's kind of a heavy interpretation to a piece which involved green turtle puppets that talk. but...) S!eze the moment it said. The present is the most Important thing. Appreciate every day. It was an Ironic message to get out of a television trip down memory lane. 
I would recommend "Sesame Street" to anyone of any age now. It'll be the new college craze in a while, you watch. Settle down some Friday after­noon with a few beers. Bag the car~oons, just like your mom always told you. Watch "Sesame Street." I'll guarantee you more laughs than any "Mr. Belvedere" rerun. A simple pocket of your childhood still exists every afternoon on PBS.

in the last minute. 
"In the second half, we felt that if you go at Dayton more and get them in foul trouble, you're going to create more. I thought we just stayed with it long enough to where once we got the lead, we just iced it. We iced it with foul shooting and with good defense when Dayton was starting to take the longer shots and we got the rebounds." 
The Irish started the game with Sean Connor filling in for Scott Hicks, who sprained his ankle in the Miami (Fla.) game last Thursday. The sprain was not serious, but Phelps decided to let Hicks rest his ankle in order to get him ready for the NCAA tournament. 
Dayton head coach Don Donoher started all four of his seniors, guard Dan Christie, forwards Anthony Grant and Ed Young and center Don Hughes, in the team's last home game of the season. 
The Irish took an early 3-0 lead when Stevenson was fouled on a power layup. Stevenson finished with 13 points, including a perfect seven-of-seven from the line. But Dayton guard Noland Rob­inson and forward Anthony Corbitt went to work on the Irish inside to give the Flyers a lead they would hold until late in the second half. 
Irish forward Scott Paddock fouled Corbitt as he made a layup. The free throw gave Dayton a 17-15 lead. Corbitt then went baseline for a field goal, and Robinson added a short jumper and two layups to increase the lead to 23-17, firing up the crowd at UD Arena. 
Meanwhile Notre Dame was ice cold from the field, shooting .267 in the first half. 
"The first half we had good shots, but we weren't making those shots," said Phelps. "Rivers, Royal and Stevenson were four for 21 in the first half, and that's just horrible. You're not going to beat people doing that on the road and you're not going to beat people in the tournament." 
Rivers took control in the second half, hitting six-of-eight shots from the field, including the three-pointer. On one layup, the junior guard cut around three defenders to make the shot. He finished with a game-high 19 points. 
Irish center Gary Voce was the only player in double fig­ures in rebounds. Voce grabbed 11, several of those down the stretch when Notre Dame closed the gap. 
J a mere Jackson saw the most playing time since early in the season, registering 22 minutes. The freshman guard was two­of-three from the field and grabbed three rebounds. 
Dayton's Grant and Corbitt both took Irish defenders into the paint before pulling up for short jumpers. Grant finished the game with 17 and Corbitt added 14.

Irish women end season with win as Gavin, Botham reach milestones 
By MARTY STRASEN Assistant Sports Editor 

DAYTON, Ohio -The Notre Dame women's basketball season did not end with the sen­timental graduation of seniors, the winning of a conference championship or the garnering of a tournament bid. 
But Saturday at the Univer­sity of Dayton Arena, the 1986­87 campaign ended the way Irish head coach Mary DiS­tanislao wanted it to end. It ended with pride, and with a 59-48 dumping of North Star Conference foe Dayton behind a balanced scoring attack and some scrappy play throughout. 
"Our loss to Tennessee ear­
lier in the year was probably 
the most embarrassing defeat 
this program has ever had," 
said DiStanislao, whose squad 
was blown out, 90-55, by the 
eighth-ranked Volunteers. "We 
had a choice to make. We could 
either finish 7-20, or we could 
work hard and go out winners." 
The Irish chose the latter 
route, and Saturday's victory 
marked their sixth straight 
since the Tennessee disaster, 
giving them a final record of 
12-15 after the slowest start in 
the history of Notre Dame wo­
men's basketball. 

"On paper, you'd have to say the play of Annie (freshman Annie Schwartz) was the key to the turnaround'," said DiS­tanislao. "But the heart and soul of it was the juniors -Mary Gavin, Sandy Botham and

Associated Press 

NEW YORK -Villanova, col­lege basketball's national champion in 1985, leads the field for the 50th edition of the National Invitation Tourna­ment, it was announced last night. 
The Wildcats, 15-15, were among the 30 teams named to the field. The remaining two teams, as well as the sites for two of the games, will be an­nounced today. Missing from the list of 30 was Louisville, the defending national champion which was passed over by the NCAA for its field of 64 earlier Sunday.

Kathy Barron. They've done a great job leading and the others have done just as good a job following." 
Schwartz, who has found her role as a constant threat from the outside for the Irish, scored 14 points and hauled down a game-high eight rebounds, while Botham worked the middle for 14 points of her own. 
Notre Dame scored 11 con­secutive points and jumped out to an early 11-2 lead, but the hot hand of Michele Kruty brought the Lady Flyers back to within striking range. An Irish run near the end of the half gave Notre Dame a 25-18 lead at intermission, and Dayton never pulled to within seven the rest of the way. 
At times it seemed amazing that no punches were thrown in the contest (outside of a few minor. shoves during the course of play), as the game turned into an endless struggle for po­sition. 
"Our games with Dayton and DePaul are always wars," DiS­tanislao said. "It's the rivalry -but I love it. It gives us extra incentive. 
"We thought that if we con-· 
trolled the boards and shut 
down their inside game, we 
could take it to them. (Kathy) 
O'Brien hurt us (17 points, 15 
in the second half), but we hung 
tough and were hitting our 
shots in the second half." 

Botham and leading Irish scorer Heidi Bunek, Notre Dame's version of the Twin Towers, were both hit with their fourth fouls early in the second half, and were out of the game for a crucial four-minute stretch from the 11 :00 to 7: 03 marks. 
During that time, freshman walk-on Molly Mahoney lined up in the middle of the 2-3 zone, and the Irish held on to a nine­point lead until Botham and Bunek were re-inserted. 
Notre Dame outshot the Flyers, 53.2 percent to 37.5 per­cent, and also had a. pair of players reach milestones in the game. 
Botham's second of two free throws with 18: 23 left in the first half marked her 1,000th career point. She is the fifth player in Irish history to reach that milestone. 
Gavin dished out nine more assists in the game, giving her a career total of 194 and sur­passing Mary Beth Schueth's old mark of 187 to make her Notre Dame's all-time leader. 
Freshman Cathy Emigholz gave the Irish a boost with her hard-nosed play, especially in the second half, as she picked up 10 points. Gavin added nine and sophomore Diondra Toney eight. 
"It's always too soon to quit," DiStanislao smiled, "and never too late to be a win­ner."

Irish hockey ends year, takes sec,ond in ACHA playoffs 
By CHRIS DALLAVO Sports Writer 

It was the American Col­legiate Hockey Association's first tournament, Lefty's last, and Michigan-Dearborn's best. The Wolves came from the fourth seed to win, beating the Irish 6-4 in Saturday night's championship game. 
Notre Dame played its best game of the year Friday night in crushing Lake Forest 4-1, while Michigan-Dearborn beat Kent State 6-1 to set up Satur­day's final. 

Lefty

and 50 players sent to major college hockey. 
In taking the Notre Dame head coaching position in 1968, Smith undertook the task of building a program literally from the ground up, since var­sity hockey had not been played since the days of the Four Horsemen. He even had to buy the equipment and run the ice rink. 
The program has developed considerably in his 19 seasons. The Irish joined the Western Collegiate Hockey Association in 1970, where Smith quickly led the program to national prominance. During the 1972-73 season, the Irish powered their way to the WCHA finals, losing on a controversial goal in the final minutes to Wisconsin. That team featured eventual NHL stand-out Bill Nyrop, and Smith was voted coach of the year for his efforts in molding the team. 
During the 1981-82 season, 
the Irish switched from the 
WCHA to the Central Collegiate 
Hockey Association. Smith's 
star that year was Dave Poulin, 
now the captain of the Philadel­
phia Flyers. 

After dropping the program down to the club level in 1983­84, Smith regrouped his players and began once again to rebuild. He realizes that, with­out scholarships, it is tough to compete with some of the other schools. 
"We have to recruit a special kind of player," Smith says. "He has to be intelligent, have

Friday, the Irish jumped in front of the Foresters on a power-play goal by team cap­tain Mike McNeill, but Lake Forest tied the game at 1-1 early in the second period. 
Brian Montgomery regained the lead for the Irish 19 seconds later, and Tom Mooney buried a shot behind Lake Forest goaltender Gary Willette to give the Notre Dame the 3-1 lead it never lost. 
Bob Bilton capped off the Irish scoring, taking a fantastic feed from Mooney and firing a shot past the sprawled-out Wil-

"All phases of our game were good -the specialty teams, goaltending, and all four lines contributed,'' commented Irish head coach Lefty Smith. "It was as well as we played all year." 
Unfortunately, Saturday did not end as happily for the Irish, as they were unable to hold any of the three leads which they had over Michigan-Dearborn. 
Bob Herber opened the scoring before the Parents' Night crowd eight minutes into the first period, converting a nice pass from John Welsch into a 1-0 Irish lead. Ron Duda scored for the Wolves midway through the second period, tying the score at 1-1 and touch­ing off a flurry of goals. 
Tim Kuehl came back for the Irish, tipping in a Kevin Markovitz shot for a 2-1 lead. Rick Osburn tied the game two minutes later, beating Irish goaltender Lance Madson on the glove side. 
Mooney, who along with Bil­ton led the Irish in tournament scoring, put the Irish back on top a minute later. Notre Dame enjoyed that lead for the next nine seconds before the Wolves tied it at 3-3. 
That left the third period, and Lefty's last, to decide the game. Frantic action at both ends of the ice resulted in Joe MacDougall's second goal, giving the Wolves a 4-3 lead. Ken Chaput scored what

The Irish refused to fold as Tim Caddo tallied while being pulled to the ice, leaving them down 5-4. A penalty gave the Irish a power-play in the last minute of the game, but it was not meant to be. The Wolves rounded out the scoring on an open-net goal with nine seconds remaining. 
"We made a couple of crucial mistakes which wound up cos­ting us," Smith noted. "I was glad to see us come back -we never gave up. It was a very good tournament for the ACHA, though. The competi­tion was tremendous." 
The lone Irish representative on the All-Tournament Team was defenseman Lance Patten, who joined five Michigan­Dearborn players on the squad. 
enough money to go here, and be a good hockey player. The good ones usually go to the big­ger schools with scholarships." 
With the formation of the new American Collegiate Hockey Association, Smith feels that the potential is there for a promising future. 
"I've tried to establish a solid base here," says the veteran of 19 Irish campaigns. "I have tried to create a philosophy and some traditions which can put us on the road back. I think we are on the right track now." 
Through all of the problems and pitfalls which have faced Smith and the Notre Dame hockey program, he has managed to compile a 307-320­31lifetime record.

Irish slated for Charlotte after defeating Dayton

Close fights highlight finals of 57th annual Bengal Bouts 
By KELLY TOWNSEND Sports Writer 

Friday night, Stepan Center was packed by spectators eager to witness the final bouts in the 57th annual Notre Dame Bengal Bouts. Not to be disap­pointed, the crowd witnessed many close bouts and outstand­ing performances. 
The action began with one of the most interesting matchups of the evening. Eric 'Dingo' Bender took on his roommate Kevin 'the Vigilante' Duggan for the Junior Lightweight title. Despite their relationship, both fought with a determination to win. Both boxers kept up a con­tinuous onslaught of punches, much to the !ielight of the crowd. 
By the third round, Bender and Duggan were near the end of their strength. Duggan drew upon a reserve supply of en­ergy and was able to rally with a solid right-left combination to win the bout by a unanimous decision. 
"This isn't worth boxing ex­cept for the cause," said 'Dingo' Bender. "We're not fighting because we like to hit each other. The whole point is to feed the starving people in Bengladesh." 
In the Junior Welterweight final, David 'Sugar' Cane faced Tim 'the Sniper' Hartigan in the first split decision of the evening. In the first two rounds, Hartigan maintained control of the bout, using his power to weaken Dave. In the third round, Cane came back with hard jabs and elusive foot­work that cut down Hartigan's domination of the bout. 'The Sniper' still emerged as the winner by a split decision. 
In the bloodiest fight of the night, Jack 'the Honeymooner' Gleason and 'Righteous' Ray Powers exchanged punches with no regard for style or skill. By the second round, both boxers were bleeding but nei-

ther seemed to notice. Powers connected with a hard right to give Gleason a standing eight­count. Gleason was able to shake off the blow, only to be driven back into a corner by Powers. 
In the third round Powers sent Gleason down and out of the ring, causing the referee to stop the bout 51 seconds into the round. The power of

ND comes back to top UD, 62-56 
By PETE GEGEN Assistant Sports Editor 
DAYTON, Ohio -In a scenario familiar to Irish basketball fans, Notre Dame came from behind to beat Dayton, 62-56, Saturday afternoon. 
After the Flyers had held the lead for most of the second half, Notre Dame's Mark Stevenson hit two free throws to put the Irish up, 50-49. David Rivers then widened the gap by hitting a three­pointer with 2:45 left in the game. 
"There were 15 seconds left on the 
shot clock," said Rivers. "We got into 
our offense, but we weren't able to exe­
cute it. I was sort of left alone, and I

shot." 

Dayton guard Dan Christie kept it close by hitting two field goals and a three-pointer down the stretch, but Irish forward Donald Royal, guard Jamere Jackson and Rivers together hit seven-of-eight free throws to seal it for Notre Dame. 
"It's typical of us, as you've seen all year," said Irish head coach Digger Phelps. "We usually come from behind and win or come from behind and lose

'Righteous Ray' proved too much for 'the Honeymooner'. 
After the bloodbath of Powers and Gleason, the crowd was treated to the most con­trolled bout of the night be­tween Vance 'Pretty Boy' Be­cklund and Ted 'the Truth' Gradel. Both boxers· had good style and footwork, but south­paw Ted 'the Truth' had a slight advantage. His quick right jabs and strong lefts kept 'Pretty Boy' at bay for the first round. 
In the second, Becklund came out with powerful rights 
keeping Gradel on the defen­
sive. The third round saw both 
boxers using their power to end 
the bout. In the end, 'the Truth' 
came away with a split decision 
to win the Junior Middleweight 
title. 
The final bout of the night was an expected rematch be­tween the 1986 Super Heavyweight champion Dan 'the Man' Quinn and 1985 Super Heavyweight champion Per­nell 'Big Train' Taylor. Taylor, who lost the bout last year, took control in the first round limit­ing the exchanges in order to conserve his strength. In the second round, 'Big Train' began his attack with his pow­erful left jab that found every opening in Quinn's defense.

ACHA results, page 10 
Irish hockey since 1968, an­nounced his resignation from the head coaching job. 
In a meeting with his team following a heart-breaking loss to Michigan-Dearborn, Smith, the coach who often roared, quietly told his players of his decision to retire. 
"After 40 years of coaching, I just decided to turn it in,'' said the venerable coach. "I turned in my resignation about two weeks ago, but didn't tell the team until after the game." 
Wait a minute. Coaching for forty years at the age of fifty­seven? 
"I organized my high school team when I was 17," Smith says. 
Smith came to the Irish after five years of coaching in the Midwest Junior B League, fol­lowed by a ten-year stint as head coach at his native South St. Paul High School. He gained notoriety by compiling a record of 201 wins, 69 losses, 11 ties
