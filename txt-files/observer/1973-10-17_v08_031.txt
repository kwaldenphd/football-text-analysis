Macheca clarifies drug policy 
by Jerry Lutkus t.:ditor-in-Chief. 
Dean of Students John Macheca refused to confirm yesterday The Observer report of three drug raids in campus residence halls saying that "the individual student's right to personal reputation outweighs the student body's right to know the particulars of disciplinary proceedings." 
While stating the policy of his office not to reveal information on cases under disciplinary action, Macheca further claimed that it is "unfortunate that hearsay reports on disciplinary matters most often contain serious inaccuracies." 
"There is no question," he said in explaining the university's position of drugs, "that pushers are not going to be tolerated in this community. This does not exclude the providers or the dealers." 
In a statement that he released to the campus media, Macheca established two guidelines that the university will follow in drug investigations: 
1 ( The privacy of a student's campus residence will only be compromised if there is good reason to believe that there is a violation of university rules or regulations taking place within that room. 
2) Provided there is sufficient advance knowledge of a violation, the Dean of Students will provide the oc­cupant<s) of a room with a written explanation of the reason for the official inquiry as well as any ap­propriate verbal elaboration. Such inquiries will normally be the responsibility of Student Affairs personnel, including the staff of the particular hall." 
Macheca's guidelines were issued in conjunction with an SLC recommendation that the Student Affairs Office "publicize the procedures used in enforcing regulations and clarify the rights of the students involved." Also in line with those recommendations, Macheca did not give any details of individual cases. 
"A general awareness of what's going on with a problem like drugs is good," Macheca said. "It's the awareness constructive for the community." He added that the awareness established through his guidelines would hopefully "decrease the reported paranoia." 
'l'he Dean of Students emphasized his belief that drugs are a "Mutual problem which needs a mutual effort to rid the campus of them." He continued that students who get involved in drug problems can expect 


"There is no question that pushers are not going to 
be tolerated in this commninity," said Machecha 

the worse if it comes to the attention of the university. 
When questioned about the pushers moving off campus, Macheca said that if they attempt to exploit th_e campus student population from off campus, "they w1ll be dealt with." 
"If I am aware of drug dealing that I am not in a position to affect, I will refer it to anyone who can," he said. 
The Dean of Students also clarified the university rules about drugs that have been passed by the Student Life Council. There are three classifications of drug regulations, he explained. 1) Providing for others ia serious violation. 2) Possession or use of any narcotic or hallucinogenic is a serious violatio and 3) The university does not consider the use of marijuana acceptable. 
Macheca warned students not to bring quantities of drugs with them following the semester break. He claimed that all students have been given "fair war­ning" about the consequences of drugs violations. 
The complete statement of Macheca to the campusmedia follows: 

11111111111111111m11111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111 
Student Affairs has begun to implement a new program emphasizing the educational role of our office in the lives of students beyond the classroom. At the heart of this program is our level of awareness of student life. However, we will never use improper means to increase that degree of knowledge. On the other hand, we do welcome and encourage the input of students to sensitiize us to the realities of student life here at Notre Dame. 
Student Affairs has worked over the summer and since the beginning of the year to restate the rules and values of this community as the initial step in the process of identifying them as part of our lives here. As the Dean of Students, the latter becomes one of my larger areas of responsibility, but it is not exclusive to me. On the contrary, it is shared by everyone on the Student Affairs staff, to say nothing of the community in general. 
The individual student's right to personal reputation outweighs the student body's right to know the par­ticulars of disciplinary proceedings. 
The privacy of a student's campus residence will only be compromised if and when there is good reason to believe that there is a violation of University rules or regulations taking place within that room. 
. Proyided there is sufficient advance knowledge of a vwlabon, the Dean of Students will provide the oc­cupant(s) of a room with a written explanation of the reaso~ for the official inquiry as well as any ap­propnate verbal elaboration. Such inquiries will normally be the responsibility of Student Affairs personnel, including the staff of the particular hall.

Representatives of St. Edward's Hall confirmed yesterday that one resident of the hall has been ex­pelled over the drug situation as reported in Tuesday's Observer H~wever, they denied that any raid had taken place m the hall. The presentatives did not elaborate on how the individuals were apprehended.

Kissinger, Tho win 1973 Nobel Peace Prize 
OSLO <UPI>-Henry Kissinger and North Vietnamese chief negotiator Le Due Tho today worn the 1973 Nobel Peace Prize, the Nobel Peace Committee announced. 
Kissinger, the new U.S. Secretary of State, and Le Due Tho negotiated the Vietnam cease-fire during a series of meetings in Paris last year. 
Politicians and Nobel Prize experts said the announcement was the greatest surprise in the history of the award. 
Kissinger and Tho were selected from a list of 40 nominees which included President Nixon, President Tito of Yugoslavia and Brazilian bishop Dom Helder Camara. 
The two winners will share a record of $130,000 cash prize. 
First since 1971 
It was the first Nobel Peace Prize to be awarded since 1971. The Nobel Prize Committee last year named no winner because it said it could not find a suitable candidate. The last previous winner was West German Chancellor Willy Brandt in 1971. 
The Nobel committee siad Kissinger and Tho were nominated by Jon Sannes, professor of history at Oslo University and directory of the Norwegian Foreign Policy Institute. 
Three-year effort 

In explaining the award the committee said, "For more than three years they have used all their strength and good will to achieve a negotiated solution, a peaceful solution of the Vietnam War. 
"Thereby, they have performed a feat which is in the best ac­cordance with Alfred Nobel's thoughts, that conflicts should be tried to be solved through negotiations and not through was." 
Most gruesome war 

The Vietnam War was aescribed as the most gruesome and long conflict the world has experienced after the second World War," the committee added. "It was a gruesome war that did not only force upon the Vietnam civilian population enormous sufferings but that also poisoned the at­mosphere in and between other countries in the whole world." 
In a briefer formal an­nouncement the committee said:''The war in Vietnam was the most gruesome and longest military conflict since the second World War was brought to an end with a cease-fire. The Norwegian Nobel Prize Committee has given the Peace Prize of 1973 to the two negotiators who with a joint achievement brought about the cease-fire January 23 this year. Dr. Henry Kissinger, U.S.A., and Le Due Tho of teh Democratic Republic of Vietnam." 
At the time of the Nobel an­nouncement, Kissinger was in Washington at the White House, meeting with other security ad­visers, presumably on the Middle East conflict. 
Before the award was an­nounced, Nobel Institute Director August Schou named two nominees who would not be considered­Soviet physicst Andri Sakharov, a leading Russian dissident, and the late President Salvador Allende of Chile, overthrown recently in a military coup.

Washington--Vice-President-nominee Gerald R. Ford said Tuesday an allegation in a book about Washington politics that he was the patient of a psychotherapist for a year is "categorical!Y inaccurate." 
Ford responded to reporters questions about a reference in the book "Washington Pay-Off" by Robert N. Winter-Berger that he was a paitent of Dr. Arnold Hutschnecker of New York who columnist Drew Pearson said at one time also treated Richard M. Nixon. Winter­Berger was a self-described Washington lobbyist who claimed in­timate friendship with leading politicians. 
Washington-u.s. District Judge John J. Sirica, saying five Watergate defendants "knowingly, intentionally and voluntarily" pleaded guilty in January, refused Tuesday to release them on bail. 
Sirica, however, did set hearing for Oct. 29 and Nov. 5 on motions by the five to change their pleas to innocent. A defense lawyer indicated he may subpoena former White House aides to testify. 
Yonkers, N.Y.-Drummer Gene Krupa, whose flying sticks sym­bolized the swing era, died Tuesday after a lengthy illness.. He was 64. 
The cause of death was not immediately announced. Krupa had suffered for years from benign leukemia, and he entered a Yonkers hospital last week for treatment of a heart problem connected with the iliSPliSe.

Appeals court to hear IBM case 
Wednesday, October 17, 1973 the observer 

By JERRY R. WILSON 

TULSA, Okla. (UPI) -The IBM-Telex antitrust case will go to a U.S. Court of Appeals without any assignment of damages, a federal judge said Tuesday. 
Citing the evidence presented to him as insufficient, U.S. District Judge A. Sherman Christensen of Salt Lake City said he would certify his previous judgment, finding IBM guilty of antitrust violations and Telex guilty of industrial espionage, for review by the higher court but would leave the question of damages open pending a later determination on his part. 
"I have concluded that the evidence before me is insuffi­cient to justify the recalculation or redetermination of the amount of antitrust damages by specific or approximated sums and accordingly I intend to grant an amendment to the findings of fact, conclusions of law and judgment leaving the amount to be determined at a special hearing or to grant a motion for a new trial on the subject of damages only," Christensen said. 
In a decision handed down Sept. 17, Christensen awarded Telex $352.5 million in treble damages in its antitrust suit against IBM, and awarded $21.9 million to IBM in its industrial espionage counterclaim. 
On Oct. 9, however, Chris­tensen notified both parties that he had made a "substantial error" in making his calcula­tions of the judgment against IBM, later explaining that he had failed to deduct from the IBM judgment certain amounts 

Jackson leads ntayoral election 
By SAM MILLER 

ATLANTA <UPI) -Maynard Jackson, seeking to become the first black mayor of a major southern city, and white incum­bent Sam Massell ran neck-and­neck Tuesday night in early returns from a bitter runoff election for mayor of Atlanta. 
With 70 of the city's 193 precincts reporting, Vice Mayor Jackson, the favorite, had 15 034 votes to Massell's 13,362.

Ruth hits islands 
MANILA <UPI) -Typhoon Ruth, the third major storm to hit the Philippines in a week, swept away a bridge Monday night with 40 persons on it and only four were rescued, the official Philippine News Agency said Tuesday. There was no word on the fate of the others, many of them children. 
The bridge gave way during the height of the typhoon in Nueva Ecija Province, one of the hardest-hit areas, 70 miles north of Manila, the agency said. 
There were at least five other drownings reported due to the powerful typhoon that caused flooding and landslides and forced the evacuation of thou­sands of persons. 
The storms triggered floods from Manila to the "rice bowl" provinces of central Luzon. In metropolitan Manila areas alone, an estimated 15,000 persons fled their homes along the banks of the rain-swollen Pasig River, according to _the Department of Social Welfa1"e. 
Ruth, however, spared the main Manila area and its 4.5 million residents of the full force of its 85 mile-an-hour winds but it whipped up fringe

Learning A Lesson 
Where Are 

Now that the Student Union "crisis" has subsidized and the Board of Com­missioners has decided to turncoat on their original decision to impeach S. U. Director Jim Rybarczyk, it's time to look back at the crisis and suggest methods with which to handle the ticket situation. Also, it is the time to make a suggestion for the return of a popular Union acitivity. 
In 1970 and 1971, football tickets for the Homecoming Game were distributed through a lottery system. All students interested in purchasing tickets got into the lottery and took their chances. 
That system for some reason was scrapped last year, but if the union learns by their mistakes, they will see that the lottery system should be resumed. (Even though this union staff will not be in power next year, they can lay the groundwork and pass on the advice.) 
On two days of the week, the Student Union Ticket Office should be used as the sign up area. All students including Union members should register at the office for the lottery. The registrations would be passed on to a computer which would then do a random selection program and come up with a list of 250 people who can buy a pair of tickets--and all 500 tickets should be sold. That list can then be posted in the Huddle and printed in The Observer. 
The day that the list is printed in the paper until the end of that week, those 250 students can present their I D's at the Ticket Office and purchase their tickets. If at the end of the week, all 250 pairs are not picked up, then the students who have number over 250 can serve as a waiting list and get their opportunity to purchase the tickets. 
This lottery system is the only fair way of handling the tickets. Also, hopefully, the union won't be stuck with the misfortune next year of having to use a game of the magnitude of the SC game as the Homecoming Game. This year there was no choice in the matter, hopefully, next year that won't be the same.

The Over--The-Hill night on Wednesday nights in LaFortune is the activity that should return. Over-the Hill was a project initiated by the Union a few years ago featuring campus folk talent and rock bands in the second floor ballroom of LaFortune ,every Wenesday night. It was always a great way to break up the week and gave an informal gathering spot for students. Further, it created a large showcase for campus talent and brought many people into the student center. 
The return of an activity of this order would be a big plus for the S.U.

The Students? 

Leanne .Jacques 
Last weekend that famed elusive group, known as the SMC Board of Regents met. The revised male visitation policy remained tabled with a 12-12 vote. Why? Mary Ellen Stumpf, student representative, declares the new Board members (12 of them) needed time to get "informed about the entire picture". Why weren't these new mem­bers informed before the meeting? Because they weren't chosen in ample time. Why weren't they chosen within a considerable amount of time by which they could have received information? Doesn't St. Mary's at least owe this much to the students? 
And what do the students owe? They owe it to themselves the op­portunity to get out from under the barrel. I don't believe that the students are apathetic because there seems to be genuine concern over the issue. The problem results from a defeatest attitude. "What can we do?" is the common question. 
First of all the Board of Regents meet during hard times for the students. Right before breaks. During breaks. Exam time. Clearly, taking time for action jeopardizes a student's grades which are im­portant. Yes, sir, exams certainly keep us in line. (Remember the merger?) 
Secondly, any action such as a mass violation of the no-male visitation policy works against rather than for the student body. We would only prove that we ARE "irresponsible" and confirm the idea that we are not mature enough to handle parietals. 
Obviously the Board of Regents do not recognize the change in student life as it is today. They view the halls as wall to wall bedrooms rather than the homes that they are to the people who reside in them. Nothing is immoral about entertaining in your homes. 
It seems ironic that the women at St. Mary's, in the eyes of the nation, are old enough to marry and bear children, but in theeyesof the college are not old enough to run their own lives. Ironic! It's pitiful. 
The objection of violating someone's privacy is totally absurd. Privacy is something that roommates work out among themselves, not something handed down by holy decree. Privacy is not dictated. It is negotiated between the involved parties. 
The social life at St. Mary's lacks a comfortable and natural atmosphere.. COh, those phrases from across the road!) St. Mary's is going to need all the social advantages it can get. The increasing co­education of Notre Dame will make the social situation at St. Mary's a lot tighter. St. Mary's decided for academic independence but still carries a social dependence on Notre Dame. Isn't it time we shared social opportunities rather than lived off them? 
So what CAN we do? Last year a random survey was sent out among the student body to poll opinion on the parietal issue. We need a total view of the student body, a complete poll. This poll could then be sent to each member of the Board of Regents. And then? Try to set up a trial visitation weekend. How? Through governmental processes, which could take a while, but if the pressure was really on, the proposals made up quickly and accurately enough, emergency meetings called for this purpose the time would be greatly shortened. 

And if after we have acted reasonably, maturely and logically and still get no response or even an inane response ..what do we do? (Raise our status. Become equal to parents and alumni. Initiate bake sales and funding campaigns to raise bribe money.) Hold a mass violation of the rules. What have we got to lose then?

Bad Waves 
Dear Editor: 
On Friday morning I woke to the sound of my phone ringing. I fell out of bed to answer it and on the other end of the line was a friend of mine screaming hysterically to turn on the radio and tune in to WSND. It seems that Spiro Agnew, former vice president of our nation, was being publically screwed by the University of Notre Dame. 
I turned on WSND, "the voice of Notre Dame," and could only listen for a minute. It was sad, the radio station representing the University of Notre Dame, acting so juvenile, so bush-league, just because the person running the show, Fred Graver seems to have a personal gripe against the Nixon administration. 
I have read Graver's articles 
printed in the Observer and 
respect him as a journalist, but I 
think it is sad that he took ad­
vantage of his air time on the radio 
to castigate Mr. Agnew. Or maybe 
it wasn't just Graver, maybe it 
was the entire staff of WSND. 
It seems funny to me that a radio 
station as bad as WSND would 
have the nerve to desecrate 
someone else's name when, in 
reality, someone should have the 
nerve to desecrate theirs. 
I only hope that no one other than 
regular listeners of WSND heard 
this show, for it certainly was a 
bad reflection and disgrace for the 
entire University. 
Gina Haffey, a staff member at 
WSND, once told me that those 
letters stood for "We Serve Notre 
Dame." I think, more ap­
propriately, they should stand for 
"We Shame Notre Dame." 
Jane Cannon 

A Strange Peace 
I woke up today (Tuesday) to 
read the most disturbing news in 
a long time. 
While American military sup­
plies were being loaded onto the 
deck of the Aben Det., President 
Nixon was speaking at a Medal of 
Honor ceremony in Washington.
This is what he had to say: ''I 
would conclude by saying that the 
men honored today and the thousands of other Americans who also should be honored, who served
this country in Viet Nam, made it 
possible for the United States to 
play the honored role of 
peacemaker in the world." 
After reading his comment my 
eyes moved to a poster on my wall. ~~~~~~~~""""'!!!!""!"'""""'!!""""'!!!!""!"'""""'!!""""'!!~~~~~~~~~~~~11-01 
I read the quote I have read at least thirtv times already. "Peace cannot be kept by force. it can only be achieved by understanding." <Albert Einstein) 
I must be crazy. Did we bring peace to Viet Nam and the entire Indochina area? I have been living under the impression that the fighting in Southeast Asia con­tinues to this very day. 
What makes our President think we are the "peacemaker of the world"? (If military supplies were drugs we'd be the "junkie of the 
PITT BUS NOON THURSDAY FROM CCE CALL BOB 2127 FOR SEATS 
world." 
The bumper sticker that reads "Impeach with Honor" is becoming less of a joke every day. 
Pardon my haphazar<j.ness. I am confused.

Tips On Journalism 
To the editor: 
Regarding the controversy of the refusal of the stadium to allow the couple to enter with their 5 month old baby and the corresponding University policy, the Observer and therefore the manipulated student opmwn has been somewhat quick in responding with their proclivity of condemning the adminstration. I am not defending the university's policy in the case, merely expressing criticism of its thoughtless con­demnation. The point has been repeatedly made that the motivator for this policy is dollar oriented. Not since 1964 has Notre Dame failed to fill its stadium and it becomes increasingly less likely each year that we will have any sub-capacity crowds. Anyone capably of the least logical thinking would realize that by insisting even infants have tickets for admissions, not more tickets will be sold. Therefore there will be no moe gate receipts. Obviously then, the motives behind this policy are not to get their grubby hands on an additional $8 from a child who will not even remember the game as was implied and boldly stated by the Observer. Perhaps a good reason would be the in­convenience to paying customers of being squeezed off the bench by a family who would abuse such a privilege and perhaps there is no good reason. However anyone with journalsitic responsibility must recall that speculative 
reporting and hasty conclusions will frequently lead to erroneous judgement. 
Respectfully, Joe Fegoosk

Students ur1aware of activities 
by Judy Rauenhorst Staff Reporter 
Many students are unaware of off-campus activities and job programs offered to minority students through Student Ac­tivities. Cassell Lawson, director of off-campus student activities and minority student affairs, is the man behind these two programs. 
As director of off-campus student activities, Lawson coor­dinates volunteer functions with the South Bend Community. He said that 1200 students spend time outside the University in volunteer roles. One program involves students who work with the Urban League Street Academy. "These students spend time with dropouts in a tutorial capactity or as teacher's aids," explained Lawson. 
The second aspect of Lawson's job, that of working with minority students, involves coordinating black organizations on campus. 
"I see our role as a service type role and a training type role," said Lawson. In explaining the service role, ·Lawson sa1d It main.ly ·m­volves counseling minority students that may not seek it elsewhere. "The emphasis is to help students to get a direction and to better understand the structure they are caught up in," he stated. 
"This counseling addresses itself to all aspects of student life: social events, financial aid, boy-girl relations, admissions, anything that is not within the academic realm. All academic questions go to Dr. Joseph Scott of the Black 
Studies Program," continued Lawson. 
The director of minority student affairs is responsible for two facilities in LaFortune. "The Black Cultural Arts Center on the third floor allows students to have a place they can go, external to the classroom. It is an extension of the classroom complete with artifacts 
and literature, enabling the in­
dividual to become intellectually 
involved," explained Lawson. 
He emphasized that the center is 
open to all students to become 
aware of the Black situation and to 
socialize. "Every Wednesday 
evening we have a fiim in the 
center in conjunction with the 
Black Studies Program," said 
Lawson. 

In describing the training role, Lawson told of the seven students he works with. Undergraduates Lionel Phillips, Greg Crawford and Richard Dickinson keep the Black Cultural Arts Center open. Albert Mendez and Billy Banner man the Mnority Counseling Center located in the basement of LaFortune. Two graduate students, Sharon Browner and Craig Adams, act as a liason between the two centers. 
"These people are in interims of training. Each week we meet and discuss skills tht help them to work efficiently," said Lawson. "When notified of a student that needs help, we move out into the 
Professors receive awards 
by Ken Bradford Staff Reporter 
Three Notre Dame economiCs professors have received the Kazanjian Foundation Award for their achievement in economic education. 
The winning program was developed two years ago by Professors William Davisson, Frank Bonello, and Kenneth Jameson, along with Frank Navratile, a graduate student here last year. 
The Kazanjian Award is presented by the Joint Council of Economic Education for im­provements made in the teaching of economics. 
In addition to winning its recipients a $1000 cash prize, the award, according to Jameson, "helps establish Notre Dame as 
··"· 
one of the main economic teaching centers in the country." 
Jameson described the change in approach by saying that in many classes "concepts are thrown at students; they memorize them, take an exam, and forget them." 
The innovative program in­volves "teaching students the skills which economists really use," Jameson expl'i.ined. Students are introduced to com­puter programming and statistical testing techniques. 
The Economics 101-102 course taught by Professors Davisson, Bonello and Jameson is offered to forty freshmen and consists of two lectures and one lab every week. 
In the lectures, students are taught the basic concepts and the philosophy of economics. In the lab sessions, they concentrate on 
economic problems.

A key force in their winning the award was the success students taking the course displayed through the quality of their work, Jameson said. 
Jameson also said that the program received valuable sup­port from Dr. Dennis Duggan, Chairman of the Economics University environment and knock on doors.

One of the activities this semester was a black student convention held September 15. "I saw students sit down and take a hard look at the issues in the community," said Lawson. As a result of the conference they hope to implement academic houses where 'improved' students could live to reinforce their behavior and eliminate anxiety. 
La~son emphasized that the programs set up are nothing new. "We want to coordinate counseling functions with the University for students who might come to LaFortune while feeling reluctant to go to the Administration Building," said Lawson. 
"I feel very warm and positive about what has happened to minority students and I am happy in my role. I think things will continue to improve in working with the students toward their goals," claimed Lawson. His main objective is to help students achieve academic excellence and allowing them to make ad­justments to a new environment. "We have a lot to do, but I am comfortable in the progress we have made," concluded Lawson. 
Prior to coming to Notre Dame in 1970, Lawson was director of the Urban League in South Bend for three years. He is presently working toward his doctorate in Counseling Psychology.

Committee probes dark spots 
by Jeanne Murphy Staff Reporter 
Have you recently seen a group of girls walking around campus at night with a flash light in one hand and a map in the other? They were part of a Lighting Committee organized by Sister John Miriam Jones to find the darkest spots on campus. 
Sr. John Miriam, assistant to the provost, has been concerned for some time about the inadequate lighting facilities on campus. She attributes the major problem of the "unevenness" of lights to the fact that "lighting has not kept pace with the expansion of the campus." 
She organized a committee of ten women students who made nightly tours of the campus and indicated on a map, dark areas which needed lighting. The girls on the com­mittee were: Diana Merten and Kathy Johnson from Breen­Philips; Ann Weber and Evelyn

A's net Mets in 11th, 3-2 
NEW YORK <UPI) Bert Cam­paneris singled home an unearned run in the 11th inning Tuesday night to give the Oakland A's a 3-2 victory over the New York Mets in the third straight World Series gamE> decided by defensive .lapses. 
The victory gave the A's a 2-1 lead in this wild Series which hasn't been notable for much good play but has had plenty of ex­citement. 
New York staked Tom Seaver, its best pitcher, to a 2-0 lead, but he wasn't able to hold it when Joe Rudi punched a single just under first baseman John Milner's glove in the eighth inning to score Campaneris with the tying run. 
Errors by Felix Millan, the goat of the Mets' first-game defeat, gave the A's scoring chances in both the 9th and lOth innings but each time Tug McGraw pitched out of danger. But in the 11th, a strikeout-passed ball play, reminiscent of catcher Mickey Owens' famous gaffe which cost Mongovran from Badin; Maureen Lathers and Barbara Budde from Farley; Ginna Smith and Sue Darin from Walsh; and from Lewis Hall, Sr. Theresa Sandok and Sr. Arlene Lenox.

Stepan Center will be decorated extensively to create the at­mosphere of a barn. A horse and wagon will also be available for those who would like to have their picture taken at the dance. 
A theme was chosen for this year's Homecoming Dance due to the success of the '72 dance which used the theme of Prohibition. "About 500 couples attended last year's dance and I think everyone really had a great time," Guiltinan added. 
Tickets for the dance, on sale at the Student Union Ticket Office LaFortune Center and in the Dining halls during meal hours, are $6 per couple.

but rather, maintaining a "soft light effect." 
A private lighting company has been sought to conduct their own survey on the campus light situation. After this company has completed their investigation, all the data from the committee and company will be com piled to see where new lights should be added. 
Eighteen lights were previously ordered before the committee went on their search, but Sr. John Miriam feels that more lampposts will be needed to sufficiently cover the dark areas on campus. 
Ken McCandless, a member of the Campus Committee for En­vironment, feels that the com­mittee is "good in the sense that it lists places, it is good input and needed." He has submitted several proposals which would change the lighting situation on campus, but none of his suggestions have been im­plemented. He claims that the committee's work should not be the only input into any decision, but the men on campus should also have some input and voice. Lights accomodate both sexes, he said. Therefore, the girl's committee should not be the only voice on the situation.

An exceptionally fast-moving and brilliant "star" caught the attention of three Breen-Phillips residents yesterday evening. Appearing directly overhead, the object travelled in a straight line and then curved, making a rather circular motion while shifting its light intensity. These girls weren't the only ones who spotted a strange object in the sky at 6:40 p.m. yesterday evening. 
Eight other calls reported sightings of UFO's wer made to the Indiana State Post at Ligonier. The reports were received from residents in Noble, La Grange, Steuben and De Kalb Counties.

Party vehicle 
runs today 
by Terry Keeney Staff Reporter 
The "Party Bus" is on the road again. The r.on-e>.press shuttle bus between Notre Dame and St. Mary's will be transformed into a party bus between noon and 5 p.m. today. 
Along with the usual party decor and refreshments of soda pop and potato chips, Juan Manigault, special projects commissioner for the Social Commission , has pror..sed live entertainment. Riders can listen to live guitar music or play "Pin Woodstock on Snoopy" --the "Peanuts" version of pin-the-tail-on-the-donkey. 
"Your friendly host and hostess for the ride will be Tom Callahan and Debbie Sansoni," said Manigault. 
Manigault believes that the shuttle bus is a good vehicle for meeting people. Yet too often the riders make no effort to mingle with others. He hopes the "party bus" can stimulate more in­teraction. 
"The purpose of the party bus is to create a feeling of warmth on the bus with a party atmosphere," explained Manigault. "This way people lose their inhibitions and see others as people, instead of as statues."

Goshen Police Department stood outside their station last night to observe a "stationary, bright light, that had been moving." This l:ight appeared to be directly above Goshen College. 
Another South Bend student spotted "seven real bright dots in the sky. They were in a v­formation and were going like a streak of lightening but we got a good look at them." Both students of Central Night School, called the police department at ap­proxinlately 7:30 p.n1. 
Typical of other reports calied in

police officer received a report 
from a resident of Culver who

tint to the east of Culver. The

observed it for at least 20 minutes 
prior to calling. 
Again, the light intensity of the 
object alternately dimmed and 
brightened. Upon contacting the Culver police department over this incident, a South Bend state trooper received no positive verification. Of all UFO reports gathered, this Culver sighting was the only one that res:eived no verrfication. 

Pablo Casals dead at 96 
San Juan, P.R., UPI -Cellist Pablo Casals, 96, one of the cen­tury's greatest string players, was in critical condition today with a heart attack and lung com­plications. His wife, Marta, 36, was at his hospital bedside. 
Casals was struck by a heart attack Sept. 30 as he played dominos at the home of a friend. 
Casals was born in the Catalonian town of Vendrell, near Barcelona, Spain, Dec. 29, 1876. He began playing violin and piano and composing at age 5.-_ 
In 1957 he initiated the Casals

Tom Clements--consistently cool 
by John Fineran 
Notre Dame's offense has drawn much criticism this fall for its inability to score consistently. Many times this young season, the Irish have failed to score because of many key breakdowns and turnovers. 
Other football teams would have lost their first four games by making similar mistakes. One of the reasons Notre Dame has won their first four is Tom Clements, the 6-0, 185 lb. junior quarterback from McKee's Rock, Pa. 
Clements is quite aware of the criticism, but he has a sufficient answer for it. "People fail to realize that we are a young team on offense," he says. "Frank Pomarico, Gerry DiNardo and Dave Casper were our only players experienced before the season on the line. 
"It took a while for the new people to coordinate with them. They are just coming around right now after those two tough wins against Purdue and Michigan State." 
Still, Clements thinks the youth has helped the Irish. "I think everyone tries to do his best. We all try to help one another. We're enthusiastic for each other." 
And the Irish and their fans are enthusiastic about Clements. Noted for his running ability, Clements is also a dnagerous roll­out passer. Northwestern coach Johnny Pont can attest to this point. 
Playing only the first half against the Wildcats, Clements threw for 152 yards on nine of 12 completions, including one for a touchdown. "Clements really hurt us with those passes in the flat," a dejected Pont said after Notre Dame's 44-0 opening victory. 
Clements is also noted for his accuracy throwing to his left. The most difficult pass to throw for any right-handed quarterback is the one to his left. It is the most dif­ficult, that is, for all quarterbacks except Clements. 
"When you are rolling out, you have to remember to square your shoulders," he says. "It is a lot easier to the right side." 
In the Michigan State game, Clements was a big factor in the Notre Dame 14-0 lead at halftime. Spartan coach Dennis Stolz realized this. 
"The defensive adjustments we made at halftime were to use our linebackersmore," he said. "We had to get a pass rush on Clements." 
We could not contain him. He
