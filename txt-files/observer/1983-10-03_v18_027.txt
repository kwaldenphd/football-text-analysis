Roemer reaffirms ban on parties in K._ights of Columbus building 
By TOM MOWLE and JOHN 

NEBLO 
News Staff 
The Knights ofColumbus may not rent out its party space to campus organizations, Dean of Students James Roemer stated in a letter to Joe Anthony, grand knight of the Knights ofColumbus. 
The letter reaffirmed a policy es­tablished last year banning the serv­ing of alcohol in the Knights of Columbus building. K. ofC. officials said their policy, for insurance reasons, is not to rent the building to anyone. 
Anthony said "if anyone wants to use the building, they can join the K. of C." Their insurance only covers members ofthe Knights. 
Roemer's letter was written in 
response to a Student Senate resolu­

tion proposing that the K. of C. be . 
allowed to rent its party space to 
dorms and campus groups and or· 
ganizations, subject to certain 
guidelines. The resolution was 
needed, says its author, Senator 
Dave McAvoy, because several 
south quad dorms lack adequate 
party space. 
Anthony said he gave tacit ap­proval to the senate resolution on the day it was presented and agreed to "discuss the matter with Dean Roemer." Now, however, "He has 
written this letter taking the backbone out of the Student Senate resolution and threatening to take the building away from us." 
Roemer said his principle objec­
tion to using the building is the lack of supervision that has been a problem there for many years. He reminded students that "no one in the State of Indiana under 2 I may legally drink." The University nevertheless permits underage drinking, he said, because he feels "it is better to have it supervised on· campus, than to have unsupervised 
drinking off·campus." 
McAvoy noted that the senate's 
resolution specified several controls 
on the use of the K. of C. building, 
which he felt should make its use ac· 
ceptable to the administration. 
These controls included having "a 
member of the head staff, a faculty 
advisor, or the K. of C. chaplain" su­pervise all parties. Roemer doubted that adequate supervision could be provided. 
Other restraints included observ· ing parietals and HPC party guidelines, having ID checks to limit admittance to Notre Dame or Saint Mary's students, and providing ad­vance notification to the dean ofstu­dents. 
McAvoy believes that members of 
the administration should be 
receptive to his proposal, especially 
if it is backed by the Campus Ufe 
Council, because "some adrninis­
tators feel the structure could be put 
to better use." He said Father John 
Van Wolvlear, vice president for stu­
dent affairs, would have the fmal say 
on the resolution. 
Anthony's reference to threats 
stems from a statement near the end 
ofRoemer's letter: "May I respectful­ly request the students in the Knights of Columbus to advise if they would be now willing to move from the building so that the Univer­
sity could develop this beautiful location into a non-alcohol center for all undergraduates." 
Student Body President Brian Cal­laghan said he doubts it would hap­pen because it would be difficult for the administration to remove the Knights from the campus. He added 
that the K. of C. "is not a very active group, and there are plenty of groups that could use the building better." 
Anthony disputes this claim, 
saying "we have the most members 
of any volunteer organization on 
campus ( 300-400 students), and we 
are also the richest." He cited 
several organizations that the K. of 
C. donates to, including Corvella House and a home for delinquent boys. Anthony commented, "If Roemer feels these activities are a waste, then I have to question where 
his priorities lie." 
The grand knight agrees that it may be difficult to remove the or­ganization from the site, because it has a 50-year lease on the building. While it is a university-owned build­ing, the K. ofC. pay for all insurance and maintenance. 
They also paid for the S250,000 renovations to the building when it was converted from a post office, and contributed S500,000 to a scholarship fund for minorities.

In Brief 
Nicaragua's two rebel movements have in­
tensified the scope and frequency of attacks on army positions, carrying out air raids on the capital's airport and heavy assaults on border posts. The attacks caused more headlines than heavy damage but reflect a drive for rebel credibility and a shift from sporadic harassment ofNicaraguan troops to highly visible raids on important economic targets. Until recently, most of the fighting against Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government has been claimed by the Honduras-based Nicaraguan Democratic Force, a rightist-led move­ment that gets U.S. help. It may have as many as 10,000 troops in or near Nicaragua. But the Costa Rica-based Revolutionary Democratic Alliance, led by disenchanted former Sandinista leader Eden Pastora, did much of the fighting in September, overshadowing the Honduran-bascd rebels for the first time. "We are a belligerent force, one the world now has to recognize and one the communist dic­tatorship now has to deal with," Pastora said recently at his jungle base inside Nicaragua. Pastora claims to have 3,700 armed troops in Nicaragua and says he could field thousands more if he could arm 
them. -AP 
A bomb exploded near the American and Algerian exposition stands at a trade fair ill Marseille, France Friday, killing one person and wounding 27 others, police said. Responsibility for the attack was claimed by a suspected Armenian terrorist organiza­tion, the Orly Group, in a telephone call to police. None of the casualties was identified, but officials said no Americans were believed among them. Police did not say who the terrorists were aiming at, and fire officials said the Swiss and Soviet exposition stands also were in the general area of the explosion. The Orly Group is believed to be a splinter group of the Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia, which usually attacks Turkish officials or Turkish government and commercial targets. The Ar· menian t:xtremists say they are avenging the massacre of I. 5 million Armenians in Turkey in the early part ofthe century. -TheObserver 
An estinlated 8,000 people marched to the 
Soviet Embassy on Sunday to commemorate what organizers said 
was the "man-made" famine that killed seven million people in the 
Ukraine region of the Soviet Union 50 years ago. The crowd, which 
walked from the Washington Monument, heard one Soviet emigre, 
Andrij Bilyk, say that people may "finally understand the extent of 
Soviet evil" in light ofthe recent downing ofa Korean airliner by the 
Soviets. "The Russians killed their own people, and now they are 
killing Americans," said another emigre, Valentyn Moroz, referring 
to Korean Air Lines Flight 007, which was downed by the Soviets on 
Sept. 1 with 269 people aboard, including 61 Americans. "This 
march is in memory ofthe Americans as well as the Ukr;IiQiaqs,"§aid Moroz. Thc National Committee to Commemorate Genocide Vic­tims in Ukraine 19 32-33 sponsored the march as part ofa week-long series of events in remembrance of what they call the "forgotten holocaust." Most people in the gathering were ofUkrainian descent. Many wt·re elderly emigres from the Soviet Union, and some said they were survivors of the Ukrainian famine. "We have come here from more than c;o cities ...to remind the world that 50 years ago you (the Soviets) murdered seven million Ukrainians by purposely starving tht·m to death," said Orest Deychakiwsky, 27, at the gather­

Where's the tw-elfth person? 

Consistency. That seems to be what the Fighting Irish 
are lacking. But it is not the on-field consistency that 
worries me. It's the inconsistency in the stands and in 
front ofthe television sets. It's the Notre Dame tradition 
of the sixth person on the court, the twelfth person on 
the field, that needs some refurbishing. 
Nationally, we Domers are known to be some of the proudest and most supportive fans, of our school, our teams, and what they both represent. Having the home field advantage has always meant an even bigger obstacle for Irish opponents. I just hope that in recent weeks we haven't become an obstacle for ourselves. 
In West Lafayette, on Sept. 10, a glance in the direc­tion of the Purdue student section signified that the Boilermakers didn't have a chance. Here it was, their first home game ofthe season, July weather, and almost half of the seats had been vacated early in the second half. Our fans, on the other hand, were all over the place. 
Then came our home 
opener. Gerry and the team 
stormed out of the locker 
room and into the Spartans' 
endzone on their first drive. 
Whispers in the stands of a 
national chamvionship 
echoed louder than the 
And then they stumbled. A \ 
few turnovers, a sack or two, 
irregular playing and sud­
denly Michigan State was 
ahead, and stayed there. 
What impressed me more than either the Spartans' or the Irish's playing was the 
cheering and clapping and almost unwavering support for the unsteady Blair Kiel, the slippery-handed offense and the too penetrable defense. There were minutes when portions of the student section sat down. That was alarming, but everyone was on his or her feet 
before long and they stayed there through·to the Hail 
Mary pass which concluded the game. 
But the whispers ofchampionship died and the status of Gerry Faust's contract was questioned. The com­petence ofKiel was debated, too. 
And then the dome fell in: Miami ...national 
television ...20-0. The memory is nightmarish, for 
those that watched the game through to its ugly end, 
anyway. The next week on campus it was as if the Gold­
en Dome really had caved in. Observing the general at­
titude among the student body and in print, I'm 
surprised lynch mobs weren't formed. Talk of a new 
coach, a new quarterback, and another year resounded. 
With rumors ofa new starting quarterback (Was Kiel the sacrificial lamb?), the Irish flew off to Colorado to try and regain a little respect among the students. Steve

Beuerlein appeared calm, poised and for the most part, smo'Jth. His offensive line was a wall. The running backs literally ran the show and the defense held when it had to. They really "kicked some ..." as the South Bend Tribune reported. 
But still people studied or slept or flipped the chan­nel. Where is that twelfth person? Fan support seems to be as incongruous as the Irish's season to date. Is win­ning the only incentive for student support? 
When NO students sit during a home game, study during an away game, unfurl "Oust Faust" banners, and grumble for a whole week I wonder what does motivate them. 
The national champion­ship is a definite goal ofcol­lege football, and the winning tradition at Notre Dame does inspire a great deal ofour endowmenl, and it is easier to jump and scream at a 52-6 victory. But these are not the only reasons for college football. Especially here, they should not be. College football players are on the field at least partially because of pride in their university. Fans should be there for the 

same reason. 
It may sound high and mighty but collegiate athletics are designed to strengthen character and bodies, provide entertainment for participants and spectaors alike and encourage healthy competition. 
The way that NO supports and thrives on its football team is fantastic, but perspective has got to be retained and the cheering must be for the team, not the win. Usually we stay right behind our teams to the end, whether bitter or sweet. But this season we've got to work to keep that twelfth person off the bench.

Storms batter nation; nine dead in Arizona 

Associated Press 
TUCSON, Ariz. -Floodwaters up to eight feet deep surged yesterday through hundreds of homes in southern Arizona, closing highways and bridges, forcing thousands to 
evacuate and leaving nine people dead or missing. 
In other areas of the country, record-breaking storms pounded the California coast with rain Friday, dousing power to more than 27,000 customers and snarling traffic, but Tropical Storm Dean sputtered 
ashore in Virginia and broke apan 
without causing major damage. 
· In the Pacific, meanwhile, Tropi­
cal Storm Narda moved away from 
the Hawaiian Islands after forcing 
the evacuation of nine families in a 
low-lying area 
Among the victims in the series of 
Arizona desen storms which began 
last week, were two helicopter 
crewmen killed In a crash during a 
rescue mission yesterday for a mot­
her and baby. 
More rain pelted the state yester­
day, the day after helicopters 
plucked stranded residents from 
rooftops in Tucson and the hard-hit 
mining town ofClifton. 
Gov. Bruce Babbitt, who has 
declared a statewide emergency, 
flew over southern Arizona yester­
day to survey the swirlingwaters. He 
said the devastation was "incredible 
. . . the worst damage I've ever 
seen." 
Damage to roads and highways 
alone was estimated at S10 million 
to S12 million in the Tucson area, 
said Pima County Emergency 
Services Director Richard Casanova 
In Marana, a community ofabout 
3,500 residents some 30 miles 
.I I 
nonhwest of Tucson, about 200 people lined Interstate 10 awaiting emergency shuttle transpon after being driven from their homes by the flooded Santa Cruz River. 
Babbitt estimated that at least 1,000 houses were under water at Marana 
"The Yaqui Indian village ofadobe homes in Marana was literally dis­solved by rains and flooding," Bab­bitt said. 
On the Atlantic Coast, Dean's 60 mph winds ate away at beaches in Nonh Carolina as the storm moved up the coast on Thursday. But the winds quickly dwindled Friday as the storm crossed Virginia's Eastern Shore and pushed up Chesapeake 
Bay. 

Gale warnings were discontinued along the East Coast from Nonh Carolina to Rhode Island. 
Winds whipped a fire in Ocean 
View, Va.; a few families evacuated 
low-lying Willoughby Spit, near Nor­
folk, overnight; and waves compli­
cated the rescue of two fishermen 
whose 24-foot boat was snagged in 
its own net. The two were not 
injured. 
Although forecasters said erosion would be the major damage caused by the storm, even that was minimal. 
"I looked out the window this morning to see if any ofour hill was gone," said Betty Mason, who lives on a low rise above Willoughby Spit. "It's not." 
The storm caused less damage to 
the Virginia Beach reson strip than a 
fall nonheaster usually does, said Ar­
thur Gilben, assistant superinten­
dent of the city's erosion 
commission.

Eleven students, operating as a class, will have the opponunity this semester to take pan in the publica­tion ofa literary work at theJuniper Press, a student owned and operated publishing company. 
The class, entering its eighth year, is the brainchild of Professor Elizabeth Christman, who was a literary agent in New York for more than 20 years. No other class of its kind is offered at any college or uni­versity in the country. 
The students are graded as employees in a company, yet exams are still given on the many facets of publishing. Christman says interest in the class has diminished in the last few years, possibly as a result of the novelty ofthis class wearing off. 
Each member of the class is as­signed various duties involved in the publication process. The students must form a contract with the author of the work chosen for publication, acquiring the publish­ing rights for one year. 

An initial investment by the stu­dents is needed to offset publication costs, wliiich run over 52,000. Juniper Press does not set out to make a profit; rather, it functions primarily as an educational en­deavor, exposing the students to all aspects ofpublishing. 
The class reviewed between eight to ten manuscripts this year. A two­act play by graduate student Micheal Varga, entitled "Payable Upon Return," was chosen for publication_ 
The autho.r will receive royalties on the book, and the students hope to recover their initial investments af­ter publication costs. "It's like investing in stock," said Ann Bar­tling, editor-in chiefofthe press. 
Althoug~ all types of manuscripts 
are submiltted, many are aimed at the 
Notre Dame/Saint Mary's com­
munity. 
"We want to choose something 
that we feel has literary quality," says 
Bartling. Nov. 9 is the tentative 
publication date, and the book 
should be available by the end of

East Race may bring kayaking 
By KEirn E. HARRISON 
News Staff 
International kayak racing may soon be coming to South Bend, says James Seitz, superintendent ofparks. 
The East Race Way development, according to Seitz, will be one offive Olympic-quality whitewater spons runs in the country. The run will be 1900 feet in length, and will feature a concrete bottom and man-made fiberglass boulders. It will also have a controlled water output, with a maximum of 1300 cubic feet of 
water per second. 
The East Race Way will start atJef­

ferson Street and run along the east 
bank of the St. Joseph river to near 
Madison Street. A century ago this 
was a canal which was used to 
power South Bend factories, but 
when the factories closed, the canal 
was filled in and forgotten. 
The construction of the East Race 

Way has cost $4.5 million, and has 
been financed by a S3.5 million park 
bond issue and a federal land grant. 
"We hope that the race will spur 

economic growth in the East Bank 
area ofSouth Bend," Seitz said. 
The East Race Way is scheduled to 

open June 30, 1984. It is not known 
yet ifthe facility will be open for the 
use of the public.

Druse council to govern province 
Associated Press 
BEIRUT, Lebanon -Druse leader Walid Jumblatt set up a council to administer Chouf province, and an adviser to President Amin Gemayel yesterday accused Jumblatt's Syrian 
backers of plotting to split Lebanon into separate states. 
Christian militiamen, meanwhile, freed about 200 Druse women and children after several weeks' cap­tivity. 
Jumblatt on Saturday announced he was forming an eight-man "civil administration committee" to run the day-to-day affairs of Chouf province "in the emergency cir­cumstances ...until the return of central government institutions." 
He told reporters in his Chouf 
mountain home at Mouktara that the 
committee would later act as a

Lebanon may still be election issue 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON-The 18-month authority voted by Congress for the Marines to remain in Lebanon was intended, in part, to keep the issue out of the 1984 election campaign, but it isn't likely to work out that way. 
Even though Senate Minority Leader Robert C. Byrd said his Democratic troops raised no par­tisan arguments against the deal with President Reagan, a persistent undercurrent ofpolitics ran through the f~mr days of congressional debate. 
The resolution moved ·through Congress to final approval on Thursday with unusual speed be­cause of the fast track required by law for action under the War Powers Act of1973. 

Reagan said he would sign it, but with reservations. This announce­ment already has drawn criticism, which could intensify when he ex­plains his reservations. 
Even with Reagan's signature, the measure may not be Congress' last word on the ~ ,600 Marines who have stationed in Beirut for more than one year as part of an interna­tional peacekeeping force. 
At any time during the next 18 months, Congress can take up anoth­er resolution to bring the troops home sooner, and the measure ministrative affairs. 
Farouk)aber, a political adviser to Gemayel, told reporters after emer­gency government meetings yester­day that Syria was using)umblatt to partition Lebanon into cantons, or separate states. 
"I believe there is an attempt to partition Lebanon on a canton basis," Jaber said. "The orction taken by Mr. Jumblatt falls in the long-term strategy ofthe Syrian government to extend its hegemony over parts of Lebanon." 
Gemayel met with Prime Minister Shafik Wazzan ancl former President Camille Chamoun, and Chamoun told reporters afterward that he too thought Jumblatt meant to divide Lebanon on the basis of"federal can­tons." 
"The most urgent question is 
whether this applies to the Chouf

he said.

means that if he opposed it, both houses would have to muster a two­thirds majority to override his veto. This would be a far greater margin than his opponents managed in either chamber this week. 
The vote followed party lines with only slight deviation. Only two of 45 Democrats broke party ranks in the Senate to join 52 Republicans in sup­port of the agreement struck by Reagan, Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. and Republican leaders of both

What should we do with ,Watt? 
The Reagan Administration. has ex­perienced its share of turbuk nt incidents involving Cabinet members. Tl'.ere was the great Allen-Haig feud in 1981, only to be followed by the Haig-Ciark sequel of 1982. 
Robert Lloyd Snyder Then midweek 
David Stockman somehow retained his job at the O.M.B. following William Grieder'sAtlan­tic Monthly article which underminded the credibility of the President's pol:cies. William Casey's financial dealings since his appoint­ment as the CIA director have caused a stir in Washington. Secretary of Labm Raymond Donovan was also the target ofpublic scrutiny in 1982 after allegations linked him with or­ganized crime. The Environmemal Protection Agency has also been under attack until the appointment of William Ruckelhaus in 1982. ChiefofStaffJames Baker may yet lose his job when the results ofthe F.B.I. "Debategate" in­quiry are revealed. 
However, Secretary of the Interior James Watt has been the most controversial and politically damaging Cabinet member. His recent comments concerning the composi­tion of an Interior Department committee is anotherfaux pas in a long list of memorable blunders. The Secretary's "misspeaks" have enraged environmentalists for years -but this time Watt has alienated a much wider audience, some of whom will be critical to Reagan's reelection hopes. 
Why has Reagan kept such a liability? The primary reason is money. Watt is easily the President's largest fundraiser, outearning the next largest by nearly a two-to-one margin; this is clearly an asset the President would like to draw upon until after the 1984 elections. Watt's situation in the current administration is like keeping a prize show dog that repeated­ly bites your friends; so long as the dog con­tinues to rake in the prizes, you can endure the animal's misbehavior a little bit longer. 

Watt realizes that he is an easy target for Administration foes. His face is plastered on dartboards throughout the homes ofenviron­mentalists in the U.S. due to his pro-business leanings. Watt's "wide, arrogant, leering smile" and his somewhat plastic appearance under bright television lights also make him an easy target. A proud and dominating man, Watt is a self-professed "born-again Christian" who in the past has asserted his beliiefthat op­ponents of his much-maligned policies are 
'godless and un-American." 
Yet, until now, Watt has survived all result­ing challenges and has kept the respect and confidence ofthe President. He has thorough­ly effected programs and policy in the Interior Department consistent with the President's avowed "pro-business" philosophy. Although Watt's proposals to sell off huge amounts of Federal lands have been defeated, he has opened huge off~shore tracts for oil and gas exploration over the loud protests ofenviron­mentalist groups and concerned citizens. Despite long-standing suspicion by the liberal media that the Interior Department has given "sweetheart deals" to energy and land development companies, governmental scrutiny has been initiated only recently; one ofthese committees is composed ofa black, a Jew, two women and a "cripple." 
Before this latest incident, Watt's behavior was highly questionable; with this latest derogatory statement, his behavior has become embarrassing to both the President and the nation. Reagan should drop Watt for political reasons and because of historic precedent. President Ford dealt with Secretary ofAgriculture Earl Butz in 1978 for a racial joke told to the press. In 1981, the American public began to question the ap­propiateness ofJames Watt as caretaker ofour national resources. Now, in 1983, we can only hope that Reagan will consider the ap­propriateness ofJim Watt as a public servant for all Americans.

1983 season ends for all but four 
Associated Press 
The twoAmerican League playoff-bound teams -Baltimore and Chicago -won yesterday on the last day of the season, while the Na­tional League plaroff teams Philadelphia and Los Angeles ­both lost. 

The Orioles finished with a 2-0 
victory over the New York Yankees, 
winding up six games ahead of 
Detroit in the AL East. The White 
Sox beat Seattle 3-0 to finish a 
league-record 20 games ahead of 
Kansas City in the West. 

Philadelphia lost 4-0 to Pittsburgh but finished six games ahead of the Pirates in the NL East. In the West, the Dodgers were beaten 4-3 by San Francisco but wound up three games ahead ofAtlanta. 
Mike Boddicker, Sammy Stewart, and Tippy Martinez combined on a one-hitter to beat the Yankees. Eddie Murray hit a two-run homer, a career-high 33rd, for the Orioles. The triumph was only the second in the last seven games for the Orioles since they clinched the division. 

Richard Dotson, one of two 20­
game winners for the White Sox, and 
four relievers combined on a three­
hitter to beat Seattle. The White Sox 
finished with a major league-leading 
99 victories. Their fmish was the 
most lopsided in the league since 
the Yankees outdistanced Detroit by 
19-and-a-halfgames in 1936. 

Dotson, 22-7, worked the first 5 
2-3 innings and allowed all the hits 
with two walks and five strikeouts. 
Dennis Lamp worked the ninth in­
ning for his 15th save. 

Lee Tunnell pitched a five-hitter as Pittsburgh ended Philadelphia's season with a loss. Tunnell struck out five and walked one. Jason Thompson homered for the Pirates in the fourth to make it 3-0. The 
loser was rookie Charlie Hudson, 8­8, who is scheduled to pitch in the third game ofthe NL playoffs. 

Jim Barr pitched four innings of scoreless relief to help the Giants over LA. The Dodgers led 2-0 after the first inning, but San Francisco got one back in the second, then took the lead with two runs in the fourth on RBI hits by Dan Gladden and Brad Wellman. 
In other AL games,Jim Rice nailed down the league home run cham­pionship witth a three-run shot giving him 39, and also tied Cecil 
Cooper of Milwaukee for the RBI title with 126. Rice's homer gave the Red Sox a 3-1 victory over Cleveland in 44-year-old Carl Yastrzemski's last game as a player. Wade Boggs ofBos­ton also finished the season with a .361 batting average to win that in­dividual honor. 

Yastrzemski, who is retiring. played in his 3,308th major league game, a record, starting in right field. He left in the eighth inning, having gone 1-for-3, to the cheers of33,497 at Fenway Park. 
Cooper homered over the roof in right field at Tiger Stadium, and Rick Manning drove in two runs with a triple that powered the Milwaukee Brewers over Detroit 7-4. Cooper had two RBI to reach the 126 mark. 
At Toronto, Kent Hrbek paced 
Minnesota's 13-hlt attack with three 
hits, including a two-run homer, to 
lead the Twins to a 9-3 victory over 
the BlueJays. 
Rookie right-hander Steve Brown tossed a six-hitter and right fielder Mike Brown had three hits as the California Angels beat the Texas Rangers 2-0. Brown, 2-3, walked one and struck out four. 
Luis Quinones sent the Oakland A's ahead with a pinch-hit double in the seventh inning, breaking a 4-4 tie, and the A's finished the season with an 8-4 victory over the Kansas City Royals. Oakland's Rickey Hen­
 
derson had three hits and stole his 
league-leading 108th base. 
In the other NL games, winning pitcher John Stuper singled home two runs to cap a five-run first inning that carried the St. Louis Cardinals to a 9-6 victory over the Chicago Cubs. The Cards, last year's World Series champions, dropped to a 79-83 record to finish four in the NL East. 
Matt Sinatro singled in two runs and Brelt Butler had an RBI single as the Atlanta Braves beat San Diego. Brett was playing in his final game with Atlanta. He was the player to be 
named later in the deal on Aug. 28 
that sent Len Barker from Cleveland 
to Atlanta. 
-Kuenn fired 
Associated Press 
MILWAUKEE Harvey Kuenn 
said yesterday has been been fired as 
manager of the Milwaukee Brewers 
while General Manager Harry Dal­
ton declined to confirm the action. 
"As we all know, you are eventual­ly going to get fired in this business. I "'.Juld be lying to you if I said this wasn't tough, but it happened and I have to accept it," said Kuenn, who last year led the Brewers to the World Series.

those games should carry over to the tougher ones." 
Senior forward Ken Harkenrider, who picked up three assists yester­day at DePaul, spells out the team's frustration. 
"Scoring goals is nice, but its gets old," he said. "It's not as much fun scoring when you're only one of eights'guys to do it. 
"The preparation for the tough game against IU was lacking. We hadn't played anyone of their caliber. Sure, there aren't many in their caliber but the teams we played weren't even close." 
As far as what the upcoming home schedule has to offer, thae's Findlay this Friday night at Cartier. One would assume it's Findlay of Ohio, rather than Harry or Beatrice Findlay from the comer drugstore. 
But the way things are going of late, don't be too surprised either way. 
"The core of our schedule is this weekend's tournament at Mil­waukee (including host Wisconsin­Milwaukee, Wisconsin-Madison, and St. John's) and our upcoming game with Akron (October 19)," said Harkenrider. 
A win at Akron would erase the scars of the Indiana loss and would put the Irish in a position to get a postseason playoffbid. 
"As far as the bid is concerned, we would be better off playing more of the top teams In our Midwest region," Harkenrider said. "As it is now we only play three of the top ten in the Midwest when we should play eight or nine. The coaches who vote for the tournament invitations never get a chance to see us play." 
And there it is. As strange as it may sound, a close game would be kind of nice.

Dallas, developing a reputation as the Comeback Cowboys, spotted Minnesota a 24-12 halftime lead, then rallied for a 37-24 victory at Minneapolis. The Cowboys are 5-0, while the Vikings dropped to 3-2 . 
Minnesota gained its 11-point halftime lead on the strength of two touchdown passesfrom Steve Oils to Sammy White. 
Dallas cut the lead to 24-20 on 
Ron Springs' 5-yard touchdown nm, 
a score that was set up by Ron Hill's 
3 7 -yard punt return; Then came Fel­
lows' touchdown return ofthe inter­
ception and an insurance score on a 
12-yard TO pass from Danny White 
to Drew Pearson to climax an 84­
yard drive led by Tony Dorsett, who 
rushed for 141 yards. 
Theismann's third TO pass at Washington boosted the Redskins to a 4-1 record. The Raiders dropped to an identical mark.

touchdown pass -the first of many 
bad calls against the Irish. Notre 
Dame had to settle for a 21-yard 
Mike johnston field goal and a slim 
10-3lead. 
The game was decided In the 
second quarter as the Irish defense 
got tougher and the offense con­
tinued to move the ball effectively. 
Colorado played Its best football 
of the game In the first minute ofthe 
quarter as It stopped Notre Dame on 
three consecutive short-yardage 
plays on the Buffalo 5. This was also 
the low point of the game for the 
Irish as the coachescou t ld not called 
a time ou~o set up the fourth-down 
play and sent in freshman Byron 
Abraham which seemed to tip off 
everybody in the stadium about who 
would get the ball. The Buffaloes 
sure were not fooled, stopping 
Abraham for a one-yard loss. 
However, the Notre Dame 
defense continued to come up with 
the big plays, forcing Colorado to 
punt the ball. A dumb clipping 
penalty pinned the Irish inside their 
own 10, however, putting Beuerlein 
in his toughest situation of the day. 
Once again, the play calling came 
through. Mixing short passes with 
some tough running by another 
freshman star, Hiawatha Francisco, 
the Irish gradually moved up the 
field. The only third-down play of 
the drive was the most Important as 
Beuerlein zipped a pass to a well­
covered Howard for the first down. 
From there, Mark Brooks took the 
ball on a quick trap and rumbled 31 
yards for the touchdown. 
Notre Dame got the ball back 
quickly, giving it enough time to In­
crease the lead. 
This time Blair Klel was at quarter­
back. Faust put in the senior for fear 
that the high altitude would exhaust 
Beuerlein. His decision paid oti Al­
though Kiel almost made a costly 
fumble that would have let the Buf­
faloes get back in the game, he other­
wise played quite well. In fact, he 
made a tremendous pass under 
pressure that allowed Notre Dame 
get within field goal range. 
This time john11ton missed, however. His kick was tipped by Colorado's Victor Scott who came around the blockers like Miami's 
Reggie Sutton did last week when he blocked two kicks. Thus, the Irish went Into the lockerroom with only 17 points, despite gaining 343 yards of total offense. 
Seventeen points was more than enough, though. Colorado did move the ball better In the second half, but never had a chance. Notre Dame was moving the ball better despite pas­sing the ball only two times in the entire half.

and-11 play, Notre Dame was securely in control. Even with run­ning backs Lester Flemons and Dave Machtolfseeing their first varsity ac­tion for Notre Dame, the Irish were able to move the ball easily. 

With many first-time starters like freshman nose tackle Mike Griffin, safety Steve Lawrence, Beuerlein, and PerrinO playing well, the depth of the team looks better than many had believed. 
Possibly the most important aspect of the game was the intensity of the Notre Dame players. They scuffled with the Colorado players repeatedly, picking up some un­sportsmanlike: conduct calls, and they jumped around congratulating each other. This excitement was lacking from the first few games. 
It is possible that the effort against 
Colorado signals that the team has 
gotten over the bump, but it is hard 
to judge a team against an opponent 
as weak as Colorado. Next week's 
contest against South Carolina -a 
38-14 winner over Southern Cal this 
weekend -will be a tougher test. 
All that matters for now, though, is that the team played well, played in­spired, and got back in the win column. 
Now, ifwe can onlyfmd some way to get those mountains out to South Bend ....
