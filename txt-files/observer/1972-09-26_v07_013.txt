Lloyd All~n. current chairman of the local Re­elect the President campaign, opened the St. Joseph County Nixon headquarters last night by sounding a note of "cautious optimism." He acknowledged that President Nixon currently holds a large lead in the polls but hastened to add that much more work must be done to elect the "entire Republican team." 
Allen, former Mayor of South Bend, officially opened the Nixon Headquarters in downtown South Bend, before approximately one hundred fifty people. The event, featured speeches by Republican Congressional candidate Don Newman and Andrew Nickle, Chairman of the local Young Voters for the Pres.ident organization. 
Allen cited Nixon's accomplishments in the areas of Vietnam, the economy, and welfare reform. He praised the President for "having done more than any other man in recent history to make a major thrust toward world peace." 
"a clear choice" 
U.S. Congressional candidate Don Newman made a late appearance, but his extemporaneous remarks were clearly the highlight of the evening. Newman asserted that for the first time the voters of Indiana have a "clear choice" between him and Democratic Congressman John Brademas. Newman refrained from attacking Brademas directly, however, and referred only to the "McGovern-Brademas team" in his remarks. 
Newman gave his support to President Nixon's stand on the Vietnam war. He also voiced his agreement with Nixon's anti-bussing stand, and his assertion that "busing of school children is evil" drew a particularly enthusiastic response from the gathering. 
Newman closed by admitting that he possessed neither the organization nor the funds to rival those of the Brademas campaign, but he assured the gathering that his "persistence" would lead him to victory. 
YVP chairman Andrew Nickle opened his remarks by reading a telegram from President Nixon which congratulated local Republicans on the opening of their headquarters. Nickle, a Notre Dame law student and former member of Nixon's White House staff, told the gathering that the President has "returned a sense of dignity" to the White House through his concern for Americans as "individuals." 
concem lor the young 
Nickle also indicated Nixon's concern for young people by calling attention to the President's per­formance on the "issues which concern young America-the war, the draft, and the eighteen-year­old vote." 
Republican officials had hoped that Guber­
natorial nominee Dr. Otis Bowen would attend the 
opening of the headquarters, but the physician­
politician had a previous committment. Pete 
Klappenspeit, an aide to Bowen, represented the 
candidate and forecast that both Nixon and Bowen 
would win their respective races in November. 
Is there a Bobby Fischer lurking deep in the corners of Keenan Hall? Or how about a Boris Spaasky playing his heart out in the basement of Farley? Well, they'll all get a chance to appear at the first Observer chess tournament, October 2-8. 
The tournament is open to all students and faculty at Notre Dame-St. Mary's. The structure of the tourney will be an eight-match Swiss round. One 1round will be played daily Monday through Saturday nights, while the tournament will con­clude with two rounds on Sunday. 
Each night the rounds will begin at 7:00. All forfeits must be announced to the tournament directors prior to 7:00. 
A l dollar entry fee will be charged of all entrants competing for the cash prize and trophy that will be awarded to the winner. The presentation of the awards will be made Sunday night after the final round.

Lloyd Allen, former South Bend Mayor, urged support of the "entire Republican team" at the official opening of the St. Joseph County Nixon Headquarters. 

The customary introduction of all of the local Republican candidates followed the speeches, and Chairman Allen called for all party members to work for their election as well. 
The program was marked by periodic cheering from approximately thirty high school students bedecked with "Nixon Now" buttons and straw hats. While they gave each speaker a standing 
...while some polls show McGovern gaining support 
by jack Rosenthal <Cl 1972 New York Times 
Washington, Sept. 25-Two new political polls reported today that Sen. George McGovern, the Democratic presidential nominee, had narrowed the massive lead for President Nixon found in previous surveys. There were differences of opinion between the poll-takers, however, as to the significance of the findings. 
One new survey, conducted by Louis Harris and associates, reported a Nixon lead of 59 to 31, a 28­point spread. This compared with a 34 point spread, 63 to 29, reported early this month. 
"Statistically," Harris said in an interview, "the change is significant. But politically, well, Nixon still has nearly a 2-to-1 lead." 
The other survey, conducted for McGovern, showed that he has cut President Nixon's lead to 22 percentage points and is thus well within the goal set by his campaign managers. 
This survey offered several gounds for optimism, according to spokesmen at a news conference held today. They said they took the unusual step of releasing their findings in an effort to counteract the effect of surveys, conducted earlier, showing a widening Nixon margin. 
The Harris survey findings were based on 1,668 in­person interviews conducted September 19 to 21. The 59-to-31 per cent finding included people who described themselves as leaning to one candidate or the other. 
The principal change found over the prior survey, Harris said, was a movement toward McGovern among·voters under the age of 30.

The deadline for registration is Sunday night at

October 2-8 
In the prior survey, they were for Nixon, 52 to 42. The new findings, Harris said, was 47 to 45 for the President. 
The McGovern camp found further grounds for encouragement in new evidence of a "tremendous volaqlity" in the electorate, according to one of it's spokesmen, Patrick Caddell who is head of Cam­bridge ~urvey Researcht Inc. He is also McGover;; 's chief public opinion survey analyst. 
Caddell cited figures indicating that fully one­third of the electorate had not yet finally settled on its presidential choice. This volatility, he said, gives McGovern a real chance in the November election. 
The new McGovern survey findings were : Nixon, 56 per cent; McGovern, 34; undecided, 10. This represents a drop from the findings of a McGovern survey made in July which showed a 17-point Nixon advantage. But the new findings represented a substantial gain, Caddell said, over the 34-point Nixon margin reported in public polls conducted in late August. 
The new McGovern findings were released at a news conference called after the New York Times and Time Magazine published the results of a 16­state survey conducted by Daniel Yankelovich, Inc., a leading social research concern. This found a 62­to-23 per cent Nixon lead. <Story page 3). 
The McGovern spokesman didnot ~xplicitly take issue with the Times'Yankelovich survey, drawn from interviews conducted between Aug. 25 and Sept. 12. But Caddell said that "the public forgets" that polls taken three or four weeks ago "are a snap~hot of that period," not of the present.

The agreement would limit the number of offensive land-based and submarine-borne missiles possessed by the United States and the Soviet Union. 
Billings, Mont.--Sen. George McGovern charged that the Nixor administration was dominated by special interests in environments. and regulatory agencies. The Democratic presidential nominee told the Western States Water and Power Consumer Conference that "you would have to go back at least as far dS the administration of Warren

Washington--The House Ways and Means Committee voted to give President Nixon unlimited authority to cut whatever government programs he chooses, between now and June 30, in order to keep total government spending for the fiscal year at no more than $250 billion. The Committee's action, if approved the entire Congress, would constitute the most sweeping delegation ever made to the President of Congress's constitutional authority to control government spending.

Catholics boycott Irish summit 
We are proud to contribute so little to the high cost of listening. 
by Bernard Weinraub <C> 1972NewYorkTimes 

Darlington, England, Sept. 25-A three-day conference on the political future of Northern Ireland opened here today in mood of gloom and anger. 
The talks, in a heavily guarded hilltop hotel outside this city in the 
north  of  England,  focused  on  
political  tactics  to  calm  the  
stricken  province  and  the  

disparate party policies in Ulster. 
But the absence of four of the seven political parties in Northern Ireland--including representatives of the Roman Catholic minority­sharply weakened, perhaps even doomed, the impact of the meeting. 
"The whole community is in the grip of fear, suspic ion and misunderstanding," said a joint statement by two of the par­ticipating groups, the moderate Alliance party and the Northern Ireland Labor Party. "How many more must die, lose their jobs or homes before(the four parties) are prepared to sit down and talk." 
William Whitelaw, Ulster's 
administrator, said after today's session: "It would obviously be more satisfying if all these parties had decided to come to the con­ference. But no one can deny that as result of this conference there is discussion and dialogue on the future of Northern Ireland. 
solution is 
discussion 

"I have always believed that if you talk about a situation quietly and determinedly you can do nothing but good," he said. "If you don't discuss problems you'll never solve them, and this is what we're attempting to do." 
At today's closed session at the Europa Lodge Hotel, discussions centered on numerous political questions facing the province. These ranged from the shape of the new regional assembly to replace the old Sotrmont Parliament-which Catholics rejected as unfair and one-sided--to the delicate problem of who controls Ulster's ~!)lice and security.

New student SLC members emphasize issues

by Jerry Bradley 
Observer Staff Reporter 

Newly elected Student Life Council . representatives Anthony Abowd, Frank Devine, and Fred Giuffrida emphasized that coresidential dormatories are the prime issue that the SLC should consider this year. 
All three also noted that the SLC could be a powerful body once it is redifined. 
Anthony Abowd 

Abowd, representative from District 4, believes the big problem that the SLC faced last year was that the body's recommendations did not carry enough weight. He concrete are the students going to

ministration with well conceived

"something concrete can get 
done." 

He feels that over the year there Frank Devine, elected from has been a tremendous change in District 5, feels that this is the year the Administration's receptiveness when the SLC must take the to student issues. He noted that in initiative in dealing with the the past the Administration was campus issues. He feels that the solving problems after they Administration would like to see became a crisis. This year he'd the SLC take on more issues. He like to see the SLC,"handle issues pointed out that the Provost office before they become crises . " ends up handling the issues 
Abowd sees the most pressing because of the vacuum created byissue as being the coresidential no one else willing to take them on. debate. He feels the SLC must He sees the SLC as the body to research into the problem of relieve the Administration of many 
coresidential dorms and offer the 
Administration valuable solutions 
to all the implications. 

Finally Abowd believes that if the SLC were to fail this year the format should be scratched and a new body set up. 
Fred Giuffrida 
District 6 representitive Fred Giuffrida sees the SLC as presently being defined very loosely. He believes that the SLC must "define it's role in the university struc­ture." He added that the SLC has the potential to take on anything". 
Giuffrida agrees with Abowd that for the body to become well respected, it's members must do their job and present the Ad­ministration with responsible , ~\ recommendations. He also sees i f the main issue this year as being ' the coresidential question. Like . . . Abowd, he feels that only when the Gruffnda: S~C has potential to SLC comes up with something take on anythrng of the issues. 

Devine also believes that the SLC has got to stop thinking about legislating and get down to "the nuts and bolts things." First and foremost again is the coresidential issue. 
Devine feels that the SLC must present the Administration with reasonable accurate surveys. He thinks that he won't see coresidentialliving in this, his last year at the University, but that the SLC is obliged to lay the ground­work for later years. 
He is not satisfied with the university's continued plans for coeducation. He feels that the SLC must expand Notre Dame's commitment to coeducation. 
All three representatives see the need for the SLC to redefine itself. They believe that the SLC must take on more student issues with the biggest issue being the coresidential question. Finally, all three believe that this is the year that the SLC must prove itself to the Administration and the students.

MARDI GRAS '73 



by Richard Toland Observer Staff Reporter 
Newly elected SLC student­representatives Floyd Kezele, Matt Cavanaugh and Jim Hunt are well in harmony in their hopes for the present role of the Student Life Council as an organ operating within the university framework. All three want the SLC to quickly redefine and expand its respon­sibilities and powers. 
Floyd Kezele, the only one of the three returning to the SLC after previous membership has many proposals for the council. Kezele, from the third district, feels that more thorough insight into questions can be achieved by decentralizing the work load into committees. The committees recommendations would then be submitted to the entire council and

Kezele also hopes to expand the considerations of the SLc to in­clude certain business affairs. He envisions a shopping mall on campus run by outside firms operated in harmony with prearranged university policies. He called the bookstore a "monopoly on campus that should be investigated." His statement arose from discussing the ad­ministration's order for the Crypt, a record store on campus, to relocate.

We invited afew friends for dinner and they helped clean up the Genesee River. 
With the aid of a few thousand pounds of microorga­nisms, we're helping to solve the water pollution problem in Rochester. Maybe the solution can help others. 
What we did was to combine two processes in a way that gives us one of the most efficient water-purifying sys­tems private industry has ever developed. 
One process is called "activated sludge," developed by man to accelerate nature's microorganism adsorption. What this means is that for the majority of wastes man can produce, there is an organism waiting somewhere that will happily assimilate it. And thrive on it. 
The breakthrough came when Kodak scientists found a way to combine the activated sludge process with a trickling filter process and optimized the combination. 
We tested our system in a pilot plant for five years. 
(At Kod~k, we were working on environmental improvement long before it made headlines.) And the pilot project worked so well, we built a ten-million-dollar plant that can purify 36-million gallons of water a day. 
Governor Rockefeller called this "the biggest volun­tary project undertaken by private industry in support of New York State's pure-water program." 
Why did we do it? Partly because we're in business to make a profit-and clean water is vital to our business. But in furthering our own needs, we have helped further society's. And our business depends on society. 
We hope our efforts to cope with water pollution will inspire others to do the same. And, we'd be happy to share our water-purifying information with them. We all need clean water. So we all have to work together.

24 hr. Student Center studied 

Gorch skeptical of changes 
by David Rust Observer Staff Reporter 
Because of the growth of what he terms "The Modern Selfishness," LaFortune Student Center Manager Brother Francis Gorch is adamant against keeping LaFortune open 24 hours a day, a move that is seen by several groups on campus to be both desirable and possible. 
Bro. Gorch, LaFortune manager for eight years, believes it is neither. "I don't see any reason to keep this place open all night long," says Bro. Gorch. "There's no point in it. People on campus really retire around midnight most nights. Very few like to walk about the place after that time. Why, even the Observer staff (the Observer offices are located in LaFortune) is out of here by 1:00 a.m., I believe." 
Assumii'g that there is some kind of need or reason for main­taining NO's student center open the full day, Manager Gorch stands even more convinced of its near impossibility. 
"Theft and drt'1ks, those are the big things," sdys LaFortune's manager. "The way it is now, it's outrageous. Things are always being stolen." 
Brother Gorch reports that 
thousands of dollars worth of 
furniture has been liften from the 
center during his eight-year 
tenure, even though LaFortune has 
never remained open longer than 
midnight or 12:30 on weekday-eve 
nights, and 1:30 Saturday and 
Sunday mornings. 

"To keep LaFortune open all 
night would require posting 
security guards in the building,and 
paying them," says Bro. Gorch,. 
"Students couldn't be resoonsible for its safety. Security for a place like this is far different from that required for a residence hall. We're a natural magnet for drunks and rifraff." 
He notes that LaFortune has trouble now with undesirables. "If they bother us before midnight, they certainly would be here with greater frequency after," says Bro. Gorch. 
To meet this threat, he belives, students would be incapable of providing the necessary force and authority and would have no power to arrest or threaten the maurauders. "They'd be scared, wouldn't be able to do anything," says Bro. Gorch. 
Expenses is the common denominator underlying all of what Bro. Gorch sees as im­pediments to the proposed 24-hour opening; losses incurred by in­creased theft and vandalism, costs in maintenance (especially electric light bills) and salaries for the security guards. It is these things which keep other schools' student centers closed, he con­tends. 
"I've not seen a single school whose student center remained open must after midnight," says Bro. Gorch. "I wonder just how many schools even keep theirs open past eleven." 
He doesn't see a real possibility 
in cooperation with student 
government on elimination of 
these problems, having had 
several bad experiences with 
student government people in the 
past. 
"Sure, it's very possible that 
they could help eliminate the theft, 
the costs," says Bro. Gorch. "but

At 8: 30 that evening the Kenton they won't. I never have had any cooperation from them. They might keep the organization tight for as long as a week, but after that you couldn't depend on them." 
But Bro. Gorch's general 
disquiet comes not from matters of 
costs, salaries and lack of student 
dovernment cooperation, but from 
his belief that the wodl is suc­
cumbing to the "The Modern 
Selfishness"-"everybody wants to 
destroy everything to satisfy his 
own immature whim"--which 
attitude would render any kind of 
security or responsibility for 
LaFortune, opened 24 hours a day, 
impossible. 

"Everyone's got to destroy the 
good things these days," says the 
manager. "They've got to destroy 
everything beautiful, everything 
decent." He is not optimistic about 
guarding his building against the 
masses who,he believes, subscribe 
to this policy. 

In the end, as Bro. Gorch will 
readily admit, it is not he who would make the decision whether or not to open LaFortune for the full 24-hour period; that is the privilege of the Administration. · And, if there is a decision to open LaFortune on a full -<lay basis, Bro. 
Gorch does not believe he'll be the ' 
one to oversee its nighttime 
operation.

ND ruggers post fifth win, 32-6 
The Notre Dame rugby team 
unleashed a powerful offense 
and a stingy defense last 
Saturday as it rolled over the 
Kalamazoo--Western Michigan 
Rugby Club by a score of 32-6. 
The win was the fifth of the 
season for the ruggers, and all 
of the victories have come on 
the road. 
The Irish drew first blood 
early in the game when Herb 
Giorgio scored a try on a fine 
individual effort to give ND a 4­
0 lead. Kalamazoo fought right 
back with a try of their own and 
with a successful conversion 
led 6-4. 
But the Irish were not to be 
denied and they came back as 
Giogio scored his second try on 
an assist from John Greiving. 
Joe DeLois added another try 
for Notre Dame when he hulled 
his way into the end zone from 
five yards out to give the Irish a 
12-6 halftime lead. 
It wasn't until the second 
half, however, that the Irish 
ruggers really got untracked. 
Early in the third period, after 
a series of hard hits by the Irish 
serum, Ed O'Connell fell on a 
loose ball in the end zone to up 
NO's lead to 16-6. Dan Lee then 
added a pair of trys and 
O'Connell, who had misfired on 
the earlier conversion at­
tempts, booted successfully 
after each of Lee's try to fur­
ther pad the Irish margin. 
Henry Clarke rounded out the 
scoring on a long breakaway 
run to give Notre Dame the 
final 32-6 spread. 1 Once again--as the second 
half explosion indicated-Notre 
Dame's supurb conditioning paid off. Captain Joe Hafner feels that there isn't a team that can run with the Irish for t~·o forty-minute halves, and tfie last two games have sup­ported his belief. 
The emergence of a fine kicking game on the part of the Irish backs was also a factor, as ND kept Kalamazoo in a hole most of the afternoon. 
In the ·'B" game, the Irish ruggers turned in an awesome display of power as they overwhelmed their opponents, 44-0. Scrumhalf Ed Fishburne led the way for ND by scoring three trys. Jerry Razer added two more scores--one a long run in which he broke numerous tackles. 
The Irish tallied another breakaway score when Dave Simpson rambled 30 yards for a try. Bill Seetch and Mark Fredette also scored trys for Notre Dame, and John Mcintyre contributed 12 points on six conversions. The win hiked the Irish "B" team's record to 2-o. 
Notre Dame plays its-home opener against John Carroll University this weekend behind Stepan Center. The exact time of the game will be announced later. 
1-H exchanges 

Exchanges on lnterhall Football equipment can be made Wednesday, September 27th from 6 to 7 p.m. at Gate 11 at the stadium.

Irish booters wtn, 4-1 
An improved Fighting Irish soccer club took on the University of Cincinnati Saturday afternoon behind Stepan Center, and defeated the Bearcat hooters 4-1. After taking a half time lead of 2-1, the Irish were not seriously challenged, as a tough defense combined with two break-away goals accounted for the Notre Dame margin. · 
Arno Zoski, the new Irish soccer coach, has installed a brand-new approach to soccer which stresses versatility. Instead of each player specializing at one system, the Zoski system attempts to field players capable of playing any position. The teamwork con­cept also downplays individual scoring, favoring instead the team effort involved in setting up goals. 
Coach Zoski attributed last weekend's victory to a variety of factors, including a balanced team effort, better physical conditioning, a tight defense which produced key break­aways, and forcing the Cin­cinnati squad to play Notre Dame's type of game. Once the Irish had established their style of play, they were not seriously pressed_ 
Despite Notre Dames's four­goal showing, Coach Zoski described the Cincinnati game as a defensive one, and promised that his Irish would be moving toward a more of­fensive type of game. 

Rick Coleman's fine play was one nason for ND's 4-1 victory over ('incinnati 
The Irish travel to Goshen today to face Goshen College, a team they have not beaten in four years. On Saturday morning, Notre Dame takes on Purdue. 
FB injuries few 

Injuries were few in Notre Dame's season-opening football triumph over Northwestern. 
Runningback Greg Hill suf­fered a pulled hamstring and is ques!iona~le for Saturday's meetmg wtth Purdue. Defensive captain Greg Marx had to have stitches to close a gash in his face, but he will play against the Boilers. 
Sailors 2nd in regatta 
The Notre Dame Sailing Team took second place out of 14 schools last weekend in the Indiana State Regatta. 
The series was sailed in light air on Lake Lemon in Bloomington. Cancellation of the last race due to light air and the threat of a storm caused the Irish to drop behind the Universtiy of Michigan by two points. Miami of Ohio was a distant third. 
Kevin Hoyt, who skippered in B division with Bruce Marek as his crew, cleaned up in his class. He took low point honors with 13 points out of a possible 
70. Will Donelan and George Gaw shared the skippering duties in .. A division. With AI Constance crewing for them, they also turned in a fine performance despite the ab­sence of wind . 
I. U. 's famous puddle-jumper regatta was won by ND alumnus Tom Willison. The races were held on an 18-foot pond with homemade boats <limited to a 6" x 3" size.) The boats were propelled by winds--which were proportional to Hurrican force winds--created by three fans. 
In other sailing club action, Notre Dame hosted its hmme regatta on Diamond Lake two weekends ago. The University of Michigan won, with ND finishing 4th out of eight schools. Notre Dame had a fine showing, and put all available sailors into the races. 
Last spring the Irish were the number-three team in the midwest. They were just two points behind Ohio Wesleyan, and Michigan was the midwest titleists. Although the Irish didn't qualify for the nationals, they were represented on the midwest race team by skipper Kevin Hoyt. Hoyt's per­formance helped the MCSA win the Woods Trophy as the best collegiate racing team. 
Next weekend the Irish will be on the road again, this time to Marquette. They have also been chosen as the midwest representative for the Douglas Cup, the collegiate match race ' championships, which will be held at Long Beach Yacht Club OctQber 25-28. 
Anyone interested in joining the team-either for racing or pleasure sailing--should con­tact Bruce Marek (8360) or George Gaw (233-9073), or attend the club meeting this Wednesday at 6:30 p.m. in room 204 of the Engineering Building.
