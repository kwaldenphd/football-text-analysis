Saint Mary's to inaugurate Hickey president 
Hickey cherishes mission of Saint Mary's 
By MARGIE KERSTEN 
Saint Mary's f.dilor 
William Hickey, who will be inaugurated Sunday as the ninth president of Saint Mary's , said he would like to be remem­bered for enhancing and cherishing the values in Sc.mt Marys students.' 
After more than 25 years with the Col­lege in administrative and teaching pos­itions, Hickey was named president in February of last year. 
Upon his appointment Hickey said, To be asked to lead the institution that not only stands as one of the nations best umlcrwaduate colleges for women, but which has also provided me with so many personal challenges and rewards, is both an honor and privilege.' 
Hickey said he thinks the upcoming in­aunural weekend is something that goes along with the office (of president) -a new beginning lor the College. lve tried to remain emotionally detached, but I am now really getting more personally in­volved and excited.' 
More than $40, 000 has been spent on the various festivities surrounding the in­auguration and Hickey said the majority of the money was spent on food and the printing of invitations, tickets and signs. The College has a separate budget for the inauguration, Hickey said. 
He said because every student faculty member, administrator, staff member and alumna of Saint Mary's received an invititation, the College expects a full house in O'Laughlin auditorium for the inauguration. The auditorium holds ap­proximately I. 300. 
When plans were started for the weekend, Hickey said, the inaugural com­

SMC students recieve obscene phone calls 

By RACHAEL JAROSH 
Nnn~ Sl.t{{ 
Several students at Saint Mary's College have received obscene phone calls from a man claiming to be conducting a sur­vey, according to Richard Chlebeck, director of Saint Mary's Security. 
The caller has pretended to be surveying on the topic of parent­ing for the National Educational Association, Chlebeck said, add­ing the calls were similar to those received by Saint Mary's students last year. 
"Its likely that the same person is bothering Saint Marys stu­dents," said Chlebeck. 
One harassed student who re­quested anonymity, said the cal­ler began with questions regard­ing her age, hometown, and number of brothers and sisters. According to the student the cal­ler then began asking sexual questions. 
She said the caller asked how she felt about pre-marital sex and inquired if a man had ever seen her in the natural state, which she assumed to mean naked. 
"When I answered, its none of your business, he simply said Okay and went on. I should have hung up." 
The Notre Dame Security has not received complaints of similiar calls, according to secur­ity investigator Anne Schellinger. She said that last year an indi­vidual conducted a false survey over the phone, however. 
"The male individual would call and say he was conducting a sur­vey on grade school sex educa­tion," said Schellinger. She said the calls came from off-campus and could not be traced because the caller rarely harassed the same student twice. 
Chlebeck recently sent a letter to Saint Mary's students describ­ing the nature of the obscene calls and recommending steps to take against such calls.

Assistant News f.ditor 
South Bend Mayor Roger Parent has proclaimed this weekend Saint Marys College Weekend in South Bend' in conjunction with the activi­ties surrounding the inauguration of William Hickey as the ninth president of Saint Mary's on Sunday. 
Sister Madonna Murphy, Chair of the College's Board of Regents, will install Hickey as President at 2:30

Following the dinner, Heller said I 400 blue and white balloons will be released outside. Attached to each balloon will be a postcard. A student had the option of having her name printed on one of the postcards for donating 25 cents. 
The student whose postcard returns from the farthest distance by Oct. I will win a brunch for two at Tippecanoe Place Restaurant with Hickey and his wife.

U.S. airliner hijacked in Pakistan 
Associated Press 
KARACHI, Pakistan -A Pan American jumbo jet was seized on the ground at Karachi airport early today by four uniformed men who fired shots in the air and then stormed the plane, demand­ing to be nown to Cyprus, of­ficials said. 
Aviation sources said Pan American World Airways Flight 73 was on a route from Bom­bay, India, to Karachi; Frankfurt West Germany; and New York. Pan Am spokes­woman Pamela Hanlon said in New York that about 280 pas­sengers and 13 night atten­dants were on board the plane. 
A U.S. consulate spokes­man in Karachi said, To the best of my knowledge there have been no casualties. 
Hanlon said Americans were aboard, but she did not know how many. The night was scheduled to arrive at Kennedy International Airport at 3:25 p.m. EDT today, ac­cording to the airline. 
We are aware of the reports and are monitoring the situa­tion, said Peter Roussel, a White House spokesman in California with the vacationing President Reagan. The presi­dent has been informed and is being kept updated on it by John Poindexter, the White House national security ad­viser. 
Hanlon said the Boeing 747 was reboarding in Karachi around 9 p.m. EDT yesterday when four armed individuals, dressed as security guards, boarded the airplane and demanded they be nown to Cyprus. 
The men told the cockpit crew, who had left the plane, to get back on the craft and prepare for take off, she said. The men, wearing blue uni­forms, drove out to the parked jet shortly after it landed, ac­cording to airport sources. The men fired several shots in the air and then rushed up 
the stairs into the plane, said 
the sources. 
One airport source, who 
refused to be identified, said 
the plane's crew managed to 
nee the aircraft after hearing 
the shots, but none of the pas­
sengers were able to get off. 
U.S. 
consulate officials said they were in touch with the 

U.S. 
State Department in Washington, but could give no other details. In Washington, State Department spokes­woman Deborah Cavin said she had no information on the situation. 


Security forces at the airport went on immediate alert and personnel armed with ma­chine guns and rines quickly sealed off the area of the tar­mac where the plane was parked for refueling. 
Officials at the airport refused to say if they were in contact with the men in con­trol of the plane, nor would they say if they had any idea who the men were or why they had seized the jet.

Awareness of student rights is goal of Judicial Council 
By MARK MELLETT 
Staff Reporter 
"Students are not properly aware of their rights or of the function of the Judicial Council," said Coordinator Maria Cintron, speaking last night at the first meeting of the council this year. 
" The student body lacks a source that clearly explains what punishments are possible when a violation occurs and what can be done, said Cintron. 
Cintron said she thinks one of the major problems is that stu­dents don't know their rights. Cintron added that she wanted to publicize what students can do when they have a problem. 
"Using a $2,450 budget, the council plans to inform students 
of their  rights by publishing  a  
Student  Rights  Manual, "  said  
Cintron.  

"The manual will list violations, possible punishments and per­sons to contact if there is a prob­lem,"she said. Cintron added that 
Help the dp March of Dimes I 
the council plans to distribute the 
manual to each dorm room. 
"The ourpose of last night's meeting was to orientate mem­bers to the functions of the coun­cil, "said Cintron. She indicated that most of the 24 members who represent the dorms are new. 
In addition to better informing students of their rights, Holy Cross council member Paul O'Connell said the image of the council has to be improved. O'Connell said students see council members setting punish­ments and don't see them as there to help. 
To inform students of his rights and to improve the image of the council, O'Connell sugges­ted that the council change stu­dents' perception that members work only behind closed doors. 
O'Connell added that he plans to increase student awareness in Holy Cross by meeting with freshmen on a one-one-one basis.

The letter cautioned against trying to be clever with obscene callers and advised students to hang up immediately upon hearing an obscene remark or improper question. 
Chlebeck also advised stu­dents who receive obscene or an­noying phone calls to report to the campus Security Office im­mediately. He said the Security Department will determine the nature of the call and, if neces­sary, place a tab on the phone to trace the call. 
Chlebeck said it was difficult to trace the calls due to the of­fender's practice of not harass­ing the same student more than once.

mittee asked, How can we design a program involving all groups of people? 
The program evolved the way it did because I and the commit­tee felt strongly about involving all constituencies of campus, Hickey said. We wanted things designed for specific groups of people including staff. faculty, administration and students, he said. 
Tonight. there will be a student dinner in the Dining Hall and at 9 there will be an All Student Party in Angela Athletic Facility. We wanted to involve the stu­dents in a very real way, Hickey said. He also said the staff of Saint Mary's is invited to a picnic to be held next Wednesday. The Sisters of the Holy Cross are in­cluded in the reception. -Saint Mary's seniors will be in­volved in the more formal part of the inauguration, Hickey said. Each senior has been invited to participate in the inauguration procession Sunday with the pres­ident. dignitaries and other col­lege administrators. A majority of the seniors are participating. he said. 
Hickey said the focus of his in­augural address will be to build on the rich tradition of Saint Marys as well as the strengths and strong assets of womens colleges." He said he believes the Saint Mary's experi­ence is unique and the total edu­cation is more than the class­room experience. 
The Church and the Age of the Laity will also be a focus of his address. adding his presidency is an exciting opportunity to devdop new models of govern­ing our institution. Because of the probable decline of the Sisters of the Holy Cross. there will be a need to share more re­sponsibility with laity, he said. The continued ownership of Saint Mary's by the Sisters of the Holy Cross is important to the continuance of Saint Marys as a Catholic institution. Their pres­ence (Sisters of the Holy Cross) guarantees their mission will indeed be carried out.· 
The sisters provide significant invited by Hickey include Sister Francis Bernard, the superior general of the Sisters of the Holy Cross; Sister Roseanne Schultze, Chair of the Board of Regents, who will give the benediction, and George Craig. the Clark pro­fessor of Biology at Notre Dame, who Hickey worked under for his doctorate.

New fund may pressure ND Trustees to divest 
t1crc's a very concrete su~~cstion i:IS to whi:lt Notre Di:lmc students and alumni can do to pressure their own University toward divestment of funds invested in companies that arc doin~ business in South AfricCJ. 
Jurgen Brauer 
guest column 

!.d's bttild up a C<IITot·and·stick fund th_at will work as follows: Alumni and alumni-to-be !that's you folksJ me asked not to respond to Notre Dame's rc~ulm pleas for money l>y handin~ over checks to the administration. Rather, the checks that alumni and you would have ~iven to the administration is to ~o into a carrot­
and-stick fund 1perhaps jointly adminis­tered by the Anti-Apc.~rthei<l ~roup on cwnpus c.~ml an c.~lumni ~roup). The money that accumulates in the carrot­c.~nd-stick trust fund wil only be released to the Notre Dame administration once 
is  has  fully  divested  from  companies  
<loin~  business  with  the  wcist  South  
African rc~imc.  

It is obvious that at some point the funds accumulc.~ted in the fund will be­come ~realer than the dividends our ad· ministration reaps from its current invest­ments in Sout11 Africc.~n related firms. Say for example, that our University has in­vested $30 million in such companies. Also say, for the sc.~ke of the ar~ument. that it gets a mea~er return of I 0 percent on those investment, hence $3 million per year for the benefit of our education. 
Consequently, as soon as alumni ancl alumni-to-be have contributed $3 million to the carrot-and-stick trust fund we can talk divestment in rather concrete terms. ror how can the administration refuse to <livest in order to get the money in the fund'? It can do so only at the expense of foregoing that amount of money which ~oes beyond the $3 million or so that it can collect on dividends. 
But why would our money-hungry ad­ministration want to forego any dollars? In fact, I suspect that the uproar of even the inactive students and alumni could be heard fairly well if the administration did not take in the addition money sitting 
around in the carrot-and-stick trust fund. And an uproar would certainly seem jus­tified for money that the administration does not take in potentially increases our tuition and room-and-board costs. 
And now, just ima~ine the fun Coca­Cola's man will have on Notre Dame's Board of Trustees when he has to vote divestment from his own companies to fulfill his role as trustee, nay, as chairman of the Board of. Trustees. So, Anti­Apartheid Network people and all others who would like to see Notre Dame divest from the racist minority regime in South Africa: make something of the idea. It's yours. Jurgen Brauer is a Notre Dame graduate student. 

Research should not interfere with teaching

lhis stereotype, to s.1y the lcilst, is pure fant<Jsy. In tml<~y's unin~rsities <1nd col­ll'~ws throu~lhout the n.ttion, professors not only hilve ri~<>rous tcachin~ schedules, they have another. frequently appcminH more important role than tcachin~r it is !hilt of rese<Jrchin~ and publishin~l­

This has led to some f.tirly typical results. The ion~ established leaders in education at the university level hc.~vc simply rccicved more money in the wc.~y of investments ami ~rants to continue what they have been doin~ for ycc.~rs: renmin at the forefront of university edu­cation. 
In addition, nmny smaller universities, who in the past have had trouble procur­in~ funds, have received more money and have been able to increase the status of their repsective institutions.

output. 
This can lead to some obvious prob­lems. The most sinnificant of these is tl1<.1t often lirncs a professor's course load is reduced drastically, simply because of unwritten research and publication re­quirements. 
This means tlli:lt sometimes the less competent professors, or even tcachin~ assistants, arc ~ivcn the bulk of the in­structinB assi~nments so the more qualified professors may rescc.~rch and publish. This results in llltlllcrous com­plications, such as poor course selection and the uneven distribution of cducatin~ duties. 
An application to a real life problem would perhaps he helpful, so let's take a look at the Notre Dwnc rrench Depart· mcnt. 
This semester there are only five 300­400 level french courses offered to stu­dents wishing to fulfill requirements for the french major. Only four of these are in rrcnch, c.~ml four arc literature courses, the other l>ein~ a lin~uistics course. 
Needless to say, this is not the ideal offcrin~ to students wishin~ to major in rrench. Assumin~ <.1 French major should ~rc.~duatc with a proficiency in writing. reading. speaking. translatin~ and com­prchendin~ the rrcnch lan~ua~c. which would facilitate an ability to live comfor­tably in a rrench conmnmity, which is nul an unreasonable assumption, the course offerin~s this semester arc vastly inade­quc.~tc. 
Grc.~ntcd, a litcratue course involves, to a de~ree, the skills of writing. speaking. translatin~ and comprehending. but a literature course is specifically designed for reading literature. It is not a French composition course, or a designed to ap­ply any more than the rudimentary, or at best intermediate clements of these skills. 
lthink it would be fruitless to argue that these other skills arc not necessary for the French major. But if they are impor­tant, why are courses specifically de­si~ned to enhance these other skills not bein~ offered'? 
The undcrlyin~ reason is shameful. There bcin~ only one senior professor in 
the entire French department. the Univer­sity has reduced the course loads of many teachers in the department in order that these educators may have time to even­tuate a publication which, in the Univer­sities eyes, would presumably have a· hand in determining said educator's fu­ture at Notre Dame. 
The end result is simple: all students with an interest in meeting the require­ments for French as a first or second major have been denied the opportunity to enhance their skills in many specific areas of the French language. 
It is, in my opinion, unacceptable for a lan~uage department not to offer courses specifically designed to enhance each individual skill of its respective lan­~uage if majors in that language are ac­cepted by the university. It is simply not very practical or very fair to those inter­ested in becoming proficient in a partic­ular language. 
I do not advocate that educators should abandon research and publication for in­sstucting. but neither should the stu­dent's right to a fair and comprehensive education in a particular field be denied by the unavailabbility of causes in the !llost rudimentary skills in said field. · 
Obviously, a viable balance must be attained. This balance should provide an opportunity for the student to fortify skills in all areas of a specific subject while simultaneously allowing the educator to research and publish for the benefit of the university and for the vencfit of edu­cation itself. 
In my opinion, this is not the type of balance currently av ailable in the Notre Dame French Department. To avoid turn­ing out less than competent French majors and simply to attract more stu· dents to the department. a wider variety of courses designed specifically to en­hance individual skills is essential.

Homosexuality rooted in sociological factors 
A common assumption noats daily through the national press as well as The Observer and it is surprising that no one even challenges it. This is the univeral offhand separation of people into two categories, homosexuals and heterosexuals, as if such a classification is so self-evident as to need no justifica­tion. 
Chris Julka 

guest column 
Thus we hear of homosexuals coming out of the closet, as if homosexuality were the natural disposition of these people against which they can do nothing, and this is to go beyond the mere polymorph perversity to which Freud refers. What is more, various groups have marched the streets in San Francisco, established themselves in a number of universities and picketed before the White House in an attempt to spread the cause of gay rights. 
By this. what is assumed is that the homosexual's very identity is inseparable from his act of homosexuality, as though being a homosexual is the same thing as being a man or woman. Thus at the Dem­ocratic National Convention at San Fran­cisco, Jesse Jackson included the homosexuals into his Rainbow Coalition as if being homosexual were the same, thing as being Hispanic or black. 
Furthermore, many stories have now made the cover of Newsweek and other national magazines telling of some adolescent or young adult who suddenly discovers that he or she is gay, in much the same way that one would discover that one has Parkinson's Disease or a heart murmur. 
But is all of this really the case? Is there such a thing as gays being liberated and allowed to come at last out of the closet as the media would have us believe, or are beings who are at bottom simply or­dinary people being convinced that they were born to perform homosexual acts? 
What is amazing is that although ad­herents of the latter view arc usually guil­lotined by the popular media as being ignorant or non-progressive, the actual evidence points in their direction. Con­sider the following: As of yet, no real evidence exists that sexual abberations running through generations or among blood relations are not the result of living in similar or identical environments. Thus, despite all of the claims about being born homosexual and hopelessly and forever unable to change, absolutely no one has demonstrated that homosexuality results from a genetic fac­tor, as do mongolism and myopia, for instance. 

Since genes do not serve as an ade­quate explanation, homosexuality has been frequently attribuuted to hormonal imbalances. When homosexual subjects were administered heavy doses of male hormones, however, although the sexual drives intensified, no change occurred in the object of these drives. 
On the other hand, it has been shown statistically that sociological back­grounds often have a direct correlation with the number of homosexuals in a given population. A l1igh proportion of homosexuals, for instance, come from disturbed homes where they experienced difficulty in identifying with the parent of their own sex. 
In fact, contrary to the claim that homosexuality is an innate trait, from which one can never free oneselt, both modern learning theories and rrcudian psychoanalysis locate their roots in one's 
sociological conditioning or traumas ex­
perienced during chii(J development, 
whether it be the case of an over­
protective mother, a broken horne, or a 
passive or inaccessible father. 

Social conditioning theories do not serve as total explanations for homosexuality of course, because fre­quently people in identical environments grow up developing entirely different sexual orientations. This, however, merely provides a case for the relevance of the free will in becoming or not be­coming homosexual. 
Homosexuality involves an active par­ticipation or intention, after all, and thus requires a person's willing consent in at least some way. Given t11c unpopularity of concluding that we could possibly be responsible in at least some way for our actions, I will ntJt push this theory. What is important is this: despite everything you have l1earcl or read in the media, there is absolutely no cviclcncc wlwt­socvcr that homosexuality results from renegade genes, an atypical physiology or any other constitutional factors. What evidence there is, in fact, militates against this view.

Choosing a major relies on personal insight 
Discovering what course of curriculum suits you best can be a very difficult task. At 18 or 19, most college students find it very stressful to make career decisions that will effect the rest of their lives. In fact, a large percentage do not decide upon a definite major until their junior year; meanwhile, sampling various majors until they find the academic nitch which is most appropriate for them. 
Lisa Boykin 

in thru the out door 
Originally, I came to Notre Dame with intentions of pursuing a career in medicine. Like most freshmen, I found the curriculum to be much more demand­ing than I had anticipated and somehow it did not live up to my expectations of discovering some magical elixer in Chemistry lab. Instead, I was over­whelmed by a tremendous amount of in­tegral equations, molecular structures, and thermodynamics. It was difficult for me to see the correlation between detailed and complex mathematics and giving a child a booster shot. 
I managed to endure until my sopho­more year and then selected Pre­MecWsychology as my intended major. Sometimes I wondered ifmy glossed over images about being a doctor actually ad­hered to the reality of the profession. After a very confusing and disillusioned first semester, I changed my major to Pre-Med-Government. Although I hadn't realized it at the time, I felt very dis­satisfied with my studies. This unhapi­ness seemed to carry over into every aspect of my life, hovering over me like a dark cloud. 
Then, one week after classes had started for the Spring semester, a pivotal event occurred. I stayed up half of the night gazing at the same page in my Bi­ology text book. I finally admitted to myself that I stin hadn't quite found my academic nitch. Something had been eating at me all along, the desire to pursue a different interest. Yet I had denied and ignored it. 
I occassionally entertained the thought of changing my major and attending law school but usually abandoned the thought. It was too painful to consider relinquishing the dreams that I had clung to for so many years. They were not only my dreams but my family's as well. Would I be giving in to the pressure or making a mature decision about my own happi­ness and future? I felt like a quitter. How would I know if I was going in the right direction? Would I eventually regret this decision? I was engulfed by feelings of guilt and doubt but mostly confusion. 
That morning, I ran around frantically dropping and adding classes. Finally, I held the last drop slip in my hand. I was scared and felt a big lump in my throat as I walked slowly toward Galvin to turn it in. I prayed for some type of guidance and lingered in tile hallway waiting for devine inspiration. Somebody, anybody walk by and tell me not to do it. to do it. Well, I can always pick it up again next semester if I dont like this,· I thought. 
A tear swelled up in my eye as I watched her sign my dream away. There, I did it. No more labs. 
I wrestled with my decision for the remainder of the semester and all sum­mer. I flipped coins, picked petals off of nowers in the spring (doctor, lawyer, doc­tor, lawyer), talked to my parents, and most significantly, I prayed. 

I think the saddest day of my life was telling my 70-year-old grandmother that I wasn't.going to be a physician. My mot­her applauded my decision, commending me for having the courage to examine my heart and select a course ofstudy that would not only make me happy but com­pliment that talent that I had neglected, writing. After two years of soul-searching, I have arrived at my current major. Gov­ernmenWhilosophy. I am finally comfort­able and acclimated with my decision. 
By no means have I conquered all of my doubts and fears. No one ever does. In fact, sometimes I even wonder about what could have been 1.d1en I hear my roommate talk of MCAT'S and medical school. Yet this has proven to be such a growing experience that I wouldn't trade it for the world. 
To all of those many people who feel unsure and dissatisfied with their m<uor. I have no magical words that will render contusion. The procc.o;~ ol cllangin~1 or selecting a major is not always as grueling an experience as it was for me, but it does require a tremendous amount of introspection all(! honesty with yourslf.

P.O.BoxQ 
Gay groups deserve campus representation 
Dear Editor: 

Father Tyson insists that  formal recognition of GLNIYSMC (Gays and Les­bians at Notre DamC!St. Marys College) carries with it an implicit sanction for a homosexual lifestyle which is not in keeping with the values of the University or the teachings of the Church." Why not therefore recognize GLNIYSMC as a poli­tical and educational organization rather than as a social group? Why not simulta­neously make it clear that official recogni­tion ofGLND'SMC in no way connotes Uni-. versity approval of a homosexual lifestyle? 
The homophobia on this campus is per­vasive and deeply rooted. II comes not only from students, but also from profes­sors, priests and administrators. As an aggrieved minority, gays and lesbians have every right, ·perhaps even a moral obligation, to organi7e and to act in order to combat the discrimination which turns up with such tragic frequency on this campus. 
As a university which has long pre­sented itself to the world as catholic, pro­gressive and respectful of minorities, Notre Dame has its own obligation to point the way in displaying toleration and respect for homosexuals as well as for more socially acceptable minorities. I believe that we can work together to dis­pel the homophobia which infects this campus. We might even hasten tile com­ing of that day when we will regard each other's sexual orientations with as much toleration and respect as we already show for each other's racial, ethnic and religi­ous backgrounds.

Bo gives Notre Dame advantage 
Associated Press 
ANN ARBOR, Mich. -Michigan Coach Bo Schembechler says Notre Dame will have the advan­tage when the two teams open their football season Sept. 13, despite the fact that the Wol­verines are ranked No. 2 in the nation. 
The problem, as Schem­bechler sees it, is that Notre Dame has not one, but two new coaches. It's well-known that former Minnesota Coach Lou Holtz has taken over for Gerry Faust. What is less well-known is that former Pittsburgh Coach Foge Fazio has signed on as de­fensive coordinator for the Fight­ing Irish. 
"The Notre Dame team is a talented ballclub, Schembechler said at a luncheon yesterday."! know the personnel there. I tried to recruit most of those players. Theyre all fundamentally sound. Theyll be a good team. 
"That will be a big plus, 

.. 
knowing their players, because we dont know exactly what Lou will do. We know hes sound, though. 
"More important, we dont know what defense theyll use with Fazio. He may put in the Pitt defense or they may use the Min­nesota concept." 
Schembechler said his coaches watched Notre Dame in spring drills, but said that wasn't very telling. 
They played a 7-2 defense, the Michigan coach said. My word, you might as well have conl£ and watched us in spring drills. 
"With a new defensive guy, youre really getting it on both sides. Well be sparring out there for a while, probably. We'll go in with a plan and go. But, if we see that isn't working, we're going to change it fast and go with some­thing else. So, it's important in 
this situation that  we  hiwe vet­ 
eran players."  
Schembechler  said  the  task  

would be somewhat easier if the 

Michigan head football coach Bo Schembechler thinks his team could be in for a difficult contest against Notre Dame next weekend. The above story details Schembechler's thoughts on the 1986 Irish.

"I know Lou and I know how he thinks, Schembechler said. But his personnel may force him to do some things he normally doesnt like to do. We are by no means ruling out the option. He may switch quarterbacks and go from Steve Beuerlein (a passer) to Terry Andrysiak Ia better run­ning quarterback)." 
On the nip side of the win, Schembechler worries that Holtz knows all there is to know about the Michigan team because he coached against the Wolverines the past few years when he was at Minnesota. 
" Lou knows our football. He knows our players," Schem­bechler said."Hes played them for two years. 
"Theres no doubt that from a scouting standpoint, the advan­tage is to Notre Dame."

After big victory in season opener, ND soccer team is home for two 
By PETE GEGEN 
Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame soccer team will open its home schedule this weekend with two games on Alumni Field. 
The Irish will first host the Boilermakers of Purdue on Sat­urday, and the Golden Gophers of Minnesota will provide the competition on Sunday. Both games start at I p.m. 
The team enters this weekend's action fresh off its vic­tory over the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. Because the Panthers were ranked third in the Great Lakes region, the Irish ar~ excited about their po­tential for a successful season. 
"We have the potential to be very good,"said Head Coach Den­nis Grace."The chemistry of the 
team is good right now. That should help us alot." 
The team is playing remarkably well together at this point early in the season. 
"The teamwork improved in the victory," noted Grace. " They worked hard, played hard, and hung in together." 
One player who has noticed the difference is goalkeeper Hugh Breslin. Breslin faced 15 shots on goaL saving six in regis­tering the shutout. 
''I was really confident in the defense," he said." With Johnny Guignon, Steve Lowney, and Pat 
Szanto  we  are  really  experi­ 
enced."  
It was Guignon who,  besides  

playing excellent defense. in­itiated the offensive attack which led to the only goal of the game. 
"It was Johnny who dribbled the ball around and passed it to th~

right side to Kevin Kade,"noted Irish forward Bruce Tiger McCourt, who scored the goal. "That opened up the left side, so 
I took the far post." 

The ball was centered, and 
Irish forwards Randy Morris and 
Dave Augustyn went for the 
header, luring the keeper from 
the net. The ball sailed over, and 
McCourt headed it home. 

"It was really pretty easy:' he ad­
mitted. 

The tally was a good omen for 
McCourt, who had been feeling 
the pressure to score goals. He 
said that he felt he was in a slump 
all last season, scoring only 6 
goals on 45 shots in 22 games. 
The Irish hope to keep up the 
intensity this weekend. The 
feeling is that the team should 
beat Purdue, which had only a

Irish look to defensive linemen for improved pass rush in 1986 season 
By ERIC SCHEUERMANN 
Sports Writer 

Perhaps the most vivid memory Notre Dame football fans have of last season is that of an opposing quarterback standing in the pocket with un­limited time to pick apart the Irish secondary. 
Defensive Line Coach Joe Yonto, who coached past Irish lines from 1964 to 1980, hopes this year's scenario will be differ­ent. 
"The pass rush is one of the most important things weve been working on,' said Yonto~'To help our coverage weve got to get a pass rush. You know what happens if you dont get to the passer, so we've made getting to him one of our top priorities. 
"Were happy tints far, but until we play against an opponent we really cant tell. We hope t11e pass rush is coming along-put it thai way." 
One of the most important new faces on the Irish defensive line is senior Robert l~anks at left tackle. Banks was moved up from linebacker last spring. when tt1e new lrisl1 coaching staff was faced with a shortage of linemen. 
Banks, having bulked up a bit since then, has not disappointed his coach. 
"Again, its difficult to tell before we play somebody, but were ex­tremely pleased with Banks' progress solar," sdid Yon to~· tics worked hard ancl clone every­tiling wevc asked him to. He seems to have all tile necessary tools to play on tile line. tlc'll help oul with his quickness for the p<lss rush ami also will give us some more speed on tile line." 
Senior Wally Kleine will again occupy tile right tackle spot. At 6-9 and 274 pounds. he gives the Irish an imposing look on that side. 
"Klcincs worked ext remel) hard, and hcs got a great attitude just like the other guys," said Yonto." Hell do some very good things for us -well just have to

New building, facilities in works to benefit students 
It won't be long until yet another construction proj­
ect begins on the Notre Dame campus. Land has 
already been cleared north of the Courtney Tennis 
Courts in order to begin construction on an indoor 
practice facility for Irish teams. 
This new facility will include a new weight room 
for all varsity athletes, an artificial-turf football-sized 
practice field, a track, batting cages, conference 
rooms and storage areas, according to Athletic Direc­
tor Gene Corrigan. Corrigan also mentioned the pos­
sibility of adding nets to create driving ranges for 
the golf team. There will be conference rooms in the 
new building but no offices other than a building 
manager's office. 

"Itil free up the whole area (in the ACCs north dome) 
for student use during the afternoon and evening 
hours," said Corrigan~' I til free up the present weight 
room for student use, and well have a student weight 
room at each end of the campus." 
Corrigan said that an important factor during the 
planning stages of the facility was that the building 
b~ functional without being extravagant. 
"Its not going to be an attractive building.· he said, "but it wont be entirely ugly. The architects are going to great pains to have it decent.· 
For those who might think this is being built solely 
because of the arrival of Lou Holtz (who had a new 
practice facility built when he assumed the head slot 
at Minnesota), Corrigan said this building has been 
under consideration for the past five years, and it is 
only now that the plans have been finalized. 
The footings on the new tennis building also have 
been laid. Corrigan said that when the two new build­
ings are completed, a new track has been laid and 
stands have been added to it through Special Olym­
pics." well have everything.' 

It shouldn't surprise anyone that so much building 
has taken place in the athletic department during 

Dennis Corrigan Sports Editor 

Corrigan's stewardship. During his nine years as Vir­
ginia's athletic director, a new baseball stadium, a 
tartan-surface track and an intramural recreation 
complex were built. the tennis facilities were ex­
panded and 14,000 seats were added to the football 
stadium. 

The new athletic facilities at Notre Dame should 
be a great benefit to varsity athletes but more so to 
students, who will now have more recreational space 
that is more convenient to use. 

On the other side of sports, this week's James Watt 
shoot-yourself-in-the-foot award goes to Sports Il­
lustrated and the NCAA for the report that Notre Dame 
was under investigation because former Irish football 
players Allen Pinkett and Greg Dingens appeared in 
television ads promoting the Army. It's turned out 
that there are some pretty embarrassed people at 
both organizations. The NCAA has since called Notre 
Dame to apologize for the statement, saying that 
whoever said that shouldn't have. According to Cor­
rigan, the ads were were cleared with the NCAA before 
they aired. "lhe NCAA and Sports lllustrat~d have their foots in 
their mouths," said Corrigan." It was a mistake on 
both sides. Sports Illustrated got wrong information, 
and it renects bad on them." 
Sometimes, you have to wonder. 

In the believe-it-or-not category, just when you 
think that the NCAA is starting to really take serious 
action against major violators, 53 -count 'em -53 
members of the Nebraska football team face one­
game suspensions and seven others face two-game 
suspensions because they gave away their game tick· 
ets to people other than family members or students. 
Nebraska faces the possibility of forfeiting a game 
somewhere along the line this season, pending an 
appeal. When players at other schools are convicted 
of stealing stereos, drunk driving and drug posses­
sion and are still allowed to play, this NCAA ruling 
seems not only harsh but absurd. 
In the kudos category, congratulations to Ticket Manager Mike Bobinski and his staff for running a much smoother ticket distribution this year than in previous years. Sales were forced to move to gate .l 0 rather than gate three because of another event in the ACC Field House. This move turned out to to be a God's send because it allowed sale from five windows rather than three. Ombudsman's idea to distribute tickets to those in line at I p.m. to avoid a mad rush to the doors when they opened also deserves congratulations. Everyone who stood through the long. slow lines in previous years had to appreciate the ease of this year's distribution. 
And finally in the good luck category, former Nolte Dame head coach Gerry raust takes to the field to­morrow in his first game as head coach of the Akron Zips. Akron has shattered its record for season-ticket sales and enthusiasm is running high. This week there was to be a continuous football toss on campus, a Faust sound-alike contest (where are you Eddie White?) and members of a fraternity were run­ning the game ball from Salem (W. Va.) College back to Akron. The Zips arc moving from Division 1-M to l·A next year and want all the exposure they can gel because of t"aust. If there was ever a man who deserved some good fortune, it's Gerry Faust. 
Good luck, Coach.
