Victims abound after latest crime wave 
by Davtd Sarphie 
The Notre Dame campus was ravaged by a wave of crime and violence over the week-long Fall break, as three rooms of one dorm were burglarized and one student was beaten. 
Officials indicated that the thieves may have been the same ones responsible for earlier crimes, both on and offcampus. Additionally,. two unrelated off-campus robberies occurred. 
Two suspects have been arrested in the October 23 assault of Keenan Hall resident Andy Farah. 
Keenan Rector Fr. Richard Conyers said that two South Bend residents, Dan Adkins, 19, and a juvenile, were brought to the campus as guests of three Keenan Hall residents. 
The two became separated from the students and proceeded upstairs, where they entered two unlocked rooms. They vandalized and robbed both rooms. Taken from the rooms were several books, calculators, and miscellaneous items. 
The resident of one room, Mike Travis, remarked that several stereo components were severely damaged, as was a television. He surmised that the two burglars were planning to steal the stereo components, as they had been stacked next to the door. 
Subsequently, several stolen items were found near the car of the three Keenan residents who had brought the thieves to campus. Several officials believe that the two were planning to steal the car. 
Fr. Conyers noted that the criminals were "drunk or high or both." He deduced this from their reckless handling of the components. 
The thieves left the two burglarized rooms and went downstairs, where they found Andy Farah asleep in front ofhis television. He was hit on the forehead witha bowling pin which had been taken from one of the upstairs rooms. Still groggy, he fell to the floor, chipping his tooth. The two individuals hit Farah once again on the back of the 
.,.. head, demanding money. "I woke up and saw these guys standing over me," Farah t;elated. "It looked alm.ost like they had guns and they wanted money." The thieves quickly left, and Farah immediately called Notre Dame

Plimpton comments on his career 

George Plimpton, currently the editor o.i:" The Par/r Review, i:-­renowned for his journalistic in­volvemen~s in sportsani politics. He was interviewed recently by Observer reporter Mike O'Brien. 
Q: In his latest book, Thomas Wolfe 
listsyour writing as an example ofNew Journalism. What is New journalism? 

.Plimpton 
A: I wouldn't have put myself in there, but I'm very flattered because I admire him. It seems to me that NewJournalism is a very personalized type of journalism, very subjective, even to the point of the language ... whereas the only thing I've done subjective is the approach ofgetting involved with these (sports) teams. The reportage that I do once I get in there is pretty much straight for­ward. 
Q: Exactly how does thts new jour­naltsm differ from old journalism? 
A: Much more of one's self is involved, as well as tricks of lan­

thieves to campus have since been permanently removed from the dorm. The action taken by Dean Roemerwas termed "very generous" by the Keenan rector. 
"Although the students weren't directly involved in the crimes, there were certain related circumstances which caused their dismissal from the dorm," he said. "I thought the Dean was very reasonable in his actions." 
The rector was optimistic tha~ the capture of these suspects may

When will it end? 
Hostage stalemate continues 
by The Associated Press 
Iran's Parliament, the Majlis, failed again yesterday to reach a decision on the fate of the 52 American hostages after a debate of nearly six hours and will resume the discussion W ednes­day, informed sources in Tehran reported. 
A Tehran Radio broadcast said the United States was indulging in "wishful thinking" about the debate. 
"They are now bragging about the imminent release of the hostages," it said after the session.· "This is a rumor with which they want to gratify themselves." 
Continuing the secret debate 
that began Sunday, the 228­

member Majlis met for four . 
hours in the morning, recessed 
for two hours for prayers, and 
then met again in the afternoon 
for nearly two· hours. 
No meeting will be held Tues­day because it is a religious holiday. But the parliament will meet again Wednesday to con­tinue the debate. Like today's meetings, it will be a special session since the regular meeting days are Sunday, Tuesday and Thursdav. 
"It is O'er clear when a decision will be reached on the hostage issue," a spokesman at the public relations office of the Majlis said before the mornin_g session. 
Tehran  Radio  reported  the  
Ma jlis  also  discussed  the  war  
between Iran and  Iraq  at  the  
morning meeting.  

Two factors appeared to be extending the debate, which some reports had suggested would be resolved in a single day. One was the wave of optimistic rumors from the United States of imminent release for the hos­tages, which a Tehran radio broadcast today implied was a form of pressure on Iran. 
The other was Iran's battlefield losses to Iraq in the 36-day-old Persian Gulf war. Iranian offi­cials have accused the United States of sidi'1g with Iraq in the conflict. 
proposal, the move to transfer the power of the largely inef­fectual Campus Life Council to the new Senate was choked offby the Student Affairs Committee at its meeting Thursday, Oct. 16. 
The Committee recom­mended to Riehle instead that he "revitalize" the CLC through a revision of its constitution, but Riehle's move to bypass the CLC with the Student Senate is now apparently dead. 
Student Affairs Committee ChairmanJohnA. Schneider told Riehle he felt that having the Senate make proposals to a group (the CLC) instead of one individual (the Vice President for Student Affairs) would alleviate the pressure that Riehle's pro­posal would cause. The com­mittee said the pressure of having one body which repre­sents 8,000 students proposing to one man could create bad rapport between students and the administration. 
Riehle was dejected that the Committee rejected a proposal which had such overwhelming student backing, but pointedout that the Committee encouraged him to make changes in the CLC constitution, and they asked him to report to aJanuary meeting of 
the Executive Board, something 
he termed a "majorconce:.;sion." 
But Riehle's "management of dissent," as committee member Jane Cahill Pfeiffer called it, now takes on a different structure from the one he had envisioned, and the students ratified, before the meeting. As it now stands, the newly created Student Sen­ate will make proposals to the CLC, which then makes pro­posals to Fr. Van Wolvlear, the vice presidert t for student affairs. 
The principal complaint with the CLC, which Riehle's admin­istration has ignored this year, is that having Van Wolvlear and other Administration members on a board which then reports to those same peoplt: is sel~ de­feating, or"redundant" as Riehle called it. Therefore, if Riehle harbors any hopes for change, he now can only accomplish· it through a change in the CLC. 
Riehle says he will "take apart the CLC constitution the same way we took apart the Student Government constitution," but whether or not that means elim­ination of Administration mem­bers has not yet been deter­mined.

Iran lost contactwith its embattled port city of Khorramshahr yesterday while Iraqi infantry and armored columns fought a fierce battle for the bridge leading to Iran's giant refining center at Abadan, war communiques reported. Iran acknowledged for the first time that Iraqi tanks and infantry platoons had made their way around Abadan and that the city faced assaults from the south as well as the north. "In spite of their inferior military equipment, the Iranian forces are resisting the enemy," Tehran radio said in a dispatch that detailed fighting on and around the strategic bridge that links Khorramshahr with the road to Abadan, 10 miles to the south. The span is located immediately south ofKhorramshahr, which the Iraqis claimed they seized Friday. Iran denied the city had fallen, but late Sunday Iran's Prime Minister Mohammad Ali Rajai said the situation at the port city was "critical."-AP 
The Metropolitan Opera orchestra 
voted overwhelmingly yesterday to accept a new four-year contract, and the nation's top labor mediator worked to reconcile the Met and its other employees in efforts to salvage the canceled 1980-81 season. The orchestra's vote was 78-11 for acceptance, with one abstention and six members absent, said Max L. Arons, president ofLocal802, American Federation of M~sicians. Arons said he hoped the remaining unions would qmckly approve their contracts to allow the Met's golden curtain to rise for a belated start of the opera's 97th season. In all, more than 1,900 unionized employees in 17 unions must approve new terms before a belated start of the season is possible. But accords were regarded as very close in most cases. ~rank M. Taplin, president ofthe Metropolitan OperaAssocia­tiOn, told reporters after an executive board meeting that the last management offer "constituted management acceptance of the I?usicians' terms." In addition to resolving the perfor­mance tssue, the settlement provided for pay increases totaling 34 percent over the four-year period and guaranteed labor peace during. the opera's centennial celebration in 1983. -AP

Of Politics and Practicality 
Editor's note: Frank LaGrotta's column regularly appears on the sports pages of The Observer. Today, however, LaGrottaparts with thefield ofsport to comment on the current presidential campaign. 
Up until last Monday, October 20, I had never seen a U.S. President. I mean for real, up close, in the flesh, with nothing between him and me except the air, 300 Secret Service men, twice as many reporters and photographers, as well as every city, county and state policeman on the payroll. 
So, when it was announced that Jimmy Carter would make a campaign stop in my hometown of Beaver Falls, Pa., I made plans to get there early and witness the first presidential visit in the history of the city. 

"You're getting up at what time?!" my friend asked warily when I called to ask him to ac­company me. . "Six o'clock," I repeated. "He's arriving in Beaver Falls at 9:30 and.... " 
"You're getting up at six o'clock to seeJimmy Carter?!" he interrupted. "I wouldn't get up at six o'clock to seeJimmy Carter if he were coming to my house for breakfast!" 
And he hung up. My friend is a Republican and one of many Americans (including myself) who wouldn't vote for Carter if he were running unopposed. But that wasn't the principle of the matter. I wanted to see a president and, un­fortunately, Carter was the only thing available. 
So there I was: 7:30 on a Monday morning, shivering on the corner of 13th Street in down­town Beaver Falls, waiting to catcha glimpse ofthe President. He was scheduled to make a short speech. Interest groups and party workers were outen masse. Signs and banners were mixed in their support for the President. 
Since Beaver Falls is a town that depends heavilv on the production of steel, many of the loc~l steelworkers came to voice their concern about issues affecting the working man-especially unemplovment.
A march scheduled by the local steelworkers union to show support for the President had practically fizzled. Instead of the expected 3000 marchers, barely 200 showed up. 
"The union tells us to vote for Carter," griped one angry, unemployed steelworker. "That's be­cause the guys upstairs got their jobs. They're drawin' a paycheck. I got four kids, a wife and a hell of a big mortgage. I worked 27 years on the same job in the same mill. Then, two months ago they come and tell me they're shuttin' down. They tell you they're sorry and they don't need you any­more. Well, what the hell am I supposed to do? A hundred-fifty bucks a week (his unemployment compensation) don't go too far these days." 
I asked him if he was blaming the President. 
"Blamin' him?" he smiled. "I guess you can't say he did anything to really cause it. But he ain't done a damn thing to help us. Maybe I can't blame him, but I sure ain't voting for him either!"

At 9:4 5 the sirens started and the President's motorcade approached. He rode by quickly, standing through the opened roof ofa limousine, flanked by hundreds of men with wires running from their coats to their ears-all staring blankly ahead. Carter's patented smile was radiant; how­ever the welco·me he received from a traditionally Democratic constituency was, at best, lukewarm. 
"I'm glad to be here in Beaver Falls," he told the 
crowd. "I always save the beststops on the road for 
last." 

(No applause-he tried again.) 
"My mother told me to be sure and tell you that 
she's a big fan ofJoe Namath." (Namath was born 
and raised in Beaver Falls.) 

(Thunderous applause-for Namath.) 
Then he proceeded to reel offhis litany of"Bad 
things Ronald Reagan has said and done and will 
say and do tf elected." 

"We can't take the chance and vote for Reaga:1!" 
he proclaimed.  
"Why not?" muttered an elderly woman 
standing next to me. · 

"What the hell has Carter done for this 
country?" she demanded. "People aren't working 
and even the ones that are can't afford the cost of 
living." 

I asked her ifshe was blaming President Carter. 
"Well...yeah, I guess I am," she said. "After all, he's been president for four years and everything, both in this country and in foreign countries, has gotten worse. I can't think ofone good thing he's done. If I were a businessman and had the choice between hiring a guy who worked for me and had done a terrible job for four years or taking a chance on a new guy who mightbe just as bad but might be better, I'd take the chance. I think that's what the people have to do. Take a chance." 
But look, I told her, at all the people here supporting Carter. · 
"They aren't here because they're gonna vote for him," she assured me. "They're here because they wanted to see him. After all, he is the President." 
When Carter finished and the crowd dispersed I heard two men talking. 
"He didn't say much," said one man. 
"Ah, whatta you expect?" said the other, "He's just a politician." "But he's the President," argued the first. "Too bad, huh?" "Well, maybe. Anyway, it's time to get back to 
work." "Nah, not me. Plant shut down two weeks ago. I'm loafin'."

guage, so that when you see it, it's tremendously identifiable and impressionistic. It uses devices that will remove it from the norm of straightforward newspaper story. 
Q: Which writers would be good examples of New Journalism? 
A: Norman Mailer in The Stepsof the Pentagon and Armies of the Night. Tom Wolfe himself, of course. 
Q: How did New journalism develop? 
A: I don't really know...I guess Mr. Wolfe popularized it. There was a sort of journalism called Gonzo journalism which was Hunter Thompson. I'm much closer to those cats. Hunter Thompson wrote a book called Hells' Angels in which he joined the Hells' Angels. That's sup­posed to be a pure example of macho, Gonzo journalism in which you worked hard for a different approach. 
Q: You were intimately associated with the 1968 presidential campaignofBobby Kennedy. Compare that cam­paign with the current one. 
A: The huge difference was that the (Vietnam) war was going on and the whole country was in huge turmoil... really rent by the war. In this campaign the divi­sions stem from economic prob­lems, but are not anything like then. Campuses were in a storm and racial problems were much more difficult than they are now. There was a terrific division in the Democratic party and of course, that campaign was car­
ried on with s\ich a different intensity, the issues drawn so vividly. It seemed to me to be a campaign which the whole coun­try was into, while this one is more of beauty campaign they are not really interested in. 
Q: How do Bobby and Teddy Kennedy compare personally? 
A: Teddy is a very confusing figure. I used to follow him around and listen to him speak and sometimes I thought he was very, very poor. Hewouldsortof lose interest and his sentences would wander around. A high school valedictorian was often better. Then, all ofa sudden, the last part of the campaign he really began to be ratherwonder­ful and that speech of his at the convention was unbelievably good. It was everything Teddy can be. He's the most charming of the Kennedys, the best poli­tician, the hardest working, has the best aptitudes, knows the political system wonderfully well, and has an absolute trap of a mind. Yet, there is something that Bobbv had, for all of his awkwardness, his lack of patience, restlessness with those he didn't think much of, disinter­est in political niceties, which made him a more formidable

(Contimu:dfrom paKe 1) 
The committee meeting extended one-and-a-half hours over the allotted time, and Riehle quoted one ofthe trustees as saying "it was the best meeting we've ever had." 
Schneider then consolidated the student requests and pre­sented them to the Executive Board of Trustees at their bi­
. annual meeting the following day. Riehle said that no student representative was allowed at this meeting, which Riehle plans to protest at the next Board meeting in April, but from the 
Trustees  he  spoke  with  he  
learned that "our position  was  
presented.  accurately  and  lis­ 
tened to attentively."  
Traditionally,  students  are  

only allowed input at the Octo­ber and April board meetings, when thev are able to meet with the Stud~nt Affairs Committee only, Riehle said. He expressed a desire to change this policy, and said that to his knowledge this will be the first instance where a student will serve as a repre­sentative to the Executive 
'Board. 
Schneider was allotted 15 minutes to report on the com­mittee meeting, but actually took 25 minutes. Riehle said the extra time given tb this matter at both meetings reflects the Committee's interest in student concerns. He was pleased with theBoard's reception andsaid, "I think we've got some momen­tum going." 
Regarding the campus social space issue, Riehle said that Don Murday, executive coordinator for Student Government, Rich Coppola, Student Union direc­tor, and he plan to meet with Fr. Van Wolvlear sometime Wed­nesday to work out specifics for the new "hangout" on campus. 
The group would then meet with Vice-President for Business Affairs Thomas Mason and Director of Physical Plant Donald Dedrick for further de­finite action. Riehle hoped this would take place by the end of this week. 
The Student Affairs Commit­tee was also "verv interested" in the off-campus situation, Riehle said. Off-Campus Commissioner Mark Kelley offered the Com­mittee no concrete solutions to off-campus problems, but said he just wanted to make the Board aware that problems exist. Ac­cording to Kelley, the actual changes involve the University and the city, not the Board.

The student representative is elected through the same pro­cess as are the other members of the Board. She does not serve as a voice for the student body, but instead offers a student's opinion on matters pertaining to the Board. 
Other points of business on the agenda included resolutions, presented by Sr. M. Bertrand Sullivan, pertaining to the finan­cing and construction of the library. These resolutions had been approved by the Admin­is~rative ~embers of the Corpor­attOn earher in the year and were endorsed by the Board. The library is being financed by the sale of tax-free bonds. A total of $6.7 million will be needed to subsidize the library, and $3.3 million has been raised so far. 
Resolutions of appreciation were also approved for faculty members, Rita Cassidy, Grace Sullivan McGuire and Sylvia Dworski, who retired in May, and also for the Sisters of the Holy Cross who returned $190,083 to the College in the year 1979-80. 
The audit report for 1979-80 was accepted, and percentage in­creases in fees and compensa­tion, as a basis for preparing the 1981-82 budget, were approved. A final review of the changes and compensation adjustments will be presented to the Board at its next meeting in mid-February. 
The Board also approved the newly revised manual ofpolicies and procedures for hourly em­ployees, as well as the reports of the Committee on Developme11t and Student Life._ 
Also at the meeting, the Committee on Education as­
' 
sisted by Dr. William Hickey and Dr. Donald Horning, presented an explanation of the process and procedure for granting ten­ure at Saint Mary's. 
In an executive session, Sr. Margaret Michael, chairman of the Committee to Evaluate the President, presented the final report, ~hich was positive, to the committee. 
The Board also attended the ground breaking ceremony for the library. Due to rainy weather the ceremony was held in Stapleton Lou~ge.

Fr. Conyers said the quickness and efficiency of Notre Dame, Security was responsible for the apprehension of the suspects. "I think they didan excellent job. They were on the scene immediately." 
Two unrelated off-campus crimes also occurred during the week. Gary Ainge of 707 W. Colfax Street reported that his car was vandalized at the South Shore station while he was in Chicago on October 22. He returned home only to find that his house had been burglarized as'. well. 
"It was a very bad day on all accounts," he remarked. Losses ofthe day included a stereo amp, speaker, tel~vision, and battery from his car. 
Also, a St. Louis Street resident reported aburglary on Oct. 25. The student said that thieves entered through a window and stole two sportcoats and other miscellaneous items. 
When asked for a comment on the recent crime wave at the University, the police spokesman said, "I certainly hope you don't have any breaks scheduled for the near future." University officials may very well second that feeling.

PUTNAM, Conn. -When Johnny Carson gets bleeped on the "Tonight Show" by the NBC censor, Mark Kulaga and Portus Barlow III don't have to read lips to know what he said. 
'Part of the glamour of this is to watch things you are not supposed to see," Barlow said. 
Kulaga and Barlow own a com­pany called Black and White En­terprises Ltd., among about a dozen companies in the United States that have jumped into the "earth station" market. 
Home earth stations-antenna, receiver and amplifier-are scaled down versions of the re­ceiving systems cable TV com­panies use. But while cable com­panies primarily use just one satellite and provide an average of a dozen channels, home earth stations can catch signals from any of the satellites, which serve more than 50 channels. 
The technology involved is not new. What is new is the price­it's now within reach of the con­sumer. 
there anything you haven't done that you um"ld really like to? 
A: I'd like to sing with a rock group, maybe KISS. I've also always wanted to sing in the opera, which of course, went on strike recently. 
Q: Some skeptics sayyou were some­what crazy to do all the partiCipatory reportingyou have done. What reply do you make to these skeptics? 
A: I try to do these things as a reporting exercise that has been done by Paul Gallagher and several others... they've quit, I must say, and I seem to be still doing them. There'sa public that rather expects them to be done and wants to read what these hockey teams are like and what the tennis tour is like. I don't know that it's the best way of doing it, obviously there are many ways of skinning a cat, but it gives me pleasue. Crazy? I sup­pose a little, but notas crazy as ifl didn't write books about it, then I really would be crazy.

In an election year where there is no ideal candidate, The Oh.rert,er endorses Illinois Congressman John-Anderson for President. Throughout the marathon contest, which began for some candidates two years ago, Anderson has consistently presented the most imaginative and, at the same time responsi­ble, ideas to solve this nation's diverse and complex problems. 
Unlike· incumbent President Jimmy Carter, Anderson has utmpaigned openly and at length. Unlike Republican nominee Konald Reagan, Anderson has formulated his economic and social policies so that they respect the rights of all social and economic classes. And unlike either of the other two major candidates, Anderson has successfully welded the best of liberalism and moderation into an effective and fresh approach to the American Presidency. 
On economic matters, Anderson has presented a sensible program ofa voiding a tax cut without a simultaneous reduction in government spending. This position is in marked contrast to Reagan's plan to grant a large tax cut while at the same time increasing the defense budget. This policy is in even greater contrast to Carter's constant shifting from a "tax cut" position to a "no tax cut" position as the political winds dictate. 
Anderson's 50-5o energy tax rebate plan is by no means perfect, but i.s the energy plan which is the fairest to all Americans. This plank in Anderson's platform would reduce gasoline consumption and encourage conservation. Anderson's provision to extend a fifty percent rebate from the ·new tax in the form of Social Security benefits, would both aid that segment ofthe population which needs the money most, as well as help bolster the struggling Social Security System. This approach is much preferred to candidate Reagan's policy of leaving America's oil companies to dictate this nation's energy future. 
The build-up ofconventional forces and the improvement of our volunteer army highlight Anderson's defense policy. In these times of political tension abroad, it is easy to propose a reactionary policy ofsending American troops to obscure spots around the globe. It is also easy to propose the implementation of new and expensive arms systems. Candidate Reagan has espoused both of these alternatives, and both seem to lead America to a road this nation has gone down before. Reagan's plan to send American troops around the world at seemingly the slightest whim could be the first step towards embroiling America in another undeclared war. His plan to build costly weapons systems contradicts his avowed opposition to icreased government spending and would succeed only in involving this countrv in a"cold war" situation. President Carter has had his chance. at forming America's policy and providing for its defense. In The Ob.rerver's opinion he has bungled that chance. Carter has successfully diminished our credibility abroad, and persisted in taking an inconsistent course in affairs abroad so that neither our allies nor our adversaries know where we stand. He does not deserve a second chance. 
Besides these reasonable positions on America's most press­ing problems, Anderson is more open-minded when compared with the other two candidates on social issues. Anderson is a strong proponent of the Equal Rights Amendment. He is opposed to a C-onstitutional amendment on abortion, but favors giving the woman involved the option to make her own decision. He is also a supporter of gun control. 
\, 
) 
Finally. Tbe Q_b.rerver backsJohn Anderson for the Presidency :)ecause of his realistic but optimistic approach to government. ~ ·arter is nothing ifnot a realist, but his blunders these past four 'ears have bred an air of defeatism and a lack ofconfidence in this country which threatens its future. Reagan presents an :dt~alistic but ultimately misguided approach to solving this :1,1tion's problems. His solutions are "quick fix" answers to problt::ms which require time-consuming and innovative solu­tions. His policies are more a nostalgic longing for the America of the Fifties than a coherent blue-print for an America with tangible problems in the Eighties. Anderson's blend of liberal idealism and moderate conservatism is the best mix to deal with those problems.

Box Q, Notre Dame, IN 465.56 

Dear Editor, 
In a recent interview in The Observer congressional candi­date John Hiler cited the experience of Puerto Rico as evtdence proving that tax cuts along the lines advocated by the Kemp-Roth Bill will lead to increased tax revenues from economic growth stimulated by those tax cuts. In reviewing the candidate's defense-of the Kemp-Roth plan, however, one finds that the evidence pre­sented is unconvincing and the use of it deceptive. 
In his reference to the exper­ience of Puerto Rico Mr. Hiler fails to say that while personal income taxes have been re­duced, increased taxes on for­
. . . . 
etgn co9_)oranons operanng m Puerto Rtco have directly offset those tax cuts. This combined with increases in indirect tax revenues show anyone who cares to look at the facts that the Kemp-Roth plan has not been vindicated. 
Later in his argument Mr. Hiler states that 100,000 tax­payers have been added to the tax rolls in Puerto Rico, the implication being that because of tax policy the number of jobs in the economy has increased by 100,000. Yet in the period in question employment m Puerto Rico increased by 25,000. That and the fact that total employ­ment in the economy is only 825,000 makes one wonder what the candidate is up to. 
To sum up, the defense of the Kemp-Roth Bill wasn't much of a defense at all and involved a clear misuse of the facts. One wonders what other such abuses fill the candidate's speeches, literature, and com­mercials. I can only say that for myself I see this candidate as not only a disciple of "voodoo economics'' but of ''voodoo statistics" as well.

Neely nailed on trivia error 
Dear Editor, 
I would like to point out a mistake in reference to Mr. Neely's Oct. 9, Rock Trivia quiz. Mr. Neely states that "Wonderwall Music" by George Harrison is the first solo Beatles album, being the soundtrack to a movie of the same name. Unfortunately, this is incorrect. The first Beatles solo effort was actually recorded by Paul McCartney at least one year prior to Harri­son. After the Beatles finished I suggest that Mr. Neely recheck his sources or he shall 
never  receive  a  "correct"  
entry.

Father Toohey not soon forgotten 
Dear Editor, 
Recently, the Notre Dame/ Saint Mary's community said good-bye to one of its most devoted and dynamic priests, Fr. Bill Toohey. As I sat in Sacred Heart Church waiting for the funeral to begin, I was struck by the fact that the over 3000 people wh() crowded into the church were only a fraction of the lives that Bill had touched. During his lifetime, Bill's ministry reached thou­sands of people, from his closest friends in Campus Min­istry to the students who once heard him lecture in class, or attended one or two of his masses. All felt that they knew him in some way, for few who heard him preach ever came away unaffected. It is fitting that Bill would leave us with a source of comfort and strength in his last homily, an almost

t~e right words for the occa­ston. 
In the last couple of weeks, I've been wondering why it was so difficult for me to believe that he was really dead. Bill was just not the kind of person who I thought could ever die; it seemed as if he would always be a part of Notre Dame. He lives on in every one of the thousands o people whose lives he touched, and his ministry will continue on long after all our wounds of griefhave healed. Although his physical presence will no long­er be among us, we need only to look within ourselves and the people around us to see the little part of himself that Bill instilled within us all. 
We will, of course, miss him a great deal, for he was loved by many, although I don't think he knew how very many. Yet, even in our sorrow, we must try to forget his death, and concentrate instead on his life, a life filled with under­standing, compassion, and an "urgency to preach the Gospel," as Father McNally so beautifully stated in his eulogy. 
If we remember his life and the lessons he taught us, then Bill Toohey will live among us, forever. For, as he once stated, "Death, hate and despair will nor have the last word.''

Saint Mary's .triumphs in tourney 
by Kelly Sullivan Women's Sports Editor 
With emotions running high for both clubs, an aggressive Saint Mary's volleyball team beat a spirited Notre Dame squad yesterday in a tri-match that also included Taylor University. It was the second time the Belles have downed the Irish this sea­son, winning in straight sets last night 15-6, 15-4. 
"We had a definite advan­tage," explained St. Mary's coach Erin Murphy. "Beating them earlier this year helped us. We knew we had done it, so we knew we could do it again. We didn't have to overcome that doubt ng about whether we were capable of winning." 
Aside from the psychological edge, another big plus for the Belles was the return of co­captain Marianne Viola, one of the team's best spikers. The sophomore attacker sustained a broken thumb in the Belles' sea­son openerand has only resumed play this weekend. 
"Marianne's become a better competitor since her injury," said Murphy. "After watching us from the bench the last couple of weeks she seems to know exactly where she's needed now." 
Irish coach Sandy Vanslager pinpointed her club's problems versus St. Mary's. "Our number one problem was our lack of communication on the court. We played well, but it was the 
minor  errors  that lost  us  the  
match.  We  missed  too  many  
serves,  and  that's  like  giving  

points away." 
In the night's opening contest, Notre Dame lost to Taylor in a full three-game match. After lo­sing the first clash 15-1 3, the visiting Trojans grabbed the mer mentum in the second game and defeated the Irish 15-8. Taylor went on to score 13 unanswered points in the deciding game as they blasted their way to a 15-2 victory to capture the match. 
The battle pitting St. Mary's against Taylor saw the Belles come from behind in the first and third games to down the Trojans 15-8, 15-17, 15-8. In that final game, St. Mary's lost three match points but managed to hold on for a win that upped their ledger to 10-8. They will travel to Go­shen for a match on Wednesday.

In addition to his many Moeller duties, the 45-year-old Faust has found time to tour 38 states as a highly-acclaimed lec­turer. "It would be like someone going from governor to presi­dent," says Faust ofa high school to college switch. "If you have the capabilities, the previous level doesn't matter." Faust began his football career as a quarterback for his father, Fuzzy, at Chaminade High School.

Soccer squad 
splits 2-2 
over break 
by Gary Grassey Sports Wrtler 

SOUTH ORANGE, N.J.-It is getting a bit redundant for Notre Dame soccer coach Rich Hunter, but the pattern con­tinues. 
After beginning their second annual Eastern swing with a gallant performance against the ninth-ranked Nittany Lions of Penn State University last Sun­day in State College, PA-a 4-2 Irish defeat-the Notre Dame soccer team turned around two days later and fell flat on its face at the hands of tiny Monmouth College, by a 2-0 count. The trip concluded with victories over Upsala and Seton Hall, 1-0 and 2­0, respectively. The Irish record now stands at 16-6. 
"Monmouth was the most hu­miliating thing this year," said a frustrated Hunter of the lack­luster loss to a squad that had entered the game with a meager 5-7 won-lost mark. "I really don't know howitisthatwecan play so well against the ninth team in the nation (Penn State) and the sec­ond team in the nation (Indiana threeweeks earlier) and then lose to Monmouth. It was just hu­miliating-even the kids used that word to describe it." 
The remainder of the trip added two victories to the Irish ledger, but they were not exactly works of art, either. 
"We played better," said Hunter after the Seton Hall game~ "But I can't say we played well. We should have had about eight goals against these guys." 
The Pirates had entered the 
game with a dismal 1-8 record. 
"It was the same thing with 

Monmouth, Upsala, and Seton 'Hall," remarked senior c~cap­tain 0 liver Franklin. "They all played the best game they've ever played and we just played at 
their level of competition." 
Against Seton Hall, the Irish 

were held to a scoreless tie at the 
half. Two crucial stops by goalie 
Bob Ritger, starting his first 
game in two years for Notre 
Dame, prevented Pirate halfback 
Mike Curci from putting the 
Irish in an early hole. 
Before the match deteriorated 

into a second half fist-fight, 
Notre Dame's top goal-getter, 
Kevin Lovejoy, ended the sus­
pense at 48:35 when he lofted a 
chip shot into the far cornerfrom

20 yards out on the left side. Bill 
Murphy's assist on the play was 
his first point of an injury­
plagued senior year. 
The outcome remained in doubt, however, as the Irish continually botched scoring op­portunities and gave Seton Hall more chances than their limited skills merited. But with two min­utes to play, Notre Dame for­ward Ed O'Malley was assaulted by a Pirate defender and awarded a penalty kick. When Seton Hall goalie Steve Mango decided the ball was placed too close to his net by the referee in lieu of the free boot, he was tossed out of the game. His replacement, f~ rward Tony Colavita, was in no shape to stop O'Malley's shot and the Irish walked away with their 2-0 victory. 
Notre Dame dominated Seton Hall in all statistical categories. The Irish outshot their opposi­tion 25-6. Goalie Ritger and his second half replacement Gerard McCarthy were forced to make only three saves. Pirate keeper Mango stopped six Irish shots, in an otherwise sloppy game that consisted of almost forty fouls. 
"I guess it's just difficult for us to get up for teams like Seton Hall and Monmouth after Penn State," theorized Hunter, "But we're gonna have to learn some­time." CORNER KICKS­.Freshman forward Rob Snyder scored the lone Irish goal in the Upsala victory on an assist from Mike Mai...Lovejoy and Mike Sullivan had goals against Penn State ... both came on assists from Dannie McCurrie... the Irish played the Lions to a 0-0 halftime standoff and trailed 3-2 until the final four minutes when State's Bob Waizenegger clinched it. .

Logan finished the weekend with three goals and two assists to lead the Irish while Poulin and Rothstein had two goals and two assists. McNamara, in addition to his superb defensive efforts, wound up with an assist. 
Coach Smith's club entertains Central Collegiate opponent Bowling Green tonight at 7:30 
p.m. in the Athletic and Convocation Center. Plenty of seats remain available for the Irish home opener. 
The Falcons finished with a 16­20-2 mark last year for a fourth place slot in the CCHA. In their only contest with Bowling Green last year the Irish finished on top, 5-2.

"I just told myself this week that I had to get better as a passer," he said with authority. "I went into this game with the attitude that I was going to con­centrate and do better. I need to continue improving, but I was pretty happy with my passing tonight." 
Kiel entered the contest with a skimpy . 360 completion percen­tage (18 of 50) for 179 yards. 
"Kiel's stats have been mis­leading," Devine said. "This was his fifth game, and tonight he threw his first interception. I don't worry about his stats any more than Dallas Green worries about Pete Rose's batting aver­age. They both do a lot of things that don't show up in the stats, like the run on the fake punt." 
Sophomore wide receiver Tony Hunter was another who enjoyed the best day ofhis Notre Dame career, catching seven pas­ses, most of them on short side­line patterns. "We ran a lot of12­yard outs," said Hunter, whose receptions covered 75 yards. "That's such a tough play to defend against. It was something that we picked up watching films 
. of their Washington State game (which Arizona lost, 38-14). We knew they were a little suscepti­ble to that." 
Hunter, who had just 13 recep­tions in the team's first five con­tests, added, "I really needed that 
_ kind of a game. It gave me some of the confidence I needed." Kiel's touchdown sprint, a one-yard scoring blast by Stone and a pair of field goals by Harry Oliver added up to Notre Dame's lowest offensive output of the season-20 points. Oh, but that defense .... It was a rough evening for freshman quarterback Tom Tunnicliffe and the Arizona of­fense. Tunnicliffe's completion percentage was impressive (15 of

The Irish defensive unit turned in its best effort of the 1980 campaign allowing just 71 yards on the ground and 166 overail. The Irish held their opponent without a touchdown for the second straight week. In fact, the Wildcats had not been held with­out a touchdown in 15 years. 
(In case you left for break early, Notre Dame beat visiting Army last Saturday, 30-3.) 
"We bent a little at times de­fensively," said Devine, "but we didn't give Arizona the big plays they're capable of making. And once the defense has gotten a little bit of a lead the past two weeks, it hasn't given up much of anything at all." 
The Wildcats were pretty hap­PY with their defensive showing. "I thought we made the big plays," said honors candidate free safety Dave Liggins. "And I thought it was definitely our best effort on defense in quite a while." 
However, Arizona's first-year coach Larry Smith found little consolation in his team's solid effort against the Irish. Sounding much like the late Vince Lombardi, Smith said, "I was proud ofthe whole team, but I'm damn tired of losing. Being proud isn't what counts. Win­ning is the whole thing." 

Gadg~t works 
by Michael Ortman Associate Sports Editor 
TUCSON, Ariz. -When a 
gadget play doesn't work, coach­
es will admit that you don't win 
games by fooling people. But 
when they work, trick plays can 
be the key to victory. 
Such was the case here Satur­
day night as Irish coach Dan 
Devine pulled a cleverly scouted 
fake punt out ofhis bag oftricks, 
triggering Notre Dame to a 20-3 
victory over Arizona. 
With just over two minutes to go in the first half and the Irish leading by only four points, Notre Dame punter and quarterback Blair Kiel stood on his own five yard line, a place where no one would expect a team to risk turn­ing the ball over, apparently ready to punt on fourth and five. 
Butafter the snap the Wildcats went one way and Kiel went the other, tucking the ball under his arm and racing down the left side for an 80-yard touchdown. The freshman needed just one block near midfield from fellow-rookie Daane Spielmaker on Arizona's Marcellus Green, and he was off to the races. The run was Notre Dame's longest play from scrim­mage this season. 
"That play turned the game around," said Arizona coach Larry Smith. "We were not in block coverage. We had the return on. The problem was that both our outside men went for the block instead of playing it smart. Their job is to be safety valves on the outside. 
"It was an excellent play on the part of Kiel. He just dodged the outside guy and that was it. Our other men had their backs to the play." 
But the Wildcats were not the only surprised players on the field. Except for Kiel, none of Devine's men knew it was coming. 
"There were only two people who knew about the fake punt," admitted Devine, "Blair Kiel and myself. It's something we talked about before thegame. Butl told Blair that I would send word in with the center ifwe would do it. Then I couldn't get to him (center Bill Siewe) in time." 
So just before the snap, Kiel looked over at Devine on the

Houst(... .. Astros President and General 
Manager Tal Smith, who rebuilt the team and led it to the National League Western Division championship, was fired yesterday and replaced by former New York Yankee President. AI Rosen. "Mr. Rosen replaces Mr. Talbot Smith whose contract was terminated in accordance with its terms," a tersely­worded statementsaid. The announcementwas made by John). McMullen, chairman and chiefexecutive officer ofthe Houston Sports Association, owners of the NL team. McMullen said in the statement that the Astros were required to inform Smith this year if they desired to sign a newcontract with him when the present agreement expired on November 30 of next year. McMullen refused to comment yesterday after the statement was distributed by messenger. Smith said he was surprised by the owner's action. "A person's performance is what normally prevails," Smith said. "Even though we came a run short of winning the National League pennant this year, I still think it was a very successful year for the Astros and this franchise." Rosen was not immediately available for comment. 
Ralph Houk, saying he missed "the fun and excitement" ofbaseball during two years in Florida retirement, returned yesterday by agreeing to a two-year contract as manager of the Boston Red Sox. "I'd also like to win one more pennant," Houk, 61, told an afternoon news conference. "Once you've been in baseball all your life like I've been, it's a little harder to leave than you think it is." Houk, who began 16 years as a major league manager by winning three American League pennants in a row in 1961-63 with the New York Yankees, retired after five years as field boss of the Detroit Tigers in 1978. -AP
