Trustees to choose president, set divestment policy Friday 
By MARK PANKOWSKI News Editor 
The day of decision is Friday. 
On that day, the N'otre Dame Board of Trustees will meet on campus to elect the next Uni­versity president, as well as decide whether or not to divest from firms doing business in South Africa. 
The successor to University President Father Theodore Hesburgh will be announced as soon as the trustees have acted, according to Richard Conklin, assistant vice president for University relations. The mat­ter is on the board's agenda for 2 p.m. Friday. 
The board's 10-member nominating committee, meeting at the Center for Con­tinuing Education, will vote Thursday on whom it will pro­pose to the board, said Conklin._ 
The full 49-member board will choose the new president the next day, in all likelihood electing the nominating com­mittee's choice. 
Before the board elects the new president, however, it will review Notre Dame's South African investment policy. 
The investment committee and the ad hoc committee on South Mrican investments will each meet Thursday, Conklin said. Either one or both may make a recommendation to the full board on whether to divest.

The Beaux Arts Ball drew a large number of last Friday, all of whom according to the Ball's strange creatures to the Architecture Building theme, "only come out at night." 
The board will decide the next morning on what action, if any, it will take on the mat­ter, Conklin said. 
Conklin declined to release the trustees' agenda. He did say, however, that besides the presidential selection and the divestment decision, "there isn't anything else· on (the agenda) of any consequence." 
Five Holy Cross priests have been mentioned as likely sue­cessors to Hesburgh, who has been president since 1952. 
They are: Father Edward "Monk" Malloy, associate provost; Father William Beauchamp, executive assis­tant to the president; Father Ernest Bartell, director of the Helen Kellogg Institute for In­ternational Studies; Father Mi­chael McCafferty, associate professor of law; and Father

Commons to close for 5 days, pay fine 
By CHRIS JULKA 
Copy Editor 

The Commons bar at 826 N. Eddy St. will pay a $1500 fine and close for five days, accor­ding to a settlement agreed 'upon Friday by Joseph Rabb, prosecutor for the Indiana Al­coholic Beverage Commission, and attorneys for the Com­mons. 
The fine and closing are scheduled to take effect after a 45-day period during which the bar's owner may appeal. 
The settlement follows In­
diana Excise Police charges of 
allowing minors to loiter in the 
tavern after the excise, South 
Bend and state police had con­
ducted a joint raid on the bar 
last Dec. 15. 

"We had a person at the-door every night, and we had to refuse entry to a lot of people," said Pasquale Anastasio, one of the owners of the Commons. "But some people have coun­terfeit !D's. They're very diffi­cult to detect." 
The penalty agreed to by the 
Commons owners is the same 
as was meted out in a similar 
case handled earlier, accor­
ding to Robert McNevin, an ABC hearing judge from In­dianapolis. 
"The under-aged with coun­terfeit ID's make us liable to the law," said Anastasio, when asked about the settlement. "I don't think it's fair, but the law is the law." 
Anastasio said The Com­mons would resort to new se­curity measures. "We will be consulting experts in security to better scrutinize !D's, so as to make it much more difficult for under-aged to gain entry,'' he said. 
Anastasio declined to iden­tify these experts, but said, "They _were highly recom­mended." 
"It's not good for business to have so much security," said Anastasio, when asked what he thought about the new measures. "But it's a neces­sary evil." 

Counterfeit !D's can be ob­tained from just about any place, including magazines and computers, according to Anastasio. He said, according to rumor a popular place is Pennsylvania. "Probably every underclassman can get

Survey names Hesburgh as the most effective president 
By MARK PANKOWSKI News Editor 
In a survey to identify the most effective college and uni­versity presidents, the name most often mentioned was Notre Dame President Father Theodore Hesbutgh. 
The survey was part of a two­year study designed by James Fisher, president emeritus of the Council for Advancement and Support of Education in ­Washington, D.C., ~nd Martha Tack, professor of educational administration and supervision at Bowling Green State Univer­sity. 
The purpose of the study, en­titled "The Effective Qollege President," is to determine whether those presidents considered effective are differ­ent from the ''typical or repre­sentative presidents," said Fis­her. If they are different, Fisher said, the study seeks to determine what makes them so. . 
As part of the research, Fis­her said he and Tack surveyed 485 individuals considered knowledgeable about higher education, including private foundation heads, higher-education scholars and randomly selected college and university presidents. 
The respondents were asked

Talks promote alcohol awareness 
By MARILYN BENCHIK Assistant Saint Mary's Editor 
"Think before you drink" is the slogan of Alcohol Aware­ness Week, sponsored by the Saint Mary's Alcohol Educa­tion Council. 
Events for the week, which begin today and run through Thursday, include today's program, "Before Drinking . . . Start Thinking.'' This pro­gram examines the physio­logical effects of alcohol on the body. Lecture topics also include preparing yourself for the evening out, sobering yourself up in a drinking en­vironment and knowing what to do with a drunk friend. 
Wednesday's program, "Someone I Know. Drinks Too Much," features a ·panel of speakers from Alcoholics Anonymous and Al-Anon, a self-help group for people troubled by another's drink­ing, who will talk about the influence of alcohol on their lives. 
"The Effect of Alcohol on the Saint Mary's Communi­ty" will be discussed by a panel of students and faculty Thursday. 
Each lecture will begin at 7 
p.m. and last until 8 p.m. in the LeMans lobby. 
According to a statement issued by Patricia Ris­smeyer, advisor to the group, the four goals of the week are the following: to stimulate thought and discussion about alcohol consumption on campus and at home; to pro­vide information about the physiological effects of alco­hol; to help participants recognize problem drinking in themselves, friends and families; to introduce people experiencing problems related.to alcohol to the local and national support systems available, the Saint Mary's College Education Council consultant, Alcoholics Anonymous and Al-Anon. 
"We want to stimulate dis­cussion on alcohol consump­tion," said Rissmeyer. 
"One of the concerns we

Automatic "super-hero"toys stifle creativity of child's play 
"Things were always better when I was a 
child" is a phrase all of us have heard, usually 
muttered by a parent or grandparent in refer­
ence to the latest fashion trend or rock idol of 
the younger generation. 
Since I personally hated these "When I was 
young" sermons, I had always assured myself 
that I would never annoy those younger than 
myself with such reminiscent naysaying, at 
least until I was comfortably middle-aged. 
But, perhaps because of the fast approach of 
my 22nd birthday (or more probably the fact 
that I .happened to be browsing through the 
Chicago Tribune while frantically searching for 
a topic for this column) I now feel compelled 
to indulge in childhood nostalgia and bemoan 
the fate of the thousands of kids who will grow 
up playing with today's "toys." 
I remember (another phrase I once swore 
never to use) when I was young and Christmas 
lists were much less complicated. A "good 
haul" consisted of a nice, simple doll or two 
and a Candy Land game, with perhaps a set of 
Tinker Toys thrown in. These toys didn't move, 
light up, self-destruct, conquer, attack, or 
reproduce -they just sat there under the tree, 
waiting for a child's imagination to bring them 
to life. 
Not so today. Toys are electronic, transfor­
mable, beeping, flashing, exploding monsters, 
capable of waging a small-caliber war and cer­
tainly not demanding any creative input from 
the child (except perhaps a working knowledge 
of the latest defense strategerns). 
Simply page through any of the advertise­
ment inserts heralding the Christmas shopping 
season's arrival, and you will see an array of 
such toys falling into roughly three categories: 
military adventure toys, transformable toys, 
and just plain obnoxious toys (a category not 
necessarily exclusive of the first two). Here's 
a sample catalog quoted from Sunday's Chicago 
Tribune, with my favorites from each category 
thrown in for illustration. 
Military adventure toys 
Based upon the cartoons which pollute Sat­
urday morning programming, these toys ern­'phasize destruction and feature phaser­wielding "heroes" fighting supernatural creatures. Some of the most typical include: 
* Masters of the Universe "playsets," featur­ing "He-Man's Castle Grayskull or Fright Zone, horne of the Evil Horde." A friend tells me that this set has recently been enhanced with the charming Slime Castle, a structure that oozes 
· slime from the eye-sockets of a skull. 
* Thundercats Murnrn-ra's Tomb Fortress which includes such playful things as the "Murnrn-ra figure, Skull Altar, two Mutant statue guards. and good figures with battle­action motion." Transformable toys 
Perhaps due to the conservation trend, these toys pride themselves on being several things at once. Some of the most ridiculous are: 
* Transformers Special Team Mini-Vehicle 
Mary Heilmann 
Assistant News Editor 

assortment, including Aerialbots, Protectobots, Stunticons or Cornbaticons. These toys trans­form into robots and back again . . . never a dull moment here. 
* Hasbro Decepticon Trypticon (my personal favorite), which "transforms from city to battle station to walking dinosaur!" Entire genera­tions of kids will grow up believing that their town hall may one day be a tooth in the mouth of a brontosaurus. Obnoxious toys 
This category includes all of the above with one notable addition:· the Rambo Rocket Water Launcher, which "shoots water up to 30 feet!" and holds an entire quart of water for maximum bystander irritation. 
Even the more traditional toys have been "improved" to do more things and do them better. Dolls now have to include birth certif­icates and perform every natural bodily func­tion to be deemed worthwhile, even to the point of replying to the human voice. I spent a few undignified moments in a toy store recently talking to a doll who was supposed to respond with hugs and endearments. My attempts to elicit even a simple "hello," however, succeeded only in making me look very ridiculous -batteries weren't included. 
I guess some would argue that these toys are a progressive, natural outgrowth of a technologically-oriented society. They might even say that such gadgets are beneficial, pre­paring children for the types of electronic devices they will encounter later in life. 
I, howeve~ will take my Lite Brite, Legos and Mr. Potato Head and retreat into a time that allowed me to be a kid, to experiment with imagination and to indulge my creativity. Be­cause when I was young, toys really were bet­ter.

Hurley visits campus, is honored at brunch 
By MARY HEILMANN Assistant News Editor 
Former Notre Dame student Kevin Hurley was honored by the Class of 1989 for his "undy­ing courage and fighting spirit" at a brunch in South Dining Hall Sunday welcoming him back to campus. 
Hurley, visiting Notre Dame with his parents this weekend, was presented with a plaque by Sophomore Class President Pat Cooke, who called Hurley "an inspiration to us all." 
Hurley was struck by a hit­and-run driver on Sept. 7, 1985, when he was a Notre Dame freshman. He has been under­going rehabilitation since December 1985 and has received operations necessary to prepare his amputated leg for a prosthetic device. 
"I had surgery Aug. 1 and that was just to take part of my left shoulder muscle and loop it around the end of the stump. Everything since the operation seems great; I've really been working hard,"said Hurley. 
In order to prepare for an eventual return to Notre Dame as a student, Hurley said he has been sitting in on some classes in a private high school "to res­tock the memory banks." 
"Hopefully by next fall I'll be ready to come back to Notre Dame ... hopefully," Hurley said. 
Hurley and his parents came to South Bend for today's pre­sentencing hearing of Mary Beth Gallivan, a South Bend resident who pleaded guilty in connection with the accident. Hurley said his parents and lawyer will attend the hearing but added "I'm not about to go to that." 
Gallivan is scheduled for sen­tencing later this month.

In a Nov. 2 story, the Chicago Tribune reported that Malloy would be nominated and con­firmed as the next president. 
Contacted that same day, Malloy discounted the Tribune story, saying "it seems foolish for them to venture such a strong assertion when (the trustees) haven't voted on it." 
The Tribune stood by its story, however.

here. People don't think about 
it at all," she said. 
According to Rissmeyer, "This is not a prohibitionist ap­proach to alcohol; it's an edu­cational approach." 
Rissmeyer said the overall goal for the program is to rec­ognize problem drinking. 
"There are some people who are pre-disposed to alcoholism. Other people may not be al­coholic, but consuming alcohol may cause them some prob­lems. For example, not being able to get up in the morning because they're hung-over. 
"When (the student's) drink, they may get overly emotional, teary, and angry. They may say things they then later regret, and in the long run this could have a negative effect on their relationships with other people," said Rissmeyer. 
Problem-drinking is when other problems develop be­cause of alcoholic consump­tion, according to Rissmeyer. 
Rissmeyer said each workshop was planned by stu­dents, and there will be student presenters at each program. 
Chris Bodewes, member of the Alcohol Education Council, said, "We will talk about ways to promote responsible drink­ing on the campus." 
"We want to educate the wo­men of Saint Mary's on alcohol, its use, and its effects," Bodewes said. 
"My feeling about alcohol is: Let's think ahead and not be stupid about it. You should not not drink but take responsibil­ity for your choice to drink," she said. 
Bodewes said the organiza­tion started 10 years ago. This is the third Alcohol Awareness Week in three consecutive years. 
"The Alcohol Education Council consists of 13 students, and we all work together in a group effort," Bodewes said. 
"We're interested in other women at Saint Mary's who would like to meet with us and be involved with alcohol aware­ness on campus," she said. 
Rissmeyer is predicting a successful week. "We are hoping for a large turn-out. There will be probably between 30 to 80 students at each lec­ture. I'm sure it will be a great week, and I would encourage everyone to come to at least one of the lectures."

tion of apartheid from South Mrican society. 
In its May 9 meeting, the board modified this policy to demonstrate its willingness to divest completely under two circumstances. 
The board authorized total divestment if it believes U.S. companies "are not influenc­ing the dismantling of the sys­tem of apartheid," or if "cir­cumstances warrant this action because of further deterioration of conditions in South Africa." 
Since that May meeting, IBM, GM and Honeywell have announced they'll pull out of South Mrica. 
In addition, Coca-Cola Co. announced it would sell all of its holdings in South Mrica in protest of that country's policy of racial segregation. Donald Keough, chairman of the Board of Trustees, is the president of Coca-Cola Co.

Elections may be demise of 'Reagan revolution' 

Tuesday, Nov.4, 1986, is a day that shall live in infamy. The Reagan Revo­lution came to a grinding halt as the Democrats regained control of the Sen­ate. The move to restore sanity and traditional American values to the gov­ernment has stopped. Tax increases, government regulation, an end to aid to freedom fighters and the end of the realignment of the U.S. Supreme Court are but a few of the disastrous things that should be occuring within the next two years. 
Rich Coglianese 
the way we were 

With the Democrats in control of the committee chairs, they will be able to schedule when issues come up for votes. This does not bode well for Ronald Reagan or for the country in general. Let us take a look at the way the most vital Senate committees will look for the next two years. 
Joseph Biden (D-Del.) will take over the Judiciary Committee from Sen. Strom Thurmond <R-.S.C). This is a bad prospect for the reshaping of the federal judiciary and the Supreme Court in specific. With all of the games that the Democrats played with William Renquist, this will be a tough committee for the President. With Ren-
Auditorium use ends if drinking continues 
Dear Editor: 
Believe me, oh believe me when I tell you that I know how nasty a room full of stale beer cans can smell in the mor­ning. Well, that was the smell that greeted a certain professor at 8 a.m. in the Engineering Auditorium early last week. The cause? A mountain of empties left behind from the movies shown there over the weekend. Suffice it to say that the professor and several of the big guys under the dome are less than pleased. In fact, a clear message has been "sent down." If more evidence of drinking during the mpvies is found, the privilege of using the En­gineering Auditorium will be revoked. I think we all know how painful that 
Doonesbury 
quist being approved 66-33 and Daniel Manion (a good lawyer for whom Fa­ther Hesburgh wrote a letter of sup­port) being confirmed as a federal ap­pellate court judge by a 48-46 vote, it will be tough to put judges on the bench who want to interpret the law and not make it. Biden will do his best to grab the spotlight as he tries to get his presidential bid off the ground. And we must not forget Ted Kennedy's perfor­mance on the nomination of Renquist to the Supreme Court. Kennedy calling anybody extreme is truly a joke. One thing though, Mr. Kennedy, Chief Jus­tice Renquist is not as extreme on wo­men's issues as you are. The Chief Jus­tice believes that all women have a right to live. I wish I could say the same thing about you. 
Speaking of Kennedy, he will be taking over for Orrin Hatch <R-Utah) at Labor and Human Resources. It is unnecessary to say what type ~f big spender Kennedy is. He is very angry at the spending cuts that the White House was able to achieve in the last six years. I do not think that Kennedy has ever found a tax increase or social program that he did not like. It is once again time for the "master taxer" to set his program of fiscal and governmental irresponsibility loose on the American people. 
Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) will replace

could be. The last thing any of us want is the elimination of a social option around here. So? Well, I wouldn't call you a liar if you read my message as telling you to drink before and after, but not during the movies in the Engi­neering Auditorium. That's all for now from the Hall of Justice.

Jesse Helms <R-N.C.) as chairman of the Senate Agricultural Committee. The Agricultural Committee is vital since it sets farm policy. The Democrats on this committee will return to the failed policies of the past as they will force through the program of farm subsidies and paying farmers not to produce. This will lead to higher prices for food in the market place which will help to turn inflation loose once again. They will give farmers the hope that through subsidies they can turn the U.S. farm economy around. Instead, they will only give farmers the false hope that they can help. Not only will this policy hurt the farmers now but it will keep the farm economy from rebounding for years to come. 
Retiring Sen. Barry Goldwater <R­Ariz.) will turn over his chair fo Sam Nunn (D-Ga.). Although Nunn has fol­lowed a more conservative defense policy including suport for the Strategic Defense Initiative, he has been hesitant to support the large funding· that is nec­essary for SDI to be deployed. Nunn has worked very closely with Goldwater these last six years and is generally regarded to be one of the leading experts on Capitol Hill with regards to weapons and weapons sys­tems. 
Bob Packwood <R-Ore.) will be replaced at Finance by Lloyd Bensten . (D-Tex.). This will spell big trouble. 
formative, thought-provoking discussion. 
Like some people, we entered the dis­cussion with preconceived notions of what a feminist is, wondering if we could possibly fit into this category. The panel dispelled our misconceptions that the feminist movement encompasses only the radical extremists that are of­ten focused on in the movement. Feminism, however, embraces ·all types of people, men and women, liberals and conservatives. We learned from the discussion that, to many people, feminism is the belief that wo­men should have the equal opportunity to lead a life that fulfills their personal needs and goals; and our society should allow women to display those qualities which best exemplify them as human beings, whether it be through a career, motherhood or both. Our society ex­pects men to be more rational, more

Bensten and the Democrats will be able 
to use this post to make both tax in­
crease and protectionism look favor­
able to the American people. Mter years of responsible management, the finance committee will be used to help set up protectionist walls around Amer­ican shores. This will only hurt both American firms that export goods (in fact the very car industry that it is sup­posed to help) and will also be respon­sible for causing world wide recession. Protectionism is very dangerous and the President must do all that he can to avoid protectionist legislation from becoming law. 
Reagan, unfortunately, will have to extensively use his veto power over the lOOth Congress. It is unfortunate that the Reagan Revolution to restore tradi­tional American values has come to such a grinding halt. This just means that work must be done to insure that the Reagan Revolution, now experienc­ing just a temporary setback, will con­tinue long after Ronald Reagan leaves office in January of 1989. Although work· must be done, this is not an insurmount­able mountain that must be climbed. It is still possible to insure that the Reagan Revolution be continued long after Ronald Reagan.

intelligent and stronger than women. In turn, women should be nurturing, domestic and emotional. For feminists, however, the ability to nurture and show. emotions is not wrong, but qualities that can be shared by both sexes. 
Finally, we would like to challenge those who attended the discussion to spread the issue by generating con­versation among their friends, families and colleagues. The high attendance at the discussion clearly shows a desire to find out what "feminism" means. Again, thanks to the Women's Studies Committee and we hope to see more panel discussions and continued high attendance at the Women's Studies meetings to keep the interest alive.

SMC Around the World in a semester program 
Imagine climbing on the Great Wall of China and watching the sun set behind the Taj Mahal. Saint Mary's and Notre Dame stu­dents have this opportunity on the Saint Mary's Semester Around the World Program. 
The program runs every other fall and will be offered again in 1987. Students spend the majority of the semester in Madras, India but also travel to Toyko, Hong Kong; mainland China, Nepal; northern India and Thailand. Participants also have the opportunity to fly to Moscow or Western Europe before return­ing to the States. 
In Madras, female students study at Stella Maris College and male students at Loyola College, both private Catholic institutions affiliated with the University of Madras. Students are offered classes such as Indian culture, religion, art philosophy, history, politics, music and dance. Many educational field trips are also offered. Prior to this year the courses were only applicable as electives. Now, they fulfill core requirements and are credit toward a major. 
Most importantly, the Semes­ter Around the World Program ex­poses students to the entirely dif­ferent cultures of South Asia, the Far East and Southeast Asia. Saint Mary's student Mary LaSala, a former participant says learning about an un­familiar culture was the most rewarding part of her trip. "They don't even have Coke there," said LaSala. 

Today, many people are con­<:erned with safety abroad. LaSala said she felt very secure and never threatened. She found the people of Madras to be very peaceful. She spoke of an inci­dent when a beggar saved her from the harassment ofa ricksha driver. 
In the past students have had unique opportunities. In 198.3, the group had tea with Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. The stu­dents spent more than two hours in the prime minister's private study discussing political issues. In 1985, the group spent time with Mother Theresa in Calcutta. 
The cost of the program is the price of a semester's tuition at Saint Mary's plus $2500. The fee includes plane fare and all travel­
ing expenses. All accommoda­
tions are of excellent quality. 
Faculty advisor Dr. Cyriac Pul­lapilly ofSaint Mary's strongly en­courages students to participate, especially those at Notre Dame for whom the program has been recently opened. All credits transfer to both schools and-no foreign language is required. Students need to be well qualified and LaSala adds, "Ad­venturous and very accepting, not a whiner." 
Interested students should at­tend the Around the World Night on Nov. 14th from 6 to 8 p.m. at Saint Mary's Carroll Auditorium. Short movies and videos will be shown about the program, and Indian snacks will be served at a reception imme­diately following. Former partici­pants and professors who have traveled to India will be present to talk with students.

MiaiDi-Penn State duel still unclear 
Associated Press 10-0 and No. 6 Penn State 11-0. Notre Dame won the national If No. 1-ranked Miami and championship by defeating top­No. 2 Penn State remain un-· ranked Alabama 24-23 in the 
beaten, they will stage a national-championship shootout in either the Fiesta, Florida Citrus or Gator Bowls. 
Miami would like to play in the state of Florida for the home-field advantage. Penn State's preference apparently is the Fiesta Bowl at Tempe, Ariz. 
Since The Associated Press adopted the practice of voting for the national champion after the bowl games in 1968, only twice have two major indepen­dent teams gone through the regular season unbeaten and untied. 
It happened in 1973 when third-ranked Notre Dame was Sugar Bowl, while Penn State beat Louisiana State 16-9 in the Orange Bowl. 
In 1976, top-rated Pittsburgh and No. 17 Rutgers were 11-0. 
· Pitt wound up on top by defeat­ing Georgia 27-3 'in the Sugar Bowl, but Rutgers remained unbeaten, untied, uninvited and unelected, finishing No. 17. 
Miami and Penn State are 9-0 after the Hurricanes downed Pitt 37-10 and the Nittany Lions edged Maryland 17-15 Satur­day. Their national champion­ship showdown still is alive. 
Miami has home games against Tulsa on Nov. 15 and East Carolina on Nov. 27. Penn State visits Notre Dame next Saturday and plays Pitt at home Nov. 22, the official bowl selection date. 
The Fiesta, Florida Citrus and Gator bowls had represen­tatives with Miami and Penn State on Saturday and all three claimed they will be competi­tive money-wise with the Or­ange, Sugar and Cotton Bowls, which have conference tie-ups and can't invite both Miami and Penn State. 
"If all things were equal, we definitely would like to play in the Orange Bowl," Miami Ath­letic Director Sam Jankovich said. "That's our community, that's where our fans would be and it would be a very good thing for our program." 
But the Orange Bowl host team is the Big Eight cham­pion, so Miami and Penn State must look elsewhere. 

Volleyball
continuedfrom page 12 
In a grueling five-game match, the Irish skinned the 'Cats, 9-15, 15-11, 15-10,13-15, 15­
6. After losing game one, Wal­ler led the Irish to the second­game win with some excellent blocking. Waller continued to sparkle, and Zanette Bennett put away consecutive kills, amid the chants of "Z" to give the Irish a win in game three. 
The fourth game turned the crowd's excitement level up a notch from a fever pitch to a frenzy. Nqtre Dame seemed to be on its way to ending it in four games when it assumed a 12-9lead. But Northwestern put together an impressive string of points to claim a 14-12 lead, and finally took the victory, 15­13. 
But the Wildcats could not capitalize on any momentum their comeback may have given them. The fifth game, which should· have been the high point, turned into a rout as Northwestern made several costly errors. 
Waller led the Irish with 16 kills and a .433 kill percentage. Bennett was right behind with 15 kills, and Cunnigham added 
14. Taryn Collins, inserted as an outside hitter when Karen Sapp dislocated her knee cap, chipped in a career-high 10 kills. 
The Irish had little time to celebrate, however, as Pit­tsburgh came in yesterday, complete with a 24-9 record, a No. 10 ranking in the Midwest regional· and a possible NCAA bid in its future. Notre Dame lost the first game again, but came back to claim a four­game victory, 13-15, 15-10, 15­11, 15-10. . 
Lambert said he was pleased that the team was able to come back and play well enough to win, after an emotionally ex­hausting game the night before, something it couldn't do in this year's Hoosier Classic. 
"It was tough to come back today after last night's tough match," he said. "We couldn't do that in the tournament ear­lier this year when we beat In­diana, and then the next day against Purdue, we were still playing Indiana. We oeat that today." 
Lambert praised the block­~~g done by the Irish that thwarted the powerful attacks of the Panthers. Maureen Shea tallied six solo blocks to top the Irish. Kathleen Morin and Wal­ler added five blocking assists as well. 
The Irish now have captured 21 wins in their last 24 matches and are on the road Wednesday to face Illinois-Chicago. The weekend's success gives the team a better record than even Lambert, who characteristic­ally sets extremely high goals, had expected. In fact, he may have been only half-kidding when the beaming coach called the weekend, "one step for Notre Dame, one giant step for mankind." 
SIDE OUTS -Notre Dame has vaulted up to fifth in the Midwest Region in the Midwest Volleyball Magazine poll released this week. It was not rated in the top-20 prior to last week ... The magazine also lists the Irish as "the region's most improved team" ... Kathy Cun­ningham was selected as one of the region's top five fresh­men.

Soccer season ends on losing note 
By PETE. GEGEN Assistant Sports Editor 
Though it was not the storybook ending the Irish soc­cer team was looking for, Notre Dame ended an impressive season yesterday with a 2-0 loss to Evansville. 
The Irish finished with a 13­7-2 record, while the eighth­ranked Purple Aces improved to 17-2-2 on their way to the NCAA tournament. 
Under windy conditions the Irish came out strong, chal­lenging Evansville end to end. But the Aces took control mid­way through the first half, scoring the first goal of the match. 
Evansville forward Dan

-
McHugh was credited with the goal at the 27:45 mark when Irish wingback Bill Gross headed the ball into his own net. Keeper Hugh Breslin had hesitated on the play, and was caught out of the net when Gross, who had been bumped by McHugh, tried to head it back to ·his keeper. The ball slowly rolled over the line. 
"You can't let an own-goal happen against a team of that caliber," said Irish head coach Dennis Grace, who contended that Gross was pushed on the play. "It's just something that happens, unfortunately." 
Breslin, who recorded seven saves on the afternoon, made two excellent stops in the first half on shots by the Aces' Dan O'Donnell and Brian Adcock to keep Notre Dame close. 
Notre Dame finally opened up, recording four shots on goal in the first half. Forward Bruce "Tiger" McCourt just missed connecting off a throw-in late in the first half. 
"I was happy that they came out and tried to play," said Aces head coach Fred Schmalz. "So many teams have tried to pack it in against us, and then play the quick counter. They came out and they played soccer the length of the field." 
Evansville put more pres­sure on Notre Dame when midfielder Mike Mikes headed in a corner from O'Donnell to give the Aces a 2-0 lead at the 
66:18 mark. 
The Irish then inserted three forwards in an attempt to push the ball up the field, but they could only manage a single shot on goal against the Aces. 
"I thought we played hard, thought we played well," said Grace. "You have to recognize that Evansville is beating everyone in the country. They've been number one for eight or nine weeks, and jus­tifiably so. 
"They pressured us at mid­field. They didn't give us the

opportunity to do some of the things that we would like to do." 
The game finished what can honestly be called the best season of soccer at Notre Dame. But more than the up­sets and the superb play, the young Irish have developed into a unit which should be heard from in the future. 
"The thing that we did this year was come together," said Grace. "The willingness to work together is the number­one reason that got us to the level that we've been playing at the last eight games. 
"The year was a big success in a lot of ways. Every team we had more talent than, we beat. And we even beat some that had more talent than us. Previous years we had a ten­dency to beat ourselves." 
Despite all the accomplish­ments of the season, the team was upset that the year did not have the storybook ending.

because they really deserved for it to end a little better,'' said senior co-captain Jim Flynn. "You get sick of coming close, and that's really the way we were this year -we came close a lot. 
"The guys themselves were the ones that pulled together, and they're the ones out here playing hard every day. We have such a good team you can't do anything wrong as a captain."

Best season ends for Saint Mary's 
By GLORIA ELEUTERI Sports Writer 
The Saint Mary's volleyball team, 22-8, traveled to In­dianapolis for district play this past weekend. 
At IUPUI, the Belles were second-seeded in Northern In­diana, while ranked tied for first place in their league, and faced single-elimination play. Their hopes of reaching regionals, however, ended after a loss to Franklin College on Saturday. 
Friday night, Saint Mary's began the tournament with a victory over Marian College, with strong play on both offense and defense. It took the full five games to pull off the decision, 15-12, 15-11,8-15, 12-15 and 15-11. 
Leading the attack was senior Julie Schroeder with 26 
kills. Teammates Mary Reidy, The defense was doing an ex-

a senior, and freshman Tammy Suth added 18 and 17 kills, respectively. 
Schroeder also demonstrated powerful defense while leading the team with a total of 16 block assists during the match. 
"The team was able to adjust well to the difficult play of Marian," said Coach Mary Jo Lambert. "The girls pulled to­gether and kept any Marian rallies from amounting to anything dangerous." 
In the last five years, Saint Mary's had never advanced further than the first round of play at districts. This jinx ended Friday night and the team looked forward to facing its next opponent, Franklin Col­lege, on Saturday. 
During the season, the Belles lost to Franklin on two separate occasions.

side and raced over the goal line to extend Notre Dame's lead to 10 points. 
"The game plan worked great," said Beuerlein, who completed 11-of-20 in the pass­ing department. "It all starts with the offensive line and our ability to set up the running game. SMU has some talented defensive linemen in Jerry Ball and (Terence) Mann, but we controlled up there and, once we established the running game, we could keep them off­balance with the pass. 
"When I get protection like I got today it makes by job a whole lot easier. That's what happened today, and with Tim (Brown) and Milt (Jackson, two catches, 47 yards), if you get it in their hands, things are going to happen." 
While Beuerlein, Brown and the Notre Dame defense were toying with plays they called "almost perfect," placekicker John Carney put in a perfect day at the office -hitting field goals of 22, 30, 38 and 40 yards to tie the Notre Dame record of four field goals in a game. 
The Irish forced a pair of fumbles in the game while not turning the ball over. Watters was also intercepted twice, once by Troy Wilson and an­other time by freshman 
, linebacker Mike Stonebreaker, who totaled 10 tackles after senior captain Mike Kovaleski was sidelined early with a con­cussion. Kovaleski will play against Penn State on Saturday, Holtz said. 
EXTRA POINTS -Second­string quarterback Terry Andrysiak entered Saturday's game in the fourth quarter and led the second team into the endzone. The junior completed the only pass he attempted (24 yards) and finished the drive with a 20-yard touchdown scamper on his own ... Besides Brown, Johnson and Andrysiak, other members of the Notre Dame "I Scored a Touchdown" Club Saturday in­cluded Alonzo Jefferson (two­yard run), Pernell Taylor (seven-yard carry) and sopho­more Aaron Robb (one-yard run) cellent job in the first two games. The offense, however, was not able to penetrate, and the scores were 15-11 and 15-12 for Franklin. The play contin­ued in Franklin's favor as the Belles dropped a 15-9 decision in game three. 
Reidy contributed 15 kills and seven solo blocks in her final collegiate game. Mary McCarthy kept the Belles alive for a while with 12 defensive digs. 
''The team was not un­beatable if we could have pulled it together,'' said Reidy. "Our talent was there, we just did not play up to our potential. The loss was a hard one." 
Lambert felt this year's team had a lot of talent in compari­son to those in years past. 
"If we faced competitive teams like this more often in the season, then our level of 
play would be just as tough,"

Irish overpower Mustangs for third straight win 
Easy Notre Dame victory evens season record at 4-4 
By MARTY STRASEN Assistant Sports Editor 
Southern Methodist -came into Saturday's game at Notre Dame Stadium on probation for NCAA recruiting violations, but it was the Fighting Irish who took charge of handing out the punishment. 
Looking sharp in every phase of the game, Notre Dame made a 61-29 thrashing of the Mus­tangs appear easy, and ex­tended its winning streak to three games while hitting the .500 mark for the first time this season at 4-4. 
"We beat a good football team today, and we did it in a good, sound way," said Irish coach Lou Holtz, whose team rolled for 615 yards of total of­fense, the most by a Notre Dame team in the 1980's. "I couldn't believe when I looked up and saw how many points were on the board. 
"SMU looked as good on film as they did when they won the (Southwest Conference) cham­pionship (in 1982) and finished second in the country with Eric Dickerson, (Craig) James and (Lance) Mcilhenny." 
Unfortunately for the Ponies, none of those names were around on Saturday. A_nd while the struggling SMU squad dropped its third game in a row after an appearance in the na­tional rankings early in the season, the big names coming out of its latest loss were those of Steve Beuerlein and Tim Brown. 
Beuerlein had his best career passing game in a Notre Dame uniform, hooking up for 269 yards in the air, while Brown accounted for 235 all-purpose yards, including 176 yards on four receptions to go along with a pair of touchdowns. 
"It was a lot of fun out there today," said Brown, who

thoroughly enjoyed juking his defenders out of their socks vir­tually every time he touched the ball, once by breaking free from the coverage of Derrick Reed for an 84-yard scoring reception in the third quarter. "I'm starting to settle down and play like I know how to play." 
Two first-half touchdown runs by SMU's Jeff Atkins gave the Mustangs a 14-10 lead early, but a crucial 13 seconds in the second quarter, sparked by a big defensive play by defensive tackle Robert Banks, turned the game around for good. 
Anthony Johnson capped a 65­yard drive on a one-yard run with 8:46 on the clock, putting the Irish on top, 17-14. Then, after John Carney put the en­suing kickoff into the endzone for a touchback, the Notre Dame defense -came up with perhaps its biggest play of the game. 
Tight coverage in the second­ary forced Mustang quarter­back Bobby Watters to scramble around in the back­field, giving Banks enough time to shake his defender, send Watters to the ground and jar the football loose. Outside linebacker Cedric Figaro pounced on it at the SMU 15­yard line, recovering his seventh fumble in eight games and extending his Notre Dame record for fumble recoveries in a season. 
"It was close to a perfect play," Figaro said. "Everybody did what he was supposed to do." 
The next play was not far from perfect, either. In what is becoming more and more typi­cal in the Irish offense, Brown took a hand-off out of the wish­bone formation, followed a block from Johnson on the left

ND offense has record-setting day 
By ERIC SCHEUERMANN Sports Writer 
It was no ordinary afternoon for the Notre Dame offense. Sixty-one points and 615 total yards against SMU was definitely something special, as the Irish played what most would feel to be their best of­fense in many years. 
And, although the SMU defense is not one of the na­tion's best, this blowout was nothing to sneeze at. SMU had held teams such as Baylor and Houston in check, while barely falling to Texas and Texas of t.he Notre Dame offense ex­ploding. 
"SMU has great talent on defense," said Irish quarter­back Steve Beuerlein. "But the offensive line opened up holes to run and gave me great protection to pass. We just did what we wanted to do -almost every play went for positive yardage. It's a lot more fun when we're able to win and do what we did today." 
The 61 points scored by the Irish marked the most points scored in a single game by Notre Dame since a 69-14 win over Georgia Tech in 1977. More shockingly, 61 points are the most the Mustangs have al-

Records and opponents con­.tinue to tumble, and the list of casualties the Notre Dame vol­leyball team is leaving behind grows more impressive every day. 
This weekend, three more were added to the list. 
Victories over Dayton, Northwestern and Pittsburgh give the Irish a 25-6 record, in­cluding a school-record nine wins in a row. The 25 victories tie a school record set in 1982, and make Head Coach Art Lambert a very happy man. 
"I'm really pleased with the girls," he said. "I don't think we played all that well, but we scrapped and really . hung in there." 
The biggest weekend in 
Notre Dame history, according 
to Lambert, began with a three­game drubbing of North Star Conference foe Dayton by the scores of 15-8, 15-10, 15-2. Notre . Dame finishes with a 4-0 con­
ference mark. 
Mary Kay Waller and Kathy 
Cunningham took the night off, 
but the Irish suffered little. 
Sophomore Whitney Shewman 
led the Irish with 12 kills and 
middle blocker Maureen Shea, 
who would shine all weekend, 
added nine kills. 
Saturday night, Northwes­
tern provided the opposition 
and the standing-room-only 
crowd turned the auxiliary 
gym into a snake pit. The 
Wildcats have qualified for the 
NCAA tournament five out of 
the last six years, but they 
could not spoil Notre Dame's 
party.

lowed since 1916, when they fell to Baylor, 61-0. 
The 615 yards in total offense gained by the Irish was the best total for a Notre Dame squad during the 1980's. 
The Irish showed great bal­ance, gaining 322 yards on the ground and 293 through the air, for an average of 6.8 yards per play. And Notr.e Dame did not turn the ball over once, a statis­tic that best points out just how well the Irish executed. 
Beuerlein led the offensive charge, completing 11 of 20 passes for 269 yards, while throwing no interceptions. His
