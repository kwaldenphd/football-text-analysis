'Belles' of Saint Mary's sound out of tune to some 
Belle (bel) n. a pret~)' woman orgirl. 
Webster's definition may be generally accepted, but it doesn't tell the whole story. Unfortunately the word belle not only describes a pretty girl or woman, but also the name ofSaint Mary's athletic teams. 
Both Notre Dame and Saint Mary's can be accused of clinging to archaic ideas and stereotypes, most ofwhich students are well aware of. Saint Mary's, however, per­petuates traditional prejudices by hanging on to the nickname, "belle." Yet few have commented on this nickname, surely one of the most obsolete customs at Saint Mary's or Notre Dame. 
The word belle has absolutely nothing to do with ath­letics or Saint Mary's College in general. For most people the word belle conjures up images of Scarlett O'Hara lookalikes from down South. Since this happens to be the heart ofthe Midwest, not Atlanta, Georgia, that description does not make much sense. 
One could try to be cute, as many do, and refer to the old Bing Crosby movie, "The Bells of Saint Mary's." However, this is 1984, Bing Crosby has nothing to do with Saint Mary's and never did. In fact, many poor, mis­guided souls around here 
have  never  heard  of  the  
movie.  
So,  why  not  a  name  
change  for  Saint  Mary's  

teams? Such a change could cause Saint Mary's athletes to breathe a collective sigh of relief. 
It is difficult to be taken seriously when one is playing as a "belle." Come on, how intimidating can an althlete with the name "helle" be to other teams? 
Just imagine the other teams in their locker rooms: "Boy, those belles look tough tonight!" or "Hey, remember to watch out for belle number 12." 
Saint Mary's has long suffered from its stereotype as a college for husband-hunting females. Administrators and students deny this, and few put much stock in this worn prejudice. Most Saint Mary's women would be very upset, and with just cause, if accused of being mainly concerned with how they.appear to males. 
Yet this school promoting professional, practical and superior education for women, calls its athletic teams a group of"pretty women or girls." 
Assuming Saint Mary's athletic teams don't consider themselves better-looking than other teams, why does their name convey that? It comes across as a bit pretentious. Why should our teams be saddled with a name that seems to promote them as the best-looking team?

What kind of image does this present to othet schools, and to Saint Mary's students themselves? They are consistently told they are the women leaders of tomorrow, future heads ofbusiness and industry. Some­how pretty women or girls as a lone description does not convey this idea 
Saint Mary's is not the only team suffering with a name which has nothing to do with the team or school itself. How about the Purdue Boilermakers, Old Dominions's Monarchs, or the Akron Zips? The name 
"Fighting Irish" can be called unusual or interesting if nothing else. 
But what if the Irish were called the "Fighting Beaus." You laugh, but beau happens to be the male equivalant of belle. I 
The biggest problem with the name Saint Mary's Belles is the lack of respect it com­mands. Saint Mary's athletes work hard, and they certain­ly deserve respect, especial­ly since the Saint Mary's community generally gives them little attention. A name change will probably not prompt a change in stu­dents' attitudes, hut it can only help. 

Saint Mary's athletes and non-athletes alike should band together to choose and demand a suitable new name. There are many possibilities: mme contests, prizes. 
The name belle is one archaic tradition that deserves to die a quick, painless death.

Four immigrants sentenced despite 


protest as barroom rape trial ends 
Associated Press 
FALL RIVER, Mass. -Four men convicted of gang-raping a woman on a barroom pool table were sen­tenced yesterday to 6-12 years in prison by a judge who said they "brutalized a defenseless young woman and sought to degrade and destroy her human, individual dig­nity." 
The victim's lawyer said afterward that the 22-year-old mother of two feared for her safety and had moved permanently from the area. 
"There were five sentences in this case -one of them exile," said her lawyer, Scott Charnas. 
Superior Court Judge William Young imposed terms of 9 to 12 years on Daniel Silva, 27, Victor Raposo, 23, and John Cordeiro, 24. Young sentenced Joseph Vieira. 28,

Earlier, the elections council put the number of eligible voters at 2.5 million and predicted a turnout of 
1.8 million. The difference of 700,000 eligible voters was not im­mediately explained. 
The United States, chief backer of El Salvador against the rebels. gave SIO million to help pay for the com-to 6 to 8 years. Bristol County Dis­trict Attorney Ronald Pina sought a lesser sentence for Vieira, saying he had no prior record and that the woman's testimony that he was directly involved in the rape was not corroborated. 
The maximum penalty for ag­gravated rape is life imprisonment. 
Several hundred stood quietly outside the century-old courthouse. The silence erupted into shouts of "Let them go!" The defendants, all Portuguese immigrants, are backed by many in their community who feel they were treated unfairly be­cause oftheir national origin. 
All the sentences will be served at the maximum-security Walpole State Prison. Under state law Vieira must serve at least four years; the others face at least six years before being eligible for parole.

House Majority Leader Rep. Jim Wright, D-Texas, a co-chairman of the U.S. delegation, said a 70 percent turnout would be "highly accept­able ...higher than we have seen in the United States." 
Voting is mandatory here and those who fail to vote can be fined as much as 520, a significant sum in a country where the average annual income in $475. 

"These individuals stand con­victed of most serious crimes: crimes of extreme violence that brutalized a defenseless young woman and sought to degrade and destroy her human, individual dig­nity," the judge said in a memoran­dum accompanying the sentences. "Such crimes warrant a significant sanction."

SPRINGFIELD, Mass. -For the first time in the tournament, Notre Dame had to play away from home -something which the team had not done very well this season. The game at the "neutral" site of Springfield Coliseum matched the Irish and their "beef," Tim Kempton, against a troubled Boston College squad, whose tri-captain, forward Martin Clark, had recently quit the team.

ranked as high as sixth in the nation this season and entered the game as slight favorites. However, Boston College coach Gary Williams and his team were not ready for the two latest additions to the Notre Dame attack, a healthy Kempton and in­credible accuracy from the foul line. Kempton scored 20 points in just 27 minutes of playing time, while the Irish, who had been averaging a weak 65 percent from the charity stripe, nailed 34 oftheir 39 attempts. 
"We tried to pound the ball inside, which Tim Kempton did," said Irish coach Digger Phelps after the game. "With Kempton, we're 16-5. With­out him, we're 3-6. That's all I can say about how important he is to the team." 
"They come in here shooting 65 percent from the line and make H5 
minutes and silenced the sellout crowd at Pitt's tiny Fitzgerald Fieldhouse. 
The key to the victory was Notre Dame's ability to shut down the Pan­ther offense, which likes a fast-paced transition game. By dominating both the offensive and defensive boards, the Irish were able to keep Pitt from beating the defense down the court. A tightly-packed defense also forced the Panthers to shoot just 46 per­cent from the field. 
"The real key to the game was the fact that we couldn't get our running game going in the second half," said Pitt coach Roy Chipman. "Having ro come down and get into a half-court game isn't our style. 
"Notre Dame just kept its poise and we couldn't get them to turn it 
percent tonight," said a frustrated Williams after the game. "It's just so disappointing to outscore them from the field and lose." 
Not only did Boston College score more points ( ~H-32) from the field than Notre Dame did, but also the Irish scored more points from the foul line ( 34) than they did from the field (32 ). 
The key point ofthe game was the middle of the second half. Notre Dame had fallen behind by seven, 39-32, and seemed to be tlounder­ing. However, Kempton and Tom Sluby quickly put the Irish in front by scoring I I of the next I 7 points of the game.

Once again, it was Tom Sluby and Kempton who led the Irish offense. Sluby scored a team-high I H points, while Kempton scored I3. However, it was the performance bf point guard Joe Howard that provided the biggest boost, as he scored I 5 points, most of them late in the game. 
The Panthers moved out to a big 16-7 lead early in the game and held a 3I-2H lead at halftime, largely on the scoring of Clyde Vaughan and George Allen, who had 24 first-half points between them. However, the Irish quickly turned the game around 1n the second half by outscoring Pitt, l 0-1, in the first four minutes of thc half.

Come to Paradise, come to Notre Dame 
In a world of changing values, few things remain the same. Notre Dame is the Catholics' constant. The same problems that exist throughout the world exist at Notre Dame, but they have not marred her golden charac­ter. 
To those who see the educational system in the United States as faltering, the minds of the 
Joseph Murphy 
Wishful thinking 
youth as wasted: Let them come to Notre Dame. 
To those who view today's youth as sexual­ly active alcoholics with drug tendencies: Let them come to Notre Dame. 
To those who witness the violence, hatred and preJudice that plague the world: Let them come ty Notre Dame. 
To those who say that the Catholic Church is an in~titution of the past, that Catholics are no longer different: Let them come to Notre Dame. 
If anyone doubts the future of mankind, Notre Dame can ease those fears. Most cer­tainly, Notre Dame is an imperfect institution, but she remains a symbol ofall that is ideal and catholic. 
While striving for academic excellence, Notre Dame has continued her commitment to those denied a chance to enjoy life. 
Notre Dame has maintained an awareness not just of the local South Bend community, but of the world. Her awareness programs have addressed the problem of hunger in the world. Some students even fast one day a week. 
Leading the troops to battle has been Father Hesburgh, who has traveled the globe speak­ing about the plight of the hungry and the poor. His latest cause is nuclear disarmament. At a time when most people have retired, Father Hesburgh continues to set an example for his students. 
Above all, one finds at Notre Dame students with a sense ofsocial justice. Young men and women who believe they can make a dif­ference. They have the Faith. 
The doubters have spoken before, but they do not understand the nature ofthis place. They complain ofeverything that is wrong 
with the University, everything that is lacking. 
True, there are many things lacking at Notre Dame. Among them are: heavy drug use, long hair, expectant mothers and campus riots. The students do occasionally protest, but the protest usually concerns such outrageous demands as having Cap'n Crunch cereal in the dining halls. The students are not so much rebels these days, as comedians. 
Campus politics follow a predictable cycle. The students complain, are ignored, and go to sleep. The cycle is based on the authority of the administration and on the desire of stu­dents to graduate. 
Occasionally, an issue, usually related to parietals (sex)oralcohol, causes a hot flash on the campus. Such issues are infrequent but, when they arise, linger for months until replaced by new ones, such as who should count student ballots. 
What is important in the debates of trivial pursuit over student rights is not the outcome, especially since students never win, but the fact that students learn they have rights. In learning to demand their rights, the students will one day be able to defend the rights of others. Hesburgh, perhaps, adheres 
to the philosophy that the man cannot walk until the child learns cO crawl. The doubters reply that it is hard to crawl when you are chaim d to the crib. 
The doubters v'ew all these squabbles occuringwithin the family as they might a ser­pent hiding in a bush. 
What they do not realize is that whatever the impact of this place and its people, the in­tentions ofNotre Dame are always altruistic. 
The doubters are the complainers. They speak, but do not act. Whatever their notion of social justice, it remains locked in their heads. They may be concerned, but they are not committed. 
To repeat, let those who are pessimistic about the future of Notre Dame come to Notre Dame and find hope. For this place is as close to paradise as anywhere in the civilized world. 
To those who disagree with all of this, let them write to The Observer.

P. 0. BoxQ 

Wrong information 
Dear Editor: 
The editorial by Bill Krais which appeared March 16, titled N.D. forfeiting ideals for military contained some misleading informa­tion. 
Krais stated that Notre Dame holds invest­ments in five companies which rely on Department of Defense contracts for over 50 percent of their revenue. Krais' information was apparently drawn from an investment policyproposed to the Trustees by ourgroup. 
Becoluse Notre Dame does not disclose in­formation on its investment holdings, it is in­correct to say Notre Dame holds stock in the aforementioned companies. No one outside ofthe Board ofTrustees and the officers ofthe University has access to this information, including Krais. 
Michael Skelly Studentsfor Responsible University Investments 
Idealistic viewpoint 
Dear Editor: 
I am a senior in high school and will be attending Notre Dame as a freshman next full. Because my brother is presently a senior there, we receive The Observer at our home in Cincinnati. 
I was reading your paper when a particular article caught my eye. The article was by a guest columnist, Bill Krais, and was entitled 
N.D. forfeiting ideals for military. 1It ap­peared in the March 16 issue. The article was the most absurd I have seen in The Observer since we began our subscription four years ago. 
I certainly hope that my years at Notre Dame do not render me naive and idealistic like Krais. He has an opinion lacking any ofthe sense of history or reality that every political columnist must have. Not only do I disagree entirely with the article, but he writes several very inaccurate things. 
Krais writes that "war never preserved democracy, never resulted in lasting peace, and never effectively guaranteed freedoms." Who is he kidding? Was World War II not a war? Was Hitler merely a preserver of peace? Was our American Revolution not a war? 
I fail to see Krais's logic. America has fought in at least four wars to preserve democracy and the freedoms we so dearly enjoy: the Revolution, the Civil War, World War I and World War II. 
Does Krais seriously suggest that we should not have used military force to stop Nazi Ger­many? If he does, then he expects national leaders to be as naive as he has shown himself to be. 
Krais assumes that Christ hated all war. Like many simple minded idealists, he supposes that Christ's statement, "he who lives by the sword, dies by the sword" denounces all violence. 
How~ver, Jesus never once says that all violence is wrong. In fact, St. Augustine (who was one of the greatest Christian theologians ever) spends several sections ofCity ofGod explaining a just war and why it sometimes may be necessary. Where Krais gets his idea that "Jesus would not fight in any war, just or unjust..." is beyond me. 
It should be obvious to anyone aware of twentieth century history that the Soviet Uni­on is operating on an expansionist theory of foreign policy. How does Krais propose that we deal with this growing empire? 
Does he want us to rid ourselves of the military and allow our freedom to be lost, as he presumably feels we should have done with Hitler's Germany? The only way the Soviet Union will ever listen to any peace proposals is from a position of strength. Any other suggestion is irresponsible and naive. 
Obviously Krais feels we should lay down our arms and allow our freedom to diminish. The real world is much more complicated than that. 
I challenge Krais to be a more responsible Christian. jesus did not say "allow yourselves to be walked on." Rather, he promoted per­sonal freedom and liberties that only a well­defended nation can enjoy. 
Ken Kollman Cincinnati, Ohio 
Hofman's standards 
DearEditor: 
Last Friday morning, March I6, I984, I walked confidently into the Engineering Auditorium knowing that another "Emil" ritually awaited me. This quiz was unlike all previous ones, though. Dr. Hofman was not there to constantly "keep an eye" on any pos­sible cheaters, just in case any were to be found. 
He was not present during the quiz because he was disgraced and deeply wounded after reading the article on academic dishonesty published in the March IS issue of The Ob­
server. 
According to the article, cheating is more frequent in the Chemistry II 5-II6 courses than in any other course. The article also stated that the vast majority of students in these couses have cheated at least once, and some have virtu;~lly passed the courses by cheating. 
As a member ofChemistry I I6, I would like 
to know where the vast majority of these 
cheaters is. 
During the last two weeks, on quiz days, Dr. 
Hofman has made every member ofhis classes 
aware of an honor policy. If a person could 
take the quiz honestly, without any cheating 
whatsoever, he was to sign his name on the 
quiz. On the other hand, if a person cheated 
on thr quiz, he was to print his name. 
The policy was instigated solely for the benefit of the quiz-takers, enabling them to truly prove or disprove their own honesty. I wonder if the author of the article on academic honesty counted the number of printed names before he assumed a vast majority of us were cheaters. 
Dr. Hofman issues a multiple-choice quiz because he feels this to be one ofthe best ways to test our mastery of the material. The quiz also tests our responsibility and integrity as human beings. Although we receive no grades that will influence our G.P.A.'s, they will in· fluence our entire lives. 
Dr. Hofman is trying to show his students that a moral education goes hand in hand with a book education by giving us a free decision to cheat or not to cheat. 
I do not believe the vast majority ofDr. Hof­man's students would lower themselves to cheating, but obviously someone who writes for The Observer does believe this. Dr. Hof­man was terribly disturbed by what he read. 
I hate to think that the Dean of the Fresh­man Year has no faith left in the class of '87. Maybe those of you who do cheat should seriously consider how much you are hurting yourselves along with the rest of us. 
Nanette Penz Freshman 
Rampant cheating? 
Dear Editor: 
I am writing in response to The ObsenJer's article on cheating which appeared on the front page ofthe March IS issue. I feel that this article grossly exaggerated the amount of cheating which occurs in Dr. Hofman's Chemistry II5-II6 class. 
The survey of students done by Mr. Neblo must have been extremely incomplete to give the author the impression that a majority of the class has cheated at least once. 
The article which appeared in The Observer was a public humiliation ofDr. Hofman, a man who has devoted his life to Notre Dame. I feel that Dr. Hofman deserves a public apology from not only the author of the article, but also the editorial stalf, who allowed the article to be printed.

IF YOU ARE JUST 
GRADUATING INTO DEBT, 
HERE'S HOW TO GET OUT. 
If you've gone to college on National Direct Stu­dent Loan or a Guaranteed Student Loan or a Federally Insured Student Loan made after October 1, 1975, here's a great way to pay them off. 
Get the Army to help you do it. 
'instead of taking a long, long time paying back that student loan, you spend a short time in the Army learning a skill, and possivly even accumulating additional money for college (like a graduate degree) via Army College Fqnd. 
If you qualify, each ·year you serve reduces your indebtedness by one-third, or $1,500, whichever amount is greater. A 3-year enlistment eliminates your debt. 
It's worth looking into. See your Armv Recruiter.
