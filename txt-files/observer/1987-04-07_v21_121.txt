Grandparents show enthusiasm by making mountain out of moles 
This is a tale of adventure, of determination, of devious plots, of violence and gore. 
Our story opens in the seemingly serene set­ting of Grandma and Grandpa Buehrle's front yard. Birds are chirping as they dance through the branches of gargantuan trees. Squirrels ­not too unlike our very own ND variety -race and chase across the lush green lawn. Carefully tended flower beds line the half-acre of green. 
On the porch of the simple white one-story house sit our heroes, devoted to keeping law and order in their small kingdom at 345 Calver­ton Rd. They sit in rocking lawn chairs and drink in the beauty before them. Do not mistake their inert state for idleness, however; their acute sense for slight disturbance never ceases to work, and on these warm summer nights, their alertness is on overdrive. 
They are waiting. What are they awaiting? The most cantankerous, villainous creature that ever set foot in their happy little domain: The Demon Mole. After years of combatting his tunnels and trenches of destruction with poison, traps, and mini flash floods, they have finally decided to meet the enemy face to spade. Armed with what appear to be innocent garden shovels, they wield what they have concluded to be the most effective weapon in the shed .... one from which no weasley mole can escape. 
Grandma sits with the binoculars in hand, surveying the turf for turbulence. Grandpa rocks peacefully, but he is an overwound clock ready to spring into action at the slightest hint of trouble. 
Suddenly, Grandma jumps from her post with a shout. "Thar' she blows!" she cries as she sets her blue sneakers in motion. Grandpa flies toward the indicated yardquake as if he had wings on his feet. 
As they scurry to the spot, they know in their hearts that the moment has come. Sure enough, there is their Little Lawn Terrorist devilishly demolishing the terrain. The birds stop chirp­ing; the squirrels stop racing and chasing. They too have waited to see this moment and witness the final battle. 
Grandpa takes a deep breath and raises the spade high over his head, never taking his eyes off the trembling dirt. Grandma clutches her binoculars and squeezes her eyes shut in an­ticipation of the blow. 
Poised for action, Grandpa says a final prayer; all time screeches to a halt. Then, the death-shovel slices through the air, setting the earth back into motion. With a crash, metal meets earth, Mole meets death. 
Silence. 

Grandma opens her eyes and peeks at Grandpa, who grins back with a radiant glow of success. The birds break into joyous song; 

tne squirrels do flip-flops on the now safe green. 
Grandma and Grandpa do a little jig. 
Like all noble heroes, Grandma and Grandpa give their Enemy From Down Under a decent burial. They have once again set the world at 345 Calverton Rd. free from the path of destruc­tion, and all who live there rejoice and are glad. We leave our heroes proudly but attentively rocking in their porch chairs, ready to answer the call of chaos if the world should go astrayagain. 
For all you Save-the-Mole people out there, the point of my story is not that Grandma and Grandpa were right in trying to annihilate the entire mole population at 345 Calverton Rd. Rather, it is that they were right in how they went after the moles-with zeal. And that's the way they went after everything in life. 
Grandpa died in July of 1984, and Grandma died nine months later. They were two of my favorite people in the whole world, and I'll al­ways miss their drive and enthusiasm for life. 
I talked to my mom last night; she had gone to visit Grandma and Grandpa's graves earlier that day. Mom said she had to laugh. The ground over their graves was riddled with those lovely long mounds from mole tunnels. So, they didn't really win the Battle of the Mole Hills, but by their enthusiasm and determination, they won the Battle of Life.

Argentina was under mili­tary rule during John Paul's previous trip. On June 14, 1982, two days after the pope ended that visit, Argentine forces on the archipelago surrendered to British troops to end the bloody 10-week war. 
The defeat was the military regime's death knell, and Al­fonsin was elected and in­augurated in late 1983.

A band of youths including some self-proclaimed anar­chists protesting the visit clashed with police in Buenos postponed its vote until after the pontiff leaves. 
The pope is expected to ad­dress that issue as well as human rights. 
A investigatory commission established by Alfonsin said about 9,000 suspected leftists were abducted and summarily executed, most of them after being tortured, by security forces under the 1976-83 dicatorship. 
On Tuesday, the pope will travel to the southern coastal city of Bahia Blanca, then to Viedma, which is expected to become the new federal capital within the next few years.

Preparing graduating stu­dents for financial indepen­dence was the topic of the first lecture in the "Transition from Backpack to Briefcase" series held Monday night. 
Monday night's lecture is the first of a three part series spon­sored by the University Coun­seling Center and the Senior Class. 
"There's a lot of questions seniors have about what they're going to be facing when they leave Notre Dame," said Christine Conway, staff psy­chologist with University Coun­seling. 
"We thought it would be good to provide the opportunity to get some information about fin­ancial matters and relocation and ways to cope," Conway continued. 
The lecture, held at the Cen­ter for Social Concerns Auditorium, dealt with per­sonal budgeting, insurance and banking. 
John Lloyd, of Lloyd Insur­ance Agency, discussed the various types of insurance and the insurance needs of young adults. 
"Insurance really, to me, is a matter of . . . needs and wants," Lloyd said, adding, "Everybody's needs and wants are different." 
For auto inusurance, Lloyd recommended that graduating students get higher limits both in bodily injury and in property damage. 
''Think in terms of getting higher limits because your're not going to save that much (money) in the lower limits," Lloyd advised. 
Lloyd also recommended students CQnsider buying auto insurance from major compan­ies first, because employers frequently transfer younger employees. 
For home insurance, Lloyd advised students to record all of their possessions. He said it is a good idea to have a record of all household goods because "in the event of a loss, proof and burden of the loss is upon you."

Reagan will consider treaty over acid rain 
SMCprofs 


receive $5,000 grants 
By DEIRDRE FINN 
News Staff 
Professors Anne Brown and Herold Weiss of Saint Mary's each received a grant of $5000 from the Lilly Endowment 
A total of 28 faculty mem­bers at 15 different institu­tions in Indiana applied for the grants. Of these 28 only 15 applications from 11 insti­tutions received funds. 
Weiss, professor of religi­ous studies, said that seven faculty members at Saint Mary's applied for the grant. The college then se­lected and supported three of these applications. The endowment narrowed the competition to two success­ful applicants. A panel of out-of-state independent col­lege administrators selected the winners. 
Brown, assistant profes­sor of mathematics, said she would use the grant to develop a new mathematics course which would appeal to the liberal arts student. 
Weiss said he "hasn't any idea yet" what he will do with the grant. 
Associated Press 
OTTAWA President Reagan said Monday there are "no quick and easy answers" for curbing acid rain, but he agreed to consider a Canadian proposal for a treaty requiring lower pollution levels by an agreed date. 
Reagan made his surprise of­fer in a speech to Parliament after Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney told the same audience, "In this matter, time is not our ally but our enemy. The longer we delay, the greater the cost." 
The agreement to consider holding negotiations on the issue allowed the two leaders to wind up a 24-hour visit by Reagan on an upbeat note. 
Earlier, both sides predicted there would be no agreements, and U.S. officials said privately that a treaty was not the cor­rect way to combat pollution, particularly since various tech­nologies are being explored to fight it. 
Calling acid rain a two-nation problem requiring a two-nation solution, Mulroney said: "I ur­gently invite the United States administration and the Ameri­can Congress to join with this Parliament and the govern­ment of Canada in concluding a firm, bilateral accord which will provide a North American solution to acid rain." 
Reagan, departing from his prepared text in his speech minutes later, said he had "agreed to consider" Mul­

roney's proposal, "building on the tradition of agreements to control pollution of our shared interior waters," referring to the Great Lakes. 
He said they also "agreed to inject new impetus" to talks on 
Canada's  disputed  claim  of  
sovereignty  in  the  icy  
Northwest Passage.  

In their meetings earlier, Mulroney used a globe in his office to press his case that Canada owns the passageway through the Arctic Ocean. 
The United States recognizes a 12-mile Canadian coastal jurisdiction but insists the waterway is an international strait through which other countries are entitled to pas­sage. 
On another sensitive issue between the two countries, the president promised to work for the success of free-trade.

Goal of education debate continues over decades 
On March 10, Gregory Maggetti wrote a column commenting on the state of American higher education generally, and at Notre Dame specifi­cally. The letter was interesting and provocative, and should challenge the Notre Dame community -administra­tion, faculty and students -to undertake a serious assessment of their own views of the quality of education in our uni­versity. 
John J. Gilligan 
guest column 
The writer raised the issue of whether the education offered to Notre Dame students amounted to little more than glorified vocational -technical educa­tion, and cited recent surveys of student attitudes which seemed to establish the fact that the students are getting ex­actly what they want, a ticket to a finan­cially rewarding career in the form of a college diploma. It may seem strange, but almost the same dialogue about the purposes and effects of higher education was underway at Notre Dame almost a half century ago, when I was an undergraduate. In that era the great high priests of liberal education were Robert Maynard Hutchins and Mortimer Adler of the University of Chicago, and Stringfellow Barr at St. 
John's College at Annapolis. And the arguments, pro and con, were very much the same as today. 
The real point is the same as in those earlier times: education is not a com­modity, to be designed, packaged and merchandised to appeal to the broadest possible consumer group. The cus­tomer in this instance Cif we mean the student) is most assuredly not always right. If coming into the university they knew what was important and unimpor­tant, had a well developed set of values, and had developed their own talents and insights to a fully adult level, they would not need an education. They could pay the fees and pick up the di­ploma during freshman orientation, and get on with the important business of life. 
If the transmission of information is the goal, students at far less expense than four years in college will cost, can equip themselves with a computer and learn how to tap the appropriate data banks which continue to proliferate in every field of knowledge. 
It is precisely that transmission of information and attitudes which has done so much to form the students who come here, a transmission which in­volves far more than formal schooling; it is the popular culture in which the student is immersed from the moment of birth. And if anything has changed

in the past fifty years, it is the enor­mously increased power and efficiency of the technology and techniques of communicating the culture of materialism, militarism and con­sumerism. That's why an increasing number of incoming freshmen in uni­versities all over the country, incluciing Notre Dame, arrive on the doorstep convinced that "being very well-off financially" is the primary goal of higher education, and indeed of life. 
It is precisely that notion, and that attitude, which Notre Dame and every other self-respecting university should be dedicated to discrediting, because it is the absolute antithesis of the idea that the goal of higher education is to lead the student to the fullest possible development of the qualities and talents that make one fully human. Granted, that begs the question: what are those talents and qualities, and how are they developed? Right. That's where the process must begin, by asking those questions and exploring all possible answers. 
And since teachers cannot give what they don't have, the process must ever­lastingly involve them in asking and reasking and exploring the answers themselves, every year and every month, all over again. As soon as the teachers begin to regard the answers to those questions as so much informa­tion to be organized, codified, packaged attractively, and transmitted to the stu­dents with maximum efficiency, and minimum fuss, the process dies. In other words, if the teacher is not con­stantly growing and developing, not just in terms of specific knowledge, but in terms of the qualities and talents which make one fully human, the teacher is back in the commodity busi­ness. 
For the educational process to be all that it can be, it must necessarily in­volve always both students and teach­ers in a never-ending cycle of develop­ment and renewal -intellectual, cultural, and spiritual. Notre Dame claims, at least implicity, to possess distinct advantages over secular insti­tutions in appreciating the full dimen­sions of intellectual, cultural and spir­itual life, and a profound respect for the potential capacity for development of each individual human being. If that is true, we should be able to demon­strate on a day to day basis, in the life of every student and every teacher, the regenerative power of Christian higher education. 
At the very least, we should be prepared to discuss the subject, at length. John J. Gilligan is the Director of the Institute for International Peace Studies. 

P.O.BoxQ 
Student's death marks victory over adversity 
Dear Editor: 
I would like to call the attention to the tragic death of a recent Notre Dame alumnus, Antonio Mazure, from whom we have much to learn. 
Antonio arrived at Notre Dame in the fall of 1981 to pursue his graduate studies in physics. Not long after start­ing, in his second semester, he learned he had contracted acute leukemia. He bravely had to fight for his health, life and future with the aid of chemot­herapy treatment. His recovery was hard and painful, but he managed to regain his health and strength, become actively involved in his scientific re­search, and on the side, play soccer in the city league.

In December of the following year he developed lymphoma, or cancer of the lymph nodes, which had to be treated with high radiation doses. His struggle to survive was even harder than before; besides having to fight the dis­ease he had to fight the terrible side effects of the treatment. Again, he managed to fight his way out of it and continue with his Ph.D. research. 
The following year his leukemia came back again, as strong and defeat­ing as ever before. Yet he was not ready to give up, chemotheraphy was by then his way of living, and he was again able to recover. He obtained his Ph.D. in August of 1985, with an impressive · record; he had finished his degree in only four years with a 3.9 GPA and generated an excellent piece of thesis research. 
A year later he had another leukemia

relapse, while working as a post­doctoral research associate at Notre Dame. Early this year he went through a bone marrow transplant, in a last at­tempt to overcome this disease that was quickly closing in on him. Unfor­tunately, on Saturday, March 28, he lost his hard-fought battle with cancer: he died after a long month of struggle. 
Few people have this kind of courage and stamina to fight against adversity and death. Those of us who knew him had a display of courage, friendship and excellence we will never forget. His example, of somebody who never gave up, and who always fought for his ideals and future, should be recognized, ad­mired and imitated. 
Antonio, we will miss you.

ABC's 'SuperTuesdays' make a comeback 
JOE BUCOLO senior staff reporter 

R
emember the old days when ABC's Tuesday night lineup was the best? Everyone loved "Happy Days," "Laverne and Shirley," and "Three's Company." These shows helped to make Tuesday one of TV 's best nights. Well those days are gone, right? Wrong. ABC's super Tuesdays are back. Now that ABC has removed its weak "Jack and Mike" from the Tuesday night lineup, the shows are all strong and In­triguing. With this new lineup of very popular shows, ABC has recaptured its title of TV's best lineup. 
At 7:00 on Tuesday night ABC airs "Who's The Boss?" This show stars Tony Danza, Judith Light, and Katherine Helmond. Angela, played by Light, owns her own advertis­ing agency. She Is divorced and has a son. Since she can't be at home with her child, she hired Tony (played by Danza) to be her live-in house keeper. Also divorced, Tony has a daughter. The kids get along extremely well. The third major character is Mona, Angela's mother. Mona works at An­gela's agency and winds up attracting most of the custom­ers. The character of Mona is so popular that ABC is consid­ering a spinoff called, what else, "Mona." An upcoming May episode of "Who's The Boss?" will serve as the pilot for the spinoff. If that episode Is suc­cessful, ABC will begin taping "Mona." As the show's title indicates, there is some confu­sion over who really Is the boss. Angela is the boss at the office, yet Mona seems to run everthlng. In fact, many cus· 
tamers refuse to deal with anyone but Mona. Also, Angela owns the house, yet Tony seems to manage It better than she ever did. Tony even ad­vises the kids--as well as An· gela. This Is a truly funny and Ingenious show with a cast to match. 
Things only get better when "Who's The Boss?" ends. At 7:.30, "Growing Pains" begins. This Is another of television's · finest. "Growing Pains" features a family of five. The mother is a journalist and the father Is a psychiatrist. What's the catch? Since the mother is out of the house, the father, Jason, moved his practice into the house to watch the kids. Jason and Maggie have three interest­ing children. Mike, played by Kirk Cameron, is the oldest. He is a witty guy who prides him· self on his charm and "ways with women." Carol, played by Tracey Gold, is the genious of the family while Ben, played by Jeremy Miller, is the youngest. In many of his scenes, Ben is so funny that he quickly be­comes one of the audience's favorites. While many shows ignore the premise on which they are based, "Growing Pains" always seems to remind the audience that Jason Is a psychiatrist and housekeeper 
while Maggie is a journalist. 
The cast of this show sparkles. Alan Thicke is perfect In the role of Jason. Joanna Kerns plays a mother who re­members what adolescence Is all about. Kirk Cameron's per­formance as Mike is flawless. Tracey Gold is funny in that she perfectly portrays a humble, yet strong sister. FI­nally. Jeremy Miller Is hilarious as young Ben, the brother who follows Mike's advice and winds up succeeding more than Mike. This show is sure to be around for many years. 
ABC's 8:00 show speaks for itself: "Moonlighting." This show is a trend setter in every sense of the word. Through many different forms, this show entertains Its audience like no other. "Moonllghting"is known for its brilliant show for­mats. One episode placed the main characters, Maddie and Dave, as the main characters of Shakespeare's "Taming of the Shrew." Another episode fea­tured an interview of the char­acters by Rona Barrett. 
The relationship between Maddie and Dave alone keeps 



. 
Maggie (Joanna Kerns) combines motherly advice with 
"Growing Pains." the viewers coming back for more. Recently, Mark Harmon joined the cast as Maddie's boyfriend, Sam. These four episodes showed the true feelings that Maddie and Dave feel for each other. On the last of these. four episodes, Sam, who had asked Maddie to marry him, left when he realized he didn't stand a chance against Dave. 
Another trend that this show recently set Is the rerun. "Moonlighting" has had more reruns this season than any other show. The viewers don't seem to care, though. This is evident in that fact that "Moon­lighting," like the two previ­ously mentioned shows, is al­
ways in the top ten. 
Bruce Willis is excellent as David Addison. His newly found fame has permitted him to "ex­pand" his horizons into music and cable television. The beau­tiful Cybill Shepherd is superb as Maddie Hayes. The aura of stubborness with which she portrays Maddie has proven very effective. 
The final show in the lineup Is brand new, "Max Headroom." This show centers around Max. the familiar face seen on all those Coke commercials. The show is intriguing and fun to watch; however, the success of the show has yet to be deter­mined. One thing's for sure. It is a definite improvement from "Jack and Mik~" the "Moon· lighting" copycat and ratings disaster. Given time, "Max" is sure to succeed. If the popularity of Max's Coke com­mercials is any indication, this show should be around for a while. 
ABC's Tuesday night lineup is the best on television. It pro­vides a lot of comedy along with some suspense and in­trigue. The shows all feature superb casts and excellent writ­ers. With the possibilty of a "Who's The Boss?" spinoff and the popularity of "Growing Pains" and "Moonlighting," ABC has a definite winning night. 

'Life through the eyes of a peasant' 
KATIE KMRNf:Y features writer 

T 
he exciting, award-winning play "A Peasant of El Sal· vador" will have a single per· formance Thursday, April 9 at 8p.m. in Washington Hall. 
First created and performed by Gould ~ Stearns, a two-man theatre company from Ver­mont, "A Peasant of El Sal· vador" is the human, tender story of an aging hill farmer, his wife and five children who are trying to maintain the life they have always known. Rooted In land, faith, and fam­ily, their struggle stands out against a backdrop of sweeping social and political change. 
In this National Touring Com­pany production, two actors create 16 different characters. David Perrigo portrays among others, a son, a neighbor, a land reformer, a plantation foreman and the late Arch· bishop Romero. George Sanchez plays the old farmer, the central character of the play. Both men tell the tale with a light touch of humor and sensitivity, gathering the audience into a memorable theater experience. 
This powerful drama is the longest running play of its kind in the United States. The pro­duction won the 1985 Denver Global Justice and Peace award and has received standing ova­tions In .39 states and London since its first performance in 

1981. 
Mike Keen, coordinator of Special Programs and Events for the Cent~r of Social Con­cerns hopes to fill Washington Hall. Keen said, "It's very diffi­cult to present good drama and art that deals with contem­porary social issues because you're likely to either fall into some sort of rhetoric or put on an incredible dramatic presentation and miss the so­cial issue. These actors walk the tight rope and succeed in presenting life through the eyes of a peasant as well as good drama." 
"A Peasant of El Salvador" is being sponsored by the Center for Social Concerns. Other sponsors include the Helen Kellogg Institute for Interna­tional Studies, the International Students Office, Students Or­ganized for Latin America, Community for International Lay Apostolate, and the Over­seas Development Network. 
Admission is $4 for the gen­eral public, and $1 for stu­dents. Advanced tickets are available through the Center for Social Concerns at 2.39· 
529.3. All Proceeds will go to International Relief In El Sal­vador.

ND professor against tariff limiting Japan's chip exports 
By RENEE GAU 
Business Writer 
Last Friday the Reagan ad­ministration took steps to im­pose unprecedented sanctions of up to 100 percent on Japanese electronic imports. 
These sanctions will take ef­feet within ten days unless the Japanese allow U.S. computer chip manufacturers access to a larger portion of the Japanese market. 
U.S. 
officials maintain that this action is necessary to retaliate against Japan's breech of an agreement which was reached last July. 

At that time, Japan promised to open more of its markets to 

U.S. 
. microchip producers while increasing prices on their own chips. Through this settle­ment, Washington hoped to stop what they called dumping by the Japenese -selling chips below cost on the American market. 


Notre Dame Professor of Economics James Rakowski has taken issue with these sane­tions. "It is a regrettable policy," Rakowski said. 
He said the action taken by the Reagan administration is not a serious threat to the Japanese, but rather, "a signal that cooperation between the 
U.S. and Japan has become frayed." 
Rakowski maintains that im­posing sanctions on Japanese electronic imports may un­necessarily strain business re­lations. 
The Nakasone government has been working hard to en­force the agreement, but "it's difficult to control those inde­pendent, strong-willed Japan­ese producers," Rakowski added. 
So far the Japanese govern­ment has imposed a 30 percent reduction in domestic chip manufacturing, allowing American-made semiconduc­tors to penetrate the Japanese market with greater ease. 
By placing sanctions on Japan, the U.S. is inviting Japanese business to form a type of cartel to restrain trade, Rakowski said. 
Rakowski also disagrees with Washington's accusation that Japan is dumping microc­hips. "In anticipation of the fact that tariffs will be im­posed, people who want to buy microchips are buying them now, and that's tending to drive up prices," he said. 
Rakowski further stated that "it's difficult to say that dum­ping is going on." 
Pressure for the sanctions is coming from U.S. industrial leaders who are concerned that the Japanese are attempting to monopolize the microchip mar­ket after having already ac­quiring 90 percent of common memory chip sales. 
Rakowski agrees that the 
U.S. government "has a role to protect people from the harsh­ness of economic adjustment.'' 
The government, however, "should be less concerned with trying to change the structure of trade (in the microchip in­dustry) and more concerned with targeting individuals," Rakowski said. 
Furthermore, Rakowski said, "I don't think that a case has been made that (the Japanese) have that sort of a scheme to monopolize." 
There are many "robust" competitors in Japan, compet­ing freely and driving prices down, he said.

·­
surpass the U.S. in technologi­cal innovations. Some have said that there is a very real threat to U.S. military security if the U.S. should have to depend on Japan for microc­hips and semiconductors. 

Rakowski argued that this fear is ill-founded. "If we're still worried about Japan as an enemy then that would be a legitimate concern, but don't we think of Japan as an ally?" he said. "We don't have to think of everything as one big Super Bowl where there's a winner and a loser. 
"It doesn't hurt us if they are more productive and inventive . . . . We should worry about our own productivity,'' said Rakowski. 
Furthermore, Rakowski said he believes that as Japan's technology increases, the U.S. has a greater incentive to ex­pand.
Presently, the Reagan ad­ministration is attempting to avoid imposing a unilateral sanction on all Japanese prod­ucts. U.S. officials would prefer to limit sanctions only to those products in which Japan is the predominant supplier. 
"Our problem is that some people are being impacted ad­versely," said Rakowski. "We should cut away the under­brush and . . . focus on this problem the most direct way. 
-"1 have a 'Don't get excited' attitude about this situation," Rakowski said optimistically. He said he believes that offi­cials from both the United States and Japan are more con­ciliatory than they appear and are probably very willing to negotiate and resolve this tension-filled problem. "In my opinion, it's not the beginning of a trade war," Rakowski said.

A 1985 congressional investi­gation revealed that as many as 500,000 Americans hold false degrees, but some diploma­mill customers are not aware of the worthlessness of their degrees. 
Some fake institutions, for example, have taken impres­sive names like the University of England at Oxford and Southwestern University. These schools will grant credentials in fields ranging from medicine to law enforce­ment, and some give discounts to customers buying more than one degree at a time. 
Some employers have qualms about accepting resumes mentioning diplomas from just any Podunk U. One contracting firm president in North Carolina hired a control­ler who presented two business degrees from diploma mills. 
"I don't know if the company will ever recover," Everett Schafer was quoted as saying. The company had to pay out­side auditors $150,000 to mend the mangled financial records. 
Both students and employers should be aware of the potential danger of diploma mills. If left unchecked, printing presses may tarnish the proud image of college degrees.

Volleyball club prepares for MIVA tourney 
In preparation for the Midwest Intercollegiate Volleyball Association Tournament at Chicago this weekend, the Men's Volleyball Club will face Ball State, the eighth-ranked varsity team in the nation, tonight at 7:30 in the ACC Pit. 
Ball State is one of three teams on Notre Dame's schedule that is ranked in the Top 20, the other two being Ohio State and IUPU-Fort Wayne. 
In an earlier match at Ball State, the Cardinals swept Notre Dame in three games. The Irish are 0-3 against varsity competition, but have a 20-5 record overall. 
The Ball State match should prepare Notre Dame for this weekend's MIVA Tournament. Held at Wheaton College in Chicago, the tournament will feature sixteen club teams from the Midwest. Notre Dame is hoping to reclaim the championship that Wisconsin took last year. 
"Wisconsin is our big team--they won it last year, and they're really tough," said Club Secretary Steve Kranz. "It should work out that we should be seeded opposite each other, and if everything goes well, we'll meet them in the finals. That could go either way, and there's no room for mistakes." 
Notre Dame and Wisconsin have not faced each other so far this year. 
In their only match last week, the Irish swept past Hope College in three straight games. Despite the easy victory, the team was not satisfied with its. 9lay. 
"We didn't play well, but we played well enough that we pretty much smoked them," said Kranz. "It was nice that we got a lot of people off the bench to play. We were trying to use it as a tuneup for the Ball State match, but it didn't work out that way because we didn't play well at all." 
 

A week ago, the Rowing Club was looking forward to competing in its first regatta at Augusta, Ga., 
Steve Megargee 
Club Corner 


against Oxford and Ivy League schools over the weekend. But as it stands now, the club members are still waiting to compete in Augusta. 
On its way to Augusta, the team got stuck in a snowstorm in Tennessee and was never able to make it to the race. 
With the ordeal behind them, the Irish will host the Notre Dame regatta this Saturday on the St. Joseph's River in Mishawaka. Competitions will start at 8 a.m. It will be Notre Dame's last regatta before the Midwest Regionals in Madison, Wis. 
The field for the regatta will include the Univer­sity of Chicago, Michigan, Northwestern and Mic­higan State. 
"There are probably about seven or eight schools coming plus us," said Club President John Ralph. "Michigan is an awfully good team, and is usually our main competition, and Northwestern has been getting better every year. If we beat Michigan, it will set us up well for the Midwest Regionals. It will give us an indication of how much we have to work on. Michigan is our main competition, but all the Big Ten schools have pretty good programs." 
 

After defeating St. Bonaventure in the season opener, the Rugby Club lost its first match of the spring last Saturday in Chicago. The South Side Irish beat Notre Dame's A side, 29-18. 
Notre Dame's B side lost, 12-0, and the C side won, 15-7. 
"I thought we played a solid game," said Club President Quentin Williams. "Our receivers ran pretty good routes, and we couldn't hook up with them because there were 45 mile-per-hour winds out there. They had a serious size advantage on us too." 
Notre Dame will have its first home match of the spring this .veekend. The Irish meet Northwestern Saturday at 1 p.m. at Stepan Field.

head coach Tom Fallon. "They just outplayed us in most of the matches. 
"We did play well in two spots. We got great results from Dan Walsh and Paul Daggs." 
Walsh beat Ball State's Mike Raymond in straight sets, 6-3, 6-2, and Daggs had a tougher time with his Cardinal foe, but also won in two sets, 6-4, 7-6. 
Irish number·-one player Tim Carr lost a tough match to the top Cardinal player. Carr won the first set, but his opponent, Todd Hershey, pulled out the next two, including a 7-6 tie­breaker in the third. 
Notre Dame's number-two man, sophomore Brian Kalbas, also went to three sets in his match, and like his teammate, he won the first set 2-6, but lost the next two, 6-3 and 6-4. 
Mike Wallace returned to ac­tion in the thrird spot for the Irish after being sidelined by a shoulder injury, but his return was marred by a loss to Ball State's Martin Reist in straight sets, 6-0, 6-1. Irish teammate Dave Reiter also lost in two to Cardinal Mike Raymond, 6-3, 6-2. . 
Carr and Reiter lost their number-one doubles match, 6­3, 6-2 and 6-3, to Ball State, as did the teams of Walsh and Daggs (6-4, 6-2) and Wallace 
and Sean O'Brien (6-3 and 6-3). The loss put the Irish season mark at 13-9. 
"We played about as well as could be expected," said Fal­lon. "We were beaten by a good team. Let's hope they got us into shape for Bowling Green.'' 
The Irish travel to Bowling Green today for a match. But they will be without Tony Cahill, who is injured. "We are looking at having a real good match," said Fallon. "Bowling Green may be a little stronger this year, and we are a little weak right now with Tony Cahill still out, but it should be a good match." 

Irish lose to OSU, SlUE; down Wheaton 
By SHEILA HOROX Sports Writer 
The anticipated confronta­tion against Ohio State was not the only match to end up in the loss column for the Notre Dame women's tennis team. The Irish also fell to SIU-Edwardsville, the defending NCAA Division II champions. 

The two losses were split by a 6-0 win against Wheaton Col­lege, raising the Irish season record to 5-7. 
The Irish opened play Friday with a frustrating 5-4 loss to the Buckeyes. Alice Lohrer and

Resa Kelly chalked up singles victories for Notre Dame, while Ohio State won matches against Michelle Dasso, Step­hanie Tolstedt and Natalie Il­lig. Senior Tammy Scmidt's 6­1, 2-6, 6-3 win over Kristin Peterson tied the score at 4-4 before the Irish lost the final match. 
In doubles action, the Irish took only one match. Dasso and Lohrer defeated Yvonne Loh­rer and Jodi Saunders, 6-3,7-5. 
"That was the best match we've ever played together," said Lohrer. "I was excited playing against my sister, and everything seemed to click for Michelle and I." 
After defeating Wheaton Col­lege on Saturday afternoon, the Irish then had to face SIU­Edwardsville. 
Not only did the Irish come up on the short end of the three matches that went three sets, but they weren't able to take any match from the defending champs. 
"I thought we played better against SIU than we did against Ohio State," spid Gelfman. "They have a strong team and they were able to close out on the three-all points.''

Midgets, blood, tickets highlight Bookstore 
By BRIAN O'GARA Sports Writer 
Warmer weather and light winds greeted Bookstore Basketball XVI teams Monday as 40 teams advanced to the second round of the tournament. 
Screaming midgets, blood and speeding tickets were the words of the day yesterday, as several exciting performances were turned in. 
Jus' Tofu, a team which has reached the Final 16 for two con­secutive years, fought off a scrappy Screaming Midgets From Hell team in one of the tournament's biggest mismatches to date, 21-6. The Midgets, who were led by a 5-8 center and two 5-4 guards, played a relentless defense on Tofu, and took advantage of the almost non-existant wind to sink several long shots. Had the three-point rule been initiated into Bookstore this year, this could have been a dandy one, folks.

Tofu's height advantage and smooth play together proved far too much for the Midgets, who had several fans screaming for an upset. Or would it have been an upset? 
"It's a surprising loss," said Kevin O'Meara of the Midgets. "We controlled the boards but they just co.uldn't miss the outside shots." 
In a hard-fought battle on Bookstore 9, Oliver North and 4 Other Innocent Guys slid by Big Fat Chicks On A Frictionless Surface, 22-20. North's Ken Cavanaugh put an end to this brouhaha by hitting two long jumpers for points 21 and 22. Several players came away with blood-spotted jerseys, as the goings got rough near the end of the game. 
"We'll need a blood transfusion but we'll be out here for the next game," said North team member and second-year MBA student Mark Brostowski. 
Two teams which have logged the most miles in this tournament are Ex-NBA Quasi Scholars and Jocks, and Ex-MBA Proposition 48 Intellectuals. Both squads are made up of professional busines­smen who are enrolled in the Executive MBA program and com­mute to Notre Dame once a week for their classes. They made the journey here yesterday from their homes and professions in Michigan, Ohio, Illinois and Hammond, Indiana to play in Bookstore Basketball. 
Ex-NBA came away with a win, 21-6, over Vig, Bick and Theiny, but Ex-MBA dropped their contest to Gee, I Don't Know, 21-11. 
Bart Timm of the Ex-MBA team drove over six hours from Cleveland, and picked up a speeding ticket along the way. His bad luck continued in the game as he shot 0-of-7 from the field. 
Ken Nelson led the Ex-NBA team with a 5-of-9 performance in their victory. Nelson is also the Executive MBA Class President and is the only student in the program holding a 4.0 GPA. Academics and athletics at its best. 
In other action yesterday, Mr. Coffey and the Non-Dairy Creamers grilled Lee's BBQ (not to be confused with last year's champions with a similiar name), 21-4. Mr. Coffey was led by Erik Jaworski, an all-Bookstore selection last year, who hit 8-of-11 shots. Bon Jovi (Livin' On A Prayer) rocked the Nigerian Head Baging X-Men, 21-11, as Tom Geyer poured in all21 of his team's points. 
"That weight-lifting program that Tom has been on has added a new dimension to his game," said scorekeeper John Murphy. 
Today marks the final day of the first round of the tournament as another 80 teams are scheduled for action. The field will then be narrowed to 256 going into Thursday's second-round action.
