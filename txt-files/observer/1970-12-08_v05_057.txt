Ann Marie Tracey is not hap: py with the male-female ratio at 
N.D. and S.M.C., saying "It's not fair to Notre Dame!" She main­tains that Notre Dame should go coed independently even if St. Mary's chooses to retain its pre­sent status. If such a case oc­
curs, she hopes the N.D., S.M.C. relationship would be main­tained. If coeducation does come about, Miss Tracey would like to see a 1-1 ratio but feels 3-1 is more realistic. 
When asked if she saw the trustees as an obstacle, Miss Tracey cited, as a case in point, her off campus proposal. It has passed every case of acceptance up to the trustees and then was vetoed by them. She fears the same may occur with any at­tempts at coeducation. However, Miss Tracey said she was some­what comforted by Sister Alma, who assured her that the trustees will make a fair judgment. 
When questioned about the dismisal of the two S.M.C. pro­fessors, Miss Tracey said she did not think their activities on be­half of coeducation were the cause. She fdt there were unex­posed troubles between the ad­ministration and the professors. 

Krashna 
In ~n interview last week, Notre Dame SBP. Dave Krashna stated, "I expect some form of coeducation in the near future." He continued,"! would say fall of next year is unrealistic; may­be spring.'' However, he also indicated that the recent rumors of coeducation are probably baseless. K rashna puts more stock in the forthcoming coedu­cation report being compiled by Bill Wilka and Tim Conner and the work being done by the committee for Social Under­standing. This committee is now trying to institute coed eating arrangements and is inves1igating the possibility of constructing a mall on route 31 for Notre Dame and St. Mary's students. 
Krashna would like to see Notre Dame increase its enroll­ment to include women as sson as possible. He also supports the idea of coed residence halls. Al­though Krashna would like to have St. Mary's become a part of our coeducational university, he recognizes their reluctance to do so. He would therefore support a move to go coed independantly of St. Mary's 
Speaking on the recent dis­misals of Professor Runde and Professor Hickemeyer, Krashna stated, "On pure speculation, it seems there was some connec­tion between their efforts on behalf of coeducation and their dismisal." He also said the stu­dent government would soon is­sue a statement on the subject.

Don't mess up our Campus 
Why are you destroying your halls? 
The Notre Dame dormitories, never to be confused with Frank Lloyd Wright creations in the first place, have rapidly deteriorated over the last five years. The reason? Prime among them is the geometrically rising number of incidents of vandalism. 
There is no excuse for the incidents. No excuses are offered; only vague and tortured mutterings about the murderous quality of life at this University. But vandalism serves not to remedy conditions, but to make them worse. Damage to the hall often goes uncorrected for days, and acts of damage may leave permanent scars. 
Father Amen, in Planner Hall, has apparently been forced to limit keggers because of the damage done to halls. Now, how in God's name does vandalism wreak revenge on the University for the real or imagined ills? 
Yet the mutterings continue. Vandalism is judged to be a reaction to the repressive on-campus social atmosphere. Breaking windows, however, has never been considered much of an alternative to sexual gratification. 
Vandalism is alleged to be a reaction to the ills of the outside world. Since there is war, poverty, and racism, the contention goes, we will go out, get smashed, and punch holes in the walls to escape. Some escape. When the drunk comes out of his stupor, war, poverty, and racism are _still there, but now there's a hole in the wall. 
No, there are no excuses, and no higher reasons. Vandalism is the result of men who wish they were animals acting like animals. And animals belong in a cage. We suggest potential vandals keep this in mind.

~~j~-New Constitution jjj~ 
~iii The following is the fifth and last in a series of articles by ~l~l 
;:;:student government leaders on the proposed new constitution.:::: 
:~:~Mr. Imhoffis the president ofBadin Hall. :~:~ 
There has been a lot said in the past few weeks about the proposed Constitution. And I honestly wonder what I can add to the mountains of verbiage, for and against. Of course, the most 
notable feature is the abolition of the Senate and the transference of its powers to a "modified" Hall President's Council. This move, in itself, might appear as a meaningless shift of power or responsibility from one worthless Student Government body to another. But upon closer inspection, I think I detect a sincere attempt on the part of campus government to realign its priorities and bring meaning to hall life and government. Specifically, tl"\e Student Body President chairs the "new" HPC and his cabinet sits as non-voting members in an advisory capacity. This, I feel, is the most noteworthy element of the document and one of the few structural changes that merits any mention at all. 
Once a week, those directly responsible for co-ordinating the activities of their hall, the presidents, would have the opportunity to meet and discuss any aspect of university life they felt was relevant, with the one student best able to implement change, the Student Body President. For too long this campus has floundered with no real meaning behind its governmental structure. Campus and hall governments have operated separately with no co-ordination between the two. In this Constitution is a chance to form a meaningful liaison that would hopefully result in a unified campus where all would be happy to live. In no way is it possible for either of the two systems to alone build the community we need at this university. On through unification and co-ordination can the student body's needs be best served. 
My primary objection with the proposed Constitution involves, not the document itself, but rather this late date at which it's being presented to us for ratification. I am told that the framers of this noble document worked through the summer, feverishly trying to ready it for a September unveiling. Well, undoubtedly the shortened semester had something to do with the tie-up, but my primary concern is this: there is less than two months of the school calendar left in the present administration, and might not action this drastic wind up saddling those who assume office next year with an unfairly, unfamiliar system and the responsibility to "smooth the rough edges" during their terms? Or might it even thrust a new system on one who didn't support its establishment and, had he the choice, would not even have initiated such action? 
To be frank, I don't know what to think of the new Constitution. It definately has its flaws, as so many have pointed out already. But I imagine I'll vote to accept it this week bec~use its potential good far outweighs its liabilities. Whatever the case, we've got to begin to get out of this rut. All we have accomplished during the last couple of years has been for nothing if we just sit here and stagnate. 

We need a new constitution. We need one that will bring power and money to the halls. But this year's student Government pressed for more money to Student Union, instead of more money to the halls. This year's Student Government never comes around unless it wants something from you, like it will tonight. And this year's constitution has lost all of the vision we so distantly saw last March. We want to see it again.

Jesus Christ Superstar ~\~\ Reviewing contrasts 
::::: 
~~~ 

Jesus Christ, Superstar was released with a tremendous hype from Decca, the same company that brought us Tommy, not without publicity of its own, herald­ing the age of the rock opera. 
The rock opera has failed more often than it has succeeded. Witness Mercury's The Naked Carmen, and one Capitol put out about the Civil War, the name of which I can't even remember. 
Tommy itself wasn't the first of its kind. The Beatles and the Stones had both experimented with extended forms, and the Who itself had tone similar experiments even before Sgt. Pepper. Traces of songs from The Who Sell Out can in fact be heard on the later Tommy. 
I liked all of those things. They were experiments; the bands were trying to see how far they could go. And they weren't pretentious. The music was always only as serious as you wanted it to be. But people have wanted to make rock every­thing 'serious' classical music is, and more, and that includes pedantry. From this came Jesus Christ, Superstar. (the illegitimate son of Tommy and Naked Carmen?) 
the music of the opera was written by Andrew Lloyd Webber; the words by Tim Rice, who we understand are two record company executives. It was 18 months in the making, cost an enormous fortune, and utilized the City of London Ensem­ble (an 89 piece orchestra?) plus a load of rock sessionmen. (Ian Gillian of Deep Purple, Chris Mercer, formerly sax for John Mayall, Chris Spedding of the Battered Ornaments, etc. etc.) 
The problem is, though, that the whole thing really doesn't come off. Part of the trouble is that huge list of people; they are not used to playing together (the Who is) and so the music always sounds sort of cold, no matter how emotional it is. There is also another almost insurmount­able problem the Who didn't need to face. This is a problem of idiom. Tommy is purely a rock work. The songs, while 
I stare at my face in the mirror I cannot stay still I make faces try on different smiles and frowns tug at my hair light a cigarette and wonder what, in future days, this face will look like. 
One particular word is meaningless the word must create a flurry of thoughts and emotions that must rush in to give it meaning. 
strung together, are quite seperable, and most of the action is described in the third person. Besides this, there is no real dialogue: Daltry and Townshend sing all the characters, and no real attempt is 
made to keep the thing together like a 
radio show. In Tommy you get an idea of 
what is happening from what is going on 
around the action. 
But in Jesus Christ, there is actual 
sung dialogue, and even a chorus as in 
Greek tragedy. That is something which it 
is proving almost impossible to do in 
rock, because while songs can be extreme­
ly personal, they are never reflections of 
the singer himself. 
There is also the historical problem. People simply are not used to hearing things like "one thing about Jesus -He's cool!" and so it seems very self-conscious. The only place, a direct historical inten­tion seems to work is in a case like that of Donovan (Atlantis) or Cream (Tales of Brave Ulysses) where the effect is sort of a trippy beautiful days of the past thing. (Those were the days, miracles every­where, where are they now?) 
But Jesus Christ is too serious for that. It laughs at itself (Pontius Pilate), but it is funniest when it isn't intentional (Two direct musical lifts from Tommy and the line, Bleed me, Beat me, Kill me, Take me.') 
I hesitate to pan the album because many people like it, it seems, but I think it is liked more as a 'thing' than some­thing which will be of permanent value. I do know that musically, it is OK but neither amazing nor original. The perfor­mances often resemble the pseudo-rock you hear on TV, and no one particularly stands out. Even the engineering is nothing to brag about. The voices are mercilessly standoutish. I think what I am unhappiest about is the fact that with enough advertising, it doesn't really matter any more about the quality of the work, as long as it is adequate. And Jesus Christ is adequate. 
I cannot properly focus. When I stop, too many thoughts crowd in battling for attention. There is no goal no place that I am going to but to stop is impossible 
I read once that the human mind cannot concentrate upon one particular thing for more than q second before moving on.

Once upon a time there was a priest. And every Sunday and every holy day the priest and his 
t. 1 b t d th

congrega ton ce e ra e e Holy Eucharist. At every cele­brat ion he preached about the love of God. And the people 
dearly loved him, and spoke well of him. They even raised his salary, and said they hoped he would stay a long time. 
As the weeks, and the months, and the years rolled by, the Priest began to preach more about how God's love should make a difference in how his 
people responded to injustice, and to their afflicted brothers. 
And the people -well, of course they still loved their priest. And yet, "perhaps: Father needs an extended trip to help 
him relax. He's awfully serious-minded these days.'' But the priest only preached 
harder to his people about their job to the poor, and to the suffering, and to the needy, and 
about how they must all work harder to change those systems which caused oppression. "That is how love works," he said. 
And the people still came to the Eucharists -at least some of 
the time. And of course they still loved their priest -at least they appreciated the sermons he used to preach. But "the world's 
problems are just too big and 
too many to do much about." And "Father should go back to 
preaching about God's love. That's what we used to hear." And then one day it happened. 
The priest finished the Prayer of Consecration of the Bread and Wine. But instead of giving Communt'on to the people, the 
priest took the Chalice from the Altar and solemnly walked to the head of the chancel steps. And there, amidst the audible gasps from the people, the priest slowly poured the Sacramental Blood of Christ on to the 
carpeted floor. 

The people were indignant. "Father has poured out the Precious Blood of Christ. He has 
defiled the Sacraments. We can­not have a priest who does such 
unholy things. The Church cannot tolerate such horrendous acts. The Bishop will hear about 
this. Such disrespect for holy 
things is unforgivable." 

Lost: In the vicinity of .)'tepan Center. One (I) cosmic theme tying together the following impressions, gleaned from a weekend of Voice Recitals, "concerts", Uncle John's Band, and cold coffee with campus folk hero R. Clinting. Reward. Contact M.L, c/o Observer. 
St. Mary's college ... Senior voice recital...Miss Dee Bacon singing stuff by 
J.S. and C.P.E. Bach, Richard Strauss, Samuel Barber. You get the idea. St. Mary's Little Theater is such a right place to be for anything, and all the right people arc in attendance, like hip deep tone faculty resplendent in oh-so-free mottled scarves, unattractive but "nice girl" music students, and the whole thing is so elegant. There she is in long white dress, book in hand, singing all the right notes, not well, nor (God forbid!) good, but beautifully, magnificently. When you sing Bahc etc. you don't sing well, just beautifully or magnificently. Beauteous! 
Meanwhile, just a shuttle bus ride right. No value judgment or anything, just a little foreign to the TV generation. 
Which isn't to say that rock is any better. Why is there so much bad rock? Why do people eat that stuff up? Well, first we have rock in its -common sense, the great boyd of music that lays it all out, tries to put all the emotion love hate beauty and ugliness in the world on the downbeat. The beat has been an interesting thing, but it ain't art .. .I mean after you've screamed at the top of your lungs and turned the amp all the way up to "10", what else is there? Then we have the beat music in your historiclcal sense, like Creedence, and that's nice ... but the really good rock isn't rock at all, because rock didn't get good until somebody said "screw the beat." You see, when they screwed the beat, that's when some real nice things got done, The Beatles The Byrds, Buffalo Springfield. And then there's the new interest in folk and jazz, or at least, the old interest gaining a 
away, Rare Earth and Blood Rock. My, broader base. Most of the best stuff now 
God, the contrast! It's like the two ends of the earth. To see either one of these concerts, I mean to really see them, you had to see the other one. You will never see what rock is, exactly, until you see a rock concert right after a voice recital. Elegance, dignity, propriety.......... .. Rock!...Sex! ... Violence! Voice major walks out on stage .woo properly, while across the road brute animalistic rock vocalist with shirt off leaps onto the organ in an orgasmic display of seething 
emotion! 

At the Little Theater we listen very intently to hear her voice over the oboe; 45 minutes later we walk into the door of Stepan and are immediately assaulted by a wall of noise, only about half of which is coming off the stage. Amazing! The South Bend kids in all their ostentatious simplicity do it again, and across the road 70 people sit quietly in padded seats just like they didn't know what's going on over there! 
Now this voice recital and this whole classical music thing ... doesn't quite seem right does it? I mean, just picture it. Here are thf.!.~e folk, listening to this music that was written 200 years ago. 200 years ago! Listening, clapping, talking, being like people were 200 years ago. Only thing is, 200 years ago it was now and · now it's then and where is that but nowhere? 
Another thing about the voice recital thing ... to the relative newcomer to the world of "serious" (note the angular 
elevation of the nose) music, it seems like what you're supposed to do is sing the notes. Sing the notes, just like whatsisname wrote them down there. Does that seem like something of a perversion of the human voice, which has got to be s, the most personally expressive of all musical instruments? And the people, they II sit out there and listen,listen to make sure all the notes are isn't rock at all, just music. 
For every phony classical music person there's seven phony rock people; there are a Jot of people paying too much attention to the cultural niceties, whether they be cocktail pahties or red day-glo peace signs. It's not good that way. 
WNDU director responds to Walshe's criticisms of show 
Editor: 

Professor Peter Walshe has been kind enough to bring to our attention certain remarks, directed to The Observer, criti­cal of a recent presentation of a program called Wanderlust which dealt with South Africa. I would like to make a few observations on Professor Walshe's 
comments. 
As clearly stated at the beginning of the program, Mr. Burrud, the host, in­tended to deal solely with the European 
influence on South Africa. The title of 
the episode, "The Voortrekkers," clearly 
indicated that the program's focus would 
be upon the civilization and culture creat­
ed by the European immigrants to South 
Africa. As is the case with all travelogues, 
Wanderlustsought to creat an attractive, 
tourist-oriented portrait of the country. 
To suggest that such a portrait might 
be unrealistic is to acknowledge the fact 
that all travelogues are somewhat 
pointed, and to propose that a program 
such as Wanderlust undertake a more 
detailed examination of a country's poli­
tical and social problems is to misunder­
stand the program's scope and 
limitations. 
Sincerely, 
Wm. Thomas Hamilton 
Executive Vice President and 
General Manager 
...... 

But the priest asked them to sit down, please, and to be quiet. He asked God's mercy on his own foolishness. Then he asked 
them wht they had become so indignant. This was, after all. only a ceremonial spilling of the Blood of Christ. 

He had been telling them for five years about the real spilling of the Blood of Christ -in cities, among the poor, and the oppressed, and in the proud war. 
. · · 

Where was theu indtgnatton then?Was their love and faith and moral sense only a cere­
mony, which could respond only to ceremony? 
And he hoped they would not take the wine stain out of the carpet -because perhaps it could 

remind them of the real blood spilled every day in a hundre ways and in a thousand places. No, their indignation did not bother him; he only wanted to 
see it re-directed to the righ 
things. 

And the people -well, the supposed Father had a point. But he didn't have to make it

Flanner-A major victim of vandalism 
bv Steve Kane Like most everything else Flanner Tower isn't what it used to be; that is, a year and a half ago when it was brand new. Some of its physical grandeur has now disappeared because of the damage, breakage, and mistreatment of its structure and facilities; Housing college students would put a strain on any building, its elevators, plumbing, heating, electrical de­mands, etc. These difficulties can be calculated and resolved; the added problem of vandalism cannot be. 
sitors are to blame for much of the vandalism." He referred to the recent situation in which many false fire alarms were pulled. He pointed out that the majority of these pranks were done with the fire alarm near the front exit, which "could easily have been pulled by a visitor as he left the hall." 
Within the sections them­selves, weekend misconduct and the resulting damages "can be predicted," he said. "In other words, the weekend before the Thanksgiving holiday will usual­ly experiem;e more vandalism than the weekend before final 
Observer Insight 

Vandalism in Flanner appears to be no more evident than in other halls; however, almost every physical scar and deface­ment can be readily detected, since it is still relatively new. Elevators and lobbies are the most obvious .victims of damage, and this leads many to blame visitors and outsiders for the destruction. 
When asked about acts of 
vandalism in Flanner, Father 
Maurice Amen, the rector of 
Flanner Hall, replied,"It's ques­
tionable whether students or vi­

exams." 
Father Amen estimates that damage this year is less than in the last. He regretted that last year it was necessary for him to threaten an entire floor with 
paying for all future damage. As to his role as rector, he stated that he is "not going to patrol" the bad sections, but would ra­ther hope to see the problem resolved within the section. Amen's main concern with van­dalism is the "casualness with 
which minor destruction is done." He added that hall part­ies with beer kegs can be directly correlated with the amount of damage that occurs and for that

reason, students must seek his permission if they wish to bring kegs into Flanner. 
Joe Cassini, president of Flan­ner, views hall vandalism as more serious than last year. He listed holes in walls, damaged ceiling panels, the theft of a wall clock, and the breaking of the glass doors which enclose fire extin­
guishers  as  just  some  of  the  
destruction exper ienced  by  the  
hall thi~ year.  

Some students "think about 

themselves too much" and are blind as to what effects their actions have on the property of others, he said. He conceded the correlation between alcohol and vandalism, but then referred to the many students who fail to clean up their mess the following day, whether it be litter in the hallways or food on the rugs. 
According to Cassini most of the destruction has gone un­checked this year. He said that the Judicial Board has not met once this year, simply because no students have issued complaints. The reason for this, he ex­plained, is that many students 
are  "apathetic" and  don't  care  
about the problem.  
Cassini  concluded  his  

comments by saying that most students are concerned about the physical appearance of their rooms, but often fail to manifest any pride or regard for the hall itself.

educational institutions have requested teachers and/or administrators for summer and the regular school year. 
The jobs are classified according to three major areas: Engineering and Science; Business and Liberal Arts; and General Employment. Requests for N.D. students to fill summer positions have come from 58 major firms as of this writing with 350 major firms still to be heard from. Bulletins with names and addresses of the reporting firms will be found on the various bulleting boards around campus. 
The requests from educational institutions included many to fill teaching posts in Canada and various other foreign countries. There is also an increasing demand for Public Relations and development personnel from many schools across the country. 
The summer jobs available besides teaching included "on the job trainirtg and research work, counseling and camp work, forestry, accountants, and administrative training." Details on any of the job areas can be found at the Placement Bureau, Room 222, main building. 
bers, he expressed doubt as to the importance of the students in the numerical sense, but thought that "getting the stu­
dent opinion heard" was the key 
element of the plan. 
With regard to the Computer 
Science Program, Donahue said 
that he had not formulated an 
opinion as yet, but felt that the 
people ought to discuss the sit­
uation with the students in the 
department before any action is 
taken. 
Thomas Kenney from the Col­
lege of Science defined his goal 
on the Academic Council as 
"trying to improve educational 
opportunities here at the Univer­
sity for the students." He wants 
to get more communication be­
tween the students and the fac­
ulty and the administration. 
He said that the student mem­
bers of the organization would 
probably be "on trial" for the 
first year. He hopes that by 
careful research and discussion 
of the various problems the stu­
dents will be able to come up 
with some good solutions to the 
problems they will be facing. 
Student Government Academ­ic Commissioner Bill Wilka said that he hopes that the students who have problems that relate to Academic Council work will contact their respective represen­tatives and discuss their prob­lems with them.

"But statistics seem to impress them over need. We may have to poll the students to demonstrate the concern over this rna tter." Kathy Murphy, Fr. Dunn, and Dr. William Giantonio are pre­paring the next phase of this program, a questionnaire to chart the interest on both campuses in a sex education program. Father Cormier also asked the committee for the policy on unmarried pregnant girls. Although administrators attending the meeting stated that there was no policy, they have given a student permission to stay. Later, the girl changed her mind. Father is concerned about the allegedly unhealthy psycho-sexual atmosphere at the school. 
"A program of educa­tion in human sexuality is ur­gently needed and long overdue at St. Mary's. Vatican II declared five years ago that students should be given positive sexual education." 
"Therefore, I am toubled by our administration~ failure-to provide the health committee with effective leadership," he continued, "and direction in this matter. This neglect of a need so crucial for student growth within our Christian college community is a serious conse­quence." 
There is a dearth of course offerings on sex because present­ly the only classes on the subject are offered in the theology department and limited to IS students, he stated. He also cited the need for an interdepart­mental course on human sexuali­ty cooperative with the philo­sophy, psychology, and theology departments, and the need for a professional consultant.

SLC discusses spring elections and Soph cars 
Erratum 
The remarks attributed to Ed McCartin in yesterday's Observer concerning his appointment to the Academic Council and his 
feelings  on  the  Computer  
Science  department  were  not  
entirely accurate.  

McCartin said that "It is questionable whether computing science merits departmental status. It may be that the value of computing science lies in its application to various existing departments in all four of the colleges. I did not intend to assert that the students in computing science were pursuing an invalid objective or trying to impose my personal value system on them. I was merely trying to question the value of their study as a major field. My remarks are not intended to indicate the way I will vote in the Academic Council for I am still undecided. I intend to vote as a representative of the college and not merely on the basis of my personal opinions." 
The Observer wishes to apologize for the error and hopes this clarification will clear up any misunderstanding resulting from it.

government would reduce these games to a "bare minimum." 
While on the topic of the new constitution, Krashna said he hopes centralize elections and have new officials begin their terms at an earlier date. Depend­ing on the vote Wednesday, he said there is a possibility that this spring's elections may be moved up because of the semes­ter break and the new SBP 
would  take. office  before  the  
customary date, April I.  
The  present  debate  over  the  
record  co-op sponsored by  the  

Student Union also came under discussion Monday and quickly 
expanded to include the prices of textbooks. There is a possibi­lity of a special meeting next week at which the problem will be discussed. Prof. John W. Houck requested that data on the operation of the bookstore, 
particularly the second floor operations be available at the meeting. Doubts that this mater­ial could be compiled by then were expressed by several mem­bers of the council. 
Faccenda · said "that there probably isn't any cost account­ing between the first and second t1oors." He noted that bookstore profits in the records he had seen did not distribute the over­h cad between the different

ARTICLE  IX:  (Amena­

body. Section II: Amendments to 
this Constitution will be made having been voted on 
not more than twenty days and not less than ten days after its presentation to the President's Council: the pro­
departments. Faccenda thought 
that the bookstore is operated 
on a more or less "cashbox" 
basis. 

Prof. Eugene W. Henry report­ed that his committee on sophomore cars was still re­searching the financial problems of the proposal. He said the Office for Business Affairs is still to be contacted. Another mem­ber of the committee, Rich Tarrier, said the sophomores were asked to research certain financial problems three weeks ago but Jlad no(comoleted the

posal will be presented regarding 
the feasibility to the council 
next Monday if a special meeting 
is called. 
Faccenda explained obstacles to the proposed annexation of Notre Dame by the City of South Bend. He said South Bend claims it will make money due to the larger rebate in state taxes as a result of counting Notre Dame students as city residents. He noted that it would cost the city two dollars for every dollar in extra revenue to provide the public services it provides to private citizens.
