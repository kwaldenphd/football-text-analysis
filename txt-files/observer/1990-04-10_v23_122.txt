The report concluded that 
students believn "The responsi­
ble social drinking aspect of 
semi-formals has, in scHne re­
spects, been replaced by closet 
alcohol abuse." 

The rector survey, a three 
page essay-styli~ survey. was re­
turned by fourteen of the 
twm1ty six rectors. According 
to the report, "the rectors ex­
pn~ssed a practical. if not en­
thusiastic, support of semi­
formals in general." 

The report concluded that 
although rectors are not enthu­
siastic about semi-formals. 
most see them as an opportu­
nity for students to socialize, 
date and build hall unity. They 
also believe that semi-formals 
are an opportunity for positive 
interaction between males and 
females. 

Finally, the report found that 
most rectors are happy with 
the present restrictions on 
semi-formals and have seen 
improvements in the quality of 
semi-formals in recent years. 

Although most rectors are 
happy with only one semi-for­

the overwhelming majority of 
students said they would attend 
more, according to the report.

vien-chairman, and juniors

Postal Service should face the FAX 
It's amazing what--------­can be. done with a telephone today. They're in cars! They're in airplanes! And while I was in Washington D.C. last week, I saw a phone IW""''' on a tour bus! Now Joe Zadrozny
there are video phones. With a new Production Manager
little gadget thrt is out now, you can find out who is calling be­fore you answer. Even phone sex, (I don't want to know). But what I find really in­teresting is the FAX machine. 
Watch out U.S. Postal Service, now there is tele-mail. For the price of a phone call, you can send pages over the phone lines to anywhere in the world. Rather than having to wait three days for a letter, it can come instantly. 
This came in handy last year while I was in Angers, France. There were so many questions to be answered around registra­tion time, making answering them over the phone unthinkable, that we just wrote all our questions down, FAXed them to the Foreign Study Office, and they FAXed us the answers back the next day. Think about all the money we saved. 
Think about the way this is going to hurt the Postal Service. I remember the good old days when a local letter was delivered the next day. Now with FAXs they have no in­centive to deliver mail promptly. Their rea­soning will probably be "If it was impor­tant, they would have FAXed it." 
With the drop in the amount of mail to deliver, the USPS will be forced to raise prices, not that they haven't already, to con­tinue the present service. I wouldn't mind if they raised prices as long as service im­proved or at least stayed the same, but it doesn't. 
And even worse, door to door delivery is being stopped. New neighborhoods are re­quired to put in little postal centers where all the mail for the area is delivered to post office boxes. If I'm going to buy a new house and pay a hundred thousand dollars, I want my mail delivered to the door. 
Now with this new wonderful invention, I won't even have to open the front door to get my mail. I'll just have a little black box with a red flag sitting next to my telephone for the FAXs to fall into. How convenient! 
FAXs are everywhere! Even on the "Simpson's," they were FAXing photos of Homer Simpson and a bellydancer. I hadn't thought about pictures. 
I did see something on my way back from Washington this weekend that I still haven't figured out. Somewhere in Northern Ohio (no comment I don't want anyone mad at me) at a "Comfort Station" on the toll road, there was a Pay FAX Machine. Go figure! You can both send and receive. I can picture this, "Hey Billy Bob, I'm lost up here on the toll road, FAX me the map!" "Sure Ted, just make sure you FAX it right back, I don't want to be lost myself." 
Notice, If anyone would like to comment on this Inside Column, Please FAX it to me at 55N-SIDE.

CAMPUS 

There were approximately 1 ,500 no-shows from both the community and Notre Dame and Saint Mary's, for Christmas in April on Saturday, said Pat Doran, assis­tant director of Residence Life. However, he said, "We were successful at getting the work done," he said. The extra lunches and dinners were donated to the South Bend Center for the Homeless. Although this year's pro­ject was an improvement over last year's, Doran said that next year there may be a ceiling on the number of volun­
teers so that work sites may be pre-assigned. He added 
that the community lauded the efforts of the students.1_•••••••.--l

Grouping of students is inevitable 
Academic tracking also involves race, class size 
By KATE MANUEL News Writer 
J~lementary school teach­ers will group students wtwtlwr they are on different acadmnic levnls or not, ac~cording to Maurnen llallinan. 
Hallinan also notf~d th11 ef­fects of racial rom position and elass size on acadnmic tracking in a lncture which focused on tlw empirical ways in which schools differ in their tracking systems. 
In "S!'hool Differences in Tracking and Learning Op­portunitit1s," Hallinan. a profnssor of sociology, said, "tlw empirical research on tracking has almost ignored tlw organization of tracking. It takes tracking as a basic assumption." 
She desrribnd her research as differing from others' on the same subject because it focuses on the structure of tracking itself. specifically on how tracking comes to be, how students arn as­

signed to tracks, and the range of student achieve­ment within tracking levels. 
"The school, bneause it is an organization, is faced with certain contingencies and constraints," said Halli­nan, "yet, the most impor­tant compositional charac­teristic when creating a tracking system is the ability of the student body." 
From her own research on fourth to sixth grade math groupings, Hallinan noted that most elnmnntary school tearhnrs will create three in-
class ability grou,r.s. regard­less of student abilities. 
She also observed, "the regular track in both English and math are the largest. This does not mean that these classes are the largest but that the most students are in that track." 
Hallinan pointed out that racial composition has a di­rect and an indirect effect on tracking structure. Her re­search showed that class­rooms with a larger number of minority students also had a larger number of higher ability groups. Halli­nan concluded from this that teachers were creating a larger number of high ability groups to insure "racial heterogeneity" in the groups. 
llallinan is currently in the fourth year of a study fol­lowing the progression and development of groups of students from the seventh to the tenth grades. Her lecture was part of the Conference on School Characteristics and Student Outcomes.

Senate resolution favors SYRs with social emphasis 
By SANDRA WIEGAND Assistant News Editor 
Over 86 percent of juniors and seniors in an extended sur­vey said that policy changes had a negative effect on hall semi-formals, according to a report presented at the Student Senate meeting Monday. 
The senate unanimously passed a resolution encourag­ing a more widespread adop­tion of prior recommendations made by the Task Force on Whole Health and the Use and Abuse of Alcohol. 
Although some recommenda­tions by the Task Foree wore enacted, the resolution says, "the more important and fun­damental changes have been ignored." 
The changes that were made were intended in part to reduce emphasis on drinking at semi­formals, said Mike Carrigan of the University Documents Committee, but 33 percent of students polled said they thought there had been more drinking since the policy changes, and only 12.3 percent said they thought there had been less. 

"The emphasis should be taken off drinking and put back on social interaction," Carrigan said. 
Since only a portion of the Task Force's suggestions were implemented, he said, there has been more drinking behind closed doors. Further changes should inelude extended hours at the senior bar and lluddle, and accessible transportation, as advocated in the original re­port by the Task Foree. 
The resolution favornd a non­alcoholic semi-formal for freshmen during orientation, to show them that "they ean have a good time at Notre Dame without drinking," and helping to avoid the "social rut" of drinking that often occurs. 
The resolution also encour­ages that students who "cannot drink socially" be given special attention. 
Carrigan said that unlike the limited set of changes that was adopted, a multi-facetnd new policy should "treat the disease itself rather than the symp­toms." 
The changes proposed in the senate resolution will be ad­dressed by the Campus Life Council. The resolution was submitted by District 2 Senator Lisa Bostwick. and utilized in­formation compiled by the Stu­dent Govnrnment Committne on All-hall Semi-formals.

Culture, language bar ethnic assimilation 
According to ancient Chinese legend, the dragon is not an evil creature, but is a god and a friend of men who worship him. He has the power to bring peace and prosperity. Ruling the waters and the winds, he sends the good rain, and is hence the symbol of fecundity. In the days before the dynas­ties, two dragons fought a great duel until both disap­peared, leaving only a fertile foam from which the first Chinese appeared. Thus, the dragons came to be looked upon as the ancestors of a race. 
When we Chinese children eavesdrop on adults talking, we learn that we have failed if we grow up to be but laborers or housewives. We should be pioneering doctors, learned physicists, or knowledgeable educators. Education is of the utmost importance in any respectable Chinese family. 
Maybe that was why the midwife cut my tongue. She pushed my tongue up with a pair of scissors and sliced the frenum. I don't remember her doing it, only my mother talking about it. 
"Why did she do that to me, Ma?" 
"So that you would never be tongue tied. So that your tongue would be able to move in any language and you could pronounce anything and would never have trouble learning." 
"But why did you allow it, 
Ma? Didn't I cry?" 
"I didn't want to, but your grandma ordered it. Many Chinese grandparents believe it to be a blessing conferred to their grandchildren. Now enough of this nonsense." 
DOONESBURY 
I used to curl my tongue up in front of the mirror until my frenum was a thin white line. There was no scar in my mouth, perhaps I was born 
with two fren-ums. Sometimes, it made me proud that my grandma would allow such a powerful act to be committed to me. Other times, it terrified me to think that the first thing my grandma wanted to do when she saw me was cut my tongue. 
'I remember the many times people would ask for my name and politely nod a "nice to meet you" when they couldn't say it. 
At  that  moment,  I  had  
learned  to  be  ashamed  
of  my  un-American  
name.'  

My first year in grade school is deeply ingrained in my mind. It was a routine that was to be repeated for most of my child­hood years. In the mornings, I would go to a regular school, where I read, did math and learned the alphabet, all the essentials of modern living. After school, I would pick up my lunch box and head to the Chinese school, where I would recite the lessons of the day with other Chinese children. We would chant together, voices loud and soft, high and low, un· til the sun went down. 
My first difficulty with being Chinese occurred when I was in high school. I had always got­ten away with not speaking in class, but in speech class we had to introduce and talk about ourselves. One by one, each of us spoke. There were Davids 
Siong Yang ReMflectiOI'JS

and Mikes and Susans and Dianes. Then it was my turn. There was a giggle in the back of the room after I announced my name. A strong feeling of embarrassment overcame me. I have a name that comes out of the mouth more like a sound than a name. No matter that it means "warrior" in Chinese or that I was named after my great-grandfather. I remember the many times people would ask for my name and politely nod a "nice to meet you" when they couldn't say it. At that moment, I had learned to be ashamed of my un-American 
name. 

"Couldn't I change my name, Ma?'' 
"Why would you want to change a name like that? You know that you are named after your great-grandfather and that his spirit will lead and pro· teet you. No, don't change it!" 
Or it may well be that my great-grandfather is resting happily in China, his spirit dis­persed among the real Chinese, and not watching out for me as he should. 
I came to Notre Dame in the fall of '86, despite protests from my mother that I should have gone to Berkeley, where I would fit in. I was a yellow boy entering a sea of whites, and she was fearful that I would be an outcast. 
My freshman year was a si­lent one. I spokn to as few peo­ple as I could, afraid that my differnnce would be intensified by the sound of my voice. I liknd and gravitatnd towards the students who talked and laughed the loudest, because they talked to me as if I, too, wnre a bold talker. 
"Do you have many frinnds in school?" 
"I have some, Ma." 

"Are they Chinese? Chinnse have to stay together.We are different, you know." A searing, hot anger flashed through me. 
"Ma, we are not that different from other people. We think and feel and have biases just like other people do. We are all human beings, Ma. If you didn't keep reminding me, maybe I wouldn't have felt so much of an outsider here." 
"Don't talk back to me! Is this what you learned in school?" 
That night as I lay in bed, a sense of guilt enveloped me. Maybe Chinese people are dif­ferent. Who else but the Chinese would bind their womenfolk's f,.et to keep them home? Who else but they would sell their daughters as slaves simply be­cause they would never carry on the family name? I have no answer. 
Over the years, I have slowly begun to find a resolution for myself. I can understand why Chinese people would appear to have idiosyncrasies, but I be­lieve that we are fundamentally the same as any other races. 
Sometimes. when I hear a 
harmless joke about anything Chinese, I find myself getting angry, and I have to shut my ears and walk away, gPtting out of hating range. It is start· ing to affect me less. I am making progress. a little every day. 
I am getting better about making friends. I have a friend here who I am fond of--his hair is short and occasionally spiked like mine. I think of both of us as twins. ~~xcnpt that his hair is many shades lightN and his skin is white, not yellow. 
I spoke to my mothnr re­cently. "You will be graduating this May, won't you?" 
"Yes, Ma." 

"If you want your name on the diploma to be an American name, I have no objection." 
"That's okay, Ma. I think I will keep what I have. After all, it is my name." 
"Do  as  you  wish,  Little  
Dragon."  
She has  not called  me that  

endearment for years. My mother has the soul of a dragon, she being born in the Dragon Year. I am of her flesh. In essence, I, too, have the soul of..a dragon,; 
Yes, Ma. "Take care, Little Dragon." And she sends me on my way, 
both of us now older and changed, she still thinking of a Chinatown many times bigger than those I have known.

Biology is not my favorite dass -not by a long shot. But I do learn a lot in it. For in­stanee, in lab I learned that pig guts are every hit as disgusting as I'd imagined. It was great­my lab partner was making jokes like "So, you want to go outsidn and toss around the ol' pigskin?" while I did a pretty poor ventriloquism act with the pig's mouth. So obviously the lab sessions are bennfieial. 
My biology book, whieh. dun to its sizn. would be legally dassilied in some states as "a piece of furniture." is filled with interesting pieces of informa­tion as wnll as truly frightening dosn-up micrographs in which insects appear to bn as large as some western states. For startnrs, here's a Fascinating Fun Faet which I just flipped to at random from among several similarly scintillating pages: 

I "Thn fending stage of cellular 
I slime molds. division 1\cra­siornyeota. is a urrirrudnatn
r myxamoeba, almost indistin­
~ 
guishable from a true amoeba." 
In addition to putting random words in bold or italic type, this is also the kind of book which tries desperately to make the subject more interesting by giving the student reader a glimpse of the raging contro­versies which ignite the field of Biology: 
"Some workers think the lophophorates, such as the Bryozoa, represent the common ancestor of many protostomes and the dcutorostomes because their embryonic development shows similarities to both groups. Other disagree, consid­ering the lophophoratcs a sep­arate group, possibly derived from annelid ancestors." Boy. what a fierce argument that sounds like! It's disagreements like that which tear families apart as brother and sister choose sides on the "protostome vs. annelid" de­bate! Mark my words, this very well could be the spark that snts off World War Ill! Discus-hiding out. When he sees the conse­quenees, he regrets his aetion. This lad is seen as a symbol for all young criminals. and he is rehabilitated through the wisdom of Splinter. 
The movie is packed with violence; so much. in fact, that during the long struggles, the audience forgets why

sion Question: What does the author feel could "very well" cause World War Ill? Do you think he's maybe just a little bit on the goofy side? Explain. 
!\ few weeks ago we had an assignment where we at: tempted to locate the sign stimulus which initiated the ag­gressive display of a male Betta spendens. (English translation: We made some drawings and showed them to a lighting fish in hopes of getting it mad.). 
Like true scientists, we tried everything. While the lab group on the other side of the table tried to get responses by hold­ing up a drawing of a police car or a sign rnading. "If you can understand this, swim around these latex warriors were fighting in the first place. The children in the theater laugh at every punch, the loudest roar eoming when a villain gets sent across the room after being clubbed on the chin with a 1-wood. If a viewer follows the story closely, he will understand why the turtles are so violent. It has some-

in a circle three times," our group kept doggedly at its task, even accompanying the presen­tation of our drawings with some realistic fish noises. (This consisted mainly of saying, in a quiet, fish-like tone, 'Tm a fish, I'm a fish. I'm certainly not just a drawing.") 
By the end of the experi­ment. frustrated by the lack of positive responses, our simu­lated model fish was saying more inflammatory things like "I got your woman. I make more money than you. I killed your family. Now I'm coming for you." I'm not sure, but I think the fish began laughing at us. The fish in the lab group next to us seemed to be reacting to a Rolling Stones song. 
Discussion Question: Would the fish have reacted to country music'? Why or why not? 
Despite the fun I have in Biol­ogy lab and the continual read­ing adventure that is the text­book. I'm pretty sure I made thing to do with regaining lost honor and avenging a death, strictly Karat•~ Kid stuff. We are supposed to learn that those who don't let the spirit triumph over the strength of the body, nspocially children, will never win. But if the story is so convoluted that a rollnge sophomore has a hard time un­derstanding it, how is a five year-old going to get the message'? Wouldn't it be easier to have McGruff. the Crime Dog, tell kids not to steal and save everyone a lot of time and money? 
This is not a message movie. It's all for kicks, as evidenced by the superficial and flighty acting, and the turtles' meaningless wisecracks. Fun is hard to lind in the movie. It's hard to lind anything, in fact, because the shots are so dark and Batman-esque. This is obviously an effort to maintain the mystical feel of the original comic book stories. As a matter of fact, Eastman and Laird list Batman artist Frank Miller as orw of their inlluencos. Many of the camera angles reflect that cornie book feel, but that is as dose to the comics as the film gets. The turtles were originally not the "Laugh-In" of crime­lighting. 
The turtles are hard to recognize, except for Donatello, whose voice is that of teen heart-throb Corey Feldman. Their only distinguishing features are thnir different colornd masks and their individual weapons. Viewers do, however, forget that these charactm·s arc puppets and costumes, because they exude personality. They exudn that surfer/skate-rat personality that makes you want to slug them after their seventeenth "Bo-da -cious!" But the kids love it. If you feel you must see this film. please reconsider. It is not intended for mature audiences. Yet. if I were a parent, my child would not be allowed to see "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles" alone, lest he come back with the idea that it's fine to throw someone off a building simply because they don't practice a certain form of ninjitsu. It is a painful film to watch; I got a headache trying to make out the action in all the dark fight scenes. Stick to the comic books, and pray that the next

the right move in not choosing to be a biology major. As far as I can tell, biology majors are the kind of people that talk about unappetizing subjects like the intestinal tract with the same sort of enthusiasm that young boys use to discuss fast

Last week one of our TAs thrilled the class by informing it that some tapeworms grew to 25 feet in length. And it's not just tapeworms that I have to worry about. Perhaps the single most important fact I've learned from Biology is that ev­erything on the planet is out to get us. Threats to human life range from the Giant Squid (Squidus Really bigicus) to the friendly critters listed in "Table 2H-4: Some Parasitic Worms Common in lfumans." In a newspaper distributed at lunchtime, it would probably be untactful of me to say anything more along these lines. but I'm sure you get the idea.

White Sox win in final season opener at Comiskey Park 
CHICAGO (AP)-The Chicago White Sox opened their final season at 80-year-old Comiskey Park with a victory, beating the Milwaukee Brewers 2-1 Monday on Scott Fletcher's sacrifice fly in the seventh inning. 
The White Sox. who lost their first game at Comiskey 2-0 to the St. Louis Browns in 1910, will move across the street to a new stadium next year. A crowd of 40,008 at the 43,931­seat ballpark sat through a 42­minute rain delay at the start of the game and saw the White Sox win. 
With the score tied at 1, Robin Ventura drew a leadoff walk from loser Tony Fossas in the seventh. Sammy Sosa bunted, and Ventura beat first baseman Greg Brock's throw to second. 
After Ozzie Guillen bunted into a forceout at third, Lance Johnson's infield hit loaded the bases. Fletcher followed with his go-ahead sacrifice fly. 
Barry Jones, 1-0, pitched 1 2­3 innings. Bobby Thigpen, Chicago's fifth pitcher, got two outs for a save.

Hurst eventually recovered to post a 15-11 record and a 2.69 ERA, but a slow start left his team in a hole, and despite a late season rally, the Padres were never able to catch the Giants, who cruised to the National League West title. 
The two Giant wallbangers, meanwhile, had banner sea­sons. Clark finished second in league batting at .333 and drove in 111 runs, while Mitchell batted .291 with 47 homers and 125 RBis, good enough for National League MVP. 
That same day 45-year-old Tommy John allowed just two runs in seven innings as New York Yankees opened their sea­son with a 4-2 win in Minnesota. John, who had not been invited to spring training, proved he still had some of his old stuff as he beat the Twins' Frank Viola, who had won the Cy Young Award the previous year, for his 287th career vic­tory. 
Little else went right for the Yankees last year, though. Their team ERA ballooned to 
4.50 as they finished fifth in the AL East. Viola, meanwhile, was traded to the New York Mets in the middle of the season, bol­stering a team which already had pitching staff but couldn't match the heart of the Chicago Cubs, who captured the NL East flag. 
In Cincinnati, 55,385 fans cel­ebrated Opening Day by chant­ing "Pete! Pete!" Reds owner Marge Schott planted a kiss on Charlie Hustle's cheek. 

"I guess my favorite thing is just the fact that baseball's started again," Rose told the Associated Press at the time. 
Baseball is starting again this year, but Pete will not be a part of it. 
The defending World Series champs from Los Angeles were in town to play the Reds that day. The 6-4 score was unchar­acteristically high for the Dodgers to open a season in which they allowed very few runs but usually scored even few1 But the resulting tally in the s column would become all tt familiar.

Clemens held the Tigers hit­less until Tony Phillips singled to start the sixth inning, and allowed three hits, struck out five and walked two. He retired the first two batters in the sev­enth and then left the game after throwing 101 pitches. 
"With all the opening day ex­citement, I got fired up the same as everyone else," Clemens said. "I threw the ball pretty well, but I overthrew a little at times." 
Boggs got the first hit of the season and finished 3-for-4 with a walk. His leadoff single in the first inning helped set up Dwight Evans' three-run double off Jack Morris, and Boggs 
any other team in baseball, av­eraging just 3.42 scores per game. Kirk Gibson, who had delivered the dramatic game­winning home run in game one of the Series, began his season with an RBI single in the first inning and a solo homer in the fifth. 
Like the rest of the Dodgers, however, Gibson had little to look forward to for the rest of the season. He finished with a .213 batting average and just 28 ribbies in 2!1~ at bats. The

LOS ANGELES-Free agent llubie Brooks broke up Bruce Hurst's no-hit bid in the seventh inning and hit a three-run homer in the eighth that rallied the Los Angeles Dodgers over the San Diego Padres 4-2 Monday in the delayed season opener. 
Brooks, who left Montreal after last season, lined the first pitch from Hurst over the left-field fence with two outs, driv­ing home Alfredo Griffin and Willie Randolph. 
Winner John Wetteland al­lowed one run in two innings. He relieved starter Orel Hershiser, who gave up one run on three hits in six innings. Don Aase blanked the Padres in the ninth to earn the save. 
Hurst wound up with a four-hitter. The 32-year-old left-hander walked two and struck out one.

The only thing any of this proves is that as baseball be­gins anew, there are bound to be surprises. There is still hope, even for the Chicago White Sox, whose diehard fans would love to see them win a pennant in their rast season at Comiskey Park. Like the fans of the other 26 major league teams, they dream of a shining season.

Softball finishes 5-1 for weekend, wins St. Francis lnv. 
By RICHARD MATHURIN 
Sports Writer 
The Note Dame softball team completed a very successful but grueling six games in a three­day schedule, compiling a 5-1 record. 
On Friday, the team played a doubleheader on the road ver­sus St. Louis. The Billikens took the controversial first game 3-2 in 10 innings. Megan Fay gave the Irish the early lead at 1-0 with her and the team's first home run of the season. Pitcher Missy Linn held the lead until the seventh, when she walked in the tying run on a 3-2 pitch. The teams stayed tied and went to extra innings. 
In the top of the 10th, Debbie Boulac singled home Laurie Sommerlad to give Notre Dame the lead again. In the bottom of the lOth, St. Louis scored two runs on a bases-loaded single to win the game. Controversy followed, though. because Irish catcher Amy Folsom apparently tagged out the final runner on a close play at the plate, but the umpire ruled the runner safe. Linn went the entire 10 innings and suffered the loss to move her record to 5-5. 
"It's a shame to lose a game that way because we played so 

Navratilova says Capriati is for real 
HILTON HEAD ISLAND, S.C. (AP)-Martina Navratilova likes what she sees-on and off the court-in 14-year-old Jennifer Capriati. 
"The thing that impresses me the most is her pace and her poise," Navratilova said. "But· when you're 14, you don't know any better. You just hit the ball as hard as you can. 
"If it goes in. great. If it doesn't, oh well. you've got 15 years ahead of you. So it's not that big a deal when you miss."

tory at the number six spot, and Ann Bradshaw snaring a win at number five. 
Most of Notre Dame's singles losses came through narrow, three-set showdowns, and Louderback cited his team's lack of experience with close contests as a deciding factor in the loss. 
"We haven't had a really tight match lately, and that hurt us," said the coach. "When you have them a lot, you get used to them, but when you don't, you get a little tense and it's a little tougher to play. We got into a tight match with them and we didn't play well." 
The Irish will face their last big test of the season this Thursday, when they travel to Ann Arbor to take on the University of Michigan.

After hearing Capriati refer to her as a legend, Navratilova called her young opponent a le­gend-in-the-making. Navratilova said Capriati is "more polished" at this stage than Steffi Graf, ranked No. 1 in the world, or Andrea Jaeger

fast, she forces people to hit her pitch." 
On Saturday the Irish moved to Joliet, Illinois to compete in the St. Francis Invitational. 
In the first game, the Irish blanked Wisconsin-Parkside 2­0, behind the four-hit, six-strikeout performance of Linn (6-5). Fay paced the Irish on offense with a triple and two RBis. Wisconsin-Parkside was ranked second in the preseason NAJA rankings. 
Alford (7-5) was at it again in the second game as she blanked St. Francis 1-0 with a two-hitter. Alford struck out six, walked none, and had a no­hitter through 4 2/3 innings. Fay again provided the offense spark for the Irish, driving in the only run with an RBI triple. St. Francis was the NAJA champion in 1988. 
"Pitching normally dominates fast pitch softball, so you have a lot of one-run, two-run games," said Boulac. 
On Sunday, in what for all purposes was the championship game of the tournament, the Irish faced Mt. Mercy College, which also had won its two games in the tournament. The Irish pulled out a 3-2 victory.

Freshman Erion Kelly was making her first start of the season for the Irish. She yielded only four hits, but tired in tho fourth, allowing two runs to Mt. Mercy. She gave way to ace Alford, who proceeded to shut the door, pitching the remaining 3 1/3 innings for tho win. She gave up only one hit and no runs to move her record to 8-5. Boulac drove in Carson with a single for Notre Dame's first run. Co-captain Kathy Vernetti delivered a clutch two­run single to give the Irish the lead for good at 3-2. 
"Erion Kelly started tho game and I wanted to win it for her. I tried to take the ball to right field and it dropped in," said Vernetti, describing her winning hit. 
The Irish travel to Depaul on Wednesday to face the Blue Demons. Again, the Irish will go with Linn and Alford in the doubleheader. The Blue Demons are 11-3 and defeated Notre Dame in all three meet­ings last year. 
"The Depaul and Detroit games are very important for us. If we can win them, we will be in the right frame of mind going into the MCC tourna­ment," said Boulac.

Expect unexpected during Opening Day 
Take me out to the ballgame. 
As Opening Day results come in, you can't help but wonder what the base­ball season has in stock for America besides watered-down beer and cool summer nights at the ballpark. The nightmare of an impending strike is behind us now; it's time to play ball, and you need only look at last year's Opening Day to realize that only the Ken Tysiacunexpected should be expected. 

On Opening Day last year, the W ld f S rt 
Baltimore Orioles, who had been the or 0 po S laughingstock of the league the prev­ious year, went up against fiery Roger Clemens and the Boston Red Sox. Clemens was expected to shut the Orioles down in their first outing of the year, but Frank Robinson's ballclub had other ideas. 
The Orioles rallied to defeat the Sox 5-4 in 11 innings, making their first stride in a season which had them in a pennant race until their final series of the season. Baltimore's complete reversal from a 54-107 record the previous year was nothing short of incredible. As for Clemens, he had a subpar season, going 17-11 as Boston finished third in the American League East. 
The following day Bruce Hurst, who had been 18-6 for Boston in 1988, made his San Diego Padre debut against the San Francisco Giants. Hurst became the first of many vic­tims of the one-two Giant tandem of Will Clark and Kevin Mitchell. The San Francisco sluggers smashed consecutive home runs in a six-run third inning as the Giants cruised to an 8-3 victory.
