Politicians warn against swap of Lebanese hijack suspect

BONN, West Germany ­Prominent politicians cau­tioned officials Monday against swapping a Lebanese suspect in the 1985 TWA hijacking for a West German abducted in Beirut. They said a trade would inspire more terrorist attacks. 
Government spokesmen in Bonn played down reports that the kidnapping in Beirut of businessman Rudolf Cordes was aimed at forcing the release of Mohammed Ali Hamadi, accused of being one of the terrorists who seized the jetliner in June 1985. 
A U.S. Navy diver on the plane was shot to death at Beirut airport after the jet was commandeered during a flight from Rome to Athens. 
Hans Stercken, chairman of Parliament's foreign affairs committee, said in a radio in­terview: "Those who are aware of the tendency toward terrorist acts in the Middle East know that the acceptance of blackmail increases the chances of new acts." 
The Justice Ministry said Hamadi's extradition to the United States would be accom­plished quickly. It had been delayed pending a pledge from the Americans not to apply the death penalty if Hamadi is con­victed. West Germany does not have a death penalty. 
Foreign Ministry officials renewed a warning against traveling to Lebanon and urged the approximately 200 West Germans living there to leave. 
Hamadi, 22, was arrested last Tuesday at the Frankfurt airport after arriving from Beirut. U.S. officials have asked that he be extradited to stand trial in an American court. 
Authorities said he was iden­tified by fingerprints as one of those who seized the TWA aircraft June 14, 1985, shot Navy diver Robert Stethem to death and held 39 American passengers hostage for 17 days. 
Gunmen seized Cordes, 53­year-old Beirut manager of West Germany's Hoechst chemical company, after he ar­rived in the Lebanese capital Saturday from Frankfurt. 
Friedheim Ost, chief govern­ment spokesman, said the kid­nappers had not identified

Snowstorms blamed for 30 deaths 
Associated Press 
A snowstorm blamed for at least 30 deaths plowed across the Midwest on Monday with more snow and ice, shutting down several Indiana counties after stranding hundreds of travelers and closing schools across the Plains states. 
Winter storm warnings were up for parts of Missouri, Illi­nois, Indiana, Ohio, New York state and Pennsylvania, and a winter storm watch was ex­tended for all of Massachu­5etts. 
Heavy rain along the storm's 5outhern edge caused flooding :md washed out tracks that derailed 35 cars of a freight train in Alabama. 
In the storm's wake, Okla­homa dug out after one of its worst snowstorms in decades, and New Mexico's National Guarri continued hauling sup­plies to rural residents snow­bound by up to 50 inches of snow and 7-foot drifts. 
Slippery roads and blowing and drifting snow in Indiana led officials in six counties to close roads to all but emergency vehicles Monday. Chalmers had 10 inches of snow by mid­day. 
Travelers had to wait out the storm at truck stops, churches and restaurants in Oklahoma and northwestern Texas. 
"But these Yankees aren't too pleased with Oklahoma's snow removal," said Linda Kelly, owner of a restaurant and motel at El Reno. "I keep telling them this is the worst we've had since the 1970s and it doesn't justify the expense of buying those snow plows when we don't get snow like this."

Nation celebrates Martin Luther King Day 
Associated Press 
The Liberty Bell's peals echoed across the nation and across the sea Monday as Americans marched, prayed and sang "We Shall Over­come" in honor of Martin Lut­her King and his dream of ra­cial justice on the day that bears his name. 
Coretta King, widow of the slain civil rights leader, stood at his grave in Atlanta with Secretary of State George Shultz and black leaders as a wreath of red and yellow flowers was placed at his crypt. 
In Philadelphia, Samuel Pierce, secretary of Housing and Urban development, tapped the Liberty Bell at 12:30 
p.m. EST, triggering the pealing of replicas in state capitols across the United States and in London at Parli­ament's Big Ben. 
"Let us reaffirm the wisdom of Martin Luther King's mis­sion, the righteousness of his message, the glory of his cause," Pierce said. "Let us conduct our lives in relentless pursuit of his dream." 
In Denver, memorial ser­vices, flower plantings at a King statue in City Park and a downtown march were sched­uled. In Maine, a gospel choir recital, memorial services and a candlelight march were planned on college campuses. 
"This is not a 'black' event. This is an American holiday, black and white," Gov. Arch Moore said at a ceremony in Charleston, W.Va., where par­ticipants sang "We Shall Over­come." 

Martin Luther King Day came less than 48 hours after blacks and whites marching in Georgia's all-white Forsyth County were pelted with rocks and bottles by a crowd of Ku Klux Klansmen and their sup­porters. Mrs. King and other civil rights leaders on Monday said another march will be held there Saturday. 
It was nearly a month after a gang of white youths in New York City attacked and beat three black men, chasing one to his death when he ran onto a road and was hit by a car. 
The day was a holiday for federal workers, employees of the District of Columbia and most of the 40 states that cele­brated the second observance of Martin Luther King Day. Some states honor King on his birthday, Jan. 15. 
Financial markets were open, but the New York Stock Exchange observed a minute of silence at noon. Schools, banks and government offices in some states were closed. 
King, a Baptist preacher awarded the 1964 Nobel Peace Prize for his civil rights lead­ership, was born in 1929. He was shot to death in 1968 by a sniper on the second floor of the Lorraine Motel in Memphis, Tenn., where he was staying while he helped lead a sanita­tion workers strike. 
About 200 people gathered Monday at the motel. 
terstate 40 west of Oklahoma City remained very hazardous Monday, and Kelly said only one lane was open in each di­rection. 
About 200 schools and col­leges were closed in Oklahoma, and schools also were closed in parts of Texas, Missouri and Indiana. Indiana State Univer­sity at Terre Haute shut down. Some schools remained closed in New Mexico, where four counties were declared dis­aster areas after up to 50 inches of snow. 
Cars and trucks were forced to stop along Interstate 70 in Missouri during the night be­cause of reduced visibility in blowing snow, the National Weather Service said. Colum­bia got 10 inches of snow.

In Brief 

Barb Osborne was pleased when her husband was appointed to the new Montana Lottery Commission, until she learned of a new rule in effect this summer. Because her husband, retired Cascade County Sheriff Glenn Osborne, is on the panel, neither Mrs. Osborne nor other family members can collect any lottery winnings. "I imagine we can purchase as many tickets as we want," said her husband. "We just can't cash them in if we win. That doesn't sound like too much fun, does it?" -The Observer 
A hamlet named Amboy in south-central Nebraska is in the midst of a veritable population explo­sion. Only seven people in two families lived here two years ago, but now there are 21 residents in five families, reports resident Rick Michaelsen. Although it's never been official, residents agree the 104-year-old settlement is a community. Michaelsen has been appointed police chief and Wayne Marget is the supervisor because the well shutoff valve is near his house. -The Observer

Mother/Daughter beauty pageant demonstrates conformity at worst 
It was unbelievable. Simply unbelievable. 
Over break some friends and I were watching TV, flipping the channels around, and we came upon a beauty pageant. 
We knew something was strange right off the bat. There were all these incredibly tall, skinny women in sequined evening gowns parading around the stage -not unusual for a beauty pageant -but they were parading around in pairs, holding each other's hands. 
Was it a pageant for lesbians? No way. This was prime-time network television. No, this spectacle was something else. It was a mother­daughter Miss America pageant, or something along those lines. I never caught the pageant's official name. I was too busy spewing invective at the screen. 
When we tuned in, the judges were trying to choose five couples as finalists, a formidable task considering not only that each mother looked exactly like her daughter, but each entry looked exactly like each other entry as well. It was hard to tell who was the mother and who 
was the daughter because none of the mothers seemed to have put on an ounce of middle-aged weight or gained a single wrinkle to marr their youthful complexions. All the mothers must have been about 16 years old when they gave birth to their daughters. 
The worst part came after the five finalists were announced. Each couple gave a little talk about what they respected most about each other which, you might guess, was absolutely sickening. 
Again, each entry said exactly the same thing as each other entry. The mother's sentimental and pre-recorded words about her daughter were intoned over the loudspeakers as the daughter stepped forward to pose. Each and every mother assumed the same solid, mea­sured tone with just a touch of emotion, calcu­lated to display some sort of American ideal of motherly wisdom when describing what a joy her daughter has been to her and how extremely proud her child has made her. 
Then the daughter stepped back to allow the mother the spotlight as the daughter's words were intoned to the audience. Each and every daughter spoke as if she were choked by emo­tion and on the verge of tears when talking about how much respect she has for her terrific mother. 
It was so fake I couldn't stand it. 
Then came the really hard part for the finalists. They had to answer a question! Each pair was interviewed personally by the emcee, who explained that the contestants were given

I

March of Dimes Fight Birth Defeas 

the question two weeks in advance in order to prepare for this very moment. The question? What is unique about your relationship with your mother/daughter. I think I would need two weeks to think about that, too. 
The worst part about the pageant though was what it says about American society and its conformity complex. The pageant says that American women should be 8 feet tall and weigh 90 pounds. It says the ideal mother/ daughter relationship smells like roses, devoid of conflict or jealousies and full of mutual respect and understanding. The pageant displayed an American tendency to mold reality into what it conceives should reign in the world, like paint­ing the faces of the dead with makeup for an open-casket -a denial of what's natural in life. 
What's natural in life is that mothers are dif­ferent from daughters. They are older and con­sequently have different perspectives and needs. There do exist conflicts. A daughter is often a mirror of a mother, and a mother in­evitably must sometimes feel a sense of per­sonal loss when she sees her child living a life of youth that she will never have again. "Terms of Endearment" stuff. 
But not according to the mother-daughter Miss America pageant. In their version of reality, mothers stay young forever and daughters adore them for their guidance and wisdom. Sounds like a good deal to me. I'm game. But I'm not sure I can convince my own mother to get a face lift and lose 30 pounds before next year's contest. And I know I can't grow 6 inches in a year. But I guess we'll have to find a way. Otherwise, I'll just be so embar­rassed at the pageant next year...

Senate agrees to plan alcohol awareness week 
BY CHRIS JULKA Copy Editor 
The student senate agreed to sponsor an upcoming alcohol awareness week in a meeting in Hayes Healy last night. 
Titled "Friends Keep Friends Alive," the event will start this Saturday and con­tinue through Wednesday of next week, according to Vince Willis, general manager of Theodore's and vice president of the local branch of BAC­CHUS, a nationwide organiza­tion urging responsible drink­ing. 
The program will begin with a training session on Saturday and Sunday, aimed at the Freshman Advisory Council, whose purpose will be to "teach responsible attitudes about al­cohol and how to lead group dis­cussions," said Willis. 
Following this, an opportu­nity will be provided to observe the effects of alcohol consump­tion on volunteers in the pres­ence of members of campus se­

curity and the state police. "It's going to involve security coming into six dorms or build­ings and helping someone drink some beers and monitoring them," said Willis. "Then they're going to show the ef­fects of what drinking does even when you think you're OK." 
The activity is planned to take place at 10 p.m. in Stan­ford, Keenan and Walsh halls on Monday, in Zahm and Alumni halls on Tuesday, and in Flanner Hall and "hopeful­ly" Lafortune on Wednesday, said Willis. 
In each instance, he said, two, volunteers over the age of twenty-one will be allowed to raise their blood-alcohol con­tent to or above 0.1 percent, the level at which one is legally in­toxicated in the state of In­diana. Campus security and state police will monitor the volunteers, possibly while con­ducting field tests and present­ing slides, according to Willis.

"First we have to get the doc­uments, then we have to wait for the court's decision," he told reporters. "Only then can we legally extradite him. 
"When we do get the docu­ments, then it can go very fast. It is in our interest to do it as fast as possible. We are under obligation to fulfill the terms of the treaty between the U.S. and the West German government as quickly as possible."

Capacity crowd hears feminist criticism talk 
By ROB HENNIG Senior Staff Reporter 
Feminist criticism can be 
divided into two separate fac­
tions, each with its own as­
sumptions and strategies, ac­
cording to a lecture by Sandra 
Gilbert and Susan Gubar Mon­
day night. 
Speaking before a packed li­brary auditorium with ,...a closed-circuit television hook­up in the library lounge to accompany the overflow crowd, Gilbert and Gubar said that feminist criticism "is very much a product of the central intellectual currents that have shaped modern western thought even while we also believe that such criticism in­evitably seeks to disrupt the very traditions that have formed it." 
According to Gilbert, the categories of the mirror and the lamp detail the modes of inquiry of most feminist theorists. 
The mirror is used as a sym­bol of a primarily empirical viewpoint on feminist criticism. Critics supporting this view, said Gilbert, "define the function of criticism at the present time as the mirroring -the transcription -of a know­able history constituted by real authors, real readers, and ob­jectively verifiable cultural conditions."

Notre Dame values lead to foundation of group 
Five of the ten American founders of International Physicians for the Pre­vention of Nuclear War (IPPNW)-the 1985 Nobel Peace Prize winner -were Notre Dame graduates. Is this chance, or is there something about Notre Dame which led us, and is likely to lead future graduates, to make a special contribution toward decreasing the threat of nuclear war? 
James Muller 
guest column 

During my years at Notre Dame (1961 to 1965) the nuclear threat was not a topic of study but Notre Dame nurtured two values which I believe led me and my colleagues to work for IP­PNW when the challenge presented it­self. First, as Notre Dame graduates we expected to perform public service, in addition to working for our families and careers. Second, the Christian value of hope, strengthened during my years by the arrival of Ara Parseghian, gave us the feeling that no problem was too big to be solved. The Notre Dame of 1965 also gave me an excellent start on the Russian language. 
It was not until my second year at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine that the nuclear threat became a per­sonal reality. The lectures of Dr. Jerome Frank, my experience with burned patients in the emergency room, and my selection as the first medical exchange student to the Soviet Union, together with my Notre Dame background, left me convinced that a major purpose of my life would be to work against the nuclear arms race. As the Soviet nuclear missiles rolled past me in Red Square, I thought of the ways in which Soviets and Americans could work together in medicine to decrease the nuclear threat. But when I returned home I found few were over­tly concerned with the nuclear threat. 
By 1978, I was married, the father of three children and beginning my career as an academic cardiologist when Pres­ident Carter began advocating the MX missile and George Bush and Ronald Reagan began talking about winning a nuclear war. I approached a teacher of mine, Dr. Bernard Lown, with the thought that we should attempt to hold a conference with our Soviet medical colleagues to present a unified medically-based assessment of the facts about nuclear war. Dr. Lown wrote to his personal friend, Dr. Eugene Chazov, the chief physician for the Soviet leadership. When Dr. Chazov and his colleagues agreed to the details of our proposal in December of 1980, we felt the movement of historic im­portance could begin, if we took the proper steps. I recall praying in a hospi­tal chapel that we be given the strength to fulfill our enormous mission, and writing Father Hesburgh for his help (in that order). 
During the next four years the move­ment grew in size from three Soviet and three American physicians to over 130,000 physicians from over 30 nations. Presentation of the medical facts led government leaders to state that nu­clear war could not be won (although nuclear strategists continue to plan for a limited nuclear war) and strengthened the public demand for an end to the arms race (although it con­tinues unabated). After IPPNW advo­cated the positions, the USSR supported a nuclear freeze, adopted a no-first-use policy and initiated a unilateral 18 month halt of all nuclear explosions. 
In 1984 I left my position as Secretary of IPPNW-I was exhausted, my family had sacrificed greatly for the cause and I was about to lose my position at the Harvard Medical School because of failure to publish. No tired Notre Oame lineman has ever been happier than I to be replaced by a fresh, talented and dedicated Notre Dame teammate. Dr. John Pastore, who continues as Secre­tary of IPPNW brought enormous skills to the position and had the thoughtful­ness to call me early in the morning when IPPNW won the Nobel Peace Prize. 
The primary accomplishment of IP­PNW was to awaken the world to the problem of nuclear war. As a moun­taineer sees the full task ahead after climbing a foothill, it has become ap­parent to me that the solution to the problem requires more than adoption of a specific treaty, more than a reduc­tion of arsenals and more than im­provement in US-USSR relations. Nu­clear weapons leave no option other than the eventual abolition of war with development of a world order in which law governs relations between nations. 
To the general values of commitment an hope which we experienced 20 years ago, the Notre Dame of 1987 adds the academic power of specific courses and degrees about the new world order which it required. It was not a coin­cidence that the five of us who attended Notre Dame some years ago helped found IPPNW, nor will it be by chance that some of you will play a crucial role in the eventual solution of the nuclear dilemma. 
Dr. James Muller is a Notre Dame graduate and Co-Founder of IPPNW. 

P.O.BoxQ 
Some professors show excellence in teaching 
Dear Editor: 
I am intrigued by Jeff Woode's letter to the Observer in which he voiced his disillusionment with the quality of some members of the Notre Dame faculty. Being a freshman I have only had the opportunity to attend classes here for one semester, but during this short time my experience has been widely differ­ent from his. 
Three of my classes are taught by full professors .In two of these, German 101 and Chern 125, the classes are no bigger than the size of a typical high school class. Not many colleges could claim that about their freshman classes. 
Granted, being a full professor does 
Doonesbury 
not make one a great teacher, but my professors inject an enthusiasm to their classes which, in my opinion, has a def­inite effect on their students' level of motivation. Even my Freshman Semi­nar teacher, almost a doctorate him­self, keeps his class lively and interest­ing, something not easy to maintain for 75 minutes each class. 
I am sorry that Woode has come across a few "weak links" in his stay at Notre Dame. I am not attempting to minimize his bad experiences here -I merely offer that not everybody believes the University is "lax in its concern for our education." If my classes thus far are any indication of the quality of faculty here, then I am anticipating a challenging and reward­ing course of studies under the Dome.

Facts should establish alcohol policy's guilt 
Dear Editor: 
In response to Kevin Trautner and Sean O'Brien's letter concerning the al­cohol policy I must say with some regret that people who can easily blame a policy as such for traffic fatalities may be just as ignorant as drunk drivers themselves. The key word here is ignorance. Give me, as well as the rest of this university, cold hard facts to show that the alcohol policy is to blame and I'm sure the administration will change it. But until you've com­pleted your study I'll speculate that drunk driving fatalities are caused more by ignorance than by anything else.

What O'Brien and Trautner, as well as others that gripe and moan, must realize is that conscious decisions are made by people to drink and drive even, at times, under altered states of mind. Yet, those decisions are made, those people are responsible for them. Obvi­ously, O'Brien and Trautner are not aware of the problem, for if they were, their letter would have more thought in it.

Medievalist spotlights Paris students 
Special to The Observer 
Early Hungarian ties to the West are revealed in a new book by a University of Notre Dame medievalist who explores the life of Hungarian students and masters at the University of Paris in late 15th and early 16th Cen­turies. 
The book. "The University of Paris and its Hungarian Students and Masters During the Reign of Louis X and Francis I," is by Prof. Astrik L. Gabriel, director emeritus of the Medieval In­stitute at the University. 
Hungarian subjects studying at the University of Paris were part of the English-German na­tion, the term "nation" signifying the tribe or clan to which an in­dividual belonged. The foreign students in this nation came from northern and central Europe, as well as from England, Scotland and Ireland. Relying on unpublished material on the English-German nation, Gabriel reconstructs the intellectual con­political and historical events of flow of students to Paris was cut tacts of Hungarians with out­the time, including the plagues off. standing German, English, of 1501-1502 and 1522 to which Gabriel, an expert In the his­Dutch, Scotch,and Irish scholars Hungarian students were ex­tory of medieval education, has of the time.

Undefeated Hawkeyes take number-one spot in AP Poll 
UNLV falls to fourth slot after 89-88 loss to Oklahoma 
Associated Press Iowa replaced Nevada-Las Vegas, one-point losers at Okla­homa this weekend, as the No. 1 team in The Associated Press' college basketball poll, ending the Runnin' Rebels' six­week run as the top-ranked team. Iowa, 16-0, took the No. 1 ranking for the first time in its history as the Hawkeyes received 34 first-place votes and 1,263 points from the nationwide panel of sportswriters and broadcasters. The Hawkeyes edged North Carolina for the No. 1 spot as the Tar Heels, 15-1, received 28 first-place votes and 1,252 points. Indiana, 14-1, was third with 1,133 points, while Nevada-Las Vegas, which got three first-place votes, had 1,088 points. Iowa's only game last week was its impressive 91-88 over­time victory at then-No. 8 Illi­nois in which the Hawkeyes erased a 22-point second-half deficit. The Runnin' Rebels' first loss of the year came at Norman, Okla. as the Sooners prevailed 89-88 in the nationally televised game. Nevada-Las Vegas had a chance at pulling out the road victory but two shots in the final seconds wouldn't fall and

Notre Dame Communication and Theatre F"Ilm Series 
Tuesday and Friday at the Snite, the springfilm series has two great films 
Tuesday, January 20 at 7:30pm Carefree (1938) BW, 80 min. Directed by March Sandrich, USA 
Madcap Ginger Rodgers goes to psychiatrist Fred Astaire in this wacky musical comedy with outstanding Irvin Berlin numbers in which the cure is true love. Here the Astair&'Rodgers series is inflected by the screwball comedy to produce a musical that is funnier than ever. 
Friday, January 23 at 7:30 and 9:30 pm Hannah and Her Sisters (1986) Color, 100 min. Directed by Woody Allen 
By all accounts, one of Woody Allen's greatest films and the best film of 1986, this is one of the film's last college showings before it is pulled from distribution to wait for the academy awards and theatrical re-release. Both a drama about three sisters and their romantic entanglements and a satirical comedy about lV producer Allen's fears that he may have a fatal disease, Hannah is Allen's first real audience film since Annie Hall. With Michael Caine, Mia Farrow, Carrie Fischer, and Barbara Hershey. 
All shown at the Annenberg Auditorium, Snite Museum. Individual admission $1.50. Series tickets also available. Film calendars will be coming in the first issue of Scholastic Magazine. Or pick up a copy in 320 O'Shaughnessy or at the door at the Snite.

"McConkey has moved up to the No. 1 self-promoter on the team," said New York Giants Coach Bill Parcells. "He's passed (Jim) Burt, (Leonard) Marshall and, of course, (Sean) Landeta." 
In Parcells' mind, McConkey is getting more attention that even punter Dave Jennings got in the late 1970s and early 1980s. 
"You have to take advantage of what's put before you," said McConkey, who for $1,500 is writing a first-person column on his Super Bowl experience for a New York newspaper, has appeared on numerous radio interviews and is always avail­able for talks with the media. 
"You have to have fun doing it and you have to keep it in perspective," said the 29-year­old. "It would be foolish not to take advantage of the opportu­nity while we're here." 
McConkey's presence here for next week's NFL champi­onship in Pasadena against the Denver Broncos tends to defy all odds. A graduate of the U.S.

lao. 
Schwartz says the biggest difference between high school and college play is the defense. 
"My defense has really im­proved," Schwartz says, "but I still have a long way to go." 
She says the best aspect of her game is rebounding, and she wants her field goal percentage. 
"I'm taking enough shots, I'd just like to make more." 
Schwartz is averaging 4.3 points and 14.3 minutes of playing time per game. She had two outstanding games in Notre Dame losses to UCLA and DePaul. On Jan. 5 against the Bruins, she scored 17 points, shooting eight of 12 from the field. She also grabbed seven rebounds and had three steals. 
Last Sunday against the Blue Demons, Schwartz was six for 14 from the field and two for two from the free throw line, totalling 14 points. She had seven rebounds, all in just 20 minutes of play. 
Naval Academy, McConkey flew helicopters for four years before being allowed to leave the service because he suffered from seasickness. 
In 1983, he tried out with the Giants, but the Navy called him back to complete his five-year commitment and the team put him on a military reserve list. 
Since coming back, McConkey again has become a fan favorite. Wearing his emo­tions on his sleeve, he sprints the length of the field, throwing his fist in the air to stir up the crowd before each home game. 
Quarterback Phil Simms has ribbed McConkey about his new-found attention and tackle Brad Benson says jokingly that McConkey has been difficult to be around. 
"We went to the city (New York) the other night for an in­terview," said Benson. "Now McConkey is a helicopter pilot. He has defended our country flying for the Navy and he can't sit backwards in a limousine because he's going to get sick. 
"We expect Annie to shoot over zones for us and also pull down her share of rebounds," says DiStanislao. 
Schwartz chose Notre Dame because of the academics, the location (a three hour drive from her Ann Arbor home), the size, and the basketball pro­
gram. 
"I was expecting tough com­petition," says Schwartz of the rough Irish schedule. "I'm not surprised by the level of play." 
Schwartz says the team's slow start is not due to any lack of effort. 
"We're playing hard and doing the right thing," she says. "We can put it all to­gether, but we need one good win to get started." 
Schwartz, DiStanislao and the rest of the women's team will try to improve the Irish record as they host Cleveland State. 
"Cleveland State is a team that is going to try to press and run on us," says DiStanislao. 
The Irish take on the Vikings tonight at 7:30 at the ACC.

Dennis Conner's boat won the series, 4-1, with a victory yesterday. 
Stars &Stripes clinches chance to win the Cup 
Associated Press 
FREMANTLE, Australia-A ripped sail couldn't stop Dennis Conner from sewing up another trip to the America's Cup finals as he steered Stars &stripes to a one-minute, 29-second vic­tory Monday over once un­beatable New Zealand . 
The Kiwis had won 37 of their first 38 races and 28 straight before they ran up against Con­ner, the world's most experi­enced 12-meter skipper. In the best-of-seven Challenger finals that ended Monday, the U.S. boat whipped them 4-1. 
"Thirteen years beat 13 months experience," said New Zealand's 25-year-old skipper, Chris Dickson, who was in his first America's Cup campaign. 
New Zealand foulups -a poor spinnaker change on the fifth leg and contact with a buoy at the end of the seventh leg of the eight-leg course -were damag­ing. 
That last problem cost Dick­son 30 seconds as the rules re­quired him to reround the buoy. Conner's lead, down to nine seconds before New Zealand hit the buoy, was up to 39 seconds after it went around it again. 
Stars &Stripes, strong going into the wind, pulled away on the final leg, a windward beat, as the breeze packed a power­ful 28-knot wallop.

be bursitis, and that would be good, but they haven't ruled out an infection," said McCann. 
In last Friday's meet against Ohio State, the Irish lost, 33-6, dropping their record in dual meets to 1-4. Notre Dame had to forfeit 24 points to the Buck­eyes because injuries forced several Irish wrestlers out of the meet, and Ohio State's other nine points came on three one-point losses suffered by Notre Dame. 

"I think they expected Ohio State to be better than they were. We respected them too much. We didn't win the close matches because we didn't hustle like we should have," said McCann. "I think we as coaches might have more con­fidence in our wrestlers than they do."

fencing teams face living up to last year's precident 
By TRISH SULLIVAN Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame men's and women's fencing squads may feel like they have a lot to prove this season. 
The men's team enters the 1987 season trying to defend the NCAA title it captured last year. And the women's squad, headed by NCAA individual champion Molly Sullivan, may have revenge on its mind as it will try to improve on its second place finish in the tourn­ament. Irish eyes should keep a watch on these two teams, because from the look of things, the '87 season spells continued success. 
"We lost some very talented fencers on the men's roster," 

The Irish men's swim team 
Head Coach Mike DeCicco says. "There's no doubt that they will be difficult to replace, but I still think we will be in the running for the NCAA's again. We have a nice blend of experience and youth on the squad and I'm excited to see how the season unfolds." 
Women's head coach Yves Auriol relays the same confi­dence in his squad. "We enter this season with a good chance of winning it all. I think we have both solid individuals and good depth, and that's what it takes to have a championship team." 
Certainly after this weekend's action, both coaches seem to be right on track with their teams' assessments. The Irish squads dominated Stan­ford on Friday. registering

Wrestling faces Athletes in Action 
By STEVE MEGARGEE Sports Writer 
Tuning up for a weekend date with national powerhouse Ne­braska, the Notre Dame wres­tling team is taking a shuffled lineup into an exhibition match with Athletes in Action tonight at 7 p.m. in the ACC Pit. 
A Christian-affiliated group of former college wrestlers, Athletes in Action travels all over the United States and the world, competing against teams across the globe. 
"They're all post-graduates, and they were really great col­lege wrestlers, so it'll be pretty tough," said Head Coach Fran McCann. "They've been to Czechoslovakia, Poland, West Germany, and they wrestle the finest competition. I look at it as just some good competition for the kids." 
While Athletes in Action can use experience as a strong point, the Irish will be featuring several not-so-familiar faces in tonight's match. With sopho­more starters Jerry Durso and Chris Geneser still out with in­juries, many wrestlers are changing weight classes so Notre Dame will only have to forfeit one match in the meet. 
Senior Carl Hildinger, a three-time monogram winner at 118 pounds who has not seen much action this year, will start at 126 pounds, freshman Mike Sheets will start at 158 pounds, and Mike Crounse will start at heavyweight, marking the first time all year Notre 

Outside shooting, rebounding 
make Schwartz' future bright 
By THERESA KELLY Sports Writer 
An important member of the strong front line of the Notre Dame women's basketball team, as well as an important part of the team's future, is freshman Annie Schwartz. 
A 6-3 forward from Gabriel Richard High School in Ann Ar­bor, Mich., Schwartz has started five games for the 3-10 Irish and has performed well coming off the bench for Head Coach Mary DiStanislao. 
Schwartz' high school team was undefeated 09-0) during her senior season as she averaged 21 points and 14 rebounds per game. She also blocked 65 shots and shot 51 percent from the floor. 
"The aspects we looked at when we recruited Annie were her ability to shoot well from the perimeter and her rebound­ing instincts," says DiStanis­

wins of 22-5 for the men and 13-3 for the women. That upped each teams' remarkable win­ning streaks to 54 and 24 respectively. 
As has been the tradition with DeCicco's teams, the foilists lead the way for the Irish. DeCicco was especially pleased to see rookie fencers Derek Holeman, Joel Clark, and Colin Gumbs register their first Notre Dame wins. Return­ing All-Americans Charles Higgs-Coulthard and Yehuda Kovacs also came away with perfect slates on Friday. 
"I expect Higgs-Coulthard and Kovacs to wins bouts," DeCicco says. "But I have to admit, seeing those freshmen win their first bouts was very impressive. The foil team is

Dame has been able to compete in the heavyweight match. 
"It all depends on whether our kids are intimidated by the maturity of Atletes in Action. We have a lot of inexperience. If we're not intimidated, we can hold our own with them," said McCann. "They're con­stantly on the road, so we might be better conditioned." 
McCann hopes to have Durso and Geneser back by Saturday, the day the Irish take on Ne­braska. Durso is out because of his injured left shoulder and Geneser is having problems with his knee. 
"It's just a day to day thing with Durso's shoulder. The last report on Geneser is it might

Freshman Annie Schwartz

going to be our strength this season." 
If the foilists falter by chance, DeCicco need only turn to his talented sabre team to pick up the slack. Led by senior captain Kevin Stoutermire, the squad posted a combined 7-2 mark last weekend. Stouter­mire posted a 3-0 mark and junior Geoff Ross went 2-0 in his first time on the strip in al­most two years after missing the '86 season with a broken leg. Sophomore Tim Collins split a pair of bouts in the num­ber three slot and freshman Danny Yu won his first bout as an Irish fencer. 
The chink in the armor for the Irish may be with the inex­perienced epee team. Senior captain Tim Vaughan fenced well in the opener (2-0), but the rest of the squad struggled to a 4-3 mark. 
On the women's side, Auriol could rely on his veteran leader and some youthful back-ups to give the Irish a victory. Sul­livan once again paced the team with a 4-0 record against the Cardinal. Sophomores Janice Hynes and Kristin Kralicek, as well as freshman Anne Barreda stepped in and all registed 2-0 wins in their respective bouts. 
"I was very happy with the way we fenced against Stan­ford," Auriol says. "I am espe­cially encouraged when I look at who I have on down the roster if I need to substitute for

Swim teams emerge with mixed results 
By KELLY TOWNSEND Sports Writer 
On Sunday, the Notre Dame men's swim team completed a three-day meet schedule with a three win, one loss record. Using their team depth, the Irish kept fresh swimmers in most of the events. 
But the women's team, despite strong individual ef­forts, only managed to win one of their four meets. 
The streak for the men began on Friday night with a victory over Northern Illinois, 148-100. Lead by a strong group of frees­tyle swimmers, the Irish were able to take an early lead over the Huskies. Mike Messaglia and Roland Hartzell took first and second in the 1000-yard freestyle, while John Froman and Chris Petrillo followed it up with a one-two placing in the 200-yard freestyle. 
First and second place 
finishes were also captured by 
Eric Bohdan and Stephen Cof­
fey in the 200-yard backstroke 
and by Charles Niedhoeffer 
and Bernie Niehaus in the 200­
yard breAststroke. 
The Irish finished. off the 
meet with another one-two 
finish, this time in the 200-yard 
freestyle relay. Both four-man 
squads passed the old Rolfs 
Aquatic Center record of 
1:29.70 with times of 1:26.54 and 1:28.17. 
Coach Tim Welsh was im­pressed by the excellent perfor­mances. 
"We had a very convincing win," said Welsh. "The perfor­mances showed our team depth. With such a large team, we keep coming at them. The

Having just finished its first meet in Michigan last weekend, the Women's Track Club will participate in an invitational at Eastern Michigan this weekend that will include teams from Texas, Michigan and Villanova. 
The unusually large number of people involved in the club this season gives this year's team good reason for optimism. 
"We have about 23 people this year. Last year toward

the end of the season we traveled with five or six,"· said Club Co-President Kathy Lehman. 
While the Irish have traditionally had a fair amount of distance runners, this year's squad, led by women's cross c.ountry coach Dan Ryan, has athletes to compete in other areas as well. 
"We have some people for field events and some middle distance people and sprinters along with the long distance people we usually have from the cross country team," said Lehman. "Things look good right now. People just need to stick with it." 
Before going to its first meet this weekend, the Ski Team will hold tryouts tomorrow at Swiss Valley. see SKI, page 8
