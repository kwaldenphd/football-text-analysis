Strike, protests scheduled today 
by Mary Romer 

Plans for l<'riday's strike and Vietnam war protest 
were outlined at an afternoon meeting yesterday in La 
Fortune's Fiesta Lounge. 

Activities will begin on the J!lain quad at 10:30 a.m. 
with Mass, concelebrated by Fathers Burrell, Toohey, 
Amen, and Griffin. The entrance rite, featuring 
reflections of several people on the war, will be 
followed by a short liturgy and a homily to bedelivered 
by Dr. William Storey of the N.D. Theology Depart­
ment. According to protest leaders, the rationale 
behind the Mass is: "Not only are people dying in 
Vietnam. but we, too, are dying -here in America and 
at Notre Dame-by letting these deaths continue." 
Immediately following the Mass Ox Pedal will play 
on thequadthrough the lunch hour. Students are urged 
to show support of the strike by fasting all day Friday. 
The speaker program will begin at 1:00 p.m., in­
cluding Allen Ginsberg, visiting poet and speaker at 
the Sophomore Literary Festival, Marice Nagu of the 
Michiana Coalition for Peace and~ Justice; and Dr. 
John Houck of the College of Business Administration. 
At.3:00 a group of N.D. and St. Mary's students will 
meet on the main quad to begin a march to Leeper 
Park where they will join with students from IUSB, 
South Bend High school students and South Bend 
residents. Demonstrations will continue downtown to 
the FBI offices. Government buildings, Post Office, 
and the Draft and Recruiting offices. Those interested 
in marching are asked to bring signs and placards with 
them and to obey all traffic rules since the group has no 
parade permit. 

Allen Ginsberg will lecture again Friday night at 
8::~0 in Washington Hall. Accompanying him will be 
anti-war poetry readings and guerilla theater. 
Lincoln Soldati, who headed yesterday's meeting, 
emphasized that the strike effort will not end with 
today's activities, but will be continued in other forms. 
The Mock Convention next week will be one vehicle for 
continuing the protest. 

,In case of rain all activities prior to the demon­
stration downtown will be moved to the Student Center. 
Father Hesburgh has as yet made no comment on the 
student strike, but is expected to release a statement 
today at 1:00 p.m.

Kersten: SLC may be eliminated 
The Student Life Council,a five-year old tri-partite legislative committee created to deal with student affairs, almost lost its student representation for next year. R. Calhoun Kersten. student body president, and Floyd Kezele, SIC vice-chairman yesterday suggested that the SLC be replaced by faculty and student representation on the Board of Trustees. Until students and faculty are represented on the Board, the 
SLC would continue. 
Kersten considered cancelling next week's student election after a poll was released Thursday morning revealing much discontent among SLC members with the present Council's organization and future. 
commissioners to serve 
According to the proposed constitution for the Notre Dame student body, eight commissioners will be elected to serve as the top administrators of student government and SLC representatives. Both Kezele and Kersten hope that any student representation on the Board will come from this group. 
!<'acuity Senate President Thomas S\"artz confirmed yesterday that the faculty would elect its represen­tatives to the Council next Thursday as planned. Earlier this we.ek, he appointed an ad-hoc committee to recruit faculty nominations for the post since not enough nominations were received. 
Administrative representatives are appointed. 
At the next Council meeting, Kezele will introduce a resolution endorsing the faculty's request for representation on the Board of Trustees. In his resolution, he will also ask for similar student representation on the governing board. 
couldn't change own by-laws 
·'The SLC should not continue and cannot continue in 
its present form. It has increasingly refused to assert 
itself. It has allowed itself on many issues to become a 
rubber stamp," Kezele said. 
"Any body which cannot change its own by-laws when the need is there and has become so stagnant does not deserve to continue. It was supposed to bring all three segments together -administrators, students and faculty -however the people there are not responsive. SLC resolutions were rejected, overruled or pooh-poohed all this year," he complained. 
John Barkett, former student body president, agrees that the SLC needs overhaul, but would not dissolve the group. He believes that the membersip should be reduced from 24 to 12,have fewer meetings and have an increased workload. 
Questioned on the effectiveness of this year's SLC, William Eagan, chairman, responded, "So far this year there has been no general agreement among the members the SLC on its function. Over the long term, however. much of what the students have today is the result of the SLC . . . the liberalization of hall regulations. the ability to have cars on campus. To a large extent. student representation on the Academic Cc,uncil and the College Council reflects the ad­ministration's appraisal of having students on the SLC." 

slc effe.ctiveness 'minimal' 
"The SLC should be continued until somebody comes up with something better. I question the advisability of dropping something which has been effective in the past for nothing. The opponents have yet to offer an alternative," he said. 
David Tusher. off-campus student representative, supported the move to withdraw student represen­tation from the SLC. "Its effectiveness if anything is minimal. People go in there with too many precon­cieved ideas. It just wastes too much time on things like grammatical construction. The only positive effect I can think of is the last recommendation of the judiiclal system. But. then. we didn't discuss whether or not it would be put into action." Tushar recom­mended some type of representative committee with students and trustees. 
John Cullen, chairman of the Planning Committee 
and North Quad rep, agreed the Council didn't ac­
complish mcuh. "Meetings just broke down into 
arguments on wording and parliamentary procedure. 
1 think we need some kind of SLC but I wish it could act 
like the Academic Council and not be subject to 
.'omebody's veto. It's like spinning your wheels."

Paris---North Vietnam's chief negotiator at the Paris peace talks, formally proposing a resumption of the talks on April27, indicated tha an end of American attacks on his country was not a condition for resuming thenegotiations. Xuan Thuy, the Hanoi representative, also released his side's records of the talks leading to the 1968 "understanding". 
Washington---In a 58 page report presented to President Nixon, a Presidential panel on Nonpublic Education recommended that the Federal Government act on a variety of fronts to reduce private and parochial schools. The panel argued that aid to parents, rather than to the schools, could well be judged constitutional. 
Washington---House Democrats met at a party caucus and voted 144 to 58 to direct the House Foriegn Affairs Committee to draw legilslation providing for prompt termination of the American involvement in the Indochina war---subject only to the relel\st of prisoners of war. Their resolution called recent bombings of North Vietnam a "dangerous escalation" and also denounced North Vietnam's invasion of the South. 
Washington---Despite the troubles in space, the House overwhelmingly approved funds for the Space Agency's multi-billon dollar space shuttle program. Among the 60 dissenters were some congressmen who con­tended that the project could end up costing 60 billon dollars. Passage by the Senate is expected to be all but routine. 
New York---Twelve men and six corporations were indicted on 540 counts of wholesale promotion of obscene material in the city, ending a four month long investigation that included the brief--and unprofitable­operation by undercover policemen of a dirty book store on Eight Avenue.

Hall life aspects dominate SAC meeting 
by Bill McGinn 
The second meeting this year of the Student Affairs Committee was held yesterday April 20th at the Continuing Education Center. The Committee is composed of seven Notre Dame Trustees (Dr. Tom Carey, Jack Schneider, Jerry Van Gorkin, Paul Hellmuth, Fr. Blantz, Mr. I<'accenda, and Dan Canale), 
and four  students:  Bob  Weaver,  
John  Barkett,  Jim  O'Hara,  and  
Tim I<'eeley.  

The Committee heard reports by Bob Higgins and John Barkett, as well as participating in discussions with the hall presidents and several rectors. 
Bob Higgins, the Hall Life Commissioner, delivered a report on the need for renovation to make residence halls more liveable. Barkett reported that the Trustees' reaction was generally favorable to this report, and added that the Committee toured La Fortune Student Center. They concluded

Erratum 
Two errors appeared in yesterday's Observer concerning the protest planning meeting at Regina Hall. 
The SMC Student Government strongly supports the enumerated proposals in their statement and feels they would be most effective. 
Also, SBP Jean Seymour was quoted as attributing telephone tax to financing white phosphorous. This statement was made by another student at the meeting.

We the undersigned vehemently oppose and condemn the resumption of the bombing and the escalation of the war in VietNam. We urge support by the whole ND community including students, faculty, administration and staff for the upcoming anti-war activities this Friday. We strongly believe that one of the most im­portant activities that the university can provide at this moment is an understanding of the means and purposes practiced by our government in carrying on and intensifying this immoral war.

U.S.. N. Viet vessels exchange fire in Tonkin Gulf face~ff 
\cl Nl'w York Times 1972 

Saigon. Friday, April 21---Another encounter between North Vietnamese and American naval vessels in the Gulf of Tonkin was reported yesterday by the United states Command. 
In a delayed report, the Command said two high-speed North Viet­namese patrol boats were fired upon early Monday by the U.S. destroyer Hamner off the coat of North Vietnam's panhandle. One of the boats was believed sunk, the Command said, and the other was believed damaged. 
This incident and an attack by North Vietnamese MIG aircraft and patrol boars on American warships reoted Wednesday are cited by U.S. military analysts as evidence that North Vietnam has now begun to challenge the Americans directly in the Gulf of Tonkin for the first time since 1964. 
They have been able to do this, the analysts say, partly because American naval bombardment ofcoastal defense radar and artillery sites has been suspended from 1968 until recently and partly because it was decided in Hanoi sometime in the last year to use the MIG's more ad­

Houston, April 20-After hours of uncertainty and concern, trouble­beset Apollo 16 finally got the go-ahead and descended to a delayed but successful landing among the mountains of the moon at about 9:23p.m., 
E.S.T. tonight. 

Capt. John W. Young of the Navy and Lt. Col. Charles M. Duke of the Air Force steered their landing craft, Orion, to a sinooth touchdown on a rolling plateau surrounded by mountains, craters and volcanic-like terrain. 
Their landing-the nation's fifth in three years--was delayed nearly six hours when the command ship, piloted by Lt. Comdr. Thomas K. Mat­tingly 2nd of the Navy developed erratic oscillations of its rocket engine. These were caused by a malfunction in the spacecraft's secondary guidance system. 
Because of the delay, Young and Duke postponed until tomorrow morning their first planned excursion outside the landing craft. They are expected to begin exploring the surface at 11:30 a.m. E.S.T. 
The astronauts were never in any immediate danger. But for a time, as they discussed their problem calmly with Mission Control, it was feared that the lunar landing might have to be cancelled. 
Cancellation would have been necessary so that the lunar landing craft, still fully fueled, could have rejoined the command ship in lunar orbit and provided the rocketpower for an emergency return to earth. Even though the command ship's primary guidance system worked perfectly, mission control does not like to have astronauts circling the moon with a potentially crippled vehicle. 
The situation was not as serious as the crisis of Apollo 13 in April, 1970, when the lunar module served as the "life raft" for the return of astronauts after an explosion ripped their command ship. But the suspense was gripping, nonetheless, as flight controllers sat tensely before their consoles and engineers huddled in the back rooms over spacecraft plans. 
A quick examination of the engineering data from the spacecraft and from simulations of the problem here at the manned spacecraft center led space agency officials to order the continuation of the landing plans. They determined that even if the command ship had to use its back-up guidance system and the problem recurred, the oscillations would not be sufficient to cause structural damage to the spacecraft. 
Christopher C. Kraft. director of the manned spacecraft center, an­nounced the decision shortly after 7 p.m. E.S.T .The news was im­mediately relayed to the astronauts as they came around from behind the moon on their 15th revolution. 
"You're go for landing," Mission control told Apollo 16. There was no immediate reply from the astronauts, until they were 
asked if they were ready to receive the revised landing instructions. "I'm all ears," Duke said. The problems cropped up as Young and Duke were preparing to fire the 
lunar module's descent rocket for landing, which was originally scheduled for 3:41p.m. E.S.T. 
As they checked out the lunar module's systems, mattingly was sup­posed to fire the 20,500-pound thrust rocket in the rear of the command ship. The rocket, with a swiveled nozzle, is located in the service module. It is the same rocket that is used to thrust the space ship into and out of lunar orbit. 
The purpose of the planned firing was to circularize the command ship's orbit of the moon. From this position, Mattingly is to wait while the other two astronauts are on the moon. In checking the guidance system before the maneuver, Mattingly said that the primary system worked properly, but the secondary unit, the stabilization and control system, developed an oscillation in the Yaw Gimbal. This meant that the bell­shaped nozzle was turning left and right in an erratic manner. 
The guidance system acts as a tiller, electronically turning the gimbal to move the nozzle and thus direct the thrust vector--the direction of the rocket firing. 
Can the King really walk on water like he says? Notre Dame and St. Mary's students await with bated breath for an An Tosta I league pitcher to put him to the test... 
...and he fails. Too little 
faith? 

venturously than before, in conjunction with the communist offensive in the South. 
Precisely when the North Vietnamese began their new moves is not entirely clear because the U.S. Navy and the Command in Saigon began reporting them only this week. However the latest sequence of events aPJears to be this: 
--At 3:55 A.T' unday, while U.S. B-52's and fighter-bombers were engaged in raw" near Haiphong Har!lor, North Vietnamese patrol boats moved out into the Tonkin Gulf toward the guided missile frigate Worden. 
·frigate was fired on by mistake by American planes flying overhead, '-"ld one sailor was killed and nine were injured by two air-to-ground missiles at first thought to have been fired from enemy torpedo boats. ---Early Monday morning, off the North Vietnamese coast between the demilitarized zone and the 20th parallel, the destroyer Hamner fired on two high-speed North Vietnamese patrol boats in the incident repoted today. One of the boats disappeared from te Hamner's radar screens under fire and was believed sunk. The other was said to have raced around erratically and was believed damaged. 
--One the same day the guided missile destroyer Buchanan was hit by North Vietnamese retaliatory fire as it was firing at targets in the lower panhandle. One crewman was killed and seven were wounded, and the ship put into harbor in Danang for repairs. 
---At 5 p.m. Wednesday, two North Vietnamese supersonic MIG fighter­bombers dashed out past the coast over a group of American warships­the cruiser Oklahom City, Vice Adm. William P. Mack's Seventh Fleet Flagship, and the destroyers Higbee and Lloyd Thomas-that were bombarding costal defense sites 20 miles north of the Demilitarized Zone. A bomb from one of the planes scored a direct hit on the after gun turret of the Higbee, wounding three sailors and destroying the gun mount. Another ship, the guided missile frigate Sterett, show to down a MIG with a Terrier missile and also fired on North Vietnamese patrol boats in the area, sinking two of them.

Symposium criticizes education 

by Stt>ve Lazar 
In a wide-ranging, anything but 
esoteric symposium yesterday, poets Robert Duncan, Allen Gin­sberg and Diane Wakoski "talked to each other" before an overflow audience in the Library 
Auditorium. 
Master of ceremonies, Dan 
O'Donnell. opened the discussion 
with a question on the relationship 
between a University education 
and the practice of poetry. 
Returning again and again to this 
topic of Academia, the poets first 
of all discussed whether their 
educations were beneficial or 
harmful to their growth as poets. 
Stating that he discovered early 
that he would not learn to write 
poetry in the University, Robert 
Duncan explained how he dropped 
out of school. but returned to study 
his true interest: human history. 
Duncan stated that "all education 
d(les is tell you shouldn't read this 
and Y'lU should read that." On the 
qucshon of learning to write 
poetry, Duncan proposed an 
alternative to th educational 
system: 
"An august poet, Ben Johnson, 
tells you exactly how to learn to be 
a poet: pick the biggest, most 
wonderful poetry you can imagine, 
strive to write it; call it brother 
and name yourself as belonging to 
it; and don't chicken out because it 
doesn't look like brother. Realize 
that you've been called and you 
really are of that order, and then 
your other orders ... No university 
knows that. I mean they give you a 
model or something, and you 
actually belong to a family." 
Duncan summarized the true 
benefit of his college years by 
stating that during that time he 
met the members and character of 
his own generation. 
With a different point of view on 
the academy, Diane Wakoski

The national chairman of the Democratic Party, Lawrence O'Brien, will give the keynote talk to more than 1.000 student ddegates on Tuesday night, and Allard Lowenstein. chairman of Americans for Democratic Action and a congressional candidate from New York, will speak Wednesday night.

Six convention sessions, with ,..vening meetings through Thur­.;day at 7 and afternoon sessions Tuesday and Wednesday at 2:30, will closely follow rules for the national conventions. Hepresentatives from the 55 state and territorial delegations will be appointed to platform, rules and credentials committees, and nomination demonstrations will be limited. 
Each of the present Democratic candidates will be represented by delegates at the convention. At least some of the delegates for­merly pledged to Mayor Lindsay or Sen. Hartke are reportedly attempting to start a "Draft Ted Kennedy" movement.

stated: "I feel like college is just like anything else for a poet today; it's all a question of the will. In a 
sense we use whatever we do; and maybe in a sense my attitude towards poetry is almost fatal; and maybe I have the same fatalistic attitude toward life. But I don't mean that in the nineteenth century sense of fatalism; I simply mean that in some way we accept the life that's given to us and come to terms with it in whatever human way is possible. And I don't see how anything could ever destroy a writer, because what he's doing is coming to terms with what life is all about; and maybe that destruction is part of it. Probably by coming to terms with it -writing about it-whatever else he does -it won't destroy him. I don't see how a university experience could be different from that." 
Ms. Wakoski said that the real experiences of life have nothing to do with the academy or the office or anything official or institutional. 
"But that's everybody's lesson and I don't think the poet is any diferent," she said. 
Allen Ginsberg related a tale to the audience of how he was once suspended from Columbia University for writing obscenities on a dusty window. Later, when he began to work on a novel for a

Ginsberg stated: "The point of all this discourse is that any literary activity that I found valid at Columbia in the mid 40's was banned from campus. The

'panionship, and went so far as to d~lare Kerouac, who was my tead\er and is a major American poet an_d prose writer to be an unwholesome influence on students. I don't think that situation has changed in the American Universities." Gin­sberg went ol\ to say that in the last 5 years a large number of teachers who have been involved in some form of social or spiritual activism have been pushed out of positions of power and influence in the universities. He concluded from his own experiences that the university is not a very "en­couraigng" place for artists. 
On the subject of where does a 
person go -to the classroom, workshop or otherwise -when he wants to learn to write poetry, Robert Duncan suggested that the educational system has many limitations. He felt that classroom and workshop endeavors to write poetry were harmful because they generally imposed deadlines for the completion of the works. "A poem shouldn't be a pro.iect that you turn in like a blue book:' said Dunca. He did admit, however, that a classroom writing  ex­perience could give a young poet exercise in learning to handle language. 
Diane Wakoski suggested that although the University "may not have fostered poetry in the best sense" it did provide a forum for poets and the best audience for poetry, which is available in this country,

Duncan agreed that the university often does bring poets 
, together, but he maintained that the only wav a man learns poetry is from another poet. Oftentimes, he stated, poet-teachers are not to be found at universities, and he cited his won experiences where he had to hitchike a great distance to visit poet Ezra Pound. 
Allen Ginsberg also made a similar "pilgrimage" recently, this time to Australia to visit Aborigine "songmen". Explaining that the songmen maintain one of the oldest poet traditions in the world, with verse forms going back to 8 to 10 thousand years, 9!nsberg told how he went to them to learn about poetry. He demonstrated their technique by keeping time

Nationwide antiwar demonstrations 
Campus protesters cause alarm 

<c> New York Times 1972 
New York Aprii20---Gov. Marvin Mandel declared a state of emergency at the !University of Maryland tonight after three days of antiwar disturbances and violence an-d sent National Guardsmen onto the College Park campus to enforce an overnight 
curfew. 
In Dayton, Ohio, the police arrested 125 demonstrators and used tear gas to disperse a crowd of 500 protestors who had formed human chains to block the gates of the Wright Patterson Air Force Base. 
In Washington, a coalition of antiwar leaders supported by more than 20 U.S. Senators and Representatives called for a 11.atinwide moratorium on May 4--­the-second annivesary of the fatal shooting of four Kent State University students--to protest the escalation of the war in Indochina. 
At Columbia Unjversity here, student demonstrators swarmed into a closed meeting of the University Senate, forcing its suspension, after the Universuty had summoned the police to take action against students for the first time since the rioting there in 1968. 
Responding to this, William J. McGill, President of the University ordered all classes suspended at to Robinson. He cited the creation

Two ND profs to appear on panel for retardation 
Dr. Harvey Bender, professor of biology at the University of Notre Dame. will chair a panel on the rights of the mentally retarded at the Indiana Association for Retarded Children Annual Program Convention at Purdue University Friday. 
Also appearing on the panel will be Charles Murdock, associate professor of law. Murdock teaches a course on "Mental Retardation and the Law." 
Bender explained that the panel will explore legal, social, educational and employment rights of the mentally retarded, and hopes the discussions will help definethe readth and scope of the complex problem which affects over 6 million retarded in the country. "After all," Bender said, "other minority groups can ar­ticulate their own concerns. But who speaks for the retarcled? Tney're a very unvocal group." 
FACULTY NOTICE 
The Faculty Manual CommitTee will continue to welcome written recommendations for the revision of the FACULTY MANUAL until April 25th, 1972~ These recom­mendations should be submitted to Prof. James Robinson. These revisions may concern either the present FACULTY MANUAL or the proposed changes to the MANUAL found in N D Report No. 15. 
The Committee report will be made to the Faculty Senate on Thursday, Apr 27 at 7:30pm in the Aud. of the Center for Continuing Education. The Faculty at large is encouraged to attend this meeting. 
(Signed) The Executive Com~ mittee of the Faculty Senate. 

the university tomorrow. 
Elsewhere across the country. indignation over the renewed U.S. bombing of North Vietnam generated continued demon­strations and rallies at numerous college campuses and military installations, and more protests were planned for tomorrow and the weekend. 
There were a number of arre;;ts and scattered reports of minor injuries,but today's demon­strations were generally peaceful, taking the form of picket lines, rallies, class boycotts and statements of dissent. Students and political figures were at the forefront of most of the ex­pressions of protest. 
At the University of Maryland, 

where police using tear gas and 
armored antiriot vehicles had 
routed 2,000 demonstrators blocking U.S. Route 1 in the early morning housr, Governor Mandel proclaimed a state of emergency imposed a 9 p.m. to 7 a.m. curfew and activated over 800 Guardsmen to patrol the 36,000 student cam­
pus. 

The order, following scores of arrests, pitched battles between the plice and stuuents and an effort ' to set fire to a Reserve Officers Training Corps Armory was ac­companied by a tough statement by thP Governor, who declared: 
"I'm fed up with this violence and destruction of public and private property, nd I fully intend to see that it ends." The demon­stration at Wright-Patterson Air Force base involved mainly students from Ohio colleges. They formed chains at two of the Base's five gates and refused police or­ders to disperse. Tear gas and the mass arrest of 125 persons dispersed the protestors,but many base employees were delayed getting to work. 
While students on numerous college campuses planned strikes and class boycotts for tomorrow,a coalition of antiwar leaders and Congressmen called a news con­ference in Washington to announce that May 4 moratorium. The moratorium would, as planned, encompass a wide range of ac­tivities, including rallies students boycotts and; as in the massive nationwide moratorium of Oct. 15, 1969--the wearing of black arm bands. 
The g ~Sup announcing the day of protest include Senators Fred R. Harris of Oklahoma and Mike Gavel of Alaska. both Democrats Representatives Paul H. McCloseky, R-Calif., and Bella M.

the chariot is long and arduous, but they further acknowledge that the honor achieved and the thrill of victory far overshadow the pains and toils of preparation. 
Finally corralled after lengthy journeys to the far reaches of the globe, the team of "horses" appears to be the best ever assembled. They are kept on a rigorous training schedule that includes run­ning,work-outs, and rub downs, and a strict diet of pepperoni pizzas andStroth's beer by the quart. The Roman's precision matched set of four stallions consists of Tom Romano, Mike Kochevar, Mark Steinborn, and Steve Gallogly, a last minute replacement for J. Carter Tackett who pulled up lame during training and un­fortunately had to be shot. Although this is fundamentally the same team fielded last year, with the exception of Gallogly, it is believed in the Roman camp that they will be much more competitive due to the superior quality of this year's chariot. 
While numerous off~rs were submitted 

from such notables as Ferrari, Fiat, Mer­cedes-Benz, Porsch, Lotus, and American Motors to design the MCMLXXII version of the chariot, they were politely refused as the Romans opted to implement their vast store of knowledge gained from years of com­petition in the Circus Maximus. However, there are some radical alternations plan­ned, including round wheels, an axle, and a roll .bar. With these improvements, the sentiments of the Roman camp focus on victory, much to the delight of their driver. 
The pilot of the chariot is a well-known campus personality, Jim "Ben Zero" Brennan. Brennan, as he is never called, is known on campus as one of the two cymbal players in the marching band. Other apellations include, T.H.E. Fish, the fellow who shaved his head for no apparent reason, and the Vulture, whose blood­cur?ling shriek is certain to topple one's samty. Brennan has been priming for Saturday's outing since September, and when questioned how the pre-race preparations were progressing, Ben was 
fisher fiends 
rumored to reply, "Ruthless!" 
With. the weekend's competition looming precanously over the horizontal Hoosier horizon. the Romans have prepared to celebrate Friday night so as to ferment the proper mental attitude. The pre-victory fest is being offered in honor of the infamous Ben Zero, who will once again risk life and limb to mention nothing of honor. Th~ ceremonious festivities will commence at 
VIII: XXX in the basement of Ben's residential palace. 
Although the entire venture surrounding the race was initially scorned as a ridiculous undertaking, the entire population of Fisher Hall has rallied around the Romans in their quest. It is not unusual for one to spot banners with "S.P.Q.R." enscribed on them fluttering from the windows or detect strains . o~ "G~udeamus Igit~r" echoing from Withm. Fisher Hall, and particularly the Romans, cordially invite all to view the race, at one O'clock on Saturday at An Tostal's Circus Minisculous. One r>ever can tell, Rome may rise again. 


There reside in Fisher Hall a select few des~endants of a once proud and powerful hentage -men of true strength and courage, born and bred in Roman tradition and sworn never t? reli~quis~ their cultural ancestry. In keepmg with this vow, these virtuous men will once again perform the ritual that keeps their bonds to the people and Senate of R?me alive. These modern day plebians of Fisher Hall have managed to preserve this ceremony in spite of the rise of collegiate football, pep rallies, coeducation and the Prime Mover. ' 
This rite, traditional during the festivities of An Tostal, is the race of singular chariots through the woods, fields, and mud of du Lac in an insane rush for the ·pinnacle of honors, the victory laurel. Although the stalwart charioteer and his four thorough­bred horses have enjoyed an unprecedented string of victories throughout the known world, this last remaining prize has eluded their grasp.

"He was born, he is living and sometime, hopefully not too near in the future, he won't be anymore." 
That was the autobiography author John 
A. Williams gave for his introduction Thursday night as a guest speaker of the Sophomore Literary Festival. 
Close to 200 people listened in the Library . Auditorium as Williams read various selections of his poetry and fiction. 
Tracing the 18 years of his career, Willimas began with two of his early short stories, "Figure Eight" and ''The Pary." He received a very favorable audience response to "The Hopper's Hamlet," a hip takeoff on Shakespeare's classic. 
In William's version, Claudius is known as a "low cat," and Ham himself "kn~w :.e: \-.'as sharp in his black Chesterfield jacket with white collar, gray flannel doublet and green cords." 
Williams then recited several of a series of his poems that center around "the movement of blacks from Africa to the West," collectively entitled "Safari West." rn the style of Negro folk ballads, these selections are very descriptive and personal in content. 
1 Williams is the author of several long fiction works, including The Man Who Cried I Am, Journey Out of Anger, Night Song and Sessie' .. Also a writer of magazine pieces and short essays, Williams won the unhappy distinction of being the first nominee for the Prix de Rome to be refused by the Academy, without being given any reason. 
A cursory examination of the card catalogue revealed that none of Williams' books are available in either the ND or SMC library. 
In a section he dubbed, "exerpts from long fiction," Williams read a chapter from The Man Who Cried I Am which describes uptown New York City as seen by a black writer in the days of the hoppers. He also dedicated a section of Junior Bachelor Society, a work in progress, to "Kip An­derson and all the golden jocks of Notre Dame." This particular chapter describes a saturday afternoon football game in Jef­ferson Park starring three middle-aged athletes beyond their prime. 
The final three readings were from his newest book, to be released May 5. They included a unique interpretation of the sinking of the Titanic, called "Shine," and two longer prose passages from the "Cadences" section which concern the

emotions and decisions involved in war. 
Williams added that he chose the last two readings because of their relevance to the campus strike. Several war . protestors engaged in a silent form of guenlla theatre outside the auditorium prior to the program, but there were no demonstrations.

ND pre-med program fares well 


by Dan'l Barrett 
Notre Dame's pre-med program is as good or better than most, according to graduates now at­tending medical school at the University of Michigan, Loyola of Chicago, Harvard, and Wayne State. Greg Wolf, a junior at Michigan, expressed the typical opinion that "the education I got was a lot better than the education of many of my classmates." 
"A lower grade point at Notre Dame might get you in above a higher grade point from somewhere else," explained Eugene Agnone, a freshman at Wayne State, "because Notre Dame is known to have a good pre­med program." "Notre Dame is one of the best schools," concurred Paul Brazis, a sophomore at Loyola, "and it has a big name with the medical 

schools. They might even take a emphasize liberal arts natwnallevel w1ll not be accepted

Interviewed students pointed to Notre Dame's high rate of ac­ceptance to medical schools as proof that medical schools also feel Notre Dame pre-med graduates are better than most. 
"Notre Dame would compare quite favorably with most schools," claimed John Tocks, a junior at Michigan, in explaining the high rate of acceptance. 
Endorsements from the graduates, however, didn't come free of criticism. Main criticisms of the program centered around the calculus and physics requirements, the lack of a physiology course open to pre-med students, and the lack of electives in non-science areas. 
need physiology 
"I defy anyone to tell me why a pre-med student needs engineering calculus and physics,'' challenged Tocks. He explained that his class was allowed a choice between pre­med calculus and physics or the engineering courses, but that the choice was removed for following classes. 
Special calculus and physics courses for pre-med students could be set up, according to Agnone, because Notre Dame's pre-med program has grown so large. The -Jther graduates concurred, stating that they had found little use for the engineering calculus and physics. 
Lack of a pre-med physiology course was another criticism voiced by the graduates. "I feel I was well prepared," stated Dave Blaha, a junior at Michigan, "but I would definitely like to see physiology offered if I had to do it again." 
Classmates who completed their undergraduate work at Michigan might have had a better course selection, according to Tocks, because they could take a course such as physiology before medical school. "Physiology in medical school is not that difficult," Tocks continued, "but the kids from Michigan had a course and we did not." 
biochemistry helps 
In contrast to the situation with physiology, Agnone pointed to biochemistry as a course that "was really good and could possibly be expanded to a year." Greg Wolf added that "biochemistry gave me an ex­cellent preparation for the medical school course." 

"Taking biochemistry at Notre Dame was really important," claimed Cabaj, "and the ad­vantage it gave me was just fan­tastic. I did not learn anything new in biochemistry at medical school, and it is the hardest course offered 
at Harvard." 
Besides biochemistry, the in­terviewed students pointed to embryology as a course that was good preparation for medical school. 
"The embryology course at Notre Dame was almost equivalent to the one at medical school," claimer! Brazis. 
year were basically just a waste of time. All I was trying to do was fill my science requirement." 
"The Admissions Council at Michigan has emphasized that students should take liberal arts," continued Tocks, "because once you get to medical school you just don't have time to take the liberal arts." Wolf concurred by advising students "to take music, art, and literature courses." 
Both Agnone and Wolf felt the Arts and Letters pre-med curriculum was better than the Science Preprofessional curriculum. Wolf, who was ac­cepted at Michigan after three years, said "the Arts and Letters curriculum is more spread out and easier to digest." Agnone switched into Arts and Letters while he was at Notre Dame. 
The final criticism the graduates had for the program was actually levelled at the students in the program. "Competition is 
inherent in a pre-med program," claimed Blaha, "but it is absurd when it reaches the state where people won't give one another their notes in order to do better on the test." 
competition rough 
Blaha feels the average pre-med student is the compulsive type who "wants to beat someone on a test fllr the sake of beating them. The pre-med students are

"I felt more tension at Notre Dame," commented Eugene Agnone! "because I looked on the pre-med program as a hurdle in which I had to get good grades." 
The graduates felt the com­petition was unfortunate, but was possibly a part of the program Notre I?ame could not control. They pomted out that roughly half the. pre-med ~raduates on the

"Notre Dame had a lot of competition," explained Brazis, "because they had to weed a lot of guys out of the program. Every year the gradepoint you need for medical school goes up, so not everybody is expected to graduate and be accepted." 
Competition is less severe at medical school, according to John Tocks, because the people are more mature and willing to help each other out. 
"People have a better grip of what is going on," he stated, "and also it is much harder to get into medical school than it is to stay in." 
Explaining that he did not feel any competition at Michigan, Wolf stated that "in medical school you just try to get the best education possible. The competition is with yourself." He continued, "medical school has been easier for me and I have not had to study as much as I did at Notre Dame." 
Cabaj wouldn't say that medical school had been easier for him, but he does '"feel a lot more relaxed."

The Michigan and Harvard students pointed out that a big factor in eliminating competition was the pass-fail system used at the two medical schools. 
"There is still anxiety because you have to cover a lot of material," Blaha stated, "but the majority is happy to do average because the school is set up to do average." 
Despite their pointed criticisms of the program and people in it, all but one of the graduates felt they would still go to Notre Dame if they had it to do over again. "I wouldn't go back to Notre Dame if I had to do it again," explained Cabaj, "but only because I felt Notre Dame was so socially stinting. It's not a reflection of the pre-med program."

FBI agent reveals Buffalo tape 



by ('Jiff Wintrode Special to the Observer 
Buffalo, N.Y. -An FBI agent testified at the trial of the Buffalo here today that he was present in the monitor room of a local television station when an in­terview program with the Buffalo was video-taped in September 2, 1971. 
The agent, Charles Ahart, also said that to his knowledge, the defendants, who were not in­dicated at that time, were not aware of his presence. 
He said that his supervisor had told him that the Buffalo were 
going to be on the program. His boss did not disclose how he had received that information, added Ahart. 
Ahart, being questioned by prosecutor James Grable, Assistant U.S. Attorney, testified over strenuous defense objections his selected recollections of what the five defendants said. 
Charged with conspiracy, theft of government records and intent to commit burglary, after being arrested in a Buffalo Federal building last August 21, are Maureen Considine, Chuck Darst, Jeremiah Horrigan, Jim Martin and Ann Masters. 

t 
Vincent Doyle, co-<:ounsel for the defendants, objected to Ahart's testimony unless the jury could view the half-hour program in its
t entirety. A call to the station, WGR-TV, disclosed that no tape now exists of the show.

Pleiku. South Vietnam, April 20-­Hoaian, a district capital, was yielded to North Vietnamese forces yesterday before they had even attacked it, a witness to the operation disclosed today, and the defending troops fled in disorder. 
Hoaian, in the central coastal province of Binhdinh, was aban­doned to the Communists because the South Vietnamese high com­mand believed that rein­forcements could have been drawn only from even more crucial areas. 
An American oresent during the evacuation said enemy pressure had been mounting for 10daysbut the expected attack had not materialized. 
The decision to abandon Hoaian was made Tuesday when it became apparent that rein­forcements would not reach the town. which was defended by the equivalent of four companies of regular troops --the mauled 
Business students receive awards 
Two candidates for the M.B.A. dq~ree from the College of Rusirwss Administration at the Pnivcrsity of Notre Dame have been awardcd Woodrow Wilson Intt>m F!'llowships for service during tht coming year at one of the nation's developing colleges. Only 16 of the prestigious awards will be presented by the New Jersey foundation this year. 
Thc recipients are Fred Ziolkowski of South Bend, and Walter Sulkowski. Buffalo. N.Y. 
A student assistant at the Notre Damp CPnter for Continuing Ed'lcation, Ziolkowski attended Washington High School of South RPnrl: St. Joseph's College, 1(c,;..;selaer. Ind., and Western Michigan, Kalamazoo. Sulkowski attended Cornell University, Ithaca. N.Y., and was a member of the academic council and chair­man of the Executive Club at Notre Dame. He recently received a prize for an article printed in the Business Review magazim~. 

The WGR newsman that was contacted by Ahart said that he did not know how the FBI knew prior to the taping that the Buffalo would be appearing. 
The defendants extensively cross-examined Army Captain William J. MaHoney, Special Agent-in-Charge of the Buffalo Military Intelligence Office on the role of Army intelligence and on his experiences in Vietnam. 
Malloney said that the Army last June I ordered the destruction of all "data banks" of the Civil Disturbance Group of Intelligence, and ordered the dissolution of that group. 
However, MaHoney said that a card file identified as being in his office on August 21 contained two years' work. He also said that investigation notes are being kept, apparently able to provide for the possible reconstruction of files. 
The cards, said MaHoney, cont::~in information on 'li<'ns and naturalized · ·-·-·!'Js who are ap-
McGovern victory is setback for Muskie 
<c> l!li2 New York Times 
Montpelier, Vt. April 20--Sen. George McGovern scored a major victory in Vermont Wednesday night when his supporters at local Democratic cacuses gained a majority of the seats at the State Democratic Convention. 
The surprise action by McGovern's supporters delivered a major blow to the Democratic leadership in the state, most of whome had backed Sen. Edmund 
S. Muskie of Maine. 
Unofficial reporters show that McGovern captured 276 delegates while Muskie won 158 seats at the State Democratic convention which will be held in Winooski on May 20. Sen. Hubert Humphrey garnered only six votes. Forty-six other votes were uncommitted. 

The final result will not be certified under new Democratic ty rules until next week, but the re was no question that McGovern had scored a 2 to 1 victory over Muskie and that McGovern sup­porters would capture a majority of the state's 22 and a half votes at the Democratic National Con­vention. 
In almost every town in the state McGovern supporters packed the caucuses and wre made up mainly of young people, college students and blue collar workers, as well as older liberal Democrats who had worked quietly within the con­servative party leadership

powerful North Vietnamese ring 
around the town, according to the 
source, who was evacuated to 
Pleiku. 70 miles to the southwest. 
"Still, they did not attack us at 

Hanoi," the American said. "They 
were all around us in the hills two 
kilometers away, and we knew 
they were massing. Civilians 
came to us in a state of panic, 
talking about the North Viet­
namese who were out there. We 
lost all our militia units --they just 
piled up their arms and faded 
away." 
"The South Vietnamese troops 

just wouldn't do anything offensive 
--no patrolling, no going out to 
meet the enemy, nothing," he 
added. 
"The North Vietnamese out 

there, of course, were just the 
opposite. I once saw one of them 
standing on a hill while an F-4 
phantom was coming down on him, 
and he stayed there, face to face, 
firing his rifle at it." 
According to a supposedly secret 

evacuation plan. the defenders

force was to move along the road to 
the coast. establishing a new

"If we could have gotten some reinforcements the day before," the 
American said, "it would have 
been a tremtndous psychological

knew we were in for trouble." 
In fact, the departure was evidently not a secret. As a throng of vehicles, soldiers and civilians poured out of the area, the North Vietnamese were waiting. 
"They attackrd and poured in all kinds of fire," the American related. "Our side broke and ran. The armored personnel carriers, which were supposed to stay with the troops, just headed up the road at full speed, with the commander on one of them.

The roads in the area, which had been cleared by American units and were generally safe until two years ago, are rapidly returningto the crucial situation that prevailed in 1965, when American ground forces for.Jlally entered the war. 
The most dangerous roadblock is on l{oute 19, the arterial road that winds eastward from Pleiku through the mountains to Ankhe and then descends to the coastal valley ending at Lhe Port of Quinh :n, on the South China Sea.

He later extended coverage to any of these people in the army or who are working for companies holding defense contracts. 
MaHoney said he served a year in Vietnam with Military In­telligence, including four months with the Viet Cong Infra-Structure Unit. 
MaHoney said that he never witnessed any torture or beating of prisoners undergoing in­terrogation. 
"1 am not aware of the policy of war crimes being committed, he said. 
He described the present South Vietnamese government as a "pre­natal " Martin asked him what he meant, and MaHoney replied that "it is a democracy moving toward democratic means." 
Large amounts of laughter from the spectators followed this comment. 
The Buffalo re-submitted the names of three prospective defense witnesses to Federal Judge John T. Curtin, asking him to issue subpoenas. One of the names is Jim Douglas, who co­started the Non-Violence Program at Notre Dame. 
The other two witnesses are Curtis Tarr, who resigned last week as Director of Selective Service, and journalist Done Luce, who inspected the "tiger cages" in a South Vietnamese prison.

with two wooden songsticks while he changed the verses they had taught him. 
Moderator Dan O'Donnell asked a question at this point as to whether or not poetry was becoming as oral once again as it had been when oral tradition was the chief method of com­munication. He cited Ginsberg's Aborigine verse and the song whch Robert Duncan had sung Wed­nesday at his reading as examples of this. Duncan seemed to agree with this but emphasized that this was not a regression but an actual integration of the techniques of other cultures into our body of knowledge. 
"Our population is a world population," said Duncan, "and if there's something about America that seems awesome to me it's that

print and electronic technologies may someday disappear. Duncan pointed out that even our culture 
has an oral tradition: that of nursery rhymes. 
Going from this topic to that of multi-media ' "happenings.," Duncan then lept into the political sphere by stating that the Vietnam war was a kind of happening because it had no purposes other 
than destruction and killing. "Johnson swore to us he had no purposes there!" said Duncan. He then criticized the so-called "War ag<oiHst communism" as a war against Brotherhood. "The great communism is that God is the one who owns and whose properties belong to all mankind. It was an enormous blasphemy when, following the feudal period, mankind laid personal claim to real estate. Christendom did not understand at all that any man could own property and sell it ... We were meant to be gardeners of the earth.' 
A questioner from the audience asked of the University were not more of a symptom than a cure to the problems of civilization. Ginsberg responded that indeed Academe was a "never-never land--whose people spoil the world to maintain themselves in their style of living. He said he has become aware of "the deepest emotion that all of us in America feel: grief over what we've done to spoil the planet, to spoil our­selves." He then urged the beginning of a strict ascetic practice to cure the "American spoiling disease of conspicuous consumption."

The Credentials Committee of the Mock Democratic Convention met last night and immediately received a notice of a challenge concerning the Washington State Delegation. Ken Muth, a member of the delegation, claimed that he was not notified of a meeting held by certain members of the delegation in order to elect a permanent state chairman and the state's representatives to the three convention committees. 
The Credentials Committee will hear evidence from both Muth and Kevin McKernan, the delegate who was elected state chairman, at its final meeting Sunday afternoon The committee could conceivably decide to unseat all committee representatives from the state of Washington, but such action is not considered likely. 
In other developments, the committee elected Betsy Mohan of the Illinois Delegation as its Chairman, and discussed the 
place for the brotherhood oi man ... Mankind is our business, not the English tradition, not Europe.
We're not...putting Europe away: it constantly gets bigger .Gary (synderl brings Buddhism: we can't move without all that: it's as if everything is becoming present in a huge open community." 
Ginsberg commented: "There are living today in the world, stili, worlds that continue the most ancient way of speaking. And our own forms are really very much 
determined by the University, by the printing press, by the chair we sit in, by the microphone, by the phonograoh albums, or the books that are written ... A study of what is eternal or what is constant, or relatively constant, could require our turning back to American Indian poetry or Aborigine poetry, to find what strengths have lasted for thousands of years." 
Ginsberg suggested that an oral tradition and culture is the most enduring of forms since even our 
procedural rules for a Democratic Credentials Committee, as well as the method of dissemination of credentials to all of the delegates. No one will be allowed on the floor of the convention without proper credentials, including the press 
 11d the delegates, and there will be Sargents-at-Arms at all of the entrances to the delegate section of the floor checking the credentials. There will be a large area provided just for spectators. 
The Credentials Committee will meet for the last time on Sunday at 2 p.m. in room 123 Nieuwland Science Hall. 
The other Mock Convention Committees are in full swing. The 
Platform  Committee,  whose  
chairman  is  Rick  Harrison  of  
Wyoming,  will  meet  at  1 p.m.  

Sunday in the Student Center Amphitheater. 
The Rules Committee, chaired by Blake Wordal of North Dakota, will also meet Sunday at 1 p.m. in room 127 Nieuwland Science Hall.
