Liquor law violations increase 
By EILEEN DUFFY Assistant News Editor 
While Notre Dame Security/Police's (NDSP) annual report shows a major drop in larceny, the findings released last Friday point to steady increases in liquor law violations and non­forcible burglaries. 
In an e-mail sent Friday, NDSP urged the campus community to read its Safety Brochure, which includes security and safety informa­tion as well as crime statis­tics for the years 2003-2005. 
The report, which is required to be presented to the public under the federal Jeanne Clery act, presents

Fair Trade coffee resolution passed

The potential price increase at Notre Dame is hard to predict, Nijak said, since the University has not disclosed how much it cur­rently pays for coffee. 
The resolution, which passed 22-2, also calls for Food Services to make "education material" available wherever coffee is served to help students "understand the value of pur­chasing Fair Trade products." 
"Our goal is not just to have all students drinking Fair Trade on campus," Plamoottil said.

Students to discuss Facebook with BOT 
By KATHLEEN McDONNELL 
News Writer 
As checking Facebook.com has evolved into a daily ritual for college students every­where, Notre Dame's student government leaders will dis­cuss the growth of technology and virtual interaction at today's University Board of Trustees meetings. 
The group's presentation, "Technology and Social Networking," will focus mainly on Facebook.com -the popu­lar social networking site that the Board has expressed inter­est in better understanding, student body president Lizzi Shappell said. 

Students traditionally present to the Student Affairs commit­tee during each of the Board of Trustees' three annual meet­ings. The fall presentation, Shappell said, is designed to involve more of the student body than just the top three leaders -herself, student body vice president Bill Andrichik and chief executive officer Liz Brown. 
To complete the meeting's student panel, freshman Kate McClelland, sophomore Glenn Water and senior Sheldon Dutes will sit alongside Shappell, Andrichik and Brown

Backing a renewed interest in the plight of marginalized work­ers, the Student Senate passed a resolution Wednesday recom­mending Notre Dame Food Services serve only Fair Trade coffee in all of its non-franchised operations. 
Currently, Fair Trade coffee is only available at select locations on campus. 
Social Concerns committee chair Sheena Plamoottil pre­sented the resolution with Gary Nijak and Chris Morrissey of Amnesty International, a Notre Dame human rights group that has made Fair Trade coffee its top priority this year.

While last year, Shappell and then-student body president Dave Baron presented their fall Board of Trustees presentation as a report -the topic being the relationship between the Notre Dame and South Bend communities -this year's presentation takes the form of a 10-minute introduction by Kathy Brannack, assistant director of the Office of Residence Life and Housing, followed by a question and answer session within the stu­dent panel. 

Student Affairs choose the topic and dictate the format for the fall meeting, Shappell said. 
"Bill and I discussed options with [Vice President for Student Affairs] Father [Mark] Poorman to make sure aspects each group wanted to discuss were included," Shappell said. 
"I think [the Board's] interest is because social networking has taken off," Shappell said. "Between MySpace and Facebook, social networking is a new way people are connect­ing, including many Notre Dame students and alums." 
Some aspects to be covered include a general education on the site's format and capabili­ties, a discussion about increas­just a fad or a staple of modern socialization, Shappell said. 
The Board is interested in both the positive social benefits of the site -such as the increased visibility for clubs on campus and the potential for alumni to stay in touch -and the potentially harmful draw­backs, such as future employ­ers' investigation of an appli­cant's Facebook profile, Shappell said.

"It's interesting to hear their perspectives both as some of the major decision makers of our University and also as alumni who reflect on their time here versus our times."

Drive aids 
regional hospitals 
By DANA GUSKY 
News Writer 
Members of the Notre Dame community may save hundreds of lives today simply through the donation of their blood. 
The Lewis Blood Drive will take place in the hall's basement from 10 a.m. to 4:30p.m. today, and all the blood will be donated to the South Bend Medical Foundation. 
"All of the blood stays local which is really exciting," said event organizer Leah Miller. 
Miller is organizing the event with fellow Lewis Hall service coordinators sophomore Alice Shepherd and sophomore Alice Griesemer. 
Just one pint of blood can save three to four people's lives, and the drive has already filled all avail­able appointments with donors. 
The coordinators gave Lewis residents the priority donor spots and then began a campus-wide search for donors, Miller said. 
Miller said this is her lOth time donating blood. One of her main reasons for starting the drive is to make more people comfortable donating. 
"I want people to get over their fear," Miller said, emphasizing that it only takes about 10 minutes of discomfort to save several lives. 
Lewis rector Linda Cirillo said she sees the blood drive as another way to fulfill the message of Christ. 
"It is one way of giving ourselves to our brothers and sisters," Cirillo said. 
Although all appointments are filled, the blood drive accepts walk­ins and the coordinators hope more people donate than just those who signed up, Miller said. 
The best time to come in without an appointment is before and after lunchtime, Miller said. 
If someone cannot come during the regular drive hours, Miller said students could come after the drive's official hours because the nurses will probably be there until 6p.m. 
The drive particularly wants donors with type 0 negative blood because it is the universal blood type that can be transfused to vir­tually anyone, Miller said. 
Ifsomeone is a bit too squeamish to donate, T-shirts will also be sold at the blood drive to benefit the New Orleans service project that sends students to New Orleans to help with Hurricane Katrina relief over tall break.

Iran persists in enriching uranium 
HASHTGERD, Iran -President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad warned Wednesday that sanc­tions will not stop Iran from enriching urani­um after a European negotiator conceded "endless hours" of talks had made little progress and suggested the dispute could wind up at the U.N. soon. 
The talks had been seen as a last-ditch attempt to avoid a full-blown confrontation between Iran and the U.N. Security Council after Tehran ignored an Aug. 31 deadline to suspend enrichment -a key step toward making nuclear weapons -or face punish­ment. 
The latest comments -and the view of senior U.N. diplomats who told The Associated Press on Tuesday that nearly two years of intermittent negotiations had failed -suggested an emerging consensus that the time has finally come to consider Security Council sanctions. 
Militants' email says they killed 9 
PORT HARCOURT, Nigeria -Security forces battled militants in Nigeria's oil-rich southern delta Wednesday after attacks on a convoy and a pumping station, officials said, the latest in a rash of kidnappings and other violence that has damaged the country's important petroleum industry. 
A major militant group said in an e-mail they killed nine soldiers and captured two government gunboats at the pumping station belonging to a Royal Dutch Shell PLC sub­sidiary about 25 miles west of Port Harcourt. The army gave no casualty figures and it was not possible to confirm the militants' claim. 
The group, known as MEND, said it acted defensively after being attacked by army gunboats and a helicopter gunship.

Assistant Secretary of State Christopher Hill told reporters that the U.S. has sent Pyongyang a message of "deep concern" through diplo­matic channels at the United Nations in New York. He said North Korea has yet to respond. 
Hill did not elaborate on the message, except to say the North Koreans had received it.

Teacher charged: sexual misconduct 
SCOTTSBURG -A high school teacher engaged in sexual misconduct with a girl who attended a church where he was a youth minister, state police said Wednesday. 
John A Watts, 27, is a teacher at Southwestern High School in Hanover and was a volunteer coach of the girl's track team at Scott County's Austin High School, where the girl was a student. 
The girl was 14 and 15 years old when the encounters occurred between 2002 and 2004 in various locations in Scott County, police said. 

Scandal rocks Hastert's support 
Aide says he notified senior staffthree years ago offanner Rep. Mark Foley's conduct 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -House Speaker Dennis Hastert's political support showed signs of cracking on Wednesday as Republicans fled an election-year scan­dal spawned by steamy computer messages from former Rep. Mark Foley to teenage male pages. 
At the same time, a con­gressional aide said in an Associated Press interview he first warned Hastert's aides more than three years ago that Foley's behavior toward pages was troublesome. That was long before GOP lead­ers acknowledged learning of the problem. 
The aide, Kirk Fordham, said he had "more than one conversation with sen­ior staff at the highest level of the House of Representatives asking them to intervene" several years ago. 
The claim drew a swift, unequivocal denial from Hastert's chief of staff. "What Kirk Fordham said did not happen," Scott Palmer said through a spokesman. 
Hastert's political diffi­culties were evident half a continent away. 
Rep. Roy Blunt of Missouri, third-ranking leader, pointedly told reporters he would have handled the matter differ­ently than the speaker, had he known of it. 
"I think I could have given some good advice here, which is, You have to be curious, you have to ask all the questions you can think of," said Blunt, a member of the leadership. "You absolutely can't decide not to look into activities because one indi­vidual's parents don't want you to." 
Republican Rep. Ron Lewis of Kentucky, in a tougher-than-expected re­election race, abruptly canceled an invitation for Hastert to join him at a fundraiser next week. 
''I'm taking the speaker's words at face value," Lewis told the AP. "I have no reason to doubt him. But until this is cleared up, I want to know the facts. If anyone in our leadership has done anything wrong, then I will be the first in line to condemn it." 


Ron Bonjean, Hastert's spokesman, said the entire issue had been referred to the House ethics commit­tee. "We fully expect that the bipartisan panel will do what it needs to do to investigate this mater and protect the integrity of the House," he added. 
House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi went one step further, saying in a state­ment that Hastert and the rest of the GOP leadership should be "immediately questioned under oath .... " 
"The children, their par­ents, the public, and our colleagues deserve answers and those who covered up Mark Foley's behavior must be held accountable," she said. 
Foley, 52, a Florida Republican, resigned last Friday after he was con­fronted with sexually explicit electronic mes­sages he had sent teenage male pages. He has since entered an alcohol rehabil-. itation facility at an undis­closed location. Through his lawyer, he has said he is gay but denied any sexu­al contact with minors. 
His abrupt departure left behind an Internet-age sex scandal that has shaken Republican confidence _ and poll numbers -little more than a month before elections at which their control of the House will be tested. 
It also plunged Hastert 
and others into an inten­sive effort to grapple with conflicting claims about what senior lawmakers knew, when they learned it and what they did about it. 
Fordham resigned Wednesday as chief of staff to Rep. Thomas Reynolds, R-N.Y., the House GOP campaign chief who says he alerted Hastert to con­cerns about Foley last spring. 
The longtime Capitol Hill aide said that more than three years ago, he repeat­edly asked GOP staffers to intervene with Foley. He 
-declined to identify them, but officials said Palmer, Hastert's chief of staff, was one of them. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to dis­cuss it. 
IRAQ 


Police unit tied to death squads 
Associated Press 

BAGHDAD -Iraqi authorities pulled a brigade of about 700 policemen out of service Wednesday in its biggest move ever to uproot troops linked to death squads, aiming to signal the govern­ment's seriousness in cleansing Baghdad of sectarian violence. 
The government move came amid steadily mounting violence, particularly in the capital. A U.S. military spokesman said the past week had seen the highest number of car bombs and roadside bombs in Baghdad this year. 
Four U.S. soldiers patrolling in Baghdad were killed by gunmen on Wednesday, the U.S. military said, also announcing the deaths of two other sol­diers a day earlier in Baghdad and the northern city of Kirkuk. The deaths brought to 21 the number of Americans killed in combat since Saturday. 
The suspension of the police brigade was the first time the Iraqi government has taken such dramatic action to disci­pline security forces over possible links to militiamen, though some individual soldiers have been investigated in the past. Baghdad's Sunnis widely fear the Shiite-led police, saying they are infil­trated by militias and accusing them of cooperating with death squads who snatch Sunnis and kill them. 
The brigade was responsible for a region of northeast Baghdad with a slight Shiite majority, where gunmen on Sunday kidnapped 24 workers from a frozen food factory. Hours later, the bodies of seven of the workers were found dumped in a district miles away.

IN BRIEF 

Apple apologizes for stock practices 
SAN JOSE, Calif. -Apple Computer Inc. CEO Steve Jobs apologized Wednesday for the company's past stock-option practices after an internal investigation found accounting irregularities between 1997 and 2002 and showed Jobs was aware of some options backdating. 
The iPod and Macintosh maker said its three-month investigation also prompted the resignation of former Chief Financial Officer Fred Anderson from the company's board of directors. 
The company said Jobs knew that some grants had been given favorable dates "in a few instances," but he did not benefit from them and was not aware of the accounting implications. 
"I apologize to Apple's shareholders and employees for these problems, which hap­pened on my watch," Jobs said in a state­ment. "We will now work to resolve the remaining issues as quickly as possible and to put the proper remedial measures in place to ensure that this never happens again." 

Factory orders reflect slow economy 
WASHINGTON -In further signs of a slug­gish economy, orders to factories for manu­factured goods were weak for a second con­secutive month and service sector activity had its worst performance in more than three years. 
New orders for manufactured goods stayed basically the same in August at $403.6 billion, on the heels of 1 percent plunge in demand in July, the Commerce Department reported Wednesday. The August report showed big declines in demand for computers and com­mercial aircraft. 
Also, a gauge of activity in the service sec­tor. where most people work, fell sharply in September to 52.9, down from 57.0 a month before, according to the Institute for Supply Management. It was the poorest from the showing since April 2003 and was far below expectations. 
Both reports supported the view that the economy is continuing to slow under the impact of weaker consumer spending and a cooling housing market. 



GM decides against affiliation 
Automaker announces discarded Renault, Nissan global alliance scheme 
Associated Press 
DETROIT -After nearly 
three months of talks, 
General Motors Corp. 
announced Wednesday that 
it had discarded a scheme to 
forge a broad, global 
alliance with Renault and 
Nissan after the other two 
automakers declined to pay 
a premium f<>r reaping what 
GM said would have been a 
disproportionate share of 
the benefits. 
GM said France's Renault 
SA and Japan's Nissan 
Motor Co., which are 
already linked in an 
alliance, refused to pay a 
premium to GM for that 
imbalance. Renault-Nissan 
also wanted to acquire a sig­
nificant stake in GM _ an 
idea GM was not enthusias­
tic about, particularly with­
out payment of some kind of 
premium. Finally, the struc­
ture that Renault-Nissan 
advocated would have kept 
GM from forming joint ven­
tures with other companies, 
the U.S. company said. 
Renault-Nissan said com­
pensation would go against 
"the spirit of any successful 
alliance." 
The companies have not given details about the size of the premium or the stake under discussion.

"We hope once students leave our Notre Dame bubble that they will take what they learned here ... and actively make the decision to buy Fair Trade coffee." 
Fair Trade pricing ensures that farmers are paid $1.26 per pound of coffee beans, which is enough to support a family, Morrissey said. Fair Trade coffee eliminates the middle men -like millers, exporters and importers -and allows farmers to sell their beans directly to the roaster. 
The conventional model for cof­fee trade, however, only pays a farmer about 30 cents per pound of coffee beans -creating a "gross disparity" between what consumers pay for coffee and what the farmers receive for pro­ducing it. 
Currently, the Huddlemart, Reekers and the Jordan Hall of Science serve Fair Trade coffee exclusively. The University has had Fair Trade coffee on its cam­pus for more than five years, and in 2003 it was added to several campus venues like Waddick's in O'Shaughnessy Hall and the Cafe Commons in the Mendoza College of Business, among others. 
But that's not good enough, Morrissey said. 
"It gives the moral deCision­making authority to individuals rather than to the University community collectively," he said. 
Instead of being sold alongside conventional coffee, Morrissey believes Fair Trade brews should be the only coffee served on cam­pus. And it should be in every location, not just select ones, he said. 
But Fisher Senator Drew Clary feared the Fair Trade resolution did not accurately represent the interests of students, most of whom know very little about what Fair Trade coffee is, he said. 
"My fear is, if this passes and [Food Services] takes us up on this, what's going to be our moti­vation for education? The goal will have already been achieved," Clary said. 
Keenan Hall Senator Chris Beesley agreed with Clary. 
"How can we represent the stu­dent body saying students want Fair Trade coffee when the vast majority doesn't know what Fair Trade coffee is?" he said. 
But he still felt the resolution was appropriate, given Notre Dame's identity. 
"I think this is in line with the Catholic vision of the University and I don't see where that would be much of a problem." 
Now armed with the Senate's backing, Amnesty International members will be presenting infor­mation about Fair Trade coffee in each residence hall in an effort to educate students on the issue. 
"We need to decide to do the right thing," Nijak said. "Even if it means a few extra cents per cup."

Amish 111ourn victi111s, encourage forgiveness 
Associated Press 
NICKEL MINES, Pa.-In just about any other community, a deadly school shooting would have brought demands from civic leaders for tighter gun laws and better security, and the victims' loved ones would have lashed out at the gunman's family or threat­ened to sue. 
But that's not the Amish way. 
As they struggle with the slay­ings of five of their children in a one-room schoolhouse, the Amish in this Lancaster County village are turning the other cheek, urg­ing forgiveness of the killer and quietly accepting what comes their way as God's will. 
'They know their children are going to heaven. They know their children are innocent ... and they know that they will join them in death," said Gertrude Huntington, a Michigan researcher and expert on chil­dren in Amish society. 
"The hurt is very great," Huntington said. "But they don't balance the hurt with hate." 
In the aftermath of Monday's violence, the Amish are looking inward, relying on themselves and their faith, just as they have for centuries. They hold them­selves apart from the modern world, and have as little to do with civil authorities as possible. 
Amish mourners have been going from home to home for two days to attend viewings for the five victims, all little girls laid out in white dresses made by their families. Such viewings occur almost immediately after the bod­ies arrive at the parents' homes. 
Typically, they are so crowded, "if you start crying, you've got to figure out whose shoulder to cry on," said · Rita Rhoads, a Mennonite midwife who delivered two of the five girls slain in the attack.

One of the best cartoons on televi­sion while I was growing up was Captain Planet. The show's premise is this: Gaia, spirit of the earth, is fed up with humanity's destruction of the planet. She gives five rings to five teenagers repre­senting different areas of the world and turns them into the Planeteers. The rings give them ele­mental superpow­ers -earth, wind, fire, water and heart(because compassion matters too). When they combine the powers of their rings, they summon the super­hero of the earth -Captain Planet. 
Captain Planet had all the superpow­ers you could ask for: flight, shape­shifting, super strength, telekinesis and pretty much any ability the specif­ic dilemma demanded. His only weak­ness was exposure to smog, radiation, toxic waste or any form of pollution. The evil villains Sly Sludge, Hoggish Greedly, Doctor Blight, Looten Plunder, Verminous Skumm and Duke Nukem all attempted to thwart the Planeteers' environmentally restorative goals. 
I was hooked on this show. I mean, I even had the Captain Planet action fig­ure that turned brown when you applied heat to it (you had to dunk him in water to heal him and restore his natural healthy colors of blue and red). The lessons of the show really hit home. I tried to turn off lights in rooms when I left, and I occasionally cut up the plastic six-pack binding so it would not strangle fish. This was serious stuff. 
The show's message was beautiful: you can make a difference. Even as a kid, I think you realize that most car­toons are there just to occupy your

Foregone Conclusion 
time and energy. But this was differ­ent. This was a cartoon that actually told you to go out and do something when you got done watching it. It was groundbreaking and it was genius. Above and beyond all that, it was the only cartoon I knew featuring a green­mulleted superhero in tights. 
Then, somewhere along the way, something happened to me. I stopped watching, or the timeslot changed, or I got too old for cartoons. Suddenly, Captain Planet was no longer a part of my life. I graduated from the Planeteers -but the real tragedy was that nothing replaced it or carried on the environmental message as I grew older. Maturing meant losing my ideal­ism and skipping straight to cynicism. 
Part of this, I realize now, is the intense apathy directed toward the subject of environmentalism. We think the problem is too big, too distant and too broad to solve. The people we turn to when faced with trouble -the gov­ernment-end up being one of the biggest obstacles to progress on the issue. And every time a politician tries to make a case for improving our envi­ronmental standards, the bigwigs and talking heads scream out 'interest group.' We look for a power play behind every eco-decision. Case in point: AI Gore. 
Everyone knows about "An Inconvenient Truth," and almost no one can hear about it without wonder­ing if Gore has plans for holding office in the future. I realize that his movie is going to be politicized under the most intense scrutiny. There is nothing wrong with that. The man ran for President, so he can expect the gener­al public to see bureaucratic aspira­tions precipitating his every move. 
It is also acceptable to disagree with global warming based on the facts. There is a lot of information out there on the subject, and if you take the time to examine the data seriously and still conclude that the whole concept of global warming is bogus, you are enti­tled to such an opinion. But what no one is entitled to is using the "political motivation" argument as an excuse for inaction. What have we got to lose by working toward cleaner energy, fuel­efficient transportation and eco-friend­ly housing? You can complain about Al Gore and crazy wilderness people all you like, but in the end, such state­ments serve only as an excuse for lazi­ness. Hating AI Gore is no defense for owning two SUVs. 

That was the beauty of Captain Planet. It was not just about some superhero saving us. There were nor­mal kids (with magical rings, true) that saw problems and took the initiative to solve them. People disdain lectures about responsibility, but that is pre­cisely what we are burdened with -a responsibility to protect our planet. 
At the end of every show, Captain Planet bid the audience farewell by reminding us: "The power is yours!" Implicit in this sign off was a reminder of duty: the responsibility is ours. Previous generations have used the excuse of "not our problem" and have passed off the issue to their heirs. This excuse may not be possible for much longer, and it was never a good one to begin with. Our generation has the unique opportunity to turn things around, to take responsibility and to make sure that we are doing every­thing we possibly can to protect our environment. The resources are there, new avenues are open; all that remains is dedication on our part. 
Because if not us, who?

Celebrate with Holy Cross 
Just over five months ago, on April 28, 2006, Pope Benedict XVI authorized the promulgation of the mir­acle attributed to the intercession of the Venerable Basile Moreau, founder of the Congregation of Holy Cross. This promulgation completed the beatification process for Father Moreau, and it is expected that he will be beatified Richard. V. in LeMans, France, where the Warner Congregation of Holy Cross was founded in 1835. FaithPoint 
On that date, the Brothers of St. Joseph, founded in the aftermath of the French Revolution to serve as Catholic teachers to poor chil­dren in the countryside, and a group of priests which Father Moreau founded to be educators and to assist in local dioceses, were united and a new religious family was founded. Twenty-two years later, Pope Saint Pius IX approved Holy Cross as a religious Congregation of Pontifical Right. This enabled Father Moreau to immediately send young Holy Cross reli­gious from France to Algeria (1835), to the United States (1842), to Canada (1843) and to what is now Bangladesh (in 1856). 
It is likely that Father Moreau will be beatified on or near the patronal feast of the priests, brothers and sisters of Holy Cross, Our Lady of Sorrows, which is observed on Sept. 15. Plans are already underway for what will be a special moment of grace and blessing not only for the Church and for the members of Holy Cross, but also for the tens of thousands of people served by thousands of Holy Cross men and women in 17 countries around the world from Bangladesh and India, to Haiti, Peru, Brazil and Chile in South America, Canada, Mexico and the United States in North America, and Rwanda, Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania and Ghana in Africa, as well as France and Italy. 
In anticipation of this joyous occasion, the superior general of the Congregation of Holy Cross has declared a year of rejoicing and spiritual renewal through which Holy Cross religious are urged to deepen their commitment to consecrated life. He has also urged us to redouble our efforts to draw more young men to serve the Church as priests and broth­ers by the example of our life and work. 
Of course, Notre Dame will play a central role in all these efforts. 
In an attempt to prepare for Father Moreau's beati­fication and to rededicate ourselves to honor Mary as the patroness of the University, a number of steps have been taken by Campus Ministry. 
The painting of Our Lady of Lourdes which is to the left side of the main altar of the Basilica of the Sacred Heart, is decorated with candles and flowers on every feast of Mary and on special Notre Dame weekends, including home football weekends. It is out attempt to imitate Father Sarin's love for the Blessed Mother. A prayer card is available on these occasions which contains the Salve Regina. The words "our life, our sweetness and our hope," which are found on the seal of Our Lady's University, are drawn from this prayer. 
University President Father John Jenkins captured well how deeply our Marian roots run in his 
LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 

Perception in Mideast does matter 
Like Katie Palmitier (Oct. 4 col­umn "Candidates must discuss real issues"), I also wish that Iraq were a simple screw-up by a simplistic president, because then the solution would be obvious. And maybe Bush is as illogical in private as he is inarticulate on television. But as the "reality-based community" loves to point out, things are rarely so black and white, and the Iraq issue defi­nitely isn't. 
There is at least one compelling reason for invading Iraq that the Bush Administration has not, and cannot ever use in its rationale for invading Iraq. As Bush, the "neo­cons" and many others understood it, the "strategic equilibrium" in the Middle East was that Muslims and their governments had to either pay jihadist groups huge amounts of extortion money (Saudi Arabia et a!), or formally assist in the jihad against America {Iran, Syria, Iraq). 
The neocons, and many others now busy forgetting they ever agreed with the neocons about any­thing, all agreed that whatever the United States did in Iraq (or wher­ever it would intervene in the Mideast) would not last without establishing a basis for individual freedom in those countries, instead of the dictatorships that have for decades suppressed Muslim growth, initiative, etc. 
Unfortunately, then it wouldn't be humanitarian imperialism anymore. It would be something far more ambitious and threatening -an attempt to demolish the Mideastern order, primarily in America's national interest. How many moder­ate, quietly pro-American Muslim governments could have supported THAT rationale? It would have been impossible for a government in a Muslim-majority nation NOT to oppose the United States. 
Had Bush found weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) in Iraq, that would still not have justified the war. So many other very anti­American countries have WMDs and/or the money to buy them easi­ly. But the WMD rationale was mar­ketable. It was something that could fit the 45-second attention span of most voters, something that could be crammed into an abbreviated letter on an op-ed page. It would satisfy the liberals who cringe at any notion of waging war for national self-interest. And everyone -everyone -was absolutely sure they were there. 
But that's all too much work for most liberals. Instead, Bush is an idiot, a sock-puppet of Halliburton. A bumbling moron whose two victo­ries against "cerebral" faux-sophis­ticates was only due to stupid red­necks who pull the GOP lever as soon as Bush mutters "abortion" and "family values." Blacks and whites are just so much simpler than the truth. 
Reality is at least part-perception and part-reality. The war on terror­ism is heavily perception-driven, especially for the jihadis. And the perception isn't that America can­not win in Iraq if it doesn't achieve some remote semblance of unity. It's that, no matter how many al­Sadrites, Badrists, Sunni insurgents or al-Qaeda operatives Americans kill in Iraq, Bush is facing political collapse at home. Of course liberals are patriots with their own vision for a great America. Of course they aren't gleeful for every blow they land on Bush because they are unpatriotic. But what difference does it make?

Inaugura!Address when he spoke about the after­math of the devastating fire of 1879 which could have marked the end of Notre Dame. 
The story of what happened next has been passed down through generations of the Notre Dame family -and has helped shape our aspirations and our sense of who we are. Fr. Sarin walked through the ruins, felt the devastation of the community, and sig­naled to everyone to enter the Church, where he stood on the altar steps and spoke. 
"I came here as a young man and dreamed of building a great university in honor of Our Lady," he said. "But I built it too small, and she had to burn it to the ground to make the point. So, tomorrow, as soon as the bricks cool, we will rebuild it, bigger and better than ever." Later that same day, the students saw Father Sarin, then 65 years old, stepping slowly through the ruins of his life's work, bent slightly for­ward, pushing a wheelbarrow full of bricks, getting ready to rebuild. 
There will be numerous opportunities for all of us to join in the preparations for this joyous celebration. 
I hope all of you will celebrate with the Church and with us, as well as with students in Holy Cross insti­tutions throughout the world served by Holy Cross religious.

Don't forget about pro-life accomplishments 
Katie Palmitier (Oct. 4 column "Candidates must discuss real issues") comments that many Americans ignore the war in Iraq and focus only on other issues. She com­ments that the issues of flag burning, abortion and homosexual "marriage" affect "only a small number of people in our country." Yet over 30 million Americans have been aborted since abortion was legalized, and still over one million Americans are aborted every year. This does not sound like a small number of people to me, espe­cially when you take into account the mothers and fathers of the unborn babies, which gives another two million people right there. 
Furthermore, she comments that "after four years of Republicans controlling the House, Senate and the presidency, abortion has yet to be banned." While this is true, she does not consider the bigger picture in the pro-life movement. Nowhere is it mentioned in the column that the pro-life Congress and Presidency passed a law banning partial-birth abortion in 2003. Nowhere is it mentioned that President Bush vetoed a law which would have allowed federal funding to be used for stem­cell research and that the pro-life Congress voted to sustain his veto. And finally, nowhere does it mention that two anti-abortion justices have recently been nomi­nated by the President and confirmed by the Senate to the Supreme Court -a move which could one day overturn Roe v. Wade. 
While it is true that abortion has not yet been banned, it is unfair to imply that the administration has done little or nothing to combat this injustice. 
Therefore, I agree with Palmitier that we need to be conscious of a wide range of issues at election time, but I hope that we can be fair and objective in evaluating the job that each legislator and government representative has done.

William Shakespeare once wrote "we know what we are, but know not what we may be." That ideology has been put into practice in Shakespeare Behind Bars, a rehabili­tating program that's the subject of the documentary of the same name. 
In Shakespeare Behind Bars, pris­oners at the Luther Luckett Correction Complex in LaGrange, Kent. read, study and perform plays by the Bard. The documentary, origi­nally released in 2005, explores the lives of the inmates who participate in the program over the course of a year. 
Curt Tofteland founded the pro­gram over a decade ago, growing out of a program called Books Behind Bars, a literature-based idea intend­ed to curb juvenile delinquency. Tofteland used Books Behind Bars as a starting point, extrapolating its premise and applying it to theater. 
"The intellectual discussion of a book gets to a certain level of intel­lectual discourse, perhaps engaging the emotions, but when you have to act and inhabit a character in a play, it takes you to a deeper level," said Tofteland. 
Shakespeare was an obvious and logical choice for Tofteland for a variety of reasons. 
"He is the best writer about the human condition in any era, in any language, in any time period," Tofteland said. "In every population, Shakespeare has something for them." 
Perhaps most appealing to Tofteland is that Shakespeare's philosophies are manifested in dra­matic form, which he says helps con­victs to examine their characters and find the truth of those characters within themselves. He uses Macbeth as an example of a good man who does a bad thing, then faces the con­sequences of his decisions. 
"The 'therapeutic' aspect of Shakespeare, in particular with my inmates, is that it allows them to explore their crime, but through an aesthetic, having an aesthetic dis­tance from it," said Tofteland. "In exploring that in an authentic way, they can discover their own journey to their own crime, and in many cases it's a very cathartic and very 

the confessional scenes, when each man admits to his crime. These confessionals were not prompted, as Tofteland emphasized that it was a rule that nobody from the film crew was allowed to ask about the crimes. 
In other words, each inmate featured in the documentary elected to discuss their past, which both Tofteland and Spitzmiller believe helped them confront and move on from the things they had done. 
"If you think about the worst things you've ever done, are you willing to go there and figure out why you did it and try to reconcile? A lot of us try to put it away," Spitzmiller said. "I was impressed with the courage these men had."

Rogerson, looking for new material, decided he wanted to do something involving theater. According to producer Jilann Spitzmiller, the Shakespeare Behind Bars program was immediately appealing because of its profundity and uniqueness. 
Rogerson and his crew were grant­ed special access to prison, allowing them to film over 174 hours of footage over the course of a 9-month shoot. 
"It was pretty arduous to be in that

The film follows five of the inmates involved in the program as they pre­pare for a performance of "The Tempest." 
The film shows how the program helped the inmates discover things about themselves, especially during 2005. 
It also played at the New York Film Festival, where it was one of 16 doc­umentaries shown out of over 660 that applied. 
It has garnered 10 awards, includ­ing the Crystal Heart award at the Heartland Film Festival, and was a Grand Jury nominee at Sundance. 
"I think that the film has a lot to offer any community that believes in 
education and the power of educa­tion because that's precisely what the film is about," Tofteland said. "It isn't just education of the brain, it's at a much deeper level. It's educa­tion of the heart." 
Tofteland points out that though it's The Bard who is in the title of the film, "Shakespeare Behind Bars" is really about the inmates and their journeys. 
"It is a film about prison, it is a film about Shakespeare, but it's more about the power of art to heal. It's about redemption, it's about mercy and it's about forgiveness." 
"Shakespeare Behind Bars" will be screened tonight in the Browning Cinema of the DPAC at 7 and 10. Tofteland will be present at the 7 
p.m. screening.

Offense pulls Mets through pitching drought 
Kotsay's two-run homer helps Athletics defeat Twins; Oakland takes 2-0 lead in American League playoffs 
Associated Press 

NEW YORK -Minus two top starters, the New York Mets got dynamic postseason debuts from Carlos Delgado and David Wright to jump ahead of the Dodgers. 
Back in the playoffs for the first time since losing the 2000 Subway Series, the Mets capital­ized on a wild baserunning blun­der by Los Angeles and a perfect­ly respectable performance from emergency starter John Maine in a 6-5 victory Wednesday. 
Billy Wagner closed it for his first postseason save, fanning Nomar Garciaparra with a run­ner on second for the fmal out. 
Playing in the first playoff game of his 14-year career, Delgado had four hit<>, a mammoth homer and the go-ahead RBI in the sev­enth inning. Wright drove in three runs, helping the Mets take a 1-0 lead in the best-of-five series. 
Game 2 is Thursday night, with rookie left-bander Hong-Chih Kuo on the mound for the Dodgers against 290-game win­ner Tom Glavine. Kuo pitched six shutout innings at Shea Stadium on Sept. 8 for his only major league win. 
The Mets started a rookie of their own in the opener after Orlando Hernandez tore a muscle in his right calf while jogging in the outfield Tuesday. He is expected to miss the entire post­season. 
Already without injured ace Pedro Martinez, New York scrambled Tuesday night to find a healthy, rested 
opposite-field drive off the base of the right-field wall. But Jeff Kent hesitated at second base, appar­ently thinking the ball might be caught, and got an extremely late jump. 
That left J.D. Drew, who was on first, practically running up Kent's back as coach Rich Donnelly waved one -or both­around third. A quick, accurate relay from right fielder Shawn Green to second baseman Jose Valentin to catcher Paul Lo Duca nailed Kent, who attempted a headfirst dive into the plate. 
Drew was left in no-man's land, trapped about halfway between third and home. But Lo Duca, who got spun around on the play at the plate, didn't realize that at first as he struggled to his feet. 
With Lo Duca unaware for a moment, Drew tried to sneak his way in. But Maine pointed at Lo Duca, alerting him that another runner was coming. The catcher turned his head, suddenly noticed Drew bearing down on him and applied a second tag as Drew also tried a headfirst dive. 
It was the kind of sequence you often see in a Hollywood movie, but rarely on a major league field. 
Marlon Anderson followed with an RBI double down the third base line for a 1-0 lead, but that was all the Dodgers got after run" ning themselves out or a poten­tially big inning.

"It was the worst feeling in the world. You can't do anything about it," said Hunter, who blamed himself' for the defeat. 
The A's handled the Boof -Bonser, that is -and here's the truth: Oakland has arrived at yet another elimination game. The perennial playoff underperform­ers are 0-9 in those since 2000, losing four straight first-round series. 
"This team knows what to do," said Eric Chavez, a regular on all four of those clubs. "We're hard­nosed baseball players that like to play the game. I don't think anybody here, regardless if they've been in this position, is going to take Game 3lightly." 
The series shifts west Friday, with Twins right-hander Brad Radke taking his broken shoulder socket to the mound for possible the final appearance of his 12­year career. 
Dan Haren, in his frrst postsea­son start, will pitch for Oakland -which beat Cy Young Award favorite Johan Santana in Game 1 and now gets two chances to close it out at home. 
"We've won two games. OK. Congratulations. Good job. But it's not over yet," said Nick Swisher, who doubled against Juan Rincon and scored on Joe Nathan's wild pitch in the ninth. 
The A's had one mishap in the ninth, however. Second baseman Mark Ellis broke his right index fmger swinging at a high, inside pitch, and Oakland said it would update his condition at Thursday's workout. 
For the Twins, it's certainly not over, considering they came from 12 1/2 games back to win the AL Central. Plus, there's the recent history of these A's, even tbough Chavez and Barry Zito are the only players remaining from 2000 and just a handful are left from 2003. 
"We've been backed up before," Twins manager Ron Gardenhire said. "We've been told, 'you're done' before. That's not something that this team takes too lightly. We'll come out and battle. We'll give them every­thing we have." 
Oakland starter Esteban Loaiza slipped in the sixth inning, sur­rendering consecutive solo homers to Michael Cuddyer and Justin Morneau that evened the game at 2. 
But with Jason Kendall on first, two outs in the seventh and reliever Dennys Reyes pitching, Kotsay hit what should have been a single. Hunter, bothered by a sore left foot this season, charged forward. 
The ball sliced to Hunter's left, and his reach wasn't long enough to get near it. 
"There's only one person in this league that can make that catch, and it's Torii," said Cuddyer, who watched from right field. "Although it's as close as you come, he's not Superman."

ARLINGTON, Texas­While Buck Showalter wasn't the only person to blame for the Texas Rangers missing the play­offs again, the manager got fired for it. 
"There's a shared responsibility there, some ·or which is Buck's, some of which is mine, and a good deal to the players," gen­eral manager Jon Daniels said Wednesday. "This is an organizational goal to win. When we don't do it, it falls on all of us." 
The ax fell on Showalter after his fourth season, an 80-82 mark that was the Rangers' sixth losing 
IN BRIEF 

Tyson asks Ohioans to pay
$25 to see him· workout 
YOUNGSTOWN. Ohio -Mike Tyson surfaced in Ohio last week to sell the citizenry on the idea of pay­ing to watch him work up a sweat. It wasn't really his idea but, hey, Lennox Lewis still doesn't have any children, and a guy's gotta eat. 
The same Tyson who used to sepa­rate heads from bodies is now trying to separate the people of Youngstown from some of their hard-earned cash. 
"Where else are you going to be able to see Mike Tyson for $25?" his new promoter asked. 
Hmmm, the circus maybe? At least there you might get the painted lady and the sword swallower thrown in for the same price. 
Anyway, the Mike Tyson World Tour 2006 is now official. It may be kicking off in a not-so-worldly place -and no one seems to have any idea where it goes after that -but it record in seven yea~s since last making the play· off's in 1999 despite a ros­ter with several young All­Stars. 
Daniels, the 29-year-old GM who was the youngest ever in the major leagues when he was hired a year ago Wednesday, recom­mended Showalter's firing and reached a mutual decision with owner Tom Hicks before a planned dinner among the trio Tuesday night. 
"This decision was not based exclusively on the '06 season and our lack of accomplishing our goals," Daniels said. "It's more about looking forward, and what gives us the 
is official. Dementieva defeats unseeded player to advance to quarters 
STUTTGART, Germany-Third· seeded Elena Dementieva of Russia overcame cramps and unforced errors to beat Katarina Srebotnik of Slovenia 4-6, 7-5, 7-5 and reach the quarterfinals of the Porsche Grand Prix on Wednesday. 
Also gaining the quarterfinals was second-seeded Russian Svetlana Kuznetsova, the former U.S. Open champion who swept past German wild-card Martina Muller 6-1, 6-4. 
In first-round matches, !veta Benesova of the Czech Hepublic, who lost in qualifying but replaced an injured Ana Ivanovic in the draw, advanced when seventh-seeded Francesca Schiavone of Italy retired with a right wrist injury while trail­ing 6-3, 6-7 (5), 3-0, and eighth­seeded Jelena Jankovic of Serbia beat 1993 champion and two-time runner-up Mary Pierce of France 7-6 chance to achieve those goals ... I'm very confident that we made the right decision." 
Showalter was 319-329 with the Rangers, his third managerial job, and is owed $5.1 million for the three seasons left on his contract. Texas never fin­ished above third place. 
"You never heard me make an excuse all year, and I'm not going to start now. We just didn't get it done," Showalter told The Associated Press in a phone interview. "They want to go in a new direc­tion with a new voice. With the shelf life of man­agers, I feel fortunate." 
Daniels acknowledged 
(7), 6-3. "The Girl in the Dugout"still tending to Padres 
SAN DIEGO -Kelly Calabrese took a break from treating the aches and pains of major leaguers to jog out to the first-base line to take her place among the San Diego Padres players and staff. 
"There's nothing like on opening day or during playoffs running out on the field and getting introduced," Calabrese said. 
"I still get chills every time it hap­pens. It's phenomenal." 
Yeah, five months after being called out on the air by Keith Hernandez, "the girl in the dugout" is doing OK. She's doing her part to keep the two-time NL West champi­ons healthy enough to face the St. Louis Cardinals -even if there's nothing she can do for their lethargic bats, which helped contribute to San Diego's 5-1 loss in Game 1 of their division series on Tuesday. 
that he would be looking for a different kind of com­municator, but played down what impact any players' discontentment with Showalter and the manager's hands-on approach had with the decision. 
"That was nothing that was ever communicated to me," Daniels said. "I didn't have any direct conversa­tions with the players." 
Showalter was the AL manager of the year only two years ago, when AL MVP Alex Rodriguez was traded in the spring and the Rangers went on to contend for a playoff spot until the final few games of the season.

McNabb and Owens not soon to apologize 
Former Philadelphia teammates say they are ready for big game Sunday as media scrutiny intensifies 
Associated Press 
IRVING, Texas -Here they go again: Terrell Owens and Donovan McNabb have their signals crossed. 
Days before the buddies­turned-enemies face off for the first time since their nasty breakup, a misunderstanding is brewing over a text message MeNabb says he sent Owens last week after a trip to the hospital was reported as an attempted suicide. 
Owens said Wednesday he never got it. While he stopped short of calling McNabb a liar, the sour look on his face sure seemed to insinuate it. 
Asked later if it was possible McNabb sent the message to an old phone number, Owens said: "Look, I'm not trying to start anything. He's a smart guy. If he wanted my number, he could've gotten it." 
Earlier Wednesday, in sepa­rate interviews with reporters in Philadelphia and on a con­ference call with reporters in Dallas, McNabb said he reached out to Owens to "let him know that I was thinking about him praying for him," adding that he hoped "every­thing would turn out well and that he'd get back out on the field and be healthy." 
"And if he needed anything, to call," McNabb said he wrote. 
McNabb said he never got a response, but added he wasn't looking for one, either. 
"I think the message was sent," McNabb said. "If he read it or received it, then I think he would know." 
T.O. and McNabb could hash things out in person -but likely won't-on Sunday when the Cowboys (2-1} visit Philadelphia to take on the Eagles (3-1}. While the game is a pivotal early-season matchup for first place in the NFC East, all eyes will be on Owens and how the City of Brotherly Love vents its anger toward him for tearing apart its team. 
"Once we win, it will be spe­cial," Owens said, later clarify­ing he wasn't guaranteeing a victory. "We're not going there to taste the cheesesteaks. We're not going there to visit the crack in the Liberty Bell. We're going up there to try to win a ballgame." 
Owens was a model citizen when he arrived in Philadelphia in 2004, saying he wanted to catch passes from McNabb and get the team to the Super Bowl after three near-misses. And he did. 
Although he missed the play­offs with an ankle surgery, he returned for the Super Bowl and played well, but Philadelphia lost. 
Then everything went hay­wire. 
Owens trashed McNabb, demanded a new contract and caused all sorts of problems. He was sent home for a week in training camp, then was kicked out for good with nine games left. Finally cut in March, he signed with the Cowboys four days later. In July, he released an autobiog­raphy in which he said the root of his problems with McNabb were being cussed at in the huddle; McNabb later referred to Owens' literary effort as a "children's book." 
Owens has made no secret about looking forward to get­ting revenge. He's often said this game has been circled on his calendar since the schedule was released, even telling Sports Illustrated he worked out in sets of 10-8, referencing the Oct. 8 game. McNabb mocked that while talking to Dallas reporters. 
"I got my eight in just a few minutes ago," he said, laugh­ing. "I did eight push-ups, eight curls and I was just so focused, I'm ready to go." 
Without knowing about that jab, Owens threw one of his own Wednesday, slipping it in while praising McNabb for a strong start this season. 
"Obviously, he's gotten him­self into a lot better shape this year," Owens said. "I think you can tell that by the way he's running around.... I wouldn't say he was out of shape. But I think everybody notices he has slimmed down a little bit and he's moving around better." 
About the only thing T.O. and McNabb agree on? Neither is interested in a symbolic, hatchet-burying handshake. 
"I don't feel like I have to go out of the way to appease you guys, to try to create some type of story," Owens said. 
Said McNabb: "The whole world doesn't have to see us shaking hands, high-fiving, hugging, chest bumping. Because after that it will be, 'Well, they made up,' and you guys will come up with some bad clich or bad little funny jokes about it. We have a job to d0." 
Owens has started talking to local reporters only on Wednesdays, so he knew this was his day to put on a show. He walked into the locker room ready to do just that, eagerly saying, "Man!" upon seeing the crowd already gath­ered around his stall. 
His first state­ment came from

"There's nothing extra that I

said. ''I'm going to go into this 
game and try to score touch­
downs and try to go in there 
and do the best I can do." 
Strangely, his take on the 
significance of this game 
wavered from one extreme to 
the other. 
At times, he expounded on 
this being a huge event: ''I'm 
pretty sure it will be the most­
watched game throughout the 
course of the year, besides the 
Super Bowl." He also said, "To 
that city, it's almost like a play­

Other times, he made it seem 
like a minor subplot: "It's been a rivalry around here for years, the Cowboys and -Eagles. With me being here, there's just some added excite­
ment."

Defending Stanley Cup chan1ps fall to Buffalo at hon1e 
Senators goalie Martin Gerber has 33 saves in Ott~wa's 4-1 season-opening victory over the Maple Leafs 
Associated Press 
RALEIGH, N.C. -Daniel Briere figured out just in time how to help the Buffalo Sabres get the win they couldn't secure in June. 
Briere scored the only goal in a shootout and Ryan Miller stopped Carolina cold to give the Sabres a 3-2 victory over the Stanley Cup-champion Hurricanes on Wednesday night in a season-opening rematch of last season's Eastern Conference finals. 
Briere, the Sabres' first shootout skater, faked right and beat Cam Ward with a baekhan­der for the only goal in the tiebreaker. 
"I didn't know what I would do until I got there," Briere said. 
Jason Pominville and Chris Drury each had goals during regulation for the Sabres, who lost Game 7 and vowed to use the defeat as motivation this season. 
Before the season opener, they stayed in their locker room and listened to the raucous celebra­tion while the Hurricanes raised their championship banner and celebrated their first Cup title. 
"Their emotions were running high at the start," Miller said. "We just sat in here during the celebration, but we could hear it. I'm just really happy with the way we competed." 
Miller made 32 saves in regu­lation and overtime and then came up big in the shootout against a Hurricanes team that was 8-2 in the tiebreaker last season. 
"We had a couple of good opportunities. They just didn't go in," Carolina def'enseman Mike Commodore said. 
Ray Whitney missed the net on the first attempt, before Miller stopped Eric Staal with his stick on the second and blocked Erik Cole's weak attempt on the third. 
Ward stopped 30 shots, Staal and Cole had goals. and Whitney had two assists for the Hurricanes, who held one final pregame party with the Stanley Cup before they began the task of defending their title. 
"We had the time to celebrate, and we did so appropriately, and now we've got to turn the page," Ward said. 
During the 20-minute celebra­tion, flashbulbs popped, those rowdy 'Caniacs whooped it up, and the Scorpions' "Rock You Like a Hurricane" blared. Then, the championship banner ­commemorating the first major professional title won by a team from North Carolina -was raised to the rafters. 
The Sabres took over from there, withstanding a flurry of early shots by Carolina and eventually silencing the sellout crowd at the RBC Center. 
The Hurricanes fed off the crowd's early energy and out­shot the Sabres 11-1 during the opening minutes. 
"I've seen it go both ways, where a team has come out flat or come out and used the ener­gy," Hurricanes coach Peter Laviolette said. "I think we came out real strong, used the energy in the building." 
But Pominville gave Buffalo an early lead midway through the first period when he redirected Dmitri Kalinin's shot from the blue line to make it 1-0. That goal came about a minute after Cole's wrist shot from close range bounced ofT the left post. 


Ottawa 4, Toronto 1 
Martin Gerber made 33 saves, and the Ottawa Senators beat the Toronto Maple Leafs again by skating off with a victory in the season opener on Wednesday night. 
Patrick Eaves, Chris Neil, Cristoph Schubert and Daniel Alf'redsson scored for Senators, who lost top players Zdeno Chara and Martin Havlat in the offseason. 
They didn't need them against the Maple Leafs, who have been outscored 44-20 in losing eight of nine games to Ottawa. 
Mats Sundin scored on a breakaway for the Leafs, who are entering their 40th season since they last won the Stanley Cup. 
The provincial rivals will meet again in Ottawa on Thursday night. 
Before the game, the Maple Leaf's honored former greats Borje Salming, Red Kelly and Hap Day by raising their num­bers to the rafters. 
Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper and Ontario premier Dalton McGuinty watched from the stands. 
Toronto had. a few good chances early but couldn't score on Gerber, who was signed to replace Dominik Hasek in the offseason. 
Gerber won 38 games for Stanley Cup champion Carolina last season before losing his starting job to eventual Conn Smythe Trophy winner Cam Ward. 
Ottawa jumped out to a 3-0 lead by the middle of the second period. 
Eaves scored on the power play at 19:29 of the first after Dany Heatley made a pass from behind the net to Tom Preissing, whose shot deflected off goalie Andrew Raycraft to Eaves. 
Neil made it 2-0 at 10:13 of the second by skating in on a 2­on-1 and putting a backhander over Raycraft's right shoulder before crashing into the net. 
Schubert scored just over a minute later after he shot the puck in ofT Raycraft. 
Just 30 seconds later, Ottawa's Anton Volchenkov took down Sundin on a breakaway _ caus­ing a penalty shot. Sundin's shot trickled under Gerber and just past the goal line. 
Dallas 3, Colorado 2 
Darryl Sydor came out of the penalty box to take a pass from goaltender Marty Turco and score the winning goal at 2:07 of overtime Wednesday night, and the Dallas Stars beat the Colorado Avalanche, extending their season-opening unbeaten streak to 10 years. 
Turco stopped several power­play shots from the Avalanche, the last one by Marek Svatos, before swatting the puck to Sydor as he streaked to center ice. Sydor took the puck in stride and beat Jose Theodore over his right shoulder. 
Sydor began the overtime in 
the penalty box for slashing after the third period ended. 
The Stars' 7-0-3 mark since 1995 is the fourth-longest unbeaten opening-night streak in NHL history. Colorado still owns the NHL's best opening­night record at 15-6-6. 
The Stars trailed 2-0 after two periods but tied it in the third on goals 28 seconds apart by Mike Modano and Loui Eriksson, then overcame the Avs' power play to beat the team that knocked them out of the playoffs five months ago. 
Dallas won a franchise-best 53 games last season only to be eliminated by the underdog Avalanche in the first round of the playoffs. 
The Stars added six-time All­Star center Eric Lindros, center Jeff Halpern, right wing Matthew Barnaby and Sydor, a defenseman, over the summer. Lindros was limited to 33 games last season in Toronto because of a wrist injury. 
The Avs' offseason was marked by another exodus of veterans. 
Rob Blake, Dan Hinote and Alex Tanguay followed last year's departing class of Peter Forsberg, Adam Foote and Paul Kariya out of town, and Steve Konowalchuk joined them when an EKG revealed a genetic dis­ease that can cause irregular heart rhythms and forced his into retirement. 
The Avs are counting on rook­ie forward Wojtek Wolski to fill the void left by the Tanguay trade, and he made an immedi­ate impression by scoring one of the Avs' two power-play goals in the first period, when the Avalanche outshot the Stars 22­7.

ON TOP OF THE WORLD 

Associated Press 
NASHVILLE, Tenn. -The winless Tennessee Titans held a players-only meeting Wednesday, encouraged each other and pledged to recom­mit themselves. 
The Titans need all the cooperation they can muster to survive the next five games without tackle Albert Haynesworth, arguably their second-best defensive player. 
It won't be easy. 
The Titans (0-4) ranked last in the NFL in yards rushing with the physical 6-f'oot-6, 320-pound Haynesworth. Now they must face the league's hi.ghost-seoring offense in Peyton Manning and the Indianapolis Colts ( 4­
0) on Sunday. 
"We're at a point now where we're hopefully at rock bottom, and we have to find a way to climb our way out of it," Titans defensive end Kyle Vanden Bosch said. "It hurts. It hurts our defensive line. Everybody's kind of taken it upon themselves to pick up the slack and make up for, you know, what we're losing with Albert." 
Haynesworth had more starts and had played more games than any other defen­sive lineman for Tennessee and was the Titans' best run­stopper. But his unprecedent­ed suspension for kicking Dallas center Andre Gurode twice in the head, leading to 30 stitches, has left the Titans in a bind. 
With Haynesworth, the Titans are giving up an aver­age of 177 yards rushing ­worst in the NFL through the first four games. They haven't held an opponent under 100 yards since their season opening 23-16 loss to the New York Jets. 
They have allowed more than 390 yards in three of four games, holding only Miami under 290 yards and still losing. 
The Titans on Tuesday signed Tony Brown, a two-year player with four starts and 17 games to replace Haynesworth on the roster. Linebacker Keith Bulluck said replacing Haynesworth will be tough and requires a collective effort on defense. 
"Anybody who's seen Albert Haynesworth play knows that he's a force to be reckoned with, one of the better defensive tackles in this league, definitely up-and-coming or on the verge of making his mark in this league," Bulluck said. "You can't replace that man because he is so dominating when he's in there." 
Haynesworth's 27 tackles are first among the team's defen­sive linemen, with Vanden Bosch a close second at 26. 
Veteran Robaire Smith has been slowed by a strained right hamstring, and this is the first week he hasn't been on the injury report since the opener. Randy Starks is in his third sea­son, and rookie Jesse Mahelona is questionable with a sprained knee. 
Indianapolis coach Tony Dungy said he's always looked at one player's misfortune as another's opportunity. He cited Kurt Warner replacing Trent Green in St. Louis and Tom Brady taking over for injured Drew Bledsoe in New England as prime examples.

Bass' performance. "He didn't handle crucial situations well. Hopefully that is something he corrected in practice this week." 
Nationally 20th ranked Notre Dame junior Sheeva Parbhu enters the tournament at 3-1 this season and 68-16 in his career. Parbhu won three of his four games at Notre Dame's Thomas Fallon Invitational Sept. 24. Parbhu fell to Western Michigan's 94th ranked Brady Crosby. 
Neither Parbhu nor Bass are new to the national circuit. Bass reached the quarterfmals of the 2005 National Indoors Champion-ship

Bayliss hopes that the duo will once again succeed this week. Parbhu has worked on expanding the limits on his forehand, allowing him to hit deeper and harder and making him more of threat. Bayliss said Bass is no longer just focused on his defensive game -he has turned into an all-court player. 
The duo heads down to Oklahoma under the guidance of assistant coach Ryan Sachire. Sachire played the professional circuit before coming to Notre Dame and was among the top 300 in the ATP. Bass and Parbhu have had the advantage of competing against Sachire during practice this week -a challenge Bayliss hopes has made them stronger.

Schwapp 
continued from page 24 
Schwapp will be eligible for a medical redshirt since he par­ticipated in just two games this season. Any player who suffers an injury in the first three games and sits out the rest of the season because of the injury can apply for an extra year of eligibility, according to NCAA rules. 
Weis said the knee problem was a recurrence of an injury Schwapp suffered before he came to Notre Dame. 
"I don't know the extent of what it is because the injury is an old injury that just reoc­curred," Weis said. "I don't know how old that is, but [it didn't originate] while he was here." 
Weis said he is confident that backup fullback Ashley McConnell can continue to replace Schwapp without a drop in performance. 
"We haven't had [Schwapp] since Penn State, so there's no impact," Weis said. "We play the next guy." 
Weis said the number of two-back sets he called initial­ly dropped after Schwapp's injury but has returned to normal after three games with McConnell as the starter. 
With McConnell solidified as the No. 1 fullback, that moves freshman Luke Schmidt into the mix as the backup. At 6­foot-3 and 252 pounds, Schmidt came to Notre Dame with the potential to be a between-the-tackles, pound­ing halfback or a hole-opening fullback. 
"[Schmidt] has been steadily on the rise the whole season," Weis said. "He's fit in better at this point as a fullback, and he's made steady progress." 
But Weis said the freshman wouldn't be the only option for the Irish at the No. 2 fullback spot. Without elaborating, Weis said he had some ideas about what the team could do. 
Notes: 
+ Weis said the player he is least sure will return to the field this week is running back Travis Thomas, who suffered a rib injury on the last play of the game against Michigan State and did not play against Purdue. Weis called Thomas "iffy" to play against Stanford. 
"When you have sore ribs, running around is not the issue, getting hit is the issue," Weis said. "If [Thomas] does­n't play this week, it'll have nothing to do with anything but precautionary measures." 
+ 
Weis said he is "encour­aged" by the progress of Notre Dame's No. 3 receiver, David Grimes. Weis said Grimes had a "95 percent" chance of avoiding missing prolonged time because of his injury. 

+ 
Weis also said that injured cornerback Ambrose Wooden, who has not played since Notre Dame lost to Michigan in Week 3, looks close to starting against Stanford. 

+ 
Kickoff specialist Bobby Henkes has taken all his usual kickoffs in practice this week after sitting out the Purdue game with a muscle strain.

McGlinn vs. Farley 
Farley's Finest hope to extend their two-game winning streak tonight at 8 when they face McGlinn at Riehle West Field. 
McGlinn has fought hard this season but has finished on the short end more times than not. The Shamrocks fell 25-6 to Breen-Phillips Sept. 24, and their disappointment continued last week when Howard shut out the Shamrocks, 20-0. 
"We've had a tough start to the season, but the team has been practicing very hard and we're hoping that everything will start coming together in [tonight's] game," said McGlinn captain Madeline Boyer. 
McGlinn will have to play well to reverse its fortunes against a confident Farley team. 
"Last week we had a great week and gained a lot of momentum," Farley captain Kim Crehan said. "Everyone played so well, and I'm proud of the way our team has come together." 
Like all teams, the Finest have their eyes set on the playoffs, and Crehan said she hopes Farley's recent per­formances will propel it to its goal after a rocky start to the season. 
The Finest had to play both teams from last year's champi­onship game -Pangborn and Pasquerilla West -in their opening two games. Farley picked up losses on both of these matchups, but the team didn't let those games ruin the season. After topping Howard, the Finest dominated both sides of the ball and topped Breen-Phillips in a 20-6 win Sunday.

Schwapp's season ends 
Weis says sophomore will have surgery today to repair knee 
By KEN FOWLER Sports Editor 

Notre Dame sophomore full­back Asaph Schwapp will have surgery on his left knee today and miss the rest of the season, Irish coach Charlie Weis said Wednesday. 
"From watching him today, he's not going to be able to play [this season]," Weis said. "The question isn't if we 'II have to have him in to get fixed, the question is when.... By having [the surgery] now, you have a chance at having him back for spring [prac­tices)." 
Schwapp played in Notre Dame's season-opening wins against Georgia Tech and Penn State. His left knee "locked up on him" once in practice early this season and then late in the Penn State contest, Weis said.

ND's Bass, Parbhu to playinITA 
By DEIRDRE KRASULA 
Sports Writer 
Senior captain Stephen Bass will lead Notre Dame as it begins the ITA All-American Championships in Oklahoma today. Bass hopes to get back on track this weekend after a tough beginning to his fall season. 
Bass, No. 21 in the Fila Collegiate Tennis Hankings, posted a 1-2 record at the Wolverine Invitational Oct. 1. He triumphed early over Boise State's Piotr Dilaj 6-3, 7-5, only to struggle in his follow­ing matches -falling to Michigan's Brian Hung 6-2, 6­2 and Vanderbilt's 28th ranked Hyan Preston 6-4, 6-3. Despite these setbacks, Bass still boasts a 74-35 career record. 
"I didn't see it coming," said Irish coach Bobby Bayliss of

Junior forward has 8 goals in team's 4­game winning streak 
By GREG ARBOGAST 
Sports Writer 
Junior forward Joseph Lapira scored two goals Wednesday, and the Irish defense, led by senior goal­keeper Chris Cahill, held Michigan scoreless en route to No. 8 Notre Dame's 2-0 win over the Wolverines in Ann Arbor. 
If the stats sound familiar, they should. 
His performance was the fourth consecutive multi-goal game for the junior, the third shutout in four games for the Irish defense, and -most importantly for Notre Dame coach Bobby Clark -Notre Dame's fourth consecutive victory. 
"It was a well-deserved win," Clark said. "We made a lot of good chances, and we

Ducks set for big gatne 
vs. defending champs 
Finest looking for 3 in a row in contest with the Shamrocks 
By KATE DONLIN and MATT HOPKE Sports Writers 
The Howard Ducks will have their work cut out for them tonight at 7 as they try to take down the defending league champions from Pasquerilla West at Riehle West Field. 
Last Sunday, the Weasels improved their record to 3-1 on the season with a 26-6 rout of Lewis. Pasquerilla West's wins have come against Breen­Phillips, Farley and Lewis. The Weasels' only loss this season was to Pangborn in a rematch of last year's championship game. 
"I think the number of return­ing players and coaches we have gives us a certain level of experience and maturity that has shown through in our play," Weasels captain Mo Spring said. "Just as important, we have a great group or freshmen that are enthusiastic and have fit in really well with the team chem­istry." 
Howard comes into the con­test with momentum on its side. Last week the Ducks dominated McGlinn in a 20-0 win. 
"We really pulled everything together on both sides of the ball," Howard captain Catherine Krug said. "Our oll'ense was on track and our defense really stepped up with some big inter­ceptions." 
The Ducks' season has been a series of ups-and-downs so far. In their first game, they edged out a 6-0 win over Lewis. But Howard was unable to contain the quick Pangborn offense in the second game of the season and fell to the Phoxes. More recently, the Ducks lost against Farley Oct. 29. 
But the big win Sunday against McGlinn has left Howard feeling optimistic about
