US Ships Enter Black Sea 
ISTANBUL (UPI) Two U.S. destroyers passed through the Dardcncllcs yesterday en route to the Black Sea in an apparent reply to the Soviet naval buildup in the Mediterranean. 
The Soviets have called the voyage of the USS Turner and Dyess "provocative" but the 
U.S. 6th Fleet has maintained the vessels arc on "routine operations" in the sc<t the Russians largely regard as their 
own.  
The  Black  Sea  borders  the  
Soviet  Union  for  about  I ,000  
miles.  

As the American vessels left the Dardenelles separating Europe and Asia at I :30p.m. Sunday and moved into the Sea of Marmara, the Russian press once again opened up with a barrage of criticism. 
The government newspaper Izvestia called the ships "unwelcome guests" which arc violating the 1936 treaty covering focign military vessels in the Black Sea. 
Izvestia said that because the United States was "in a state of war" in Vietnam it could not legally send ships into the sea. 
Naval incursions in to the sea arc regulated by the Montrcaux .Convention, signed 32 years ago by several countries, but not by the United States. However, it has abided by the treaty's rules which limit total tonnage of foreign ships in the Black Sea and the size of the guns they may carry. 
While 6th Fleet headquarters in Naples, Italy, declined to release details of the destroyers' mission, observers saw the voyage as a carefully calculated allied reply to the Soviet naval buildup in the Mediterranean after the Mideast was 18 month ago. Until that time the sea had been dominated by the American navy. 
Izvestia's contention that warships violated the Montrcaux Convention because the United States was in Vietnam differed from earlier Soviet contentions that supposed antisubmarine missiles aboard the Dyess 
violated the pact's limitations on larger in diameter than guns weaponry. allowed under the treaty. The allied argument is that

Panel Replaces Speaker 
3 Discuss Black Power 
Mr. Alfred P. Willi<tms, a member of the National Bu<trd of Directors for the NAACP, was supposed to speak last night at Moreau Seminary on "Black Power and White People." Instead, Mr. Williams had to cancel his appearance because of a sudden attack of the Hong Kong nu. 
Mr. Williams did send a tape of a speech given by Dr. Charles Hamilton, a professor of political science at the University of Chicago, which expressed his similar views on the question of black power. 
The Moreau Academic Commission, with this short notice, was able to assemble William Turner, a graduate student in Sociology here at Notre Dame, and Mr. Sam Winston, a prominent member of the Black South Bend community. 
In the tape, Dr. Hamilton discussed three basic ideas which face today's society. First, Dr. Hamilton stated that if an"institution of society did not coincide with the values and aspirations of the groups in this society, then this group would be alienated from this society, and the institution would then be illcgitimit." 
His scco n d idea evolved around political modcrni:t.ation. Dr. Hamilton stated that although "white Americans sec the interest in the development of the black community, they name black people to an advisory board which never meets nor never advises." He said that black people must not 

be caught up in this seeming awareness of the white people. Dr. Hamilton next pointed 
out  the  impact  of  these  two  
previous  ideas.  "Blak Power is  
talking  to  ourselves  about  

ourselves. We do not need the advice from white people. The present institution has not come out with answers. If they have, they have kept them in hiding. 
Therefore, we must find the 
answers ourselves and change the 
present institution." 

After the tape, Winston and Turner were asked their opinion on Hamilton's talk. They both said that they agreed with what he had said. When asked what black power is, Mr. Winston said that he usually answers: "What is white power? Whatever it is, I want it." 
Turner was asked if this black power should not be a cooperation between white and black rather than jus\ black people. He pointed out that the 
'"black people have been faced !with a consistent and systematic rejection by white people." He compared the white society as a snake pit with its poisonous snakes -the George Wallaces-and the non-poisonous 
snakes the Father Groppis. 

"The black people arc tired of going into the snake pit looking for the fl'ln-poisonous snakes and being bit by the poisonous ones. Look what happened to Martin L u t h c r K in g. The non-poisonous arc going to have to come out on the rim," said Turner. 
One question was raised from the floor concerning Hamilton's logic in saying that there was a breaking point at the 1964 Democratic Convention when the delegates representing the Negro proplc from Mississippi were not seated. 
He said that instead of this being a breaking point, it showed that there is a democratic solution to the change rather than just black power.

The Senior Christmas

The other night, while studying in my room, I turned down the record player and listened for a while to sounds from the hall outside. Besides the usual shouts and curses, it seemed many people were speaking of Christmas. 
Throughout the campus, it seems, the dull resignation of parts of the long fall has been replaced by eager anticipation of the coming vacation. I look back myself to freshman year, as every evening we would have a checkoff ceremony on the big calendar in 235 Farley. Dave White would mark a giant "X" through another day and then pronounce the number of days remaining until the hour of liberation. 
There was in those days a security in the present. We all had three more years of Notre Dame ahead of us. Looking back, I remember the long hours spent arguing with Howard Dooley, hours in which I doggedly espoused the cause of Young Americans for Frccdom, thinking I could reconvert a half-dozen reformed Goldwatcritcs. On second floor Farley people bugged Richard Rossie about why he chose to come here instead of going to Harvard. ln Cavanaugh a favorite topic of conversation was "the crazy loud kid from Hawaii with no hair, Charlie Nau." 
Needless to say, everything is changed now, even our outlooks towards Christmas. The prospect of leaving Notre Dame is uppermost in the minds of many. Even the most purposctul arc unsure of where they arc going and what they arc going to do. Above all looms the prospect of being called upon to serve one's country, the service being to risk one's life and quite possibly die for Thicu and Ky. 
Looking ahead is with its extreme uncertainties and challenges not that much fun, and a realization which c~mes over you makes it a rather unpcasant business. Regardless of what I may say in this column or what Richard Rossie may say to h. Riehle, a fe-eling has developed for this university. This affection is best manifested in the relationships we have developed while here. Many have built an <.:xistence at Notre Dame on five or six close friends and perhaps an equal number of faculty. This existence is going to be shattered with the coming of J unc. Whereas we arc now tightly knit little groups we will soon be radically alone. 
The realizations which come over one as he fills out his 
applications or thinks of what he will be doing a year from now lead 
to different reactions. One friend of mine sees himself as growing 
away from people. Another says he is making a conscious effort to 
lessen his dependency on people he is close to. With almost 
everybody there is the desire to be alone more. At last year's 
pre-Christmas Senior parties instead of joviality there was a deadly 
solemnity. 

I have always thought of Christmas as both a joyous time of year and a sentimental occasion. As a rule, the gay and happy aspects arc emphasit.cd, especially when one has only three weeks of liberty from "the monastary." 
However, from talking with those I know, I have a hunch the twenty days arc going to be a time of meaning and reflection more than unrestrained enjoyment. There is a life which is about to end a ~ifc in a ~c.lf-~ontaincd university. This life has been characterized by 1ts conVJVIahty and by the opportunity to relax. Our existence bey on~ Junc, _in contrast, is anything but certain and in a society wh1ch IS anythmg but self-contained. 
Thus the Senior Christ mas, as 1 sec it, is a time of finding direction. We shall probably attend more parties than on any other holiday. We will smile bravely as we meet elderly relatives, and grimace as parents throw up the usual barrage of "What arc you going to do with yourself?" inquiries. However, all the while we arc going to be thinking of what lies ahead and in which direction we will be headed as the Golden Dome and its icon fade into the distance.

Sidon Lew. .'He'sUnbelievable, Man' 
By TERRY O'NEIL Before Saturday's Notre Dame-UCLA basketball game, it was obvious that the Irish game plan must necessarily include: 
I) An effective fast break. 
2) A hot shooting night. .3) Lot of prayers. Johnny Dee had all three in 
mind as he prepared for the game. Dee is a fundamentalist, not at all the type of guy who ~would spend endless, sleepless nights dreaming up a magical defense to stop Lew Alcindor 
and his No. I teammates. 
When Dee said, "We're just 
gonna play basketball," he 
meant it. His boys had run well 
and shot well in a series of pre­
season exhibitions; he hoped 
they could continue. 
There were some problems, though. Forward Bob Arnzen was still suffering from tendon­itis in his Achilles tendon. He wasn't jumping or shooting well 
in practice, but Dee said, "In a game like this, you have to go with your best and Arnzen's our best in that position." 
The biggest problem was Alcindor. But Dee believes firm­ly in the man-to-man defense so he sent out his best, Sid Catlett, to guard Mr. A. The rest of the

Notre Dame won two 
events---the 400-yard medley

the trick in the former event. "Mike Davis, May, Tom Schatz and Ladouceur copped the latter contest. 
Irish were to drop off their op­ponents when possible and give Sid aid. 
For the first nine and a half glorious minutes Saturday, Notre Dame did all those things that a UCLA conqueror must do. The Irish missed very few shots, hustled on both boards and committed almost no de­fensive errors. 
At 10:39 Catlett jumped into Alcindor's lap and rammed the ball in. It was his third con­secutive in-tight shot after two misses, two rebounds and count­less beautiful moves. Coming back down court, he raised two triumphant fists and glanced at the scoreboard: Notre Dame 25, UCLA 16. 
Then Kenny Heitz' jumper and Curtis Rowe's tip-in made it 25-20. Time out Notre Dame. 
After which Mr. A. took con-trol. He scored 14 of his team's next 17 points, missing not one field goal in that stretch. Still the Irish game was near per­fection and the home squad led 39-38 after Lew's barrage. 


But you knew it couldn't last. Whitmore couldn't continue hit· ting every 20-footer and Sid was becoming exhausted from the task of screaming at, leaning on, elbowing and hand fighting Lew.

UCLA 49-39--88 *denotes all-lime record holder it open, outscoring the Irish 144 following the lap. 
Dec summed it up: "We just went dry a couple minutes. You expect it to happen in any game. It happens to all teams. But do it against these guys and it'll kill you." 
Furthermore, the Irish run­ning game, sporadic in the first half, stopped completely after intermission. "II. fast break starts with a rebound," said Dec. "How do you run when you can't get it off the board?" 
Kenny Heitz, UCLA guard, also had a comment on the game's deliberate pace. "We were ready for it," he said. "Willie Naulls (former Bruin) came into our practice the other day and told us (Austin) Carr was another Lucius /\.lien, ex­cept bigger and stronger. Willie saw him in Chicago last year. 
"Coach told us that if Carr tried to run, we better be back there with two men waiting for him. So we hustled back all the time. 
"Actually, we would have liked to run more ouselves. Bill Sweek and myself tried to get Carr and (Tom) Sinnott tired in the first half. Then Terry Schofield and Don Saffer came in. They're a little quicker than Bill and myself and they got a couple breakaway baskets," Heitz explained. 
..We have 12 good men and we usc all of them. That way everybody's fresh. Our best guard, .lol111 Vallely, is back in 

L.A. with the llu. But the rest of us all saw a lot of action," Kenny continued. "That's what makes us so good." 
Yeah, that and Lew . 

"You're right about that," Heitz grinned. "Nothing human can stay with Lew ll.lcindor one-on-one. I don't know what the man (Dec) was thinking a­bout when he assigned just one man to him. 
"North Carolina tried that same thing against us last year (with strong 6-I I pivotman Rusty Clark) and Lew destroyed him. Since he's been in college, this is the first time he's been under 35 points against a straight man-to-man defense." 
Yeah, Kenny, but what hap­pens when you gang up on Lew? 
"Well, we got a lot of other shooters on this team and if you have two men on Lew, that mean's somebody else is open." 
Can't lake him one-to-one 'cause he's too big...can't gang up on him cause the rest of 'em will shoot. ..can't run against 'em cause you can't get it off the board...can't shoot inside a­gainst 'em cause he'll block your shots. . .can't press 'em cause they'll throw him a high lob pass at about mid-court. .. 
Take it from Sid -"He's un­believable, man."
