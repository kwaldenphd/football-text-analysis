The missing Knute Rockne statue from the lobby of the Rockne Memorial is resting comfortably on a F!orida beach, according to a ransom note that accompanied this photograph. 
Ransom message demands beer 
in return for stolen Rockne bust 
By MARGARET FOSMOE andJEFF HARRINGTON 
News Editors 

Knute Rockne is alive and well and basking in the Florida sun­shine, according to a ransom note delivered yesterday to the Observer 
office. The message was the first received since the bronze bust of the famous Notre Dame football coach disappeared from its pedes­tal in the Rockne Memorial two weeks ago. The note, which indicated the bust would not be returned "till the students have their beer," was addressed to "Father Ted" and signed "Rock." A photograph ac­companying the note showed the bust sunning on a beach, sur­rounded by a keg of beer, a portable stereo and a frisbee. Administrators say the note is the first bit ofinformation received concerning the whereabouts of the pilfered statue. "You can tum (the note) over to Security for material evidence," chuckled Director of Information Services 
Richard Conklin. 
A major investigation has not been launched into the case ofthe kidnapped coach, although Security is looking for · leads, according to Glenn Terry, director ofsecurity. "I think we'd like to get it back since it's part ofthe Univer­sity," he noted. 
Anne Schellinger, the security investigator assigned to the case, echoed the University's wish to recover the bust soon. "I'm hoping it will tum up when graduation turns up. It's got a lot ofsentimen­tal value to the University ... .It's not so much the monetary value." 
The statue, approximately two feet tall and two feet broad at the base, was mysteriously hoisted from its perch in the foyer of the building on the night of May 3. 
The only clue left at the scene of the crime was a note: "I'll be back when there's a real administra­tion." 
Conklin said, "The (first) note indicated that is was students who took it as a prank." 
Another clue to the heist may be the miniature statue of Father Ed­

ward Sorin located in Sorin Hall, but he's not talking either. 
The Sorin statue has been the vjctim of several abductions during the last 30 years. The Rockne statue-snatchers may have been inspired by recent articles in 
Notre Dame Magazine, The Ob­server and theSouth Bend Tribune concerning the colorful history of the Sorin statue, say ad­ministrators. 
Several undergraduates absconded with the Sorin statue in 1952. The students asked friends who were traveling overseas to send postcards signed "Father Sorin" to administrators from such places as Rome, London and Tokyo. 
The Sorin statue was returned at the end of that year, but remained the victim of frequent unaut­horized ,roadtrips for another decade. The statue was stolen again in the early 1960s and not returned until 1972, when Father 1ames Burtchaell learned of the statue's location and demanded its

Thank you, Mom and Dad 
Dear Mom and Dad, 
Four years ago, with teary eyes and heavy hearts, you put me on an airplane bound for Chicago. None of us realized it at the time, but you were sending me on a fantastic journey, one packed with learning, grovvth and happiness. Now that the journey is almost over, it'stime for me to thank you for the wonderful gift you have given me, explain to you why I will always love Notre Dame and tell you why I am better off now than I was then. 
As we walk around campus this weekend, the school's aesthetic qualities will strike you. The Dome shines brightest this time of year, amid blue skies, blooming flowers (even though they were just planted last week), green grass and freshly painted silver sidewalk posts. Believe me, the campus isn't always this beautiful. Midwest winters certainly take their toll. In fact, the campus looks better right now than it does all year. 
Yes, the beauty of our campus is quite apparent. But have

Dame and not benefit. 
Academically, we certainly got our money's worth. I've had the opportunity to study under some of the best teachers in America. I've been challenged time and time again ( lfi my grade point average reflects). I've dis­covered and developed my talents to the point where I am confident of my ability to succeed in the "real world." 
I've learned how to live on my own. Yes, mom, I can 
wash my own clothes, make my own bed and clean my own room. I can even cook my own food, ifI have ~o.

As I have mentioned to or the glory of those who you before, I knew I was operate it. Such cynicism is "home" the first time I set good, however, because it foot on this campus. How? prompts me to constantly Good question. I suppose it question and investigate. had something to do with But perhaps the most im­the anticipation of being a portant thing I have learned part of the greatest student during my four years at body in the world. I had Notre Dame is the value of heard "Notre Dame stories" people. Most accomplish-

when I was still in high 
school. Iwas very anxious to 
become a part ofit all. 
And it didn't take long to become part ofit all. From Dean Hofman's welcoming speech to the last pep rally, from my first dorm party to my last Bookstore Basket­ball tournament, from my first class to my last visit to Senior Bar, I've known the greatness that is Notre Dame. I've had my share in many events and situations which are destined to he remembered in "Notre Dame stories." As many before me have discovered, the great­ness ofthis University lies in the people. 
But what about the people? Why are they so special? Are they special before they arrive, or does something happen to them under the Dome? 
The answer begs the question. People at Notre Dame are special because they are Notre Dame people. That may sound strange, but it is true. 
You have undoubedtly recognized I am a different pen:on now than I was four years ago. I hope you are pleased with my growth and development. I certainly am. I don't think anyone can spend four years at Notre ments are impossible with­

why I can't leave Notre Dame without thanking the loving, caring friends I've made here. They've helped me through difficult times, and let me help them through theirs. I can't wait for you to meet them this weekend. 
And that's also why I can't graduate without thanking you, mom and dad. Without your love and generosity, my four years here would only be a dream. Now they will forever be the fondest ofmy memories. 
I hope you enjoy my graduation and realize I am proud to be your son. Love,

The 1983-84 valedictorians at 
Notre Dame and Saint Mary's may 
have achieved near or perfect 4.0s, 
but neither thinks that he or she has 
missed out on anything as a result. 
"I didn't give up anything on the weekends," said Nicholas Giam­pietro, Notre Dame's valedictorian. "During the week, there wasn't much to do anyway." 
Saint Mary's Gretchen Meyer feels the same way. "I didn't set out to be valedictorian, so I never felt like I was missing anything." 
Meyer, from St. Louis, Mo., will graduate from Saint Mary's with two degrees: a bachelor of science in chemistry, and a bachelor of arts in Humanistic Studies. 
Giampietro, from Glenview, Ill., is enrolled in the College of Business Administration, and will receive his 
B.B.A. with a concentration in accounting. His grade point average after seven semesters was 4.0. 
Both students were active in other areas besides academics 
Valedictorians say they never felt like they were missing anything

Starting salary $17,500 plus medical benefits, travel, and rapid advancement 
during the past four years. Meyer played varsity basketball freshman and sophomore year, and has been an R.A. in Holy Cross for the past two years. She was also active in Campus Ministry and the Alcohol Education Council. 
Giampietro was president of the Notre Dame chapter of Beta Alpha Si, an accounting honors society, and a memb~r ofthe sophomore ad­visory council. He also participated in Dillon Hall government. 
Neither valedictorian has a secret for success to offer. "Being or­ganized was the only thing that helped me,'' said Giampietro. "I just 
Gretchen Meyer 

kept to my schedule and never blew anything offbefore a test." 
Meyer saw earning two degrees as a natural accomplishment. "I came to Saint Mary's as a chemistry major, but didn't want to take only science classes," she said. "I was taking other courses and decided I might as well take the Humanistic Studies major." 
Giampietro had only good things to say about the professors in the College of Business Administration. "My professors were really good at being able to convey everything they knew well," he said. "I couldn't even single out one that was better than the rest." 
As for student life at Notre Dame, Giampietro feels students lack of a cause to fight for is a real problem. "Students today have trouble trying to make a stand. No one is striving for anything in particular. There is no real goal." 
"In real life, people are divided in­to many little factions," he con-
Nicholas Giampietro 
tinued. "Notre Dame doesn't have as many little groups because everyone is so similar." 
After graduation this weekend, Giampietro will go on to Harvard Law School, and Meyer will attend medical school at Saint Louis Univer­sity. 

Spirituality Center confronting hard times 
By TIMOTHY GIANOTTI 
SentorStaffReporter 
Saint Mary's new Center for Spirituality is off to a slow start, but progress will soon pick up pace, says Religious Studies Department Chairman Keith Egan_ 
The initial plans for the center were passed weeks ago by Saint Mary's Board of Trustees, but as of yet Egan has not been able to cross paths with President Duggan to dis­cuss the next step. 
Egan, also a professor at Notre Dame, has been on the road giving lectures on spirituality, and Duggan has only recently returned from an overseas trip. 
Egan insists they will meet soon, 
however, and planning will take 
great strides over the summer. 
The new Center for Spirtuality is a response to"the searching ofpeople for the inner life," says Egan. 
Egan sees the new project as an aid for both the Saint Mary's and Notre Dame communities, helping individuals form active lives built upon the foundation of this "inner life."

.. 
The center also has another task in mind, says Egan: the development of the women's movement in the Church. 
"We want to prepare women for future roles of leadership in the Church," he says.

S7,000 operating deficit for the 1982-83 year. The general board of the paper refused to turn over the funds because, as David Dziedzic, editor-in-chief said, "Whoever controls the money controls the business."

An Tostal Investigation 
The topic of spring was on everybody's mind in the middle of winter this year but not necessarily the topk of spring break An Tostal, the annual spring student celebration, ran into a snag after it was discovered that la..<>t year's managing committee could not account for almost $4,000. Some of the committee members at­tributed the overspending to the lack ofcontrol, waste­fulness and poor planning. One member questioned whether all of the money was spent directly for An Tos­
tal. 

Alumnus Ineligible For Award 
Harold Augustine. an alumnus who became a campus celebrity bv being quoted in The Obsen,er as saying, "A wet campus is a happy campus," was declared ineligible for the Senior Fellow Award by the four-member stu­dent award committee. The senior cla..<>s failed to cast enough votes for any ofthe other candidates and conse­quently did not elect a Fellow this year. Augustine was elected Senior Buddy, an award quickly organized after he was not allowed to receive the Fellow award.

Many hungry students didn't know where their next pizza was coming from when the Office of Student Af­fairs shut down the residence hall foodsales after several were found to be unsanitary by the Campus En­viromental Health and Safety Department.

Yale Recipes Questioned 
A recipe file bought from Yale University for $20,000 was criticized by some dining hall cooks because they claimed some recipes didn't work and were a waste of the University's money. Food -Services Director Bill Hickey defended the purchase saying it was the best recipe system in the country. Other schools who purchased the same file claimed they also had problems with it. 


New Final Exam Policy Set 
Final exams became even more ofa headache for stu­dents when the Academic Council changed the final ex­ams policy prohibiting exemptions for graduating seniors. Exams must be weighted between one-fifth and one-half of the semester grade according to the new policy. Another amendment passed by the council states that two-hour final exams are mandatory unless an exception is approved by the chairman ofthe depart­ment and reviewed by the dean.

Campus gay community seeks acceptance 

Has Our Response met nuclear war challenge? 
National surveys estimate that five to 1 0 percent of the U.S. population is homosexual. At Notre Dame and Saint Mary's, approximate­ly two to three percent of all professors and students are gay, say members of the homosexual community here. 
Because of University and College policies, there is no recognized gay student organiza-

tion on either campus say members of the group, who requested anonymity. 
Members speculate at least 200 students and professors at the two schools are practic­ing homosexuals. 
"Though we are not all friends," says one person. ··many ofus know each other casually and communicate through the grapevine." 
In the past, members say, they have con­ducted open meetings which often attracted 20 or more people. 
The greatest problem facing gay students, according to members, is homophobia, or fear of homosexuals. This fear often manifests it­self in harassment. "People often move away from us when we sit down at movies, yell epit­hets across the quad, or occassionally give us obscene phone calls," one reports. 
Another adds, "We used to eat together in the dining hall, but the harassment became unbearable." 
Another gay says many people who were ordinarily his friends "don't say hello when they see me with a gay friend." 
One ofthe most severe cases ofharassment happened several years ago·to two allegedly

As a prominent Catholi<.· univer­sit)·. Notre Dame has a ~pecial resJXmsibility to provide Christian leadership in confronting the many moral quagmires presented by nuclear weapons and the threat of nuclear war. 
Education is essential. In this area. Notre Dame has established the "Nuclear Dilemma" course and has created peace studies as a second major. 
Beyond education, the bishops' lc:tter is a call toaction for Catholics. It is not enough to publicly denounce nuclear war with words. 
We are called to integrate our rejec­
tion ofnuclear conflict into our pcr­
sonallives and our community. 
We must take concrete actions 
that express our beliefs -acts of 
Christian witness. 
It is within this context that the 
issue of Notre Dame endowment 
holdings in nuclear defense contrac­
tors must be viewed. How and 
where Notre Dame invests its $250 
million dollars is a statement of Uni· 
versity priorities and values. 
Notre Dame recognizes this, as 
evidenced by the investment 
guidelines established in 1979 to 
limit holdings in U.S. firms doing 
business in the Union of South 
Africa. Five years ago trustees agreed 
to abide by the Sullivan Principles, 
which discourage investment in that 
racist-run nation. The trustees' deci· 
sion was a clear rejection of apart­
heid on moral grounds. 
The question of University investments in nuclear defense in­dustries also calls us to assume our resJXmsibilities as Catholics, to re­examine our priorities. The effect of adopting guidelines limiting such in­vestments would not stop the arms race or improve United States-Soviet relations. 
Such an adoption would, however, be a symbolic expression and statement of our collective moral commitment to creating a safer world for our grandchildren. 
We: would bt: recognizing the simple facts that the nuclear threat to mankind transcends the Soviet or "communist'" threat to the sovereignty of the United States, and that in this age of nuclear overkill, more missiles no longer buy more securitv. 
To not adopt a set ofguidelines is to give tacit support and approval to the continued escalation ofthe arms race, including the development of those weapon systems that our bis· hops have so strongly condemned as dangerous and destabilizing. 
Last fall, "Students for Responsible 

lesbian women at Notre Dame, according to 
one gay. 

After applying to switch dormitories as 
juniors, the two women were informed by 
their respective rectresses that senior year 
dormitory changes were not only unusual and 
detrimental to dormitory spirit but also re­
quired parental permission. 

The housing office later told the two women that parental permission was not re­quired and transfers were available to those who had not been discipline problems. Neit­her of the women were discipline problems, according to one gay. 
Later that semester, the women ex­perienced what they believed to be foot­dragging on the part of the rectresses. According to another gay, the two w.omen believed that the rectresses hoped such a delay would pressure the alleged lesbians to move off-campus. 
At the same time they were applying for the dormitory transfer, the women received severe harassment from other students, including damage to their possessions and even murder and rape threats. 
The women, say members of the gay com­munity, believed the harassment was due to indiscretion on the part of the rectresses who may have accused the women of being les­bians to other women in the dormitories. 
The two also believed that, after receiving death threats from other students, they could not tum to security or to the administration for help because they feared only more harass­ment from the University. 
Harassment is not always so severe, however, said one homosexual. "I just live with it. It doesn't really bother me," he says, adding that harrassment "keeps the gay com­munity apart (from heterosexual students). 
University Investments" was formed to examine the feasability of es­tablishing guidelines for University divestment ofindustries which con­tribute to the nuclear arms race. 
Early definitional problems (that is, what constitutes a nuclear weapon) were overcome with the help ofthe Investors' Responsibility Research Council The policy calls for divestment ofthose firms reciev­ing more than 1 0 percent of total profit from the sale of primary nuclear weapons systems (including warhead and delivery system com-

Lesbians run into less harassment than gay 
men, members reported, because "they tend 
to be low-key," and are usually secretive at 
both schools. Lesbianism is also less threaten­
ing, especially to the male-dominated en­
vironment at Notre Dame, and less likely to 
arouse harassment, members agree. 
Notre Dame and Saint Mary's gays, accord­ing to one member, consider the negative reactions they receive from other students "indicative of the xenophobia and homogeneity prevalent at Notre Dame. People here just don't like things that are dif­ferent." 
Members add that students from foreign countries and those who have studied abroad tend to be more accepting." 
Gays also attribute homophobia at the two schools to students' Catholic backgrounds and insecurities about their own sexuality. 
"Catholics start (to be sexually active) late, and many students here are unsure of them­selves," says one gay. He adds that a heterosexual without "'a sureness of one's own sexuality" usually has difficulties as­sociating with homosexuals. That sureness about personal sexuality is lacking in many students, members agree. 
Gays also consider traditional Gltholic doctrine to be at the root of either school's unwillingness to recognize a gay student group on campus. 
Dean of Students james Roemer confirms this, saying that recognition would be misun­derstood by the press and "blown out of proportion." 
Roemer adds, "Many people would under­stand it to be an approval ofhomosexuality." Gays here, however, are keeping an eye on 

ponents and some supportsystems). 
This proposal, approved by the Student Senate in February, covers only six corporations: Boeing, Lockeed, General Dynamics, Rock­well, E.G. & G. and Martin Marietta 
It appears that of those six, the University only has holdings in Boeing(which is developing the MX and cruise missiles). Divestment of Boeing would only be of symbolic significance, but such a move would be an important statement about Notre Dame's commitment to world peace. 
continuing efforts by homosexuals to estab­
': 

lish an official gay student/faculty group at jesuit-run Georgetown University. 
The group, which had sued Georgetown on 

the grounds they were being discriminated 
against, lost their suit last fall when a District 
of Columbia judge ruled in Georgetown's 
favor. The ruling, however, is being appealed. 
Members here also say "it was rumored that a group ofgay Notre Dame alumni in Chicago would help us out" in forming such an or­ganization on campus. 
According to one memberofthe Gay Rights Alumni ofNotre Dame {GRAND), their group consistently has been denied official recogni­tion by the University's alumni association "because we are not a geographical club." 
Pointing to gay student groups on other schools such as Harvard and Yale, members say, "they have gay dances and they pack the place." 
In the 1970s and early 1980s, gays at Notre Dame maintained a post office box and a hot line for their informal organization. Members later ran into what they term "typical or­ganizational problems," and the two services were discontinued. 
Members emphasize that "we don't want to sound bitter. We're not. We are an accepting group ofpeople." 
One adds, "Most people on campus don't give us a chance because they don't want to know anyone gay. Chances are you know somebody who is homosexual. But you don't know it, and it doesn't really matter." 
Discounting their sexual preference, mem­bers say, they are just like anyone else. 
"I'm one-29th gay," says one member. "There's a lot more to me than just my sexual preference. I have political and religious beliefs and a lot of other interests. What dif­ference does it make to other people if I'm gay?" 
Last week, the policy was presented to the Student Affairs Committee ofthe University's Board of Trustees, where it was recieved favorably. But at the full board meeting, strong opposition from members of the Investment Com· mittee effectively killed attempts to have the guidelines implemented. 
Unfortunately, it appears that Notre Dame, for the time being, is unwilling to put its money where its mouth and heart are. The issue has been addressed -yet the inconsis­tencies remain.

Letting go most difficult Letter to a maiden aunt

A timid young man who saw his first Notre Dame commencement four years ago as a soon-to-be freshman, will graduate Sunday, carrying with him the best and the worst of Notre Dame. 
The four years were a comedy of errors, filled with what he thought wrong turns, in­decision and unrealized dreams. 
His freshman and sophomore years found him in Old College and Moreau Seminary ­first with a roommate, then alone. As a junior he searched a vast desert to find himself ­from the harsh reality of off-campus life, to living with the best 48-hour friends he's ever known, to campus life with two roommates he

despised before learning to overlook his own 
pettiness, to life with his roommate from 
freshman year who also had left the seminary. 
He also chose to major in philosophy and 
computer applications early that year. After 
failing in his try to become a resident assistant, 
he reluctantly took a job with the campus 
newspaper -a job he really did not want at 
the time. On his first day of work, he came 
within inches oftelling his boss he dido't want 
the job. 
As luck would have it, he now finds himself 
looking for work in journalism with an educa­tion which trained his mind admirably, but which tails to impress would-be employers.· 
As a senior, he was so wrapped up in himself and in school's rigors, he often ignored his roommate, his friends from years past, and worst of all, his family who had struggled for 22 years to teach him to live life to its fullest and to stand up for what he believed in. 
But despite all his shortcomings, he will leave Notre Dame next Monday as a young man who has learned how to love. Only now that he is about to leave friends, some of whom he has known four years, does he begin to appreciate the feelings his parents must have had four years ago when they kissed him goodbye. 
Notre Dame at times caused him to despair. 
At times he attacked administrators ofthe l.hi­
versity who claimed to fill in for Mom and Dad 
with an in locoperentis attitude. 
He disregarded their attitudes and policies 
in the same way he had set aside his parents' 
advice and their years ofsacrifice. 
As he was about to graduate, he got a letter ·from Father Ted, one which the president had mailed to every senior on campus to defend 
himself He spoke of "Sarge," not Sergeant Shriver and went out of his way to defend Loret Ruppe, a woman who deserves an honorary degree or the senior fellow award, but not to speak at commencement. 
A letter accompanying Hesburgh's send-off attacked the student newspaper for its hasty column denouncing Ruppe -and hasty it was,. only because the University would not let anyone know who was speaking until the newspaper scooped the story for the third year in a row. 
You see, the University does not respect 
protest and independence. The school wants 
to hang on to its children -even searching 
them as they enter the convocation center for 
commencement ceremonies with one last 
shot of mistrust. 
His parents were able to let go even though it hurt at times, waiting for his next letter, phone call or visit. Because ofthem, he left school a confident and mature man. His only advice is to appreciate parents and ap­preciate the place. 
Autbor'snote:Infouryears atNotre Dame, I have received more tban 150 letters from AuntMadeleine, my mother's maiden sister. Tbe letters, wbtcb came in 9 by 12 manila envelopes, were typed single-spaced and covered tbe back andfront ofonepage.

. 
Because ofour like lifestyles, I doubt ifever there were a time you did not understand me. 

As a child, I groped for my identity. And you, my wry godmother, were always able to put into my head dreams ofsuccess which as a young adult I now hope to fulfill. 
In early adolescence, I was what my parents termed "rebellious," but I was no rebel I was simply a ridiculously selfish teenager in love with myself You, ever the champion strategist, brought my parents and me iogeth­er by turning me from within myself. 
As an older teenager, I began to lose self­confidence. You, along with my parents, taught me to trust my abilities. Whether I was ' discussing persOnal experiences with you, or just mowing your lawn, you gave me the chance to recognize my worth as an in­

dividual who could accept challenges and ac­
complish most any task I began. 
Though my parents and I have lived next door to you since 1968, it was not until I came to Notre Dame that I finally realized how much of one mind we really were. Through your letters I was able to grasp more intensely our two loves: justice and New Ocleans. 
For more than 40 years you have served as a legal secretary and now embark on a· new course as a paralegal. In dedicating yourselfto service and justice, you have opened my eyes to see the plight ofthe weak and indigent. 
By your example and through your tireless encouragement, I hope to approach your living spirit of noblesse oblige through my own work as a newspaperman. 
Our love for the Crescent City binds us to a lifestyle I have yet to experience anywhere else in my travels. And though at times I criticize the city's social institutions, always remember that I hold its people more dearly than any other. 
While most of my Notre Dame friends someday plan to return to their homes to be close to family and friends, I hope to return to New Orleans not only because ofthose I hold dearly, but also because of the very persons I claim I detest. Truly, New Orleans makes for odd bedfellows, and you have taught nie to revel in such paradoxes. 
As I leave Notre Dame, I hope to leave with those who remain here some semblance of the hope in humanity and respect for in­dividuals you instilled within me. 
Love,

The 1983-84 women's basketball season was r.tther disappointing, as the team finished with a 14-14 record. However, there wasone very bright spot, and that came on December 5when the Irish defeated perennial power UClA. Carrie Bates was the star as she carhe off the bench to score 18 points and pull down six rebounds before leaving 
with a knee injury. Mary Beth Schueth made up for her absence down the stretch, and the Irish picked up their biggest win ever, 70-61.

Maryland Fallsto Irish 
With 20 seconds remaining, the score read: Maryland 45, Notre Dame 45. However, Irish cap­tain Tom Slubydrove to the basket for a layup that gave Notre Dame its biggest win in three years. Maryland came into the game ranked fifth nation­ally, but the Irish, in the midst ofa streak that saw them win 12 of 14, played excellent basketball down the stretch to give them their first notable victory of the '83-'84 season. Sluby, as usual, led the scoring with 19 points, while Ken Barlow added 16 in the winning effort. 

Sports 
Volleyball PrognulUpgraded 

W'hen it was reported that the athletic depart­ment was upgrading the volleyball program by hiring former Stanford coach Art Lambert and increasing the number of scholarships to the NC'..AA maximtun of 12, there was probably little reaction from those outside the department. However, the announcement was very important for the fate of Notre Dame's minor sports, and especially the women's sports. Ifany minor sport is going to make waves, volleyball is going to have to be it. Ifit fails, the other minor sports may also suffer. 

FencersUpsetNational<bamps 
What's Notre Dame's most successful sports program? Mike DeCicco's fencing program wins by a mile. Once again, the fencers made their an­nual run at the national championship. They fell just short again this year, finishing third in the NCAA Tournament, but made a big mark during the season by defeating eventual national cham­pion Wa}ne State in the Great lakes Champion­ship. The win could be an omen for the next few years, as nearly every fencerwill return next year.

Irish tennis team places Sluby third in NCAA tourney :::::;~:::;::.ll,hreebe· 
By LARRY BURKE 
Sports Writer 
Continued improvement has 
been the trademark of the Notre 
Dame women's tennis team in the 
course of its seven-year history, and 
the 1983-84 season was certainly no 
exception to that trend. 
For the second year in a row, the 
women's team placed third in the 
NCAA Division II national cham­
pionship tournament. But even 
though they failed to achieve their 
goal of a national championship, the 
Irish continued to build confidence as they posted their best record ever, fmishing 23-4 overall (.852). They posted a 13-4 mark in the spring campaign. 
"This is the best team I've ever coached," said Irish coach Sharon Petro. "The players displayed a supe­rior attitude, one of hard work and determination. We made a marked improvement over last season, a we had a lot offun doing it. 
"As far as the tournament goes, I have nothing but the highest praise for my players. A lot of things were against us, but through it all, we played well. It just wasn't enough." 
One factor that worked against Notre Dame in the tournament was the weather. Heavy rain caused several matches to be delayed or moved indoors. When it wasn't raining, the weather was extremely hot and humid, something that the

Need Help With Your Student Loan? 
If you've attended college on a Guaranteed Student Loan or a National Direct Student Loan made after Oc­tober 1, 1975, consider spending a couple of years in the Army. 
If you train for certain specialties, the government will release you from 1/3 of your indebtedness (or $1,500, whichever is greater) for each year of active duty.

to. 
The quality ofcompetition also in­
creased the pressure on Notre 
Dame. Because they were seeded 
third in the tournament, they had a 
difficult road to the championship, 
facing top-seeded Tennessee­
Chattanooga in the second round. 
The fact that the tournament finals 
were held in Chattanooga didn't 
make things any easier. 
The Irish defeated Denver 8-1 in 
the first round ofthe tournament on 
Monday, May 7, but then fell to even­
tual national champion Tennessee­
undoubtedly a contributing factor in 
Notre Dame's defeat, because the 
two matches were played back-to­
back. The Irish opened play with 
Denver at 9 am. and didn't finish the 
Tennessee-Chattanooga match until 
lOp.m. 
The pressure of final exams was another problem for Petro's squad. This was most evident in Tuesday's third round, where Notre Dame defeated California-Davis 5-4 to capture third place. After taking a 5­1 lead, the Irish opted to forfeit the last three games in order to catch the last plane out of Tennessee and be back at school for Wednesday's exams. 
Next year figures to be another strong season for the Irish, as most of this year's players will be returning.

cause his main asset is his strength." 
Sluby will likely play at the big guard in the pros, but the transition from college to the pros will t be a dif­ficult one. The consensus among Blakt>., Menendez and Suhr is that the adjustment will likely take Sluby one to two years to make. The three also seem to agree that the Irish star needs to work on his ball handling and defense to be successful in the pros. 
There are other jntangibles that 
seem to make Sluby attractive to the 
pro people. 

"We think he's a guy who wants to take the money shots," says Suhr. "He's been in plenty ofhigh pressure situations at Notre Dame, has a very good knowledge of the game, and is really a competitor. All in all, he's a winner." 
After Sunday's graduation ceremonies, the next stop for Sluby is a pre-draft camp to be held May 30, June 1-3 in Chicago. According to Blake, only the top 50 or so col­lege players have been invited to this camp and it will be an excellent chance for Sluby to show his stuff to

the plethora of NBA brass who will be present. 
As far as what's in store for Sluby next year in the NBA, Gillen offers this assessment. 
"The key for him is getting with a team that needs a second guard," he says. "With the right team, I think he could do real well. He deserves it, too, because he's worked hard and is really a good kid." 
Sluby's hard work is not over, though. After four tough years at Notre Dame, he now faces the chal­lenge ofsurviving in the NBA-per­haps the biggest challenge ofall.

Two seniors bring up-and-down careers to close 
Tom Sluby: 1984 Athlete ofYear 
ByJEFF BLUMB 
AssistantSports Editor 
He probably will not be remembered much, ifat all, for his ftrst three years at Notre Dame. But Tom Sluby and his senior season will certainly stick out in the minds of many for years to come. 
The senior captain took charge of a strug­gling young team and not only turned its season around, but led it to a 21-1 2 record and a second place ftnish in the National Invitation Tournament. In the process, the winner ofthe fourth Edward 'Moose' Krause Award, selected annually by the sports staffofTbe Ob­seroer to recognize the Notre Dame Male Ath­lete of the Year, averaged 18.7 points per game, the best by an Irish player since Adrian Dantley's 28.6 in '75-'76. 
After struggling through a semester of academic ineligibility and assorted other set­backs, Sluby started to come on near the end ofhis junioryear. Then, following a successful trip to Yugoslavia between his junior and senior years, Sluby received the honor of being named captain. 
'Now Sluby, one year ago a long shot to ever play in the National Basketball Association, has a fairly good chance of achieving that honor also. Those who know in the NBA, in fact, are predictingSluby to go anywhere from the second round to the middle ofthe third in next month's draft. 
"He's deftnitely among the top 40 or 50 players in the country," says top NBA scout Marty Blake of Sluby. "He has a very good chanct> to play in the NBA."

"I would say that he'll go from anywhere in the second round to perhaps somewhere in the middle of the third round," estimates AI Menendez, director of player personnel for the New Jersey Nets. "He'll deftnitely get a shot to show what he can do." 
"While I don't think that he's a first round selection," comments Brendan Suhr, an assis­tant coach with the Atlanta Hawks, "everyone knows who he is. He's had good exposure at Notre Dame and has as good a chance as anyone of making it once he gets to camp." 
Much of Sluby's exposure came in Notre Dame's mid-season upset of then fifth-ranked Maryland when he drove the right side with 18 seconds left to register a decisive three­point-play, and in the trek of the Irish to New York's Madison Square Garden in the NIT, where the Washington, D.C., native averaged 
20.4 points in five games. 

Post-season accolades included honorable mentions on the all-America teams ofTbe As­sociated Press, Basketball Weekly, and The Sporting News. In addition, Sluby received three awards at the team's annual awards ban­quet -the Notre Dame Monogram Club MVP Award, the Outch Player of the Year Award, and the Captain's Award. 
In achieving those distinctions last season, Sluby scored 616 poims to rank him I I th on the all-time single-season list. Beyond that, his 252 field goals are the 1Oth best ever in one season for a Notre Dame player. He scored a career-high 30 points against both Marquette and Dayton and led the Irish in scoring in 26 of 33games. 
"He exceeded our expectations," says Irish assistant coach Pete Gillen of the turnaround between Sluby's junior and senior years. "The · adjustment for him wasn't so much a physical one as a mental one. 
"It was all in believing that he could do it. · And as his confidence built, it kind of steam­rolled." 
Although Sluby is certainly a good shooter (he shot slightly over 50 percent last season), it seems that he is liked more by the pro people for something else. 
"Besides shooting the basketball real well, he's really a strung kid," assesses Blake. "And he's quicker than most people think." 
"There's three things you need to play in our league," says Menendez, "and those are: you must have strength, you must be physical and you must be able to take the pounding of

Sports Editor 
Uke nearly all the athletes who entered 
Notre Dame with the Class of 1984, Jenny 
Klauke has finished her four-year stint and will 
graduate on Sunday. 
Unlike the other athletes, though, Jenny 
Klauke has earned a place in Notre Dame ath­
letic history that will never be taken away. She 
did not earn the spot because of some fantas­
tic athletic achievement, though. Her career 
at Notre Dame was marred by injuries that 
kept her from making a major ~k on the 
record books. 
Jenny Klauke will go down in history as the 
first woman to receive an athletic grant-in-aid 
to attend Notre Dame. When she signed a 
letter-of-intent to join Mary DiStanislao's new 
women's basketball program, Klauke not only 
joined the ground floor ofa building program 
-in fact she was the ground floor -but she 
also represented the beginning of Notre 
Dame's attempt to build a strong women's 
sports program. 
The jury is still out on whether the athletic 
department's attempt has brought the results 
that were expected, but, after four years, it is 
obvious that jenny Klauke's career was not 
quite as productive as she had hoped. 
"These last four years have been kind of 
frustrating years for me," says the Glenview, 
Ill., native. "With injuries and everything, I 
never really felt I showed what I could do. 
"I knew that they would probably be bring­
ing in a lot of recruits after me. I also knew 
most people expected me to get pushed into 
the background. But 1wanted to play a lot for 
four years and go out with a bang." 
Things did not work out as planned for 
Klauke, but her Notre Dame career was still 
no flop. In essence, she was the sprinter who 
ran the ftrst leg of a relay, only to pass the 
baton to taster teammates. 
What a difference a few years makes. When K.lauke appeared on the scene as a freshman, the Notre Dame women's basketball program was beginning its ftrst year in Division I after jumping from Division III. DiStanislao had signed two recruits to begin the program's 
climb up the Division I ladder, but nobody knew what to expect from the year. 
The outlook was even cloudier when one recruit, Mary Joan Forbes, injured her knee before the season started, an injury that ef­fectively ended her Notre Dame career before it started. The injury left Klauke alone to carry 

the weight of being the sole scholarship 
player on the team. 
"I didn't know what to expect fromjenny in that first year," says DiStanislao. "In fact, didn't know what to expect from the team going from Division III to Division I. Obvious­ly we had oureyes on the future, but we didn't know how many people from that team would be part ofthe future. 
"As far as Jenny was concerned, she had in­juries through her ftrst year, as well as the rest ofher career. As the health ofher feet and legs was inconsistent, so was her play." 
Despite the injuries, though, Klauke showed flashes ofbrilliance from time to time. She averaged more than 10 points a game while playing little more than half the game, and scored 27 points in one half against Ball State. She did this despite trying to learn the new position ofguard and frequently trying to do more than she was capable. 
"C~ach used to yell at me about about trying to do too much," smiles K.lauke. "I was a guard then, and while I was trying to learn how to bring the ball up and play guard, I was going back to my old habits of forward. I did learn to control myself, though." 
By the end ofher first season, K.lauke looked like she would be playing a major role in Notre Dame's future -f she could avoid in­juries. Despite the fact that DiStanislao had brought in five blue-chip recruits, K.lauke's ability to play guard or forward would serve her well. 
A stress fracture ofher leg in the preseason ruined her plans again, however. She missed
