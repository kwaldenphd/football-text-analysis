Pleas for peace arise in drug war 

with drug traffickers; who are blamed for the assassination August 18 of Sen. Luis Carlos Galan, a leading presidential candidate. The slaying prompted an unprecedented crackdown on drug trafficking. 
Colombia's police intelligence chief said Tuesday that Abraham Majuat, identified as a top financial man for drug dealers, was implicated in Galan's death. Gen. Manuel Maza Marquez would not elaborate, and no charges were filed against Majuat, who was arrested Monday at a ranch near Medellin. Authorities also seized 4 1/2 tons of cocaine there. 
Bombs blew up at six state liquor stores Tuesday in Medellin. The shops are a

BOGOTA, Colombia--The father of three reputed drug barons appealed for the government to end its fierce war on drugs and negotiate a peace, but six more bombs exploded Tuesday in the cocaine trafficking center of Medellin. 
"Let there be dialogue, let there be peace. Let's have forgiveness, let's carry out a kind of erasing and (start with 
a) clean slate," Fabio Ochoa Restrepo said in an open letter to President Virgilio Barco. The letter was published Tuesday in a Bogota newspaper.

INDIANAPOLIS--Indiana Bell Telephone Co. and the union representing 4,200 striking workers announced a tentative agreement on a new, three-year contract Tuesday evening. 
The contract includes basic wage increases, improved pensions, new family care features and profit sharing, a spokesman for the company said. 
Frederic Hunn, vice president 
of  human  resources  and  
corporate  development  for  
Indiana  Bell,  called  the  

agreement fair, progressive and innovative. 
"This agreement addresses the needs of our individual employees and helps position the company to compete vigorously over the next several years," he said. 
The agreement also includes a training program to address the career needs of individual employees, Hunn said, adding that further details of the agreement would be released after the company and union have had a chance to share the information with employees. 
Indiana Bell, which became the fourth of the five Ameritech telephone systems that went on strike Aug. 13, to reach victim called him. "The individual felt it wasn't right for federal people to be taking money to fix cases. There are some good, honest people out there and this proves it," McCory said. 

McCory said the defendants told the victim they needed $2,000 to pay off the U.S. Attorney's office. The father paid $1,500 to the defendants Friday night while police watched, McCory said. 
Hoehner and McCory said neither defendant has any connection with federal drug investigators. 
McCory said investigations by federal, county and local police indicate the defendants victimized at least two other families in Merrillville and Gary and tried to extort $2,500 in one case. 
"We are certain there are others," McCory said.

agreement with the CWA. Michigan Bell is the only Ameritech subsidary without a tentative contract and CWA of­ficials said all 3 7,000 union employees would remain off the job until a settlement is reached in all five states. 
Michigan Bell and bargainers for its 12,800 striking telephone workers were holding informal talks Tuesday, spokespersons for the utility and CWA said. 
"We will continue operating with management and supervisory personnel until our regular employees return and we anticipate that will be soon," said Estel Gibson, media information manager for Indiana Bell. 
The agreement came hours after Bell officials announced that talks had been suspended while the union prepared its response to the company's latest contract proposal. 
Both sides had talked until late Sunday night and were quoted as saying a settlement appeared near. But, on Monday, Indiana Bell claimed the union called their chief negotiator with heightened demands that took negotiations in a new direction. 
Meanwhile, Indiana Bell managers are struggling to keep up with a high volume of telephone trouble calls due to heavy rains during the past week. 
Bell was planning to recruit retired managers with installation and maintenance experience to supplement the management force doing repair work now, Gibson said. 
More than 400 managers worked both Saturday and Sunday to clear more than 3,400 cases of telephone trouble before Monday morning, Gibson said. 
"In order to not get hopelessly behind on repair volume, we feel the need to take some steps to take care of the problem," he said. 
"It looked on Monday and over the weekend like sometime this week we'd have our regular folks on the job, but now we're not so sure," he said. 
Illinois Bell agreed to a tentative contract with strikers Monday, following tentative settlements during the weekend at Ameritech's systems in Ohio and Wisconsin. 
Strikes began Aug. 6 ~t three other "Baby Bell" regional telephone companies formed after the 1984 breakup of AT&T. Nationally, the strikes affected 200,000 workers in 20 states.

An Israeli reserve officer linked to fighter training 
programs for hirelings of Colombian drug lords was_ warl?e~. by Israeli government officials six mont~s ago to stop his acti_vitles, Israeli radio said Tuesday. The Miami Herald and the Washmgton Post, quoting a confidential report by Colombi~n. security forc~s, reported that at least five _Israeli and 11_ British_ mercenaries helped train teams of assassms fo~ Col?mb1~n cocame tr~fficke_rs and their right-wing allies.

Police in­vestigators questioned two more reserve officers 1~ the _c~se Tuesday and said others with possible links to Colombian trammg would be called. 
The Security Council of the United Nations unani­mously adopted a resolution Tuesday criticizing South Africa for failing to fully cooperate with U.N. monitors overseeing the world body's independence plan for Namibia. South Africa insists it is complying with the one-year U.N. plan to end its 74-year rule of Namibia. The resolution demand the complete disbandment of a notorious paramilitary police unit called Koevoet and demand all parties comply strictly with the U.N. plan, "especially South Africa." Tuesday's vote follows two weeks of speeches by about 40 nations complaining South Africa is trying to rig the November election against the South-West African People's Organization, the guerrilla-backed movement favored to form an independent gov­ernment. 
Declaring that Bulgaria's Turkish minority was trapped in a "tragic situation" of human rights violations, the Bush ad­ministration announced Tuesday it had recalled the American ambassador to the East European country and joined NATO allies in condemning Bulgaria. A strong statement issued at the State Department followed what a U.S. official said was a recent wors­ening of the situation and an inability by Turkey to absorb many more than the 311,000 ethnic Turks who have taken refuge in the country. About 1 million people of Turkish extraction live in Bulgaria where, according to the State Departm_ent, they are sys­tematically denied the right to speak the Turkish language and practice Turkish culture. 
NATIONAL BRIEFS 

Voters streamed to the polls to fill the late Claud Pepper's Congressional seat from Miami in an ethnically divisive race be­tween a Brooklyn-born Democrat and a Republican hoping to be­come the first Cuban-American elected to Congress. Democrat Gerald Richman, in his· first run for elective office, faced GOP State Sen. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen in the election made necessary by Pepper's death May 30. Pepper, a Democrat, had held ~he seat since its inception 27 years ago. With seven of 146 precmcts re­porting, Richman had 761 votes, or 53.9 percent, to 650 votes, or 
46.0 percent, for Ros-Lehtinen. Pepper's seat is one of five open­ings in the U.S. House. The others were caused by the resigna­tions of former-Speaker Jim Wright, D-Tex., and former­Democratic Whip Tony Coelho, D-Calif., and the deaths of Mickey Leland, D-Tex., and Larkin Smith, R-Miss., in plane crashes. 
American Airlines will add two new commuter flights from its Nashville hub --to South Bend, Ind., and Montgomery, Ala. -­with the addition of two airplanes to its American Eagle fleet, the company announced Tuesday. The flights are scheduled to begin by week's end. 
Despite the scandal enveloping the generic drug in­dustry, consumer advocates and physicians on Tuesday reaf­firmed their confidence in lower-priced clones of brand-name medicines. "At the present time, there's no evidence that any generic drugs out there in the pharmacies lack safety or effective­ness," said Dr. Sidney Wolfe, a physician and head of the Public Citizen Heath Research Group. Although disclosures of fraud and corruption in the Food and Drug Administration's generic drug division have tainted the agency's reputation and cast doubts about the industry, many say concerns about the safety of generic drugs are overblown. 
INDIANA BRIEFS 

A charge of attempted rape against an Anderson man was dropped Tuesday after his attorney motioned for a physical exam­ination to determine the sex of the victim. Jeffery Bernard Jones, 29, has been held in the Madison County jail on $100,000 bond on multiple charges. Jones questioned the gender of the alleged vic­tim after reportedly being told the alleged victim wasn't a woman. Defense attorney John Walsh claimed the law requires an attack be made against a member of the opposite sex for a rape to take place and asked that court proceedings against Jones be delayed until a physical examination is completed on the alleged victim. The Bureau of Motor Vehicles indicated the person involved had an M on a driver's licence before 1985 in Ohio, indicating a male, but an F on the new license, indicating a female. "We dismissed the attempted rape charge because we did not want the victim to have to submit to a physical examination, " the county prosecutor said.

Nostalgia craze could become ugly 

This summer marked the return of many of the most successful rock stars of the past 25 years. Ringo Starr and his all-Starr band band are touring, as well as such mega-groups as The Who and the Rolling Stones. The Bee Gees are on the road again, (Hell must have frozen over) bringing back the days of pulsating dance floors and mirror-covered disco glitter balls suspended from the ceiling. Even Donny Osmond is back in the Top 40, turning in his squeaky clean image in order to become a "Soldier of Love." 
Why are there so many comebacks? I've fi­nally decided that it must be the nostalgia craze that is sweeping the nation. It seems as if every commercial jingle has been lifted from Billboards Top 20 of 1968, and a lot of TV shows and movies are geared towards the baby boomers who blossomed during the age of flower power and free love. 
Since we are a nation in love with our past, it only seems logical that '60s nostalgia of the '80s will turn into the '70s nostalgia of the '90s. Consider the possibilities--if The Who and the Stones are touring now, just think about what groups could be coming to a stadium near you in the next five to ten years: 
BAY CITY ROLLERS: Remember S-A-T -U-R­D-A-Y NIGHT? These lovely lads were one of the '70s biggest flashes in the pan. Their eight­track cassettes may be the stuff garage sales are made of, but they are sure to be collector's items once the band regains its long-lost popu­larity. 
THE CASSIDY BROTHERS: David ("The Partridge Family") and Shaun ("The Hardy Boys") might pair up for a reunion tour. Having read my fair share of "Hardy Boys" books as a kid, I never came across any pas­sages in which Joe Hardy had to wear a white polyester leisure suit and sing "Da Doo Ron Ron" in order to catch a diamond thief, but I admire the artistic license the producers of the show exercised. Maybe red-haired Danny Partridge could play the guitar for the Cassidy

JUHN UhNVhH: I believe John"s last public 
appearance was on "A Muppets' Christmas" a few years ago, so he'd probably be more than happy to accept any offer to be on the road 
again as opposed to talking to some guy's hand with a frog puppet attached to it. He just might bring the house down singing "Thank God I'm a Country Boy." 
VILLAGE PEOPLE: I saved the best for last. My own Village People album was lost, tragi­cally, in a flood a couple of years ago along with my Shaun Cassidy album. None of the Village People albums are out on CD (to my shock) but a reunion tour could spark a renewed interest in the group and have a new generation of pre­teens bopping to "Macho Man," "YMCA" and "In the Navy." 
I really don't mind the fact that there are so many comeback concerts this year; I got tickets. for the Paul McCartney concert myself. But I hope that the aging baby boomers aren't disap­pointed when they find out that no one--rock stars included--can remain frozen in time, and sometimes the best way to preserve memories is to have them remain memories, instead of con­stantly trying to recreate the past. And as you can see by my list of possible reunion tours, some things are better off left in the past. 
However, I don't think my speculations are completely implausible. Just consider this: last year, one of the performers who appeared at the JACC was BARRY MANILOW.

pa e 3 Construction causing parking adjustments 
By KELLEY TUTHILL Senior Staff Reporter 
Campus construction on Juniper Road and Green Field has caused some changes in parking at Notre Dame. 
The construction of the new band and ROTC buildings has caused some changes in the D2, C2 and B2 lots on Juniper Road, said Phillip Johnson, assistant director of Security. C2 and B2 lots will now be used exclusively for faculty and st<iff. Students will now park in the D2 lot, said Johnson. 
Security distributed a memo to students who park in D2 
Conservative Iranian government approved 
Associated Press 

NICOSIA, CYPRUS--Iran's Parliament approved all 22 members of President Hashemi Rafsanjani's new government Tuesday, opening the way for economic reform and gradual restoration of ties with the West. 
The official Islamic Republic News Agency said the 270­member Majlis took the "unprecedented" step of endorsing the entire cabinet. In past ballots, deputies reflected several nominees. Earlier reports suggested three cabinet expanded this fall. The D2 lot will extend to the White Field area, north of D2, said Johnson. 
White Field can be used for overflow parking from D2, said Johnson. The area should be paved and fenced by November. Presently the area does have lighting and more lighting will be added soon, according to Johnson. 
Additional overflow parking for D2 is available in the O'Hara-Grace Guest Lot ofT of Bulla Road, said Johnson. Students may also park in the Dl lot south of the stadium. 
Construction on the Green Field area near Notre Dame Avenue has made overflow parking on the Field an impossibility. Johnson said student parking is now in the Cl and Dl lots south of the stadium. 
The Physical Plant department has hired a private consultant to help with the long range planning of campus parking as construction constantly alters the campus, said Donald Dedrick, director of Physical Plant. For the last month this consultant has been studying parking and circulation of cars at Notre Dame. 
Dedrick said eventually the consultant will make a recommendation based on the impact that construction has on parking and circulation. 
candidates would be turned 
down. 
Iran's state TV showed deputies chanting "Death to America! Death to Israel! Death to Britain!" After the results of the secret ballot were read out by Speaker Mehdi Karrubi. 
However, the new cabinet contains more technocrats, many of them Western­educated, than revolutionary ideologues. 
The appointments reflect Rafsanjani's pledge to focus on raising living standards and boost private enterprise after a decade of strict state controls on the economy. 
Rafsanjani had come under fire from radicals for dumping their leaders from his Cabinet. They included outgoing interior minister Ali Akbar Mohtashemi, who was has been closely linked with Shiite Moslem militants holding most of the Western hostages in Lebanon. 
The endorsements came after Karrubi, a member of the radical faction opposed to Rafsanjani's pragmatists, gave the Cabinet list his personal backing at the last minute. 
"I see Mr. Rafsanjani's Cabinet as a successful one and one that supports the deprived... and whose members have worked for the (1979 Islamic) Revolution," Karrubi said. 
Karrubi's support was seen as critical for Rafsanjani, who was elected president July 28 
and  handed broadened  
executive powers.

But Karrubi, who succeeded Rafsanjani as speaker, also said the new ministers would face tough scrutiny in the chamber, where radical factions have dominated since parliamentary elections last year. 

"Our hands will not be tied if a minister gets the vote," he said. 
Rafsanjani, speaking before the vote, called for more government efficiency, noting that in the past "only 50 or 60 percent of programs passed in Parliament had actually been implemented." 
Iran is seeking to rebuild industry after an eight-year war with Iraq. It also hopes to boost productivity after years of economic mismanagement by revolutionary radicals. 
Rafsanjani also is expected to gradually revive links with the West to end Iran's isolation and attract foreign investment. 
A key figure in restoring foreign relations will be Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati, 44, a U.S.-trained pediatrician who helped negotiate the cease-fire with Iraq that took effect in August 1988.

when the next shift came in Sunday morning, police said. The bound employees weren't injured. 
It took the robbers more than one hour to haul the silver from a locked vault to the pickup, said Smith. He said the thieves apparently broke the lock. 
The buttons are made when silver removed from the mine's ore is melted and poured into molds. 
Smith said the mine normally waits until it has about 50,000 ounces --more than 1.5 tons -­of ore, or impure silver, before it ships a load to a smelter for refming. 
The-mine was expected to produce about $4 million worth of silver this year. 
Pershing County authorities notified the precious metals dealers. But Smith and smelter operators said the crooks would probably melt the silver themselves through an arrangement with a smelter or try to ship it out of the country. 
"They seem to have thought out everything beforehand, so I'm sure they've thought this through, too," Smith said. 
Bob Horton, associate dean of the Mackay School of Mines at the University of Nevada­Reno, said authorities could trace the silver by examining its makeup. Every precious metal sample has its own unique mix of impurities.

They were the latest in a wave of terror attacks in Medellin since the cartels declared war on the government. The city had been hit by 17 bombings, killing two people. Three prominent citizens' homes have been doused with gasoline and set afire by pre-dawn attackers.

drug traffickers claimed responsibility for the seven bombings Tuesday and nine bombs that exploded in Medellin on Sunday. The claim came in phone calls to Medellin radio stations. 
In his emotional appeal, which was dated Saturday and appearl)d in the Bogota daily El Tiempo, Ochoa Restrepo called on Barco to "stop the bloodshed in our poor and dear Colombia." 
"Nobody in the world ever won a war, all that is left are orphans, widows and pained mothers," said Ochoa Restrepo, 
65. He said traffickers should be called on "to stop dead" their activities, " No more drug trafficking, no more war, no more killings, no more bombs, no more fire," 
Neither U.S. nor Colombian authorities have accused Ochoa Restrepo of trafficking. But his three sons, Jorge Ochoa Vasquez, Juan Ochoa Vasquez and Fabio Ochoa Vasquez. are alleged to be among the kingpins of the Medellin cocaine cartel and are wanted, along with several other reputed drug barons, by the United States. 
Drug agents believe the cartel is responsible for 80 percent of the cocaine distributed in the United States. 
Ochoa Restrepo asked Barco in the letter to forgive the traffickers who "have made mistakes, they have mothers, fathers, children, brothers, relatives and friends. We're all human." 
He said any negotiated concessions by the traffickers would also require concessions by the leftist Guerrillas. 
The traffickers allegedly have equipped and financed right wing paramilitary death squads that have killed hundreds of suspected leftists and provided security and assassination services for the traffickers. 
In Washington, Mrs. de Greiff pledged Tuesday to continue to fight her country's drug lords despite death threats, and she appealed for more U.S. aid to protect judges.

Burgers and ice cream make Patties unbeatable 
KELLEY TUTHILL 
Accent Writer 

Patties could be called the Arnold's of the 80's. It's burg­ers and fries all at prices even students who are short of money can afford. It even has a jukebox. 
The menu is posted on the wall as you walk into the restaurant and consists of ap­petizers, sandwiches, salads and soups, and a health watch­ers section. After ordering at the counter and receiving a food number, seating is self­service in one of the two seating areas and Pattie's back room has a big-screen T.V. to entertain those still waiting. 
tea. The Coke products come in bottles, so there's no refills on those. Patties serves domestic and imported beers as well. 
Our number to claim our food was called in about 15 minutes. First we tried the spicy meat, cheddar cheese and sour cream potato skins ($3.97) which were five generous potato halves stuffed with toppings. The meat inside, however, wasn't very tasty --it was somewhat like chili meat that had been through a blender. The cheese, bacon, and sour cream skins are probably very good without the meat. 
Our first entree was The Works, a half-pound burger served with french fries or 
PATTifS 
GOURMET BURGERS & ICE CREAM 
The menu lists popular appe­tizers like potato skins, bread­sticks and Mexican dip, and all are priced under $5. Patties of­fers free refills on their Pepsi­Cola drinks and on coffee and onion rings, and a green salad or soup ($5.25). The burger was cooked as ordered and the counter-side condiment bar of­fered a myriad of toppings. The accompanying fries were some 

Robert Smith: Big hair. Bright red clown lips. Blue mascara. Wailing and whining. After over ten years in the sup­posed underground music scene, The Cure have received American airplay, performing to sold out shows in (gasp!) stadiums. With the release of the hit single "Fascination Street" in late spring, the ec­centric, notoriously depressed Smith and his band have made themselves accessible to widespread exposure and po­tential Top 40 material without compromising their unique style and mood by consistently releasing creatively charged al­bums. 
The Cure's latest release, "Disintegration," is their most finely orchestrated mellow ef­fort to date. Gone are the 
gloom-glorifying days of "Faith" and "Pornography," the thrash and psychedelia of eclectic albums such as 'The Top" and "Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me," and the sticky pop songs like "Let's Go to Bed," "Close to Me," and "Why Can't I Be You." 
What's left is a definite ethe­
real mood album with themes 
of nostalgia, hidden feelings, 
and nightmares. Sure, Smith is 
still not a happy camper, but he 
isn't exactly ready to drown 
himself. Many of the songs are 
actually love songs, especially 
"Love Song," the second 
American single that sounds 
like an older Church tune. 
These aren't your ordinary 
love songs. " Plainsong" relates 
an ethereal feeling through a 
conversation, "Untitled" 
speaks of feelings never 
expressed, "Pictures of You" of the best fries that we had 
ever tasted--golden brown gen­
erous cuts of potato. The 
cheese soup that came with the meal was simply melted cheese with some potatoes in it. I sug­gest the salad instead. 
The chicken breast fillet which is charbroiled plain or teriyaki with or without cheese ($3.95) was another great op­tion, and was served with ched­dar cheese melted on top. The side order of spicy fries ($1.80) was just as wonderful as the plain fries (obviously Patties is a great place for fries). The sandwich rolls on both the burger and the chicken sand­wich were excellent, and overall our meals were wonderful. 
During our meal we were easily able to help ourselves to the free refills on Pepsi's. The refills are right near the ice cream bar which makes it very hard to resist an ice cream dessert. 
I soon realized that no one 
would ever want to resist 
dessert at Patties. As I glanced 
over the ice cream menu I saw 
that they have over 300 choices 
of ice cream treats. These sun­
daes and shakes could tempt 
THE CURE 
Disintegration 
The eccentric, notoriously depressed Smith and his band have made themselves accessible to widespread exposure and potential Top 40 material. 
relates nostalgia and love 
through photographs, and 
"Last Dance," a bonus track, is 
about a stale reunion of former 
lovers. "Lullaby," a British sin­
gle, is one of the most interest­
ing tunes on the album. It is 
about a childhood nightmare of 
being eaten by a spider, and it 
is delightfully haunting. 
The upbeat "Disintegration" 
is the only remnant of previous 
thrasher material, while 
"Prayers for Rain" is reminis­
cent of The Cure's gloomy past. 
If the album "Disintegration" 
and its accompanying tour 
(The Cure will be appearing at 
the Rosemont Horizon in 
Chicago this Thursday and 
Friday with Shelleyan Orphan) 
are actually the last, as Smith 
says they are, then the Cure 
certainly have summarized 
their more than ten year career 
ingeniously with this album. 


even Jane Fonda. 

The menu has ice cream so­das, floats, take-home pints and quarts, 105 different sun­daes and 102 types of shakes. Number 85 is the Peppermint Crumb sundae which is pep­permint stick ice cream served on a brownie topped with hot fudge ($1.95). The number 46 shake is the Happy Birthday which is a strawberry shake with moist cake pieces inside topped with whipped cream and even a birthday candle. The back of the ice cream menu adds, "We will be glad to fix you any ice cream combination that you desire," as if there wasn't enough options to please everyone. 
I decided to try a blizzbuster. It's like a milk shake, but a spoon is needed because it is so thick. I tried the Heath Bar which is soft vanilla ice cream that is blended with the candy. 
There are also 20 other types of blizzbusters to choose from. Mine was the perfect ending to an excellent meal. The 12-ounce size is $1.25 and the 16-ounce is $1.59. Don't worry, Patties ~. also has plain old ice cream in cups and cones, with over 20 toppings to choose from. 
Patties is located at 3602 Grape Road, and is open from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. Sunday thru Thursday, and 11 a.m. to 11 
p.m. Friday and Saturday. There's some construction on this end of Grape, but local traffic can bypass the "road closed" sign to get to Patties. Patties also accepts phone orders at 255-5525. 
If you want excellent burgers and fries, or a sandwich at low prices, Patties can't be beat. As for their ice cream, I honestly don't think a better selection could be found anywhere in the Michiana area. Those on diets, beware.

REVIEWS

THE THE 
Mind Bomb 
An album definitely 
toned down... and 
whose subjects are 
definitely more 
concentrated. 
The The, previously the vehi­cle for Matt Johnson and his studio musicians, is now a full­fledged band, whose most no­table new member is former Smiths guitarisVmusic writer Johnny Marr. Their new album is "Mind Bomb," an album defi­nitely toned down from Johnson's previous effort, "Infected," and whose subjects are defmitely more concen­trated: love, sex, and religion. (What else is there, really?) 
The style utilizes such older standards as harmonicas and simple drums with brushes, especially in the album's first single, "The Beat(en) Generation," a sort of summary of all that Johnson thinks is wrong in society (blind religion, political enslavement, war and violence). Religion is also cov­ered in "Good Morning Beautiful," "The Violence of Truth," and "Armageddon Days Are Here (again)," in which "The world is on its elbows and knees/ it's forgotten the mes­sage and worships the creeds." Look out conservative Catholics! 
One of the highlights of the album is a duet with Sinead O'Connor on "Kingdom of Rain," and "Beyond Love" the song that made the PMRC leave their mark on the jacket. "August and September" is an­other likable mellow song. Over all, "Mind Bomb" is noth­ing spectacular, but it can be quite enjoyable at times, although I expected a little more from Marr. Listen for their new single "Gravitate to Me" on underground radio.

Old-timers shine at rainy U.S. Open 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK--Jimmy Connors and Chris Evert, longtime crowd favorites at the U.S. Open and winners of 11 champ­ionships between them, took fans on a sentimental journey Tuesday with victories that brightened a rainy day. 
Connors, four days shy of 37 and fresh after a nine-week va­cation from tennis, played with nearly the same verve he showed in his first Open 20 years ago as he crushed 24­year-old Tom Nijssen of the Netherlands 6-2, 6-1, 6-2. 
" I didn't hang around tennis all summer," said Connors, who set a record for most matches in a U.S. Championship with 103, one more than Vic Seixas, "I really got away and I like it. I come back and I see some things I enjoy, and a lot of the things I'm glad I got away from. My tennis was OK, it was the men­tal outlook that wasn't too good." 
The fans were with Connors on every point, but they showed a special affection for Evert, whom they've adored from her debut as a pony-tailed teen­ager through her years as six­time champion. 
After a loving ovation as she started her 19th Open, Evert, a little nervous, her baseline shots less precise than in the past, made the points she

from that team, which finished with five consecutive victories. The offense will be directed by junior quarterback Shawn Moore, 19th in the nation last year in total offense. 
"We think our program has reached the level where we can be competitive with anyone," Welsh said. 
"When I first came to Virginia in 1982, it was hard to recruit. Now we have a much more positive image and play­ers want to come here." 
Although Virginia and Notre Dame have both been playing needed to beat Argentina's Bettina Fulco 6-4, 6-2. 
There were some tense mo­ments and a few rain delays on the second day of the Open, but the only upsets were minor ones, ninth-seeded Pam Shriver losing 6-2, 6-3 to Larisa Savchenko of the Soviet Union, and 10th-seeded Mary Joe Fernandez falling to Wendy White 6-4, 6-3. 
Sweden's Stefan Edberg seed third, beat Argentina's Javier Frana 7-6, 6-2, 7-5; Andre Agassi, seeded sixth, beat Robbie Weiss 6-3, 7-6, 6-4, Tim Mayotte, seeded ninth, beat Marc Flur 6-1. 6-3, 6-2. 
Martina Navratilova, the sec­ond-seeded woman beat new­comer Ei lida of Japan 6-0, 6-2. Gabriela Sabatini, the third seed of Argentina, beat Claudia Porwik of West Germany 6-1, 6-2. 
Evert, 34, who seeded fourth, had her parents, brother and husband, skier Andy Mill, at courtside, filled with emotion and memories along with the fans, wondering at times early in the match whether this would be her last. 
Evert's decision to end her in­volvement in major tennis after the Open, perhaps to pursue motherhood, put drama in her appearance but no extra pres­sure on her. 
"It doesn't feel any different with me," she said. "I'm aware of people's reaction, being a lit­tle more supportive because it's 
football for 100 years, this will be the first meeting between the schools. 
"Our kids are very excited about playing Notre Dame," Welsh said. 
"They've worked very hard in practice because they know if they don't play well, they're go­ing to be 0-1." 
With so many Notre Dame alumni and fans in the New York area, most of the sellout crowd of 76,891 will be rooting for the Fighting Irish. 
"That shouldn't bother us," Welsh said. "We play before that kind of crowd at Clemson and we enjoy it." 
Notre Dame is the fourth de­fending national champion to play in the Kickoff Classic. 
my last Open." 
She began inauspiciously, 
broken by Fulco after a batch 
of unforced errors --a fore­
hand in the net, another one 
long, one more in the net and 
final one wide. 
"My whole career people have been talking about how tough I am," she said. "Now that I'm losing some, I can see how tough I was --the killer in­stinct, the single-mindedness, playing like a machine. But, boy, that's what made me a champion." 
She bit her lip on the court after that first game and looked down. This was not the way she wanted to start. Fulco, though, began her service with a double-fault, and Evert seized the opportunity, eventually breaking her on crisp forehand volley after coming in behind a drop shot. 
It was Evert's 98th career victory at the Open, against only 11 losses. Incredibly, she has won 202 sets and dropped just 33. 
She reached the semifinals in her first U.S. Open, in 1971, made the semis the next three years, then began a streak of four straight titles from 197 5 through 1978. After losing in the finals in 1979, she won again in 1980, lost in the semis in 1981 and won for the last time in 1982.

Rose implicated by second witness 
Associated Press 
CINCINNATI --A second fed­eral witness implicated Pete Rose in an alleged tax-fraud scheme Tuesday involving a winning race track ticket. 
Another witness in the trial of former Rose housemate Thomas Gioiosa also said that Rose was part of a group that often talked about gambling and drugs. 
The testimony in the third day of Gioiosa's trial on cocaine and tax-evasion charges con­tradicted Rose's contention that he had nothing to do with the winning race ticket. 
Rose also has maintained he didn't know about the drug ac­tivities of those who operated Gold's Gym in suburban Cincinnati where he worked out-an assertion challenged in testimony Tuesday. 
Rose was banned for life from baseball last week by Commissioner A. Bartlett Giamatti after a baseball inves­tigator concluded the former Cincinnati Reds manager bet on his own team. Rose has denied betting on baseball, but ac­cepted the lifetime ban as fair. 

A Federal Grand Jury is looking into whether Rose paid all the required taxes on his in­come from gambling, memora­bilia sales and autograph ap­pearances. The government has indicated the Pik Six race ticket involving Gioiosa is part of that investigation. 
Prosecutors have accused Gioiosa, 31, of falsely claiming on his taxes that he owned a winning $47,646 Pik Six ticket from Turfway Park in Florence, Ky., that actually belonged to Rose. The government alleges Gioiosa claimed the ticket be­cause he was in a lower tax bracket than Rose. 
Rose has denied any involve­ment in the winning ticket, and Gioiosa has pleaded innocent. However, accountant Joseph

Mansour testified Tuesday that Gioiosa told him he was claim­ing the ticket for Rose. 
Mansour did Gioiosa's tax returns for 1985-87. 
"He volunteered the informa­tion that the winning ticket be­longed to Pete Rose, and he was going to forward to pay the taxes on it," Mansour said. 
Mansour, like Gioiosa, was a bodybuilder who worked out at Gold's Gym. He was testifying Tuesday under a plea agree­ment with the federal govern­ment to clear up his own tax problems-failing to file a 1985 return. 
Defense lawyer Martin Pinales tried to undermine Mansour's testimony by point­ing out the accountant's legal problems. He also said a taped conversation has Mansour telling another former Rose as­sociate, Paul Janszen, that Gioiosa claimed the winning ticket was his alone. 
After Mansour said he didn't remember that second conver­sation, Pinales had the tape played for him on headphones; jurors and reporters weren't permitted to hear it. Mansour than acknowledged he had told Janszen in that conversation that Gioiosa claimed the win­ning ticket was his. 
The government contends that Gioiosa was part of a ma­jor cocaine smuggling opera­tion.

Bears' Douglass, Eagles' Solt among steroid suspensions 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK-The NFL's first­
ever crackdown on steroids hit 
home Tuesday for 13 players, 
including former Pro Bowl 
guard Ron Solt, who were 
suspended for four games after 
testing positive for the muscle­
enhancing drug. 
The players suspended, three 
of them from the Buffalo Bills, 
were hardly household names. 
Other than the Eagles' Solt, 
who is recuperating from op­
erations on both knees, 
perhaps the best known player 
is Maurice Douglass, a backup 
defensive back for the Chicago 
Bears who spends the off-sea­
son as an exotic dancer. 
Those suspended came from 
just eight of the league's 28 
teams. 
Most seemed to fall into the
1
category defined by U.S. District Judge Thomas Hogan, who in turning down the play­ers' union request to stop the 

Student football ticket information 
Special to The Observer 
The Notre Dame athletic de­partment ticket office has an­nounced procedures fur 1989 season football ticket sales to students. Ticket applications will be in Notre Dame student mailboxes early next week, and Saint Mary's students will re­ceive their applications at reg­istration. 
Any students who do not re­ceive their applications by Thursday, Aug. 31, should get in touch with the ticket office to receive a copy of the applica­tion form. Students who do not have a local (Michiana-area) address should also contact the ticket office for their applica­tions. 
Distribution begins Tuesday, Sept. 5, at the Joyce ACC ticket booth, with seniors getting first shot at 50-yard line seats. This year's prices for the five­game home season are $57.50 for Notre Dame students and $77 for Saint Mary's students. 
Kickoff 
continued from page 12 
The same can not be said of Michigan and its younger play­ers. The Wolverines have to open their season against the national champions. In an evenly-matched contest like Notre Dame-Michigan, a game of experience could make a big difference. 
If Notre Dame defeats Virginia and receives no major injuries, and those are two big ifs, the scheduling of the Kickoff Classic could look like a great idea later in the season. 

Rozelle said he made the an­nouncement so early in the year to give players using steroids time to get the body-building substances out of their systems long before training camp tests. In both 1987 and 1988, six percent of the players had positive steroid tests at camp. 
The players' union on Monday failed to get a court order pre­venting the league from releas­ing the names. It claimed the penalty was actually harsher than for illegal drugs, for which players are suspended only after a second offense. 
The union also claimed that some of the players were inno­cent, suggesting that some players taking medication may have used what the NFL defines as "masking agents" for steroid. Under Rozelle's policy, they are considered evidence of steroid use. 
The NFL said the players have been placed on the "non­football illness" list and must remain away from their teams' training facilities until Sept. 27. If the substances remain in their system after that, they would continue to be sus­pended. 
The league said if a player tests positive again, he would be banned for the rest of the season.

suspensions, acknowledged that the crackdown "could be fatal to a marginal player." 
The league, which tested 2,200 players in camp, said an unspecified number of others tested positive but had been cut "for lack of playing ability." 
In addition to Solt and Douglass, those suspended in­cluded two brothers, running back Sean and linebacker Tom Doctor of Buffalo and a third Bill, Linebacker Matt Jaworski; offensive linemen Mike Ariey and Keith Uecker of Green Bay; defensive end Mark Mraz of the Los Angeles Raiders; tight end Vernon Kirk of the Los Angeles Rams; running back Vince 
Amoia and wide receiver Bobby same punishment given players Riley of the New York Jets; and for illegal drug use-a four­

from players proclaiming their innocence and suggesting that the tests may have mistaken medication for either masking agents or steroids. 
But NFL spokesman Joe Browne said: 
"We conducted Olympic-cal­iber testing that takes every­thing into account." 
However, a league statement acknowledged, "We cannot guarantee our testing has de­tected or will detect every steroid user in the NFL." 
The suspensions are the re­sult of a March 21 announce­ment by Commissioner Pete Rozelle who said players using steroids would be handed the 

running back Keith Henderson and nose tackle Rollin Putzier of San Francisco. 
The accuracy of the testing was immediately challenged by the NFL Players Association, which said it had received calls

game suspension. He also said players would be banned if traces of "masking agents" for steroids turned up in the tests. 
Players received notification of the policy, 10 days later, on March 31. 

All applications must be accompanied by student IDs. 
The windows will be open from 1:30 p.m. to 8 p.m. September 5th through the 8th. Juniors can get their tickets September 6, sophomores, law students and grad students September 7, and freshmen September 8. One student may bring as many as four applica­tions and IDs. Married students may purchase tickets for spouses at the student price, but proof of marriage is required. 
The 1:30 starting time is in­tended to reduce the need for overnight lines, according to Associate Ticket Manager Jim Bell. 
"Camping over is discour­aged," Bell said. "In the morn­ings, we'll be as flexible as we can be as long as the lines are orderly and the area is kept clean. But we don't need the furniture and stuff out all night like we've had in the past."

Holtz has his usual dismal outlook 
His defending champs are "not as good as you think" 
Associated PrM8 
EAST RUTHERFORD. N.J-lf Lou Holtz had managed the 1927 Yankees, he probably would have moaned about Babe Huth's strikeouts and convinced writers that the club was head­ing for a last-place finish. So it isn't surprising that the coach of defending national champion Notre Dame is already poor­mouthing his team's chances in 1989. 
wwe're not a top 20 team right now," Holtz said at a news conference Tuesday. wwe're not as good as you think, but we're probably not as bad as I think." 
Actually, Holtz has reason to worry as his team prepares to open the college football season against Virginia in Thursday night's Kickoff Classic at Giants Stadium. 
In the last month, Notre Dame has lost seven players expected to play a significant role on this year's team. One quit, another transferred, two were banished for disciplinary reasons, two couldn't recover from lingering injuries and one was declared academically in­eligible. 

The most damaging depar­tures were All-American linebacker Michael Stonebreaker and running back Tony Brooks, the team's sec­ond-leading rusher last season. Also gone for the season are defensive tackle George Williams, fullback Braxston Banks, defensive end Arnold Ale, linebacker John Foley and offensive tackle Pete Rausch. 
"We've got a completely dif­ferent team than the one we started spring practice with," Holtz said. WWe're awfully thin at a lot of positions and we've got an awful lot of question marks." 
Holtz tried his best to portray the Fighting Irish as under­manned, overrated and, in one case at least, underfed. 
"Our second-string defensive tackle is a true freshman who only weighs 216 pounds," he said. "He's going to be a good one-as soon as he finds the cafeteria." 
A steady diet of Rice is what Notre Dame's opponents will be fed this season. Versatile quar­terback Tony Rice not only threw for 1,176 yards and eight touchdowns last season, but also led the team in rushing with 700 yards. 
wwe've spent a lot of time working on his best plays," Virginia coach George Welsh said. wBut maybe his best plays won't be the same this year." 
Unlike Notre Dame, Virginia is not a traditional football power. But Welsh has led the Cavaliers to five winning sea­sons in the past six years, in­cluding a 7·-4 mark in 1988.

Cubs rally from nine-run deficit 
Associated Pl'88s 
CHICAGO--Dwight Smith's bases-loaded single in the 10th inning capped the Chicago Cubs' rally from a 9-0 deficit to a 10-9 victory over the Houston Astros Tuesday. 
Smith made his game-winning hit to right field off Dave Smith, 3-4. 
Paul Assenmacher, 2-3, re­lieved to start the 1Oth inning and got the victory. 
Houston built its 9-0 lead on walks, Chicago errors and a grand slam by Rafael Ramirez. 
Ramirez' second career grand slam was the only Houston hit in the fifth inning, when the Astros scored five runs. 
Cubs began their comeback in the sixth when a throwing error by pitcher Mike Portugal and Domingo Ramos' RBI sin­gle provided two runs. In the seventh, Lloyd McClendon hit a two-run homer. 
Cardinals 4, Reds 2 
Joe Magrane got his National League-leading 18th victory Tuesday night as the St. Louis Cardinals beat the Cincinnati Reds 4-2. 
All of the game's runs came in the sixth inning. 

Rookie Jeff Richardson hit a two-run homer off Magrane in the top half before Terry Pendleton's two-run doubled keyed a four-run rally in the Cardinals' sixth. 
Magrane, 18-7, has won 13 of his last 14 starts and tied Oakland's Dave Stewart for most victories in the majors. Magrane gave up eight hits, walked two and struck out three in his league-leading ninth complete game. 
Tim Leary, 9-12, held the Cardinals to two hits for five innings,. 
But in the sixth he hit Willie McGee with d pitch and Milt Thompson and Pedro Guerrero singled for a run. 
Pendleton's double put the Cardinals ahead and Tom Brunansky triple for a 4-2 lead. 
Phillies 6, Giants 1 

Von Hayes hit three home runs and drove in six runs Tuesday night, leading the Philadelphia Phillies over the San Francisco Giants 6-1. 
Hayes hit a solo home run in the first inning, a three-run shot in the fourth and a two­run drive in the ninth. 
Bruce Ruffin , 4-8, ended his five-game losing streak and improved to 2-6 lifetime against San Francisco. He gave up four hits and left after a leadoff walk in the eighth Roger McDowell finished with two-hit relief for his 16th save.. 
Hayes' first two runs came against Don Robinson, 11-9. He connected in the ninth against Craig Lefferts. 
Pirates 5, Braves 4 
Andy VanSlyke drove in two runs, including an RBI double during a three-run first inning first inning Tuesday night that sent the Pittsburgh Pirates over the Atlanta Braves. 5-4. 
Winner Doug Drabek, 11-10, gave up six hits, including two homers by Oddibe McDowell, and four runs in 7 1-3 innings. 
Tom Glavine, 12-8 was the loser. The Pirates twice bunted with good results in the first inning. 
Billy Hatcher led off with a single, Jay Bell got a bunt single and Jeff King was safe on a fielder's choice when the Braves failed to cover third base on his bunt. 
Bobby Bonilla hit a sacrifice fly, R.J. Reynolds singled home a run and Van Slyke hit an RBI 
double. see BASE! page o 


The Observer/File Photo 
Irish head coach Lou Holtz is, as usual, downplaying his team's abilities days before the 1989 Kickoff Classic. In the wake of the losses of five regular players, his pessimism is warranted as the Irish prepare to face the Virginia Cavaliers. 
Making the best of the Kickoff Classic 
If history is any indication, Notre Dame doomed its foot­ball team's chances of repeating a national title before any Irish player donned shoulder pads for spring practice. 
When the University added Thursday's Kickoff Classic to the 1989 schedule last winter, the Irish inherited the Virginia Cavaliers and a seven-year jinx as opponents this season. 
The three previous national champions to play in the Classic, an annual matchup at Giants Stadium since 1983 to open the college football season, have gone on to suffer dis­appointing years. 
Penn State, fresh off its first national championship, was humbled 44-6 by Nebraska in the inaugural Classic. 
A Bernie Kosar-led Miami team defeated Auburn 20-18 in 1984, but ended Jimmy Johnson's debut season with three consecutive losses and an 8-5 record. Brigham Young toyed with Boston College 28-14 in the 1985 matchup, but the Cougars also faded at the end of the year. 
This trend of staggering down the stretch has been in­herent in many other Kickoff Classic teams. An Alabama team featuring Cornelius Bennett, Bobby Humphrey and 
Steve Megargee 
Irish Items 

Mike Shula opened the 1986 season by defeating Ohio State at the Classic, and was considered a national championship contender. The Tide instead lost three games in the second half of the season. 
Perhaps sensing the possible danger ahead, UCLA and Clemson declined offers to play in this year's matchup, leav­ing Virginia as Notre Dame's opponent. 
While the Cavaliers of the Atlantic Coast Conference have improved in the last few seasons under George Welsh, the Irish are understandably prohibitive favorites to return to South Bend undefeated. 
Notre Dame's decision to participate in the Classic still could have its consequences. 
With five of their first six games away from Notre Dame Stadium, the players easily could be tiring as much as past Kickoff Classic teams by the time the Irish end their season at Penn State and Miami. 
And this game will be remembered for all the wrong rea­sons if a key Notre Dame player gets injured Thursday on the Giants Stadium artificial surface and is unable to play in the showdown with Michigan two weeks later. 
Nonetheless, the recent developments involving Notre Dame have made the idea of playing in the Classic seem bet­ter and better. 
The unexpected losses in personnel over the last month have left the Irish suddenly thin in many areas, particularly on defense. It would have been difficult to imagine this team opening the season at Michigan. 
Nobody has to worry about that anymore. The Irish now will enter Michigan Stadium with a game's worth of experi­ence. Newcomers to the lineup like Bob Dahl, Donn Grimm and Scott Kowalkowski will have their first starts behind them.
