Onl' Saturday last spring, Kathlcc:n O'Brien disappt·an:d. Sht· hadn't slt-pt in hl'r bed the night hdorc. lin towd was ~till-dry. lin purse was t'Ot'kl'll ag;tinst tht· hookshdf as it had ht'l'n sincl' Friday aftc:rnoon. 
Kathkc:n was not at thl' library. She was at nt:ithn the: Jluddlt: nor in the LaFortune Ballroom. She wasn't at till' wotto. The Crypt was c:mpty; 

The key symptoms of anorexia nen•osa are: e_XllJ!,­

only a handful of tourists whispt·red in Sac.:rt:d Heart. She was nowht·rt: around the lakes. No one had seen ht•r at the dining hall since Thursday. 
·Friends were concerned. "Dear" friends were frantic, hut little surprist·d. Kathleen had been acting strangely for weeks. She no longer joined in traditional, alm~>st sac.:rcd Monday· Wednesday-Friday lull(:h gatherings. What's more, she rept:atcdly sk)ppcd meals altoget· her. 
Rut she was eating. llealt/ly, wholesome Kathleen had been caught gorging herself on pizzas or goldfish crackers or Hostess Pies many a late night. Friends urged Kathleen to talk to a counselor, hut she refused. 

One moment she would attac.:k, 
"There's no rc.ason ti>r me to ask 

anyone for help!" the next she would cry, "I can't write anymore, I c.:an't do anything. There's no dircc.:­tion to my life. I'm ju~t a burden to everyone." She often mocked the girdle commercial: "I'm out of con­trol!" Kathleen hated herself: 
One night Kathlcen complained that she hadn t even enough "power to end it all." Friends went to Psyc­hologic.:al Services the next morning. They were told that until Kathleen initiated a rl'qucsl for help, nothing couh.l he done. 
"Control seems to he the focus of the psycho-physiological illness known as Anorexia Ncrvosa," said Director of Psychological Services Patricia Crosson. Citing statistics provided hy John Hopkins Univl'f­sity, Crosson said that six percent of the women and one percent of the men in the 15-25 a14c group arc anorectic. Typically, she said, anorexht is an illness of girls in their mid-to late teens who develop maladjusted eating habits as a means of controlling an authority t1gurc, usually a parc:nt of the ~arne sex. 
Tht· anorc:c.:tic is playing children's games, said Crosson. "A child mishc:havcs in order to get at­tc:ntion. The attention dc:rivc:d is thcrdi>rc: reinti>rcing to tht• mis­hc:havior." For that and other reasons, Crosson daimcd. · the anorectic is a poor candidate t(,r treatment. 
"The anorectic is expcrit:ndng an ordinary adoksccnt struggle for sc:Jf. assertion. The prohlcm is one: of control: wanting to control one's own actions and controlling othns through manipulation," Crosson said.

Foreign policy 

Colonel attacks Carter 
By MIKE DUPLESSIE 
Neu•s Staff 
Air forc.:c Colond Gail Bulmer last night attackl'd Jimmy Carter's li>reign policy as heing "inconsist~nt and naive," expounding that Carter's devotion to human rights exhibited thl' former president's political im­maturity. 
Bulmn, a distinguishl'd 2 "i-yc:ar man in th~ Unill'd States Air Force who served in both Viet Nam and Iran, addressed a small gathering in Cavanaugh llall's study lounge on "The Carter Foreign Policy." 
The outstanding diplomatic mo­ments of the Cartt·r administration's foreign policy wt·rc the Camp David Accord, the Panama Canal Treaty and the fall of the Shah of Iran, Bul­mer said. 
Bulmc:r said it "was still to early to tell" on the Camp David Accords, but hl' ft:ds whik bringing "peace on papt•r" they have in fact "c.:auscd more turmoil than they have solvc:d." 

lie rated Carter's stand on the Panama Canal Treaty as highly courageous, stating that the t(>rmcr prl'sidl'nl dcscrvc:s a "pat on the hack" li>r his actions supporting the transfer of the canal to the: Panamanians. 
If the Panama Canal was Cart~r·s greatest triumph then Iran was most certainly his greatest failure, Bulmc:r asserted. lie not only stated that the l 'nited States was "dirn·tly rcspon­sihk" for the Shah's demise hut fur­ther dahoratl'd that the: "cause of the Shah's fall was a U.S. foreign polk·y blunder." 

Bulmer praised Carter's unbiased handling ofthl' Israelis and the Arab~ . as a departure from traditional diplomacy. This t'qual trl'alml'nt, while it hurt him in the polls, was a very foward-looking and intelligent policy, according to Bulmer. 
Finally, Bulmc:r discussed the reasons for the dcfc:nsc of SOillt' of­our allies. "If oil was replaced, we would have: no vital interest in tht· M itldlt: East," he ohscrvc:d. 
He added that "were a crisis to oc­cur we would not support lsrad or Saudi Arabia." 
Bulmer rcmarkt·d that he "t·an not justify the dcft·nst· ofJapan," stating thl' only reasons he c.:ould think of wert• that Japan "has ht·t·n a frknd fi>r 35 yl'ars, and Wl' Gill not lc:t tht· country go Communist." 
Bulmt·r advocatnl the support of yet another prohkm art·a, Ml'xico, "for its gas and oil, if no otht·r reason." 


McCartney buys ND Victory March 
By DAVID SARPHIE 
StaffReporter 
The recent purchase of the"Notrc Dame Victory March" hy the publishing company of singer-songwriter Paul McCartnt·y will not af. feet the music department in any way. According to tht· dirt·ctor of Notre Dame bands, Rit:hard O'Brien, tht· move was ·mcrdy an invest-. mcnt on the part of the cx-Beatlc:'s publishing company, MPI. Com­munications, Inc. 
O'Brien noted that thl' Mt:lrose Co. originally controlled the rights to the victory march and most college tight songs across tht· country. The Company was, in turn, owned by tht· Edwin Morris Co. of New York. "The only change i~ that now MPL owns Edwin Morris," O'Brien cxplainc:d. 
O'Brien said that ownership of the publishing rights is of littk con­;;~qucncc to the University's music department. "It doesn't hotht·r mt· who owns it," O'Brien remarked. "We won't have to pay any more for usc of the music." 
Aspokesman for the Edwin Morris Co. agrl't:d. "Nothing willt·hangt· for your school," he said. 
He denied a rc:port that the University ofWisconsin, anotht·r school affected by the purchase, had taken any al:tion to obtain the rights to its tight song "On, Wisconsin." 
Stories in recent issues of Sports Illustrated and Billboard Magazine had caused confusion among many siUdcnts on the Notre Dame campus. "Pcoplt: think that we have to pay someone t:lsc: a nick­el cvc:ry time we play the 'Victory March,"' O'Brien said. "That's just not true."

Lawyers for Indiana Marine Pfc. Robert Gar­
wood. who was convicted last week ofcollaborating with the enemy in Vietnam, yesterday accused the presiding judge of misconduct and asked him to dt!clare a mistrial. The judge, Col. R.E. Switzer, took the motion for a mistrial under consideration but denied other defense requests that he overturn Garwood's conviction for collaboration and assaulting a fellow prisoner of war. Garwood's chiefdefense counsel, John Lowe, accused Switzer of making improper comments to news reporters while covering the lengthy court-martial of the 34-year-old Adams, Ind., native. Lowe cited interviews with Switzer broadcast by CBS television on Dec. 17, Dec. 19 and Feb. 6 and by ABC-1V on Feb. 
22. He also raised the possibility that three members of the jury may have ovnheard derogatory comments made about Garwood last week while a reporter was interviewing Marine offkers in an officer's club whert." the jurors Wt."re having lunch. Garwood, who spent almost 14 yt."ars as a prisoner of war, will be sentc.'nced following further tes­timony bdore tht." same five-mt."mbt."r jury that convicted him last week.

This covers 374,000 pupils. 7) The summer youth job program, which covers 665,000 youths. The 665,000 figure is less than the approximately 1 million youths who took part last year, but is the same as was proposed by the 
outgoing Carter administration. -AP 
American writer Cynthia Dwyer Hew out of 
Iran til freedom yesterday after nine months imprisonment and a one­day mix-up in her deportation, leaving one American still captive of the Iranians. The 49-year-old Mrs. Dwyer, a free-lance journalist con­victed ofespionage and then ordered deported, arrive in Dubai on an Iranian plane loaded with peasants. A ~pokesman at the Swiss Foreign Office in Bern said she would fl to Zurich today, arriving at 2:35 a.m. EST, and then to New York a few hours later. Sources here said the Singapore Airlines flight to Zurich departed as scheduled but airport. officials refused to ay if Mrs. Dwyer was aboard the jetliner. Mrs. Dwyer, met by U.S. Embassy officials on her arrival in Dubai, was whisked· away in a police car without talking to reporters. She was due to fly on to Switzerland and then to New York today for a reunion with her husband and three children. -AP 
Three Mile Islandnuclear plant operators withheld ini­tial information from the government on the true severity of the March 1979 accident, House investigators claimed yesterday. In the early hours ofthe nation's most serious civilian nuclear accident, plant managers supplied misleading data to state and federal officials, the investigators' study added. This alleged conduct by TMI employees could have jeopardized the health and safety ofarea residents had "a major release of radiation occurred," the investigators asserted. The allegations, which appeared to contradict other official investigations of the accident in placing blame, were part of a 250-page report prepared by the majority staffofthe House Interior and Insular Affairs Committee. The report, a copy of which was obtained by The As­sociate t Press, all but completes the last of four major governmental inquiri.:s into the accident. The Interior Committee has not yet taken action on the study. -AP 
Most assaults on campus mascots arc done 
.in the dead of night, with paint brush and pail, by students of a rival school. The Pennsylvania State lfniversity mascot -the mighty Nit­tany Lion -was a victim of an attack recently that required only a camera and a naked female. According to the student newspaper, pictures have recently appeared around town featuring a young woman. dad only in red high heels, with the campus statue ofthe lion. The pictures are apparently being sold by a local photographer. The newspaper. the Daily Collegian, responded angrily to this attack on tht· lion's integrity. not to mention his modesty, and called on school offidals to investigate and, ifpo'ssible, prosecute the perpetrator ofthe nil deed. "Clearly photographs which exploit the female body and usc a well-known symbol to do so are harmful to the University's image." -The Observer 
A violent storm crossed the central part of the nation yesterday, dumping heavy snow from the Rockies to the eastern Great Lakes and sending heavy thunderstorms and tornadoes into the South. Strong winds and cold temperatures combined to produce wind chill factors of 40 to SO below zero from Montana to Ohio. The cold and highways slickened by snow and ice were blamed for at least seven deaths. New snowfall of up to six inches was predicted in Wisconsin, and blizzard conditions were predicted during the night as the storm moved eastward across Illinois. Heavy rain was expected along parts ofthe East Coast. A tornado watch was in effect across parts ofFlorida, Alabama and Georgia. Temperatures at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 23 below zero at Bozeman, Mont., to 85 at Brownsville, Texas. -AP

Apples or Pinstripes? 
Money and majors are topics especially timely this week. While University officials were foreshadowing a 12 percent tuition increase last week, President Reagan, in an attempt to restore fiscal order, was ordering dras­tic cutbacks in federally funded student aid programs. And to further emphasize how timely money is, Fr. Hes­burgh commented in a recent interview that "we are in a depression." Money is indeed quite topical. 
Major is especially relevant because freshmen must soon declare their colleges; sophomores must soon declare specific majors; juniors still playing musical majors must reluctantly commit themselves to a course of study, and seniors must decide how to put their majors to use. 
In times ofeconomic bleakness, the most marketable major not only becomes practical, but essential. Anyone shelling out $6,000 annually for an education should righteously demand ·that a S25,000 educate compensate him. But the question does arise: What constitutes a "practical" major? Business, engineering, science -these are practical, if one is inclined toward them. But is it practical to major in engineering if one despises the sight ofa calculator? 
Last week, a group ofstudents were commenting that it is no longer practical to study liberal arts at Notre Dame. Gradually, the group concluded that it is not practical to study liberal arts period. Such a philosophy is clothed in misconceptions. Business, science. and engineering majors take no offense for what is to follow, for this column is not directed towards those who enjoy these particular majors. Those ofyou, on the other hand, who are begin­ning to question the value of a liberal arts education, who worry about making your­selves marketable, or find your yourselves in business or engineering for sheerly mercenary motives -onward read. 
If one is solely concerned with obtaining employ­ment, there are jobs. For some students, however, a liberal arts education connotates visions of managing a McDonald's, qr at worst, visions of peddling apples on some far and distant streetcorner. Perhaps these visions are conjured by those Placement Bureau interview sheets, which at first sight convey the impression that companies come to you. But liberal arts students quick­ly discover they will have few if any friendly, enthusias­tic employers in pinstriped suits wining and dining them. 
• A recent Chicago Tribune article, however, con­tended that while liberal arts majors do enter the job circuit in lower positons than those with vocationalized majors, they rise to higher and more top-level postions over time. The reason? They are more adaptable and get a grasp of a company's overview much more readily than highly specialized personnel. 

A liberal arts major will have to invest in manila en­
velopes, type resumes, scope out companies and seII himself. This can be done, but this point I shall not belabor. The bottom line is that a price tag cannot be put on a liberal arts education. Liberal arts endow a per­son with something fundamental and essential and something that will last as long as life. That something is the ability to think. 
By reading, interpreting and then analyzing -the stuff of which liberal arts courses are ,made -one learns the art ofthinking. And thinking is a true art to be learned. Such lies the purpose behind the papers we procrastinate and with the help of caftcine, eventually pound out while the television bids all a good night. 
Not only is one taught to think; one is taught to ap­
preciate works and cultures ancient and rich. Theorems 
of calculus and chemical 
equations will easily fade 
from memory as will charac­
ters from novels and tidbits of wisdom from revered philosophers. An apprecia­tion for those characters aAd 
tidbits,  however,  will  not  
fade.  
Psychologists  estimate  

that at best a student retains only 35 percent of what is taught in any formal course ofstudy. With the years, this 35 percent of actual factual knowledge diminishes. Therefore, an appreciation for culture, and humanistic thinking, assumes all the more value when one con­siders how much "book 
knowledge" is actually retained. 
jlerhaps the tendency to thumb noses at liberal arts in times of economic crisis stems from the American mindset. American culture emphasizes vocationalism -putting in one's 40 hours, then breaking out the Lowenbrau on weekends and forgetting. For some, this lifestyle is inescapable. 
But college students do have more control over their lives than assembly line workers with mouths to feed. Students then should not let dollar signs and job statis­tics coerce them into majors which really do not suit their needs or their tastes. There is nothing waSteful about a liberal arts education; there is something tragi­cally wasteful, however, about a major simply chosen for the doll,ar value of the job that follows it. 
Four years ofone's life is a considerable investment of time. Consider then that a liberal arts major is investing in himself -betting on himself. And apples? Just silly visions.

"To win it all, you have to have the right mental approach. I think the scheduie we play from here on in will help us to acheive the proper at­titude."· 
The game proved to be a good op­portunity for Phelps to get all of his players in the action. 
"For a time in the second half, I had what amounted to next year's team in the game with Andree or Kleine, Paxson, Bill Varner, Tom Sluby, and Mike Mitchell," said Phelps. "I wanted a chance to see how they worked together in a game situation. These are things that you just can't get in practice." 
Pitino earned the praise of Phelps after the game, when'the Irish coach called him one of the best young coaches in the country.

"Guys like Rick, and Lefty Ervin ot LaSalle are going to be the big names in college basketball in about ten years. Luckily, I'll be long gone by then." 
Pitino tried to put the game in perspective. 
"When you try to play a good schedule, and upgrade your program, you are going to suffer along the way," he said. "We were not a good representative ofEastern basketball tonight. We are actually very competitive back then.:. Believe me there is some tough bas· ketball played back there, whether you people in the Midwest believe it or not." 
"We by no means expected to come out here and win tonight. But by the same token, I feel that we could have played much more com­petitively than we did." 
"Down the road a couple ofyears, these games will mean a better program at BU. I just hope that the road is a short one."

Woolridge, Irish slam Boston 
By Skip Desjardin 
Sports Writer 
It was all over before it ever really got started. 
Notre Dame opened a 10-0 lead over the Terriers of Boston Univer­sity in the first five minutes of last night's game. and they never looked hack. By the time it was over, Digger Phelps had his 200th win at Notrre Dame. and the Irish had hiked their record to 17-4 with an 89-6.3 vic­tory. 
Orlando Woolridge put on a show for the hearty few who braved the storm to witness the game. He led all scorers with 18. including four slam­dunks. 
Tht· Irish hit 1 S of their first I 7 shots in the game. At the end of the first half, their tleld goal percentage ~>tood at 74 percent mostly on the strength of perfect shooting from the floor on the parts of Kelly Tripucka. Tracy Jackson, and Tim Andree. 
At the same time. Boston U. was hitting only 28 percent of their first halfshots. 
"Our team was totally intimidated by Notre Dame," said Terrier coach Rick Pitino after it was all over. 

"They weren't so much in awe of this team as they were of Notre Dame in and of itself. We just were not mentally prepared to play tonight" 
For their part, the Irish seemed to have forgotten Sunday's loss to UCLA, and came out firing. 
"We had the mental intensity tonight that we were lacking Sun­day," said Phelps. "It was just one of those times when we were really in a groove. 
"We saw the tapes of their game against Boston College,,so we had a lot of respect for them coming into this one. Nobody out here knows it, but Boston College is playing the best basketball ofanyone in the East, and BU had them on the ropes late in their game." 
After the game, Phelps brushed aside questions on the significance of the milestone 200th Notre Dame visctory. 
"Big deal." he said. "All I want js a national title. What's 200 wins? It's just a number." 
Woolridge brought the crowd to its feet with slam dunks four times in the ballgame. He got the biggest reaction of the night for a reverse dunk after an assist from John Paxson. 
Jackson regained the shooting touch that seemed to elude him against UCLA. He was 8 of 10 from the field for 17 points. 
Phelps made it quite clear after the game that he had made no major adjustments or corrections after Sunday's loss. 
"We didn't need to make correc­tions. Our game plan was sound, our strategy was right. UCLA just hit their foul shots. If we hit them, we win. 
"People saw one of the classics of college basketball Sunday," he con­tinued. "If we had won everyone would be talking about what a great game it was.'' 
While admitting that the team was down after Sunday's loss, Phelps said that he didn't need to go to any get lengths to get them back up for last night's contest. 
"It's history," he said. "Our ob­jective now is to prepare for our last six games and be ready for the tournament. 
"We are trying to close a mental gap between now and the tourna­ment. As we close out the season with tough games like N.C. State and

The Digger and AI Show 
Lights! Camera! Action! 
It's showtime, folks! And tonight we have a special treat for you. Live, on stage, it's The Digger Phelps Show, starring Digger Phelps. With special guest star, Digger Phelps. Tonight's show was written, produced and directed by Digger Phelps. And now, here's the star ofour show-

"Trying to hide from you," is Digger's comeback.

And Digger Phelps propagates that interest. 
All eyes are on the tunnel as he saunters out, slowly, 
.oks around and squints his eyes. And the noise builds and the students stand and the band p1ays and the red camera lights come on and it gets louder and l~uder and he smiles and wants more and the cmwd gives him more and he turns around and

Far from the maddening crowds... 
It isn't easy being Digger Phelps. 
So he escapes, not to the Riviera or a beachhouse in 
Lauderdale, but to the kitchen behind the arena at the 
ACC. Here he can relax, kick off his Ponies, sit back, sip 
on a Tab and forget about the pressure, the problems, 
the kleig lights.. .forget he's Digger Phelps. 
He's not alone here. He'5 among friends. Chct Hof­

it. 
And so do they. 
"Digger knows he can take it easy here," points out 
Hoffman, proprietor of the kitchen where one can al­
ways find a friendly smile and a fresh cup ofcoffee. "On 
the court he's serious and he has to be because that's 
part of his job. But when he comes in here he 'is always 
friendly and he forgets all ofhis problems." 
At least for a while. 

And that's where AI McGuire found him, munching on a bagel smothered with cream cheese, ("Digger loves bagels," reveals Hoffman.) after Saturday's _ practice for UCLA. Digger pretended to choke as McGuire bounced into the kitchen. "Where you set. Quarterfinal bouts will be fought in the main arena on Sunday, March 1, at 1:30 p.m. The semifinals are slated for Wednesday, March 4, at 7:30 p.m. Tickets for each of these car:ds are $2.00 for ringside seats and $1.50 for general admission (lower arena) ducats. 


The finals will be staged Saturday evening, March 7 at 7:30 p.m. Tickets for the finals, which will be videotaped by NBC-TV for the third consecutive year and telecast as a segment on Sportsworld, are priced at $3.00 for ringside and $2.00 for general admission. 
Season ticket packages for the tournament, under the Ie01dership of first-year director Dr. Richard Hunter, are priced at $2.00 for students and $4.00 for adults. 
Proceeds from the tournament, as always, will be donated to the missions.

TESTIMONIAL TRAPPINGS -Those of you who are attending tonight's testimonial dinner in honor ofJo and Dan Devine may be in for a long night. Some 20 speakers arc scheduled for the banquet which starts at 7:00p.m. to honor Notre Dame's ex-football coach. 
Included on the guest list are team captains from the ex-coach's six Irish teams. Ed Bauer will represent the 1975 Irish while defensive end Willie Fry will speak for the 1976 unit. Running back Terry Eurick is the guest from the 1977 National Champions while lineba,cker Bob Golic and running backJerome Heavens represent the 1978 squad. 
Center John Scully, from the 1980 Irish, rounds out the list of cap­tains. 
Ironically, the representative of the National Football Coaches' As­sociation is Vince Dooley, head coach ofthe Georgia Bulldogs (How 'bout your speech?). Fr. Edmund P. Joyce, executive vice-president and chairman ofthe university's faculty athletic board, will emcee the event. 
KEEP IT IN THE FAMILY -]!ish pitcher Bob Bartlett now has con­nections in Major League baseball. Bob's younger brother Chuck, a freshman at Cuyahoga Community College West in Cleveland, was tabbed in the fifth round of baseball's annual Winter Free Agent Draft by the San Francisco Giants. A native ofShaker Heights, Ohio, Chuck hit .350 as a catcher for the Shaker Heights High team last year.
