Food for thought. Jim Muensterman of Evansville, Ind., says that if a person can't stomach a brain sandwich, it's all In the mind. Every day, the owner of the Hilltop Inn serves up hot­from-the-skillet brain sandwiches, a popular alternative to hamburgers in southern Indiana and Illinois. Muensterman prides himself on using fresh beef brains, carefully cleaned of their membranes and mixed with a batter of eggs and self-rising flour. "Then you've got to cook 'em so they're crisp on the outside, but still moist on the inside," he said. A properly prepared brain sandwich "has a taste all Its own," said Clyde Peckenpaugh of Henderson, Ky. -Associated Press

Drug testing may Impinge on our privacy and civil rights 


President Reagan recently signed a far­reaching executive order calling for the manda­tory testing of federal workers for evidence of illegal drug use. Under the Reagan plan, all gov­ernment employees whose work is considered to be important to national security or to the protection of public health and safety will be required to submit urine specimens for chemical analysis. 
No one is sure yet how many of the approxi~ mately 2.8 million civilians on the federal payroll will be ordered to routinely fill specimen jars as part of their job requirements. Programs of "voluntary" testing are already being instituted in those offices which do not clearly fall within the domain of national security or public safety. This evidence suggests that a considerable por­tion of the U.S. population, under orders, will soon be standing in line with a warm jar of liquid in their hands. 
Federal workers will not be the first to be screened for illegal drug use. Already airline pilots, athletes, military personnel, police offi­cers, and top business executives accept specimen cups as a routine part of their lives. 
The Career and Placement Services now main­tains a list of major companies recruiting here on campus that require pre-employment drug tests. The precedent set by the Reagan decision is sure to be followed by large corporations, state and local governments, and many other large scale organizations. 
In the sports world, drug testing is accepted as the key to greater public respectability and a winning record. Mandatory testing has become the policy of both professional and collegiate teams all across the country, including those here at Notre Dame. 
Not many people have deeply objected to this sort of intrusion into athletes' personal lives. Supposedly the Interests of the team take precedence over the privacy of the individuals. It seems almost a given that the examination of an athlete's urine falls within the bounds of the team doctor or trainer. After all, the argument goes, ifan athlete really objected to the principle of drug testing or sincerely preferred drugs to sports, he or she could always quit the team. 
But the same reasoning thatjustifies drug test­ing for athletes could be used to institute the tests for the general population as well. Clearly if the Athletic Department finds that urinalysis enhances its respectability, improves its com­petitive performance, and helps it to enforce dis­cipline among problem athletes, it is only a mat­ter of time before the Admissions Office and the Office of Student Affairs get the same ideas. Frankly, the prospect of filling specimen cups for any administrative reason, whether on a reg­ular or random basis, is not only frightening. it's digusting. 

James Carroll 
Photography Manager 
In the business world, proponents ofdrug test­ing usually justify their position with claims of increased office productivity and greater public safety. We are led to believe that urinalysis will weed out those acting irresponsibly on the job. This argument is flawed in that a positive return on a drug test offers no proof that an employee has been high on the job or has in any way mismanaged his or her official responsibilities. 
Traces of marijuana and cocaine appear in the urine for days and even weeks after the psycho­logical effect of the drug has worn off. Such tests reveal who has been breaking the law but not who is negligent on the job. The issue then be­comes one of criminal prosecution and not busi· ness efficiency. And as a matter of due process, mandatory drug testing seems to be very much in violation of the Constitutional privilege to be free of search and seizure without probable cause. 
For centuries western societies have recog­nized the privacy of certain personal acts as the immutable right of the individual. The Reagan administration's decision to begin urine testing on a massive scale represents a major incon­venience with which all of us are going to have to learn to live. Apart from the indignity of being ordered to urinate for some official inspector, we will be losing a large measure of civil rights and privacy as well.

Bernard Kalb resigns post 
Associated Press 
-Former newsman Bernard Kalt resigned Wednesday as chief spokesman for the State Depart­ment over a reported effort by the Reagan administration to mislead the news media on Libya. 
"Faith in the word of America is the pulsebeat of democracy," Kalb told a farewell news confer­ence. He will be succeeded by his deputy, Charles Redman. 

Kalb, 64, held the job for nearly two years after a long career with The New York Times, CBS and NBC. He said his choice was "whether to allow myself to be absorbed in the ranks of silence, whether to vanish into unopposed acquiescence, or to enter a modest dissent." 
Asked about Kalb's resigna­tion, President Reagan said late Wednesday, "No one on our side has been lying to anyone."

Summit talks to offer nothing new for U.S. 
Well, Dallas beat Miami Vice in their first ratings confrontation much to the dismay to those of us who feel that Don Johnson's acting abilities rival at least those of Oliver's or Stallone's. 
Moving on to less pressing matters, the White House announced the dates for a meeting between President Reagan and General Secretary Gorbachev to take place in Iceland (where else?). All of this comes on the heels of a dangerous prec­edent set by both countries. 
Brian Broderick 
sincerely yours 
As everybody knows, the Soviet Union kidnapped one Nicholas Daniloff, an American journalist, and accused him of being a spy. This is not a good sign for those of us headed to Moscow for Fall 
Break. Well, as all of us good, red­blooded Americans know, Daniloff was just an innocent American who happened to be carrying a brief-case full of Soviet maps marked secret. The United States traded a convicted Soviet spy, Gennadi 
Zakharov, for the release of Daniloff. 
Apparently the Soviet Union can kidnap 
any American citizen and hold him 
hostage until the United States releases 
a Soviet spy. Obviously the USSR has 
stumbled on to something here. What is 
really mystifying here is that Reagan and 
his "no compromise" attitude toward 
foreign affairs has fallen apart in what 
amounts to an act of terrorism by the 
Soviet Union. 
Can you imagine the frustration and 
anger of the families that have close re­
lations being held hostage in Lebanon? 
It almost appears that they have been 
forgotten. When Daniloff gets kidnapped 
for bribery purposes it is a national crisis. 
It should be. However, the lives of those being held hostage are no less important than Daniloff's. The families and the hostages are being betrayed by their own government. Where is the justification? 
Now after being used by the Soviet Union to achieve their purpose, Reagan is going to meet Gorbachev to discuss arms control. My spine is tingling already. The last time these two met the major story involved the fashion styles of the wives of the two most powerful men in the world. 
Excuse me for being cynical, but recent events and previous meetings between the two superpowers have left a bad taste in my mouth. Both men will sit down and discuss the enormous amount of nuclear weaponry their countries possess. Then they will agree to a minimal reduction (if any) and set a date for the next meeting. What we have are two men who have shown no honest commitment to nuclear disarmament. Instead we have a presi­dent who is interested in leaving a mark In the history books and a General Sec­retary who is attempting to gain an ad­vantage in the propaganda war. 

What is the net result ofall ofthe activity of the past few weeks? First of all, the United States has started a dangerous policy of trading spies for innocent Americans. Secondly, the present admin­istration must have aliented any of those who are associated with the American citizens being held hostage in Lebanon. The neglect shown to these innocent Americans is frightening. 
About the only result of the upcoming meeting is an assured boom in Iceland's tourism. They picked a good time, I hear it is the slow season in Reykjavik. Will anything of any significance happen in Iceland? Probably not, unless the two ladies appear. As for me, I have a good feeling that Crockett and Tubbs will over­take the Ewings.

Women priests offer advantages to Church 
No one has ever given me a single theological reason why women should not be allowed to become priests. At best. the reasons why they should not be al­lowed are based totally on tradition, not on anything rooted in doctrine. 
Chris Julka 
in plain english 
Is it that men are better befit the Euc­harist. because they are somehow in­trinsically more "holy" than womeni If anything, it could be argued that the op­posite is true, at least in terms of or­thodoxy: polls show, for instance, that more women oppose abortion than do men. 
Does the reason women cannot be­come priests today lie in the historical fact that Jesus did not make any women his priests? This does not have to mean anything-Jesus never said it did. At most. one can only validly attribute his decision to either pure coincidence or to the dom­inant role of men in the society of that time. Not only, for instance did Jesus ap-
Doonesbury 
point no women to the original apostolic offices, but he also appointed no Gen­tiles. Has the Church taken this to mean that no Gentiles could ever become priests? Of course not. If it had, Father Hesburgh and most of the members of the Holy Cross order would be out of a 
job, and instead of being the "Home of the Fighting Irish," Notre Dame would have to be called "Home of the Fighting Jews." 
Ifno one wants historical precendence, look at Jesus' mother and Mary Mag­delene, for starters, both of whom had an active role in the early Church. Look at the long litany of canonized women and female mystics. Look at Mother Theresa today. If certain prelates are worried that the clergy might somehow become ruined if women were allowed to become priests, one might ask if the clergy can really become that much worse with women than it already is with only men. 
Some ofthe most diehard conservative, fundamentalist Chrisitan sects allow wo­men to become priests. Even the Anglican Church, which is in many ways today like the Catholic Church was before Vatican

II, has said that there is no theological 
reason whatsoever why women should be barred from the priesthood: what stands in the way is simply ecclesiastical tradi­tion, which exists because of accidents of history. If the Catholic Church could do away with many of the traditions which have had no theological foundation in the Second Vatican Council, why can it not do the same with this particular tradition as well? 
The advantages to the Catholic Church of admitting women to the priesthood would be many. By doing so, for instance, the Church would demonstrate dramati­cally that It is notjusta gentleman's social club, as many claim, but a genuine Church of God, which takes Its commis­sion from God so seriously that it is willing to constantly re-evaluate those traditions which merely happen to be comfortable at the time to see if they are indeed in accord with what God has revealed to us. Appointing women to the priesthood would be an acknowledgment of the in­dispensable role which women have played and continue to play in the Church. And this would enable the Church to show that it does not make its pronouncements against abortion and adultery simply be-

To show that I am not simply a voice crying in the barren wilderness but have something concrete and practical in 
mind, I would like to make the following 
proposal. IfNotre Dame has the boldness 
to spurn the Vatican on the issue of abor­
tion, by having Father Hesburgh get 
chummy with Mario Cuomo, a political supporter of abortion, and feels free to contradict theVatican on the issue of faith and morals, by reappointing a gay atheist as a theology professor for graduate stu­dents, why can't It take a single, simple initiative with regard to admitting women to the priesthood? The condoning of abortion, homosexuality, and atheism contradicts the very doctrine of the Cath­olic Church; allowing women to become priests, on the other hand, would be simply to break with a tradition, for which no one can give a single theological rea­son why it exists in the first place.

However, one of the Club's main objectives this year is to assist at the Special Olympics In­ternational Games which will be held on the Notre Dame campus next summer. The Club hopes to help through fund raising and volunteer work.

As international secretary, Bearby is the student represen­tative for budget and finance. t1e helps to develop guidelines for the upcoming year and works with the high school Key Clubs. 
Bearby feels Circle K is a very active and independent club on campus. "We either succeed or fail on our own," he said. 
This year he is working on the "Plus 1987" project hoping to in­itiate 1,987 more members to bring the membership close to 12,000. Bearby is also helping to revise the club's constitution to meet 1980's standards. 

''I'm going through an exciting time and can see the improve­ments," said Bearby. "You can develop your own leadership skills by giving to the community and campus."

crowned University Counseling Center (formerly Psych Services) is trying to project. 
"Basically it (the name change idea) started as a marketing proj­ect that six business students were working on last year," said Patrick Utz, director ofthe center. "They worked on a project to market the center and this is one of the ideas they came up with." 
The students originally did not plan to suggest a name change. However, as part of the project the suggested name change was determined to be beneficial to the center's image among stu­dents. 
Eventually a poll was taken of both students and faculty to find a suitable name. Suggested names had to emphasize the broad counseling orientation the center offered as well as show a navor for what students them-schools in the country," he said. He also said that the center wishes to be seen as covering a broad spectrum of problems and that it is specifically for the Notre Dame family. 
"We only see students for in­dividual counseling," Utz said. "However, we have programs for everybody. So, for example, fac­ulty and staffcall us for consulta­tion. We'd like to think that fac­ulty members would call us into the classroom to do a program on stress management or other topics." 
Utz also mentioned some of the different problems for which the center offers counseling. "People come to us to get help for many problems," he said. The problems include such things as deep depression, alco­hol abuse and advice on inter­personal and family relation-resource and in this respect the name change is consistent with our philosophy," said Utz. 

The center has also undergone some other, purely physical changes during the past year. Al­cohol counselor Peggy Cronin retired and three others left for other opportunities, leaving the staff somewhat short-handed. 
"I think we brought in a really high-powered staff," Utz said. "The staff change was not planned but just became neces­sary for various reasons. I am very delighted with our team and I think the new people are going to fit in well."

'Crimes of the Heart' a criminal success

Flirtatious Meg with her old flame Doc Porter. 

JENNIFER KROLL 
features writer 

The Notre Dame-Saint Mary's Theatre began its 1986-87 season last night with a delight­fully entertaining production of Beth Henley's Pulitzer Prize win­ning comedy, "Crimes of the Heart." 
Henley's play, a comedy, was brought to life by a small but ex­tremely exuberant cast of actors. Not a moment stood still. From the very opening scene of "Crimes" the audience was catapulted into the not-so­tranquil lives of the three Magrath sisters, Babe , played by Jeannie O'Neil, Meg , played by Holly Becker, and Lenny , played by Jenny Rode. 
Babe, the youngest of these three southern-belle sisters has just shot her husband, Senator Zackery Botrelle, as the play opens. She has been bailed out of jail and is returning to her childhood home which is cur­rently occupied by her plain and practical older sister, Lenny. The wild and rebellious middle sister, Meg, is also returning home after unsuccessful years spent trying to make a name for herself in Hollywood. The girls hire lawyer Barnette Lloyd , played by Mark Costanzi, to clear Babe's name. In the process ofhis questioning the audience discovers the very amusing details surrounding Babe's crime. 
Complicating the situation even more for the sisters is the presence their hilarious and ridiculously overbearing cousin, Chick. played by Mary Kay Sheid. Adding to the confusion is Doc Porter, played by Duane Difranco, an old boyfriend of Meg's who managed to acquire a limp during dubious circum­

stances involving Meg and a hur­ricane. As if this all weren't enough to make for an amusing storyline, the sisters are also continually haunted by the memory of their mother who hung herself and the family cat simultaneously and by a pushy grandfather who is (finally!) dying in the hospital. 
"Crimes of the Heart" is a won­derfully funny performance and well worth seeing. The actors and actresses convey the intricacies of their complex relationships well and it is refreshing to see how much they all seem to enjoy their roles. 
"Crimes of the Heart" will be showing at Saint Mary's O'Laughlin Auditorium Thursday, Friday, and Saturday at 8:10p.m. Tickets are on sale at the O'Laughlin box oftlce.

Boston wins wild one with Angels to even AL series 
Associated Press 
BOSTON -Dwight Evans' fifth­inning popup fell for a tie­breaking double and the Boston Red Sox won the battle of bad hops, blunders and bizarre plays to beat the California Angels 9-2 yesterday to even the American League playoffs at one game apiece. 
Every ball seemed like an ad­venture in Fenway Park's late af­ternoon sun and the swirling wind, and Evans' lucky double in the fifth put them ahead 3-2. The Red Sox broke the game open with three runs in the seventh, helped by three errors, and three more runs in the eighth, capped by Jim Rice's two-run homer, to gain a split at home in the first two games of the best-of-seven series. 
Game 3 is scheduled for to­morrow night in Anaheim, site of the next three meetings. 
The Red Sox bunched seven hits in the first two innings, in­cluding a leadoff triple by Wade Boggs and a following double by Marty Barrett, who had three hits, but managed only a 2-0 lead. Then, as the shadows crept across the infield, the Angels began creeping back into the game and they eventually tied it in the fifth on Wally Joyner's home run, the first ever by a rookie in a playoff game. 
But in the bottom of the fifth, with two outs and Bill Buckner on first base, Don Baylor drew a walk on a 3-2 pitch from starter and loser Kirk McCaskill that barely missed outside. 
Evans, hitless in the series, fol­lowed with a high pop ny behind second base. Shortstop Dick Schofield and second baseman Bobby Grich converged on it, both taking turns looking at the ball and each other. At the last moment Grich lunged back­wards for the ball, but it dropped for a two-base hit that allowed Buckner to score. 
The luck that enabled Boston to take the lead stayed with them in the top of the sixth. With one out, Grich singled and took second on Schofield's single off starter and winner Bruce t1urst. 
Bob Boone, the Angels' best career hitter against t1urst, lined a single to left and Rice came up _...... throwing. Grich rounded third in full stride, but suddenly stopped as third baseman Boggs cut off the throw. Boggs then threw to shortstop Spike Owen, nailing Grich as he scrambled back the base. 
Grich sprung to his feet, screaming at third base coach Moose Stubing. Grich threw his hands up in the air before slam­ming his helmet to the ground.

It's sort of like Rodney Danger­field, we don't get respect," said Lambert. "But the program is in it's infancy and the only way to get respect is to beat people." 
If the Irish continue their win­ning ways, especially on the road for the next two weeks, don't ex­pect Lambert and his players to open a Comedy Store in search of respect. They'll get that, and a possible post-season tourna­ment bid, from their play on the court. 
First, however, they must face the task at hand. The Irish will head south this weekend to face Louisville and Kentucky with hopes of keeping their winning streak rolling.

numerous scoring chances. Cincinnati on Oct. 7, 1975 while 
Andrysiak runs his way into starting role 
Notre Dame quarterback Terry Andrysiak may have been running for his life last Saturday, but he seems to have run himself into a starting role in the process. 
Notre Dame head coach Lou Holtz gave a strong hint Tuesday that Andrysiak, the 6-L 181-pound junior back up to Irish regular Steve Beuerlein, would get the starting nod Saturday when 2-2-1 Pittsburgh comes to Notre Dame Stadium for a game with the 
1-3 Irish. 
While neither Beuerlein nor Andrysiak had a par­
ticularly good day on the stat sheet against Alabama 
Beuerlein was 5-of-16 passing, for 66 yards and one 
interception; Andrysiak was 8-of-18, 90 yards and an 
interception -both made several outstanding plays 
to avoid the ferocious Tide pass rush. 
Yet Beuerlein, who suffered a concussion in the 
first quarter on a sack by the Tide's Cornelius Ben­
nett, simply could not scramble out of the pocket 
enough to satisfy Holtz. Holtz, therefore, sent in the 
smaller, more light-footed Andrysiak and was 
pleased overall with his performance. 
The question, then, is whether or not this decision 
to start Andrysiak had more to do with Andrysiak's 
feet or Beuerlein's head. Beuerlein has not taken a 
snap in practice this week, presumably because his 
head still hurts, and even spent Saturday night in 
the hospital as is customary for a concussion suf­
ferer. He has been at practice all week, however, 
watching Andrysiak and reserve Steve Belles line up 
behind center. 
"Terry made an awful lot of fine, fine plays against 
Alabama," said Holtz. "He has tremendous

maneuverability, and is a much better game player than he is a practice player. Eliminate his mistakes, and in that type of (pass rush), I think he gives us the best chance to win. 
"Beuerlein, on the other hand, suffered a concus­sion and cannot have contact. Andrysiak just does some things in football games that warrant him re­ceiving more playing time." 
For Andrysiak and Beuerlein, therefore, this Sat­urday's game may be one of immense Importance to their careers. Andrysiak started one game last year in similar circumstances, but was back at number­two a week later. Beuerlein, a starter since his fresh­man year, now appears to have a serious challenger for the first time In awhile. 
''I'm glad to have the opportunity to play," said Andrysiak. "We need to get something going and I just hope I'm the right person. The most important thing is to get the win." 
For Andrysiak, this is a chance at least to get off 
the rollercoaster ride he has been on for the past 
two seasons. Last year he played in nine games, 
leading his number-two unit to scoring drives in 
several. piloting the team to its consecutive drub­
bings of USC and Navy and even directing the team 
to its only scoring drive in the fiasco at Miami. Yet 
Notre Dame head coach Gerry Faust always returned 
to the vastly-experienced Beuerlein as his starter. 
This season Andrysiak had appeared only briefly 
up until the Alabama game when Holtz freely shuffled 
the two in and out. While that situation no doubt 
frightened the two signal-callers as much as the Irish 
fans, this vote of confidence may be what Andrysiak 
most needs. 
"Last year, I think the coaches just felt I'd be more efficient off the bench or something," said Andrysiak. "This might be week-to-week, or depending on my performance it could be permanent. 
"It's very hard to get consistency, though, alter­nating in and out with another quarterback. But I'm always thankful for the opportunity to play. Coach Holtz has to know what's better for the team, and I just hope he stays with me a bit." 
It is likely that Andrysiak will get that chance this 
time, for Holtz still talks as though he is adverse to 
the idea of shuffling his quarterbacks on a regular 
basis. 

"In a football game, you would like to have one starting quarterback," said Holtz. "And then you want another who can play. I don't believe you want to jump up and down with your quarterbacks. Right now, Steve Beuerlein is our starting quarterback, no doubt. But Pitt puts tremendous pressure on the passer (the Panthers have registered 2 I sacks already) and Terry's pretty good when he's scram­bling."
