Four years ago,]ohn Aristotle Phillips, while an undergra­duate student at Princeton Uni­versity created a' 'home-made'' atomic bomb. Lecturing before a large audience in Carroll Hall last night, Phillips emphasized the need for curbing nuclear technology in Third World councries and criticized U.S. energy policies. , 
Phillips began his lecture with an explanation of how he deve­loped an atomic bomb. By buying public official docu­ments for $25 that concentrated on the operations of the Man­batten project, Phillips said the actual creation of the bqmb came quite naturally. 
"I was a physics major of average intelligence. Every­thing I needed to know was contained in those documents. So you see -anyone can make and market their own bomb ­anyone including terrorist or­ganizations, radical govern­ment leaders and underdeve­loped Third World countries. And that in itself is frighten­ing," Phillips said. 
The 23 year old then related an event that increased his belief that Third World countries are becoming more interested in buying nuclear technology to advance their social and econo­mic stance in the world. 
''After my bomb project was made public, I received a phone call from a Pakistani operative who wanted to purchase my design for his country. It was then I fully realized the impor­tance of the bomb and what could happen if it landed in the wrong hand.s,'' Phillips explain­ed. 
Phillips said that within 10 years underdeveloped countries such as Iran, South Africa, and Brazil will have the technology to construct the atomic bomb.

Soviets banish dissident leader 
MOSCOW (AP) -The Soviet government newspaper yes­terday accused disstdent leader Andrei D. Sakharov of having "blurted out" state secrets to Westerners and said he had been banished from Moscow for reasons of national security. 
Izvestia's toughly worded denunciation of Sakharov was the fullest authoritative expla­nation of the government's action against the Nobel Peace Prize winner, who was picked up by police Tuesday, stripped of his state honors; and exiled from Moscow. 
Before flying off, Sakharov told family members he and his wife, Yelena Bonner, were be­ing sent to Gorky, 2 50 miles east of here, and industrial center closed to foreign repor­ters. Friends and relatives said

Wednesday they had received no new word from Sakharov, and they made a public demand for official confirmation of his whereabouts. 
Meanwhile, international protests over the punishment of the human rights activist mounted. 
Besides· condemnations from Western governments, the Communist parties of France, Spain and Italy announced their opposition. Commumst Po­land's government media sounded a lone note of support for the Kremlin. 
The president of the French National Assembly, Jacques Chaban-Delmas, cut short a visit to Moscow in protest. 
The 53-year-old Sakharov, a nuclear physicist and winner of the 1975 r\obel Peace Prize, had become the strongest voice of dissent in the Soviet Union in recent years, meeting fre­quently with American and other Western journalists to publicize alleged human rights violations. 
The lengthy Izvestia article came close to calling him a traitor. It said he had ''stepped onto the path of direct betrayal of the interests of our mother­land,'' and claimed in a later passage he had ''overstepped the b,~unds of the law. ·' 
At another point, the article said that in meeting with foreigners, Sakharov, a key developer of the Soviet Union's hydrogen bomb, had often "blurted out things that any government guards as an im­portant 'secret."

said only that Sakharov's public honors had been taken from him because of his ''subversive work.'' But the Izvestia com­mentary Wednesday also con­firmed that'· competent organs'' had expelled him from Moscow, though it did not say where he was sent. 
''These measures were es­sential for reasons including the fact that he began to be used a s a channel for intelligence ser­vices of m~perialist powers to worm out tmportant state se­
crets  of  the  Soviet  Union,"  
Izvestia said.  
'It  remains  unclear whether  

Soviet authorities plan to put Sakharov on trial or will consi­der the summary banishment and stripping of honors to be sufficient punishment. Two years ago another leading dis­sident, Anatoly Shcharansky, was tried and convicted of treasonable espionage as a result of his contacts wirh Westerners. 
NDPress 
publishes novella 
The Notre Dame Press has published a second work of fiction by Mircea Eliade, noted historian of religions. The Old lvfan and the Bureaucrats, a novella ranked among the best of Eliade's creative works, was translated from Rumanian by Marv Park Stevenson. 
Born in Bucharest in 1907, Eliade grew up in Rumania between the world wars. Since 1957, he has taught at the University of Chicago Divinity School.  The author's studies in history of religions are well known in English, bur little of his fiction has been translated. His epic novel, The Forbidden Forest, was published by the Notre Dame Press in 1978. It was the first of his novels to be published in English.

Social justice and Notre Dame 
Dear Editor: 
The title ofBernard Norling's column in The Observer Oan. 18, 1980), "The Poverty of Liberalism," led me to believe that what would follow would be in the same vein as a book of the same title by the radical political philosopher, Robert Paul Wolff. Unhappily this was not the case. In his book, Wolff makes a strong critique of liberalism on the grounds of its moral poverty. As I read Peter Walshe's analysis of Fr. Hes­burgh's position on the board of the Chase Manhatten Bank, I understood him to be arguing similarly '·-Fr. Hesburgh has placed himself squarely in the liberal camp and does not challenge rhe immoral presup­positions undergirding institu­tions like the Chase. Clearly Walshe is no liberal (I presume he would prefer radical). Fr. Hesburgh ts the liberal. I find similar obfuscation of language runs throughout Prof. Norling's polemic. 
Prof. Norling appears to sub­scribe to a stmpltstic weltan­schauung which resolves itself at the end into that old red baiting rhetorical question: "On which side are they (libe­rals) in the ceaseless strugg)e of the Free World to escapt: the toils ofcummunist thralldom?'' His chutzpah is embarassing. In logic this is called the fallacy of the false dilemma. Why must we choose between Rus­sian imperialism and American imperialism? By posing the 
·question thus, indeed by seeing the world in such manachaean terms--good versus evil--Prof. Norling finds himself having to defend the 'small crimes' of 'friends' such as the Shah of Iran and Pinochet of Chile, while apartheid and the Sharp­ville massacre are referred to as 
'bromides.' Surely such a 
position  is  at  the  very  least  
awkward  and,  I  think,  also  
unnecessary.  

I was dismayed by the ve­hemence Prof. Norling showed in his attack on Prcf. Walshe and liberals. Much is lost in demeaning one's partner in political discourse ro a state where one can ignore the questions he puts forth. And similarly, the tone of Prof. Norling's article makes it equal­ly difficult to hear the questions he would put before us. The bludgeon ts not a reasonable tool for discourse and certainly not for public discourse. 
Nothing can be resolved and much is obscured at this level, so I suggest we return to the question as originally posed by Prof. Walshe: How may the University best serve the ends of social justice; specifically does Fr. Hesburgh's position on the board at the Chase Manharren further or hinder that goal?

I 

Prof. Bernard Norling's edi­torial column ''The Poverty of Liberalism,'' in The Observer of Jan. 18 (in response to my column ''The Chase Manhattan 
Bank and Notre Dame," Dec. 4, 1979) has performed a useful servtce for the Notre Dame ~ommumty. It has brought out tnto _the opel! a set of precon­cepno!ls whiCh can now. be ex~mtned · preconceptiOns wh~ch I fi~d dangerous to the pohry of thts country and to ~he fu_ture of the global community. ~ts col~mn _reveals. an agr~~­..'ave nanonaltsm whtch uncrm­cally accepts th<; structures.and 
 propagan?a of tts o~n sooety. ~ow .cunous to dtscover an htston_an ~o app~r~ntly _unable to mam~am a crmcal dt~tance from whtch to evaluate hts own ~imes .. The result is a bullying mvecttve and several confu­sions. Let me try to deal with a few of them. 
1. I am not a liberal. Rat~e~, I am. trytng to b~ a Chnsuan radtcal, attemprmg, however feebly, to understand the mean-
i~g. of a b.i~lical, prophetic vtston. In_pohn~a~ terms I am a democratic soctaltst. 
2. We are told by Professor Norling that it is "the business of governments everywhere to defend the interests of their nations and nationals, be the latter bankers or some others.'' He roo easily equates business interests with the wider inter­esrs of the American people. In reality, the short sighted and profit-obsessed in·dividualism 
. of many transnational corpora­tions may be doing more than 
1 anything else to endanger this country's long run access to third world resources. 
Professor Norling should also avoid the oversimplification that governments represent en­tire nations. In many of their acrivities, governments repre­sent narrow' privileged elites ­be they the party and bureau­cratic elites of the U.S.S.R. or the capitalist el-ites of the 
U.S.A. Professor Norling ex­periences no difficulty in under­standing that Eastern bloc countries are controlled by Communist Party elites which are often manip4lated by the 
U.S.S.R. Yet he balks at any suggestion that the U.S.A. has done its level best to maintain co-operative dictatorial elites in power in countries around the globe. 
.

3. Of course the thtrd world needs capita!, but to assume that capital accumulation is simply a matter of importing funds from western or eastern bloc countries is to ignore the core process whereby third world countries generate their own domestic capital. There is plenry of evidence that western capital investment, in its politi­cal and economic impact, is prone to establishing patterns 
' of dependency in third world areas. This dependency syn­drome can severely limit the generation of local capital and maintain economic and political structures which serve the wealthiest ten percent of socie­ty, at best sustain the next 40 percent, and literally impover­Ish the lower SO percent. This pattern ofdependency has been consistently condemned in the social reaching of the Catholic Church. 
4. 
Professor Norling is upset by my charge that ''many (third world) countries have had to endure the habitual manipultt­tion of their politics by the U.S." Alas, the evidence for this is in. U.S. foreign policy has operated our of a cold war mindset since World War II, a mindset that always manages to underestimate the desire of local nationalist organizations for independence from great powers, whether they be Wash­ington, Moscow, or Peking. Our government and our corporate leaders are very uncomfortable when third world populist movements seek to control their nations' resources and some­times succeed, for example in Iran, Nicaragua, Tanzania, In­dia, Cuba, and (if only for a brief period) in Chile. 

5. 
Professor Norling wonders why I do not criticize the ''bloody regimes that are hostile to us." I have attacked right and left wmg1dictatorships in public on many occasions. My point was not to undertake a survey of .world injustice. Rather, my column started at home, with Notre Dame, the U.S.A. and the western alliance. We have a prior responsibility for justice in our own society and, I repeat, Matthew 7: 5-6 is a useful 


v 

starting point. 
6. There is a disturbing lack of social analysis in Professor Norling's editorial column. One example is his argument that western corporations pay high­er wages to third world nation· als than they would otherwise have earned. Another is his reference to "bromides about apartheid and the Sharpville massacre" (a mere 69 killed). In neither case is there even the beginnings of an understanding 
Jf structural injustice. Western capitalist investment, with its capital intensive and export­onenred focus, often perpetu­ates or increases horrendous infant mortality. rates and con­tributes to endemic malnutri­tion. Higher pay to a small wh ire collar or labor elite is poor recompense for the neglect in failing to provide basic necessi­ties for the great majority. Likewise, the massacre at Sharpville must be seen in a wider context-the ugly story of South African history involving the systematic exploitation of black labor, harsh political re­pression and a shameful record of maltreating political priso­ners (see Amnesty Internation­al reports). 
7. Finally, I am asked to declare on which side I stand: that of the "free world" or "communist thraldom." This uncivil piece of right wing politiking, compounded by Pro­fessor Norling's hectoring tone, is indicative of a very worrying mindset which is reasserting itself throughout the U.S.A. -a 
Peter Walshe 
mindset which could lead down the road to a resurgence of McCarthyism. 
So, to out campus ·inquisitor, I would reply that I. am for the great democratic tr;idition of t'1e "free world" which was s :ruggled for over t~t Genturies by those who were prepare~ to G uestion the establtshed elttes uf their rimes. This tradition is dynamic, not static and has co be renewed .tnd .someumes reestablished in the teeth of powerful monied elites who would subvert it. United· States 
... 
democracy has not been threat­ened by the left. One of the more inspiring aspects of the 20th century American history is the democratic commitment and the love of country evinced by socialists like Norman Tho­mas. It is the right wing in this country which has taken us perilously close to the ·subver­sion of democracy. 
The virus of intolerance spreads quickly; even Truman's Auorney General, Tom Clark, was not immune. In an address to the Cathedral Club of Brook­lyn in 1948 he expressed the following: ''Those who do not believe in the ideology of the United States shall not be allowed ro stay in the United States." 
So, please, no more loyalty oaths, Professor Norling. I am as critical as are you of the deplorable absence of democra­cy in places like the U.S.S.R. Our difference lies in the fact rhat I perceive a few problems in our own back-yard.

Phoenix 
Dan Fogelberg 
(Epic) 
Phoenix , Dan Fogelberg's newest album is a disappointment. Now before Fogeibergphil~~-~t:orch my office, let uc explam-Dan Hogel­berg's music is not folk, not rock, not wave-Fogelberg is Fogelberg. From such an innovative man I would hope to see continued diversity and growth in his art. 
With Phoenix, however, I would have to say that I cannot for the moment consider Fogelberg an artist. but rather a performer. He's playing it safe on this album. There is minimal musical innovation. The phrasing is predictable, the percus­sion bland, the chord progressions are a bit too familiar. 
The cliches which riddle the album 
certianly detract from the total exper­
ience of the album for any one who 
believes in Fogelberg's talent as an 
artist, but for hsrenersthereare some 
very impressive performances on the 
album. The sax on "Heart Hotels" is 
nothing short of soulful-thank you 
Tom Scott. And a friend giving Dan 
some "moosical" help-Joe Walsh-in . 
"Face the Fire" adds a whole "nuther' 
dimension'' to Fogelberg's love affair 
with guitar. I didn't know that Dan 
had it in him . · 
To be fair, I must admit that 
"Longer" and "Tullamore Dew" the 
instrumental on th album, are not 
typical Fogelberg. These two pieces 
evince some progress, butthis bunch 
of songs remains generally unre­
markable. 
The most attractive thing about the 
album for me is that it isn't crammed 
with lovesongs. Listening to the top 
selling music in this country today, 
an outside observer would judgeus to 
be a very shallow people, obsessed 
with onet h i n g :love (or two things 
love and sex It you don't believe they 
have anything to do with each other). 
Fogelberg, does not limit himself 
thematically to these concerns. Cer­
tainly he has written some truly 
beautiful love-found/love-lost songs, 
but he also explores other facts of 
life. 
"Along the Road" is particularly 
probing: 
Along the road Your steps may stumble Your thoughts may start to cry But throuf!h it all a heart heldhumble j 
Like his tJaming indictment of greed in "Power of Gold" from Twin Sons of Different Mothers, The album which was made with Tim Weisberg, Fogelberg addresses issues that are so pervasive in our society that we rend to become dulled to their critical 
nature-"Face the Fire" is about the 
d~~~er of nuclear power, and "Phoe­
nix tells us of the danger of defining 
oneselfin terms of a relationship with 
another person. 

I_find the lyrics to be the best part of 
thrs album, together with some 
strides forward m style for Fogel­
berg's guitar, but throwing in some 
Eagle's and Jacks~n Browne glosses 
do not constitute mnovation. Musi-. 
cally, the album is enjoyable, but I do 
not find Phoenix very exciting.

Freedom At Point Zero (Grunt) 
When Grace Slick left the Stsrship 
last year, I felt a little letdown. The 
Starship had never been one of my 
favorites, but I rarely had any com­
plaint with their music. I wondered 
whethered they would be the same, 
or. be able to survive without her. Yet 
I was mildly surprised; their was no 
gaping hole left where Grace Slick 
had been. Instead, the group seems 
to have matured a bit, and they seem 
to be more comfortable with their 
~usic. It m~ke~ one wonder just how 
brg a contnbuuon Grace Slick really 
did make. 

When I first encountered this al­
bum, I was not even aware of it. My 
first exposure was hearing the ex­
tremely popular hit "jane" on the 
ra~i~. My first impression was "Hey, 
this rs. P~?bably the best thing Toto 
eyer,drd! Now don't get me wrong; I 
drdn t know anything about Toto's 
music, but it sure sounded like the 
rest of the _oth('.. stuff that they dump 
on the radw <l' ·aves. When I found 
out that it rea . was the Starship, I 
was surprised, yet, it made me kind 
of curious about what else might be 
on this new album. 

!he next track I  heard was equally 
drsappoitning. "Rock Music" is the 
kind ofsong you expect to find on the 
first album of some bar band that 
eventually ends up going nowhere. I 
was really ready to give my friend 
Kl)z as much grief as possible about 
the group thathe had preached to me 
about for years. Yet, I wanted one 
more nail for the coffin; two songs do 
not an entire album make. 
But I was too greedy. When I went 
back for that third strike, I was the 
loser. What I heard next (although· 
the title then) was ''Things to Come'' 
Here was all the power I was used to 
from the Starship. I was reminded of 
Dragon Fly, and the more powerful -­
cuts from RedOctopus. Although this' 
made me very happy, it didn' r give 
me what I needed to seal my case. I 
had decided to look a little farther to 
find out whether I had come across a 
fluke 

Upon returning to school, I got ahold of the album as quickly as possible. Avoiding what I had already heard, I aimed the needle at the title track. I figured that if they had enough guts to name the album for this song, it would give me a good indication of what was going on. Another step forward Starship, ano­ther leap backward for my argument. I actually liked the ride song, and believe me, that is a rarity these days. 
So I went ahead and played the whole album. True to what I had learned previously, the album to have a double identity. I came across other songs I liked: ''Girl With the Hungry Eyes" has it all. Fine g~itar, good harmony, and a subtle ht~t that the group enjoyed playing thts song, too, although the intra drags ~nd it takes the group a while to get mto the song. 
Overall, the albums strong points outweigh the weak ones; but make sure you listen before you buy-you can't always tell an album by its cover (or its AM hits).

Emerson, Lake and Palmer 
In Concert (Atlantic) 

Many people believe the No. Nukes 
album to be the "live album of the 
year'', but I believe they are grossly 
mistaken. Even with the great assem­
bly of musicians that are on the 
album, they cannot top the 63 
excellent musicians that play on the 
Emerson, Lake & Palmer In Concert 
album. This album was recorded with 
Keith, Greg and Carl backed by a 60 
piece orchestra. 
The recordsing is tram therir 1977 
American and Canacian tours, before 
they had to drop the orchestration, 
then you probably know most of the 
observations I am going to make. But 
if you saw the triuo without the 
addition,then you will realize what 
you were really missing after you 
listen to this album. 
I was privelidged enough to get my 
hands on a copy of a promotional live 
album from WMMS in Cleveland that 
is unreleased and does not contain 
the orchestra. I expected the album 
to be much the same, but I was quite 
pleasantly surprised at the added 
depth the orchestra put into ''C'est 
La Vie'', the forcefulness added to 
the"Enemy God", and the enhanced 
variety to"Pictures at an Exhibi­
tion.'' 

The concert opens with a "Fanfare" 
that leads into "The Peter Gunn 
Theme,"a good example of a theme 
and variation on the theme of the old 
detective show, The song is very tight 
and quite impressive as an opening. 
The group runs immediately into 
"Tiger In a Spotlight" from Works 
Vol. II. This cut shows the trio as the 
super group they once were, while 
the orchestra remains dormant for 
the piece. 

Moving along, without letting the 
crowd interupt the pace, the group 
follows with "C'est La Vie", Lake's 
hit from Works Vol. I. The piece is 
performed well and is exceptionally 
clear, but it still does not match the 
studio version. Carl Palmer's "Ene­
my God" follows. This song is 
marked by solid rapid drumming by 
Palmer and the unmatched key­
boards of Keith Emerson. Keith 
shows his quickness as well as his 
accuracy, and ability to utilize his 
entire keyboard in a short mood 
piece. The song is an excellent 
example of why these two musicians 
monopolized the Playboy Music Poll 
for years as the best drummer ar~d 
keyboardi~t. They each held the 
number one spot until recently dis­
placed by Mic Fleetwood and Billy 
Joel ·.(what a joke!) Billy]oel com­
pared to Keith Emerson is like saying 
I'm as good as Rick Wakeman, or 
Patrick Moraz, and I had my first 
piano lesson Monday, and I can play 
"Mary Had a Little Lamb" perfectly 
--most of 'the time. 
For contrast, the group the throws 
in an oldie from their first album, Knife's Edge My first impression or Luc song was not that goo~ because ofLake's vocals. He can't sing a song like he used to. His timing is off and he does not hit the low notes. However, the full orchestra is in swing, taking much of the preesure off Emmerson, and really filling out 
the song. 

I have a feeling this song is on the 
album to show how the group has 
matured-as contrast. This ts the way 
the group intended the song when it 
was written. But Em~rson, raking the lesson he·· learned from The Nice (his 
previous group), that the world was 
not ready for this cross berw en rock 
and classical music, which is some­
times called a ''bastardization o 
classical music", had ababdoned the 
original idea. But now we have 
the piece the way it was intended! 
Emerson shows his total versatility 
in his Piano Concerto No.1 ,that starts 
the next side. The First Movement is 
played in its entirety and the cut is 
totally acoustical. Keith, in his tails, 
is perched at the grand piano. 
The final peice on the album is from 
a rather unknown album, Pictures at 
an Exhibition. Originally written by 
the Russian composer Mussorgsky, 
and is considered a classic. EL&P 
recorded this on M::trch 26 1971 live 
but it was not released u~til a yea; 
later. EL&P are leaving us where 
they began, with a classic trans­
formed by a classical group. 
I've heard the original score played 
by the Cleveland Orchestra EL&P's 
first rendition, and now ~he cross 
between the two. This one is far 
superior, showing the growth and 
ren_ewed understanding of music by 
Kerth Emerson. The song captures 
all the images that Mussorgsky 
portrayed in his score, but the sharp 
contrast between the electronic and 
t~e orchestra maskes the song more 
vrabl~. The contrast is built by each 
workmg both at seperate times and 
together. It is an excellent modern 
interpretation of a classic. 
The only real disappointment came when the album was over. They did nor even play "Fanfare for the Common Man" nor "Pirates." But combined with their previously re­leased live triple album you have an excellent live anthology 'of THE super group of the seventies. That prev­wusly released album is...

Deguello 
Z*Z*TOP 
(Warner Bros) 
The wait is over and thank-you. After a three year absence Z Z Top has finalfy released a new studio album, Deguelo, and its a killer. 
One of the most obvious cha·nges m 
the band since their World Wide 
Texas Tour is the addition of ''Lone 
Wolf Horns",. With Gibbons, Hill, 
and Beard overdubing their own 
horns, a new dimension is added ri 
this three man powerhouse. Z Z Top 
shows aloy nof variety on Deguello, 
going from Isaac .Hayes' ''I Thank 
You'' to an intense cover version of 
Elmore James' "Dust My Broom". 
While thes two covers are two of the 
best tracks on the album, the trio 
comes up with some songwriring 
gems of their own. "She Loves Mr Automobile" and"Hi Fi Mama" lead the list as the two rowdiest numbers on the album. With apologies to American Bandstand, you'll ltke th e beat and boogie to it ')note that when I say boogie I use the word in the originalsense ala Cuck Berry, and nor in the dread BoogieOobie disco scene). 
Give De'guello a listen and fun with it, its what the album was meant for. The blues influencethat was always there is more pronounced than on Tres Hombres. If you ever liked Z Z Top, this album will probably renew your interest as it did mine. There's a. need for fun music that's not weird and unfortunately there hasn't been alot lately. Thank God for Z Z Top, Texas, The blues, and long live Rock and Roll.

ND/SMC Students return after 
D.C. anti-abortiondemonstration 
by Colleen Short 

Approximately 45 students returned from Washtugton yes­terday after an anti-abortion demonstration held Tuesday. The trip was sponsored by the ND/SMC Right to Life Organ­ization (RLO). 
In Washington, students met with dose to 100,000 other pro-lifers outside the White House to listen to several speakers address the abortion issue. At noon the group embarked on the two hour journey up Pennsylvania A venue to the Capitol. Despite cold and rainy weather, th<: group remained cheerful\ 
·according to RLO organizers. 
"lt was so impressive to see 
people from all over the nation 
unite and participate in this 
kind of an emotional protest,'' 
one student commented. "It 
was very sincere, a sense of 
camaraderie pervaded the 
day's activities." 

The group met at the Grotto 
Monday for a send-off Mass 
said by Bishop Crowley. They 
departed for the long bus trip to 
Washington at 6:15 p.m. 
Funds for the bus were donated 
by the Knights of Columbus 
and the South Bend Right to 
Life Organization. 

Abortion is legal in the 
United States and has been ever smce the Supreme Court's decision of Rot-. V. Wade on Jan. 22, 1973. This decision sparked many intellectual con­flicts among doctors, clergy, lay people, and activists over the past six years. 
Notre Dame's concern for the issue of abortion led to the National Conference on Abor­tion which was held on campus last October. The students' concern for life has led to participation in similar activi­ties over the last few years. 
Participation in the march. ont Washington is just one activity of the RLO. A newsletter is published the last weekend of every month, and open meet­ings are held every other month. Every second Saturday the group can be found saying the Rosary at the Grotto. 
Will the Constitution be 
amended and abortion outlaw­
ed? Not in the near future, but 
the pro-life students are hope­
ful. Tom McLoughlin, publicity 
chairman of the campus pro life 
group expressed his senti­
ments: "We are hopeful. The 
amendment is something we 
pray for and we work for. We 
hope it will be realized.''

Prosecutor continues Pinto case with or without key documents 
WINAMAC, Ind. (AP) -The chief proset:utor in Ford Motor Co.'s reckless homicide trial vowed to press his case even if he is unable to introduce key documents about the safety of the fuel system in Pinto sub­compacts. 
Attorneys for both sides re­tired behind closed doors yes­terday to negotiate use of the documents, whtch ths state maintains show that Ford knew the Pinto fuel tanks were unsafe but did nothing about it. 
Pulaski Circuitj udge Harold 
R. Staffeldt rule Tuesday that the documents cannot be pre­sented without accompanying proof that the evidence is authentic. 
Prosecutor Michael A. Cosen­tino said he offered to exclude some documents from the trial if Ford would agree to authen­ticate others, but he refused to specify which of the more than 130 papers he wanted verified. Chief Ford attorneyJ arnes F. Neal said defense lawyers would study the proposal and make a counter-offer. 
Ford is charged with three counts of reckless homicide in the August 1978 deaths of three teen-agers when their Pinto exploded in flames when hit from behind by a van on a northern Indiana Highway. 
Although Cosentino says the documents are key to his case, he said if he cannot introduce them as evidence, he still will ''go forward and present our evidence anyway and take it as it comes." He said he has other

tdeas about how to authenticate the documents if Ford refuses. 
"We're not ready to throw in the towel,'' Cosentino said. ''That's baloney. We'll be around for a while.'' 
In testimony yesterday, two forensic pathologists said two of the teen-agers killed in the crash would be alive today if not for the burns they sustained. 
Dr. Robert J. Stein, a Cook County. Ill., meqical examiner, and Dr. James A. Benz, chief of pathology at Indianapolis' Wishard Hospital, testified that sisters Judy AnnUlrich, 18, and Lyn Ulrich, 16, did not suffer serious enough injuries as resulted from rear-end impact to kill them. No autopsy was performed on the third victim, Donna Ulrich, 18, the sisters' COUSin. 
Stein said Judy Ulrich, who lived for eight hours after the crash, suffered burns over 95 percent of her body but ad no evidence of any external or internal injuries. 
"No injuries were sustained," he said. "If this mishap had not occurred, Judy Ulrich would be alive." 
Benz, who specializes in auto­psies on burn victims, said Lyn Ulrich, who was sitting in the back seat, suffered no neck or back injuried. 
''I had information that this individual was involved in a rear-end collicion," he said. "I know by experience that injuries in this area (back and neck) are very common." 
Lyn Ulrich suffered a slight skull fracture above the right eye and a broken right thigh, Benz said. 
Staffeldt refused to allow Benz to speculate on how great a force would be needed to cause the broken thigh. 
Prosecution attorneys have been trying to establish through medical testimony that the force of the crash was insuffi­
. . . 
ctent to cause traumattc m-juries, and therefore it was the defective fuel system that caused the car to explode.

Cellist to solo with So. Bend Symphony 
The internationally acclaimed cellist, Yo-Yo-Ma, will be the featured soloist with the South Bend Symphony on Saturday, January 26 an 8 p.m. in the Morris Civic Auditorium. 
. At age four, Yo-Yo-Ma began his ceJlo studies and performed his first recital at the University of Paris in 1961 at age six. Now residing in New York with his family, ~tr. Ma studied wtth Jonas Scholz and the renowned cellist Leonard Rose .at theJ uilliard School of !\-1usic. In the United Sratec:;, Yo-Yo-
Ma performed with ''Isaac Stern and His Friends" at Carnegie Hall and at the Kennedy Center in Wa">hington 
D.C. This season he ::~ppeared with the New York and Los Angeles Philharmonics and the Nat~onal Symphony under Msttslav Rostropovich's con­duction. 
Internationally, Yo-Yo Ma rec­orded with London's Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and toured France, England, Mexico, Canada, Hong Kong, and Taiwan both in recital and as orchestral soloist. In the future, Mr. Ma will play across Europe and with Hebert von · Karajan and the Vienna and Berlin Philharmonic Orch­
estras.

to burden future generations with these substances,'' Phil­lips commented. 
Phillips then attacked the inef­fectiveness of the U.S. energy policies. Basing his opinion on the Harvard Energy Report, Philiips cited only two possible solutions to the energy crises: conserve energy and utilize solar energy sources. 
"We are being conned by the government. We are constantly told that nuclear power is the solution to the energy crises but only 3% of nuclear power is used for this purpose,'' Phillips said. He said this raises the unanswered question of what is being done with the remaining 97 112 of nuclear energy. 
"The same bureaucracy, the same nuclear industry, promis­ed that a Three Mile Island could not happen and yet it did. But so far nothing is being done to prevent historv from repeat­ing itself," Philltps pointed our. 
Phillips closing remarks em­phasized the fact that today's young people will pay for past mistakes. 
"We're inheriting the entire energy crises, the dangers of nuclear wastes and plants and rhe threat of the atomic bomb as a terrorist weapon. We grew up in the shadow of the atomic bomb and there we will remain if no action is taken," Phillips said. 
Phillips addressed a question 
from the audience dealing with 
the U.S. boycott of the Olympic 
games.

It's not uncommon for a team to be unmotivated for a ball­game which comes on the heels ofa tough loss. And if. the game is against a team which you have bea~en before, the coach might as well throw any hope for intensity out in the snow. 
Lucky for Coach Sharon Petre of the women's basketball team, that proved to be an u~n;ces~ary thi_ng to do.

"We've still got a couple of things to wotk on, and we definitely need Jane back, (se­nior co-captain Politiski who is still nursing a severely spraineC: ankle) but all things consider­ed, we're in pretty good shape at this point in the season. I will say thts though -we're awful tired.''

Three Irish players reached double figures in Tuesday night's victory, which raised Notre Dame's record to 8-4. Freshman Shari Matvey led the way for the Irish with 22 points and six rebounds. Sophomore Tricia McManus and Missy Conboy added 14 and 11 points respectively. McManus also 
· contributed seven rebounds. In the contest, the Irish set a team record for best free throw percentage for a single game by 
tosses for .764 percent. The old record was set back on Novem­ber 18, 1978, when Notre Dame hit 19 of 26 ('f-730 percent) in an 81-51 season opening win over Clarke ColJege. 
Senior co=captain Molly Cash­man, who hit four of six free throws to contribute to Tues­day's record setting perfor­mance, talked last night about her role in getting the team up for games. 
''Sometimes it can be a pro­blem getting up for games like that (against Valpo)," stated the 5-4 guard from Hopkins, Minnesota. ''One of the things that helps is realizing that we are a big game on their sche­dule. The fact that we are Notre Dame, and the fact that we had fu...'lten them five times in the last two years really made them ready to want to play us, and it took a real team effort for us to beat the~ last night.'' 
''As far as other games are concerned, I try to basically approach them all the same way. The team knows what they have to do and all it takes is concentration on our part to perform the way we are capable of performing. ''
