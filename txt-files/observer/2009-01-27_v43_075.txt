Archbishop speaks on religous trends 
Vatican official discusses the secularization of Europe, the Church's shifting role 
By LAURA MCCRYSTAL 
News Writer 
The influence of the Catholic Church in Europe is declining as a result of secularization, said Archbishop Angelo Amato in a lecture Monday night. 
Amato, who was appointed by Pope Benedict XVI last July to oversee the canonization of Catholic saints, delivered Notre Dame's annual Terrence M. Keeley Vatican lecture spon­sored by the Nanovic Institute for European Studies. 
Secularization is a trend in which people feel "emancipat­ed from religious bonds," he said. Secularism, a worldwide problem because it does not accept religion as an important reality, is especially apparent in Central and Western Europe, he said. 
With secularization, Amato said that economics, politics, and bio-technology in Modern Europe become detached from religion and morality. 
"In this panorama, the influ­ence of Christianity on social life is greatly weakened," he said. 
While some people argue that Modern Europe does not need to rely on its Christian roots, Amato disagrees. He said the Church has always con­tributed to European civiliza­tion. 
"Europe cannot be under­stood without Christianity," he said. "It loses its originality and identity," 
Amato said he hopes Europe will blend tradition with its modern views so that it will find a greater respect for democracy, freedom, and the dignity of the human being in the future. 
Christianity is therefore not

Notre Dame has recently received two honors that high­light the University's commit­ment to increasing sustainabil­ity on campus from Carbonrally.com and the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC). 
The University won $10,000 from a competition held in conjunction with Syracuse University in November as part of NBC's Green Week. In addi­tion to making the Notre Dame-Syracuse football game carbon neutral and increasing recycling on game day, the University also participated in a sustainability commitment 
pledge drive to see  which  
s.chool  could  gain  more  
pledges.  

The drive, sponsored by Carbonrally.com, encouraged students, faculty, staff and alumni to reduce their carbon emissions. 
Notre Dame's pledge count of 1,932 beat out Syracuse's 1,446 commitments. The win­ning pledges have committed to reducing carbon emissions by nearly 48 tons. 
Junior Connor Kobeski, who worked with GreeNO to regis­ter students during Green Week, cited GreeNO as a cru­cial part of the competition's success. 
"GreeNO members' dedica­tion to getting people signed up gave us the edge over 
Syracuse" he said. "A lot of people committed to Carbonrally allowed us to win the competition, and in the same way, a lot of people com­mitted to reducing their car­bon footprints will help us to control climate change." 
Kobeski also noted the importance of this event to increasing Notre Dame's sus­tainability, especially in light of the $10,000 prize. 
"Winning the NBC Carbonrally Challenge will help the Office of Sustainability to make even greater environmental changes across the university." Kobeski said.

Center needs help with program for children ages 2 to kindergartern

News Writer 
The Early Childhood Development Center (ECDC) at Notre Dame, on Bulla Road behind the library and directly across from Fisher O'Hara­Grace Graduate Student Housing, is looking for student volunteers for the Spring semester, according to Terri Kosik, the executive director of ECDC. 
Kosik said the center offers a "dynamic, recreational-based program for children from age 2 to kindergarten and utilizes a developmentally appropriate curriculum." 
The 80-90 student volunteers with the program work along­side teachers and assist the children with various activities, she said. 
"Students volunteer 2 hours per week and spend tims with the children in various capaci­ties [from I working on the cur­riculum with teachers, reading stories to children, teaching them to ride bicycles, painting with them [and] pushing them in swings," she said. 
Students work the same schedule each week and, therefore, really get to know the children they are working with, Kosik said. 
"There is a wide range of children in the program from a variety of ethnic backgrounds and socio-economic groups," she said. "The volunteers can choose the age group with whom they feel most comfort­able." 
Kosik said that while volun­

SMC to test security alert system this afternoon 
By ALICIA SMITH 
News Writer 
Saint Mary's students, faculty and staff will be receiving an e­mail, text message or phone call at 4 p.m. today as the College's Emergency Notification System is tested, according to an e-mail sent to the student body last week. 
Students received the e-mail one week prior to the test date to inform them when the test would be occurring and to explain what students could expect from the test. 

"We try to test at least once per academic year. We do this to make sure the system works properly," vice president of stu­dent affairs Karen .Johnson said. 
The test works by sending a message through the service the College contracts with. The message is sent to students cell phones and their e-mails addresses.

INSIDE COLUMN 

If I vvere a 

superhero... 
Like any other young college student, sometimes (okay often) I sit back and won­der what I should do with my life. I would prefer something exciting, fulfilling and useful to humanity. A subsequent romp through fantasy land obviously follows this type of life planning. And I've decided, in an ideal (insanely 
Jess Shaffer 
unrealistic) world, I 
would be a super­

Assistant Scene 
hero. 
Editor

Being a superhero is the best of all worlds. You get to use really cool powers, do good by kicking butt, and be useful to society while being loved and adored by all. In addition, you'd get to chill with fascinat­ing and dynamic (and fictitious) characters, who would automatically have to be your friend just because you're a superhero too. It's kind of like dorm life at Notre Dame. Sororities and Fraternities lite; half the "clickiness," twice the fun. 
Clearly, hanging out with Superman, Spiderman, Wonder Woman, X-men, the Hulk and the Fantastic Four would undoubtedly be a mind blowing experience, no explanation needed here. I'd even let in· the Cullen Family and the cast of Harry Potter, who all fight evil and use some remarkable powers doing it. 
Not to be exclusive, but there are some people that would be left out of the Superhero club. Batman for one. Let the huffing and puffing commence, but yes, you read correctly, I did indeed just kick Batman out of the real superheroes' club. To answer your next question yes, I did see the "Dark Knight." And no, being rich, affording an infinite amount of effective gadgetry, training for combat in Asia, sounding dumb when speaking through a voice synthesizer and having the capacity to float a slightly overrated box-office whale does not quality you to be a superhero. 
Maybe he does some pretty good things for mankind. He goes above and beyond, and therefore is a super hero, as in he is extra heroic. But clearly the etymology of superhero is a combination of supernatural and hero. So ultimately, extraordinary crime fighting does not make him a super­hero because he lacks any supernatural heroic capabilities, a.k.a. powers. 
After kicking Batman out of the club, the obvious next step would be, picking a power. If I could pick only one supernatural power, it would have to be flying. Preferably fast flying. Yeah, telepathy, walking through walls, shooting laser beams out of my eyes, being really strong or really fast and apparating are all pretty sweet. But flying is a classic. And I'm all about emulation; it lends a sense of history to innovation. 
So there is my fantasy, superhero life in a nut shell. I'd wake up in the morning, and fly myself to France for a crepe and coffee. Then, during the day I'd assume the identi­ty of a typical Notre Dame student, who occasionally writes Inside Columns for The Observer. After some speedy homework;I'd fly around, saving the world. In my spare time, I'd relax with my close friends, Spiderman and Wonder Woman, maybe play a gaV'le of super intense Apples to Apples. Finally you might ask, who'd my super special main squeeze be? That one's easy. The Human Torch aka Johnny Storm, obviously. He's hot.

Palin fan unknowingly buys effigy with noose 
WEST HOLLYWOOD, Calif. -The maker of a Sarah Palin mannequin says a would-be buyer backed out when he dis­covered its past -as a effigy hung by a noose in a West Hollywood home's Halloween display. 
Professional window dresser ChadMichael Morrisette said the winner of the eBay auction thought he was buying a pro-Palin item until he heard a radio report about it. 
Morrisette created the look-alike mannequin of the Republican vice presi­dential candidate and hung it from his home's roof for Halloween. He removed it early out of safety concerns after the display prompted protests. 
Epic snowball fight flakes out of history 
MADISON, Wis. -When a whistle blew Saturday afternoon, two teams of University of Wisconsin­Madison students pelted each other with snowballs, but the 45-minute battle won't be going down in history. 
Freshman organizer Mike Basak had hoped the epic snowball fight would break a 2006 record set by 3,700 students at Michigan Technological University, but acknowledged Saturday that the turnout at his school was disap­pointing. 
Basak guessed that 2,000 or more students showed up, but other observers put the total at hundreds of students, not thousands. 
_"It was definitely huge and it was a great event," he said.

Political troubles disrupt Iceland 
REYKJAVIK -Iceland's coalition govern­ment collapsed on Monday after an unprece­dented wave of public dissent, plunging the island nation into political turmoil as it seeks to rebuild an economy shattered by the glob­al financial crisis. 
Prime Minister Geir Haarde resigned and disbanded the government he's led since 2006. Haarde was unwilling to meet the demands of his coalition partner, the Social Democratic Alliance Party, which insisted on choosing a new prime minister in exchange for keeping the coalition intact. 
"I really regret that we could not continue with this coalition, I believe that that would have been the best result." Haarde told reporters. 
Muslims banned from yoga 
JAKARTA, Indonesia -Muslims in Indonesia are banned from practicing yoga that contains Hindu rituals like chanting, the country's top Islamic body said Monday, echoing concerns by some religious groups elsewhere about its effect on their faith. 
Though not legally binding, most devout Muslims will likely adhere to the ruling because ignoring a fatwa, or religious decree, is considered a sin. 
The decision in the world's most populous Muslim state follows similar edicts in Malaysia and Egypt as the ancient Indian exercise gained popularity worldwide in recent years. 
Cleric Ma'ruf Amin said the Ulema Council issued its ruling over the weekend after investigators visited gyms and private yoga classes across the sprawling nation. Amir said those performing yoga purely for health or sport reasons will not be affected.

Father's confession baffles police 
LYNN, Mass. -For months, Ernesto Gonzalez Jr. sat in jail, refusing to say any­thing about the weekend last summer when his 5-year-old son, Giovanni, disappeared. 
Then in November, Gonzalez broke his silence, telling a newspaper reporter a grue­some story: He stabbed the boy to death, dis­membered him in the bathtub, put his remains in plastic grocery bags and dumped them in trash bins around the city. 
The account baffied prosecutors, police and Gonzalez's lawyer-all of whom have said there was no evidence found in his apart­ment to corroborate his story. 
The alleged confession also stunned Gonzalez's ex-girlfriend, Daisy Colon, who had spent more than three agonizing months pleading for word of her son.

Blagojevich skips first day of trial 
Illinois governor opts to instead make various television appearences

Senate confirms Geithner as treasury secretary 
Despite personal tax issues, Obama's pick wins confirmation by a vote of 60-34 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -New York Federal Reserve Bank President Timothy Geithner won confirmation Monday as President Barack Obama's treasury secretary despite per­sonal tax lapses that turned more than a third of the Senate against him. 
"Tim's work and the work of the entire Treasury Department must begin at once. We cannot lose a day, because every day the econom­ic picture is darkening, here and across the globe," Obama told the audience before Geithner was sworn into office by Vice President Joe Biden. 
The Senate voted 60-34 to put Geithner in charge of the administration's economic team as it races to halt the worst financial slide in genera­tions. The swearing-in followed less than an hour later, the administration seeking to emphasize that it was wasting no time in trying to address the financial crisis. 
Obama said there had been a "devastating loss of trust and confidence" and that the finan­cial system was in "serious jeopardy." 
In his remarks, Geithner said the new administration would work first to stabilize the financial system and get the economy growing again and then would move to reform the system. 

"We are at a point of maxi­mum challenge for our econo­my and our country," Geithner said to a standing-room only audience in Treasury Department's ornate Cash Room. On hand were Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, now director of Obama's National Economic Council. 
Referring to Geithner's tax problems, White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said Geithner had made amends ­he has paid the taxes and penalties -and possessed the talent needed to steer the nation out of the crisis. 
Geithner, 4 7, served as undersecretary of the treasury for international affairs during the Clinton administration. As president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank, he's been a key player in the gov­ernment's response to collaps­ing financial institutions and the housing and credit markets since last summer. 
The ambivalence dogging lawmakers was reflected in the fact that a third of the chamber voted against Geithner, in large part because of his failure to pay all his taxes on income received from the International Monetary Fund in 2001 and in three subsequent years. 
Ten Republicans overlooked that matter and voted for con­firmation. One Hepublican, Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, told reporters earlier in the day that he would vote yes, only to change his mind and vote no. 
Three Democrats and one independent voted against Geithner's confirmation, including Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., the longest-serving senator in history. 
"Had he not been nominated for treasury secretary, it's doubtful that he would have ever paid these taxes," Byrd said in a statement. 
For the prevailing majority, the real reason for Geithner's likely confirmation appears to be less a matter of bipartisan cooperation than political sur­vival. Lawmakers of all stripes are eager to set the economy in the right direction long before voters judge their progress in the 2010 midterm elections. 
"People make mistakes and commit oversights," said Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah. "Even the most intelligent and gifted ­two adjectives that certainly apply to Mr. Geithner -make errors in their financial deal­ings." 
Even so, not everyone was convinced that the need for a speedy confirmation should trump concerns about the can­didate. Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, didn't buy Geithner's contention that he skipped paying some taxes because he was confused by the complexi­ties of the tax code. 
"They were described by the nominee himself as 'careless mistakes,"' Collins said in pre­pared remarks. "It has become clear to me that this is not merely a matter of complexity leading to mistakes, but of inexcusable negligence." 
Sen. Mike Enzi, R-Wyo., agreed and noted that his is one of the few voices of dis­sent. 
"Nominees for positions that do not oversee tax reporting and collection have been forced to withdraw their nomi­nation for more minor offens­es. They have been ridden out of town on a verbal rail," Enzi told the Senate. "The fact that we're in a global economic cri­sis is not a reason to overlook these errors." 
'The Senate," he scolded, "is not supposed to be a group of 'yes' men." 
It wasn't. Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin of Iowa lined up against the nominee, asking how someone of Geithner's "financial sophistication" could innocently not pay the taxes and then head up the agency that oversees the IRS. 
"How can Mr. Geithner speak with any credibility or authori­ty?" Harkin said. 


4-month delay to digital1V approved by Senate 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON The Senate on Monday voted unanimously to postpone the upcoming transition from analog to digital television broadcasting by four months to June 12 -setting the stage for Congress to pass the proposal as early as Tuesday. 
Monday's Senate vote is a big victory for the Obama administration and Democrats in Congress, who have been pushing for a delay amid growing concerns that too many Americans won't be 

ready  for  the  currently  
scheduled  Feb.  17  
changeover.  

The Nielsen Co. estimates that more than 6.5 million 
U.S. households that rely on analog television sets to pick up over-the-air broadcast sig­nals could see their TV sets go dark next month if the transition is not postponed. 
"Delaying the upcoming DTV switch is the right thing to do," said Senate Commerce Committee Chairman Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va., author of the bill to push back the deadline. "I firmly believe that our nation is not yet ready to make this transition at this time." 
The issue now goes to the House, where Commerce Committee Chairman Henry Waxman, D-Calif., has vowed to work with House leaders to bring Rockefeller's bill up for a floor vote on Tuesday. 
President Barack Obama earlier this month called for the transition date to be post­poned after the Commerce Department hit a $1.34 bil­lion funding limit for govern­ment coupons that consumers may use to help pay for digi­tal TV converter boxes. The boxes, which generally cost between $40 and $80 each and can be purchased without a coupon, translate digital sig­nals back into analog ones for older TVs. 
The National Telecommunications and Information Administration, the arm of the Commerce Department administering the program, is now sending out new coupons only as older, unredeemed ones expire and free up more money. The NTIA had nearly 2.6 million coupon requests on a waiting list as of last Wednesday.

recteves UN aid 
Associated Press 

GAZA STRIP -Crouching against piled mattresses in a room crammed with refugees, Bissan Abu al-Eish focused on her homework, blocking out the relentless shrieks of dozens of toddlers and the stench of over­flowing latrines. 
''I'm so happy to be studying," said the 9-year-old girl, bent over the new textbook she received this weekend when classes resumed for 200,000 Gaza children at United Nations facilities. 
Beyond being schooled by the U.N., Abu al-Eish and her seven siblings eat the agency's food, wear its clothing and now live in one of its buildings after their own house was leveled during Israeli bombardments on Gaza. 
Barnas may be politically in charge of the Gaza Strip, but it's to the U.N.'s relief agency that the majority of the 1.4 mil­lion Gazans turn for health care, garbage collection, food assistance and just about every other service usually provided by a state. 
With much of the territory devastated by Israel's latest military offensive, the agency's job is bound to get even bigger. 
Many expect the U.N.'s agency for Palestinians to take the lead in reconstruction, though its role is currently lim­ited to the refugee camps that house more than 1 million of Gaza's population. The U.N. spearheading efforts to rebuild Gaza could open a door to international donors, many of whom don't want to give Barnas money because the group doesn't recognize Israel and is considered a terror organization by the U.S. and European Union. 
It is estimated that $2 billion is needed to repair the 21 ,000 homes damaged or destroyed, along with factories and gov­ernment buildings, in the three­week Israeli attack to end

llamas' rocket-firing. Fundraising has hardly begun, and the question of how the money will be funneled remains unanswered. 
"We're delivering the services of a state, until the state is established," John Ging, the head of Gaza operations for the 
U.N. Relief and Works Agency, UNRWA, told The Associated Press this weekend. 
At the same time, it must exist side-by-side with Hamas' government -and take care to maintain its neutrality, which some Israelis question . 
In one classroom Saturday, when UNRWA schools reopened, a Palestinian teacher was filmed asking children about their trauma during the war. The unidentified teacher then told the children that Palestinians have to "wage war against them (Israelis) until they leave their land," and asked her students, aged about 8, how they should react. 
Two children in the class sug­gested hurling stones or rockets back at Israel. "Okay," the teacher said, apparently sum­ming up her class' position. "We throw rockets at them, we throw stones at them," she said.

IN BRIEF 
Pfizer Inc. purchases rival company 
TRENTON -Pfizer Inc., the world's largest drugmaker, said Monday it is buying rival Wyeth for $68 billion in a deal that will quickly boost Pfizer's revenue and diversification and -if it works as advertised -help the compa­ny become more nimble. 
The deal came as New York-based Pfizer set out a full house of issues: a 90 percent drop in income, a hefty charge to end an investigation, a severe cut in its dividend, a shockingly low profit forecast for 2009 and 8,000 job cuts starting immediately. 
That's all on top of the colossal problem trig­gering this deal: the expected loss of $13 bil­lion a year in revenue for cholesterol fighter Lipitor starting in November 2011, when it gets generic competition. 
Pfizer also plans by 2011 to cut about 8,190 jobs, 10 percent of its workforce, as part of what it expects will be a staff reduction total­ing 15 percent of the combined companies' workers -implying a total job loss ()f almost 20,000. 
Geithner nomination confirmed 
WASHINGTON -New York Federal Reserve Bank President Timothy Geithner won confirmation Monday as President Barack Obama's treasury secretary despite personal tax lapses that turned more than a third of the Senate against him. 
The 60-34 vote put Geithner at the helm of Obama's economic team as it races to halt the worst financial slide in generations. 
In swift order reflecting the urgency, Obama attended Geithner's swearing in Monday evening at the Treasury Department. White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said Geithner has made amends -he has paid the taxes and penalties -and possesses the talent needed to steer the nation out of the crisis. 
Geithner, 4 7, served as undersecretary of the treasury for international affairs during the Clinton administration.

Automakers to make greener cars 
President Obama invokes regulatory process to ensure compliance by automakers 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON President Barack Obama wants automakers to make greener cars at a time when General Motors and Chrysler are hanging by the thread of a massive government loan and auto sales have plummeted to their lowest levels in more than two decades. 
Obama's plans could bring smaller cars, more hybrids and advanced fuel-saving technologies to showrooms, but car shoppers will probably pay more upfront because the new rules are expect­ed to cost the hamstrung industry .billions of dol­lars. 
"The consumer needs to understand that they will see significant increases in the cost of vehicles," said Rebecca Lindland, an auto analyst for the con­sulting firm IHS Global Insight. Her firm estimat­ed the upgrades could add $2,000 to $10,000 to the price of a vehicle.

that one for "Alice in Wonderland" in high school where we had to prove our suitability for the play by produc­ing a paragraph of nonsense on our audition sheets) often prove, regard­less of whether one is cast, to be per­sonally enriching and beneficial. 
Having to act like a tormented soul in hell, for instance, turned out to be an incredible stress reliever. 
Anyhow, I recently went to a Very Serious Audition that involved giving one's own take on the director' core thesis (a director's having such a the­sis being of course the key trait of a Very Serious Play). The director in this case was a fellow student, and the play his reworking of a nihilistic "underground" classic. The audition monologue told the story of a sad little boy whose family, friends, and whole world had turned to plastic. The set, it was explained, was envisioned as a jungle of plastic mannequins. 
When I'd finished auditioning, the director asked what I'd thought the story meant. 
"Well, one person is isolated." I struggled for something more clever. "He can't connect. He's surrounded by people made of plastic, and -" 
VS Student Director: "What's wrong with people being made of plastic?" 
Me: "Uh ... they're not alive." Struggle more. "I mean, they're cold. They don't move. They don't breathe, they don't feel, they don't love ... " 
I think I ended there, but given time I could've gone on. It's actually fun to keep considering how many other things plastic people can't do. They can't act, they can't read, they can't cure cancer, they can't write self-dep­recating meta-columns, they can't lis­ten to nnough music to declassify metal, they can't drink Guinness and dance on tables, and, most important­ly, they can't enjoy the Magic Fountain in Barcelona. 
And they can't shift gears and

I found it a gorgeous, interesting, and occasionally cheap city with relatively good weathe"r, and would recommend it to anyone who has a chance to go. But of all the things you shouldn't miss while you're there, the Magic Fountain outside the National Gallery is pretty high on the list. By day, this is just a normal city fountain in front of a pretty eighteenth-century domed building. But for two half-hour seg­ments each evening, with the aid ol' some colored lights, hidden jets, opera, and lots of coordination, it becomes so much more. Deconstrueted the "Magic" is not very impressive: just color, music, and streams of water. And yet as my brother and I, heeding some very enthusiastic reports on Trip Advisor, made our way through the subway system and up the boulevard at the appointed time, we did so amid a huge and diverse crowd bound cheer­fully for the same destination. And another huge and diverse crowd was already there when we arrived. It was chilly and pattering rain; it wasn't long after New Year's. Still, despite the reasons to go some­where else and stay inside, there must have been hundreds of people there. And of all kinds, too. 
As we passed by a wall, two high school boys standing atop it each 
reached down to help up a female 
companion. We finally found a place 
to stand ourselves, next to a family 
that might have been speaking Polish. 
There were small kids there, but just 
as many if not more equally exeited 
adults. As Americans, my brother and 
I were in the minority. Once the show 
began, the camera flashes from the 
crowd were almost as spectacular as 
the Fountain itself. 
Nothing more than light, color, and sound. But hundreds of people were drawn together and made happy. They enjoyed the Magic Fountain. To apply Modus Tollens, because they did, and exhibited their inner and outer senses in doing so, they were not made of plastic. We were-are­not made of plastic. 
So we can bring a column back around full circle and draw conclu­sions, too. 
And while our having fun at the Magic Fountain may not prove conclu­sively that there's anything wrong with being made of plastic, it does prove that there's something very right about not being. 
And this conelusion, ladies and gen­tlemen, loyal daughters and sons, and especially veteran and aspiring the­ater geeks alike, is just one of the rea­sons why we can never really have too many experiences with Very Serious Auditions.

More not always better 
Why did you decide-to go to college? 
Sure, you may claim it was to expand your horizons, to make lifelong friends, to learn to live on your own and so on. But beyond these surface reasons, I think most students -and practically all parents -will agree that the niain motivation is to be able to get a solid job somewhere down the line. · 
As much as we're all tired of hearing the phrase "in this econo­

my," there is no denying the fact that the ideal job isn't simply going to be waiting for you on the other side of that graduation stage. But that doesn't mean that the answer necessarily lies with more edu­George cation. Washington U. 
Let me preface this by saymg that I myself am planning on enrolling in law school next year: Last semester, at a law school fair, TheGW I wandered around the Smith Center wit.h hoards of other aspiring 
Hatchet 
attorneys. How was it possible that all of us were going to get into law school, much less find jobs three years from now? 
Well, it turns out that for the 2007-2008 school year, 49,082 first-year law students enrolled while 43,518 students received law degrees, according to the American Bar Association. That is a lot of lawyers. 
This would all be well and good --someone has to fuel those lawyer jokes --ifonly the legal job market were immune to the current economic situation. According to CNN.com, the legal job market is shrinking for the first time in history, all while more and more poten­tial attorneys are crowding America's 200 law schools. Anyone else see a problem here? 
It's not just prospective law students that need to step back and think about their next move. With the latest wave of hiring freezes at universities throughout the country, the demand for humanities Ph.D.s is looking downright dismal. The number of job postings for Ph.D.s is down 21 percent, and many recent Ph.D. recipients have spent months sending out dozens of applications to no avail. Some are considering taking jobs where a B.A. or even a GED would have sufficed in order to start paying off their loans. 
So what to do? 
At that same law school fair, when I stopped by the Boston College table, I asked the school's representative what was most important to stress in my personal statement. Without even hesitating, she told me to simply explain why it is that I want to go to law school. If the answer is because I don't know what else to do, or because it just seems like the next step, I should reconsider my plans. But ifI could communicate why I feel strongly about the law as a career, it would be all the admissions office needs to hear. 
That thought is perhaps the one thing keeping me from going into panic mode as I write this column about my future career's bleak outlook. I have always wanted to go to law school, and I am positive that it is what I want to do with my life. I can accept that the com­petition will be intense and that maybe I won't make as much money as I'd like at first, but I will be doing work I elijoy. 
The current job market is about as welcoming as the Metro on Inauguration Day, and I am more than happy to take refuge in law school for the next few years while we all wait for the economy to turn around. But the fact of the matter is that more education no longer guarantees a higher salary --or even a job, for that matter. What it does guarantee is a mountain of loans, which will need to be paid back shortly after graduation, job or no job. 
At least for novv. graduate schools, law schools and business schools are no longer the assumed "next step." If you are sure that you want to devote yourself to a field, then get ready to put up a good fight to make it. Otherwise, chancing the current job market may just be your best bet.

What have you read? 
Ninety-nine percent of Americans over the age of 15 can read, but despite our widespread ability to recognize words on paper, we are at a literary crossroads. The age of print is on its deathbed, and it's not just the end for print journalism but print anything. Barring the "Harry Potter" and "Twilight" series and the books you are forced to muddle through [Of classes, what have you read recently that has been printed and bound? Editorial Board 
If the answer to that question is absolutely noth­ing, you are in the majority. A recent report by the 
University of
National Endowment for the Arts found that 53 per­

cent of Americans surveyed hadn't read a book in the past year. 
Daily Texan 
Incongruously, 100,000 more books were pub­lished in 2007 than in 2006, according to a study conducted by The New York Times. So it's not just a reluctance to read that's plaguing the industry but an oversaturation of the market. No one wants to read someone else's story, but everyone wants to tell their own. Just ask Barbara Bush's dog. 
This trouble isn't just relegated to books. Newspaper subscriptions are down and continuing to fall. Media giants like Tribune Co., which filed for bankruptcy this winter, are falt~ring. Also, according to the Times, magazine sales fell 6.3 percent last year. 
This has led to desperate attempts by print media to find demand for their supply, but the market for literature is hard to grasp. We read the fun books and award the good ones, but rarely do we endeavor to take on Mark Twain. Of the 400,000 books published in 2007, "Harry Potter" was voted most popular, and though I've read every "Potter" book and loved them all, I don't think author J.K. Howling will ever walk the halls of Hogwarts with a Pulitzer draped around her neck. 
Another cause for this literary crisis is a change in American culture. As scholar and writer Dana Gioia said, "American culture, conditioned by electronic media and a celebrity culture based on personalities, has given birth to a new kind of author: the amplified bard." 
This dependence on technology affects everyone. I've always loved to read, but I'm finding it harder and harder to read something if it isn't on a screen. Even when I do sit down with a book, by the time I reach page 25, I'm considering opening a new Google tab to check my e-mail instead. 
As long as these "amplified bards" keep clogging America's brainwaves with terrible blogs, movies like "Prom Night" and the comics in this paper, people will continue to look to them as the quick and easy enter­tainment solution. 
Hopefully, people will soon realize that this never-ending flow of shal­low news and ghostwritten biographies is filling their heads with garbage, not knowledge. They need to rediscover classic literature and credible news media that will broaden their minds, not dull them. 
The only answer I have is both quaint and simple, but it encompasses writers everywhere: Write what you know and write it well. If you don't know anything or cannot write, please don't.

ANALISE LIPARI 
Scene Editor 
Sometimes, when two big stars come 
together, there's instant movie magic. 
The inexact science of film chemistry is 
hard to find but easy to recognize -it 
takes a duo like Meg Ryan and Tom 
Hanks, for example, to turn a film about 
AOL users into "You've Got Mail." 
Hollywood legends are often born of 
the best star duos: Spencer Tracy and 
Katherine Hepburn, Fred Astaire and 
Ginger Rogers, or Mickey Rooney and 
Judy Garland are a few. 
But sometimes, despite the star power of the two actors involved, a pair falls a little flat. Claire Forlani and Brad Pitt are both strong actors, but "Meet Joe Black" was a depressing dud. Debra Messing is a solid comedienne, but she and Dermot Mulroney ("My Best ~Friend's Wedding") couldn't spark a compelling romance in "The Wedding 
Date." 
The stars of "Last Chance Harvey," 
Emma Thompson and Dustin Hoffman, 
shouldn't have this problem. Thompson 
is almost criminally underused in the 
film as Kate Walker, a lonely survey 
worker who spends her days at 
London's Heathrow Airport in a frumpy 
uniform, well-aged scrunchy and sad­
eyed expression. Hoffman is perpetually 
uncomfortable as Harvey Shine, a lonely 
American who takes a chance on a 
serendipitous weekend in foggy old 
London with Thompson's Kate. 
But despite both Hoffman and 
Thompson being cinematic heavy­
weights, the pairing never clicks. It's 
due to both actors' talent that the film 
works at all, but the result is an under­
whelming 92 minutes of two people who 
deserve better material. 
Harvey Shine is, by conventional stan­
dards, a loser. His job as a commercial 
music composer is hanging by a thread. 
Last Chance Harvey

His youthful ambition to be a jazz pianist has clearly fallen to the wayside. And his daughter Susan (Liane Balaban) just asked her stepfather, Brian (James Brolin), to walk her down the aisle at her posh London wedding. When he skips Susan's reception to fly home and nail a critical business deal, he misses the plane and subsequently loses his job. 
It's a tough situation for what Hoffman makes out to be a sympathetic charac­ter. Quiet but direct, sometimes smooth but painfully awkward, Harvey barely fits into the new life his daughter and ex-wife are living without him. It's inter­esting to watch Hoffman play with another side of American masculinity, calling to mind both his performance in "Death of a Salesman" and his iconic role in "The Graduate," as though Harvey were an older Ben Braddock with something of a Willy Loman com­plex. 
Simultaneously, writer-director Joel Hopkins gives us Kate, a woman whose friends set her up on blind dates with younger men, and whose mother's incessant phone calls inevitably ruin whatever semblance of a dating life she has left. Thompson is a smart, funny actress, and it's odd to watch her play an uncomfortable frumpster. Still, she handles the role with her usual ease, and her presence really makes the film. 
The setting of "Last Chance Harvey," ironically enough, is the character who deserves better material the most. The city of London barely appears in a film that allegedly takes place there. While the film's advertising would lead a view­er to believe that Britain's capitol plays its own part, the reality is more disap­pointing -even though Paddington Bear makes a cameo. 
The cinematographer succeeds at cap­turing each day's waning light -a sub­tle play on the film's themes of life's pas­sage and late opportunities. 
It's fitting, then, that the film ends on an optimistic sunny morning, with Harvey and Kate walking by the River Thames. 
But with a script that only occasionally reaches real heights -watch for Harvey's speech at the wedding recep­tion -audiences are left

The Actors from the London Stage· will perform Shakespeare's comedy :·Much Ado About Nothing" this Wednesday, Thursday and Friday at Washington Hall. The performance will feature actors Peter Bankole, Thusitha Jayasundera, Stephen Rashbrook, Joannah Tincey and Charlie Walker-Wise. 
Actors from the London Stage, one of the oldest established touring Shakespeare groups in the world, has been around for 33 years. The company is based in England but produced on campuses nation-wide by Shakespeare at Notre Dame. There are no directors involved in their performances -instead, the group collaborates to determine the best way to portray Shakespeare's text. They tour uni­versities twice a year and will perform at seven different campuses stretching from North Carolina to Hawaii this spring.

readings and stage demonstrations. 
The group is well known in the Notre Dame and Saint Mary's communities, as they have previ­ously perforl!Jed "A Winter's Tale, "Merchant of Venice," "A Midsummer's Night Dream," "Romeo and Juliet" and "Othello," as well as other Shakespeare classics at Notre Dame. 
The AFTLS are known for their mini­malist approach to theater, using only five actors to portray a great number of char­acters, and very few props to help distin­guish between them. Since these five actors compose the entire cast, quick character changes during the show are frequent. Their stage is generally bare, with the exception of one or two objects that are recycled throughout the play to represent different things. 
Because there are few visual aids, the audience must be intim.ately engaged in the performance, hanging on every word and gesture of the actors before them. 
This type of performance gives more freedom to the actors. It can especially be a thrill for Shakespeare lovers who pick up the hints of sarcasm, humor or irony the AFTLS draw from Shakespeare's words with just a slight change of intonation or

facial expression. 
However, as exciting as this bare-bones type of performance can be for some, it can also be difficult to grasp for someone who has no familiarity with the plotline of the play. It is a good idea to freshen up on the background of "Much Ado About Nothing" before seeing the AFTLS per­formance. 
"Much Ado About Nothing" takes place in Messina, Italy, where a prince by the name of Don Pedro and his deputies Claudio and Benedict have returned home from a victorious battle. Leonato, the governor of Messina, welcomes the heroes and invites them to stay for a month and attend a masquerade ball. Claudio has fallen in love with Leonato's daughter, Hero. At the masquerade ball, Don Pedro begins wooing Hero on Claudio's behalf, but Don John tells Claudio that his brother -Don Pedro ­is really wooing Hero for himself. Fortunately the misunderstanding is 
short-lived, and soon 
already unfaithful. At the 
wedding, Claudio, who 
was once swooning in love for Hero, refuses to marry her. 
He publicly shames Hero, who faints from the shock. Hero's family decides to have her fake her death, so that Claudio's grief will bring out the truth. 
Claudio greatly repents his actions and agrees to marry any substitute in Hero's place. During his second wedding the sup­posed "cousin" he was meant to marry removes her mask, and Claudio sees tlre beautiful Hero before him, alive after all. The play, one of the Bard's best-loved comedies, then ends happily. 
Whether you're a self-proclaimed Shakespeare fanatic or you simply want to broaden your theater horizons with this uniq'ue performance, go see "Much Ado About Nothing" at Washington Hall this week. 
Performances are at 7:30 on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday. Tickets are on sale at the Lafortune box office for $20, $18 for faculty, staff and seniors, and $12 for all students. For more information, visit per­formingarts.nd.edu.

MELBOURNE, Australia Andy Murray may have to wait awhile before he's picked again to win a Grand Slam tournament. 
Touted by British book­makers as a favorite at the Australian Open, Murray lost to No. 14 Fernando Verdasco of Spain in five sets Monday in the fourth round. He twice blew a one-set lead and missed chances to break serve in the piv­otal sixth game of the deciding set. He then dropped serve in the subsequent game and was beaten 2-6, 6-1, 1-6, 6-3, 6-4. 
All of which was a big letdown for Murray, who defeated No. 1 Rafael Nadal and No. 2 Roger Federer in an exhibition in Abu Dhabi this month leading to the season's first major. 
"I don't know if I'll be the favorite for a Slam in the next year or so after today" he said. 
Murray went out in the first round last year, the initial victim of Jo­Wilfried Tsonga's sur­prising charge to the Australian Open final. The 21-year-old Scot's bigg~st aim is to end Britain's run of 73 years without a winner of a 
IN BRIEF Steelers land in Tampa
for Super Bowl XLIII 
Hines Ward isn't cutting or turning yet on an injury that sometimes takes weeks and weeks to heal. He's not running pass patterns or sprinting with much speed. 
Not playing in the Super Bowl? Ward can't imagine it, and nei­ther can any of his Pittsburgh Steelers teammates. 
The one question hanging over the AFC champion Steelers as their practice week begins is whether the wide receiver who owns most of the franchise's career pass-catching records will play with a sprained right knee. 
To Ward, there's no question at all. 
"I don't have a brace on, I'm walking around fine," Ward said Monday, not long after arriving with his teammates. ''I'm not going to be 100 percent, I'm not going to trick anybody. 
men's major. 
''I'll try and learn from it ... come back a better player," said Murray, who finished last season with five titles and made a run to the U.S. Open final. "I'm thinking that last year I had a tough loss. This year obviously is a tough loss, as well. I came back stronger last year." 
Nadal had a far easier time, downing 2007 run­ner-up Fernando Gonzalez of Chile 6-3, 6­2, 6-4. He has yet to drop a set ahead of his 
quarterfinal  against  
sixth-seeded  Gilles  
Simon.  

"I am playing well, but 
you never know if it's going to be enough," said Nadal. who had 33 win­ners and just 11 unforced errors. 
Verdasco will meet fifth!seeded Tsonga, a Frenchman who defeat­ed No. 9 James Blake 6­4, 6-4. 7-6 (3) in a night match interrupted by a fireworks display around the stadium to celebrate Australia Day. 
Of the top eight seeded players, Murray will be the only one missing from the quarterfinals at Melbourne Park. Never in the Open era have all eight top seeds filled every spot in a Grand Slam quarterfinal lineup.

Duke AP No. 1 for 
first time since 2006 
Duke returned to the top of The Associated Press' colle-ge basketball poll Monday, a place the Blue Devils have been very familiar with in recent years. 
The Blue Devils (18-1) moved up one spot to No. 1, their first appearance there since the final poll of 2005-06. They were ranked on top for at least one week in every season from 1997-98 to 2003-04 and only UCLA's 134 weeks at No. 1 beats Duke's 111 in the 59­year history of the poll. 
"When you have a chance to be voted No. 1 at any time it is an honor you don't take light­ly," Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski said Monday. "It is not som.ething you try to keep winning but you try to keep improving. I think it goes with the territory we've been in for awhile."

Johnson injures hand 
Three-time reigning NASCAR Sprint Cup champion Jimmie Johnson underwent surgery to repair a tendon and nerve after cutting his left middle finger with a kitchen knife Sunday, while preparing to compete in the final segment of the Rolex 24 sports car race. 
A statement released by Johnson on Monday said the injury occurred above the knuckle and happened while the Hendrick Motorsports driver was attempting to cut a small hole in his firesuit in order to" feed a tube from a cooling shirt through a pocket. 
Johnson, whose GAINSCO/Bob Stallings Racing Pontiac Riley finished seventh in the race, flew to Charlotte, N.C., for fur­ther evaluation and outpatient treatment with a hand specialist at Carolinas Medical Center.

c:;ottfried out at Alabama 
As mciated Press 
TUSCALOOSA, Ala. -Mark Gottfried resigned as Alabama's basketball coach Monday, leaving in the mid­dle of his 11th season amid criticism of both the team's p' ay and the departure of a s1ar player. 
The school said Gottfried will immediately be replaced by assistant coach Philip Pearson. Alabama's next game is at Arkansas on Thursday. 
Gottfried, who played at Alabama, said he quit during a meeting with athletic director Mal Moore. 
"It has been a wonderful decade for me and my family, and I love the University of Alabama, but I feel that it is in the best interests of every­one involved," Gottfried said in a statement released by t 1e university. 
The Crimson Tide's record this year is 12-7, 2-3 in the Southeastern Conference. 
Gottfried's teams have missed the NCAA tournament the last two years, and the coach was criticized over ·the recent departure of point 
guard Ronald Steele, a pre­season first-team AP All­American pick two years ago, who later was hit by injuries. The school blamed Steele's departure on a recent injury, but Steele said there was more to his deci­sion than that. 
Gottfried signed a six-year contract with Alabama in 2005 that made him Alabama's first $1 million basketball coach and gave him a larger salary than that of football coach Mike Shula. The contract ran through 2011 and included a buyout if he were fired, but any financial terms tied to his resignation were not released. 
Moore said the school would begin trying to find a new coach immediately. 
"Out of respect for our players and coaches, I will not comment on the progress of our search until it has concluded," Moore said in a statement. 
The 45-year-old Gottfried took over at Alabama in 1998, replacing David Hobbs. l-Ie began a streak of five straight appearances in the NCAA tournament in 2002. reaching the round of eight in 2004 in the program's deepest tournament run, including a victory over top­ranked Stanford. 
Gottfrie·d hasn't been able to beat state rival Auburn lately. The Tigers have won four of the last five meetings, including an ·85-71 victory on Jan. 17. 
Ilis current team was left short-handed with the depar­ture of Steele following Richard Hendrix's early exit to the NBA after last season. 
Including three seasons at Murray State, Gottfried has a career record of 278-155 for a winning percentage of .642 in 14 seasons. 
Gottfried started 98 straight games at Alabama as a player from 1985-1987. He was known for his 3-point shooting, and the Tide made the NCAA tournament round of 16 all three seasons. 
Pearson, who lettered at Alabama in 1993, became an assistant coach with Gottfried at Murray State in 1997 and joined Gottfried's staff when he took over at Alabama.

NEW YORK Andy t>ettitte's only thought was to :;tay with the New York k'ankees. He had no interest in returning to his hometown Houston Astros. 
Still, the 36-year-old left­bander was bothered when

I guess it does take a shot at Yankees pitcher 
your pride a lit­tle bit," he said. "But when you put all that aside; I wanted to play for the New York Yankees and, you know, that was the bottom line. I wanted to be there. I wanted to play in that new stadium." 
After months of stalled negotiations, Pettitte and the Yankees agreed Monday to a $5.5 million, one-year con­tract. While the guaranteed money is less than half New York's original $10 million offer, he can make an addi­tional $6.5 million in bonuses: $4.5 million based on innings and $2 million based on days on the active roster. 
"If in fact Andy does in 2009 what he's done before, he'll actually make more money, so in that case we would have no regrets," said the pitcher's agent, Randy Hendricks. "If things would go wrong, we might be in position to say maybe we should have taken the left fork in the road instead of the right fork in the road. But that is, as Andy said, part of life and part of negotiations." 
New York withdrew its first offer in December after agree­ing to a $180 million, eight­year deal with first baseman Mark Teixeira, a contract 
that, combined with agree­ments for pitch­ers CC Sabathia and A.J. Burnett, raised the Yankees' spending spree to $423.5 mil­lion for three players. 
Pettitte met in Texas with gen­eral manager 
Brian Cashman on Dec. 11 and told him he would be will­ing to accept performance bonuses. The sides kept on 
talking. 
"It just got to the point where Randy called me and said, 'I think this is it, buddy,"' Pettitte said. "It didn't take me long to decide because I knew that was where I was going to play."

"It didn't take me long to decide because I knew that was where I was going to play. " 
Andy Pettitte Yankees pitcher 
have been able to get a multi­year deal from another club. 
"I could have made an awful lot more money than what I signed for," he said. 
He joins a starting rotation that already includes Sabathia, Burnett, Chien-Ming Wang and Joba Chamberlain. Phil Hughes, Ian Kennedy and Phil Coke are available in the 
event of InJUries or if Chamberlain shifts back to the bullpen. 
"He's going to be someone a lot of these guys on the block can lean on," Cashman said. 
The deal raised the Yankees' projected opening­day payroll to $196.8 million for 17 players with agree­ments. That doesn't include reliever Brian Bruney, who is in arbitration and will make 
between  $1.1  million  and  
$1.55 million.  
Pettitte  pitched  for  the  

Yankees from 1995-2003, helping them win four World Series titles, then spent three seasons with Houston. lie returned to the Yankees in 2007 a·nd was 14-14 with a 
4.54 ERA last season, his highest ERA since 1999. 
Pitching with a sore shoul­der, he was 2-7 with a 6.23 ERA in his final 11 starts, 
beating Baltimore in the last g·ame at old Yankee Stadium on Sept. 21. 
Cashman doesn't antici­pate any more significant moves for the Yankees dur­ing the offsea­son. He also 
doesn't think the increased spending creates more pres­sure on himself and manager Joe Girardi. 
"I feel the heat. I've always felt the heat. I've never· not felt the heat," Cashman said. "Do I think it's any hotter now than it was before? No. But do I feel it every day? Yeah, I do."

KANSAS CITY, Mo. -The Kansas City Royals stood by Zack Greinke. Now, Greinke is standing by them. 
Delaying a chance to make even more money as a free agent, 'the right-hander 
"I didn't realize there was a cure for what I had, where I just hated being around people," he said. "I was going to get a job where I didn't have to be around people all the time. Mainly, just mowing grass was my

a g r e e d Monday to a $38 million, four-year con­tract that avoided a salary arbi­tration hear­ing. 
Greinke, the No. 6 overall draft pick in 2002, was rushed to the majors 
because the Royals were desperate for talent. Often moody and uncommunica­tive, he suddenly bolted from spring training in 2006 and went home to Orlando, Fla., thinking he was proba­bly through with baseball. 
But the Royals talked him into seeking treatment for what was diagnosed as social disorder. Former gen­eral manager Allard Baird and ex-manager Buddy Bell spent count­less hours 
with their dis­couraged young pitcher who, in his own words, "just hated being around people." 
Greinke admits it was a struggle. But by 2007, 
'They could've easily pushed me aside, or helped me get back and then dump me off as soon as they could get something for me. " 
Zack Greinke Royals pitcher 
Now his pri­orities are entirely differ­ent. 
"It's just been, like seri­ously, three years of just thinking every day I want to get as good as I can get and help the Royals as much as I can," he said. 
he was back in the big leagues to stay. With a live­ly, biting fastball and good command of three other pitches, he went 13-10 in 32 starts last year, setting career highs in strikeouts (183) and innings (202 1-3). His 3.47 ERA was the best by a full-time Royals starter in 11 years. 
"It was awesome. They could've easily pushed me aside, or helped me get 
backwards to help me." 
The 25-year-old Greinke, just coming into his prime earning years, could have become a free agent after the 2010 season. 
"He may have been the most sought-after free agent in the winter of 2010," gen­eral manager Dayton Moore said. "We went aggressive with Zack and fortunately we got the backing (from ownership) to be able to do this." 
.When he left spring train­ing in 2006, Greinke wasn't even sure why he was so miserable. 
When Moore replaced 
Baird, he maintained the .same hands-on care of Greinke that his predecessor had shown. 
"Yeah, he had some set­backs along the way, which are self-proclaimed by him," Moore said. "A lot of people, and a lot of his teammates helped out, too. It's been a process that everyone's been involved with. But ultimate­ly, Zack's the one who's 
earned this 
opportunity." 
"He may have been the most sought-after free agent in the winter of20IO." 
Dayton Moore Royals general manager 
After earning $1,475,000 last season, Greinke asked for $4.4 million in arbi­tration when he exchanged pro­posed salaries 
with the Royals 
last week. The team offered $3.4 million. 
He gets $3.75 million this year, $7.25 million in 2010 and $13.5 million in each of the final two seasons of the deal. 
Gratitude was not the only reason he wanted to stay with the long-woeful Royals, who have improved their victory total each of the past three seasons.

"Three years ago I was in the minor leagues, two years ago I was in the bullpen not capable of getting hitters out as a starter. Just coming from being so low in those situa­tions to being, after one good year, a really good deal and the chance to stay with Kansas City for four more years.... It's just really neat to look back at it." 
Kansas City has three players remaining in arbi­tration: outfielder-infielder Mark Teahen, first baseman Mike Jacobs and right-han­der Brian Bannister.

1-luskies remain unbeaten 
Asso dated Press 
STORRS, Conn. -Maya Moore had 27 points and 11 rebounds, freshman Tiffany Hayes added a career-high 23 points, and top­ranked Connecticut routed No. 6 Louisville 93-65 on Monday night to remain unbeaten. 
UConn (20-0, 6-0 Big East) has opened with 20 straight wins for the second consecutive season and sixth time since 1994-95. The Huskies have run over their competition this season, winning by an average of 34 points. They beat then-No. 4 Oklahoma in No'!ember, dismantled then-No. 2 North Carolina last Monday, and now blown out Louisville. 
Led by All-American Angel McCoughtry, the Cardinals (19-2, 6-1) were supposed to give the Huskies a challenge in the Big East. She did all she could with 24 points and 13 rebounds, but it wasn't nearly enough as the Cardinals saw their 14-game winning streak come to an end. Louisville was off to its best start in school history. 
Louisville tried to slow down Connecticut's offense by employ­ing a triangle-and-two defense that focused on shutting down Moore and Renee Montgomery and daring the other UConn play­ers to beat them. 
It seemed to work early on as the other Huskies were tentative to shoot, but then Hayes stepped up and hit six 3-pointers. All

Louisville coach Jeff Walz could do was smile as Hayes made shot after shot. 
Candyce Bingham's layup with 
4:59 left in the first half gave the Cardinals a 32-31 lead. It would be the last points they'd score before the break as UConn closed the period with a 15-0 run to take a 45-32 lead at the half. 
Louisville had the first four points of the second half to cut the deficit to nine, but then UConn scored 16 straight points to take a 61-36 lead and put the game away. 
Moore, who was given a ball before the game to commemo­rate her scoring 1,000 points faster than anyone in school his­tory, had eight points during the burst. 
The Cardinals would get no closer than 20 the rest of the way. 
The win was UConn's 27th straight in the regular season and 34th consecutive victory at home. 
Tina Charles added 18 points and 10 rebounds, Kalana Greene had 12 and Montgomery 11 as Connecticut put five players in double figures for the ninth time this season. The Huskies only did it seven times all last season. 
Connecticut improved to 6-1 against Louisville with the lone loss coming in the opening round of the NCAA tournament in 1993. The Huskies routed the Cardinals in the regular-season meeting last year before only winning by six in the Big East tournament championship game.

Clem_son rally falls short in final ininutes 
Associated Press 
CLEMSON, S.C. -Lyndra Littles scored 15 of her 22 points in the second half and No. 19 Virginia held off a late rally to win its sixth straight over Clemson, 75-67 on Monday night. 
The Cavaliers (16-4, 3-2 Atlantic Coast Conference) led 53-38 after Aisha Mohammed's basket with 
14:29 to play and looked ready to cruise. But the Tigers (12-9, 2-5) rallied behind the long-distance shooting of Kirstyn Wright. The sophomore, who hadn't made a 3-pointe"r in Clemson's previous six games, hit three in a row to make it 57-52. 
That's when Virginia's two 20-point-a-game scorers ­Littles and Monica Wright ­took over. Littles had a pair of foul shots as did Wright, the ACC's top scorer at more than 22 points a game. 
Littles added two more buckets and Wright a put­back to extend the lead to 67-58. Clemson got no closer than 6 points. 
Wright finished with 19 points. Aisha Mohammed had 17 points and 11 rebounds for the Cavaliers. 
Lele Hardy led Clemson with 17 points. 
Virginia came in off its second loss in the past three games and hoped to get going early. And with Wright controlling the outside and Mohammed unstoppable beneath the boards, that's exactly what the Cavaliers did. 
After Whitney Hood's bas­ket put Clemson up 10-6 with 14:41 to go, Virginia went on a 24-6 run to take control. 
Mohammed hit an inside bucket to start things off. Wright hit a 3-pointer moments later to put Virginia ahead 13-10. She added 6 more points in the charge, including the a bas­ket with 4:40 remaining that gave the Cavaliers a 30-16 lead. 
Wright had 13 points in the opening period. She was also active on defense with a three of Virginia's four first­half steals. 
The game was the first for both teams since the death of former North Carolina State coach Kay Yow and tributes her great were everywhere at Littlejohn Coliseum. 
Clemson gave out pink cancer awareness ribbons to fans, along with a pink plac­ard with the words, "In Loving Memory of Kay Yow."

tie will determine the game. She also said freshman forward Erica Solomon, who grabbed a career­high 10 rebounds against Vtllanova, will need to compete in the paint. 
"We're going to need her to get 10 [Tuesday] because she's some­one who can go out there and compete with the Rutgers post players," McGraw said. "We real­ly need her to have a good game." 
Those Rutgers post players, McGraw said, are "bigger, faster and more athletic" than Notre Dame. Six-foot-4 center Kia Vaughn averages 6.6 rebounds per game, and Prince, despite being 5-foot-9, grabs 4,.9 per game. 
Junior guard Melissa Lechlitner has amplified her offensive pres­ence this season, but especially of late. She's hitting 47 percent of her 3-point shots and averaging

draw those kinds of fans just to watch a practice." 
The event marked the sec­ond straight year the Irish held an outdoor practice ­though the circumstances surrounding the two differed greatly. 
This Notre Dame team cur­rently boasts a school-best 20-game unbeaten streak that dates back to Halloween. Last year's squad was in the midst of a four-game winless streak when Irish coach Jeff Jackson decided to hold an outdoor practice before a series with Bowling Green -which Notre Dame promptly swept, outscoring the Falcons 10-2 in a pair of blowout victories. 
"Our guys loved it last year even though we were in kind of a tough spell," Jackson said. "I thought with the week off [with no games last week­end] it was a good chance to break up the monotony of a normal day." 
Kubik, Mark's younger broth­er, and Zach Schirtz, senior sabre Bill Thanhouser, and sophomore sabre Barron Nydam have all earned the distinction. 
Newcomers Gerek Meinhardt and Hurley have already made a splash in the world of fencing. Hurley won the 2006 Cadet World Championship in Korea, while Meinhardt joined Kelley Hurley to represent the U.S. in last summer's Olympics. Meinhardt was the youngest fencer to compete for the U.S. in Beijing. 
"We have a very strong team," Bednarski said. "There are so many factors we can't control on such a young team. But anything can happen. We are ready to compete now with the best collegiate teams in the nation."

to t:tke ... "McNeal said. "And those are shots that I live and die by, and I wouldn't want anybody else taking it but me." 
Notre Dame frantically tried to come back, but fbrced shots down the stretch and Marquette was able to pull away. 
McNeal's three was symbolic of those final few minutes of the game, when Marquette scored key baskets while Notre Dame failed to convert. 
"Getting over the hump, posses­sio r1S at the end, and being a little more poised, I'm disappointed in th~.t down the stretch," Irish coach Mim Brey said. "Because I love how we fought to give ourselves a chance to win both of these games, but deci­sicns when it's a one possession gane, chance to take the lead ... we had empty possessions that hurt us and against these teams you just ca1't have empty possessions." 
For Notre Dame, the story was the sane as it was in its loss Saturday to cc,nnecticut: namely, that Harangody needs help on the offen­siYe end. 
·r think these two games, we missed some great looks that we usually make, so you can't re-invent the wheel here," Brey said. "You hope the law of averages kick in, but ycu've got to keep shooting them." 
The junior forward provided another player of the year-type elfort -29 points on 12-for-22 shooting to go with 17 rebounds ­but the rest of the Irish were 12-for­44 (27 percent). 
"He can't do it by himself. It showed," said junior guard Tory Jackson, who finished with 10 pl)ints. "He needs help from every­bxly and we let him down today." 
Notre Dame will have a hard time b~ating anybody as long as its go-to s 1arpshooters, McAlarney and Ayers, continue their cold streaks. l\lcAlarney was 3-for-12 while Ayers "'as 0-for-7 against the Golden Eagles. Combined, Ayers and :McAlarney are 7-for-44 (16 percent) in their last two games. Whereas l\1cAlarney missed multiple open l1)oks against Connecticut, Marquette's Dominic James and Maurice Acker just defended bin) well, he said. 
"I was working so hard tonight," McAlarney said. "They did a good j )b tonight of staying with me the whole time. I must've gone back door hundreds of times. Acker and James, really, hats off to them. It's hard when you get a look and after working so hard, I was pretty tired. 1here at one point. It's hard to knock 1hemdown." 
Brey added: "I feel for Ryan Ayers .. He's in a tough stretch. He's got to make shots for us and has." 
Notre Dame's much-maligned defense once again kept it in the ~arne. It held Marquette to just 33 irst-half points and went into the ,ocker room down by three. For most of the second half, the defen­;;ive intensity continued to keep Marquette in check. 
"Defensively, we gave ourselves a chance, these last two games,".Brey said. "It's key decisions and a little more shot making quite frankly." 
The offensive woes prevented the Irish from taking a sizable lead throughout the game, not just in the waning minutes. 
Harangody, almost through sheer force of will, kept Notre Dame close in the lirst half. He had 17 points and eight rebounds while his sup­porting cast struggled to find its touch. 
Harangody used every weapon in his arsenal to score on the Golden Eagles. He hit a 3-pointer to give the Irish an early lead. With Notre Dame down seven, he hit a fade­away jumper from the corner with the shot clock expiring to keep Marquette from getting a bigger lead. 
That trend continued in the sec­ond half, when Harangody went to the fade-away multiple times to try and bail out his teanJmates. 
Even when Notre Dame ....did get a spark, in the form of two second­half 3-pointers from junior guard Jonathan Peoples, and got the crowd on its feet, the Golden Eagles responded. Notre Dame never scored more than five consecutive points the entire second half. 
Contrary to Harangody, McNeal had help. James finished with 15 points (and nine rebounds), Lazar Hayward had 13 and Wesley Matthews had 16. Tory Jackson was the only other Notre Dame player in double figures (10 points). 
Notre Dame is now staring a 3-6 Big East record in the face, as it travels to 6-1 Pittsburgh on Saturday. 
Note: 
+ Brey shook up the starting lineup Monday, as he replaced Ayers and the struggling Zach Hillesland with Peoples and Luke Zeller. Zeller contributed eight points and eight rebounds. Hillesland played only 11 minutes, due in part to a sprained ankle, Brey said. Tyrone Nash also saw his first significant minutes in Big East play. He played eight min­utes, and grabbed two rebounds.

man season picking up a first­team All-Big East award along the way. Imagine what Ryan Ayers and Zach Hillesland must be going through. 
For Ayers, the basket must look pretty small right now. The senior sharpshooter, who's still above 40 percent for 3-point field goals on the season, has hit one of his last 17 shots. He's not missing badly. A lot of those looks are a quarter-inch too long or to the right, but they're enough to leave Ayers wonder­ing what he has to do to make a basket. 
As for Hillesland, it must seem like ages since he made some­thing positive happen around the basket. You can't fault his aggression. Against Connecticut, he nearly brought the house down in the first half, but his put-back slam rattled out. 
Coming off the bench against Marquette, one of his first touches was a strong drive where two Marquette defenders nearly clothes-lined him as he elevated. No call. And nothing to feel good about for the senior

who has scored exactly eight points during Notre Dame's four-game losing streak. 
So where does that leave the Irish? Luke Harangody put it best after Monday's game. 
"We're going to find out if our guys are men right now." 
To translate, Notre Dame's next opponent isn't Pittsburgh. Before the Irish ever set foot in the Petersen Events Center Saturday, they're going to have to battle themselves. 
McAlarney is going to have to resist putting extra pressure on himself to hit every one of his few precious op.en looks. Ayers must resist the temptation to return to the passive offensive role he played during his first few seasons in South Bend. Hillesland needs to believe that the next time he attacks the basket will be the time he fin­ishes strong or at least gets that seemingly elusive whistle. 
And the Irish as a team need to do a collective mental check­up. After getting punched in the mouth four consecutive games, do they still believe they're on par with the upper-echelon of Big East teams? There was a lot of bewilderment in the players' voices following Monday's game. 
Yet this is one area to feel confident about as an Irish fan. 

Notre Dame isn't the biggest team. Th.ey're not the fastest. And they're certainly not the most athletic. What the Irish do have, however, is team chem­istry. Every major contributor in the Irish rotation has been in South Bend for at least two-plus seasons, and they genuinely like playing with each other. 
That may not seem like it counts for much in the midst of a depressing four game losing streak, but it's just what the players need right now. 
It's what will help Ayers' shooting return to form. And McAlarney's. It will help Hillesland remember what he can do on the inside. And it will help Notre Dame head to Pittsburgh this Saturday with a sense of opportunity .instead of dread. 
The Irish don't have much of a choice. Responding to this adversity in any other way will push this season, teetering right on the brink, right over the edge.

A third No. 1 tean1 in the n1ix: men's fencers 
By MICHAEL BLASCO Spores Writer 
Despite graduating one of the most outstanding senior classes in the nation, the Irish feneers haven't missed a beat. 
The Notre Dame men's squad opened the season ranked No. 1 and the women's squad No. 2 in the nation in the first U.S. Fencing Coaches' Association poll of the spring. The men's team joins the women's soccer and men's hockey teams as Irish teams ranked first in the nation this year. 
Notro Dame head coach Janusz Bednarski, who has guided Irish teams to two national championships in his seven years with the program, said that he doesn't put much stock in polls. 
"It's very hard for coaches to predict Iresults I." Bednarski said. ''I've been in this business for so long. There are so many factors we can't control, espe­cially on such a young team. But anything can happen if we make it to the Bloody Four." 
The Irish men are tied for first with Penn State, ahead of Ohio State, Columbia and Princeton in the men's top-five. In the women's poll, Notre Dame trails first-place Penn State; Ohio State, Columbia­Barnard and Harvard round out the women's top-live. 
The Irish, who return 12 All­Americans, feature prodigious talent in both the women's and men's squad. All-Americans junior Kelley Ilurley, her older sister of Courtney and sopho­more Sarah Borrmann earned the mantle of NCAA Champion in epee and sabre, respectively, while sophomore epeeist Ewa
