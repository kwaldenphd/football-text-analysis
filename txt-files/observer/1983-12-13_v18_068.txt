The Kuwaiti news agency said several people were arrested in con­nection with the bombings, but did not elaborate. The news agency said five people died and 61 were injured and that no Americans had been killed or seriously wounded. 
Witnesses and hospital sources said it was about 9:30a.m. ( 1:30 a.m. EST) when the six-wheel truck smashed through the main gate of the U.S. Embassy compound and blew up in a parking lot.

Christmas in college 
It's beginning to look like Christmas here in Notre Dame, Indiana. But not much. 
It's not easy to get into the Christmas spirit when six inches ofprecipitation on the ground outside serve on­ly to remind you why they named this place duLac.

It's hard to be festive when most of the green decora­tions on dorm walls arc administrative directives detailing the hazards ofdecorative evergreens. 
College life does not always make for the most memorable of yuletide experiences. Between fighting the clock to get your last papers done, fighting your eyelids to stay awake in class after an all-nighter, and fighting the throngs at University Park so you'll have something to wrap up at home on December 24, there's not a lot of time left for a festive atmosphere.

Compensation for government meiDbers 'hot topic' for Senate 
ByJOSEPH MURPHY 
StaffReporter 
Calling compensation for student government members the "new hot topic" before the Student Senate, Student Body Presid<:nt Brian Cal­laghan said, "If we took compensa­tion, we would not be the only ones. I think something is needed. Government activities take a lot of work, and alot of time." 
Senate members advocating monetary compensation said many students choose not to hold office in government because they cannot af. ford the loss oftime or income, since they cannot hold a job during their term in office. 
Callaghan said financial com­pensation "has its plusses, but it also has its major drawbacks." 
"I don't like the idea ofbuying ac­cou'!ltability," said off-campus stu­dent senator Rich Spolzino. "Ifwe're goin,g to pay people fmancially, we stand'the risk of people doing it just for the money." 
t. 
The senate is considering other forms of compensation such as scholarships and class credit for service. Senators Dave MeAvoy and Rob Bertino joint!)' said, "We firmly back acedemic credit as a viable al­ternative. Its is a plus for the student body and for the student govern­ment officials becuase it gives them more time to do their governmental duties. And by reducing one's academic workload, one can still hold a job to support himself finan­cially. Thus the need for financial compensation would be eliminated." McAvoy added, "With the academic credit, no one loses, and everyone gains." 
Callaghan said a decision on what, ifany, compensation will be enacted will not be made until after break. 
Any form of compensation will not take effect until after the current student government officials have left office, Callaghan stressed. 
Discussing the recurring issue of the alcohol policy on campus, Cal­

laghan said, "The idea of a dry campus is not being considered strongly. If the problem is with drunkeness, why not gear it towards the drunks. A lot ofpeople can drink responsibly. And I don't think a 21 (year drinking age limit) campus would be effective either. It would send drinking into the closets. The problem won't have been solved, 
merely hidden." 
Robert Bertino, who is on the Senate Alcohol Policy Committee said, "If you're not allowed to drink here, then you have to face the world in four years without the help available here." He cited psychologi­cal services, rectors, and peer guidance as supports which instill the importance of drinking in moderation. 
"The problem," added McAvoy, "lies not with the students, but with the ones who abuse alcohol. They should be treated strongly, not the entire student body.

In responst· to Mr. Lordi's ktter that ap­

complaints on ky sitkwalks, I have a sugges­
tion. 

It would put to usc the expensive Zamboni 
machint· in tht· ACC. much neglcdcd sinct· 
till' tkath of tht· hockey program. 

Each morning, hdi>rt' studt·nts rise, tht· grounds crt·w would simply smooth the icc, and the administration would provide itT skatt·s. Wt· would have not only a mort· sure­footnl way to travt·rse tht· campus, hut the ad­ministration would offer a valuahk servitT to studt·nts and fat·uity alike. 
Tht· propost:d program would replace tht· need li>r freshman physical education, would provide free skating timt· to all studt·nts and would ~·nable hockt·y players mort· time on "tht· itT." Pl'fhaps upon seeing this new found intt·rcst in skating. the administration would rt·turn htll'kcy to varsity status. 
But aside from thcst·, the m,-rt· lat·t that such a program would enable us to travel safe­ly, quickly and enjoyably across campus, with· out the fears of humiliating and dangerous falls, makes it a worthy considerat;on.

Integrated dorms 
Dear Editor: 

In Margaret fosmoe's article on the Saint Mary's housing changes, Dec. 6, sht· says that bccaust· the integrated dorms at Notre Dame work so wdl, it is surprising Saint Mary's has not integrated the system sooner. Saint Mary's is not Notre Dame in any way. There is no reason why Margaret, who enee was a Saint Mary's student, shou!d think Saint Mary's would do what Notre Dame has already done. 
Even though the two schools shart· very much, they also are very different I am sure Saint Mary's has good reasons for wanting the dorms to be integrated by all classes and in what manner it is achieved is up to the stu­dents and administration. Saint Mary's will not and should not do it just because Notre Dame did.

missiles. Instead, it means the premeditated 
use of long-range nuclear missiles. 
Isolated conventional wars, as in Iraq and Iran, and in lebanon, account for senseless bloodshed, political t:pheaval and unneces· sary civilian casualties. Conventional wars, especially in isolated confrontations, have been taking place for the past millennium. 
Though the names of the countries have changed and peace treaties have been signed, the carnage still goes on. Even today, govern­ments disregard peace treaties and show no o;ncern for the loss ofhuman lives when they feel that they have something to gain from the military actions 
America follows two means of preventing conventional war: diplomacy and interven­tion. Using Lebanon [san example, diplomacy has been nt·arly worthless in preventing bloodshed. Intervention has not only be•.:n un­successful, but has accounted for hundreds of lives. If a third means, the use of nuclear weapons, were utilized there would be no un­successful diplomacy and unnecessary loss of American lives. 
With the United States' nuclear missiles capable ofaccurately striking any target in the world, and the modern computer deployment systems capable of being programmed for any desirable target, there i~"oo ~f!JUntry on earth that could disregard a peace ultimatum. 
This means that in the event of any form of military skirmish, the United States would issue a peace ultimatum declaring that the fighting stop within 48 hours or the warring factions will suffer nuclear devastation. In a sense, the United States will force countries to settle their disputes peacefully.

The first countries not to heed the ul­timatum will become an example for the rest of the world. Certainly, a few lives would be lost, but the destruction of two warring countries can hardly compare with another millenium of senseless bloodshed. Although nuclear weapons give mankind the ability to extinguish the human race, they also give us the capability ofworld peace. 
Within the past 40 years America has become an influential world force, with this influence comes the responsibility of insuring world peace. It has been successful in sowe parts of the world while other parts teeter ~n the brink ofwar. Through the developmcnf'of nuclear weapons, the United States has c'he capability and responsibility ofcreating world peace by eradicating warring countries. We should take full advantage ofthat capability. 

While observing and parllnpating in the libl'fal-conscrvative debate on this campus I felt frustrated -the dcball is a stale one that has become all too pn.:dictable and un­productive.

Guest column 
<:onservativt·s complain about simplc­mindt·d idealists, bleeding hearts who cannot accomplish anything because their programs offer no incentives to pt:ople. libt:rals attack 
t'onservatives  for  their  heartlessness,  their  
rckntlcss drive  for  profitmaking and  their  
dog-cat-dog philosophy.  

The little dt·batc going on at this campus is only a small t·xample of the debate that has raged fl.1riously in our nation's politics. The controversy is wrought over the conflict ht·­twn·n the rights of the individual, especially that of economic freedom and the desire to havt· government insurt· a more equitable dis­tribution of the community's resources. Conservatives rdgncd during the laissez­
faire Guilded Age in the 19th century, during the Hoover-Coolidge years and now under the present Reagan Administration. Liberals had their heydays during the New Deal and Great Society eras of FOR, JFK and LBJ. This campus was active during the late 60s and ear­ly 70s, but has been complacent since. 
No group has done more for the liberals and conservatives than their opponents: each fac­tion capitalizes on the failures and mistakes of the other to legitimize their position. Liberals can use the excesses of unregulated big­business or government ignorance of a wdfare safety net (unfair labor practices, price-fixing, unjust income distributions, defective products and poverty) as evidence of the evil character of the unrestrained private sector. 
Liberals have their own list of mistakes. The ballooning growth and cost of the welfare state, the failures ofbusing and affirmative ac­tion and lower productivity ofsocialism serve to justify the anti-liberal position. 
The battle also has been waged in foreign policy. Morality and human rights are up against national security and anti­communism. Both sides at one time or anoth· er have advocated isolationism and interventionism. 
One is considered soft on communism, the other is accused of supporting dictacorships. These views of the Soviet Union reflect the debate that is carried on within the United States. One view calls for increased arma­ments to assert U.S. will and strength. The other calls for cooperation and better 
diplomacy. 

The debate continues while the problems that face us become ever more difficult to solve and increasingly severe. Our Congress is no longer interested in implementing in­novative policies. Instead it creates commit­tees to study problems. 
Last summer when figures indicated that IS percent of American people are living at or below the poverty line, President Reagan ap­pointed a commission to find out why, rather than implementing relief measures. Republicans and Democrats, liberals and con­servatives, are locked into a debate. Each side is convinced that the other's policies arc detrimental to the national good and threaten people's freedoms. 
As a community of scholars and Christians, 
how do we relate to this debate? Are we just a 
part ofit on a smaller scale? I hope that people at Notre Dame are not paralyzed by their con­tempt for conservatism or disdain for liberalism. I hope we have not committed our­selves to the debate rather than solving the problems the human race must overcome. 
As a Christian community, we are called to be an example ofwhat is possible. Faced with unprecedented threats to the human race and to the environment, the world faces a crisis. We must become involved, we must be active in solving the difficulties. 
Part of Christianity is humiltity; we should recognize that our opinions arc imperfect and inadequate for understanding our world. Neit · her liberalism or conservatism are insufficient responses. Humility should teach us to recognize our need to work with and depend on each other. There must be a willingness to enter into dialogue. The urgency of the human crisis should shake us from tenaciously holding on to our own solutions and rigid at­
1
titudes. 
As Christians we need to ask ourselves wflat we are committed to? liberalism or comi~r­vatism? to continuing the argument? Or are we actively committed to Christ's command· ment to love one another? As we regard politics, where arc our hearts?

' Broncos get into playoffs 
Elway leads second half c.omeback 
Associated Press 
DENVER -It should have been an ideal situation. The Cleveland Browns and Buffalo Bills had lost, and tht: Dcnvt:r Broncos entered the locker room at halftime knowing that a victory over Baltimort: would ensure tht:m ofa berth in the Nation­al Football League playoffs. 
The only problem was that Den­ver had been terrible in the first half, gt:tting only four first downs and 84 total yards and trailed the Colts, 16­
0. Rookie quarterback John Elway, who had played his best game as a pro a wt:ck carlit:r, was ineffective in the first half Sunday. He had com­pkted 7 of 14 pasSt:s, hut had been sacked three times and fumbled once at the Colts' 2-yard line. 
It got worse after three quarters, the Colts extending their lead to 19­0. 
Fans began leaving the stadium. Those who remained booed Elway after each incomplete pass. They booed Coach Dan Reeves when the stadium scoreboard flashed an ad-vertiSt:ment for his Monday night television program. 
"There weren't a lot ofpeople late in the third quarter who thought we could win," said Reeves. 
Those people underestimated EI­way, the first player selected in this year's NFL draft. In the final II minutes, Elway fired three touch­down passes, rallying the Broncos to a 2 I-I9 victory that put them into the playoffs for the first time since 1979. 
Elway finished with 23 comple­tions in 44 attempts for 345 yards, three touchdowns, no intercep­tions. 

"John Elway can put points on the hoard faster than it can add them up," said veteran Denver linebacker Tom jackson. 
"I've seen this before," said Reeves. "Roger Staubach (ofthe Dal­las Cowboys) got his reputation that way with great comebacks, and Dan­ny White did it after him. Now, our team is never really out of a game. 
Schnellenberger denies he's going to the pros 
A.!isoclated Press 
CORAL GABLES, Fla. -University of Miami Coach Howard Schnellen­hcrgcr yesterday denied reports that he was leaving for a head coaching job ir. pro football, saying he'd be "happy to retire" here. 
Television analyst Jimmy "The Greek" Snyder said on CBS Sunday that Schnellcnbcrgcr had been ap­proached by the National Football League's New York Giants, but that he had an agreement to go to the New Jersey Generals of tht: United States Football League. 
S<:hndlenbcrgcr, whose fifth­ranked Hurricanes will face No. I Nebraska in the Orange Bowl on jan. 2, said it never got to that point, al­though those teams and several others had contacted him. 
"After listening to them, I told them that my desire was to move this football program along and try to win the national championship," said Schncllenbcrgcr, age 48. 
''I'm very flattered that everybody thinks I'm qualified to coach any kind of foothallteam in America. It beats tht· alternative. But I sure wish thcSt: things were done in a more professional manner so they wouldn't run the risk of upsetting 
my football team before their big­gest game ever." 
Snyder said Schnellcnbergcr, who has three years left on his contract at Miami, had met with Generals' owner Donald Trump. Schnellen­

even ea~icr time against the Big Red, who suffer a substantial height disad­vantage. 
The main Irish inconsistency has been in the backcourt. Withjoe Buc­hanan unable to play until january due to tendonitis in his knee, Dan Duff must take the reins as the floor leader. joSt:ph Price and Scott Hicks also need to boost their confidence by taking more perimeter shots tonight. 
Notre Dame coach Digger Phelps sees his team overcoming the shoot­ing drought that has plagued the berger made a trip to New York last week to help promote the jan. 2 Orange Bowl game, in which his 10­I Hurricanes will face unbeaten Nebraska 

Last year, Schnellenberger rejected an offer to be the head coach at the University ofKentucky, his alma mater. 
Trump issued a statement saying that Schnellenberger was not a can­didate and that he hoped to name a new Generals' coach within two weeks. 
Walt Michaels, former coach of \,tic NFI..'!i..Nt:w. ~rk Jfts,...ill\u .was 
reported to be under consideration as a replacement for Chuck Fair­hanks as Generals' coach. 
Snyder said that the Giants, 3-II­

Schncllenbcrgcr has a 40-16 record during his five seasons at Miami. He coached the Baltimore Colts during the I973 and I974 seasons before being fired by owner Robert Irsay. He worked as an assis­tant with the NFL's Miami Dolphins before taking the head job with the Hurricanes. 
Trump tried to hire Don Shula away from the Dolphins earlier this year, but Shula recently signed an extension ofhis contract as coach of the NFL team. Shula broke off con­tacts with Trump after the Generals' owner discussed the negotiations on national television.

Irish since the opening game. The team has shot at a .485 clip for the last two games. Although that is not a phenomenal percentage, it is better than what Irish fans have seen so far. Free throw percentage has dropped as oflate, dipping below 60 percent for the season. To be a better team, Notre Dame obviously must hit more of their shots. 
Tonight, the Irish ba~ketball team will be trying to improve upon its 4­3 record and win its second game this season over a team with a better than .500 record (sound familiar?) -the first was St. joseph's. 

They know they can always come back." 
Elway performed his magic despite his rocky start, despite the adverse fan reaction, despite having to throw into a defense that knew he had to throw, and despite the taunts of Baltimore defensive players, including linebacker Johnic Cooks, who kept telling Elway, "I'm gonna get you." 
Elway was drafted by Baltimore but refused to play there and even­tually was traded to Denver, trigger­ing the ire ofColts' players, fans, and owner Robert lrsay, who had hurled veiled threats of bodily harm at the rookie. 
Elway viewed the outcome as a bit of vindication for the only knock against him in college; he had never played for a winning team. "After all those people talked about how we (Stanford) never played in a howl game, it's nice to make the playoffs my frrst year," he said. 
"Everybody hung together and fought back," Elway said. "I knew we had plenty of time. I'm a com­petitor."

Holmes says he's people's champ 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK -Larry Holmes, who has given up the World Boxing Council heavyweight title, said yes­terday, "I am a people's champion, and I'll continue to be as long as I fight." 
And that won't be for more than two fights, Holmes said in a telephone interview from his home in Easton, Pa_, the day after he gave up the WBC title on the final day of that organization's convention at Las Vegas, Nev. 
"My main goal is to fight Gerrie Coetzee (the World Boxing Associa­tion champion from South Africa) and retire," said Holmes. 

ferencs with King. Then Holmes relinquished the title, which he won on a I 5-round split decision over Ken Norton June 9, 1978, and defended I 7 times. 
Page and No. 2-ranked Tim Wit­herspoon reportedly will fight for the vacant title on Feb. 24 at a site to be determined. 
Holmes said yesterday that while he was not tied in any way to King, who has a promotional agreement with Coetzee, he would fight the South African for King "if we can reach a fair agreement ..." 
And while saying a fight against Coetzee would be his last, Holmes

"But It takes a while to put tog~m­
er a Coetzee fight. I'd like to defend 
my IBF title one time." 
While he considers himuelf the people's champion, the unbeaten Holmes said he also would fight as champion of the fledgling Interna­tional Boxing Federation, with head­quarters at Newark, N.J. According to Arch Hindman, the IBFs ex­
ecutive secretary, the group has three foreign members the Philippines, Japan, and Korea-and efforts are being made to attract more. 
"Bob Lee (the president) told me the IBF would recognize me as champion," Holmes said. "I'll fight anybody the IBF asks me to as long as it is fea.~ible. The whole thing is busi­ness." 
"I think I did the right thing," Holmes said ofhis decision to resign as WBC champion. 
"(Promoter) Don King and I couldn't come up with an agree­.nent. King wouldn't let the Page fight out for bids." 
Holmes had a contract with King to make a mandatory defense against No. 1-ranked Greg Page. But Holmes said the 2.SS million dollars h(· was to get wasn't enough to fight Page. 
"I win 45 tights, and fight everybody for parity," said the un­beaten Holmes, who was unhappy with· purses he received for ~orne pa.~t fights for King, :md who still is rankled that he had to sign for a 50­SO split with Gerry Cooney for their fight June 11, 1981, which Holmes won on a 13th-round knockout.

also said, "If Greg Page and I ever cross each other's path and we can reach agreement, I'll fight Greg Page." · 
As for an IBF title defense for Holmes, possible opponents could be second-ranked Pinklon Thomas, who is unbeaten and fought a I 0­
round draw wtih Coetzee, and No. 3-ranked Mike Weaver, former WBA champion. John Tate, another for­mer WBA champion, also is being mentioned as a possible opponent.

Hello again, everybody! 
Whether you like it or not -whether you are going or not Gerry Faust and the Fighting Irish football squad have alrea<;)y started preparations for their December 29 Liberty Bowl matchup with Bos­ton College. While there definitely will not be a national champion­ship or a top-twenty ranking on the line for the Irish, this will still be a big game for Faust and Co. The seniors would like to go out as winners, the underclassmen would like to use this game as a "stepping stone" for the future, and the entire team would like to show a nationwide audience that Notre Dame was not wrong in accepting a bowl invitation with a 6-5 mark. 
However, everyone knows by now that Boston College won't be a pushover by any stretch of the imagination. The Eagles boast a 9·2 record, a Heisman Trophy runner-up. and a wealth oftalent on both sides ofthe line. Most ofall, Boston College would love to dethrone Notre Dame as the king ofCatholic football. It will be up to the Irish players and coaches to respond to the challenge set before them. 
Some Liberty Bowl Facts ...Bud Dudley has worked hard to get this matchup together for the 25th anniversary game of the Liberty Bowl, but he has also put together some dandy matchups in the past.
