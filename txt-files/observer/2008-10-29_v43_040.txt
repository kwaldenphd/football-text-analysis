ELECTION 2008 
Students cast election ballots early 
At least 34 states offer voting opportunities before November 4 
By EMMA DRISCOLL 
News Writer 
Students have been taking advantage of the new opportunity to cast their ballots for the Nov. 4 gener­al election early and in-per­son in at least 34 states throughout the country. 
The state of Indiana offers early voting to registered voters and students regis­tered to vote in other states used fall break as an oppor­tunity to vote in their hometowns. 
Senior Colleen Desmond voted at a retirement home 
in Cook County, Ill. 
"My mom informed me that when I came home for break, I needed to go with her to early vote," Desmond said. 
Senior Pat Young, who voted for the first time at a community center in a pub­lic park in his hometown of Houston, Texas, also said that his mother influenced his decision to vote early. 
"My mom encouraged me to do it, and I was thinking 
about  looking  into  it,"  
Young said.  
Freshman  Nathalie  

Rosado voted in her coun­ty's courthouse in Russell 
County, Ky. 
"I was going to vote in Indiana because I thought it would be more helpful, since it was more of a bat­tleground state," Rosado said. However, Rosado did not make the deadline to register to vote in Indiana. 
Early voting offers an alternative for individuals who miss deadlines for absentee voting and people who will be away from their homes on election day. 
Young, who was too young to vote in the last general election, said early voting

SMC profs. examine 
abortion in the election 
By SARAH MAYER 
News Writer 
Professor of Justice Education, Jan Pilarski and Regina Wilson from Campus Ministry led a discussion called "What's the candidates view on ... abortion?" as part of Saint Mary's Super Tuesday events in the weeks leading up to the Nov. 4 election. 
Pilarski presented the Catholic perspective on abor­tion by using "Consciences for Faithful Citizenship" a docu­ment compiled by United States bishops. It is meant to serve as a voting guide. 
"Bishops are not supposed to tell you what to do," Pilarski said. "Being Catholic is about doing good and avoiding evil. If a Catholic supports intrinsically evil acts, the bishops suggest you do not vote for them." 
Intrinsically evil acts according the bishops include abortion, euthanasia, geno­cide and unjust war among others. 
"The Catholic Church wants us to respect life from begin­ning to end, conception to life's finish," Pilarski said. "To

Club rents DVDsfree of charge 

Student government offers over 450 movies 
By AARON STEINER 
News Writer 
Got an inkling to watch "Juno," "Transformers" or episodes of "The Office," but they're not in your movie collec­tion? 
Notre Dame students can "rent" their favorite DVDs free of charge starting this week as part of a new DVD service Notre Dame Student Government is offering. 
The NO DVD Club is operated out of Student Government offices on the second floor of LaFortune and for a year-long refundable five dollar security deposit, students currently have access to over 450 DVDs, organizer Joy Hwang, Student Government Residence Life Committee Chair, said. "Bring your student ID, and a five dollar security deposit and you can join the club," Hwang said. The one time deposit is refundable at the end of the academic year, as long as you follow the rules of the DVD club. 
"They can rent movies for the rest of the year," Hwang said. 
"Unless you turn [a DVD] in late, or you don't turn [a DVD] in, or [the DVD] is damaged, you get [the deposit] back at the end of the year," she said. Students can also opt out of the program if they would like.

Daniels raises aw-areness about heart disease 
Healthy Hearts Center of Indiana Heart Hospital, also presented. 
The event, which took place in the Eck Visitors' Center Auditorium, included free cho­lesterol and glu­e o s e screenings provided by the Indiana H e a r t Hospital, health edu­cation booths provided by the St. Joseph County Health Department, Minority Health Coalition 


and United Health Services. Notre Dame's Health Services and RecSports also had tables in the lobby with additional health informa­tion. 
Daniels told The Observer 
she began her initiative 
because she "felt that peo­
ple were not aware that 
heart disease was the num­
ber one killer of women." 
She said she became 
aware after her mother 
was diagnosed with cardio­
vascular disease; since 
then, she has been spread­
ing the message of the 
importance of taking con­trol of heart health. She told The Observer she has received positive feed­
back about her presenta­tions and that screening results have surprised some participants. 
"Kids in college, they think they're bullet-proof," she said, and cited a healthy-weight, semi-active female student, who, during a previous program, was very surprised to find she had high cholesterol. 
"It's very good for people to learn about their own health and the changes they have to make to their lifestyles to improve it," Daniels said.

Brannon starting off, and 
Lerner taking over when he 
arrived. 
Brannon said he supports 
John McCain because of the 
character and independence 
he has shown throughout his 
life and political career. 
"I think it says a lot about the man, that despite taking on s1weral very scared cows in government, despite the fact that he's fought the president head-on on many issues, that he's the standard bearer for the Hepublican Party," Brannon said. 
Brannon then answered audienc11 questions about McCain's policies. 
When asked how McCain would appoint Supreme Court Justic11s with regard to his beliefs about abortion, Brannon said although McCain disagrees with Hoe v. Wade, he would impose no "absolute litmus test" and he does not believe abortions should be federally banned but left to the states' discre­tion. 
Responding to another question, Brannon explained the goals of McCain's tax plan. 
"One of the biggest prob­lems we have with our tax code is that it taxes capital and business way too much," he said.

will have to "walk into a room with a number of lead­ers of developing nations" in order to persuade them to the proper course of action. Lerner believes that Obama has the right "personal and political skills" to achieve this. 
He also stressed Obama's commitment to meeting both economic and environmental goals, noting that they are not contradictory but rein­forcing aims. 
"Energy, the environment, and national security have come together," Lerner said. "We can solve them in ways that work for the environ­ment, work for clean energy, work for our economy, and work for our national securi­he said. "Like I said we can't hit pause on a Tivo and wait for our climate problems to get better." 
He stressed that develop­ing renewable energy will create jobs in new industries and laid out some of Obama's spe­cific proposals, including poli­

cies that will make the U.S. 50 percent more energy effi­cient by 2030 and a cap and trade program that should reduce pollution 90 percent by 2050. 
Lerner also defended Senator Obama's tax plans, arguing that it will help to balance the budget. 
"The fact of the matter is that when President Bush came into office, this country had more than a $200 billion surplus," he said. "We've frittered that away partly because of tax cuts that have benefited the wealthiest Americans."

Torture-induced confession tossed 
GUANTANAMO BAY, Cuba-A U.S. mili­tary judge barred the Pentagon Tuesday from using a Guantanamo prisoner's confes­sion to Afghan authorities as trial evidence, saying it was obtained through torture. 
Army Col. Stephen Henley said Mohammed Jawad's statements "were obtained by phys­ical intimidation and threats of death which. under the circumstances, constitute torture." 
.Jawad's defense attorney, Air Force Maj. David Frakt, told The Associated Press that the ruling removes "the lynchpin of the gov­ernment's case." 
Guantanamo's ehief prosecutor, Army Col. Lawrence Morris, said he recognized how the judge made his decision and needed to study the ruling before making more com­ments. 
.Jawad, who was still a teenager at the time. is accused of injuring two U.S. soldiers with a grenade in 2002. He allegedly said during his interrogation in Kabul that he hoped the Americans died, and would do it again.

Skinhead plot poorly planned 
BELLS, Tenn. -Two white supremacists charged with plotting to behead blacks across the country and assassinate Barack Obama while wearing white top hats and tuxes were likely too disorganimd to carry out the plot, authorities said, and their planning was riddled with blunders. 
Paul Schlessclman, 18, of Helena-West Helena, Ark., and Daniel Cowart, 20, of Bells are accused of dreaming up the plan. While authorities say they had guns capable of creating carnage, documents show they never got close to getting offthe ground. 
Among the blunders: They drew attention to themselves by etehing ~wastikas on a car with side­walk ehalk, only knew each other for a month, couldn't even pull off a house robbery, and a friend ratted them out to authorities.

Al-Qaida finds new route to Iraq 
Senior officer's death shows how insurgents enter Iraq through Syrian border 
Associated Press 

BAGHDAD -For years, he operated along Syria's remote border where don­keys are the only means of travel. He provided young Arabs from as far away as Morocco and the Persian Gulf with passports, guides and weapons as they slipped into Iraq to wage war. 
But recently, the Iraqi man known as Abu Ghadiyah began doing even more -launching his own armed forays into his home­land, U.S. and Iraqi officials say. 
Finally the United States lashed out, frustrated, it says, after years of vainly pressuring Syria to shut down his network supplying the Sunni insurgency. 
The Americans carried out a bold daylight raid Sunday in a dusty farming community of mud and con­crete houses known as Abu Kamal, just across the bor­der in Syria. The U.S. says Abu Ghadiyah and several bodyguards were killed. Syria says eight civilians died. At least one villager says U.S. forces seized two men and hauled them away.

Shn listed three rnodil'i­abln factors, or things that people can do. to reduce their risk for heart disease: blood prnssure, weight and smoking habits. 
"We re recently lnarning more and more about how important it is for women in particular to start pay­ing attention to heart hnalth," she said, ·and told the audience that almost 500,000 women die from heart disease each year. 
"Heart disease dons not discriminate," Daniels said. "It's pretty frightnning." 
Shn cited the importance of knowing blood pressure and both IIDL and LDL cho­lesterol figures, staying within the weight guide­lines for your height, and quitting smoking, which she said is "the most important thing you can do for yourself." A yearly physical, Daniels said, is important to help keep track of th!'se numbers. to see trends and to spot problems. 
Daniels stressed the importance of making time for regular exercise, even though it might be hard to fit physical activity into busy college schedulns. 
All lifestyle changes should not be made at once to ensure success. Daniels said. "You need to go slow­ly" because if you go over­board, and start an extreme new diet and exer­cise regime you'll "be 
staving, you'll be sore and then you'll quit." 
She said exercise can also help college students cope with the stress they experi­nnce at school, and that they will see both a differ­ence in their physical appearance and the way the feel by performing 30­60 minutes of physical activity on most days. 
Daniels encouraged the audience to share the information they learned during the program with loved ones and to make a pledge to themselves that they arc "going to take steps to lead a healthier life and lead by example." 
"Give yourself the best gift you can -the gift of exercise, the gift of a heart healthy life," she said. 
Adams gave a PowerPoint presentation about miscon­ceptions about cardiovas­cular disease in women, risk factors and symptoms. 
According to a recent survey that asked women what they perceived to be their biggest health eon­cern, almost half said breast cancer, Adams said. Heart disease was the fourth most popular

The audience at Tuesday's presentation contained more male stu­dents than when Daniels has brought Heart to Heart to other state universities, like Purdue, Ball State and Indiana University. 
"Usually there are just a handful of' men," Daniels told the Observer after the presentation. "Though its just as important for them to be aware about cardio­vascular disease, which we've known for a long time to be the number one killer of men too," she said.

Schmidt said of the students who had signed up throughout the day Mond-ay, "a lot of peo­ple didn't even know where the second floor of LaFortune was."

them euthanasia and abortion deserve our preeminent attention." 
In the bishop's document, they said there is no way to completely abolish abortion however. the American people need to work in small steps to stop it. 
In the end, it all comes down to personal choice, she said. 
"You can vote for a candi­date if another intrinsic evil is more of a preeminent issue to you," Pilarski said. 
Pilarski went on to intro­duce Barack Obama's point of view on abortion. As in recent years Obama strongly sup­ports Hoe v. Wade but Pilarski quoted the Democratic Party Platform as saying "the Democratic Party also strong­ly supports access to afford­able family planning services and comprehensive age­appropriate sex education which empowers people to made informed choices and live healthy lives." 
While remaining pro-choke, the Democratic Party will work to provide resources and healthcare for women who choose to have their child. 
"By introducing these health care options for women who choose life or adoption, Obama is trying to find a common ground with the Republicans on the issue of abortion," Pilarski said. 
In closing, Pilarski said it is hard to be a Catholic voter becausn no candidate envelopes all issues we hold true as belinvers." 
Hegina Wilson then spoke on the side of the Hepublieans. 
Wilson referred to a ques­tion asked to both Obama and McCain about abortion. While Obama's answer was a bit long, McCain simply said, "I am pro-life and I have been my whole 25 year career." 
"Hepublicans are concerned with maintaining the sanctity and dignity of life," Wilson said."Life is right given to us in the Deelaration of Jndependnncn along with lib­erty and tho pursuit of happi­ness." 
Wilson explained that if John McCain is elected all of his appointees will hold the traditional, family values he holds. 
After resnarching McCain Wilson said she learned he allows abortion in cases of incest or rape but in the case of rape "parental acknowl­edgement would be neces­sary." 
"If McCain overturns Hoe v. Wade it will be one step in the long path to end abortion," she said. 
"According to McCain we need to empower women who decide against abortion by letting them know it took courage for them to bring a child into the world and we need to be compassionate to mother and child through there struggles." Wilson said.

US automakers seek extra federal aid 
WASIIINGTON Beleaguered U.S. automakers are seeking federal help beyond the money available for them as part of a financial industry bailout and a loan package to fund more fuel-efficient cars, the White House said Tuesday. 
White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said the auto industry has talked to the Bush administration about funding on a much broader scale than the two programs approved by Congress earlier this fall. 
"No doubt that the automakers are big important companies, important to a lot of families and important to a lot of regions in this country," Perino said. "We are capable of competing at a level where these companies can succeed. they might just need a little help. And that's what Congress asked us to help provide them." 
General Motors Corp., which is in talks about acquiring Chrysler LLC, is pursuing $5 billion to $10 billion in government aid, said an industry official, who declined to be identi­fied because the discussions were private. GM officials declined comment. 
Soybean prices fall, corn prices rise 
NEW YORK -Soybean prices fell in erratic trading Tuesday even after the government lowered its estimate for the size of this year's harvest. Corn prices traded higher. 
The U.S. Agriculture Department's forecast for planted and harvested corn and soybeans fell after the agency discovered discrepancies in a database used to compile the report. Forecasts for corn and soybean production also fell. 
Soybeans for January delivery lost 9.5 cents to settle at $8.88 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, after earlier rising as high as $9.59. 
Vie Lespinasse of Grainanalyst.com said traders were disappointed that the revisions to the crop report "were not more bullish." 
"This caused a lot of would-be buyers to wait ... preventing prices from advancing after their higher start," Lespinasse said.

of Congo, a country the size of 
Western Europe with vast 
reserves of diamonds, gold and

The U.N. says more than 200,000 people have been forced from their homes in the last two months. joining 1.2 million dis­placed in previous conflict<> in the east. Outbreaks of cholera and diarrhea have killed dozens in eamps, compounding the misery. 
On Monday. peacekeepers in attack helicopters fired at the rebels trying to stop them taking Kibumba, a village on the main road 30 miles north of Goma. But fleeing civilians say the fighters overran Kibumba anyway. 
The rnbPls retaliated by firing a missile at one U.N. combat heli­copter Monday, but missed, U.N. spokeswoman Sylvie van den Wildenberg said. 
U.N. efforts to halt Nkunda's rebellion are eomplieated by the country's rugged terrain, dense tropical forest<> that roll over hills and mountains with few roads. 
The chief U.N. mandate is to protect the population. But since the peaee deal it also is supposed to help the Congolese army dis­arm and repatriate Hutu militia­men-by force if necessary. 
But Bisimwa, the rebel spokesman. claimed Tuesday the Congolese army has abandoned dozens of its positions to Hutu militiamen. 
"It's the llutus who are on the front line and whom we are fight­ing, not the army," he said. U.N. peacekeepers "leave us no ehoiee but to fight on." 
Nkunda long has charged that Congolese soldiers light alongside the militia of 1-lutus, an ethnic majority of about 40 percent in the ref.,rion. 
Some HOO llutu militiamen have voluntarily returned to Rwanda, the U.N. says, but the fighters recruit and coerce Congolese 1-lutu childnm and young men into their ranks daily -far outnumbering those who have returned home.

CAMPAIGN NEWS 
Biden to campaign in Indiana 
EVANSVILLE, Ind. -Democratic vice pres­idential candidate Joe Biden will make a campaign visit to southern Indiana just three days before the election. 
Barack Obama's presidential campaign says Biden will talk about the economy at an appearance in the Evansville area on Saturday. No additional details are being released yet. 
The Biden visit will come three days after his Hepublican counterpart, Sarah Palin, campaigns in Jeffersonville on Wednesday night. It will be Palin's third visit to Indiana in 12 days. 
Biden drew a crowd of several hundred people to a Jeffersonville park when he last campaigned in Indiana on Sept. 24. He also stopped with Obama at a restaurant in the northeastern Indiana town of Hamilton on Aug. 31. 
Joe the Plumber backs McCain 
COLUMBUS, Ohio -Joe the Plumber endorsed Republican John McCain for presi­dent on Tuesday. 
Samuel J. Wurzelbacher gained national attention when Obama told him during a campaign stop that he wanted to "spread the wealth around." Their exch~nge about Obama's tax plan aired countless times on cable news programs, and McCain repeated­ly cited Joe the Plumber in their third and final debate and again at campaign events. 
McCain points to Wurzelbacher as an example of the middle-class worker who would be hurt economically by an Obama presidency, However, Wurzelbacher likely would fare better under Obama's tax plan because it calls for no tax increase for work­ing couples earning less than $250,000 a year -Wurzelbacher himself earns far less -and provides for a middle-class tax cut. 
In a McCain rally at a flag store, Wurzelbacher said he feared that Obama would turn the U.S. into a socialist nation. 
Obama rallies supporters in PA, VA 
HAHHISONBURG, Va. -From a Pennsylvania rainstorm to two thunder­ous Virginia rallies, Barack Obama told revved-up followers Tuesday they were "so close" to winning. 
Targeting two key states, defending one and surging in the other, Obama stayed on the safe ground of linking Republican rival John McCain to President Bush. 
"This election. more than any other in my lifetime, represents a clear choice between the past and the future," the 47-year-old Democrat said, ribbing his 72-year-old opponent. 
Dropping into the Shenandoah Valley, Obama spoke first to about 8,000 people who spilled onto a soccer field at James Madison University because the indoor site was too packed. 
Inside, Obama found 12,000 more peo­ple, mostly students who were too excit­ed to sit. 
Republicans hopeful against odds 
A determined McCain fights on, refuses to surrender as election draws near 
Associated Press 

HERSHEY, Pa. -John McCain repeatedly implores backers to "stand up and fight" these days, showing gritty determination even as many indicators point to a Barack Obama victory and Republicans engage in fin­gerpointing typical of losing campaigns. 
"Nothing is inevitable here. We never give up. And we never quit," McCain declares. 
A week before Election Day, the Republican is an enthusiastic underdog with what advisers say is a deep personal belief that he still has a chance to stage an upset next week. He has come back from the brink politically and personally before, and they say, he's resolved to do so again despite steep challenges. 
In the homestretch, he tells people to ignore the pundits who project an Obama triumph and the polls that favor the Democrat. He scorns Obama's confident air in the waning days as a prema­ture "victory lap." He says the country deserves "someone who will fight 'til the end." And, he says a GOP victory is within reach. 
Some GOP pessimists 
have suggested he follow 
the example of Bob Dole, 
who, once he fell well 
behind Democrat Bill 
Clinton in 1996, shifted his 
campaign from states with 
the tightest presidential 
races to those where his 
appearance could most help 
Republican candidates for 
lesser offices. But McCain 
has steadfastly focused on 
the closest presidential bat­
tleground states. 

Even so, the very real possibility of a loss -and life after the campaign ­has crept into McCain's lat­est pitch. "I have fought for you most of my life, and in places where defeat meant more than returning to the Senate," McCain says. Then, he adds: ''I've never been the kind to back down when the stakes are high." 
Public surveys show Obama leads nationally and McCain faces a difficult path to the 270 electoral votes needed. He's struggling to hold onto traditionally Republican states. In a trou­blesome sign, the Republican National Committee was forced to shore up support with TV ads in the often reliably GOP state of Montana and boosted its presence in West Virginia, which President Bush won. 
Pennsylvania, which offers 21 electoral votes and hasn't backed a Republican presidential nominee since 1988, is the only traditional­ly Democratic state McCain now is going after in earnest. Some GOP aides say it alone may hold the key to a McCain victory. Democrats are doubtful. 
McCain also is hearing an increasing number of prominent Republicans indicate they expect he will lose. Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney was the latest. "We face the very real possibility of an Obama presidency," Romney said fundraising e-mail on behalf of Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. 
At the same time, the blame game has emerged in GOP circles. Some Republicans have pointed the finger at McCain's chief strategist Steve Schmidt; others are rushing to his defense. 
And, frustrations by Palin's allies over her rocky introduction to the public and by McCain's backers over the Alaska governor's unscripted moments spilled into the open through anonymous quotes in news stories. Senior campaign advisers deny a rift and attribute the griping of a few junior aides. 
The Arizona senator's top advisers acknowledge the difficulties in pulling off a comeback, yet they insist McCain still has a shot and adamantly deny McCain is going through the motions. 


INDIANA GOVERNOR'S RACE 
High stakes for Indiana in tight race for governor seat 
Associated Press 
INDIANAPOLIS -One of the most critical contests for Republicans and Democrats alike this year is being fought well outside the presidential spotlight, but the stakes for Indiana voters are just as high. 
Republicans are expected to keep their grip on the state Senate, but the closely divided Indiana House is up for grabs again, as it has been for two decades. Democrats have a slim 51-49 advantage now, and any change could affect Hoosiers where they live and work. 
"Without a doubt, there is real power with issues related to schools and welfare services and will you get the road you want," said James McCann, a Purdue University political sci­ence professor. "State lawmak­ers deal with very bread-and­butter issues." 
Republican Gov. Mitch Daniels, who faces Democrat Jill Long Thompson, acknowl­edges that in his first two years -2005 and 2006 -he never would have won some of his top priorities if Republicans had not controlled both cham­bers. 
Chief among them were leas­ing the Indiana Toll Road to a foreign, private group for $3.8 billion and pushing Indiana to observe daylight saving time statewide. Republicans con­trolled the House 52-48 then, and each of those measures became law by a single vote. 

Had Democrat Patrick Bauer of South Bend been in power, as he is now as speaker, the Toll Road almost certainly would still be in Indiana's hands; likewise, the state would still be among three that do not change their clocks. 
If Daniels wins, a GOP-con­trolled Legislature would make it easier to for him to get what he wants -or at least can live with. That could include fur­ther expansion of full-day kindergarten and automatic tax credits to taxpayers if the state's budget surplus reaches a certain level. 
But this is expected to be a big year for Democrats, and Barack Obama has put his party in presidential play in Indiana for the first time in decades. 
Bauer hopes that will trickle down to the legislative level and give his party a boost. 
If so, look for another two years of Daniels vs. Bauer. They've proven they can work together, and proven they can clash. 
"Indiana has right now both a governor and a House leader, both of whom are in the busi­ness of government, but also connoisseurs of power," said Robert Schmuhl, a political sci­ence professor at the University of Notre Dame. 
In other words, big-time egos backed up by years of political smarts. 
While the House races could create some suspense, Republicans almost certainly will keep control of the Senate -a situation that hasn't changed since early 1979.

Life as the senior class knows it ends at graduation this upcoming May. 
Just as the words of the unofficial Yale alma mater state, we're living in the "shortest, gladdest years of life" right now. Well, if these four years of col­lege are the best we'll ever have in our lives than can we possibly look forward to anything-after graduation? I don't think we can. 
Let's look at the various aspects of the eras that face us in the future and how each of these diflerent ages will fail to satisfy us. 
Early Adulthood 

The biggest shock after college: you have to get a job. I'm trying to resist this necessity as much as possible but I realize I need to be able to afford the lifestyle to which I've grown accustomed. I can't ever see myself being able to put in an 80-hour work­week, and hopefully I'll never have to. But it could be that way. Unfortunately. 
Middle Age 

Ostensibly children, marriage, and the work-a-day life continue to domi­nate the environments of the people our parents' age. Paying bills? Paying taxes? It's not a money issue -it s a writing issue. I've seen that episode of Seinfeld where Jerry cripples his hand signing those Japanese checks. That health risk, along with increased potential for heart and prostate issues, make Middle Age the least appealing age. 
Senior Citizenship 

I have nothing but respect for sen­ior citizens. But in the past month, I have had two exceedingly awkward encounters with elderly women. I have to relate these occurrences to you, reader, because otherwise my 

EDITORIAL CARTOON MODERN RESOURCES R:::>R ""f::7l1..e, WALL STREET TT?AD£R 
I 



lNIERNAL 'SOURCES C>UTSIDE Coi\ISULTANT 
point will be dulled by lack of speci­
ficity. 

The first happened at the Krispy Kreme in Mishawaka. I was trying to order a dozen hot donuts on a Saturday morning and this woman approaches me outside the range of my peripheral vision. She sidled up to me without me ever noticing her. Without introducing herself, she grabs my arm {scares me to death) and says, "I was going to go to Arby's but then I saw that red sign on so I decided to come get a free doughnut." Two things. One: why did. I not know about this free doughnut policy? Two: what gave this woman the right to sneak up behind me, grab my arm, and talk to me? 
The second instance occurred at my local polling place this past week. I was voting absentee-in-person on Monday afternoon and waited quietly for my name to be called up to the voting booth. An older woman sat down next to me and I said hello with a polite head nod, figuring that our conversation would end there. A few silent minutes later, the woman turned to me and said, "You never know who you're going to sit next to!" I couldn't tell if this meant I was sup­posed to recognize her, if she was try­ing to figure out if I were famous or not, or if she was indicating that she was seconds away from doing some­thing shocking. I didn't respond, deathly afraid of my seatmate. Then she said, "Too bad I've been eating onions all morning," and proceeded to cackle for several more minutes. Thank goodness I was called to vote shortly thereafter. 
These women were not unjustified in talking to me but I cannot figure out why senior citizens feel the need to talk to strangers in such fashions. I do not look forward to a day when I will want to talk to as many random people as possible. I can barely muster up the strength to talk to my closest friends. I won't be able to sur­vive in a world where it's expected you'll speak with unknown people in lines at fast food restaurants, waiting 
rooms, and offices. 
Decrepitude 
Most people would stop their age divisions at the senior citizen level. But in my experience this does not speak to the actualities of our dynam­ic population. I mean, you can join the AARP at 50 and hold that mem­bership seemingly indefinitely (as long as you pay those darn dues). We need to come to a higher understand­ing of old age in this country: an understanding that will include less generalization of older peoples. With increasing life expectancies in many sectors of the US population, there should be a la'it phase of life that runs from the age of 85 until death. 
And actually, I look forward to this point in my life. I'll be too old to be a senior citizen, too young to b1~ dead. I'll be just senile enough to be as inappropriate and ofl"ensive as I desire. If anyone is hurt by my com­ments I can blame senility in the purest and most beautiful form of deniability in existence. Nobody gets mad at the quirky old guy. But on top of this freedom comes the actual hardship of actually being senile. We can romanticize the loss of one's intel­lectual capacities with envious eyes. but we have to take a step back to understand that the inherent condi­tion of using your senility for humor is wholly and truly being senile. And I don't actually ever want to be senile. Do you? I think not. 
So now I've deconstrueted each of the periods of life after we leave this hallowed ground. And every last one of them has the appeal of getting hit by a freight train. I don't have any solutions or optimistic advice. I agree with Yale. These bright college years will never be matched. Ever. Sorry.

Faith and politics 
Faith and politics should never be dis­cussed in polite company, we are told. Yet in reality, the two are constantly in dia­logue, for better or worse. Politics has become increasingly moralistic and the religious have Ally Brantley become much more and Joe Stranix 
political. And with a rapidly approaching

election, every 
Columnists

responsible citizen has a duty to look at how they might com­bine the two. 
Whether we care to admit it or not, most of us grapple with this issue on a daily basis. The College Democrat who struggles with a candidate's pro-choice stance is in the same predicament as the Right to Life member whose concerns about the dignity of the immigrant clash with a pro-life can­didate's anti-immigration stance. It isn't easy to balance the issues. Many times, our church says one thing, while our politi­cal party says another. Faith and politics are personal issues. neither of which can be divorced from our worldview. We can­not just eliminate either, or allow one to dictate our actions on issues. Who do we follow, and how do we decide which are the most important issues? 
One place to look is the Catholic Church, which recognizes that voting is truly a per-
LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
sonal decision. It is not merely following the directions of another. The US Conference of Catholic Bishops published the latest in a series of voter guides, "Forming Consciences for Faithful Citizenship," aiming to educate our indi­vidual consciences on a wide variety of issues. The document does not tell Catholics what to do, but rather, serves as a guide for us to discern our own political path from a faith-based perspective. 
This is not just a theoretical approach; we have seen it in action. The two of us led a fall break Center for Social Concerns seminar in Washington, DC, in which we focused on the intersection of human rights, faithful citizenship and policy. During our immersion, we constantly saw individuals attempting to reconcile their politics and faith. People in government, think tanks and the religious laity acknowledged that their faith does, indeed, play a role in their politics. However, it is a delicate balance, unique to each individ­ual. 
We encountered an immigration official who stated that faith shapes his worldview and he cannot separate it from politics. We discussed immigration with a libertarian who used economics to espouse a view that his faith supported. We spoke with a Franciscan sister working for an organiza­tion to promote the common good and a pro-life Catholic united behind Obama. All recognized a faith-politics connection, though it played out to different degrees in their professional lives. 
These various individuals demonstrated that we cannot wholly disregard the fusion offaith and politics. Neither is pernicious to the other, but rather, enriches its coun­terpart. For example, the Catholic under­standing of a consistent ethic oflife brings morality and social justice to the immigra­tion debate. Political and economic consid­erations provide a pragmatic framework for the issue as well. 
So what can we learn from the USCCB and other individuals in Washington? 
Faith and politics do not need to be dis­tinct or separate, but in healthy dialogue. For us, as young voters, this means that our faith can, and should, inform our polit­ical decisions. As the "Forming Consciences" document suggests, this means not voting on just a single issue, but instead, considering all issues. This isn't easy, nor is it meant to be. Not all issues hold the same weight and not every candi­date will be sincere in their views. Neither our religious institutions nor our political parties can tell us what to do. In the end, it is up to us and our convictions. Many Catholics are "politically homeless" for this exact reason. And yet every year, we must return to the ballot box, having reweighed the candidates and the issues. It is a diffi­cult call to answer. We are debating and weighing some of the most important issues of our day, and reaching an informed decision is a challenging process which takes time and effort. 
Civic engagement begins with voting, but does not end there. Our internal debate between our faith and politics can guide our involvement in our community, where a variety of outlets are available. Contact your congressperson, write an editorial, enroll in a community based learning course. Study the issues about which you are passionate and listen to the continual discussion and dialogue between faith and politics in our culture. 
Engage with yourself and others on these issues and, of course, don't forget to VOTE.

The right to life, liberty, happiness and access to Abortion 
I am a single issue voter. I admit it. A candidate's stance on abortion is my litmus test. I believe that any candidate who sup­ports abortion cannot be a leader. How can we trust someone who is not willing to protect the most vulnerable in our society? Fr. Frank Pavone has a striking compari­son: If a candidate told us that they were pro-terrorism, we would never consider voting for them regardless of how they were going to fix the economy or reform health care. Yet, when a candidate says they are pro-abortion we weigh that with their foreign policy experience and plans for tax cuts . I have heard numerous peo­ple on this campus claim that they feel that Obama's policies are the most holistically "pro-life" and for that reason they will be casting their vote in his favor. While I will avoid other "life" issues, I want to address Obama's stance on abortion and what he plans to do about it-something I feel that no amount of health care reform can ever justifY. 
Barack Obama has said, "The first thing I'll do as President is sign the Freedom of Choice Act . " The Freedom of Choice Act (FOCA) will effectively codify Roe vs. Wade. So, even if the Supreme Court does over­turn Roe, abortion rights will be untouched. This law not only guarantees the right to abortion for future genera­tions, it also strikes down all existing laws that in any way limit access to abortion. 
The FOCA would end the need for parental consent or notification which is required in 35 states . While a school nurse cannot give a middle school girl a Tylenol without her parent's consent, she can take her to have an abortion without ever telling the girl's parents. The FOCA would end all waiting periods before abor­tions and eliminate the need for informed consent. The FOCA would strike down the ban on partial birth abortion, a horren­dous practice where all but the head of a viable baby is delivered, the back of the neck is punctured, the brain is suctioned out, and a dead baby is delivered . The FOCA would strike down the Born Alive Infant Protection Act which requires a doc­tor to provide medical treatment to a baby born alive during an abortion. 
Not only would this act affect state's abortion restrictions, this act effectively redefines abortion as a fundamental right (as most argue was intended by Roe vs. Wade and the companion case Doe vs. Bolton). This means that not only can the state not restrict a woman's access to abortion; the state must provide a woman with the means to exercise this right. The FOCA will invalidate all laws restricting funding of abortion (namely the Hyde amendment) and all laws that prohibit abortions in public hospitals. The FOCA would cut federal funding to pregnancy centers that do not provide abortions or refer to abortion clinics. The FOCA will invalidate all laws allowing hospitals or health-care providers, to decline to provide or pay for abortions (conscience laws). So, any of you pre-meds reading this may be required in the future to perform abortions whether you like it or not. The FOCA will also strike down any "physician-only" laws that say that abortions much be preformed by a licensed physician. Interestingly enough, most of these laws do not require that the physician be in any way trained in obstetrics and gynecology. The physician could be an allergist or podiatrist and still be a legal abortion provider. If the FOCA is passed, anyone can be an "abortion provider" because to do otherwise might interfere with a woman's access to abor­tion. Currently, regulation of abortion clin­ics is left to the state. Sadly, in many states, veterinary clinics are more regulated than abortion facilities. By letter of the FOCA, regulations could not legally exist. 
Obama is not pro-life. He may have ideas about how health care, the economy, and poverty should be managed, but he is an outright supporter of death of almost 3300 children daily. Obama believes we should end the Iraq War because roughly 4,000 of our soldiers have died. So all things con­sidered, am I a one issue voter? Heck yes!

We could use a little socialistn right 
Now Jesus Christ was a socialist. In "Barack the Socialist" (Observer Viewpoint, 10/28108), Christie Pesavento urges, "If you like socialism, then by all means vote for Barack the Socialist." Colin Powell, endorsing Barack Obama on "Meet the Press," said the important ques­tion is not whether Obama is a Muslim, but whether it would matter if he were. 
A similar analysis is necessary here. The important question is not whether Obama is a socilaist, but whether it would matter if he were. 
The fact is, the United States could use a little socialism these days. Pesavento's "example to illustrate the injustice of redistributive practices" is entirely mis­leading. 
First and foremost, Obama is not advo­cating, and has never advocated, anything approaching a system in which "everyone receives the same grade." People currently making $250,000 a year ("next to nothing" in some locales, according to Pesavento) will still make $250,000 a year under Obama's plan, but they will pay the mar­ginal tax rate they paid under Clinton. Wow, that was a rough time for America's wealthy. Nothing like today, when federal bail-outs are required. Under Obama's tax plan, everyone else will get a tax cut, keeping more of their hard-earned money. What's so bad about that? By the way, our entire progressive income tax structure has always been "redistributive." 
Second, Pesavento's "example" belies the classist bias of the author. She paints a scenario in which "you have worked hard and managed to earn an A," while "other students have slacked off and are receiv­ing lower grades." This classroom analogy is cute, but it is entirely inapposite. Unlike grades, one's financial situation in today's America has little or nothing to do with hard work. I am about to begin a lucrative career as a trial lawyer. Sure I've worked hard to get here, but I was also blessed with a comfortable middle-class upbring­ing, good health, United States citizenship, English as a first language, private school­ing and white skin. Others with better work ethics than I possess but without the other benefits I've enjoyed will not have the same opportunities I've had. Before Reagan, prosperity in this country was more closely tied to effort than it is today. There was a time when Americans made money through hard work and creativity. But today, Americans make money with money, and often with money they don't actually have (see the Wall Street bail-out). 
The bottom line is that millions of Americans have a zero percent chance of financial success under our current struc­ture. Barack Obama offers these Americans much more than "vague yet seemingly reassuring promises of 'change."' Obama offers a real plan under which more Americans will pay less taxes, have more job opportunities, have better education, have a cleaner environment, and have reliable, anxiety-free healthcare coverage. 
Perhaps Pesavento is unaware that the leading cause of personal bankruptcy in this country is not "slack[ing] off'' but cata­strophic medical bills. Perhaps according to Webster's dictionary, it is proper to label Barack Obama a "socialist." But to do so misses the point. The proper question to ask is, why is that such a bad thing? 
America will never be a country where "everyone receives the same grade," nor should it be. But what America should be, at the very least, is a country where every­one is at least sitting in the same class­room at the beginning of the semester, with access to the same professor and textbook. That's the America Obama wants to create, and he has a plan to get us there. That's why he gets my vote.

The Wildcats are back! Again. llallelujah! 
Disney addicts arfl f1ocking to theatres Jess Shaffer to enjoy their------­
favorite guilty Assistant 
pl11asure. As I'm 
sure many a girls' Scene Editor dorm room can prove, High School Musical is far more than just a preteen phenome­non -the innumerable HSM posters 
and Troy and Gabriella bed sheets are undeniable proof of an obsession that has overrun girls of all ages. The series is the most PG fun you can have. Luckily for fans everywhere, this made for TV classic has been taken to the next level and we can see our favorite too-old-to-actually­be-high-school-students on the silver scrmm. 
There are so many things to love about High School Musical. Watehing toens break into song and dance dur­ing normal day-to-day activity is packed with entortainment value. 

First, there is some serious mock­ability. Any dance number that s1tarts with cheese fries being dumped on a girl can't go wrong. Second, there are the legitimate dance moves of cast members like Corbin Bleu. If talent doesn't float your boat, there's always the hilarity that ensues when Zac Efron attempts to bust a move. Note the "Bet On It" routine from "High School Musical 2" where Zac Efron frolics through a golf course singing about perseverance, complete with fist jabs, jazz fingers, split jumps and skipping. Not only fun and wholesome to watch, but amusing when one considers that Efron is sup­posed to be the high school "it boy." 
As far as the musical routines are concerned, catchiness is the name of the game. Those who snobbishly turn up their noses at the High School Musical pop soundtrack dwell in an elite delusion that ignores the memo­rable nature the tunes. The songs are at worst harmless and at best really fun (and/or hilarious). No wonder Disney frequently has sing-along air­ings of the films. Of course, with the move of "High School Musical 3" to theatres, self-consciousness may pre­vent fans from belting out their favorite songs in public. 
And then there's the cast who por­tray the dean cut, good looking, well­behaved teenagers that are typical of a Disney approach to high school. Zac Efron and Vanessa Hudgens play the "it couple," embodying a combi­nation of intelligence, athleticism, and stage talent. (Cute and whole­some on screen, it's always delightful to throw in tidbits from this real life couple's tabloid life. The contrast is stark and difficult not to enjoy.) Then there are the other high school cari­catures: the wallflower, the joke, the theatre nerd, the maniacal popular girl, and the smart girl. Somehow these wildcats exist in a utopia where all these characters are friends. And 
· what's not to enjoy about this delu­sion? We labor away with classes and real life drama. We've seen high school, up close and personal. It's nice and funny to see how Disney approaches the quintessential period of teenage angst. 
Basically when considering High School Musical, there are clearly two main types of fans: those who youth­fully bask in the fun, simplified, light version of high school presented and those who enjoy the endless amounts of jokes that can be made at the film's expense. But there's no doubt that both groups appreciate the latest -and perhaps last -installment of High School Musical. However bitter­sweet the experience may be, there's always your Zac Efron pillow to ding onto when you're curled up in the fetal position, pining for the East High Wild Cats.

If you're in the market for a film that riles your emotions and leaves you eontemplating the meaning of life when the credits roll, High School Musical 3: Senior Year may not be for you. 
But, if you're looking for some­thing packed with en11rgy, egotistic stage performers, Disney cliches, dancing basketball players, high school romance (and bromance), something that's just, well. two hours of fun. the third installment of the 'tween musical about a star ath­lete and a shy "freaky-genius girl" finding love and taking over the drama department at an Albuquerque high school delivers. 
A new and improved Zac Efron, with arms that made the 12 year­olds in the theater scream, as home­town hero Troy Bolton, faces a choice at the end of his high school career: does he follow in his father's footsteps and attend U of A for bas­ketball with his best friend and fel­low hoops star Chad Danforth 
usical 3 
Director: Kenny Ortega Starring: Zac Efron, Vanessa Hudgens, Ashley Tisdale 



(Corbin Bleu)? Or does he follow his other, once-secret passion, singing, and win a scholarship to Julliard?' And what about his love for devoted, 'T" pendant-wearing Gabriella Montez (Vanessa Hudgens). who's heading off to Stanford? 
If you were a fan of the originall HSM (2006) or the second install-· ment, HSM2 (2007), you will be very satisfied with entire cast, who have matured over the years. The sound.. track is expertly done, especially the opening "Now or Never" basketball! montage and, surprisingly., "Scream," Zac Efron's teen-angst solo through the halls of an aban-· doned East High. Ashley Tisdale (Sharpay Evans) and Lucas Grabeell (Ryan Evans) continue to offer high­energy, wonderfully vain, over-the-· top musical numbers, like "I Want It All," which takes place in the cafete-· ria that has become a hotbed for improvisational dance. 
The somewhat cliche drama that fuels the plot is to be expected, along with the occasional references to the previous Disney Channel orig­inal movies ("We're all in this together", "Breaking with the status quo", etc.). 
Gabriella Montez is just as annoy­ing as ever in this installment, call­in~ her boyfriend "Wildcat" and wearing almost scandalously short skirts. Though Troy continually emphasizes her important role in the East High universe, her on­screen time has definitely decreased from the other two films, and Senior Year focuses on all of the characters more equally than before, in their collective journey from average stu­dents to on-stage sensations. 
It is Efron and Danforth who steal the show in "The Boys are Back," a scene where an ordinary trip to the junkyard suddenly transforms into a high-impact dance number. The two best buds reminisce about their childhood selves (who amazingly appear from under a wrecked car) and some how make pirouettes and somersaults seem masculine and natural. 
Efron displays some legitimate acting talent, and takes on the part of a hard to find, truly sincere teen heartthrob; though his character has conquered virtually every aspect of East High, he is still unsure of his next step and his on-screen relation­ship with real-life girlfriend Hudgens. 
Director Kenny Ortega (Newsies) brings the teen saga to the big screen in a big way, with elaborately choreographed numbers that are much more grown up than their made for TV predecessors. 
The HSM films are entertaining, and they bring real aspects of being a confused adolescent to life in a happy, fun, the-guy-gets-the-girl fashion. I don't want to give them too much praise; I resisted watching the first when it premiered on T.V., but once you're introduced to the Wildcat crew, they're kind of hard to resist. 
Efron might be ready to graduate from High School, but I'd be eager for a fourth installment.

One night during high school I sat down to watch TV with my younger brother. We both grew up on Disney, avidly waiting for the latest Disney Channel Original Movie since the days of Jett Jackson. So, when I decided to venture back into the world of my youth for a night, I was hoping to regain some happy childhood mojo. 
What I encoun-Stephanie 
tered w~s a travesty DePrez of the highest order. ______ Being a musical the­
atre  geek in  high  Assistant  
school,  I  had  Scene Editor  
approached  this  

new "lligh School Musical" movie with measurable excitement. But Disney, my beloved Disney, had sold out. I was not watching a relatable hero battle life and insurmountable foes in order to "find" him/herself, as is the general formula for the D-COM, but instead I &aw a mockery of absolutely every­thing from high school theatre pro­grams to Disney itself. 
The music was a joke, nothing like the "Even Stevens" musical episode I loved so much. Instead it was overpro­duced, simplistic drivel built on com­puter chords and electric drums on par with a Britney Spears comeback. 
It wasn't even witty! 

The lyrics were unbelievable to the point where I had to ask, "Did she just say 'hip-hop hooray?'" After half an hour I turned to my brother and said, "This script is so bad, it's making my toenails cringe." Disney's attempt at "cute-hip-upbeat-frivolous-fun" had fallen flat on its face. 
Much to my chagrin, the tweeny­boppers came out in droves to the point that no-fool Disney decided to make a second. And a third. But before you gag me with a spoon, here are some reasons I passionately despise this "HSM" thing with the white-hot intensity of a thousand suns. 
The music 

It could have been cute, but it's just awful. I love the simple, catchy atti­tude of musical theatre today, but this went beyond. I would rail on against the composers, but they're sitting on piles of money so the argument would be moot. It's a principle thing, though. Yea I say unto you, composers: The music you wrote is miserable and I hope your money is worth what you lost as a musician. Key change! 
The story 

The first movie was ridiculous, and coming from an intense high school musical program I can tell you with certainty that it was nothing like reali­ty. I know "that's not the point," but really guys, give high school thespians some respect. We got none from the sports programs. The second movie's plot was unremarkable. I offer it up to the chopping block. 
Though I haven't seen the third, I've heard of there are a number of bla­tant flaws that make Disney look just plain stupid. I'm here to tell you none of those kids are going to Juilliard. Juilliard programs are classical, and they aren't exactly looking for any of the skills these characters display. And a Stanford honors program? 
Honey, Stanford is an honors program. And there is no way anyone from Stanford is getting away with a rela­tionship with someone attending Cal Berkeley. The schools are mortal ene­mies. 
The acting. 
Vanessa Hudgens. 'Nuff said. 
Though I could continue, it would be for naught, because I know everyone who loves High School Musical isn't going to stop loving it anytime soon. And I can't really blame a franchise that is off making billions of dollars through clean entertainment, even if it is an artistic disaster. All I can say is, when we look back on our lives, is this really what we will want to see as our cultural contribution to the universe?

Chad Danforth (Corbin Bleu) Chad has always been the most resistant to his East High classmates stepping outside of the status quo. Basketball is the only thing on his mind. So can he open his eyes in time and gather the courage to ask his lady to prom? And will he be able to con­vince his best friend Troy to drop the drama and work on his jump shot? Bleu finally gets his chance in the spotlight as the best dancer in the cost during the junkyord set, bromance-inspired duet with Efron in "The Boys Are Bock." 
Gabriella Montez (Vanessa Hudgens) She got the whole gang together by shaking things up with her arrival of East High in "High School Musi­cal". But this time around she will struggle with leaving the only place she ever developed roots and friends for her dream school Stanford. It's her idea that they all do the spring musical, but with early orientation will she make the ploy? And will she still be wearing her "T" for Troy necklace as acollege freshman? Note Hud­gens' dancing prowess in "Can I Hove This Dance" and powerful voice in "Walk Away." 
Troy Bolton (Zac Efron) 

He captured the heart of beautiful broinioc Gabriella while wording off the obvious advances of arrogant Sharpoy and paved the way for others at East High to break the mold as the jock-turned-singer. In the latest in­stallment, the captain and leader of the Wildcats must decide his future: play basketball at his Dod's alma mater? Or pursue drama? All while worrying about the state championship, spring musical, prom, 
graduation, and the distance between him 
and his beloved Gabriella in college. Go to ¥ 
see Efron's muscles and blue eyes in "Scream." ' 
Stay to see where Troy wil~end up. 

Sharpay Evans (Ashley nsclale) As drama dub president and the self-centered diva of East lUgh Sharpoy has one goal in mind: to become a superstar. Unfortunately, Gabrielle seems to be the one in her way again. Sharpoy is on a mission to catch the eye of the Julliard scouts and will stop of nothing to hog that spotlight. She also provides comic relief and a plethora of hot pink, crazy fashions. Her grandiose flair for the dramatic translates beautifully in her over the top duet with brother Ryan, "I Wont It All." 
Taylor McKessie (Monique Coleman) Taylor is Gabriella's best 
friend and biggest cheerleader. As the two ore yearbook editors together, 
she encourages Gabriella to jump at the opportunities Stanford is offering. 
Meanwhile she waits for oproper invitation from acertain curly-headed jock 
to prom. And what fine college institution will she be headed to in the fall? 
Ryan Evans (Lucas Grabeel) Although still adiva in his own right, over the movies Ryan has transitioned from villain to ally, and stepped out of the shadow of sister Sharpay. He won the grand prize for his choreography in "High School Musical 2" and will be back to choreograph the senior year musical. He too is vying for aspot at Julliard while dreaming of osuccessful career after gradua­tion. He shines alongside new friend Kelsi. But will his sister entice him to return to the dark side to steal the show? Grobeel is afantastic odor, singer, dancer and his solo performance in the reprise of "I Want It All" is absolutely charming.

MLB puts Series on hold until at least tonight 
Associated Press 
PIIILADELPlliA -Sooner or later, someone will win this World Series. 
Just not Tuesday night. Too wet. Besides, the baseball eommissioner went home to Milwaukee. 
Maybe the Phillies and Hays can play ball Wednesday night. But snow showers are in the forecast. 
So just sit light, folks, we'll get back to you when we can. Hight now, bad weather is turning the Fall Classic into a Hainfail Classic. 
Players and fans remained in limbo Tuesday, with Game 5 still suspended from the previ­ous night. It was tied at 2 in the sixth inning when a steady downpour turned Citizens Bank Park into a quagmire, washing away the foul lines and turning home plate into a puddle. 
The Phillies lead 3-1 in the best-of-seven matehup, mean­ing Philadelphia could be elose to winning a championship the city despPrately craves. 
Or perhaps not. 
"It's kind of like ovP.rtime in a sense, I guess," Tampa Bay manager Joe Maddon said. "Or sudden vietory." 
"It's just the way it is," he said. "There's no crying about it." 
OK, no crying here. The manager who listens to Springsteen while filling out his lineup card was real calm -he'd already lost one game at 1:47 a.m., then saw this unexpneted break forcn his Hays to relocate to a hotel 25 miles south in Wilmington, Del. 

Too late for complaining, anyway. A Series studded with big hoppers such as Hyan Howard and B.J. Upton was no longer whacky -it was down­right wacky. 
The teams are tentatively set to resume at 8:37 p.m. Wednesday. 
Since the Phillies will come to bat in th-e bottom of the sixth, fans won't have to wait long for the seventh-inning stretch. They might not even have time to get a hot dog. 
liard to tell how many peo­ple will tune in even if -for once -a World Series wraps up before kids have to go to bed. The TV ratings for the first four games dipped by 25 percent from last year. 
Tickets from Game 5 are good for the resumption, pro­vided everyone can scramble back with their soggy stubs. The Phillies' ballpark holds nearly 46,000 people and sure­ly logistics will prevent some of them from returning. 
Then again, a $160 seat in the upper deck is suddenly more valuable for someone eager to see the Phillies try to win their first championship since 1980, and the city's first major sports title since the NBA's 76ers in 1983. 
By Tuesday evening, over 50 tickets were available for resale on StubHub.com, spokeswoman Joellen Ferrer said. The prices ranged from $599 to $3,500. 
Commissioner Bud Selig, who new home for a day, was ready to return to Philly for as long as necessary. 
"We'll stay here if we have to celebrate Thanksgiving here," he said in announcing the sus­pension. 
If the Phillies win a battle of the bullpens when Game 5 resumes, llhey'll soon parade up Broad Street. If they lose, time to fly to Tampa Bay. 
Delays i.n the World Series are rare. There has never been a rain-shortened game and this was the first suspen­sion. 
There were three straight washouts in 1962 with the Yankees and Giants, and a series of rainouts set up the classic 1975 game between Boston and Cincinnati that Carlton Fisk won with a home run off the foul pole. In 1989, an earthquake interrupted Oakland and San Francisco for a week. 
While baseball purists deride Tampa Bay's Tropicana Field as an antiseptic dome that's ringed with crazy catwalks, at least wet weather isn't a fac­tor. 
Hain intruded in Game 3 Saturday night, with the first pitch pushed back to 10:06 
p.m. -the latest start time in Series history -and the last pitch came shortly before 2 a.m. 
Despite a shaky forecast, baseball tried to play Monday night. It was raining lightly at the start. Within a few innings, it was clear the showers weren't going to quit. 
"You're not going to win against Mother Nature," Phillies pitcher Cole Hamels said. 
Soon, every pitch and popup

DENTON, Texas-Fifteen North Texas football players failed drug tests conducted this fall at the request of coach Todd Dodge. 
Eighty-six players were tested from Sept. 24-0ct. 15. They were chosen by the coaching staff and were considered regular contributors to the team. The results of the testing were first reported by the Denton Record-Clrronicle. 
The school normally test.:; athletes at random, and the NCAA tested 20 players separately late last month. North Texas hasn't received results of the NCAA tests. 
Dodge said at his weekly news confer­ence that he couldn't specifY the types of drugs, but later referred to them gener­ally as "street drugs." 
"All I did was what any Division I coach has the right to do," Dodge said. "When you've been around the business long enough, you look at consistency, you put two and two together and you come up with some ideas. It was time to send a message to say, 'No."'

NCAA 
Glass takes over AD reins at IU after scandal 
Associated Press 
BLOOMINGTON, Ind. -Fred Glass has been called The Closer. Now he gets to be The Cleaner. 
Glass, who orchestrated bring­ing the Super Bowl to Indianapolis, took on a greater challenge Tuesday by accepting the athletic director's job at Indiana amid an NCAA phone­call scandal and allegations the school failed to properly monitor the men's basketball team. 
School officials are awaiting a ruling from the infractions com­mittee. 
"We're almost over the long, national nightmare, I hope, because our place is one that has always followed the rules," said Glass. "I think we can have that again." 
It's been a tough time for Indiana athletics. 
The football team just ended a four-game losing streak. The men's basketball program has the pending NCAA decision and is bracing for its worst season in decades under new coach Tom Crean. 
To Glass, however, it's a dream job. 
The lifelong Hoosiers fan spent Tuesday's news conference proudly recounting stories about pretending in grade school to be Jade Butcher, a member of Indiana's 1967 Rose Bowl team, and the vivid memory of skip­ping school to meet the Hoosiers' 1976 national champi­onship basketball team. 
With the Hoosiers in desperate nend of a fresh start, they turned to a man with long ties and a strong investment in the university. The 49-year-old earned both of his college degrees from Indiana and has served on an arts and sciences advisory board. His wife, Barbara, and daughter, Katie, are both Indiana grads, too. 
Perhaps the most significant advantage Glass had over two other finalists was his statewide credibility for doing things the right way. 
"What they really needed was somebody who could sort of restore trust and confidence and reconnect the program to its roots," said Notre Dame athletic director Jack Swarbrick, a for­mer colleague of Glass at Baker and Daniels, an Indianapolis law firm. 
The Hoosiers took a different tack in making Glass the fifth athletic director this decade. 
He has no experience in ath­letic department administration, but does have a long track record of bringing major sport­ing events to Indianapolis, devel­oping budgets and fundraising. 
He brings significant sports and political experience to Bloomington. Glass led Indy's unsuccessful bid for the 2011 Super Bowl and served as chief of staff to then-Gov. Evan Bayh in the early 1990s. From 2000 to 2007 he was president of the Capital Improvement Board, which owns and operates Lucas Oil Stadium and Conseco Fieldhouse in Indianapolis, and he helped negotiate long-term deals to keep the Colts and the NCAA's Final Four in Indy. 

Former Indianapolis Mayor Bart Peterson, who attended the news conference and credited Glass with creating the formula that persuaded NFL owners to give Indianapolis the 2012 Super Bowl, believes Glass' personality and judgment will mitigate any perceived shortcomings. 
"His judgment is remarkable. He has the ability to look at complex situations and figure out the right thing to do," said Peterson, a longtime friend. 
Glass replaces Rick Greenspan, who announced in late June that he would resign at the end of the year. 
The open-ended deal with Indiana calls for a salary of $410,000 a year, IU spokesman Larry Macintyre said. Greenspan was paid $275,000. 
"In our discussions, I was greatly impressed that Fred not only understood the challenges before our intercollegiate athlet­ics program but also the impor­tance of IU athletics being an integral part of the life of the entire university," McRobbie said. 
Glass' first task will be wiping away the stain of scandal. The Hoosiers' reputation took 

a major hit when former coach Kelvin Sampson and his staff were accused of making more than 100 impermissible phone calls while Sampson was still under NCAA sanctions for a sim­ilar scandal at Oklahoma. 
In February, the NCAA accused the school of five major violations before later reducing one to a secondary charge. 
On the day Greenspan announced his resignation, the school was hit with another major allegation: Failure to monitor. 
"I think it's almost immeasura­ble, not only for basketball but it's almost worse for the univer­sity," Glass said. "Basketball may be the easiest fix because we've got a dynamic coach. But people around the country don't like wearing IU stuff and having people coming up and making comments because of what's happened." 
Greenspan orchestrated a major housecleaning. He imposed penalties that included the loss of a scholarship for this season and a one-year extension of the NCAA's recruiting sanc­tions, got rid of Sampson and all of his assistants and restruc­tured the compliance depart­ment. Only two players are back from last season's team.

Clover Ridge Apartments 1801 Irish Way (574) 272-1441 www.cloverridgeapartments.com 
Associated Press 
BOSTON -The championship banner rose to the rafters. The tears trickled down Paul Pierce's cheeks. 
The MVP of last year's NBA Finals finally was part of a cere­mony that often seemed unreachable throughout his 10 seasons, all with the Boston Celtics. 
But on Tuesday night, before their season opener against the Cleveland Cavaliers, the Celtics' 17th title banner and first since 1986 was hoisted high above the same court where Boston routed the Los Angeles Lakers 131-92 barely four months ago in the clinching game. 
John Havlicek, an eight-time champion with Boston, carried the golden Larry O'Brien trophy onto the court accompanied by other former Celtics and handed it to Pierce. They hugged and Pierce cried. 
"As a kid, I always dreamed of moments like this," Pierce told the crowd before the first quar­ter. "You never know if this day is ever going to come. I've had a dream come true to add another banner to the rafters." 
The team's owners handed out championship rings to players before the green-and-white ban­ner was raised with several players pulling on two ropes that lifted it to the ceiling. Some for­mer Celtics were presented with rings between the first two quar­ters. 
"One team, once a year gets to have a ring celebration," coach Doc Rivers said before the cere­mony, "and we're that team because we earned it." 
The Celtics beat Atlanta and Cleveland in tough seven-game series, then eliminated Detroit in six before facing the Lakers, the team they beat for their 15th ti tie in 1984 but lost to in the 1985 and '87 finals. 
In Game 7 against the Cavaliers, in Boston, James outscored Pierce 45-41 but the Celtics won 97-92. 
"I let it go quickly," James said in the Cleveland locker room an hour before the ceremony. "I had to refocus myself to get ready for the Olympics. It was a great game between me and Paul and it was a great game between the Cavs and the Celtics." 
James and his teammates were on the court for the nation­al anthem but left before the ceremony. 
"They were invited," Rivers said with a laugh. "I wouldn't want to be out there either.... First of all, it's long. And, sec­ondly, they're giving us some­thing they want." 
It was a bright night for Boston -fans' cameras flashing for nearly the entire 15-minute cer­emony and gleaming rings made of 14-karat white gold with a total of 92 diamonds and emer­alds. The top of the ring features an emerald shamrock surround­ed by 64 pave set diamonds 
NBA commissioner David Stern had looked forward to par­ticipating in the ceremony. 
"In this game, you have the players say that you're playing for the ring," he said before it began, "and, there you are, being a part of fulfilling the goal of every player." 
Then. he added, "it's one of the few times you don't get booed

Celtics owner and CEO Wyc Grousbeck handed Pierce his ring after all the other players had gotten theirs. Pierce, seem­ing to fight back tears, held it up in his right hand as the fans roared and chanted, "MVP, MVP." Then he and his team­mates raised the banner. 
On one side of the new one was the 1986 championship banner. On the other side was a banner bearing the retired num­bers of eight Celtics.

Turns out, he was the only person booed at the ceremony. Then he opened it by saying, "Here we are, No. 17." 
And when he was done, the crowd chanted, "Let's Go Celtics." 
A brief video of Celtics patri­arch Red Auerbach, who died at the age of 89 in October 2006, got loud cheers when it was played on the scoreboard at the beginning. He guided the Celtics to their first 16 titles as coach or general manager. 
When Rivers came out to get his ring -with Auerbach's sig­nature engraved on the inside ­he put his left palm atop the tro­phy. 
The biggest cheers went to Pierce, who had won just three postseason series in his first nine years and was part of the team that managed only 24 wins the season before their champi­onship.

"It's really just repetition and repetition," Nicholas said. "And getting in scrim­mage situations and things like that to help us under­stand positions." 
That relationship was on full display Oct. 12 in a match against Pittsburgh. Despite Notre Dame's loss to the Panthers, Nicholas notched a career-high 54 assists, and Kaelin capital­ized with 21 kills. 
In her role as setter, it is Nicholas' job to run the offense on the court during the course of a match. She said her biggest responsibili­ties are calling the plays and deciding what type of set is best for a given situation. 
Nicholas credited part of her success to the fact that she had the opportunity to play with former Irish setter Ashley Tarutis for two years before taking over the start­ing role this season. 
"[Tarutis) helped me learn the offense and taught me how things were run on the court," Nicholas said. "I just went off and mimicked what I could from her." 
Nicholas and the Irish (11­11, 6-3 Big East) currently sit in third place in the Big East, tied with Pittsburgh and trailing Cincinnati and St. John's. Nicholas said that, while she had hoped for a better start, she's con­fident Notre Dame will make a run in its remaining matches. 
"I think we have done OK up to this point," she said. "We've won some big games, but we've also let down matches that we should won. If we just keep working everyday at the gym, we'll be happy with the result." 
The Irish have already lost their matches against Pittsburgh and Cincinnati, but have a matchup with conference-leading St. John's on Nov. 14 at the JACC. Nicholas, though, said she isn't worried about the teams on Notre Dame's schedule. 
"The only things we can control are on our side of the net," she said. "So we just need to come out the second half of the Big East [sche.~ule] and get the job done.

him for 10 years-from 1996­2000 at Stanford and from 2001­05 at Notre Dame. That explains the major similarities between the two teams in terms of scheme and formations, Clark said. 
"If you ask anyone, they'll always say they're very similar to us," he said. "At the end of the day, personnel dictate how things go, but I think you'll find that there will be a lot of similarities." 
With home-field advantage and a chance to guarantee them­selves a share of the Blue Division crown, the Irish are poised to erase concerns about last week's stumble. 
"Everybody knows what the stakes are," Clark said. "If you're in the last week of the season and you're playing for something very meaningful, you know it's been a good season. 
"We're in that situation, play­ing for the trophy, and you can't ask for more than that. Well, you can -you can ask to play very well -and that's our goal start­ing against Georgetown."

Junior Doug Fortner shot an ugly 10-over par 82 in his opening round before firing a 7 2 and a 7 3 in his final two rounds to finish in 46th place. Senior co-captain Olavo Batista's final-round 81 dropped him into 54th overall after shooting a 7 6 and a 7 4 to start the tournament.

The tournament -which was played at the par 72, 7,197-yard Forest Oaks Country Club in Greensboro,

golfers heading into the spring season. 
"Coming into the fall, we didn't know what to expect with [senior] Josh [Sandman] being out," Kubinski said. "We hoped to play a little better than we did, but we're very encouraged. A lot of guys are really learning, and we're expecting to bounce back in the spring and make a run at the Big East Championship."

Irish set for rematch against Big East foe Georgetown 
Hoyas come to town for midweek game today at Alumni Field

Trio of talen ted backs have combined for 792 yards on ground 
By DAN MURPHY Spans Ediwr 
So far this season, the Irish running game's only real prob­lem is one that most coaches wouldn't mind having. Notre Dame has too many talented running baeks. 

This season, junior James Aldridge and sophomores Armando Allen and Hobert II ughes have split time at tail­back for Notre Dame, rushing for a combined 792 yards on 
4.28 yards per carry. 
They have shan~d the scoring, as well. Aldridge has found the end zone three times on the ground and Allen and Hughes each have a pair or touch­downs. 
Notrn Dame coach Charlie Weis said he rotates the trio becaus1~ of the constant position battle that has gone on this sea­son. As of right now, Allen is the East, 15 points) have lost just onee in their last eight games and have moved into third in the divi­sion, two points behind the Irish (9-5-2, 5-2-2 Big East, 17 poinlo.;) and Connecticut (8-3-6, 5-3-2 Big East, 17 points), which tied Pitto.;burgh 2-2 last night. 
Georgetown could grab first plaee with a victory today, as wins earn three points and draws one point in the conference standings. A win would give the Irish 20 points and a three-point advan­tage over the Huskies, who play just one more conference game. 
Notre Dame and Georgetown each have one more Big East con­test after today's match. 
Today's match-up is a rare mid­week day game because a norovirus outbreak on the Georgetown campus caused the originally-scheduled Oct. 5 match to be postponed. 
'This game is such a big game, and it's a pity it won't be played in a better atmosphere," Irish coach Bobby Clark said. "There might not be that atmosphere, but I know our players will be very excited." 
After scoring just one goal in a pair of Big East road games last week, the Irish offense will be tested once again by a stingy Hoyas defense that allows only .58 goals per game. 
Georgetown bottled up the Notre Dame attack in a scoreless draw in last year's meeting, and the Hoyas goalkeeping duo of Matthew Brutto and Mike Wilber have combined for 10 shutouts this season. Brutto has recorded a shutout in all eight games he has played this season. 
But with the exception of last

No. 1 back for the spread-style offense and Aldridge is the go­to guy for the "pound it" pack­age. 
Hughes is the back-up for both packages. 
Weis said the one thing he is most proud of in his team's run­ning game is its ability to run the ball in the smashmouth package in recent games. He said that some teams try to stack the box against the run when Aldridge and fullback Asaph Schwapp enter the game, but that has not always been successful for Irish opponents. 
"When they know you're going to run it and you still run it effectively, that sends a very good message, because they know you're going to run it, and you're still running it and gain­ing yards," Weis said. 
Even though Aldridge did not see much playing time earlier in the season, Weis said he has played his way into a much big­ger role based on his perform­ance in practices and recent games.

It isn't Jamel Nicholas' job to rack up dozens or kills like outside hitters Christina Kaelin and Kelly Sciacca, but that doesn't mean the junior setter hasn't put up some gaudy numbers of her own. 
Over the weekend, Nicholas posted 31 and 49 assists against Villanova and Seton llall, respectively, and leads the Irish with 690 assists on the season. But the Gibsonia, 
Pa., native prefers to remain modest about her contribu­tions to the team. 
"I think I've done okay," Nicholas said. "Being the set­ter out there, I need to direct traffic and keep putting up a great set so that our hitters can get a kill." 
The 5-1 formation the Irish play is designed for Nicholas to get most of the assists, but the sociology/FTT double major still has to work to develop a strong rapport with her hitters. Nicholas said she and Kaelin arrive to practices early to work on their timing.

Scodro ties for first place 
Golfers finish fall season with seventh-place showing in N.C. 
By MICHAEL BLASCO Sports Writer 
After an uneven showing in his first collegiate tournament earlier this month, Notre Dame freshman Max Scodro's finished with a 3-under par 213 that catapulted him to a tie for first-place at the UNCG Bridgestone Intercollegiate on Tuesday. An excruciating bogey on the 72nd hole pre­vented Scodro from taking home solo medalist honors. 
Battling through 25-knot winds and a 30-degree wind­chill, the Irish squad finished in seventh place, a solid showing after a string of rough performances this fall. No. 37 Duke finished atop the stacked field of 15 with a 5­over par 869 -21 strokes ahead of Notre Dame's 890. 
Notre Dame head coach Jim Kubinski praised the mature play of Scodro and his ability to bounce back after his 78th­place finish at the Fighting Irish Intercollegiate earlier this month. 
"Max has an all-around sound game," Kubinski said. "He's fairly long, definitely one of the longer guys on the team and long for a college golfer, but he also putts well and has a great touch. He played some very good golf out there." 
Scodro scattered six birdies and four bogeys in his open­ing round to shoot a 2-under par 70 before carding an even-par 72 in Monday's late round. An eagle on the par-S fifteenth Tuesday put Scodro in the sole possession of first place, but a bogey on the 72nd hole of the tournament dropped him into a tie for the individual title. 
Sophomore Connor Alan­Lee finished tied for 24th with a 6-over par 222. After fol­lowing up his opening-round par with a 2-over second round, Alan-Lee opened his final round with a string of
