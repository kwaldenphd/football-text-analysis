Students buy texts on Internet 
Lower prices, resale opportunities draw students from bookstore

<;rumblings about the prkns of textbooks at the rampus bookstores at Notre llarnn and Saint Mary's are so common they an~ deeid­Pdly elir.lu\. 
This senwster. many stu­dnrrts continue to turn to growing numbers of lntnrnnt sitos in search of lwtter deals. Tho impact of online hook rntailing on rampus textbook sales n~mains undnar. 
Ilamnws Notre I>amo Bookstore director Sally Wiatrowski knows online sitns are beeorning inereas­ingly popular, but bdioves thn bookstorn is competi­tive. 
"Wn seareh for used books first and have the buybaek program to pass savings along to the stu­dents and rnmain price­eompntitive," Wiatrowski said. 
Wiatrowski credited the rise of online sales to stu­dents' Internet savvy. She also noted now textbook prices arn set by puqlishors "who are publishing new editions to undercut the used-book market." 
Saint Mary's Bookstore director Mike Hicks recog­nizes the competition and is interested in getting the students the books they nend at a n~asonable price. 
"Some books are over­priced, and when that hap­pens we'll recommond stu­dents to look l'or a better pricf1, but students have to realize that online they may not get the right book, espndally when a new edi­tion comes out," he said. 
Both directors stressed the importance of faculty in the textbook buying process, stating tho sooner professors tell the stores which materials students will need l'or their elasses, the better it will be for the students. 
"We have to facilitate the faculty, and order the books the professors want," Hicks said.

Tin1e to let go 

It's time to finally let go. Recently, I lost something that was a part of my life, but, after nearly two months of searching, worrying and sleepless nights, I think saying goodbye is the . 
only thing left for EriC Retter me to do. Two weeks 
Sports

Production Editor
Christmas break, my black Pacific Cyclone, the bicycle I had had since sixth grade, went missing. Although this loss meant that I had no speedy campus travel and was forced to wake up 12 minutes earli­er for class, a tragedy in itself, I was even more distraught about the terrifying experience my poor bike must have been going through. Thinking about it wandering about all alone on our cold campus or, worse yet, chained to some God-for­saken lamppost without acce~s to any maintenance and abandoned by everything it's ever known tore at my heart. Like a boy who had lost his pet, I immediately hit the pave­ment, searching out the spots on our familiar campus that we used to frequent together, but my bike was nowhere to be found. 
There's an old saying: "if you love something, set it free. If it comes back to you, it's yours; if not, it never was." Because what I set free is a bicycle and not a living being of any kind, I don't think that saying applies to my case, but at the same time, it's comforting to think that perhaps one day I could be reunited with my old friend. 
I can still remember the day it became mine. For my birthday, my mom took me to K-Mart to pick out a bicycle, and there it was, destiny. We took it home that day, and the rest, as they say, is history. 
Another thing that is history is the fact that, perhaps because of the suspect quality of their wares, that particular store stopped selling bicycles shortly after my purchase. 
To be sure, the bike had its share of physical problems. While the ubiquitous flat tires were somewhat of a nuisance, the oft-rusted chain and brakes that didn't always work were flaws that gave the machine some character and added excite­ment to an otherwise mundane ride to class. Even though the pedals had begun locking up from time to time and I realized I was the proud owner of a death trap, it's still hard to say goodbye, especially without ever saying goodbye. 
So please, if you see the bike that used to be mine going the other way on your walk from Turtle Creek or maybe lying in a ditch some­where, think of me and remember my loss. 
And if you insist on doing the "right thing" and returning it, please fix that chain first. I don't want to hurt myself again.

Fox blurs cartoon rear end on FCC complaints 
LOS ANGELES -Fox says it covered up the naked rear end of a cartoon character recently because of nervous­ness over what the Federal Communications Commission will find objectionable. 
The latest example of TV network self-censorship because of FCC concerns came a few weeks ago dur­ing a rerun of a "Family Guy" cartoon. Fox electronically blurred a character's posteri­or, even though the image was seen five years ago when the episode originally aired. 

"We have to be checking and second-guessing our­selves now," Fox entertain­ment president Gail Berman said Monday. "We have to protect our alliliates." 
Fox hadn't gotten any com­plaints about the cartoon. But the move follows the FCC's decision in October to fine 169 Fox stations $7,000 each for airing an episode of "Married By America" that showed people licking whipped cream from strip­pers' bodies and a man in his underwear being spanked by strippers.

pie to better identify and understand their surround­ings. But students also said that the sign of a person's intelligence is how one han­dles stereotypes -that is, whether stereotypes guide one's thinking about others. 
Students of both majority and minority backgrounds voiced their opinions on diver­sity within America and at the University, many noting that Notre Dame is lacking in diversity.

professor
ator noted that this statistic com­bine all other races into one. Thus, in reali­ty, whites will still be the majority. 
"I don't ever think whites will become the minority. I don't ever think they will become the majority in Niger," freshman Justin Gray said. 
Gray stressed that the statis­tic fails to take into account the power structure impeding the progress of minority groups. The political system in the United States exists to cater to the majority's needs, he added, saying that blacks were left out of the Declaration of Independence. 

Pierce, on the other hand. said that the issue is the way race functions today and not with the past. 
"Blacks were here when things began," Pierce said. "They believed themselves to 
be  covered  by  the  
Constitution."  
Pierce said that race  is  an  

elastic concept, dif'ficult to define. He emphasized that Notre Dame makes an effort to make race a non-issue in a number of ways, including random roommate assign­
ments for first­year students. 
Gray, however, 
would have to go 
back to 1842 
when this University was founded and redraw the lines," Gray said. 
Many minority students reflected on the lack of diver­sity and the need for minority students to be embraced on campus. One student said that, for her, this void was filled when she founded a Notre Dame club supporting black women called Shades of Ebony. 
Also discussed was the issue of the "black table" in the lunchroom. 
Pierce noted that he consis­tently sees the racial separa­tion in the dining hall and in other places on campus. 
"You find these clusters of people sitting together almost by ethnic groups," he said. 
One professor said that this sort of phenomena is explained by the segregation that still exists in America. Pierce drew on the words of Angela Davis, a major figure in the women's right move­ment. 
"We all may live in the same house but sometimes you just need to go to your own room," Pierce quoted. 
Minority students supported the "black table" by saying that sitting there is more about being comfortable, rather than about race. One girl, who said she is the only black student in most of her classes, argued that it is com­forting to go to the dining hall and be with other blacks. 
Other minority students added the same practices exist in dorms after the first year. One minority student selected a non-white roommate for reasons of comfort; another said the minorities on her floor formed a minority sec­tion on one corner of the hall. 
One white girl, from a most­ly black high school, said that her high school had a "white table." 
With this in mind, the pan­elists urged that students step out of their comfort zones and break down the barriers of race on campus.

"I look on Amazon.com," she said. "I don't always go with the cheapest because sometimes they are poorly edited. If we have an anthology, I try to have the students read much of it so they don't waste money."

the book­stores could have reason for conce.~;,n. Burns decided to turn to the online market this semester after the Notre Dame Bookstore wouldn't give her any money to buy back her chemistry book. 
After registering for her spring classes, Burns com­pared the prices on the bookstore's website to those on Half.com, the textbook­selling wing of eBay. She wound up buying four books through the site,· and even offset the cost by placing some of her own books for sale. She had much praise for the process. 
"These books were in great condition, all of them actually new with no high­lighting or writing," Burns said. "The sellers are given ratings, and this allows you to see if you are buying from a reliable person." 
Erin calculates she saved over $300 by using the Internet this semester and plans to encourage other students to pursue this option in the future. 
Another viable option for textbook shoppers is NDbay, 
a website 
designed to serve 
Notre Dame stu­
tator of student 
textbook sales. 

If a student wants to buy a book, NDbay e-mails both the seller and the buyer with each other's contact infor­mation. The students com­municate and arrange a sale. 
The biggest selling point for NDbay is no shipping fees, which can add up at other web site and cut into the discounts.

Supreme Court rejects terror case 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -The Supreme Court prolonged the legal limbo of hundrnds of terror suspects in a U.S. military prison in Cuba, refusing on Tuesday to consider whetlwr the gov­ernment's plan for military trials unfairly denies them basic legal rights. 
So far only a handful of' the 550 detainees from about 40 countries havf1 been charged with war crimes. More are expeeted once courts sort out how they may be tried. 
The legal uncertainty surrounding the men, many of whom were cap­tured during the U.S.-Ied war in Afghanistan in 2001, has prompted intP.rnational criticism and spawned multiple court fights. 
The Supreme Court had been asked to use an appeal by Osama bin Laden's former driver to decide whether the Bush administration is trying to shorteut defendants' rights by holding a type of military trial last used during World War II. 
A federal judge ruled last fall that Salim Ahmed llamdan and others put on trial at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base should bP. allowed to confront witnesses and see evidence against them, whieh are standard undP.r mili­tary justice rules but are not guaran­teed to detainees. 
The Supreme Court rejoeted thf1 

ease Tuesday, which was not surpris­ing beeause an appeals court also is considering the issue and has schnd­uled arguments March 8. 
In addition, the eourt heard three significant terrorism eases last year and was not expected to take on another big one so soon. 
It was a minor vietory for the gov­ernment, whieh was ordered by the Supreme Court last year to give detainees in the United States and Cuba morn legal rights. 
Since those landmark decisions, lawsuits have been f'iled in Washington on behalf of dozens of detainees claiming they are being wrongly held.

Daniels delivers first State of State address 
Governor proposes temopary tax increase 
Associated Press 
INDIANAPOLIS -Saying Indiana's finances were in ruin and in desperate need of a "fiscal repair job," Gov. Mitch Daniels on Tuesday proposed temporarily increas­ing income taxes for people making more than $100,000, freezing property tax relief payments and denying overall spending increases to schools, universities and prisons. 
Daniels, sworn in last week as the state's first Republiean governor in 16 years, said he had a constitutional duty to balance the state's pocket­book. lie said his proposals would erase Indiana's $600 million deficit by July 2006. 
"Without bold and diffieult aetion now, the lines of spend­ing and income will never cross," Daniels said in his first State of the State speech to a joint session of the General Assembly. "Tonight, it falls on me to propose a program full of steps I lind regrettable and unpleasant, but steps that I believe our duty commands if we would not fall on the poor. But Bosma, who gave Daniels high marks for the overall speech, still said, ''I'm sure we'll have a lot of reservation about the tax-increase portion of it here in the House until we know more about the lis­cal picture." 

Before the election, 23 leg­
islators  - including  16  
Republicans  - signed a  no­ 
new tax pledge.  

·Daniels adviser Mark Lubbers acknowledged the proposal could be a tough sell with lawmakers. But he said Daniels was looking past poli­tics and was nowhere near counting votes. 
"l-Ie's going to do what he believes is the right thing, regardless of the outcome," Lubbers said. 
Daniels proposed no fund­ing increases for K-12 educa­tion, higher education or the Department of Correction, and hoped to cut a projected 10-percent growth in Medicaid costs by half. He indieated that it could include cutting bene­fits, eligibility

His proposed one-year tax increase would raise the state's flat 3.4 per­cent individual ineome tax to 
4.4 percent for individuals or couples who file jointly mak­ing more than $100,000. He said the one-time "surtax" would help balance the budg­et in one year and begin rebuilding the state's depleted savings. 
"I will veto any attempt to raise general taxes on our cit­izens, and any attempt to extend even for one day the one temporary measure I reluctantly propose tonight," Daniels said. The tax increase would bring in about $290 million in new revenue. 
Republicans control both chambers of the Legislature for the first time in eight years. But the GOP's two lead­ers -House Speaker Brian Bosma of Indianapolis and Senate President Pro Tern Robert Garton of Columbus ­were adamant last week that there would be little support for a tax increase. 
Garton tempered that take after Tuesday's speech, saying it was at least a temporary tax proposal and one that 

which expires 
in July. But lawmakers relied on deficit spending and tapped dedicat­ed accounts to increase fund­ing for schools. 
Increasing basic state fund­ing for schools by just 1 per­cent in each of the next two years would cost about $150 million. Many school officials and lobbying groups have said a minimal increase in funding still might leave them unable to pay for rising enrollments, utility and pen­sion costs and raises for teachers already included in contracts. 
Daniels said his proposals were necessary because Indiana had outspent its income for years. 
Although tax collections were expected to grow over the next two years, the state still faces a projected $600 billion deficit and owes about $720 million in back pay­ments to schools, universities and local governments. Lawmakers tapped more than $500 million from pension savings accounts and other dedicated funds to prop up the current $22.8 billion budget.

"Dan may have had a failing physical heart, but he had a big and ... faithful heart," Jarret said. And though Kish 's death left a void in the hearts of many of those who knew him, Jarret said, "heav­en makes that whole." 
A small but emotional 
crowd attended the Mass, co­celebrated by J arret and Father Mark Poorman, vice president for Student Affairs. Some students shed tears, others held hands and many lingered afterward for a trip to the Grotto to light candles in Kish's memory. 
Because members of Kish's family held their own vigil Tuesday night and did not attend the Mass, J arret expressed "deep gratitude" on their behalf. Kish has two brothers -Jeff, who is a sen­ior at Notre Dame, and Tim, a 2004 graduate -and a sister, Alissa.

Bowe and her colleagues have continued using other methods to try to raise application numbers. 
The admissions office also issues an "alumnae endorsed" application wherein it mails 18,000 applieation packets to Saint Mary's graduates and encourages them to give it to a woman who they believe would be a good fit f{Jr the school. 
"When that application comes in we know they know an alum­nae and they have a little more of a perspective of Saint Mary's," Howe said. 
In recent years current stu­dents have also been asked to help and have been "given stu­dent endorsed" applications. The application fee for both types of endorsed applications is waived.

Chopra tackles world peace in nevv book 
Associated Press 

NEW YORK -It's an incongruous image: Deepak Chopra, leader of a spiritual movement that has intro­duced millions of Americans to the benefits of positive thinking, waving a cell phone in the air as he lists its capacities for destruction. 
"I could be sitting any­where in the world and move a few electrons from here, and I'll interfere with the power grid for the entire state of New York." he says. "Or I'll interfere with air traffic signals so no plane can land at JFK. What is mil­itary power going to do then?" 
Chopra hasn't snapped. lie's explaining what he sees as the ineffectiveness of con­ventional warfare in an age when terrorists can wreak havoc without a single armed troop. 
What's needed instead, he says, is a return to the ancient principle that peace begins within: Just as indi­viduals can now perpetrate mass violence, individuals must also take responsibility for creating world peace. 
That's the message of Chopra's new book. "Peace Is the Way," which offers seven daily practices that he says will create inner peace and, by extension, a more placid world. 
Is it naive to think enough people will adopt his ideas to make a difference? 
"We have to try. If you ask anybody on the street, 'Do you want peace of mind in your life and in your rela­tionships?' nobody is going to say no," he says. "Magnify that a few million times ­that's what we need." 
It's that steadfast optimism that has become Chopra's trademark. He has made a career of purveying hope, earning an estimated $10 million to $15 million by sell­ing 20 million copies of his 40 books and operating a successful wellness center in California.

His legions of fans include the Dalai Lama, former Nobel laureates Desmond Tutu, Betty Williams and Oscar Arias, and former U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, whose endorsements fill the first few pages of "Peace Is the Way." 
l-Ie has also become the unofficial television spokesman of the New Age movement, appearing on scores of TV talk shows each year, from "The Oprah 
Winfrey  Show"  to  "The  
O'Reilly Factor."  
It's  easy  to  see  why.  

Wearing a pair of rainbow­framed reading glasses and speaking in a voice that rarely deviates from a singsong cheerfulness, Chopra comes across as casual and approachable. During a recent interview in a lounge at his midtown Manhattan apartment build­ing, he is dressed in a sweater and slacks and weighs a few pounds more than the average health expert. 
True to his image as an unf1appable guru, Chopra ­who's about 58 but doesn't remember exactly when he was born -says notoriety doesn't faze him. He says he leads a normal family life with his wife, Rita, and has two grown children and a granddaughter. 
"I don't get drawn into the melodrama," he says. "I meditate two hours every day and exercise every day. Once in a while, I feel stressed, but not really. It's not in my nature." 
Another key to his success lies in his ability to make ancient Hindu teachings rel­evant to a contemporary audience, says Bawa Jain, secretary general of the World Council of Religious Leaders. 
"There are great Indian leaders who know their scriptures in depth, but the way Deepak communicates, I don't see anyone else having that ability," says Jain,

House chairman suggests changes 
Congress urged to consider altering Bush's Social Security plan 

Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -Congress should consider more sweeping changes in Soda! Security than President Bush's call for personal accounts, a prominent House committee chairman said Tuesday, possibly including dif­ferent benefits for men and women. 
Hep. Bill Thomas, R-Calif., also suggested changing the law so blue-collar laborers can receive full benefits at a younger age than office workers. At the same time, he said some provision is needed to help seniors struggling with the cost of long-term care. 
"People will live longer, they will continue to have shifting needs," the chairman of the House· Ways and Means Committee said in remarks to a forum sponsored by National Journal. "We ought to begin to restructure (Social Security) in a way that could meet the real needs instead of meeting today's political and ideological debates." 
Thomas' panel has jurisdiction over Social Security, and he will play an influential role in crafting legislation that moves through the House. 
Thomas offered few specifics in his remarks, although he spoke out against raising the payroll tax as part of Social Security legisla­tion, saying that would hamper job creation. 
Bush has called on Congress to 
give younger workers the choice 
of investing a portion of their 
payroll tax on their own, a 
change he wants made as part of 
a broader bill to strengthen the 
program's long-term finances. 
Administration officials have also 
told allies that the president's 
recommendations may include 
lowering the benefit promised to 
future retirees. 

Bush's call for changes has 
sparked concern among some 
House Republicans, fearful of 
political attacks in the 2006 cam­
paign. 

Democrats in both houses have 
signaled strong opposition to 
Bush's call for personal accounts, 
and two senators criticized the 
administration during the day. 
"Why would you decide to take it apart under the pretext of a crisis that doesn't exist?" said Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., not­ing government estimates that Social Security can pay full bene­. fits at least until 2042 without any changes. "This is an insur­ance program. The president insists it is an investment pro­
gram. It is not." 

Dorgan said Bush "has a con­
stituency that has never liked Social Security" and is attempt­ing to privatize it. 
Sen. Debbie Stabenow, D­Mich., also criticized Bush's call for fundamental changes in the program, but she said she does not believe Democrats are obli­gated to propose an alternative. "The onus is on the president," she said. 
Thomas brushed aside Democratic criticism. 
"Today we are all children of FDR," he said, referring to the president who signed Social Security into law seven decades ago. "No one is here to get rid of Social Security." 
Bush's proposals, if enacted, would bring the most far-reach­ing changes in Social Security since its creation. 
But Thomas said he wanted the debate to range even more broadly, saying, "I want as many ideas as possible on the table." 
He noted that women as a group live longer than men and said the gap is growing. If that trend continues, and more women work and their pay draws closer to equality with men, he said, "somebody might want to suggest that we need to take a look at the question of whether or not actuarially we ought to adjust who gets what, when and how."

Two million people travel to Islam's holiest sites in Saudi Arabia each year to participate in the hajj, which serves to wipe away accumulated sins.

The pilgrims begin the rituals by first drcling the Kaaba, a large black stone structure in Mecca that Muslims face during their five daily prayers. They then spend a night in the tent city of Mina, and head the next day to pray at Mount Arafat, the eentral rite of tho pilt,rrimage. 
More than a million sheep have been imported for slaughter the day after the hajj to mark the beginning of Eid al-Adha, or the Feast of tho Sacrifice.

As the situation in Iraq grows increas­ingly bleak, mired by violent interchanges between Coalition forces and insurgents, a substantive peace seems farther and far­ther out of reach. Last week, Newsweek reporters discovered Pentagon officials have Kama ria begun discussing using Porter the chillingly termed

The tactic refers to the then-secret plan sponsored by the U.S. government under the Reagan Administration to train and fund "death squads" in El Salvador during the 1980's to target opponents of the oppressive right-wing government. These "death squads" of the Salvadoran military oflicers carried out numerous crimes against humanity. 
Under their regime of terror, Salvador death squads murdered, abducted and tortured tens ofthousands of people. In 1980, as he celebrated mass, military snipers assassinated Archbishop Oscar Romero. Romero continually spoke out against the violence in his country, opposed U.S. military aid that fueled the terror, and reported human rights viola­tions in his homilies. He said. "Peace is not the product of terror or fear. Peace is not the silent result of violent repression. Peace is the generous, tranquil contribu­tion of all to the good of all." His message of hope to the poor and justice to the oppressed put him on a death list. "Death squads" have also been found guilty of kidnapping, raping, and executing four American churchwomen working with the poor in El Salvador and massacring the entire village of El Mozo~e -of which most deaths were children.

Salvadoran military was the murder of six Jesuit priests, their housekeeper, and her daughter. On Nov. 16, 1989, a group of soldiers-with orders from their superi­ors -murdered Fathers Ignacio Ellacurfa, Ignacio Martin-Baro, Segundo Montes, Amando Lopez, Joaq~n Lopez y Lopez and Juan Ramon Moreno, and Julia Elba Ramos, their resident cook and housekeeper, and her daughter, Celina Mariceth Ramos. Father Ignacio Ellacuria -the prime target -and the other priests had been working with the poor and marginalized of San Salvador while trying to bring a peaceful end to the con­flict between the factions. Yearly, people mourn these deaths at the School of the Americas protest and call for an end to 
U.S. 
sponsored terror abroad. 

U.S. 
intelligence's consideration to inte­grate the "Salvador option" in Iraq shows the persisting trend of deriving the wrong conclusion from past military entangle­ments. In El Salvador, "death squads" pro­ceeded to kill anyone -of the resistance or not -who did not support the right­wing regime. The violent silencing of prophetic voices like Romero and Ellacuria retarded the peace process while robbing the people of witnesses to God's hope for peace in El Salvador. If such a tactic is imported to Iraq, I fear a situation already plagued by violence, enmity and aggression will only increase in devastation. Also, we may lose Iraqi voices of change in the process of weeding out insurgents -as in El Salvador. We need to embrace a bold, yet even more difficult plan in Iraq. We can never eradi­cate terror by perpetuating it. Additionally, we do the martyrs of El Salvador further violence by continuing the policies that ended their lives. 


For solutions, I am drawn to the pleas of an American prophetic voice, Martin Luther King Jr, whose birthday we cele­brate this week. King called for an end to another quagmire-Vietnam, and pub­licly addressed it exactly one year before his assassination. He explained in 1967. "I knew that I could never again raise my voice against the violence of the oppressed in the ghettos without having first spoken clearly to the greatest purveyor of violence in the world today: my own government." Further, King characterized the war as an enemy of the poor in which lower class Americans were sent to destroy peasant villages in the East. while money that could eviscerate the urban and rural poverty in the United States was being used to create a "hell for the poor" in Vietnam. 
King spoke of the force of nonviolence ­an active stance of empathy that compels us to use constructive policies, open com­munication, and dedication to a peaceful end. Today, King's voice calls us to address the problems in Iraq without hubris or ulterior motives, and admit that-as in Vietnam, El Salvador and other nations ­we were wrong in the invasion and occu­pation. The path of nonviolence may shriek in our ears only because it is hard, but it is the only way to preserve our soul of democracy and bring peace. We must shift policy or as King warned, "we shall surely be dragged down the long, dark, and shameful corridors of time reserved for those who possess power without com­passion, might without morality, and strength without sight."

lETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Are you committed? 

I am a graduate of both the law school (1998) and the Alliance for Catholic l·:duention pmgram (2004). I currently work as a seventh and eighth grade lan­guage arl'i teaelwr at Saint Anthony School in South Bend. Hecently. while teaching the eighth graders an introduction to philosophy using the book "SophiP's World," 1 a'iked the studnnl'i if they bdieved that the world could be bettPr. They responded by saying "yes." Yet, when I asked them what they were doing to show tlwir eommitnwnt to a bdtnr world, they had no answers. They rould l'asily state how tlwy did things evnry day to show their commitment to sporl'i, but tlwy could not show their commitment to creating a better world. Whtn askld what was mon important. a bettl)r world or bning better at a sport. llwy all imnwdiatnly stated "a bnttnr world." 
After this discussion, we discussed a few ways in which they could show their c:ommitnwnt. Somn of the student-; came up with the idea of "Kuddles for Kids," a driVl' to rncPive donated stull'cd animals to give to the childrnn atlected by the tsunami in 1\sia. 
Latllly, we have been diseussing what others could do to show their commit­mont, and we carne up with another idea. This idea involves you, the students at Notrn Dame. What if you were all to give up going out for just one Saturday. What if instead of going out and spending your money on that one Saturday, you instead gavn it to an organization that would distribute it to those in need (for instance, giving to an organization that helps those afl'ccted by the tsunami). Think of the amount you could raise in just one day! 
IL only takes one student at Notre Dame to be committed to this idea and pass that commitment on to others for it to grow exponentially. If you think about it, it n~ally is a simple idea. one night given up to help others who really need it. Just imagine if the idlm caught on at other campuses around the United States. 
Just IL.'ik yourself if you arc committed to a belief in a better world.

No WMD? So what? 
Ilow short the American memory is. It was not that long ago when we collective­ly mourned 3.000 dead Americans. 
It was not that long ago when most of us wanted Saddam Hussein disarmed, dethroned and dishon-Chuck ored as the tyrant that Prochaska 
he was. not defended. 

Today. for true University of Americans. those emo­Illinois tions live on. Daily lllini 
Last week, I listened in my car for two hours to the liberal media blowing smoke at Americans who supported the war, alerting us to the ofli­cially "failed" search for weapons of mass destruction, one of the president's central justifications for the war. 
The war in Iraq was fought to remove a brutal dictator who had the desire and ability to attack the United States and its allies at whim. without notice. Period. 
The fact that Saddam had moved and destroyed all of his WMDs in time to evade U.N. weapons inspectors and U.S. troops should not award him the clear­ance of international law or the sympathy of freedom-loving Americans. 
A popular liberal argument against the war in Iraq is to claim that the only rea­son we went to war was to disarm Saddam of WMDs and not because he was an evil dictator who oppressed his own people. This. however, is not true. For instance, President Bush's speech declaring war on Iraq on March 17. 2003. "In a free Iraq, there will be no more wars of aggression against your neigh­bors, no more poison factaries, no more executions of dissidents. no more torture chambers and rape rooms. The tyrant will soon be gone. The day of your libera­tion is near." This was a clear statement justifying a war to remove a hateful des­pot, with no mention of WMDs. 
Saddam had a history of developing WMDs and would not disclose his involve­ment in illegal programs to the United Nations. If he would have said, "No, real­ly guys, come check it out-I'm clean," and the inspectors were allowed to do their job, I wouldn't be writing this col­umn. 
lie used WMDs bPforP, which means IH' had the w'ill and capacity to delivtr tlwm again. Saddam had PXIJcutnd over 200,000 Iraqis using chemical weapons shortly before the 1991 Gulf War. Imagirw if a single Saddam-funded dirty bomb was detonated in the United States. It's a shame how liberals love to sacrifice dead Americans for self-incriminating Muslim 
tt~rrorists. 

It really doesn't mattnr that WMDs were not found in Iraq. Saddam was too smart to leave them lying around in a nation about to be taken over by U.S. troops. Several reports issued shortly after the commencement of Operation Iraqi Freedom disclose the location of assorted WMDs with Iraq's name on them. If anything, these reports, hidden by the liberal media, are 11vidence to advance the war on terror. 
The fact that WMDs were not found in Iraq is a testament to American intelli­gence and resolve. In the midst of a glob­al uprising against American values, we were diligent enough to stop the ring­leader before he could get started again. May we always have the courage to defend our great nation against Islamic terrorists-at whatever cost.

Decency is not so common anymore 
One of my classes last semester was a survey of American fiction that showed me the proeess of evo­lution in the way we think about ourselves. 
Americans are a unique bunch when compared to the rest of the world. The last novel we studied was "Slapstick" by Kurt Vonnegut.

saying there is not enough com­mon decency in our dL-;tinctive society. I have to agree with him. 
I suppose the disadvantage of being older than most of my instructors L'i that I have become less tol­erant of pPople and the rude, stupid things they do. I let mysnlf get irritated with the groups who stand in the middle of the hallway between classes making everyone walk around them. Once, I actually said in a loud voice, "Unbnlievable! All that education wasted on people who refuse to sec they are the problem!" If anybody out there remembers that day, I apologize. 
I have to apply Vonnegut's complaint to myself. lnstlmd of doing what I did above, the decent thing to do would have been to ask rhcm calmly to move to the side and let the rest of us go by. The decent thing they could have done WIL.'i to be aware of the others in the hall and not block the way. What I am describing here is a simple fact; none of us is the center of the universe and we should always act with that in mind. If we could all just be decent to each other, most of the problems of society would disappear. 
/\pply Vonnegut's postulate to driving in rush-hour traffic, one of my pet peeves. I tend to be aggressive, irritable and judgmental of all the other drivers. The preferred attitude is to be polite, to use what I call "highway etiquette" so that everybody can get to their destinations safely and on time. To tell each other our intentions, use the equipment that all vehicles have, the turn signals. If another car is overtaking you, move over to the right. These are all simple things, but they are very hard to do if we are not in the habit of being decent to the others around us. 
Where is this leading? Any person can program a new behavior in themselves with conscious attention within 30 days. In other words, in that insignificant amount of time, I can change from the crusty old cur­mudgeon I was last semester into the lovable little fuzzball that I want to be. I think this should be the desire of every student on campus. If we can just be decent to each other on a moment-by-moment basis, there will be no need for the disciplinary boards we saw last year. In my own life, this will be vital since I will have more responsibility at the Signal and am taking more classes than I ever have. All the writers who send their columns across my desk this year will know that whatever corrections I make to their work, I do so with their future in mind. 
I will apply this program to my writing as well. But don't think that I will pull any punches when they are necessary. I invite anybody who wishes to communi­cate with me this semester do so knowing you will be treated with respect and decency.

A new-w-ave of unity 
While the South Asian tsunami quickly took its toll and receded, the subsequent waves of grief and sympathy continue to surge across the globe. The widespread tragedy continues to affect our world and our community, and global-minded Georgetown stu­dents have responded with a noble and effective collaboration to 
offer an outlet for charitable giving and partici­ 
pation in the relief and recovery processes.  Staff Editorial  
A new inter-organizational movement is  
starting on campus to provide relief to those  Georgetown  
affected by the recent calamity, bringing togeth­ University  
er existing clubs and their members and using  The 1/oya  
their collective energy and concern to focus on  

the common mission. Georgetown Unites for South !\sian 1\id aims 
to create a forum for each club to cooperate on project-; through­
out the semester. This group sponsored its ftrSt fund raising and 
awareness-raising event at 4 p.m. Tuesday in Sellinger Lounge. 
In a world fraught with man-made and natural disasters, Georgetown may be called on again and again to open il'ieU' to the suffering of others. The new committee offers a blueprint for part­nership and efficiency in planning students' reactions to such events. At a time when campus groups often come into contention with each other and campus discourse can turn divisive, a prece­dent of cooperation and inclusiveness is a much-welcomed change. 
The vast ramifications of last month's tsunami present a host of vital issues for discussion and exploration in Georgetown's clao;s­rooms. Georgetown prides itself on its international focus and tra­dition of charity and social justice, and the tsunami provides the university with an ideal opportunity to put these ideas into practice and make a real difference in a time when aid is needed most. Professors and students should take the opportunity to engage each other on the relevant issues generated by this global tragedy. 
While no amount of money or aid will ever fully relieve the pain felt by many in the coastal areas of South Asia, Georgetown h<L.'i the ability to mitigate some of this suflering by facing the disaster with open hearts and a unified purpose.

New exhibits in the Snite provide glimpses into the cultures of Vodou, East Tennessee and the American penal system 
By MARIA SMITH Scene Editor 
The next time you aren't quite sure what to do with your hour break between classes, you may want to wan­der into the Snite Art Museum and take a look around. Turning into the ontrance of the Snite, in the great hall of O'Shaughnessy, will give you a chance to see some interesting works and artifacts. 
During the last two weeks the Snite has welcomed three new exhibits offer­ing particularly unique cultural insights to students who take a few minutes, or even a few hours, to wan­der through the on-campus museum. 

Haitian Vodou Arts 
Vodou is one of the most famous reli­gions to grow out or the dispersion of Afrkan cultures through the Western hemisphere. It is often represented, and misropresented, in popular cul­ture. The Vodou flags and artifacts in this exhibit offer a real glimpse into this frequently misunderstood religion. 
The flags, at least two of which are kept in every temple, are devoted to dii'I'Prenl "laws" or deities, of lhn reli­gion. The men, women and symbols representing deities are depicted in colorful headwork and sequins, as well as braiding and occasional chromolith­ographs used for the faces of the deities. 
The Bags also show cultural overlap that might be of particular interest at Notre Dame. The flags come from a country where, according to the Central Intelligence Agency, around 80 percent of the population is Homan Catholic but roughly half of the country practices Vodou. Vodou sometimes bor­rows images from other cultures and religions, and many 11ags use Catholic imagery to represent Vodou "!was." These images do not reflect their usual significance in Catholic culture. The image of Moses on one flag represents a doity with power over snakes, a trait which Moses also shared. The Virgin Mary appears as well, but represent Erzulie Freda, the goddess of erotic love. Visiting this exhibit might spark some interest in the culture of the Caribbean island country that it came from. 

"You're Not From Around Here" 
Every photographer needs inspiration, and Mike Smith finds his in the streets and back roads around Johnson City, Tenn. "You're Not From Around Here:" photographs of East Tennessee offers a glimpse at these back roads, including the buildings and people that surround them. Smith captures buildings, backyard swing sets, panoramic views and people in their homes in a way that reflects the lives of the peo­ple alongside the land in which they live. 
The images might be famil­iar to anyone who has driven through that sort of back­country and small towns of any state. Smith captures the sort of things that give many places in America their char­acter, but that people might not commonly remember they noticed in passing through the place. "When I'm driving along, if I find myself turning my head to keep looking at something, I know it's time to stop the car and get out my camera," he recently explained in a press release. Much of the "Art From the Inside" exhibit consists of pen drawn handkerchiefs, but some 

pieces, such as "Erzrulie Freda Banner, ca 1970," are composed of sequins. 


Art From the Inside 
It isn't often you can get a glimpse into a life this different from the one you live. 
"Art From the Inside: Drawing ('Panos') by Chicano Prisoners" is a sample of almost 120 drawings on handkerchiefs created by Chicano pris­oners in jails and penitentiaries in the American Southwest. The drawings take the form of messages to parents and loved ones outside the prison, prayers or personal narratives, each one telling a different story. 
· The tradition of the drawings dates back to the reign in Mexico of the Austrian emperor Maximilian; French soldiers and bureaucrats imprisoned in Mexico sometimes sent letters and drawings on handkerchiefs back over­seas. The tradition inspired their fellow Mexican prisoners, and the practice spread through the penal system. The tradition is important to many prison­ers, who use the drawings as an outlet for their innermost thoughts and many cherished images. The drawings create their stories through images that vary from the Aztec calendar stone to the Virgin of Guadalupe to the past loves of one prisoner's life. 

Many earlier "paii.os" were drawn on bed sheets and other linen with foun­tain pens that easily tore the cloth, and have not survived. Drawn with fountain pens in the 1950s and '60s, if discov­ered, the prisoners were punished for doing the drawings. Nowadays the drawing of "pafios" is more easily facil­itated, with linen cloths and ballpoint pons being sold to many prisoners, a practice that began in the 1980s. Most of the "pafios" that are in the display are from the 1990s. 
"Art From the Inside: Drawing ('Panos') by Chicano Prisoners" will be open until Feb. 27. "Haitian Vodou Arts" will be on exhibit until March 6. "You're Not From Around here: Photographs of East Tennessee" will be open until March 13. 
The opening reception for the winter exhibitions will be held on Sunday beginning at 2 p.m. Smith will give a lecture on his exhibit, followed by gallery talks from Douglas E. Bradely, curator of the Arts of the Americas, Africa and Oceania. 
The Snite Museum of Art is free and open to the public. 
"Blountville, TN 2003," pictured above, is just one of the many colored photographs by Mike Smith in the "You're Not Contact Maria Smith at From Around Here" exhibit at the Snite Art Museum. msmith4@nd.edu

Highll'nn short studnnt f'ilms arn 
being featured, but to sec all of them you'll need to go to two separate screenings. Eight of tho films are on the block at every sereening, with the other 10 split between tho 7 p.m. and 10 p.m. shows. Pull out tho old scientif­k calculator and you 'II realize that's 13 films per screening. For $3, how can you go wrong'? 
All thn lilms are thn work of the tal­entnd and incredibly crnativo students in tho department of l'ilm, television and theatre. They wnrn made as proj­nets for elass during the past year. You'll see a good mix of serious and humorous l'ilms at this year's Student Film Fnstival. 
"Ellen, Sara, Sh<wn & tho Hnst of' Us," is a film by Sarah Cunningham and Ernin Grigg about a bar in Pittsburgh that usPs a midget as an attraction to bring people in on ·Monday nights. "Piston Envy" is a hilarious documen­tary on auto shows in Mishawaka by f'ilmmaknrs Monika Mehlmann and Bailey J:rtel. 
On the morn serious and introspee-


live side, llat.tie Lim givns us a film called "Near the Equator," which "explores a relationship bntwPnn t.wo friends and takes tho audience with them on their journey whieh is not quite ready to end." From Deacon Bruno conws "Dissolvn," a film that. fol­lows a man as he visits his childhood homos. 
The first Notre Dame StudPnt Film Festival was held in the basement of' McKenna llall, f'or an audience of 75 people. Tho next year it was moved to the Snite Museum of Art. where it remained until the renovation of the Carey Auditorium inside llesburgh Library a f'ew years back. 
The completion of the DeBartolo Center has ushered in a new era for the festival and the entire FTT depart­ment. Tho number of FTT majors has gone from 150 to 215 in one year -a 43 percent increase. 
The Browning Cinema boasts TIIX certified sound and stadium seating. The venue is a drastic improvement from the Carey Auditorium. 
"It's the real thing," said Ted 
Mandell. a llll'mlwr of' thn l'ilm and video production faculty. "Our students will get to sen tlwir l'ilms shown in a statn-oJ'-thn-art motion pic~turn ciJH'nHt for tho lirst tinw and it's vory nxciling." 
While tho Browning Cinnma only seats 200 eomparnd to the Can~y Auditorium's 2(d, thP additional screenings oiTnredwill actually allow morn peoplo to sew tlw Fnstival this year than last. A little ovnr 2,000 attonded tlw 15th annual Notre~ Danw Studcmt Film Festival. while around

"I just try to go businoss as usual. You know, I think people kind of around tho game notice it a little bit more than I would."

But she played superbly on tho summer hard-court circuit to return to No. 1 and, in a wide opnn draw, believes she can win her fourth Slam Lillo­and first sincn thn 2000 Australian Opon. 
II' her start was any indica­tion, she's over a nagging knee problem and a bout of bronchi­tis that limited hor prnparation for Melbournn Park. 
A potentially tough first­round match against 1994 Wimbledon champion Con­chita Martinez. who'd beaten her six times at majors, turned into a mismatch. Davenport won 6-1, 6-1 in 48 minutes, tying thnir hnad-to-head record at S-ail and leaving Martinnz looking morn likn the player who started the tournament with an illness. 
The 32-yoar-old Spaniard won only seven points in the second snt. 
"She's given me a lot of fits early in my carom·," Davenport said. "It's so odd -there's not many people that I could play in tho first round that I pon't have a winning record against." 
Venus Williams, who won the last of her four majors at the 
U.S. Open in 2001, defeated Eleni Daniilidou Greece 6-1, 7­

"I didn't have the best rhythm ... but I played OK, I think, when it r·oally matterod," the eighth-seeded Williams said. "At. the 5-all gamos, I really picked up. I think it was good for me to got to that because then I was able to play bettor." 
French Open champion Anastasia Myskina had only four errors in the first sot but lost her last thrP.e serviee games in a 6-1. 6-4 defeat of Kveta Peschke. 
She joined Hussia's two othor Gra"nd Slam titlists Wimbledon winner Maria Sharapova and U.S. Open champion Svetlana Kuzno­tsova-in the second round. 
Joining her compatriots was sixth-seeded Elena Dementieva, the runner-up at the French Open and U.S. Open. 
Sharapova and Kuznetsova are back in action Wednesday, although Kuz-netsova was busy off the court dealing with a doping charge. 
She joined WTA Tour CEO Larry Scott in a sharp rebuke of Belgian regional sports min­ister Claude Eerdekens, who announced that the Russian player tested positive for tho stimulant ephedrine during a 
-

charity evP.nt last month. 
While the common ingrndient in cold medicine is on the bannnd list during compntition. it's not off-limits during thn oiT­snason. 
"I pride myself on being a elean athlete or tlw higlwst. integrity and am oiTnndnd by those disgraeel'ul allngations," said Kuznntsova, who passnd at least 11 doping tests last SPa­son. 
Scott called the announcn­ment "prnmaturn, highly irrn­sponsible and damaging to thn sport," and said he doubts Kuznetsova will bo pnnalized. 
On Tuesday, Eerdokens defondod his docision to identi­fy Kuznetsova, oven though a backup test hasn't been done and other stops in tennis' anti­doping ruins weren't follownd. 
"I did my duty. All of my duty," Ecrdekens told Thn Associated Pross in an inter­view in Belgium. 
"International tennis should be happy that wo try to show that tonnis is a dean sport."

NHL 
League officials to meet in Chicago for talks 
After 125 days without professional hockey, last-resort meeting could save the season despite late start for players 
dynamic but I don't think it's atypical or abnormal at all for these types of discussions to be occurring," Daly said. 
Linden didn't immediately return several phone messages left for him. 
Daly will join Hotchkiss, a Calgary Flames part owner, and outside counsel Bob Batterman in representing the NHL; Linden, NHLPA senior director Ted Saskin, and out­side counsel John McCam­bridge will take part for the players. 
Linden isn't bringing a new proposal with him and he isn't looking for great attention. It wasn't until late Tuesday that word filtered out that the meeting would take place in Chicago. 
Saskin said the players won't present a new proposal Wednesday but added that the union is "committed to reach­ing a fair deal that does not include a salary cap." 
Daly has maintained that the owners aren't prepared to make a new offer, either, since they put forth the last one. 
"Nothing has changed at this point," Daly said. "A lot will depend now as to what hap­pens tomorrow whether that changes the dynamics in any material way." 
There have been no talks since Dec. 14. It was then that the sides sat down for the sec­ond time in six days after not meeting for three months, but any optimism was lost quickly. 
The players presented a pro­posal that offered an immedi­ate 24 percent rollback on all existing contracts, but since it didn't provide cost certainty it was rejected by the owners. 
A counterproposal was then presented by the NHL. Once the players' association saw that the offer included a salary cap, it was turned down imme­diately.

What's more interesting about the meeting is who won't be present. 
Linden reached out to the league by inviting Harley Hotchkiss, the chairman of the NHL board of governors, to sit down and talk without NHL commissioner Gary Bettman and union head Bob Goodenow in the room.

Associated Press 
NEW YORK -With nothing to lose but the rest of the hock­ey season, Vancouver Canucks forward Trevor Linden thought his idea was worth a shot: 
Get together a small group of representatives from NHL management and the players' union and try to find some middle ground that would jump-start talks toward ending the 125-day lockout. 
That is, try to do what previ­ous, more formal negotiations couldn't. 
And so on Wednesday, six people -three from each side -will meet in Chicago for this very purpose. Failure to pro­duce even some movement, likely will signal the end of any hopes that the season can be saved. 
Through Tuesday, 655 of the 1,230 regular-season games were canceled as was next month's All-Star game. 
"I don't think [Wednesday! is necessarily the last chance," Bill Daly, the NHL's chief legal officer told The Associated Press on Tuesday. "I do think we're in a critical period, there is no doubt about it. I think we not only need to make progress but move toward a resolution and come to a reso­lution very soon in order for there to be hockey to be played this season."

Don't Let the Semester Slip Away 
by FR. RICHARD WARNER, CSC 
Director ofCampus Ministry 
Now that the busy fall semester is behind us, and winter has settled in, we have a chance at the beginning of the semester to set some priorities for ourselves tor the rest ofthe academic year. While the temptation may be great to stay in the residence halls or our off-campus apartments as much as possible, at least during the week, this really is a good time to get around to th!ngs that may have been on your "to do" list tor a long time. We have a sense that the spring semester can really drag on, and anyone who has spent time on campus knows what the "forty days of February'' can be like. 
But Lent is just three weeks away, the work is already piling up, and after Spring break and Easter, the semester will rush to a close as it always does. 
Notre Dame offers all its students many oppor­tunities to develop and strengthen their spiritual lives. There are few places where more possibilities are available, and no place where young people take their Christian faith more seriously than they do here. 
This semester, Campus Ministry offers a wide array of retreats, from our traditional ones such as the NDE and the Freshmen Retreat, to special time designed especially for different groups. These retreats include offerings for Senior ROTC cadets and midshipmen, the Women's Retreat, the Man's 
for gay and lesbian students and their friends, to 
mention just a few. 

Theology on Tap will return January 26 fbr six more sessions and Four:7 (Christian Music & Prayer) begins again every Wednesday night at l 0:00 
p.m. Emmaus groups will continue to form and meet. Campus Bible Study, on Matthew's Gospel, is back, and will take place every Tuesday night begin­ning January 25 in 316 Coleman-Morse with time for discussion and fellowship. 
Any member of our staff would be happy to speak with you personally about these programs. We have lists ofexperienced men and women who serve ac;; spiritual directors. 
But please do not let the first weeks ofthe semester slip away, as you know they have a ten­dency to do. Notre Drune is a community ofschol­ars and a community ofbelievers. Take advantage

BIG EAST BASKETBALL 




St. John's upsets Pitt in 65-62 underdog victory 
Orangemen hold off Hoyas in overtime

-
Associated Press NEW YORK -The list of why St. John's 65-62 victory over No. 21 Pittsburgh on Tuesday night was big was a long one. From it being the first Big East win for first-year coach Norm Hoberts to it snapping a three­game losing streak of which the last two were dose ones. From it letting the Red Storm better last season's win total to it being one where they lost a big lead but found a way to pull it out in the final 25 seconds. From the postgame celebra­tion on the court to the giddi­ness in the locker room later, it was big. "It was a terrific basketball game and it was one I think our players really deserved to win based on what they did the last two weeks," Hoberts said. "We've been coming close but coming up short. Tonight, for Pittsburgh, the ball bounced off the rim instead of going in. We never gave up even when things didn't go right for us." Daryll Hill scored 26 points, including three free throws in the final 25 seconds, for St. John's, which lost close road games to West Virginia and Notre Dame to extend its losing streak to three games. Hill, who had career highs of 29 and 30 in his last two games, only had three points over the final 15 minutes but they were enough to give the Red Storm (7-7, 1-3 Big East) their second win this season over a ranked team. The last game before the los­ing streak started was a 63-45 

'EAATJVLKa 

victory over then-No. 17 North Carolina State, also at Madison Square Garden. 
"In those other games we stayed close but we knew we had the talent," said the sopho­more who is leading the Big East in scoring with a 20.5 aver­age. "We showed everybody we can play with anybody." 
Carl Krauser had 22 points, seven assists and eight turnovers for the Panthers (12­3, 3-2), who had won two in a row after dropping two straight at home. 
"We put ourselves in a hole and weren't able to fmish it off," said Jamie Dixon, who led the Panthers to the Big East title last season as a rookie coach. "We are obviously not where we want to be as far as how we are playing." 
St. John's, which has won eight of its last 10 against Pittsburgh, opened the second half with a 16-6 run to take a 52-41 lead with 13:37 to play. 
That's when the Red Storm started to struggle against Pittsburgh's 2-3 zone. The Red Storm went 8:18 without a field goal and the Panthers went on a 15-2 run to take a 56-54 lead with 6:08 left. 
Lamont Hamilton broke the field goal drought with 5:15 to play, tying it at 56. 
"Give them credit. They did a great job with the zone of mak­ing it tough for our big guys to pass it out and then our guards got a little frustrated trying to make something happen," Roberts said. "We stayed strong. When we had to get stops we got stops." 
Krauser made two free throws with 1:39 to go to give Pittsburgh a 62-59 lead, and the Red Storm tied it for the last time on a three-point play by Dexter Gray with 48 seconds left. Those were Gray's only points of the game. 
Hill and Gray double-teamed Krauser into a turnover on the next possession and Hill was fouled. Ile made two free throws with 25 seconds left to give St. John's a 64-62 lead. 
"When Carl took the second dribble, we trapped it and I grabbed the ball and got it to Daryll," Gray said. 
Syracuse 78, Georgetown 73 

Given a reprieve by Brandon Bowman's size-17 feet, Syracuse made sure surprising Georgetown didn't pull off another upset on the road. 
The Hoyas won at Pittsburgh and Rutgers, threatened at Connecticut before falling 66-59, and were coming off a last-sec­ond win at Villanova, and Bowman nearly made the sev­enth-ranked Orange the next victim. 
But when he hit a jumper from the top of the key with 2.3 seconds left in regulation, his feet were barely on the 3-point line and it left the score tied at 67, forcing overtime. Syracuse then scored the first seven points of the extra period and held off the Hoyas 78-73 for its 11th straight victory. 
"Thank God he was on the line," said Gerry McNamara, who scored 17 points and made five 3-pointers to run his career total to a school-record 251. "We knew we were going to play a tough team." 
The victory kept Syracuse (18­1, 5-0 Big East) atop the Big East, but Georgetown (11-5, 3­
2) gave the Orange their tough-

est game of the season despite serious foul trouble for its top three scorers. 
Hakim Warrick had 25 points and 11 rebounds, Josh Pace had 13 points, and Craig Forth had 10 points and 10 rebounds, his first double-double of the sea­son, for the Orange. McNamara was 5-for-12 on 3-pointers and broke Preston Shumpert's school record for 3-pointers by two. 
Syracuse took charge early in the overtime. Louie McCroskey hit a 15-foot baseline jumper to start the biggest run of the game for either team, McNamara drained a 3 from the right cor­ner after Bowman missed two free throws, and Warrick sailed in alone for a resounding one­hand slam dunk after a turnover in the lane by Jonathan Wallace. 
That gave Syracuse a 74-67 lead, the largest for either team in the game. 
Wallace atoned with his fourth 3-pointer of the game to pull the Hoyas to 74-70 at 2:34, but McNamara, who had seven assists, hit a push shot in the lane and Warrick converted two free throws with 7.1 seconds left to ice it. 
Bowman, who was whistled 


G-reat Food! 
for his fourth foul with 5:31 left in regulation, just shook his head in dismay afterward while lamenting his big feet. 
"I saw an opportunity and knocked it down," said Bowman, who scored 19 points before fouling out in the final seconds. "I thought it was a 3, but I guess my shoes are too big. I wish I was a size 14." 
It was so close the officials looked at the replay before rul­ing it a two-pointer. 
"We wanted to put the ball in his [Bowman's] hands and let him decide," Hoyas first-year coach John Thompson III said. "I thought he was behind the line, but the replay showed he wasn't." 
When Syracuse blitzed the Hoyas in the overtime, Thompson's first visit to the Carrier Dome turned into a bit­ter disappointment. But it might have started to rekindle what once was one of the fiercest rivalries in college basketball when his father prowled the sidelines as coach for 27 years before retiring in 1999. 
''I'm kind of sorry Coach Thompson is back at Georgetown," Syracuse coach Jim Boeheim said with a smile.

Associated Press 
NEW YOHK -Hoger Clemens followed a record­setting season with a reeord-setting salary request. Erie Gagne, another Cy Young Award winner, got a big deal, too. 
After winning his seventh Cy Young Award, the Hockot asked for $22 mil­lion in salary arbitration Tuesday, easily topping the previous high of $1S.5 mil­lion by New York Yankees shortstop Derek Jeter in 2001. 
(:lemons, who still hasn't deeided whether to pitch this year or retire, was offered $13.5 million by his hometown llouston Astros. The $8.5 million differenee was exactly double the previous record spread, set by the Yankees and Jeter. 

"We lookf~d at what some of the comparables were -Greg Maddux, Handy Johnson -and we tried to use those star-quality play­ers to eome up with a number," Astros general manager Tim Purpura said. 
Bather than swap figures with the Dodgers, Gagne agreed to a $11) million, two-year deal with Los Angeles that eontains a club option for 2007. Gagne, the 2003 NL Cy Young winner, has the

PITTSBUHGII -Alan Faneea must be trying to motivate Ben Hoethlisberger again. 
The offensive lineman said the Pittsburgh Steelors badly need Hoethlisberger to up1-,rrade his play for Sunday's AFC championship game against New England, after the rookie quarterbaek's errors nearly led to a playotl" loss to the New York Jets. 
"lie's going to havn to piek his game up," Faneca said Mmiday. "Wn're all going to have to pick our game up, and it's going to take our best ell"ort of the season to win this wonk." 
Hoethlisberger, the NFI:s Offensive Hookie of tho Year, threw two intnrcep­tions -one for a touchdown and anothnr creating Doug Brien's poten­tial game-winning field goal try -and got nothing going as the Jets seored 17 eonsecutive points in thn seeond and third quartnrs. 
Tho Steolnrs camn back to win 20-17 in ovnrtime Saturday, but only al'ter right to void the option year, however, and become a free agent. 

Clemens was among 40 players who exehanged fig­ures with their teams, a group that included Astros outfielder Lance Berkman and AL Cy Young Award winner Johan Santana of the Minnesota Twins. Gagne was among 30 play­ers who agreed to deals before the exchange. 
In addition, tho Cubs and catcher Michael Barrett agreed to a $12 million, three-year contraet after swapping proposals. 
If he deeides to play, Clemens could have the highest salary for a pitcher 
in a season, topping tlw $17.5 million made last year by Boston's Pedro Martinez. The Yan kl)eS' Handy .Johnson has the top salary among pitchers next year, caleulatnd at $1 (>.5 million, including a pmrat­ed sharn of tho $1 million personal-snrvkns contract hn signnd with Arizona before he was tradnd to Now York. 
Clemons, 42, left the Yankees aftnr tho 200:{ season and intended to retire. But after fornwr teammate Andy Pllttitto signed with tlw Astros, Clemons was persuadml to sign with his hometown dub.

PHOENIX -After limping home from an 0-4 road trip, the Phoenix Suns thought they would have Steve Nash baek in the lineup Wednesday night against Memphis. Then Nash had his foot stopped on in Tuesday's practice by his backup.

Those family, he's been successful," pointedly answered "No" "We've got to seize this opposing sideline. things have a way of staring team president Art Rooney II when asked if the Patriots' opportunity," Cowher said. 
Cowher, the Steelers' coach since 1992, has won more reg­ular season games and divi­sion titles than the Patriots' Bill Belichick -and just as many playoff games. When the two went head-to-head in the same division for four seasons from 1992-95, Cowher won three division titles to Belichick's none. 
Amid the one-sided compar­isons is the singular statistic that explains why Belichick is the resident wizard among NFL coaches, and Cowher is considered to be merely among the elite. 
Super Bowls won: Belichick 2, Cowher 0. 
And it's not just winning football's biggest game that's been the problem -Cowher is 0-1 in the Super Bowl -it's getting there. This is the fifth time since 1995 the Steelers have staged the AFC title game, yet they have won only once and were upset three times as a favorite. 
Can't win the big one? Seems the problem has been more like can't-win-the-one­before-the-big-one. 
"I want to win a champi­onship," Cowher said, res­olutely, aware his career will seem incomplete unless he raises the Lombardi Trophy. "It has been a void that has been there." 

-
Void? It's been a Grand Canyon-sized crater, especially ·because he is one of only two Steelers coaches in 36 sea­sons, yet is clearly the least­accomplished. Chuck Noll might have won only two play­off games in his final 12 sea­sons, but he is still the only coach to win four Super 
you in the face at the end of a football game." 
Sounds like a simplistic answer for a complex man ­one who trails only Joe Gibbs, Bill Parcells and Mike Holmgren in playoff victories among active coaches, yet is the only one of that group without a Super Bowl title. 
Cowher dismisses the notion his teams were unprepared ­read "outcoached" -but it's evident the Steelers have altered their approach since losing 24-17 to New England in th~ AFC title game in January 2002. 
There's not a sliver of a chance Cowher would allow a Super Bowl rap video rehears­al this week, as he did 10 years ago. He also hasn't said one word about Super Bowl plans, as he did in 2002 -a miscalculation the Patriots turned into a motivational tool. 
The Steelers' minimalist plan is to focus every bit of attention on that day's prac­tice or that week's game, never once daring to look behind or ahead. It's the old one-game-at-a-time tactic, and it's worked perfectly for 16 o.f 17 games. 
"We realize the magnitude of the game, but you don't devi­ate from what you've done to get here and we're not going to do that," said Cowher, who decided not to alter practice or meeting times this week. 
Cowher adopted the approach during training camp, when he eschewed pre­vious amenities such as a day at the movies or stopping a practice early because he liked what he saw.

"Clearly his No. 2 objective was, without saying it so much, the Sears Cup," White said. "It's important for everybody to know that I just didn't wake up here one day and say, 'Let's be top-H) or top live,' that it was an objective that was clearly articulated when I came to Notre Dame." 
White also said progress is still being made in the fall sports, especially with the con­struction of a new football facil­ity, the Guglielmino Family Athletics Center, set to be com­pleted this fall.

seconds later when Dan VeNard scored his first colle­giate goal. 
However, as the second period continued, the Huskies pulled away. 
Michigan Tech's Nick Anderson made the score 3-2 on a power play goal at 7:57 when he ripped a slap shot from the left circle. 
At 11:46, the Huskies' Ryan Markham scored off of a rebound of a Malcom Gwilliam shot to increase the lead to two goals. 
The third period was more of the same from Michigan Tech, as the Huskies added two unanswered power play 
goals to turn what was a good hockey game in the early sec­ond period into a blowout by the end of regulation. 
Anderson scored his second goal at 15:26 and Brandon Schwartz scored at 19:25. 
After Saturday night's loss, Irish coach Dave Poulin expressed his feeling that the Irish had played a great third period of hockey and would love to run with that into the three non-league games this week. 
''I'd rather have kept going tonight and played another couple games tonight," Poulin said, after Saturday night's loss. 
Instead, the Irish were unable to capture that same intensity for a full three peri­ods of hockey, something that has plagued the Irish all sea-son. 


Going into Tuesday night's game, the Irish were being outscored 30-10 in the third p11riod. The two goals in the final period against Michigan Tech were consistent with that statistic. 
Despite giving up six goals, Morgan Cey had 33 saves for the Irish.
