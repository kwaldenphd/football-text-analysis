Iraq claims key victory over invading Iranians 
Associated Press 
NICOSIA, Cyprus -Iraq said yes­terday it won the biggest victory of the three-year war by crushing an Iranian attack and driving Iranian forces back across the border near the southern city of Basra. 
"Iraq's flag was hoisted at the last fortified position held by the Iranians at the Iraqi village of al Beidha ... and all enemy forces have been crushed except for those who surrendered," a battle commander said in a cable to Iraqi President Sad­dam Hussein. The contents of the cable were aired by the official Iraqi News Agency. 
Iran had no reports on action near Basra, Iraq's second largest city; Iraq said more than 30,000 Iranians were killed in three days. 
The claims could not be indepen­dently verified. Western reporters are not allowed in the war zone. U.S. officials also could not verify claims but have determined the fighting is escalating fast, said a State Depart­ment source in Washington who asked not to be identified.

Construction of the Shaheen­Mestrovic Memorial Park on the west side ofO'Shaughnessy Hall will begin in May, and the project should be completed by August, according to officials at the University's physi­cal plant. 
A gift of Ill 00,000 from two long­time benefactors of the University, Mr. and Mrs. Eli Shaheen of Sturgis, Mich., will be used to construct the park and conversation area. 
Frederick Beckman, chairman of the Art, Art History, and Design Department, designed the park more than a year ago, but the project Samaritan Woman at the Well," by Ivan Mestrovic, the noted Yugos­lavian artist who taught at Notre Dame between 1955 and his death in 1962. 
The sculpture is one of Mestrovic's best known works, and a copy recently was molded for dis­play in the Vatican Pavilion of the upcoming New Orleans World Fair. 
Extensive landscaping, erection ofa retaining wall and two conversa­tion areas for use by students in fair weather are included in the plans. The other Mestrovic statues, of St. Luke and St.John, now located at the main entrance to O'Shaughnessy Hall, also will be moved to the new mini-park.

"If the rules that presently exist were uniformly entiJrced, much of the problem would disapp:ar," said the HPCs statement. 
The Council is encouraging en­

forcement ofdorm party room rules 
and more parties co-sponsored by 
male and female dorms to even the 
ratio of males to females, alleviating 
the problem of going to parties sole­
ly to drink. 
Other suggestions included in the 

responSt: are allowing only beer and 
wine at parties, striving to sponsor 
one non-alcoholic event each 
weekend through Student Activities, 
encouraging the llniverisity to open 
up more social space for non­
alcoholic events, and instituting a 
set of rules disciplining continued 
"drunkenness" by a student. 


Potok 
continuedfrom page I 
Potok said the job of the writer was "to create worlds out of words on paper." But first, one must enter the apprenticeship of the writer which means "reading and writing and reading and writing and reading and writing some more ... you must make the great ones your teachers and live with their works." Accord­ing to Potok. the writer must then ask himself what he calls, "4 o'clock in the morning questions." 4 o'clock in the morning questions are, "the kind of questions you can only . answer at 4 o'clock in the morning, questions like: What am I doing here? Does my life have any real meaning? What am I willing to go to the barricades for?"

It wa~ thl·y who were "hounding" him. It wa~ they who were "attacking him." It wao; they who were "harassing him." It was they who hall threatened him and his family. Asked who the "they" were, Jackson collapsed into vaguencs.'i. Nevertheless, he said that the cam­paign against him was "too orchestrated to be accidental," and he blamedJews "in gcnual." 
The sad fact is that there hao; been a cam­paign against Jackson hy some Jews. One of them is the notorious Rabbi Meyer Kahane, a z<.·alot who was even too much for former Is­raeli prime mm1ster Mcnachem Begin. Kahane hao; been arrested in Isreal and is an anathema to the American-Jewish com­munity. Countles.o; Jewish leaders have 
denounced him and his vitriolic and hateful 
campaign againstJackson. 
Jackson, though, made no mention ofthese denunciations. Instead, he accused Jewio;h leaders -and the media -ofa conspiracy of silence. saying that the acts and the alleged silence have produced a "climate." So far, he said, he hao; turned the other cheek, refused to condemn or strike back, but others are neit­her as patient nor ao; forgiving. Sooner or later, he said, someone will retaliate. 
I listened to all this in disbelie( What was startling wao; not that a presidential candidate thought this way, but that he would talk this way. Lots of people engage in group-think. They see an individual -Jackson, Kahane ­and see something else, a race, an ethnic group. To them, everyone is a representative ofsome group to which they were born. This is the essence of prejudice-the reason why to the white bigof the black mugger represents most blacks while the black sch<X>l teacher is an exception. 
In fairness to Jackson, he did not carry hi-; argument t<i its ultimate conclusion. lie refused to claim or cite an actual Jewish con­spiracy, pointing out that there arcJews in his campaign and that, at any rate, he lacked any evidence of collusion. But he did confuse the tactics of a Kahane with legitimate political criticism and concerns, stirring it all into a pot to which he affixed the label "Jew." What was clear was that Jackson was not clear. lie is either a man drift ing into prejudice or a man coming out of it. 
This is why I think ofSmith. He said that he had been shaped by where he wao; born and hi-; environment. He wao; a small-town boy from the South, and he wa~ big enough to ad· mit that there were many things he did not know. Others condemned Smith for anti· Semitism. He had a better explanation. lie condemned himselffor ignorance. 
Maybe that is the case with Jackson. lie is, after all, a man who has spent his life battling for civil rights. And when he talks of the problems of women, of blacks, of lfispanics and of the handicapped, it's hard to believe that all of that could be consistent with prejudice. So I think ofSmith. I only wishJack­son would think ofhim, too.

Tht·re won't lw any platlilrms nenlnl this year. no nl'l'd for the carnival of demol·racy. till' political convention. Instead. have thl· rl·altor extend till' kase at 1600 Pl·nnsylvania to indudl· the timr year option on the ka.'il' hlTaU~l· it is all 0\'l"f, folks, Ronald Reagan has won. 
In casl· you Wl'fl' not aware. till' Dcmol·rats have recently embarked on their quadrennial folly to find a banner bearer for the party in the pn·sidential election. 

<>nly this year, it should be viewed ao; a con­ll'St to sec who Reagan will have the privilege and plcao;un· ofdefeating in Nm·ember. If the lkmocrats hold to their course of rdging mediocrity. Reagan is a hando;-down favorite in his hid for rl·-decton. 
While many would argue that Reagan still fal.TS such problems as the gender gap. the black vote, and the budget quagmire. the l'Vidl·nl-c: points to Reagan being the first in­cumhc:nt re-elected since Richard Nixon in 1972 due to his politkal savvy and, as some critics would charge, his luck. 
Rl·agan is not only the consummate politician in a JX·rsonal way. combining his ac­ting instincts and quips with an apple pie aw-shucks attitude, but also in a bureaucratic fashion, as seen in his structuring ofthe White 
!louse. 
A main factor in his success hao; been his 
ability to delegate responsibility so he is free 
to direct his attention where hepleao;es. 
WhileJimmy Carter lived in the Oval Office during the hostage debacle in Iran, trying to oversee every detail and ultimately going snow-blind with facts, Reagan is taking a dif­ferent posture towards thing.-; so that during the week of the Marine pullout of Lebanon and the death of Andropov he vacations in California content to let the Secretaries of State and Defense orchestr.lle U.S. strategy and responses. For better or worse, this at­titude seems to work. 
Hut could it be, a'i some <.·hargc, that Reagan's succes.o; and apparent ability hao; only been a result ofthe so-called Reagan luck? Pos­sibly, hut that seems a bit fur-fetched. After all, the successes are too numerous. No, the at­tack seems more to be one of sour grap<.-s on behalf of the Democrats than a statement of truth. 

The fact is that Reagan, despite what the critics predicted three years ago, hao; firmly established himself The Democrats would be wise to regroup for 1988 and avoid a repeat­ing humiliation of 1980. Not only are the Democrats without any major campaign issues, but they seem content to pick a can­didate from a plethora of bores who will pale in comparison to the glib Reagan. 
Ijke it or not. this is the television age where boredom io; the first criteria of~low rating.-; and cancellation. So pull up ,.our favorite chair, grab some snacks and r~lax. The Ronald Reagan Show hao; been renewed.

DearEditor: 

It is indc.-cd -a shame that the.· Askew cam­
pOJign has dtTml·d it necessary w flproach 
l'OnSl·icntious and dedicated Republicans for 
their hard work in bringing about a new coali­
tion ofconservative interests. 

Given, however, that the Askew campaign 
is, after all, a Democratic organization with 
Democratic motives, I am not surprisc:d by 
1heir recourse to schl·mes dt-signed to mis­
lead Rc.·puhlicans into furthering selfish, 
Democratil' gains. 

"N.D. Conservatives for the Right Stuff" are

Looking for top-ten finish 

SMC swimmers ready for NAIA 
By KATHLEEN NICHOLSON 
Sports Writer 
Aftt.·r completing their first win­ning st.·ason in swimming history with a 4-_3 record, ten members of the Saint Mary's team will travel to Arkaddphia, Arkansas this weekend to compt.tt.· in the 1984 NAIA Swim­ming and Diving Championships. 
Last year the Belles managed to place an impressive thirteenth out of a field of approximately forty-nine teams, and the much improved team hopes to fare even better this year. 
"We are considerably better than last year," said Coach Scott Trees. "Our goal is to finish in the top ten at nationals and, more importantly, to improve all ofour times." 
The individual team standouts are senior captain Gail Casey, senior Rosie Whalen, sophomore Amy Studer, and freshman Kathleen Ken­nedy. 
These individuals are supported by an impressive group of relay teams. Heading the relay teams will be junior freestyler Ellen Byrne, ac­companied by sopi:Jomores Anne Cushing and Joyce Murtagh. Fresh­men Julie Gschwind and Margaret Manion also will contribute their talents in their first taste of national collegiate competition. 
"The returning swimmers have gained confidence and are working harder than ever," coach Trees said, and the new swimmers have filled the gaps created by the loss of 16let­termen in 1983." 
Although the qualifying times for this year's competition have dropped considerably, the in­dividual swimmers and the relay teams have been seeded very well for the upcoming meet. 
Casey, who is by far the greatest swimmer that Saint Mary's ha.~ seen, is seeded in the top five in four 

encers

( normallly)." 
DeCicco believes that, after the Junior Olympics in Portland and with minimal practice, his "junior" fencers were not properly prepared to go to Illinois. Nevertheless, the Irish were able to rebound and go undefeated overall in the men's competition. 
"I do know this," said DeCicco, "We're going to have to get serious this w t eek ifwe're going to expect to do anything (in the championship tournaments in March)." 
Coach DeCicco's women's fen­cing team also enjoyed some success on Saturday, as they took two out of three matches in Illiois to go 13-S for the year. 
The Irish had no trouble downing Washington, 16-0, and Purdue, 15-1, but came up short against highly tauted Wisconsin, losing 9-7. 

Freshman foiler Pia Albertson ( 3 7-2 on the season) was a perfect 6-0 Saturday. Also unbeaten was sophomore Janet Sullivan, as she went 4-0, moving her record to 21­
I2. Senior co-captain Sharon DiNicola (25-16) and freshman Cindy Weeks (20-13) each went 4-2 for the day. 
Both Irish teams will be in action Saturday morning at the Notre Dame ACC Fieldhouse where they will host the 1984 Great Lakes Cham­pionships. Top competition from across the Midwest, including last year's defending Great Lakes cham­pion and national champion, Wayne State, will be vying for an automatic birth into the men's NCAA tourna­ment to be held on March 20-21 at Princeton.

events (SO-, I 00-, and 200-yard free, and I 00-y.ard IM ) in her final col­legiate competition. Her classmate Rosie Whalen is also seeded well in her two individual events -the I 00-and 200-yard backstroke. The duo, accompanied by veteran Amy Studer, should he able to guide their teammates to the top-ten finish they want so much. 
Studer, in her second national competition is also seeded in the top five in her four individual events and should produce some exciting times. 
Following in the upperclassmen's footsteps, Kennedy, having broken several varsity records this year, will test her talents in the I 00-and 200­yard butterfly at nationals. 
The relay rosters, as of now, are quite tenative. Coach Trees has been doing some last minute juggling to assure himself of five optimum teams that will yield a maximum number of team points. Since relay scoring is twice that of the in­dividual events, Trees is being ex­tremely careful when composing each relay team in hopes that his squad can boost themselves into the top ten team finishers. 

With the season going as well as it 

has for the Bel .les, a top-ten placing 
would seem an appropriate finish for 
the 1984 squad. Trees and his up­
perclassmen have been working 
hard the past two years to build up 
the Saint Mary's swim program and 
establish the school as a dominant 
force in the NAIA conference divi­
sion, and, with any luck, 1984 will be 
the beginning of a long line of suc­
cessful swim seasons for the Belles.

'lltc Notre Dame men's fencing team cndnl its regular season at Il­linois over the wcckt:nd as the Irish took four straight to end up 19-1 on the sc.:ason. 
lltc Irish downed three Big Ten opponents in Wisconsin, 22-S; Il­linois, 20-7; and Purdue, 23-4; and took Washington ofSt. Louis in a 27­0 whitc.:wash. 
"We started offthe tournamc.:nt by losing our very first two houts against Wisconsin, which put me in­to a little hit ofa st:arc," commc.:nted Irish head coach Mikt.· DeCicco. "But the team really sucked it up, and the next thing I knew, the score was 14-2." 
"I wao; impressed with the way our sahn: tc.:am fenced," continued DeCicco. "We fenced without the services of John Edwards ( 27-1 on the season), and the lineup of Mike Janis, Tony Const>li, and Don 
Women's swimming 

Irish do well at championships 
By ERIC SCHEUERMANN 
Sports Writer 
Although it may not appear so at first glann·, the Notre Dame womt·n's swim team actually pcr­forml'd very wdl this pao;t weekend 
in  thl'  Midwest  lndl'pendl'nt  
Womt:n's  Swimming and  Diving  
Championships.  

Aftn all points wt'rl' totalled, Coach Dennis Stark's swimmc.:rs finished in the middle of thl' pack. taking sixth place in the fidd of l'lcvt:n. Thl' Irish were able to win only thrt-e of thl' evl'nts in which tht·y were l'ntered. 
Still, the meet was no failure for the tl'am. In fact, according to Stark, the swimmers accomplishl'd a l'reat dl'al more than wao; expected. 
··t wao; well plt-ao;ed," he said. "Since we won the North Star Con­ference meet the week heforc, I didn't know what to expl'ct. It had hecn a tough three-day meet, and I thought we might not he ready for another meet so soon. I had mixed emotions, but ao; it turned out we rl'ally swam well." 
The most impressive part of the weekend meet wa-; the number of Johnson fenced well for us." 

On Saturday, the sabre men were .:H-1, moving their squad's mark w 164-23 for the year. Junior captain MikeJanis ( 40-3) was a perfect 10-0 against the weekend competition. as wao; sophomore Tony Consoli ( 28­
2). 

"DonJohnson ( 3S-6) wao; the only one to lose a bout (going I0-1) and that augurs well," said DeCicco. 
In the epee, Junior captain Andy Quaroni led the way with a perfect 9-0 performance to move his record to 34-3 on the year. 
"Andy Quaroni rcaJiy bounced hack (after two losses to Wayne State) and he fenced three young men who arc very good fencers in the epee," explained DeCicco. "He came out undefeated -he had a nice afternoon." 
Freshman John Haugh ( 29-8) and sophomore Urian St. Clair (31-9) also had good outings, going 9-1 and 7-2, respectively, in helping the epee squad move its record to 146­
nt·w varsity records set by the 
women swimmers. Eleven new 
marks were set, a remarkable nom­
her considering that only twenty 
events were held at the meet. Stark 
wao; especially pleao;ed with these 
records. 

"llte competition was keener, so 
we didn't win often. That was ex­
pectl'd. Whenever the kids can set 
new records, it shows they swam 
wc.:II, and it makes me happy." 

The most exceptional performer 
for the Irish over the weekend wao; 
freshman Suzanne Devine. She wao; 
the victor in Notre Dame's only 
three wins in the meet, and, in addi­
tion, she finished first in one prelimi­
nary heat. 

In thl' process, she set new varsity 
recordo; ofS7.79 seconds in the 100­
yard huuertly, 2: I 0.83 in the 200­
yard individual medley, I:09.50 in 
the I00-yard breaststroke, and 
2:06.1 S in the 200-yard hutterfly. 

"It's very encouraging," said Stark, rcfcring to Devine's performance. "It makes me feel better when someone can come in and do some­thing like that. Three firsts and four record-; are very impressive." 
Many other SWimoners also per­41 on the year. 
lltc foil squad ( 139-48) enjoyed some success also, a-; sophomore Dave Reuter (22-8) led the team with a perfect 7-0 mark. Senior cap­tain Chris Grady also continued in his winning ways, going 10-3, to move his record to 29-12 on the seast>n. 
Two of Notre Dame's top fencers, however, enjoyed a little less success in the foil. Freshman Charles Higgs-Coulthard, leading the Irish in wins with 43, was 4-3, as he equalled his previous number of losses to go 43-6 on the year. Freshman Mike VanderVelden, who proved to be the best Junior Olympian in the U.S. last weekend in Portland, was S-2, moving him to 32-8 for the seast>n. 
"He (VanderVelden) absolutely had no control of distance and time," said DeCicco, "I know that he would eat somebody like that (his opposition) up for lunch 
see FENCERS, page 6 
formed extraordinarily well. Karen Kramer set new varsity records in both the I00-yard and 200-yard backstroke. Julia Boss acquired the t record for the SO-yard freestyle, leading off the 200-yard free relay. Monica Walker swam a strong race in the 400-yard individual medley and set a record. 
lltree more varsity records were set by the Irish rday teams. The 200­yard freestyle relay team set a record of I:42.04, while the 400-yard team of the same discipline broke the old mark with a time of 3:4358. The 400-yard medley reb.y team met with similarsuccess, settinga record of4:10.82. 
Although none of the above produced Irish victories, they still were very impressive races for the swimmers. 
The Midwest Invitational wa-; the last action of the seast>n for the women's swimming team. Having achieved a victory in last week's North Star Conference Meet and many impres.o;ive performances by young swimmers during the past year, the future looks very good for !Wotre Dame women's swimming.

Dayton last obstacle for Irish before NIT 
huck Freeby 
Irish Items 
Hello again, everybody! 
Well, with a record of 17-10 and an NIT bid all hut sewn up, it's 
time to shift this seast>n into cruise control and not worry about this 
week's contest with Dayton, right? Wrongo! This Saturday's game 
with the Flyers is important to the Irish for two reao;<ms. First ofall. 
this is a big rivalry hetween two successful Midwestern Catholic 

schools. Second, and more importantly, th t e Irish would love to have 
some momentum as they head into the NIT, and a win over the 
Flyers would certainly supply that. 
However, the task won't tx· an easy one, ao; Don Donoher's club 
has proven they can play with the hest, heating teams such a<; DePaul 
this year. lltis one will he a dandy. 
Troubles in Paradise ... O.K., mayhe Dayton is not a city you 
would call a paradise, and it certainly has not been one for Notre 
Dame basketball teams. The A tartan floor, lxJisterous crowds, and 
good Dayton teams have given the Irish all they could handle in 
recent years. 
Some great Irish teams have heen handed stmnd defeats at the l JD 
arena For example, thl' 1973-74 squad Oohn Shumatl', Gary 
Brokaw, Adrian Dantky, etc.) took a 24-1 record into the final game 
ofthe seast>n at Dayton and wao; blown out, 97-82. The 1977-78 team 
which went to the Final Four came offa win over Marqut·tte only to 
lose by seven points to a Flyer squad which included Jim Paxstm, 
(>6-59. Sure, the Irish have won their share ofgames in Dayton, but 
the liD arena can be a real house ofhorrors. 
1970: Carr's Finest Hour ... It wao; not a house of horrors on March 7, 1970 when Austin Carr put on thl' finest individual scoring display in NCAA toumaml'flt history. llte Irish crushed Ohio, I 12­82, but the real story was Carr. l11c junior guard from the nation's capitol was all over the court, scoring61 points, includinga 2S-of-44 shooting performance from the floor. It wao; far and away one of the finest displays of individual bao;kethall ability ever givl'n hy a Notre Dame player. 
After producing three years of high-scoring games such ao; this one, it is no wonder that Carr holds nearly every scoring record in the Notre Dame record books. It alst> io; no wonder that after witnt·s.<;­ing pl'rformances such ao; this one, many students belil'ved ACC stood for Austin Carr Coliseum. 
Flyer Follies ... Dayton coach Don Donohcr ret·ently became the winningest coach in thl' school's history, and he attributed that fact to S<>me ofthe "great" players that attl'nded the university. One ofthose great players is seniorswingman Roosevdt Chapman. oneof the nation's top scorers thio; season. Currently, Chapman averages 
21.1 points per game, while averaging 9.3 rebounds an outing. 
The Flyers also have several quality players to make a strong supporting cast. Center Ed Young (he scored the game-winning bas­ket against DePaul) averages nealy IS points pergame, while sopho­more guard Larry Schellenberg directs the Flyer attack from hio; point guard slot. 
As mentioned earlier, the Flyers have been tough on the Irish in past games at the liD Arena Thio; year hao; heen another banner seast>n for Dayton at home, ao; it has posted a 12-2 record in its ver­sion of the friendly confines. Considering the problems the Irish have had on the road this year, it seems they l'ertainly have their work cut out for them this week. 
Irish Odds and Ends ... When the Irish try to get the job done this weekend, they will have to do it without a pair of their best worker t s. Phelps ha-; decided to rest Tim Kempton and JoJo Buc­hanan another week, wisely deciding not to risk an aggrevation of their leg injuries on the tartan surface in Dayton. 
The Irish have done nicely with their n·maining talent. Of<:ourse, the excellent performances of Tom Sluby have heen well docu­mented already, but they overshadowed a brilliant week by fresh­man Donald Royal. The 17-yl'ar-old from New Orleans, who is quickly becoming a fan favorite, showed hl' can rl'ally sky with a vicious slam (all that wao; miss t ing on his flight to the bao;ket wao; the movie and "Fao;ten Seat Belts" sign) and thrl'e blockl'd shots against Marquette. 
And let's alst> give st>me credit to the Irish hench, which hao; come on strong in recent weeks. GuardsJoseph Price and Scott Ilicks have each made fine contributions in the la'>t few gaml's, and they will need to keep it up for the Irish to succeed thio; weekend. 
Pick ofthe Week ... What's thl' matter, sports fan? You say you want to go to the hockey and bao;ketball games thio; ~eekend, but you can't make it back from Dayton in time on Saturday night? Well, s t rand up and cheer, because WSND-AM has come to your rescue. They will broadcast the Dayton game live on Saturday afternoon, aJiowing you to listen to the game in the afternoon and attend both sessions ofthis weekend's hockey tournament. 
Which brings me to the pick for this week: Lefty Smith's Irish leers. They will be hosting the CSCHI. Playoffi; on Friday and Saturday night in the north dome ofthe ACC. Friday evening, Iowa State and Marquette faccoff in the opl'ner at 6:00, while the Irish and Illinois State clash in the nightcap. Saturday evening, the losers meet at S:OO 
p.m.. and the winners meet for the championship at 7:30 p.m.
