Where The Game Is Played 
This is where the game is played. Where you hit and shove and grunt and eat that dirt and learn what it's like to take a three-point stance in the snow. 
If you're on the Notre Dame offensive line, you do something else, too. You make holcs ... big holcs ... really BIG HOLES, in fact. 
Irish co-captain George Kunz, playing his last 
game in ND stadium today, discusses the role of 
an offensive right tackle on page 6. 
George Kunz .... 



.... fires off the ball toward his Iowa Hawkeye foe .... . ... and stands him upright with a powerful block.

Irish Offense Leads Nation 
NEW YORK (UPI)-For one game at least, Notre Dame didn't miss Terry Hanratty at all. 
With Hanratty on the sidelines last week, sophomore Joe Theisman took over the Irish attack and piled up 550 yards against Pittsburgh in a 56-7 rout to enable Notre Dame to take over the national lead in total offense. 
The Irish rolled up the big total even though Coach Ara Parscghian, enjoying a 49-0 halftime lead, had the Irish stay on the ground throughout the second half when they didn't throw a pass. 
Notre Dame now leads with an average of 5 21.6 yards per game while Houston is second at 
518.6 and Yale isthirdat474.7. 
Notre Dame, which plays Georgia Tech this Saturday, winds up its season Nov. 30 against Southern California­and that may be the game in which the Irish will miss Hanratty, who's out for the year with a knee injury. 
Notre Dame, which is tied for the scoring lead with Kansas at 
40.1 points ter game, is well ahead of the all-time total offense record of 487 yards per game by Nevada in 1948.

Grid Picks 
To rework an old saying, took it in the eye last week. 
Not entirely my fault, though. First attempt at this job and they hit me with all those upsets. I low did I know three of the Top Ten teams would lose? !low could I know Georgia Tech's net rushing against Navy would be minus three yards? How could I know Kansas State would score its first Big Eight win in four years? 
Actually, the final chart wasn't that bad-32 right, 13 wrong, one tic for a percentage of .711. But I blew my lunch on most of the important games. And for that, I think I deserve a little hate mail. Right, Joel?

'VVhilst I Slept Last Night... ' 
(t'ditor's Note: While most everyone else was taking the 1/anratty injury seriously, Ohserver sports writer Mike Pav/in implanted his tongue firmly in his cheek and came up with this piece.) 
By MIKE PAVLIN 
Whilst I slept last night I was awakened by an Angel of the Lord who spoke unto me, saying "Come, for you arc wanted by the Most High God'. And he took me by the hand before the Throne of the Lord. And around the Throne was a great Light, brighter than a thousand suns, and I was not able to look upon it. And I was .xcrcdingly afraid. _ : And. from the Light came a mighty Voice crying: ''Thus saycth the Lord: Know ye that many years ago when your people were sore distressed, they called upon Me ~n their torture. They cried out to be delivered from 
I ' 
the cttrse of the Wildcat, from the scourge of the 
Boilermaker they asked relief. And I heeded their call, 
for they had moved My Ilcart. And I went down and 
appeared to YOUR HEAD, called TED. And I made to 
him a cov(\nant. 
"And I ·sent among you from the Land of Parseghian, 
a man called ARA, who was exceedingly just and stood 
upright in the sight of the Lord. And I raised up others 
like I lim, RAY, YONTO, SHOULTS, PAGNA. And they 
built a great team to rid you of your foes. And they 
raised up leaders like IIUARTE, SNOW, HARDY, 
LYNCII. CONJAR, and EDDY. And you became a 
powerful team and your enemies could not prevail 
against you. Neither could ye be threatened by the 
Army or the Navy. Came they from the air or on the 
land and you smote them. And I didst open for your 
runners great holes in their lines and you scored full 
many points. 
"But know yc that I am exceedingly wroth, for' ye 
have turned against Me. Ye have revolted against your 
leader, the honored TED. Ye have hidden in your rooms 
great stores of strong drink, and nightly revel in sin. Ye 
have not heeded My words against loose women, and ye 
have invited them into your very rooms. And ye raise up ·false leaders and give praise to false gods. 
"Know yc that the Lord God has struck against you. 
Your quarterback, the venerable Tllll have I struck 
down lame. Naked ye shall strive against the 
Yellowjacket. Cowering shall ye face the horrible OJ1 
leader of the terrible Trojans. And ye shall have only a Jerseyman to fight them. 

"But know yc that this is not the end of my wrath. For ye must turn from your sinful ways. Lay-off strong drink or I shall cripple the ARNZEN. Put away the Harlot or I shall destroy the CARR and the CATLETT. Heed the words of the Lord, lest your enemies triumph over you. THUS SAYETII THE LORD" 
And I was terrified in the sight of the Lord, but He said unto me: "Be not afraid, but return to thy people and preach unto them. Exhort them to turn from their sinful ways, that they may yet be saved. Urge them to repent lest they fall from the TOP TEN. 

This was the scene last Saturday as Hanratty spent the afternoon along the sidelines on crutches. Chuck Nightingale, right, also is out for the season, suffering from a severely bruised shoulder.
