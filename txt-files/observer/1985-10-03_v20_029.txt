Michigan tailgater causes Dillon Hall to forfeit next SYR 
By MARK PANKOWSKI 
CopyEdttor 
Dillon Hall forfeited one of its SYRs and must do a community service project as a result of a "private tailgater" in Ann Arbor, Mich., on Sept. 14 which included the hall's fight song and bright red flag, Dillon Hall President John Hus­mann said. 
The pre-game tailgater, which was not sponsored by the hall, "appeared as a Dillon gathering so it appeared as a Notre Dame gathering," Hus­mannsaid. 
"Because of the flag raising and the fight song, it appeared it was a Dillon Hall event," he said. "That was the reason for (the University's) 
response. 
The tailgater wa~ attended by ap­proximately Ic;o students, half of whom were not Dillon Hall resi­dents, he said. 
"I think that if the flag had not been raised then it would have been considered a private party and everything would have been fine," he said. 
John Goldrick, associate vice president for residence life, would not give specific details why the Office of Residence Ufe had levied the punishment, but did say the mat­ter "was not dealt with as an alcohol policy violation." 
"It was because of other matters discussed with the rector and the hall president," Goldrick said. 

Correction 
Because of a reporting error, an article in yesterday's Observer gave incorrect dates for the stu­dent leadership conference sponsored by Notre Dame stu­dent government. The con­ference will take place Oct. 11, 12 and 13. The Observer regrets the errors. 
Several complaints about the tail­gater were made to "high-ranking University officials," according to FatherJoseph Carey, Dillon Hall rec­tor. 
"People from Michigan and wit­hin the University complained," Carey said. "There were a lot of reports to the University .... It was a well-known fact around (the Univer­sity) that there was this tailgater." 
Husmann questioned whether the University should have the authority to punish the hall for a tailgater that occurred in Michigan. 
"I think whether the University's authority reaches that far really should be looked into," Husmann said. "I don't believe there was a precedent. That's why I think this should be looked into." 
Carey, however, said a precedent had been set in 1983 when a Notre Dame senior almost was expelled for his actions in Florida during spring break. 
"The question came up (at that time) that if you're claiming to represent Notre Dame, does your behavior have to be a certain way?" Carey said. "(The University) said yes, especially if you paint yourself blue and gold and paint Notre Dame on your forehead. 
"There is an expectation of nor­mal human behavi'or when you go to Michigan or Purdue or wherever," he said. "When you go somewhere you should show some class." 
Goldrick and Ann Firth, director of residence life, consulted with Carey and met twice with Husmann before making the decision on what punishment was appropriate, Goldrick said. 
The result of the consultation and the meetings, Carey said, "was Dil­lon had to forfeit its second SYR of the year and do a significant com­munity service project."

Genetic engineering a positive step toward eliminating diseases 
Genetic engineering. 
It simply means rearranging a few chemicals on a DNA chain. But wrapped up in that simple process are both wonderful possibilities and unspeakable horrors. 
Until now, the concept of changing the genetic makeup of humans has been only a fantasy out of B· grade science fiction movies. But in 1985, for the first time it is becoming a reality as geneticists at various universities finally are getting the government clearance and the background knowledge they need to begin the first actual gene experiments on humans. 
"But wait!" the public cries. How can we fiddle with one of the most intimate parts of our humanity · the characteristics we are born with? How can we trade away our natural Identity in order to guarantee our health? 
Even worse, what if the research gets out of hand? What if someone decides (very humanely) that they want to prevent hemophiliacs from being born? Or that the world would be much better without any deformed or mentally hand­icapped people, filled with "better" humans who are strong, intelligent or blond? (Some critics even point to the grisly experiments of Hitler's Germany, and note the possibility of government-sponsored selective human breeding. 
But many of these people 0 fail to realize a critical dis­tinction. Under fierce public scrutiny, the National In­0 stitue of Health has adopted strict guidelines for genetic experimentation. And under ~~ UE/IIJHDI.T these guidelines, experi­ments are allowed only on ordinary body cells, never on reproductive cells. In ot­her words, only a patient's allected genes (say, in the bone marrow)will be recombined, and there will be no way he can pass the new genes on to his children. 
"Ifyou think about it as therapy, it shouldn't be at all controversial," sai~ Dr. Harvey Bender, head of the Regional Genetics Center at Memorial Hospital ofSouth Bend and a genetics professor at Notre Dame. Bender noted that such therapy would relieve an affilcted patient while not at all changing the genetic makeup of most ofhis body cells. 

It is expected that in less than two months the first experiments on humans will be ready to begin. They will be performed on patients with ADA deficiency, a rare genetic disease closely related to that of the "Bubble Boy." ADA patients have no immune system and die in early childhood. The researchers will transfer normal genes into the patients' bone marrow, where immune cells are generated, reducing the effects of the

syndrome. 

Another disease targeted for early experimentation is the woeful Lesch-Nyhan disease, whose victims have an uncontrollable impulse to bite their own fingers and lips, and who usually die early. Huntington's disease (a slow and painful mental deterioration), sickle cell anemia (a blood disorder), and cystic fibrosis (a lung condition) are others that may be treated soon. 
The possibilities are endless and inviting. 
Of course, those who shudder over the hazards of tampering with nature are by no means totally unjus­tified. Although science has officially agreed to careful restrictions, there is always the possibility that the growing body of DNA knowledge can be abused by some depraved doctor. 
But even though that con­cern Is very real, it cannot be allowed to cramp science. Valuable treatments cannot be discarded just because they may be learned and abused. If that happened, medicine would be nowhere near where it is 
10·1 today. Every time a new dis­
covery is made, a massive hubbub over its ethics invariably explodes, then sput­ters and dies. 
Such was the case with the first implantations of a donor heart, an artificial heart and a baboon heart. Now, people are beginning to take such transplants for granted, and before long, no one will even think twice about them. 
Medicine always has been a risky business. It is even more so now that it is delving into the deepest mys­teries of life. But lives are being saved, and diseases cured, and pain alleviated. There's no backing off now. 
Thanks toyou... it works... forALLOFUS

Many of the complaints about the tailgater stemmed from the hall's fight song, Carey said. 
"The Dillon Hall fight song Is known by many people in the Uni­versity and many find it offensive be­cause ofthe language," he said. 
Although it was the residents of Dillon Hall who were punished, they were not the only ones attending the tailgater, Husmann said. 
"There were a number of Notre Dame and Saint Mary's girls there and a number of other Notre Dame males," he said.

The Islamic Liberation Organiza­tion, a Sunni Moslem fundamentalist group, is allied with Tawheed, the Is­lamic Unification movement, whose black-scarved warriors are fighting for their lives In Tripoli. 
Another caller, also claiming to speak for the kidnappers, telephoned Beirut's Moslem radio station Voice of the Nation and said another captive had been killed. Pollee said no second body had been found. 
In a third call, to a Western news agency, a man who said he represented the Islamic Liberation Organization said the extremists would blow up the Soviet Embassy unless it was evacuated within 48 hours. 
There was no way to authenticate the calls. 
The Islamic Liberation Organiza­tion's statements about the kidnap­pings have been accompanied by the Lebanese identity cards oftwo of the hostages and photographs of all four with pistols held to their heads.

Ain't Love Grand *** 
X 
Records are rated on a tour·star scale, four being the best 
you're at all familiar with
I f 
any of X's previous music, 
then you'd have to expect big 
things when they put out an 
album and name it Ain't Love 
Grand. 
Ain't Love Grand is not ex­actly a mellow or even mediocre album. On the contrary, this fifth album (not counting an album X released recently under the name ofThe Kniters)from the spunky Los Angeles -based punk band is a cut above the rest. Songs like "Burning House of Love" and "Supercharged" are still typically X-hard-driving and sardonic. 
In comparison with the band's earlier work on the superb Un­der the Big Black Sun and the dryly ironic More Fun in the New World, Ain't Love Grand seems a bit tired. In some places Ain't Love Grand sounds surpris­ingly mature, such as inJohn Doe and Excene Cervenka's pledge to one another, "I'll Stand Up for You." 
Many of the tracks on Ain't Love Grand deserve to be hits. 
With its catchy hooks; "Burning House of Love" is made for the radio. "Love Shack" sounds like the Go-Go's. But in making the

music more accessible, X loses 
some its raw vitality. 
Only side two's opener "What's Wrong with Me?" captures the true X spirit ofold. "What's wrong with me?" scream Doe and Cervenka. Answer: "None ofyour god---­business!" 
Although not as sharp as X's previous albums, Ain't Love Grand is still worth a spin or two. As long as X moves toward the mainstream, they'll atleast be something good to listen to on the radio.

Golden dreams began at Notre Dame and Folsom 

It is a gold rush town, well preserved and  
now something ofa tourist attraction. Antique  
and souvenir shops spill out onto the wooden  
:>idewalks; more than one ice cream parlor be­ 
ckons  to  the travel weary. The playhouse  
presents its features in faded window displays,  
and across the street one can choose from a  
r r r  selection of handpainted figurines and music boxes playing "Oh, Susannah."  

Alison Pivonka 


as you like it 

Folsom is one ofmany towns that sprang up almost overnight from the chaos that was California in 1849. Here a man could find wealth beyond his wildest dreams, he could ''scrape his boot heel and pick up the price ofa meal." It was iq the Mother Lode that railroad magnate Leland Stanford had become a legend,. Fortune hunters came by the thousands, never doubting for a moment the truth ofthe fantastic tales they heard. 
The vision could not last. Soon one found that he simply could not scoop riches from the river bed; he had to be willing to work hard to pursue his dream. Yet hard work did not imply success, and optimism turned to disillusionment. Crime was everywhere, and with it came hideous inflation, alcoholism and even suicide. Many who had invested all they owned in the hope of "striking it rich" went home empty handed. 
The men and women who came to Folsom were looking for something that simply could not exist. Their fatal mistake was not in dream­ing, but in expecting those dreams to come true too easily. Those who thought they might have to settle for less than instant wealth, stayed home. Perhaps they, too, made a mistake. 

None of us came to Notre Dame without a dream: a 4.0, an unbeatable social life, a high­paying job after graduation, a top-notch graduate school. Perhaps the dream involved starting or carrying on a family tradtition. Per­haps it involved the familiar recipe of fame,. fortune and fulfillment that would yield not­hing·but success. 
Strange how dreams change. Reality simply refuses to measure up as often as we wish it would. Often we find that something we have planned for all ofour lives does not make us as happy as we thought it might. We grow up; we learn that we cannot always have what we want, when we want it. 
Far too many are afraid to trade the old dream for a new one; far too many '49ers decided -whether they were aware ofit or not -tl:Jat since they could not have the easy wealth they wanted, they were determined to be poor until the day they died. And they set out not actively building lives of destitution, but allowing it to take over in the lives they already led. 
"Nothing can exist in a vacuum." You have heard the phrase before. Nothing can exist where dreams, goals and plans are absent. Apathy takes over, and we begin to float in a void of spiritual, mental, and intellectual poverty. However farfetched, unattainable and unrealistic they may seem, dreams are es­sential. They keep us active and enthusiastic. They give us something for which to hope. 
Combine them with a sense of perspective and an acute awareness of reality. Know that your dreams are the right size when your best effort yields just a little less than your ideal. Perhaps there is no foolproof recipe for fame and fortune. But for fulfillment, everyone has his own. 
Alison Pivonka is a sophomore govern­ment and economics major atNotre Dame. 

Consider devoting time to serving of truly needy 
Few would deny the value of community service. For most of us at Notre Dame, grade school catechism introduced the inherent goodness of service. Sunday homilies preached the benevolent ideal, and Notre Dame experiences reinforced the quality of life dedicated to altruism. 
Pat Markey and KimRoerig 


guest column 

But what about us? While most agree that  
serviceis a virtue, few are able to convertsuch  
convictions into action. The demands of uni- 
r  
r  

versity life -Emil quizzes, philosophy papers, interhall sports, student government, off­campus parties -have left us with no time· for trite idealism. No longer are aspirations for a more just world part of our lifestyles. Staying ahead has become the rule in hectic academic life. Priorities are made for us, not by us. Time races on .... 
We are seniors. Panic. That distant future in 
. which we had anticipated choosing a vocation is upon us. The options before us are limitless. The LSATs are Saturday. IBM is on campus. Georgetown's graduate government program looks appealing. Our futures could take offin a single direction. Are we ready for that? Have we really explored all the options? Some have. Many ofus have not. 
In the recent avalanche of pressures, we may have once again neglected that deeply­rooted, but easily overlooked desire to serve. Now, more than ever, we need to examine all the options. The desire for immediate security may be limiting our choices. That law school is not going anywhere. We can begin our cor­porate careers a year later. But today's freedom may not exist for us in a few years. If that humanism was ever real, now is the time to consider action. 

On Friday, Oct. 4, from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m., the Center for Social Concerns will be sponsoring a Post-Graduate Opportunities Day. Representatives from various service or­ganizations, including Holy Cross Associates 'and the Jesuit Volunteer Corps, will be there to provide information for those consideringa period ofpost-graduate service. 
Exposure to .these organizations will prompt greater reflection on the service al­ternative. Such reflection may further compl­icate our senior decisions, but a year from now, we will be thankful that we did not neglect, once again, the possibility of com­munity service. Although our final decision may not lead us into one of these service programs, exposure to them will add depth to our senior considerations. As we move beyond Notre Dame, we will know that ours was not a superficial decision made in haste, but rather, a meaningful resolution based upon our genuine aspirations.

Since this is not exactly the Miss Universe contest, and the candidates have few emo­tions to play on, we will skip over Miss Con­geniality and start with first prize first. This year, first prize belongs to the French govern­ment for the bombing ofthe Greenpeace ship, Rainbow Warrior. Naturally, this senseless act came as something ofa surprise to the world, because the French are usually perceived as harmless sorts, content to paint impressionist

International bad guys are noted for their actions 
work by attacking a few thousand Italians, and it looked like we might have the early lead in ­the voting, but what can you do? The South Africns can always arrest a few thousand schoolchildren if they want headlines. The Grecnpeace job by the French was a diplomatic masterpiece. Nevertheless, we feel that we are creating a world class Bad Guys program in ~rit?.in. We will be in the hunt next year." 
Fourth place was won by the charmingArab terrorists who hijacked a planeful of Americans in Greece and re-routed them to scenic Beirut Airport. Unfortunately, we at Smoke Signals, like the rest of the world, arc somewhat in the dark as to who they actually are, and could not interview them, or get anyone to come to the award's ceremony. They can, however, claim their prize, a bronzed statuette of a clenched fist, any time they want. We can even get the head judge of the International Bad Guys Awards to deliver it in person, if they so desire. 
I figure I will just hop a plane to Athens, and they will do the rest.

landscapes, drink wine and discuss Sartre at roadside cafes. Their idea of violence is bur­ning a quiche. It seems, however, that the French are adopting a new "get tough" policy and are trying to shed their effete image. We asked a French spokesman to talk about the prize winning incident. 
"Well, we knew the South Africans were going to be tough, so we decided to go for broke and use one single, outrageous incident to put us over the top. We figured the South Africans would not be too clever and would try to win the award with an overwhelming number ofboring human rights violations. We decided that something innovative might capture the judges' imaginations, so we figured that planting a bomb on a Greenpeace ship in a New Zealand port might do the trick. I mean, who would ever think ofpicking on a bunch ofdo-gooders like Greenpeace? It must have gained us some points in the Tasteless­ness, Clandestine Acts, and Picking-on-the­Helpless categories. We are just glad it was enough for the first." 
Second place was won by South Africa's Botha regime. Realizing that the South Africans never like to finish second to anyone, and are seldom seen wearing white hats, we interviewed their spokesman about their tough-luck finish. 

"Well, naturally, this is a disappointment. We felt that with all the press we had been getting that we had it in the bag. I guess if we had to do it all over again, we would have used a little more tear gas, hit Angola with a few more border raids, added a couple of years to Nelson Mandela's prison term or maybe even knocked off that rabble rouser, Tutu. We cer­tainly would not have invited that Falwell character over for a visit -he made us sound downright humane! Well, I guess there is al­ways next year, unless the Israelis decide to invade Lebanon again." 
Third place was something of a surprise, also. It was won by the British, who are usually peaceful enough, but who ran amok at the European Cup soccer finals in June, and started a riot. The British spokesman had this to say. 
"We in Britain do not feel that we have ever gotten enough creditfor ourlack ofjudgment. We tried to create a few incidents in the past to help our image, like sinking the General Belgrano in the Falklands War, but we always seem to come up smelling like roses. This year, we decided to let our commoners do the

How to keep from breaking up during October 
It is the first week of October and many of us are now being plagued with the dreaded October blues. The newness of the school year has passed and we have all settled into the comfortable routine of a typical college student. 
Kim Yuratovac 
my views 

By now,living with a roommate is no longer as exciting as it first was. Especially if the roommate happens to be far from home. My dorm room has a huge countdown to vacation calendar with a map of Texas on it. Not that state pride Is not important or anything but I do not think I need to memorize all of the geographic locations in Texas. I think I am the closest there is to an adopted Texan. I have even lost some of my Chicago accent to the Texan all purpose phrase "fixin'." But, I am fixin' to lose that before I go home. 
October break is the light at the end of the tunnel. A week of'home cooking, no exams and no more ethanol. The thought is heaven to those of us who have been living on Cap'n Crunch and caffeine. 
How do you get rid of the October blues? The key is variety. Instead of the same old rut, why not try something new? Vary your usual schedule. Try to take a break from your studies and take an afternoon walk around campus. The autumn season is one ofthe most beautiful here. Take some pictures of the campqs and of you and your friends and mail them to Mom and Dad. 

Call or write a faraway friend. This will make home seem a lot closerand will brighten up a dull day. 
Shopping does wonders for any ailment. A short bus ride to the mall can cure even the worst case of cabin fever. Buy something ex­travagant for yourself. Those of us on a strict college budget can supplement extravagance with a bit ofimagination. 
The adventurous will find that Chicago is less than a two-hour train ride away. The Windy City offers a multitude of cultural ac­tivities and the sights and sounds of a true metropolis for those urbanites who long for that hustle and bustle. 
Exercise is a great way to release the ten­sion and routineness of a typical day. A job, a bicycle ride, an aerobics class or a game ofrac­quetball are popular therapies for the over­worked mind. 
Outside reading can be a necessary diversion from the usual textbooks. Reading something of interest such as a magazine or newspaper can be refreshing after pages of calculus problems. 
But, by" far, the best way to overcome the October blues is through a positive attitude. Things are only as good or bad as you make them. And anyway, October break is only two weeks away.

Students comment on Heilmann's column 
Dear Editor:

Argue for the right to collective bargaining 
DearEditor: 
Our new director of personnel, Roger Mul­
lins, would probably want to be called direc­
tor of human resources. For. he speaks of 
institutions catching up with the 
"progressive" human resources approach 
which is Increasingly evident in other sectors 
of the economy. While this may be a noble 
goal, Mullins may not be aware ofsome of the 
necessary ingredic:nts of a truly progressive 
human resources program, particularly in a 
Catholic institution. 
First. Pope John Paul II, in his encyclical "On Human Work," described labor unions as "indispensable in modern industrial life." Second, the 19H4 draft of the U.S. Bishop's pas­toral letter on the economy states that all of the principles of Catholic social teaching on economic life apply equally to "The Church and its many institutions and agencies." Third, the same pope and bishops speak of the im­portance of "human dignity," "just wages and fringe benefits," and "worker participation and co-ownership." 
Consequently, Mullins is on weak ground when he asserts that unions are valid only when management fails to do its job. Nor does he address the issue of minimal wages and fringes for non-faculty employees. Similarly, he makes no mention of either independent third party arbitration of employees grievances or employee participation in decision-making at Notre Dame. 
These issues are a part of our democratic, American and Catholic heritages. Fur­thermore, collective bargaining, grievance procedures, higher wages and worker par­ticipation in management have all been demonstrated to be successful in raising productivity and morale. 
Regardless of whether Mullins believes he is doing his job well, Notre Dame has actively opposed attempts to organize workers here. I, along with I H other signees, support the right of employees at Notre Dame to choose for themselves whether or not to organize a union and collectively bargain.

Fraternity means a true college brotherhood 
DearEditor: 
In response to Chris Lusi's article condemn­ing the articles frequently found in Viewpoint, we would like to address his logical and "mature" arguments. 
First, we wish to refute his allegation that the only similarity between the Greek system and Notre Dame's residence hall system is the fact that both are student residences. Our so­cial life at Notre Dame may not be as good as we would like. Dan McCullough was not, however, trying to say that Notre Dame's residence hall system is socially comparable to that of fraternities and sororities. He stressed the fact that the strong hall spirit and togetherness found in dorm life at Notre Dame is equivalent to that of the Greek sys­tem. The word fraternity does not mean social life. The word fraternity means brotherhood ­and that is the essence of McCullough's ar­ticle. 
We would guess, after reading your letter, Lusi, that your social agenda probably does does include watching paint dry. On the other hand, we know for a fact that there are many people here at Notre Dame who maintain a very active and dynamic social life. This being the case, we would have to agree with you that the suggestion, "If it is so bad here, why don't go you somewhere else?" would do you absolutely no good. It is your apathetic at­titude which hinders your social life. In order to improve your social life, you must make a conscious effort to do so. 
Second, we just do not see the connection between the problems in South Africa and problems at Notre Dame. We, as students, do have the power to do something about the things we disagree with. We can attempt to change the situation, or, as has been suggested before, go somewhere else. If someone moans and groans about a situation but does nothing to alleviate the problem, what is wrong with suggesting that the person leave? No one is being held hostage here at Notre Dame. Those who are being oppressed in South Africa, on the other hand, do not have the choices which are available to us. Hundreds of black South Africans who have attempted to bring about change, have been shot. Exactly how many Last, we would like to address Lusi's attack 
Notre  Dame  students  were  shot  in  the  
demonstrations  against  the  impending  al­ 
cohol policy?  


on the logic and maturity of the letters that 
appear in Viewpoint. He concluded his letter 
in this manner: "So why don't you get real 
McCullough and write something that is non­
fiction. You probably believe in the tooth 
fairy, too." Logical and mature? 

Moreover, did you feel that your article of­
fers a viable solution to the social problems 
here at Notre Dame, Lusi? You state that the 
most Viewpoint columns merely make 
excuses. Your article does not make excuses ­
yet if offers no solutions to Notre Dame's so­
cial problems. We are inclined to think that 
apathetic moaners such as yourself add to the 
problem, not the solution.

Saint Mary's must clean its own image first 
DearEditor: 

In response to many of the Saint Mary's stu­dents who are fighting to uphold the idea that Saint Mary's is proud of its heritage and its standards amongst women without any need or want of men at their institution, I propose something which it seems you have over­looked. It seems to me the core of your problem dwells among yourselves and not in the minds ofNotre Dame students. The reason I say this relates toa very specific incident. My roommate recently told me of a very "interesting" conversation she had with a Saint Mary's student. It went for the most part as follows: 
Notre Dame woman (my roommate):"... One of the biggest reasons I came to Notre Dame was to get a great education." 
Saint Mary's woman (extremely bewil­dered): "An education?" 
Notre Dame woman:"Yes. An education. (A bit stunned) Why did you come to Saint Mary's?" 
Saint Mary's woman: (quite assuredly) "Why, to get a husband, ofcourse!" 
As amusing as this may seem, it is quite fac­tual and it is embarrassing to Saint Mary's stu­dents. It is people like this twisted young woman that give Saint Mary's a "roving eye" stereotype. I am certain that many of you at Saint Mary's will be disgusted and perhaps even angry at this girl's attitude. 
But, regardless of the fact that many of you are very career-oriented and have a lot of pride in yourselves, this girl's comments un­fortunately stick out like a sore thumb and put quite a scar on your reputation. You who are there at Saint Mary's to get educated are being labelled perhaps unfairly because ofsuch out­looks and something should be done about this. Let your angers be heard! Get within seconds ofstrangling such women who make a bad name for you all. 
I have met many fine and proud girls from Saint Mary's and I feel I should let you be aware of some of the damages your own col­lege residents are doing to your reputation.

With this new-found confidence, the Irish went down to Purdue to participate in the Indiana Rugby Union Tournament. The opening two matches proved to be no con­tests as the team impressively defeated Ball State and Indiana State University, 19-8 and 18-3 respectively.

By CHRIS STARKEY 
Sports Writer 

Distance-running enthusiasts from around the world will gather in South Bend on Saturday to compete in the fifth annual Sportsmed 1 0­Kilometer run. 
Sponsored by Saint joseph's Medi­cal Center, the event regularly draws some of the premier runners in the world, including such par­ticipants as joan Benoit, Alberto Salazar, and Bill Rodgers. It is ex­pected to draw a total of around 2,800 runners this year. 
lbis year's featured runner is former Olympian Frank Shorter. Shorter was the gold medalist in the 1972 Olympic marathon and the sil­ver medalist in 1976 in the same event. Race Directors Ron Craker and Carter Wolf were understan­dably pleased at Shorter's participa­tion. 
"We're just elated to have a runner of Shoner's caliber," says Craker. "He's an athlete with an in­ternational reputation, and that's nice to have." 
Shoner will be also acting as the official starter for Notre Dame's home cross country meet on Friday afternoon. 
Joining Shorter in the Sportsmed run, meanwhile, are several other world class competitors, headed by Englishman Nick Rose. Rose, a two time Olympian himself, recently broke the world record in the half· marathon. Craker considers Ro~ to be the man to beat. 
Also a strong threat is last year's Sportsmed winner Dan Henderson, who returns to defend his title. 
Among the women, the race features Britain's Prlscella Welch, who is still winning marathons at 40 years of age. She will be challenged by Leslie Welch and Suzanne Girard. 
Craker said the race will be ac­cepting entries until Saturday. It costs ten dollars to enter, and this can be done at Pro Health of South Bend, Saint joseph's Bank, and WNDU. Students are encouraged to enter. There is also a 1 1 /2-mile Fun Run starting just after the 1OK run begins, as well as a running clinic on Sunday from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. at the Century Center conducted by Shorter himself. 
Funher information may be ob­tained by calling Pro Health at 234­3034.

hope to increase thier win total this week as they play Goshen, today at 4 p.m., Calvin, on Friday, and Albion, on Sunday. All three matches will be at home at Cartier Field on the artifi­cial turf of which Notre Dame is ac· customed to playing. 
"In all three matches, we should win pretty handily because we are faster on the turf than the other schools,"admits Undenfeld. "In fact, Calvin and Albion have never played on artifical turf. Hopefully, in all three matches we can jumpout to an early lead which will allow me to play the other players who need ex­perience."

continued/rom page 12 
Despite the recent offensive 
trouble of DIGiacomo In front ofthe 
net, Undenfeld commented on the 
improvement in DIGiacomo's over­
all play. 
"She has really improved her pas· 
sing game and her stickwork," says 
Undenfeld. "Her ball control is get· 
ling better, but there is room for 
more improvement in that area. She 
has got to keep the ball closer to her 
body." 
As her game becomes more com­plete, DiGiacomo is confident that her offen~. as well as the team's, will come along. She says she is espe­cially optimistic regarding the remainder of the schedule. 
"I'm really psyched about the rest of the season," says DiGiacomo. "We're working very hard and we've been learning from our mistakes. We've been together for three years and we work well together."

Suglich likes her role as setter 
By CHUCK FREEBY 
Sports Writer 
Jill Suglich is probably the only woman on the Notre Dame campus who doesn't mind being called an Irish setter. 
In fact, Suglich wouldn't mind being called the Irish setter. 
So far this season, Suglich has been granted her wish. The Chicago sop­homore has held down the setting duties for the Notre Dame volleyball team in every match this year, and her performance has been ad­mirable despite the team's 2-8 record. 
"She's made tremendous im­provement this season," remarks Irish volleyball coach Art Lambert. "Learning to set the intricacies ofthe 5-1 offense is not an easy task, andJill has had her ups and downs. But she's having far more ups than downs so far." 
That's good news for the Irish, who have to rely on Suglich to run the Notre Dame attack. Her role on offense is much the same as the quar­terback in football or the point guard in basketball. As the setter, she has to take charge. 
"I have to be the leader on the floor," says Suglich of her role. "If I play badly, the team does badly, be­cause I'm not getting the ball to the hitters." 
That isn't always an easy task, as volleyball is a game of constant mo­tion on offense. With as many as three hitters to look for sometimes, it could be unnerving for some players. However, Suglich handles the chaos with a calm demeanor. 
"We have a very simple offense," notes the Pasquerilla East resident. "I know where everyone will be. It's been a little bit of a problem since we have two freshmen in the middle, because it takes us a little while to get used to each other. Still, we're getting more confident every match." 
Suglich hopes that trend con­
tinues this weekend, as Notre Dame 
begins its North Star Conference 
season with a road match at Xavier 
Friday night. Suglich is confident the 
Irish will be ready for the league 
season. 
"I think we can win the con­
ference and get back up to .500 by 
the end of the year," states Suglich. 
"We've improved in nearly every 
game, so you really can't complain 
about what has happened so far." 
Lambert has certainly had very 
few complaints about Suglich's 
game, as he is impressed with the 
sophomore's ability. 
"Before she's through at Notre 
Mets cut lead to one game with 5-2 win 
ST. LOUIS-Dwight Gooden threw a nine-hitter in pitching the New York Mets to a 5-2 victory over Joa­quin Andujar and the St. Louis Car­dina,ls last night, cutting the Cardinals' lead in the National League East to one game. 
Gooden was forced to weather a ninth-inning jam, however, retiring Tom Herr on a line drive to second baseman Wally Backman with the bases loaded and a run in. 
The victory was the second straight for the Mets over the Car­dinals in the three-game series, which concludes tonight. The Mets beat the Cards 1-0 in 11 innings Tuesday night on Darryl Straw­berry's home run. 
George Foster had three hits for the Mets including his 21st homer leading off the seventh. 
Dame, she could be a great setter," 
notes the second-year Irish coach. 
"Her court knowledge, her hitting 
and her play at the net have im­
proved dramatically this season. 
"I'm still not totally satisfied with 
her setting and the way she's getting 
the ball to our hitters. Those are 
areas which need work, but that's 
not unusual for a young player. It 
takes a lot of practice to be a good 
setter, andJill's giving it 110 percent 
this year." 
That's all part of Suglich's style. . One of the most aggressive players 
on the Irish squad, Suglich realizes 
she has to work hard for the team to 
succeed. . 
"I'm not like a cheerleader on the 
floor," remarks the College of Busi­
ness student. "I just try to lead by ex­
ample and to keep everyone up. The 
game is so quick at this level that you 
can't afford to be thinking about 
your last mistake." 
That goes double for Suglich, who has plenty of things to think about on the court. Before the ball is in play, Suglich is already surveying the opposing team's defense for weaknesses. 
"Before the serve, I look to see where the other team's shortest blocker is, where the setter is and where I might dump the ball," says Suglich. "I have to always look for things, because the game is based on three hits, and you want to keep your tempo and break up the other team's." 
IfSuglich can accomplish that task consistently, she has a shot of ac­complishing both of her volleyball career goals. 
"For the team, I would like to see us achieve national ranking before I leave, and I think we can do that. As for myself, maybe I could be remem­bered as a great setter." 
She's already making progress on both ofthose.

Field hockey team hopes to hit midseason stride 
Irish start homestand today against Goshen 
ByTOMYOON 
Sport's Writer 
When the Notre Dame field hockey team traveled to Michigan State last Tuesday, it expected to encounter a very tough Spartan team, and it did. 
With the Irish leading throughout the game, 1-0, it came down to literally the last second before Michigan State finally scored to knot up the contest at 1-1. The match continued until the game was finally called in the second overtime with the score still tied at 1-1. 
"It was a heartbreaking game," said Head Coach Jill Undenfeld. "The tie felt like a loss because we were leading the whole game until that last second. I felt that they would score because they just kept on coming. And with everyone on offense, it was only a matter of time before they would score." 
Undenfeld was not prepared to accept, however, the way the Spartans finally put the ball in the net. 
"They scored on a weird play in which one of their players got a free hit and it just happened to ricochet off (another) player," said Lindenfeld. "That threw (Notre Dame goalie Patti Gallagher's) timing off and that allowed them to tie the game wih just one second left." 
The Irish goal came when Melissa Sommer, who had sat out much ofthe contestfor a rest, went down the left side of the field and hit a very hard and accurate shot right into the net. 
"Overall, I would have to say that we played a very good game and that Patti, Melissa, and Mary Struckhoff played very well," said Undenfeld. "Mary had the task of defending their best scorer and she did a very good job on defense. I was pleased about the whole game, but in my mind, the tie felt like a loss." 
With the field hockey team's record at 4-4-1, the Irish

junior forward Corinne DiGiacomo led the Notre Dame field hockey team in goals scored last season, although she and her teammates are having a tough time putting the ball in the net this year. The 4-4-1 lrlsh, however, will attempt to get the offense in gear this afternoon against Goshen at 4 p.m. at Cartier Field.

Coach has confidence in junior DiGiacomo 
By RICK RIETBROCK 
Sports Writer 
Corinne DiGiacomo and the rest of the Notre Dame field hockey team is having a problem scoring goals this season. This fact may be a surprise for the normally productive Irish offense, but it is not nearly as big a mys­tery as last year's leading scorer, DiGiacomo, being kept offthe scoreboard. 
DiGiacomo, however, is well aware of the problem and attributes the lack of scoring punch to a couple of factors. 
"I'm just really having trouble putting the ball in the net," she says. "Also, we've already played two top­twenty teams this year so the defenses have been tough. Last year we started with defenses that were at a level similar to ours, which made it easier to score." 
Scoring has never been a problem before for the junior forward from Rosemont, Penn.. At Radnor High School, she earned honorable-mention honors in the tough Central League by scoring 14 goals and adding si,x assists in her two-year career. 
"My high school had good field hockey and lacrosse programs," says DiGiacomo. "The Central League also provided good competition to help me improve." 
This year, she started the season with 36 career goals, and has added three so far already to tie Kathy Ray for second on the all-time list. Meanwhile, her nine assists last year set a single-season record. 
Goals have not been easy to come by this season, however. 
"Corinne has missed some open shots this year, but our whole team is really struggling with goals," Head CoachJill Undenfeld says. "I think she is pressing a little now that she hasn't been scoring."

Irish soccer team rallies in second half to tie Bowling Green 
By CHRIS KOSTER 
Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame soccer team was able to remedy a sluggish start with an inspired second half of play to take the visiting Bowling Green Fal­cons to a 1-1 tie yesterday at Alumni field. 
The visitors clearly controlled the tempo of the first half and applied constant pressure on the Notre Dame goal. Although they were able to keep the Irish off-balance with a crisp passing attack, the Falcons were ultimately unable to fully dominate play. 
The only goal by Bowling Green came in the first half after 25 minutes ofplay. Midfielder Nan Chul Shin broke away from two Irish defenders to the 18-yard line, and pushed the ball to teammate Mark Jackson on his right. Jackson made a quick move and fired a lowhard shot that Notre Dame goalkeeper Hugh Breslin was able only to get a hand on before it struck the inside of the net. 
Fortunately for the Irish, the Fal­cons were unable to capitalize on the sporadic play of the home team, and Notre Dame left the field at halftime with only a 1-0 deficit. 
"We just were not ready to play," said Irish head coach Dennis Grace. 
"We were very fortunate.it was only 1-0 at halftime. But they were very fortunate it ended in a 1-1 tie, be­cause we were all over them in the second half." 
How true this was. The Irish came 
out with a renewed intensity in the 
second half.. The reversal was ap­
 parent as everything seemed to fall back into place. Intelligent passing, and aggresive teamwork combined to display the domination the Irish had over the Bowling Green squad. 
Notre Dame was able to move the ball fluidly into Falcon territory, for­cing goalkeeper Jeff Vincent to stop 11 of 19 shots. The Irish tied the game at the 73:41 mark from the foot of freshman midfielder Tom Gerlacher. Fellow freshman Joe Sternberg carried the ball to the corner, and hit a low cross past the goalkeeper. Here, Gerlacher punched a shot into the upper left hand corner of the goal. Gerlacher leads the Irish with three goals on the season. 

The team fired consistently on the Falcon goal for the remainder of the game, but were unable to come away with another score. 
In the ensuing ten-minute overtime period, Notre Dame con­tinued to outplay its opponent. The Irish, however, were unable to con­nect for the anticipated winning goal. The most notable opportunity came with 5:45 left. After Sternberg released a shot that Falcon goalkeeper Vincent got a foot on, Gerlacher hit the follow-up shot just over the crossbar. 
Grace did not walk away dis­sapointed. 
"It's bringing out the best in us," admits the second-year Notre Dame mentor. "We're learning, and playing some good soccer. The kids played a great game." 
The Notre Dame soccer unit travels to the Wright State Tourna­ment this weekend. Everyone is feeling positive about the level of play that will be featured. 

Irish must contend with 'Falcon Fever' Saturday 
Irish cornerback Mike Haywood was standing just outside the Notre Dame lockerroom, encircled by a small group of reporters. The Irish had just been trounced by Purdue, 35-17, and the frustrated senior was looking for answers. 
"Will next week's game against Air Force be a 'must game' for Notre Dame?" he was asked. 
"You don't like to be in that situation this early," Haywood replied, 'but I'd have to say that it's a 'mustgame.' Air Force has dominated us for the past three years and we've got to make a change in that." 
Haywood's answer puts Notre Dame's situation in perspective pretty well. The 1-2 Irish must defeat Air Force this Saturday -not only to get their season backon the right track, but also to prove that they can beat a team that has had their number for the past three seasons. 
But an Irish victory Saturday in Colorado Springs will be no easy task. The Falcons are 4-0 and ranked 17th in the nation. They have outscored their opponents this season by a combined total of 205-42. While sold-out stadiums and nationally-televised games are nothing out ofthe ordi­nary for Notre Dame, they are something quite special for the Air Force Academy. The Falcons are off to their best start since 1972, so it's no wonder that the Colorado area is suffering from an epidemic ofFalcon Fever. 
And Saturday the Irish will be walking right into the middle ofit. 
"There's lots ofexcitment here," Air Force coach Fisher DeBerry said in this Tuesday's teleconference. "They tell me we'll have the biggest crowd in history here, and being 

Larry Burke 
Football Notebook 
on national television is a big thing. We don't get on quite as often as Notre Dame." 
The Falcons haven't been on national television since their 1969 season opener against Southern Methodist, but that doesn't mean that Falcon fans are any less supportive oftheir team than the fans at the big-name football schools. And DeBerry's information about the record-setting atten­dance for this Saturday's game is correct. 
"People have been coming out ofthe woodwork for this game," Air Force Sports Information Director Dave Kellog said yesterday. "This game is absolutely sold out -there are no tickets to be had. We've had 4,000 additional seats in­stalled just for Saturday, so we expect a crowd of about 52,000." 
The official capacity for Falcon Stadium is listed as 46,668. The largest home crowd in Academy history is the 49,536 that turned out to see Army beat Air Force, 10-7, in 1967. 
This year's Notre Dame-Air Force game is already dif­ferent from those of the past. 21 years. It is undoubtedly a far cry from the first 1 1 games of the series, when a Notre Dame victory was a vit'tual.certainty. But it is also different from the past three years, when the Falcons have come out on top. This year it is Air Force who is the favorite -and this Falcon team is adjusting well to that new role. 

"It's something new for this team," Kellog said of Air Force's recent rise. "It used to be that we were like David going up against Goliath when we played Notre Dame, but now these players have the feeling that they can play with Notre Dame, and, in fact, that they can play with anybody. This is a veteran-laden team, and they're not intimidated by teams like Notre Dame." 
And Saturday afternoon the Falcons will be shooting for their fourth straight win over the Irish. Only Southern Cal, which beat Notre Dame five straight times between 1978 and 1982, has ever had that kind ofconsistent mastery over Notre Dame. 
EXTRA POINTS-Irish tailback Allen Pinkett is only 192 yards away from breaking Vegas Ferguson's all-time Notre Dame rushing record. But the Irish haven't had much success on the ground so far this season, averaging just 
111.6 yards per game on the ground . Junior walk-on Dan Sorensencurrently ranks sixth in the nation in punting with a 44.6-yard average. He averaged better than 4 7 yards in his nine punts against Purdue last week, with a long of 57 yards . Injury report: flanker Tim Brown is having a speedy recovery from the sprained ankle he suffered last Saturday against Purdue. He's off crutches
