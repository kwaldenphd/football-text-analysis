Reagan silences Congress on Social Security cuts 
WASHINGTON (AP) Republican congressional leaders said yesterday that President Reagan gave them no encouragement when they proposed cutting Social Security and other open-ended benefit programs this year in order to hold down the federal deficit. 
One called the proposal, "just barely an open question." Another said it "should he put to rest" for this year, despite what were described as strong presentations by some senators who told Reagan those programs must he cut now in order to make the substantial budget reductions he wants for the fiscal year that hegin,s Oct 1. 
Reagan himsdf gave reporters a rare "no comment" when they asked him at the start of the morning meeting whether he would rule out a proposal to recalculate cost-of­living increases for Social Security recipients to reduce costs. 
Social Security is the largest of the many so-called entitlement programs that are poolitically and financially difficult to control be­cause they pay benefits not on the basis of annual congressional ap­propriations but on the basis of the number of people who meet their eligibility criteria. 
Entitlement programs also in­clude food stamps, welfare, un­employment, veterans' pensions, Medicaid and Medicare. 

Various White House spokesmen said last week as the administration sought ways to make new budget cuts that Reagan would not seek fur­ther reductions in entitlement programs this year, hut might when Congress takes up the fiscal 1983 
budget early next year. 
That line appeared to change late 
Monday when chief ofstaffJames A. 
Baker III returned from a meeting 
with GOP leaders on Capitol Hill 
and huddled with the president on 
the White House tennis court where 
Reagan had been watching an ex­
hibition match. 
Deputy White House press 
secretary Larrv Speakes said after­
ward that Rea-gan would look i~to 
the possibility of cutting entitle­
ments. Asked repeatedly whether 
the president would rule out cuts in 
Social Security payments, Speakes 
avoided a direct answer. 
But a senior White House official, who asked not to be identified. said: "the president has not been inclined to gotha t t way. He is willing to listen to the arguments. He hasn't been persuaded." 
It appeared that Reagan wasn't persuaded at the leadership meeting yesterday either: 
Senate Majority Leader Howard H. Baker Jr. said Reagan "certainly did not indicate any willingness to con­sider any entitlement· changes in 1982." 
"It's just barely an open question," he added. 

Sen. Paul Laxalt, R-Nev., Reagan's closest friend in the Senate, said there was "no se.tious discussion concerning any cuts in Social Security at all. That should be put to rest." 
However, Laxalt and Baker pointed out that it will be extraor­dinarily difficult to make the cuts Reagan wants if so-called "discretionary spending" is the only category under consideration.

mathematical models of the Earth's atmosphere to simulate possible changes in weather. 
"One of the main purposes is to assess what kind of changes might happen if the carbon dioxide content of the atmosphere is doubled because of industrial pollu­tion," Dr. Alan Gadd, assistant director of the program, said. 
Scientists theorize that a buildup ofcarbon dioxide, a byproduct of virtually any industrial process that consumes energy, might warm the world's climate. This is popularly known as the greenhouse effect. 
"But to call it the greenhouse effect makes it sound like just a general warming up," Gadd said. "What we are very in.terested in is geographical and regional varia­tions from place to place." 
So Gadd and his colleagues plan to run their mathe­matical model through 50 years of seasonal changes, gradually increasing the carbon dioxide factor, in hopes of discovering what the Earth's climate will be l!ke in various regions in 2130. 
Such a task is far beyond the current Meteorological

Interestratesedged lower yesterday for the fifth straight day, highlighted by a move throughout the banking industry to match a modest decline in the prime lending rate. Rallies in the bond and money markets prompted some economists to suggest rates may continue to drop slowly, with little chance for substantial relief from record-high borrowing costs. Economists believe the trend was fueled by signs that the Federal Reserve Board is relaxing credit reins: The Board has sought to keep credit tight to control inflation. Market watchers said the injected reserves into the banking system, a move that generally produces lower interest rates. For example, .the rate on federal funds -which strongly influences their short­term rates -traded in the range of 1 5 percent to 16 percent yester­day. The rate averaged nearly 20 percent in early July. Federal funds are the overnight loans of uncommitted reserves among banks, an important source offunds for financial institutions. -AP 
President Anwar Sadat's government expelled the Soviet ambassador to Cairo and six Soviet Embassy employees yesterday, accusing them of plotting against Egypt by inciting Moslem-Christian strife. A Hungarian diplomat also was ordered out. The move, taken by the Egyptian Cabinet and announced by the government news agency, appeared to be the most serious breach of Egyptian-Soviet relations since 1972 when Sadat expelled 1 7,000 Soviet advisers. It followed Sadat's speech Monday night accusing the Soviet Union of being involved "head-on" in the strife between Moslem fundamentalists and the Coptic Christian minority in Egypt and that the 1,5 36 Egyptians arrested in connection with that strife had been Soviet-inspired. -AP 
At least 50 anti-nuclear protesters were arrested for trespassing yesterday as hundreds converged by land and by sea on the $2.3 billion Diablo Canyon atomic power plant. An estimated 60 demonstrators -out ofabout 3,000 who have gathered in hopes of keeping the facility from starting up -scaled a six foot high bar­bedwire perimeter fence near the plant's main gate, where a mass blockade began at midafternoon. Around the same time, a group of 25 people that included actor Robert Blake landed on a beach near the plant after defying choppy seas and biting winds in a ragtag flotil­la. and one of them was arrested, California Highway Patrol officer Ron Henn said. "They said we couldn't do it, but we did," the skipper of one of the half-dozen sail and motor boats yelled as the landing party, clad in jeans, cutoff-; and wetsuits, went ashore on the rugged coastline in rubber rafts. They put ashore just outside a 16 square­
mile off-limit zone declared by the Coast Guard. -AP 
An Indiana University math education professor says American school children can add, subtract, multiply and divide "but they don't know how and when to apply these skills." Frank Lester, an associate professor in the Ill school of Education, says students need to develop greater math literacy. He said the demands of the job market are such that they must know how to interpret graphs. charts and tables. According to Lester, math should be incor­porated in all areas of study and students must learn to use it in any context. "I think there has been too much emphasis in getting quick, correct answers, rather than thinking a problem through and getting a good understanding ofit," Lester said. "I think.schools often tend to make kids more impulsive, instead of giving them time to think. . .! don't blame the teachers. There is so much pressure to cover the book and for the children to do well on tests." -AP

Films raise social concerns 
Once each semester, The Social Concerns Or­ganization ofStudent Government and the Center for Experiential Learning invite us to broaden our social perspectives by attending the Social Con­cerns Film Series. 
This semester, the series addresses a variety of issues, including poverty, discrimination, health care and war sentiment, which aren't as far removed from the Notre Dame community as one might believe. 
The poverty issue opens the series .with the documentary film "Something Beautiful for God," which follows the work of Mother Theresa ofCal­cutta. 
Mother Theresa's work with the poor will also be featured in a Thanksgiving television special about the rosary. This special includes an inter­view between Bob Newhart and Gerry Faust, and segrr.ents featuring the Glee Club and Fr. Hes­burgh, all of which were filmed on the Notre Dame campus. 
The problems caused by poverty in the South Bend community are challenged by community se.rvice organizations at Notre Dame, including St. Vincent DePaul, CILA Upward Bound and the Neighborhood Study Help Program. 
In addition, CILA sponsors 8-10 week summer projects involving service work at a variety of locations. Last summer's projects were located at Los Ninyos in Tijuana, Mexico, the Christian Ap­palacia Project and The Glenmary Home Mis­sioners program in Appalacia. 
The next movie, "To Kill A Mockingbird," centers around racial discrimination in a small Southern town. 
Sexual Discrimination was the charge in a class action suit Delores Frese filed against Notre Dame, which was dismissed pending final judicial approval August 3. Two members of the class, Anne Lacombe and Madonna Kolbenschlag, ob­jected to the terms of the settlement agreement, which included the elimination of the discrimina­tion charge, and filed an appeal, which goes to the Seventh Circuit Court in Chicago where briefs will be filed and a decison made. Final judicial ap­proval in this case could take vears. 
The series continues with "Hospital". a black comedy on the order of"Network," about health care administration politics. 
The Reagan administration recently decided to cut much of the newly implemented funding and staffing involving care for the handicapped . 
Stephen Rogers, a blind professor in the depart­ment of General Program, noted that he feared that the Reagan plan will set things back for the handicapped. He added that he believes funding for the handicapped has been needed for a long time. 
Rogers said that he foresees.no negative impact

Notre Dame is also creating an Office for Hand­icapped Students. and making a concentrated ef­fort to accept more handicapped students. 

War sentiment is the issue covered in the final two films, the documentary "War Without Win­ners" and "Breaker Morant". 
Observer reporter Jim McClure recently inter­viewed former POW Captain Gerald Coffee, U.S. Navy, about his views on Christianity and its relationship to the military. 
Coffee said that he believed that war is sometimes necessary to protect those Christian values that Notre Dame stands for. He adds that from an ethical standpoint, military people are probably the most anti-war one could find, be­cause they know better than anyone else what war is really like.

Newhart notes Career, future 

By DAVID RICKABAUGH 
SeniorStaffReporter 
During the recent IDming of a 
television special on the Notre 
Dame campus Bob Newhart talked 
about his career and the television 
industry. 
The comedian's future plans in· 
dude touring the country with his 
stand-up routine and starring in a 
CBS television movie. 
Newhart, noted for the role ofDr. 
Robert Hartley on "The Bob 
Newhart Show," stated he left the 
top rated program because of the 
rigors of weekly series and the lack 
ofquality writers available. 
"We did the show for six years, 10 
or 12 times a week. It was just like 
doing a play. Also, it was very hard to 
get good writers." 
Since leaving the CBS comedy, 
Newhart portrayed the President of 
the United States in the theatrical 
film "The First Family" and 
headlined two CBS variety specials. 
"I was upset with reaction to 
"(First) Family." We had a great cast 
with Madeline Kahn, Gilda Radner 
and Fred Willard to name just afew. I 
can wait a while before doing that 
again." The "button-down mind" 
on the television media commented, 
"For awhile television ran programs

Newhart listed MASH, 60 Minutes, 20/20, and Archie Bunker's Place as some ofhis favorite programs. 
"I had to mention Archie Bunker's Place because my uncle plays, Mr Van Rensolear, the blind guy at the end ofthe bar." 
When asked whether he feared he would be stereotyped into the role of Bob Hartley he commented, "there's always some drawbacks when you play one character over a long period of time, and getting stereotyped is one of them. However. I think the character of Bob Hartley closely resembles the image of Bob Newhart." 
The problem ofactors who leave a successful series and fail at a return (people such as Dick Van Dyke, Mary Tyler Moore and Mclean Stevenson) results, according to Newhart, from the nature of the television industry and not from their earlier popularity. 
'Television is a competitive busi­ness, getting two hits is very tough." 
The comedian said he does not plan to return to a weekly program within the near future and looks for­ward to touring and working on a f·w special projects.

example, keeping white colla! prisoners from dangerous criminals would be one solution. 
He also proposed restricting the use ofcash in all levels ofsociety, to the point of making the possession oflargc amounts ofcash illegal. Drug dealers, for example always deal in 
large amounts of cash. Because of the illegal nature of the transaction using checks or credit cards would be impossible. The number of mug­gings would also decrease if people did not carry much cash. He said that in Florida a drug dealer can get up to 45 years in prison for bringing in a shipment ofcocaine, but only seven years for killing someone. Often, any 
witnesses involved in drug cases are killed because ofthe lesser sentence for murder than for drug dealing. 
Bailey spoke about the air traftk controllers strike in some detail. He helped form the controllers union himselfand is also a pilot. He blames the Reagan administration for cover­ing up the truth about the situation, and holds that the air traffic control­lers demands arc legitimate.

In addition to using the new com puter to forecast the weather in the next century, the Meteorological Office intends to put it ro work on the more mundane matter of tomor­row's weather. 
Gadd and his colleagues believe the Cyber 205 will enable them to make more and better readings ofat­mospheric conditions. They also say it will be able to handle readings not taken at the standard ·worldwide reporting times -noon and mid­night GMT. 
The main example of this is data from satellites, which check the weather 24 hours a day as they circle the Earth. 
Beyond the weather services, en­gineers see wide-ranging applica­tions for the supercomputer, including control of nuclear reac­tors, three-dimensional design of building~ and bridges, operation of oilfields, genetic engineering and biochemistr\.

VATICAN CITY (AP) -Pope John Paul II, in his most com­prehensive statement on social issues, yesterday strongly backed labor unions, urged worker par­ticipation in management and proposed a "just" family wage and subsidies that would free mothers from the necessity of taking jobs. 
The papal encyclical condemns both "rigid" capitalism and the "collectivist system" that would eliminate all private ownership of the means of production. It suggests a socialist middle ground as a model for economic development. 
Central to the 99-page, 22,000 word encyclical is opposition to the "dehumanizing excesses" of modern economic systems. 
"We must emphasize and give prominence to the primacy of man in the production process, the primacy of man over things," the pope said. "We must first ofall recall a principle that has always been taught by the church -the prin­ciple of the priority of labor over 

Richard T. Sullivan dies of illness::~~~-~~t~~~l~:~ ~:~r;~e~~li~~ 
Richard T. Sullivan, nationally recognized novelist, short story writer and member ofthe University of Notre Dame faculty since 1936, died September 13 in South Bend's St. Joseph Medical Center after a long illness. He was 72. 
Sullivan, who was to write one of the most popular books about Notre Dame, came to the University as a student in 1926 and received a bac­helor's degree in 1930. He did freelance work for radio and magazines before joining the faculty in 1936 as an instructor in the writing of short stories, novels, plays, and poetry. He also attended the Chicago Art Institute and Good­man School of Drama. He received Notre Dame's faculty award in 1945. 
Mr. Sullivan's "Notre Dame: The Story of a Great University" was published in 195 I and was described as a "love letter" by reviewers. His personal recounting

Workers should recdve a "just" wage, which the pope defines as ade­quate to support the family and al­low mothers to concentrate on the care and education ofchildren. Mot­hers also should benefit from family allowances to enable them to devote themselves "exclusively to their familes." 
"Having to abandon these tasks in order to take up paid work outside the home is wrong from the point of view of the good of society and of the family when it contradicts and hinders these primary goals of the mission of the mother," he said. 
Radical and urgent changes arc necessary to rescue farmers from the big landowners and "to restore to agriculture their just value as the basis for a healthy economy." 
Multi-national corporations arc engaged in the condemnable practice of fixing high prices for their products while trying to keep down prices for raw materials and semi-manufactured goods, widening the gap between the rich and poor nations. 
John Paul strongly endorsed the workers' right to organize unions, to participate to some extent in the management oftheir companies and to strike, except for political purposes or in essential public services. 
He said unions are "a mouthpiece for the struggle for social justice" but added they must take into ac­count their nation's economic problems when pressing their demands.

Dining hall lines simply unacceptable 
Two years after Frank Pasquerilla donated $7 million to Notre Dame to 
build two new residence halls, the Pasquerilla dorms are finished and 
filled nearly to capacity. This begins a process which will eventually add 
500 new women to the undergraduate enrollmenf, and the effects are 
already being felt. · 
While we applaud the University's attempts to improve coeducation 
here, we must decry vehemently its lackadaisical efforts to deal with the 
overcrowding this has caused. 
The most obvious example of this overcrowding is the situation at the 
dining halls, especially North, where the Pasquerilla women now eat. 
The incredibly long lines that students are forced to wait in are an ab­
solute abomination. This was an easily foreseeable problem, and one 
dplineated in these pages last year. Yet the University has been utterly 
negligent in dealing with this difficulty. 
Perhaps this appears like petulant children making a trivial claim, but we think not. Students living on campus will pay an average of $1,865 for room and board this year, which works out to $200 per month. Where is this money going? Certainly not toward wholesale improvement of living conditions: undrinkable water, flooded bathrooms, overcrowded rooms, lack of study and social space, innumerable fire hazards, all are practically taken for granted by ND dorm residents. Is it-out of the ques­tion for students to expect to have a reasonable amount of time to eat lunch (for many, the entire noon to I p.m. period is consumed), orto eat dinner when they like? 
This is another example of an irritating inconvenience thrust upon students by the University, the sum total of which add up to a major detriment ofon-campus living. Is this the administration's subtle attempt to force more students to live off campus? We hope not. 
Considering the students' monthly rent, which is competitive at best -outlandish at worst -in comparison to off-campus costs, is it un­usually selfish to request some kind of improvement from the Univer­sity's vast endowment? In the midst of a severe recession, Notre Dame's most recent fund-raising campaign was phenomenally successful. The University now has the 21st largest endowment in the nation, and we're still climbing. A $20,000 grant to student government recently was encouraging, but more-much more-iis needed. 
A new dining facility is first on the list. Students are "blowing off' meals rather than waiting in the mind-boggling lines, and we won't even comment on the quality of the food that awaits those with extraordinary patience. With all the money available to the University, there is no reason whatsoever why students should be inconvenienced in this man­ner even one day longer. 


Reagan impoundment tries recall Nixon 
Of all President Nixon's grabs at illegal power, none was so consis­tently baffled as his repeated attempt to impound funds for programs passed by Congress. Whenever Nixon held up the money, he. was taken to court, where he lost-time after time. 
Nixon's other offenses withstood punishment, and even criticism. His secret bombing ofCambodia was un­constitutional -but Congressman Drinan could not even get it into the articles of impeachment. The viola­tion of demonstrators' rights went unpunished. Even the comparatively minor items included in the bill of impeachment when Nixon resigned had gone unpunished in the normal processes of law. But that was never

Corry Wills 
Impoundment tampers with our Constitution at a very deep level. It is part of our mystique of legitimacy Outrider that the House of Representatives 
should have the power of the purse. To relinquish that to the president is to upset the whole balance of govern­ment. To do it when the president is waxing imperial reflects a failure on the part of Congress to perform its duty. 
The absurdity of impoundment can be seen from the nature of presidential vetoes. If Congress passes a law the president does not want to execute, he can veto it-but that leaves Congress the opportunity to override his veto. If, however, a

Dear Editor: 
As a New Jersey native, I eagerly delved into Susan Kelleher's article. My enthusiasm dimmed, however, as New Jersey jokes were ack­nowledged, and disappointingly enough, even credited for their exist­ence. I'd venture to say that some of the creators of these "chemical chucklers" have had their only ex­posure to New Jersey through a 
Bruce Springsteen ballad, or a jaunt 
down the Jersey Turnpike. 
Lest it sound that ''The Garden State" is undeserved of its title, con­sider this: two-thirds of the state remains farmland and wooded areas. Southern and western New Jersey 
farms are still well-known for their vegetable and fruit yields. There ex­ist 1.2 million acres of hardwood areas in northern Jersey, while the southern portion of the state preserves I . 3 million acres of pine trees. I'd I ike to see the "garden" in the Garden State taken out of the q[!estioning quotes that too often sur­round it. 
Immigration and industry, two 

things that have made our counntry the 
richer for their existence, have solid roots in New Jersey. Both factories and farms have a large stake in N.J. history. I offer no shameful apology for my place of residence-I am on­ly sorry that some people feel it necessary to make one. And the next time someone offers you con­dolences for being a New Jerseyite, 
just send him "down to the river" for a dive.

Dear Editor: 

As a true Jerseyite (born and raised there), I have to put the picture straight so "new" Jerseyites will have some ammunition for rebuttal to "New Jersey jokes" and "condolences" referred to in Susan Kelleher's article ("The 'Garden' State," Sept. 4). 
Yes, we do have a unique culture, 
if culture means ''the enlightenment 
and refinement of taste acquired by 
intellectual and aesthetic training." 
Glassboro State Teachers College 
and Princeton University are just two of the many excellent colleges in our state, and we also have a fine state symphony orchestra. And to aid travelers from New York, Pennsyl­vania, Delaware, Maryland, Con­necticut and even the Midwest, we built the Garden State Parkway and the New Jersey Turnpike. We also have some of the finest troopers in the country to help visitors to our beautiful state arrive safely at their 
destination. 

The term "the shore" has always 
intrigued me. It extends for hundreds 
of miles. The word "scummy" has 
several meanings-the ocean after a 
northeast storm does have a scum of 
sorts (seaweed, jellyfish) which soon 
disappears. If a "rabble of low 
people" was meant, one has only to 
look at the license plates of the cars. 
College students rent many of the 
homes along the shore and are mainly out of state. 
Our fair state has taken a lot of flak about the casinos and gambling. We won't go into the morality ofit-just as we won't go into the morality of some of the films shown at Notre Dame, or in Times Square or San 
Francisco. In some ways you can compare a casino to a stock market transaction-if you have money you can "gamble"" on either one. Also, it's a form of recreation for people who do not have the money to fly to Europe, the Bahamas, etc. They get a bus and come for a day -maybe spend a few dollars and go back the same day. 
And, Susan, it's not the people from South Jersey that have that "atrocious accent": it's the people from North Jersey!

president can refuse to implement a law simply by holding up funds for it, he is given a de facto veto with no possibility of an override. This is what the courts found unconstitution­al about impoundment. 
There is no better sign of this ad­ministration's early panic than its desire to use impoundment to cut back on looming deficits. The new scheme will try to get around the courts' Nixon decisions by asking Congress for authority to impound­letting the legislature, in effect, give "up part of its law-making power to the executive. 
The apparent advantage of this is 

that it frees Congress of respon­
sibility for the specific cuts Reagan 
may decide on. But responsibility for 
such decissions is what the Constitu­
'tion exacts from representatives of 
the people. They are supposed to be 
accountable; and schemes to exempt 
them from such accountability ­
even with their cooperation, espe­
cially with their cooperation -vi­
olate the spirit of our system. 
President Reagan wants 

impoundment power, not only to 
make actual cutbacks, but to signal 
his determination to balance the 
budget. Threats of cutbacks, it is 
hoped, will have a psychological ef­
fect on the market. In that way, the 
man who says government should 
not tamper with the market is asking 
for governmental power to tamper 
with the market. 
It is not only a desperate ex­

pedient, but a feckless one. Arbitrary 
trimming will not affect the basic 
problem of "Reaganomics," which 
rides madly off in all directions. But 
it is typical of the usurping instinct 
that it tempts men most when it is in­
sufficient. President Nixon added 
power after power to his office just as 
he felt power going off. The usuper's 
urge. arises not from power, but from 
impotence-as the Reagan despera­
tion demonstrates anew.

By KELLY SULLIVAN 
Sports Writer 

Beating Louisiana State is one big reason Gerry Faust has pleasant memories about Saturday's game. But as he indicated to a host ofmedia people around the country yester­day, it's not the only thing that's made him all smiles this week. 
"Seeing how much the young men enjoyed themselves really made my day," said the Notre Dame. coach, who dressed 121 players for the home opener. Only 120 were scheduled to wear uniforms, but one player, an injured freshman, asked Faust if he could put on a jersey and run through the tunnel with his teammates. 
"After the game he came and told me, 'You don't know what a thrill that was for me, Coach,' and I said 'Yes I do, I just experienced it myself."' 
For the most p·art, Faust enjoyed his afternoon on the sidelines, but at the same time, he was also arixious for the final whistle to blow. "Coach Higgins and I are both used to the. 12 minute quarters they play in high school," he.chuckled. "We kept ask­ing Jim Johnson, 'Hey, when is this game going to get over with?' We just wanted to get that first victory under our belt." 
And that first one was worth the wait, as it gave the Irish their No. 1 ranking. "When you take the Notre Dame job, the monkey's on your back no matter what, so it doesn't

Irish reach top ... agatn 
CLOUD ONE -It came sooner than most people 
expected, or even hoped for, but the Irish are already 
atop the nation's college football polls. The last time the 
Irish topped the college ratings was last season, when 
an Arizona upset over UCLA, Alabama's loss to Mississip­

pi State and a 33-0 Irish win over Navy on November 1 combined to vault Notre Dame to the front of the col­legiate pack. ( 11-3 in 1909, 35-12 in 1943 and 12-10 in t979). Notre 

However, the glory was short-lived when the Irish Dame also boasts a combined 159-70-13 record against bother me to be rated first," Faust admitted at his weekly national telephone press conference. "Whether we deserve it or not, I don't know, but I'm sort ofenjoying it right now. I may change my mind on Saturday, though." 

That's when the 12:50 p.m. nationally-televised kick-off against last week's No. I team takes place. "Any time a great football team like !\1ichigan comes off a loss like that. they're twice as tough to beat. And Bo (Schembechler) will work them twice as hard this week, too.". 
Rumours have circled that part of Schembechkr's preparation for Notre Dame has included viewing Moeller's game films. "I know he didn't get them from Moeller," Faust said. "I've also heard Bo has !\1orehead State and Air Force films," he added, referring to the schools at which assistants Tom Lichtenberg and Tom Backhus last coached. But as to whether there was anything in those films that would help the Wol­verine coach, Faust replied with a grin, "I'm going to let Bo figure that out." 
Michigan will have its hands full figuring out how to defense against a multiple offense run by two first­string quarterbacks. Blair Kiel started last week's game and al­ternated with Tim Koegel. 
"They'll continue to alternate every two series," explained Faust, "but Tim will start based on his per­formance Saturday. We have two first-string quarterbacks, and both are very important to our offense. We feel they both can contrib1,1te to the football game." 
If one has a hotter hand than the 
other, Faust indicated the possibility 
of sticking with just that player. but 
he'd do it reluctantly. "We don't 
want to put added pressure on 
anyone hy taking him out because of 
a mistake."
