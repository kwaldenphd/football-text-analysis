Students voice concerns, Security listens 
By LIZ HARTER and 
MANDl STIRONE 
News Writers 
This is the second article in a two-part series exploring the policies ofSaint Mary's Security. 
When Saint Mary's student 
body president Mickey Gruscinski and vice president Sarah Falvey campaigned for office, they saw a need to work with Security to make the cam­pus safer and increase student's faith in the department. 
They met with Director of Security and Assistant director of Security Dave· Gariepy and Stan Klimczak shortly after win­ning the election to express their concerns about the reliability of the escort policy, but Gariepy and Klimczak brought up other issues as well. 
"[They talked about] sexual assault and informing students how to stay safe," Falvey said. "Dave also highlighted some of 

Site's 'juicy,' anonym_ous gossip prom.pts concern 
Juicycampus.com attracts users with explicit, unsigned discussions of students' personal lives 
By JOSEPH McMAHON Assistant News Editor 
Notre Dame and Saint Mary's College students have been taking advantage of a new Web site forum -juicy­campus.com -to share gos­sip and spread rumors about their fellow classmates. 
According to freshman Scott Mcintosh, while the Web site can be humorous at times. the anonymity juicycampus.com provides allows students to post what­ever they want without fear of repercussion. 
"I think it provides a way for students to vent about 
campus life in general but it leaves it open to hurt others under the veil of anonymity," he said. "I think that if mem­bers had to post their names under each post they would definitely weigh their words more and take things more seriously." 
While some topics are harmless, such as discussion of upcoming social events, others are lewd and slander­ous, littered with sexist and racist remarks. 
One of the more offensive posts included statements about African-American stu­dents that were full of racial slurs.

Hesburgh walk to benefit local schools 
By KATIE PERALTA Assistant News Editor 
Former University President Father Theodore llesburgh played an integral role in advancing social jus­tice in the 1960s, and as a tribute to his work in educa­tion, Upward Bound will host its inaugural Father Ted's Fun Hun and Walk this Sunday. 
All proceeds will benefit Upward Bound at Notre Dame, a program that serves South Bend high school stu­dents who are the first in their family to attend college. 
Punded by the Department of Education, Upward Bound has seen its funds dwindling in recent years because of budget cuts, said Kristine Yuen, a sophomore and grad­uate of the Upward Bound program. 
"The fundraiser we are doing for Upward Bound is an attempt to create an inde­pendent source of funding in case the U.S. Department of Education were to decide to cut the program in its entire­ty," Yuen said. 
The program helps its stu­dent participants graduate high school by providing a number of services, from tutoring to college visitations to SAT preparation, Coates and Yuen said. 
"[The program is] for first generation college students and students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds," Yuen said.

With the questions surround­ing the trespasser who escaped custody after making his way onto the roof of Regina Hall April 5, and seemingly slow response to the incident from Saint Mary's Security detailed in the first part of this series, many College students have concerns about the effectiveness of Saint Mary's Security. 
Falvey, however, does not think Security is ineffective.

"This shows the true senti­ments that [some students] hold deep inside," he said. "They'll say stuff like this blindly online where they know there are no repercus­sions for their actions." 
One popular trend on juicy­campus.com is to post gossip, usually having to do with sex, about one specific student. 
Saint Mary's freshman Sarah Craig has five different topics about her on the Web posters have called her, among other degrading terms, a "stripper" and a "fat troll." 
"I feel it is completely immature that people really abuse the Web site," Craig said. "It really sucks to go on there and see your name posted up not knowing who it's from and that everyone in the world can just go on there, type in your name and read about you." 
Craig chose to respond to her faceless critics by writing back and signing her name under the posts.

Proftospeak to White House,Bush 
ACE founder to talk aboutfaith-based schools 
By CLAIRE REISING 
News Writer 
Political sdence professor Father Timothy Scully will speak at Washington today about the clos­ing of almost 1,200 faith-based, inner-city schools between 2000 and 2006, as part of the White House Summit on Inner-City Children and Faith-Based Schools. 
Scully's speech, entitled "Higher Education: Signs of Hope" will draw from his work as the co­founder of the Alliance for Catholic Education (ACE), which trains col­lege graduates to work in inner­city Catholic schools. Scully, who is a former Executive Vice President of the University, is also the found­ing director of the University's Institute for Educational Initiatives. 
"In terms of the providers of faith-based educators, the ACE program is the largest and the most well-known in the country, so I suppose we were natural part­ners for them to turn to in terms of inviting us to be involved in the suminit," he said. 
Scully received an invitation directly from the White House for the summit, which President George W. Bush convened to dis­cuss ways to bolster education for inner-city schools. 
In a White House press release, Bush said the suminit will address low-income urban students' need for more educational options and

The Student Senate passed Wednesday a resolution to sup­port the implementation of online teacher and course evalu­ations to replace the paper eval­uations that are currently used in classrooms. 
The move to online evaluations is an effort of the Offices of Institutional Research and Information Technology and the Advisory Committee to the Provost of Evaluation of Teaching, Academic Affairs chair Ryan Brellenthin said.

What is Surinain? 

Harnly does a day go by without at least a baj illion honeys asking me to recount my latest brush with glory and fame on Jeopardy. J1wpardy is a swaggering temple of gcekiness. .Jeopardy is a pedestal on Brian McKenzie which any triv­ia-minded per-News l#re Editor son can scream to the world that "I know th1~ capital of' Burkina Faso and I demand money." Ineidentally, it is tho only place in the world where information learned in a typical arts and letter eourse can earn a paycheck. 
Unfortunately, my brush with immortality died pretty soon after I logged in to takn the applicants' tf)St. II' I had to offer you a short version of thn tragedy that l'ollownd, it would be "stay in school, political science majors." If' I had to oiTnr a slightly longnr vnrsion. it would be "stay in school, and please slap any Surinamians you meet." 
Thorn an~ many things you do not know about me. I was eloctnd "Most I.iknly to bn an Abnrcrombie and Fitch Centl~rf'old." I am three nations doser to world conqunst (four if' you count West Sahara). And my zeal f'or trivia is generally ranknd bntwenn "amusing" and "alarming." But there are, unfortunately, things I do not know about you -and by you, I mean you accursed Surinamolese. 
Which brings us to Suriname. 

According to the Jeopardy test, thnre is (aiiPgPdly) a country in South Amnrica that has Dutch as an ortieial language. Wnll, if' you've read this f'ar, you can probably guess that it isn't Brazil. 
"What is Suriname?" No, Suriname is not a country that has Dutch as an orticial languag(~. In f<u:t, if' I had to answer "what is Suriname," I would say that Suriname is a lie. 
To be fair, I only had to correctly answer 35 questions out of 50 to make the audition. So the sinister Surinamnrican plot was only respon­sible for a miniscule fraction or my failure. That is an acceptable excuso, if you think that there is any conceivable way that anyone could idontil'y Ulysses from its first line or the 11H7 poet laurnate. A friend who to<ik tlw same test described it as "the trivia equivalent of a slap in tho f'aeo." No. It was the trivia equiva­lent of' a kick down the stairs. I've had dental examinations that were morn enjoyable. 
Thorn is, Iwwnv(~r. good news. Apparenlly a Notre Damn alumnus with a degree in soeiology (whieh is essentially political seience minus the swagger and easy charm) got a game-show of his own. So I am not

Business major Hamm_ack nam.ed 2008 valedictorian 
Special to The Observer 
Joshua Hammack, an account­ancy major from Huntington, W.Va., has been nam~d valedic­torian of the 2008 Notre Dame graduating class and will present the valedictory address during Commencement exercises May 18 at 2 p.m. in the Joyce Center arena. 
Hammack earned a 3.99 grade point average and was a mem­ber of the Dean's List each semester. He also is a member of the Beta Gamma Sigma hon­orary business society and was a Robert C. Byrd Scholarship recipient each of his four years at Notre Dame. 
An active participant in intra­mural sports, Hammack played basketball and soccer for Zahm Hall and participated in Notre Dame's Boxing Club and Bengal Bouts. He served as a student mentor and math tutor for South Bend-area high school students and volunteered at Nazareth House in Huntington. 
The Commencement invoca­tion will be offered by Patrick Reidy, a political science major from Greenwood Village, Colo., who will graduate with a 3. 93 grade point average.

Yuen said Notre Dame's pro­gram boasts a 100 percent high school graduation rate and a 90 percent college attendance rate for its stu­dents. 
Yuen said the program has promoted the event on cam­pus through sending e-mails to hall rectors, creating a Facebook group and handing out table advertisements at North and South Dining Halls. 
The event will take place at 
3:30 p.m. and is $10 for stu­dents. A $30 family fee is available to participants who wish to register a group of up to five people 
The race will take runners 
3.. 1 miles around campus, starting near the A-10 parking lot by the Lyons basketball courts and looping the perimeter of campus. The walk follows a similar but slightly shorter route around campus. 
The race will be started by both University Executive Vice President John Affleck Graves and South Bend Community School Corporation 
Superintendent Robert Zimmerman. 
Following the race will be a reception featuring Fr. Hesburgh, who will present awards to top finishers, said Alyssia Coates, director for the Upward Bound Program at Notre Dame. 
Race organizers hope for a sizable turnout come race day. ''I'm predicting at least 
300," Coates said. 
Coates hopes to not only encourage other Upward Bound graduates to become involved in the program at Notre Dame, but also spread awareness about the pro­gram's effort through this weekend's event 
"Because we are here on campus, people don't know how involved we are in the [South Bend] community," Coates said. 
Coates said the program is also reaching out to students at Indiana University South Bend (IUSB), Saint Mary's College, Ivy Tech, Bethel and Holy Cross College, since Upward Bound sends students to those schools as well.

Information Forms (CIF), and graphical representation of stu­dent's ratings of course content and teaching style will be avail­able in a joint system, Informing Course Selection (ICS), Brellenthin said. 
The evaluation forms will be e­mailed to students and the stu­dents will have two weeks to submit the forms before study days, he said. After submitting the CIF, they will be free to access the ICS, which will give them information from evalua­tions to aid them in choosing courses for the next semester. 
Brellenthin said there several advantages to the new system, such as a longer time to fill out the CIF and more privacy while doing so. 
"Many students don't take the time to fill out [the current paper evaluations]," he said. "They don't put in much effort and then they leave class early." 
Many students feel the pres­sure to rush through the evalua­tions or are hampered by a lack of privacy, Brellenthin said. 
"The data being collected isn't that great," he said. "And the online forms will enable students to take more time to carefully fill out the forms." 
The ICS is another benefit to the online system, as it allows students to access the evaluation results, Brellenthin said. 
"The ICS will have information on the type of text books used, the workload, whether the class is mostly lectures or discussions and so on," he said. 
The current Teacher Course Evaluations seem to get lost in a black hole, he said. The online system will allow students to actually see the information gathered from the evaluations. 
Although the resolution passed, many senators voiced concerns on the switch from the paper form to an online form. 
Sorin Senator Michael Sayles questioned whether students would be motivated to fill out the forms outside of class. 
"Students may have a really hard time going online and find­ing the time to evaluate flve classes," he said. 
Student body vice president Grant Schmidt said students will not be. able to access the ICS information when darting if they did not fill out the CIF. 
"There is the incentive about 
having objective information 
about classes," he said. 

Several senators also raised 
the objection that the ICS will 
motivate students to seek out 
"easy classes" with fewer papers 
and lighter reading loads. 

"These evaluations are not in 
the spirit of higher education," 
Gender Issues chair Patrick 
Tighe said. "If you want to know 
about course, talk to the profes­
sor or an advisor. [Education] is 
not about making decisions 
about courses based on num­
bers." 

While the switch to online ·course evaluations will occur, the 
committees in charge of the tran­
sition will consider the issues 
raised by senators and continue 
to consult with student govern­ment to improve the system, Academic Affairs chair Brellenthin said.

HARAHE -Zimbabwe's ruling party floated a proposal Wednesday for forming a government of national unity led by President Robert Mugabe as a way out of a political crisis that has dragged on lor weeks.

In a statement released with last Thursday's resignations. the five said Daniels and his administration broke "many, many promises" madn to the 15-member Native American Indian A!Tairs Commission. 
Among other things, they said the panel was left gridlocked and powerless by the adminis­tration's failure to fill all the vacancies on the commission. The members also said the group never received computers or the Web site it was promised by the state.

Associated Press 

CANBERRA, Australia ­The Australian leg of the Olympic torch relay began Thursday, shortly after minor protests erupted among supporters and detractors of China's gov­ernment that left two peo­ple detained. 
Thousands of people lined the planned relay route on the cool but sunny autumn day as police manned crowd-con­trol barriers and vowed that nothing would stop the torch from completing its trip through Australia's capital. 
The relay began without major inCident as a half­dozen police officers -in running pants, T-shirts and baseball caps ­formed a loose cordon around the runner. 
Overhead, an airplane sky writer wrote the words "Free Tibet" in giant white letters.

Dolors. another student in the class. also made an attempt to find a professor, when she wturnnd. Security had still not arrived, she said. 
When Security did arrive, a Notre Dame fire unit and an ambulanco arrived shortly after them, Garinpy said lie said three officers responded to the situa­tion. 
"Although Saint Mary's Security was not the first called, we worn the first to arrive." he said. 
Aftor their arrival, the security guards lirst reaction was to have the ambulance leave, Gay said. 
"We heard them say to send the ambulance back because he thought she tripped," Gay said. 
Deters also heard the ambu­lance being asked to leave, she said. 
"I was rather shocked about it. I wiould expect that when some­one randomly passes out they would be rushed to the hospital and have medical attention immediately," she said. 
After students begged Kiene to do so, the ambulance returned and she was taken to be exam­ined, Gay said. 
Gariepy said that when Sgt Gene Nevins, the first to arrive, got to the Hegina Hall classroom, he found a conscious Kiene with several stud<mts and that she "was convenced to go to the hos­pital for an examination." 
He and Klimczak arrived short­ly after Nevins, Gariepy said. 
Students in the class were repremanded by security officers for how they handled the situa­tion, Gay said. 
"Security came up to us and asked why we called 911 and not 
just Security," she said. Gariepy said that no repre­mand was made. 
"Students in the classroom were not repremanded for call­ing 911 before calling us, they were thanked for their assistance and congratulated on a job well done," he said. 
Students are also advised to call 911 on the Saint Mary's Web site.

Ac1~ording to tho White I louse prnss rnlnasn, topics will include how faith-based schools have served tlw "eornmon good" of dis­advantaged studenLo.;, a'> well a'> tlw linandal challnngns these schools -which operate on families' and donors' contributions -face, among other related topics. 

Scully's speech will dL<>cuss higher education's potential role in strengthening !~lith-based schools. lie will draw from his 10-year experience with ACE and other Catholic universities around the nation that have since begun simi­lar programs. 
"Th~1 organizers of the summit a'iknd ACE to think about ... what am the ways in which higher edu­cation can partner with other insti­tutions in order to play a role in stren~-,rthnning and sustaining inner­eity faith-based schools," Scully said. "Ttw talk that I'm f.,riving really draws deeply upon the experience of ACE at Notre Dame but goes beyond it to invite other institutions of higher learning to eonsider some of tim sanw strate1-,ries." 
Scully said the issues faith-based schooL<> face have changed in three major areas since ACE began in 1994: leadership needs, financial stewardship and demographics. 
While ACE was originally found­ed to provide teachers. Scully said the schooL.:; the program serves are in a "crL<>L'> ofleadership" and need administrative leaders to replace retirees. They have increasingly relied on lay people to fill these posL<> and the ACE Leadership pro­gram was initiated to train future principal<>. 
Other issues in question, Scully said, are the expectancy for more transparency within institutions and more lay participation in school boards. 
"[Wei have to train local schools to form boards and to w1derstand Jay governments and to have appropriate accounting practices that are transparent and auditable," he said. 
Another change is that despite a growing Latino population across the U.S., only three percent of Latino families send their children to Catholie schooL<>, Scully said. 
"If we can't attract and include more aggressively Latino fan1ilies in our schools, we will not be able to provide the kind of ... experience that we have to," he said. 
Despite the program's challenge to address thL'i new agenda, Scully said he sees hope for the future of faith-based education, both in the institutions' ability to respond to problems they face and in the gov­ernment's cooperation with faith­based initiatives. 
"Crises have an important role to play in the life of institutions and organizations, if they'm rnsponded to," Scully said. "It mally is true that crises can provide opportunities for organizations who otherwise might not have responded to the changing environment." · 
From a historical perspective, Scully said this interaetion bntween Catholicism and the U.S. govern­ment, a<> shown in thn summit and papal visit, is pivotal <t.'i a change from anti-Catholic attitudes in American hL'itory. 
"This L'i a school system that wa'i viciously attacked in tim 19th cen­tury by the publk arona," he said. "It seems that those who are responsible fi>r Ameriea's common good -eleeted ollidalo.; -are mal­ly willing to engage tlw importancn in the contribution these schools oll'er, and that, to me, speaks of hope."

IN BRIEF Company sued over water pollution 
PROVIDENCE -An energy company has agreed to pay residents of a polluted water­front neighborhood and to clean up the mas­sive contamination that turned the soil under their homes blue, lawyers for the neighbors said Wednesday, though the company said a deal had not been reached. 
Attorneys Robert McConnell and Mark Roberts, who represent nearly 100 property owners, told The Associated Press they reached a tentative settlement with Southern Union Co., but said the terms were sealed so they would not discuss details. 
Jonathan Gasthalter, a spokesman for Houston-based Southern Union, said the case had not been resolved. The company has denied wrongdoing. 
Jury selection was to have begun Wednesday. 
Hoberts said the neighbors had approved the settlement; many contacted Wednesday said they had been advised by their attorneys not to comment. 
"We've met with our clients and Southern Union, and we're all optimistic that this is going to be resolved," Hoberts said.

Lolcats became an Internet craze last year. A typical example shows a picture of a fat and hopeful cat accompanied by a caption in a baby-talk-like dialect known as Lolspeak: "I CAN HAS CHEEZBURGER?"

Ailing air companies plan merger 
High gas prices, value decreases cause Delta and Northwest's desire to unite 
Associated Press 
ATLANTA -Delta and Northwest, seeking to com­bine to create the world's largest airline, posted loss­es Wednesday totaling $10.5 billion for the first three months of the year due to exorbitant fuel prices and write-downs of their companies' value. 
Southwest's chief execu­tive, meanwhile, indicated that the carrier wasn't interested in a merger and said the very thought of it was daunting. 
The figures from Delta and Northwest follow large losses at other carriers, such as United Airlines par­ent UAL Corp., which earli­er this week reported a $537 million first-quarter loss on higher fuel costs, and likely rank among the industry's largest quarterly losses ever.

Yes. that Faeebook invitation from a high school frinnd welcomed me back to campus after Christmas break l'rnshman year. 
Unfortunately, I couldn't make it to Sex Toys 101. For one, a joke birthday present has more than satisfied my interest in the nuances of dildo and harness technology. For two-and I'm sorry you have to read this, Mom -I'm pretty sure I can imagine the "tribulations" of anal toys without an interaetive public event (yes, it made me uncomfortable to read that line, too). For three, and most importantly, the event was at ColUI11bia in northwest Manhattan. Sex Toys 101 didn't end til 9:30. I'd never get back for dorm mass at 10. 
I'm trying to picture the reaction to a proposed similar conference at Notre Dame. Imagine it now: "The College of Arts and Letters and Zahm Hall present 'Sex under the Dome. Uterally."' 
The reaction would be swift and pre-

lire back about the importance of engag­

the paternalistic anti-sex attitude of Notre

It would be the typical Notre Dame dis­cu.ssion, but on steroids. Each side ques­tions tho legitimacy of thn other side-not just their arhruments, but their entire exis­tence. The debates are pnrsonal and polarizing. 
Thesn conversations arn easy to mock. In faet, the anti-conversation viewpoint has become a popular viewpoint of its own. An entire Viewpoint-page subculture (nanoculturn?) has emnrgnd. It's as dismis­sive towards polarizing cultural conversa­tions as the sides of those conversations are to nach other. 
But if nducation is about preparing us to confhmt the world, it is our mockable con­versations-parietals, adding sexual ori­entation to thfl non-discrimination elause, The Vagina Monologues. recognizing a gay-straight student alliance, etc-that make Notrn Dame the best school in the country. 
The way we talk about issues at Notre Dame more closely resembles the way people outside of college bubbles talk about things. We discuss whether we should embrace sex on campus. not how many sex toy clinics we should put on. Much as it pains many of us, our conversa­tions question the morality of homosexual­ity, not invite us -to usc another Columbia-based Facebook event-to a "Gender Holes in the Bedroom" confer­ence for Queer Awareness Month. We ask how much diversity can exist within our Catholic identity, rather than assume diversity is an end in itself. 
Our conversations. sometimes laughably, pit certainty against certainty. They pit traditional religion against liberalism. They pit liberals against conservatives, not more liberals against fewer libnrals. 
The vitriolic reaction to lif'nstyles and choices on campus mirrors the vitriolic reaction that, for bnttnr or worse, typifies conversations in this country. On the othnr side. the dismissivn rmu:tion of traditional­ism as ignorance -whorn wn vilify reli­gious-based viewpoinL'>-reflecl'i the typos of conversations wn'll have aftnr graduation.

On a summer of paying attention 
I will admit to you, in this last Faithpoint column of the year, that I have a bit of iPod envy. Now it's not that I don't own one (in fact I don't, but my husband is generous in sharing his). My difficulty is this: I cannot get Kate Barrett those little car buds to stay in my ears. The proper Faithpoint parts of my cars must not be appro­priately "bud-shaped." When I walk across campus, then, and I see so many of you coming out of your halls just casually shoving those little guys into place with about two seconds of unconscious effort, I do feel a bit jeal­ous. If I want to listen to a book on tape while I clean the house, I have to twist the cords around my ears in a way that my children find quite hilari­ous (of course, if I ever went out this way they would find it quite mortify­ing). And exercise? Forget it. Three steps into a run those buds would be llopping uselessly down around my shoulders -or dangerously down around my feet. 
Living in this iPod-challenged way has, however. given me some impor­tant insights that I would like to pass on to you as summer approaches. So this is it. Take 'em out. Remove those alluring little silver and white circles you so easily slip into your ears with­out even thinking about it-or at least do think twice before popping them in. 
Though you may doubt the sincerity of my motivations, I do not say this out of jealousy, but only because I have gained a few insights through my struggles with the buds. When I do manage actually to listen to an iPod successfully, I immediately pay consid­erably less attention to anyone else around me, or to my surroundings in general. And there's something a little weird about greeting someone who's listening to their iPod. Do you exchange silent nods? Stop to say hello and actually talk, which would entail a quick fumble with the click-wheel or hasty earbud removal? Should you feel offended if you rate the removal of only one bud? Prideful if your approach on the quad prompts both ears to be freed up for conversation? 
If you need your iPod to get through this last week of class and the approach of finals, fine. Perhaps this particularly lovely time of the semester isn't when you should try to change your listening habits. However, think about all you have to look forward to after these next two weeks of caffeine­fueled, sleep-deprived, stress-filled overdrive. You will be saying goodbye to great friends, perhaps some for quite a while. You will reunite with your family and friends from home; start a summer job, internship or serv­ice project; travel to new places; live with new roommates. 
Let this be a summer of attentive­ness. Why not aim for full awareness of the people and the environment that surrounds us? 
Catholic Christians have a uniquely sacramental faith: We believe in God's presence all around us and in every­thing. That means that while we know God particularly wants to find us through the seven sacraments of the Church, he also desperately hopes you'll notice the fact that he's right there in your friendships; in the love of your parents; in the poor you will serve through your Summer Service Projects; in that spot in your backyard you can't wait to get home to and in that spot on campus you'll be heart­broken to leave; in your residence hall chapel on campus and in the church you'll go home to in a few weeks. Look for God this summer; seek out the Lord in people, the ones you know and those you'll meet; look for him espe­cially in your prayer; know of his pres­ence when you hear the Scriptures proclaimed at Mass and when you receive the Eucharist. 
If you tuck that iPod (and that cell phone, by the way) away in your pock­et a little more frequently this summer you'll still have many chances to listen, but your listening will change. In these next few months, become more aware of and present to your friends, to your mentors, to your employers. Don't for­get to really listen to your parents ­you will be amazed by how much they've learned while you have been away at school. 
Have a wonderful summer -and don't forget to pay attention!

In response to this semester's constant stream of Viewpoints discussing the Vagina Monologues, alco­hol consumption on campus, parietals, and of course, what really grinds Tim Loftus' gears, I have only one answer: shut up. After almost four years of observation, wonder, and silent appreciation, and in thanks to the many contributions of my close friends Bill and Brogan (without whom this article would not have been possible). I present to you an Eleanor Bradley-inspired rendition of ... "You Know What Really Floats My Boat?" Because, quite frankly, I am sick of everyone here ripping on Notre Dame and each other. So here it is -what really floats my boat about Notre Dame: 
The fact that students can declare they hate peo­ple with an unnecessary sense of entitlement, yet feel entitled to publish a diatribe about what they hate about the fake-tanning, Rock of Love-loving common folk who populate our campus ... the white chocolate chip cookies at North Dining Hall ... the Crucifix that hangs in every classroom ... the Academic Forum held this year ... the concept that at home my friends ask if I am even going to be graduating on time, and my friends here assume that I am, and then ask what I will be doing next year ... that excellence is common here, and I have friends whose future plans I can brag about (ACE, Teach for America, Google, and Georgetown Med School to name only a few) ... that I can get a 32 oz. Beer in South Bend for $4 instead of the $5 domes­tic bottles you find in a city ... that I have a friend who is involved in the Vagina Monologues AND spent time serving in Africa ... that we have squir­rels the size of my little brother on this campus ... broomball ... Bookstore Basketball ... Health Services, where I once heard a nurse asking a male with a broken foot if there was any chance he had mono or was pregnant ... the Grotto ... the musical stylings of one DJ Sticky Boots ... that 55 degree weather is celebrated (North Quad Beach anyone?) ... games such as Murder ball, Beer Die, and Civil War Pong ... that a Moral Problems class inspired the most conservative Southerner I know to attend the Vagina Monologues ... pushups at football games ... Reekers being open 24/7 ... Wednesday night bowling league ... that I have friends who, even when studying abroad, still volunteered at soup kitchens ... the Alumni support and enthusiasm ... that last year my mom had a 30-year reunion with her abroad friends from ND and 80 percent of them came ... that we allow controversial plays such as the Vagina Monologues on campus, yet still mark every major world and University event with a Mass ... new and old traditions: Pigtostal, movies on the quad, and the Fisher Regatta for starters ... Fish · bowls at Rum Runners ... an Accounting professor who casually quoted both Thomas Merton and C.S. Lewis in class this week ... Jordan Hall of Science, most incredible building I have ever seen at a col­lege ... professors who don't bring their politics to class, but rather donuts for my 22nd birthday (yeah, it happened, thanks again, Prof. Glowacki!) ... watching my best friend present an incredible thesis at a National Conference only two days after tearing up the dance floor with me at Finnegan's ... friends who support each other in any activity ... legendary professors like Prof. Ackermann, McKenna, and Venter, in addition to others ... the Golden Dome, the Basilica, and the lakes ... and the fact that most outsiders hate our school because, honestly, they're just jealous. 
So my advice to everyone before I leave this beloved University is the following: Have some respect for others, and some pride in yourself and your school. Stop whining, stop complaining, stop trashing each other, and call your parents. Thank them for the $40,000 they shell out every year to give you an invaluable education, amazing friends, and an experience that will undoubtedly influence the rest of your life.

WIN 
By JAMES COSTA 
Scene Writer 
Lnslin Feist is doing prntty well. After years of singing with Broken Soda! Senne and a rather successful first solo record "Let It Die." it's clear that life is treating her pretty kindly. With her newnst album "The Hmninder," Feist has achieved com­mercial success. Unlike on the standout track of "Let It Die," "Mushaboom," when Feist sang, "It may bl1 years until the day my drnams will match up with my pay," the need for morn cash is surely no longer pressing on her mind. 
I lownver, to her likely dismay and the lis­tener's delight, her life still seems rife with the influences of heartbreak, solitude and the desire to both hold onto and let go of rapidly fading but still darkly penntrating memories. 
With most of the tracks bning written on the road between gigs all around the world, there is a distinct feeling of move­ment and displacement running through the album. 
Without a place to hold onto and without a love to return to in the evening, Feist sings of a world that she finds much beau­ty in, except that it is a tragic and often tor­mented beauty. 
In an interview on Pitchfork, she states, "You just never set roots; you take pleasure in simple conversations, because you know you're not going to have much more than that." Her words provide

The track that pnrhaps summarizns and explains "The Hmninder" best is "The Park."

Daniel started dating Wilhelmina's sister. Hence (Gabrielle Union). In my personal opinion, the more Slaters on the show, the better. If

Christina moved into Wilhelmina's apartment to carry the spawn of 
Wilhelmina and the deceased Bradford Meade. That's right. Wilhelmina extracted sperm from Bradford's dead body in order to give birth to an heir and finally claim her piece of the Meade empire. It may be the lowest Wilhelmina has ever gone to get what she wants, but

Amanda found out that her father with the Tweety Bird tattoo on his butt is KISS rocker Gene Simmons. I could­n't be happier that Amanda finally knows who her birth father is, espe­cially since her search for him led her to write and perform the song "Gene Simmons is My Daddy."

then again, there's quite a bit we don't know about her past (including her life as lowly assistant Wanda). What will happen when the world finds out there is another Meade child? We know Claire won't be too happy about it. 
Claire announced that she's going to launch a new magazine for women over 50, called "Hot Flash." Her chil­dren may be skeptical about their mother's ability to launch a magazine, but I have total confidence in Claire based on the title of her magazine dancer.

MLB 
Cincinnati fires GM, hires Jocketty 
Associated Press 
With Walt Jocketty, the question wa<;when. 
When would the Cincinnati Reds decide to switch general managers and give Jocketty the chance to turn them into winners? 
The answer: 21 games into the season. 
Off to their worst start in five years, the Reds fired Wayne Krivsky on Wednesday and replaced him with Jocketty, who built consistent winners during 10 seasons running the Oakland Athletics and 13 with the St. Louis Cardinals. 
"We've just come to a point where we're not going to lose any­more," Reds owner Bob Castellini said emphatically. 
Jocketty is the fourth general manager in six years for a team that has gone through seven straight losing seasons. The Reds have been through four managers (plus an interim manager) and two owners since 2003, when they moved into Great American Ball Park. It's their deepest slump in a half-century.

Jocketty's job is to provide direc­tion. He'll likely get more of a chance than Krivsky, who walked into Castellini's office on Wednesday morning anticipating a regular baseball meeting. 
He was shocked when told he was fired. 
"I fought for an hour to keep my job," Krivsky said. "I did not see this coming at all. I still think it's a gold mine. That's what hurts so much, not to see the job through to the end and bring that winner to Cincinnati. I've had visions of being in the clubhouse with champagne being poured all over everybody."

NFL 
Commissioner to meet with Walsh 
Associated Press 
Matt Walsh will get his day with the eommissioner. What he has to offer is anyone's guess. 
The former Patriots assistant will meet with NFL eommission­er Roger Goodell on May 13 about New England's videotap­ing of opposing teams. It took a eouple of months, but the league reached an agreement with Walsh on Wednesday. 
"Commissioner Goodell will meet with Mr. Walsh ... on May 13, the earliest date that Mr. Walsh, who lives in Hawaii, will bP available on the East Coast." the NFL statement said. "The agreement also requires Mr. Walsh to return any tapes and other items in his possession that belong to the Patriots. In return, the NFL and the Patriots have promised not to sue Mr. Walsh. They also will indemnify him for any expensPs, including legal fees that he incurs in con­nection with the interview."

nearly five months after the­Patriots were sanctioned for ille­gal taping of the New York Jets in the season opener _ a $500,000 fine for coach Bill Belichick, a $250,000 fine for the organization, and the loss of a first-round draft pick on Saturday ... there were mports of possible other videotaping by the Patriots. Those reports cen­ten~d on Walsh, who shot videos for the Patriots during his six­year stint with the organization. 
Since the Super Bowl, Goodell's staff' has sought a meeting with Walsh. 
"Today, Mr. Walsh and the National Football League reached an agreement under which the NFL will provide legal indemnifkation and a release of claims against Mr. Walsh relat­ing to his employment by the Patriots and the Patriots' video­taping operations," said Walsh's lawyer, Miehael L1wy of McKee Nelson LLP. "I am pleased that we now have an agreement that provides Mr. Walsh with appro­priate legal protections. Mr. Walsh is looking forward to pro­viding the NFL with the materi­als he has and telling the NFL what hn knows." 
So what might Walsh have and what does hn know'? The Patriots say he has nothing.

Squad, Sharpley trump Mastodons 
By FRAN TOLAN Associate Sports Editor 
Seems like the same old story. With another solid effort from both the offense and pitching staff, No. 24 Notre Dame cruised to a 5-0 win over IPFW Wednesday at Memorial Stadium in Fort Wayne, Ind. The Irish have now won 14 of their last 15 games while running their record to 27-10-1. 
Freshman starter Hyan Sharplfly threw six scoreless innings and struck out six, allowing just two hits and three walks. 
And Sharpley got plenty of help. Sophomore right l'ielder Billy Boockford led the charge for the offense, pounding out a earner-high four hits while knocking in three of Notre Dame's runs. Sophomore eenterl'ielder A.J. Polloek did a little bit of everything, notching two hits, two stolen bases, a run scored and an HBI. 
The Irish relief pitching also picked up Sharpley as sophomore right-hander Steven Mazur, senior righty Tony Langford and junior righty Brent Graffy ead1 tossed a scoreless inning of relief'. 
Notn~ Dame jumped out to the early lead, staking Sharpley to a three-run lead before he even toed the rub­ber. In the top of the first, Irish senior shortsop Brett Lilley led off by getting hit by a pitch, the lOist beaning of his Notre Dame career. Sophomore designated hitter
