The Show returns to campus today 
Annual concert will feature hip-hop duo The Cool Kids, pop-punk band Good Charlotte 
ByJENNMETZ News Editor 
The Joyce Center Arena will be filled students from Notre Dame, Saint Mary's and Holy Cross tonight to see multi-plat­inum rock band Good Charlotte and the lesser-known rap duo The Cool Kids at The Show 2008. 
Junior Matt Barloh, the chair­man for The Show 2008, told the Observer via e-mail that: "The Show 2008 is special because, in Good Charlotte, it has a headliner with greater name recognition than any other performer in the history of The Show." 
The Cool Kids, a hip-hop duo with a 1980s style, are "the next great" hip-hop artists, Barloh said. According to The Show press release, they have collaborated with chart-topping rapper Lil' Wayne and were labeled one of Rolling Stone's Top 10 Artists to Watch in 2008. 
The Show has a history of bringing up-and-coming artists to campus in recent years. Last year's lineup featured OK Go and rapper Lupe Fiasco. 
The Cool Kids are "more of an obscure band," freshman Mary McAllister said. "I've never heard their music, but I've heard good things about them."

Council adds day to Thanksgiving break 
By KAITLYNN RIEL¥ Associate News Editor 
Talk of turkeys is still far off in the distanc;~, but at Notre Dame, Thanksgiving will come early this year. 
The University's Academic Council, which consists of many University officials, including University president Fr. John Jenkins, voted to add the Wednesday before Thanksgiving to the Thanksgiving recess, extend­ing Notre Dame's typical Thanksgiving holiday by one day. 
"One of the driving factors is that we are a national University, and you would expect that students would want to be with family at the Thanksgiving holidays ... and we were going all the way through Wednesday before Thanksgiving, so it's hard to get out of South Bend," University Registrar Harold Pace said. 
During Freshman Orientation Weekend, Anthony Travel, the travel company with an office located in the basement of laFortune, pro­moted its services while informing parents of incoming students about the new recess days, said Mary Kowalski, the vice president of travel servic­

SMC puts recycHng bins in donns 
Move part of new effort to increase environmental awareness 
By ASHLEY CHARNLEY 
News Writer 
With the every-growing emphasis on environmental awareness, Saint Mary's is working to improve the recy­cling on campus by placing blue bins in every student's dorm room. 
Saint Mary's administra­tors hope the move will encourage more students to recycle. 
"In the past, the students were somewhat lax in put­ting the recycling where it should be. We often found trash in the recycling bins," director of Building Services Marilyn Rajski said.

Clubs recruit new members at fair 
By LIZ HARTER Saint Mary's Editor 
Hoping to woo new fresh­men, 98 campus clubs and outside organizations intro­duced themselves to Saint Mary's students at the College's annual club fair Thursday night in the Angela Athletic Facility. 
The Board of Governance (BOG) campus clubs commis­sioner Becky Whitaker began planning the event last spring, and said she was pleased with the turnout. 
"I walked around to a lot of tables and everyone had a good turnout. I love this night," she said. "I love that everybody wants to get involved." 

Student body president Mickey Gruscinski agreed that the turnout was excel­lent this year. 
"We had t-shirts at our [student government] table," Gruscinski said. "We had a lot of people stop and pick one up." 
The student government table also had sign-up sheets for first year students inter­ested in running for class president. That election will take place on Thursday, Sept. 11, elections commissioner Francesca. Johnson announced at Wednesday's

Popping the bubble 
One year ago last week I became 
what those in the Saint Mary's and 
Notre Dame bubble call "townies." 
With the exception of three weeks 
spanning the last few weeks of July 
and first few of August and regularly 
scheduled academic breaks (Fall, 
Christmas and Spring) I have resided in 
this fair city of 107,789 people (accord­
ing to the 2000 census).

mer as a features 
intern with the 
South Bend Tribune. I lived on the first 
floor of a house located on the edge of 
one of the many ghettos South Bend 
has to oiler otl' of Lincoln Way West. 
Spending so much time in South Bnnd -especially over the summer when them aren't football games and student nights at Club Fever, The Backer and Rum Runners to distract me -I learn11d how to successfully and quickly navigate the one-way streets of downtown and discovered many new things about the eity and surrounding area which I'm going to share with you to potentially pop the lovely bubble in which we live. Pick a place and check it out sometime. 
+Thistlnberry Farm: Located just outside South Bend at 61391 Mayllownr Hoad this farm is a great place to go on non-football weekends in the fall. It dm~sn't eost much money to wind your way through the exten­sive corn mazes cut into the fields here. The main mazn this year is called Lost in Spact) and it takes, on average, an hour and 45 minutes to go through it. If you're directionally challenged, however. like my friends and I are you muld potentially visit this maze for an entin) afternoon and not lind your way out. 
+Battell Park: I'll admit I would never have found this one on my own. I had to cover a story at the band shell at this park for the Tribune this sum­mer and my roommate and I ended up spending an entire evening revisiting our childhood at this Mishawaka park located at 301 North Mishawaka Ave. It has a beautiful rock garden and a play­ground with an excellent old-school merry-go-round that can make your stomach feel like it's in your throat. Mishawaka also has a three-mile walk­ing trail by the river if you're looking liJr someplacn to walk oll'-campus. 
+Potawatomi Zoo: While this zoo is no Lineoln Park it's pretty good for a smallnr city. They have animals that I've never smm bnfore like the Golden Lion Tamarin and thn Golden Mantella. They also have a collection of tortoises that were racing nach other when I vis­ited on the Fourth of July. They move a lot faster than I thought they would ... 
+Erskine Village: This collection of stores on the south side of the city (Ireland Hoad) provides a welcome shopping alternative during busy weekends on Grape Road and Main Street. Even though the Target here is smaller than the one on Main Street it's worth the 10 minute drive to avoid crowds.

ND History Dept. No. 1 in ACLS Fellowships 
Special to The Observer 
If recent history repeats itself, University of Notre Dame histori­ans will enjoy looking to the future. 
Over the last three years, Notre Dame's Department of History has won more research fellow­ships from the American Council of Learned Societies (ACLS) than any other university in the coun­try and, in fact, has accumulated 20 external fellowships over that time period, more than a dozen of which are from agencies used by the National Research Council (NRC) to assess the strength of humanities departments. 
A federation of 70 national scholarly organizations, the ACLS is the preeminent representative of American scholarship in the humanities and related social sci­ences. 
Ahead of all other Top 25 research universities, Notre Dame's history department has earned six ACLS fellowships since 2005, compared with four for Brown University; three each for Harvard, Yale and Vanderbilt Universities; two each for Stanford, Princeton and Northwestern Universities; and one for Columbia University. 
"I think my colleagues have been so successful because they bring an unusual combination of erudition, originality and ambi­tion to their work," said Thomas Noble, professor and chair of his­tory and a past recipient of National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) and Fulbright fellowships. 
This year's ACLS honorees are planning academic leaves to immerse themselves in their research. 
John Van Engen, Notre Dame's Andrew V. Tackes Professor of History, is working on a major reinterpretation of the intellectu­al and cultural life of 12th centu­ry Europe. He also is the recipi­ent of a 2008 NEH research fel­lowship.

Alullllli Assn. to present aw-ards 
Special to The Observer 
The University of Notre Dame Alumni Association will present four awards during ceremonies on campus this fall. 
The Rev. John J. Cavanaugh, C.S.C., Award honoring distin­guished public service will be presented Sept. 4 to Percy A. Pierre, a 1961 Notre Dame grad­uate, University Trustee and for­mer Michigan State University vice president. 
Pierre, who earned his mas­ter's degree from Notre Dame and doctorate from Johns Hopkins University, is recognized as the first African-American to earn a doctoral degree in electri­cal engineering. 
In 1969, Pierre began a series of administrative posts in gov­ernment and higher education. He was the principal architect of the national minority engineer­ing effort after he co-chaired the 1973 National Academy of Engineering (NAE) Symposium. He also served as the program officer at the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation for minority engi­neering for which he developed and funded many organizations, including the National Consortium for Graduate Degrees for Minorities in Engineering and Science Inc. (GEM program), which was housed for 30 years at Notre Dame. 
Pierre left academia in 1977 to become an assistant secretary for research, development and acquisition in the U.S. Department of the Army. He managed some $10 billion annu­ally for the research, develop­ment and production of weapons systems for the Gulf War. He returned to academic service in 1983 as president of Prairie View A&M University and served as vice president of research and graduate studies at Michigan State from 1990 to 1995. 
Currently a consultant and board member in the areas of management and education, Pierre also is director of CMS Energy Inc., the White House Fellows Foundation and Association, and TracLabs Inc. 
Carolyn Manning, a 1987 Notre Dame graduate and founder of the Welcome to America project in Phoenix, will receive the Family Exemplar Award recognizing distinguished community service Sept. 4. 

The Welcome to America proj­ect is a response of solidarity fol­lowing the Sept. 11, 2001, ter­rorist attacks, which claimed the life of Manning's brother-in-law. Acknowledging the connection the U.S. felt with those suffering throughout the world, she start­ed the project as a way to reach out through a bridge of under­standing between newly arriving refugees and her volunteer corps. Since 2001, Welcome to America has delivered furniture and household items totaling some $500,000 to 500 refugee families. 
Manning earned a master's degree in public administration from Seattle University ip. 1992 and, since 1987, has served her community as a crisis worker, case manager and manager. Her strong belief in the goodness of humanity has aided her deter­mination to make every individ­ual feel welcome in society. 
Bryant Young, a 1994 Notre Dame graduate and former Irish and professional football player, will receive the Harvey G. Foster Award during a halftime cere­mony at the Notre Dame-San Diego State game Sept. 6. The Foster Award is given annually to a Notre Dame graduate distin­guished for athletic endeavors and community service. 
An All-American defensive tackle for the Irish, Young played for 13 years with the San Francisco 49ers before retiring last year with 89 career sacks. His NFL accolades include Defensive Rookie of the Year, four Pro-Bowl and All-Pro hon­ors, selection to the 1990s All Decade Team and Comeback Player of the Year after suffering a potentially career-ending leg injury in 1999. Last year, Young's teammates voted him the winner of the Len Eshmont Award, the team's most presti­gious honor for inspirational and courageous play, for a record eighth time. No other player in 49ers history has won the award more than twice. · 
Young and his wife, Kristin (also a 1994 Notre Dame gradu­ate), established the Young Dreams Foundation, which ben­efits youth organizations in San Francisco and Chicago. The support~: summer youth football camps and college tuition for San Francisco Bay-area stu­dents. In a.ddition, the Youngs have established several scholar­ships at Notre Dame for San Francisco and Chicago students. 
For his philanthropic efforts, Young was named USA Today's Most Caring Athlete in 2000 and was nominated as one of the 10 Most Influential African­Americans in the Bay area. 
The Rev. William Corby, C.S.C., Award honoring distinguished military service will be presented to Air Force Lt. Gen. Henry A. "Trey" Obering, a 1973 gradu­ate, during a halftime ceremony at the NotJre Dame-Stanford game Oct. 4. 
Director of the Missile Defense Agency IMDA) in the Office of the Secretary of Defense, Obering serves as the acquisition execu­tive for all ballistic missile defense systems and programs. He joined the Air Force in 1973 after gJ~aduating from Notre Dame's HOTC program. 
During more than three decades of service, Obering has established himself as an effec­tive leader in engineering opera­tions. He worked extensively with the Space Shuttle program, participating in 15 launches as a NASA orbiter project engineer and was responsible for integrat­ing firing room launch opera­tions. 
Prior to his position in the MDA, Obering served as the mis­sion an:a director for informa­tion dominance where he planned and programmed 68 joint Air Force and international programs. He also has served in Top Gun, Air-to-Air and the F­4E Replacement Training Unit.

His military education includes the Squadron Officer School, Air Command and Staff College and the Industrial College of the Armed Forces. Hi.s personal decora­tions include the Defense SuperioJr Service Medal, Legion of Merit, 1chree Meritorious Service Medals, Air Force Commendation Medal, and Air Force Aehievement Medal. 


Fordbrings European carstoP.illlerica 
Associated Press 
MICHIGAN -It seems like an easy solution: Americans are look­ing for more fuel-efficient vehicles, so Ford Motor Co. is bringing over some of the small, gas-sipping cars it's been selling to Europeans for years. 
But introducing the cars to the 
U.S. market isn't as simple as changing the speedometer from kilometers to miles. Ford has to reconcile American and European safety regulations -everything from the color of rear turn signals to the positioning of crash test dummies -that will keep the cars from hitting U.S. highways anytime soon. 
Competing interests among automakers, governments and the insurance industry are hampering efforts to standardize safety requirements worldwide. That means extra engineering to make different versions of vehicles for different markets. 
"Each party negotiating this has their own views about their own standards being better," said Ronald Medford, senior associate administrator of vehicle safety at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which sets 

U.S. standards. "But as long as we can show we're not lowering safe­ty and we're lowering cost, we're all interested in that." 
Some differences are significant, like the U.S. rule that requires protection for passengers not wearing seat belts, which has no European equivalent. Others are small, like the U.S. requirement that vehicles have side lights, which are optional in Europe. 
Ford isn't the only automaker facing this issue. The ultra-com­pact Smart car was sold overseas for nine years, but before Daimler AG could bring it to the U.S., it had to make the car longer to meet 
U.S. crash standards, spokesman Ken Kettenbeil said. 
But Ford's promise to bring six small, fuel-efficient vehicles from Europe and start building them in North America in 2010 puts a new focus onthe challenge of sat­isfying governments' varying requirements. 
These global models are the cornerstone of Ford's plan to 
return to profitability after losing $8.7 billion last quarter. The Dearborn-based automaker says its small European vehicles sell well and are superior to those in the U.S. Ford also plans to save billions from designing products for global sales, boosting profits on small cars, which don't gener­ate the revenue of trucks and SUVs. 
Automakers know how to retro­fit their vehicles but question the time and expense involved when the changes may not make those vehicles safer, said Jim Vondale, director of Ford's safety office. 
"It may involve changes to the structure, it may involve changes to material, but they result in not so many diflferences in the safety levels of the vehicles," he said. 
Ford recently studied 43 regula­tions in Europe and the U.S. and found that just 11 were equiva­lent, Vondale said. Fourteen had major differences that would require significant changes. Asian countries' regulations, which are closer to European requirements than their LS. counterparts, add even more complexities.

Appelquist also said she liked the fact that some Notre Dame clubs, like the Tae Kwon Do club and the

"I appreciated the effort that Notre Dame's clubs put in to bring their clubs to our campus," she said.

"Since Notre Dame draws students from around the nation, it makes sense that most of our students use AT&T and Verizon, as they comprise over 85 percent of tiH1 market nationally," Latimer said. 
Despite these upgrades, cer­tain areas of the university remain with poor reception. Latimer said he is aware of the reception problems in newly created Duncan llall, noting that the West Quad area has historically had poor reception. "Both Verizon and AT&T are working on upgrad­ing coverage on West Quad and inside Duncan Hall in particular, but it's going to take some time," he said. 
Bncause of the improve­ments in coverage, students oftnn change their plans to AT&T or Vnrizon because they "go with what's best", Latirm1r said.

make it easier for students to find flights, she said. 
People tend to fly, rather than drive, home for Thanksgiving, said Kayleen Carr, leisure manager for Anthony Travel, since the break is only a few days long. 
The Thanksgiving recess has been changed four times in Notre Dame's history, Pace said. From 1898 through to the 1950s, classes were only can­celled on Thanksgiving Day itself. It is unclear from past academic calendars whether classes were dismissed for Thanksgiving prior to 1898, he said. 
The calendar was changed in 1959, with classes dismissed at 
12:30 p.m. on Wednesday, to resume the following Monday. In 1987. the holiday was declared to run from Wednesday through Sunday, but in 1990, the recess was director of Notre 
Dame Food Services, that showed approxi­mately 11,400 dining hall meals are served on a regular Wednesday, compared with 4, 700 meals on the Wednesday prior to Thanksgiving. Prentkowski's research showed the data was consistent over the previous three years. 
Students weren't just skip­ping classes, Pace said, but professors were also cancelling them the Wednesday before Thanksgiving so students could get home. 
"We could walk through DeBartolo Jlall and see very few classes," he said. "We had some evidence that classes were not meeting very regular­ly [that day)." 
The student body was noti­fied last semester of the Thanksgiving schedule change, and reminded again in an e­mail this week from Pace. 

Since the Perpetual Academic Calendar Buies of the University stipulate that each semester should include at least 70 class days, the Academic Council also decided to eliminate one reading, or study, day in December in order to meet the 70-day mini­mum rule. 
The spring semester will include the standard four read­ing days, Pace said, with class­es ending on a Wednesday and exams starting the following Monday. 
In the course of its delibera­tions, Pace said, the Academic Council was worried that stu­dents might take the entire Thanksgiving week off now that classes are only scheduled for Monday and Tw~sday. 
The University consulted with Saint Mary's, which pro­vides Wednesday as part of the Thanksgiving holiday, and asked the registrar to survey faculty about whether their classes had full attendance on the Monday and Tuesday before Thanksgiving. The majority of the responses reported no attendance prob­lems on these two days. 
Last January, Burish sent a letter to the faculty clarifying the University's absentee poli­cy. 
"Contrary to common student lore, there is no University pol­icy permitting students 'three free cuts, i.e. three unexcused absences from class without consequences," the letter said. "Deans, dP.partment chairs and directors should take the nec­essary steps to ensure tlw enforcement of University poli­eies and procedures." 
Pace said he hoped the clari­fication of this rule would ensure that students did not skip class on the Monday and Tuesday before Thanksgiving.

LIBYA -Two Sudanese men, armed with handguns and the threat of explosives, stormed the cockpit of the Boeing 737, tak­ing control just minutes into the flight. Passengers said the hijackers remained calm but they still spent a night in fear. 
Once on the ground at a remote Libyan air­field, the hijackers demanded maps and enough fuel to reach France. But after 22 hours. the standoff ended Wednesday with the 95 passengers and crew let go and the gunmen surrendering in a run-down VIP lounge with a plea for asylum. 
Thai prime minister's office overrun 
BANGKOK-Thai anti-government protesters occupying the grounds of the prime minister's office forced several hundred policemen off the compound early Friday and promised more action in their bid to oust the leader. 
Police exercised restraint when the demon­strators -some armed with golf clubs, batons and bamboo sticks -pushed up to 400 officers out of the Government House grounds at about 1 a.m. 
Protesters celebrated by dancing to rock music, a sharp contrast to the tensions Wednesday before when they feared a raid and threw up makeshift barricades. 
"We can relax now, but please be cautious, they might return soon," protest organizer Samran Hodpetch announced from a stage. 
Thousands of supporters of the conservative People's Alliance for Democracy spent a third night encamped at Government House in sup­port of their campaign to force Prime Minister Samak Sundaravej from office.

Hurricane to hit the Gulf Coast 
NEW ORLEANS -With Gustav approach­ing hurricane strength and showing no signs of veering off a track to slam into the Gulf Coast, authorities across the region began laying the groundwork Thursday to get the sick, elderly and poor away from the shore­line. 
The first batch of 700 buses that could ferry residents inland were being sent to a staging area near New Orleans, and officials in Mississippi were trying to decide when to move Katrina-battered residents along the coast who were still living in temporary homes, including trailers vulnerable to high wind.

Obama addresses conve:n.tion 
Democratic presedential candidate pledges to fix the broken politics in Washington 
Associated Press DENVER Barack Obama, launching his his­toric fall campaign for the White House with an out­door Democratic National Convention extravaganza, pledged Thursday to "fix the broken politics in Washington" after he defeats Republican John McCain in the fall. "We are better than these last eight years. We are a better country than this," Obama said in excerpts of his acceptance speech released in advance of his speech. Seeking to weld his Republican rival to the out­going Bush presidency, Obama declared that McCain as a senator had voted with Bush 90 percent of the time. "I don't know about you, but I'm not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change," he said. "We meet at one of those defining moments -a moment when our nation is at war, our economy is in turmoil and the American promise has been threat­ened once more," Obama said in the excerpts. He said it's time to change leadership in Washington after two terms of the Bush adminis­tration. "On Nov. 4," he said, "we must stand up in ten years. the legacy that generations delivering the most impor­and say: 'Eight is enough."

Show 
continued from page 1 
Frnshman Anne Whitty said she was aware of The Show's rt~putation as the biggest con­enrt of the year. 
McAllister and Whitty said all of their frinnds are planning on going to The Show. whieh is a big draw. 
"If tlu1y'rn going, I'm going," Whitty said. 
Tho Show 200H committee, which has been planning the concert for the past five months, believes the acts will appeal to tho student body as a whole, Barloh said. 
"Obviously, you can't please everyone," he said. "There will always be a vocal minority that abhors the headliner you choose ... Rut the positive reac­tions we've received heavily outweigh the negative reactions both in number and in enthusi­asm." 
On Thursday, the exact num­ber of tickets sold so far was not calculated; however, Rarloh expects a big turnout. 
The committee should predict a sell-out, he said, "otherwise they're not booking the right kinds of bands." 
Tickets cost $1 0, a figure that is possible thanks to donations, Barloh said. 
"The generous donations that Father Mark Poorman and the Office of Student Affairs make every year allow us to book top­tier talent and still oiTer tickets to tho student body at the most­affordable price possible," he said. 
Tho Show 200H is going green this year, putting a greater emphasis on electronic market­ing, reducing the amount of paper advertisements like posters and fliers, Barloh said. He does not expect this to nega­tively affect turnout. 

"We believe the enthusiasm for Good Charlotte and The Cool Kids will allow us to organize a very popular, very successful concert even without as many posters and fliers," he said. 
Other changes to make the concert more environmentally friendly include serving organic and locally grown food to the performers, production crew and The Show 2008's many vol­unteers. 
The T-shirts for The Show 2008 were made from organic eotton and printed with soy ink, and tickets and posters were printed on recycled paper. 
The most extravagant change made to the concert this year is the use of a state-of-the-art LED lighting system, which will con­sume 60 percent less energy than conventional lighting rigs, according to the press release. 
All of these changes equals a much more costly concert, Barloh said. 
"It was more expensive to produce a 'green' concert," he said. "However, it is important for The Show to become some­thing more than just a great concert. In the years ahead, it must serve to enrich Notre Dame's already-storied history of bettering our world." 
Doors open at the Joyce Center tonight at 7 p.m. 
Tickets will be available at the Box Office in LaFortune. A valid Notre Dame, Saint Mary's or Holy Cross ID is required for purchase. Tickets will also be available at the door.

IN BRIEF Contractor accused of human trafficking 
LOS ANGELES-The families of 12 Nepali men killed by Iraqi insurgents have filed a federal lawsuit accusing defense Gontractor KBR Inc. and a Jordanian subcontractor of human trafficking, saying the men were sent to work in Iraq against their will after being promised jobs in a posh hotel in Jordan. 
The lawsuit filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court alleges the workers were being taken to work at a U.S. air base in Iraq in 2004 when insurgents intercepted their caravan and killed them days later. A Nepali worker whose car survived the attack is also a plaintiff; Buddi Prasad Gurung, now back in Nepal, claims he was forced to work at AI Asad Air Base as a warehouse loader for 15 months. 
The 13 Nepali men were recruited by Daoud & Partners and other subcontractors with promises of work at an Amman hotel before their passports were taken and they were sent to Iraq, according to the lawsuit. 
Heather Browne, a spokeswoman for Houston-based KBR, declined to comment, saying the company has not yet seen the lawsuit. A contact number for Daoud & Partners could not immediately be located. 
Wheaties hires Olympic gold medalists

Wall Street jump reassures investors 
Dow Janes rises more than 200 points, gross domestic product reading be'ier than expected 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK-Wall Street barreled higher Thursday after a better-than-expected reading on the gross domes­tic product and a drop in jobless claims gave investors some reassurance that the economy is holding up. The Dow Jones industria·! aver­age jumped more than 200 points. 
A decline in oil prices also appeared to add force to the rally in stocks. But trading volume was again light heading toward the Labor Day weekend, a condition that can skew price moves. 
The Commerce Department's report that gross domestic product rose at an annual rate of 3.3 per­cent for the April-June peri­od followed several econom­ic readings this week that have left guarded investors somewhat optimistic. The weaker dollar helped boost 
U.S. exports, which pushed GDP growth beyond the gov­ernment's initial estimate of 
1.9 percent as well as econo­mists' forecast of 2. 7 per­cent. 
It marked the economy's best performance since the third quarter of last year, when GDP rose at a 4.8 per­cent pace.

My very first drink 
Our lives have a lot of firsts: The first time I ever rode a bicycle without train­ing wheels (my dad had my back and showed me the way), the first time I skied down a hill (my mom brought me up the chair 
lift), and the  Bob Kessler  
first time I ever  
drove a car (my dad was giving  /louse ofStix  
me instructions  

from the passenger seat). But the first 
time I ever drank alcohol was three 
years ago today in a room full of com­
plete strangers. 
The lirst time I ever drank alcohol was three years ago at my Disorientation, or Dis-0. Thrown into a room where I didn't know anybody, I chose to drink what I could because I wanted to lit in and because it seemed like it would be fun. Although I couldn't drink much at all, it was a Jot of fun and I have been actively partaking in the alcohol-fueled college culture ever since. 
Last month, a group of college and university presidents sought to curb this binge drinking culture across the coun­try by forming the Amethyst Initiative. The Initiative is a project of Choose Hesponsibility and has the stated goal of rethinking the legal drinking age. However, these presidents are not seek­ing a higher legal drinking age, but rather a lower one that would give stu­dents an actual choice when it comes to their legal drinking options. While some have called this crazy, I believe that it is the only correct way to build a more responsible society. 
Under our current laws, students are immediately granted full rights to alco­hol purchase, transport and consump­tion when the clock strikes midnight at their 21st birthday. In theory, these peo­ple have no prior experience with alco­hol and would have no way to actually know how to responsibly consume it. 
Combine this with the college setting at 
which many Americans turn 21, and 
you have a lethal disaster for binge 
drinking and irresponsibility. 
While my bicycle had training wheels, skiing had the bunny hill and driving had a learner's permit, the laws on drinking leave no room for education. These laws simply drop us right into the responsibility of alcohol without bother­ing to take the time to teach us how to actually drink responsibly. 
Furthermore, while parents and teachers are greatly involved with edu­cating us about how to safely drive a ear, the only drinking education we receive is informally given to us by friends and older siblings. 
In fact, the only formal education I ever received in school about alcohol was that it was bad. My high school preached alcohol abstinence much to the degree that the priests discuss sexu­al abstinence. I was never really taught about different types of alcohol and their practical effects on the body until! started drinking myself. And where did this leave me? 
It left me in that room at Dis-0 sur­rounded by complete strangers wonder­ing if a bottle of Malt Liquor was hard alcohol or not. It left my alcohol educa­tion not to parents and teachers, but to certain members of the Notre Dame Class of 2008 who took me and my peers under their wing and showed us the way. It left me to learn how to binge drink at parties and tailgates, but not how to drink at dinners and events. It was like attempting a double black dia­mond on your first time skiing. 
We need a system that allows us to progressively learn from our elders how to responsibly enjoy alcohol. Much like the year that we have a learner's per­mit, I believe that we need to have a year's worth of alcohol education. This would essentially involve granting young adults who are 18 the right to legally drink, but not the right to legally purchase aleohol and not the right to legally enter bars. During this time, 18­year-olds would be forced to drink with people who are older, and wiser, and would inevitably gain from it. 

Instead we have a system in place where young adults learn about alcohol not from their parents and relatives but from their friends and siblings. Earlier this week I had to spend several hours trying to convince an acquaintance not to drive home after drinking, even though "all of his friends from home do it." While I was lucky enough to learn from a smart group of guys whose poor decisions only went as far as they could walk, our laws can not assume that every young adult will be given this informal education. Our responsibility only goes so far as our education, and the current system is failing to educate young adults about how to drink prop­erly. 
Because of these problems, I not only strongly support a lower legal drinking age, but I urge Fr. Jenkins, our University officials, and all University officials across the country to show sup­port for this Initiative. If you don't · believe in its merits, just walk around campus this afternoon, drive down Washington Street this evening and wander through Turtle Creek late tonight. It will be in these places, as opposed to DeBartolo Hall, where the real education of our freshmen will begin, and the failure of our country's system will be all too evident.

Facebook's 100 million members shows it's out of control 
Facebook is out of control. 
This isn't a piece to ramble on and on about how it's taking over peo­ple's lives; it's to identify the dan­gers of the social networking site. 
YesterdayFacebook Staff Editorial announced a record member­

lion members. 
That's 99,999,999 other people who can find you on the Internet. 
That's almost 100 million people who can know your business: who you're dating, who your friends are and what you're interested in. 
Facebook and MySpace would be better off being called "StalkerBook" or "StalkerSpace." 
At least people will know what they are getting into. 
Day after day you hear horror sto­ries about cyber bullying and online predators. These social networking sites are no different than finding a naive somebody in a chat room. 
According to ABC News, 42 per­cent of children have experienced online bullying. 
The site has also decreased and nearly eliminated personal interac­tion among peers and generations. 
Instead of calling someone over the phone or visiting them in per­son, Facebook has become the quick-and-easy way to find out what's going on in friends' lives and what's going on over the weekend. 
Facebook allows its users to post pictures and their interests. 
It has been reported that some individuals looking for a job don't get hired because of incriminating· details on their Facebook or MySpace accounts. 
According to an MSNBC article, Van Allen runs a company that recruits candidates to fill positions in health clinics and hospitals all over the country. He was happy to find a qualified candidate, but the woman didn't receive the job when he found pictures of her taking her shirt off at parties on Facebook. 
While this is a smart move by employers to make sure they hire quality individuals, it's not a smart move by Facebook users to exploit themselves -and sometimes others -on these sites. 
With society becoming more and more technology-dependent and savvy, it's important for users of all ages to be cognizant of the reper­cussions of joining such a site. 
If joining the Facebook and/or MySpace community is a must, it's important to remember to responsi­bly use the accounts. 


Many are using the site today merely for networking. Others just want to keep in touch with old friends. 
It isn't a forum to see John Doe's crazy weekend, nor is it the place for account users to make their per­sonal vendettas known by "venting" it on their statuses. 
It is a site that shouldn't be abused and overused. 
It is important for individuals to know to be safe and only "friend" people they know. 
People need to remember the best type of communication is face to face -·not Facebook. 
They need to know not to embar­rass themselves. Sometimes there can be consequences to posting that picture from that crazy, drunken weekend two years ago.

Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystan Skull 
Photo courtesy goatsmilk.wordpress.com 
If not the perfection fans had hoped for, the fourth film in the Indiana Jones series, "Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull," is a rollicking ride. The plot 
. erosses the fine line the series has always walked between mythology and the super­natural a little too far in parts, but who can complain when the man in the hat is finally back? Suspend your disbelief and immerse yourself in the adventure. Harrison Ford reprises his iconic role with relative ease and recaptures Indiana while gracefully age­ing the character. The return of Marion Ravenwood (played by Karen Allen) is a treat, even if her eharacter has been softened from the barkeep that could drink anyone under the table. Shia LeBeouf and Cate Blanchette both take up the hard task of intro­ducing new characters with relative success. LeBeours character, Mutt Williams, plays up the new 1950s setting and is a fun sidekick and Blanchette captures the cold, Soviet Col. Dr. Irina Spalko well. But at its eore the movie was still about an archaeologist, his revolver, his whip and his mileage, and that's more than enough.

Newsweek called it the "funniest movie of the summer," The New Yorker wrote it off as "flailing and unfocused," and yet Roger Ebert gave it 3 and 1/2 stars. The truth of the matter is this: "Tropic Thunder" is dastardly obscene, politically incorreet and the funni­est movie you may see in years. It's a story following the filming of a blundering Vietnam War epic which falls behind schedule, vaults into insanity with a Reality TV twist and 
, lands well behind enemy lines. It's a story about men on their way out: a peaked action star (Bon Stiller) struggling for acknowledgement as a serious actor, a coked up fart-joke movie star (Jack Black) losing touch with reality, a five-time Oscar winning, self­indulged Australian aetor (Robert Downey Jr.) whose contrqversial "blackening" proce­dure leaves him with an identity crisis and a rap-icon (Brandon T. Jackson) on his way out of the closet. Tropic Thunder is a film egregiously loaded with insults and caustie wit surely to offend and provoke laughs at the same time. But the film's best treat, hidden bnhind Stiller. Black and Downey's leading roles, its most profane and entertaining per­formance, comes from an aetor whose name I won't reveal, because not knowing the actor's identity makes the discovery all the more amusing.

Shot on location in over 28 countries around the world, Tarsem Singh's "The Fall" is a spectacular epic that has not been seen in a long while. A story within a story, "The Fall" begins in a 1920's Los Angeles hospital. Severely injured stuntman Roy Walker (Lee Pace) tells a story to another young patient, Alexandria (Catinca Untaru), about five mythical heroes and their quest to rid the world of the evil Odious. But Walker's story begins to blend with reality as the characters learn more about themselves and each other and soon it is Alexandria who must save the story, and her new friend, from his own destructive tailspin. In her first film, Catinca Untaru is a captivating young actress that expresses the imagination, curiosity, and innocence of her character. Like his previous work, Singh's film is so aesthetically stunning that it could be watched for just that, but it is bolstered by a moving story and endearing characters.

What do you do when all your writers go on strike, the TV show you are develop­ing stops production, and your creative mind is still boiling as it always does? You make a straight-to-internet series of musical video shorts, of course! At least, that is what Joss Whedon does. The man behind "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" and "Firefly" roped together a filming crew and a few actor buddies to create "Dr. Horrible's Sing Along Blog,'' a tale of one misfit criminal mastermind, Dr. Horrible (Neil Patrick Harris), as he attempts to join the Evil League of Evil. His master plans are overrun by Captain Hammer (Nathan Fillion, reprieving his role as a cap­tain, though this time without the spaceship and duster). The quest gets compli­cated when the girl of his dreams, Penny from the laundramat, starts going out with Captain Hammer. Melodies reminiscent of the musical Buffy episode abound, as does classic Whedonesque humor. Though he plays straight into his niche audi­ence, the Joss Boss manages to create a 45-minute story that is sweet and laugh­out-loud funny. It can be seen on Hulu and downloaded on iTunes .

Seat stays hot for Bowden 
Associated Press 
CLEMSON, S.C. -Clnmson 
star tailback C . .J. Spiller 
laughs at the question: llow 
ol'tnn did people tell you not 
to join th<~ Tigers becaus<~ 
roach Tommy Bowden would 
gnt fin~d'! 
"Oh ynah, I !ward that a 
lot," said Spiller, a junior. 
Well, only days away from Bowdpn's 1Oth spason, thn coach sonw Clemson fans lovn to grousn at, isn't going any­wlwrn. lie's walked the sidn­linns at Dnath Vallny longer than anyone but modern pro­gram patriarch Frank lloward and national champi­onship icon Danny Ford. lin's got a dna! that ties him to thn school through 2014, the bar.king of his bosses and some of thn slickest talent in college football. 
Thn one thing Bowden does­n't own is a championship. and that. perhaps. is what has kPpt his coaching seat hot no matter how many blue­chippnrs lw attracts. 
"This is a tough prol'nssion to stay for I 0 yPars," Bowden says. 
lie would certainly know. lie watclwd his father, Florida State coach Bobby, hung in effigy by i m pa tiP n t WPst Virginia fans in the I 970s. lie saw his brothPr Terry get chewed up by some Auburn supportnrs two decades later. lie's seen another brother, Jeff, leave as the Seminoles offensivP coordinator when wins didn't come as quickly as people wanted. 
"Underline and put in the parenthAses, a lot," when it comes to quick-trigger coach­ing casualties these days, Tommy Bowden says. 
And this might be his most pressure-packed season of them all. 
The Tigers are preseason favorites to win the Atlantic Coast Conference champi­onship. Quarterback Cullen Harper, and runners James Davis and Spiller finished 1­2-3 for the league's preseason player of the year. They stand ninth in the national rank­ings, their highest starting spot since 1991, also the year of the school's last ACC crown. 
The Tigers open Saturday night against No. 24 Alabama in the (;eorgia Dome. While Clemson might get thn ana­lysts' ndgn on several posi­tions, almost evnry break­down would give the eoaehing elHH:k mark to the Crimson Tide's Nick Saban. 
"Thn objeetive in this pro­fession is to win, win champi­onships and win national championships and I've done nnitlwr," Tommy Bowden said. "You'II face thn q unstion or, 'lin's a nice guy who eornns in second.' You'll always face that until you dJange tlw faets." 
Saban. who won a national crown at l.SU. admires Bowden and donsn't put much stock in past sueenssos or fail­ures. 
"This game is what it is right now, and tht~y'vn donn a rt~ally good job in recruiting," Saban said. "I know they haven't won a title ynt hut they've knocked on tlw door a eoupk of tinws." 
HSPN analyst Len Corso 

likes how Bowden's built his 
team, and the athletic depart­
ment's support. 
"The guys a competitor. lie did an outstanding job at Tulane and now he's done a nice job at Clemson," Corso said. "If (Bowden's) senior leadership plays up to their potontial, he could win it all over in the ACC." 
Clemson fans have waited on that since Bowden came to Clemson in 1998 after leading Tulane to an undefeated sea­son. 
The Tigers were 8-0 and No. 5 in the country in 2000. However, they lost three of their final four games and started a stretch of mediocrity (20-18) that lasted until the middle of the 2003 season. 
Bowden seemed as good as gone that year when Clemson fell 45-17 at Wake Forest, the former ACC doormat Tiger fans had reveled in pounding each season. 
But Bowden's patience bore fruit. A week later, he topped No. 3 Florida State for his first Bowden Bowl victory over father Bobby, who said pointedly in postgame com­ments if Clemson didn't want his son as coach, there'd be plenty of schools who would. 
Clemson finished with four straight wins and Tommy gained a long-term contract. 
Bowden's position looked shaky two years ago after the Tigers started 7-1, reaching No. 10 in the country, and then lost four of their final five to miss out on the ACC title game. 
ThPre was another second­place finish last fall, again reviving talk if Bowden was the right coach to take the Tigers to the top. 
Clemson leaders thought he was, awarding Bowden a new contract that locks him in through 2014. It would cost Clemson $4 million should it wish to part ways after this year. 

Still, talking with reporters earlier this month, Clemson athletic director Terry Don Phillips was asked what the school would do if Bowden didn't win. 
"Tommy Bowden is our football coach," Phillips answered, "and we're going to go on down the highway." 
ESPN analyst Todd Blackledge says Clemson's leaders share Bowden's vision and that's kept them from knee-jerk changes. 
"It's not something you see all the time these days in col­lege football," he said. "The pressure to win makes that difficult." 
Bowden's just as frustrated as Tiger fans are with Clemson's stumbles and close calls. He compared his goals to any profession that gives out a top award. 
"You'd all like to have that award, and if you said you didn't, you'd probably be lying," Bowden says. "Well, I wouldn't be any different. In this profession, you eventual­ly want to be the champion, you're disappointed when you're not and you keep working hard until you get it."

NCAA FOOTBALL 

Meyer changes tune, praises running backs 
Associated Press 

GAINESVILLE, Fla. -Coach 
Urban Meyer called his run­
ning backs pathetic, trash and 
inadequate during his first 
three seasons at Florida. 

He threatened to play with­
out a tailback two years ago 
and turned most ol' the running 
game over to quarterback Tim 
Tebow and receiver Percy 
Ilarvin last season. 

I le expects things to be very 
different this fall. 

Meyer has praised the backs at every turn during two-a­days, calling Kestahn Moorn, Emmanuel Moody, Chris Hainey and Jell' Demps the best group he's had on campus in four years. He'll finally get to see them in action when the fifth-ranked Gat01·s open the season against Ilawaii on Saturday. 
"We have some dynamic backs," Meyer said. "''m kind of like a fan in that I can't wait to see these guys play." 
The backs might be relied on like never bel'ore, too, bocause Meyer is hoping to limit 
.Tebow's carries this season 
and Harvin is still reeovering 
from a nagging heel injury. 

"I hope we have enough balls to go around," running backs coaeh Kenny Carter said. "You can put any combination of guy out there and a lot of special things can happen. You give them the ball and they can go to the house from any place on the field. That's a great thing to have." 
It starts with Moore, the lone senior in the group. His first three years were plagued by inconsistency and fumble prob­lems, but he was the best of the bunch in spring drills and summer workouts. Meyer already has named him the starter and plans to use him at fullback some just to keep him on the field as much as possi­ble. 
Moore welcomed the added load, especially after watching Tebow and Harvin get the ball so often in the most critical sit­uations the last two years. 
"It hurts you," Moore said. "You being a running back and you have other people coming in and taking thn earrins. It helped the tnam, so I can't complain too much." 
Many thought Moody, a for­mer Parade Ali-Amerkan who transferred from Southern California, would step in and take over the starting role. 
But he took longer than expected to learn thn off'ens1~. And even when lw showed progress, hn followed with a step in the wrong direction. lie ran for 111 yards and a touch­down in the spring game, but also fumblnd at the 1-yard line and drew strong criticism !'rom Meyer. 
"Coach Meyer, he's always getting in your grill to get things right," Moody said. "He's a perl'ectionist. It really made me jump on the horse, study the playbook more and think about football even more than I was." 
The extra time Moody spent getting the offense down paid off this fall. lin looks more comfortable with the ball and has moved up the depth chart. 
"It took a while," Moody said. ''I'm starting to play like how I play and not really thinking about what the sehemes are and what steps I have to take. It comes natural to me know." 
Moody left USC in hopes of becoming a featured back. But that's not likely to happen, especially with Hainey and Demps in the mix. 
Hainey has been compared to Harvin since he stepped foot on campus last year, but the 5­foot-9, 185-pound speedster hasn't had quite the same suc­cess. Harvin helped the Gators win a national championship as a freshman in 2006, but Hainey committed three errors in two games last season, then injured his shoulder and missed the rest of the season. 
He rebounded this spring and was the star of the team's annual Orange & Blue game. He ran for 75 yards and a touchdown and had a 65-yard scoring reception.

Saints remember Katrina as Gustav approatches 
Third anniversary of devastating hurricane evokes emotions as New Orleans players hope to avoid a repeat 
Associated Press 
NEW ORLEANS-If the third anniversary of Hurricane Katrina wasn't enough to remind Saints offensive lineman Jammal Brown what he went through when New Orleans flooded, the latest storm to threaten the Gulf Coast certain­ly did. 
A'l much as any Saints player, Brown could relate to the anxi­ety Tropical Storm Gustav was causing in south Louisiana. A first-round draft choice in 2005, Brown bought his first house in an upscale golf course develop­ment in eastern New Orleans only months before Katrina hit. 
"Last time, (team officials) called me up and said, 'We're going out to Oakland for a week. Pack up a week's worth of clothes,"' Brown recalled. "So I pack up some clothes and get out to Oakland and look on TV and every thing I own is under water." 
Katrina stuck Aug. 29, 2005, smashing levees and flooding 80 percent of New Orleans. 
Third-year coach Sean Payton said his team, has a plan for moving to a safe location should Gustav strike the New Orleans area. The Saints were to play the Miami Dolphins in their final preseason game Thursday night at the Louisiana Superdome. 
Payton said the plan encom­passed the process of moving the team, but not where to go, because that wouldn't be decid­ed until the storm's track had narrowed enough· to know whether it was best to go east, west or north. 
"We've all had time to put together a clear plan as to how it affects the organization, the team, the families of the team," Payton said. "I don't want to go into detail as to what we do, somewhere else. It won't be a because what we do is really distraction; we won't allow it to predicated on be." when it's sup-The Saints have posed to played two full

"We will be focused and ready to play in a place that really to play the Buccaneers," Payton needed them, both in terms of said. "We're planning on that the morale boost they provided game being at the Superdome, and the community service but the powers that be will have projects they undertook. a clear plan in place if that Cornerback Jason Craft, should change any or if our who's been with the Saints since preparation should have to be 2004, said a lot of players ini­tially did not wa.nt to return to New Orleans after their dis­placement to San Antonio because they didn't really understand what life in post­Katrina New Orlleans would be like. As they began to appreci­ate the extent to which they could inspire hope, they embraced the move and were rewarded with a once-in-a­career experience during a 2006 home-opening victory over Atlanta in an emotional Monday night game. 


"That first game, that right there, I'll never forget that," Craft said. "Even though we didn't make it to the Super Bowl that year, that was my Supe1· Bowl. I never seen anything like that and I was just happy to see people out in the streets, just ha.ppy to see the Saints play that day. Tha.t's probably one thing I'll always remember about New Orleans iH tha.t day." 
Drew Brees was the first major free agent to come to New Orleans after the storm and bought an old home in a historic neighborhood only six blocks from areas that flooded during Katrina. 
Brees, whose foundation has raised nearly $2 million for proj­ects aimed at helping children around the dty by rebuilding schools, playgrounds, athletic fields and the like.. said witnessing the city's reco-very has been both inspiring and disappointing, often depending on the neighborhood in question. 
"There are :>ome areas where it looks like it happened yesterday," Brees said. "Those are houses peo­ple used to live in and they're not (living there) any more, so where are they?" 
Brown's first house is one of the empty ones. He's rebuilt it, but is trying to sell it and has moved to a largely undamaged suburb west of the city. 
At the same time, Brees has been pleased to Sf'e new construc­tion, or flooded buildings being restored, throughout town. He's also met young business owners who saw the rebuilding city as "a land of opportunity." Brees can relate, having come to New Orleans after his s1:int in San Diego ended with a career-threatening shoulder injury. 
"I felt like we were all kind of in this thing together," Brees said. ''I'm trying to rebuild my career coming off the injury and changing teams, kind of a fresh start for me, a fresh start lor the organization and a fresh start for the city." 
Their home stadium was a prime examph During Katrina, it became a symbol of suffering while being used as a refuge of last resort. After being rebuilt with new and better amenities, it became a symbol of rebirth, and the Saints' first season there was a memorable one, as they went to the NFC championship game for the first time. 
In 2007, the NBA's Hornets returned full time to the arena next door and are 1hriving as well. 
"The more you talk to people and the more you drive around, I think you just J'eel like life is back," Brees said. "\'Vhen the storm hap­pened, your mind-set had to be: we're going to make things better than they were before. We're going to try to turn this into a positive somehow, some way. I see that happening in a lot of areas.... So just to kind of be there and just feel like yoJ're kind of a part of the rebuilding process is rewarding."

PGA 
Lefty fails to capitalize on Tiger's knee injury 

Associated p...,ss 
NOHTON, Mass. Phil Mickelson's star presence at the DeutschH Bank Championship was evident Thursday by the company hn kept at the TPC Boston. 
lie played the pro-am with tournament host Seth Waugh, the CEO of Deutsche Bank Americas; New York mayor Michael Bloomberg and New England Patriots owner Bob Kraft. Such is the VIP treatment typically afforded the highest­ranked player in the field. 
FP.dl\x Cup playoff standings aside, that honor still falls to Mickelson. 
lin is No. 2 in the world rank­ing, although it's easy to forget that. Because while Tiger Woods has been out of sight for two months after his season-ending knee surgery, Mickelson at times has been MIA. 
Some thought hP. would take advantage of Woods' absence by piling up victories, perhaps another major or two, and giv­ing himself a ehanep, to win the mmwy title or PCA Tour playp,r of the year for the first timp, in his earner. 
But it hasn't worked out that way. 
Miekelson has played four times with only one serious r:hanee at winning, whnn he had a one-shot lead until bogeys on three of the last four holes at Firestone to tie for fourth. lie had to rally to make the week­end at the British Open. was· stnady but not spectacular in his tie for seventh at the PGA Championship and opened the PCA Tour Playofl's for the FedEx Cup last week with a tie for 19th.

happier with the result this time around. 
"We've started off very well, I'm very pleased," Waldrum said. "That was much better than the 0-0 tie." 
In last season's tournament, the Irish lost in overtime to Oklahoma State to surrender the tournament title to Washington State. In another reminder of last season's rocky early performance, Notre Dame will face a Santa Clara team that beat the visiting Irish 7-1 a week before the 2007 Inn at Saint Mary's Classic. But Waldrum said this weekend the Irish will look to erase the memory of that blowout. 
"Every time we play [Santa Clara! it's a battle with both teams leaving everything on the lield," Waldrum said. "I don't think we're going to have to say too much about last year to get our team motivated." 
But before the Irish fully set their sights on the Broncos, they must contend with an unfamiliar and highly experi­enced Loyola Marymount team, who Notre Dame will face for the first time. 
"It should be a tough game because they return nine of 11 starters from last year," Waldrum said. "I don't think we can intimidate them much just because it's our home field." 
"I've played the same way I've played throughout the year," Mickelson said. "I just haven't been scoring the way I would like. Even though I feel like I'm playing better, the little shots around the greens have cost me. But I'm starting to get that turned around, and I expect to have a much better week." 
By most standards, Mickelson has had a good year. IIe won at Riviera and Colonial, and he is third on the money list, a little more than $1 million behind Woods. With three more $7 mil­lion events, a money title is not out of reach. 
This would be a good place to turn it around, even if the cast of characters has changed. 
A year ago, Mickelson surged into FodEx Cup contention with Pflrhaps the most exciting play­ofT event at the Deutsche Bank Championship. lie played the first two rounds with Woods and Vijay Singh, then hooked up with Woods in the final round and closed with a 66 and beat Woods and two others by two shots. 
Asked how he remembered last yerrr, Mickelson broke up the room by saying only, "Very fondly." 
"It was a fun tournament last year, and I loved the opportunity to have won the tournament," he said. "But I also love the way it happened, with the opportuni­ty to play three rounds with Tiger." 
Woods hasn't played since winning the U.S. Open in a play­oil', and the tour has had a taste of life without the world's most famous athletes. Attendance has benn noticeably down in recent events, and television ratings have plunged, as to be expected. 
West Virginia is the fourth team in the tournament field and although Notre Dame will not face the Mountaineers, Waldrum said they will help make this year's event more competitive than last year's. 
"Obviously it's great to have a Big East rival like West Virginia here for this," Waldrum said. "With all these great teams, it's really going to be a big event." 
Several Notre Dame players received individual honors this week as Carrie Dew was named the Big East defensive player of the week and senior forward Kerri Hanks earned a spot on the conference's weekly honor roll. In addition, Hanks and senior co-captain Brittany Bock were among the 22 players named preseason All­Americans by Soccer America. 
But Waldrum sounded more concerned about getting a good all-around performance out of his team to kick-start the sea­son than about individual acco­lades. 
"It's going to be a great week­end, especially for all the fans," Waldrum said. "We're just going to try to go out there and do everything we can to win it." 
The tournament kicks off tonight at 5 p.m. when West Virginia faces off against Santa Clara. Notre Dame begins play against Loyola Marymount after the conclusion of that con­test.

Ladies tour no habla espa:fiol 
Golfweek reports players must speak English or face suspension 
Associated P...,ss 
NORTON, Mass. -Imagine what could have happened to Angel Cabrera if he belonged to a tour that required its players to speak English. 
A powerful Argentine who rose from an impoverished childhood, he won the U.S. Open last year at Oakmont by holding off Tiger Woods and Jim Furyk. In the hours after the trophy presentation, Cabrera made his way through a maze of media interviews in Spanish with an interpreter at his side. 
Under a new LPGA Tour poli­cy effective next year, Cabrera might have been suspended. Or, he might not have played at all if an official on that tour deemed he was ineffective in English. 
"You don't have to speak English to play golf." Cabrera said Thursday in Spanish, join­ing a chorus of male players perplexed by the LPGA Tour's decision to be punish women golfers for not speaking English in pro-ams, trophy presenta­tions and media interviews. 
K.J. Choi of South Korea recalled his rookie season on the PGA Tour in 2000, when his English was so limited that he often got lost going to the golf course because he couldn't read street signs. lie wasn't comfortable enough to speak English for five years, despite constant study. 
Asked about the LPGA Tour's policy, he shook his head. "It is a difficult situation," Choi said in English. "It is good 

for them to help players learn English. When I learned English, I became a better play­er. But to suspend them? I don't think so." 
And if the PGA Tour had a policy like that in 2000? "I would have had to go home," Choi said. 
Golfweek magazine first reported the LPGA Tour's new English-only policy Monday, leaving the tour scrambling to explain and defend itself over the past several days as the issue has stayed on the fore­front of public discussion. 
The LPGA Tour didn't get this much attention when Annika Sorenstam said she was retir­ing. 
"We have been puzzled, if not surprised, by some of the reac­tions," said deputy commission­er Libba Galloway, who previ­ously was the LPGA's top attor­ney. "We see this as a pro-inter­national move." 
Galloway said title sponsors o!Ter individual endorsement deals to players -Sorenstam has a longtime deal with Kraft -and players who can't inter­act in pro-ams or with sponsors because of limited English are hurting themselves financially. 
The LPGA Tour is still work­ing on the policy, which will bn delivered to players at the end of the year. She said its profes­sional development group is eonsulting with outside experts, and the LPGA will administer the evaluation itself. 
Players won't have to be flu­ent, rather what Galloway described as "effective."

tively with your pro-am part­ners. You need to be able to do media interviews. And you need to give a winner's accept­ance speech in English," she said. "They must speak at a level that effectively accom­plishes those three things." 
Strangely absent during this debate is LPGA Tour commis­sioner Carolyn Bivens. According to Golfweek, Bivens held a meeting with only the South Koreans last week in Portland, which led some to believe they were being singled out. 
Galloway said Bivens was returning from the West Coast on Monday and Tuesday, and "I drew the long straw" to handle media inquiries. 
The LPGA Tour for the last three years has offnred lan­guage training through a Hosetta Stone online program and has ofl'ered a cross-cultural program for its international players. 
But there has never bnen a mandatn until now. 
"It's not a sign that it's not working," Galloway said. "What we're seeing is that a handful of players don't speak to the level they need to be." 
But if only a few players struggle with English, why develop a policy equipped with a penalty? 
"We're not just looking at the LPGA as it is now," Galloway said. "We're looking at the future of the LPGA. A<> you wHII know, we have a large interna­tional membership. All indiea­tions are it's not going to get smaller."

championships won. 
Critics of the Notre Dame athlntic department say the University president and the Board of Trustees have the real power over the depart­ment. Swarbrick said he dis­cussed the issue with University president Fr. John .Jenkins and Dick Notebaert, the Chairman of the Board of Trustees, and feels he has all the power he needs to do his job. 
"I wouldn't be here if I was concerned," he said. 
No athletic director in the nation, he said. makes a major decision without consulting the university president. What he said he wanted -and felt he got -was the authority to lead the investigation and make a recommendation on the decision. 
"I would not have hired him if I did not have confidence in him to do the work of the ath­letic department," Jenkins said during Swarbrick's introducto­ry press conference on July 16. 
While a partner at Baker & Daniels law firm in Indianapolis after graduating from Stanford law school, Swarbrick, who also served as the chairman of the Indiana Sports Corporation from 1992 to 2001, helped bring the NCAA offices and the 2012 Super Bowl to the city. The skills he used in those proj­ects, he said. will help him handle his job as Notre Dame's representative to the Bowl Championship Series (BCS) with whom Notre Dame has an individual contract. 
"That's very consistent with my background, that's a lot of th.e work that I've done," he said. ''I've gotten to know a lot of those pnople, spent time with tlwm over the years, and I consider many of them friends. I'm eager to listen, to learn. and to take part in the discussion." 
The University has a new softball stadium, a new soccer l'ield, and renovations to the .JACC, but Swarbrick said there are still facilities that need to be updated. 
"Clearly we want to address hockey quickly," he said. The Irish hockey team lost to Boston Col11~ge in the national championship game last sea­son. 
The department would addmss other needs, he said, 

-
on a sport-by-sport basis. A non-faeility aspect of the department he would like to work on, he said, was to get his senior staffers in position to lead the changes in the world of college sports. He cited women's basketball coach Muffet McGraw as a coach who thought about the future of the game. 
One change he said he does­n't think will happen soon, however, is the addition of a college football playoff. There are too few university presi­dents interested in changing the system, he said, so the dia­logue should focus on some­thing else. 
Another status quo he would like Notre Dame to uphold is the avoidance of one-and-done basketball players, students who play their freshman year before leaving for the NBA. 
"Generally speaking, I don't think programs benefit from having people who come here with an interest in leaving," he said. "Your basketball pro­gram has a real culture, and you have that culture because seniors teach freshmen, and the next class teaches the next class, and you start to have a really important culture." 
Swarbrick said, however, that there are athletes for whom it makes sense, and· also that no one makes a fuss when a great young tennis player ­or Michael Phelps -turns pro. 
Although the football team commands most of his atten­tion, the 25 other varsity sports will not fall by the way­side, he said. Athlete-coach relationships are strong, he said, and a football player's experience is as important to him as an athlete's in any other sport. 
"I believe that the course of study that is varsity athletics is one of the most effective edu­cational models in American academia," he said. "It's an intensive four-year program." 
That being said, the football team plays a special role at the University, and Swarbrick said he will naturally have to devote more time to it. 
"It's essential to who we are, both from the external percep­tion and to the way we cele­brate it," he said. "I under­stand that, the other coaches understand that, and we're going to do everything we can to make sure the football pro­gram meets the expectations of everyone engaged in it."

NO ATHLETICS COMMENTARY 

From one AD to another 
Being a sports editor at a major college publication such as The Observer is a highly respected post. That is why I was far 
from shocked when I was approached this sum­mer to take over for Kevin White as Notre 

Dame's Dan Murphy Director of 
Sports Editor 
Athletics. 
Fr. Jenkins and the board made a gener­ous offer and I buckled right down to work. Unfortunately, it was quickly revealed that I studied at the George O'Leary School for Resume Writing and my work as the Appalachian State schedule guru was brought under heavy scrutiny. Jenkins also questioned my role in bring­ing Kevin Garnett to Boston last year, which admittedly might have been a stretch. 
Needless to say, I gracefully stepped down and the athletic department moved on to another smart choice in 1976 graduate Jack Swarbrick. Swarbrick declined my help, but in case he is reading here are a few things that I had pegged as things to do while I was at the top. 
Priority No. 1 is turning the hockey program into a major revenue sport. The team has been a force to be reckoned with in college hockey since the arrival of head coach Jeff Jackson three years ago. A new arena is already in the works, but there is plenty more to be done to insure that Jackson has all the tools he deserves. The Irish are already pulling in some of the top recruits in the country, but if they are going to contin­ue to bring in young talent they will need to be able to back up the promise of better facilities to come. ­

Establishing the Irish as a household name on the ice would open the doors to upgrade the women's club team to a varsity program. The new arena would have more than enough room to accommodate a women's team, and the excitement sur­rounding it's opening would keep the turnstiles spinning for both teams. 
A women's hockey team would also allow the universi­ty to resurrect the varsity wrestling program. Notre Dame did away with wrestling in 1992 because of Title IX legislation. 
But of course, the legacy of any Notre Dame AD is not going to be determined by women's ice hockey or wrestling. 
An athletic director can't play quarterback, and all the support in the world can't buy you a few extra wins in a sea­son. However, I did find a way to cement my name in Irish football history -before they ripped it out of my hands, of course. 
Because of our independent status, Notre Dame is in a very unique position in college football. The Irish Athletic Director is the only AD in the country that is guaranteed a spot on the BCS Committee. That seat means that Notre Dame has a small voice in the ridiculous process of the col­lege bowl system. That voice provides a way to campaign for a playoff system, or at the very least an improvement over the current BCS format. 
Swarbrick said he was look­ing forward to being on the committee but too few univer­sity presidents were interest­ed in a playoff system to put it on his immediate agenda. It is a long, hard road ahead but this one-time AD feels that it can't hurt to try. 
I must say that I am a little disappointed in the University's decision to allow me to step down, but I have decided to be the bigger man. It seems Mr. Swarbrick is pretty well qualified, so the best of luck to you Jack. If you ever need a second opinion, you know where to lind me.

MEN'S SOCCER 
A new season unzipped 

Notre Dame opens regular season on the road against Akron after a 1-0-1 preseason record 
By MATT GAMBER Associate Sports Editor 
After posting a 1-0-1 record in exhibition play, No. 3 Notre Dame opens its season tonight in Bloomington, Ind., with a 5 
p.m. match against No. 12 Akron. 
The Irish will take on Duke at 2 p.m. tomorrow as part of the 26th annual Adidas/IU Credit Union Classic, a four-team event on the campus of Indiana University. 
"It's certainly going to be two good games, without question," Irish coach Bobby Clark said. "We play a very good schedule without many gimmes, and I think the team's exeitnd for this weekend." 
The Irish boast a strong cast of returners, including seven starters from a team that fell to eventual national champion Wake Forest 1-0 in the NCAA quarterfinals. 
Senior defender Matt Besler, a two-time captain and preseason All-American this season, is one of three all-Big East honorees back for the Irish. He is joined on the back line by fellow senior and all-Big East player Jack Traynor. 
Sophomore midfielder Matt Armstrong, an all-Big East hon­orable mention a year ago, also returns. 
After combining to play in just two games a year ago, senior Bright Dike and junior Tamba Samba return to bolster an attacking unit that also includes sophomores Jeb Brovsky and Steven Perry. The major ques­tion, however, is whether the Irish can replace the production of Joseph Lapira, a two-time All-American and the 2006

After rough season, a fresh start for the Irish 
By SAM WERNER Sports Wri rer 

Irish coach Debbie Brown has never faced IPFW while at Notre Dame, but she isn't fazed. In fact, she said, it could spice things up a bit because she'll make changes mid-match. 
"Sometimes that's actually pretty fun to do that," she said. "But you're also used to having a little bit more knowledge than we do." 
The game against IPFW is the first of the Shamrock Invitational; Notre Dame will also facH Nevada and Valparaiso this weekend in the tournament. 
Notre Dame will look to get off to a fast start to help them rebound from a disappointing 2007 season. 
"I don't feel like if we don't if we don't get off to a good start it'll be a disastrous season," Irish coach Debbie Brown said. "But obviously you always want to start off strong, and I think we have the opportunity to do that." 
Brown also said this year's squad will use last year's frus­tration as motivation to improve in 2008. 
"I think there's just a real strong determination to make it better for sure and there's no doubt in my mind that we will," she said. "We have reasons to be really optimistic about [this year]."
