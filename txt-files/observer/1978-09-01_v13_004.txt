Four dorms renovated 
by Janice McCormack 

Renovations were made this past summer in four dorms to provide a partial solution for social space problems on campus. Lounges and kitchens were constructed in Howard and Fisher Halls, while new rooms were built in study lounges in both Holy Cross and Carroll Halls. 
The dorm with tbe least social space available for students was Howard. A conference room, study lounge, and a first-floor lounge· with a kitchen were constructed to solve this problem. Rooms with a total of eight beds were removed to provide area for these changes. 
Construction in fisher is at present incomplete. Fr. Frederick Brenner, rector of Fisher, explain­ed th11.t work was started during the summer, but was suddenly halted and has not resumed. A new TV lounge and kitchen, as well as carpeting in the hall':; game room, are planned for Fisher. 
The .>tructural shell and wiring are the only progress which has been made in Fisher's kitchen and student' cannot use either the kitchen "r the lounge. Brenner said, "I hope the work is completed verv soon.. -we didn't ask for a lot."

Dean return.s to prison 
BALTIMORE [AP I -John W. Dean Ill, the former White House consel, has returned to an old federal prison here where he served four months of a sentence for involvement in the Watergate scandal -but only to look around. Dean spent several hours Wednesday wandering through the deserted halls of Fort Holabird, which served as a minimum-c;ecurity prison. He was accompanying technicians and product•rs from Time-Life Films, which is planning a television series based on the Watergate memoirs of Dean and his wife, Maureen.

Harris' plea guilty 

[continued from page \] 
Weinglass spelled out later the specifics of the sentencing agree­ment. The kidnapping charge alone carries a potential sentence of 1-25 years in prison. The robbery charge could have brought them life sentences. 
However, the prosecution agreed to a total 10-year 8-month sentence which, with time off for good behaviour, will be reduced to five years and one month. 
That sentence will run concur­rently with the Los Angeles sen­tence, which expires in April1980. The Hearst sentence thus will add a total of 3 l/2 more years to their prison time. 
German Club picnic 

The German Club of Notre Dame will sponsor a picnic at St. Mary's Lake on Saturday, September 2, from 11 a.m. until I p.m. The lake is located next to Holy Cross Hall. The Club is looking for new members, and anyone interested in participating in the cultural and social activities sponsored by the club throughout the year is encour­aged to attend this first gathering. 
Lunch will be provided free to registered members. Registration dues for membership are a dollar and a half.

After talks were called off Rupert Murdoch, publisher of the New York Post and spokesmen for the publishers of The New York Times and the Daily News, said the pressmen had rejected "the most generous offer made by publishers to the pressmen's union in this

The union fought to prevent the loss of many jobs.

Buildings blaze as firemen strike 
ANDERSON Ind. [AP] -Striking Anderson firemen who refused to help fight a downtown blaze say it was a choice between dedication to duty and feeding their families. 
"It just killed me. It tore me up to just sit there and watch that big fire," said Pvt. Steve Shipley, a six-year veterna of the Anderson Fire Department. 
"But I've got a family and four mouths to feed and it's about time we earned some money for it." 
Five buildings in a block-long section of downtown were des­troyed and another was heavily damaged in the Wednesday night blaze. Only six of the city-s 144 firefighters, who have been on strike since' Saturday night, res­ponded, and they withdrew when volunteer units arrived.

SMCEditor 

Saint Mary's has combined its Career Development and counsel­ing centers and two new staff members have been appointed to direct the combined department. . 
Patricia McGinn, a 1960 graduate of Saint Mary's, is the new director of the combined center. At present, she is wo~:king part-time at the college. She will begin full-time Oct. 1. 
A former Holy Cross nun, she has been involved in a family counsel­

The other assistant director is Betsy Twitchell, former acting : director of the Career Development + Center. She was also McCandless + Hall director last year. + 
The rationale behind the reorgani-+
zation of departments, according to + 
McGinn, was that "the questions +
of 'who am I?' and 'what am I.+ 
going to be?' are not separate. They are intimately connected." 
"This college is a community of people who are learning and grow­ing. There are certain areas of that 
growth--intellectual and cultural-­which are automatically taken care of. Our department is concerned with ostering personal, psychologi­
cal and vocational growth. We are involved il'l makig life plans, choices, decisions and the personal dynamics involved," McGinn said. "A counseling department should

Jazz try-outs · to be held 
The Notre Dame Jazz Bands will hold their annual auditions on Sunday, September 3rd at 1 :00 PM in the Jazz Band Loft located in the Band Annex Building by the Huddle. 
Undergraduate and graduate students interested in playing jazz in either the big band or small group format should bring their instruments to the Jazz Band Loft at 1:00PM. 
There are openings in the Jazz Bands for trumpets, trombones, saxophones, pianos, basses, drums and guitars. No prepared music is required for the auditions. Ampli­fiers will be provided. 
If there is a problem with the audition date or for further infor­mation, contact Fr. Wiskirchen at 7136. 
At least one out-of-town company was delayed about 15 minutes while striking firemen received approval from union leaders to let volunteers pass through picket lines at the edge of the city. 
Shipley said, however, that any delay was the decision of volun­teers, and not the strikers. 
"The volunteer departments did not go in to fight the fire until we let them. We didn't hold them back," he said. 
"We are upset," said Carl Grenly as he manned a picket line just a few blocks from the fire. "I hope it proves they still need us." 
Sgt. Charles McKissick, a 15-year veteran of the department, said the blame for the destruction of the buildings rests with the city ad-
people through the critical stages
in their lives, but we do more than that," she continued. · 
McGinn stressed that the combin­ing of departments will add ser­vices rather than subtract them. 
Among the new activites planned for this year are an on-going life planning seminar, a human poten­tial seminar and a special reception for seniors, faculty and administra­tion at which. time this year's testing and recruiting schedules will be distributed.

New law enacted 

Michigan drinking age rises 
by John McGrath 
Michigan Governor William G. Milliken recently signed a bill which raises the state's minimum drinking age from 18 to 19. The measure, Senate Bill 31, will take effect Dec. 3. 
The bill was a compromise between the plans of the Senate and House of Representatives in Michigan. 
The House had endorsed a bill 
retaining the 18-year-old age for 
drinking on the premises where alcohol was sold, but raising the age to 20 for any alcoholic bever­ages that would be taken off the premises. 
The compromise basically follow­ed the plan of the Senate, which advocated the one-year raise. 
In 1971, following the ratification of the 26th amendment to the U.S. Constitution granting 18-year-olds the right to vote, the Michigan legislature had passed the Age of

Alabama player calls S.B. home 
TUSCALOOSA, Ala. [API • As a freshman, John Mauro was a member of the Alabama football team that finished second in the nation last year. 
Ironically, when it came time for summer vacation, Mauro headed home to a place called South Bend, Ind., which just happens to be the home of a fairly well-known football school. And Notre Dame, of course, was voted the nation's No. 1 team in 1977. 
"Everywhere I went all I heard was 'Notre Dame, Notre Dame,".' says Mauro, a defensive end for Alabama, which puts its No. 1 Associated Press pre-season rank­ing on the line Saturday night in Birmingham in a nationally tele­vised ABC-TV, 9 p.m. EDT clash with lOth-ranked Nebrasks. 
"I took a lot of kidding back in South Bend about finishing No. 2,'' Mauro recalled with an embar­
.....9 thought Ob oQQ that 
gtlOW ttl S)tldtOt\0 ..... 
rassed grin. "A lot of people told me that's what I got for going away to school and if I had gone to Notre Dame I would have played on the national champions.'' 
But Notre Dame was the last place on Mauro's mind when he gradu­ated from South Bend's Marian High School, where he rewrote the record book as a tight end on three Indiana state championship teams. 
"Notre Dame recruited me heavily. but I told them I wanted to go away to school,'' Mauro said. ''My family doesn't really like Notre Dame and they told me it was up to me. 
"I visited here and I liked it. I liked the friendly atmosphere and the closeness of the football team, but I mainly came here because of Coach Bear Bryant being what he is." 
The other Indianan on the Ala­bama team is Rich Wingo, a senior linebacker from Elkhart, about 15 miles from South Bend. 
"I went to about every Notre Dame you could go to,'; Wingo recalled. "I even told my high school coach I was going to Notre Dame, but the more I thought about it, the more I realized it was too close to home. 

"When I was being recruited, I thought Alabama was too far away, but I told my coach I'd like to visit there. I visited in February and say what a beautiful place it was. I went down Sorority Row and saw all the girls wearing halter tops and I thought of all the snow back in Indiana ... " 
Striking teachers released from jail 
[API • Seven of the eight jailed Marion teachers strike leaders were released; under police guard yesterday for renewed -negotiations while all 355 strikers were ordered to appear in court next week to show why the,Y.. too, should not be jailed for defying a 'back-to-work order. ' 
Grand Circuit Judge A. Morris Hall said the seven leaders, who were released; when teachers re­fused to resume bargaining while they were in jail, would be escorted back to jail when the talks break up. 
As sheriff's deputies marched the group to the county courthouse, a neutral site where talks resumed, an estimated 400 teachers and parents applauded and cheered and motorists honked their horns.

Only one strike leader, who has not participated in the negotia­tions, was left in jail. 
The six union leaders and repre­sentatives of the state and national teacher organizations were jailed Wednesday for refusing to obey a back-to-work order. About 30 pupils, one carrying a sign that read "Free My Algebra Teacher," joined teachers at a rally at the jail yesterday, and an estimated 700 parents and teachers held another rally around the courthouse later in the day. 
The strike, one of three by Indiana teachers this week, continued, with limited classes taught by non-union teachers and substitutes being paid $50 a day--double the normal rate. 
At Richmond, the first school system to be struck this year, classes were suspended for the fourth day as 330 teachers con­tinued their walkout, which began last Thursday. Both sides were negotiating there, however. 
Parent volunteers and substitutes joined non-union teachers at the Hendricks Colunty community of Avon to keep classes going as 130 of the 300 teachers remained on the picket line for the second day despite a back-to-work order issued by Hendricks Circuit Judge Rich­ard Grover.

At the Grant County Jail, where teachers held an all-night vigil in support of their leaders, about 30 high school and junior high stu­dents held their own rally. Kim Bower, a senior at Marion High School who carried the sign supporting her algebra teacher, was asked what she would have done if she had been the judge when the school board sought contempt citations to stop the strike. "I would have made them sit down and negotiate a contract right in the courtroom," she replied. School officials said 355 of the 500 teachers were off the job. They said 57 percent of the students scheduled for class--elementary pupils, seventh-graders and high school sophomores--attended, al­though the teachers said their informal figures showed no school with more than half the students. Mindy Wesling, a Marion senior who marched at the jail, was one who wasn't in class, and she declared, "I'm not going back until they have a contract." Both Marion and Richmond teachers worked without contracts last year. 
At Richmond, where the two sides are just I percent apart in salary negotiations, the teachers said the issue was more than money. They were demanding additional pre­paration time for elementary tea­chers. a shorter school year and a 26-pupil limit on class size.

Ministry spokesman, said military flights over Norwegian territory, except for emergencies, are illegal unless approved in advance. 
Per Bjarne Lundgard, an army spokesman, said the plane was most likely a four-engine Tu-126 used for early warning and surveil­lance. These planes, 188 feet long with a 167-foot wing span, usually carry six to 10 crewman. 
The wrecked plane was spotted Wednesday by members of a four-man gian team that reports daily on weather conditions in Arctic areas. 
Station Chief Nik Nikolaisen, at Hopen 13 months, told Norwegian radio he had never seen any other planes flying over Hopen, but said the team occasionally heard high­flying planes. 
Nikolaisen said the plane was clearly marked and wreckage was scattered in the crash area about three miles from the radio station. 
The Tu-126 is not an attack plane but is armed. Nikolaisen told the Oso newspaper Aftenposten ammunition was found in the crash area.

nightly meetings, O'Connor followed the example set by Fr. Pat Peyton, who in the mid 1940's, encouraged devotion to the rosary and coined the popular adage "The family that prays together stays together.'' 
Rosary services began here on campus before World War I. In devotion to Mary and in hope for restoration of peace, they con­tinued on a daily basis until the arrival of the cafeteria-style dinner, when interest waned and the practice was discontinued. 
'·'It was easier to get the boys down to the grotto to pray when they all finished eating dinner at the same time," Fr. O'Connor remarked. However, five or six years ago he decided to re-estab­lish the tradition Of\ a weekend basis. 
Then, last October. in an effort to boost attendance, Br. John Levelle suggested that services be rein­stated on a daily basis as well.

Bland outlines fire prevention at N.D.

by EdMorau Staff Reporter 

Jact Bland, newly appointed director of fire safety, stated yes­terday that he and his staff will go out into the Notre Dame and Saint Mary's community distributing special "Fire on Campus" pam­phlets. 
Bland said that he intends to visit all buildings in addition to working with the rectors and the student body on fire preventin methods. 
Bland stated that the buildings at ND are, in themselves, "relatively fire free." "It's when the students start improvising on their rooms, like building lofts or misusiflg electrical outlets in violation of the building codes, that the chances of fire accidents occur," Bland 
co~mented. 
'We want the Notre Dame community to know what consti­lutes a fire hazard and know what to do once a fire occurs," Bland continued. "Last year at Provi­dence College, seven women were killed when a fire broke out in their dorm. The 'Fire on Campus' pam­phlet could have saved their lives.:· 
In spite of the three fires that occurred over the last school year, Bland forsees no jamor changes in fire prevention procedures, except stricter enforcement of the rules in DuLac. ''Our track record is just as good or better than any other school I know. The ND Fire Department has been in existence for 40 years now," said Bland.

''There must be more dead, but we're not sure. There are hundreds of injured.'' said a Red Cross official. 
Norman Wolfson, a New York­based public relations man repre­senting Somoza, said the purpose of the air strikes was to strafe snipers who were in the hills out of reach of troops. He denied the city had been bombed and quoted military officials as saying the snipers were terrorizing the citizenry. 
"I think they knocked off the snipers. The town was considered secure by the guard last night," Wolfson said. 
The Red Cross said at least 24 people have died in fighting since anti-Somoza violence began after guerrillas took over the capitol building Aug. 22 and seized 1,500 hostages. The guerillas and nearly 60 political prisoners were given safe passage out of the country as ransom.

Those who attend represent a mixture of ages and occupations, including students, sisters, and brothers who are here on campus, as well as the Southbenders. 
One devoted husband brings his handicapped wife who, in her wheelchair, enjoys the rosary ser­vice every night. 
Attendance might drop slightly when the weather is bad, but the number who are kept in by this occurrence is almost insignificant. Even during last year's blizzard, only two evenings of prayer were cancelled because the snow made the meeting physically impossible. 
Believers continue to come, bring­ing their hopes and their petitions along. They pray for the Pope, they pray for peace on earth, and they carry on the Notre Dame tradition at the grotto fashioned after the one founded by Berne­dctte, in Lourdes, France. 
"Why, I've never even heard of another college even having a fire ' department." 
Bland was chief of the South Bend Fire Department for 20 years. Until his recent -appointment, Bland worked part time at ND as a fireman. 
Bland mentioned that "the SO malicious false alarms we got last year ... caused problems for us." Bland suggested "strong peer reaction" as a solution to this problem. He termed the people who make these calls "stupid jerks."

"Initial trial installations in the basement of Pangborn Hall showed it was beneficial to allow students free access to the thermostats," Kemph stated. 
According to Kemph, the students will be allowed to set the thermo­stats at the temperature they find most comfortable instead of having the thermostats locked on a certain temperature. 
The thermostats are calibrated in degrees Celsius and have a range from 7'C to 24'C, explained Wil­liam Ganser, technical director of Energy Conservation. "We sug­gest 20'C as a comfortable set­ting," he continued. 
A daily signal from the central system will set the thermostats at a night-time setting approximately four degrees below the original temperature, added Ganser. "Stu­dents can easily override the central system impulse and return to the original temperature by using a small lever on the side of the thermostat" 
According to Ganser, all students having a thermostat in their room will be provided with a letter explaining its proper use. 
'"We expect a minimum of 30 percent energy savings," added Kemph. "The cost of energy has risen five times in the past ftfteen years."

The administration is overreact­ing to the problems of alcoholism and alcohol abuse on campus by restricting the presence of alcohol rather than promoting responsible drinking. 
As the flurry of initial campus activity slows to its normal pace, many students will return to their favority pastimes -going to the bars and drinking. Although movies, occasional plays and parties featuring Notre Dame's version of "20 Questions" will be available for social diversion, there will always be students who prefer "going to the bars." 
Across the country, bars are the weekend meeting place for thousands of college students. Unfortunately, at many colleges, the bars are off-limits for anyone under 21; and to enter a bar before reaching that age could have serious repercussions. Notre Dame, falling under Indiana law, is one such institution. However, because private comsumption of alcohol is not regulated by state

laws, the use of alcohol on campus is regulated by University rules and regulations. 
Du Lac states the University wants students to be aware of the legal drinking age, and in rule 6 states, they are tolerant of' 'the use of alcoholic beverages in modera­tion." Translated to practice, this rule means the University will do everything possible to prevent any drinking outside of football tail­gaters and parties contained to prjvate rooms. 
The reason behind this practice is obvious. Tailgaters are ubiqui­tous before a football game. The problem of containing them stems from their popularity among alum­ni, family, and friends of the University as well as students. I have no doubt that, if it were possible to enforce rules against student tailgaters, such a rule would be instituted. There are already rumors that, during upcoming horne games any student kegger separated from the rest will be shut down. 
Ifthis and other rumors are true, it appears the University is going to enforce Rule 6 more strictly than in previous years. A $50.00 fine for students caught with beer inside the stadium may be instituted; and the official meaning of what consti­tutes a room may be changed. While, in the past few years, a blocked off hallway could serve as a "room" for section parties, there is some doubt that this practice may continue. 
None of these practices will stop stl)pents from abusing alcohol. They will merely force students who wish to drink to patronize local bars more frequently and campus entertainment facilities less often. 
Many students are residents of 
states where the drinking age is 18. 
Wfien these students come to 
Notre Dame, they are asked to give 
up a privilege they enjoy at horne, 
and many balk at the idea of having 
to do so. Allowing them to drink on 
campus, in contained situations, 
keeps these students from illegally 
patronizing bars. This may prevent 
legal trouble as well as accidents 
incurred while travelling; for once 
underage drinkers gain entry, they 
are sure to celebrate their 
"victory" with a fierceness which 
loses its flavor once it is no longer 
illegal. 
Although alcohol is not a necessi­
ty, it has become a socially accepta­ble refreshment. The problem of abuse occurs when it ceases to be refreshing and becomes an addic­tion. But the way to solve abuse is not through prohibition. More .'viable solutions exist. For exam­ple, education about the potential hazards of abusive drinking and discipline of "drunk and disorder­
ly" persons may be more effective.

Fighting Inflation

[Art Buchwald is on assignment for a few weeks trying to find out if there are any Cuban troops on Cape Cod-He left behind his all-time favorite columns.] 
WASHINGTON--The wonderful thing about American industry is that it rises to every challenge. Even something as distasteful as inflation has not discouraged most manufacturers. The solution to the problem is not in the product but in the package. Rather than raise the prices on many goods, American industry is devising new methods to make the product smaller, while making the package larger. In this way, the customer feels assured that nothing has changed. 
I visited one of the largest packaging companies in the country the other day to see how they were doing it. The vice­president in charge of inflationary design took me around the plant. 
"We're going 24 hours a day." he said proudly. "Everyone is asking us for new designs to help them get through this rough period ... 
I noticed women in white smocks working with tweezers under microscopes. 
"What are those women doing?" I asked. 
"Those are 15-cent chocolate bars on their tweezers. They put each one in that large aluminum foil and then they wrap wax paper around it. Over the wax paper they put the name of the chocolate bar in large letters. Here's one that's finished." 
"Why, from the outside it looks like an old-fashioned chocolate bar!" 
"No one can tell the difference until the package is opened,'' he said proudly. 
We went into another part of the building. there were air hoses hanging all over the ceiling and boxes were rolling along a conveyor belt. 
I looked perplexed. 
"We're packaging soap flakes in here," he shouted above the din. "The lady down at the beginning of the line puts one teaspoonful of soap flakes into one of those giant sized boxes; then those men over there with the hoses pump air into 
the rest of the box." 
"How ingenious!" I shouted back. 
"The bottom of the box is 
weighted with very heavy card­
board so no one will know, when 
picking up the box, how many soap 
flakes there are in it." 
"T~~t's a lot of air to put in 11 
box. 
"We don't use the air for only .soap flakes. We also use it for · cereals, baking products and any­
thing that comes in a box. 
··Let me show you this invention which we have a patent on. This is a see-through wax paper window for noodles. Well, when y_ou look at it, you think you're getting a full box of noodles. Right?" 
"Of course." 
"Now, look at the inside of the 
box." 
"Why, the only noodles in it are 
stuck to the window," I said in 
amazement. 
"Yep. The windows and the 
noodles are magnetized. When the 
window fills up with noodles, the 
box moves on." 
"Are those frozen TV dinners 
over there?" 
"They certainly are. They look 
like complete dinners, don't they?'' 
"You bet." 
"Now, look under the tray. You 
see how it's indented? There's 
nothing in the tray but what you 
see on the top." 
"Fantastic," I said. 
He took me into another building 
which had a large sign, PHARMA 
CEUTICALS, on the outisde.

"What do you do with that stuff?" I asked. · 
"We put two pills in each bottle and stuff the rest of it with white cotton. If it weren't for cotton, I don't think the drug industry would survive.''

Aquitted girl feels 'bitter' toward police 
BOWUNG GREEN Ky. [AP] • 
Marla Elaine Pitchford says she 
feels bitter toward the police and 
the court in which she was tried on 
a self-induced abortion charge, but 
not toward her former fiance who 
testified against her. 
"Evetyone has made him out to 
be the big, bad villain and I don't 
think that's right," Miss Pitchford 
said Thursday in an interview. 
"This has been hard on me and ifs 
been hard on him, too." 
She said the young man, Dwight 
Mundy, lost his job because of 
publicity surrounding her trial. 
Miss Pitchford, 22, was charged 
with performing an illegal abortion 
on herself with a knitting needle. 
According to court testimony, she 
had been turned away from a 
Louisville clinic because her preg­
nancy was too far advanced. 
Testimony placed her stage of -pregnancy at five or six months. Mundy testified it was his idea to go to the clinic. 
Miss Pitchford was found inno­
cent on grounds of insanity Wed­
nesday by a Warren County Circuit 
Court jury. The judge had 
instructed the jurors to find Miss 
Pitchford innocent if they felt she 
had no control over her actions at 
the time of the abortion. 
In the living room of her sister's 
Bowling Green apartment yester­
day, Miss Pitchford seemed 
relaxed but tired. 
She said that after the verdict ­
and after the reporters, tape re­
corders and television lights disap­
peared -"I just tried to rest, tried 
to sleep. I was exhausted." 
Miss Pitchford said it's too soon 
to judge the impact of the trial, but 
she said her attorney plans tos tart 
an effort to review abortion laws 
2 students, 3 professors die 
Two Notre Dame students and three faculty members passed away during the summer. 
Bruce Plunkett, a pre-med junior from Maryland, died in a Metrolin­er train accident on July 23. Plunkett is survived by his parents, Mr. and Mrs. B.J. Plunkett and three brothers. 
Joseph R. Cerven, a junior in the college of engineering, was killed in an auto accident in Cas!l County, Michigan last may 14. Cerven is survived by his parents, Mr. and Mrs. J.T. Cerven.

across the country. 
Focus of the review would be to 

make sure that the laws are written 
so that women cannot be brought to 
trial for giving themselves abor­
tions, Miss Pitchford said. 
"It was wrong that this happened," she said. "I feel a little bitter toward the police and the court." 
Miss Pitchford said she looks 

forward to the time when the 
publicity diminishes. 
"I think that in two months, they'll forget my face and forget my name and maybe just remem­ber the case."

WASIDNGTON fAP]-President 
Carter reached out to governors and businessmen yesterday seek­ing support for a compromise bill to phase out federal price controls on new natural gas by 1985.

Later, the president was sched­... uled to speak to some 100 exec­

Meanwhile, an Associated Press survey found 18 senators support­ing the measure and an other 14 leaning that way for 32 potential votes. Thirty-five senators said they were against or leaning against the proposal and another 33 said they were undecided.

Rodgers Charlie Joiner, Artie Owens and rookie John Jefferson are all in the wide receiver stable. The San Diego offensive line is bullworked by veterans Russ Washington and Doug Wilkerson. 
The Charger defense is young and aggressive. Lou Keleher, a defensive tackle, went to the Pro Bowl last year. Gary Johnson, Fred Dean and Leroy Jones join him up front. Linebackers Don Goode, Woodrow Lowe and Bob Horn ~re very active. Cornerback Mike Williams and safety Mike Fuller head an above average secondary. 
The Chargers should continue to improve this season and finish with eight or so wins.

season, not a bad number for an expansion team. They

Program 
[continued from page 1] 
Another program being institued is a women's self-defense class. The program, which will be offered through the physical education department, will be open to all students and will run for a set number of times later this fall, Jones explained. 
Roemer urged students to take advantage of the class, pointing out that if few people take the class, another opportunity to help women 
will be lost. 
The SAl report contained aa large number of suggestions concerning hall monitors in women's dorms. All of these suggestions have been implemen­ted, Roemer said. The suggestions included equipping hall monitors with walkie-talkies, and integrating them with the security system. 
One suggestion not instituted was a plan for a stud en honor patrol system, Roemer stated. He said he received little response on the idea from student government, so he abandoned it. 
Another proposal ·at leas tem­porarily scratched was one for a 
security booth at the corner of 
d. t

U. . S 31 and the road Iea mg o
Saint Mary's. Roemer felt the benefit of the booth would not f 't d dd d th t

he "was not convinced that it running backs are Sherman Smith and Don Testerman. Smith is a powerful runner who should be around the NFL for a long time. Former Notre Dame star AI Hunter is also available in the Seahawk backfield. The top Seahawk receiver is Steve Largent. The Seattle offensive line is a combination of expansion draft acquisitions and young' players; it can be improved. 
The best part of the Seattle defense is linebacking. Sammy Green,entering his third season, and Terry Beeson, starting his second, are the two best tacklers. Another former Notre Dame star Steve Niehaus is the best player on the Seahawk defensive line. The secondary needed some help so the Hawks drafted Keith Simpson of Memphis State number one. Unfortunately, Simpson was recently felled by a knee injury. Don Dufek, another deep back, was also injured in pre-season. This will be a trouble area for the Seattle franchise. 
Once again the Seahawks should score a lot of points but they will also give up more than their share of scores. Look for Seattle to win six games. 
KANSAS CITY CHIEFS-The Chiefs were once heralded a!<• the team of the seventies, but they have slid steadily downhill since their Super Bowl triumph. Mike Livingston and Tony Adams are journeymen quarterbacks and it doesn't really make a difference who plays. Tony Reed and Mark Bailey are good young runners but neither can carry the load himself. Walter White and Henry Marshall are the two best receivers. Center Jack Rudnay is the only offensive lineman worth mentioning. 
Top pick Art Still should help right away on defense, but he can't do it alone either. The defensive unit, on the whole is too small; linebackers Thomas Howard and Jimbo Elrod weigh about 210 pounds, defensive end Whitney Paul weighs 220 pounds. The two most effective players on the Chiefs are CB Gary Green and saftey Gary Barbaro. 
It will be a very long season for new coach Marv Levy and the Chiefs. Maybe they should secede from the NFL along with the Buffalo, Green Bay and New Orleans franchises and for~ their own league. At least then some of these teams mtght approach the .500 mark.

Roemer stated that each hall will have two fire drills this year, one in the fall, and another at a later date in the year. The drills will be conducted by Jack Bland, director of fire safety, Roemer said. 
A reccommendation that the director of security be in charge of security of the ACC, the football stadium and Senior Bar was also put into effect this summer, Roemer said. 
... 
To curb drinking in the stadium, Roemer announced that a $50 fine will be strictly enforced for persons imbiding alcohol at football games. Roemer said he hopes to eliminate the drinking problem in the stadium and all over campus this year.

by Lou Severino Sports Writer 
The 1978 Fighting Irish football team will return to action Sept. 9th without sixteen seniors who capped off a fine four year career with a National Championship and an 11-1 season in 1977. However, for many of these 16 ballplayers the chat­lcngc of the NFL lies ahead. Nine members of last year's squad were drafted by NFL clubs including three first-round pies: Ken Mac-Afec (7th overall), Ross Browner (IHh overall), and luther Bradley (lith) were all selected in the opening round. Several other Irish gridiron stars have impressed NFL coached in the pre-season. 
Probably the most successful Notre Dame graduate at this early juncture in the NFL season is Ken MacAfec. The 6'4" 253 pounder who ranks third on the all-time list of Irish receivers with 128 recep­tions is listed as the San Francisco 49crs number one tight end. "Big ·mac" caught 4 passes in the pre-season for. 76 yards and one touchdown, and his blocking has been even more impressive. In a phone interview 49crs assistant public relations man Phil Waidin­gcr said. "Ken has been destroy­ing people with his blocking. He's 
like having an extra tackle on the line with his great size and strength However, with the loss of former All-Pro receiver Gene Washington, MacA fee may be used on more 'pass routes in the regular season. Third round pick Ernie Hughes has also earned plaudits from the 49cr coaching staff. Waidinger 
have not been very competitive in recent years. The battle 
b~·twecn the Oakland Raiders and the Denver Broncos for 
the AFC West crown last year was one of the few instances 
of competition in these divisions. The situation does, 
nowl·vcr, seem to be improving. Not only are the Raiders 
and the Broncos set to do battle this year, but the Rams are 
being threatened by the Atlanta Falcons and possibly the 
San Francisco 49ers. 
Here's one view of pro football's western divisions: 
NFC West 
LOS ANGElES RAMS--The Rams arc quickly becoming the 
football equivalent of the New York Yankees. Chuck Knox 
resigned under pressure last winter and Carroll Rosenbloom 
hired George Allen away from the Redskins. Two games 
into this year's cxhihitioQ schedule Rosenbloom decided 
that he had enough of Allen and fired him. Ray Malavasi 
was named head coach. Just yesterday two of Malavasi's 
assistant coaches got into a fight in a strategy meeting. All 
this and the season has not yet begun. It should be very 
interesting. 
The Rams' offense is now in the hands of Pat Haden, who 
had his share of troubles in the latter stages of last season. 
The Rams are loaded with running backs. Lawrence 
McCutcheon is the best of the LA. ball toters but John 
Cappcletti and Wendell Tyler are not far behind. Billy 
Waddy, a second year man, is quickly becoming a threat at 
wide receiver. Charley Young should be ready to take his 
place at tight end. The Rams offensive line is solid. Tom 
Mack. Dennis Harrah and Doug France are all fine blockers. 
Defensively, the Rams still boast the talents of Jack Youngblood and Isiah Robertson. These two have been to the Pro Bowl regularly in the past five seasons. The defensive line also has Larry Brooks and Fred Dryer while 'anothenlinebackerr~is Jim Youngblood (no relation to Jack). Monte Jackson, probably the Rams best defensive back was recently traded to the Oakland Raiders. That leaves the Rams with Bill Simpsom, Dave Elmendorf, Pat Thomas and RodPerryto defend the deep zones. While their coverage may be good all of these players are on the small side. 
The Rams have coasted to the NFC west crown in recent 
years, they will have to fight for it this time around. 
ATLANTA FALCONS--The Rams' chief competition in this 
Falcon club which allowed the fewest points in the NFL last 
season, but generated little offense. 

The spiritual leader of the defense is old pro Claude Humphrey. This eleven-year veteran has been a great pass rusher all his career, but just now is he beginning to play the run as well as the pass. His bookend, Jeff Merrow, is not as well known, but he is very effective. Wilson Faumina is the nose fuard. The four Falcon linebackers, lead by another eleven-year vet Greg Brezina, are the key to the defense. They have played very well in the past and there is noreason to expect anything else this season. Rolland Lawrence is the top deep back. 
If the Falcon offense can just score some points this year, described the 255-pound guard as "a quick learner who has improved quickly and adjusted well to the NFL." Waidinger predicted that 

Hughes would be a starting guard 
for the 49ers by mid-season. 
Injuries have hampered the pro­gress of a trio of former Irish defensive stars. The Bookends, Ross Browner and Willie Fry, have both been handicapped by serious injuries. Browner, the 1977 Vince Lombardi trophy winner and Cin­cinnati's top pick teamed with Wilson Whitley, Eddie Edwards and Gary Burley to form oine of the NFl's youngest defensive Jines-­until suffering a torn bicep muscle in an early exhibition contest. Ross will miss the first four to six weeks. of the regular season. However, once he recovers, Browner should be a dominant force in increasing, the Bengals' quarterback sacks total which dropped off to only 25 last year. 
The other half of the Notre Dame defensive end tandem, Willie Fry, suffered a bad break when he tore tendons in his right hand during a pre-season practice. The injury forced the Pittsburgh Steelers to place him on the inJured reserve list which means Fry is through for the year. The former Irish tri­captain had seen exhibition duty at defensive end playing alongside 
Mean Joe Greene. 

Another former Notre Dame de­fcnsive stalwart, luther Bradley, suffered a pulled hamstring which forced him to sit out several pre-season practices. However, 'the all-time Irish interception leader has returned to Detroit this week and will start at cornerback 
on favorite to win the Atlanta QB spot, but second year man 
June Jones came from nowhere to get that nod. Jones is an 
unproven quantity. The top point producers for the Falcon 
offense should be Bubba Bean. a running back, Alfred 
Jenkins, a wide receiver, and tight end Jim Mitchell. The 
Atlanta offensive line is average. 
The Falcons should fight the Rams to the finish in the 
NFC West if Jones can generate a fair amount of offense. 
SAN FRANCISCO 49ER'S--Even though O.J. Simpson has come back to his former stomping grounds. all of the 49ers' troubles have not disappeared.
First of all there is the quarterback spot. The 49ers cut 
Jim Plunkett after he had several horrendous outings. The 
new signal caller is Steve DeBerg, a second year man from 
San Jose State. The youngster will certainly receive a 
baptism under fire. Simpson should be joined in the 
backfield by Wilbur Jackson, but the former Alabama star 
has had injury problems this pre-season. Greg Boykin, 
David Williams or Paul Hofer could take Jackson's place. 
The top receiver for the 49ers this year should be Freddie 
Solomon, obtained from Miami in the Del Williams trade. 
Former Notre Dame tight end Ken MacAfee, the club's top 
pick should help the passing game and his blocking should 
bolster the ground attack. The 49er line is young and 
relatively inexperienced. 
The key to the 49er defense is their line. Cedrick 
Hardeman is a fine pass rusher at end as is his counterpart, 
Cleveland Elam. Jimmy Webb and Ed Galigher are the 
tackles. The linebacking is weak; a rookie, Danny Bunz, will 
start in the middle. The best players in the secondary are 
Eddie Lewis and Anthony Leonard, though ne~ther of these 
players are in the all-star class. 
If DeBerg can produce, the 49e,rs have a shot at the 
playoffs, but that chance seems more likely a year from now. 
NEW ORLEANS SAINTS--Are the Saints rebuilding again? Well if they aren't, maybe they ought to think about it. Dick Nolan takes over a team which was beaten by Tampa Bay for the Buccaneers first victory ever. The offense should at least be exciting with Archie Manning, Chuck Muncie, Tony Galbreath, Larry Burton and super rookie Wes Chandler. Chandler is a w_ide receiver with super speed and moves who doubles as a kiCk returner. He may well win the NFC rookie honors..The. Saints' offensive line has added Conrad Dobler, but tt sttll needs some help. . . 
One of the Saints' best defenstve players, Joe Campbellts out for the season with an injury. The rest of the Saints' defense would do well to follow suit. Linebacker Joe Federspiel is overworked at linebacker. The best Saints defensive back is Ralph McGill, who was a 49er cast-off. That tells you something about the quality of the Saints' defense. 
Owner John Mecom must be wondering what he has to do to come up with a winner. The Saints have yet to have a playoff team and at the rate they are going it will be a few years before they get there.

The most surprising N.D. grad to ~­make the NFL is Doug Becker, the only other member of the Class of 78 currently on an NFL roster. Becker was cut by Pittsburgh t' despite an impressive pre-season with the linebacker-rich Steelers. But Tuesday the Chicago Bears, who had lost starting linebacker t Waymond Bryant with a knee injury, claimed Becker. The 6'0" 233 pounder will be slated for duty as a backup linebacker and "may see action on special teams," accordint to Bears coach Niell Armstrong. 
Former N.D. cornerback Ted Burgmeier lasted until the final cut with the Miami Dolphins before being waived. However, the new NFL rules allow teams to juggle their rosters until Sunday when the player limit will be 45. Burgmeier has a good chance to be picked up by another club--possibly Chicago, San Francisco, or New York--all teams which need help in the defensive secondary.

OAKLAND RAIDERS--It seems as though the Raiders have 
been atop this division forever. AI Davis has an excellent 
organization in the Bay Area and the new talent just keeps 
rolling in. 
Ken Stabler is, as usual. at the Raider helm. Mark Van 
Eeghen and Clarence Davis are his running backs. Fred 
Biletnikoff. Cliff Branch and Dave Casper are the receivers. 
Any of them could make all-pro. The offensive line is one of 
the best in the league with Art Shell and Gene Upshaw 
leading the way. Punter Ray Guy is an offensive weapon. The Raider defense is big. strong and fast. The defensive line features Dave Rowe. John Matuszak and Otis Sistrunk. 
W'll Phil Villapiano, Monte Johnson, Ted Hendricks and I Y Hall arc the linebackers. That is a solid front seven. JacJ. Tatum leads the head-hunting Oakland secondary. Backups Neal Colzie and Charlie Phillips should win starting jobs in the deep zones this year. The supply of talent in Oakland is astonishing, every time a new player is needed, the Raiders seem to find him. Look for Oakland to recapture the Western crown from Denver this year, but not without a fight. 
DENVER BRONCOS--Broncomania has still not subsided in 
Denver and the Bronco fans fully expect to return to the 
Super Bowl. 
The key to the Denver team is its defense. It was the 
Denver defense that stopped the Steelers and the Raiders in 
the playoffs last year. This year the story should be much 
the same. linebackers Randy Gradishar and Tom Jackson 
are the two top defenders. They are ably assisted by Rob 
Swenson and Joe Rizzo. John Grant, Rubin Carter and lyle 
Alzado are the three best performers up front. Steve Foley 
and Louie Wright are the two best defenders against the 
pass. . 
Craig Morton is the Denver quarterback afte~ hts cinderella season last year. Morton, however, turned mto a pumpkin in New Orleans and he could be unseated if he does not produce early this season. The top Denver running backs are Jon Keyworth and Rob Lytle. Otis Armstrong would be a big plus if he could only get but of the coach's doghouse. Receivers Jack Dolbin and Haven Moses are good targets for Morton.Tightend Riley Odoms is one of the more underrated players in the league. The JJronco offensive line is above average. 
Denver's fine season last year was by no means a fluke. This team should be every bit· as good, except maybe at quarterback, and it should battle Oakland for a playoff spot. 
SAN DIEGO CHARGERS--The Chargers have slowly been building their team into one of the better young units in the league. 
San Diego has two good quarterbacks in Dan Fouts and James Harris. Harris played most of last season while Fouts was on sabbatical. This ;;cason Fouts seems to have the upper hand. Whoever is at the helm will have a lot of offensive firepower with which to work. Recently acquired Lydell Mitchell should join Don Woods and Bo Matthews to give the Chargers a solid ground attack.
