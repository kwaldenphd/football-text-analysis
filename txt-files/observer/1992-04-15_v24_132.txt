undergaduate education 

By COLLEEN KNIGHT 
News Writer 
A committee of students and faculty is being formed that will monitor the quality of un­dergraduate education at Notre Dame, Student Body President Greg Butrus recently announced. 
The Standing Committee for Undergraduate Education will address issues raised by Student Government in their report for the Board of Trustees, "Back to Basics." According to Butrus, the com­mittee will consist of seven stu­dents and two faculty who will continually monitor class sizes, class availability and faculty hiring. 
The committee will also try to establish a more cooperative relationship with administra­tion officials, Butrus added, so they will be able to collect the information they need to moni­tor the University's progress. Butrus said this should not be

Chicago's loop closed down after flooded by tunnel leak 
CHICAGO (AP) -Mayor Richard Daley on Tuesday fired an official he said failed to heed a warning that probably could have prevented the flooding that has paralyzed much of Chicago's business district. 
"This morning I have re­quested and received the resig­nation of acting transportation commissioner John LaPlante," Daley said at a news conference at City Hall. 
LaPlante ignored a memo April 2 that warned him to im­mediately repair a crack in a tunnel under the Chicago River, Daley said. "The memo said the wall should be immediately re­paired. citing the danger of flooding the entire freight tun­nel system," Daley said. 
On Monday, the tunnel did in­deed burst, sending water through the turn-of-the-century freight tunnel network and flooding basements under the city's Loop district with millions of gallons of water. 
Phones went unanswered at LaPlante's office Tuesday afternoon. 
Daley said that after the memo came in, LaPlante's de­partment began getting cost es­timates from a couple of con­struction companies, decided they were too high and was weighing further action when the collapse occurred. 


SMC selects commencement speaker 
Special to The Observer 
Virginia state Supreme Court Justice Elizabeth Lacy will ad­dress the 1992 graduating class of Saint Mary's College at its 145th annual commencement on May 16. 
The College expects 423 graduates to take part in this year's ceremony, which begins at noon, outdoors in the Court of LeMans Hall. In the event of inclement weather, the proceedings will take place in Angela Athletic Facility. 
Saint Mary's will award an honorary degree to the Rev. Edward Malloy, president of the University of Notre Dame, in recognition of his personal accomplishments and in com­memoration of the University's 150th anniversary. 
The College will present its President's Medal for commu­nity service and contributions to 
the  life  of  the  College  to  
Maureen  Welch  of  
Mechanicsville, PA.  

Valedictorian for the senior 



Elizabeth Lacy 
class is Teresa Lynch, an English Literature major from Joliet, IL. 
Other events on the com­mencement weekend schedule include the annual pinning cer­emony for nursing graduates, marking their entry into the nursing profession, on May 15 at 1 p.m. in the LeMans Chapel. The baccalaureate mass will also be celebrated on the 15th, at 4 p.m. in Angela Athletic Facility, with Bishop John D'Arcy of the Diocese of Fort Wayne-South Bend presiding and Malloy giving the homily. 
Lacy was appointed to the Supreme Court of Virginia in 1989. She is a 1966 cum laude graduate of Saint Mary's, re­ceiving a bachelor's degree in history. 
After graduation from the University of Texas Law School, she worked as a staff attorney with the Texas Legislative Council from 1969 to 1972. Lacy's 12-year term with the Virginia Supreme Court began February 1, 1989. 
Saint Mary's will present her with an honorary doctorate of humanities degree. 
Malloy, who will also receive an honorary doctorate degree of humanities, was named president of Notre Dame in 1986. He is vice chair and chair-elect of the American Council on Education board of directors and serves on the board of nominators of the

cation." 
"Undergraduate education is our top priority," Butrus con­tinued. "We will meet regularly to make sure it gets the funding and attention it deserves and to see if we are meeting our goals." 
The committee will be com­posed of one student senator, one class officer, two hall pres­idents, two faculty members and three appointees chosen by Butrus. It will be chaired by Butrus and one of his ap­pointees. 
"It is a working group that will be thinking on a constant basis," Butrus said. "If we see that improvements are not made on the quality of under­graduate education, we will be able to move quickly and report to appropriate administrative officials." 
"It is a tremendous priority of Student Government to keep attention focused on this issue," he added. "The dialogue has begun. We are going to make sure it continues." 
problem that could have been avoided. This was not a minor oversight." 
Much of the Loop remained closed Tuesday, as city workers struggled to plug the leak and drain the water -and fish ­that stood more than 40 feet deep in the bowels of some high-rises. 
Some 200 buildings remained dark Tuesday. Power was shut off to avert a threat of trans­formers shorting out and ex­ploding in the flooded areas. Officials said they were not cer­tain when power would be re­stored. 
Gov. Jim Edgar said he has declared Chicago a state disas­ter area and would ask the fed­eral government for emergency disaster relief. 
Despite reports late Monday that the hole leading into the old system of freight tunnels had been sealed, Dave Mosena, chief of staff for Daley, said that water continued to flow. 
"We are not out of the water by any means," Mosena said Tuesday morning. 
Subway riders were forced to use buses or elevated trains to get downtown, uncertain whether their buildings were open. Police directed traffic at busy intersections where sig­

HPC discusses options for current food policy 
By EMILY HAGE 
News Writer 
In response to recent complaints about its food policy, the Hall Presidents' Council decided last night to investigate giving their identification numbers and having meals from· the dining halls delivered for post-meeting dinners. 
The HPC values its post­meeting social time to discuss ideas between dorm presidents that are not possible during the meeting. However, the group wants to maintain the student body support which has fallen into question because of the past tradition of dinners funded by each dorm for HPC members. 
Stanford co*president Kevin Monohan said that 
the past complimentary dinners were an "act of hospitality" to thank the HPC for its service to the students. 
Serving only snacks was suggested, but Siegfried Hall president Priscilla Peralta said that when this was offered at St. Ed's last week, no one stayed. 
Hall presidents plan to reconvene on the food issue next week after talking to their hall councils. 
HPC passed a resolution instituting two study days for the fall 1992 semester which was unanimously passed at the Student Senate on Monday.

News that two Saint------­


Mary's students were 
raped within two weeks 
has shocked both 
campuses. It's sadly ironic 
that the incidents 
happened just days after 
Sexual Assault Awareness 
Week reminded the.­
community with letters and MONICA 
red ribbons that rape is a YANT very real, and very Editor-in-Chief 
prevalent, occurrence. 
The news elicits from the average student a 

range of emotions, from fear to rage. But for 
editors at The Observer, the shock hits closer 
to home when decisions must be made on how 
to cover these sensitive cases. 
Covering a rape is unlike any other situation 

facing student editors. On one hand. it is a 
reporter's instinct to push for all the facts and 
details. On the other, there is logic and 
sensitivity that dictates caution and respect for 
the survivor. 
Our job is not made easier by campus au­

thorities. At both Notre Dame and Saint 
Mary's, administrators draw a fine line be­
tween what to release and what to contain. 
With sexual assaults involving unknown at­
tackers, both schools are almost always willing 
to release the necessary information. 
But when a rape involves an acquaintance, 

usually presumed to be a male Notre Dame 
student, 'mum' is the word. 
Administrators and security otlicials at both schools differ on the reasoning for keeping most acquaintance rapes out of The Observer. Some argue that the incidents are matters for Student Affairs to handle and are therefore confidential. Others claim that secrecy is kept only in the interest of the survivor. 
The Observer has maintained and proven that our interest in reporting on any sexual assault is not to sensationalize the incident or endanger the survivor; we do not print names or any other descriptive features about assaults that could jeopardize a survivor's safety. 
But at the same time, we have repeatedly stressed that the dissemination of even the most basic information about rapes-especially acquaintance rapes-is of the utmost interest to the student bodies for purposes of education, protection and prevention. Saint Mary's security and Residence Life should be applauded for doing just that with the rape that occurred last Thursday. 
The Observer is not alone in its crusade for a more open policy for the release of information on sexual assaults. Notre Dame's Student Government and Campus Life Council are among many groups demanding that the administration commit itself to protecting its students in the best way possible-by being truthful to them when acquaintance rapes occur. 
Not all survivors find the courage to report their stories to security, which usually leads to newspaper coverage. For those that opt to handle the incident through Student Affairs, the need for a timely release to the media is no different than for those who file a security report. 
With either channel, the stories remain the same. And with either channel, the possibility that alerting students to the stories will prevent future incidents must necessitate that the release of information be the same. 
The views expressed in the Inside Column are those of the author and not necessarily those ofThe Observer.

 INDIAN POLIS -Rape charges are pending against two 7-year-old boys who allegedly attacked a first-grade classmate in a public school restroom."It is hard to believe, isn't it?" said Gary Chavers, a deputy prosecutor who heads juvenile investigations. Authorities believe the incident is the first involving suspects so young. "I think our youngest was a 10-year­old charged a couple of months ago with rape," Chavers said. The alleged attack occurred during school hours March 26 at a school in a working-class neighborhood on the city's east side.

Salaries stay same for SMC staff, faculty 
By JILL HOTEK News Writer 
No salary or wage increases were issued for next year's Saint Mary's faculty or staff, according to Dan Osberger, Vice President of Fiscal Affairs. 
One reason for the salary freeze was the projection of lower enrollment for the up­coming year, he said. 
"The revenues of Saint Mary's are dependent on the enrollment levels," said Osberger. 
He said the projected enroll­ment level for Saint Mary's is lower than that of previous years due to a smaller number of 18-year-olds in society. 
Rather than lower Saint Mary's admissions requirements to increase enrollment and revenues, Saint Mary's has chosen to maintain its high academic standards and continue admitting only qualified applicants, according to Osberger. 
Osberger said that the fac­ulty and staff have been told of the salary freezes and how they will affect their contracts. 
Over the past several weeks, the faculty has voted in support of a one year salary freeze for all faculty, said Tom Parisi, Chair of the Psychology Department and President of the Faculty Assembly. 
"The faculty came to the agreement that due to the nationwide economic recession, it recommended to the college not to take salary increases for 
next year." he said.

Norville discusses women's roles and her own goals, experiences 
By ERIN BROWN News Writer 
Television and radio journalist Deborah Norville touched on issues ranging from women's roles as career-holders and mothers, to the media, and the current presidential campaigns during a lecture at Saint Mary's last night. 
On a more personal side, Norville talked about her goals and advances within her own life and career during her pre­sentation "Issues Facing Women." 
Norville, who currently hosts an ABC radio show from her home, said that the the show is a "free-for-all communication. People call in and talk about whatever is on their mind." 
Norville received the position shortly after her maternity leave from NBC's Today Show. 
According to Norville, many women in the media and else­where, including herself, have opened doors for women in corporate America to be viewed as productive and valuable right up until the time of their child's birth. 
Norville said that she had a great decision to make about returning to the show or staying home with her son. However, she added, she also had an opportunity that most parents don't have since she is able to 
work out of her home, and 
therefore, spend more time 
with her son. 
In regards to current gov­
ernment programs and issues 
in the upcoming elections, 
Norville stressed the impor­
tance of people's involvement in 
order to bring about change. 
"What it takes is people car­
ing," she said. "It takes you 
being involved." Norville also 
stressed to her audience the 
importance of voting in the up­
coming presidential elections in

ing the country today such as

and prenatal child care. 
She said, "If you don't vote, 
you're part of the problem. I 
hope you care and I hope you're

As a graduate of the 
University of Georgia, Norville 
noted the difference in stu­
dents' roles and opportunities 
now than when she graduated. 
She added, "My priorities 
were definitely different in col­
lege. I think now they are dif­
ferent because I think 
(students) have a much clearer 
picture of where the world is 
and what their role in the world 
is likely to be." 
She also pointed out that 
women's voice in the media is 
seldom heard because, until 
recently, it has not been 
"authoritative enough."

America have heightened women's role and recent studies have shown that people are used to seeing men and women as broadcast anchors in equal, non-threatening environments, she said. 
She continued, "there is a certain role-model aspect of being a woman in broadcasting, or just being a woman in a professional capacity in front of people, that I think is very beneficial." 
Norville also spoke about balancing her career at NBC and her family. She said that early in her career she made many personal sacrifices and put in long hours in order to attain the success that she has achieved. 
She feels that she was very fortunate to get the opportuni­ties that she did and encour­aged the audience to put forth their full effort in any career or opportunity. 
She added that "If you don't take any risk, you don't get any reward."

SMC junior receives scholarship 
By HEIDI DECKELMANN News Writer 
Saint Mary's College junior Delia Garcia received the Harry Truman Scholarship awarded to students pursuing a career in public service. 
Garcia is a political science and Spanish major, and the second Saint Mary's student to receive the Truman Award. Elizabeth Van Dersa,rl received the award in 1991. 
Truman scholars receive up to $30,000 for undergraduate and graduate educational ex­penses over a 4 year period. More than 1,300 students are nominated annually for the award, and only 79 awards are expected to be given this year. 
Nominees are reviewed by an independent panel consisting of public service and educational officials. Award selections are based on an extensive application process as well as personal interviews with over 200 finalists. 

Garcia was honored by independent colleges and universities as one of 30 outstanding first generation college students from the state. 
Active in both the Saint Mary's and South Bend communities, Garcia is involved with the Office of Minority, International and Non-Traditional Student Life working on workshops and outreach programs. 
She has served as a counselor for El Campo de Cultura y Cononcimiento, the College's summer program for Hispanic girls, and is a founding member of Fuerza, an organization which provides college-age role models for girls in the South Bend Hispanic community. 
Garcia also assisted with the Pauia program for gifted and talented girls. 
After graduation, she plans to study either political science or public administration. She added that she is unsure of where she will attend graduate school, but is presently looking at both University of California at Berkeley and University of Michigan. 
"I want to help the community at large, by addressing the problems of education and economic development as they affect all of us," said Garcia when asked about her ideal career goals. "In particuiar, I am concerned with the effects of these problems on the Hispanic community in the United States." 
Garcia and other recipients will be honored at an awards ceremony at the Truman Library in Independence, Missouri, following a five-day leadership and orientation program in Liberty, Missouri.

Largest telescope completed 
Hawaii (AP) -The mirror of the world's largest telescope, which scientists say will provide new views of how stars, galaxies and the universe Itself evolves, was completed Tuesday. 
The last of 36 half-ton hexagonal segments was lowered into place at the Keck Observatory at the 13,600-foot summit of the dormant Mauna Kea volcano on Hawaii Island. Together the segments form a 10­meter mirror surface. 
"This Is a major milestone," said Jerry Nelson, astronomy professor at the University of California 
at  Berkeley  and  the  
telescope's  principal  
designer.  

The new telescope is four times the power of the Hale Telescope on Mount Palomar in Southern California, which has been astronomy's preeminent telescope, Nelson said. 
Computers will monitor the position of each segment of the mirror and control devices capable of nudging each segment as little as less than a millionth of an inch to keep the telescope in focus and compensate for distortion, Nelson said. 
The $94 million telescope was dedicated last November with half the mirrors in place. 
Nelson and project managers will test the telescope in coming months by using it to look for cosmological information no other telescope can provide. 

Reagan's secret service probe protest episode 
WASHINGTON (API -The Secret Service started an inter­nal investigation on Tuesday to determine how an anti-nuclear protester managed to get so close to former President Reagan on a Las Vegas stage. 
The agency was not anxious to talk about the Monday inci­dent. The protester rushed on to the stage where Reagan was speaking and smashed a glass statuette, showering the former president with glass. 
"We are reviewing the whole incident," said Bill Burch, a Secret Service spokesman. "We don't have an answer on how it happened." 
Burch said the service is talking with people involved in planning for Reagan's speech to the National Association of Broadcasters -both from the agency's standpoint and from the host committee's -and to people who were actually working during the incident. 
Reagan still gets Secret Service protection as do former presidents Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter. Richard Nixon gave up his federal bodyguards in 1985, saying it was no longer appropriate for taxpayers to bear the cost, $3 million that year. He hired private protec­tion. 
Among others accorded Secret Service protection are major candidates for president, some Cabinet officers, members of the president's family, and visiting heads of state. 
On Monday, according to ac­counts, people employed by a private security service col­lected admission tickets to the Reagan appearance, but they left as soon as the audience was in the hall. 
The protester, identified by authorities as Richard Springer, 41, of Arcata, Calif., walked unimpeded along the side of the room, up to the stage. He appeared to walk toward the back of the stage, veered left and rushed toward Reagan, smashing the statuette the former president had just received. 
Only then did three security agents come from each side of the stage. One group hustled Reagan off, the others tackled Springer, knocked him into the podium, and got him off on the other side. 
The plainclothed Secret Service agents have protected presidents since William McKinley's assassination in 1901. They only began shielding presidential candidates in 1968 after Robert Kennedy was murdered in Los Angeles. 

Iraq destroys five buildings at nuclear plant 
VIENNA, Austria (AP) -Iraq, acting under international supervision, destroyed five buildings and rendered a sixth harmless at the al-Atheer nu­clear complex outside Baghdad, 
U.N. officials said Tuesday. 
Iraqi teams also demolished 90 percent of the nuclear-re­lated equipment at the al­Atheer complex under supervi­sion of experts from the International Atomic Energy Agency, spokesman David Kyd reported from the agency's Vienna headquarters. 
"Four of five buildings were detonated with dynamite," said Kyd. "One building of the four took over one ton of dynamite to destroy. The fifth building was destroyed by cutting it at the level of the foundation." 
He said another building "was sealed off by pouring 400 cubic meters of concrete into it because it was too tough" to detonate. 
The agency last month ordered destruction of the al­Atheer complex on the Euphrates River 40 miles southwest of Baghdad, despite Iraqi statements that the facility served purely civilian purposes. 
Agency officials estimate Iraq was one to three years away from industrial-scale produc­tion of enriched uranium for nuclear bombs. 
The order to destroy al­Atheer marked another step in 
U.N. moves to get Baghdad to meet the terms of the Gulf War cease-fire by destroying its chemical weapons, ballistic missiles and nuclear facilities. 

Hundreds of Iraqis have been working under the U.N. team's supervision, Kyd said. 
"But many of them are un­happy at the site where they worked, seeing things go up in smoke," he said. 
Five or six agency inspectors were at the al-Atheer complex watching up to 1,000 Iraqis do the demolition work, Kyd said. The rest of the 26-man U.N. team was visiting 16 locations in Iraq. 
The inspectors were sched­uled to complete their mission to Iraq on Wednesday. 
Initial demolition efforts fo­cused on a large metallurgical building during the current visit. Most of the other buildings are much smaller. 
"Some of the bunkers used for explosives testing are made of one meter (yard) thick rein­forced concrete, and rather than demolish them, because this is impractical, we will fill them with concrete to render them harmless," Kyd said by telephone. 
"We also have demolished equipment -furnaces, ma­chine-tools and isostatic presses for shaping highly explosive charges for warheads -and about 90 percent of that work is finished," he said.

Accrediting agency allowed to keep evaluating colleges 

WASHINGTON (AP) Education Secretary Lamar Alexander said Tuesday he will renew the authority of an edu­cational accrediting agency that he earlier criticized for al­legedly discriminating against whites by requiring racial di­versity on campus. 
Alexander notified the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools that its Commission on Higher Education may continue to evaluate colleges for a four-year period, instead of the maximum five years. But he said officials must make annual reports on any negative evaluations based on the group's controversial "diversity standard." 
The National Advisory Committee on Accreditation and Institutional Eligibility had recommended in February that Alexander take the action. 
Leon Goldstein, commission chairman, said Alexander's ac­tion affirmed the group's "reputation for fairness and excellence in seeking to insure that our institutions provide the highest quality education possible for their students." 
"We continue to believe, as we've said all along, diversity is an appropriate standard for an accrediting body to have," said Robert Atwell, president of the American Council on Education, the umbrella group for colleges and universities. 

To be eligible for federal fi­nancial aid, colleges and uni­versities must be accredited by one of six regional accrediting agencies. Middle States oper­ates in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the VIrgin Islands. 
Accrediting agencies usually look at the number of books in the library, the degrees held by faculty members, laboratory equipment available to science students and similar factors in deciding whether a college should be accredited. 
But Middle States· added the diversity standard so that eval­uation teams could look at the racial and ethnic diversity of a college's faculty, student body and governing board; About two years ago, it used this standard to threaten to with­hold accreditation from Bernard Baruch College of the City University of New York and Westminster Theological Seminary in Philadelphia. Both institutions subsequently were accredited.

Helmsley will serve prison time 
NEW YORK (AP)-Former hotel queen Leona Helmsley said Tuesday she was prepared to serve the four-year prison term she received for tax eva­sion now that an appeals court upheld it. 
Mrs. Helmsley had been ordered to report on Wednesday -the deadline for filing federal income tax re­turns -to a federal prison hospital in Kentucky. 
"I accept the judgment, and I'm prepared to abide by the law," Mrs. Helmsley said. 
Earlier Tuesday, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals unan­imously rejected arguments from Mrs. Helmsley's lawyers that the sentence should be re­versed. 
The lawyers said the "dramatic change" in her health since she was sentenced in 1989 has made it a virtual life sentence. Her ailments in­clude hardening of the arteries and severe high blood pressure. 
"We're arguing not that the original sentence was wrong, but that circumstances have changed," said defense attor­ney Alan Dershowitz. He asked the appeals court to let Mrs. Helmsley do community service work instead of going to jail. 
But prosecutors argued that the 71-year-old hotel queen re­mains an active woman and let­ting her avoid prison would "make a mockery of the law." 
"The end has come," assis­tant U.S. attorney Mark Hellerer said. 
Defense lawyers said no time was set for her surrender. Convicts generally are required to report during regular busi­ness hours. They must arrange their own transportation to the prison. 
"Mrs. Helmsley is very upset, obviously, about the prospect of going to jail and she is coping," Dershowitz told reporters later. 
Mrs. Helmsley was convicted in 1989 of evading $1.7 million in taxes by billing personal ex­penses, such as renovations on a mansion in Greenwich, Conn., to companies the Helmsleys owned. 
A former housekeeper testi­fied that Mrs. Helmsley told her, "Only the little people pay taxes." Mrs. Helmsley denied saying that.

Alaska, Exxon settle dispute over oil royalties for millions 
Poverty reported rising among younger families 
WASIIfNGTON (AP) -The American dream may be vanishing for young families with children as they struggle to build a future and avoid the poverty becoming rampant among them, a Children's Defense Fund report said Tuesday. 
Families headed by someone under 30 saw their inflation­adjusted median income drop by 32 percent between 1973 and 1990, while poverty among this group soared from 20 per­cent to 40 pPrcent over the pe­riod, said the report. 
In comparison. median in­come dropped 6 percent for older families and rose 11 per­cent for families without chil­dren over the period, the report said. 
"The implicit message to many young Americans is frighteningly clear: Bearing and raising children may no longer be compatible with active pur­suit of the American dream." said the report. "No society can convey this message for long if it hopes to survive and pros­per." 
The report, "Vanishing Dreams: The Economic Plight of America's Young Families," says many young families have been stymied in their struggle to establish a career and get a foothold in the job and housing markets. 
But these families are vital to the future of the country, since most children spend at least part of their lives, and their most formative years, in a young family, the report said. 
Marian Edelman, president of the Children's Defense Fund, in a luncheon address at the National Press Club, said, "It's time for the president, Congress and more of our governors to be honest with the American people about the problems facing our economy and our poor families and stop picking on small children." 
The report called for President Bush and Congress to extend Medicaid coverage to all low-income children and preg­nant women and to boost an­nual spending for Head Start, the preschool education pro­gram for poor children, from $1.4 billion currently to $3.5 billion. 

Starving Sudanese radio for help; isolated by government offensive 
NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) -The people in Akobo, Sudan, iso­lated by a government offensive against Sudanese rebels, are starving to death and perplexed by the world's indifference, said radio messages from the town released Tuesday. 
"Twenty-three people starved yesterday," the Rev. John Chol said in a message to the Nairobi office of his church-led relief organization. 
"Everybody is weak and waiting to die. They look for wild fruits but it is finished. We have no cattle left. We ate all of them. We are hearing radio reports about U.N. and Red Cross helping Ethiopia and Somalia. Why not Akobo? 
"We don't know if we will be on radio next week. It depends on God's will. Although people are dying, we hope that some will remain," Chol said, finish­ing last Friday's message. 
Chol, a Sudanese Presbyterian minister, is the relief coordinator in Akobo for the Association of Christ-ian Resource Organizations Serving Sudan. 
The group runs church-oper· ated relief programs in rebel­held villages throughout south­ern Sudan and operates a radio network through churches there. Chol's plea was distributed to news agencies in Nairobi to publicize a disaster that threatens hundreds of thousands of people with starvation, but has failed to rouse world concern. 
In Akobo alone, more than 250 people starved to death in the past few weeks, said Bill Lowrey, an official of the asso­ciation in Nairobi. 
Most of the victims were chil­dren. 
Akobo has received no relief food since the beginning of March, when the government in Khartoum grounded relief flights to southern Sudan as it launched a major offensive against rebels who control most of the region. 
No locally grown food is available because of drought, war and lack of seeds. 
The situation repeats itself in town after town in Sudan's vast south. 
"The No. 1 thing to do now is to urge the government to al­low humanitarian flights so civilians are not starved to death for government policy," Lowrey said in an interview. 
Few roads run through the undeveloped region. Truck convoys of relief food can travel only during the latter stages of the dry season, leaving most of southern Sudan accessible only by air. 
"There is no hope for these people if there are no flighl'>," said Lowrey. 
About 45,000 people live in Akobo, including about 6,500 Sudanese who spent weeks with insufficient food trekking 100 miles there from Pochala, which fell to government forces last month. 
Akobo, 600 miles southeast of Khartoum, sits on the Akobo River, which marks Sudan's border with Ethiopia. 
The Sudan People's Liberation Army took up arms in 1983 against Sudan's Muslim-dominated government seeking greater autonomy for the predominantly Christian and animist south. 
JUNEAU. Alaska (AP) ­Exxon Corp. will pay the state of Alaska $128 million to settle a long standing lawsuit over back oil royalties and interest, lawyers for both sides an­nounced Tuesday. 
The settlenwnt, expected to be signed by Wednesday, came as jurors were being select~d !'or what was llXpected to be a six-month trial in state Superior Court. It ended a dispute that originally accused more than a dozen oil companies of undervaluing North Slope crude. 
Lava destroys houses outside Sicilian village 
ZAFFERANA InNEA, Sicily (AP) -Lava from Mount Etna flattened two deserted farm­houses Tuesday outside this village on the slopes of Europe's most active volcano. By evening, however. the lava front appeared to have slowed to a halt. 
"The situation appears now to be less dramatic," said Nicola Capria, the civil protec­tion minister. 
"But we must remember that . . . the monster is extremely strong." 
Civil defense officials said in­habited houses were not im­mediately threatened and de­layed evacuating any of the 7,000 villagers from the 10,500-foot-high volcano. 
Late Tuesday, military offi­cials blasted the lava with about 400 pounds of explo­sives. They said the explosion

smashed the side of a tunnel formed by lava that had fun­nelled the smoking black liquid toward the village. 
The soldiers conducted a similar blast a day earlier. That explosion apparently weakened the walls of a second lava tunnel, higher up 
on  the  mountain,  that  
collapsed Tuesday.  
Volcanologists  said  the  

stream then slowed, split into two branches and slowed to a virtual halt about a half-mile from the village after overflowing the 36-foot-high barrier built at the edge of town. 
Franco Barberi, a volcanolo· gist who has been supervising attempts to slow the lava's flow, said it was not certain the lava would reach Zafferana. 
Exxon and state attorneys informed Judge Walter Carpeneti-of the settlement. He said he would retain the jury in case the agreement falls through. 
The state originally sought $170 million from Exxon, but lowered the claim to $97 million late last yfiar after a judge ruled that the company could use its own figures to determine the cost of transporting the oil, said Wilson Condon, the state's lead lawyer. 
The state's royalty is deter­mined after deducting trans­portation costs from the oil's market price. 

The lawsuit covered 1977 to 1986, but the settlement will also cover royalty payments through 1991, and establish a new formula for future royalty payments, Condon said. The $128 million is to be paid in a lump sum by April 30. 
Negotiations over the formula prevented an earlier settlement, Attorney General Charles Cole said. 
After Tuesday's hearing, Cole said the imminent trial

The other companies that were named in the lawsuit had settled earlier, paying more than $500 million to the state, Deputy Attorney General Bruce Botelho said. Alaska originally alleged the companies short­changed the treasury by $902 million. 
The largest payment came in 1990 when Atlantic Hichfield Co. settled its $319 million claim for $287 million. Mobil Corp. recently settled its $20.4 million claim for $10 million, the state announced Monday.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 


Dear Editor: 
We, the Church of Loretto Renovation Committee, would !like to respond to the article published in the Inside Column of The Observer on Monday, March 30, entitled "Only we can save Church of Loretto." The article contained several inaccuracies. We would like to respond to the most serious: 
Inaccuracy #1: 
The renovation plans were made without consultation. Correction: From the beginning, the 
Church of Loretto Renovation Committee has been concerned about obtaining input regarding the renovation, particularly from the Sisters (to whom the Church belongs) and from those who regularly worship in the Church of Loretto. 
One of our first acts as a Committee was to send out a questionnaire to all Sisters to determine what was most im­portant to them in the current Church and what they would like to see changed. 
We have sent educational materials to all sisters to stimulate discussion in local communities about the renovation and invited their ideas and comments. Many letters were received from local communities and individual sisters. Their ideas were incorporated into the planning. 
We have had a series of edu­cational programs and open forums regarding the renova­tion for Sisters in the Michiana

Slf)? 
area and those who worship in the Church of Loretto. These programs occurred in Advent, 1990; Lent, 1991 and May­June, 1991. One of these was an open forum with the architects and our liturgical consultant. 
During the Sesquicentennial celebration of the Congregation in July, 1991, we had another open forum for all Sisters with the architect and liturgical consultant, at which time the initial renovation plans were dis­cussed. About 200 people at­tended. 
The Committee has also reached out to the Saint Mary's Community. Since September, written materials regarding the renovation have been available. In October, Sister Mary Turgi met with the Saint Mary's College Student Government to discuss the renovation plans. As a result of this meeting, an open forum for students was held in November, 1991. 
A second informational ses­sion for all members of the Saint Mary's College community was held in February. The purposes of these meetings were two-fold: to provide information about the reasons for the renovation and the details of the plan; and to respond to questions and concerns of the broader campus community. 
Involvement of the worship­ping community has been and continues to be very important. Most recently, those who worship in the Church of Loretto were asked to assist in the selection of chairs. In addition to consultation with the worship­ping community, the Committee has consulted with at least four liturgists and the diocesan Art and Environment 
1
Committee. 
Inaccuracy #2: The Bishop has formed a commission to study the renovation. 
Correction: 
The Diocese of Fort Wayne­South Bend has, as do most dioceses, a standing committee whose purpose is to advise parishes and other groups involved in church building or renovation projects. From the beginning of this project, this Art and Environment (A & E) Committee has known of the Congregation's desire to reno­vate the Church. 
There was dialogue with members of the A & E Committee before the Renovation Committee was formed in September, 1990. Once we had the architect's schematic design, we 

voluntarily submitted  our  
plans  for  its  advice  and  
reactions.  

The A & E Committee re­sponded that it was in support of our plan to renovate the Church and made several sug­gestions regarding details. All of these have been carefully considered and some adjust­ments have been made in re­sponse to their suggestions. 
The Renovation Committee is in continuing dialogue with the Diocesan Office of Worship and the A & E Committee. One of the A & E Committee members, Father Richard Conyers, provided a pre­renovation liturgical audit of the Church and conducted part of the educational programming regarding the renovation. 
Inaccuracy #3: Sister Mary Turgi is singlehandedly responsible for the renovation. 
Correction: 
Recommendations regarding the renovation have been made by the architect, Mr. Evans Woollen, the liturgical con§"ultant, Dr. .Marchita Mauck, and a 15-member Committee comprised of Sisters of the Holy Cross and lay persons, including faculty and administrative staff from Saint Mary's College. Final decisions have been made by the president of the Congregation, Sister M. Thomas More, CSC, and the General Council of the Congregation. 
Consultation and dialogue has continually shaped the Committee's recommendations and the General Council'.s decisions with regard to major concerns. Here are some examples: 
We will be retaining the ma­jority of the mosaic tiles. And, the architectural revisions will make them even more of a focal point than they are now. 
We will be preserving the painted glass window depicting the Annunciation, giving it a place of honor above the main entrance doors of the Church. 
We will be placing the statue of Mary in a prominent place in the narthex area of the Church. 
We are making every effort to carefully relocate the remaining statues, pews and painted glass windows. 
In our role as leaders and educators, we are responsible for making extremely difficult decisions. There are very real physical and liturgical problems with the existing Church that need to be addressed.

n recent years, the Center for Social Concerns has been the major provider of community and social 
service opportunities for Notre Dame Students. The Notre Dame Alumni Association has traditionally been involved in service, despite its image as a strictly social organization, according to Peter Pranica, director of alumni community service programs. 
The association is striving to update its image and to include service in its agenda, Pranica said. 
"There is a real perception problem on campus about the alumni clubs," Pranica said. "We want people to realize that we are not some football­watching, beer-drinking orga­nization." 
In the past, the Center for Social Concerns has made it possible for students to volunteer in low-income urban areas, to witness first-hand the injustice of hunger and poverty, and to travel to areas of the country which are hard-hit by economic injustice and disease. 
The Alumni Association would 
like to strive towards joining the 
Center for Social Concerns in its efforts of community and social service, Pranica said. 

There are 194 Notre Dame alumni clubs in the United States which are involved in approximately 125 service organizations, he said. In recent years, they have been involved with projects such as Christmas in April and have worked with poverty-stricken inner city school children. 
Through collaboration efforts, the Association hopes to merge its traditional ideals with the programs and actions of the Center. 
In an effort to change the Association's image, the Notre Dame Alumni Association has agreed to collaborate with the Center for Social Concerns in order to promote community service among alumni, Pranica said. 
The two organizations have teamed up and are meeting to plan ways to make social service a living reality for students both now and after graduation. 
The meeting is set up to show students that the opportunity to do public service work does not end when they leave the realm of the Center Social Concerns, according to Pranica. 
The alumni clubs around the country provide the same avenue for social service as the Center away from Notre Dame, he said. 
The Alumni Association will make a directory available which lists all the areas where an alumni club can be found and numbers that students or alumni can call to obtain information from each. There will also be an alumni board at the meeting to answer questions. 
The session is not just geared toward the seniors who are soon to become alumni, said Pranica. 
"It is open to everyone on this campus who is involved in community service," Pranica said. 
Undergraduates are encour­aged to use the alumni clubs over the summer and during breaks in order to stay involved with service to the community, Pranica said. 
There are other ways to get involved in community service away from Notre Dame, said Pranica. 
"If you were new and alone in a strange city, though," he said, "would you rather work with a bunch of strangers or a group of Notre Dame alumni?" 
There will be an informational meeting held in the C.S.C. on April 22 at 9 p.m. to outline the purpose of the alumni clubs in community service.

Eric Davis homer lifts Dodgers over Houston, 6-2 
NEW YORK (AP) -The Mets won their first home game of the season as Dave Gallagher's two-run double snapped a seventh-inning tie. 
The Mets lost their first four games at Shea Stadium, their worst start at home since 1962 when the club played at the Polo Grounds. 
After blowing a 4-0 lead, the Mets scored three runs in the seventh inning to snap a 5-5 tie. Gallagher had the key hit off loser Cliff Brantley (0-1) and Eddie Murray added an RBI double. 
John Franco (1-0), who pitched 1 2-3 innings of hitless relief, was the winner.

With student-athletes having to make up the difference be­tween the stipend and the rent of an off-campus place out of their own pockets, this could discourage many from pursuing the new option. What if a senior really wants to live off campus for whatever reasons, but cannot afford to make up the difference? 
Finally, why did the University wait so long to re­veal this option to next year's senior student-athletes? The plan is defin;tely a step in the right directi.....n. but I wonder if it is alreadv doomed to failure.

RICHFIELD. Ohio (AP)-The Chicago Bulls, playing without Michael Jordan for the third time in six years, suffered their worst loss of the season Tuesday night as the Cleveland Cavaliers beat them 115-100 behind Brad Daugherty's 21 points. 
Jordan stayed in Chicago be­cause of tendinitis in his left knee but was expected back for Friday's game at Atlanta. Jordan also missed a game Feb. 5 because of a suspension for bumping a referee, but he had sat out only one other game in the previous five years. 
The loss stopped Chicago's four-game winning streak. Cleveland, which beat the Bulls in Chicago once this season, had not beaten them at Richfield since April 16, 1989. 
Nets 1 05, Heat 1 00 
MIAMI -New Jersey, playing without top scorer Derrick Coleman down the stretch, outscored Miami 17-4 in the final 4:29 to beat the Heat 105-100 in a crucial game for both teams. 
Coleman had 24 points and 13 rebounds, but Nets coach Bill Fitch had him on the bench in the final minutes. Coleman was neither hurt nor in foul trouble. Miami's Glen Rice scored 36 points, but his team missed nine of its final 10 shots. 
New Jersey improved to 39­41, two games ahead of the Heat with two regular-season games remaining for both teams in the battle for a playoff spot in the Eastern Conference.

Knicks 93, Bullets 90 
NEW YORK -Patrick Ewing and John Starks woke up a slumbering New York offense in the fourth quarter, and the Knicks stayed in first place in the Atlantic Division with a victory over Washington. 
The Knicks, who got 11 points from Starks and 10 from Ewing in the final period, stayed one game in front of Boston in the division race with their second victory in six games. 
Ewing finished with 23 points and 21 rebounds and Starks scored 17 points for the Knicks, who had a five-game lead with eight games left. Ledell Eackles scored 17 of his 38 points in the fourth quarter for the Bullets, who have lost six straight games and 10 in a row on the road. 

Boston 99, Philadelphia 94 
PHILADELPHIA -Reggie Lewis scored 27 points,' including a crucial jump shot with 15.9 seconds left, as Boston eliminated Philadelphia from the playoffs for the first time since the 1987-88 season. 
Kevin McHale added 20 points and 12 rebounds for Boston, which won its sixth straight game. Hersey Hawkins had 20 points for the 76ers, who lost their fourth in a row and eighth in the last 10 games. 
Boston led 95-94 when Lewis hit his clutch shot.

that we can afford with the stipend are being taken." 
Under the arrangement, a student-athlete receiving full scholarship aid will continue to receive tuition and on-campus meals, and will be provided a University stipend to help de­fray the cost of off-campus rent. 
"Other schools do it much differently," Conboy explained. "UCLA, for example, gives stu­dent athletes one-tenth of its room and board total each month and tells them to find their own place. Schools which do it in that way (not UCLA) have run into trouble with the NCAA." 
According to the memo, the exact amount has not yet been determined by the University Accounting Office, but will be about $750 per semester, which will be paid directly to the landlords. According to Conboy, this figure will be determined by subtracting the cost of an on­campus room from the amount charged for room and board.

"Being around games I try to learn about everything on the field," said Mee, who mainly at third-base this season and whose steady .295 average now occupies the second spot in the order. 
As for a professional career, Mee says, "The coach handles that. We still have more than half the season left, so I'll just have to worry more about that."

they should give us enough to have a decent place to live," senior-to-be outside linebacker Karmeeleyah McGill commented. 
If rent exceeds this stipend, proof must be produced as to where the additional funds came from in order to avoid any NCAA violations. 
The additional rent will have to be paid by the players. 
"We are going to have. to pay money out of our own pockets," Ratigan said. 
"It is unfair not to get the full rent," Brooks added. "We are losing money on our scholar­ships." 
Partial scholarship aid will 

first be applied to tuition and board. 
The proposed residencies of the student-athletes must be approved by the Athletic Department. 
The NCAA prohibits athletic dormitories both on and off­campus. Therefore, a large group of student-athletes can­not legally be concentrated in a single location. The maximum number of people in a single residence will be four. 
The Athletic Department would also have a problem ap­proving student housing in neighborhoods that might pre­sent a threat to personal safety.

SMC tennis falters vs. Chicago State 
Special to the Observer 
The Saint Mary's tennis team ran into some trouble against Chicago State University yes­terday in a dual match in Chicago. The Lady Cougars (22­
1) won almost every match en route to the victory. 
"This was a very good Division I team and they played us well," said Saint Mary's coach Shelly Schultz. "But, we had a good win at number­three doubles." 
The number-three doubles teams provided only one of two wins for the Belles in the match. Thayma Darby and Shannon McGinn defeated Cynthia Pitts and Tiffany Brown, 7-5, 6-2. 
The only other Saint Mary's win came at number-six singles where Marisa Pflum bested Brown 6-1, 6-4. The rest of the singles' players ran into trouble at the match. 
At number-one singles, Ellen Mayer, ranked 35th in the na­tion, lost to Tytana Turner, 6-3, 6-3. In the number-two spot, Marie Koscielski was beaten, 6­0, 6-1, by Martha Gates. Belle Natalie Kloepfer fell to Crystal Embry, 6-1, 6-1 at third singles while Darby, 13-2 so far this year, defeated Angela Gibson at fourth singles. In fifth singles, Andrea Ayers lost to Cynthia Pitts, 6-2, 6-2. 
In doubles play, the Belles ran into just as much trouble. In the number-one spot, Mayer and Koscielski was downed, 6­1, 6-3 by Turner and Embry. At number-two doubles, the tan­dem of Kloepfer and Ayers fell 6-2, 6-1 to Gates and Gibson.

The Irish are more concerned with their own play, however, than with Michigan's depth. 
When everything comes to­gether, Notre Dame is a tough team to beat, but that has hap­pened only on rare occasions this season. 
One constant throughout all the ups and downs has been the play of junior Melissa Harris at number one singles and sophomore Lisa Tholen at number four singles. Harris has collected a team high 32 wins and Tholen has won 19 of her last 20 matches. 
The rest of the team has shown flashes of brilliance, but they haven't been able to put it all together against an oppo-

Cincy charity run to remember swimmers Beeler and Hipp 
By ANDREW ILIFF Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame family has opened its heart in support of the Colleen Hipp and Meghan Beeler Memorial Scholarship Fund through dorm and stu­dent government events, and over Easter, members of the extended Notre Dame family will have an unique chance to support the scholarship fund. 
On Saturday, April 18, the Notre Dame Club of Cincinnati will host the Athletes Memorial 5K Run, sponsored by Super X Drug Stores, CTI Telecommunications, and the Castellini Company, with the proceeds of the event divided equally between the scholarship fund and local Cincinnati charities. 
The run will feature 15 Cincinnati-area Olympians, 10 swimmers including 1968 Olympians Larry Barbiere, Ross Wales, and Jenny Kemp. Organizers hope to field a group of 250 -400 runners _in the event made possible through many corporate spon­sors in the South Bend and Cincinnati areas. 
Michael Roberts (ND '86-ND Law '90), a Cincinnati attorney, and head organizer of the run, wanted to support the scholar­ship fund with "something dif­ferent than the typical dinner," and he hopes that a 5K run can pull people out in support of the scholarship fund and local charities. 
"I wanted to do something active to help in a way that is fun for people to take part in," said Roberts. 
While attending Notre Dame as an undergraduate, Michael Roberts swam for the swim team, and as a law student at ND, he worked with the swim teams as an assistant coach. 
The event has generated ex­citement among the swimming teams; both coaches and as many as 12 swimmers plan to travel to Cincinnati in support of the event and the scholarship fund. 
For those interested in participating, the actual race will begin at 10 a.m., Saturday, at Ault Park in Cincinnati, with a $9.00 entry fee and T-shirts to all participants. The Rolfs Aquatic Center has registration forms available now, but run­ners do not have to pre-regis­ter. 
Special to the Observer 
Senior forward LaPhonso Ellis was honored as Notre Dame's most valuable player Tuesday night at the annual Notre Dame men's basketball banquet. 
That award, presented by the Notre Dame National Mono­gram Club, was one of five given out during the evening. All of the awards, except the student-athlete award, were voted on by the players. 
Ellis led Notre Dame to an 18­13 record and the finals of the National Invitation Tournament this season by averaging a team high 17.7 points and 11.7 rebounds. He finished his career eighth on the all-time scoring list with 1,505 points and third on the rebounding list with 1,07 5 boards. 
Ellis was ranked seventh in the nation in rebounding, ninth in field goal percentage and 17th in blocked shots in the final NCAA statistics. He was also voted to the NITs all­tournament team.

straight year. The 6-11, Pittsburgh, Pa., native averaged 
4.3 ppg. and 5.3 rpg. on the court while managing a 2.8 GPA as a psychology major in the College of Arts and Letters. 
Freshman forward Billy Taylor was named the Best Defensive Player on the '91-'92 team. The only non-senior on the starting lineup, Taylor guarded some of the nation's best players in first year coach John MacLeod's man-to-man defensive philosophy. 
His defensive assignment's included the likes of All­American's Harold Miner of USC, Bryant Stith of Virginia, Anthony Peeler of Missouri, Grant Hill of Duke, Malik Sealy of St. John's and Tracy Murray of UCLA. Taylor averaged 6.4 ppg. and 3.1 rpg. while averaging 30 minutes of playing time per game. 
Senior guard Elmer Bennett, an NIT all-tournament team pick, was the recipient of the Sparkplug Award. He averaged 
16.5 ppg. to compliment a 6.2 assists per game average. 
Bennett finished his career in impressive fashion by setting his career high with a 39-point effort in the finals of the NIT against Virginia. That was the most p51ints by a player in an NIT game in 13 years. Bennett, the Irish all-time leader in three-pointers and three-point attempts, came within one steal this year of tying the Irish single season record of 61. 
Senior guard Daimon Sweet was named the team's Most Improved Player. Sweet, who lost 25 pounds in the off season and made tremendous strides in his defensive game, was sec­ond on the team in scoring at 
16.8 ppg. He was also second on the squad with 59 assists all..d 42,-steals. 
Sweet made 37 three-pointers in 94 attempts (39.4 percent) in his senior season after never attempting a three-point shot in his first three years.

Kass is Michigan's only ranked player, while the Irish boast DiLucia, the fourth­ranked doubles team of DiLucia and Chuck Coleman, and 65th­ranked Andy Zurcher and 94th­ranked Will Forsyth at two and four-singles.

Even if the Wolverines can put it together this weekend, they should have a tough time due to the superior depth that the Irish displayed in their MCC victory last weekend. Despite resting their number-one sin­gles and number-one and two doubles teams, the Irish still swept all nine flights to win their fourth-straight champi­onship. 
At stake this weekend will be one of the Irish's preseason goals, an undefeated district record. Overall, the ninth­ranked Irish are 18-3. However, no Midwest team has been able to give the Irish any problems, but Michigan hopes to be the frrst.

Notre Dame softball blanks Valparaiso in 2 games

Wachter to lead SMC 
By JENNIFER GUSTAFSON Sports Writer 
After dropping two games on Monday, the Saint Mary's softball team hopes to turn it's luck around at the expense of the University of Chicago today. 
Last year, the Belles easily beat the Lady Marooners who finished 2-28 on the season. 
Sophomore outfielder Erin Wachter feels that the team should fare well against Chicago. 
"Our hitting's been on lately, and although our infield is young. they've been sticking together real well," Wachter said. 
Wachter believes that Monday's losses to Albion Collflge will serve as a learning experience in today's games. 
"We became aware of the mental errors, which played a big part in our losses and hopefully we can eliminate most of them," she said. 
The Belles will be turning to Wachter's leadership both on the field and at the Plate today. 
"I've been playing pretty well in the field. and I've been getting the bat on the ball lately, which feels good." She said. 
Hitting has been key for the Belles this season, as they boast several players batting over .300, including Wachter. 
dismal '7-23. 
Carrie Miller pitched the first of two Irish shutouts on the day, allowing only two singles and one walk while going the distance. Miller, a sophomore from, improved her record. 
Offensively, the Notre Dame should have called the first game "Christmas in April." In the second, the Crusaders gave the Irish all they would need. Pitcher Erin Reiter (3-10) hur­ried her throw to first on Lisa Miller's bunt. The wild throw bounded into the outfield, al­lowing the fleet-footed Miller to circle the bases.

In the seventh, the Crusaders' charity continued, as Notre Dame shortstop Ruth Kmak reached base on an error. The Irish co-captain then stole third and advanced to third on a groundout by Ronny Alvarez. The team's other co-captain, catcher Amy Folsom, then came through with a sacrifice fly to bring in the other unearned run. 
The Irish bats earned their way through the second con­test, blasting out 16 hits in all, as everyone stepped in to con­tribute. 
"We're swinging the bat a lot better since the weekend, and some new faces came in and did well at the plate," said Boulac. 
Freshman Andrea Keys, sub­bing behind the plate for Folsom, singled. Melissa Cook, in at third-base for Debbie Boulac, connected, as did Kmak, to make the score 1-0. 
The Irish opened it up in the fifth as a Keys' single up the middle scored Stephanie Pinter and Christy Connoyer. Cook, Kmak, Pinter and Connoyer also had RBI hits, to round out the frame with five runs on nine hits. 
In the seventh, Notre Dame tacked on four more runs to it a Iaugher. Keys, making the most of her start, knocked her third single of the game. Sherri Quinn tripled and Cook walked. 
Then freshman Liz Goetz de­livered a pinch-hit RBI single. Finally, with two out, speedster Amy Reuter beat out a bunt that scored Goetz and made the score 10-0. 
In the meantime, the Irish continued their domination on the mound. Stad Alford threw four inning of no-hit ball before surrendering a single in the fifth and giving way to Melissa Linn in the sixth. Alford recorded seven K's, and Linn added three more.

University policy could prove disappointing 
OfT-campus living is a privilege that has been denied varsity athletes on scholarship for a long time, but this year the University decided to try a plan for off-campus residentiality for senior student-athletes during the 1992-93 school year. 
Hequiring student-athletes to live on campus for four years is just another way that the University tries to exert control over its students, but the policy has been debated in recent years with the increasing appeal of ofT-campus living. 
It is about time that these student­athletes were given the same options that the rest of the student body has. These seniors who may live off-campus will have given four years of service to this school and they deserve the option. 
Unfortunately, the University has outlined a substantial list of rules and regulations that jeopardizes the viability of this policy. All the senior scholarship student-athletes received a memo from the Athletic Department earlier in the month outlining the guidelines. 
Once again it appears that Notre Dame has buried what seems to be a good and much nePded proposal under a mountain of red tape. Almost fwerything must be approved by various offices and departments. 
Just look at the process the first and, maybe last, class of senior student­athletes have to do in order to move ofT­campus. First, letters of permission are needed from guardians and coaches. Second. the soon-to-be seniors have until April 20 to submit an application. The letter detailing the new policy was dated April 3 and most likely the student­athletes received them a few days later. 
In the span of less than 17 days, the student-athletes must secure a house, apartment, condo, or other off-campus living arrangement. Is this enough tim~? If only a few student-athletes can find alternative housing before the April 20 deadline. will the University assume that there is not enough interest in the new policy and not continue ofTering the otT­campus option to senior student­athletes? And why did the Athletic Department wait until such a late date to inform the student-athletes of this policy change? For most student-athletes it is too late to secure adequate and appealing off-campus housing for next year. 
The next problem is this whole issue of the stipend which the Accounting Office is still calculating. With only four athletes allowed to live in a single residence, and the stipend not looking too substantial,

 
the question of the financial feasibility of the plan remains. Will financial matters prevent a significant number of student­athletes from taking advantage of this option?

doing so." After receiving these items, permission to move off­campus will be granted assuming the Athletic Department, in consultation with the Office of Academic Services, determines that such a move will not be detrimental to the scholastic well-being of the student­athlete. 
According to Kate Halischak, Director of Academic Services for Student-Athletes, students would be given permission by her office as long as the stu­dent-athlete is a "good student and making progress toward a degree." 
Also, a student-athlete who has had prior citizenship problems involving the Office of Student Affairs will likely not qualify to live ofT campus. 
"Each student-athlete will be handled as a individual case," Conboy commented. 
The student-athletes were told of this decision in a memorandum from Notre Dame Athletic Director Diek Rosenthal, which was dated April 3, and they have until April 20 to apply to move ofT­campus. After this date the student-athletes will be told if he or she will be permitted to move ofT-campus.

Irish tennis teams to meet UM 
Dilucia-Kass one to watch 
By JONATHAN JENSEN 
Sports Writer 
Another day, another test for 
the third-ranked collegiate tennis 
player in the nation, Notre Dame 
senior David DiLucia. 
When the Notre Dame men's 
tennis team, fresh off another 
Midwestern Collegiate Confer­
ence championship, heads to Ann 
Arbor to take on the Michigan 
Wolverines, all eyes will be on 
center court for the matchup 
between DiLucia and UM's 16th­
ranked David Kass. 
DiLucia took the weekend off 
after pushing a sore shoulder to 
the limit in a win over 19th­
ranked Dan Kronauge of Ball 
State and a loss to the fifth­
ranked team of Kronauge and 
Paul Kruse last Wednesday, so he 
should be rested up. Kass has 
had injury problems of his own 
that have kept him out of 
numerous matehes throughout 
the year. 
However, the two will be at full strength today and we should see a repeat of of their earlier mammoth showdowns. When they were sophomores, DiLucia escaped with a 6-4 win in the third set, and last year Kass pushed DiLucia to a third set again, only to fall 6-2.

Senior tri-captains offer strong leadership to Irish

Three's a crowd, unless you're going into battle. 

That's probably the way Irish baseball coach Pat Murphy felt when he assigned seniors Joe Binkiewicz, Craig Counsell and Cory Mee as this year's tri-captains. 
Under his regimen for their fourth season, the mature trio embodies Murphy's militaristic virtues of leadership, team-play and determination. Their role, then, is to bestow this attitude on other members of the team. 
If there's a veteran among Murphy's generals, it's Binkiewicz. He also served as the team's sole captain in his junior season. 
"I was greatly honored by it," he said. "It was something I wanted to do and I'm glad my teammates supported me and voted me captain and I enjoyed it." 
"Being a captain on this team, the coaeh always told us there were no extra duties," explained Binkiewicz. "The coach basically told us to be ourselves. We lead by example."

Women look for last win 
By JASON KELLY Sports Writer 

Today marks the end of a roller coaster ride for the Notre Dame women's tennis team. 
The Irish travel to Michigan this afternoon to close out a regular season full of ups and downs. 
After jumping out of the gates with a 3-1 record. they stumbled. losing seven of their next ten to fall to 6-8. They have hovered around the .500 mark since then, but they have not been able to surpass that all-important milestone. 
Today's match otTers the Irish (10-10) the opportunity to finish a rocky regular season on a winning note. 
But. Michigan will not go down without a fight. The Wolverines are not the most talented team on Notre Dame's schedule, but they probably carry the most depth, a factor that could play an important part in today's match. 
"Michigan is really deep," Irish coach Jay Louderback ex­plained. "They're not as good at the top as some of the teams we've faced, but there isn't much difference between their number one and number six players. They're as balanced as any team we'll play all season."
