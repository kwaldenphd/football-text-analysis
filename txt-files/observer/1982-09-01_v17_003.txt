with new club building 
By CINDY COLDIRON 
SeniorStaffReporter 
Expected to open around Septem­ber 9, the new Notre Dame Senior­Alumni Club should make "twice the profit as the former one did," stated Dean of Students James Roemer. 
The club, which is equipped with 
a smaller st~ is expected to have 
smaller operating expenses, said 
Roemer. "The additional revenues 
generated by the club will be used 
towards the upkeep and further im­
provement of the facility," said Roemer. 
The University is charging an an­nual rent of S53,000 on the new S650,000 structure, to the Senior­Alumni Club for use of the building. The former Senior-Alumni Club made a profit of Ht,OOO last year, stated Roemer. 

The new regulations will allow undergraduates to attend the club on Sunday nights, 7-10 p.m. where non-alcoholic drinks and pizza will be served. Uve music and dancing is also planned. 
Any undergraduate or non­student who attempts to enter the dub will be fined SIOO. "This money will go into a Senior-Alumni Bar fund for rennovations, etc.," said Roemer. 
Kevin Woods, the student general 
manager of the new club, had saved 
approximately 400 bricks from the 
former club, before 200 of them 
were stolen, commented Dean 
Roemer. Woods is expected to sell 
the remaining bricks to raise funds 
for the new club later on this semes­
ter. 
1982. Stepan is also a 1931 alumnus 
and emeritus trustee ofNotre Dame. 
Father Theodore Hesburgh, Presi­dent of Notre Dame, will bless the building and also speak. The ceremony also includes a perfor­mance of the Chicago Symphony String Quartet. 
Preceding this ceremony will be a 
mass at 10 a.m. in Sacred Heart 
Church with Hesburgh as celebrant 
and Father Joseph L. Walter, chair­
man ofthe Department ofPreprofes­
sional Studies, as homilist. 
All six honorary degree recipients. will be honored at an academic con­vocation in the Memorial Library Auditorium at 3 p.m. on October 2. Dr. D. Allan Bromley, one of the de­gree recipients, will deliver the con­vocation address. 
Bromley, chairman of the American Association for the Ad­vancement of Science (AAAS) and professor of Physics at Yale Univer­sity, is one of the world's leading physicists and and an international spokesman for science. 
A Canadian by birth, he studied at Queen's University, Ontario, and earned a Ph.D. in physics at the Uni­versity o Rochester, N.Y. Bromley joined the Yale faculty in 1960, was appointed director of the Univer­sity's A.W. Wright Nuclear Structure Laboratory in 1963, and chaired the Dept. of Physics from 1970-77. He was also appointed to the White House Science Council in 1982. 
Four others who will accompany Cronkite on the panel discussion, will join Bromley and Cronkite as honorary degree recipients. 
Congressman Don Fuqua, chair­man of the House Committee on Science and Technology, is one of these recipients. Fuqua, of Jackson­ville, Florida, attended the Univer­sity of Florida, was elected to Florida's legislature in 1957, and won a seat in Congress in 1962. He belongs to several scientific or­ganizations, including the American Astronautical Society, National Space Club, and the Special Cong..-es­sional Task Force of Industrial In­novation. 
John W. Hanley, chairman of the board of Monsanto Company, St. Louis, Mo. will also be a recipient. Hanley, of Parkersburg, West Vir­ginia, attended Penn State University and Harvard Business School, respectively, subsequently working for Procter & Gamble Co. He then assumed the position of vice presi­dent of Monsanto, where he rose to 
the position he holds today. Other associations range from former membership in the Stanford Research Institute Council to a cur­rent trusteeship of the National Humanities Center. 
Another recipient is Stuart A. Rice, dean of the Division of Physical Sciences at the University of Chicago sinceJuly, 1981. A physical chemist, Rice has spent virtually all his academic life at the University of 

Chicago except for visiting profes~· sorships and lectureships at at in­stitutions of higher learning all over the world, including Notre Dame. 
John B. Slaughter joins Cronkite, Hanley and Rice on the panel as an honorary degree recipienL Slaughter is director of the National Science Foundation and received his Ph.D. in electrical engineering from the University of California at San Diego. 
He has served as director of the Applied Physics Laboratory at the University of Washington at Seattle, assistant director for astronomical, atmosperic, earth and ocean sciences for the National Science Foundation, (NSF), academic vice president and provost at Washing­ton State University, Pullman, and was nominated for a six-year term as director of NSF by President Carter in 1980. Slaughter recently ac­cepted a position as chancellor of the University of Maryland, College Park. 
All activities, except for a lunch and dinner/reception will be open to the public. Also attending the dedication will be members o the University's Advisory Council for the College of Science, who will be on campus for their annual meeting. 
Richard Conklin, Director of In­formation Services, and a member of the dedication committee, com­mented on the choice ofCronkite as moderator of the panel and degree recipient. "Cronkite has been as­sociated with the coverage of the space program and host of "Universe". We were looking for someone the general public can relate to and who still has a scientific aspect to his career."

A novel facility 
If early reaction is any indication, the newly com­pleted Cushwa-I.eighton Library at Saint Mary's will be a 

success. Incorporated within the new structure are all 
the features that the former library lacked. 
Gone forever are the days of the largely ignored Alumnae Centennial Library -and for good reason. Cramped and antiquated, that Stru•:ture was hardly ac­ceptable as a modern educational facility. Thus, the most earnest of students often chose to study in their dorms, rather than competing for space or social stand­ing at the Notre Dame Memorial Library. 
The new library, designed by Evan Woollen As­sociates of Indianapolis, manages to combine its many redeeming functional features with a design that both highlights and complements the other buildings on campus -a feat that Notre Dame has failed to achieve in many ofits recent structures. 
Seven years and S7 million has produced a library with vast potential. With a seating capacity of 540, the Cushwa-Leighton features three floors plus two mez­zanine levels, housing more than 250,000 volumes and 775 bound periodicals. 
The added benefits give the impression that the 
designers went to enormous efforts to erase the image 
of the old library: massive 
floor space, modern living 

mere presence of another building on campus in terms ofSaint Mary's. The College has rea.l.ly stepped forward this time and achieved something worthy of its deter­mination to establish and maintain a separate identity from Notre Dame. 
But will the Cushwa-Leighton Library succeed? 
Saint Mary's Student Body President Kathleen Murphy feels that Cushwa-Leight:on is "such an im­provement that it is bound to be successful." Murphy does not foresee the new library turning into a sub­stitute social center, in the manner that Memorial is known. She thinks the design of the new library allows 
: plenty of study space but "hopes social areas do hap­pen." 
The success or failure of the nt:w library will lie ul­timately with the student body. For the first few weeks, undoubtedly, general interest will stem the traditional flow ofSaint Mary's students making the nightly trek to Notre Dame's Memorial Library, floor two. Indeed, quite a few curious Domers may find themselves cross­
.• ing the street to 'check out the new 'Brar.' In fact, the new library should a.id the long-standing room comfort (rocking

This phenomena ha.'> been largely the fault of Saint Mary's itself. A poor library and the lack of a student center held little allure for students of either sc:hool. But now Saint Mary's possesses a facility that, while not as large as Memorial Library, certainly surpasse:> it in terms ofstudy space and organization. The new library is an invaluable asset for students of both schools and should be utilized appropriately. 
The Cushwa-Leighton should not follow in Memorial's steps in becoming the latest wing in the Notre Dame/Saint Mary's social structure. Tht· new library has too much potential as a place of serious learning to be demeaned in such a manner. Let those

While it's true that classes have been dismissed for the dedication, this was not intended to give everyone a head start on Happy Hour. The completion of the new library is an important occasion at Saint Mary's. Tt:tis is a chance to overcome a sterotype ofapathy; to prove that Saint Mary's College is not "just an extension of Notre Dame." 
The library has been built; the rest is up to us.

American Studies names Max Lerner to chair 
Max Lerner, syndicated columnist and professor of human be­
havior at the United States International University in San Diego, has 
been named a visiting professor and the first occupant of the W. 
Harold and Martha Welsh Chair in American Studies at the Univer­
sity of Notre Dame, according to Timothy O'Meara, university 
provost. "The scope of Max Lerner's academic experience and the 
innovative nature of his scholarship amply qualify him for this new 
chair," O'Meara said. "His work blends the purposes of the mass 
media with those ofthe individual intellect." 
According to Donald P. Costello, chairman of Notre Dame's American Studies department, one of Lerner's courses in American Studies will be entitled "America as a Civilization: An Update," celebrating the 25th anniversary of the publication of Lerner's best known book, "America as a Civilization." The pUI:pose ofthe course, Costello said, is "to examine the American experience from the differing perspectives of 1957 and 1982." 
Born in Minsk, Russia, Lerner emigrated to this country with his family in 1907 at the age of five. He holds law and social science degrees from Yale University, Washington University, and the Robert Brooking Graduate School of Economics and Government. In addition to having taught at Harvard University, Sarah Lawrence College, Williams College, and Brandeis University, where he was the dean of the graduate school, he has been a radio commentator, an editor of the Encyclopedia of Social Sciences and editor of "The Nation." -The Observer

MEXICO CI1Y (AP)-Anger and uncertainty about Mexico's economic crisis swept through the capital on the eve of President Jose Lopez Portillo's final state of the na­tion address to Congress. . 
A 24-hour consumers' strike called by housewives to pro protest inflation was only partially effective. It followed a massive buying spree by panicky shoppers fearing food shortages and still-higher prices. 
The consumers' boycott was called for in unsigned leaflets that were distributed througout Mexico City during the past week. 
"Housewives, let us unite to protest the country's alarming situa­tion," the leaflets said. "Let us protest by not buying anything Aug. 31, trying also not to leave our homes .... Copy and distribute this leaflet as much as you can."

Mexicans revolt incapital city 
Many business and labor leaders expressed hope that Lopez Portillo's message at noon today would coun­ter some of the uncertainty and rumors sparked by Mexico's worst econmic situation since the 1910· 1920 revolution. 
Miguel de la Madrid, a 47-year-old Harvard-trained economist, will be installed as president Dec. 1 for a six· year term. The constitution bars a president from seeking a second term. Both Lopez Portillo and de la Madrid belong to the Institutional Revolutionary Party, which has been in power for 52 years. 
"Let's hope the president's sixth report on the government dipels the doubts and dis-information," Fer­nando Marina Janet, president ofthe Mexico City Chamber of Com· merce, told reporters. 
After four years of increasing prosperity, the bottom fell out ofthe economy as world market prices began dropping last fall for Mexico's main exports ofoil, silver and coffee. 
In recent weeks, the government asked for a 90-day postponement in payments on its $81 billion foreign debt -the highest among Third World nations -and again devalued the peso. 
It froze n 3 billion in dollar ac· counts with Mexican banks to kc~ep people from taking scarce dotlars out of the country and imposed ex­change controls. 
The peso, devalued twice this year, has fallen in value from 27 to more than 100 to the dollar. 111lfla· tion has zoomed beyond the 60 per­cent predicted for this year and unemployment continues to rise. 
Rumors, ranging from a possible coup to new economic restrictions, went their rounds Monday and hordes of shoppers rushed to stores Monday night to stock up on staples. 
Many gas stations in this city of 14 
million ran dry as motorists f.llled 
their tanks. Supermarket shdves 
were depleted of cooking oil, milk, 
tortillas, bread and coffee. 
Buying was so intense that some stores limited customers to one 2.2· pound bag ofsugar apiece. 
"We had to restock shelves six 
times, especially cooking oil," said 
an exhausted employee at De Todo, 
a discount market. 
"For the first time, Mexicans have stopped being apathetic," said AJma Escudero, 30, a housewife. 

Draft resister termed danger to America 
SAN DIEGO (AP) -Benjamin Sasway, convicted offailing to regis· ter for the draft, represents a danger "to the community, indeed the country," and should remain jailed, according to federal prosecutors who are trying to block his bid for temporary release. 
In seeking denial of bail for Sas· way, the U.S. attorney's office in San Diego on Monday compared the 21· year-old Vista man to drug traffick· 
ers  and  con-men  "who  have  not  
conformed  their  conduct  to  the  
dictates ofsociety."  

The government was responding to a motion, filed by Sasway's attor­ney, which asked the 9th U.S T. Circuit· 
Court of Appeals for temporary release on bail pending sentencing on Oct. 4. 
"It is difficult to imagine a more dangerous prospect for any com· munity," the government argued in a document signed by Robert D. Rose, assistant U.S. Attorney. 
Sasway, a political science and philosophy student, was found guilty Thursday of failing to register with the Selective Service System. 
U.S. District Judge Gordon Thompson ordered him immediate· ly jailed, citing concern that Sasway might flee to Canada. 
Sasway was the first man since the Vietnam War charged under the new registration rules and the second one convicted. A Virginia man, Enten Eller, was convicted 10 days before Sasway and given three years probation, on condition . he register. 
The government agreed with Thompson, arguing that Sru;way "represented a slight risk, that he would be undertaking a frivolous ap· peal, and that he posed a dangc~r to the community." 
"The danger of releasing the defendant is that he will encmuage others to follow his example in selecting the laws which he believes are worthy ofrespect," Rose added.

Win dogfight 
Israelis shoot do-wn MiG-25 jet 
The Observer 
SOUTH BEND, Ind (AP) -Most jury members believed that avowed racistJoseph Paul Franklin shot Ver­non Jordan, but acquitted him be­cause the government fuiled to prove its civil rights case, two jurors say. 
The jury on Aug. 1 7 acquitted Franklin, a drifter from Mobile, Ala, of federal charges that he violated Jordan's civil rights by shooting him. 
The two jurors were contacted Monday after U.S. District Judge Al­len Sharp modified his order barring anyone from talking with the jury. 
"I think most of us -our gut feeling -was that he did it," said one of the jurors, who asked to remain anonymous. "But we could not go by gut feeling.

Assistant Suffolk County District At­torney John Kiernan said it was im­practical in 1982 to try a case for a crime that occurred on Oct. 14, 1966. 
Reissfelder was convicted of first­degree murder and armed robbery in the payroll theft after witnesses identified him as being at the scene, at Boston's South Station. 
Reissfelder escaped from prison in 1977 and was found guilty of at­tempted murder in Florida before being returned to Massachusetts. He remains on probation in that crime.

The dogfight was the first since June 9, three days after Israel launched its invasion of Lebanon. In the June fighting Israeli warplanes shot down 83 Syrian jets over east­em Lebanon's Bekaa Valley and knocked out Syrian SAM missile sites. Despite withdrawal of the guerrillas and Syrian troops from Beirut, concentrations of Israeli and Syrian troops in the Bekaa Valley area still could touch off a new round offighting. 
In Tel Aviv the Israeli military command said its troops traded fire with Syrian or Palestinian guerrillas yesterday in Syrian-held areas about eight miles southeast of Lake Qaraaoun. The Israelis said the other side violated the cease-fire, but reported no casualties. 
The Syrian army completed a two­day withdrawal of its 3,200-man 85th Brigade from the Israeli­encircled Moslem half of Beirut yes­terday. 
Two Greek ships, the Paros and the Santorini, sailed for North Yemen, meanwhile, with 480 Palestine Liberation Organization guerrillas on each, PLO officers said.

Israel says by the end of the evacuation that about 15,000 PLO guerrillas, Syrians and Palestine Liberation Army members will have left Beirut, ringed since the first week ofthe Israeli invasion.

smerd's summer by Ted Ozark 

~eGo-Go's have done what Boston, The Knack, and ~ost groups 
.1 with successful debut albums could not do -they made a follow-up album that's even better than their highly successful premier. 
The trouble with a follow-up album is that artists have from nine months to one year to put together a better album than the one they just completed, one with the best songs they had ever written and performed on it. 
The Go-Go's first album, Beauty and The Beat, had a rough, raw sound that had an energy that crackled through the flaws. It is an al­bum that reflected the give and take offive musicians who really still did not have the "tightness" ofmost bands, a feeling ofexperimenta­tion and hesitation that overcomes the technical limitations ofthe group. 
With Vacation, the Go-Go's have given their prominent driving 
EdKontady  
record review·  
beat a smoothersound to pulse through, a studio sophistication that  
the debut did not have. --·  
What helped the Go-Go's was the late rise ofBeautyandThe Beat  
on the charts. Their proposed second album was postponed by a  
tour with the Police with a few tracks already completed.  
Formed in 1978 by Belinda Carlisle (lead vocals)andJane Wiedlin  
(rhythm guitars), the group played in Los Angeles nightclubs for a '.  
yearwith lead guitarist Charlotte Caffey. Drummer Gina Schock and  
bassist Kathy Valentine joined the group as they 5cored a record con­ 
tract with International Record Syndicate, a subsidary ofA&M  
Records, and released Beauty and The Beat.  
The five comely ladies returned as five musicianswith confidence in themselves that they did not have in the beginning.  i J  
They re-recorded the tracks, added the deft touches that give the  ...  
album a completed feel to it. The sparseness is still there, but there  
are splashes ofcolor to enliven the music, not a blank wall that  
dominates the landscape.  
The title track serves as the first cut and sets the tone which the  
rest ofthe album follows.  
Schock's drumming is mixed high and out front. The pounding  
rhythms move "Vacation" along its twangy guitar line out ofthe  
stereo and into popular radio. ·  
Carlisle's singing has never sounded so controlled. On "He's So  
Strange", her voice sounds strained, with ever-so-slight touches of  
vibrato, and meshes well with the pale harmonic choruses.  
Her vocals evoke a sense ofdesperation that slows to a melancho­ 
ly acceptance on "We Don't Get Along," a tune that pulses along  
with the Schock and Wiedlin rhythm section leading the way, and  
Caffey's burning guitar opening.  
The Go-Go's maturity since their first album shows especially in  
lyrics, interpretation, and music on three cuts. On "I Think It's Me,"  
the variance in styles is obvious from the girl groups ofthe 1960's  
and Phil Spector's wall ofsound to the Go-Go's sound ofthe 1980's  
and the up-front instrumentals.  
"It's Everything But Partytime" shows the group as it probably  
feels -reliefat achieving their goal, but not having the enjoyment  
they expected. The lyrics ("we're all looking for a good time/but  
what we get is empty rhyme/when everythingis right but nothing is  
fine/ it's everything but partytime") are made even more poignant  
by the vocal harmonizing and the music buildup at the end ofthe  
song.  
On "Girl of 100 Lists," Carlisle satirizes a middle-class girl whose  
life is held together by her lists instead ofwhat she lists.  
Three songs show the Go-Go's taking pre-tour material and get­ 
ting everything they can out ofthem. "Get Up and Go" is another  
"We Got The Beat" but with enough feeling to make it memorable:.  
"The WayYou Dance" lets Valentine put her bass upfront and she  
makes it sing out well, while Schock's drum fills rounding out the  
song.  
"Beatnik Beach" opens with Caffey's guitar and soars into a won­ 
derful parody ofthe 1960's generation ofbeach bums.  
Asax break highlights "This Old Feeling" with Carlisle givjng a  
solid vocal performance and excellent harmonies by the band.  
Even their new-found confidence could not save two songs,  
"World's Away," which is slowed down so much that it sounds  
forced, with Schock dying to tear loose at every moment, and "Cool  
Jerk," a popular concert song that loses it's spontaneity and vitality  
on vinyl.

Angelsacquire Johnfrom Yanks 

ANAHEIM, Calif (AP) -The California Angels announced last night that they have acquired pitcher Tommy John from the New York Yankees. 
California will send three minor league players, to be named later, to the Yankees for the left-handed pitcher. 
The 39-year-old John played seven seasons with the Los Angeles Dodgers prior to signing as a free agent with the Yankees after the 1978 season. He also pitched for the Chicago White Soxfrom 1965-1971. 
John had two 20-win seasons for theYankees,ashewent21-9in 1979 and 22-9 in 1980 before a 9-8 cam­paign last year. His best of seven seasons with the Dodgers was in 1977, when he was 20-7 with a 2.78 earned run average. 

Aleft-bander known for his slider, John is one of20 pitchers to be a 20­game winner in both leagues.

Ken Griffey gave the Yankees a 1-0 lead in the sixth with his 1Oth homer of the year, a 400-foot shot into the right field stands off Havens. 
The Twins came back to tie it in the bottom of the inning with four straight hits offGuidry. John Castino led offwith a single, went to third on a single by Tom Brunansky and scored on a single by Kent Hrbek. Gary Ward then loaded the bases with a bunt single, but Gary Gaetti hit into a double play to tak.e the pressure offGuidry. 
Sox 14,Indians 6 
CHICAGO (AP) -Harold Baines doubled in the tie-breaking run to launch an eight-run sixth inning in which Cleveland committed three errors last night as the Chicago White Sox rolled to a 14-6 victory, extending the Indians' losing streak to six. 
Braves 3,Phillies 0 
PHILADELPHIA (AP) -Tommy Boggs, pitching for the first time .since injuring his shoulder April 20, threw six shutout innings as the At­lanta Braves downed the Philadel­phia Phillies 3-0 last night. 
Boggs, 2-0, who suffered a slight tear in his shoulder in the spring, allowed three hits, struck out two and walked two. Reliever Gene Gar­ber completed the shutout to earn his 26th save. 
The Braves took a 1-0 lead in the fourth inningwithout benefit ofa hit against loser Ed Farmer, 2-5. 

Claudell Washington '3Ild Dale Murphy walked opened the fourth with walks. After Bob Homer popped out, Chris Chambliss reached first on a fielder's choice, Washington advancing to third and scoring as shortstop Ivan DeJesus threw wildly past first base for an er­ror.

14th-inning single  to  score  Dan  

Driessen from second base and lift the Cincinnati Reds to a 2-1 victory over the Montreal Expos last night. 
Driessen's single led off the 14th against Ray Burris, 4-14, the fifth Montreal pitcher. ­
Cesar Cedeno moved Driessen to second with a sacrifice bunt and Rafael Landestoy was intentionally walked. Householder foiled the strategy by lining a single to right.
