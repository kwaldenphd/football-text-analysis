Campus culture can be culprit for disorders 
Weight gain concerns may lead women, men to bulimia, anorexia, excessive exercising 
By AARON STEINER News Writer 
Last year, when an anorexic Brazilian supermodel died weighing 88 pounds and design­ers announced the creation of size 00 clothes for the thinnest customers, body image debates raged through the style capitals of the world. 
Notre Dame may be far removed from runways, but it hasn't escaped the same prob­lems that plague the fashion industry -and that's the reason behind Student Senate's "Eating Disorders and the Campus Culture" conference, which begins today. 
Disorders such as anorexia, bulimia, binge eating disorder and muscular dysmorphia are as prevalent at Notre Dame as at other college campuses -if not more so -due to a variety of factors within the University's environment, say University staff members and the conference's student organizers. 
Perfectionism and competition 
Student body president Lizzi Shappell said students in any top­20 university like Notre Dame are ambitious in the classroom ­and outside of it too. 
"It's a very competitive, perfec­tionist culture," Shappell said. "I think that combined with the pressures that most women and men, even, experience from the media-those two things togeth­er make the college campus a high pressure environment for keeping up that aura of perfec­
.
tion. " 
Notre Dame Food Services nutritionist Jocelyn Antonelli also stressed the dangers of perfec­tionism, which she said creates a proneness to eating disorders. 
"[Students] want perfection in every area -including how they look and how they eat," Antonelli said. 
Such perfectionism can foster eating disorders and body image issues, ranging from compulsive exercising and anorexia to binge­ing and purging meals, Shappell said.

While students are often looking for a reason to cut class, snow is not a viable excuse at Notre Dame. Within hours of any snow­fall -heavy or light ­walkways and roads on campus are cleared to make cross-campus travel as safe as possible for stu­dents. 
That snow doesn't clear itself, however. The work is done by Notre Dame's Landscape Services Department, which employs

Lack of realistic goals shocks, dissappoints 
I've come to the conclusion that no one on this campus knows just how impotent stu­dent government is. 
And yes, that's impotent, not impor­tant. 
Amanda Michaels

Perhaps "no one" is an Assistant News overstate­Editor ment. Because I certainly do, and I've heard enough people complaining about it to know that I'm not alone. 
But apparently, the candidates for student body president and vice president are clueless --or at least expect student voters to be.

"[Notre Dame] is really a pres­sure cooker for these disorders," she said. 
Valerie Staples, a counselor and eating disorders specialist at the University Counseling Center, said typical Notre Dame students "work hard and play hard." 
"Both can be positive. Both can be negative," she said. "Finding a balance is a challenge for many students. Many have excelled [in the past] and find it difficult when they aren't 'number one,' but one of many very successful stu­dents."

INSIDE COLUMN 


A -won1an' s scorn 
Dateline Italy -The land of pizza, Popes and pasta. Enter the latest, hottest political scandal. No, it's not about pregnant chads, a stained dress, or even a major political figure yelling "byaaaa" during a speech. 
John-Paul Witt
It's about honor, loyalty, and respect. I'm talking about, of News Wzre course, the scandal Editor involving the for­mer Prime Minister of Italy, Silvio Berlusconi, 70. It seems that he made a few comments, such as, to Miss Amazonia Aida Yespica, ''I'd go with you anywhere." And about a Member of Parliament of his own party, Mara Carfagna, "Take a look at her! I'd marry her if I weren't married already." 
If I weren't married already. He's married, of course, to the (beautiful, if I say so myselD former model and actress Veronica Berlusconi, 50. His wife of 27 years. 
To us Americans, this may not seem so bad. Admittedly, those old enough to remember the last 10 years have been desensitized to extramarital affairs in government. But it seems that, while that evokes a "boys will be boys" response from the electorate, the delib­erate, public, verbal besmirching of a woman's honor is intolerable. I mean, I didn't see any letters to the New York Times after the events of 1998. 
But Veronica returned fire: "These are affirmations that I see as damaging to my dignity, affirmations that ... can­not be reduced to jokes," she wrote in a letter to the La Repubblica newspaper. I am impressed. I applaud Veronica for having the courage to stand up for this affront to her self-respect. 
On the other hand, in 2002, while he was prime minister, Berlusconi said of the Danish Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen that Rasmussen was "the best-looking prime minister in Europe ... He's so good looking, I'm even think­ing of introducing him to my wife." 
He also said that he charmed the Finnish prime minister, a woman, into allowing the EU to build a facility in Italy by using "all my playboy tactics, even if they have not been used for some time." 
Between you and me, I think Veronica should've seen this coming. If Berlusconi wasn't using his A-game "playboy tactics" at home, he had no business using them abroad. You don't slack off during the year and work hard during summer vacation. 
Now Veronica has a tell-all book deal, for "Veronica's Tendency," and Don Silvio tendered an apology: "I was reluctant in private, because I am play­ful but also proud. Challenged in pub­lic, the temptation to give in [to you] is strong. And I can't resist." 
I think Veronica is great for standing up to this maltreatment. But a book deal? Skip that, and do things the American way: turn the name recogni­tion and publicity into a bid to become Italian's first female prime minister. At least then she could check out the other male prime ministers, instead of her husband.

Woman fakes heart attack, scares off intruder 
HAMPDEN, Maine-An 80-year-old Hampden woman who was watching the Super Bowl alone faked a heart attack to scare off a man who had broken into her home and was pushing her into the bedroom, police said. 
Daniel Thanem, 45, of Winterport was arrested a short time later and charged with aggravated criminal trespass and assault. Thanem is a convicted sex offender in Alabama, police said. 
The woman was watching Sunday night's Super Bowl when she spotted a man walking through her house, said Hampden police Sgt. Dan Stewart. When she asked the man what he was doing, he grabbed her from behind and began pushing her toward the bedroom. 
Stewart said the woman pretended she was having a heart attack and told the intruder her heart medication was in her car in the garage. After they retrieved the med­ication, the man fled.

STUDENT SENATE 
Fair Trade products urged 
Amnesty International seeks new campus-wide coffee campaign 
By KAITLYNN RIELY Associate News Editor 
Notre Dame Amnesty International president Gary Nijak took the podium at the SPnate meeting Wednesday to brief senators about progress made in the Fair Trade coffee campaign. 
On Oct. 4 Senate passed a res­olution calling for Fair Trade cof­fee to be exclusively offered in all non-franchised F.ood Services operations. This exclusivity has not been achieved. 
The campaign needs a new marketing strategy, Nijak said Wednesday. They are aiming for a "new attempt at marketing a social justice program rather than what has been happening on campus," he said. 
Nijak has met with Dean Carolyn Woo of the Mendoza College of Business and other people in the business school to discuss different ways to market. 
Amnesty International also discussed its marketing tech­niques with David Prentkowski, the director of Food Services. They talked about dearer label­ing of the Fair Trade coffee available at the dining halls, posting information at the sites about what Fair Trade means and possibly advertising for related lectures on the LCD screens in the dining halls. 
Nijak wants to branch the ini­tiative beyond just coffee and try to introduce Fair Trade choco­late to campus. 
"This isn't something that is limited to coffee," Nijak said. "This is a much larger idea." 
An Oct. 5 Observer article described Fair Trade pricing as a commitment to pay farmers $1.26 per pound of co{fee beans, which should be enough to sup­port a family. Fair Trade coffee allows farmers to sell beans directly to the roaster rather than go through millers, expqrters and importers. 
Amnesty International and other groups on campus have several events planned for later in the semester regarding the Fair Trade issue, including a showing of the movie "Black Gold" at the DeBartolo Performing Arts Center and a lecture. by theology professor Mary D'Angelo on Fair Trade and how it relates to teachings of the Catholic Social Tradition. 
The majority of Wednesday's meeting was spent discussing details regarding oversight in the student government -a topic that has been the subject of much debate in Senate and in the Council of Representatives over the past few weeks. The Senate first passed a resolution that allows the chairperson of the Senate to "waive committee assignment of any resolution, letter or order and hold immedi­ate consideration of it before the Senate in extraordinary circum­stances." 
This resolution allows all non­constitutional amendment<; to be passed through Senate more quickly should the need arise. 
After this resolution was passed, Senate Oversight com­mittee chair Chris Hollon brought up two more oversight issues for discussion. The sena­tors debated transferring the account nwnber for presidential programming from under the Student Union Board (SUB) to student government and also increasing the monetary limit an organization like SUB may spend before it must notice the Financial Management Board. Questions, discussions and debate continued for approxi­mately 30 minutes until Lyons senator Mariana Montes said the senators should delay debating the issue until a resolution has been written. 
In other Senate news: 
+ Faculty senate representa­tive Linda Sharp said the Faculty Senate discussed clarifying the honor code and developing definitive plans for crisis situa­tions in classrooms at Notre Dame at their meeting this week.

Saint Mary's Web site restructured, updated 
By ROHAN ANAND News Writer 
Visitors to Saint Mary's homepage might have been surprised at what they saw when they accessed the Web site after Jan. 12. -After nearly six years, the College's homepage unveiled its new look in early January -an initiative freshman Ashley Nealon deemed a "good public relations move." 
Keith Fowlkes, chief infor­mation officer at Saint Mary's, explained from a technological standpoint that a Content Management System (CMS). which allows for easier updating, more interactive features and the ability to share information amongst multiple. sites on campus, now drives the new system. 
"Basically, it's the newest, latest and greatest edition of software allowing us to keep up to date and manage all of the information on the Web site," he said. 
Fowlkes said the OIT sys­tem at Saint Mary's would no longer use an HTML editor for creating web pages. In addition, the internal Web site has new forums and dis­cussion centers which will allow visitors to partake in interactive surveys and polls. 
"The main purpose of our 
new design was to add a lit­tle bit more flexibility for our visitors," said Janet Flahaven, assistant director of web communications at' Saint Mary's. "Our old design, which hadn't been updated since 2001, was a little more static, but these changes will give us more 
freedom  to  move  things  
around  and  feature  new  
things."  

Flahaven also mentioned that feedback from faculty and students has been, on the whole, very positive. 
"People seem to appreciate the fact that the Web site is easier to navigate and oper­ate," she said. 
The tinkering, however, isn't quite yet finished. Employees at Saint Mary's office of information technol­ogy are still working on other projects to increase ease and convenience for students and faculty. 
"We still have some proj­ects with CMS that we'll be working on for the next few months, including chat serv­ices and blogs for admissions and alumni relations," Fowlkes said. "The software gives us so much levity in what we can do, and we're still trying to figure out what's best for the college and its outside constituents."

Fonner EPA head addresses environmental issues 
Whitman suggests increased federal action to cut back on emissions, served one term as first female governor of N.J. 
By JOHN TIERNEY News Writer 
While the environment is in better shape than it was 50· years ago, there is still work to be done, former Environment Protection Agency Administrator and one-time New Jersey Governor Christine Todd Whitman said Wednesday during her "Shaping the Future: America's Environment Today" lecture. 
Whitman, a Hepublican who served for two years in he Bush White House, stressed the importance of market­based solutions to the environ­mental crises of greenhouse gas and fossil fuel emissions. 
"What is good environmental stewardship is also good for business," she said. "We don't have to make a choice between having a healthy environment and a thriving economy." 
Although the modern envi­ronmental movement began in the 1970s with the federal government mandating stricter emission standards against the wishes of business leaders, the roles have changed. 
"Today, the responsible lead­ers of American businesses are objecting that the federal government is not taking mandatory actions," she said. "It's a natural progress in most responsible leaders that they are more concerned with the environment." 
While the Bush administra­tion has enacted voluntary environmental reform pro­grams, Whitman said these initiatives do not go far enough to help cure the chal­lenges the world faces. 
Although she hailed volun­tary governmental programs such as Energy Star and Climate Leaders, Whitman said more federal action is essential. 
"A mandatory carbon cap is necessary and probable within the next five years," she said. 
Whitman advocated a solu­tion to the environmental cri­sis that requires businesses to meet certain standards, but allows them to meet these standards in a way that is profitable to the company. As part of this so-called "cap­and-trade" system -similar to the system employed to reduce acid rain -the gov­ernment would set target to be reached, but companies have to decide how to reach them in accord with their own best interests. 
When companies are unable to reach the mandatory tar­gets, they are able to buy emission capabilities from companies that have not sur­passed the regulations. The cap-and-trade system is most effective because "the govern­mont is not innovativn, but the privatn sector is," Whitman said. 
Whitman said environmental responsibility will not limit oconomie and industrial growth. 
"Businesses ean· protect the environment in a way that enhances their bottom line and doesn't limit their growth," she said. 
"Wn need to makn it. prof'­itabln for businesses to do the right thing for the environ­ment. I don't earn about their motives if' they're doing the right thing," Whitman said. 
Whitman said the White llouse did not manipulate cli­mate ehange seientif'ic evi­dence during hnr two years at the EPA, but she believes that policy dictates the n~sults of scientific investigation at the federal level. 
"When the science goes against what certain people want, it just gets dropped from the report," she said. 
"The policy doesn't always have to be based on just the science, but they need to let the science be the science." 
In her fight for environmen­tal responsibility, Whitman said she does not hold others to a higher standard than she holds herself. The former gov­ernor drives a Toyota Prius, which -according to Car and Driver Magazine-averages 60 miles per gallon in the city. 

"I love my Prius, but we're not going to change what cars people drive right away," she said. 
Whitman served as the fifti­eth and first female governor of New Jersey from 1994 to 2001. She left the governor­ship to become administrator of the EPA during the Bush administration in January of 2001 -a post she held until June of 2003. 
Whitman also serves as the president of The Whitman Strategy Group, a consulting firm specializing in the envi­ronment and governmental bipartisanship. She is also the leader of the It's My Party Too political action committee, which works to elect moderate Hepublican candidates.

Lebanese, Israelis exchange fire 
JERUSALEM -Fighting broke out between Israeli and Lebanese soldiers Wednesday night as Israel searched for Hezbollah bombs along the frontier between the two countries, officials from both sides said. 
Lebanese soldiers opened fire and Israeli troops responded with tanks and light weapons, Israeli security officials said on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media. 
Lebanese military officials said their troops opened fire with machine guns on a bulldozer after the vehicle crossed the so­called Blue Line-the U.N.-demarcated boundary -and entered about 20 yards into Lebanon. 
Prehistoric remains found hugging 
HOME -They died young and, by the looks of it, in love. Two 5,000-year-old skeletons found locked in an embrace near the city where Shakespeare set the star­crossed tale "Romeo and Juliet" have sparked theories the remains of a far more ancient love story have been found. 
Archaeologists unearthed the skeletons dating back to the late Neolithic period out­side Mantua, 25 miles south of Verona, the city of Shakespeare's story of doomed love. 
Buried between 5,000 and 6,000 years ago, the prehistoric pair are believed to have been a man and a woman and are thought to have died young, because their teeth were found intact, said Elena Menotti, the archaeologist who led the dig. 
"As far as we know. it's unique," Menotti told The Associated Press by telephone from Milan. "Double burials from the Neolithic are unheard of, and these are even hugging."

Air Force cadets caught cheating 
AIR FORCE ACADEMY-Nineteen fresh­man cadets at the Air Force Academy have admitted cheating on a test of general knowl­edge about their branch of the military, and nine others are under investigation, the school said Wednesday. 
The cadets admitted obtaining answers to a test and forwarding them through an Internet social group and private computer messages. 
Academy spokesman Johnny Whitaker said the test was part of a weekly series of exams that covered everything from quotes by famous military leaders to current events. The tests do not affect cadets' grade-point averages, but they must pass to advance to the second year. 
Of 28 students caught up in the probe, 19 are athletes, but the school declined to identi­fy their teams, citing privacy issues.

crowd contributes to the develop­ment of eating disorders, she said. 
Disordered eating and exercising 
Junior Ashley Weiss, chair of the Student Senate Gender Issues committee, and graduate student and co-conference coordinator Ali Wishon said they believe eating disorders are more common across Notre Dame's campus than people realize -or are willing to accept. 
"It's something that you wake up and see everyday," Weiss said. "You see the girls that wake up and go running every morning or the guys that are constantly at the gym -and then at the dining halls, you can see the health food craze," she said. "None of [these things] are bad, but just taken to the extreme." 
Shappell agreed, saying she knew a substantial number of peo­ple in high school and at Notre Dame affiicted with eating disor­ders. 
"I think that body image is something that nearly every young woman has struggled with, at least at some point in time," she said. 
At Notre Dame, Antonelli said she thinks eating disorders often stem from dieting or restrictive eating habits. Whether a student stops snacking, skips meals or eliminates carbohydrates, these habits -often paved with good intentions -can lead to disorders, she said. 
Overall, students seem to put great emphasis on eating and stay­ing healthy, but in some cases stu­dents become so food-conscious they are anxious about eating, she added. 
"Some people are so concerned about the 'freshman 15,"' Antonelli said. "This summer I had several students call before school started, stating they were anxious about [gaining weight]. That's never happened before." 
Antonelli said she regularly sees students for nutritional counseling. lf she believes a student is suffer­ing from an eating disorder, she will refer the student to the Counseling Center, she said. 
In addition to problems with food, obsessive or compulsive exercising may also become an issue for those struggling with body image disorders. 
With a high percentage of for­mer varsity athletes comprising the Notre Dame student body, "our campus is extremely athletic," Shappell said. Such athleticism can place too much attention on staying fit and looking good, she said. 
Notre Dame RecSports co-direc­tor Sally Derengoski said while RecSports provides services to stu­dents that promote healthy exer­cising habits -including the new personal training program -staff members see some students "take it to the extreme." 
"The great majority of students who come to play or work out are doing so within a range that is helpful and healthy," Derengoski said. "Do we see cases that exceed that range? Certainly, and in those cases we work with the Counseling Center and the Office of Student Affairs to best provide for the stu­dent." 
However, a person doesn't have to exercise excessively long or hard to be suffering from an eating disorder, Staples said. 
"Even a reasonable amount of exercise could be questionable when the individual does so for the sole purpose of burning calories or reshaping their body rather than to be healthy or reduce stress," Staples said. 
Staples also mentioned hinging and purging-two behaviors conducted much more secretively, 
Male body image: an overlooked issue 
While research and media cov­erage have highlighted the prob­lems of eating disorders among women, men are not exempt from eating disorders or image issues, WIShon said. 
"That's absolutely not true," she said. "The current statistic is that 10 million women and one million men are suffering in the U.S." 
The conference's keynote speak­er, Dr. Hoberto Olivardia, a Harvard Medical School scholar, will specifically address the male body image issue, she said. 
"There's really no name for it," she said. "Men don't know what to say when they are compulsively exercising, lifting weights so much Dame students who exercise to a certain extent have attracted attention. 
"We have had incidents with both males and females where concern has been expressed, either by a patron or staff," she said. 
Staples said the athletic culture at Notre Dame eould also be a con­tributing factor behind these disor­ders. 
"Certainly athletidsm is a piece of what drives this," she said. "Men tend to increase exercise and working out as a way to reshape their body rather than by dieting a_<; women do." 
While the Counseling Center sees only "a few" men eaeh year with eating disorder issues, that Staples said. 
"Men are not immune to the cul­tural focus on appearance, but often find it more difficult to acknowledge a problem for fear of being seen as having a woman's problem," she said. 
Counseling Center services in place 
While eonl'erence organizers hope the event creates awareness of and dialogue about eating disor­ders, the Counseling Center already has a variety of services to help students struggling with dis­orders, Staples said. Options inc.lude individual or group coun­seling sessions. 
"The approach to treatment is comprehensive and involves stu-
The Counseling Center also con­sults family, friends and faculty members to detect potential vic­tims of food or body image disor­ders, Staples said. 
Students can call to schedule an appointment or contact health services. Wherever they feel most comf()rtable starting, they "will be put in touch with the other aspects of the treatment team," Staples said. 
Staples said that an estimated 13 to 15 percent of the students who come to the Counseling Center each year seek counseling for eat­ing, weight or body image con­cerns.

IN BRIEF 
Apple CEO Jobs hits at RIAA 
LOS ANGELES -Apple Inc. CEO Steve Jobs challenged major record labels to strip copying restrictions from music sold online, but their trade group fired back Wednesday, suggesting the company should open up its anti-piracy technology to rivals instead. 
Doing so, argued Mitch Bainwol, chair­man and chief executive of the Recording Industry Association of America, would eliminate technology hurdles that prevent music fans from buying songs at Apple's iTunes Music Store and playing them on devices other than the iPod. 
"We have no doubt that a technology company as sophisticated and smart as Apple could work with the music commu­nity to make that happen," Bainwol said in a statement. 
In an essay posted on the Cupertino­based company's Web site Tuesday, Jobs called on record labels to abandon their requirement for online music to be wrapped in Digital Rights Management, or OHM, technology that prevents unautho­rized copying. 
The OHM protections prevent the iPod from playing music bought from many other competing online stores. 
Shareholders approve buyout offer 
CHICAGO -Equity Office Properties Trust shareholders overwhelmingly approved a $23 billion all-cash buyout offer Wednesday from private equity firm Blackstone Group, sealing the deal on an acquisition that ended with a down-to-the­wire bidding war. 
Company officials, who favored Blackstone's $55.50 per share proposal over a rival bid of cash and stock from suitor Vornado Healty Trust, said the acquisition will be completed Friday. 
They said more than 92 percent of bal­lots cast during the vote supported the acquisition. 
The Blackstone deal had the support of Equity Office trustees, even though it was less than the $56 per share in cash and shares offered by Paramus, N.J.-based Vornado.

BRUSSELS The

Lawmakers grab third rail in capital 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -Back-channel efforts by the White House and Capitol Hill Democrats to begin trying to negotiate a solution to the fiscal prob­lems of Social Security and other fed­eral benefit programs appeared to collapse Wednesday. 
At issue is a little-publicized attempt by the White House and members of Congress to set up a working group of lawmakers and top administration officials to fortify benefit programs like Social Security and Medicare for the severe future fiscal challenges due to the looming retirement of the Baby Boom generation. Three-fourths of the group, evenly split between Democrats and Republicans, would have had to agree on any solution. 
But Senate Budget Committee Chairman Kent Conrad, D-N.D., 

accused the White House of acting in bad faith at a panel hearing that turned acrimonious over White House Budget Director Rob Portman's unwillingness to acknowledge that tax increases should be part of any fix for the long-term problems of the huge federal benefit programs. 
"We have an opportunity here to work together, but the only way I know in human relations for there to be resolution between parties who have different views is for both sides to compromise," Conrad said. "Unfortunately I see virtually none on your side. And I regret that more than I can say." 
Conrad then gaveled the hearing to an end and immediately left. 
Portman says the administration is willing to come to the negotiating table with no preconditions -a change from the stance President Bush took two years ago, when he ruled out hikes in Social Security pay­roll taxes. But Portman told reporters, "The first step shouldn't prejudge where we end up." 
The idea of establishing the negoti­ating group had come close to fruition, Conrad said in an interview Saturday, but Vice President Dick Cheney set talks back last month after saying in a Fox News Sunday inter­view that the administration contin­ues to oppose payroll tax hikes as part of a broader Social Security solution. 
The panel was likely to have first focused on Social Security. 
The Senate Budget Committee's top Republican, Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, said House Democrats opposed the idea. 
"People on the other side are more interested in the next election than the next generation," Gregg said.

Snow 
continued from page 1 
30 people who work three different shifts for campus snow removal, said Bill Thistlethwaite, superin­tendent of landscape servic­es. 
Three employees work from 2 a.m. to 10 a.m., using any of the depart­ment's four brooms, three Bobcat machines with buck­ets, three pick-up trucks with plows, four small dump trucks with plows and three big dump trucks with plows, Thistlethwaite said. 
Four employees work from 
3:30 p.m. until 11:30 p.m., and if snowfall isn't too heavy, Thistlethwaite said the department operates on a third shift from 7:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. During that 

Debate 
continued from page 1 
The candidates brought differ­ent experiences and perspec­tives to the table, beginning with Brown and Braun's extensive involvement in student govern­ment. Collectively they have served on seven of the nine stu­dent senate committees. 
Fellow contenders Rivera and Kane, members of ROTC, offered their military leadership experi­ence, while Smith and Weiss highlighted their across-the­board participation in student government. 
Coggon and Padberg used comedy to compensate for their lack of involvement in student councils. 
"We're the only men on the ticket and therefore morally superior to others," Coggon quipped in his opening state­ment. 
Smith and Weiss emphasized their "technology initiatives" as the heart of their campaign, pre­senting proposals to make the purchase of football tickers available online and the use of Domer Dollars in the Notre Dame Stadium possible. The pair also proposed an alliance with Ruckus Network, Inc. to "provide a free and safe alterna­tive to downloading music," Smith said. 
Brown, however, had doubts concerning Ruckus' ability to provide a complete music expe­rience. "Unfortunately we came up with some concerns through OIT.... There's too many person­al security issues going on there [and] incompatibility with Macs and iPods," she said. 
Smith contended there was "absolutely no problem concern­ing security," though he admit­ted iPod compatibility "is an issue." 
Brown and Braun shared sev­eral proposals for the enrich­ment of campus life, including a guest meal exchange plan that would "let you take one of your unused meals and turn it into a voucher allowing your guests to save fifteen dollars," Braun said. The all-female ticket also pro­posed a free shuttle to the South Bend Airport, as well as making Martin Luther King Jr. Day a University-recognized holiday. 
For Rivera and Kane, having free tutoring available to all grade levels was a main priority, as well as allowing ID cards from other dorms to work on side doors. He also mentioned discussions with Chipotle about opening a restaurant on cam­pus. Though the Rivera-Kane 

There are always excep­tions, though. Precautions are taken for every scenario as soon as flurries begin. 
When there's more than two inches of snow, Thistlethwaite said, addi­tional people join the sec­ond shift, which then runs an extra four hours to end at 2 p.m. 
The current bitterly cold temperatures only compli­cate the matter. When the thermometer drops below zero and snow falls during the day, the removal process slows down. 
In subzero temperatures, chemicals used to remove the snow and break down ice are less efficient than in warmer weather, Thistlethwaite said. 
"When the temperatures are in the twenties, we can 
ticket has no student govern­ment experience, "we both have experience in leader.ship posi­tions," Kane said, noting that ROTC people can "get things done." 
The most unorthodox ideas came from Coggon and Padberg, who proposed a five-year plan to make two separate campuses for men and women. Under this proposal, "women will not be allowed within five hundred yards of men's dorms [and vice versa]" Coggon said. In addition, Coggon proposed " a wall on South Quad to block the wind," separate lanes on sidewalks for slow walkers, fast walkers and bicycles, and "implementing a squirrel season here so that squirrels may be harvested via slingshot." Padberg had little to say other than the word "havoc," and provided a musical compliment to Coggon's propos­als with makeshift instruments. 
In terms of communication with constituents, each ticket had its own ideas. Rivera and Kane proposed more informa­tion in The Observer, Brown and Braun suggested online student government applications and forums, Smith and Weiss wanted to reach out to off-campus stu­dents and provide a MAC net­work, and Coggon and Padberg said that they would communi­cate via "message in a bottle," allowing for "divine intervention as to which suggestions we are able to get," Coggon said. 
In their closing statements, each ticket reinforced their com­mitment and desire to lead the student body next year. 
"We think we can bring a lot to the table even though we're lacking in student government per se experience," Kane said. 
Weiss quoted a Volkswagen commercial. 
"In life there are passengers and drivers," she said. "Danny and I are drivers and we look forward to driving you into the future of Notre Dame." 
Braun emphasized the passion she and Brown share for student government. 
"Liz and I love this place," Braun said. "We want to make it better, we want to leave it better, and we're doing it for you guys. It's not for us." 
"Drawing on our experience we know what's possible and what's not," Brown added. 
Coggon said that "as candi­dates, we feel that we are those who are most well qualified." Padberg changed his one-word answer of "havoc" to "blarg" for his part in the closing statement.

the end of the day," he said. 
When snow falls at a rate of over two inches an hour during the daytime, the removal process becomes more cumbersome. But areas of campus that 
require  snow  removal  are  
prioritized  to  make  the  
process more efficient.  

"The walks and the roads are the top priority," Thistlethwaite said. "But along with that are the parking plaees for faculty, starr and commuting stu­dents." 
Although Thistlethwaite realizes that it may irritate students, student parking lots are the lowest priority for snow removal, he said. 
Thistlethwaite said work­ers plow the student lots last because most of the cars are already thern and 
Landscape Services does the best they can to clear parking lots, they do not intend block people from their cars, he said. 
"Contrary to popular belief, we don't really try to plow people in. That's not our goal," Thistlethwaite said. "Sometimes this is just something that happens when ears are left in lots that need to be plowed." 
Landscape Services is also trying to cut the use of salt by using other compounds, he said. 
"We like to think we're one of the leaders in using the environmentally friend­ly chemjeals," Thistlethwaite said. "These chemicals are byproducts of ethanol that are not corro­sive and do not harm plant life." 
each year, its use has been greatly reduced at Notre Dame. 
"We still use salt because we have to, but over the last six or seven years, we have cut our salt use by about 40 percent and [we] still keep our roads better than everybody else in the area," Thistlethwaite said. 
Since shifts are long and weather conditions harsh, those operating snow removal equipment need to stay focused. 
"It's very mentally tax­ing," Thistlethwaite said. "You have to stay alert all the time. When you work long hours and you can't see because of the snow, things can get hairy."

It was at that point that I choked on my Coke Zero. 

Given, he admitted that he wasn't sure how much he could do to affect it, which at least showed he wasn't delu­sional. Smith did guarantee, however, that he would bring it up during the student gov­ernment's seasonal presenta­tion to the Board of Trustees and ask them to work to find a solution. 
Let's all just take a moment and imagine the faces of some of the wealthiest and most influential men and women in the country as they're being asked to let the University take a hit in earn­ings and national competi­tiveness -just as it's gearing up to make its name as a "research university"? 
Yeah, it makes me smile too. 

I'm going to leave the Rivera-Kane and Coggon­Padberg tickets alone. The former is young and, as is obvious from Kane's com­ment to The Observer on Feb. 2 stating that her experience in high school student gov­ernment is sufficient because "school government is the same anywhere," they 
haven't fig­

Colu01n

At last night's uninspiring and uninspired debat11, I was struck by how ridieulous many of the tickets' primary platform pieces are. Garrett 
Coggon and Mike Padberg notwithstand­ing-they were ridicu­lous in the best sense of the word -all the tickets were foolishly opti­mistic about what they could accom­plish at the helm of stu­dent govern­ment. 
Maris Braun -vice presi­dential candi­

date to Liz Brown -stood up during her ticket's opening statement and deelared that she and Brown's approach was totally innovative and totally new. She looked into the crowd and said we could raise our expectations and not be disappointed. 
And then she and Brown unveiled their plan for the Guest Meal Exchange Program, which would allow students to convert their unused meals into vouchers to use when friends or family came to visit. 
Sure, it's a great idea. It's incredibly frustrating that the University fleeces students and their families over dining hall food. But Food Sorvices is notoriously reluctant to go along with policies that could lose it money. 
It took two yoars of work by former senator (and presi­dential candidate) .!amos Loito to get laundry eosts dropped by 25 cents for everyone who used Domer Dollars to pay for their wash­ing and drying. Leito's origi­nal intention, of course, was to drop prices for everyone, but who would want that? 
When eurrent student body president Lizzi Shappnll worked to get more food options in Grab 'n Go, we got cups of ramen, popcorn and snack packs. I'm pretty sure you can get all over those for less than 11fty cents at Meijer. 
Food Services won't even release its annual budget ­and I've seen student govern­ment ask for it all four years I've been here. 
Brown said she was already in talks with the head of Food Services, Dave Prentkowski. Talk is good, but it is also cheap for the University. I'd be absolutely shocked if we saw any action on it. I'd also be shocked if we ever saw that budget-which is where

If students want it, they can go to ruekus.eom now and sign up. The only thing they'll miss out on is movies and TV. So why is this Smith­Weiss' primary campaign point? Is there something more to this that I'm missing?

Jamieson then took the stage and immediately grabbed the audience's attention by tack­ling her grave subject material with an interactive approach. 
"Why don't we co-create this lecture?" she asked. 
Jamieson referenced Aristotle's theories on enthymemes and public speech, which favor deductive arguments and interaction with the audience, respective­ly. 
"Using enthymeme, we can make active communication, which will make this talk more powerful," she said. 
Jamieson, a renowned expert in political advertising and deception, has appeared on CBS and other television programs as an authority in the field. 
Jamieson traced the duplici­ty of politics to the 1964 presi­dential election, inviting the audience to analyze President Lyndon Johnson's controver­sial anti-nuclear warfare ad campaign. 
She said the 1964 election was "the dirtiest election in politics. It all started here," she said. "This ad served as an iconic reference point for dirty politics." 
Jamieson asked the audi­ence to interpret the ads and explain how they swayed their thoughts on each candidate. 
She proceeded to show another Johnson ad, which never aired due to its sensa­tionalist content. It featured video clips of the Ku Klux Klan and said members supported Republican candidate Senator Barry Goldwater. 
"People are often bothered by the juxtaposition of ads and the placement of people and things," she said. 
Jamieson then fast-forward­ed to the 2004 presidential election and the role of the Internet in political cam­paigns. She said a verbal slip­up from Vice President Dick Cheney led audiences to visit an online blog that endorsed the John Kerry-John Edwards ticket instead of Republican platforms -mistakenly bene­fiting his opponent. 
These blogs and other Web­based news feeds may deter­mine future political outcomes as their popularity among the voters increases, she said. 
"Although [bloggers] are one-sided, they are complete and show the future of cam­paigning and reaching the audience," she said. 
She said political contenders down the road would need to integrate the growing trend to their campaigns' strategies. 
"In politics today, young peo­ple need to find a way to make [the Internet] work for them," she said. "You can fix the sys­tem using technology and find new ways to change the sys­tem." 
Jamieson ended the lecture with questions. 
After Jamieson's farewell, Pauley took the stage again and invited Plamondon to say a few words. Pauley presented her with a collection of letters from the alumnae who endorsed her lecture series. 
Vihtelic recognized Plamondon's accomplishments and her lasting impact on her students in her opening state­ment. 
"We want to note her [Plamondon's] many contribu­tions to Saint Mary's and her impact on countless young women," she said. "Over 1,000, to be exact." 
Students from the graduat­ing classes of 1981-2004 were responsible for the series and provided funding for the endowment. 
Dr. John Pauley, communica­tions professor and chair of the Communication Studies department, was the driving force behind the series to honor his longtime colleague. 
"[Plamondon] stood beside, behind me and with me since I came here in 1991 and this has not changed," he said. 
Plamondon said the expan­sion of the department during her time in the College would have not been possible without the contributions of the entire Saint Mary's community. 
"The department has grown and changed over the years," Plamondon said. And I want to clear up the deception ... everything I have accom­plished has been due to the wonderful support of my stu­dents, colleagues and adminis­tration."

who we are, and should be done with good intentions. 
"Our actions affect our beliefs," he said, "and our beliefs affect our actions.... The only things we do are those that we see as good." 
To foster good character, Incandela said one must learn and practice morally good skills -traits that define moral character. 
Like a coach guides a team, he said, the plays of your life must be learned from others' guidance. 
"It matters a great deal what community we are part of," Incandela said. "None of us form our con­science on our own." 
Defining your personal community, he said, allows you to see what kind of character you possess. 
Being part of a community calls you to compromise ­"a debate between standing out and fitting in," Incandela said.

"I thought that tonight was beneficial because Professor Incandela related our conscience and beliefs directly to our actions," junior Kelly Payne said. "Realizing that our actions

Incandela also said it is important to realize actions and beliefs mutually affect each other.

It's that time of year again -when the arctic South Bend air will induce frostbite in mere minutes and when you wonder why on earth you endure such excruciating conditions just to get an education. 
And as you wit­ness countless stu­dents wiping out on the ice-coated sidewalks, your thoughts might skate backwards in time to a young woman who was once the epitome of "trouble on ice" -former figure skater Tanya Harding. 
True -Harding was the first woman to nail the triple axle, double toe loop combination, but we all know that her name would've melted into obscurity-that is, if she hadn't been a co-conspirator in the 1994 clubbing of her nemesis, Nancy Kerrigan. 
And yet this skating saga was a measly single axle compared to that spectacle that would spin in the com­ing summer, boosting former football star O.J. Simpson into Gold Medal position on the award stand of infamy. 
True -Simpson was the first NFL running back to rush for over 2,000 yards in a single season. but we all know that his name would bear nowhere near the notoriety that it does today, had he not allegedly slain (oh, wait, he was acquitted in the criminal trial) his ex-wife, Nicole Brown, and her friend, Ron Goldman. 

Liz Coffey 
The Coffey 
Grind 

And yet both the football-player­turned-murderer and the figure­skater-turned-clubbing-conspirator realized eternal renown without dropping thousands of dollars (and adding dozens of layers of clothing) en route to a top-tier education. After all. Simpson was simply enrolled in classes (perhaps a ball­room dance class?) at the University of Southern California, and Harding didn't even graduate from high school (although she later earned her GED). 
Oh, well-at least the pair pos­sessed some degree of athletic apti­tude. 
But what about those with non­educationally or athletically-oriented "talents" who also managed to squeeze their way onto the podium of infamy? 
What about the talent-less former back-up dancer Kevin Federline? As subzero temperatures descended upon South Bend last Sunday, Federlinn starred in a Super Bowl commerdal, our society's sure sign of infinite repute. And how did he attain that sought-after status sym­bol? lin merely married (and then divorced) a trampy pop music icon. 
What about former White llouse intern Monica Lewinsky? She simply "pleased" then-President Bill Clinton, thus securing her own medal of noto­riety. 
What about former Enron CEO (and now deceased) Kenneth Lay? Well, he surely would've netted straight 6.0's in the category of egregious corpo­rate fraud. And after that unfeeling feat, his name was undoubtedly pro­pelled into another esteemed catego­ry -that of the forevermore recog­nizable. 
Likewise, what about Lorena Bobbit? I needn't tell you what she did to earn her place among the notorious; more likely than not, you're already familiar with her butcherous tale. 
And what about Notre Dame alum­nus Steve Bartman? In 2003, he caught the scorn of a city -and thus, eternal infamy. And he did this using only his hand, not his coveted Notre Dame degree. 
So why then do we trek through polar snows and tolerate the "wind tunnel" of South Quad? After all, we can clearly attain everlasting renown without either an education or that highly sought-after piece of paper. 
So what's the moral of this story? 
Perhaps you should ditch your goose-down coat and your Biology textbook. Maybe what you really need is a trampy wife or a black leather glove that you can claim doesn't fit. 
Otherwise you, as just one of the many well-meaning students who slip on the ice in front of DeBartolo, will slip into obscurity like Tonya Harding should have. 
You surely don't want a frostbitten nose. But don't you want to be frozen in time?

Think about what Lent will mean to you 
U-WIRE 


Declare your own personal snow day 

Last Sunday's Super Bowl garnered the second­largest TV audience in the history of our country for a sporting event. My own conviction is that I sometimes prefer the conference playoff games because I find them more exciting than the Super Bowl itself. But a lot of people 
Richard V.

ments that sell for millions of dol­lars. One would assume that pay­
FaithPoint 
ing that much money for a 30-sec­ond or 60-second ad would encourage the advertis­ers themselves to put their best foot forward. That certainly did not seem to be the case on Sunday. 
We all know how significant the media is in form­ing our convictions and even determining what val­ues should be the most important ones for us as a people and a culture. If that is the case, the spate of rather violent episodes in the Super Bowl adver­tisements seems to be a cautionary light for us. A number of the advertisements contained violence at some level of one kind or another. In thinking about that, I could not help but reflect on two different matters which I have been thinking about lately. 
We know that in our country a lack of respect for people is something that is all too easily taken for granted. This is not true only with regard to the way we talk about and refer to people who are dif­ferent than we are, but it also spills over into the relationships between men and women, our nation­al conversation with regard to immigrants, the lack of progress in terms of racial equality which we are reminded about every time we celebrate Martin Luther King, Jr. or just give even a passing thought to the situation in our country and a growing intol­erance for some of the institutions which have made our country what it is over the course of the years. 
For over a decade now, young people have been spending hours entertaining themselves with vio­lent video games, the object of which is to kill as many people as possible in the course of the game itself. I wonder if the effects of this kind of expo­sure are not slowly eroding away the idea of respect among us and even our respect for life itself. 
Within fewer than two weeks, we will once again begin our Lenten observance which will prepare us for the great feast of Easter. It is probably not too soon to begin thinking about what we would like this Lent to be for us and what changes we would like to see take place within our own lives. If we begin giving some thought now to how we will live out this holy season of grace, we will not have to scramble at the last minute and perhaps fall back into previous Lenten practices which, although they are very good in and of themselves, may not be what we need at this moment in our lives. 
Increased devotion to the Eucharist should cer­tainly be a part of our Lenten observance. There is no higher degree of human solidarity than when believers gather around the Eucharistic table to lis­ten to the Word of God, to encourage one another in their quest to make Jesus the center of their lives and who share together in receiving the body and blood of Our Lord. 
It may also be a time for us to really examine how we live in solidarity with other people and what role the poor should play as we determine the almsgiving that has to be part of our Lenten resolu­tions as well. 
If we take time now to think about where we would like to be on Easter as a result of our Lenten season of grace, this may be a super Lent for each one of us.

Certainly, you'll shake your head in a "why me?" sort of way before pushing your door open to find your hands have instantly turned a few beaten hues of pink. 
Then, sloshing through ridges of brown slush, you'll track your way through your schedule, making stops at Bowman, Satterfield, and Business Administration to find two of your three classes are can­celed anyway and only you and some coughing/sneezing classmate were brave enough to weather the weather. 
Your professor will walk in, conduct a 
session that runs about half the usual

who feel a severe sense of guilt when your 
name isn't inked on an attendance sheet, 
make note: "Trotting in frigid temperatures is not a significant means to keeping you warm," said Keith C. Heidorn, author of "And Now the Weather" and frequent contributor to National Public Radio. "Movement actually reduces clothing's effectiveness by 20 percent." 
Heidorn sug­gests wearing several layers as opposed to one thick coat to maintain a healthy tempera­

ture. "If you're shiver­ing, that's your body attempting to increase your metabol­ic heat input," he said. Your body temperature is getting lower and your brain is 
slowing down. You're unable to think clearly and move as well as your normally would. This means note taking is going to be physically and mentally trying. Well, more so than usual. 
By the way, Heidorn warns that "when the surface of your skin is exposed to below freezing temperatures for an extended period of time, ice crystals begin to form within the live cells of the skin, killing them in the process." 
Pesky little ice crystals. 
That's OK. The tip of your nose is over­rated anyway. Rest assured that come spring time, stubs are going to be the new must-have. 
In the meantime, you have three options tomorrow morning: 
1. 
Stay indoors and declare your own personal snow day. 

2. 
If you dare, do all of your classmates afavor. All you need is a computer. 7 cents in FlashCash, a call number, a disre­gard for severe repercussions and a strip of Scotch tape. It's that easy. 


Your third choice? Lose your nose. It's up to you.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR 

Parallels exist between drurUks,awesomeness 
Dear Mark Poyar (Feb. 7 Letter to the Editor, 'Parallels exist between drunks, gov­ernment') -welcome to America! One of your rights as a citizen of this great nation, and part of what makes this country so amazing, is that you are free to spew your Bush-Bashing, tree-hugging, French-loving propaganda in Viewpoint as much as you want. Because of your right to freedom of speech, we won't even begin to touch on the topic of how you believe it's not OK to kill ter­rorist.<>, yet you claim abortion as an "American value." ... Even though neither of us thinks unborn babies are the real enemies of democracy. There is a much more impor­tant issue that needs to be addressed. The one thing that has always been a central part to the soul of America, one thing that we cannot and will not allow you to disrespect, is drinking. Ever since the Puritans embarked on their passage to America with more beer aboard their ships than water, this country has been centered around drinking. In the 17th century, abstainers had to pay ten per­cent more for health insurance because it is almost a scientific fact that those who drink all the time are healthier, stronger and more awesome than those that don't. Ifyou cannot appreciate and respect the importance of alcohol in America, then feel free to move to some place like Canada, or at the very least, switch to a dry dorm like Morrissey.

CD REVIEWS 

There's no 'Wincing' at The Shins' success 
By CHRIS McGRADY Assistant Scene Editor 
The Shins have done it again, but not at all in the same way as before. The group's newest effort "Wincing the Night Away" is the type of speaker candy that makes the listener once again have faith in the mod­ern music industry. 
In the world of electronic Paris Hilton songs, covers of covers and "American Idol." "Wincing the Night Away" is more than just a breath of fresh air, it is an oxy­gen tank for the drowning musical afi­cionado. 
The band originally formed in 1997 in Albuquerque, New Mexico and has been making music ever since. Originally start­ed as a passion project of singer/song­writer/guitarist James Mercer, the band dominated the underground indie music scene for several years before reaching a national audience when two of their songs were featured in the 2004 movie "Garden State," starring Zach Braff and Natalie Portman. The soundtrack for the movie airways just beg­

have its best song in the song, "Turn 
Sub Pop 
On Me." The track is so enjoyable that audio play­ers' repeat but­tons may quickly become worn out.
····~]

Recommended tracks: 'Sleeping Lessons,"Australia,' 
This track has the 
'Turn on Me' and 'Spilt Needles' 
type of feel-good sound that corn-received widespread praise for its origi­nality and the overall quality of the songs, and The Shins found themselves at center stage as a bulk of the soundtrack's suc­cess was placed squarely on the band's shoulders. With the release of "Wincing the Night Away," the spotlight won't be leaving the group anytime soon. 
The CD is one of those types that finds its way into your CD player and manages to stay there for weeks, even months. The album starts strong and never wavers and becomes one of those rare CDs that can be played from start to finish without the listener ever wishing to skip to the next song. 
The first track, "Sleeping Lessons," opens quietly like a dream. Just when it almost induces you into a trance, the drums come in and bring the song to life. From the start the CD appears to be great. 
The next song, "Australia," is equally appealing. The best part about The Shins' sound is how much fun their music is to listen to. Listeners can't help but smile when the airy, bright songs 
bounce along the pels the listener to sing along. Overall the sound is bright and brilliant, the lyrics witty and addictive and the instrumenta­tion clever and clear. The song is nothing short of wonderful. 


The song "Spilt Needles" follows the precedent of the rest of the album, and is in itself another great track. The Shins arc lyrically on top of their game and pos­sess some of the most unique and enjoy­able sounds to come along in years. This truly is a band that is streaking its way to the top, beyond any indie success they previously had. 
Overall, this album could quickly find itself on the way into the "album of the year" discussion. Several of the songs could be picks for single of the year, and The Shins sound is pleasant, fulfilling and overall impressive. When Natalie Portman references The Shins in "Garden State," she says, "You gotta hear this one song, it'll change your life I promise you." Well, you have to hear this album, it'll change your life -I promise you.

Applause worthy for latest 'Clap Hands' album 
By CHRIS McGRADY Assistant Scene Editor 
Clap Your Hands Say Yeah is one of those bands that defies any definition. Somewhere between pop-rock, folk, elec­tronica and alternative lies the true har­mony that comprises the music produced by these Brooklyn/Philadelphia rockers and the band's most recent effort, "Some Loud Thunder" is evocative of this het­erogeneous mixture of musical sounds. 
Clap Your Hand Say Yeah is a band that is a prototype of the power of the Internet music scene. The band formed in 2004 and self-produced and self-promoted its own music. The band's addictive sound caught onto Internet listeners and the effect snowballed from there, gathering more listeners and fans every day. As the group garnered praise on indie music blogs, its fan base increased. By the time 2005 was over, the group had signed with Wichita Records and was one of the hottest bands in the country. 
Their newest CD, "Some Loud Thunder," is the group's second release

. ing rock groups around. 
The CD opens with the title track, "Some Loud Thunder" and starts off on a sub-par note. The song sounds like it is too much for speakers to handle and has a grainy, distorted effect. After trying built-in computer speakers, satellite speakers and headphones, the conclusion is that this is the way the song is meant to sound. However, the overall effect of this is one of annoyance. The vocalists' whiny voices are amplified, and while this style of singing works for most of the band's songs, this particular track is negatively affected. · 
The CD takes a sharp upward turn on the next track, however, with "Emma Jean Stock," a feel-good catchy sound that features sharp guitar-picking and interesting electronic effects. 
Another highlight of the album is the song "Satan Said will have the listener bobbing his or her head to the tune within the first 15 sec­onds of the track. There are no vocals for the first minute of the track and this peri­od serves to display the musical talent that Clap Your Hands Say Yeah really has. 
'The Sword Song" is the bonus track on the disc and is also one of the best songs. The song features a strong drum base, overlaid with melodic guitar riffs. The overall effect is an addictive mix and this very well might be the best track on the entire CD. For once, the bonus track on an album is actually a bonus. 
The interesting thing about the group Clap Your Hands Say Yeah is that vocally, they really aren't very talented. Often at times, the notes they sing sound forced and unharmonious. The thing is, the band just doesn't care. In the style of Bob Dylan, not known for his great voice, CYHSY builds greatness through lyrical genius and musical diversity and talent. The name of the band, in fact, is fitting ~ its music simply makes the listener clap his or her hands and say, "Yeah!"

"The two guys we have com­ing in are very contrasting in their styles," Weis said. 
Duval Kamara, of Hoboken, N.J., verbally committed to Weis on May 10, 2006. At 6­foot-4, he is similar in style to former Irish receiver Maurice Stovall and is ranked the eighth best receiver nationally by Scout.com. 
Golden Tate, out of John Paul II high school in Hendersonville, Tenn., is a smaller, quicker receiver in the mold of Notre Dame rising junior David Grimes. Tate is listed at 6-foot but runs a 4.4­second 40. 
Mike Ragone, out of Cherry Hill, N.J., was Notre Dame's only tight end signee for 2007. He was ranked second nation­ally at his position by Scout.com. Ragone stands 6­foot-5 and weighs 230 pounds. Six of his nine touchdowns went for 60 yards or longer. 
"You won't find many tight ends that run as fast as him," Weis said. 

Linemen 
Notre Dame signed two true offensive linemen for the class of 2011 -Taylor Dever of Grass Valley, Calif., and Matt Romine of Tulsa, Okla. -and one true defensive lineman ­Ian Williams of Longwood, Fla. 
Dever was credited with 80 pancake blocks during his sen­ior season. 
Romine had to be pried away from his home-state Sooners. 
"He's an Oklahoma kid, but he's a Notre Dame fit," Weis said. "He's a guy we wanted. He fit great with our players." 
Williams stands 6-foot-2 and weighs 295 pounds. His style is similar to that of Notre 

"This guy is a very disrup­tive interior defensive line­man, the type of guy that can make us better in a hurry," Weis said. 
The Irish also signed Nuss and Nwankwo, who could play either side of the ball. 
"As you go through the offensive line/defensive line process, it was important for us to find a couple players that could play either offense or defense because we could­n't really take the risk of dou­bling the numbers up," We is said. "But we had to find a couple guys that were capable of playing our offensive or defensive line." 

Linebackers 
Notre Dame signed four line­backers to strengthen a unit that struggled at times in 2006. 
Kerry Neal was the first Irish commitment for the class of 2011. He gave his verbal to Weis Feb. 24, 2006. Neal, from Bunn, N.C., weighs 230 pounds and will play outside linebacker in new Notre Dame defensive coordinator Corwin Brown's 3-4 personnel pack­age. 
The Irish also picked up commitments before the sea­son from Aaron Nagel of Lemont, Ill., and Steve Paskorz of Allison Park, Pa. Weis said both players will probably end up playing inside in the new defensive align­ment. 
In January, Notre Dame offered a scholarship to out­side linebacker prospect Brian Smith out of Overland Park, Kan. Smith had committed to Iowa, but changed his mind after the Irish offered. Smith's father Chris played at Notre Dame from 1981-85. 
"When our system changed [to a 3-4], he became a perfect fit," Weis said. 
and Chris Donald, strongly considered Notre Dame, but signed with Florida and Tennessee, respectively. 
Defensive Backs 
The Irish picked up five defensive backs last year and limited their offers in the sec­ondary this year, picking up cornerback Gary Gray from Columbia, S.C., and Harrison Smith from Knoxville, Tenn. 
Gray was rated Scout.com's sixth best cornerback. After decomitting from South Carolina this summer, he choose Notre Dame over the Gamecocks and enrolled at Notre Dame along with Allen and Clausen at the beginning of the spring semester. 
Smith, who grew up in the Volunteers' back yard, runs a 
4.45 40-yard dash and had scholarship offers from Tennessee and Auburn in addition to Notre Dame. 
"The thing we're bringing him in as a safety who can cover from sideline to side­line," Weis said. "One of the things we think we need to do is get additional range in the secondary with our safeties." 
Kickers 
Late in the recruiting process, Notre Dame got a commitment from Brandon Walker of Findlay, Ohio. 
Walker had previously com­mitted to Louisville, but he decided to come to Notre Dame after Weis offered. He will push sophomore Ryan Burkhart for the starting kick­ing job next year. 
"I was only interested in bringing in a guy at this posi­tion with another scholarship if it was a guy who had a chance of unseating somebody and being able to get on the field for us as a freshman," Weis said. "We think, looking at this kid, he has the poten­

Early signing period wouldn't help teams like Ball State 
Justin Trattou is a star defen­sive end out of Don Bosco Prep in Ramsey, N.J. He verbally com­mitted to Notre Dame way back in June, and it made perfect sense. He's a kid from a Catholic high school less than an hour from Franklin Township, where Irish coach Charlie Weis led a team to a state title. He was going to be the next big defensive end for the Irish. 
Until Florida stepped in. 

Gators coach Urban Meyer nabbed Trattou from Notre Dame en route to Florida's con­sensus No. 1 recruiting class. With the loss of Trattou, a schol­arship spot opened for the Irish. 
Brian Smith is a mid-to high­level linebacker from Overland Park, Kan. lie was Iowa's sec­ond-best linebacker recruit when he verbally committed to the Hawkeyes. A kid from a good family with a football back­ground, he looked destined to be a great addition for Iowa. 
Until Notre Dame stepped in. 

The 6-foot-2, 230-pound Smith wasn't a target for Notre Dame early, even though his father is a member of the school's

Weis has a new policy for com­mitments, and it's simple: no soft verbals, no silent commits, no quiet verbals and no visits to or conversations with other schools if you commit to Notre Dame. 
But Ball State can't afford that sort of a policy, which is where Weis' parallel thought-"if you're looking, we're looking" ­only keeps schools like Ball State mired in unwinnable recruiting situations. 
Weis' two-pronged approach certainly isn't hypocritical; it just doesn't solve the problems for the smaller schools. The early signing day and refusal to accept soft verbal commitmenl'i will protect major-eonference pow­ers, but the belief that any player "looking" is fair game leaves the smaller schools vulnerable to poaching by bigger schools. 
So why should the NCAA make it easier for big-time programs to recruit while not doing anything to help the schools with less prestige or tradition? An early signing period would help only some, and those some are the major programs with national reputations that aren't able to convince players to stick with them come February. 
Weis is trying to do what's best for his team and the entire Irish program. But the early signing day, which the NCAA would have to pass, will amount only to elitist protectionism. 
But then again, when was the NCAA charged with anything else?

Smith verbally committed just days after Trattou's spot opened up. 
Bruce Davis is a weak-side linebacker from Cleveland. He wasn't the biggest recruit -in fact, he wasn't even listed as one ofScout.com's 50-best players at his position. But he was a solid land for Ball State. 
Until Iowa stepped in. 
The Hawkeyes only found out about Davis during the winter and offered the 5-foot-11, 230­pound linebacker in January as soon as Smith was destined for Notre Dame. Davis accepted the spot immediately and signed with Iowa Wednesday.

In a year when they went to the South to sign a quarterback prospect out of Georgia, the Cardinals were out of luck for a key defender. 
In today's college football, that's what happens when you're in the Mid-America Conference, and recruits start to treat verbal commitments like statements of emotion. 
"On a national basis ... more guys switched last year and this year than ever before," said Tom Lemming, national recruiting analyst for CSTV. "It's happening more and more nowadays." 
And the complaints poured in across the country Wednnsday. But while the reality hurts Notre Dame and Iowa because they haven't dominated lately like Florida has, it hurts teams like Ball State the most. 
'The simple thing that hap­pened with us was really a reac­tion from when the young man who was committed to Notre Dame committed to Florida," Ball State eoach Brady Hoke said in a telephone interview with The Observer Wednesday. "That chain reaction happens, and that's part of [recruiting)." 
Hoke said his stan· debates how best to keep players committed to Ball State, a program close in geography to Notre Dame but far apart in almost every other way 
that matters in 
recruiting. The 
increased burden 
of hosting official visits nearly every home game, Hoke said. 
What he didn't mention is that most players could hold out hope for getting an offer from a major conference school as the early signing day comes and goes. 
"I think then you've got a real conflict of preparing your team and recruiting," he said. "For the major schools, it's probably not as major a problem, but for schools of our level, I think it would be." 
Hoke's right. For

commits.
In fact, Weis wants an early signing peri­od with an Aug. 1 national signing day. He says this allows high school players to fm­ish the recruiting cycle before their senior season and gives coaches a chance to look for replacements if a verbal commit­ment has a last-minute change of heart. For Notre Dame, when wide receiver Greg Little of Raleigh, N.C., went to the Tar Heels and offensive lineman Chris Little of Jeffersonville, Ga., faxed his letter of intent to the Bulldogs Wednesday, the Irish had no time to react. Twenty recruits became 18, and the Irish were out two top-150 prospects. 
Lemming said that most coach­es don't like the number of late switches and the custom of reeruiting powerhouses poaching from other schools, but they're not sure what to do about it. He said athletic directors worry about kids signing binding letters of intent before the usual time for a coach to resign or be fired, and an early signing period would cause that situation at 15 or more schools every year. 
This year, the Irish indeed ben­efited by allowing players to reconsider their commitments once a coach leaves. 
In an interview last week with The Observer, kieker/punter signee Brandon Walker's former coach, ClifT Hite, said Walker knew he wanted to go to Notre

Louisville. 
He was happy 

with his deci­sion until Louisville coach Bobby Petrino jettisoned the Cardinals for the Falcons of the NFL. Hite said Walker decided to open up his recruitment again, and Notre Dame's kicking woes in 2006 steered the Irish to the Findlay, Ohio, product. 
A week ago, Walker grabbed the offer from the Irish. He signed his letter of intent Wednesday. 
Notre Dame's main problem is when a recruit says he's coming and the Irish feel confident that he's telling the truth only to have the prospect sign elsewhere. So

"This kid is as good an ath­lete as I saw this year," Weis said. 
On special teams, Weis said he would only sign a kicker who could compete immedi­ately for the starting job. In Brandon Walker, Weis thinks he found his guy. Walker made a 50-yard field goal and averaged 7 yards deep on kickoffs from the 40-yard line as a junior. 
At tackle in the team's new 3-4 personnel defensive scheme, Ian Williams, a 6­foot-2, 295-pounder from Florida, is expected to fight for the starting job immedi­ately. Weis said 340-pound current offensive lineman Chris Stewart would get a look there, but Weis wants Williams to play immediately.

DPAC SPOTLIGHT 
Gender explored in successful 'Transamerica' 
By MARTY SCHROEDER 
Assistant Scene Editor 
Although it may be a mainstream film that holds both dramatic tension and an accurate portrayal in high regard, "Transamerica" is an effective picture that brings pain and joy to viewers through the eyes or a transsex­ual woman named Bree. 
Bree (a marvelous Felicity Huffman, who was nominated for an Oscar for this role) is about to have sexual reas­signment surgery when she discovers she has a son liv­ing on the streets -trust not only in others but also in one's self. 
Felicity Huffman shines as Bree, Kevin Zegers is outstandingly edgy as Toby and Graham Greene is gentle and kind as the rancher Calvin Many Goats, who falls for Bree and is basically the only character in the fiim who treats Bree as the woman she wants to be. 
Many other minor characters make colorful appearances, such as Bree's parents whom Bree meets in a last ditch effort for help. Neither her moth­er or father can forgive Bree, whom they call their son, and Fionulla Flanagan is won­derfully comic,

Pixar has done it again. The digital ani­mation studio that has turned out such hits as "Toy Story" and "Finding Nemo" has once again made a movie that is funny, entertaining, engaging and thought-provoking at the same time with its 2006 hit "Cars." 
The John Lasseter ("Toy Story") directed film was the seventh produced in the part­nership between,Pixar and Disney (and the last before Disney bought Pixar out­right), which dates back to 1995's "Toy Story." "Cars" clocked in as the second­highest grossing domestic film in 2006 (behind "Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest") and was recently released on DVD. 
The story centers around a hot-shot, rookie race car named Lightning McQueen (voiced by Owen Wilson) who wants to make it big in the racing world. In his quest to win a racing title, he comes into a tie with the old guard race car, The King (Richard Petty), and his rival, Chick Hicks (Michael Keaton). 
A tie-breaker race is set, but on his way there, McQueen gets lost in Radiator

The travel across America is also beautifully well shot and the vast­ness of the United States is spectacu­larly viewed in this film.

expressions of the characters' eyes ­placed on cars' wind­shields -to how they use their tires as hands to subtle con­tortions of car struc­denizens -some kind, others not ­who inhabit them. 


Overall, this film is moving not because it tells the pain of someone so the audience can walk out of the the­ater and feel they have done something humanitarian. Of course, some people responded that way. However, if a dif­ferent frame of mind is brought into this film, it can be very rewarding not only as a piece of excellent cinema but as a film that allows us to examine who we are and change -change not only to be more tolerant or accepting but change ourselves into what we really are. 
This film will be showing as part of the film series entitled "Qlassics: Reimagining Sexuality and the Self in Recent American Cinema." It will be screened at 10 p.m. this Saturday in the Browning Cinema in the DeBartolo Performing Arts Center. This is a free _ event, but tickets must be picked up at the DPAC Box Office.

DVD REVIEW 

Disney's smash-hit 'Cars' races to winning DVD 
Springs, a town set on the historic Route 66 that has been passed by in the era of the interstate highway. McQueen's stay in Radiator Springs lasts longer than expect­ed and through his interactions with the town's few residents, who include the Porsche Carrera Sallie (Bonnie Hunt) and a 1951 Hudson Hornet "Doc" (Paul Newman), he learns that there is more to life than winning races and sponsorship money. 
There is no doubt that "Cars" is differ­ent than any of the Pixar films that pre­ceded it. There are no talking animals here, nor immediately endearing and rec­ognizable characters and many critics cited these among the reasons why the film was not the smash success that the other Pixar films were. Film success must be viewed in relative terms, and while "Cars" was not a grand slam by Pixar's standards, it still hit a home run by con­taining a stronger message than in any other Pixar film, being entertaining and by taking computer animation to a new level. 
Indeed, computer animation has become Pixar's forte, and the work done here does not disappoint. Turning cars into animate, living objects would seem a difficult task, yet every character in this 
ftlm has as many dis­
tinct mannerisms 


tures to indicate both movement and emo­tion. 
These animations are aided by excellent voice performances, especially by Wilson and Newman, with entertaining support­ing roles voiced by celebrities including George Carlin, Larry the Cable Guy and even Bob Costas. 
Aside from the characters, the Southwestern des~rt setting of the ftlm is the most realistic yet for Pixar and the extended driving scenes capture perfectly images familiar to anyone who has taken a road trip. 
Hanging over all of this is the film's mes­sage -that in the frenetic whirlwind that is life, taking time to enjoy the simple things can bring great joy. Lasseter con­stantly weaves this theme in and out of the narrative without it become overly apparent. He also manages to tell a com­pelling story at the same time -a true sign of excellent filmmaking. 
The DVD is light on special features, especially when compared to other Pixar releases. Several deleted scenes and one short featurette are all that give viewers insight into the making of the film, and one must wonder if the DVD was rushed into production without a full slate of extras. 
In spite of this, "Cars" is still a delight­fully entertaining and meaningful film worthy of purchase on DVD. It is clear that Pixar still has the magic when it comes to computer animation.

have a chance to win (the West). It's going to be down to Game 7 and one possession, like always. It's going to be a big battle." 

Cavaliers 94, Clippers 77 
Zydrunas Ilgauskas scored 16 points with a season-high 16 rebounds, Larry Hughes scored 15 points and the Cleveland Cavaliers hardly needed LeBron James in an easy victory over the Los Angeles Clippers on Tuesday night. 
James scored 11 points ­three above his season low and 15 below his average -and spent the first half of the fourth quarter watching as the scuf­11ing Cavaliers, who came in just 4-8 since Jan. 16, won their fifth straight at home against the Clippers. 
Sasha Pavlovic added 16 points and Drew Gooden 13 for Cleveland, which held the Clippers to 35 percent shooting. Elton Brand led Los Angeles with 21 points and Shaun Livingston added 19 for the Clippers, who have dropped three in a row. · 
In the aftermath of a stinging loss to Detroit on Sunday, both James and Hughes said the Cavaliers should be running more, their argument being the team is better suited for an up­tempo offensive game than the slowdown style preferred by coach Mike Brown, who preach­es defense first. 
The Cavs pushed the action when they could, but there was no drastic change in their offense. What was new was that they made a few more free throws, going 21-of-28 (75 per­cent) from the line. 
Cleveland has been the NBA's worst free-throw shooting team all season and came in making just 68 percent of its attempts. 


James didn't get to the line until the final minute but sank both his tries. 
Leading by 11 at halftime and 13 after three quarters, the Cavaliers pushed their lead to 21 with 5:15 remaining when James drilled a 3-pointer. 
With upcoming games later this week against Miami and the Los Angeles Lakers, _the Cavs, now 7-1 at home against Western Conference teams, needed a relaxing night and the Clippers seemed only too willing to give them one. 
Los Angeles forward Corey Maggette was inactive, one day after he criticized coach Mike Dunleavy following the club's loss in New York. Maggette, sec­ond on the team in seoring and rebounding, was unhappy about playing just 17 minutes against the Knicks, who overcame a 10­point defir~it to win. 
"It's just more of Dunleavy's (stuff) again," said Maggette, who recently had a meeting with owner Donald Sterling, Dunleavy and general manager Elgin Baylor to end trade specu­lation about the seven-year vet­eran. "I don't get it, I really don't. It's crazy. I put in work. I deserve to play. It's totally mind-boggling to me." 
The Cavaliers were just 1-of­13 to open the second quarter before Ilgauskas hit a jumper to snap a 35-all tie. Hughes scored nine straight points and Cleveland closed the period with a 10-2 spurt to open a 54­43 halftime lead.

Associated Press 
Florida won the recruit­ing crown in nearly as dominating fashion as the national championship. 
The Gators capitalized on last month's national title win over Ohio State and down years from Sunshine State rivals Florida State and Miami to bring in the top recruiting class in the country Wednesday. 
"No one is even that close to them," said recruiting analyst Tom Lemming of CSTV. "They got help everywhere. In the past 10 years, this has to rank right at the top in recruiting classes. 

Every position is absolutely loaded." 
The Gat.ors also were picked as the top class by SuperPrep, Rivals.com and National Blue Chips, beating out Southern California, SEC rivals Tennessee and LSU, and Texas. 
The Trojans closed strong, adding top run­ning backs Joe McKnight from Louisiana and Broderick Green from Arkansas on Wednesday to a class that already included another top back in Marc Tyler; defensive end Everson Griffen, SuperPrep's No. 1 overall player; the nation's No. 1 receiver, Ronald Johnson 
IN BRIEF 
Mike Tyson enters rehab after 
most recent drug arrest 
PHOENIX -Mike Tyson has checked himself into an inpatient treatment program for "various addic­tions" while awaiting trial on drug charges, his lawyer said Wednesday. 
"He needed to get involved in some­thing that would help him with his addiction," attorney David Chesnoff said. Chesnoff wouldn't describe Tyson's addictions, but police said the former heavyweight champion told officers that he used cocaine frequent­ly. 
Chesnoff said Tyson checked himself into an undisclosed facility shortly after appearing in a Phoenix court­room. 
The 40-year-old Tyson pleaded not guilty on Jan. 22 in Maricopa County Superior Court to felony drug posses­sion and paraphernalia possession counts and two misdemeanor counts of driving under the influence of drugs. 
from Michigan; and blue chip linebacker Chris Galippo from Anaheim, Calif. 
"USC continues to be the place that a lot of skill-position players look to first," said analyst Bobby Burton of Rivals.com. "That doesn't mean the guys they get on defense aren't special. It just means they have the pick of the litter when it comes to offensive skill players." 
But the Gators' class was best of all, signing eight of the top 16 play­ers in talent-rich Florida and the No. 1 players from South Carolina, Indiana, Maryland and New England, according to Rivals.com. 
A coaching change at Miami and another down year for Florida State played a key part in the Gators' success. 
"They play an exciting brand of ball on offense and defense and a lot of kids want be in that situ­ation," said Allen Wallace, the national recruiting editor for Scout.com and publisher of SuperPrep magazine. "There's no question they've moved into the catbird seat in Florida. They have taken advan­tage of tough times for both the Hurricanes and Seminoles." 

Dale Earnhardt Inc. signs
Jeffrey Earnhardt 
CHARLOTTE, N.C. -As Dale Earnhardt Jr. continued contract extension negotiations with DEI, the company came to terms with anoth­er driver named Earnhardt. 
Jeffrey Earnhardt, the 17-year-old grandson of the late Dale Earnhardt, has signed a "long-term driving serv­ices contract" with Dale Earnhardt Inc. The signing came as Earnhardt Jr. prepared to meet Wednesday with team officials to discuss his future with his father's company. 
Earnhardt Jr.'s contract with DEI is up at the end of the season, and negotiations have been tense since stepmother Teresa Earnhardt seem­ingly questioned his commitment in a December interview with The Wall Street Journal. 
With the season set to begin with the Daytona 500 on Feb. 18, team officials would like to resolve Earnhardt Jr.'s situation. 
Landis could receive 2-year
ban from racing in France 
PARIS -Floyd Landis could be banned from racing in France for the next two years if the country's anti-doping agency issues a maxi­mum penalty Thursday for his pos­itive doping test at last year's Tour de France. 
The American cyclist will not attend the hearing, but will be represented by his lawyers, Landis' spokesman Michael Henson said Wednesday in a con­ference call. 
The lawyers can present argu­ments to the nine-member panel, which includes French magis­trates. The agency's president, Philippe Bordry, said Landis would receive a fair hearing. 
"It's not because someone is pos­itive that he must be automatically suspended," Bordry said. "The rights of the defense are very important."

OLYMPICS 


Hamm twins prep for '08 

Associated Press 
PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. ­The International, known for its unique scoring system on a Castle Pines golf course held in the mile-high air outside Denver, will no longer be on the PGA Tour schedule effec­tive immediately, a tour official said Wednesday. 
The absence of a corporate sponsor was mostly responsi­ble for canceling the 21-year­old tournament, said the offi­cial, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the deci­sion had not formally been announced. 
PGA Tour commissioner Tim Finchem and tournament founder Jack Vickers were expected to make it official Thursday morning. They spent the last two weeks in a final effort to find a sponsor, then agreed to end it now. 
International spokeswoman 

Joanna Busack said Vickers would not comment until Thursday. 
The cancellation leaves a hole in the PGA Tour schedule on July 5-8, but tour officials have been working on a con­tingency plan over the last month and are expected to announce a replacement by April. 
The leading candidate is Washington, the largest U.S. market without a PGA Tour event. The nation's capital had a tour event since 1968, but that presumably ended when title sponsor Booz Allen bailed out last year because it was not part of the FedExCup por­tion of the PGA Tour schedule. 
Other markets under consid­eration are Minneapolis, Philadelphia and Kansas City. 
The tour official said there was sponsorship interest in several major markets, although none of those span­sors was interested in the International. 
The International began in 1986 and used a modified Stableford scoring system, rewarding points for eagles and birdies and deducting points for bogeys or worse. It promoted aggressive play and featured some dramatic finish­es, along with a roll call of champions that included Ernie Els, Vijay Singh and Phil Mickelson. 
Dean Wilson won last year in a playoff over Ryder Cup cap­tain Tom Lehman. 
"It's a good thing I had this format this week," Wilson said. He would have been 9 under par in stroke play, while Lehman would have finished at 13 under. 
Tiger Woods only played twice, the last time in 1999 when it was played a week after the PGA Championship, and that became an issue with Vickers. He often lamented the absence of golf's top draw, and he continued to ask the tour for different dates. It moved from a week after the PGA Championship to two weeks before the final major, then the week before the PGA. 
Gymnastic medalists will rejoin US team after college graduation 
Associated Press 
A few months ago, Paul Hamm was pretty sure he was finished with gymnas­tics. 
The Olympic gold medalist and twin brother Morgan were having too much fun being regular college stu­dents. They actually h-ad free time, and no coach or train­ing schedule to dictate what they should do with it. They could focus on school and were close to finishing their degrees. 
The more they talked, though, the l-Iamms realized they weren't quite ready to walk away. The Beijing Olympics are a year and a half away, and tho brothers want one more chance to show what they can do. 
And, they hope, snag the United States a few more medals in the process. 
"The time off gave us what we needed to really develop the motivation that we have right now," Paul Hamm said Wednesday. "We see a goal in front of us, and we're going for it. Sometimes when you're in the daily grind of gymnastics, you forget it. 
"We know for a fact if we're in good shape, we can help the team." 
Paul and Morgan Hamm's announcement Tuesday that they are returning to compet­itive gymnastics after an 18­month layoff was an immedi­ate boost for the U.S. men, who plummeted from the sil­ver medal in Athens to an unseemly 13th-place finish at last year's world champi­onships. 
The Hamms, now 24, were two of the world's best gym­nasts when they went on hia­tus. They were responsible for half of the U.S. squad's scores in the team final at the Athens Olympics, helping the American men win their first medal in 20 years. Paul 1-Iamm also was the first U.S. man to win the Olympic all­around title. 
Soon after the event, how­ever, the International Gymnastics Federation acknowledged a scoring error had been made on South Korean Yang Tae­young's second-to-last event. Yang wound up with the bronze, and the Koreans protested. When FIG presi­dent Bruno Grandi suggested Hamm share the medal as acknowledgment of a mis­take, Hamm was fo·rced to defend his gold well after the games were over, all the way to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. 

CAS eventually declared Hamm the rightful gold medalist, and Grandi told the AP in October that he consid­"Our No. I 
Suddenly, they didn't. 

"There's no one looking over your shoulder, no coach seeing if you did this before practice, if you went out over the weekend," Paul Hamm said. "It was nice to have that freedom for the first time in our life. Mostly, we devoted ourselves to school." 
The twins got so used to being "regular" college stu­dents, they thought as recently as last summer that their competitive careers were over. 
"We were sure they were done," said their mother, Cecily Hamm. "But when it came down to the point where they needed to decide, they got closer and closer to changing their mind. 
"I told them, if 
they decided, 
they'd have to

while, and they decided in July 2005 that they wanted to focus on their edu­cations at Ohio State. 
Morgan gets his degree in exercise science in March, and already has plans to go to the National University of Health Sciences after Beijing for his doctorate in chiro­practic medicine. Paul will graduate with an accounting degree in June and wants to go to business school. Both have 3.8 grade-point aver­ages. 
"I'll be laughing at him because he'll still have to go to school, and I can concen­trate on gymnastics," Morgan I-Iamm said of graduating three months before his brother. 
The time off also gave them a look at what life was like outside of the gym. Because they've been doing gymnas­tics since grade school, they'd always had to juggle schoolwork and training. 
They did. 
"A love of the 

sport is a big part of it," Morgan Hamm said of what changed their minds. "We love gymnastics. We want to see what we can accomplish, to see if we can make the Olympic team again and win medals in Beijing. 
"Our No. 1 goal is to help the team get back into medal contention." 
The Hamms are training six days a week at Ohio State and said they're surprised at how quickly their skills have returned. Their bodies no longer ache from a decade's worth of pounding, and the shoulder injury that limited Morgan's strength improved so much he's hoping to com­pete in the all-around for the first time since 2000. 
They plan to compete at the 

U.S. championships in August in San Jose and then resume a full competitive schedule in 2008 that will culminate with the Olympics in Beijing.

Associated Press 
LOUISVILLE, Ky. -On a night when Louisville honored one of its greats, it was Georgetown that ended up turning back the clock. 
The 22nd-ranked Hoyas con­tinued their rise Wednesday night, easing by Louisville 73-65 for their sixth straight win. 
"We are definitely settling into a groove and a lot of the experi­ences that we went through ear­lier in the year are paying off now," said Georgetown coach John Thompson Ill. 
If the Hoyas (17-5, 7-2 Big East) keep dominant perform­ances from center Roy Hibbert, their early season struggles may finally be behind them. · 
Hibbert controlled things at both ends of the floor, scoring 20 points and grabbing 11 rebounds while making 9-of-1 0 from the field and limiting Louisville cen­ter David Padgett to just one field goal. 
"I just wanted to be dominant as much as I could," Hibbert said. "I was just open on the baseline ... and my teammates got me the ball down there." 
Hibbert scored in a variety of ways, getting dunks, lay-ups and even mixing in a jump shot. He never tired despite playing a sea­son-high 35 minutes and helped the Hoyas keep their composure whenever the Cardinals made a run. 
"I just felt we needed to keep him in there," Thompson said. "His presence at both ends was felt. What I didn't want was David to get into a comfort zone. I felt Roy's size would kind of contain him a little bit." 
Earl Clark tied a career-high with 14 points for Louisville (16­8, 6-4), who had been searching for a signature win to bolster its hopes for an NCAA Tournament bid. But the Cardinals shot just 33 percent from the floor in los­ing their 13th straight game to a ranked opponent, spoiling a night when Louisville named the floor at Freedom Hall in honor of former coach Denny Crum. 
"We could have played them 10 times and they would have won nine," said Louisville coach Rick Pitino. "We would have had to play almost a perfect game to 
win." 
The Cardinals were nearly per­fect in one sense, committing a school-record low one turnover, setting a Big East record in the process. Still, it wasn't nearly enough to stop the lloyas, who rarely let the Cardinals get ofT an uncontested shot and came up with every important rebound and loose ball. 
The Hoyas outrebounded the Cardinals 35-30, outscored them 30-14 in the paint and shot 56 percent from the floor. Forward JefT Green was nearly as hot as Hibbert, making 7 -of-1 0 from the field and adding seven rebounds. 
"We used our height advantage and they couldn't defend us," Green said. "We got stops on defense and ran our ofl'ense." 
The Hoyas did whatever they wanted offensively, getting it inside to Hibbert and Green with ease. Whenever the Cardinals sent extra bodies to double­team, the Hoyas simply kicked it out for open 3-pointers. 
The win was Georgetown's first by single digits this season. And while the Hoyas were never really threatened -Louisville never got closer than five in the second half -Georgetown responded each time the Cardinals made a run. 
"We've been in this environ­ment, in very difficult environ­ments like this all year," Thompson said. "The crowd gets into it, they go on a run and our guys are used to that. We did a good job ofjust settling down." 
Louisville pulled within 58-53 on a free throw by Edgar Sosa with under four minutes to play, but Hibbert dunked on Georgetown's next possession, and DaJuan Summers followed with a 3-pointer to push the lead up to 10. Louisville would get no closer than seven the rest of the way. 
"We stuck together when they made runs," Hibbert said. "We didn't want to go back-and-forth. We wanted to keep it to our tempo." 
As dominant as the lloyas were, Thompson is wary of get­ting ahead of himself. Georgetown started the season ranked in the Top 10. only to fall all the way out of the ran kings in December. They're back in the Top 25 and confident they're not the same unfocused bunch that stumbled out of the blocks three months ago. 
"We're much more of a team," Hibbert said. "We've gotten older and we're smarter."

NASCAR 


Ohio school offers motorsports class 
Students learn race car engine mechanics 
Associated Press 
LIMA, Ohio -Michael Klenke learned in class how to assem­ble a race-car engine and tear apart its transmission. He also learned the best way to handle a problem that crops up when a stock car is flying around a dirt race track at 60 mph. 
"It's more than just step on the gas and turn left," Klenke said of driving for the University of Northwestern Ohio's stock-car team. "It makes you realize you really are going to use what you learn here." 
Klenke's school is one of a handful of places where stu­dents can study how to build a race car from the bottom up. The high-performance motor­sports program readies them for a career in auto racing ­whether it be working in a pit crew or in the shop. 
"A lot of people just see NASCAR on Sundays," said Steve Klausing, an instructor who works with the school's race club. "There's a lot that goes into the six days before the race." 
Auto racing's growing pres­ence on television and its widening appeal to mainstream fans has led to more leagues, teams and job opportunities in a pete for internships in the Champ Car World Series and with the Panther Racing team in the Indy Racing League. 
"We work with teams to eon­figure the classes around what the teams need," said Peter Hylton, director of the IUPUI motorsports program. 
ARCA car owner Wayne Hixson, of Soddy Daisy, Tenn., said there's still a learning curve when students start working with a pro team. 
"We're looking for somebody who can carry tires over the wall and put them on," he said. "I teach them how to carry tires, put them on and put air in them." 
About 1,000 students are enrolled in the motorsports program at the University of Northwestern Ohio, which offers two-and four-year degrees in business and tech­nologies. 
The new $7 million motor­sports complex is where they learn about building transmis­sions, welding frames and shaping fenders. 
Classrooms are attached to the garages where stock cars and dragsters are taken apart and put back together. "There's a lot of big-boy toys here," said Tom Grothaus, a dean in the college of technologies. 
In one of the garages, the metal frame of a stock car sits on a lift, but soon it will be fit­ted with an engine and ready

good enough to get you through," said Don Radebaugh, spokesman for the ARCA series. "But it requires more than turning wrenches in a garage. We're seeing more and more drivers and crew mem­bers who are college gradu­ates." 
ARCA has become a stepping stone race league for not only the drivers, but also crew members. 
About 20 students from the Ohio school spent their week­ends last year working with ARCA teams. A group from the school traveled to Florida this week to work at the ARCA 200 on Saturday at Daytona International Speedway. 
They'll work on the engines, clean the cars for the race and watch how the pros adjust the aerodynamics of the cars to make them run faster. 
"It gives any racing program a place to look for help," said Bill Kimmel, crew chief for eight-time ARCA champion Frank Kimmel. "If you take a kid off the street, we have to show them every step of the way." 
He usually pairs a student with an experienced crew member. Kimmel's team, based in New Albany, Ind., hired one of the students who worked for him a year ago to be a mechan­ic. 
Motorsports students at Indiana University-Purdue University in Indianapolis com-the off-road rae­
ers. 
The school also boasts what it calls the world's largest motor­sports classroom -a 114-mile banked dirt track that the uni­versity bought nine years ago. As many as 100 students line up on Friday nights in the spring and summer to work on the pit crews with weekend drivers who come to the Limaland Motorsports Park. 
Anywhere from 2,000 to 5,000 fans show up on race night to watch the sprint cars, stock cars and trucks. 
The university's first stock­car team started competing there last year. This season, it will have two teams racing in cars with "student driver" on the rear bumper. 
"It lets everyone know that they're out there to learn and not to push the other guys into the wall," said university presi­dent Jeffrey Jarvis, who can be found on race nights talking with fans and drivers. 
The motorsports program at the Ohio school started in 1993. Other colleges have since added the training, including Lincoln Tech in Indianapolis and WyoTech at its campus in Fremont, Calif. 
The University of Northwestern Ohio doesn't track how many graduates end up in racing. But former stu­dents now work for teams in NASCAR, the Indy Racing League and minor league cir­cuits. 


FIGURE SKATING 

Shen, Zhao lead pairs competition 
Associated Press 
COLOHADO SPHINGS, Colo. -Shen Xue and Zhao Ilongbo had no problems expressing themselves on the ice in taking the lead of the pairs competi­tion at Four Continents after the short program Wednesday night. 
OfT the ice is a difTerent story. 
"We're retiring," Shen said through an interprllter after their performanee. 
From skating? After Four Continents'? Heally? 
After a quick huddlR with their interpreter -while a buzz went around the room ­they got thR translation straight. 
"We're taking some time off aftp,r the World Championships (in Mareh)," Slwn said with a smile. 
Shen and Zhao lead Chinese counterparts Tong Jian and Pang Qing by :~.49 points head­ing into Thursday's free skate. 
Not bad considering Shen and Zhao almost skipped Four 
L r 
Continents. Coming so close after the Asian Winter Games and given Zhao's superstitions about events at high altitude, the pair almost stayed home. 
"We're very tired," Shen said. 
Considering their recent medical maladies, Tong and Pang are just happy to be skat­ing. 
Tong wears a headband to hide the scar from a Jan. 1 car accident in Beijing -his head crashed through the window ­and Pang can't skate longer than an hour at a time in prac­tice due to a kidney ailment. 
However, they turned in a fairly polished short program. 
"Going to this competition is a high point for us," said Tong, who had 16 stitehes to close the wound to his head. 
Defend·ing Four Continent champions Hena Inoue and John Baldwin landed their sig­nature throw triple axel, but they still were in third place, 
7.56 out of the lead. Brooke Castile and Benjamin Okolski, who won the U.S. 

Championships in January, are in seventh place after each made a mistake on a side-by­side double axel. 
"It's about the skate and not about the title," Castile said. "We look at this as another experience." 
Baldwin was upset with some of the marks after their per­formance. lie thought the pair deserved higher, especially for their spiral sequence. 
"That's one of our best things," Baldwin said. "We kind of got held down on that. I'm not sure why. 
''I'd like to see the judges reward us a little bit more on the second mark instead of holding us back and protecting other teams. We're trying hard things, we're doing things no one else in the world is doing. Give us some eredit for that. ... Be fair to us." 
Language was no problem in the ice dancing, where Benjamin Agosto blurted out a response before a question was asked.

U.S. tops Mexico in friendly 
Associated Press 
GLENDALE, Ariz. -The sell­out crowd belonged to Mexico. The game went to the United States, as usual. 
Jimmy Conrad scored his first international goal, Landon Donovan converted a late break­away and the Americans defeat­ed Mexico 2-0 in an exhibition Wednesday night, extending the dominance of their regional rival. 
"We've clearly done well. I think mentally we do have an edge," Donovan said. "But we were also a little bit lucky." 
Playing in front of a heavily pro-Mexican sellout crowd of 64,462, the Americans improved to 8-2-1 against Mexico since 2000. The United States is 7-0-1 against Mexico on home soil in that stretch, outscoring its southern neighbor 13-0. 
"Right now, we're on top, and we're going to try to stay there," 
U.S. defender Chris Albright said. 
The victory provided a boost for interim coach Bob Bradley, who is hoping to persuade the 
U.S. Soccer Federation to lift his interim tag. Before the game, USSF president Sunil Gulati told reporters the result "is not going to lead to a direct decision as to who the national team coach will be." 
Bradley is 2-0 since he was hired Dec. 8 to replace Bruce Arena. 
'The work that we put in this month has been very good," Bradley said. "Not only to pre­pare us for these two games but to establish a foundation for every camp." 

The United States started slow but finished in a rush. 
Conrad, playing his 19th inter­national game, headed home a corner kick by Donovan in the 52nd minute, beating goalkeep­er Oswaldo Sanchez inside the left post. It was the 24th career assist for Donovan, the U.S. career leader. 
Donovan added the clincher in the 90th minute off a pass by Ricardo Clark. It was the 27th goal in 86 international appear­ances for Donovan, who scored in his second straight game after going scoreless in 18 con­secutive national team appear­ances over 1 1/2 years. 
"I think we showed what we're made of," said Conrad, who played an outstanding two­way game. 
But Mexico didn't go quietly in the first game under coach Hugo Sanchez. The Mexicans had nine shots, seven in the sec­ond half, and pressured the Americans relentlessly after Conrad's goal. 
"I think the way the team functioned, the way it looked on the field, left us satisfied," Mexican captain Hafael Marquez said through a transla­tor. "All the same, it hurts because of the rivalry between the two teams and the impor­tance of the match. However, we have to take the positive from the match. We created a lot of opportunities but we just could­n't convert. It's just the begin­ning." 
Sanchez had assembled a vet­eran team in a clear attempt to win rather than evaluate players for the upcoming World Cup cycle. "They made it pretty open that they came to win this game and they were bringing every­body, and maybe mentally now [we] have even more of an advantage," Donovan said. 
Tim Howard, bidding to take over from Kasey Keller as the top American goalkeeper, shut out the Mexicans in his first national team appearance since last May. 
Both teams are preparing for the CONCACAF Gold Cup, the championship of North and Central America and the Caribbean, and the start of 2010 World Cup qualifying next year. 
It was the first game for the Americans against the Tricolores since Sept. 3, 2005, when the United States clinched its fifth straight World Cup berth with a 2-0 victory at Columbus, Ohio. 
Emotions flared late, with Marquez and American forward Eddie Johnson exchanging shoves. After the final whistle, the Mexicans strode off the field without shaking the Americans' hands or exchanging jerseys, as is customary. 
"The sportsmanship -it would be nice if you guys [reporters] and the Mexican press talked about it, because it's really poor." Donovan said. "When we lose to them there, we shake their hands and sav. 'Good job.' There's none of tluit reciprocally, and it's kind of dis­appointing." 
NHL 

Cheechoo doubles up in Sharks' win 
Associated Press 
ANAHEIM, Calif.-Jonathan Cheechoo was worried because his scoring was down this year after he led the league with 56 goals last sea­son. 
He made up some ground on Wednesday night, scoring twice in San Jose's 3-2 victory over Anaheim. Milan Michalek scored on a power play with 
3:46 remaining to give the Sharks the win and a split of their two-night, home-and­home series against the Ducks. 
"I was a little worried because I wasn't getting the chances earlier, so it meant that I was obviously doing something wrong and maybe got into some bad habits," said Cheechoo, who has 20 goals this season. 
"But I've been working hard in practice and trying to do a little extra to get my game back." 
Cheechoo also had two goals in a 7-4 loss to Anaheim the previous night, and usually seems to play well against the Ducks. He had his first career hat trick against them on Dec. 20, 2005. 
"He's been a thorn in our side," Anaheim coach Randy Carlyle said. "He can find those open spaces in the net and he's patient with the puck. He scored two again tonight and we've got to find a way to limit his offensive production." 
Hyane Clowe assisted on all three San Jose goals, and Joe Thornton assisted on both of Cheechoo's scores. 

"Joe's an amazing passer," Cheechoo said. "I got to see it firsthand last year. I've been struggling this year, but he's been kind of finding a way to get me the puck and I'm just letting loose and shooting it." 
The Sharks' victory in the rematch 'moved them back within five points of the Pacific Division-leading Ducks. 
"Our stick-to-itiveness and combativeness were much bet­ter tonight," San Jose coach Ron Wilson said. "It was nice to see some guys who strug­gled get rewarded by getting some big points, like Cheech and Milan. 
"We need those two guys if we're going to do anything as we go through the stretch run here." 
With Anaheim's Joe DiPenta off for hooking and just 3 sec­onds remaining on the ensuing power play, Michalek took a pass from Marc-Edouard Vlasic all alone in the slot and beat Ilya Bryzgalov with a 40­foot slap shot that trickled between the goalie's pads. 
Vesa Toskala made 20 saves for the Sharks, who outshot Anaheim 13-4 in the third period. Bryzgalov stopped 26 shots for Anaheim. 
Teemu Selanne and Shawn 
Thornton  scored  for the  
Ducks.  
Anaheim  captain  Scott  

Niedermayer, in his second game back from a foot injury, blamed himself for the defeat. 
"I can take responsibility for those first two goals. I made bad decisions that allowed them to get those opportuni­ties," the Norris Trophy-win­ning defenseman said. "In close games like that, it comes down to a couple of mistakes or breaks either way." 
Cheechoo pulled the Sharks even at 2 with his second goal of the game, midway through the third period. Thornton, skating down the crease, slid the puck to Cheechoo on the right side. Cheechoo waited for Bryzgalov to commit, then flipped the puck over the goalie's shoulder. 
Shawn Thornton scored 44 seconds into the third period, just his second goal of the sea­son, to give the Ducks a 2-1 lead. 
Selanne had tied it 1-1 at 
14:52 of the second period. The goal was the 36-year-old Selanne's 32nd of the season and 63rd point. 
Following a scoreless first period, Cheechoo put the Sharks ahead at 9:22 of the second. It took more than a minute and a half for the score to go on the board. 
Cheechoo, in the slot on the left, one-timed Thornton's pass from behind the goal line and the puck sailed past Bryzgalov and into the net. But it bounced all the way back out, the red light didn't go on and referee Tim Peel immediately waved it off, even as Cheechoo raised his arms in celebration.

NCAA MEN'S BASKETBALL 
UNC hands rival Duke third straight loss 
Hansbrough, Wright score in double figures 
Associated Press 
DUHHAM, N.C. -The crowd was rowdy and hostile. Duke, determined to end a nagging losing streak, had built a big lead bnhind a surge of emotion. 
Yet North Carolina's young­sters kept coming. And by the end, those Tar Heels had escaped one of college basket­ball's most intimidating arenas with a confidence-building win Wednesday night. 
Freshman Brandan Wright scored 19 points while Tyler Hansbrough added 16 to lead the fifth-ranked Tar Heels past No. 16 Duke 79-73, earning their second straight win in Cameron Indoor Stadium and handing the Blue Devils their first three-game losing streak in nearly eight years. 
Rookie Ty Lawson added 15 points for the Tar Heels (21-3, 7­2 Atlantic Coast Conference), who trailed by 10 points early in the second half before finally going ahead to stay in the final minutes. 
Last year, Hansbrough led a youth-laden group into Cameron to close the regular season and spoil All-American J.J. Redick's final home game in an 83-76 win. And once again, the Tar Heels rallied from a double-digit deficit and came up with the game's big baskets in the final minutes. 
This time, however, the Tar Heels hung around while con­stantly subbing in an endless stream of fresh bodies while pressuring Duke's ballhandlers the entire way. By the time the game was entering its final min­utes, North Carolina looked fresher and found ways to knock down the critical shots against the fast-starting Blue Devils (18­6, 5-5). 
North Carolina didn't take its first lead until there were about 5 minutes left, but shot 59 per­cent after halftime and hit 7 of 8 free throws in the final 31 sec­onds to seal it. 
"We started to get tougher as the game went on, as it starting winding down," said Hansbrough, who scored 12 points in the second half. "That's maybe what we need to do at the beginning of the game, too." 
It was a strong way to bounce back after an surprising week­end loss to North Carolina State -an 83-79 setback that had an irked coach Roy Williams calling his team "fat and happy" after­ward. 
The always-demanding coach won't be saying that now. At least for a while, anyway. 
"I was extremely impressed with how competitive our team was, especially when you com­pare it to what we did last Saturday," Williams said. "We were down 10 a couple of times and I told our guys that if we keep attacking ... that we would be there at the end, and I really felt that way."

After DePaul, Notre Dame returns home for a game against Providence and then travels to Cincinnati. After that, the Blue Demons come to the Joyce Center for a rematch before the Irish host Marquette in their final home game. Notre Dame finishes its season against Rutgers on the road. 
The Irish are currently sixth

beyond the arc. McCoughtry took over the game in the first half, scoring 19 points, including 11 straight for the Cardinals. 
Notre Dame switched to a box­and-one defense at the break and quelled Louisville's offense. 
"I was absolutely thrilled with the defense in the second half," Irish coach Muffet McGraw said. "I thought Brenna [Gray] really shut [McCoughtry] down in the second half when we went to the box-and-one. I thought that was a big key to the win." 
Louisville coach Tom Collen felt poor play, rather than the defensive adjustment, caused his team's second-half melt­down. 
"Obviously it was a tale of two halves," he said. "In the second half they went to a junk defense, they played the box-and-one, and put a . chaser on [McCoughtry]. It didn't really bother us, to be honest with you. We were still scoring on it." 
The Irish trailed by as many as 12 points with 2:25 to go in the first half, but battled back before halftime. Freshman Ashley Barlow hit a 3-pointer with two seconds remaining in the half to pull the Irish within seven. 
"Barlow really made a differ­ence in the game and that's why we started her in the second half," McGraw said. 
Barlow finished with 15 points -her second consecutive dou­ble-figure performance -and six rebounds. 
Notre Dame used second-half scoring runs of 11 and 16 points to seal the game. The first began with 14:13 left and put the Irish

whieh the Irish overcame a 12­point hole, Gray hit a long-range shot that helped curb a Cardinal run and allowed the Irish to cut the growing deficit back into single figures. With 2:05 Inn: in the first half, Gray's shooting nndcd a 10-1 Louisvilln run and helped Notre Dame reduce a 29-17 Louisville lead to nine points. Early in the second half, Gray, who finished with 12 points, shrank the lead l'rom 11 to night and helped kick-start a 12-2 Notre Dame run that gave the Irish their first lead since a 12-11 adwmtage with 10:23 to go in tim opening hall'. 
At times, Gray was loft alone on the pnrimeter and praetically begging l'or the ball and the opportunity to add another bucket to her 4-for-9 total.

"We had that run up against us against West Virginia, and we didn't like it much so we thought we'd try it ourselves," McGraw said jokingly. 
Guard Charel Allen scored five of her 21 points during the sec­ond run. McGraw credited part of Allen's shooting to her team­mates' screens, particularly those by forward Crystal Erwin and center Erica Williamson. 
"My teammates were setting screens for me, and I'm going to take the shot when I'm open," she said. "It just felt good, and most of the time it left my hand, so I continued to shoot." 
The second scoring run ener­gized the Joyce Center crowd.

"Coach Ryan [Dombkowski] and Alicia [Dombkowski] as well as all the team will be strong factors in pumping everyone up and giving them the confidence to swim at their was more often than not the most important Irish player on the court. After the Irish moved out of the zone near the end of the first half, Gray fulfilled her more traditional role of No. 1 defensive stopper, as she was assigned to stopping Louisville forward Angel McCoughtry. 
In the seeond half, Gray held McCoughtry, who had 19 of her 29 poinl'i in the first half ofT of a perfect 5-f(>r-5 shoQting from 3­point range, to just two field goals. And one of those was a putbaek with 53 seconds left in the game. McCoughtry, who McGraw ealled "the best player in the conference" was 0-2 from long-range after halftime. 
"We really wanted to limit her touches, and that's where I think Brn]ona Gray] is just out­standing," McGraw said. "I think she's the best defender in the conference and she went out and didn't let [McCoughtryl get the ball." 
Still, it was Gray's opportune shooting that stood out most Wedm~sday night.

The Irish, who have struggled on the boards, out-rebounded Louisville 34-29 and held the Cardinals to 19 rebounds under their season average. 
McGraw attributed the vast improvement in the second half not only to the defensive change but to individual performances as well. 
"Charel, as always, kept us in the game with her offense. Bre did it with her defense," McGraw said. "We had our points, we rebounded well, we did everything we needed to do defensively doWil the stretch."

NO WOMEN'S BASKETBALL 
Clipping the Cardinals' wings 
By BILL BRINK 
Sports Writer 
A defensive shift at halftime allowed Notre Dame to shut down No. 17 Louisville's offense and erase a seven-point half­time deficit on its way to a 64­55 win at the Joyce Center Wednesday. 
The win was the second time this season the Irish defeated a ranked opponent, the first com­ing against then-No. 10 Purdue Dec. 6 at the Joyce Center. 
Louisville shot over the Irish zone early in the game, helping them grab the early lead. Forward Angel McCoughtry led the Cardinals' 3-point offense, sinking all five of her shots from

Saint Mary's closes out season vvith MIAAs 
By LORENZO REYES Sports Writer 
With only one meet remain­ing, the Belles feel they can fin­ish their season on a high note beginning today at the MIAA championships in Grand Rapids, Mich. 
Saint Mary's finished the reg­ular season 2-7, but the team remains optimistic about its ability to succeed in several events this weekend. The Belles are focused on performing well not only in individual events, but in the relays as well. 
"Personally, I will concentrate on having a strong 200 [yardl back and 500 [yard] free so hopefully I can advance to the finals," freshman Sara Niemann said. "However, I think relays are going to be the key part to our team's success." 
Sophomore Melissa Gerbeth is also confident in her team's ability to perform well at the conference championships. 
"We have a chance to score more points at the meet than we have in a few years, so every placing in the top-12 will be important as far as scoring points is concerned," she said. "It is going to be important for every swimmer to give their maximum effort in order to place well." 
Because the MIAA champi­onship is a three-day meet, the Belles will need to conserve their energy and remain focused for the duration. One way Saint Mary's has tried to stay fresh for this weekend has been a lighter practice sched­ule this week. 
"This last week we started 

and allowed our muscles to relax," freshman Lindsey Nelis said. "Tapering is very impor­tant in order to allow your body to heal as well as gave us a chance to visualize and think about our races." 
Even though the Belles have rested for a week, they are con­fident that once the racing begins they will be able to per­form well. 
"Once we get in the atmos­phere of the championship meet everyone's mental state

Gray's defense, 3-point shooting lead Notre Dame past Louisville 
Hours before Notre Dame's 64­55 win over No. 17 Louisville, senior guard Breona Gray play­fully took shots from the top of the stairs in The Pit, a good 30 feet from the basket. 
And they were going in. 

By the time the game began, the Irish co-captain was still hot from long-distance. Gray, normal­ly a defensive standout, shot 50 percent from beyond the arc and made three of Notre Dame's five 3-point baskets. 
"One of the things we work on is if you're open, shoot it," Gray said. 
Wednesday night, the senior guard, whose .333 shooting per­centage is lower than all but freshman Melissa Lechlitner's .299 in the eight-man rotation, proved why she has started every game for Notre Dame this sea­son. 
Gray, whose 12-point total was only the fourth highest on the night for Notre Dame, hit the biggest shots at the biggest times to help the Irish come from behind and pull out a double-digit win. 
Twice during the game, in which the Irish overcame a 12­point hole, Gray hit a long-range shot that helped curb a Cardinal run and allowed the Irish to cut the growing deficit back into sin­gle figures. With 2:05 left in the frrst half, Gray's shooting ended a 10-1 Louisville run and helped Notre Dame reduce a 29-17 Louisville lead to nine points.

MEN'S BASKETBALL 

Notre Dame travels to DePaul with healthy Kurz 
By CHRIS KHOREY Associate Sports Editor 
Good news and bad news await No. 21 Notre Dame for its game against DePaul in Rosemont, Ill., tonight. 
The bad news is that the Irish are on the road, where the team is just 3-5 this season and where they are coming off a loss to Big East bottom-feed­er South Florida. 
The good news is Notre Dame's leading rebounder, junior forward Rob Kurz, is expected to play his usual 28 minutes against the Blue Demons. Kurz saw limited action in Notre Dame's 69-63 loss to South Florida Saturday because of an ankle injury. 
"[My ankle is] feeling a lot better," Kurz said. "I think it's going to be 100 percent Thursday." 
Kurz, who averages 8.5 rebounds per game, gathered in just one in 19 minutes in the loss to the Bulls. 
"We need him healthy to be at our best," Irish coach Mike Brey said. "He's gotten better each day since Saturday." 
The Irish (18-5, 6-4 Big East) beat Syracuse at the Carrier Dome 103-91 Jan. 30, ending a three-game road losing streak. They fell back to their old road woes with the loss Saturday. 
"We just didn't play tough," Notre Dame point guard Tory Jackson said of the South Florida game. "Things could have gone better, but they got the momentum and we waited too long to fight baek." 
Irish forward Zach Hillesland said Notre Dame ean re-create its effort against the Orange versus DePaul tonight.
