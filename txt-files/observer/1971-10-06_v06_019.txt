Cass Rejent 

By Ann McCarry and Larry Dailey 
The Finance Committee of the Student Senate released late Tuesday afternoon its recom· mendations for the 1971-72 student budget. 
Among those organizations whose requests were denied included the Scholastic, the Finance Forum, and the Kennedy Institute. 
However, Student Government Treasurer Cass Rejent com­mented "considering the entire 
Finance Comm. suggests budget 

situation, the final recom­mendations were the best mix." 
The 1971-72 student b1,1dget totals $82,000, collected from student activity fees. A debt to the University was paid with $9,000 and $1,000 was reserved for surplus. Since budget requests amounted to over $138,000, the I<'inance Committee was forced to make severe cuts to meet the actual student budget of $72,000. 
Approximately $66,000 was trimmed from the official student requests. The most notable cut was made upon he Kennedy Institule. The Finance Com­mittee recommended that it receive none of its $1,968 request. Reject explained that "they already have $5,000 available for spending" and were in a much better position than other clubs. The Student Gopvernment Treasurer blamed the Finance Forum's failure to receive any allocation on "a very poor presentation, coupled with lack of plans concerning future use of the 

Washington-Henry A. Kissinger, the presidential advisor on National Security, will go to Communist China for the second time in three months, to make "concrete .arrangements" for President Nixon's visit to Peking, the White House announced. Kissinger. who emphasized that the recent unexplained events within China had not changed Nixon's plans, will leave for China later this month. 
United Nations, N.Y.--A statement, made by the government of the People's Republic of China on Aug. 20 declaring that it would "have absolutely nothing to do with the United Nations if a two-Ch.ina or a China -andTaiwan situation'' were created, was read into the record of the General Assembly by Albania as a rebuttal to the United States proposal for a dual China representation.

Washington--The chief negotiatiors for the United Mine Workers and the Bituminous Coal Operators Assoc ation were told by Secretary of Labor James D. Hodgson not to use the current freeze on wages and prices as an excuse for failing to reach a contract settlement. The White House was expected to move soon to obtain an injunction or­dering striking longshoremen back to work, as the administration sought to end both strikes. 
.. Washington--A New Jersey businessman told the Senate Commerce Committee that he had paid $2,165.25 per month for the past eight years to a Mafia Chieftan to promote sales of a detergent. He told the senators that the deal did not increase sales and the contract was still good for five more years. 
funds." 
The Scholastic was another one of the victims receiving the Committee's "financial ax." Their major request of $2,000, primarily for a course evaluation form, was denied. 
The Finance Committee suggested that if the booklet was so important, perhaps they could discontinue the printing of two issues and use that money to provide funds for the form. 
A majority of the other requests were reduced by one half to two thirds. 
the Student Government received $15,500 of its $16,925 request. The Student Union, Student Life Fund, International Students Organization, Free University and Day Care Center also fared quite well. 
Commenting on their success, Rejact said that several organizations showed "definite advantages" to the student body and were well presented. 
He stated that the entire committee had an "extremely difficult time, since it is hard to 
Double standards at ND infirntary? 
by Andy Winiarczyk 

There has been much con­trov~rsy over the fact that though Nctre Dame and St. Mary's are merging they cannot share many of the same services. 
At times a Notre Dame student is considered a "foreigner" on the Saint Mary's campus and a 
Saint Mary's resident is not 
considered a "Notre Dame
student." A case in point is the Student Infirmary. 
Marcia Moczek stated that she almost became a serious victim of the university's split policy towards the students from St. Mary's. 
During the past week, an un­fortunate accident occurred to Moczek in the Chemistry lab at Nieuwland Hall. She was at­tending a 2 P.M. chemistry lab under the direction of Professor ' Walter Scheidt and in the course of performing the experiment she accidentally jammed a mercury thermometer into the middle finger of her left hand and began to bleed profusely. 
Professor Scheidt took her to the ND Infirmary to receive immediate treatment. Marcia claimed' "I was initially refused medical attention on the grounds take money from such wor­thwhile projects. We would have liked to have allocated more, but were forced to pay a debt this year." 
He stated that the entire committee had an "extremely difficult time, since it is hard to take money from such wor­thwhile projects. We would have liked to have allocated more, but were forced to pay a devt this ysar." 
Rejent also mentioned several innovative steps being taken this year, in regard to budget requests. Only the total amount of the Student Government's and Student Union's requests were trimmed. Contrary to previous procedure, the Finance Com­mittee did not state what each individual department should be allotted. 
"This allows financial decisions to be made by those immediately responsible," Rejent explained.

Investigation of robbery in Grace still inconclusive

She further stated, "I was in a great deal of pain. When they noticecl that I was bleeding the Infirmary provided emergency care." 
"Temporary emergency aid" consisted of putting water on the wound, dropping a few particles. of iodine on it to ease the pain, cleaning it with phisohex, and placed a bandage on it.

not available for comment on the subject due to illness. However, Jerry McGlinn, the guard han­dling the case, did make a statement. 
McGlynri noted that, "at this time," they had no definite in­formation as to the description of the robbers or their ap­prehension. He also stated that the investigation was far from complete and they WP.re doing all they could to solve the case. The description that he did have of the burgulars was that they were of 
"student age  but  probably  not  
students."  
He  also  stated  that  the  St.  

Joseph County Police have been involved since last night and that the County Police and Campus Security were conducting the investigation together. 
The regular policy, McGlynn explained, was for security to conduct an investigation and call in the County Police whenever necessary. 
When asked why the in­vestigator did not arrive at the scene of the crime until twenty­three minutes after it was reported, McGlynn said that it was not his place to comment and he reserved comment for Mr. Pears. 
When asked for a statement Fr. Whelac the rector of Grace, said that he "really wouldn't like to make any comment at all." 
Mike Meara, robbery victim, stated that he was satisfied with the investigation and that the police were "doing everything th­zy can possibly do." He pointed out that the robbery took place on the ninth floor and that people were all around, and that the robbers walked right in and right out.

He suggested possibly handling people accused of larceny or assault over to state or federal authorities. It was the general opinion of some students that parietal hours were unenforceable. A student who identified himself as a junior from Badin, suggested that the Trustees should make their own sanctions and then try to enforce  them. "They would find it enlightening," he added.

Murtaugh, acting as calmly as 
if he were rocking lazily in one of 
his various rocking chairs, told 
Bob Johnson to warm up, and 
Johnson, a self-proclaimed 
pitching "dud" this season, 
proceeded to pitch his best game 
of the year as the Pirates 
defeated San Francisco, 2-1, on 
home runs by Bob Robertson and 
Richie Hebner. 
Hebner's homer, one of only four 
hits off Juan Marichal, snapped a 
1-1 tie in the eighth inning and 
catapulted the Pirates into a 2-1 
lead in the best -of-five series 
that will determine the Baltimore 
Orioles' opponent in the World 
Series starting Saturday. 
The Pirates get a cha nee to 
become that opponent today 
when Steve Blass pitches against 
Gaylord Perry, the gritty right­
hander who beat them in the 
playoff opener. 
Marichal, who won 18 games 
this season, co1,11dn't have been 
much better, but his teammates 
failed to come through with just 
one key hit in any of three innings 
in which they had Johnson in 
danger. 
They put the first two batters 
on in the second inning, but 
Johnson struck out Dick Dietz on 
a 3-2 pitch (after being 3-0), got 
Alan Gallagher to ground into a 
force play and struck out Chris 
Speier. 
In the sixth, they scored their 
only run on Ken Henderson's 
single and a throwing error by 
Hebner but couldn't do anything 
else with runners at first and 
second and only one out. 
Then in the eighth, Johnson's 
last inning <he left for a pinch 
hitter and Dave Giusti finished 
upl, Willie Mays got San Fran­
cisco's fifth hit with one out, stole 
second before Bonds walked 
with two out and then 
remained there as Dietz forced 
Bonds. 
Minutes later, Hebner, to the 
accompaniment of lusty boos 
from many in the crowd of 38,322 
because of his costly error, came 
to bat with two out and dove a 1-2 
screwball from Marichal toward 
the right field wall. The ball 
sailed about 365 feet and eluded 
the glove of the leaping Bonds by 
inches for the third baseman's 
first home run in seven weeks. 
In the second inning, Robert­
son, who before Sunday hadn't 
homered in six weeks, connected 
for his third homer in his last 
three times at bat and his fourth 
in his last five.

Despite its 3-o record, Notre Dame continued to drop in both the Associated Press and United Press International football polls this week.
