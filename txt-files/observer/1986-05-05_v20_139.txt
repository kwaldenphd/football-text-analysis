Tutu writes to priest as fast enters fifth week 
By BILL D. MORRIS 
NewsSraff 
Bishop Desmond Tutu, Jesse Jackson andChicago mayor Harold Wahington have all recently of­fered support for Father Basil van Rensburg as the visiting South African priest enters the fifth week afhis fast tomorrow. 
Van Re nsburg, who is fasting in an effort to get the Board of Trustees to vote for divestment at its meeting this weekend, received a telegram from Tutu last Wednes­day. 
"We support your resolute stand and hope that the trustees of Notre Dame will take the right moral decision," Tutu's telegram said. 
On Saturday, Van Re:nsburg held a press conference in Chicago which was attended by Washington and Jackson. At the conference, 
Jackson  delivered  a  speech  and  
prayer, Van Rensburg said.  
Also sending their support  was  

the Bishops Council of South Africa said Van Rensburg. 
The Council has also issued its strongest plea to the west for economic sanctions above and beyond divestment, he said. 
"Joyfully, peacefully, prayerful­ly," is how Van Rensburg described his progress. "It has brought me closer to the Supreme Being." 
Van R·ensburg under the strict supervision of medical advisors, has retained excellent health. Sus­tained by water, Van Rensburg cur­rently weighs 174 pounds, down from the 209 pounds that he called his "corporate paunch."

SMC students receive obscene calls from fake pollster of sex attitudes 
ByCINDYHAU 
News Staff 
Several Saint Mary's students recently have received obscene phone calls from someone sup­posedly conducting a sexuality survey for the National Education Association, according to Saint Mary's Director of Safety /Security Richard Chlebek. 
A representative of the education organization said, however, it is not conducting a sexuality survey. 
"From time to time, we get a call asking if we're conducting the survey. That's how we know (the caller) is still making the calls," said the representative, who asked that her name not be used. 
One student, who said she receiv­ed a call, said she did not realize it was a prank until she hung up because the caller "sounded so con­vin,cing and legitimate." 
"(The caller.) asked all of the questions, even the obscene ones, in total seriousness," she said. 
"(The caller) started out, asked general questions about my family and raising children -'How many brothers and sisters do I have?' 'Do I feel I was raised well?' 'Can I got to my parents when I have pro­blems?' " she said. 
"Then(the caller) started asking questions about my attitudes toward sexuality and incestual rela­tionships. I began to feel uncom­fortable and hung up," she said. 
Chlebek said Saint Mary's students were alerted to the obscene phone calls after approximately six ladies reported receiviag them. 
"Each student received a flier in her mailbox concerning the anonymous caller," Chlebek said. 
Although the problem does not 

· seem to be widespread, Chlebek said he believes there may have been women who simply hung up on the caller and did not report it. He said his advice to women who receive the phone calls is the "same advice your parents gave you ­don't talk to strangers." "Students should not "plav.~ · tive or become clever .wtfh the caller, as it onI': -<ncourages (the caller)," C.bkotk said. If a student does receive an obscene call, Chlebek said she 
should report it to Security im­mediately. AIthought there are no records of any woman receiving more than one of the obscene calls, students who have recieved one can ask to have their calls screened by Security, he said. 
The calls were reported shortly after spring break, but students hav e recieved them since early first semester, according to some Saint Mary's students. 
"l never reported it because 1 felt so dumb for not just hanging up," said one student, who spoke on the condition her name not be used. 
Another student, who also asked her name not be used, said the caller probably had not chosen to call Saint Mary's specifically, because other area women also received calls. 
"(The caller) called in the middle of the afternoon and was very sincere," one student said, "but when (the caller) asked if I heard of the survey from anyone else, I got suspicious and hung up. Then (the caller) called my neighbor and on down the hall." 


SMC speaker's 'pro choice' stance to draw protests 
By THERESA GUARINO 
Senior StaffReporter 
Pickets and protesters will ac­company caps, gowns and degrees at Saint Mary's commencement ceremony this year. 
A demonstration planned by local anti-abortion groups is scheduled for graduation day in protest of commencement speaker Congresswoman Barbara Kennelly of Connecticut. (Related story, page 3.) 
Opponents say that according to Congressional records, Kennelly has a pro-choice voting record in the House of Representatives. 
Organizations planning on picketing include St. Joseph Coun­ty Right to Life, Democrats for Life and several area Protestant churches. 
Burnie Bauer, national president of Democrats for Life, an anti­abortion caucus in the Democratic Party, said Kennelly voted pro­choice in four of the five roll call votes dealing with abortion in 1985 in the House of Representatives. Kennelly was absent for one of the votes, Bauer said. 
In an interview with the Observer Thursday, Kennelly said she would rather not address the pro-choice issue on the phone because of its complexity. 
"Canon law says anyone who helps another procure an abortion is excommunicated," said Bauer. "By voting as she did, she's helping someone." 
Bauer said he sent letters to Col­lege President William Hickey and members of the Board of Regents, expressing his dissatisfaction with Kennelly. In the letter he asked that Saint Mary's either withdraw its invitation or announce publicly and during Kennelly's introduction that the College is honoring Ken­nelly despite her stance on abor­tion. 
Bauer also said he "sent letters directly to the regents that he knew" and mailed the rest of the letters in care of Saint Mary's. According to Bauer, one regent, whom he declin­ed to name, has contacted him and expressed support for the group's position. 
Hickey said he was "completely surprised" upon learning of the planned protests and called it "an unfortunate situation." 
Hickey said Kennelly is a "devout practicing Catholic who has demonstrated clearly how one can effectively use the legal system in Congress to promote women's rights." 
"She (Kennelly) is a person who has fought very hard for women and now is being chastised," Hickey said. 
Kennelly is responsible for many bills promoting child care, the family and women's equity, accor­ding to Hickey. He also said he finds the protest difficult to understand when Kennelly's record is objectively assessed. 
"Every group has a right to their opinion but they also have the responsibility of being objective under each question and situation." 
Virginia Black, a member of the bmrrd of directors of St. Joseph County Right to Life, said that in a vote last week, the board decided unanimously to picket the com­mencement ceremony. Black called

Trustees to discuss minorities, divestment 
By JIM RILEY 
Copy Editor 
An increase in the student ac­tivities fee and a report on minority student issues will be discussed by the student affairs committee of the Board of Trustees on Thursday, said Bill Healy, a student representative to the committee. 
The Board of Trustees as a whole, in their annual meeting Friday, will review the Univer­sity's divestment policy and discuss the replacement of Father Theodore Hesburgh as University president, according to William Sexton, vice presi­dent University Relations and secretary of the Board. 
When the chairman of the Board, Thomas Carney, con­cluded discussion on University investments at last October's in­terim Board meeting, "a com­mitment was made for a review of the policy six months later to examine its effectiveness," ..said Sexton. He also said it would be reasonable to expect this ex­amination of the investment policy to take up a comparative­ly large time of the Board's meeting, which will last all day Friday. 

The chairmen of seven com­mittees, including the student affairs committee, will make presentations to the Board Fri­day, according to Sexton. 
The student affairs committee is considering an increase in the student activity fee from $35 to $55, said Healy. Five dollars of the fee increase would be ear­marked for WVFI. Proceeds from the balance of the fee in­crease would be distributed among student government, the 
classes  and  various  clubs  and  
organizations.  
The  committee  will  also  

discuss a report on the problems see TRUSTEES, page 5

Xenophobia: dropping a big word 
Only two people died, the Russians said at first. The world, especially those people in the Scan­dinavian countries, knew differently. 
Why would the Russians make such a feeble at­tempt to hide such a major disaster from its neighbors to the West, neighbors who were affected by the catastrophe, who had significant evidence that a malfunction had occurred and who had the technology to assist in helping the Russians cope with the crisis? 
Looking back through my years of high school and college government courses, one word sticks in my mind when describing Russia, "xenophobia,'' fear of the foreign. My professors always emphasiz­
ed  this  word  as  a  starting  point  toward  
understanding  the  Russian  people's  secretive  
posture.  

I remember my Western Civilization professor in high school telling the class to go home and drop the big word on our parents as a sign of how much we were learning. 
Now several years later, another incident arises which indicates the Russian government still refuses, to the point of jeopardizing the lives of its citizens and its neighboring countries' safety, to publicly recognize failure on its part and to seek outside assistance to correct this failure. The difference in the Amencan and Russian perspectives could not be clearer. The American response to the Three Mile Island accident was much more pronounced although much less serious. 
In the recent Russian mishap, the Russian public was barely informed, let alone alerted. One wonders if the incident would have been reported at all if the outside world lacked the monitoring equipment it has. 
Several decades ago, 30 villages disappeared from Russian maps. What happended to these small towns remains a mystery. 
Canvassing the Russian landscape, the silent posture does work to their advantage in many in­stances, although certainly not in this most recent one. 
The New York Times, if one scanned it closely enough Friday, had a four-paragraph note on the seven-year war in Afghanistan. What made the arti­cle of special note was that it said the fighting had reached an all-time high; however, what kept the ar­ticle so brief was a lack of information. 
The brief relied totally on rebel leaders' assessments of the situation. No one from the Soviet or Afghan forces were cited. 
"Afghan rebel commanders said today that Soviet and Afghan warplanes were killing and maiming hundreds of their men in nonstop raids on rebel posi­tions,'' The Times stated. 
In the next paragraph, the article cited a senior rebel commander as "calling it the heaviest aerial bombardment" ever amassed against the rebels. 
Yet, for all of this, the notice was a brief on page five. 
The Soviets' natural tendency for silence and the manner in which they have helped make it extremely difficult for outsiders to report on the Afghan war have created a virtual news blackout on the struggle. 
It is much easier for reporters to cover newer, more accessible and safer events than an old war with little at stake except the freedom of an unim­portant people who have been forgotten by the West. 
Joe Murphy 

Edltor-ln.Chlef 

The free world has a short attention span, and the Russians know this. At present, the "hot spots" are Libya and South Africa. Beirut and Nicaragua and Ethiopia are moving to the backburners of public in­terest. The front pages are now filled with more im­portant things. 
Yet, to the people of Afghanistan their daily strug­gle is as important as ever. To the people of Ethiopia, though a recent Times brief mentioned the worst is over for them, the struggle for food con­tinues not for a day, but forever. Yet, the attention and, thus, the assistance they now receive have decreased dramatically. 
Combining the West 's short attention span and the Russian's desire to keep the West's attention even shorter threatens the West's long-term future. If the Russians use their position in Afghanistan to move on Iran at some point in the future, the gain would strike at Western interests and boost Russian's oil capacity and give it a warm-water port. 
Such scenarios are no more unlikely than a nuclear facility malfunctioning in Russia. 
The West does not need to pay greater attention to Russian actions, but more sustaining attention. The situation is no more resolved in Afghanistan today than seven years ago, and the same issues of world security and Afghan freedom which then prompted such an enormous plethora of Western news coverage still exist today. 
What the West, and specifically Western reporters, must do is monitor the Russians over the long-term development of specific events such as keeping the world informed of the changes in Rus­sian nuclear posture over the next several years as a result of this recent disaster. 
Ironically, if the Russians had notified the West immediately of the problems at the Cherobyl nuclear power plant, the reaction of the West may have been one of gratitude rather than outrage. All of Mikhail Gorbachev's public relations efforts lie in the rubble in Cherobyl. His repeated calls for a new openness ring hollow. 
Next fall, I am taking a course on the Soviet Union. I suspect my professor will cite the Cherobyl incident as evidence xenophobia continues to shape Russian political philosophy.

the demonstration "routine" and said that the group "has no choice." 
We have to do everything we can to change this, including working in the political arena," Black said. 
Protestors will not enter College grounds, since that is private pro­perty, but plan to picket the en­trance to the College at the front gate. Black said that the group is currently in the process of inform­
ing  its  members  of  the  
demonstration.  
Bauer,  a  former  Indiana  state  

senator and representative, pointed 
to five abortion-related roll caB votes taken by the House in 1985. The votes dealt with matters rang­ing from a condemnation of China's forced abortion policy to the restriction of U.S. funding of abortion facilities in foreign coun­tries and in the District of Colum­bia. In the five votes, Kennelly voted pro-choicr on four, and was absent for one, Bauer said. 
Hickey said that all five votes were votes on one of many amend­ments to major bills in Congress. For example, the vote condemning and withholding funding for Chinese state-forced abortions was part of a $13 billion U.S. foreign aid bill, according to Hickey. "China is one of hundreds of na­tions that the U.S. sends aid to," Hickey said. 

Bauer said he believes that by choosing Kennelly, Saint Mary's is setting up a negative role model to graduates. 
Hickey said that Kennelly was researched and approved by the Board of Regents, who are "pleased with their choice." 
He compared the situation to the demonstrations surrounding the choice of Salvadoran President Jose Napoleon Duarte as Notre Dame's commencement speaker last year. "There were protestors, but they were given their chance and didn't disrupt or interrupt the ceremony. The graduation went well and so will ours."

Kennelly: 'I'm honored to speak at College' 
By MARGIE KERSTEN 
Saint Mary's Editor 
"I was quite delighted and honored to be asked to speak at Saint Mary's commencement,'' said Barbara Kennelly, the College's 1986 commencement speaker. 
Kennelly, a Connecticut Con­gresswoman since 1982, said she usually speaks at one or more graduations each year and enjoys doing it. 
Kennelly said she can gice graduates an interesting perspective because of her background at a woman's college and said she may also serve as a role model to students. 
Several pro-life groups are plan­ning to picket the commencement ceremonies because of what they call Kennelly's pro-choice votes on several bills in Congress. 
When asked about her position on the abortion issue, Kennelly said she would "rather not address that issue on the phone," because of its complexity. 
Kennelly received a B.A. in economics from Trinity College in Washington D.C. and completed the Harvard-Radcliffe Program in Business Administration. She earn­ed a Master's Degree in Govern­ment from Trinity College in Hart­ford, Conn. 
Kennelly said she has not chosen her topic for the speech yet but add­ed, "I put a lot of time into the talks and I have talked to as many young people as I can. I try to address their concerns and thoughts and ask them what they would like to hear." 
Kennelly has worked in the local, state, and congressional levels of politics and said, "I like politics and I am content as a public official." She said the most impor:_tant asset in a career is to "believe in yourself and what you are doing. Prove you can do a job and do it well." 
Women have a good future in politics, Kennelly said. "There will definitely be more women in the lower levels of government but it is more difficult to move up." She said this difficulty increases as a woman rises in politics, citing that there are only 22 women out of the 435 members in the house of Representatives today. 
She said the. first woman presi­dent is "not far away," but it might be better for women to be vice president and then "go for the top spot." She said she would "con­sider" running for president some­day. 
"Economic issue are the most im­portant issues for women to be con­cerned about today," Kennelly said. There is an increase in the number of women working and she said she would like to see the pay and pension protection of workers improved. 
Because of Kennelly,s background at a woman,s college, she said she can "relate to the graduating students and has a feel­ing of deja vu" when she addresses those audiences. 
. Saint Mary's will award Kennelly an honorary doctor of laws degree at the commencement ceremonies on May 17.

Hickey's early plans did not include presidency 
By MARGIE KERSTEN 
Saint Mary's Editor 
When he came to Saint Mary's as a part-time biology professor in 1960, William Hickey's plans did not include becoming College president, he said. Twenty-six years later, however, Hickey is doing just that. 
"My definite goal was to pursue a department chair position and then dean of faculty, which I did," said Hickey in a recent inter­view. 
Hickey said that when he was acting president for the first time, in 1974-75, many people en­couraged him to apply for the presidency. But after looking at all his options, he decided not to become a candidate at that time. 
When the position became available again this year, however, Hickey said he "felt the exact opposite this time." He said he did not want to leave his post as acting president and return to his position as the dean of facul­ty. 
Hickey said he sees "exciting things happening academically in the future." One thing that will happen is the creation of an addi­tional writing requirement at the College. This "advanced W,"

the already existing programs," he 
said. 

The lack of minorities presently 
enrolled at Saint Mary's may 
hinder future minority recruit­
ment, Hickey said. A vicious cir­
cle may be in effect because the 
admissions office may attempt to 
recruit from a lower economic 
region, with minorities, but 
once the prospective students find 
out how many other minority 
students, or faculty are at Saint 
Mary's, they are discouraged. 
Interaction with students is even more important now than ever before, said Hickey. "There are ways that I am in constant touch with students," he said. 
Hickey said he is concerned with the feelings, questions and academic concerns of students and the entire institution. This year, Hickey has hosted open­door sessions every Monday afternoon from 3-5 where students could stop in without an appointment and discuss whatever was on their mind. Hickey said he plans to continue this for next year as well. 
"The key is ongoing com­munications. Many differences can be avoided if communication lines are kept open and used," he said.

Sixth floor of library to close 
By BETH CORNWELL 
StaffReporter 
The sixth floor of the Memorial 
Library will soon be closed to 
students because of planned expan-. 
sions of the University Archives 
and the Charles and Margaret Hall 
Cushwa Center for the Study of 
American Catholicism, acc<'..~ng 
to the library's Associate ~r 
George Sereiko. 
All of thf" ~1'" carrols on the 
floor h.;i.Ye already been removed, 
in preparation for the construction, 
he said. The carrols will be 
relocated in other parts of the 
library, he added. 
"Essentially, the sixth floor will 
no longer be a part of the library 
facilities," said Sereiko. 
According to Wendy Schlereth, University archivist, the work will consist mainly of "knocking down some walls and putting others up." The construction probably will start two weeks after commence­ment and will last about six weeks, said Schlereth. 
The expansion is necessary primarily to accomodate the University's growing collection of archives. The bulk of the . con­struction will focus on the archives space, although the Cushwa Center will also be enlarged, said Schlereth. 
The various collections of documents kept in the archives in­clude University records, back files from the admissions department, and administrative records. The ar­chives also serves as a repository for such periodicals as Com­monweal Magazine and the Na­tional Catholic Register.

touting a beer special, between 150 and 200 people were crowded into Duffy's at 12:30 a.m. when the raid occurred, according to one of those at the party, who asked that her name not be used. 

When approximately I0 officers arrived at the tavern, at 1150 Mishawaka Ave., the officers led the students out and checked them for proper identification, the witness said. Those without an J.D. were issued a $46 citation and allowed to leave, she said. 
Between 25 and 30 students avoided the citations by hiding in the tavern's cellar, while others showed false IDs, she said. 
Althcug_h officers brought a paddy wagon and seeral police cars, they only took away the three handcuffed students, the witnesses said. 
According to the owner of Duf­fy's, Burke Hammond, the number of patrons Thursday night "had gotten out of hand. But · they weren't causing any trouble what­soever. They were behaving themselves perfectly." 
Because the party was not a private one, not all those attending were from Notre Dame or Saint Mary's, the witness said.

Promoting social welfare has improved Church 
Saint Mary's speaker: Aiding contras harmful 
As I near the completion of three years as President of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops, it occurs to me that I have had the interesting experience of seeing a familiar American axiom turned upside down. Never speak about religion or politics if you want to keep your friends, the old say­ing goes. But we have recently seen the Church talk with considerable vitality not only about these two topics but, more impor­tantly, on the ways in which they relate to each other for the common good of our pluralistic society. It is my view that the Church has gained credibilty in the process. 
Bishop James Malone 
guest column 

I hasten to dispel any notion that as outgo­ing President of the NCCB, I somehow claim credit for this phenomenon. If humility did not compel me to make such a disclaimer, a recognition of the intelligence of the readers of this publication surely would. I do not denigrate the contributions of any individual or group when I submit that a combination of the needs of the age and the supernatural dynamic of the Church have converged to make the message of the Gospel particularly compelling in the present day. Let me il-
Perhaps no issue before the Ccngress to­day has been more contentious than the question of aid for the contras fighting in Nicaragua. The argument has been heated; the rhetoric florid; the congressional tempers short. But as a member of a bipartisan con­gressional delegation visiting heads of state in Brazil, Argentina, and Venezuela, I had conversations with leaders who were able to shed more light and less heat on the issue. Our democratic neighbors to the south do not believe American intervention in Central America is in their -or our -best interest. I agree. 
Barbara B. Kennelly 
guest column 

Many of Latin America's democracies are new ones, but despite their youth, these na­tions are fierce in their dedication to their democratic institutions and unyielding in their commitment to preserve them. We in rhe United States should feel proud that the overwhelming majority of our neighborhoods to the south share our belief in democracy. 
The leaders of these nations have no illu­sions about Nicaragua. They view Daniel Ortega and his Sandinista henchmen as a real threat to their peace and security. Yet they do not want the United States to support the contras who oppose them. The leaders I met with offered three reasons for their views: 
First, they believe that the worldwide focus on American involvement in Central America tends to obscure an equally serious problem: the Soviet presence in that region. These leaders do not sleep easier at night knowing that there are Soviet and Cuban ad­visers in Nicaragua. They do not feel their own democracies are safer because the Soviet 
-;... 
"ONE." 

lustrate this point by referring to two "events" in which I have had the privilege of being directly involved. The first is the Ex­traordinary Synod of 1985, which I attended by virtue of the office I hold, and the other is the series of pastoral statements of our bishops, and notably the statement on the economy, over whose adoption I expect to preside at my final meeting as President of the NCCB this November. 
The Extraordinary Synod was devoted to the Second Vatican Council of 20 years earlier. Its purpose was to recall the Coun­cil's teaching, recapture its spirit, and renew the Church in the ongoing effort to imple­ment its 16 documents. 
The "Message to the People of God" from theExtraordinary Synod declared the Coun­cil to be "the great grace of this century" of the Church. This evaluation was a central conclusion of the Synod, and it is one which cannot be stressed too often. This approach emphasized Vatican II's understanding of the Church through a series of relationships. The Constitution of the Church stressed first the relationship of the Church to God: the Church is created not by human initiative but by the action of the Father who sends his Son to us as our redeemer; the Son sends the Spirit, and the Holy Spirit is the soul of the Church. The work of the Holy Spirit shapes the second set of relationships--among the people of the Church. The Council's stress 
Union provides arms to Nicaragua. Yet it is difficult for them to mobilize public opinion against the Soviet presence when their citizens are so much more aware of the possibility of American intervention. We make their task much more difficult with unrestrained rhetoric abo:.~t the contras. 
Second, South American leaders were con­cerned that U.S. support for the contras might actually weaken democracy in the region. They believe that U.S. involvement in Nicaragua would provide a convenient focus for extremist opposition to their own governments. New democracies are fragile democracies, and their leaders fear they might not withstand the ignition of popular sentiment against Yankee intervention. The United States, which has trodden so heavily through Latin America in the past, would serve its aJlies better by being aware of this reality. 
Finally, and perhaps most important, the leaders I met with told the Congressional delegation that aid to the contras only makes it more difficult to achieve their goal of a negotiated regional settlement through the Contadora process. In fact, many of these leaders seemed to believe that aid to the con­tras was a foregone conclusion, and that nothing could stop this administration from pursuing a military solution in Nicaragua. There is an overwhelming sense of frustra­tion among these leaders; they feel increas­ingly unable to deal with the situation. 
The delegation did what we could to stif­fen Contadora resolve. We told them they had to do more than show moral outrage at military intervention,-and that they themselves must suggest and be willing to in­volve themselves in concrete solutions, such as the economic isolation of Nicaragua or even a regional peace-keeping force. 
But actions speak louder than words, and, two weeks ago, the House acted. By on the fact that we are all responsible, active members of the Church, and its call to a style of ministry which engages the gifts of all members, have dominated the pastoral agen­da for 20 years. 
But the Council's relational perspective was not confined within the Church. Its basic thrust was outward, to promote and foster a series of relationships by Catholics with others precisely as an expression of Christ's love at work in the world. Whether one looks at ecumenical relations in the past two decades, or the Church's involvement in the social and political issues of our day, the experience of the Church has propelled it outward, creating possibilities for service and witness which were only dimly seen at the Council. 
This background also provides the key to understanding the Bishops' efforts to develop positions and procedures which both speak to central moral questions in our na­tion and do so in a way which effectively relates to our democratic pluralistic society. In addressing issues from abortion to the plight of farmers, human rights to foreign policy, nuclear questions, or Catholic social teaching and the U.S. economy, the purpose of the Bishops has oeen to make available to all members of the Church and to the wider society the resources of Catholic moral teaching. Such efforts could hardly come at 
parliamentary maneuvering or just plain luck, we delayed aid to the contras once again, for a month or more. A window of opportunity has opened. This is time we should use wisely, to shore up and assist the Contadora process. The Contadora negotia­tions -shaky as they are -remain the only vehicle for a settlement in Latin America, and our best hope for peace. Without our support, Contadora cannot succeed; with our support, it may. 
It is becoming obvious to both opponents and supporters of contra aid that 100 million dollars requested by the President will not buy a contra victory. It is only a down pay­ment on continued death and suffering. It 
Keep moving on in present with hopeful eye on future 
I remember writing a welcome to the in­coming classes last August. Itseems like just yesterday. A beautiful fall, a so-so winter, nice spring so far and, suddenly, end of school year, graduation. Where did the year go? Where they all go, ever more quickly as one gets older, future sliding into past so quickly it's difficult to grasp the present. And yet, we must, because the present is all we really have, the past is only a memory, the future only a hope. 
Fr. Theodore Hesburgh 
guest column 

The present is a kind of relief for freshmen; made it thus far, now only exams. For sophomores, the present is already half way through, over the mid mark and down the other side. For juniors, it's arriving at last to senior status, the top of the pile. For seniors, the present is nostalgia, can't really be over so soon, staring reality in the face, graduate school, job, marriage, moves, moves, moves, decisions, decisions. 
Life is a moving stream, now calm, now turbulent, now challenging, now lazy and slow moving. We all have to face it on our own with some help from the grace of God and good friends and family. However pac­ed, we have to keep moving. Dark days, bright days, no matter, we move on, reaching another in a long series of goals or falling short. 
For those who graduate, it is a goal well reached, and greatly to be enjoyed with will drain us financially; far worse, it will diminish us as a nation. 
The United States is the oldest and strongest democracy in the hemisphere. Our economic and military leadership is beyond dispute. But we have the opportunity to pro­vide moral leadership as well, by lending our active support to the Contadora process and to the search for peace in Central America.. The sooner we begin, the better off we -and our friends to the south -will be.

a more opportune time. There is increasing recognition throughout our society that the questions which most deeply divide our na­tion are moral ones, whose solution will con­tinue to elude our grasp if we remain bereft of a moral consensus. It is here that the Church has a monumental contribution to make, but it will not be made without pain. As the Synod also served to remind us, the ''theology of the cross" is part of the Chris­tian message too, and the integration of the Church's vision and the world's does not always proceed harmoniously. 
A final word about the Bishops' Pastoral on the economy. Like its earlier drafts, it will be both praised and condemned. It will have much to please/displease Democrats and Republicans alike. During the debate, we must never lost sight of the fact that, more important than the pastoral's specific policy recommendations, important as these are, is its essential Christian message of the dignity of the human person. Because I have seen much evidence that this message is both understood and grasped by men and women who are graduating from our Catholic col­leges and universities in 1986, I do not fear for the future of our Church or our country.

family and friends, but not for long. Other goals beckon, time continues to march, we gulp and keep moving. 
All this really tells us is that we can only 

thank God for what has passed well, be sorry 
for what has passed badly, do our best to 
keep moving forward in the present, and live 
in hope of good days and new goals to be at­
tained in the future. The worst of all is not to 
have learned from past successes and failures, 
not to be really alive and striving in the pre­
sent, or to lose hope for the future. The 
future is the place and time where we get 
another chance. Thank God for that. We can 
all do better. 
I think it was a French writer, Leon Bloy, who said in his book, "La Femme Pauvre": "The only real failure in life is not to be a saint." On that scale of judgment, I think most of us taste failure, but there is a fall­back position: we can all keep trying and pray for more help. 
My bottom line, at the end of my fifty­second year at Notre Dame, is to wish the seniors--God speed and well done; the juniors--you're almost there; the sophomore­-two down, two to go, give it your best; the freshmen--at least there will be a class below you next year. Have a great summer and come back safely. 
I have to circle the globe twice this sum­mer, once for peace with stops in Moscow, Beijing, and Tokyo, and once for refugees in Europe, Africa, Southeast Asia, and the Far East. And then, the final year of an all too long presidency. Thanks for your affection and patience. I hope it doesn't sound phony or banal when I say, I love you all. 

Every student at Oxford University in England receives a grant to pay for school. And recently, because the British economy has turned (or should I say remained?) 

i: anemic, and because one in seven Brits is out of work, the govenment decided this year that it's time to cut back on what it gives to students--by about 2 percent. 
Bob Vonderheide 
from oxford 
Here at Oxford, you would have thought Maggie Thatcher had closed the University. The undergraduates were out in full force one Friday afternoon, about 2,000 of them all told, and they were screaming and yelling that somebody was not making them very happy. Groups of them held aloft placards indicating that their particular residential college would not stand still for such an in­justice. From University College, where I live, came the wisdom, ''Univ says the Tories stink!" And from Merton, "Thatcher! That­cher! Out! Out!" One poster in particular caught my attention. It was from Jesus Col­lege, a school once intended to educate Catholic youths from Wales. In plain black letters, the poster declared, "Jesus says no to cuts." 
Does He really? 
These 2,000 undergraduates. unaware of their rather hilarious irony, marched past another place in Oxford that makes me laugh. Itis Magpie Lane, a street whose name is second in charm only, I think, to Logic Lane. Street signs in Oxford are engraved on huge steel plaques, bolted to the walls of this ancient city for all eternity--except one sign for Magpie Lane. This plaque is smaller, and posted higher, ostensibly to be out of reach of drunken students and tourists in search of souvenirs after the pubs close. But the in­scription is what endears the sign to me. It reads, "Magpie Lane. Formerly Grove Street." 

When, I ask, was it Grove Street? 1650? 1910? On one hand, the sense of history that swallows this place makes it seem rather ap­propriate that the city engineers should decide to tell us what the streets used to be called. But on the other hand, Oxford is a ci­ty also founded on imprecision. Strangers seeking directions must ask three locals and combine their stories before setting out again with confidence. Tower bells from all around the city ring for about five minutes on either side of the hour so that you know, well, it's about nine o'clock. Signs will direct you to public toilets, but when you get close, that last (and necessary) sign seems to be missing. That's why Magpie Lane, formerly Grove Street, strikes me as odd. Just once, when told that the best way to Merton Col­lege from High Street is a trek down Magpie Lane, I would like to ask, "Do you mean Grove Street?" That's right. Magpie Lane, formerly Grove Street. 
Into this university of total irony, a school built in the 11th century which now reluc­tantly finds itself in 1986, Notre Dame's two newest Rhodes Scholars will arrive this fall. No doubt Tess Doering and Gred Abowd are beside themselves. This time last year, it was I who had just been struck with a feeling of sustained excitement that within two days of finally arriving in Oxford, I wandered around the streets taking pictures of this and that and quickly whisking them home to show Mom and Dad that, yes, it was real. Today, six months later, I admit I am still awestruck, although I'll be honest and con­cede that I am much more inclined to give in to McDonald's when hunger hits at 11:30 
p.m. At first, McDonald's didn't seem to fit into my idea of the Oxford experience, so I avoided that den of American culture. But soon, because all pubs and most restaurants are closed by 11 p.m. (and because that ole college food is, well, so British), "anti­ethnocentricity" gives way to melted cheese on a real piece of hamburger. 
The tourists have started arriving, as I'm told they always do when the weather warms up. The students were lounging about this afternoon, soaking up the sun while they can because, as a kid from Wales told me, ''Only God knows when the sun's going to come back!" Certainly it must be this time of year when Oxford is the most spectacular. Few things rival a saunter around Merton gardens or a run along the Christ Church meadow toe-path. It fits the Oxford image: subtle and confident. The king of Spain dropped by the other day to pick up an honorary degree in civil law during a ceremony rich in pomp and parade. Oxford's 92 year old chancellor ran the show, spouting off bits of Latin and remarking to the king (in English) that his reign was ad­mirable. The tone was telling; yes, the chancellor could have said, Oxford has been watching you and we are quite impressed, so take your honorary degree and carry on, won't you? Lovely. 
It gets slightly thick at times, all this tradi­tion. Porters ask you when you plan to "go down" at the end of term, as if leaving Ox­ford requires descending to the masses. The tuxedo gets drawn out about twice each month, and undergraduates still run off to their examinations in mortarboards and black, sleeveless gowns (although many are women now). It's all part of Oxford, at least the bits that remain. 
What also remains, and what never fails to strike me, is Oxford's place in history, which quite frankly is simply overwhelming. In the house next to my college, Robert Boyle discovered in 1662 that with all else equal, a gas expands so that the product of pressure and volume is constant. Three hundred years later, at Notre Dame, I would attempt to master the evolution of Boyle's work, which we now like to call chemical engineer­ing. Edmond Halley used to stroll around these str:eets thinking thoughts about Jupiter and Saturn, until one day he turned his at­tention to the comets -one in particular -and considered how his observations might relate to the theories of his friend, Isaac Newton (who unfortunately was a Cambridge man). 
So great was Halley's work that right now beneath my sweater, the T -shirt I am wear­ing, I believe, advertises the return of Halley's comet. 
Again and again, I am reminded that so many thoughts, which have become mun­dane to contemporary scholars, were thought here in this city for the first time. As one of those the narrow-minded scientists, I don't often get a chance to tip-toe through the humanities, but I am assured that if I did, I'd come across many an Oxford man; John Locke, Thomas Hobbes, T.S. Eliot, 
T.J. Tolkein. Why, even the adventures of Alice in Wonderland were penned by a don at Christ Church College, who eventually called himself Lewis Carroll. 
Generally, though, all it takes is the roar of a motorcycle zooming past me on Holywell Street, and I'm back to the 20th century. And if that fails, the charming young lady walking down the street with the three rings in her nose and purple spikes in her hair certainly does the trick. Could John Locke have been a punker? Oxford, meet 1986; 1986, this is Oxford. 

What you mustn't do, of course, if con­fuse Oxford with England, for they are dif­ferent. The coins in Oxford may still feel as heavy in your pocket as they do in London, and they may s~ill deny you a bag at the grocery, but culture is enigmatic and understanding goes a lot deeper than the tourist's camera can reach. A tourist stop­ped me last Friday and inquired about this very point, I think. 'Where are the treasures?" he asked. "I don't want to miss anything important." Hmmm. Tough ques­tion. For starters, I replied, why not take a walk around the Merton gardens. It's easy to get there; just go down this street and turn left at Grove Street. You know the one: Magpie Lane, formerly Grove Street.

Fight against terrorism lessens need for NATO 
The United States finds itself in a precarious position regarding its NATO allies and the world environment. What is it to be an ally of the United States? Why do we often feel so alone in a world that we regard as safe because of our presence? These questions bear consideration in light of the events of the past several weeks, especially the questions arising over NATO and its constituents. 
Ken Kollman 
no easy solutions 
When our West European allies condemn­ed our bombing of Libya, we reacted like an offended friend. We naturally thought that NATO extends to our war against terrorists, and in our best Cold War, Reaganesque mentality, our fellow nations were either with us or against us. 
As the only European nation to verbally or logistically support our military act against Libya, Great Britain reacted like the perfect ally, with the kind of response that super­powers dream of at night. The French, being 
Doonesbury 

French, continued their long-term goal of absolute Frenchness, and snubbed our re­quest for access to airspace. They were against us. So was every other country in the world, except Great Britain and, naturally Israel, who is not in NATO. The United States, who can boast involvement in more defense treaties than any other country on earth, found little defense of its actions by anyone, save its two staunchest allies. 
What distinguishes these two supporting allies from the rest of our NATO friends? In a perverted way, Israel is delighted to see so­meone else share the burden of fighting ter­rorists, and one gets the feeling that Israel would rejoice if we did anything slightly nas­ty to Libya. As the only other nation to militarily retaliate against terrorism, they could not do otherwise but to support our ac­tion. No NATO country shares this perspective. Unfortuanately, Great Britain, by supporting the U.S. bombing, has join­ed the U.S. and Israel in the league of primary terrorist targets. In light of con­siderable Parliamentary opposition, Margaret Thatcher has continued to defend her nation's response. To understand That­cher's actions, one must keep in mind her personality, and her shared vision and friendship with Reagan. They have reported-

Problems arise when that 
chance to respond in kind. Also, she is a tough person. That Great Britain stands alone among NATO nations is more a reflec­tion of Thatcher and her party than a reflec­tion of British interests. 

The French, however, did not see a need to support Reagan's retaliation. Quite natural­ly, they and the other European nations fear reprisal on their own citizens, and recent at­tacks on British tourists probably brought "I told you so" whispers. Is it right for the U.S. to expect a fellow member of NATO to sup­port U.S. action even if it endangers French citizens? That answer depends on whom one talks to. 
Since World War II, the U.S. has seen itself as Western Europe's defender against Soviet expansionism. Historical perspective lends credibilty to this view, considering Soviet maneuvers in Berlin, Czechoslovakia and Poland. From the U.S. perspective, European survival as a non-communist 
political unit depends  on alliance with the  
u.s.  
This  mentality  of  policing  the  unruly  

Europeans is resented by European nations.

criticism means lack of support, i.e. the French refusing access to airspace. Impor­tantly, most Europeans view NATO solely as a defense against a Soviet march across West Germany, not as a catch-all treaty with the 
U.S. They refuse to see the treaty as a welcome mat for U.S. aircraft any time it is convenient. 
Both positions are understandable. What is important is the future of NATO. When the Europeans feel that the treaty has outliv­ed its usefulness, given the degree of distaste among the populace, they will not hesitate to discard NATO. At the moment, however, it serves their interest as a necessary evil. The U.S., however, may have learned a lesson. As the nature of warfare has changed to a fight against terrorists, as we ponder the response of our allies to the Tripoi bombing, and as we view the treaty from our perspective, maybe NATO no longer serves 
U.S. interests enough to warrant its survival.

Uncover sports treasure

here's a hidden treasure 
waiting to be discovered in the Notre Dame library for sports en­thusiasts. Or maybe it's not so hid­den. 
Notre Dame's International Sports and Games Research Collec­tion contains memorabilia from virtually every area of the sporting world and is the best collegiate sports collection in the country. Sports writers from all over the United States know about it, but most of the Notre Dame student body walks past the Department of Rare Books and Special Collections on the way to the more popular areas of the library. 
Those people are missing some­thing. 
"This is a research collection by design," says department curator jethrow Kyles, who has been in charge of the collection for five years. "It's not a museum although a

"College radio is where it's at." At least it is according to Pat F. Mur­phy. director of sales and promo.­tions at Notre Dame's WVFI. "A good college radio station is definitely a valuable thing for students to have," Murphy said. And he and the rest of WVFI's staff are spending a lot of time and energy to become just that. 
It is an uphill battle, however. WVFI is plagued by deteriorating equipment and lack of funds. "For whatever reason, we are not providing the service to students 
that w.e should. That's the sad part, because we have a lot of talented people. I just wish people could hear us," Murphy said. 
The biggest setback is money, Murphy's main concern. As direc­tor of sales and promotions, Mur­phy is in charge of generating revenue for the station through advertisements, the only source of income for the station outSide of DJing certain functions. 
"This year we received a $1000 ac­count from Wendy's, which, of course, gave the station a lot of money, and we go the An Tostal ac­count, one I'm pretty proud of myself," remarks Murphy. This and all other ad revenues are put in­to a general pot for the station's use. 
The station is made up of an ex­ecutive and general board, both staffed by Notre Dame and Saint Mary's students. The executive board is the controlling force

memorabilia we have and they've 
started a beautiful museum." 
And while such museums are crowded with sports enthusiasts who make a day ofreliving the achievements of their all-time favorites, the Notre Dame collec­tion remains hidden away. The better part of the collection, which was started in 1967, is filed away on shelves in the library basement. 
Hidden treasures. That's the only way to describe these memorabilia. 
Collectors would pay top dollar for the unpublished photos of Notre Dame's legendary Four Horsemen or for programs dating back to the 1800s in most sports. But they will never get the chance. One can't put a price on some of these items. 
"There are a lot offormer players around the country who know Notre Dame sp.orts better than anyone," says Kyles. "Some ofthese guys donate their own personal letters to commissioners of every sport to the collection. How can you replace things like that?" 
Other irreplaceable items (without even scratching the

l'he FM station deals specifically with the fine arts while the AM is predominantly progressive. Most, if not all, of the FM station's pro­gramming is sponsored through specific grants, and classical con­cert series are generally played. 
The AM format is labeled pro­gressive, but it "ranges from heavy metal to punk rock to oldies, depending on the DJ's taste. Our record collection is very extensive," Murphy said. 
WVFI does have a playlist called roation, and DJs are asked to follow this at certain times, usually the first hour of a show. The rota­tion consists of a mix~ure of top­40s, new wave and any ads. "It's not aZIP 104 type deal where every lO minutes you hear the same song. It's a good mix," said Murphy. 
Despite the playlist, requests are always more than welcome and usually put ont he air within five or six minutes of th~ call. "We really value our audience and definitely want to please them," Murphy siad. "We have a good time doing it." 
And have a good ime is exactly what WVFI's DJs set out to do. Flanner freshman Tom Tisa finds his experience as a DJ "stimulating." Tisa works the Wednesday 12 to l p.m. lunch-hour shift and subs occasionally for other DJs. 
Rose Pietrzak, a Saint Mary's freshman, also enjoys her job as a DJ. Pietrzak, who got her ex­perience from high school radio, is the only Saint Mary's student on WVFI's general board. "It really is a pity that more people don't get in­volved in the station. It really could play a valuable role in the ND/SMC community if WVFI got 
to  the point  where  people really  
respect it."

Notre Dame football programs 
and season srapbooks fill the 
shelves, yet only 20 percent of the 
collection consists of Notre Dame 
memorabilia. 
"We also have things not directly 
associated with particular sports, 
but rather, things about sports," 
explains Kyles. "There are theses on 
sports topics from women in sports 
to the aerodynamics of a pitched 
baseball." 
And perhaps the collection is not as hidden as one might think. 
"I've seen people from New York to Los Angeles fly in for just a few hours to do research in the collec­tion," Kyles says. "That's what we're here for. Howard Cosell used the collection for three of his 'Sportsbeat' shows.

Mulrooney is a latecomer to the station, while many students are in it from the beginning of the year. There are signups at Student Ac­tivites Night in September, and students must go through auditions to narrow down the number of ap­plicants. The number of positions available depends each year on how many staff members graduate. 
"The real crux is that we have quality people, not quantity," Mur­
phy  said.  "Wvfi's  staff  is  ex­ 
cellent."  
And  what's in the future?  A  

possible move to the newly renovated Lafortune Student 
borrows some of our memorabilia. They are geared for hype because that's what people who visit the hall of fame want. We're different. We're here for research."

Next year the station will feature & 7 to 9 a.m. talk show "that caters to the breakfast crowd -news, infor­mation and mellow music to start the morning," explained Murphy. "We've never done anything like this before and hope it will be a big success." 
The station is also making strides in funding for next year. "The ad­ministration is finally coming through for us," said Murphy. "I 
guess  they  finally  realize  that  a

College life is a world of big people. Everyone is either an adult or becoming an t< adult. But there are little people in the Saint v, Mary's/Notre Dame community, children ~ ages three through six at the Early ~ Childhood Development Center. tl 
Between 7:45 and 8:30a.m. every weekday morning, the little people troop into the e1 ECDC, located in Havican Hall on the Saint p Mary's campus. Their days are filled with o games, chances to show their creativity with F art work and show 'n tell performances. But ~ most importantly, they are surrounded with the philosophy that "kids are people, too." tl 
Terri Kosil, ECDC director since the fall of p 1975, runs the center following the ideas and o teachings of Rudolf Dreikurs. Dreikurs was E a psychiatrist who specialized in the social t< psychiatry of education in the home and si school. According to Kosik, Dreikurs' method is "sometimes called democratic d discipline, sometimes raising responsible (t children and sometimes discipline without n tears." 
Basically, Dreikurs believed that encourage­ment would help a child feel good about fi himself. The child participates in his own tl discipline, preparing himself for his future R participation in society. h 
"The child shares in the responsibility of behavior," Kosik said. "It is a fair and con­sistent way to discipline. All of our children are good; they sometimes do crazy things, but they're still good. We tell them that s< they're still good because we like to give them that ego. We all like to feel like we are good." 
At the ECDC, the children participate in the rule making process. Sometimes the class will have a meeting to decide the [ disciplinary measures which should be taken Cl if a child disobeys a rule. 
The teachers help the children to see the logical and natural consequences of their ac­p tions. So if Johnny throws a truck, then the f. teacher tells him that throwing a truck could fl hurt someone. The teacher doesn't jl\St say r: that throwing a truck is wrong because the teacher says so. The teacher explains the fl consequences of such an action so the child ~ can understand. Then perhaps the class will (t decide how Johnny should be punished if he p continues to throw the truck. fc

"You can really get a great ap­

Kyles. "Nowadays all you see and 
hear about sports is hype. It's gotten 
to the point where I am inclined to 
watch a game without the sound. 
Once you get a background in a 
sport you can cut through the hype 
and appreciate the game itself. 
"This collection cuts out the 
hype. This is the best of its kind in 
the country and that's not just ac­
cording to me. That's according to 
the Smithsonian Institute and 
groups like that. Most colleges have 
a strong collection in whatever

But ours is strong in so many

At Notre Dame, the collection is just beginning to come out from the closet. New Irish Head Football Coach Lou Holtz has taken many of his recruits through the collection to give them a taste of the athletic program at Notre Dame. Holtz has already discovered the hidden treasure, and he relishes the oppor· tunity to step back in time and appreciate the heroes of the past. 
The collection provides a great opportunity for sports fans and is certainly well worth a visit. The Department of Rare Books and Special Collections is located on the first floor of the library and is open weekdays from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. 
There's a treasure waiting.

This film, like its small screen relative, is all style. The filmmakers pay so much attention to wardrobe and set design that they seem to forget about character develop­ment. Because of the grating and insignificant dialogue and the short, flashy scenes, the crucial tracking test in the Everglades pro­ves nothing, because we have no sense of character to be unified. 
"Band of the Hand" is style superceding content. If you're up for some good television-style entertainment, this is your movie. Otherwise, stay home and watch "Miami Vice." 
Complaints are verbal trash 
Dave Dvorak 
Out of the lunch box 

Last Sunday morning, I woke up to the sound of clanging metal 
coming through my open window. I looked at my clock -it was 
only 8 a.m. Who could be making all this noise so early on a 
weekend morning? 
I got out of bed, walked over to the window, and opened the 
shade. I squinted at the garbage dumpster three floors below my 
window. There was a Hispanic lady, shabbily clothed, standing in­
side the dumpster. 
She was sifting around in the garbage, picking up aluminum beer 
cans. Standing outside the dumpster was her son, probably no 
more than 10 years old, holding a large plastic bag. His dirty, rip­
ped clothes hung from his frail body like rags. 
As the woman collected the cans, she handed them to her son, 
who placed them in the bag. No doubt they would be taking the 
cans to an aluminum recycling plant somewhere, where they would 
probably receive about 20 cents per pound. 
It was a pitiful sight. 
In the midst of a sugar-coated campus where students see only 
green quads and beautiful buildings, there was poverty. In this 
land of Polo shirts, Air Jor dans and compact disc players, there 
was a genuine human struggle. In living color. 
The mother worked with a quiet intensity as her boy watched 
silently with large dark eyes. With each aluminum beer can she 
handed him, the irony of the whole thing became more striking. 
The recreational waste products of one social stratus were becom­
ing the livelihood of another. Those beer cans that my friends and 
I had carelessly crushed and shot into the trash can from across the 
room were the very means of survival for this family. 
And to think of the things we students tend to complain about: lack of spring break money, a losing football season, a 10-page paper. They all seem so silly and insignificant by comparison. 
The more I thought about it, the more depressed I got. A II I could think was, if it weren't for luck of birth, I might very well be in that dumpster collecting cans, too. Why was that kid down there, watching his mother wade through garbage? Why was I up here in a well furnished dormitory room, two weeks away from a college diploma? 
I really have to wonder. Do we realize how good we've got it? Do we know how fortunate we are to have parents that give a damn about what happens to us, to have nice clothes, plenty of food at every meal and a chance to get a top-notch college education? 
Do we really appreciate how lucky we are to be at this place, alcohol policy and all? I'm a senior now, and I'll be going on to medical school next year. 
I tried to consciously avoid writing one of those sappy, sentimen­tal, can-you-believe-we're-graduating columns. But I'm just going to pass on a bit of advice to underclassmen that I've often heard myself. 
Appreciate this school every day you're here. Notre Dame has a whole lot going for it. Realize that it has its faults, but whatever you do, don't spend your four years here complaining. 
Because next thing you know, you'll be sitting in the ACC wear­ing a black robe and one of those funny flat hats. 
Then you'll have nothing left to complain about.

Mavericks, Lakers win to even playoff series at t~o each 
Associated Press DENVER -Alex English scored six points in overtime, and Lafayette Lever and T.R. Dunn hit key free throws down the stretch yesterday, rallying the Denver Nug­gets to a 114-111 NBA playoff vic­tory over the Houston Rockets, squaring the series at 2-2. Game 5 in the best-of-seven series is set for tomorrow night in Houston. 
The Nuggets trailed 104-99 with 44 seconds left in regulation, but Denver reserve guard Elston Turner made a three-point basket and then clipped along the baseline for a reverse layup with 11 seconds remaining to send the game into overtime. 
Houston -getting solid play in the fourth quarter and in overtime from point guard Robert Reid, who scored 11 of his team's final 13 points -grabbed a four-point lead in the extra session on Reid's baseline jumper. 

Dallas 120, L.A. 118 
DALLAS-Mark Aguirre scored 39 points, including a critical tur­naround jumper with 38 seconds remaining yesterday, carrying the Dallas Mavericks to a 120-118 vic­tory over the Los Angeles Lakers and deadlocking their NBA western Conference playoff series at two games each. 
The fifth game of the best-of­seven series between the upstart Mavericks and the defending NBA champion Lakers, seeking to become the first team to successful­ly defend the title since the Boston Celtics in 1969, will be played tomorrow night at the Los Angeles Forum. 
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who set an NBA playoff record by appear­ing in his 173rd game, missed his patented sky hook from 10 feet away at the buzzer as the Mavericks secured their second straight vic­tory over the Lakers. 
Abdul-Jabbar scored 33 points to lead the Lakers, while Earvin "Magic" Johnson had 29 and Scott 22.

Notre Dame golf team finishes 12th at Mid-American 
freshman Doug Giorgio and senior Lon Huffman. 
"Doug was playing in his first tournament and he responded beautifully to the challenge," said 
O'Sullivan.  Also responding  was  
Huffman,  who  according  to  
O'Sullivan  was  his  number  one  

player in his team's last four tour­naments. 
The results for the team in this weekend's tournament look like this. Doug Giorgio (72-84-75-231), Rich Connelly (76-75-76-227), John O'Donovan (85-81-73-239), Steve Fuhrer (78-77-75-230), and Lon Huffman (73-78-75-226). The medalist for the tournament was Jim Benete from Northwestern, who shot a 213 for the three days. 
O'Sullivan said that the way his team finished was a sign of a suc­cessful season. 
"We left with an upbeat feeling for next year," said O'Sullivan. "I am extremely proud of this team, especially the seniors, because they gave a lot of themselves and have given Notre Dame a good pro­gram." 
The team will be losing four seniors, including captain John O'Douovan, who O'Sullivan says always came through in the pinch. Another senior, John Anthony, has been nominated for academic all­America honors, which he was selected for last year. John cur­rently holds a 3.56 GPA and main­tains a sub 78 golf average (78 average or less is required for nomination).

SMC softball finishes 5th 
Special to Tbe Observer 
The Saint Mary's softball team concluded its 1986 season with a 
fifth-place  finish  in  the  NAIA  
district  tournam ent  over  the  
weekend.  

The Belles, who were seeded seventh going into the tournament, opened play with a tough 2-1 vic­tory over Huntington College. Franklin College then handed Saint Mary's an 8-7 loss, and St. Francis followed with a 3-1 win over the Belles in their final contest of the year.

weekend for Gallo., as he has seen 
more than his share of one and two 
run losses. 
"So close but yet so far away," philosophized Gallo after the season finale. "And yet ever so close. a key hit in the right time this weekend and we win three games." 
Gallo's 1986 team finished with 22 wins and 28 losses, or a .444 winning percentage, slightly below last year's .491 percentage, and Gallo's second-worst year at the helm of the Irish in that respect. 
"If anything can be learned by the guys coming back next year after this season is that you've got to have tremendour concentration­every game, every inning, every out, every pitch. The difference between winners and losers in col­
~ge and the pros ~ th~ if you make the plays and play three outs an innings, you're going to win. You can expect to give the other teams outs and win."

didn't always show up in the box­score. 
"Overall, we had an unselfish group of guys who sacrificed themselves. They were always receptive to changes we made in the best interest of the team. There was a lot of comradery, and that was a nice part of the team. Everyone really got along and like each other. 


.. 
Tony Rettino echoed the thoughts of his coach. 
"I was pleased with this year. We played together a lot more, said Rettino. "Joe Franklin and Tom Grote were our leaders on and off the field while Mike Rice did an outstanding job helping on defense. I really enjoyed playing with all of the seniors. During our gour years, the lacrosse program has really come a long way." 
That is true since the Irish have accumulated nine victories in the past three campaigns. Tim Cor­rigan spoke about his best moments in his career here and about the team's season. 
"Beating Denison twice was the best thing we could have done for the school and every one involved, " said Corrigan. "I think we had a successful year. We set our goals

high, but we didn't quite reach where we wanted to be." 
One more victory would have capped off a fantastic season for the Irish. For a while it looked Jike the Irish would get victory number ten but it simply was not to be. 
It was a beautiful day for lacrosse action with the temperatures in the 60's, and the sun filling the sky as Notre Dame battled Michigan State on Alumni Field to close out the season. The Irish drew first blood quickly, as Joe Franklin did what he has done 
so  often  throughout  his  career  
which is to score.  
Then,  the  other  high  scoring  
senior,  Tom  Grote,  took  a  pass  

from junior Jim Shields and dashed free from the green-dad Spartans to give the Irish a 2-0 lead. Two more goals by Franklin sandwiched around Michigan State's first tally gave the Irish a 4-1lead. 
Junior Dave O'Neill scored off of another pass from Shields to give the Irish a 5-2 quarter advan­tage. The Irish dominated the se­cond period as they outscored the Spartans 3-1 in the quarter. 
Their first goal in the quarter came on a perfectly executed fast break goal which was finished off by Franklin. Then, sophomore John Burtis beat his man and took it in unassisted. To cap off the first half scoring, goalie Matt Mc­Quillan provided a crowd pleasing assist to Grote to extend the lead to 8-2. 
Michigan State scored with just 14 seconds left in the quarter to give them momentum to start the second half. Four scored by the Spartans put them right back in the game as they trailed 8-7 with a little more than 6 minutes remaining in the quarter. 
Tom Grote helped the Irish re­bound with their only goal in the quarter, but the Spartans tied the game at 9-9 by the end of the third period. However, again it would be Grote who would answer for Notre Dame as he put the Irish up 10-9. Michigan State battled right back and soon took their first lead at 11­10. 
Shields tied up the contest with 
5:07 remaining as he kept battling with the goaJie before finally knocking the ball in the net. That set up the last second heroics forf the Spartans as Dan Christ got th~ ball in the goal with only 5 secondi left to close the 1986 season ~ on the Notre Dame lacrc~am. 
The team -~ ·ues t be rememberecr jet 1ts superb perfor­manc,. a~~mst Denison and also its cred1f11e game against Midwest power, Ohio Wesleyan.
