Domers prepare to 'spring forward' 
University officials plan adjustments for reinstated observation ofdaylight-saving time 
By KAITLYNN RIELY 
News Writer 
For years, residents of St. Joseph County have watched their clocks steadily click while the rest of the country sprang forward or fell back. But come Sunday, they will lose an hour with the rest of the nation when Indiana starts to follow day­light-saving time. 
Senior Jocelyn Burum does not expect the time change to have a significant effect on her life. 
''I'm fine with it really," Burum said. "It's kind of unique that we weren't following any time changes when it was day­light-saving time." 
Most counties in the state of Indiana have not followed day­light-saving time since the 1970s, according to the Associated Press. Last April, Indiana Governor Mitch Daniels encouraged the state legislature to pass a bill to force all coun­ties to follow daylight-saving time. The issue stirred wide­spread debate during the past year as counties decided whether to follow Central or Eastern Standard Time. 
St. Joseph County petitioned the U.S. Department of Transportation to follow Central Time, but that request was denied by the Department of Transportation, so the county will continue to follow Eastern Standard Time. 
University spokesman Dennis Brown said Notre Dame did not take a position on whether or not the county should institute daylight-saving time or which time zone it should choose. 
"We are fine with following the policies that have been laid out by the governmental agen­cies," Brown said. 
The Office of Information Technologies (OIT) has been working for the past two months to make the transition a smooth one, said director of dis­tributed support services Peggy Rowland. 
"This is actually going to impact us more than Y2K," Rowland said. "We did a lot of pre-emptive work before Y2K ... but the impact that we suf­

By LAUREN LAVELLE 
News Writer 
As Saturday's Board of Governance turnover approach­es, student body president Kellye Mitros and student body vice president Susan Mcllduff said they are pleased with the mark they have left on Saint Mary's. 
"I am very proud of the work we did this year," Mitros said. "We had a very successful year and I can look back on it with satisfaction." 
Both Mitros and Mcllduff said they are proud to have completed most of the objectives on their platform, which included adding a Health and Wellness Commissioner to the Board of Governance (BOG), raising awareness about College history and working closely with Enrollment Manager Dan Meyer. 
Mitros and Mcllduff said they are satisfied with their involve­ment in the creation of the first annual Heritage Week -a series of events that raised awareness

ND's Baron, Shappell, Kozlow reflect on year 
By MADDIE HANNA 
News Writer 
For Dave Baron, his year spent as student body president all boils down to the campaign slogan that came to him one sleepless night -one student voice, 8,000 strong. 
And three leaders who believed in doing it right. 
Baron, student body vice pres­ident Lizzi Shappell and chief executive assistant Liz Kozlow will bow out of their positions Saturday -except Shappell will be taking a step up to become student body president. Bill Andrichik will serve as vice president and Liz Brown as chief executive assistant. 
It hasn't been an easy year for student government's top three, and the end was no exception. Baron, Shappell and Kozlow were visibly stressed after Wednesday's Senate meeting, which centered on Minority Affairs committee chair Rhea Boyd's lobbying to win perma­

Musician Brubeck awarded Laetare 111edal 
By KATIE PERRY 
Assistant News Editor 
Renowned jazz musician Dave Brubeck will receive the 2006 Laetare Medal -Notre Dame's oldest and most highly regarded award given to American Catholics -at Commencement exercises this May, the University announced Sunday. 
The honor is given annually to a Catholic "whose genius has ennobled the arts and sciences, illustrated the ideals of the Church and enriched the her­itage of humanity." 
"The composed energy of Mr. 
Brubeck's art helps us appre­hend the fullness of creation," University President Father John Jenkins said in a statement Sunday. "His life and his music 
splendidly interweave the celebra­tion of beauty with the imperative to worship." 
The popu­lar pianist has com­

posed a num-Brubeck her of jazz pieces, including "Take Five" and "Blue Rondo a Ia Turk." In 1954, the Brubeck's quartet graced the cover of Time Magazine following the release their album, "Jazz Goes to College." The magazine called Brubeck "the most exciting new jazz artist at work today" and the creator of "some of the strangest and loveliest music" in the history of jazz. 
Larry Dwyer, jazz studies director at Notre Dame, said the Laetare selection reflects Brubeck's "consisteutly high level of musical achievement" through his professional career, which has lasted more than half a century. . 
"Brubeck's music always 
swings and always includes interesting and profound levels of improvisation," Dwyer said. "Best of all, everyone -jazz fan or not -always enjoys listening to Dave Brubeck." 
But Brubeck's repertoire extends beyond the realm of jazz. The esteemed musician has composed and performed bal­lets, cantatas, solo piano pieces, a musical, an oratorio and a Mass -a testament of his deep allegiance to the Catholic faith. 
In a June 2005 National Public Radio interview, Brubeck echoed the words of a Nez Perce chief

ND hosts student conference 
Annual event studies issues, process ofpeace 
By KATHLEEN MCDONNELL 
News Writer 
Given the service-oriented nature of many Notre Dame students, it's not uncommon for undergraduates to set their sights on changing the world. Organizers of this year's Student Peace Conference hope the weekend event will provide some answers for students stuck wondering where to begin. 
Peace Conference Chair Kevin Walsh said the confer­ence is tailored to students who have a "genuine desire" to live their faith and work for social justice. 
"The presentations at the conference will both open your eyes to horrific problems that afflict our global society and empower you with the knowledge that you have the ability to change it," Walsh said. 
The annual conference begins with a banquet tonight and continues Saturday with nine different panels and five different presentations throughout the day. Held at the Hesburgh Center for International Studies and sponsored by the Kroc Institute, the peace confer­ence is planned and directed by undergraduate peace stud­ies students. 
Walsh said student interest has been exceptional -with nearly 200 students regis­tered to attend. While Friday's banquet registration is closed, all students are encouraged to attend presen­tations on Saturday, where registration is recommended but not requirfld. 
This year's conference, titled "Voices of Today, Changes for Tomorrow," high­lights the role of youth in building peace. Urban gang violence, educational pro­grams teaching values of peaceful conflict resolution and identity and discrimina­tion are some of the issues the conference will touch on. 
Saturday's 3:30 p.m. pres­entation of Myla Leguro, nominee for the 2005 Nobel Peace prize, promises to be partie ularly worthwbile, Walsh said. Myla will discuss her challenges and aspira­tions in working with Catholic Relief to combat youth vio­lence and religious conflict in the Philippines.

Tw-o years in the tnaking, Saint Mary's debuts SMC-TV 
By KATIE KOHLER News Writer 
After two ymtrs in the develop­ment stage, SMC-TV-an inde­pendent television station opnrat­nd by Saint Mary's -went on the air Wednesday as tlw first stu­dent-produced television program in Saint Mary's history. 
SMC-TV will air its program­ming on Tuesdays at 4:30, 5:30 and 6::m p.m. on Channel 3. 
The station is based out of the lluisking Family Instructional Tedmology Hesouree Centm in thn basement of the library and reeeives a large portion of its l"unding !"rom the !Iuisking Family Foundation. 
Senior Michelle Fitzgerald, co­creator and general manager of the station, worked with 20 facul­ty members and students for two years to make SMC-TV a reality. 
Fitzgerald said she was proud or the f'irst broadcast and has high hopos for upcoming produc­tions. 
"Our first broadcast went very well and my staff and I were excited to see a product on the air after almost two years of hard work creating the station," Fitzgerald said. 
The broadcast was led by two anchors -senior Janet Brace and junior Erin Hanifin. The top stories included highlights from Midnight Madness, SMC Toastal and Accepted Students Weekend. The show also surveyed students' spring break plans. 
Hanifin said in addition to cov­ering campus news, SMC-TV will also be a positive resource for prospective students. 
"We are hoping this can become a tool in attracting future freshmen to our school," Hanifm said. 
SMC-TV originally was going to be broadcast in the dining hall and other campus locations. But televisions were not installed in time for the first broadcast. Fitzgerald said the televisions should be installed in the dining hall this week, a location chosen primarily because almost every student visits the facility at least once a week. 
"By placing a TV in a visible area, students will see the SMC­TV broadcast-gaining the max­imum number of viewers for both the station and our advertisers," Fitzgerald said. 
Campus news is not the only focus for SMC-TV. Other pro­grams in Wednesday's broadcast included "Art Talk," which pro­filed a visiting artist on campus. Future shows will include a pro­gram called "Community Forum" and coverage of campus events such as the Theolo~gy on Fire series. 
A cooking show and morning workout broadcast are also in the works. 
"We recognized the size of our endeavor and knew we had to start small," Fitzgerald said. "We will use this broadcast as a springboard to improve on the quality of SMC-TV each week." 
Keith Fowlkes, director of infor­mation technology and SMC-TV faculty advisor, was impressed with the finished product. 
"The quality and content wa:s super," Fowlkes said. "They had some small technical difficulties, but that is expected for a first broadcast." 

Fitzgerald said many students provided positive suggestions ­like airing the campus news pro­gram more than once a week. 
"We [the staiD hope that inter­est will grow as students are able to check out the first broadcast via the homepage and tune in the following weeks," Fitzgerald said. 
The whole program will be accessible through a link on the Saint Mary's website so students will be able to download the pre­vious broadcast from any com­puter on campus. 
Student-created advertisements also play an important role in the success of SMC-TV. Fowlkes said the students were entirely responsible for the ads. 
"The student team did all the contacts, marketing and place­ment of the ads," Fowlkes said. 
Fitzgerald said scrolling bill­board advertisements and birth­day announcements are displayed 15 minutes before each broad­cast. Both types of ads had to be purchased by businesses and stu­dents. Advertising benefactors include campus cafe Dalloway's, the Social Work Club, First Source Bank and Saint Mary's food sup­plier Sodhexo. 
Michelle Fitzgerald said the goal of SMC-TV is to provide a wrap-up of the week's news sto­ries, adding that there will be no live coverage on events. 
Fitzgerald said news updates will be broadcast on Channel 3 when SMC-TV is not on the air. 
Fitzgerald said her long-term goal is for the station to continue on after she graduates this spring. 
"When I return to Saint Mary's in five years, I would like SMC-TV to be incorporated into a student's weekly life," she said. "Additionally, I would like to see students interested in one or two specific programs outside of the campus news, watching SMC-TV as part of their nightly television ritual." 
Fitzgerald is confident the work of the faculty, staff, and students who created the station will pay off. 
"Most of all, I would like to see students credit SMC-TV with making them better informed and connected to what is happening on campus and what services are available," she said.

ble." 
With student evictions, 
llurrkane Katrina relief and pep 
rally and bowl game ticketing 
liascos damoring for attention, 
the Baron administration has 
shouldered a pretty heavy bur­
den -and the emphasis has 
always been on responsibility. 
Baron, Shappell and Kozlow all said professionalism was integral to thnir success this year espe­dally in dealing with issues like the inauguration of University President Father John Jenkins and South Bend's newly-rnvised disordnrly house ordinance. 
The key, Baron said, is to be "rnspectl"ul and mspeetable." 
"Wn advocated and lobbied for 
tlw Student Union," Shappnll 
said, "embracing the opportunity 
with a new !University) adminis­
tration to set a new tone 
betwnen student government 
and the administration ...

Just as student government has grown undnr their leader­ship, so have Baron, Shappell and Kozlow. individually. 
"One of the things J'vo learned lis) you can't take every issue that conws your way that you want to support and put every­thing behind every issue," Baron said. 
And it's impossible to predict and plan for the unexpected. Kozlow said. 
"You never know what issues, how many n-mails you'rn going to g1~l." she said. 
"IStudnnt Union Board presi­dent! Jimmy Flaherty used to eome over and say, 'Thnre's a flavor of the week,'" Baron said. 
Onn isstw the leaders eneoun­len~d almost immediately was student apathy, Kozlow said, basml largely on the bnliPI" that students have no impact on big picture dneisions at the University. 
Not only did tlw Baron admin­istration work to eounter that apathy by mobilizing the student body -''l'v1~ snPn people who used to be apathntic eornn and enjoy to-go !"ups, minority slu­rll~nts who usPd to not lpartici­palel conw and petition," Baron said -but it also shalll~rml per­l:eptions that students have no say.

"I think the team we've worked with has been phenome­nal," Kozlow said. "Our attempts, the way we put our hearts ·into it -that's been the most rewarding." 
This year's lessons, Baron said, will carry him into his future. 
''I'd say I learned a lot about what it means to be a leader, that leadership is not about being at the forefront of the Student Union .... It's about serv­ice, putting yourself in the mid­dle of what people care about. 
"It's paradoxical that by follow­ing you become a leader. But that's a very Catholic message," said Baron, who believes his faith has grown through his leadership nxperinnce. 
Friendships have formed as well, bonds the three say that grew somewhat unexpectedly. 
"Not to get all rnminiscing or anything, but not knowing Dave that well, not knowing Liz that well, and now they're two of my closest friends," Shappell said. "It's been a fun ride." "Lizzi and I finish each other's sentences now," Baron said, half-jokingly. 
Kozlow, a junior, will take over as Judicial Council president Saturday. Baron, who is graduat­ing, will be attending law school in the fall.

"The administration really does take us seriously. . .. And I think we did I take advantage of that) this year." 
While his interactions with members of the administration have helped his administration achieve its goals, for Baron, those conversations have tran­scended the working environ­ment and developed into lasting relationships. 
"I consider myself extremely lucky to have seen Notre Dame from an angle that most students don't get to see," he said, "to come to know personally this assembly of people who have committed their lives to further­ing the mission of the University." 
Baron said he considers Vice President for Student Affairs Father Mark Poorman "one of my greatest friends" and Jenkins an "introverted leader, as a lis­tener too ... his sheer ability to listen and lead at the same time." 
"That's shaped me in ways I have even yet to figure out," Baron said. 
While Shappell attested to the deep rapport between this year's student government administra­_tion and the University, she said it was relationships with stu­dents that made the experience stand out for her. 
"It's been more working with peers ... motivated to improve this University," Shappell said. "You're grown up and you're still in college, and you're acting like

The jurors obtained the definition as deliber­ations neared four hours. U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema told them the term includes airplanes used as missiles. One of the three convictions on which Moussaoui could receive the death penalty is conspiracy to use weapons of mass destruction. 
The nine men and three women, who got the case late Wednesday, then returned to deliber­ate whether Moussaoui is a calculating terror­ist responsible for the deaths of Americans on Sept. 11 or an al-Qaida lackey with delusions of grandeur who had no role in 9/11. 
Mine survivor returns home early 
SIMPSON, W.Va. -Randal McCloy Jr. was enveloped in loving chaos when he came home Thursday. It seemed a little overwhelming not only to the "miracle miner," the only survivor among 13 men trapped by an underground explosion in January, but also to his 1-year-old daughter, Isabel. Her wailing didn't subside until she sat on her father's lap. 
McCloy's homecoming is a wonder to his doc­tors, who first feared he wouldn't survive and later expected his recovery to take about twice as long as it did.

At least 48 die in ferry accident 
The al-Dana capsizes in Persian Gulf just a mile from Bahrain shore, 63 survive 
Associated Press 
MANAMA -A ferry car­rying up to 150 people capsized Thursday night in the Persian Gulf off the coast of Bahrain, and at least 48 bodies were recovered, the country's coast guard chief said. American divers and a 
U.S. helicopter aided the rescue effort. 
Coast guard chief Youssef al-Katem said at least 63 people survived. A passenger on board the ferry calling from his cell phone was the first to alert oftkials that the ship was listing, he said. 
The official Bahrain News Agency said the ferry -the al-Dana ­was on an evening cruise that was to last several hours. It overturned less than a mile off the coast, it said. Television footage showed the ferry capsized but not sunk, with rescue workers walking on its brown hull. 
U.S. helicopters and divers joined the rescue operation launched by Bahrain's coast guard. Bahrain, a tiny island nation on the western side of the Persian Gulf, is home to the Navy's 5th Fleet. 
Rescue teams brought bodies covered with white sheets to shore, and hospi­tal workers hurried them to waiting ambulances. Scores of officials and rel­atives waited on the dock watching small rescue boats with flashing blue lights bring more bodies and survivors. 
There was no indication of what caused the ferry to capsize in what appeared to be ideal weather condi­tions. The government dis­missed terrorism as a cause, and the news agency quoted Interior Ministry spokesman Maj. Mohammed Ben Dayna calling it an accident. 
"It's tof'l early to say what caused the acci-

dent," Ben Dayna said. 
Al-Katem said an inves­tigation was underway. The ferry's owners said overloading could have caused the ferry to cap­size, according to Bahrain television. 
The passengers were thought to be a mix of Bahrainis, nationals of other Gulf Arab nations and Westerners. Health Minister Nada Haffadh told al-Arabiya television that survivors who arrived at hospitals included nationals of India, South Africa, Singapore and Britain. 
Information Minister Mohammed Abul-Ghafar, interviewed on al-Arabiya television, said the passen­gers included 25 Britons, 20 Filipinos, 10 South Africans and 10 Egyptians. 
Haffadh said 24 people were hospitalized and that other survivors had been released upon arrival on shore. Television footage showed survivors, appear­ing to be in shock and their hair still wet, squat­ting on the floor of a hos­pital. Many of them cov­ered themselves with blankets. One male sur­vivor was shown being treated for cuts to the head. 
Interior Minister Sheik Al Kahlifa said most of the 
ferry's passengers were employees of a Bahrain­based company. 
Al-Katem said there were 150 guests at a din­ner party aboard the ferry. The guests, he said, ate dinner while the ferry was still docked and that up to 20 of them disembarked before it sailed. 
Cmdr. Jeff Breslau, a spokesman for the U.S. Navy, told The Associated Press that the U.S. military aided the rescue effort. The Navy has had a pres­ence in Bahrain for more than 50 years. 
"We're sending divers, small boats and a helicop­ter," Breslau 10aid. 

Army prohlbits use of some armor 
Associated Press 

WASHINGTON -Soldiers will no longer be allowed to wear body armor other than the protective gear issued by the military, Army officials said Thursday, the latest twist in a running battle over the equipment the Pentagon gives its troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
Army officials told The Associated Press that the order was prompted by concerns that soldiers or their families were buying inadequate or untested commercial armor from private companies -including the popular Dragon Skin gear made by California-based Pinnacle Armor. 
"We're very concerned that peo­ple are spending their hard-earned money on something that doesn't provide the level of protection that the Army requires people to wear. So they're, frankly, wasting their money on substandard stuff," said Col. Thomas Spoehr, director of materiel for the Army. 
Murray Neal, chief executive offi­cer of Pinnacle, said he hadn't seen the directive and wants to review it. 
"We know of no reason the Army may have to justify this action," Neal said. "On the surface this looks to be another of many attempts by the Army to cover up the billions of dollars spent on inef­fective body armor systems which they continue to try quick fixes on to no avail." 
The move was a rare one by the Army. Spoehr said he doesn't recall any similar bans on personal armor or devices. The directives are most often issued when there are prob­lems with aircraft or other large equipment. 
Vetera'ns groups immediately denounced the decision. 
Nathaniel R. Helms, editor of the Soldiers for the Truth online maga­zine Defense Watch, said he has already received a number of e­mails from soldiers complaining about the policy.

said they also dealt with disap­pointments and criticism -most of whkh stemmed from the can­cellation of the College's annual Pride Week. 
"Most students try to pin the cancellation of Pride Week on us," Mdldull' said. "We did not have any hand in that process. It was the Student Academic Council that had the fmal say in that mat­ter." 
Other challenges for Mitros and Mclldull' included learning how to balance their office responsibili­ties with their class schedules as well as learning to handle diflcr­ent opinions among BOG mem­bers. But Mitros said these chal­lenges were small compared to what some administrations have had to deal with in the recent pa..<>t. 
"We have been pretty lucky this year that there weren't really any huge issues that came up," she said. "Looking back on recent years at Saint Mary's, other administrations have faced so much more than we did." 
While criticism has been mini­mal, Mitros and Mcllduff said some people questioned the seri­ousness of their administration. Some members of the College community claimed BOG did not conduct itself in a professional manner, Mitros said. It was not their intention to be unprofession­al, Mcllduff said. 
"I would say our term was very non-traditional," Mcllduff said. "Kellye and I took a path less traveled when approaching how to run a board." 
Both women said they dealt

with opposition by looking objec­tively at the criticism and their own actions. 
"I think it is important to address a problem and acknowl­edge that I am human," Mclldufl' said. "Constructive criticism is valuable because it helps me grow as a person and as a leader. Without it, I wouldn't have direc­tion or a sense of where I need to improve." 
While both women said the end of their term is bittersweet, Mitros and Mcllduff are ready to move on to other interests. Mellduff also said she is ready to take on the challenge of becoming student body president. 
"I am sad that my term as stu­dent body vice president is over but at the same time I am ready to meet with the new Board and to become next year's student body president," MellduiT said. "I enjoyed this year and hope sue­cess continues into next year." 

For Mitros, the end of her term coincides with the end of her years as a Saint Mary's student. While she hopes to remain an active part of the Saint Mary's community after graduation, Mitros said she will miss being able to serve her fellow students. 
"To the students ofSaint Mary's, I would just like to say thank you lor a fantastic year," Mitros said. "One of the greatest plea..<>ures of my life has been serving you and I hope you can also look back on this year with as much fondness a.<> I do."

IN BRIEF 
Delphi to ask judge to cancel contracts 
DETROIT-In a move that would send shudders through an ailing U.S. auto industry, Delphi Corp. was expected to ask a federal judge to cancel its union contracts Friday following months of trying to reach an agreement with General Motors Corp. and its unions to lower workers' wages. 
Delphi, the largest U.S. auto supplier, had set a deadline of Thursday to reach an agreement to lower wages for its 34,000 U.S. hourly workers, but it appeared unlikely Delphi would meet that goal since the United Auto Workers and GM hadn't agreed to Delphi's latest wage proposal as of Thursday afternoon. 
In a message on its Web site Thursday, the United Auto Workers said Delphi would file motions to void its contracts on Friday morning. Delphi spokesman lindsey Williams said the com­pany wouldn't comment on that posting. 
Williams said Delphi was still in talks with GM and its unions as of Thursday afternoon and hadn't set a deadline for those talks to end. On three other occasions, Delphi has delayed filing motions to cancel its contracts to continue negotiating with GM and its unions. The company has the option of delaying again. 

Small businesses lose out in contracts 
WASHINGTON -Small businesses lose out on hundreds of millions of dollars in Energy Department contracts each year because the gov­ernment often gives no-bid work to large finns on flimsy grounds, congressional auditors say. 
A report by the Government Accountability Office, obtained Thursday, looks at small business con­tracting practices at the department, whose $22.8 billion in annual awards for research, nuclear weapons maintenance and environmental cleanup make it the largest civilian contracting agency. 
The report says the agency failed to meet small business contracting goals of 5.5 percent or lower in four of the last five years due to lack of controls, poor planning and questionable assumptions that smaller finns couldn't handle the jobs. 
The Energy Department "is clearly constrained by the department's traditional reliance on a limit­ed group of large finns and universities to manage high-cost projects in which public safety and national security are important concerns," says the report, scheduled to be released next month.

Stocks lower after GDP report 
Renewed inflation fears, new data on gross national product affect Wall Street 
Associated Press 

NEW YORK -Renewed inflation fears left stocks mixed Thursday as new data on the nation's gross domestic product bolstered the Federal Reserve's view that the economy remains strong. 
Investors fretted after the Commerce Department revised the nation's fourth­quarter GOP, which was raised to an annual growth rate of 1. 7 percent from an earlier 1.6 percent esti­mate. The slowdown in growth -GDP grew at 4.1 percent in the third quarter -was blamed on an unex­pected drop in government spending and business investment. 
But while the final GOP reading matched econo­mists' expectations, the department's chain deflator -an inflation measure ­rose 3.5 percent, above forecasts for 3. 3 percent growth. Investors have been watchful for any hint of inflation amid signs that the Federal Reserve will keep hiking interest rates to control price increases.

Venezuela takes on Exxon Mobil 
Associated Press 

CARACAS -Venezuela had a blunt message this week for Exxon Mobil, one of the world's most pow­erful oil companies: Get off my crude-rich turf. 
Venezuela is tightening its squeeze on the oil industry, telling oil companies to give the state a greater share of profits -or get out. 
Oil Minister Rafael Ramirez on Wednesday said Exxon Mobil Corp. was one of the companies that 
would "prefer to leave  ...  rather  
than  adjust"  to  recent  policy  
changes.  

"We said we don't want them to be here then," Ramirez told the state TV broadcaster adding, if "we need them, we'll call them." 
Exxon Mobil indicated Thursday it had no plans to pull out. "ExxonMobil de Venezuela contin­
ues to have a long-term perspective of its activities in Venezuela," it said in an e-mail to The Associated Press. 
The flap helped push the price of oil above $67 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange on Thursday as the market reacted to the latest sign of tighter state-con­trol of energy around the globe. 
Venezuela is taking on Big Oil at a time when rising oil prices, political instability in the Mideast and Nigeria and new buyers in Asia have put the world's fifth-largest oil exporter in a winning position. 
After snubbing Exxon Mobil, Ramirez said Venezuela has other eager partners, including state companies from Russia, Iran, China, India, as well as traditional oil companies. 
The new climate has given Venezuela the flexibility to diversify "away from Western investors and incorporate state-owned companies from allied countries ... more will­ing to abide by new, tighter terms," said Patrick Esteruelas, analyst at the Washington-based Eurasia Group. 
The government has increasingly sought projects with state-con­trolled oil companies in friendly countries. Last year, Venezuela granted exclusive licensing rights to certify and quantify reserves in blocks in the Orinoco tar belt to seven companies, including China's CNPC, India's ONGC and Iran's Petropars. The only western oil major included was Spanish­Argentine company Repsol YPF. 
The trend is driven by President Hugo Chavez's distaste for corpo­rate multinationals, which he accuses of looting his country's oil wealth over the years. He enjoys strong support for his efforts to take more industry profits for use in social programs for the nation's poor.

Nev. explosives test to cause m_ushroom_ cloud 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -The last time a U.S. government official was quoted prominently on the subject of mushroom clouds, it was Condoleezza Rice talking about the risk of discovering too late that Saddam Hussein had a nuclear weapon. 
On Thursday it was a Pentagon otlicial musing about the speetaele of detonating a 700-ton explosive in the Nevada desert -a test blast dubbed "Divine Strake" that the official said might remind some of the days of open-air nuclear testing, before the blasts were moved under­ground to avoid the danger of radioactive fallout. 
"I don't want to sound glib here, but it is the first time in Nevada that you'll see a mush­room cloud over Las Vegas since we stopped testing nuclear weapons," said James Tegnelia, head of the Defense Threat Heduction Agency, a Pentagon unit that is working on technieal aspeets of how to destroy deeply buried enemy weapons. 
The United States stopped conducting aboveground nuclear tests in 1963. 
Tegnelia's use of the term "mushroom cloud" seemed to unsettle some in Washington. 
In an entirely different context, Rice spoke prior to the U.S. invasion of Iraqi in 2003 of the risk of waiting too long to con­firm with complete confidence that Iraq had a nuclear weapon. The first confirma­tion, she said, could be a mushroom eloud over the United States. It turned out that Iraq had no active nuclear weapons program. 
Several hours after Tegnelia made the mushroom eloud remark to a group of reporters, his office put out a written statement stressing that Divine Strake was not a nuclear blast, that it poses minimal health and safety risks to the public, and that there are no radioactively contami­nated soils in the vicinity of the planned detonation. 
And the mushroom cloud? 
"All explosives, given the right thermal characteristics, will create a eloud that may resemble a mushroom cloud," the statement said, adding that the "dust cloud" from Divine Strake -scheduled for June 2 -may reach an altitude of 10,000 feet but "is not expect­ed to be visible from Las Vegas," about 90 miles away. 
Tegnelia said the Russian government has been notified to avoid misunderstanding about the nature of the blast.

Model Naotni Catnpbell charged in Manhattan assault 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK -Supermodel Naomi Campbell was charged with assault for throwing her cell phone at a housekeeper after accusing her of stealing clothes when she couldn't lind a pair of jeans she wanted to wear on "Oprah," prosecutors said. 
She was released on her own recognizance and allowed to keep her passport after her lawyer argued that her famous face would prevent her from fleeing. 
"She is probably the most rec­ognized and prominent model in the world," defense attorney David Breitbart told a judge Thursday in Manhattan Criminal Court. "There is no place she could go and not be recognized." 
Campbell, wearing a white fur poncho, was arraigned on a charge of second-degree assault before Judge Richard Weinberg, who allowed Breitbart to enter a plea of not guilty on her behalf. 
In a statement issued late Thursday, Campbell called the allegation that she hit or injured her housekeeper "com­pletely untrue." She said she had questioned the housekeep­er, Ana Scolavino, about miss­ing items since she started working for the model more than two months ago. 
"She is sadly mistaken if she thinks she can extract money from me by concocting lies by recycling old stories," the supermodel said. "I have asked my lawyer to look into filing both theft and extortion charges against her." 
The housekeeper was treated at a hospital for a cut that required four staples, said Assistant District Attorney Elina Kreditor, who asked the judge to set bail at $3,500 and to order Campbell, who is British, to surrender her passport. 
Breitbart called the request for $3,500 bail "an insult," say­ing his client's Park Avenue apartment is worth more than $3 million and she earns "more than six figures on a regular basis." 
He said Campbell needed her passport for a trip to South Africa next week to visit Nelson Mandela. He asked the judge for orders to keep the house­keeper away from Campbell's apartment. 
The judge said Scolavino, would have to give up her key to the apartment and issued an order of protection against Campbell, telling her she could have no contact with the employee. He scheduled her next court appearance for June 27. 
The assault took place at about 8:30 a.m. inside Campbell's apartment, accord­ing to a criminal complaint. The housekeeper was hit in the back of the head and was treated at Lenox Hill Hospital, it said. 
A woman who answered the after-hours media relations number at the hospital said no one was available to comment

Facing a familiar sea of cam­eras, Campbell exited a Manhattan police station short­ly after 4 p.m. in a scene that was part runway, part perp fired her housekeeper earlier this morning," said the state­ment from J.R. Johnson. "We are confident the courts will see it the same way." 
This was not the first time the volatile Campbell, 35, was accused of reaching out and touching someone with a phone. In 2003, the supermodel was sued by a former adminis­trative assistant who said Campbell had thrown a phone at her during a tantrum two years earlier. 
In August 2004, in the same apartment, Campbell and her maid battled it out, with the worker claiming the supermod­el slapped her across the face. Campbell accused maid Millicent Burton of instigating the fight. 
Campbell was discovered at age 15 and launched a career that landed her in magazines worldwide -including the Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue. Campbell's high-profile lifestyle has included appear­ances in music videos by George Michael and Jay-Z and a close friendship with Mandela. 
The international modeling sensation has appeared in sev­eral films and dabbled in a musical career. 
The mercurial Campbell has a reputation for angry outbursts and abusive behavior. She pleaded guilty in Toronto to an assault charge for beating another assistant while making a film in Canada in 1998. 
She also battled a cocaine addiction before reportedly get­ting straight several years ago.

Several Israelis killed by Palestinian suicide bomber 
Associated Press 

JEHUSALEM-A Palestinian suieide bomber in the West Bank killed four Israelis after nightl~tll Thursday, just days aller the new llamas Palestinian government took ollice and Israel elected a premier who pledges to pull out the Palestinians refused to lift a finger to prevent terror attacks against Israelis, and we saw the results tonight." 
Just two hours before the bombing, the Israel Election Commission released the official results from Tuesday's election, giving an extra seat to acting Prime Minister Ehud Olmert's Kadima Party. The party linished with 29 seats of the 120 in the parliament. The hawkish Likud also picked up a seat, giving it 12. The changes were based on counts of votes from soldiers and others not included in the original tally. 

Olmert has pledged to pull out of much of the West Bank and move tens of thousands of Jewish settlers from outlying areas in the West Bank to main settlement blocs. He has said he prefers to settle the conflict with the Palestinians through negotiations, but it not, he would take unilater­al action to draw Israel's borders. 
Olmert has also pledged to take stiff action to halt Palestinian vio­lence. After the bombing, Israeli soldiers blocked roads in the area of the settlement, and Israeli media reported contact with Palestinian seeurity agencies was cut ofT.

JAMAICA 
Nation svvears in first fe111ale pri111e 111inister 
AP Jamaica's new Prime Minister Portia Simpson Miller waves to the crowd after being sworn In Thursday by Governor General Kenneth Hall, right. 
Associated Press 
KINC;STON -Portia Simpson Miller took ol'f'iee Thursday as .Jamaica's first female prime min­ister, pledging to fight violent crime, root out corruption and protect human right'>. 
Thousands turned out for her inauguration including the Caribbean's top leaders as well as the Nation of Islam's Louis Farrakhan and Essence magazine editorial direetor Susan Taylor. 
"The first pledge I make as prime minister is to advance human right'> and individual liber­ties," the 60-year-old leader said. "I pledge to work tirelessly to end all corruption and extortion. 
"Both of these diminish our eco­nomic potential and I will do everything in my power to break the power of the criminals." 

Simpson Miller, known as "Sista 1'," was a long-serving member of parliament who represented South East St. Andrew Parish, one of Jamaica's crime-ridden slums that she says ean be transformed with better schools and more eco­nomic opportunity. 
Simpson Miller beat three oppo­nents to take over leadership of the ruling People's National Party from outgoing Prime Minister P.J. Patterson, who led Jamaica for the past 14 years. 
She said her ascension to Jamaiea's leadership post was "a true manifestation of the Jamaican dream. 
This indicates that any child regardless of circumstances can rise to the top." 
Patterson's administration was dogged by scandals and allega­tions of corruption while the econ­omy lagged and the crime rate soared-a record 1,671 homi­cides occurred last year in the nation of 2.6 million. 
Simpson Miller's supporters say they hope that her becoming the first female prime minister will inspire others in a country where about 12 percent of political posts are held by women. 
GAZA STRIP 

Hamas ministers take office 
Associated Press 
GAZA CITY-It may have been a smooth handover, but it was far from orthodox 
The Palestinians' new prime minister was no where in sight Thursday as outgoing leader Ahmed Qureia turned over his office in the West Bank city of Hamallah to his successor. 

And at the Foreign Ministry, eeremony gave way to verbal jousting as the departing min­ister debated with his succes­sor over the need to honor agreements with Israel. 
Israeli restrictions and inter­nal friction led to some bizarre moments during the handover of Palestinian government ministries to Hamas, under­scoring the militant group's challenges as it tries to gov­ern. 

Qureia turned his office to new Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh's deputy, because Israel wouldn't allow llamas ministers and lawmakers to travel through Israel between Gaza and the West Bank ­and llaniyeh was in Gaza. 
Still, Haniyeh insisted the seamless transfer was a testa­ment to Palestinian democra­cy. 'This is proof that our peo­ple is a great civilized people, and the peaceful handover of power will now be a routine that our people will abide by," he said. 
Instead of 100 days of grace, the Barnas government got barely 100 minutes before Western nations, led by Canada and the U.S., moved to cut off funding to the Palestinian Authority, trigger­ing an immediate financial cri­sis that might delay March salary payments to more than 100,000 public employees next week, many of then armed security troops. 
l-lamas leaders said the aid cuts violate the Palestinians' democratic rights, but Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice declared, "The prineiple is very clear: We're not going to fund a llamas-led govern­ment." 
llamas has rejected Western demands to renounce violence, 
reeognize Israel and accept previ­ous agreements between Israel and the Palestinians. The United States and European Union list Barnas as a terror group, as does Israel. 
The Palestinian Authority gets a large part of its $1.9 billion annu­al budget from overseas sources, and may run into difficulties next week when March salaries 

are due to be paid to some 140,000 government employ­ees. 
Haniyeh said the aid cuts hurt the Palestinian people. 
"We were hoping that some countries would respect the rules of the democratic game and that they would have had different positions and not act this way," he said. 
And Foreign Minister Mahmoud Zahar hinted that any country that shuns Barnas

North Carolina introduces lottery 
Associated Press 
RALEIGH, N.C. -North Carolina lost its label Thursday as the only East Coast state with­out a lottery, getting off to a quick start as commuters, casi­no-players and the curious snatched up the first batch of instant tickets. 
Attracted by the promise of $400 million annually for educa­tion and spurred on by Gov. Mike Easley, the General Assembly narrowly passed a lottery last summer, following the lead of 41 other states and all of its neigh­bors. 
"Why should we be giving our money to Virginia, South Carolina and Tennessee?" Sarah Haynes asked after buying 40 $1 tickets at a gas station north of downtown Raleigh. She was wearing a jacket emblazoned with the logo of an out-of-state casino. "Taxes are already too high." 
More than 5,000 retailers statewide began selling tickets at 6 a.m., shortly after State Board of Education chairman Howard Lee bought the ceremonial first tickets at dawn. 
"This is fantastic,". Lee said, holding up the tickets at the lot­tery's Raleigh office. "This is a great day in the state of North Carolina." 
By midday, Lee had given his five $1 tickets to North Carolina Teacher of the Year Wendy Miller, who won $10 that she then gave back to the state. It was part of the estimated $1.3 million in prizes paid out by mid­afternoon, lottery officials said. 
Ticket sales by then had reached about $6.5 million, well beyond the early $2 million esti­mate of lottery officials. Executive director Tom Shaheen estimated that sales would reach more than $10 million for the day. 
At least 35 percent of the pro­ceeds from every ticket sold must go public-school construc­tion, class-size reduction, need­based college scholarships and a voluntary prekindergarten pro­gram. 
North Carolina will join the multistate Powerball numbers game in late May. 
The lottery law also sets aside up to $1 million to assist prob­lem gamblers and requires strict advertising restrictions. 
Lawmakers started consider­ing starting a lottery in the early 1980s. Easley began pushing the idea again after taking office in 2001, and it gained momentum after South Carolina and Tennessee began lotteries a few years later. 

But resistance to the lottery remained stiff, as Tar Heel nota­bles from the Rev. Billy Graham to retired North Carolina basket­ball coach Dean Smith expressed opposition. 
They and other opponents said the games would siphon money from the pockets of the poor, encourage more compulsive gambling and simply shift educa­tion spending to the lottery with­out adding any new money. 
"People will be led to believe the lottery is a cash cow for edu­cation, and it's not," John Rustin, with the N.C. Family Policy Council, said Thursday. 
Easley and legislative leaders countered that North Carolina residents were paying to educate children in other states by play­ing lotteries there. 
Across the state Thursday, early customers bought lottery tickets along with their coffee and snacks. When Brian Regling stopped at a Raleigh conven­ience store, a clerk and the store manager were still reading instructions about the game. 

Wildfires threaten homes in Amarillo 
Eight homes destroyed, no injuries reported 
Associated Press 
AMARILLO, Texas~ Two wildfires erupted Thursday in this dry and windy city, destroying eight homes and several structures before they were brought under control, officials said. 
There were no reports of injuries. 
About 400 acres burned, though estimates were diffi­cult .because wind gusts of nearly 40 mph grounded Forest Service aircraft, agency spokeswoman Traci Weaver said. The fires were 90 percent contained by Thursday afternoon, she said. 
Several cars burned in a junkyard, and authorities tried to evacuate homes in the area, but most efforts focused on protecting the homes in the fire's path, said Amarillo Fire Capt. Bob Johnson. 
"We did save a lot of (structures), but it was mov­ing so fast," Johnson said. "It kept jumping highways, too." 
The temperature was in the high 60s with a relative humidity of 12 percent. 
Weaver said the conditions were similar to March 12, when hundreds of blazes broke out in the parched region, burning some 960,000 acres and killing 11 people. 
Since Dec. 26, more than 11,000 fires have burned about 4.9 million acres and destroyed about 400 homes, according to Gov. Rick Perry's office. 
The fires were burning about 17 miles from the nation's only nuclear weapons assembly facility, but the westerly winds meant it likely wouldn't be threatened, Weaver said. 
Amarillo, a city of 176,000, is in the Te·xas Panhandle, about 335 miles northwest of Dallas.

sion does not impact in any way Massachusetts citizens." 
Reilly said the legality of the marriages of out-of-state cou­ples who received licenses would have to be determined in their home states on a case-by­case basis. 
New York's top officials have said same-sex marriage is ille­gal there, although that inter­pretation of state law is being challenged. Rhode Island law does not specifically address same-sex marriage, but leading politicians there also oppose it. 
According to the Registry of Vital Records and Statistics, 7,341 gay couples tied the knot in Massachusetts between the first marriages in May 2004 and December 2005. 
The state does not _track how many out of state couples were given licenses in Massachusetts. 
Opponents of gay marriage are working to put a question on the November 2008 ballot that would define marriage as only between a man and a woman. 
The question has gathered the required signatures from regis­tered voters and now needs leg­islative approval to be placed on the ballot.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Unite for higher -wages 
Just this week Notre Dame hosted a confer­ence on white privilege. Generally speaking, white privilege refers to those systemic advantages in this society that members of the white "race" are granted solely on the basis of their membership in that group of people with white-colored skin -without any consideration of individual members, aspirations or achievement. Among the many benefits that being white automatically assures a person, perhaps the most signifi­cant is the ability to ignore issues of race and racism; that is, to claim colorblindness. 
Though it often overlaps with the white kind, there is another, distinct type of privi­lege system that is just as prevalent in America: it is the one based on socio-eco­nomic class. On account of this "rewards" program, people who have money are enabled to ignore those who don't. Indeed, it is a uniquely moneyed luxury to claim that money doesn't matter. But this privilege extends further. America's treasured myth of meritocracy, that Horatio Alger story in which hard work invariably assures success, allows the economically comfortable classes to believe that everything they have is the result of their own hard work-and is com­pletely unrelated to their completely unearned inheritances of all sorts: money, reputation, education, childhood environ­ment, etc. Conversely, this economic fantasy (a fantasy because there is a whole class of jobs in the United States on whose wages alone, no matter how long or hard you work, you cannot survive) also allows the well-off to imagine that if a person and her or his family are poor, it is somehow that person's fault­even, by some inexplicable stretch of the imagination, ifthat person is working. 
Though my purpose here is to argue for the necessity (a humanitarian, as well as a Christian, necessity) of a living wage for cam­pus workers, I have brought up these issues of race and class-based privileges because I feel that they are extremely pertinent to situ­ation of the living wage campaign here at Notre Dame. More precisely, I am claiming that it is because the majority of the students here come from very well-off families, and because all of the administrators here are fmancially well-off, that there is not more support for a living wage for campus work­ers. What I mean by this is that I truly believe that almost every individual associated with this University would like for every other individual associated with this University to have enough to eat, to have access to ade­quate healthcare, to live in a safe house and area and to afford decent clothes for them­selves and their children. But I feel that it is our class-based capacity to deny social and economic injustice, since we ourselves proba­bly have not been victims of it, that permits us to avert our engaged attention away from those people who work here at this school, for US, everyday, and yet WhO are often unable to keep themselves and their families above that mystical (to us) poverty line. 
Since we the students (but also the faculty, the alumni, our parents, etc.) make up this University, if a critical mass of us demanded a living wage for all campus workers, the administration would undoubtedly make this happen. After all, this is not an issue of scant resources, but of budget priorities (think: the new main entranceway). However, our money buys us the privilege, which we accept, of ignoring this matter of inadequate wages and feeling apathetic towards cam­paigns that try to make the University's eco­nomic policies more humane, more just. But, in truth, a wage system that does not pay each worker enough to survive and to sup­port her or his family on the worker's income alone is not simply the concern of the work­ers or of volunteer groups like CLAP -it is a problem for all of us. This University's eco­nomic policies are our own. And if we do not challenge them, we enforce them.

Wages a Catholic responsibility 
Many Roman Catholic institutions, which served as vehicles for social mobility for poor and working class Catholics in the 20th century, are now resisting requests that they pay their workers a living wage. 
The country's 238 Roman Catholic col­leges and universities are a case in point. Over the last hundred years these institu­tions have helped millions of families move solidly into the middle class. They have also shaped the spirituality and ethics of mil­lions more young adult Catholics. 
This story is borne out in my own family. My grandfather never finished high school. He worked in the auto factories of Detroit and ran a corner drug store in Akron. But somehow his parents managed to send him to Notre Dame in 1948. For my father and for our family, Notre Dame was a ticket to the world of business and to the middle class. 
My wife and I graduated from Notre Dame in 1977 prepared for our careers and equipped with an adult faith that has served us well as we raise our own family. Two of my nieces now attend Notre Dame and are doing well academically even as they participate in a wide array of service projects. 
But Catholic colleges -and indeed all faith-based institutions-cannot just live off the ideas and traditions of the past. Historian Jaroslav Pelikan has said that "tradition is the living faith of the dead" not "the dead faith of the living." 
If places like Notre Dame are to be the "living faith of the dead" they must go beyond the idea that the only things that really matter in Catholic universities are the success of the students and the quality of the research. Their challenge is to see their mission in a broader way and be lead­ers providing living wages to their non-pro­fessional employees. 
Last fall, students at Notre Dame launched the Campus Labor Action Project to bring together students, workers, faculty, alumni and community allies to work for living wages on Notre Dame's campus. Their work mirrors efforts in 35 other col­leges and universities to raise the wages of their non-faculty workforce so they too can have a shot at owning a home, saving for retirement and sending their children to college. 
The movement for just wages is rightly aimed at Notre Dame and its $4 billion endowment. But the same question should be put to all Catholic institutions ­parochial schools, hospitals and congrega­tions included. Are we practicing what we preach when it comes to our teachings about what constitutes a just wage? Are our institutions responding to the demands for justice of their prophets and saints-or to the lower bar of what the market requires?All across America, there are families like mine -only Mrican American, Caribbean American, Hispanic and Asian -who need Roman Catholic institutions to do for them what they did for my parents. In Notre Dame's case, instead of being forced to give its workers a living wage, it should be the national Catholic leader of the effort.

Military contract not an1biguous 
In response to Jonathan E. O'Reilly's letter (U.S. Army does­n't honor ROTC contract, March 28). O'Reilly has failed to men­tion anything regarding the ver­bal oath every officer takes upon accepting a Commission, which concludes "I will well and faith­fully discharge the duties of the office upon which I am about to enter." Unlike enlisted personnel, commissioned officers take an oath to serve "freely and without mental reservation" at the behest of the Commander-in-Chief, and are therefore granted the unique responsibilities and obligations of this esteemed office. One of the obligations is to serve as long as one's services are deemed neces­sary, not by the individual, but by the organization. When an officer resigns his or her commission, it is a request to resign, a request which may be turned down. 
I am not questioning O'Reilly's dedication or faithful eight years of service to the Army, but as an officer he should know that the Army's needs supercede his own needs or desires. This is made clear in any ROTC program or other commissioning contract. As a student who will be commis­sioned as a 2nd Lieutenant in the Marine Corps this May, it has been made explicitly clear that I may be required to serve beyond the minimum (the exact word used in the contract) four years of my commitment, and that res­ignation is a request which could be denied. If this was not made clear to O'Reilly at the time of his commissioning, that was a failure of his ROTC staff, but I can attest to the fact that currently the ROTC staffs are stressing the pos­sibility of being held beyond the minimum requirement. 
O'Reilly alludes to this at the end of his letter where he wants this clause pointed out to him in his contract. As future officers and leaders of young men and women of the enlisted ranks, we are expected to be fully responsi­ble for our actions, including reading and fully understanding what our office actually entails. It is not anyone else's responsibility to make sure the· officer candi­date understands his or her obli­gation to fulfill that office. Again, I am not arguing that O'Reilly does not have a legitimate claim to be released from his oath, but his letter shows gross ignorance toward the actual commitment officers are expected to make upon being granted the special trust and confidence of the Commander-in-Chief.

·Two sides to contract interpretation 
Regarding the letter, "U.S. Army doesn't honor ROTC contract," by Jonathan E. O'Reilly (March 28), I feel it is important to see the other side of the issue. 

I was in Army ROTC at Notre Dame from 1989-1993. My contract for service with the U.S. Army required eight years of service, and I served four years on active duty and another four in the "inactive reserves," where I served with no unit and did not participate in any military activities. 
However, the total length of serv­ice for my contract was "indefi~ nite," meaning that, unless I resigned my commission after com­pleting my obligatory eight years, I was subject to recall into either the active reserves or active duty. I could request resignation once my eight-year commitment was satis­fied. I did resign at this point, and it was accepted. 
However, officers who have com­pleted their obligation are not guaranteed that their resignations will be accepted, especially in a time of war. If their military spe­cialty or rank is in short supply, it is possible that their resignation will not be accepted (a situation referred to as a "stop-loss"). In short, the ability to resign is subject to the needs of the Army, even if one's contractual obligation for minimum service has been met. 
So, a critical distinction must be made between the minimum length of service a cadet must serve in return for a scholarship (eight years) and maximum length of service (indefinite unless a resigna­tion is accepted) the Army may require by the contract signed by ROTC cadets. 
I cannot speak to O'Reilly's spe­cific circumstances, such as his mil­itary specialty and whether there is a "stop-loss" for that specialty, but I can tell you that, though four peo­ple might have been able to sue their way toward an honorable dis­charge, I know of others in similar situations who have accepted the "call-up" and fulfilled their duties as best as they could, despite the hardships. They didn't see it as a breach of contract on the part of the Army, but rather a case of the Army's exercising an authority the contract allows it to exercise. 
Incidentally, this is also true of officers who enter the Regular Army and serve their entire careers on active duty. Once an officer is Regular Army, he or she has an indefinite obligation, unless he or she resigns the commission or retires. It's not just an issue with Reserve commissions. 
The key here is that anyone sign­ing a contract needs to be very clear about what that contract requires -not just the minimum requirement, but also the maxi­mum -especially when it comes to the military.

Cultures collide in Heaney's 'Burial at Thebes' 

DVD REVIEW 

'Ae Fond Kiss' a multicultural'Romeo and Juliet' 
By GRACE MYERS 
Scene Writt"r 

"An Fond Kiss" is the story of' an inde­prmdent Scottish woman and a first-gen­eration Pakistani man who fall in love in middle-class Clasgow. When their family and friends discover their love, scandal breaks and threatm1s to tear them apart. 
Sound familiar'! Yeah. there's nothing particularly groundbreaking about this Homeo and .Juliet-likn plot. But director Ken Loaeh gives the story the spin it needs to be fresh and appealing. 
The film addressns the issues of' race, immigration and religion in multicultural Britain. beginning with the younger sis­ter's class spm~eh stating, "I reject the Wnstern simplification of a Muslim." lndend the problems this family faces are anything but simple, focusing on how Muslim's are viewed in British society during our modern age of terrorism. "Ae Fond Kiss" is indeed provocative, intense and fabulously up-to-date. It's a great love story by a renowned director. 
Casim (/\tta Yaqubl is the jewel of his tight-knit, first-generation Pakistani fami­ly. !lis parPnts haw struggled greatly to raise and educate their children in a city they do not understand. The audience discovers that Casim's father is busy building an extension to their house, so that Casim can live there with his arranged bride-to-be, Jasmine. Casim is resigned to this fate, valuing the happi­ness of his family above all else. That is, until he meets Raisin (Eva Birthistle), a music teacher at his sister's school. She is smart, talented, beautiful and extremely independent. She is also white and Catholic. 
Despite his fast-approaching marriage, Casim asks Raisin out, she accepts and they begin seeing each other frequently. She sees the club he deejays at and the space he dreams of turning into his own club. Casim soon calls off his marriage with Jasmine. His family is devastated and is shamed by the entire Pakistani community. Casim struggles greatly from the heartache he has caused, while Hoison tries to understand his situation despite not having had a family for many years. 
One might assume that Roisin can loose nothing by this relationship (and indeed Casim suffers much more), but wh..en Casim and Roisin move in together out of wedlock she is rebuked by her local parish priest and forced to resign from her teaching position at the Catholic school. Prejudice is rampant in both com­munities, with Roisin and Casim fighting to stay together. Finally, Casim leaves his family, knowing that it is, sadly, the only way he can be with the woman he loves. 

"Ae fond Kiss" is the first major film for both of the leads. Their inexperience is often evident and they sometimes do not quite carry the gravity of their role. However, their innocence helps the film in many ways. The two sometimes seem nervous in a subtle way, indicating the feelings of a new romance. They grow more comfortable as the film progresses and have remarkable on-screen chem­istry. 
Director Ken Loach is an internationally acclaimed British director, who began working as a television dramatist for the BBC in 1963. Throughout the 1990s he rose to international acclaim for his fea­ture films containing highly provocative and often radical political messages. He is not afraid to display the worst aspects of society. But "Ae Fond Kiss" is not typical for Loach. It takes place in comfortable, middle-class Scotland, free from drugs 
LEE/The Observer King Creon (Sean Sweany), left, and the messenger (Jim Schneider) star in "The Burial at Thebes." The play is Seamus Heaney's translation of "Antigone." 
By MOLLY GRIFFIN 
A~sis1ant Scene Ediwr 

Two distant cultures -Irish and Andnnt (;reek -are brought together in thn performance of' "The Burial at Thnhns." The play is Irish poet Seamus Heaney's translation of Sophodes' Greek tragndy "Antigone," and the production 1:ombirws these two distinct influences. 
The production is sponsored by the Irish Studies department and the dassics dnpartment. The shows this weekend are set for Friday at S p.m. and Saturday at 2 
p.m. and S p.m. in the Philbin Studio Theatre. 
"The play is appropriate for this University because it has a strong con­nection with Irish culture," director Andrew faulkner said. "Notre Dame has a strong Classics department and a strong Irish Studies department and the play bridges between the Irish and the classi­cal." 
The play centers around Creon (Sean Swrmny). who represnnts the traditional and rigid values of the state. A conflict arises when Antigone (Meg Trucano) dis­obeys an edict Creon issues regarding the burial of her brother, who died fighting against their state. Sweany is a Scene writer for The Observer. 
The Irish and Greek elements emerge in the production in diverse ways. Immediately noticeable are the costumes -some are distinctly Greek, some dis­tinctly Irish and others a combination. Antigone's white chiton is distinctly Greek, while Haemon (Andrew Hayes) sports a costume with Irish designs. On the other hand, Antigone's sister Ismene (Jennifer Melillo) wears a colorful costume that melds Greek and Iri!:lh influences. 
Several of the actors in the play speak with an Irish lilt, which very overtly adds an Irish bent to the play. Heaney's transla­tion of the play adds some English idioms to the Greek tragedy, which also adds to the melding of the two cultures in the pro­duction. 
'This production of 'A Burial at Thebes' is unique because it tells a story, which at heart is ancient Greek tragedy, with an Irish taste to it," Jim Schneider (Messenger) said. "The elder characters in the play use an Irish accent, but the younger ones work with a toned down American accent. This difference helps build the tension between old and new, the traditional and the untraditional." 

Another interesting facet of the produc­tion is the presence of the chorus. The chorus is an integral part of any Greek play, and they play a central role in the progress of the play. In "The Burial at Thebes," the chorus, composed of three women -Marisa Behan, Maureen Mullen and Elizabeth Rogalski -who sing, dance and speak throughout the play. Their unaccompanied singing, dancing and singing add a unique dimension to the play as a whole. 
While classical Greek tragedy is thou­sands of years old, the themes that are presented are still a part of our culture today, Behan -the chorus leader-said. 
In particular, the themes present in "Antigone" and the translation of the story presented in "The Burial at Thebes," still resonate with the present day. 
"Seamus Heaney -who wrote/translat­ed 'Antigone' into 'Burial at Thebes' ­saw the story as a sort of political allegory, where King Creon's 'for us or against us' mentality resembles President Bush's rhetoric concerning the war in Iraq" Gavin McDowell (Guard) stated. 
"However, I've always read the play on a religious level -as a story about what happens when civil authority refuses to submit to divine authority." 
The play can be read on multiple levels, and the combination of cultural influ­ences, particularly in lleaney's version of the play, makes it especially open to var­ied interpretations. 
While the play deals with serious issues like politics, religion, family and duty, it manages to evoke emotions while still being entertaining. The unique combina­tion of Irish and Greek influences seen in this production add to the play and make it especially appealing to the Irish -in this case, the fighting Irish of Notre Dame. 
"I think that Notre Dame audiences will particularly resonate with the Irish bits of the production, but hopefully t.hey can M persuaded into thinking of the 'Antigone' story while being simultaneously enter­tained," Meg Trucano (Antigone) said. 
"The Burial at Thebes" updates a clas­sic story with a production that celebrates its diverse influences. The combination of Irish and Greek elements, while different, comes together in an exciting way in this performance.

Junkins: St. Pabick's Day conflicts with values 
By BARE HEINYGIRL News Writer 
University President Father Jim Junkins announced Thursday that the exclusion of St. Patrick's Day from Notre Dame's academic calendar will continue indefinitely due to deep conflicts between the popular Irish-American holiday and the University's Catholic character. 
Since St. Patrick's Day -and its trademark green beer, cloth­ing and vomit -occurs annually on campus every March, outside observers could easily believe Notre Dame endorses the holi­day's values, Junkins said. 
"This decision has nothing to do with pressures from alumni or the Church," he said, looking up from a cash pile of donations to lovingly stroke a framed pho­tograph of Pope Benedict XVI. "The concern here is not with censorship, but with ... well, yeah, I guess it is censorship. Deal with it." 
Adjustments to this year's aca­demic calendar -whose extended four-week Christmas break resulted in March 17 falling when students were away from Notre Dame for spring break -will soon be made per­manent, Junkins said. 
"With students gone, there won't be anyone to embarrass the University by drinking in class or falling off balconies," the president said. "That way, the officers and I can celebrate the holiday the way God and Our Lady intended it -in an aca­demic setting, like 339 O'Shaughnessy." 
Unlike in his recent addresses concerning "The Vagina Monologues" and the former Queer Film Festival, Junkins did not ask various campus con­stituencies for feedback about his St. Patrick's Day choice. 
"Can you believe faculty and students actually wasted all that time writing Viewpoint letters and e-mailing me about their opinions?" Junkins said incredu­lously. "Between flying my

Ordinance bars students from city 
Common Council member Yumm Itsjello said she pro­posed the ordinance after her constituents complained about Notre Dame and Saint Mary's students having cracked-out naked orgies in the South Bend residents' living rooms. But other behavior is just as problematic, she said. 
"If a police officer can hear any bit of noise coming from your house when his face is pressed up against the win­dow, you are just too loud," Itsjello said sternly. "We're talking about something extremely disrespectful, some­thing that will keep the entire neighborhood awake -espe­cially after normal nighttime hours like 4 p.m." 
Splash and ltsjello said the Council considered waiting until students were away from campus for the summer to pass the new ordinance -as the group did for the amend­ment in July 2005 -but ulti­

Following months of tension between South Bend residents and Notre Dame and Saint Mary's students over off-cam­pus parties and inflammatory stereotypes, the South Bend Common Council on Thursday passed a new housing ordi­nance banning students from living anywhere in the city. 
Students living in houses or apartment complexes off-cam­pus have until 11:59 p.m. April 1 to vacate the premises, and must take all of their belongings and vehicles with them, Assistant City Attorney Nan-Cheryl Splash said. 
"Despite all the bitching about that amendment we passed last summer, we only got six real evictions out of it," Splash said. "So this will be like one HUGE eviction ­we're getting rid of all the snotty, spoiled, puking, forni­cating brats at once!"

SMC takes revenge on Shockular tvvosollle 
By MEAGHEAEN O'NEALL£ News Writer 
A group of Saint Mary's stu­dents calling themselves Mooney's Posse kidnapped Notre Dame junior Alec Black and sen­ior Erik Powerless from their respective residences Thursday night and are holding the pair hostage somewhere in the Saint Mary's tunnel system. 
Black and Powerless are best known as the creators of The Absurder's comic strip "Shockular," which raised eye­brows and ruffled feathers on campus all year with its cynical humor and sexual innuendo. 
In a ransom note issued shortly after the kidnapping, members of Mooney's. Posse stated Saint Mary's College and its students are the butt of the joke in a dis­proportionate number of Shockular comics. 
"Saint Mary's women are sick and tired of being portrayed as unintelligent jersey chasers who go around telling people they attend Notre Dame," the state­ment read. "These images serve only to promote hurtful stereo­types in our community. Letters to the editor and complaints made directly to Mr. Black and Mr. Powerless have gone unheed­ed. As such we have been forced to take matters into our hands."

Walking student detained 
NOHTH QUAD -A stu­dent was detained late Wednesday night for walking across the quad. An NDSP ollicer, who was on patrol, saw the student while perched on his A1V and eat­ing donul'i. The student was suspected of trafficking cocaine wit.l1 intent to distrib­ute. 
While there was no visual evidence that would suggest the student was carrying an illicit substance, the ollicer on patrol had an itch on his calf which he took to be a sixth sense indicating that the student might be up to no good. The student was questioned and released, but NDSP is considering sending the case to HesLife pending the results of a 20-page questionnaire that was dis­tributed to his peers. NDSP said they want to know more about how people feel about the incident before they take the next step. 

Endowment "Rushed" 

SNITE -University offi­cials, in a surprise move, decided this week to invest the entire $4 billion+ endow­ment fund on a toilet for the Snite Museum. The toilet is storied to have had its porce­lain graced by the great Chuck Norris, the legendary martial arts master and movie star. 
"We've been looking to acquire more and more pieces of historical signifi­cance, and I think we've managed to grab something that will make a real splash," said University CFO Scott Malappropriate. Students protested the move Thursday by flushing copies of DuLac down campus toi­lets, causing a massive back­up of campus sewer systems -and ironically, the only working toilet left on campus is the newly purchased "Chuck Norris Toilet," which is currently locked in a room in the Snite.

McFrien previews 'Code' 
Famous Notre Dame profdefends himselfagainst plagiarism charges 
By BOLLY WIFFLIN 
NewsWri£er 
Father Dick McFrien -the Notre Dame theology professor and nationally renowned CNN, NBC, ABC, CBS, Fox News and WNDU commentator who faced plagiarism accusations twice this year-held a conference on campus Thursday to discuss his work on the upcoming film adaptation· of "TheDa Vmci Code." McFrien served as an advisor for the fllm, and during his lecture previewed scenes from the movie in which he claimed his influence was most visible. 
McFrien began the lecture by welcoming listeners and thanking them for their support during the plagiarism controversy. McFrien insisted he has no fears about further accusations, saying, "Fra~y. my dear, I don't give a damn. 
The rest of McFrien's opening remarks, while welcoming, inspired some confusion: "Call me IshmaeL Friends, Romans, countrymen, this experience has been the best of times, and it has been the worst of times, but I have always depended on the kindness of strangers." would be like.

Senior Maygen O'Brien admit­ted some of Black and Powerless' comics are funny but others are "wildly inappropri­ate." 
"How would Notre Dame stu­dents like it if a couple of Saint Mary's women drew a bunch of cartoons highlighting the worse stereotypes about Domers?" she said. "Would they really want to see themselves portrayed as socially inept nerds who can only interact with the opposite sex when they are wasted?"

Police said they believe the hostages are being held some­where below Le Mans Hall and are working to determine their specific location. Saint Mary's officials screened their phone calls and locked their office doors Thursday to avoid having to comment on the situation at this time. 
Animosity toward Black and Powerless has been building for months, and a large crowd of students assembled on the Le Mans green Thursday night to express support for the kidnap­pers.

their release. 

"The truth is Black and Powerless, with their crude humor, have become a bit of lia­bility to the squeaky clean repu­tation of this institution," the administration said in a state­ment. 
While some Notre Dame stu­dents expressed concern that there will be no Shockular strip in Monday's paper, others sym­pathized with Mooney' Posse. 
"Saint Mary's students are not the only ones insulted by the Shockular jokes," said junior Meaegahan O'Leary. "There are other groups in this community who have also been deeply offended. I wouldn't describe this as a huge loss."

Losing 
continued from page 8 
an 87-84 loss to Mkhigan in Ann Arbor in the second round of the NIT on March 20. The loss was the fourth overtime loss f!1r Notre Dame this sea­son. 
"I know wn lost to Michigan, but I'm proud of this ~-,rroup," Frny said. "They fought, they fought hard. We really are the Fighting Irish. Did I tell you how much I love this team?" 
Notre Dame failed to make the NCAA Tournament for the third straight year, as it fini'ihed 6-10 in the Big East, good for a No. 12 and final seed in the Big East Tournament. 
The Irish lost every close game th1~y played in, including Pittsburgh, DePaul, Syracuse, Marquette, Georgetown, Villanova, West Virginia, Louisville and Connecticut. But the Irish didn't let small point margins get them down. All year they fought back ... and lost. Fought back ... and lost. From Beve Bobak's fallaway three at Marquette to Fyle Cowarly's tip in to propel Villanova ahead, the Irish eouldn 't win a game in the last two minutes if their scholar­ships depended on it. 
However, despite Notre Dame's inability to win close games, athletic director Kevin Blaek stands behind his loving, tie-less maeh. 
"Ike Frey is a proven winner," Black said. "lie won at Delawarn and DeMatha and he will win at Notrn Damn. Unlike previous eoaches who were only suecessful Monday through Sunday, he is consis­tent in his losing ways. But I have uttnr confidenee in his ability to turn this program 



around. After all, we were so 
dose in so many games ... so 
dose. Did I tnll you how mueh I 
lowl Notre Dame?" 
Frey reflected on his fifth sea­
son as the head eoach at Notre 
Dame, one that was filled with 
missed last-second shots and 
failures to win a dose game. 
"I really love thi'i team," Frey said. "I know they got flustered at the end of games, turning the ball over too much and waiting until the last second to take a bad shot, but they're a great buneh of guys. They really are." 
Frey reiterated that he wouldn't have done anything differently thi<> season, even if it meant the Irish would fail to win those close games again. 
"I will go to my grave with Bliss Gin shooting the ball," Frey said. "I Ie could shoot from the top row of the bleachers with .08 seeonds left-I would­n't care. I put all my trust in Bliss -he's the man. I really love that kid." 
However, Frey has come under fire as the state-of-the­art Moyce Center has failed to fill up for games this season, and the Irish continued to struggle just three years after making the Sweet 16 of the real tournament. 
But Blaek responded to criti­ci'im of Frey by saying that he still believed in him as a person and a basketball coach. 

"Frey has been a great repre­sentative of Notre Dame," Black said. "I know he will eventually find a way to win games, because he is a disciple of Coaeh Z at Duke. Coach Z i'i a pretty good coaeh and we're jLL'it waiting for it to show up in Ike. After all, it's only football where ~e're impatient with eoaehes.

We're better than you 
It has recently come to our attention that some tragically sions in America -right up there with lawyer, garbage­
misguided Notre Dame and Saint Mary's students think they are too good for The Absurder. You know the type ­the guy who brags to his friends that he only reads Shockular and PastryLand because our reporting is too "juvenile" for his refined tastes. Or the girl who scoffs at the debates in the Pointless section because they never mention "real 
A~rdcr 

issues" like immigration reform or Nick and Jessica. If this sounds all too familiar to you -yes, you ripping out the cross­word puzzle, three words of which you will 
Ediactually finish -consider this your wake­up call. 
It's been scientifically proven time and again that jour­nalists are not only drastically more intelligent than the rest of the population, but also happier, savvier, funnier, sexier, richer, more truthful, sexier, hotter and more attractive. Furthermore, these traits are multiplied when discussing journalists at the college level-one need only look at The Absurder's newsroom for evidence of this fact. Yet journalist remains one of the least-respected profes­
man and assistant rector. Why the contradiction? Obviously, jealousy is a factor-who wouldn't envy the 
high-profile, glamorous lifestyle found in the South Dining 
· Hall basement? -but we suspect it runs deeper than that. We think you're intimi­dated. 
Admit it, Absurder haters. You couldn't be more terrified of this publication. Our enormous power to independently set the 
ton.al .. 

tone and topic of campus conversation, to determine a student government adminis­tration's fate, to publish incriminating 
birthday ads, to print Saint Mary's swimming stories no 
one will read-all that overwhelms you, doesn't it? It's 
easier to just tune it out, isn't it? 

We thought so. So think twice the next time you're tempt­ed to declare yourself above The Absurder's standards. We know where you live, we know all your dirty secrets and we're not afraid to splash them across the-front page. 
If only every profession could be so noble. 
Fire Barley Cheis 
Don't get me wrong, I think our football program has been at its very best from Sundays to Fridays, but I think its time we took steps to improve the way our program performs on Saturdays. When I first heard that Barley Cheis was being hired to be our coach, I was worried that he would bring the same results to Notre Dame that he had in New England in the NFL. Unfortunately, I was completely correct. 
9-3! Are you serious? That's not even anywhere near the success a program like Notre Dame should be having. We should have won 13 games last season, easily. Hyrone Twillingham, who is perhaps the greatest molder of men to ever coach football, would have easily had us play­ing in a National (GolD Championship at season's end. But more importantly, there wouldn't be any excuses being made. None of this "it takes five years to implement a system" or "we played hard and things didn't go our way" BS. Any other coach wouldn't make excuses, he would just get it done. 
Then there's the recruiting, or lack thereof, for that matter. Sure, Cheis gets up at 4 a.m. every day to start working, but how inept is he if he can't get things done dur­ing normal working hours? At least Twillingham could get things finished by noon or so and hit the back nine before sunset. I just question Cheis' work ethic and commitment to the job. Furthermore, why are we looking at recruits for two years from now? Shouldn't Cheis be concerned with teaching the guys about integrity and character in the 
spring? Again, I just don't think he has his priorities straight. 
And finally, there's the reason no one wants to talk about, but I'll say it. Affirmative action. I know we cele­brate diversity at Notre Dame, as should all institutions for that matter. But hiring a guy like 
Cheis just to paint a prettier pic­ture of Notre Dame, with little regard to his actual football know-how and coaching abili­ty, is just plain wrong. 
How long will it take for us to realize that Cheis is just floun­dering about in this profession with no real plans or direction for how we're going to win games? Hopefully, the administration and Board of Trustees will see this situation 
for what it really is and act.

I am writing in response to Iworship Humsfeld 's March 27 letter to the editor, which was written in response to my· March 25 letter titled "The war in Iraq is an inexcusable moral outrage." 
After thoughtfully reading Rumsfeld's letter multiple times and carefully consid­ering her opinion of our country's current military action in Iraq, I have come to the conclusion that she is in fact correct and President George W. Bush was wise to invade that country. 
As Rumsfeld so eloquently and convinc­ingly states, Saddam Hussein was a cruel dictator who needed to be removed from power in order to ensure world stability. The fact that our original purpose for going to war -finding and destr.oying weapons of mass destruction -turned out to be a farce does not diminish the fact that the Iraqi people now have the joy of living under a peaceful system of democracy. 
Nor does the now-obvious lack of ties between Hussein and Al-Qaeda under­mine the infrastructure building we are doing in cities like Baghdad and Basrah. In her Pointless letter, Rumsfeld also con­vinced me that not only should the United States government keep our troops in Iraq, the number of troops should actually be increased. It was silly of me to think our presence was "disruptive and deadly" as I stated in my original letter. 
Our soldiers are not viewed as the enemy, they are seen as liberators just as they were in Vietnam 40 years ago. "United States marin.es serving in Iraq are

After being a strong opponent of the war in Iraq for the last three years, I am tremendously grateful to Rumsfeld and the Pointless section of The Absurder for showing me the errors of my ways and ­pushing me to reconsider my stance. The Pointless section continues to serve as a wonderful forum for intelligent and hon­est discussion on seriously global issues such as the Iraq war and the Notre Dame mascot.

"I win. It's what I do," Cheis said Wednesday from his throne in the Guglielmino Center. "Whether it's football or television, I win. I've never lost." 
At any point during the day, a student will be able to rm:eive messages and watch press confenmce re-runs with their "favorite Irish coach," a press relpase, a.k.a. e-mail, from sports information diroc­tor Bug Chalker read Thursday evening. 
The athletic department sees the move as essential in main­taining the "tradition and wholeness" of the Notre Dame image. 
"See, the thing we weren't comfortable with, in a sense ­with the way things were play­ing out here -is that students could obtain information from other sources about coach Weis," Notre Dame assistant athletic director Jim Liesler, referring to Intt1rnet and print media sources that actually followed Notre Dame football, too. "And that wouldn't benefit all the parties involved, includ­ing the athletie department. We can't have any kind of well­rounded perspectives here. 
"One clear message gets the point aeross." 

Cheis was out on campus Thursday promoting the televi­sion venture, showing brief elips as examples of the net­work's programming. At one point during a slide show in LaFortune Ballroom, Cheis stopped the presentation and made three inattentive mem­bers of the audience do pushups.

In a stunning move, Notre Dame athletic director Kevin Black announced Thursda,y Notre Dame would be leaving the Big East Conference to join the Colonial Athletic Association· in pursuit of bas­ketball greatness. 
"As we watch George Mason in the Final Four this weekend, our fans can now realize that next year that can be Notre Dame," Black said in a press conference. "We expect nothing but the best from our basketball pro­gram, and this is the step in the right direction."

DVD REVIEW 
Acting powers 'Violence' 

Photo courtesy of movieweb.com David Cronenberg's "A History of Violence" centers on Tom Stall (Viggo Mortensen). Stall shows an eerie violent streak when his diner is nearly robbed. 
By MOLLY GRIFFIN Assistant Scene Editor 
The title of the film "A History of Violence" doesn't lie -the film is raw, bloody and emotionally devastating. It boasts fantastic performances from a bevy of talented actors, and while the story gets lost at times in the sheer grittiness of the film, it is a deeply powerful portrayal of one of humani­ty's most basic instincts. 
"A History of Violence" centers on Tom Stall (Viggo Mortensen), a seem­ingly normal everyman living in a small town in Indiana. His life changes radically when he displays a somewhat eerie proficiency for killing when his diner is almost robbed. His violent act, while portrayed as heroic, only leads. to greater and more esca­lated violence in the

senseless, youthful to sexual, and it reveals the destructive power in all of these forms. The story itself in the film, while important, is truly in place so as to allow violence to occur and wreak bloody havoc on the characters, reveal­ing its universally damaging effects. 
Acting emerges as the greatest draw in "A History of Violence," with wrenching performances from numer­ous characters. Mortensen manages to balance the family man warmth and cold-blooded killing instincts that his character exhibits with great skill, while Maria Bello is a whirlwind of emotions as his wife Edie. Supporting comes from Ed Harris and William Hurt, who was nominated for an Oscar in the Best Supporting Actor category for his work in "A History of Violence." 
Director David Cronenberg doesn't shy away from showing

violent images. This unflinching portrayal of violence is alternately disturbing and powerful, and is what ultimately gives the film its gut ­wrenching emotional impact. 
"A History of Violence" is part of a recent trend in Hollywood -films based on graphic novels. The film is based on the work by Vince Locke and John Wagner and joins recent graphic novel -inspired cine­ma like "Sin City" and "V for Vendetta." 
The DVD of "A History of Violence" features a number of features that enhance the viewing of the film. There is audio commentary from Cronenberg that provides some insight into the film as a whole, and there are three fea­turettes included as well. The first, "Violence's History: U.S. vs. International Versions," compares the 
U.S. cut of the film to the more graphic international release. "Too Commercial for Cannes" looks at the film's release at the French film festival, while the third feature "Act of Violence," which 
clocks in at 65 minutes, provides the entire back­


"The Unmaking of Scene 
44" which details how the scene was made and why it was ulti­mately axed from the film. 
The graphic, brutal nature of "A History of Violence" can make it diffi­cult to stomach. But the film provides a deeply moving commentary on the role of violence, not only within families but as part of human nature as a whole. 
The extras on the DVD add insight into the film's purpose, but in the end, it is the film itself that stands alone as a somewhat complicated work. While viewers may leave the film with con­flicted feelings, it is impossible to remain untouched by the raw emotion­al power of the film.

Associated Press 
DURHAM, N.C. -The lawyers for Duke men's lacrosse players said Thursday that police and an outraged community will owe the team an apology after DNA tests are completed -tests they said will prove no one on the team raped an exotic dancer. 
Four attorneys repre­senting nearly all the 46 players forced to give samples protested what they said was a presump­tion that their clients attacked the dancer or kept quiet about what happened. No one has been charged. 

"We believe that the DNA will show that that this not true. We believe that a full and complete and fair investigation will show that it is not true," lawyer Joe Cheshire said. 
Investigators are still collecting evidence, but District Attorney Mike Nifong has said in recent days he already believes a crime occurred. Even if the state crime lab's DNA analysis proves inconclu­sive or doesn't provide a match for any of the ath­letes, Nifong has said he'll have other evi­dence. 
"If the only thing that we ever have in this case is DNA, then we wouldn't have a case," Nifong said Wednesday. 
This week, university president Richard Brodhead suspended the highly ranked team from play until the school learns more about the accusations. But Cheshire said Nifong and police have created a mob mentality that has tainted the men "before the evidence has all come out in a way that they will never recover." 
Nifong's office did not return calls Thursday seeking a response to the criticism. 
English professor Melissa Malouf said she is one of those prepared 
_,. 
....... 
for the DNA tests to prove inconclusive . 
"I don't think the DNA is the case," she said after speaking at an out­door protest near Brodheag's office. "Guys can wear condoms." 
According to the appli­cation for a court order seeking DNA samples from the team, a nurse trained to treat rape vic­tims and a physician who treated the woman said they witnessed symptoms consistent with sexual 

-
assault. The document also includes details of a search of the house where the woman said she was raped for about a half-hour. 
IN BRIEF 
Ochoa ties record for best 
round in an LPGA major 
RANCHO MIRAGE, Calif.-Lorena Ochoa had only 100 or so people following her record round Thursday in the Kraft Nabisco Championship, which was fine with her. She was able to hear that familiar voice, her father urging her to attack the flags and stick it close. 
"Just like this," Javier Ochoa said to her after Ochoa began the first round with a 9-iron to 2 feet birdie. 
And she obeyed; knocking down flags on a calm morning in the desert, piling up birdies until she was in the record books with a 10­under 62 that gave her a four-shot lead over 16-year-old Michelle Wie. 
Wie got all the attention and matched her best score on the LPGA Tour, a bogey-free 66 in which she played with poise and precision and had a birdie putt on every hole. 

Boeheim wants to see more 
teams in tourney 
INDIANAPOLIS -Jim Boeheim wants more schools playing in the NCAA tournament, and his ·coaching­colleagues appear to agree. 
The Syracuse coach believes the tournament field should expand from its current 65 teams and hopes to start lobbying for an increase Friday during a meeting with the National Association of Basketball Coaches. 
"I have a number in mind, I think it should probably be about four to six, somewhere in there," Boeheim said Thursday. "The problem really is that it shouldn't come down to logistics." 
The field expanded from 48 to 64 in 1985, then added a 65th team to the field in 2001 when the NCAA increased the number of automatic bids from 30 to 31. 
Boeheim believes the rapid increase in Division I schools, to more than 300, and increased parity, as demonstrated by George Mason reaching the Final 
-
Four, indicates its time to include more teams. Roddick continues slide 
with loss to Ferrer 
KEY BISCAYNE, Fla. -Andy Roddick shanked a service return, sending the shot straight up, then took off his cap and used it to catch the ball. 
Give Roddick credit for trying to make the best of a difficult day. He hit another bump in his bid to shake an early-season slump Thursday, losing to David Ferrer 6-3, 4-6, 6-4 in the quar­terfinals of the Nasdaq-100 Open. 
Roddick, who slipped from third to ­fourth in the rankings last week, has yet to reach a final this year. 
"I feel a lot better leaving this tourna­ment than I did a couple of days before this tournament," he said. "I feel like I'm on the verge of playing really good tennis again." 
Roddick's biggest weapon -the serve-betrayed him against the 11th­seeded Ferrer. In the first set he made only 35 percent of his first serves.

MLB 
Anna Benson askS for divorce fro111 Orioles pitcher husband 
Associated Press 
FOHT LAUDEHDALii -Anna Benson has requested a divorce from Baltimore Orioles pitcher Kris Benson, who still believes the New York Mets traded him in response to actions by his impulsive wife. 
Anna Benson, an actress and model who has posed topless, liled for divoree in Atlanta on Thursday. The petition for divoree elaims the marriage is 
"irretrievably broken." The eouple has been mar­ried for seven years. 
Kris Benson initially protest­ed the deal that sent him to the Orioles. But now he thinks the Mets did him a favor. 
"I was a little upset because I enjoyed my time in New York and I feel like they had a good team coming into the season," Benson said in a recent inter­view. "But now that I realize the opportunity I have, it's going to be a good eareer 
move for me." Now, it appears as if he will go at it alone. 

In 2005, his first full season with the Mets, Benson allowed three runs or fewer in 19 starts. He was 10-8 with a· 
4.31 ERA, but New York won 17 of the 28 games in which he pitehed. 
Despite those numbers, the right-hander was traded to the Orioles in January for pitchers Jorge Julio and John Maine. There was speculation 

that the deal was.perpetuated by the behavior of Anna, who has her own web site and pub­licly discussed intimate details of their sex life. 
Mets general manager Omar Minaya contended that Anna Benson was not a factor in the trade. Kris Benson isn't buy­ing it. 
"New York is just a world of its own. I knew that coming in, but you learn that a little more when you get put in the spotlight like that in a nega­tive and undeserving way," Kris Benson said. "It was a lit­tle frustrating at the time beeause people kind of believe what they read. For her it's been a little tough, because 
they kind of portray her in  a  
negative light."  
Anna  Benson  wore  a  

provocative dress at the team Christmas party, and there was talk that she was consid­ering posing nude for Playboy. Kris Benson bristles at the memory.

NCAA MEN'S BASKETBALL 
100,000 fans expected in Indy for Final Four 
Associated Press 
INDIANAPOLIS Marc Sawyer figures he won't sleep much this weekend. 
The 21-year-old UCLA senior was flying with sfweral friends to Columbus. Ohio, late Friday, then renting a car and driving three hours to Indianapolis. Once here, he'll don a blue and yellow outfit that includes col­ored glasses, gym shorts, a T­shirt, knee socks and a pompom to cheer on the Bruins in the Final Four before returning to Los Angeles 30 minutes before his first class Tuesday morning. 
Whirlwind trip? You bet. 

"We're just running on adren­aline once we get there," said Sawyer, a San Diego resident who is president of The Den, UCLA's student athletics fan club. "We're not even going to want to sleep." 
Thanks to a monthlong buildup, multimillion-dollar ad campaigns and celebrity-stud­ded entertainment, this year's Final Four will be a far cry from the event's humble beginnings in 1939, when only eight teams competed for the title. This weekend, when an expected 100,000 fans descend on down­town Indianapolis for the culmi­nation of a nationwide basket­ball frenzy, the tourney will have transformed itself into a full-out extravaganza. 
"When a sporting event moves to the next level and becomes a big event, it's more than just attending the games 

0 GlUT UVE BANDS... 
NIGBI 

-it becomes a destination point on everybody's calendar of events," said John Rowady, president of rEvolution, a Chicago sports marketing agency that partnered with the NCAA to promote various game packages. "I think (the Final Four) has moved into the realm of being a rival to the Super Bowl." 
Included in the lineup is a free, two-day music festival headlined by Indiana rocker John Mellencamp and featuring last season's "American Idol" winner, Carrie Underwood. 
The NCAA's Hall of Champions museum will be open for a marathon 100 straight hours to mark the gov­erning body's centennial. Thousands of entertainment­minded fans were expected to visit an interactive festival at the Indiana Convention Center. 
That doesn't count the scores of private parties, hospitality rooms and VIP events for spe­cial ticket holders and corpo­rate partners who have shelled out thousands of dollars for all­inclusive Final Four packages. 
All the while, CBS will be broadcasting games on 11 jumbo screens throughout downtown. 
"I think consumers expect more of a total fan experience now," said Vince Thompson, president and chief executive officer of the Atlanta-based Creative Presence Partners, which is working with the NCAA and Coca Cola Co. to put on the musical festival. 
Fans aren't the only ones demanding more. 
Big corporations use tickets to top sporting events such as the Final Four, the Super Bowl, the Masters golf championship and the Kentucky Derby to schmooze their best customers. 
"The Final Four is becoming one of the premier events in the country from a corporate per­spective," said David Lord, chief executive of RazorGator and PrimeSport, an online ticket broker based in Los Angeles. "It's becoming more and more the approach of the big spon­sors to leverage these events as opportunities to get close to their big clients." 
RazorGator expects to send as many as 4,000 customers to the Final Four -half of them through corporate packages that include work meetings, a casino night and special appearances by top coaches and players. 
Evolution's premier package costs $55,000 and includes 10 lower-level seats in the RCA Dome, a four-night downtown hotel stay and access to other VIP events.

NBA 
Pacers honor Miller, .... fall to Phoenix, 114-104 

Marion scores 29 to lead Suns, Indiana has lost 6 of 8 games 
Associated Press INDIANAPOLIS -The capaci­ty crowd that showed up at Conseco Fieldhouse to watch Reggie Miller's jersey retire­ment ceremony had nearly van­ished by the fourth quarter. That's because the Pacers didn't resemble the team Miller turned into a contender with his countless clutch shots. Shawn Marion scored 29 points, Steve Nash nearly had a triple-double, and the Phoenix Suns beat Indiana 114-104 Thursday night to snap a two­game losing streak. Nash finished with 15 points, 13 assists and eight rebounds. "Miller Time" never came because the Pacers were out of the game so early. Phoenix led 58-44 at halftime and 92-78 at thH end of the third quarter. Phoenix entered the game averaging a league-best 108 points. The Suns' offense was too sharp for Indiana's fourth­ranked scoring defense. "They had some bigger guys," Marion said. "We were trying to force the tempo of the game. They couldn't run with us and it showed." Indiana got no eloser than nine points in the second half. "They make you play their 
-
tempo," Indiana point guard Anthony Johnson said. "If you don't make shots, they can dominatn you. We would put up a string of baskets and you look up at the board and you're still down by 12." 
Peja Stojakovic scored 25 points and reserve Danny Granger added 16 for the Pacers, who were again without Jermaine O'Neal to start the game and watched their injury woes grow during it. 
Indiana (35-36) has lost six of its last eight games and dropped below .500 for just the second time this season. 
"I don't think anybody in this locker room expected to be one game under .500 at this point," Johnson said. "I don't think anybody expected to be one game under any time this sea­son. We can talk about it, but now it's time to just show up and play ball." 
Phoenix (48-23) bounced back from back-to-back blowout defeats. The Suns lost 110-72 at New Jersey on Monday and 132-110 at Milwaukee on Tuesday. 
"Wn're back to the team we were, the team that won 47 games," Phoenix coach Mike D'Antoni said. "We're going to be pretty good. Those other two games we got out of synch a lit­tle bit, started pressing a little bit." 
O'Neal was inactive after reaggravating his groin injury earlier in the week. Stephen Jackson sprained his ankle in the second quarter and did not return, and center Scot Pollard missed the second half with a sore foot. 
"We knew they were coming in undermanned, so we really needed to get this one tonight," Nash said. "They still have a lot of dangerous guys on that team, even without Jermaine O'Neal." 
The Suns shot 52 percent from the field and forced 17 turnovers.

Belles try to avenge defeat 
Saint Mary's will face Olivet Nazarene and Wheaton this weekend 
By GREG ARBOGAST 
Sports Writer 

Coming off its first confer­ence loss, Saint Mary's will have a chance to get back in the win column when it takes on Olivet Nazarene at 2 p.m. today and Wheaton College at 5 p.m. Saturday in the Jack Schwarz Memorial Classic Tournament in Wheaton, Ill. 
As this weekend's tourna­ment is sandwiched between eonference matches, the Belles players will have a brief reprieve from the pres­sure of the conference sched­ule. The team hopes to put that break to good use, sen­ior Kristen Palombo said. 
"Tournaments like this take the pressure off for a little while because we know that no matter what happens, it won't affect our conference standing," Palombo said. "We're able to try new things in these matches, and we're able to work on parts of our game that we might not be comfortable using in confer­ence matches." 
Saint Mary's will still be taking this weekend's match­es seriously, though, and will be facing some difficult com­petition. Olivet Nazarene has won two NAIA Region III-VII Championships and made three NAJA National Tournament appearances since 2001. This year, Olivet 

Belles junior Kelly McDavitt hits a shot against Albion April17, 2005. Saint Mary's will play Olivet Nazarene and Wheaton this weekend. 
Nazarene boasts a 3-1 record, having won their last three matches. 
-Wheaton will present an even greater challenge for the Belles, as they enter this weekend with a record of 6-0 and are currently ranked No. 
18  in  the  nation  by  the  
Intercollegiate  Tennis  
Association.  

In addition, two of Wheaton's players are ranked in the region. 
Freshman .JQrdan Hook is currently the No. 5 player in the central region, and she comes into this weekend with an unblemished record of 19­0.

The team, however, sees the benefits of playing against such strong competi­tion. 
"No matter what happens regarding the outcome, it makes you a better player," Palombo said. "You have to try harder, come up with shots you didn't know you had, and you have to expand your game."

MEN'S GOLF 
Squad to play in Augusta 
ND will try to bounce back from mediocre finishes during break 
By JOE QUINN Sports Writer 
Notre Dame will head south 

to Augusta, Ga. this weekend 
to take part in the Augusta 
State Invitational at 
Champions Retreat Golf Club. 
After finishing eighth at the Border Olympics March 18 and 11th at the General Jim Hackler Invitational March 13, the Irish are anxious to start competing for tournament championships, and, Irish coach Jim Kubinski said, there's no better place for that than Augusta. 
"Just the name Augusta brings to mind thoughts of championship golf," Kubinski said. "I feel we are ready to start playing our A-game, and what better place to do it than Augusta, Georgia." 
Kubinski said he hopes this is the weekend where the team returns to the form it showed in the fall. 
"We had such a strong fall season, I just want the guys to match that this weekend," he said. "We played top-20 golf [all fall] and now is the time to prove to everyone else that we are a top-20 program." 
The Irish will take on some 

of the top teams in the country 

in Augusta. UCLA leads the 
field coming in ranked No. 5 in 
the country according to the 
GCANBridgestone Top 25. 
In addition to the Bruins, the 

tournament field boasts three

Tennessee  State  (No.  11),  
Tennessee  (No.  12)  and  
Clemson (No. 14).  

Besides the four top-20 teams, there are five more teams just outside the top 25 and the top ranked team in Division II, South Carolina ­Aiken. 
While the Irish are one of the few teams competing in Augusta that is not ranked in the top 50, Kubinski said he is confident about their chances. 
"If we can play like I know we can play, we'll show that we're closer to the team we were in the fall than the one that's been playing this spring," he said. 
Kubinski is going to tweak his line-up for the weekend, adding freshman Josh Sandman. Sandman's out­standing play in qualifying rounds this past week, accord­ing to Kubinski, is the reason for the move. 
"We played in three [qualify­ing rounds] this past week and [Josh] finished behind only Cole [lsban] and Scott [Gustafson]," Kubinski said. 
Kubinski said Sandman's proficiency near the hole will help the Irish this weekend. 
"[Josh] always exhibits fan­tastic short game. I'm hoping he'll add a little something to the mix down in Augusta," Kubinski said.

Sharapova advances 
I   

on opponents InJury 
Russian star fails to convert four match points, endures boos 
Associated Press 
KEY BISCAYNE, Fla. -Maria 

Sharapova blew a big lead, 
drew boos for taking a bath­
room break and won only when 
opponent Tatiana Golovin was 
forced to retire in tears 
because of an ankle injury. 
The hollow victory Thursday 

night earned Sharapova a 
berth in the final at the 
Nasdaq-100 Open. 
Sharapova failed to convert 

four match points in the second 
set and played for another 7 5 
minutes before Golovin twisted 
her left ankle and fell chasing a 
shot in the corner. 
A trainer taped Golovin's 

ankle. The French teenager 
played one more point, hitting 
a return wide, then called it 
quits with Sharapova serving 
and leading 6-3, 6-7 (5), 4-3, 
ad in. 
The stadium was less than 

half full when the match ended 
at 11:40 p.m. EST, but the fans 
were noisy. Three times they 
jeered Sharapova for taking a 
break leading 5-4 in the second 
set. 
The interruption didn't deter 

Golovin, who won the crowd's 
favor by completing her come­
back from a 5-1 deficit in the 
set to force a third set. 
No. 4-seeded Sharapova's 

opponent in the final Saturday 
will be No. 12 Svetlana 
Kuznetsova, who advanced by 
beating top-ranked Amelie 
Mauresmo for the second time 
in five weeks, 6-1, 6-4. 
Andy Roddick hit another 

bump in his bid to shake an 
early-season slump, losing to 
David Ferrer 6-3, 4-6, 6-4 in 
the men's quarterfinals. 
Roddick, who slipped from 
third to fourth in the rankings 
last week, has yet to reach a 
final this year. 
"I feel a lot better leaving this 

tournament than I did a couple 
of days before this tourna­
-

ment," he said. "I" feel like I'm on the verge of playing really good tennis again." 
The loss cost Roddick a shot at top-ranked Roger Federer in the semifinals. Defending champion Federer rallied from a break down in the opening set and beat No. 9-seeded James Blake 7-6 (2), 6-4. 
Federer extended winning streaks of 25 consecutive matches against Americans, 46 matches in a row in the United States and a record 22 in a row in Masters Series events. He has reached the semifinals in his past 13 tournaments. 
"Maybe I'm a slow learner," said Blake, who also lost to Federer in the Indian Wells final two weeks ago. "But he doesn't make it easy. I'm start­ing to feel like one of those bas­ketball players in the early '90s. You feel like you make Michael Jordan play well, but then every time he comes up and beats you and makes you realize why he's the best." 
Like Federer, Sharapova is bidding for back-to-hack titles after winning at Indian Wells. She's 2-2 against fellow Russian Kuznetsova, winning their past two meetings. 
Sharapova led the No. 22­seeded Golovin 5-1 in the sec­ond set and held four match points serving at 5-3. But the situation inspired Golovin to raise her level of play, and she hung on by winning a series of long rallies to cut the deficit to ­5-4. 
Sharapova requested a bath­room break. Because of the timing of the request, the chair umpire initially turned her down before relenting. 
Fans jeered as Sharapova trotted off the court and booed again when she returned. 
Golovin twice held serve to force the tiebreaker. She reached set point at 6-5, then hit a forehand that skipped off the net cord and landed on the baseline for a winner. Sharapova challenged the call, but instant replay confirmed the ruling, and the crowd erupted.

Belles look to defend Purple and White title 
Squad set new course record last season at Foxfire Golf Club 
By BECKI DORNER Sports Writer 
The Belles will look to defend their championship at the Purple and White Invitational, hosted by Capital University this weekend at the Foxfire Golf Club in Lockbourne, Ohio. 
The Belles shot a tourna­ment record 357 as a team last year to defeat 12 other teams at the Players Club Course. 
Capital University comes into the meet off a win last weekend, shooting a total of 352 to triumph over Ohio Northern by two strokes. The Crusaders were led by Charissa Mills on Sunday who fired a team-best 85 to tie for third-place, while Emma Stowe was two strokes behind with an 87. The meet begins Friday morn­ing at the Players Club Course before moving to the Foxfire course on Saturday for the final round. 
Megan Mattia, last season's Michigan Intercollegiate Athletic Association (MIAA) most valuable player, will look to improve on her top-20 fin­ish at the tournament last year. 
Mattia and the Belles fin­ished 11th in cold and snowy conditions last weekend at the Northern Kentucky Spring Invitational. 
Mattia led the Belles with an 82 on day one and a 79 on day two for a total of 161 (+17) ­good enough to earn her 30th place in the 91-golfer field. The Belles showed off their young talent with contribu­tions from a sophomore ­Katie O'Brien with a score of 169 in 49th place and a fresh­man -Alex Sei with a score of 177 for 66th place and fin­ished ahead of Division I ­Dayton. 
In addition to Mattia, the other two seniors made big contributions. Nicole Bellino had a score of 171 good enough for 56th place and Kirsten Fantom had a score of 175 for 63rd place.

Sporrs Wrircr 
After an 11-5 victory over Brown Wednesday. Notre Dame looks to finish the week undefeated when they take on Dartmouth at Moose Krause Stadium Sunday at 12 p.m. 
Notre Dame's 11 goals against Brown marked its largest scoring output of the season, and Irish head coach Kevin Corrigan said he is look­ing for his team talked about the Brown game as a statement game. After sullkinntfy making their statement ·wednesday, Corrigan said the Irish will look at Sunday's game as a momentum-builder. 
"We know how important it is to have momentum going into league play," Corrigan said. "It's not just momentum for league play, though, because every game counts for the NCAAs. The last two years we've benn the seventeenth team in the 16-team NCAA tournament. If there's any­body who knows that every game counts, it's us."

"I dnfinitely think that the Albany game is more indica­tive of who Dartmouth is," senior co-captain DJ Driscoll said. "They just never really got into the Maryland game. We're going to expect the best from them." 
Notre Dame rested Thursday after its game Wednesday, and they haven't had much time to prepare for Dartmouth. 
"Coming off a short week, the game is more about your match-ups and less about adapting to the other team, so we're going to focus more on ourselves," Corrigan said.

Team to host outdoor event 
Distance runners to participate in Nike Stanford Invitational 
By DAN MURPHY Sporrs Wrirer 

The Irish team welcomes four regional foes Saturday to Moose Krause Stadium for the first outdoor home meet of the season. 
The last time Notre Dame hosted an outdoor lwnw meet was almost two years ago on April :~. 2004. The team hopes to repeat their effort in that meet. which earned Notre Damn 10 event victories. 
"The early season meets are all about getting some good times under your belt and starting ofT the ypar in a 
strong way," said sophomore sprinter Zaeh l.abrecque. 
Labrecque will run the I 00 and 200-meter races for the Irish Saturday.· 
Notrn Dame will also snn its first conference action of the out­door season as DePaul eomes to South Bend. The meet will thn Blue Demon's 
lOth in the 400-meter run. 
Detroit-Mercy of the Horizon League, whose full team will be at Notre Dame this week­end, also sent three of their 
runners to the indoor invitation­al held at the Loftus Center in February. 
Another Horizon League team.. Loyola­Chicago, will also be competing this weekend. The Ham bier men opened up their outdoor season placing 12th in Tuscaloosa, Ala. at the Alabama Belays. The 
women's team failed to place dnspite thH 4 x 100 relay team setting a new school record

On thP women's side, Molly lluddle and Stephanie Madiit will make tlw trip to Palo Alto. lluddle makes her season debut aftpr sitting out th1~ win­ter with a leg injury. 
"A lot of the girls havn bonn running well in thn past fnw weeks and they are showing that tlwy are ready to raee fast," Madia said. "We are all excited to get some regional quafiliPrs this weekend." 
Madia traditionally runs the livn-kilometer event but is giv­ing hnrsPif a break this week­end after qualifying for the NCAA Hegional Tournament last wenknnd in Tucson. Ariz. She will competn. in the 1,500 meter run.

Emma helped organize some of the pilgrims, assisting chief organizer Pat Heis, a 1985 graduate of Notre Dame. Heis has been making annual pilgrim­ages since he was in college.

trip and see where the big, concrete marker that's seen in a lot of Notre Dame football films is," Reis said. "So they said, 'Let's go find that thing.' So they set off for the Middle­of-Nowhere, Kansas when they met this Easter Heathman guy who gave them a tour. And we've been doing it ever since -and the last 20 years since we graduated." 
Reis said around 7 5 pilgrims made the journey in 1991 to celebrate the 60th anniversary, which has been the largest turnout since they began the pilgrimage. 
Jim Sears, a fellow member of the class of 1985, said his trips to the crash site began in 1984 when he and his friend AI Gates, a 1984 Notre Dame graduate, decided on March 30 to drive to Kansas that night. 
"I had a road atlas in my car, and I used to page through it decided to make the trip. 
"I put the two things together and called up the one person I knew was doing less homework than I was -AI Gates -and I proposed it to him, and he did­n't hesitate -he said, 'Let's go,"' Sears said. ")The monument] salutes our alma mater Notre Dame and all the things Rockne did. 
"This is another 

way to celebrate this ... great man." 
Since then, a contingent of Notre Dame alum­ni and "subway alums" -fans of Heathman was a 14-year-old out in the fields and one of the first to arrive at the scene. He has been guiding visitors to the site ever since. 
But Heathman's sister, Sue Ann Brown, and Heis organ­ized most of the pilgrimage this year, with the help of some friends like Emma. 
Heis said this year's pilgrim­age has attracted greater attention than any of the previ­ous ones, thanks in large part to the notability of a 75th anniversary, combined with the accessibility of the Internet -something that was not available for widespread use before the 60th anniversary. 
"There's definitely a height­ened interest this time," Reis said. "It is a tragic day -you lose site of that sometimes. It is a celebration of Knute Hockne's life and the seven other people who died that day. We try to celebrate their lives in the best way, but at the same time, it's a very tragic event; it's somber." 
The range of emotions and motivations for different pil­grims will be mixed, Heis said.

In the second game of the series, Notre Dame junior right-hander Jeff Manship will take the mound for the Irish for Saturday's 1:05 p.m. first pitch. 
Manship will face Panthers junior righty ace Paul Nardozzi. Nardozzi is 4-2 in six starts with a 3.32 ERA and 49 strikeouts in 43.1 innings pitched. 
Mainieri said Pittsburgh's strikeout ability will minimize the Irish hit-and-run game. In part because of a slew of failed hit-and-runs this year, the Irish are just 28-of-47 on stolen base attempts. 
The series finale begins at 

1:05 Sunday and will pit Notre Dame senior lefty Tom Thornton 
hands of West Virginia in 
Morgantown last weekend. 
"You have to respect all your opponents, and we know Pittsburgh is a very good team," Mainieri said. "Pittsburgh's like a wounded dog right now with [its back] against the wall." 
The Irish enter having won four in a row. Sophomore hurler Wade Korpi threw a complete game shutout ahd struck out 11 batters against Western Michigan Wednesday. 
"You define momentum in baseball as the perfonriance of your starting pitching ­and Wade Korpi gave us great momentum," Mainieri said. 
Notre Dame enters the series batting .293 with an on­base percentage of .395. Mainieri said that while the oyerall numbers are good, the Irish still lack consistency. 
"It's the heart of the order, the middle of the order ­where you should be getting your greatest production ­that has been so inconsistent for us," he said. "If we can just figure out a way to score 

holding opposing hitters to a .225 batting average. 
Thornton comes in after nearly throwing his second straight shutout against Georgetown March 25. He threw eight-plus innings with­out allowing an earned run but was relieved in the ninth as two infield errors allowed three Hoyas runners to score. 
Despite the late-game lapses in Thornton's last start, Mainieri remains confident in the Irish defense. 
"If we could get a little bit more consistent on offense ... we can be a pretty dangerous team," he said. "And with our pitching and defense, some­times it doesn't take a lot of runs to win the game." 
Mainieri said he is confident in his team but knows the dangers of a struggling Pittsburgh squad. 
"They know this is a critical weekenp for them, too," he said. "They're going to come out there and really battle."
