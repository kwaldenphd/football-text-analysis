News in brief 
Carter Administration reduces aid to Nicaragua 
WASHINGTON (AP)--The Carter administratit>n, stung by Nicaragua's rejection of U.S.-supported mediation efforts, announced Thursday a drastic reduction in economic aid to the utin American country and a trimming of the U.S. embassy '-staff by one-half. All 21 Peace Cores volunteers will be withdrawn and no new assistance until President Anastasio Somoza indicates a change in policy, State Department spokesman Hodding Carter said. Despite the strons action against the Somoza government, however, the administration stopped short of a complete break with Nicaragua. Mauricio Solaun, the U.S. ambassador, will remain at his post. Aid programs "which are well advanced" will continue, Carter said. 
Senate committee confirms Woodcock as ambassallor 
WASHINGTON (AP)--The Senate Foreign Relations Committee voted 12-1 Thursday for confirmation of Leonard Woodcock as the first U.S. ambassador to China since 1949. Despite the vote, committee members said Woodcock's nomination will become entangled in a Senate floor battle over the future security of Taiwan. The sole vote against appointment ofthe former United Auto Workers union president was cast by Sen. ] esse Helms, R-N.C., a vocal opJ?<>nent of President Carter'~ new China policy. Helms said his w/te against Woodcock had nothing to do with the CJ.ualifications of the former UAW chief. Instead, the senator satd, it was intended to reflect his opposition to Carter's decision to drop recognition of Taiwan while simultaneously extending it to Peking. ,

yesterday about wavering Ameri~ can support, Bakhtiar broke into English to say, "I don't know. You can ask President Carter. Not me." 
Reverting to French, he added, "if the American government its assistance, so much the better. If it doesn't so what?" 
Bakhtiar also was asked about vows by Khomeini's forces to operate government ministries with employees now on strike against Bakhtiar. 
''As long as this is talk, there's no problem. But if they take action, I will resist,'' the prime minister said. 
Khomeini's civilian supporters have already taken over some government functions in Isfahan, Com. Qom, Shiraz and other cities. 
Bakhtiar challenged Khomeini to form a legitimate political parry with a clear program. "It's a different thing from /utting people on the streets an giving them slogans they don't even understand... he prefers the streets. He prefers the rnob." 
He said he would submit to the outcome ofa national referendum conducted by his opponents in "calm and democracy," not with ''~renades and Molotov cock­tatls." 
He told reporters he might call national elections in five or six

Bakhtiar said at the news conference he was willing to resume contacts with Bazargan ''to fmd solutions to the problems of unity."

Later she illustrated what she sees as a grossly unjust economic situation: "Right now, the work­er in the field gets less than 25 cents for picking a 33 lb. basket of tomatoes. You and I can buy one can for around :35 cents. Somebody's walking away with a bunch of money.'' 
A Cadena member, Ann Huber, attended a meeting of the Ohio migrant workers in Toledo this January, after hearing of the groups planned boycott.  
''What struck me wz;; that this is a grass roots movement,'' she said. "These workers just want enough money to live decently. They're just now learning how to organize, and they're trying to keep from being afraid of the huge corporations." 
Huber mentioned that the CADENA was attracted to the issue as a tie-in with the movie "The Grapes of Wrath", which was recently shown on campus. 
The Ohio farmworkers have asked for wage increases from 24 cents per hamper of tomatoes to 35 cents, and from a usual minimumof$2.65 to $3.25. They also want guarantees of at least 28 hours of work every two weeks. and a medical health plan. 
La Raza representative Ricardo Parra explamed that target of these demands is the canner rather than the small farmer or grower who cannot afford to provide insurance for his tempor­ary workers. 
"Who should be paying for the benefits that the farm workers need? The people that benefit most from the whole industry-­the large corporations,'' Parra said.

Benefit raises $1000 
byTim]oyce StaffR'eporter 

The benefit party held for Joe Camarda at Lee's Grill and Barbeque Wednesday nig~t was a huge success, according to employee G;,.\e Lighthall. The event raised $1,000 for Camarda. The money will be used to help pay for some expens~~ incurred during his recent hospttal stay. 
Camarda is the Notre Dame senior who was shot in his home on Corby Street on Dec.11. He is now recuperating in his home in Reston VA · 
The party, was originally sche­duled to take place from 5 p.m. to 12 a.m. but due to the large crowed did not break up until 1 a.m. 
"It went real good--it was a good time for all those who came. 
Those who dido' t come missed out on a good time -and an opportunity to help out Joe," Lighthall commented. 
Lgl:~hall had :-!oth.ing but 
praise for all those who helped 
make his idea a reality. "I want 
to thank all my bartenders, my 
family and the management 

down at Sunnyside Beverages, 
who helped us out a lot,'' he said. 
In addition to beer specials, a 

raffle was held and pnzes were 
awarded all night long, including 
beer mirrors, posters, t-shirts, 
and ashtrays, all donated by the 
~verage companies. 
When the party was over and the receipts were tallied, Light­hall said that he had reached hi his goal. "I said that we were going to raise a thousand dollars for Joe and we did. Speaking of 
Joe, we spoke to him during the 
party and he sends his regards to 
everyone,'' Li&hthall related. 
Lighthall satd that the intra­venous tubes were taken out of Camarda yesterday and he had his first solid meal since the shooting. "I just hope that it wasn't any super hot ribs," Lighthall quipped.

Cnuntless Iranians show support for anti -shah regime 
1EHRAN, Iran (AP)-Hundreds of soldiers marched along with a million other Iranians in Tehran yesterday in a show ofsupport for an anti-shah revolutionary ~ov­
errunent. But Prime Minister Shahpour Bakhtiar held his ground, vowing he will . not 
surrender power to a "mob." 
The leader of the ''transitional government'' trying to oust Bakhtiar was quoted as saying Washington has "indirectly" expressed a desire to establish good relationS with a future revolutionary regime. 
Marches here and in other Iranian cities were generally peaceful, but new political vio­lence flared in two provincial towns. 
In Gorgan, on the Capsian Sea, nine persons were reported killed and 26 others wounded when troops opened fire on anti-Bakhtiar protesters setting ftre to banks, shops and other buildings, the state radio said. 
Opposition spokesmen said that in the town of Koi, near the Turkish border, a group of Mullahs, Moslem-preachers, was attacked and badly beaten by a rival faction while in route to an opposition rally. 
State radio said more than one million people took part in the Tehran march in support of Ayatullah Ruhollah Khomeini's designation of a rival goverrunent headed by Moslem nationalist Mehdi Bazargan. 
Khomeini, who returned to Iran last week after leading the anti­shah movement from exile, want the Bakhtiar goverrunent to re­sign, the monarchy to be abolish­ed and a religiously oriented Islamic_ republic to· be estab­lished. The well-disciplines marchers recited in uruson from slogan sheets: "Bazargan, Bazargan, you are our prime minister!'' and "Bakhtiar, Bakhciar, you take 
orders from the U.S.A.!" 
Among them were more Iranian servicemen in uniform than had been seen before in such demonstrations here, rais­ing new questions about the loyalty of lower-ranking troops to the Bakhtiar government. Khomeini spokesmen said bet­ween 2,oo0 and 3,000 soldiers took part. Reporters on the scene counted at least 200 airmen in blue uniforms. 


Demonstrators carried five fatigue-clad soldiers on their shoulders, chancing "The army must obey-Bazargan! '' and toss­ing flowers at them. 
A Tehran newspaper published 
a photo furporung ~o show a throng o uniformed airmen saluting Khomeini outside his headquarters. Bakhtiar called the picture a ''complete fabrication,'' but a Bazargan spokesman insisted it was authentic and said the photo was taken from behind to prevent reprisals against the servicemen. 
The allegiance of the armed forces is expected to be the key to a resolution of Iran's political crisis. [continued on page 2]

Robinson explained. 
He added that he would be willing to discuss the second point m an open forum. 
Flyers and an advertisement in Monday's Observer classified section are attempting to meas­ure student interest in approach­ing the Administration and Food Service program to cancel the fines-on students' accounts. 
by Donald Schmzd 

Two students are protesting fines and charges imposed by the Notre Dame Food Services for receiving allegedly unauthorized meals on Jan. 16 during the registration period, prior to the beginning of the second semes­ter. 
Phil Blower, one of the stu­dents charged, claimed that in the past Food Services has not billed or fmed students $10 on registration days. "As far as I know there is no precedent of ftning students $10 on this viola­tion," he noted. 
According to Blower, a number of students entered the cafeteria lines on Jan. 16, and their cards registered "invalid" through the FOod Services computer checking system 
''The checkers then asked us if we were under a meal contract yet, and we replied 'no.' The checkers then said to ~o ahead and eat," Blower explamed. 
"We feel that when the check­ers allowed us to enter the dining hall for lunch, it was a verbal contract which invalidated the meal contract. It was very deceptive what they did,'' Blower the meru and the fmes has been the normal procedure. 
''The contract is very explicit,'' Robinson noted. He admitted that owing to the fact cards often flash invalid for various reasons and that as a courtesy the checke~s may let the students in. 
"However, I do ·not know of any checker who let in students knowing that they were not under contract. If this is the case, and this is still speculation, I woulcl cancel the $10 fme but not the charge for the meal they ate." Robinson said. 
Robinson added that only those students who did not purchase meal contracts later were ftned and that all others were only charged for the meal they ate that 
stated. 
However, a letter given to off-campus students explaining the terms of the meal contract reads: ''The meal plan available for off-campus students start with lunch on the first day of classes at the beginning of each semester ... based on the official undergraduate academic calen­dar. The first day of classes for the second semester was Wed­nesday Jan. 17. 
Robert Robinson, Notre Dame Food Service Director, commen­ted on the fines charged against the students' accounts. He said that charging students the cost of

 But Rusk, the former Secretary of State who marks his 70th birthday Friday, said in an inter­view that U.S. policy on China could not have been changed by the Democratic Kennedy and Johnson administations in which he served. 
"When I look back over the China question, and the role that has been played by the two major political parties, tt seems to me that the Republicans earned the right to find an answer to the 
-China question,'' Rusk observed. "My guess is that if President Kennedy had gone off to Peking, he would have been lacerated by the Republicans, including Richard Nixon. ''Sometimes there are things that one party can do that another party can't." Rusk recalled reviewing the options on Ch: ina with Kennedy in 1961 when the Democrats took power. ''He had in front of him a nearly unanimous resolution that Congress had passed two or three years earlier, strongly objecting to any change in the Chinese seat at the U.N. and on the matter of recognition,'' Rusk remembered. 
''On the day before the inauguration, President Eisen­hower said to him, 'lwill try to supJ;><>rt you as much as I can on foretgn policy matters, but on one matter I will have to oppose you, strongly and publicly, and that would have to be on a Chinese seat in the U.N.' ''So President Kennedy, who was rather cautious in selecting the items on which he was preP.ared . to do battle, decided he did not. want to open up the question at : 



Rusk reviews US policy change toward China 
all. 

"As I was leaving the office, he 
said, 'What's more, Mr. Secre­
tary, I don't want to read in The 
Washington Post or The New 
York Times that the State Depart­
ment is thinking about a change 
in the China policy'. 

"So I went back to the depart­ment, and when people like Adlai­Stevenson and Chester Bowles and others came to talk about China, I just played the role of the village idiot. 
"I didn't tell them about my talk with the president because we would be reading that in TI1e Washington Post or The New York Times." 
And yet, while Rusk clearly approves of the Nixon and Carter movt;s on China, he is appre­hen~tve about any suggestion of setttng Moscow and Peking against each other. That, he says, would be "kidstuff." 
"I don't, myself, believe that anyone should suppose we can play a childish game of maneuver between the Chinese and the Russians. 
Police determine shooting an accident 
NOR1H UlTLE ROCK,ARK. 
(AP)-Mter ~uestioning a witnss, 
witness, police are leaning to­
ward the theory that the shooting 
of a 21 year old llnited Press 
International reporter· was acci­
dental, Capt. Dale tlruce of the 
North Little Rock Police said 
today. 
Earlier, the police had said 
theY. thought the shooting was 
deljberate, even though they 
had been unable to establish a 
motive. 
Judy Danielak, hired by UPI as 
a temporary employee and 
assigned to cover the Ligislature, 
was found unconscious tn her car 
Tuesday night on Interstate 40. 
Bruce, who is captain of the 
detective division, siad authori~ 
ties had questioned a man who 
said he saw her car run off the 
right side of Interstate 40 as it 
travelled in the right land next to 
the shoulder. 
Officers have said the shot 
came through the passenger's 
side of the car, and they had 
previously speculated that 
another car had come alongside. 
But that would be unlikely if her 
car was near the right shoulder. 
"Possibly, it could have been a stray bullc.-t," Bruce said. 
In addition, Police Sgt. Walter Miles said the woman normally took another road home. She chose the interstate Tuesday night because it was snowins and she thoug,ht it would be eas1er to drive, Miles said. 
Bruce was asked if he believed 
the shooting was accidental. 
"That's what we're beginning 
to lean toward now," he said. 
Bruce said a bullet fragment removed from Mrs. Damelak's brain appeared to be lead, indica­ting it came from a pistol, not a rifle. 
He said the normal range of a handgun is "60-70 yards less than 100 yads for sure. " He said it was possible the bullet was fired from an access road that parallels the interstate, but no­body reported seeing a car on that road. Next to the access road is an open field.· 
"It was dark and I wouldn't think somebody would be out there hunting at that time," Bruce said. "It's a very odd situation. We don't have any­ring to base anything on.'' 

FDA warns mothers-to-be; alcohol causes defects 
WASHINGTON [AP] -Almost two years after warning pregnant women that drinking mcreases the risk of birth defects, the government said yesterday it will push a national education pro­gram before considering it a re­quirement for warning labels on alcoholic beverages. 
The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobac­co and Firearms said it would use warning labels on beer·, wine and liquor bottles as a last resort if the education program fails to arouse the public to the problem. Even though the Food and Drug Administration and others have called for warning labels,
Assistant Treasury Secretary Richard Davis said labels may be premature because the problem 1s not fully understood. 
''Scientific evidence establish­es clearly that the offspring of women who drink heavily during pregnancy could suffer mental and ehysical defects known as the fetal alcohol syndrome," Davis said. 
But he added that scientists disagree on the effects of more moderate drinking or binge drinking. And Davis said no one has determined a safe level of drinking, if such a level exists. 
"And we think there is a value, in this era where people are tired of being told what to do by the government, in a voluntary ef­fort." he said.

Struggle of a People 
Editor's note: This is the second half of the Third World CADENA column on the migrant farmer wo,rkers' struggles. 
The current farmworkers' orgamzing movement in northwestern Ohio is unique because it is working to bring together the three major parties in the industry to negotiate contracts. The demand on the part of the farmworkers for a three-way contract system between farmworkers, growers, and the canneries, if successful, could revolution­ize the attitudes towards farmworkers that prevail today. 
The probl~m. according to Baldemar Velasquez, President of the Farm Labor Organizing Commit­tee (FLOC) that is working with the farmworkers in Ohio, is that, "The canner has the grower under his thumb and the grower has the workers under his thumb.'' He adds, ''We want to change that relationship.'' Under the present system, the cannery companies contract with individual growers before the growing season begins--and when the farmworkers are still in their home states in the south--to pay so much per ton of tomatoes. By the time the migrants arrive, the price the grower can pay the farmworker has already been determined. It is this aspect of the system that the farmworkers and FLOC seek to change. 
Efforts to change the system so far have been unsuccessful. Last summer FLOC mailed letters to 442 Ohio growers and 55 canneries inviting them to meet at a joint negotiating session [n]uly with the farmworkers to discuss contracts. Only 16 growers attend~d and there was no respons~ at all from the cannenes. 
Last summer's walkout and strike did not have extensive planning, but it was at least in part successful. The Lbby's company in Ohio has sued the farmworkers and FLOC for $1,075,000 in damages incurred when pickets blocked the cannery's gates at a plant in Leipsic. Lbby's estimated the plant lost $75,000 in production costs and added $1,000,000 for punitive d~es. So far no action has been taken in the suit. 1his summer, with the organizing effort behind them farm­workers hope to shut down some canneries with their strike. 
The farmworkers have learned that if they strike only against the grower for a pay raise, they win no long term gains. This was demonstrated in 1968 when farmworkers represented by FLOC went on strike and won 22 contracts. The ca1:ch was that the following year they lost eleven of those contracts 
few people who really think it's worthwhile." 
Otherwise, farmworkers who are most directly 
affected by a labor stoppage are hesitant to strike. 
The FLOC's strategy m helping the farmworkers is to trair · · workers at the FLOC headquarters in Toledo to organize themselves in their homestates in the south. One such training session took place two weeks ago when 62 striking farmworkers from Texas, Florida, and Mexico met with FLOC and United Farm Workers leaders from California to discuss organizing methods. The farmworkers' union in Ohio, when its membership has solidified, will be directed by an all farmworkers. governing board. Eventually union dues will be able to maintain a permanent staff but money will always be tight. In the meantime the permanent staff at FLOC helps to keep the movement alive. In the off-season when the farmworkers are all in the south, FLOC is working to get the canneries and their local unions involved in the strike and boycott. 
According to one farmworker who attended the training session, the organizers' purpose is to persua.de people not to come north if they can afford.Jt, but to tell them, "Ifyou're ~oing to come, make It somewhere else. Not Ohio.' The leaders ~e con~erne~ that their own people might cross ptcket lines if growers offer high wages in an attempt to break the strike. But as one farmworker sai~, "If they (other migrants) aren't going to strike, the only way they can help is to go somewhere else. 
''Somewhere else includes parts of northern Indiana and southern Michigan where the tomato is a prime crop. Although the strike does not now include these areas, the Libby's cannery located in Kokomo, Indiana will be the focus of the strike and boycott effort organized by FLOC support commit­tees. 
The FLOC's efforts to deal with the canneries have encountered many obstacles. According to Ricardo Parra, director of the Midwest Council of La Raza and a supporter' of the farmworker movement, the major problem is how to get a grip on the corporations involved. The boycott is one way, but the list of products to boycott provides a clue as to just how impossible a job it is to carry out a truly successful boycott. "We have la\vs against monopoly," he notes, "yet monopoly is bigger than ever." 
Successes in other states such as California and 
when growers decided to _Plant crop~ ~ as corn. .......Wisconsin have blazed the trail for other victories 
wheat, and soybeans which are machine harvest-
able instead of tomatoes. 
The farmworkers and FLOC realize that the 
grower is caught in a bind as well as the 
farmworker. Efforts have been made to persuade 
the growers to join thefarm workers in their struggle, 
but there are many obstacles to overcome. One of 
those obstacles is racism. The large majority of 
farmwor~ers that come to pick tomatoes in the 
Midwest are Hispanic and Spanish speaking and 
prejudice plays a part in their plight. 
. J\nother problem is that the grower, even when wtllmg to cooperate, cannot keep up with inflation and the pressure from the canneries to mechanize and thereby avoid ''labor problems.'' But machine harvested tomatoes cannot be easily made into r,roducts such as tomato juice. A process called 
'e~aporation". is currently being developed by whtch th~ fleshier tomatoes of the variety that can be machine harvest can be converted into juice. Mechanization also demands that a variety of tomato that ripens uniformly be planted: the v~i~ty planted by most Ohio growers needs three ptckings by hand to get the entire crop harvested. ~echanization is also just another costly alterna­uve for the ~rower .. The farworkers do not oppose ~chanizauon as long as it does not involve the displacement of workers, but that is unlikely. 
Organizing a transient farworker population is difficult. The workers who come to any given area differ greatly from year to year. According to one in the farmworkers' movement. The ftrst step is to organize the workers themselves, then to put prc;ssure on the growers and canneries through strikes and boycotts. But to be success~!, the movement nee~s ~he support and backing of coun.dess orgaruzattons, groups, and the general public. The.farmworkers the!Dse~ves ~e confidant and determmed that they wtll wm this one. ~e success o~ the boycott and the events of this

Winter Wonderland 
Any land is a wonder land, but some lands are 'wonder-er' than others. A Winterland is a 'wonder-er' land by far--so I have come to think. Of course, I may change my mind when Spring comes--but that is my prerogative. Right now I am all taken up by Winter--by Winter Wonderland, South Bend/Notre Dame, Indiana. · 
It started--this feeling, I mean, this passion--with the w~ that· I _have started out with these Wmter morrungs, to wit from the door of my apartmentbuildi~g at W~ Washington & William, in South Bend, to the entrance to the Albert Pick Motor Inn, one sood long block and a half away. The stdewalk is snow-bound--oh, maybe not piled high and deep, but certain!y piled--so I take the road, the left-stde of the road, walking against the: cars (I couldn't "':'a!k with the cars even ifI wanted to--for 1t ts a one-way s~eet). The light falling on the snow--on the snow on the ground, or on the snow in the falling snoWflakes--is like no other light that I ever did see. It thnces--it lights up the whole world for me and makes of it a festive play­gro~md. It definitely starts my day. 
I do not give much thought to the cars--except that they too are going their snowy way, but without consciousness. How lucky I am--how lucky Every~ru~:n is--to be able to know! How lucky one ts to know even a sin~le snowflake! 
I really do not gtve much thought to anything at all. But often enough two ] acques Maritain thol;lghts do c~me to mind (it's pretty early m the morrung for ] acques Maritain thoug~ts:-any time will do for a ] acques Marttam thought, but some times do. bc.:tter than oth~;s>.

It is dispensed from its usual labor it does not have to disengage an intelligible from the matter i~ w~ch it is buried. in order to go over tts different attribu~es step by step; like a stag at ~e gushing spring, u~telli~ence has no.thing to do but drink; lt drinks the clartty of being.

I open the door of the Albert Pick Motor Inn rather timidly--or gingerly (whichever . you prefer)--certainly gropingly and haltingly. It's because me hands are cold (oh, are my hands ever cold! But I like the sensation ofcold ... ) . I pause in the vestibule (I guess y~JU would call it a vestibule), and what wtth all the glass around me--glaass every which way I look--and with a flower or two or three behind the drape behind the glass that looks down over. the bar~-ID1:d with the snow and the snowmg outstde-.-1 sing, slowly and softly, Louts MacNiece's poem Snow:

Well, now I am ready for ~y 
substantial (and I do mean substantial) 
breakfast. The Coffee Shop on the lower 
floor of the Inn is the setting or 
locus,--and the ambiance is inaeed 
pleasant. There is very much of a 
Winter atmosphere here, too. Either 
some guests are noting aloud the las1t~t

vocal--are procl~g: "I'm mo':ing to

Florida--1 just couldn't do without my 
four seasons. So, I partake heartily of 
my breakfast--and I meditate, among 
other things, on the fact that I am storing

think, for her--two things: 1) "Have a

"God bless you." What more could you 
want?· What more do I want? 
I walk slowly--and without 'jay­

'kitty-comer' from ~e l~n. Two ~ery

been :made from the tufts of the tails of a 
hutch of Peter Rabbits. I call him 'Mr.

not callirig him ''Bob'' , or ''Bob

I wait patiently at the door ofthe Notre

I am not nearly so ·~ no, you g? f1CSt please' --or so admirmg-when 1t . com~s to the men--but I can usually manage a C-here;. after all, many of these men whom 'it comes to' have just arrived at the portal of the bus after a long walk through Winter Wonderlar;td-­and you know very· well (or you certrunly should if you have · been paying attention) that I have just arrived there right on the spot and right on the dot after my brief--if slow--walk from the 
'comfy-coziness' of the Inn. 
I put my 30 cents in the fare b?x (where else would you want me to put tt? --on the floor?), and I walk to the back of the bus ('the ftrst shall be last and the last ftrst') and take me seat at the left (as I face the back--I want to be very accurate about this, and not leave you in

turns onto Notre Dame Avenue from 
South Bend Avenue. All Heaven breaks

look from way back at the good long road 
to a good ong way into Notre Dame. 
Before moving, I often (especially on 'Winter Wonderland' days--I should do it every day, but sometimes I forget) thank God and my lucky stars that I long ago decided to 'take the bus and _leave the driving to us', and to have nothing at all .to do with cars except to collect dividends every three months from a few piddling automobile stocks that I bought many years ago in a moment of weakness (weakness of my self-not of the stock) and that I can't bring my 'Milquetoastia~· ~elf to d~spossess myself of (is this of danghng?) lest someone accuse me of not being interested in 'what's good for the country'. I also manage to glimpe often 'Winter Wonderland, The Mall, South Bend, Indiana' -:which through that left. (when l--or you--or anyone--or Everyman--is facing the back) rear window has all the appearances of being a sui genens Winter Wonderland, but which I never really get to 'check out'--since I never get to the Mall (no time for Penney's or Robertson's), so . much do I keep my 'nose to the grindstone' (it says here); and I alsp manage to imagine the 'anti-freeze' signs that must dot the banks and shoulders of our route, and that even when they are only images evoke in me the response: ''Bah Get away _with you! Don't you know that I am m a very 'anti-freeze' mood!" But I would never think of imposins my views on others. I am very extstenttal. I know that if you're going to have cars, you're going to have anti-freeze. They. go together-­somewhat like a horse and carriage, if not like love and marriage. 
I would like to change the name of Notre Dame Avenue for about eight months of the year (I include October and May--as the 'Little Prince' would say, "One never knows"). I woul? 1~~ to call it "Notre Dame des Netges · ("Our Lady of the Snows") or "Chemin de las Cote des Neiges" ("Road of the Upward Slope of the Snows'' --1 translate it very literally for you; moreover, I am going to need this word 'slope' ('hill' won't do) later, very shortly indeed). Now, I really can't call it both--oh, I could, but it would confuse you, or at least it would confuse the po~ice (I guess they would have to be genilarmes). So, I· opt for the ~econ~--let_me spe_ll it ou~ and pronounce lt agrun (smcelt ts !DY very most favorite name for a Wmterland street'--! hope Our Lady won't mind), · 
Chemin de Ia Cote des Neiges (I 
discovered it in Montreal--you take the Metro from station Berri de Montigny to station Guy, ·exit (verb--dynamic verb; don't mope along), walk one block left, cross the street, tum right and walk 3/4 of a block and wait patiently in front of a tailor shop for Bus 165--which will slowly take you up this long and beautiful slope). 
Anyway--these Winterland months--I am stnick to the quick of my spirit (or better, as Maritain would say, of 'intelligentiated sense') by the 'white

slopes of Notre Dame Avenue' (come 
now, dear reader, you can adjust to 
this--remember the 'white cliffs of 
Dover'). These 'white slopes' are all 
that the off-campus students' cars are or 
have become overnight (some philoso­
phers will say that it is only an accidental 
change--but I· would certainly dispute 
that, or at least I would wonder about 
that). And these 'white slopes' are 
mostly all 'upward' (or more abruptly 
'upward' than they would otherwise 
be--if you will only please be patient and 
see what I am contrasting them with), for 
most of the cars are facing away from 
Notre Dame and in seeing them (or what 
was them) you see their (or what was 
their) hood and windshield and roof and 
hood-windshield-roof gives you an 
upward slope .(if you have eyes to 
see)--certainly mush more of an upward 
slope than back window (at least most of 
the back windows that I have seen lately) 
and roof give you. So, I am not really 
imaging things when I want to change 
the name of Notre Dame Avenue to 
"Road of the Upward Slope of the 
Snows". You had much better call me 
an 'engineer' than an 'imagineer'. 
Now, I have something else--and 
something better--to do with ''Notre 
Dame des Neiges" than to I?in it on 
Notre DameAvenue (maybe this is what 
I get for being perfectly objectzve in 
opting for Chemin cfe /at Cote .de! 
Netges--and not lettmg an extnnszc 
factor like 'Our Lady would like it' 
determine me to ''Notre Dame des 
Neiges''). I can pin it on Our Lady 
herself--on Our Lady of the Dome, or, 
even better, on her University itself, on 
the University of Notre Dame du Lac 
itself. I can do this despite two 
formidable obstacles. First formidable 
obstacle: Father Sorin himself. Remem­
ber he is supposed to have said to his 
confreres: ' 'Let's stop here until the rain 
stops.'' He may be very adamant about 
keeping the name ''Notre Dame du 
Lac''. But I think that Father will finally 
acquiesce. For one thing, he knows 
now--ifhe didn't know then (he _probably 
dtd--Father Sonn knew a lot oj things)-­
that water and snow are really a same nature under two different states--and this same nature may today prefer (for some .reason that God only--and p<!rhaps a few scientists--know) the state of snow to. the state of water--at least in this ' State. For another, I think that 'Our Lady would like it' may cut more ice with Father Sorin than it did with me.· Yes, I think that the obstacle that was Father Sorin has been removef/. 
But--second formidable obstacle--how am I going i:o get up on the Dome to do my pinning--and my emblazoning (when it comes to the University itself, it will have to be emblazomng--how else am I really going to effect my change of name for the University, when you consider that the name ''Notre Dame duLac'' has on countless occasion· been piped into practically every T.V. den and. T.V. living room and T.V. bedroom m the country?)? Answer: I am not. But I am going to get around this obstacle. I am not going up on that there Dome myself--espectally when it's all so snowy and slippery. No, I am going to appeal to some of the alumni (I do not say that they are legion) who have been up there or very close to up there, and who would surely pool thetr 'know-how' and do my clean work for me. Yes, hurrah for the alumni--or at least, for these alumni. would chant the old fight song (simply making it plural): "They're men, they're men, they're Notre Dame men"--only the giils that are here now would run me out of here now, 
Enjoy--dear reader--our Winter Wonderlands. But I hear you asking: What about the Big Snow--the Big Blizzard--ofJan. 25-29, 1978? How can you call that a 'Wonderland'? Well, it's a wonder we survived it,--isn't it? That alone would do--it would at least get us in 'under the wire of Wonder'. But that doesn·· t have to do alone. There were other thtngs about it--wonderful other thing$. Write you own 'little essay' about them.

Letters to a Lonely God 


·counter Clockwise 
There is an honesty on the face of a 
clock that is simply hateful. I can't deal 
with an honesty that is so smug and 
uncompromising; an honesty that 
doesn't know how to cheat, and refuses 
to comfort you with a harmless little lie, 
when all you're asking for is time to be 
merciful. I want to smash the faces of 
clocks, and burn calendars, because they 
are the enemy. Constantly,.! am being 
defeated by dates, and saddened by the 
loss of moments I had relied on to linger. 
Though I would cling to them out of 
deepest need, the day slips away, the 
evening ends, moved on by the insis­
tence of a clock that can be neither 
compassionate or pitying. Time is 
spoiled, like a selfish child, by always 
needing to have its own way: insisting 
that it be ten o'clock when I need it to be 
only quarter ofeight; stubbornly keeping 
to the scheduling of yesterday when, for 
over a week now, I have longed for it to 
be today. 
Yet, on campus more than in most places, there IS a kind of timelessness that maintains itself among the flow of days and seasons. On campus, there are always Freshmen asking the questions that Freshmen ask. There are always graduating Seniors worrying about themselves, trying to find an identity that will suit them for a lifetime. There are Sophomores and Juniors here, as there were Sophomores and Juniors here ten years ago, involved in the same· discussions, longing for freedom, anxious to get beyond the irksomeness of rules, not yet aware that life is a game played by somebody's rules, with the somebody never being yourself. 

At Mass, I look at faces, styles, and haircuts. I think: ''I know you all, because I have seen you before. . .last year, or in '73, or in '68. Or, if I have not seen you, I have seen your brothers and sisters. The resemblances between you are so great, I can hardly tell the difference. '' 
In a world where the students never seem to change, and I can scarcely feel the changes in myself, where is the evidence of the onward rush of time? It is not to be found in the appearances of students whom I encounter year after year in groups of nineteen and twenty year olds, because on campus, the scene belongs perenially to the young. Rather it is looking into the faces of Old Grads, back for a visit, that I realize eighteen has turned into twenty eight, and that there is a sadness in the loss of the sweetness of youth. 
Clocks may hurry me more quickly than I want to go, but I wouldn't choose to be young again, mostly because I no longer need to be young. I wouldn't have the courage to live through the self-doubts, the disappointments, the fears and hurts of bemg nineteen, not even for tjle experience of young love, feshly found. But the dirty trick of time is that it leaves you feeling shabby, as though none of the songs were being sung for you; none of the dances were being played for you; none of the poems describe your emotions in the daisy patch; and as though the only use you, at your age, could make of April, was to fertilize the tulips. 
The Old Grad, coming back, brings you sometimes--though he never even mentions it--the pain of no longer being 
Father Robert Griffin 
young. He feels age inside of him like the loss of innocence. His hope . incoming back to campus is to fmd the lost dream, the tarrushed ideals, the squandered graces, the re-birth into innocence. His need, in talking to you, is for an absolution that'will]ardon him for the ways life has change him. 
Yet, none of us were ever innocent for very long; in truth, for most of us, innocence scarcely last through puberty. We hate oUrselves for the mistakes we've made, but it would be equally tiring to be always right. The absolu­tions we need are the absolutions we give ourselves; all other mercy is so 
. plentiful in our lives, we would have a problem e~capin_g from it. 
Clocks have faces, and people have faces; both kinds of faces tell the stories of time. Heaven, being eternal, needs no clocks. Heaven, I guess, will be a' lot like a campus where the faces are always young. Yet I love to read the stories that faces tell. Even at the price of being a slave to clocks, I bless all the years that have ticked away on clocks since the wonderful birthday when I was nineteen.

A capacity audience of 2100 is assured and the table reserva­tions will be given out on a first-come, ftrst-serve basis. Those who fail to make these reservations will be seated ran­domly. If there are any ques­tions, students should call Jeff Schloemer (1149), Anne Tafluto (7936), Oare Stack (7864), or tom McGrath (8981).

Defendant seeks new trial locale 
ROCK SPRINGS, WYO. [AP]­The city's former top law enforce­ment officer will ask that his trial on charges of murdering an undercover policeman be held outside this mining boom town. 
The slain undercover police­man was investigating alleged vice and corruption here. 
Ed Cantrell, 51, the city's former public safety director, was bound over for trial Wednesday after pleading innocent to the first-degree murder charges. 
The undercover policeman, 
Michael Rosa, died last July 15, 
two days before he was to testify 
in Cheyenne before a state gr~d 
jury investi~ating repons of vtce 
and corrupuon in Rock Springs, a 
city of about 18,000 people 180 
miles east of Salt Lake City. 
Cantrell pleaded innocent be­fore Sweetware County District Judge Kenneth Hamm. Earlier, after a 15-day preliminary hear­ing Justice of the Peace Nena Stafford James ruled that Can­trell should be tried. 
Hamm gave both sides until 
April 15 to file motions. 
Cantrell's defense attorney, 
Gerald Spence, argued that Can­
trell should be freed or stand trial 
on a lesser charge of man­
slaughter. During the pre­
liminary hearing, defense attor­
neys claimed Cantrell shot Rosa, 
29, inself-defense .. 
Several witttesses testified 
Cantrell was one of the best shots 
in Wyoming. 
Spence said yesterday he 
would seek to change to place of 
the trial from Rock Springs 
"Because my client is entitled to 
have as fair a trial as possible, 
but I doubt he could have a fair 
trial anywhere. " · 
Spence described Cantrell as 
''a man who had been respected 
and loved. A man whose 
enemies respected him, who 
always tried to do right and act 
correctly'' 
But "a rubber stamp has been 
placed on his head as a first-de­
gree murderer," said Spence. 
Spence ch<.......:t~rized Rosa as a 
womaruzer who 1d problems 
working with his tellow officers. 
The state grand jury before 
which Rosa was to testify ended 
its year-long term last November. 
It did not issue an indictments 
related to political corruption or 
vice in Rock Springs.

Carter to rely on taxcuts to stimulate economy 
WASJDNGFON (API-Treasury Secretary Michae Blumenthal said me Caner administration intends to rely in the future on income-tax cuts, rather than higher spending, to stimulate me economy. 
Although it would be danger­us to reduce taxes in 1980, he told me Senate Budget Committee, the economy may require a tax cut in 1981. Blumenthal con­
ceded me necessity of such a reduction would further delay President Caner's goal of balan­
cin~ the budget.
' We can't have tax cuts until inflation is under control," he said. If economic growth next year falls significantly short of currenrexpecrations, Blumenthal added, the Caner administration 
would take a careful look at the feasibility of tax cuts. 
''Farther ahead, it is clear that 
the combination of restrained ~rowth ofoutlays (Federal spend-mg) and a progressive tax struc­
both possible and desirable," he said. 
In the rect"nt past, Congress has used a mixture of tax cuts and spending increases,such .as 
. public works and job creations, to fight recession. In the future, Blumeniruil said, ''This adminis­tration is determined to restrain the growth of federal expendi­tures and to rely principally on the private sector as the source of economic growth." 
The Treasury secretary also said that if Congress approves Caner's plan for sli~ht reduc­tions in some specJaJ Social Security benefits and enacts le­gislation to control hospital costs, 
a  reduction  in  Social  Security  
t~~"staning in  1981  may  be  
considered.  

He said less government borrowing will be necessary in 1979 and considerably less in 1980. If that forecast proves true, it could mean lower interest rates as home-builders and business feel less competition from the government for available credit. 
Meanwhile, the House Ways and Means Committee failed to muster a quorum and had to delay consideration of Carter's request for ~ additional $98 billion in borrowing authority through Sept. 30, 1980. The current debt limit of $798 billion is expected to fall short of the actual debt in about a month. · Unless a higher limit is set by that time, the government will be unable to borrow to_pay its bills.

ND :s Fencers ~efeared four teams in last weeks opener to up thezr consecutive wzns to 89. Defending NCAA champ Mike Sullivan was 8-0. ' 
SMC swimmers ·split dual meet 
by Debbie Dahrling Women Sports Editor 
Participating in their second dual meet of the season, in Holland, MI, the Saint Mary's swim team again split the meet with a sound defeat over Adrian College 92-31, and a loss to Hope College, 75-55. 
With the dual efforts of Maria Spicuzza and Ellen Crowe, the Belles had little trouble against Adrian. Both swimmers finished ftrst in three events to put SMC in a comfortable position. Spi­cuzza was first in the 50-yard breaskstroke, the 200-yard free­style, and the 100-yard breast­stroke events. Crowe swam smoothly to first place in the 50-yard backstroke, the 200-yard 
I.M. (individual medley), and the 100-yard butterfly. 
Team captain Kathy Haggerty added two more first-place points to the team score in the 500-yard freestyle and the 50-yard butter­fly.

year, lines up at his .forward position. Kiki Vandeweghe has shown a lot of improvement at the other forward slot. Gig Sims will start at center and share time with Darrell Allums and ] ames Wilkes. 
While Phelps' boasts a seem­ingly inexhaustible supply of talent, Gary Cunningham puts all his eggs rn a basket held by Greenwood, Hamilton, Holland and Vandeweghe. Greenwood is the top scorer and reboun~er averagmg 17.8 ppg, but only four points per game seperate the next three names. However, the quality of play drops off notice­ably thereafter as Wilkes' 5. 7 ppg is fifth highest on the 16-3 UCLA team. 
Besides losing their fourth game of the year to Notre Dame, the Los Angeleans have been edged by Stanford and Arizona by three and one points respect­ively. Both defeats came on the road. 
The Bruins have bounced back 
Carrie Meyer added ~ few 
finishing touches of her own as 
she finished in first place in the 
50-yard breaskstroke and the 
50-yard freestlye events. 
Meyer, along with Crowe and 
Peggy O'Brien, is working to 
qualify for regionals in March. 
Meyer missed qualifying for the 
50-yard freestyle event by .01 in 
the meet Wednesday night. 
According to coach ] ane Lam-· 
mers, "We're hoping that Carrie 
will soon have a qualifying time 
and three Saint Mary's swim­
mers will be going to regionals.'' 
In the second meet, Hope 
College swam past the Belles by 
20 points, but SMC never gave 
up. "We had second-place 
finished in almost every event to 
rack up the points," Lammers 
said, "but they (Hope ColleEe) 
just kept on coming in ftrst 
place." 

The Belles were strong in the . 50-yard and the 100-yard back­stroke with Crowe and Kathy 
in their last five games, winning all convincingly. V andeweghe and Holland have possessed the golden tough during the winning streak. A hot hand is nothing new for Holland who leads the team in field goal per cent with a .643 average. Hollands 10-13 ·· field goal performance against ND earlier in the year kept his team in the game. 
Vandeweghe, who scored only six points in that ftrst meeting, has averaged 18 ppg. over the last ftve games thanks to a better than 70 per cent accuracy rate from the floor during that hiatus. 
Notre Dame, at 17-2, has also won its last five outings. The 
. Irish have showedsymptomsof a team under great pressure emenating from their lofty num­ber one national ranking. Never­theless, Phelps' protege's have managed to roll up enough points to win against tough competition. 
Tipoff for the nationally tele­vised contest is set for 1 p.m. EST.

Guest Bruins seek revenge, Irish look for series sweep 
by Ray 0 'Brien Sports Editor 

Sunday will be a special day at the University of Notre Dame. It can be considered a holiday, right up there with Christmas, Easter, and Halloween. The outsider might say this is an exaggeration but to the members of the Notre Dame community, there is some­thing holy about this event. 
While a home USC football game comes but once every two years; the UCLA-ND clash at the ACC is an annual treat. This is the twenty-third time these two schools have met. But the aura that surrounds this series really was born in the ven place the action will take place this Sunday. 
Notre Dame's 71-70 stunner Bill Hanzlik 's defensive peiformance against UCLA 's Brad over the Bruins in 1971 stopped Holland will be one ofthe keys in Sunday's clash. an 88-game win streak that will 
Keep your eyes on the Ha:nz 
Put down the books and put on your stomping shoes. It's time to hitch up your pants and show another team who they're dealing with. Oh yea, this team happens to be from Los Angeles and has three players named Greenwood, Hamilton and Holland. They wear numbers 34,24 and 14 and are the ones hittmg only the net on their pregame practice shots. 
Don't bother to yell at those three players because they won't hear you. Oh, they'll hear the noise but the nervous, stumbling reacion usually following this racket will not be present. But don't don't stop yelling because the other guys in blue and gold uniforms are beginning to look around and some are inadvertently biting their fingernails. 
There is just no telling what will happen in a game between Notre Dame and UCLA. But the one thing you can bet on is that there will be a great deal ofexcitement, neither team will get blown out, and Greenwood, Hamilton and Holland will get their share ofpoints. How much of a share may be crucial, but it ts pretty safe to say that double digits will follow their names in the boxscore. 
Digger Phelps keeps saying that you have to assume Greenwood will get his 30 points. On December 9th, he only got 14. What Phelps' means is that Greenwood could score 30 points and the Irish could still win. This concensus All-American cannot be ignored but the key to beating UCLA is pressuring the guards, namely Hamilton and Holland. 
Hamilton was cold in the first meeting, so I 
suppose you can expect him to have a good game 
based on the law of averages. Holland single­
handedly kept the Bruins in the game earlier in the

O'Brien 

year hitting 18 footers like only Tracy Jackson, Clay 
Mathews and a handful ofother players know how. 
Holland's hot hand was no fluke, as he has gone on 
to connect on over 64 per cent of his field goal 
attemr.ts, a head shaking statistic for a guard. ~ 
While Hamilton can go without shooting and 
UCLA will win, I don't think the same is true for 
Holland. Hamilton handles the ball at all times and 
almost every play originates with a pass from him. 
He is the ball handler and an extraordinary passer, 
so scoring is only an added bonus. 
However, Holland is out there to shoot. He and 
Hamilton are out on the court for over 35 minutes ·per game. In that 35 minutes, Holland must score 10 double figures or his team will be in trouble (unless they are playing Northwestern's football team in a game ofpick-up). To sto.P. the Bruins, the 
Irish must stop Holland. Enter Bill Hanzlik. 
Did you see Hanzlik travel on that layup attempt 
with a half a minute to go against NC. State? Dtd 
you see Hanzlik cover ''Hawkeye'' Whitney on that 
air ball shot? Then you know that Hanzlik could 
fail to score Sunday, and Notre Dame could still 
win; as long as Holland throws up a few air balls! 
Guys like Hanzlik don't get the spot light on them 
often but that's who I'll be watching on Sunday. 
probably never be approached again. This game also marked the rebirth of Notre Dame as a national power under the mater­nal care of Digger Phelps. 
Things have changed quickly in the past eight years. Phelps' squad have been on the long end of the stick in six of the last eight contests in the confines of the ACC. In fact. the u~coming game marks the beginrung of a 180 degree turnaround. Notre Dame is now in the driver's seat as the top ranked team in the nation, while the Bruins take the role of "the Spoiler." 
''The Spoiler'' is a portrayal the Notre Dame squad knows well. While UCLA was slipping from their throne as the kings of college basketball, it was a group of players clad in green and gold that helped lead the revolution. While their has been a struggle for power ever since, Phelps' Phenoms have at least for the time being replaced the Wizards of Westwood at the top of the heap. 
Notre Dame's domination over their western rivals has perplex-

ND to face Goshen, last hurral! for Lally 
by Bill Griffin Sports Wrzter 
On Saturday, Feb. 10, Notre Dame's women's varsity basket­ball team will be play10g their last game in the friendly confines of the A.C.C.. Coach Sharon Petro and assistant cooach Bo Scott have led their team to a perfect 4-0 record at home this year, and they hope to keep their unbeaten streak alive against a solid Goshen squad. The game, however, will be significant for another reason, since it will mark the last home appearance of Notre Dame's Ms. Basketball, Carol Lally. 
Four years ago, the slender 5'6" Lally was one of many girls who had hopes of becoming a member of Notre Dame's women's basketball team. She had been a standout all-around athlete in high school, finishing third in the state of Pennsylvania in the long jump, along with being a 4-year

Regardless of who wins and ND-UCLA basketball ~arne, the fans are rarely disappotnted. The margin of victory has not exce­eded five points in the last five confrontations.

starter in basketball. 
As a freshman at a University 
known for its athletic prowess, 
however, Carol was faced with 
the challenge of proving herself 
all over agatn. Her performance 
was slightly less than remark­
able, as she earned enough 
confidence from her teammates 
to be picked as a captain for her 
sophomore season. 
The accomplishments of this 
young woman during the /ast 
four seasons have dominate the 
record books. Among her 
achievements have been the most 
points in a game, the most field 
goals in a game, the most points 
10 a season, the most field goals 
in a season, and the highest 
scoring average in a season. 
What these records do not 
reveal is that even more 
important than her ability to 
score has been her leadership 
and court savvy. Her mild­
mannered appearance off the 
court belies the intensity with 
hihhdirc e ects herself andh

w s er 
teammates while on·the court. 
In addition to her athletic 

career at Notre Dame, Carol has 
accumulated a 3.85 average in 
her rsre-medical studies, and she 
is a so an accor:Jllished artist. 
One might natur y wonder what 
such a well-rounded student-
athlete would consider to be her 
most satisfying achievement 
during her college career. 
When asked if anything in 
particular has been most 
memorable, her predictably 
unselfish rep~ was, ' 'the friends 
that I've rna e." She explains, 
''Winning games and special 
awards are fun, but they come 
and go. The friendships are the 
thin1which I value the most, and 
whic I hope will last the 
longest." 
On Saturday at 4:00 P.M., the 
women's Fi~htil Irish basket­
ball team wt I bi farewell to its 
only graduating member, three-
year captain Carol Lally. It is 
safe to assume, however, that the 
t:eputation she has earned will 
remain long after she scores 
her last basket. Says sister 
Mag~ie Lally, a 5-foot sophomore 
follo; , "She's quite the girl to 
ow." For you, or for anyone ·else, Maggie.
