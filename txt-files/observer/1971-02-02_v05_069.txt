Kennedy calls America to action 
by Don Ruane 
Black author and black woman's liberation spokes­woman Florynce Kennedy said it is time for all "good people" to move for change and worry about police armament before a half-full Library auditorium last night. 
Miss Kennedy described the "good people" as those who wear "1942 haircuts and wear skirts when they work in the library." She based her lecture on the assumption of "good people" that "sinfull people" are the sources of danger. 
She described the "sinful people" as those who run the "killing machines" and pollute the environment. Miss Kennedy, who is also a lawyer and actress, attacked the "good people" who do not find any difficulty supporting pollutters such as General Motors or backing mili­tary leaders but do find pro­blems when welfare recipients begin "wrecking the business world." 
Miss Kennedy also criticized the usc of federal appropria­tions, particularly the space program and oil rebates. She said mothers on welfare have to send 
their children to school on alter­
nate days because they only 
have one warm coat while 
airlines continue to foot the expenses of less than half-filled flights. Scoring the space pro­gram, Miss Kennedy said, "We don't seem to be particularly concerned about how this country spends its money." Stating that she has nothing against rocks, she criticized the Apollo 14 mission adding that the $400 million cost would pro­vide eriough money for a child care center in "every state of the Union." 

"The good people say a drunk should spend his money on food and clothing for his family and then spend all that money on space waste," said Miss Kennedy. 
Miss Kennedy said that blacks are continuing to arm themselves throughout the country and criticized police assistance pro­grams and the current trend of reinforcing and updating police arsenals throughout the country. "Good people" should worry about how the police are arming and not the blacks, Miss Kennedy told her audience. "ln New York the 
police take care of the need for a Ku Klux Klan." She also said police funds in the South do not go directl!' to the KKK but the materials they buy eventually are used by that organization or others similar in nature. 
In addition to police arma­ments, Miss Kennedy criticized police techniques calling the police actions of the 1968 Chicago riots "super enthus­iasm." She said the police should have been investigating the late Illinois State Treasurer Paul Po well instead of "hanging around" Grant Park.

SLC stalls soph cars, Judicial Code 
After forty-five minutes of discussion the Student Life Council voted yesterday to table consideration of Fr. Hesburgh 's letter asking the SLC to review its decision granting Sophomores parking privileges. 
Prof. William McGlinn of the Physics Department proposed that the SLC "confirm its ori­ginal motion" which extended car privileges to Sophomores as of September, 1971. He noted that everything said at the meet­ing yesterday had been said at the earlier meetings in which the Sophomore car motion was dis­cussed. 
Prof. Eugene Henry of the Electrical Engineering Depart­ment then suggested that the members of the SLC provide Fr. Hesburgh with more information about their personal opinion by voting: "Yes, No, or Indif­ferent" on the proposal. 
At this point Fr. Riehle, Dean of Students, moved to table the motion. After this motion was carried, the letter was sent back to its original committee with the instructions that the com­mittee should formulate a re­sponse to Fr. Hesburgh. 
Mr. Philip Faccenda, Vice President and general counsel s~d "The committee should an­swer the questions of the letter." He said he thought the com­mittee should also consider whether sophomores can be le­gally prevented from using their own cars and the question of scholarship students who own automobiles. 
The SLC next considered the Board of Trustees' directive re­garding the new Judicial Code. The Board agreed to accept the code pending review in March of 1972. 
SBVP Mark Winings asked the SLC to reject the letter from the trustees because of the "tone and sense of the letter." Winings objected to the passage which guaranteed the president the right to intervene when he thought it was in the interest of justice. 
Student representative Tom Schaaf thought the "explicit" delineation of the president's rights which were only "impli­cit" in the actual code was not balanced by an "explicit" state­ment of student's rights. 
Winings charged that the trus­tees "tamper with everything." He felt that the notation of the administration's right to appeal was well defined in the code it­self.

Thunder considers the report preliminary work for the study that the joint student govern­ments of Notre Dame and St. 
Mayhew Report for what they consider inadequacies in answer­ing the major question about the aspects of a possible merger agreement. The Thunder­Conway report offers a clear-cut system of changes for the social climate on the two campuses. 
Thunder admits that the pro­posal considers only one possible means of altering the social structure of Notre Dame and St. Mary's: namely, co-exchange of residents from a Notre Dame and St. Mary's dorm. The ex­change would result in the crea­tion of a hall of St. Mary's in any future merger action. Thunder claims that the effect upon St. Mary's identity would be minimal, and that resistance by alumni and alumnae would probably be less drastic than if co-ed, in other words, mixed male and female halls, were es­tablished. 
Still there are sizeable prob­lems involved in the plan that are outlined in the report. In the area of laundry and cleaning fa­cilities, the proposal suggests that that laundry "be itemized in order that women living at Notre Dame would not be re-

Iy normal, there's nothing I 
would think would cause us to

The tests on the balky latch­
ing devices included work by the 
astronauts with a flashlight and 
wrenches and a full computer 
analysis of the problem by 
experts on the ground. 
Even if the astronauts are 

unable to dock after their moon 
landing, the two moon explorers 
could walk through space 
between the lunar module and 
the command ship to reach 
safety. Hand rails were long ago 
installed on both vehicles just in 
case a lunar crew was unable to 
perform the critical docking in 
moon orbit.

Apollo 14, Stuart A. Roosa, will remain aboard the Kitty Hawk command ship in orbit around the moon while Shepard, America's first man in space, and his rookie companion explorethe Fra Mauro hills that also were the target of the ill-fated 
Apollo 13. 
It took six tries and an extra 

hard, unusual shove to finally 
get Kitty Hawk and the lunar lander, Antares, locked together late Sunday. 
The trouble popped up after a weather delayed but flawless launch from Cape Kennedy, but when it struck, it was serious enough to raise serious questions for almost 24 hours whether the spacemen would be allowed to try a landing 
Officials said the sixth and successful docking try was "nor­mal." They said perhaps a foreign body had been jamming the mechanism at first and was shaken loose during the unsuc­cessful tries. 
"If it were something like a foreign particle and the foreign particle is gone and left no trace, we'd never find out the cause of that thing if we spend the rest of the century looking for it," said McDivitt, a former astronaut. 
He added there was a practical limit to how far a cause of trouble could be chased. 
"But in no case do we really want to short cut this thing just because we're in a hurry to get something done. This mission is still as dangerous as any lunar mission we've ever flown, and we're going to take every pre­caution we can to find out what the problem is and fix it. We're going to do our very best to have the best match between what we're going to gain and what we're going to risk." 
By space age standards, the 

troublesome piece of equipmentaboard Apollo 14 _a probe-like mechanism that resembles an umbrella -is not an especially complicated one. But the probe is a vital piece in linking up the command ship Kitty Hawk with the lunar 
lander Antares, an operation the astronauts must go through be­fore -and after -a moon landing. · For some reason the capture

THE OBSERVER 
Rigor Mortis 
Forty-five minutes of discussion before a motion is tabled, forty-five 
minutes more before a letter is put into the minutes, more pontificating 
before deciding to continue with a report already being compiled. 
Ridiculous, yes. Even more so because this is a summary of what the 
Student Life Council did in its meeting yesterday. With coeducation as a 
result of the Park-Mayhew report, a topic of utmost importance on this 
campus, the SLC saw fit to discuss such explosive topics such as; Sophomore 
cars, which should've been immediately referred to committee, a letter from 
the Trustees which ennunicated the obvious and a report on parietal hours 
which was decided some time ago. 
The SLC for this year seems to have been doomed to inaction ever since 
the second meeting when forty minutes was wasted in a debate over the 
minutes. 

In some respects the failure of the SLC to come to grips with real and 
immediate issues such as coeducation, minority recruitment, and University 
priorities can be attributed to certain individuals. 
Leadership from all sectors has been lacking. Two of the three issues 
talked about yesterday were old, while the third carne about largely at the 
initiative of the Sophomore class. 
The ultimate obstruction is the system itself. Legislative bodies simply 
can; not move quickly enough. There are too many diverse viewpoints and 
very little cooperation between individuals to allow it to do so. 
The SLC could be prodded, though. If a series of strong and imaginative 
proposals were to emerge from the student sector the council might find 
itself forced into moving a bit more quickly. 
Even if this situation didn't come about at least the members would find 
themselves wading through verbiage on present matters rather than subjects 
long since frozen in rigor mortis. 
Co-ed l.lvlng 
The recently-proposed Thunder-Conway Report presents a curious contrast to the more-publicized (and more expensive) Park-Mayhew effort. It was candid where Park-Mayhew was disingenious. It was specific where Park-Mayhew was vague. And most importantly, it addressed itself to the most pressing problem that our present situation has presented l1ere: that of the stilted and contrived social life which is always a consequence of single-sex education. 
The report, which is being run in tutu on page five, is by no means complete. Thunder and Conway did not propose a reasonable solution to the problems of laundry exchange; they did not propose any solution to the problem of cafeteria service to a hundred and sixty-four added men at St. Mary's. But the report, unlike Park-Mayhew, has made some valuable and specific insights into the question of how true co-education might be irnplirnented. When they address themselves to specifics, Thunder and Conway are usually right. The number of Notre Dame men who could conveniently live at St. Mary's is approximately one hundred and sixty-four; the number of St. Mary's women who could live at Notre Dame is approximately one hundred and seventy. 
The Ob~erver, t_hen, recommends that Father Hesburg and the Board of Trustees give considerable tl:ought to the Thunder-Conway report, and that the stude_nt body, too, consider it as a viable alternative to the Park-Mayhew 
monstrosity.

Corktown is a part of Detroit near the riverfront. It was so named, 
circa 1900, because, having a heavy Irish concentration, it seemed a 
sort of distant suburb of Dublin to the rest of Detroit's populace. All 
that remains of Corktown today is it's name, the third generation

main drag. Even today "Second" is less desolate then the rest of 
Corktown, mainly because of the plethora of bars and hotels 
situated there. The bars are of two kinds; the "college" bars, helping 
to serve the metropolitan youth culture, and the sleezy bars, serving 
the local residents. The hotels are of one kind; flea bag. The sleezy 
bars compliment the hotels, and vise-versa. Both are essential to 
those who inhabit them. On Second, everything is predicated on the 
pragmatic. The alturistic is non-existent because those who are so 
inclined could not survive and maintain that quality in Second 
avenue society. 

Second and Canfield is an intersection that is representive of 
Corktown life a Ia 1971. On the southeast corner stands the Snug, a 
dumpy looking ediface from the outside, that one immediately 
recognizes as a facade as soon as he steps inside and watches the 
youth culture rocking fifty-cent pieces into the juke box, and 
shelling out two fifty a pitcher for beer. Atmosphere. Catty-corner 
from the Snug is the Blackstone Hotel which looks, and is just like 
the Ratso's and Joe's abode in "Midnight Cowboy," and since 
everyone saw the movie, the Blackstone needn't be described in any 
detail. Directly across from the Blackstone is the Bronx Bar. From 
the outside, the Bronx and the Sung look alike. But in the former 
cans the appearance isn't a facade to lure affluent curiousity seekers 
into a den of psuedo depravity. The Bronx is as sleezy from within 
(both in patronage and decorum) as it appears from without. It is 
inside the Bronx that one encounters Monahan. 
Monahan sits near the bar. Attired in rubber boots, pants worn to 
a shine, flannel shirt, and a long brown coat, he eyes you as the 
Micky Finn-type bartender fills your pitcher with draft. The 
bartender glares at Monahan, and growls something degredating at 
him, giving the distinct idea not only that Monahan is a Bronx 
"regular," but also that he is a regular nuisance to the bartender. 
Paying for your beer, you move to a mustard and beer splattered 
table at the rear of the room, between the lopsided pool table and 
the pin-ball machine. You have come to the Bronx for some cheap 
brew and some local color, and Monahan's stare doesn't even make 
an impression on you. It doesn't, that is, until he comes over and sit~· 
down, at your table, fills his glass with your beer and proceeds to tell 
you the story of his life. 

He stares at you and the two girls and the guy you are sitting with 
(who also are Christmas vacation transplants from another distant 
suburb of Dublin, ND-SMC) ''I'm fifty-nine...don't have my 
sex-drive anymore," he says, "You guys have those girls to keep you 
warm. I don't need that; ·I have this," and he pulls a pint out of a 
brown paper hag that he is carrying. You don't know what to say; 
the line between conversing, mocking, and offending is thin in this 
situation. He tells you about being disabled in WWII, and about 
working on the assern bly line at Pontiac. 
He also tells you about the various. Detroit law enforcement 
officials that he has encountered while being "hauled in when I was 
on a binge." Finally he tells you about his life at the Blackstone and 
at the Bronx. Pulling a disability check from the Army out of his 
bag, he tells you that he cannot cash it because the local parish 
priest, who is his Guardian, refuses to cosign for him. Implicitly you 
know that the priest is right, because Monahan will drink the check 
away. Monahan knows that too, but the look in his eyes reveals that 
such dependence hurts his pride. 
You listen to Monahan all evening. Tales of woe. You get up to 
leave, but before you do Monahan shows you a picture of his 
daughter, standing with her husband and three children, in front of 
their horne in Franklin, one of Detroit's more auspicious suburbs. 
She has lived there for seven years, he tells you, but he has never 
been invited over to the house. Monahan reaches into his bag once 
more and shows you the cigarette rolling machine that his daughter 
had sent him for Christmas. 

Monahan puts the picture and the cigarette roller back in his bag 
and sits down again to finish the pitcher of beer that you left. You 
and your friends flee Corktown. If you multiply Monahan by seven 
thousand, you have Corktown, that distant suburb of Dublin. For 
the most part, suburbs differ only in degrees.

Co-exchange residency proposed 
We make a simple proposal which we call co-exchange residency and should be cons-idered as off-campus hous­ing with certain qualifications. The pro­posal is this: that Stanford Hall on the Notre Dame campus be turned into a women's residency hall for St. Mary's stu­dents and, likewise, that the north wing of Regina Hall on the St. Mary's campus be made into a Men's residence hall for Notre Dame students. We believe this could be achieved by September of 1971. 
We assume that it is desirable that men and women undergraduate students live on both campuses. Co-exchange residency is not necessarily a prelude to a long range goal sucl> as coeducation on both campuses; it is a good end in and of itself. (Admittedly, however, if such a long range goal was desired, this proposal might be considered as a worthwhile step.) 
We believe this proposal to be one pos­sible method for achieving that respect which is required by life in a true Chris­tian community, and for achieving a re­jection of the Playboy philosophy. A direct result of this .proposal will be the multiplication of informal contacts be­tween the sexes. This would be primarily evident in the soci"able atmosphere of the dining halls. 
A new dimension created by this pro­posal will be the experience of living on the-other c·ampus,thereby acquiring new perspectives and diminishing the ten­dency to form false generalizations about life on the other campus. The oppor­tunity would present itself under these new conditions to permit members of both sexe.< to hold speaking privileges on the student government bodies that here­tofore have been reserved for members of the same sex. 
We use the term co-exchange residency because we view it as a program which 
goes hand-in-hand with the present co-ex­change program. Academically, it is sim­ply advantageous for students who take a 
majority of their courses at the opposite campus to live on that campus. (Exam­ples include theose in engineering, arch­itecture, science, art theatre, music, and education.) 
We consider co-exchange residency as off-campus living with some necessary re­strictions. This stance would facilitate the solving of many practical problems. The basic premise is that those living on the opposite campus will pay their tuition to the campus at which they are enrolled and p 1y their room and board to the cam­pus un which they are living. In both caies, the students would receive such privileges and bear such obligations as ac­company the above payments. 
One problem arises with the payment of room and board to Notre Dame be­cause laundry is presently included. We ask that laundry be itemized in order that women living at Notre Dame would not be required to have their laundry done by the University laundry. (To accommodate the Stanford women, washers and dryers could be transferred from Regina North to Stanford.) The itemization of laundry would make it possible for men to Regina 
Hall to purchase laundry service from 
Notre Dame. 
The general norm to be followed con­
cerning the rules and regulations of hall 
life, and of general campus residency, will 
necessarily be determined by St. Mary's 
because: 1) Notre Dame men are using St. 
Mary's facilities, and 2) St. Mary's admin­
istration restricts off-campus living. 
(Special arrangements could be worked 
out with the administrations and students 
involved due to the peculiarities of the 
situations.) Matters involving parietal 
hours, sign-outs, and cars can be discussed employing the above guidelines. 
One very real problem which would concern the majority of students is the method by which the students would be chosen to participate in the co-exchange residency program. The proposal can be implemented as described below. 
Keenan-Stanford Wlll be constdered as one entity, with residents from both halls 
having an equal opportunity to acquire beds in Keenan Hall and in Regina North. 
(The allocation of beds will be deter­mined on the basis of classes according to 
percentage.) There will be no incoming freshmen registered in Keenan, Stanford, or Regina North. (Approximately 170 in­coming Notre Dame freshmen will have to be distributed to the other Notre Dame halls.) 
Total expected returnees to Keenan-Stanford: 48l,(all numbers are approximate) Less: the number of beds in Keenan, 302; Students to be displaced: 179. 
The displacement of these 179 stu­dents will be achieved by some moving to Regina North (a maximum of 164), some, moving off-campus, and the remainder will be-distributed over the halls on cam­pus. Those students distributed through­out the campus could be allowed room picks in the halls of their choice on an equal basis with those already residing in that hall. 
It should be noted that there are 287 beds in Stanford and only 164 beds in Regina North. This means that overall Notre Dame loses 123 beds and St. Mary's gains 123 beds. To accommodate this change, St. Mary's will have to in­crease enrollment by this amount, and Notre Dame will haye to either allow more students to move off-campus or to decrease their enrollment. (Another item to be mentioned is that the St. Mary's women chosen to live in Stanford will be chosen on a class-percentage basis.) 

We trust that the people on both cam­puses will seriously consider the proposal and the concepts described in the ration­
Keenan-Stanford will be considered as one entity, with residents from both halls having an equal opportunity to acquire beds in Keenan Hall and in Regina North. (The allocation of beds will be deter­mined on the basis of classes according to percentage.) There will be no incoming freshmen registered in Keenan, Stanford, or Regina North. (Approximately 170 in­coming Notre Dame freshmen will have to be distributed to the other Notre Dame halls.)

Students to be displaced: 179 (all 
numbers are approximate) 
The displacement of these 179 stu­
dents will be achieved by some moving to 
Regina North (a miximum of 164), some 
moving off-campus, and the remainder 
will be distributed over the halls on cam­
pus. Those students distributed through­
out the campus could be allowed room 
picks in the halls of their choice on an 
equal basis with those already residing in 
that hall. 
It should be noted that there are 287 
beds in Stanford and only 164 beds in 
Regina North. This means that overall 
Notre Dame loses 123 beds and St.

this change, St. Mary's will have to in­

Notre Dame will have to either allow

Dr. Charles Hurst Jr. 
Dr. Charles G. Hurst Jr. is the President of Malcolm X Community College in the Chicago ghetto. That the name of the col~ lege is Malcolm X and the fact that the college is a community college is a testa­ment to Dr. Hurst's belief in education and belief that the black ghetto youth must be educated and educated in a way that is relevant for him and for the black community. 
When Dr. Hurst left a deanship at Howard University in 1969 to come to the then Crane Jr. College, he found a college that had a very poor physical plant, excessive teacher salaries, preju­diced teachers, very few books, and frus­trated students. The change in name was only the first step in an educational revo­lution. He improved the physical plant and far more importantly he changed the thinking behind Malcolm X Community College. 
Curriculum innovations were under­taken on the belief that a black commun­ity college in a ghetto should meet the political, social, and economic needs as well as the educational needs of the people. New courses in job-training, learn­ing skills center in which intensive tutor­ing replaces remedial courses, learning unit courses on "urban survival", short term courses for prisoners in the Cook County Jail, and black music workshops, are evidence of this shift in thinking. 
The teachers ·have also been, of course, very much affected by the changes at the college. Before the teachers were 80% white, many of whom were convinced of black inferiority. Now the ratio is 50-50. Before there were semi-retired teachers who were receiving full pay. Now full time salaries for part-time teachers have been eliminated. Many of the new black teachers are lacking the usual academic credentials but they speak the language of the student and this is in keeping with the intent of the college. Also, Hurst has charged them with the responsibility for insuring student success instead of pre­siding over their failure. 

The students themselves have changed. Before they were frustrated and con­· 
fused. Many had taken five years to get out of a two year college -and educa­tional opportunity is only slightly avail­able to many blacks. Now the teachers care about them, the classes are relevant and dedicated to helping the black com­munity, and an entire new spirit has per­meated the institution. No one is failed but no one has a free ride. The school wants the student to come to class and if not, he is retired and help is given to make the student want to finish. 
There has been much opposition to the college from white people who fear that Hurst's new programs are creating a black power training ground. This has primarily resulted from the school's· close contact with the Black Panthers. The school answers that this comes from its dedica­tion to build an educational system need­ed to solve the problems of black people. So far, the black community, both mili­tant and conservative, have backed Dr. Hurst. 
Dr. Hurst's own background -he sees himself as an "accident" that he was one of a few lucky blacks that the whites let screen through the wire mesh -created his determination to ef;lucate those who the whites have felt were uneducatable. Malcolm S is the realization of this deter­mination to increase the chances of others to escape through the wire mesh. 
He might also get his determination from his family. His cousin is Sugar Ray Robinson.

Current Campus Agenda 

WITH MAX SHULMAN 
(By lhe author of Rally Round the Flag, Boys ... DobitGilhs ... etc.) 
Down Memory Lane Without a Paddle 
Memory can best be described as that function of the brain which deserts you during an exam. Today, therefore, let us take up mnemon­ics, or little tricks to aid the memory. 
As you know of course, mnemonics is named after Mnemon, the hero of possibly the loveliest of all the Greek myths. It tells how the Athenian youth Mnemon fell in love with the wood nymph Ariadne, and she with him. Indeed, so oblivious were these two to everything except each other, that one year they forgot to attend the festival of Demeter, the goddess of bran. Well sir, naturally Demeter got pretty wroth, and to make sure the lovers would never forget again, she changed Ariadne into a finger and Mnemon into a piece of string. 
A lovely myth, as you can see, and as you know of course, it's been the inspiration for dozens of richly romantic books, plays and operas, including La Traviata, Deerslayer and The Joys of Yiddish. 
But I digress. Mnemonics, I say, are little tricks to aid the mem­ory. For example, here's how I learned my Zip Code-72846. I broke it into two smaller groups of digits, each with a special meaning. Like this: 72-846. 
See how easy it is now? The first group of digits, 72, is, as you know of course, the number of days in the gestation cycle of the larger marsupials, like the oryx, the bushy lemur and the Toyota. And the second group, 846, you will instantly recognize of course as Dick Tracy's badge number. 

But some people say that mnemonics, useful though they may 
be, will soon be replaced by a far better memory aid. In fact, say they, 
we are on the verge of a fantastic new breakthrough. Recent experi­
ments have definitely proved that memory is carried in the brain cells 
by the sub-molecule called RNA. Therefore, say they, as soon as sci­
ence learns how to synthesize RNA, all we'll have to do is swallow a 
teaspoon of it and-presto!-instant memory. 
(Incidentally, if you're wondering what the initials RNA stand for, I forgot. I do recall, however, what DNA stands for. When the eminent biochemist Alfred J. Sigafoos was isolating DNA back in 1960, he carried on experiments of such incredible delicacy you can scarcely believe it. Why, do you know that he was actually dissecting tissues only a trillionth of an inch thick? That's why his fellow lab workers named the stuff DNA-for "Don't Nudge Alfred.") 
But I digress. Some people, I say, believe that science will soon 
decode RNA. But others are doubtful. How can anybody decode RNA, 
they ask, when they can't even figure out the brewing formula of 
Miller High Life Beer? 

It's true, you know. Miller High Life is absolutely unique. No competitor has ever been able to duplicate it. Oh sure, they've tried. In fact, they've been trying for 115 years. And that's how long they've been failing because from the very beginning Miller's brewing formula has been a secret known to only one man on earth-Miller's chief brewmaster-and he never tells it to another soul until, on his death­bed, he whispers it into the ear of his eldest son. 
Take, for example, the current chief brewmaster at Miller High Life-Heinrich Lockjaw the Xllth. A veritable tomb is Heinrich the Xllth. Believe me, he's been offered plenty to divulge the formula. And I don't mean just money; I mean treasures far more precious­the Mona Lisa, the Elgin Marbles, Belgium, the only existing skeleton of Charlemagne as a boy, the original manuscript of The Joys of Yiddish. But Heinrich the Xllth just keeps shaking his head, determined that the secret of Miller High Life shall be his alone until, with his final breath, he whispers it into the ear of his eldest son Heinrich the Xlllth (or Gabby, as all his friends call him). 
But I digress. You want to know whether science will ever decode RNA. Well sir, I don't have the answer. But this much I can tell you: America did not become the world's foremost producer of laminated prosthetics and edible furniture by running away from a fight! 
And don't you forget it!

We, the brewers of Miller High Life and the sponsors of this column, wish to extend to you our unique and unduplicated thanks for your con­tinuing patronage. Also, Heinrich says hello. 
Alinski to talk 
Saul Alinsky, noted com­munity organizer, will speak on the role of community organiza­tion in urban areas at 8 p.m. Wednesday (Feb. 3) in the Mem­orial Library Auditorium. 
The author of "Reveille for Radicals" has helped a variety of groups organize to obtain power, from poor Irish in Back-of-the-Yards, Chicago to Indians and blacks in rural and urban settings. His talk is spon­sored by the Notre Dame-St. Mary's Academic Commission. 
Corbaci to chair CUMRC 
Leo M. Corbaci, assistant provost and registrar at the Uni­versity of Notre Dame, has been elected chairman of the steering committee of the College and University Machine Records Conference (CUMRC). The 16th annual conference will be held in Dallas, Texas on May 3-5, 1971. 
The committee's primary re­~ponsibility is to review and ap­

prove the general preparations 
and program, as well as decide 
policy for the annual confer­
ence. The committee will also 
make recommendations to its re­
lated national organization, The 
College and University Systems 
Exchange (CAUSE). 

Serving on the steering com­mittee with Corbaci are the dir­ectors of the computing centers and/or the directors of adminis­trative data processing from Michigan State, Northern Michi­gan, West Virginia, Drake, Wayne State, Ohio State, Miami, Stanford, Northern Illinois, Southern Methodist, lowas State, University of Alberta, Baylor and Wisconsin.

ND design wins award 

A University of Notre Dame 
architecture student has won 
$300 as complimentary prize in 
an international competition on 
prefabricated housing design. 
Edward Suzuki, fifth-year archi­
tecture student from Tokoyo, 
Japan, was among 206 entrants 
from 16 nations to take part in 
the contest, judged by six pro­
minent Japanese architects and 
an American designer. 

Suzuki designed basic housing components which any family could arrange to suit its own n ee9s and preferences. The system is basically pneumatic geodesic, where air-inflated plas­tic-membraned, triangular "cushions" support the dome or sphere in place of the rigid rods used in normal construction. 
The competition centered on the theme "Capsule Space as Personal Space." The contes­tants attempted to create pre-fabricated units that are pleasant to inhabit and capable of individuality, as most mass-produced houses are not. His design, as well as the designs of the other prizewinners, will appear in the next issue of "The Japan Architect."

Notre Dame runs overMiami,Ohio 
by Vic Dorr Observer Sportswriter 
Saturday was just one of those days for the Miami of Ohio indoor track team. First of all, the Miami bus got lost while enroute to the Athletic and Con­vocation Center, forcing a forty minute delay in the competition. Then, as the Miami squad began running through its warm-up drills,, it was greeted by the voice of a very young, but obviously very opinionated spectator: 
"Hey Miami, Notre Dame's gonna win!" 
But, from a Miami viewpoint, perhaps the most unfortunate happening of the day was the track meet itself. For the visitors came up against a Notre Dame team which had been well pre­pared and which, as a result, won with very little difficulty. The 83-48 score is the best indi­cation of just how "ready"

As one of the students who made the trek to Chicago Sta­dium to see the Irish do basket­ball battle with Illinois, I once again realized how bad a (and I use the term loosely) coach Johnny Dee is. Even though the officiating was rather poor, the Irish could have won the game with some timely coaching strategy, which Mr. Dee it seems has never heard of, or at least he never shows it. A man to man defense and a pass and shoot of­fense appear to be the only set -ups Johnny Dee has in his limited warehouse of strategies. Some key changes by Dee could have meant victory for the Irish in all of strategies. Some key changes by Dee could have meant victory for the Irish in all their games, with the possible exception of Marquette. With one of the most if not the most talented teams in the country, Dee should be 14-1, instead he is 10-5. I shudder when I think of what Johnny Wooden or AI or Frank McGuire could do with the Notre Dame personnel, yet Johnny Dee has somehow man­aged to lose five games and the season isn't over yet. And the odd thing about it is that Notre Dame actually hired Dee. With all the other coaches who Notre Dame could have selected, they picked Dee. It's a shame that 
some other university can't steal Dee from us with a nice lucrative offer. For it one did it would not be met with disapproval as was the case at Illinois when Jim Valek was fired before the Ohio State game but rather it would be _ met with rejolctng and merrymaking that would make An Tostallook like a funeral.

"This was aired publicly and discussed quite thoroughly when he Connally was confirmed for Secretary of the Navy back in 1961," Ziegler said. "We were and are aware of it and assume that because it is a matter of public knowledge and was dis­cussed at that time it is entirely appropriate."

of beds, Regina South could be included in the exchange, thus leaving roughly the same number of beds at both schools as before the switch. 
Thunder considers the St. Mary's administration the hardest obstacle to hurdle in finding acceptance for the plan. Due to this Thunder feels it may be necessary to negotiate the sta­tus of students involved in the exchange. At least initially, Notre Dame men living in Re­gina Hall may be subject to St. 
Mary's regulations such as sign­outs, visiting privileges, etc. It may also be necessary to treat Stanford as a St. Mary's dorm as far as rules are concerned. Thun­der feels with some certainty that the presence of men at St. Mary's would tend in the long run to pressure the administra­tion to change some of its less popular rules. Until then, some Notre Dame students may be discouraged from going to Re­gina due to the rules currently governing St. Mary's dormitory life. 
Other problems include a pos­sible postponement in room picks, and the adjustment of stu­dent government jurisdiction. For the first time there would be a woman HPC member, and an analagous member on the St. Mary's Council. According to Thunder, finances are a problem that can be overcome by Sep­tember, !971.

But Senate Democratic Lea­der Mike Mansfield said the com­mittee should investigate. "The story will make it necessary to reopen the hearings," he said. 
A spokesman said the com­mittee planned even before the Times story to talk with Connal­ly about his finances. something that is done customarily with most presidential appointees. 

WASHINGTON(UPI) -The Senate Finance Committee will question Treasury Secretary nominee John B. Connally Jr. publicly about $225,000 he re­ceived from an oil millionaire's foundation while he was Gover­nor of Texas, a committee spokesman said Monday. 
The New York Times first re­ported Monday that Connally, a Democrat and protege of former President Lyndon B. Johnson, collected the money even though the Texas Constitution 
prohil,its a governor from receiv­ing any outside "salary, reward orcompensation." 
The Times reported that a foundation spokesman said the money was delayed payment for legal work Connally had done as executor of the $105 million es­tate of Sid W. Richardson, of Fort Worth, who died in 1959. 
Presidential Press Secretary Ronald L. Ziegler said in answer to reporters' questions that the White House was "aware of that particular matter." 


posals will be offered by the stu­dent government report. The exchange may be extended to include 600 women. Flanner, Fisher, and Pangborn have been mentioned as possibilities for the Notre Dame's women dormi­tory. The experimental coeduca­tional dormitory plan in~olving Holy Cross is also being consi­dered separate from the 

Thunder-Conway plan. 
Amato elected in Stanford 
Freshman Chris Amato, was elected last Friday president of Stanford Hall for the remainder of this year. He replaces Carlos Cruz, who left at the end of the first semester due to personal reasons. 
Asked if he felt that being a freshman would present any pro­blems, Amato replied, "I can foresee a possible problem with the upperclassmen. The Seniors may not like the idea of being Jed by a freshman. However, I don't think they will really mind as long as necessary things are done quickly and efficiently." He added that this should be no problem, since he has a good 
cabinet  of  officers  who  will  
assist him.  
Amato  attributed  vigorous  

campaigning and a large fresh­man backing for the success over his opponent, who was a senior.
