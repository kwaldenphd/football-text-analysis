Resolution lauds ND's environmental efforts 
By ClAIRE REISING News Writer 
The Student Senate applauded the University's increased atten­tion to environmental issues in a unanimously passed resolution at their meeting Wednesday. 
In the past year, Notre Dame raised its grade from a D-to a C on the College Sustainability Report Card, the resolution stat­ed. 
According to the Sustainable Endowments Institute's Web site, the College Sustainability Report Card evaluates the sustainability of United States universities with the nation's top 200 endow­ments. 
The Senate's resolution listed some efforts Notre Dame took to increase campus sustainability, such as decreasing greenhouse gas emissions, serving some locally grown food products and strengthening its recycling pro­gram. 
With these initiatives, the University was one of 13 univer­sities to improve by a full letter grade on the report card. 
"I thought it was appropriate to commend them for what they've done and encourage them to do more," said Fisher senator Stephen Bant, who drafted the resolution.

As he did in 2006, Fort Wayne-South Bend Bishop John D'Arcy has condemned University President Father John Jenkins' decision to allow "The Vagina Monologues" to be performed on campus and said he hopes Jenkins rethinks his choice. 
In a six-page statement released Wednesday, D'Arcy said he "publicly and respectfully disagree[s]" with Jenkins' decision to allow the play, which will be held from March 26-28, to be per­formed on campus. 
"I am convinced that per­mitting performances of [the "Monologues"] is not consis­tent with the identity of a Catholic 
universi­ty," D'Arcy said. 
Jenkins said in a two-page statement Monday that uni­


versities, D'Arcy including Notre Dame, are responsible for openly discussing contro­versial issues and finding academic platforms for those issues and so the play could be performed on campus. D'Arcy disagreed and said permitting performance of the play was "not consistent with the identity of a Catholic university." 
" ... Because it depicts and endorses sinful sexual acts in direct opposition to Church teaching, I believe its per­formance to be pornographic and spiritually harmful," D'Arcy said. 
The Eve Ensler play, which was performed on campus for six of the past seven years, has continually gener­ated controversy at Notre Dame. Jenkins said he would allow performance of the "Monologues" after finding the student proposal to per­form the play consistent with guidelines he established in 

2006, which, among other stipulations, said the play must be discussed within a Catholic context. 
An academic panel discus­sion will follow each per­formance, and at least one panel member will discuss the play's relation to Catholic beliefs. 
D'Arcy called for the University to denounce the play. 
"Otherwise, the University appears to endorse it as in some way good and the impression is given that 
Catholic  teaching  is  one  
option  competing  among  
many," D'Arcy said.

'Live As You Are' focuses on eating disorders 
Counseling Center offers support, treatment for men and women 
By MADELINE BUCKLEY 
News Writer 
Last year, just over one in every 10 stu­dents to visit the University Counseling Center was treated for an eating disorder, but today Valerie Staples will present ways the University can lower that number. 
Staples, the coordinator for Eating Disorder Services in the Counseling Center, will speak to faculty and staff today about how they can impact the positive body image of students.

Nurse warns of physiological effects of anorexia, bulimia 
By BRIAN MCKENZIE News Writer 
Dr. Mary Rodts, an orthopedic nurse practitioner with over 30 years of experi­ence, delivered a lecture Wednesday on the effects of eating disorders on the bones and body structure as a part of the "Live As You Are" health and body image con­ference ending today at Notre Dame. 
According to a Harvard study, more than 40 percent of primary school students wanted to be thinner and most 10-year­olds had dieted, Rodts said. This weight­consciousness causes three percent of women and one percent of men to suffer from an eating disorder at some point in their lifetime.

9/11 stairs should stay 
ltecently, a staircase from the World Trade Center in New York was moved 200 feet to make way for construction of the new Freedom Tower on the site of the former twin towers. 
Stairs aren't usually such a big cause for concern, but this case is different. That staircase was 
the only above­ground remnant of the World Trade Center left stand­ing after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. It was used by many of the survivors of the attacks to 

escape the build-Jay Fitzpatrick

tragedy New York 
and the United 
States felt that day. 
The stairs were whittled away and 
removed from their concrete base in 
order to make moving them possible. 
They ruinnd what should have been a 
national landmark, just like any other 
sito. The USS Arizona still rests in the 
wators in Pearl Harbor to remind the 
world of the tragedy of that attack. 
What makes the stairs different is 
thoir location. Situated in downtown 
Manhattan. this staircase was occupy­
ing prime real estate that, according to 
the Powers That Be, needed to be filled 
as soon as possible. So by creating a 
memorial and building a symbolic 
"Freedom Tower," the event could be 
romembered b1~tter. 
Think about that. 
The 9/11 memorial group is getting 
rid of the a<:tual sitn and rebuilding an 
artificial Ground Zero nearby. They are 
destroying history to make room for 
progress. 
What is even more outrageous is the 
attempts to rationalize this decision. 
.Jon Daniels. president of the memorial 
foundation, told the Associated Press 
that, even though the stairs are being 
moved, they are maintaining "the 
essencn of the stairs." 
What a load of crap. 
Those stairs are only different from 
any other stairs in the entire world for 
one simple reason: their location. They 
stayed standing. They helped people 
escape. The only reason those stairs 
mattered is because people could look 
at them and think: "that is where it 
happened." 
I would bet that every student at 
Notre Dame could tell you exactly 
where they were and what they were 
doing when they found out about the 
attacks. It is our generation's Kennedy 
assassination. Socially and politically, it 
has been the most important event in 
the world during the first few years of 
the 21st century. And some suits in 
New York are ruining that memory just 
to make a buck. 
By moving these stairs, they are 
doing a lot more than clearing room for 
a new skyscraper. They are inherently 
tarnishing the memory and sacrifices 
of those who died in the attacks.

D'Arcy created a hypotheti­cal situation to· illustrate his concerns with allowing anti­Catholic teaching promoted in the play froin a conversation with Jenkins about Nazi liter­ature. 
He imagined the University was in Nazi Germany in 1938 and that some faculty and students were Nazi sympa­thizers. He imagined there was a national movement where schools showed films advocating Nazi propaganda. 
"Would not the showing of such a film at Notre Dame involve the University in pro­viding a platform for Nazi propaganda and entail some level of cooperation with the evil of Nazism?" D'Arcy said. 
D'Arcy released statements disagreeing with Jenkins' decision to allow. performance of the play on campus in 2006 and said he had been in con­tact with Jenkins about the decision and refuted Jenkins' arguments in his own state­ment. And in February, the 
U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops moved its conference from its planned conference at Notre Dame to a convent in Mishawaka. 
Dennis Brown, assistant vice president for News and Information, said the University would defer to Jenkins' original statement when asked about the ability to perform the play on cam­pus. 
"We think Father Jenkins' statement stands on its own 
and speaks for itself," Brown said. 
D'Arcy said Jenkins was incorrect to say that allowing the play was analogous to allowing students to read and discuss authors such as Nietzsche, Gibbon, Luther and Joyce·, whose writings D'Arcy said are contrary to Catholic teachings. 
"[Those authors] have writ­ten serious philosophical, the­ological and literary works, which have influenced Western thought," D'Arcy said. "As such, their work has academic merit and is worthy of serious discussion and cri­tique in a classroom setting ... How can one put such a play, which many consider porno­graphic, on the level of seri­ous works such as the writings of National V-Day campaign, an organization to stop violence against women that "pro­motes creative events to increase awareness, raise money and revitalize the spir­it of existing anti-violence organizations," a_ccording to its Web site. The organization was created in 1998 in response to the "Monologues" and helps organize produc­tion of the "M_onologues" around the country to raise money for anti-violence caus­es. 
D'Arcy also disagreed with showing the play because of the sins inherent to it. The depiction of sins such as female masturbation and adult-child relations, D'Arcy said, "violates standards of 
decency and 
morality."

Instituterecognized for contributions 
University earns "Blessed are the Peacemakers" award from the Catholic Theological Union 
Special to The Observer 
Notre Dame's Kroc Institute for International Peace Studies has received the 2008 "Blessed are the Peacemakers" Award from Catholic Theological Union (CTU], the largest Catholic grad­uate school of theology in North America. 
The award is offered each year to an institution or individual "whose accomplishments and commitments reflect the values of our own mission, particularly in the areas of reconciliation, jus­tice, and peacemaking," accord­ing to the award letter from CTU. 
Rev. Donald Senior, C.P., presi­dent of CTU, wrote that the board of trustees wished to "honor the Institute for the extraordinary contribution it has made in preparing graduate stu­dents and in promoting research and study on issues of peace­making. CTU feels a deep affinity with the mission and spirit of the Institute ... At a precarious time in world history, we b~lieve that honoring peacemakers is itself an important witness." 
Past award recipients include Rev. Theodore M. Hesburgh, C.S.C., president emeritus of Notre Dame; Lea Rabin, widow of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzak Rabin; Sargent and Eunice Shriver; Latin Patriarch Michel Sabbah of Jerusalem; Queen Noor of Jordan; Nobel Laureate John Hume of Northern Ireland; Cardinal Walter Kasper, head of the Vatican Office for Ecumenism; Steven Spielberg, for his establishment of the Shoah VIsual History Foundation; the One Voice Movement for Peace in Israel and Palestine; Jean Vanier, the founder of the I.:Arche CO!fllllUnity for mentally disabled adults; the Council of Religious Leaders for Metropolitan Chicago; and Sen. John Danforth, former ambassa­dor to the United Nations. 
Kroc Institute director R. Scott Appleby will accept the award on April 29 in Chicago at a dinner attended by more than 800 of Chicago's religious, civic and business leaders. 
Appleby said the Kroc Institute is "deeply honored to be recog­nized by CTU and to be in the company of so many extraordi­nary organizations and individu­als who have received this award in the past. We are also very pleased that the award shines a spotlight on the important role that academic research and edu­cation play in advancing peace worldwide and supporting the Church's efforts in peacebuild­ing."

Keenan senator Gus Gari, drafted the resolution, said an increasn in oll"-campus senators would improve communication bntwnen student government and ofl"-eampus residents. who constitute about 20 percent of tho student body. 
If passed, the n1solution potentially would have led to an amendment of the Student Body Constitution, increasing the ofT­campus mmnbnrship from one to two senators. 
(;ari said that if thn ofl"-cam­pus students were proportional­ly represented in the Senate, they would require four sena­tors. Ilowew~r. dorms currently do not have proportional repre­sentation in the Senate, so he recommende9 one male and one female senator to address both genders' off-campus issues. 
"Since it's the only coed con­stituency ... you can say that be<:ause the women otl"-campus didn't have a female represen­tative, a lot of their issues weren't really well represented this year," Gari said. "In that case, they have been disenfran­chised in some way." 
Some senators disagreed with the resolution's recommenda­tion, saying it would lead to unfair elections when unequal numbers of male and female senators run for oflice. 

"It's an elected official," Dillon senator Jim Murphy said. ''I'm worried about appointments or foreing someone in due to the fact that there's a lack of, not necessarily interest, but just one year, nobody from one gender running." 
Sorin senator George Chamberlain proposed to amend the resolution and remove the requirement to have both genders represented. 
Other senators disagreed. 
"There arc already more boys' dorms than girls' dorms," Pangborn senator Denise Barons aid. "With the addition of Duncan, there I will be] two more boys' dorms than girls' dorms. I think that there's an efl"ort, a precedent within sen­ate to keep a gender balance." 
Besides the gender issue, sen­ators debated the necessity of an additional off-eampus mem­ber. "As the off-campus sena­tor, I don't really see a need for this," senior Andrew Troia said. "The problem is not so much communication, just that most of what we do in Senate is geared towards the undergrad­uates living on campus." 
Additionally, off-campus sena­tors do not have as many resources to relay campus news to other students, such as Hall Council meetings or posters in the dorms. 
''I'm just worried about what foreseeable change it will pro­duce. Being off campus, there's no group meeting at Turtle Creek [or[ Hall Council," Murphy said. "I just don't know if more is necessarily better." 
Even though off-campus stu­dents may have less access to campus news and events, stu­dent body president Liz Brown, who lives off campus, said some students still like to remain involved with the Notre Dame community. 
"I don't think you're moving off-campus with the [intention] to get disconnected," she said. "I think that there is definitely a disconnect in communication." 
In other Senate news: 
+The Senate passed a resolu­tion amending the Student Body Constitution. This amendment stated that the Student Body President will nominate Senate Committee Chairs, and two­thirds of the Senate must approve the nominations. 
+Faculty Senate liaison Professor Thomas Noble said the Faculty Senate passed a res­olution supporting elocks in all classrooms. This resolution will be implemented, since a previ­ous Student Senate resolution also supported the issue.

Sex scandal forces Spitzer to resign 
N.Y. politician could face federal charges, state's first black governor will succeed him 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK -In a star­tlingly swift fall from grace, Gov. Eliot Spitzer resigned Wednesday after getting caught in a call-girl scandal that made a mockery of his straight-arrow image and left him facing the prospect of criminal charges and per­haps disbarment. 
"I cannot allow my private failings to disrupt the peo­ple's work," Spitzer said, his weary-looking wife, Silda, standing at his side, again, as the corruption-fighting politician once known as Mi. Clean answered for his actions for the second time in three days. 
He made the announce­ment without securing a plea bargain with federal prosecutors, though a law enforcement official said the former governor was still believed to be negotiating one. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the ease. 
Spitzer will be succeeded on Monday by Lt. Gov. David Paterson. a fellow Democrat who becomes New York's first black governor and the nation's first legally blind chief executive.

"One of the most serious of these eating disorders is anorexia," shi-l said. 
"Those· who suffer from 
f o o d , dieting 
or calories." 
Anorexia, unlike some other eating disorders, is usually identified by extreme weight-loss. Other physical symptoms include fainting, fatigue and overall weakness. Long-term suffer­ers might develop an irregu­lar heart rhythm or heart failure, she said. 
In contrast to anorexia, bulimia does not usually entail significant weight­loss. 
"These patients eat large amounts of food over short periods and then inc! uce vomiting or take laxatives," Hodts said. "Because the patients eat, they may main­tain their weight better." 
Since bulimic patients don't necessarily lose a lot of weight it is often hard for others to recognize that they may have a problem. Hodts said her niece dealt with bulimia personally and the nurse did not recognize the warning signs.

Thny are especially dan­gerous for women beeausn they deplete a reserve of bone strnngth women need later in life bncausn they lose bonn mass much more rapidly than males as tlwy age, Hodts said. 
"Acting ]by getting hnlpl is necessary to prevnnt lifelong disabilities," she said. "Eating disorders can affect your well-bning 30 to 40 years down the road," she said. 
Junior Sarah Ponto said that she found the portion of Hodts' lecture which spoke specifically to women partic­ularly informative. 
"Evon though I'm a pre­med, there was a lot I didn't know about the electrolyte balance and the range of physiological effects of eat­ing disord1Hs," she said. 
"In my niece's situation, we did not sen it, we did not know it was going on," she said. 
Hodts said that sometimes one of the only ways you can recognize a patient dealing with bulimia is by looking for the other symptoms.

IN BRIEF 
Bush pushes for Columbian trade deal 
WASHINGTON -President Bush warned Congress on Wednesday that failing to approve a trade deal with Colombia would fuel the anti-American regime of Venezuela's llugo Chavez and cast the United States as untrustworthy and impo­tent across South America. 
The intensity of Bush's rhetoric reflected the importance of the deal to him -and the faet that he's fast running out of time to get it done. Democrats have objected that Colombia's government has not done enough to halt violence, protect labor aetivists and demobilize paramilitary organizations. 
"If Congress were to reject the agreement with Colombia, we would validate antago­nists in Latin America. who would say that Ameriea cannot bfl trusted to stand by its friends," Bush said in a speech to the U.S. Ilispanie Chamber of Commerce. 
"We would cripple our influence in the region, and make other nations less likely to cooperate with us in the future," the president said. "We would betray one of our closP.st friends in our own backyard." 
Airline cancels flights for inspections 
DALLAS -Southwest Airlines Co. can­eeled flights Wednesday and temporarily grounded 43 planes to examine if they were sound enough to carry passengers, the lat­est twist in the low-cost carrier's saga of missed safety inspections and civil penal­ties. 
The groundings affected about 8 percent of Southwest's f"leet, and came as the airline faces a $10.2 million civil penalty for con­tinuing to fly nearly 50 planes that hadn't been inspected for cracks in their fuselages. 
Southwest shares fell more than 9 percent before closing down 7.3 percent. 
Since the Federal Aviation Administration announced the penalty last week, Southwest has endured a steady drip of bad publicity, which is unusual for the nation's most consistently profitable carrim and one that has never had an accident that killed passengers or crew members.

"I want to put that in eon­text.. You know I am sorry if anyone was offended. It was certainly not nwant in any way to be ol'fensive," llillary Clinton said. "We can be proud of' both .Jesse .Jackson and Senator Obama." 
"Anyone who has followed my husband's public life or my public lifo know very well where WI' have stood and what we have stood for and who we have stood with," she said, acknowledging that whoevnr wins the nomination will h<tve to lwal the wounds or a bruis­ing, historic: contest.

Cuban athletes disappear in Florida 
Associated Press 
TAMPA -Five Cuban soccer players went missing Tuesday night after the under-23 team played a key match against the United States, a team ol'ficial said Wednesday. 
The missing men had not yet reported to authorities. 
Zachary Mann, a spokesman for Customs and Border Proteetion. said it's unlikely the agency will learn the men's whereabouts until they come forward. 
Under the United States' "wet foot, dry foot" policy, Cubans who reach U.S. soil are allowed to remain in the coun­try and apply for U.S. residen­cy after one year.

Dogs rescued fron1 Ariz. house 
Over 800 animals taken from ovenvhelmed owners and put in area shelters 
Associated Press 
TUCSON, Ariz. -About 800 small dogs, including Chihuahuas, terriers and Pomeranians, were seized from a triple-wide mobile home whose occupants were over­whelmed trying to care for the animals, authorities said Wednesday. 
Pima County sheriff's deputies and animal welfare officials who removed the dogs also found 82 caged parrots in the home in a rural area north­west of Tucson. 
Some dogs were pregnant and giving birth as they were taken to shelters in Tucson, said Jenny Rose, a spokes­woman for the Humane Society of Southern Arizona. Ninety-six dogs were taken from the house Monday and another 700 on Wednesday, she said. 
"The home was definitely in very bad condition, urine and feces all over the home, in the kitchen and bedroom, with a very strong odor," she said. "Obviously, 800 dogs in a triple­wide mobile home, they were packed in there. That being said, they were in pretty good shape." 
The elderly owners, who·have not been identified, were apparently overwhelmed but have cooperated with authori­ties, sheriff's Sgt. James Ogden said. No charges have been filed, but authorities continue to investigate. 
The animals appeared to have had enough food, but a few were missing paws -some from having been attacked by . other animals, others appar­ently having caught their feet in fencing outside, Rose said. 
The breeds included Chinese cresteds and Lhasa apsos. The owners were breeding and offering the dogs for sale, Rose said, but she described it as a hoarding case, in which elderly people sometimes feel no one else can give their animals a good home and won't part with them. 
Deputies were alerted this month after a woman who bought a Chihuahua at the home reported the conditions, Ogden said.

Boys,momsmvive fall on highway 
Associated Press 
DALLAS -Driving to her job at a landscaping compa­ny on Interstate 30, Sondra Plunk saw a young boy fall from an overpass and land in the lane next to her. 
"I saw his face," she said. "I saw the fear in his face." 
The boy and his brother were tossed from the over­pass east of downtown Dallas on Wednesday, allegedly by their mother, who then made the two­story jump herself. Somehow, all of them sur­vived dropping into the fast lane of morning rush hour 

traffic. 
Plunk said the boy she saw fall ended up in the path of a van, which fishtailed as its driver slammed the brakes and swerved. Plunk was unsure if the van struck the boy. 
The boy landed on his side and immediately popped up onto his hands and knees, staring into the van's head­lights. 
"He rolled to all fours," said Plunk, 44. "Knowing he was still alive, knowing he was still conscious and he had the presence of mind to think, 'My God, I have to get out of here."' 
Police said the boys, ages 6 and 8, were in stable con­dition, but hospital officials declined to comment later Wednesday. Their mother, Khandi Busby, was in fair condition at another hospi­tal, a hospital spokeswoman said. 
Police said they believe the traffic, which Plunk esti­mated had been traveling 35 to 40 mph, hit Busby and they 8-year-old but man­aged to avoid the younger boy. All three were able to speak with investigators, although the 8-year-old may have suffered internal injuries. 
"It was really miraculous that we didn't have some fatalities with this incident," Dallas police spokesman Sgt. Gil Cerda said. 
Busby, 27, had not been arrested as of Wednesday but could face two charges of attempted capital murder, Cerda said. 
"The why remains a mys­tery to us," police Lt. C.L. Williams said. "If you try to apply logic to these inci­dents, they totally defy any logical explanation." 
Shortly before 6:30 a.m. Wednesday, Busby and her sons walked away from her father, who had stopped for gas while driving_ them to a friend's house. Police do not know why Busby left with her children. 
"She was not fleeing for her safety," Cerda said. "She just threw them ovPr and decided to throw herself over." 
Her father tried to follow the three in the car but was unable to get to them before they reached the overpass. 
Police said each boy strug­gled with Busby as she picked him up and threw him onto the far left lane of the freeway, where cars swerved to avoid them. 
Dr. Dave Milzman, a mem­ber of the American College of Emergency Physicians, said that if someone lands feet first their odds of sur­viving a fall from 22 feet are good. 
"As long as they landed kind of upright, it's not that unusual not to injure them­selves severely," Milzman said. 
Busby has a criminal record, including convic­tions for assault and crimi­nal trespass of a habitation. Child Protective Services had intervened with her on at least three occasions for 
incidents  that  police

Honestly now -how many times have you broken your Lenten promise so far? I promised to spend 20 to 30 minutes in quiet prayer each morning this Lent, but know of at least five days when that has 
Fr. Lou Delfra
not happened, three days when I didn't reach the finish Faithpoint
line, and at least 
five more when my prayer was so distracted it could hardly count as prayer. 
Today is the 32nd day of Lent, and that's thirteen whiffs. If Lent was a baseball game, my .600 average would have someone checking me for steroids. God, however, has not yet knocked on the door with a random drug test, so the numbers don't seem to impress Him much. Has God ever tried to hit a baseball? It's not that easy... 
The days when we break our Lenten promises can be the most important of the 40 days of Lent. By reminding us of our seemingly unshakeable inability to keep even simple commit­ments to God bring with them a whole battery of interior reactions that are rich with the possibility of deeper self-knowledge, and a deeper knowl­edge of God. I have learned some of my most enduring spiritual lessons while swinging and missing in Lent. 
Most importantly, I have discovered that, if I put my mind to it, I am capa­ble of endlessly frustrating myself. I have never made it through a flawless forty days of Lent, and the prospects for next year don't look great either. I am pretty sure I am incapable of pulling off a perfect Lent. And once I 
I'd be in jail 
start thinking outside of Lent to the 
challenges that confront me the other 
320 days, it's a wonder I get up in the 
morning. It'd be easier and safer if I 
just stayed in Dillon with the door 
locked. 
Of course, this spiritual depression 
-born of a spiritual perfectionism ­
is a helpful conclusion to reach pre­
cisely for its absurdity. Lent reminds 
me precisely of the certainty that 
moral and spiritual perfection is an 
impossibility for me. Yet, an over­
whelming sense of discouragement at 
my failings hardly helps us build up 
of the Kingdom, which I personally 
and definitely can't do locked in my 
room at Dillon -no offense to the 
guys at Dillon. 
My search for a more helpful 
response sends my mind through the 
Scriptures. and an almost daily 
reminder of the collection of sinners 
with whom Jesus spent his days. 
Times of spiritual discouragement, 
or realizations of our weakness, are 
extremely rich times to read Jesus' 
encounter with the town thief 
Zacchaeus, or Jesus' calling of 
Matthew the tax collector. I nearly cry 
each third Sunday of Lent as I hear 
Jesus speak in utter compassion to 
the adulterous Samaritan woman sit­
ting at the well: "You are thirsting 
after water that will make you thirsty 
again. But I can give you water so 
that you will thirst no more." 
These are people of moral imperfec­
tion, and what strikes me to the heart 
is not so much that Jesus forgives 
them (though of course he does) but 
that he seems to seek out, and then 
remains in, their company. 

Reading these passages, and seeing myself in them, are some of the most intimate moments with God that I experience all year. 
While they don't justify my sins and shortcomings, they do speak to them -and the words are ones of mercy, love, and a renewed call to conver­sion and true freedom and relation­ship with God. My Lenten failings are invitations not into discouragement, but into a deeper understanding of the depth of God's mercy and love. 
Perhaps, I shouldn't be so content with imperfection, but-truth be told -I kind of like hitting .600 during Lent. Recognition of our limitations, and recognition of our thirst to tran­scend them -even if that recognition some days manifests itself only as frustration with ourselves-is a time-tested gateway to a more vibrant and real relationship with Christ. 
Our limitations make us one with most of the Gospel characters whom Jesus goes out of his way to encounter. Jesus seeks for us with such persistent compassion despite, I indeed because of, our sin, failures, and imperfections. 
So .600 it is this Lent, with eight days to go. Hey, it's hard to hit a baseball with perfect regularity, and besides, you don't want to be at the peak of your game in spring training.

How to Play: 

To complete the Observer letters to the editor below, fill in the blanks by selecting from the three options in each of the parenthesis. Enjoy! 
To the Editor: 
I disagree with the March 10 Letter to the Editor, entitled 
("St. Mary's Is Only Here for Sex and Demeaning Cartoons," "Golden Dome for Everyone: Homosexuality at Notre Dame," "Vagina Monologues Should Be Performed Under Dome"). 
Notre Dame must remain a paragon of our beautiful Lady's spir­it. And, as (Genesis 1:1, 2 Kings 2:24-look it up, trust me, John 3:16) reminds us, the Bible, our beautiful Lady's beautiful book, explicitly forbids the "Vagina Monologues" from being performed on Catholic campuses not named _____ (Georgetown, Boston College, Saint Louis). 
Unfortunately, the liberal minority that is ____ (The Observer, the English Department, the Society of Women Engineers) seem to want to turn our Lady's University into ____ (a socialist state, a Godless Hell, an abortion clinic housed in that cool looking power plant with the glass fa~ade near North Quad). 
First, (the forces of evil, the anti-God cabal, Fr. McBrien) tried to force us to _____ (watch the Vagina Monologues, support Barack Obama, pay a living wage). 
Next, they wanted this Catholic university to (hire more non-Catholic faculty, eliminate pari­etals, start a Native American Studies minor). 
Finally, they insisted we _____ (support a Queer Film Festival, support a Queer, support a Film Festival). 
What's next? _______ (Birth control in LaFortune?, Tariq Ramadan?, GreeNO?). 
Luckily, there is still one paragon of Fr. Sorin 's vision of this great University: _______ (the Irish Rover, Fr. Hesburgh, Golden Tate). With this guidance and strength, Notre Dame can once again look all critics in the eye and say _____ ("Never again will we dream a dream too small," "See, we still deserve your money, conserva­tive-Catholic donors," "Suck it, Trojans"). 
In the name of _______ (the Father, the Son, the Holy Spirit), 
D. Mahon ______ (Freshman, Grad Student, Alum) 
·---..,---(Old College, Off Campus, Class of 1957) 
To the Editor: 

As the (chairman, chairwoman, gender-neutral chair­person) of this year's VoCP-Vaginas on Campus Project-! want to com­mend the University for allowing the performance of the "Vagina Monologues." 
As (Shakespeare, Ibsen, Garcia Lorca) can attest, great plays often encounter stiff opposition amid cries of immorality. 
D. Mahon's March 11 letter fits the pattern. Mr. Mahon betrays a (offensiveness, igno­rance, penis-first chauvinism) typical of the writings of a (freshman, grad student, 1957 alum­nus). 

Mr. Mahon, I want to teach you a lesson. A lesson about Jesus. This is a man -do we even know he's a man, Mr. Mahon? -who gave voice to a prostitute. But you seem to think he would not grant the same voice to (a woman with an "angry vagina?," a woman who was "a moaner?," a man who "liked to look at it?"). Jesus was about empowering the oppressed ­and who is more oppressed than 
(a woman in the Catholic Church, a white 21-year-old woman from a lakefront Wilmette mansion, a woman who has been unable to share her feelings about her vagina with a scholarly audi­ence). 
As such, it seems clear that the Vagina Monologues ought to sit alongside (Fr. Sarin's diaries, the Bible, DuLac) in the Notre Dame canon. 
But our respect for females and their genitalia must go beyond a few days of performance in March. Each day, we must ________ (denounce female genital mutilation in Africa, yell the c-word on South Quad before our 9:35 class. respect St. Mary's). 
Such an act will ensure academic freedom in the truest sense. After all, how are women supposed to express themselves in the classroom if they can't (walk around naked ... errr, liberated?, shave their heads but not their armpits?, perform spontaneous vagi­na-related skits in the Basilica?) 
Second, we must fire Charlie Weis and hire (Pat Summitt, 
C. Vivian Stringer, Ty Willingham). 
But perhaps most importantly, Notre Dame and St. Mary's women must band together to ---:-----,-----(reject those 
who continue to imply through words and actions that women are inferior, make female sexuality as acceptable as male sexuality on campus, vote for Hillary Clinton). We can only do this in one way: by ________ (working together!, requiring students to read The Pussy Ranch, Diablo Cody's blog, every day!, smoking. A lot!). 
With the help of VoCP, and the per­formance of the "Vagina Monologues," I hope Notre Dame can educate ignorant Catholics like Mr. Mahon. Women of Notre Dame and Saint Mary's: we must stand together and support academic freedom. After all, (this is a university founded on the legacy of a woman!, nothing says liberation like a play in 101 DeBartolo!, a woman divided cannot stand!)

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 

A realistic view of sexuality 
This letter is in response to Brother Bill Mewes' letter ("Real issues," Mar. 11) in which several points made personally disturbed me. 
The first was his offer of congratulations to Greg Yatarola, the 30-something year old alumnus who consistently writes serious yet inane letters to The Observer. I feel safe in saying that Greg should not be lauded for his writings, as being an older man he a) should have something better to do with his time than write to his alma mater's newspaper, and b) he is too out of touch with the college-student mentality to be taken seriously. 
Second: Brother Mewes demonizes students' desires to be free of classes on the w~ekends by blindly stating w~ all want to get drunk and have sex. I live in a quad With three young, hormone-dnven males, and I feel confident in saying that all we are interested in _(any time of the week) is sex-if by sex you mean Zelda, Super Smash Bros, and gwtar. And one of my roommates has a girlfriend. 
Third: He states that this semester is the first in five years where an article has been written to counter t~e wanton sexual content in today's society. However, last year I wrote a letter decrymg the prevalence of porn in the media ("Disrespectful mentality needs to go," Oct. 17, 2007). 
Fourth: When a college student asked him how to be chaste and pure, Brother Mewes writes a suggestion to observe heartily the sacraments of Reconciliation Eucharist, and prayer. ' 
Althou~h t~ese are all praiseworthy acts, these suggestions just show how out of tou~h ~e IS With college-ag~ students. I suggest a more practical way to keep guys out of grrls pants, and though It may keep you chaste, it sure won't keep you pure.

'Monologues' a disgrace 
I ~tte_?ded No_tre Dame from 1965-68. The university was in the early throes ofmod­ermzatiOn and It. seems upon reflection that it wasn't quite clear who was really in c_harge-the pnests or the trustees. A bit of drift was evident. I don't pay much atten­tion to Notre Dame these days. But it was made known to me today that the "Vagina Monologues" will ~e performed at Notre Dame. I was kind of rebellious during my col­lege ~ear~. But I still considered myself a Catholic. This is why I am disgusted; that this play IS gomg to be performed at Notre Dame. Being a Catholic used to mean something. I guess it doesn't mean much at Notre Dame, not ifstanding up for a moral code might offend the hip on the Left. I see nothing much has changed at Notre Dame since I left 40 years ago. Still adrift. Not sure who, ifanyone, is in charge. My dad, class of '28, would throw up if he heard what is going on at the institution he devoted his life to. 
Shame on you, Fr. Jenkins.

Eating disorder 
discourse crucial 
I would like to commend both Tara Gilbride and The Observer for acknowledging the significant issue of eating disorders on the Notre Dame campus. As the article mentioned, eating disorders are not uncommon; however they often serve to iso­late and consume the men and women struggling. 
Eating disorders, like other mental illnesses, are real, organic disorders -and like ~ny other serious disease, they are not a choice or an individual failing. As a survivor, not only can I attest to the devastation eating disorders cause, but I can also assure that treatment is effective and recovery is possible. 
Thank you, Tara, for courageously sharing your story, and for giving a voice to those s~lenced. b~ these seri~us disorders. I encourage the Notre Dame community to contmue this Important discourse by attending the Health and Body Image Conference, and by reaching out to those who are in need of help and support. And for those of you struggling, please know that you are not alone.

The Mars Volta wants to blow your mind. Since its inception in 2001 from the ashes of the late, great, "At the Drive-ln." the California group has never ceased pushing musical boundaries. 

J>dying genre classification as well as traditional song structure, the closest term that could be used to describe its music is simply "forward-thinking." There are hints of punk, salsa, metal and jazz sprinkled throughout each of its 
"The Bedlam in Goliath" 
The Mars Volta 
Released by: Universal Recommended Tracks: 'Wax Simulcra," ''Tourniquet Man" and "Goliath" 
four albums. The partnership central to the group, vocalist Cedric Bixler-Zavala and guitarist Omar A. Rodriguez-Lopez, must have the most diverse collection of music on their iPods the world has ever seen. 
The group's most recent album, "The Bedlam in Goliath," is a definite step up from its previous effort, 2006's meander­ing "Amputecthture." It is almost as lin­ear and straightforward an album as the band's 2003 debut "Deloused in the Comatorium." Of course, words like "lin­ear" and "straightforward" are relative, in this case being code words for "no 
songs over 10 minutes in length." Gone are the half hour multi-movement excursions of yesteryear. Instead, we get the furi­ous two-and-a-half minute burst of "Wax Simulacra." 
There are 12 songs, and increase from previous efforts, and despite the album's overarching con­cept, these are the least prog-rock songs the Mars Volta has written in years. Which isn't to say it's become Maroon 5; this record is still more 
Hughes' madness 
esoteric and flat-out bizarre than nearly anything else out today. The fact of the matter is that when compared to Mars Volta previous body of work, which sounds like it was written 100 years in the future by aliens who sing in Spanish, English and made-up words, the melodic hooks of "Bedlam" seem fairly tame. 
At the same time, this is the Mars Volta's heaviest and loudest offering yet. Complexity and length were dialed back, if only slightly, in exchange for brute force. The band is rocking harder than it ever has. Songs like "Goliath", "Metatron" and opener "Aberinkula" leave an impact right away, with Bixler­Zavala's voice complementing Rodriguez-Lopez's wailing guitars and Thomas Pridgen's pounding drums. The extended ambient intros are gone, a common feature from its previous albums. After the snooze-fest that was "Amputechture," it's relieving to see the group become more concise in its play­ing, yet maintain its experimental nature. 
The other short song, "Tourniquet Man", is a head turner. Far and away the softest and slowest song of the dozen, it is a brief respite from the fury heard on every other song. Minimal gui­tars and keyboard effects back up the vocals on this bizarre love song. 
lights 

For all the strides made in streamlin­ing its music, the Mars Volta still have not matched the genius of its second album "Frances the Mute." While that album was gloriously excessive, it still seemed like every second was essfmtial, something that can't be said for "Bedlam." The 76-minute runtime is far too long -at least two of the songs on the second half of "Goliath" should have been cut out, as they all sound basically the same. Shorter songs don't count for much when the back half album is loaded with sound-a-likes. Filler is filler, no matter the song length. 
The Mars Volta should be commended for its new approach, but the group still has something to learn about restraint. After pushing its sound to the absolute limit, it realized that sometimes a slight­ly more head-on approach works just as well. The problem lies in not going far enough from what it knows. Maybe the band should try making a record less than 70 minutes long. There arc some very strong songs on "The Bedlam in Goliath," and the good stuff far out­weighs the bad. It just so happens that the best songs are the shortest and most different from its normal style. Funny how that works.

Every once in a while one of my interests will turn into obsession, and no where is this more frequent than in the realm of pop culturn. Let's face it, I don't do my home­work. I read magazines and blogs and watch TV and movies all day long. I low else would I get myself Cassie Belek through the long, cold months until spring? Assistant Some of my pop cul­Scene Editor ture obsessions are constant-"General Hospital," Entertainment Weekly, "30 Rock," any and all celebrity gossip. But here am a few new items I'm obsessing over: 
Election coverage 
I love election tin1e because it makes me feel like a real political science student. During break, I found myself completely captivated by the Iowa caucuses and each primary after that. But my obsession is more specific. I'm particularly drawn to MSNHC's coverage of the campaigns and primaries, partly because NBC is my favorite television network, but mainly because I have a platonic old man crush on Tom Brokaw. 
Although Tom retired from his usual nightly news job, he'll pop up every once in a while on NBC or MSNBC. These moments are unpredictable, but they usually occur on primary nighL'>. I have a strange obses­sion with Tom Brokaw that creeps out my friends, but I think they're just jealous of our secret love. 
"Touch My Body" by Mariah Carey 
About a week before Mariah debuted her new single, a friend and I agreed that we were going through Mariah withdraw!. Imagine our surprise when a trusty blog sent us to her website to get a sneak peek of "Touch My Body." Let's just say that I'm counting down the days until April 15 when she drops her new album. I have to say that I like the video even more than the song because I love a diva who can bring the funny. With help from co-star Jack McBrayer ("30 Rock") and director Brett Ratner (say wha?), Mariah shows us her sense of humor again and looks fabulous. I could never see Beyonce doing a video like this, and that's why Minli will always be queen bee. 
MATI HUDSON I Observer Graphic 
"All My Children" 
I keep up with "AMC" off and on, but it takes quite a bit to get me to start watching religiously again. All it took for me to add a series recording of "AMC" to my DVR this time was an old-fashioned anmesia story­line and the return of daytime's first African-American supercouple-Jesse and Angie. "AMC" decided to give Ryan anme­sia (Maria had it a few years back) and I'm hooked watching how each character reacts to his ordeal. Ryan has forgotten the last four years ofhis life so he thinks that he is still in love and engaged to Kendall (who is now happily married to Zach) even though he is currently married to Annie. 
Meanwhile, Jesse and Angie are back together after it was believed that Jesse had been dead for the past 20 years. It's a gen­eral rule that no one ever really dies in soap operas. Even if we see you as a ghost (which we did with Jesse in 2001), there's a way to keep you alive. So it's been heart­warming to see this couple together (since I was just a baby the first time around), and viewers have been treated to retrospective clips to get us caught up on the love story. Supercouples are few and far between these days so it's always refreshing when an old one comes back. 
"Rock of Love 2" 
I have an excuse for this one. I met Ambre. She is my cousin's friend's hus­band's best friend from graduate school. Meeting her wasn't as complicated as describing my connection to her. But let's just say that I have some juicy "Rock of Love" gossip and a few hints about what's going to happen in future episodes. Not only docs having background knowledge enhance my viewing of the show, but it also gives me someone to genuinely root for. Ambre seems too smart and normal to be picked by Bret, but at least she has already gained minor celebrity status in Chicago. That's really all you need in life. You're only hassled for a few autographs, you get to throw parties with vodka sponsors at bars and you're forever a member of the VH-1 family (which includes endless opportuni­ties to capitalize on that connection).

NCAA MEN'S BASKETBALL 

Nova upends 'Cuse, helps NCAA Tourney chances 
Alexander's 22 points, stifling defense lead West Virginia to a first round victory over Providence 
Associated Press 
NEW YOHK -Jay Wright has another uncomfortable night ahead of him, looking f(lrward to Villanova's socond-round game in tho Big East tournament. 
Jim Boehoim can rost a little bit 
f'asinr, but for all the wrong rna­
sons. 
Scottin Hnynolds scored 22 points and Villanova rode some hot shooting in the second half" to knock of"f Syracuse H2-63 Wednesday, and dramatically help it'> cause in what amounted to an NCAA tournament elimina­tion game. 
The tmuns split tlwir regular­season mentings and each came into the conf"erenee tournament nneding a eoupln of wins to bn~ath easier on Selection Sunday. 
By the timn Heynolds curlnd in consecutive 3-pointers with less than 7 minutes loll to extend the llmd to double ligures, Wright and the Wildcats could exhale over so slightly. 
"I hope it's nnough, but I know I hav(~ no say in it," Wright said. "We get to play another day. That's all we'rn interested in, get­ting to play another day." 
Eighth-seeded Villanova advanced to play the top seed, No. 9 Georgetown, in a rematch of" a S~)COnd-round game won last year by tho lloyas. A victory against a team they've never beaten in four conlhrcnce tourna­ment games would almost surely be enough lor the Wildcat<;. 
"We're just going to go out and play the game," Villanova fresh­man Corey Stokes said. "Me and my teammates have been really looking forward to this game." 
Unlike last season, when Syracuse was left out of the NCAA tournament despite win­ning 22 games, Boeheim glumly acknowledged there won't be much Sunday drama this time around. 
"After last year, we probably had to win two or three games," he said. "We had to keep winning and I don't think one win would have been enough .... In my mind and their mind, if they're not in the NCAA tournament it's not a good year." 
Stokes hit four 3-pointers and finished with 18 points for Villanova, which made 11 3­pointers against Syracuse, includ­ing a blistering H of 10 in the sec­ond half. The Wildcats improved to 14-1 this season when hitting at least eight 3-pointers in a game. 
"In the second half, we just did­n't do a good job of reacting to where Heynolds and Stokes were," Boeheim said. "The open looks from the 3-point line, I thought, were the difference today." 
Dwayne Anderson added 14 points, Dante Cunningham 13 and Shane Clark 11 for Villanova, whieh gave up several inches at most positions but still managed to outrebound Syracuse 40-27 and grab 14 ollimsive rebounds. 
Donto Greene and .lonny Flynn, the nation's second-highest scor­ing freshman duo, did their part for Syracuse. Green finished with 17 point.:; and Flynn had 16, but aside from 13 points from Paul Harris, they got little help. 
The Orange (19-13) led throughout the first half and early in the second, when their inability to grab a rebound or hold onto the ball finally did them in. 
Stokes hit a deep 3-pointer with 
12:26 lett to make it 44-41 -giv­ing Villanova a 19-0 advantage in points oil" the bench to that point -and Syracuse went more than 4 minutes without a basket while the Wildcats pulled away. 
Anderson's 3-pointer with 8:35 left seemed to demoralize Syracuse, and a pair of 3s by Heynolds on Villanova's ·next two possessions made it 61-4 7 and left Boeheim standing stone still, arms crossed in frustration. 
The Wildcats eontinued to pour it on, the lead increasing to 20 when Arinze Onuaku fouled out with 4:32 left and Cunningham made good on a pair of free throws. 
West Virginia 58, Providence 53 
NEW YOHK-Bob Huggins was just being honest with his West Virginia team during the final minutes of ito:; Big East tour­nament opener. 
"We were just trying to tell our guys that we've worked this hard, let's just go get a stop. Let's go do what we're supposed to do," the first-year coach with 613 wins said. "I thought we made them take hard shots." 
Joe Alexander scored 22 points and West Virginia held Providence to two field goals over the final 7 minutes of the victory Wednesday. 
The fifth-seeded Mountaineers (23-9) advanced to Thursday's quarterfinals, where they will face fourth-seeded and 15th­ranked Connecticut. The Huskies beat West Virginia 79-71 in the teams' only meeting on March 1. 


"They're good and they're play­ing at real high level right now," Huggins said of Connecticut. "We played pretty well for one half up there. We'd go in the locker room down 16 or 17 and came out in the second half and played a whole lot better and actually got back in the game." 
Alexander had averaged 31 points over the last three games and he had a hand in West Virginia's last six points against Providence (15-16). 

Da'Sean Butler had 17 points for the Mountaineers, including consecutive baskets on offensive rebounds that started West Virginia's game-closing 11-5 run. 
"At the end of the game we got them to miss a couple of times and they got up on the offensive glass at big points in the game," Providence coach Tim Welsh said. "They got offensive rebounds and put them in. We got a couple of drives where we put the ball in and they called a walk. We fought. We challenged. We stuck to our game plan as good as any night this year. The shots just didn't go down at times but we battled, scrapped and clawed." 
Weyinmi Efejuku had 12 poinl.o:; to lead the Friars, who dropped to 1-6 in their last seven Big East tournament games.

Associated Press 
PHOENIX -Oakland third baseman Eric Chavez flew to Los Angeles on Wednesday to have a follow-up examina· tion on his back. 
He had an appointment with Dr. Robert Watkins, who operated on Chavez last Oct. 9. Chavez was due back in Arizona later Wednesday. 
The six-time Gold Glove winner still hopes to join the Athletics for their opening trip to Japan to play the World Series champion Boston Red Sox on March 25-26. He is even willing to go and be the designated hitter, or serve as an ambassador to promote the series. 
Whether the A's decide that's a good idea-with the long flight and all ­isn't yet clear. They leave the desert in a week. 
"He just has to get healthy," manager Bob Geren said Wednesday before the A's hosted the Arizona Diamondbacks. "When he gets in these games down here is more of a medical question." 
The 30-year-old Chavez also had offseason opera­tions on both shoulders. He received an injection in his back Feb. 29 to ease inflammation. 
He had back spasms last year that landed him on the disabled list for the final two months of the 2007 season. 

"I want to move this along. Do I want to play (in Japan)? Yeah, I do," Chavez said. "I don't know what will happen or should or shouldn't hap­pen. If they want me to be there, no doubt I'll show up." 
1\s athletic trainer Steve Sayles has said he would like to see Chavez running the bases first and then fielding consistently before giving him medical clear­ance. The bending over to field the ball has bothered Chavez's back in the past. 
Chavez had three plate appearances in a simulate game Tuesday: a walk, a fly ball to right that was dropped for an error and a single off the wall in left. He saw 10 pitches and took three swings, and he is eager to DH in a game soon. 
He isn't as concerned with running the bases as getting his timing at third. 
"I really don't have to test that right now," he said of running. "It's such a question mark right now. I'm running at 60-70 
,percent and I'm going to have to do that for a while. I'm really here to play, but that's my prob­lem. I could easily say, 'I'm a month out' and ease into it, but that's not my style."

Rockets win 20 straight, tie 30-year NBA record 
Associated Press 
ATLANTA -The Houston 

Hoekets' 20th straight win was 
far from pretty, but coach Hick 
Adelman was still impressed 
with his team. 
The Hockcts were held to 

their lowest first-half total of 
the season but pulled away late 
to become the third team in 
NBA history to win 20 consecu­
tive games, tying for the 
league's second-longest winning 
streak with an R3-75 victory 
over the Atlanta Hawks on 
Wednesday night. 
"It may be the ugliest thing we've done. but it might have been the best one." Adelman said. "the way we fought through it." 
The Hockets joined the 1971­72 Los Angeles Lakers (33 straight) and 1970-71 Milwaukee Bucks (20) as the only teams to win 20 or more in a row. 
"We did enough to win," Adelman said. 
Tra<~Y McGrady scored 21 of his 2H points in thn second half for llouston, whirh IPd only 71­70 with 5 minutes remaining. Md;rady then scored live points in Houston's 10-0 run to take rontrol. 
"Wn'rn really happy with this win lw<~ausn WP didn't play well in the first half." McGrady said. "This is a prntty ugly gamn tonight. We didn't shoot well and it was one of those games that our dnl'ensn mally had to win for us." 
The Horkets are 20-0 since their last loss on Jan. 27 against Utah, including 7-0 sinee losing Yao Ming to a foot injury on Feb. 26. The llawks· have 16 losses in t.hat same period. 
A basknt by Atlanta's Marvin Williams with 5 seconds left in the game ended the Hoc;kets' strnak of I 0 straight wins by 10 or more points. Jon Johnson led the llawks with 2H points, and .Josh Smith had 16 points and a <~areer-high 22 n~bounds.

Added Adelman: "You could see the guys, it really means something to get this and just keep not only the streak going, but keep moving in the right direction." 
Shane Battier had 15 points as Houston struggled to pre­
serve its winning streak despite trailing 33-32 at halftime. 
"Houston makes you play that way," Johnson said. "They are not a fast-paced team." 
Houstoq led 59-57 at the end of the third quarter, but Atlanta's Zaza Paehulia opened the fourth with two free throws. Minutes later, he was called for a technical foul after arguing an offensive foul. Battier made the free throw to give the Rockets a 66-62 lead. 

Atlanta closed to 71-70 when Chuck Hayes and Luis Scola scored on back-to-hack baskets. 
After Smith was denied inside, McGrady stretched the lead to 77-70 with a jumper which bounced twice on the rim before falling through the net. MeGrady added a 3-pointer with 1:53 left for an 81-70 lead to cap the 10-0 run. 
The Hawks have lost six of seven, but remain in contention to end the league's longest streak without a playoff appearanee. They fell one-half game behind New Jersey for the eighth spot in the Eastern Conference. 
"It's been tough," Johnson said. "Everytime we get in a position to move up, we take a step back." 
Houston allowed only 89.3 points per game during its 19 straight wins and set a low seoring pace against the Hawks. ·

Magic dominate shuggling Oippers 

ORLANDO, Fla. -Tlie Orlando Magic have a list of late-season goals written on the blackboard in their locker room. They .were able to erase the one at the top Wednesday night. 
Dwight Howard had 22 points and 13 rebounds to help the Magic beat the Los Angeles Clippers 110-86, securing their first winning season since the 2002-03 season. 
"We've got some guys in our locker room who have never had a winning season and I think you've got to appreciate some of the things you accom­plish during a season," Magic coach Stan Van Gundy said.. "The next goal is to wrap up a playoff spot and then win our division and secure home-court for the playoffs." 
Howard, playing on a winning team for the first time in his four-year career, got his league-high 57th double-double this season. He also had plenty of help. 
Rashard Lewis had 19 points and nine rebounds and Hedo Tu-rkoglu added 17 points for the Magic, who put all five starters Turkoglu hit three 3-pointers in that run as the Magic lead grew to 19 and they coasted home from there. 

"They were staying back in the paint and leaving us wide open so you've got to take those shots," Van Gundy said. "We usually hit a stretch where enough of them drop and we're in pretty good shape." 
The Clippers got 22 points from Corey Maggette and 17 apiece from Cuttino Mobley and AI Thornton, but were ham­pered by the absence of center Chris Kaman. He missed his second straight game with a sore back. 
"I knew it was going to be a pretty long night against Dwight [Howard] without Chris," Los Angeles coach Mike Dunleavy said. "Dwight was just a nightmare matchup for us. We had to collapse and dou­ble team him and they have too many good shooters. Sooner or later someone is going to catch fire." 
Trailing by 15 at halftime; the Clippers pulled to 69-60 with 
7:48 to play in the third quar­ter. However, Jameer Nelson hit a 3-pointer

The Magic's other noteworthy accomplishment was hitting 11 3-pointers to give them a league-leading 622 this season, which ties a club record for a single season.

Maggete had 20 points in the first half. includ­ing 10 of 12 from the free throw line, but there was little help as the rest of the Clippers hit only 11 of 33 shots.

NASCAR 
Frustrated Stewart continues Goodyear criticism 
Associated Press 
MAHTINSVILLE, Va. -Tony StPwart defended his harsh crit­icism of the tires Goodyear brought to Atlanta last weekend and said that it was time to speak out after years of closed door meetings failed to produce a solution. 
"You finally get to the point where, if you get frustrated enough, now it's gone from doing things in a nice, calm manner to I want to make sure I get somebody's attention about this," Stewart said Wednesday. He had called the tires "the most pathetic racing tire I've ever been on in my professional career."

Some of Stewart's critics dis­missed the remarks, saying Stewart was just being his usual outspoken self. But many driv­ers have agreed that the tires were subpar, including former champions Jeff Gordon and Dale Jarrett. 
"I think we are all pretty frus­trated. Tony took it to the fullest," Kevin Harvick said. "But he's definitely right in the way the tire stuff has worked out. None of us really enjoy the way that we had to race." 
Stewart said all the drivers were fed up with the hard tires at Atlanta, and he just drew the most attention because he was the most outspoken in his criti­cism. 
"Everybody talked about lit]," he said. "Just nobody got real vocal about it until after the race. When you're stuck in a car for 3?-4 hours and it drives like crap, you're going to be upset about it. 
"Guys are screaming at their crew chiefs that it was the worst car they've ever driven. Well, it wasn't the crew chief's fault. It wasn't the team's fault. These guys spend millions of dollars to build these cars. It was the tire we were running and tires should never, ever be the decid­ing factor in a race." 
Stewart also said his com­ments were not directed at the people that make the tires or the ones that mount them on rims at the track, but at the designing engineers. 
"Think about it. Every year we've blown tires. It's like, how many years have they been doing this? At this stage of the game, how do you not figure it out? How could you have not figured out how to not blow tires and build a competitive tire?" he said. 

Stewart said the tire company that has exclusive rights to NASCAR needs to understand that those rights bring responsi­bility, among them listening to the thoughts of drivers and tak­ing them into account. 
"They have to understand that we're the ones that drive them. we're the ones that have to give them the feedback. They need to start listening to us more," he said. 
Harvick, who attended a Philadelphia Flyers game on Wednesday night, said Goodyear "flat out didn't do a very good job," with the tires in Atlanta. 
"I think they could do a better job with the way that they approach the testing and things like that," he said. "As the sport has advanced, it seems like the tires haven't advanced as much as the rest of the sport." 
During a question and answer session with members of the Martinsville-Henry County Chamber of Commerce, Stewart said it was quickly apparent his message had been received. 
Even before NASCAR presi­dent Mike Helton summoned him into the NASCAR hauler, he said, Helton had already heard from a top executive with Goodyear who wasn't happy. 
On Monday, Goodyear issued a statement that said it was satis­fied with the performance of its tires at Atlanta, and that it had no safety issues in the race, but promised to re-evaluate before returning to Atlanta in October.

Belles start hotne season against Manchester 
By LAURA MYERS Sports Writer 

Saint Mary's, who won eight of 1 0 games over its spring break trip in Ft. Myers, Fla.. will look to add two more wins to its record as the Belles host Manchester today in a doubleheader, Saint Mary's home opener. 
"We don't plan on making any changes," head coach Erin Sullivan said. "We will approach Manchester the same way we approach every game, by coming out with intensity." 
Sullivan said her team's has good mental toughness and enthusiasm headed into the matchup with Manchester. She said this mentality is helped by an oft-repeated phrase -"win every inning." 
Junior pitcher Calli Davison will start the first game of the double­header. Davison (5-2) won every game she started in Florida, and pitched shutouts in three of the games. Sullivan said Davison continues to improve every year. 
"[Davison's] hard work this summer, especially on her rise ball. has paid off," she said. "She has really become a great No. 1 pitcher for our team. She is going to have a great season for us." 
Saint Mary's is known for its explosive offense, which has so far outscored opponents 76-26. 
Highlighting this offense are sophomores Ashley Peterson and Maureen Healy, junior Ashley Fusaro, and senior McKenna Corrigan. Corrigan also serves as the team's second starting pitcher. 
The team is continuing to improve in several offensive' areas. In practice, the Belles are becoming more aggressive on the bases and have worked on hitting outside pitches. Sullivan looks to implement these skills against Manchester. 
Sullivan sees an advantage in playing at home. 
"We tend to do very well at home, so we would like to start strong again this season," she said. "I think it's important to have the mindset of winning every game, whether it's home or away." 
Manchester is the first of three non-conference teams the Belles will play before beginning confer­ence play. Saint Mary's, a mem­ber of the Michigan Intercollegiate Athletic Association, plays its first confer­ence game March 29 against Calvin. 
During the 2007 season, the Belles finished third in the MlAA. 
"[Today] is just another test before we start playing confer­ence games," Sullivan said.

Notre Dametoplay Blue Hens 
By ANDY ZICCARELLI 
Sports Writer 
Notre Dame returns home from a spring break road trip in California where Irish coach Tracy Coyne said the Irish approached the games as though they were on vacation, and was disappointed in their mental preparation. 
The No. 12 Irish went 1-2 on the trip, beating California and losing to Stanford and Oregon. 
"We didn't give Stanford the respect that they deserved, which resulted in a lackluster performance," Coyne said. 
Coyne said she hopes to see the team improve mentally, an important aspect .she said her team was lacking in California. 
"We had costly mistakes that were pretty much self­imposed," she said. "It was more of our own mental errors that led to the loss." 
Given last week's perform­ance, it is easy to forget how tal­ented this team can be. Jillian Byers leads the Irish with 30 goals this season. In addition to Byers' top performance, six other Notre Dame players have earned 10 or more points on the season senior midfielder/attack Caitlin McKinney and freshman mid­fielder/attack Shaylyn BlanP: have each scored over 10 goals this season. The Irish also recorded a school record 22 goals in their season opening win over Canisius. Coyne said her team's performance is a matter of everything coming together at once. 


"I think we are a very good team. When we are on our game, I think we are very diffi­cult to beat," Coyne said. "It's just a matter of going out there and implementing the game­plan." 
So far, the team's greatest strength has been its offense. The Irish are currently averag­ing 15.33 goals per game, sec­ond in the Big East. 
"I think that we have multiple people that can score," Coyne said. "We have good team speed and I think we can move the ball well." 
The Irish kick off their three­game stand on Thursday against the Delaware Blue Hens. Delaware comes in with a 3-1 record, riding a two-game win streak. Coyne expects a very scrappy, physical game from the Blue Hens. But when asked what would make her happy with the homestand, Coyne was frank. 
''I'd like to go undefeated on the homestand," she said. The Irish face the Blue Hens at 3 p.m. today.

Earlier this week. Brey downplayed the fact that his team wouldn't know its oppo­nent until 24 hours before tip

"At this point in the year, I don't know how much scout­ing really does [matter!." he said. "I think the focus is on your group and how you play and you have prepared quiekly so many times at a walk through and shoot­around on Thursday, you can get mentally rnady to go." 
Instead. Brey, who was awarded Big East coach of the year Tuesday, said the extra rest will help his 
minute remaining to give the Irish a five-point lead they would not relinquish. 
Notrn Dame sophomore for­ward Luke Harangody will play his first game as reign­ing Big East Player of the Year Thursday. Harangody is the conference's leading scorer and rebounder with 
23.3 points and 11.3 rebounds per game in confer­ence play.

"I think we have great energy and great momen­tum," Brey said. "This group is really exeited. We're going in with a lot of juice." 
For the second time this season, Irish junior guard Kyle McAlarney will play in front of friends and family at Madison Square Carden. McAlarney. who grew up in Staten Island, scored 18 points in Notre Dame's last game in New York. a 68-59 win over Kansas Sate Dec. 4.

lead. 
Junior Kelcy Tefft and senior Brook Buck completed the dou­bles sweep as the No. 1 pair in the nation finished off their opponents, 8-6. 
In singles play, the Irish start­ed strong. Junior Katie Potts battled through a tough first set against Illinois' sophomore Kristina Minor. After starting 3­3, Potts took over the match, winning 6-4 in the first set. She carried her momentum to a 6-0 shutout in the second set to take the match. 
Ciobanu was firing on all cylinders for her match. After winning the first set 6-1, Ciobanu overcame a brief mid­set rally from junior Shivani Dave in the second and finished her match with a 6-2 victory. 
No. 39 Tefft kept her oppo­nent and one of Illinois' best singles players, freshman Leigh Finnegan, on the ropes all match long. She cruised to a 6­2, 6-1 win to clinch the match for Notre Dame. 

The fmal three matches went back-and-forth with the momentum changing sides throughout. 
Even with the win in hand, No. 113 Krisik made sure the Irish fmished strong. In a very even matchup, Krisik fought through a tough first set and outlasted senior Momei Qu in the second to win 7-5, 6-4. 
Rielley jumped out to a 3-0 lead in dominant fashion and won the first set 6-1. However, Illinois' freshman Marisa Labropoulos bounced back and played steady through the sec­ond set before putting Rielley away to win the mateh 6-4. 
Since the overall match was decided, the two played a tiebreak in place of a third set to decide their match. Labropoulos took the abbreviat­ed set 10-7, but her victory was the only point for Illinois. 
The toughest match of the day was between Notre Dame's Brook Buck and Illinois' sopho­more Megan Fudge. Up 6-5, Buck was one game away from winning the first set, but a series of long rallies and deuces ended up in Fudge's favor forc­ing a tiebreaker. 
Buck refocused and elevated her game to take the tiebreak 7-1. She won the second set 6­3 to make the final score for the match 6-1 in favor of the Irish. 
The match was a combination of tough, grind-it-out wins and convincing, dominant victories for Notre Dame. They contin­ued their dominance of doubles play and for the second straight match, dominated singles play as well. 
The two-game home stand for the Irish concludes with a match against Eastern Michigan on Friday at 4 p.m.

Notre Dame won its second match in a row with a dominant 6-1 victory over Illinois. 
The No. 61 lllini (5-5) came out swinging in doubles action. Illinois kept pace with No. 23 Notre Dame's (9-7) strong dou­bles pairs as all three matches began in a 4-4 tie. 
However, the Irish extin­guished the lllini's hot start. Notre Dame's No. 3 pair of soph­omores Cosmina Ciobanu and Colleen Hielley took four of the final five games en route to an 8­5 win, improving their record to 10-1 in the dual season. 
Sophomore Kali Krisik and freshman Kristen Rafael sewed up the doubles point for Notre Dame by sweeping the final four games of their match. Their 8-4 win made the score 1-0, and the Irish would not relinquish the

Youngsters take over top spots on team 
By KEN FOWLER Senior Spans Writer 
To eall it a youth movement would be something of an understatement. 
To call it a revival would be 
terribly misleading. 
To ignore it would be utterly 
ridiculous. 
Something in-between must describe the role of Notre Dame's freshman fencing class. Seven of the 12 Irish fencers are set to compete this week­end's NCAA Championships, hosted by Midwest nemesis Ohio State. 
The strange part of the pre­ponderance of Irish rookies is that Notre Dame didn't appear in a position that necessitated a major influx of talented fencers. A season ago, Notre Dame fin­ished fourth in the national event, and two of the team's four first-team All-Americans ­epeeist Kelley Hurley and foilist Adi Nott-would return for multiple future seasons. 
Meanwhile, six other fencers who made it to the national event sabreists Bill Thanhouser and Ashley Serrette, epeeists Greg Howard and Karol Kostka, and foilists Mark Kubik and Jakub Jedrkowiak-all returned. 
But the Irish got reinforee­ments anyway. Both Irish women's sabreists
