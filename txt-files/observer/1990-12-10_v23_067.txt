THE INDEPENDENT NEWSPAPER SERVING NOTRE DAME AND SAINT MARY'S 

Students congregate for peace in. campus protest 
By PETER AMEND 
News Writer 
Over fifty students congre­gated on Fieldhouse Mall on Friday, taking time out of their schedules to reflect on the pos­sibility of war in the Middle East. 
Seven speakers, including a faculty member, local activists and students from Notre Dame and Saint Mary's provided sev­eral different perspectives on the Middle East issue, with the unified message: prevention of war in the Gulf. 
David Cortright, visiting fac­ulty fellow at the Peace Institute, spoke of the situation in the context of history. "We are gathered here on this 49th anniversary of Pearl Harbor and our nation's entry into World War II to cry out for peace. . . It is fitting that we gather here near the war memorial, and that we pay tribute to the memory of those who have gone before us by struggling to preserve the peace for which they sacri­ficed." 
Graduate student Janet Meissner, the creator of the peace petition that is circulat­ing around campus, said an of­fensive U.S. attack would create further animosity among the Arab people toward the United States, making peaceful attempts at communication more difficult in the futum. 
As students carried signs reading "negotiation not insti­gation" and "Peace on Earth," student speakers addressed the Gulf crisis as an environmental issue that demands more re­search on alternative energy sources in order to break away from our dependence on for­eign oil.

INSIDE COLUMN 


The spirit of Christmas: a modern view 
In the spirit of Christmas, I've de­cided to downplay the following issues in the hopes that they may fix themselves without a great amount of fuss: 
The first is that the 
senior class officers 
have apparently done 

next to nothing in the Assoc. News Editor 
way of activities or special events. I see posters for every other class except for ours. VVhat do they do in that office? VVoodcarve? 
The second is the recurring ND bookstore legal robbery. VVhile buying necessities the other day, I picked up some deodorant a woman was shelving, noticing the three older price tags covered up. I picked at one, and the woman asked me what I was doing. I told her, and she responded, "That's okay. You won't be able to read the older prices anyway." VVhat happened to customer ser­vice? · Now then, in continuation of the afore­mentioned Christmas spirit, I'd like to make known to you a recent discovery from the Dead Sea scrolls, the Gospel according to Sham. The Immaculate Conception scenes read something like this: And in those days the Lord God sent his messenger the Angel Gabriel to a man who would be the foster father of the Son of the Most High, and Gabriel said, 
Greetings to you. line ofDavid. great king. I come to you now. for the message I bring is from God. If I may. where is your spouse? She'll soon have a child. Is she in the house? 
Joseph replied, 
A child? My spouse a she. you say? 
Both impossible. for my partner is gay, 
As am I. We live together in this 
House in a state of homosexual bliss. 
And lo! Gabriel was dumbfounded, for he had thought this was the Joseph he had been told to visit. He hoped that he had merely gotten the wrong address. And so Gabriel left, looking for a suitable couple for the birthing of the Son of Man. He found a woman of great courage and virtue whose name was Mary, and said to her, 
Hail to thee. Virgin, most favored one. 
To you soon will be born the Son 
OfGod. Great He will be. Jesus his name. 
Dreaming. your husband Joseph shall know the same. 
Mary replied, 
A son? What a joke! Oh. me you kill With your humor. Don't you know I'm on the pill? My boyfriend and I can't have children, I fear, If we did I would surely lose my career. 
Again Gabriel left, much confused, but still looking for the noble and holy couple willing to have the Christ Child. He didn't have much luck.

An Israeli soldier was killed and two were wounded when bombs exploded outside military headquarters in the occupied town of Bethlehem on Sunday, the third an­niversary of the Palestinian uprising. In other violence, an Arab was fatally shot as he tried to strangle an Israeli policeman and grab his rifle Sunday, the army said. Relatives saiQ. he was shot while standing at the door of his home. Soldiers also clashed with masked youths in the VVest Bank village of Bani Nairn, shooting one protester in the leg, the army said. Curfews confined more than a million Arabs to their homes in the occupied territories, some for the third straight day, in an army effort to quell violence on the anniversary of the intefadeh, or uprising. 
Police thought they had made the streets safer by taking away Gregor Hajek's driver's license. But the 29­year-old soldier was back on Vienna, Austria's streets hours later Sunday -with a tank. "I wanted to go home," Hajek told police shortly after climbing out of the M60 tank following a 35-mile drive from a town south of Vienna that ended near his parents home in the Austrian capital.En route the driver had tried to ram one squad car attempting to stop him, ignored several warnings to stop, and drove through a series of red lights. A police car, siren wailing to warn other drivers, had followed the tank on the last part of the journey.

INDIANA A large explosion rocked the Fort

VVISH television reported several people were taken to hospitals. An Associated Press photographer on the scene said the explosion occurred near an apartment house, which had been demolished. "One of the housing units looks completely demolished. It's flat," said Tom Stratman. Fire officials said a natural gas leak may have set off controversy.

ND Press book on Texas poor wins national award 
Special to The Observer 

A University of Notre Dame Press book, "Poorest of Americans: The Mexiean Americans of the Lower Hio Grande Valley of Texas" by Hobert Lee Maril, has been named one of the 1990 Outstanding Books on Human Hights by the Gustavus Myers Center for the Study of Human Hights in the United States. 
In his book, Maril, a faeulty member of Oklahoma University. uses statistical data to deseribn the plight of a community of people who "by almost every quantifiable measure which describes poverty" are poorer than those of any other region, rural or urban, in the nation. 
Examining the region's his­tory from Spanish eolonization to the present, he shows how the development of a two-class system has affected the Valley's political and economic development; how its powerful citizens maintain control over its vulnerable citizens through a pervasive system of patronage; and how the oppression has resulted in a two-tiered system of health care, education, employment and public services. 
The Gustavus Myers Center at the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville, Ark., was established "to identify, reward, and publicize outstanding books about all kinds of intolerance in the United States." Each January, publishers nationwide nominate books published the preceding year, and the winners are announced on Dec. 10, Human Rights Day. 
The Center is named in honor of the author of a 1943 book titled "The History of Bigotry in the United States." Myers intended his book to be "a realistic narrative of the origins and course of bigotry in the United States," which opposed the notion that bigotry in the U.S. was "spasmodic, having its oc­casional flashes and then seeming to subside, and in no ways significant or affright­ing." Instead, he wrote, "the facts show the smoldering, distorted views of a mass of people blindly ready to follow a leader as often as the propi­tious occasion presents itself." 
Sponsoring organizations for the Gustavus Myers Center for the Study of Human Rights in the United States include B'nai B'rith, the Fellowship of Reconciliation, Free Inquiry magazine, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, and Project Censored.

Hostages call release 'miracle' 
BAGHDAD,Iraq tAP)-"I am stunned and still cannot believe it, it seems like a miracle," said Lyonell Hoffman, 51, of Melbourne, Fla., in Baghdad. He worked as a contractor in Kuwait before Iraq's invasion and had hidden out since then. 
U.S. officials said they planned to charter another flight in three or four days to evacuate the rest of the esti­mated 750 Americans in Iraq and Kuwait. 
Other flights being arranged included British charters to leave Monday and Tuesday to London, and a flight to Moscow, possibly Sunday night. Airport sources also said hundreds of Vietnamese workers were at the airport awaiting departure. 
The first foreigners to leave Baghdad under the decree is­sued by Saddam last week were a group of about 200 hostages, mostly Italians, who arrived in Rome on Sunday aboard an Italian-chartered jet. 
In addition to the Italians, the flight also carried Dutch, British, Australian, Irish and Finnish citizens, the Italian Foreign Ministry officials said. 
Western diplomats com­plained that Iraqi authorities bad thrown up some last­minute bureaueratic roadblocks to the exodus. 
For example, foreigners in ci­ties other than Baghdad were told they must obtain exit visas from those cities. Those who had been under work contracts were told that Iraqi law re­quires them to present a letter releasing them from their obli­gations. 
Iraq has refused U.S. requests to waive visa requirements for freed hostages, and the processing of the visas alone had been expected to delay some departures for days. 
However, diplomats said Iraqi officials were working quickly Sunday, processing an estimated 80 exit visas an hour. One diplomat said that it nor­mally takes up to half an hour to process a single exit visa. 
"They clearly have a different set of instructions now," said the diplomat. 

1\venty-one former American hostages landed in Houston early Sunday after flying out of Baghdad a day earlier aboard a jet chartered by former Treasury Secretary John Connally, who was in Iraq on a private hostage-freeing mission. 
DWI victim challenges 'estimator' device 
KOKOMO, Ind. (AP) -It's called an estimator, but Eugene Bradley says the alcohol detec­tion device isn't even close. 
Bradley, who was arrested for drunken driving in August, is trying to get his case dismissed because he claims state police entrapped by giving him a faulty estimator. 
The device is designed to let drinkers know when they be­come legally intoxicated. But Bradley says when he used the device after having five beers over two hours at a Kokomo tavern it gave him the OK. 
"The device gives you the idea that you can drink more
. 
than you actually can," said Bradley's attorney, Robert Caravelli of Kokomo. 
Bradley, a 42-year-old con­struction worker, argues that he used the device to estimate his blood-alcohol content and paced his consumption accord­ingly. 
Unfortunately, Bradley says he was unaware that both . the state police and the Governor's Task Force to Reduce Drunk Driving had discredited the de­vice. 
About 44,000 estimators dis­tributed statewide were re­called because of inaccurate

readings. Many were returned or destroyed, but many were not. And police did not gener­ally publicize the problem with the estimator. 
"Nobody ever notified us of any recall," Caravelli said. 
In addition to seeking dis­missal of the case, Caravelli is asking the,judge to order the state police to publicize the fact that the devices are inaccurate. 

State police spent around $9,000 for 44,000 of the blood­alcohol content estimators in 1987, according to State Police Maj. Jack. Martin, the depart­ment's legal adviser. 
Martin said the state police are not exactly sure of the date whe11 they learned the devices were faulty. 
"One of our chemists in our laboratory brought to our at­tention that this estimator might not be totally accurate. Based upon that, we recalled all the ones we had out at the (state police) districts and de­stroyed them," Martin said. 
But he said the state police didn't feel any need to make any public announcement about the reported inaccuracy of the device. Martin said the public affairs officers in all of Indiana's state police posts were notified of the problem and were directed to collect them. 
The device is a cardboard wheel mounted on cardboard that allows people to match their weight with alcohol con­sumed. By matching the num­bers, the device is supposed to provide an estimate of the per­son's blood-alcohol content.

Walesa wins big in Poland 
WARSAW, Poland (AP) -Lech Walesa, the shipyard worker who helped lead his country out of Communism, swept to a laudslide victory in Poland's first popular presidential vote Sunday, according to exit polls. 
Walesa defeated emigre busi­nessman Stanislaw Tyminski, a virtual unknown before the campaign, by a margin of 77 percent to 23 percent, accord­ing to an exit survey of 22,500 voters at 303 representative

polling stations nationwide. 
"There are terribly difficult tasks waiting for us," a smiling but serious Walesa said as he sipped a congratulatory glass of champagne before the televi­sion cameras and adoring sup­porters in Gdansk, where his Solidarity movement began. 
"I hope that we will be build­ing Poland's future together. I want to behave firmly, I want to firmly correct everything that is wrong, and make firm accounts for everything that has not been accounted for yet." 
Tyminski declined to concede defeat immediately, saying he did not trust the polls. He said he would remain active in Polish politics. 
Outgoing President Wojciech Jaruzelski, who sent Walesa to jail under martial law nine years ago, sent his congratula­tions. He wished the new presi­dent ''fruitful activity for the good of our homeland."

Food for troops saves businesses 
EVANSVILLE, Ind. (AP) ­Two Evansville businesses that faced lean times this summer are in the middle of an unex­pHcted boom thanks to hungry soldiers serving in Operation Dnsert Shield. 
Companies that make MREs, or Meals Ready to Eat, have benefited from increasnd de­mand for military ration kits, including $31.7 million in con­tracts announced this week. 
"We wt~re looking at a very bleak future,'' said John Net­tMberg, president of Shelf Stabln Foods. "The government has told us war rnservns were largn and the budget was tight. .. 
Shdf Stable Foods planned to lay off about 150 of its 280 workers before the Persian Gulf crisis began, Netterberg said. Tlw company now plans to add 30 or 40 workers, he said. 
AmeriQual Foods Inc. wasn't planning layoffs. But the com­pany has hired about. 100 workers since September, dou­bling its work force. 
At least 75 of those workers were added because of the in­creased military demand, said company Vice President Don Rupprecht. AmeriQual, which also makes commercial mi­crowave dinners, plans no more hiring at this time, he said. 
The companies are two of about six in the United States that make MREs for the mili­tary. 
Before the Persian Gulf crisis, the Pentagon had told the com­panies to expect cuts of 27 per­cent to 30 percent in their regu­lar contracts. 
Procurements would not have been enough to keep all of the MRE companies in business, Netterberg said. 
Now it is uncertain whether the companies can keep up with the demand, Rupprecht said. "It's going to be rough,'' he said. 
"This involves a lot of over­time, a lot of inefficiencies," Rupprecht said. "We have to do a very careful ma"agement to make any money on this." 
Under the new c·ontractsb AmeriQual will make 22 million MREs for $26.4 million, accord­ing to Lorraine Netzko, spokeswoman for the Defense Personnel Support Center. 
Shelf Stable Foods will make 4 million MREs for $5.3 million, she said. The company also will benefit as a subcontractor for an assembly contract expected to be awarded its sister .com­pany, RAFCO of McAllen, Texas, Ms. Netzko said. 
Shelf Stable Foods' MREs will be included in combat ration kits assembled by RAFCO, which also will include other foods such as crackers, cheese, coffee mix and gum. 
Ms. Netzko said the military sends more than 1 million one­day ration kits to U.S. troops in the Persian Gulf each month. The kits contain several MREs. 
In recent years, the Pentagon bought 323.5 million MREs a year, she said. The military ex­pects to buy six times that number in 1991, Ms. Netzko said, and more may be needed. 

presently occurring in Hungary. He said that many social and economic barriers exist against Hungary's attempts to move towards a market economy. 
Bruszt likened Hungary's problems to making fish soup. He mused: "It is very easy to transform an aquarium into fish soup. After the fish soup, it is not so easy to get the aquar­ium again." He feels that although dissolving markets under communism was fairly easy, their re-creation will be much more difficult. 
Hungary faces three major problems, according to Bruszt. The first problem is financial indebtedness, which Bruszt puts as the largest in the re­gion. The second is the mainte­nance of social and political stability as free markets form. "Creating competition and a class of owners could be a source of strife,': he said. The third and largest problem for Bruszt, is the lack of capital to drive economic growth. 
Bruszt offered some solutions. He feels that some social problems, deriving from capi­talism, will eventually evapo­some of the problems facing that country. The two greatest difficulties he noted are envi­ronmental problems and the lack of what he called "the cul­ture of the market." 
Scully said that the pollution problems in all the urban areas he visited were terrible. As proof, he offernd the fact that "after only five minutes of jog­ging, I experienced a great deal of difficulty breathing." He ar­gued that this legacy of Leninist communism provides strong evidence against the environ­mental theories that more gov­ernment and less markets solve pollution problems. 
lie also noted that although competition exists in every soci­ety, personal competition and wide scale market competition do not always fall hand in hand. He mentioned the lack of a commitment to service for the consumer. Scully said "I went to a barber and they treated me as though I was causing them an-inconvenience." He argued the Poland neednd to develop a "culture of the market" before capitalism could really work in that society.

Student input needed to change registration 
The process of selecting classes and registering for 
them is never an easy one. This year, more than ever, it 
became obvious that the registration process needs to be 
improved. 

As students, it is not only our responsibility but our 
right to see that changes are made to improve the 
process. We are paying dearly for a quality education; 
problems that prevent the University from delivering that 
quality need to be rectified. 

We need to take an active role in improving our reg­
istration process. Everyone complains about registration: 
DART has its faults, there aren't enough classes or there 
aren't enough professors. If all we do is sit around and 
complain, we're wasting our tuition money. 
If you've had problems with DART, write a letter to the 
Registrar. Are you short on classes? Talk to your 
department chairman. Do you think we need more 
professors? Write the Provost. The only way we're going 
to prevent registration from continuing to be the debacle 
that it was this year is to give the Administration our 
input and recommend the needed changes. 
Last Wednesday, Student Government sponsored an 
open forum on the problems of the registration process. 
Daniel Winicur, dean of administration and Registrar, 
Michael Loux, dean of the College of Arts and Letters, 
and Bob Williamson, associate dean of Business 
Administration, were present to hear student's input on 
the problems of registration. Only eight students showed 
up to voice their concerns. 

If registration is to be improved, we, as students, need 
to show more interest than we did on Wednesday. We 
need to go to these forums. We need to write more 
letters. We need to let the Administration know that we 
expect more from them for the $15,000 a year we are 
paying. 

In our society, when someone buys a $15,000 car, they 
expect it to work. If there is something wrong with the 
car, you can be sure that the owner will raise a fuss__:and 
keep doing so until the car is fixed. Our education is that 
$15,000 car, and it is obvious that our car isn't working 
the way it should. The question is, do we make sure that 
it is fixed or do we just learn to live with the defects? The 
answer should be obvious.

U.S. quick fix is unavailable in Kuwait 
Dear Editor: 
It was with much dismay that I read Rich Kurz' Inside Column, "U.S. takes right position in Gulf Crisis" (The ·Observer, Nov. 29). Mr. Kurz states that the true intent of Operation Desert Shield is to free "a small, helpless country which cannot defend itself, and to keep an evil dictator from 
having the world in his hands." 
As a senior government and 
international studies major with 
a concentration in the Middle 
East, I can tell you the reason 
we are there is quite different. 
This year I am working on a 
senior essay concerned with a 
strategic energy policy and the 
effect of recent developments in 
the Middle East concerning this. 
First of all, for the past 15 or 20 
years we have had no strategic 
energy policy and have given 
very little effort to creating 
alternate energy sources and 
uses. 
Every book and article I read 
convinces me more that the 
main reason we are in the 
Middle East right now is to save 
ourselves, economically, from 
near-complete devastation 
because our government has been totally irresponsible with our energy needs. 

If Saddam Hussein ruled a poor, resourceless country in middle Africa somewhere and he took over a small neighbor and committed all sorts of atrocities, would we be there on his border with 500,000 
.. troops? I think not. If I offered a,. similar example in Far East Asia, where we have few energy interests. would he send troops? I think not. 
Mr. Kurz asks, "What kind of hypocrite would the United States be if we promised that (the right to life. liberty, and the pursuit of happiness) to our own people, but didn't care about the rights of any other country?" The U.S. has been hypocritical concerning these principles on numerous occasions--just read a history book. 
When issues have clear and identifiable truths to them. truths that don't fit our particular political taste or the fad of the moment, we feel a need to justify and rationalize away positions. If one fulfills his patriotic duty by mimicking George Bush word for word, then that is his prerogative; true patriotism, however, will look inward and ask, "How could we have avoided this? What can.we do to insure our security, not just quickly fix it?" 
I pray that the world community will continue th~ world embargo and isolation of Saddam Hussein for the heinous acts he has committed and that a peaceful solution is soon forthcoming. I pray that our present leaders will become responsible policy makers with regard to future energy policies and our related vulnerabilities. I also pray that, regardless M the media blitz and patriotic exhortations, people will be able to openly and truthfully admit why we go to war. 
Finally, I hope Mr. Kurz will quit deceiving himself and read up on why we are really risking the lives of 500,000 troops in the Middle East-for if the draft is instituted, he may just have to die for it.

Dear Editor: 
The 1991 Iceberg Debates 
.standing Committee urges stu­dents to participate in the Iceberg Debates. The event is a campus-wide undergraduate debate series which began in 1989 to further intellectual life and the discussion of social jus­tice issues within the Notre Dame community. The emphasis is on values 

and ideas which are intended to inform the participants, as well as the spectators. Judging is based upon the debaters agility to communicate and argue logically, rather than the speed of his or her presentation. 
Therefore. absolutely no previous debate experience is necessary. In fact, novices in the past have been quite successful at defeating even well-versed debaters. We encourage anyone interested to sign up with his or her hall president by Dec. 11.

Student's death becomes gift of life 
Steve Saunders' parents donate ~is organs 
By SHONDA WILSON 
Assistant Accent Editor 
The tragedy of the death of Steve Saunders, a former Notre Dame freshman, did not end there, but served as a gift of life for another individual. 
Graduating from Aquinas High School as valedictorian of his cJass, Saunders' career at Notre Dame was cut short. In a single-car accident during the summer of 1989, the 19-year­old lost out on all of his hope,

-his dreams, and his life. When the specialists of Uni­versity of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics determined that Saun­ders' brain was no longer functioning, Carl and Susan Saunders, the parents of the victim, decided that organ do­nation was the only thing for them to do. 
"When they came in and told us the results of their testing and our alternatives, they men­tioned organ donation," says according to a letter sent to the '11t was just so cleansing. I had Susan.

Saint Mary's basketball falls to Indianapolis for 3d straight loss 
By CHRIS BACON 
Saint Mary's Sports Editor 
The difficulties continued as the Saint Mary's basketball team dropped its third game in 
a  row  Saturday  night  at  
Division  II  University  of  
Indianapolis, 94-65.  

The Belles were playing with­out the assistance of two of its players, sophomore Kristen Crowley and senior Linda Garrett. Crowley is out with a back problem and Garrett is out for health reasons. Belles head coach Marv Wood is uncertain when they'll return. 
The team felt the two players' absence as it watched its deficit increase. In the first half, the two teams played evenly. Shooting 39 percent from the field compared to Indianapolis' 42 percent, the Belles trailed 29-25 with three minutes re­maining in the half. But Indianapolis's fast-break over­powered the team as it exe­cuted a 13-2 run. Indianapolis lnd 42-27 at the half. 
"Things were looking good for us," said Wood, " but then they blitzed us." 
In the second half, the blitz continued. Offensively, the Belles committed costly turnovers and were unable to nxecute thnir shots. Indianapolis capitalized on the Bellns' weaknnsses and widnned its lnad. 
"In the sncond half we got bnhind by 27 points. At that point I just dncided to play the bench and give them some playing time," ~aid Wood. "They didn't play bad. but. they are 
For Belles' swim team, success comes vs. Albion

Success comes in many forms. 
For the Saint Mary's swimming team, success came at its first dual meet of the season. In Friday night's meet at home. the Belles captured first place in six individual races to defeat Albion .College 13 7-103. starting the season ofT on a winning track for the second season in a row. 
Sophomore Chris Smiggen, a double individual winner in the meet. led the way for the Belles. Smiggen claimed vic­tories in both the 1000-yard freestyle and 100 butterfly. 
Freshman Jennifer Gustafson captured the 100 backstroke and sophomore Bethany Thompson claimed victory in the 500 free, while senior captain Toni Olivieri won the 100 free. 
"I swam well. It was a good race, " said Olivieri, " but, I still need to improve it more." 
Junior All-American diver Carrie Cummins captured first in the 3-meter and second in the 1-meter dives. 
"Albion has really good divers, especially for its (small) size," said Cummins. "I've been working of my 1­meter dive. It has become more consistent; it's really improved." 
Belles head coach Dennis Cooper is pleased with the Belles first performance in the dual season. 
"I thought we swam very well and we had some sur­prise swims from a couple of swimmers." he said. "It's a nice way to start out our dual meet season."

secutive points to pull within four at 75-71 with 7:55 left. 
They trailed just 79-75 with 
6:00 left and Ellery at the line attempting a three-point play. He missed the shot, and Jon Ross was called for a question­able offensive goaltending that negated a Notre Dame basket that would have cut the margin to two. 
UCLA then scored seven of the next 10 points to take an 86-78 advantage, but the Irish fought back again to pull within 90-86 with 49 seconds remaining. Darrick Martin and Mitchell Butler hit four straight free throws to put the game out of reach. 
"They gave us a chance," Phelps said. " We just didn't get it done." 
Said UCLA coach Jim Harrick, "I watched all seven Notre Dame games on tape and this is the best they've played by far this year. They answered everything we gave them, but then we answered, too." 
Notre Dame took a 12-11 lead just six minutes into the contest when Bennett hit a jumper from the right baseline, but UCLA answered with nine of the next 14 points to take a 20-17 advantage. 
The Bruins turned that three-point lead into a 27-17 advantage midway through the first half, thanks to the play of guard Shon Tarver. He came ofT the bench to score seven straight points to ignite that run. 
The Bruins controlled the re­mainder of the first half, lead­ing 53-40 at the intermission. Tarver finished the half with 12 points on 5-of-7 shooting. 
NOTES-UCLA is now 6-0, its best start since the 1982-83 season when the Bruins also won their first six games... .This is the first time that Notre Dame has lost six games in a row since 1971-72, Digger Phelps's first year as head coach at Notre Dame....This was just the second Bruin win against the Irish in the past seven games. UCLA leads the all-time series 23-16....Don MacLean has now scored 30 or more points six times in his ca­reer....Ellis had five blocked shots....The Irish will host Southern Cal on Wednesday fn the Joyce ACC. 
smaller in size and Indianapolis has the depth." 
Junior Janet Libbing led the Belles efforts with 12 points and 11 rebounds. Sophomore Julie Snyder tallied eight points and seven rebounds and sophomore Kim Holmes added eight points and six points. Juniors Annie Hartzel and Catherine Restovich had seven and six points, respectively. 
Senior Mea Tetonborn tallied six points, three assists and six rebounds. 
Overall, the Belles shot 34 percent from the field, 73 per­cent from the line and commit­ted 28 turnovers. Indianapolis (6-1) shot 51 percent from the field, 62 percent from the line and committed 22 turnovers.

remaining, but scored nine straight points to cut the lead to four. They also trailed 86-78 and UCLA had the ball with just over four minutes left, but scored eight of the next 12 points to make it another four-point game. 

That Notre Dame didn't give up might say a little bit more than meets the eye. This isn't a team that is ready to call it quits just because of some early-season adversity. There are too many games against too many big teams. 
"We're a close, tight-knit group," said Elmer Bennett, who scored 19 points. "We're not going to give up on each other. If everybody else gives up on you. you need each other. That was our sixth loss in a row, but we played great. We were at a top-10 school on their home court. We'll learn a lot from this. We're getting closer to where we can be as a team." 
Said Irish forward LaPhonso Ellis, "It snowed we have a lot of guts. When it seems like we're out of a game, we can make a lot of things happen." 

The key for Notre Dame now is to keep playing great in its next three games, all home games against USC. Portland and Valparaiso. Those are also games that the Irish need to win, tf only to learn how to win. 
Ellis was standing a few lock­ers down from Bennett. Ellis reflected for awhile on what was his best inside game so far this season, but he quickly turned to the thought that was in the back of everyone's mind. 
"We're still searching for that 'W,"' he said. "We just have to go out and play non-top 25 teams like we play do top 25 teams." 
The Irish will get that chance on Wednesday with USC.

Men's swimming defeats Bowling Green, women fall 
Tanya Williams continued to shine for the Irish, setting two university records in the 100 and 200 backstrokes with win­ning times-58.43 and 2:05.78. Williams also won the 200 indi­vidual medley~ 
Jenny KipP.r.took firsts in 1­meter and 3-meter diving while Alicia Feehery won the 50 and 100 freestyles. Distance swim­mers Karen Keeley and Susan Bohdan placed first and second, respectively, in the 1000 free. 
Welsh emphasized the success and growth of the women's team, which climaxed this fall by winning the National Catholic Championships last week. The Irish will train for a month before their nexrmeet, The New Year's Classic in Boca Raton, Fla. Welsh says he's ex­cited to train and feels there is still something left to be done.

After averaging almost six points a game through the Stanford game, sophomore point guard Coquese ·Washington has scored only four points in the past two con­tests. Washington, however, is not worrying about her offen­

"The other four starters are 
very good scorers, and I don't

Thn Notre Dame men's swim team capped its fall season Saturday at Holfs aquatic Center, defeating Bowling Green 139.5-95.5. The Irish men looked remarkably fresh only a week after three intense days of National Catholic Championships competition. 
"Our men were able to re­bound from the NCC meet by exeeptional depth," said !lead Coaeh Tim Welsh. "The fresh­men who couldn't swim in the NCC meet, due to squad size limits, earried the day." 
Freshmen Bruce Emery, Tom Byorick, Kevin Flanagan and Brian Casey added to the total team depth and team balance that led to a relaxed second half of the meet. In the 50 and 200 frcestyles the Irish elaimed plaens one, two and three to in­crease their lead by over 30 points after the fourth event. 
Emery won the 200 individual medley and the 200 breast­stroke, while Sean Hyer also recorded double wins in the 1­meter and 3-meter diving. Sophomore Tom Whoell set a university record in the tOO­backstroke leg of the 400-yard medley relay. Colin Cooley, Ed Broderick, and Dave Nathe also swam on the winning relay. 
Nathe plaeed first in both the 50 freestyle and the 500 free-an impressive time of 
4:39.50 in an event he tlid not swim at the NCC meet last week. Jim Birmingham won the 200 free in 1 :43.04 
"The Bowling Green men are still rebuilding and although their freshmen swam very well, the team as a whole doesn't have the team depth ·the women's team has," said Welsh. "Our men demonstrated outstanding balance." · 
The Irish men came close to several NCAA cuts this fall and

Welsh said he looks forward to a great remainder of the sea­son. 
The Notre Dame women's swim team suffered its first loss on Saturday against Bowling Green, 143-157. 
The Irish rebounded from early deficits of two to 15 points to take the lead in the middle of the meet by as many as 14 points. Despite winning nine of 16 meet events the Irish were unable to win a relay and score the winning points. 

The Irish needed a first and third in either relay to win the meet or a first in a relay to tie the meet. Bowling Green cap­tured firsts and thirds in both the 400-yard medley relay and the 400-freestyle relay, an indi­cation of strong team depth. 
''I'm very satisfied with ho'w well the women came back after three intense and emo­tional days of competition last week in the National Catholic Championships;" said Welsh. "We knew ahead that Bowling Green had depth. We weren't able to overcome their depth." 
"We moved Tanya out of her normal butterfly events to backstroke to challenge Bowling Green's lead backstro­ker. It worked well but we couldn't overcome their depth," said Welsh.

Hockey splits with Foresters in home-and-home set 
By DAVE MCMAHON 
Sports Writer 
Mter Division III power Lake Forest College snapped the Notre Dame hock~ team's six game winning stKtJak Friday night by a 3-2 score on its home ice, the Irish returned to the friendly confines of the Joyce ACC Saturday and cruised to a 6-0 win, gaining a split with the Foresters for the home-and­home series. 
At Lake Forest on Friday, the Irish jumped out to a quick 1-0 lead, as junior Pat Arendt scored at the 4:21 mark of the opening period on an assist from  defenseman Rob Copeland. Despite outshooting the Foresters 18-3 in the open­ing period, the Irish could get only one shot past goalie Dan Vacco. 
"He won the game for them," said Schafer. "We outshot them about two to one for the game, so it wasn't poor playing on our part, but rather a great effort by their goalie." 
Both teams were held score­less until Notre Dame sopho­more Dan Sawyer scored his third goal of the season, putting the Irish on top 2-0 four and half minutes into the second period. , 
The scoring ended there for the Irish, now 1-5-1 in away games. 
Lake Forest retaliated with two goals of its own in the sec­ond period, tying the game at two only minutes after the Irish had established a 2-0 lead. 
"Things just really weren't happening for us," said junior left wing Mike Curry. "They're always ready to play us and they came out and played a great game." 

In the midst of an eight-game win streak, the Foresters bene­fitted from yet another standout performance by Vacco. 
"He (Vacco) came up really big in the third period," said Irish left wing Lou Zadra. "He had some outstanding saves." 
The Foresters evened the series at 8-8 in games played at Lake Forest when Rob Ventura knocked in the game-winner with nine minutes left. 
Saturday brought a com­pletely different look for the Irish, however, as Zadra scored two power play· goals en route to a 6-0 win, improving the Irish to 8-6-1 heading iil.to a holiday roadtrip against such powerhouses as New Hampshire and Boston College. 
Zadra, who leads the Irish with ten goals, scored the first of three first period goals for the Irish at the 5:33 mark of the opening stanza, taking a rifling pass from center Dave Bankoske. Only 45 seconds later, sophomore Sterling Black tipped in a pass from freshman Matt Osiecki to put the Irish ahead 2-0. 
"We seemed to be a little slow in Friday's game, so we wanted to go out and show everyone that we're capable of beating them," said Osiecki. 
Sophomore Dan Sawyer nabbed his third goal of the season on 5-on-3 power play goal. Taking a pass from center Curtis Janicke, Sawyer blasted a slapshot past Vacco with 7:17 remaining in the first period. 
The Irish continued to take advantage of power play op­portunities in the second pe­riod, as Zadra scored on a power play goal off another as­sist from Bankoske, who leads the Irish with 11. 
"We had been working on the ­power play all week in practice, and Bankoske hit me with two great passes," said Zadra, who had two goals against Lake Forest last season. "It was good to see some results." 
Left wing Chris Olson scored his second goal of the season on an assist from Janicke at the 
3:42 mark of the second period. Junior Mike Curry put the finishing touches on the Irish win with a third-period goal, his ninth of the season. 
"We knew we were the better team and we came out on Saturday and showed it," said Curry. 
The Irish were also a more penalty-stricken team Saturday, with 15 calls going against them. Osiecki, who spent eight minutes in the box on four penalties, wasn't too thrilled about some of the calls. 

"They called some pretty The Observer 1Scott McCann cheap stuff," said Osiecki. "It's The Notre Dame hockey team is 1-5-1 in games away from home. not my role to be the goon of -------------------------....,


the team, so I wasn't out there trying to be more physical than I normally would be." 
"Luckily they didn't do to well on the power play," said Curry. "Having that many penalties could be costly against some of the better teams we'll be play­ing." 
The "better teams" are up next for the Irish, with games at Princeton, Army, New Hampshire, and Boston College over Christmas break. 
"Princeton and Army promise to be on the sante level of play with us, but we'lL be playing two of the best hockey teams in the nation in New Hampshire and Boston College," said Schafer.

Notre Dame limps to defeat against UCLA at Pauley 
Despite solid play, 2-6 Irish are put to rest by 6-0 Bruins 
By GREG GUFFEY 
Sports Editor 

LOS ANGELES-When Notre Dame 'limped into Pauley Pavilion Saturday fo face eighth-ranked UCLA with a five-game losing stre~k and minus its senior captain, most people expected a scene like the 91-61 loss to Arizona in the semifinals of the Dodge NIT. 
But the Irish, who have gen­erally played well against tough UCLA teams, put together one of their best efforts of the sea­son before falling to the Bruins 99-91. UCLA improved to 6-0, while Notre Dame dropped to 2-6. 
"A lot of people didn't think we would hang tough for 40 minutes," Notre Dame coach Digger Phelps said. "I was very proud of what we did. We played extremely well against UCLA." 
The Irish played for the sec­ond consecutive game without senior point guard Tim Singleton, who will miss up to six weeks after injuring his back against Kentucky in the Big Four Classic Dec. 1. They had already lOBt starting for­ward Monty Williams to a heart problem before the season started. 
But they still played well enough to have a shot at upsetting the undefeated Bruins. Notre Dame committed a season-low 14 turnovers and shot 57 percent from the field in turning its game up a notch. 
"The only thing I can say is that we played a heck of a game," said Irish forward LaPhonso Ellis. "We went out and put a lot of things to­gether." 
Ellis led a balanced Notre Dame effort, scoring 21 points on 9-of-10 shooting. Daimon Sweet, Elmer Bennett and Kevin Ellery had 19 points each. Don Maclean led UCLA with 30 points, while Tracy Murray chipped in 18. 
Notre Dame had its chances in the second half. The Irish trailed 75-62 with 10:36 re­maining but scored nine con-

Irish stop Orangewoman rally 
Women's basketball team gets key 71-66 home win 
By RENE FERRAN 
Sports Writer 

The Notre Dame women's basketball team snapped its three-game losing streak, withstanding a late Syracuse charge to defeat the Orangewomen 71-66 Saturday afternoon in the Joyce ACC. 
After Margaret Nowlin's short jumper pushed the Irish lead to 10, Syracuse quickly went on a 9-2 run-capped by Erin Kenneally's steal and layup-to cut the margin to 61-58 with 5:39 left. 
The Irish rose to the chal­lenge. Senior All-American candidate Ka.ren Robinson buried an 18-footer from the top of the key, and then Notre Dame forced a 30-second violation by the Orangewomen. 
Syracuse cut the lead back to four, but Robinson made two free throws. After an Orangewoman free throw, Robinson hit another jumper from the right baseline, and a minute later, Comalita Haysbert's nine-footer built the lead back to nine, 71-62, with 59 seconds remaining. 
Notre Dame got a scare with

Wrestlers shoot down Redbirds, cage Tigers 
By DAVE DIETEMAN 
Sports Writer 

The Notre Dame wrestling team opened its dual meet sea­son in impressive style this weekend. shooting down the Redbirds of Illinois State and caging the Missouri Tigers 22­15. 
The Irish took to the road Friday afternoon for their match with Illinois State, the first dual meet of the season for both teams. Notre Dame won the first two matches against the Redbirds en route to their victory.. 
On the day, Chris Jensen (118), Marcus Gowens (126), Mike Ahern (134), Jamie Boyd (142), Mark Gerardi (167), J.J.. McGrew and Chuck Weaver registered winning decisions. Steve King (190) battled Redbird Steve Hughes to a draw, while Todd Layton and Emil Soehnlen each suffered defeats. 
Notre Dame returned home to face the Missouri Tigers Sunday. Against the nascent Big Eight power, the Irish won six of the 10 matches. Steve King notched the quickest victory of the day as he took only thirty­five seconds to pin Doug Dunley. King's stunning win burst open a previously close match, as Notre Dame surged out to a 22-12 lead with one match remaining. 
"I knew that it would be tight," remarked Notre Dame head coach Fran McCann. "We won the close matches-we knew that we'd have to do that to win today. I'm very happy. We have five first-year kids and we can expect that every meet will be like this. We need a total team effort because we don't have lots of experience. The ex­perienced guys must get the big points for us. Missouri felt that they could beat us, and right­fully so. They were beating us early, but we came back." 
Missouri jumped out to an early 3-0 lead, as Sam Henson, ranked sixth in the nation, won a 9-3 decision over Irish fresh­man Chris Jensen at 118 pounds. "I'm pleased with the way Chris Jensen performed," said McCann. "The kid from Missouri was a redshirt fresh­man." 
Notre Dame, meanwhile, quickly tied up the meet, as ju­nior Marcus Gowens opened up a scoreless match, outscoring Eric DeVenney 3-1 in the third period. 
Yet in the 134 pound match, the Tigers seemed to seize the edge, as Kenny Liddell, already leading Mike Ahern of Notre Dame, registered a pin of Ahern. Coach McCann,
