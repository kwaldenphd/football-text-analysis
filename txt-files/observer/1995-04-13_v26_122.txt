Anniversary of polio vaccine celebrated 
By DAVID GOODMAN 
Associated Press 
DETHOIT 
Forty years after he an­nounced his discovery of the first successful polio vaccine, lir. Jonas Salk returned to the University of Michigan to be honored for his triumph over the once dreaded disease. 
Tlw university and the March of Dimes. which paid the $1.7 million cost of Salk's polio re­search. honored the researcher today at the Hackham Auditorium on the Ann Arbor campus. It was there, in 1955, that Salk announced a success­ful trial of the vaccine. 
Polio struck 57,600 Americans in 1952, killing thousands and leaving many others paralyzed. 
Fearful parents once kept their children indoors to avoid exposure to the virus. 
In 1953, Salk announced the development of a vaccine that used killed viruses to stimulate people's immune systems. 
He, his wife and three sons received an injection of the vac­cine, as did 1.8 million school ehildren in a 1954 trial of the drug. 
On April 12, 1955, Salk an­nounced that the trial found the vaccine to be safe and effective. llealth officials quickly began inoculating millions of people, and the threat faded. 
"What had the most profound effect was the freedom from fear," the 80-year-old Salk said Tuesday in a telephone confer­ence call from Ann Arbor. 
A rival, Dr. Albert Sabin, later developed an oral vaccine that used weakened, rather than killed, viruses. 
Beginning with its introduc­tion in 1961, the oral vaccine quickly eclipsed Salk's formula. 
Congress honored Salk with a gold medal for "great achieve­ment in the field of medicine." 
The March of Dimes an­nounced today that it was cre­ating an annual $100,000 prize to be presented in Salk's name to an investigator who makes major advances in developmen­tal biology. 
"This prize honors the ex­traordinary contribution made by Dr. Jonas Salk to the health of children and adults here in the United States and around the world," March of Dimes President Dr. Jennifer Howse said in a statement. "Millions of people were saved from paraly­sis or death." 
Salk went on to found the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla, Calif., in 1963. 
His research on prevention of viral diseases continued after he stepped down as institute director in 1975. In 1986, he began AIDS research. 
"It's a more complex prob­lem, it's a different kind of threat," he said. 
"Polio cripples limbs, and the AIDS virus cripples the immune system, thus rendering people susceptible to all kinds of infec­tions." 
In the late 1980s, Salk an­nounced some positive results with a vaccine designed to slow the development of AIDS in those already infected with the HIV virus. 
Hesearchers are "on the threshold of large-scale stud­ies" of the vaccine, Salk said. 
Salk said he is optimistic sci­entists will crack the secrets of AIDS and other diseases caused by microorganisms. 
"My own view is we will over­come. We will have enough in­genuity to overcome these threats of nature," he said. 
"I am a perennial optimist," he said. "We certainly have the knowledge. The question is whether we have the wisdom."

The new student government wants to hear from you. 
In an effort to improve com­munication with the student body, student government is encouraging students to voice their concerns through e-mail, it was announced at last night's Student Senate meeting. 
According to the Jeff Ward, student government commis­sioner of Campus Communications, this improved communication will be insti­gated by way of an upcoming student government ad that will be placed in The Observer. The ad will ask students to respond through e-mail on two issues concflrning the move­ment of the student section in the football stadium and revi­sions in DuLac. 
Other issues addressed at the meeting included the distribu­tion of buttons reading, "We are all ND/SMC." According to student government Director of Publicity Louis Radkowski, the buttons are from both the past and present administrations of the Student Government. 
"The buttons specifically ad­dress the GLND/SMC issue, but they make the general com­ment about how as a communi­ty we have to embrace all of its (the Notre Dame and Saint Mary's communities') members as a whole," Radkowski said. 
The buttons will be available in the student government of­fice on the second floor of the LaFortune Student Center.

Dornan to seek White House 
By RITA BEAMISH 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON 
Bob Dornan once threw actor James Cagney over his back. He counted a nearly nude Mar­lon Brando for the 1960 Cen­sus. He bailed out of a fighter jet on a Pacific training flight and visited the pope with the wives of seven soldiers missing in Vietnam. 
And now the nine-term GOP congressman from southern California is running for presi­dent, bringing a firebrand style to a race already crowded with senators, governors and former White House officials. 
Dornan, 62, has so many col­orful stories -and recounts them with such rapid-fire glee -that it is easy to momentarily forget that he's also a man with missions: to eradicate "moral decay" and vanquish the Democratic president he labels a draft dodger. 
But he wears a prominent reminder -a watch with a cartoon of Clinton and a digital countdown to Election Day 1996. His sartorial arsenal also includes a prisoner-of-war bracelet for a man from Clin­ton's hometown of Hope, Ark. 
Often dismissed as a hothead for his railing from the House floor, Dornan believes he has a decent chance in a field already filled with conservatives. He says the others are either Johnny-come-latelies, are re­luctant to discuss the "moral is­sues," or do not have his track record on issues such as abor­tion. 

He wants sex education out of schools and homosexuals out of the military. Often accused of gay-baiting, he says AIDS is a great tragedy but that gay ac­tivists "have cleverly and skill­fully turned a modern plague that is baffiing us into a public

Sacred Heart wedding fiasco 

To be a bride in Sacred Heart has been a dream of mine since I was fifteen. When I became engaged to another Domer in September. we decided that the Basilica was the ideal location for our wed­ding. We even crashed 


two Sacred Heart wed-Kelly O'Neill dings to be sure. Assistant Office Manager
I called the church for information on booking a 1996 wedding. We could not reserve the church until March 6 at Bam. I talked to my rector and people at Campus Ministry to see if they could get us a date. My fiancee, Kevin, bought a tent and we planned on camping outside of the parish office in order to be first in line on March 6. We were told reservations could only be made over the phone on the assigned day. Our only option was to call at Bam with 500 other people. 
We had six months to plan phone strategy. I called the parish office several times to veri­fy the date, time, and phone number. I went over to the office to find out exactly what weekends in 1996 were available; while there, I set my watch to Basilica time. 
Kevin and I put together a list of our ideal wedding dates and times. We made 40 copies and distributed the lists to our friends and families. We gave them detailed instructions and all of our personal information. We even offered to take the caller who got through to brunch at Tippecanoe. 
As March 6 approached, I could not sleep, study, or concentrate. My whole family had nightmares about calling. Mom dreamed that she called and got through, but was told that only relatives of physicians could wed in Sacred heart. I imagined it would be like DART-"[funny noise]. June B. 3 o'clock. is closed. Please make another selection." 
On March 5, I was a basket case! I broke into tears several times and could think about nothing else. Kevin bought three dozen bagels to give to our friends who were calling for us. I called Sacred Heart information one last time to verify the phone number. I pro­grammed my phone (I'll never forget that number), practiced automatic redial, and tried the ring again function. Not only was I ready for Bam, I was a campus phone expert. 
I posted signs in my section, gave people reminder phone calls, and said a few prayers. We had callers in two time zones, four dorms, off campus, and four states. We were ready! 
I began calling at 7:55, and the lines were already busy. I alternated between the redial and program function. The busy signal was annoying; I never thought we'd get through. 
At B:15 my call was answered. We had over 30 callers, and I made the connection! I could barely talk. The man on the other end took my phone number and we began discussing dates. I was just about to get June 29 when we were disconnected. I panicked but remembered that he had taken my phone number. He called back and explained that some people have the operator do an emer­

Barker's harrassment suit dropped 
LOS ANGELES 
The "Price is Right" model who accused Bob Barker of forcing her to have sex with him said Wednesday she was dropping her lawsuit. In a state­ment issued by her attorney, Dian Parkinson said she stood by the law­suit's allegations but her doctor had advised her she wasn't physically strong enough to withstand the stress of pursu­


ing it. Barker's attorney said it was clear Parkinson had no case, adding that the game show host was considering suing her for malicious prosecution. "Bob Barker has beaten me into submission," Parkinson said in a statement released by her attorney, Howard Slotnick of New York. "As a single woman, I was no match for the power and resources of Bob Barker and (Mark) Goodson Productions, Inc." she said. Goodson produces the long-running CBS game show. Barker said he wouldn't sue if Parkinson would sign a statement admitting she wasn't sexually harassed. but Parkinson said she wouldn't do that. Barker, 71. has admitted he engaged in "hanky panky" with Parkinson from 19B9 to 1991 but said she initiated the relationship. 
Sweet 'N Low admits to illegal gifts 
NEW YORK 
Top officials of the company that makes Sweet 'N Low pleaded guilty Wednesday to funneling more than $200,000 in illegal contributions to political campaigns to try to head off a ban on saccharin, the sugar substitute's key ingredient. Among the recipients of the illegal largess were the presidential campaigns of Bob Dole in 19BB and George Bush in 1992, as well as campaigns by Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., former Sen. Uoyd Bentsen, D-Texas, and former Rep. Geraldine Ferraro. D-N.Y.. who ran for vice president in 19B4. There was no evidence that the law­makers or anyone on their campaign staffs were aware the contributions were illegal. prosecutors said. Cumberland agreed to pay a rme of $2 million, the u.s. attorney's office said. Other defendants face one to 20 years in prison and substantial rmes. 
Clinton drafting new secrecy rules 
WASHINGTON 
Trying to avert another spy scandal, the Clinton adminis­tration is ready to require nearly 3 million people with access to government secrets let investigators examine their bank statements, credit histories and foreign travel records. The draft presidential order also would. for the first time, prohibit the denial of security clearances solely because a federal or industry employee is homosexual or has had mental health counseling. Employee associations and legal groups praised the homosexual and mental health stands and the draft order's new appeal rights for employees denied clearances. But they were critical that there were not more safeguards and that some sensitive questions are being delegated to the little-known Security Policy Board. allegedly dominated by the CIA and military agencies. If signed as anticipated by President Clinton in the near future, it would implement the Intelligence Authorization Act enacted after last year's exposure of CIA official Aldrich Ames as a spy for Moscow. Before learn­ing secrets, military and civilian federal workers a~d employees of defense contractors would have to agree m writing that investigators could -without telling them ­examine their rmancial and travel records held by banks, credit agencies and corporations.

Two of the Chinese fled back to China after the incident, and the third was wounded and taken to the border post, ITAR-Tass said. Poaching is a growing problem in the Russian Far East's thick forests. known as the taiga. Russian authorities have cited a growing number of illegal border crossings by Chinese in search of rare plants and animals, from tigers to ginseng. Frogs are a delicacy in China.

• ACLO~OK AT..•THE RADIATION RESEARCH lABORATORY 



The rad lab: Not aSrA~ary as you thought 
From the Manhattan Project to reaction times of ionizing radiation, the lab leads the way 
By CHRIS CORRENTE 
News Writer 
From the outside, the Radia­tion Hesearch Building at Notre Dame is a rather ordinary structure, overshadowed by the mammoth height of the library that stands next to it. 
Yet, all one needs to do is take a tour of the facilities, and it is apparent the lab plays a major role not only for the University, but for the national b'OVernment as well. 
Dedicated in 1963, the build­ing is government property, run under a contract with the United States Department of Energy (DOE). It performs ex­periments and research that study chemical reactions re­duced by ionizing radiation. 
According to John Bentley, assistant director of the labora­tory, the DOE's purpose in funding the lab is two-fold. 
"First, there are a number of environments in which ioniza­tion energy is present, " Bentley said. "There's an increasing interest in using radiation to study this." 
"Second, every process you can think of that creates, stores or uses chemical energy in­volves one or more one-elec­tron transfer reactions. Radia­tion chemistry is an extremely useful tool in studying those re­actions." 
·Despite the predetermined goals of the DOE , researchers are given latitude to pick their own experiments if the projects reflect aspects of the overall mission. 
"The mission is determined by the DOE, but the science is determined by the scientist," said Robert Schuler, director of the lab. 
Schuler himself has been na­tionally recognized for his work at the lab. In 1992, he was awarded the Madame Curie Medal by the Polish Association for Radiation Research. The medal was awarded to Schuler for his lifetime efforts in con­tributing insight into the nature of chemical and physical pro­cesses involving radiation. 
Notre Dame has connections to the DOE project that pre­dates the creation of the lab 32 years ago. During World War II, the physics department was called upon to resolve radiation chemical problems relating to the Manhattan Project, the infa­mous collaboration that de­signed the A-bomb. At the time, only the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Notre Dame had the re­sources and equipment modern enough to assist. 
Today, the lab continues to lead in state-of-the-art technol­ogy. This summer, it will dedi­cate a new facility that includes a 7 million volt linear accelera­tor (LINAC), the only one of its kind in the world. The $2 mil­lion piece of equipment will ionize water molecules present in a sample to initiate reactions that will allow researchers to determine the chemical make­up of the sample. 

The lab has also combined the scientific pursuit of knowl­edge with the tradition of Notre Dame. The basement of the lab houses a 3 million volt Van de Graaff electron accelerator that is painted and shaped in the image of a football and has been signed by various Notre Dame football captains. 
Other equipment at the lab 

includes two cobalt-60 sources, a machine that irradiates a sample that is in contact with cobalt sources with gamma rays to analyze products creat­ed, and numerous lasers. According to Bentley, having various types of equipment available is beneficial to researchers. 
"If one technique doesn't work, the experimenter can go to another one and eventually find the correct apparatus be­cause it's all under one roof," Bentley said. 
The high-tech nature of the lab has attracted scientists from over 50 countries. "There are many visitors who want to use our facilities, and they find it very interesting," Bentley said. 
From these many visitors, it is apparent the small lab that stu­dents pass by each day is a world leader in radiation experimentation. With this in mind, even the intimidating structure of the library cannot overshadow the lab's impor­tance. 
Notre Dame's Involvement in the Manhattan Project in the 194o•s 
In the early 1940s, the scientists of the Manhattan Project were looking for an electron accelerator that could exceed an energy level of 2.0 mega-electron volts (MeV). 


By 1942, physicists at Notre Dame had developed a pressurized electron accelerator that could exceed 2.5 MeV 
· for the purpose of measuring the disintegration of deuterium. 
This accelerator was just what the Manhattan Project needed. Notre Dame physicists and project members joined efforts to explore the study of the disintegration threshold of deuterium, which ultimately was used to determine the mass of a neutron, a value essential to measuring the amount of energy released in a nuclear fission process. 

Funding depends on DOE

Your tax dollars at work. 
The research conducted at Notre Dame's Radiation Re­search Building is funded by a yearly grant from the United States Department of Energy (DOE). Although the laboratory is run by the University, it derives all its funds through this government contract. 
According to John Bentley, assistant director of the Radia­tion Laboratory, the amount provided by the government grant varies every year.

Radiation rumors just aren't true 
By JAMIE HEISLER 
News Writer 
While rumors abound about radiated over­sized squirrels and odd colored lights reflecting from the radiation building, the research done there poses no danger whatsoever to the campus or the students, according to Hobert Schuler, director of the laboratory. 
"What this (the spreading of rumors) tells me is that people are afraid of the building and they shouldn't be. They should understand that what we do is the same as research going on in other researeh departments," said Schuler. 
The radiation building itself, which luts long been the source of these rumors, dates back to 11)63. The building is a university lab that is operated by the University and its staff but is funded by the U.S. Department of Energy. 
The research at the lab focuses on the reaction times of chemical fragments that are produced wnen radiated. 
"What we do is all basic research trying to study these properties and it's up to other people to make use of the information. There is no direct application to consumer affairs, however. We're just looking for information," Schuler said. 
While the research has at times been poten­tially dangerous, the laboratory has never had any radiation leaks or other harmful accidents because of the precautions taken by the research professors and students. 
To accomplish the research, the laboratory employs a variety of equipment including five electron accelerators, cobalt-60 sources, and lasers. "Everything is highly computerized, so the information is recorded on computers ­local ones (PCs) to collect the data -and is then networked to data computers," said Schuler. 
The majority of professors who work in the building are mainly in the chemistry de­partment. The laboratory staff includes approxi­mately 50 people, including students. 
down with politics in Washing­ton," Bentley said. 
The budget for the current fiscal year amounts to $3.6 mil­lion. Most of the money is used to pay operational costs, includ­ing the salaries of lab employ­ees. 
Additionally, about $300,000 is invested in capital equipment and $25,000 goes toward build­ing maintenance. 
The laboratory is run by the University under contract with the Department of Energy. It is classified as an institute, an administrative unit within the University, similar to the Kel­logg and other better known university institutes. 

The director of the radiation laboratory reports to the Uni­versity Provost, usually through the Dean of the College of Sci­ence. The radiation research program has held institute sta­tus since 1967, although it first received a government grant in 1949. 
"[Since 1949,] the govern­ment has given $75 million to the program," Bentley said. Although the laboratory cur­rently employs 40 people, this is a smaller payroll than the program maintained 10 years ago, reflecting a number of flat budgets over the past decade.

As for other GOP contenders, Dornan claims Dole and Sen. Phil Gramm are "uptight" dis­cussing moral issues and have failed to give "their best and deepest thoughts ... to sort out what's causing our country to come unglued." 
But Dole will be unbeatable, he said, if he continues on the "values" track he unveiled this week, advocating school prayer and blasting Hollywood for poi­soning the nation's youth.

CAMPUS MINISTRY••• 
•••CONSIDERATIONS 
WELCOME! We are in the midst of our holiest week. Lent, our preparation, ends and this evening we begin a time so important it is called simply the Triduum, the three days. During these three days we will remember with our hearts and minds the Passion, death and resurrection of Jesus, God's only son and our clearest sign of God's great love for us. 
Christian baptism makes us an inseparable part of the Body of Christ. As with any human body, we must nourish ourselves in order to grow and exercise to help stay healthy. In addition, like any body, we need every part of our Christian body in order to live our life to the fullest. We reject God ifwe reject any part of our body or treat any part badly. 
God gives signs of love to us, to the Body of Christ. Jesus himself, the Eucharist and the other Sacraments, and the love of other people -all are ways God says, "I love you" to each of us and to all of us as a community. 
Each year, God gives us new signs of love through people who hear God's call to become members of the Catholic Christian church. Together, we all hope to die with Jesus and to rise with him again to new life, a life of freedom from all that keeps us from God. 
We welcome and thank God for these members of our community who will be Baptized and receive Confirmation and First Eucharist at the Easter Vigil:

PLO widens crackdown, issues gun registration 
By DONNA ABU-NASR 
Associated Pre~ 
GAZA CITY 

PLO chief Vasser Arafat widened his crackdown on Is­lamic: militants Wednesday by issuing an ultimatum: register your guns by May 11 or Pales­tinian police will take them by force. 
Palestinian critics warned that Arafat's strong-arm tactics were a sign the Palestinians were on the -road to military rule. 
The llamas group reacted with defiance, saying its fight­ei'S would not give up their weapons as long as Israeli forces remained in the Gaza Strip. 
The challenge increased fears of civil war between llamas and Islamic Jihad militants and the PLO, which has ruled Gaza and the West Bank city of Jericho for 11 months. 
Tensions were high in the streets, where PLO police were quick to draw their weapons Wednesday. Three plainclothes security men pulled over a Western reporter riding in a taxi, waving assault rifles as they demanded identification. 
Israel Radio reported that late Wednesday evening, the Palestinian police revised their initial May 11 deadline and an­nounced they would begin seiz­ing unregistered weapons Thursday. It wasn't immedi­ately possible to confirm the re­port with Palestinian officials. 
Arafat's forces arrested more than 200 Hamas and Islamic Jihad activists this week after the groups claimed responsibil­ity for two suicide bombings Sunday that killed seven Israeli soldiers and an American col­lege student. 
Palestinian Attorney General Khaled al-Qidreh said 35 Pales­tinians will stand trial before a secret military tribunal. He said some defendants are militants, others suspected collaborators with Israel. Two Islamic Jihad members were sentenced to 15 years and life this week after their convictions. 
Human rights activists ac­cused U.S. leaders, such as Vice President AI Gore, of hypocrisy for praising the establishment of the military courts. 
"I wonder how the United States can be selective about human rights," lawyer Raji Sourani told The Associated Press. "Human rights can only be measured by one standard." 
Despite indications the crack­down was more serious than past efforts, there was deepen­ing gloom in Israel. Islamic mil­itants have killed 65 Israelis in Israel and the occupied territo­ries since October. 
Arafat, under pressure from Israel and the United States, ordered similar roundups after earlier attacks. But they ended with the activists being quickly released. 
"One thing is clear.... They won't dismantle Hamas or pre­vent them from killing Jews," Benjamin Netanyahu, the op­position Likud party leader, told a special session of Parliament on Wednesday. 
Nearly all those arrested this week have been mid-level ac­tivists, not underground mili­tary leaders. Palestinian sources said most have already been released; only about 50 remain in custody. 
The gun registration drive re­ceived little initial attention Wednesday, with one brief an­nouncement on PLO-run TV. 
Brig. Gen. Ghazi Jebali, Gaza City's police chief, promised that "tough measures· will be taken against those who do not give up their (unregistered) arms." 
But by late Wednesday, Palestinian police said no one had turned in any weapons. 
A statement issued by Arafat's office said those who possess bombs will be jailed for up to 10 years. The maximum sentence for stealing the weapons of policemen will be 

··· 
~. 
15 years, and if the theft is per­petrated at night, or by force, attacker will receive a life sen­tence. 
A spokesman for the militant group Hamas said its fighters would not surrender arms as long as Israeli soldiers re­mained in Gaza, guarding the Jewish settlements that are home to 5,000 Israelis. 
"While the Israelis are still here and killing the people, it is nonsense to ask the people to give up their weapons with which they protect them­selves," said Mahmoud Zahar, a senior political figure in Hamas. "We will never give up our weapons." 
Palestinian Planning Minister Nabil Shaath vowed that the campaign would be carried out to the end. 
"Until Hamas, Jihad and ev­erybody commit themselves to respect the agreement (with Is­rael), we have to take the mea­sures necessary to protect the national interest," he said.

McNamara renounces Vietnam 
By MIKE FEINSILBER 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON 
By waiting three decades to admit he was wrong about Vietnam, former Defense Sec­retary Robert MeNamara has opened himself to criticism as bitter as any since he ran "McNamara's War." 
"We were wrong, terribly wrong," McNamara wrote in the book, published Monday, and he came in for an immedi­ate blistering for not having said that while he was still in office and able to alter events. He left in 1968 to take over the World Bank. 
Fewer than 7,000 Americans had died in the war when Mc­Namara concluded in 1966 or 1967 that the war was a mis­take. 
More than eight times as many had died before the United States ceased military action in August 1973. South Vietnam fell to the communists in April1975. 
"Mr. McNamara must notes­cape the lasting moral con­demnation of his countrymen," The New York Times said Wednesday in a sharply per­sonal editorial. 
The Times added: "Three million Vietnamese died. Fifty­eight thousand Americans got to come home in body bags. 
Mr. McNamara, while tor­mented by his role in the war, got a sinecure at the World Bank and summers at the (Martha's) Vineyard (in Mas­sachusetts)." 
In The Los Angeles Times, cartoonist Paul Conrad por­trayed McNamara as standing before the engraved names on the Vietnam Veterans Memorial and saying, "Sorry about that." 
And in a Los Angeles Times column, Robert Scheer wrote, "While I respect the moral angst reflected in this memoir, one must ask why McNamara compounded his crime of com­plicity with the crime of si­lence." 
"What bothers me about it is 
the fact that he seems to have 
reached the conclusion no later 
than the end of 1965 and prob­
ably earlier that the war was 
unwinnable and yet he did not 
confront this head on in his rec­

ommendations to President 
Johnson," said George Herring, 
a Vietnam War historian at the 
University of Kentucky. 

McNamara ran the Pentagon 
More MIAs accounted for 
Vietnam has turned over the remains of several more U.S. servicemen. Since 1988, joint U.S.-Vietnamese searches have resulted in the repatriation of the remains of dozens of Americans listed as missing in action. 

Missing Americans in the region: 

under Presidents Kennedy and Johnson. In the book, "In Ret­rospect: The Tragedy and Lessons of Vietnam," he wrote that he still does not know whether he quit or was fired by Johnson. 
The reaction to his words" re­called the emotion aroused by the war itself. Tens of thou­sands of Americans -.including a college student named Bill Clinton -protested the war, burned draft cards or fled to Canada to escape the draft. 
Even McNamara's son, a Stanford University student, joined the protests. McNamara once fled a student mob at Har­vard through underground util­ity tunnels. 

McNamara, 78, has been in Asia since the book appeared. But he will get plenty of oppor­tunity to answer questions. Times Books, publisher of "In Retrospect: The Tragedy and Lessons of Vietnam," has scheduled him on a book tour that will take him to interviews in New York, Chicago, Boston, Washington, Dallas and Austin in Texas, Atlanta, Seattle, San Francisco and Los Angeles.

Chrysler finishes year with record profits 
Associated Press 
DETROIT 
The stock offer -40 percent above Chrysler's Tuesday clos­ing stock price -is the biggest and most daring takeover gambit to come along since the 1980s heyday of hostile corpo­rate raiding. 
The company finished 1994 with a record $3.7 billion prof­it and a cash surplus of $7.5 billion its managers say they need to weather the industry's next downturn without gutting their product development programs. 
Kerkorian contends that cushion is too big and the company's stock is priced too low. He pushed Chrysler's board in December to increase the stock dividend and buy back shares to push up the price. 
The proposal sent Chrysler shares shooting up in heavy New York Stock Exchange trading, though they ended" only $9.50 higher at $48.75, well below the takeover price. 
That reflected plenty of skepticism about whether such an audacious attempt could succeed and what the prospec­tive buyers plan for the com­pany. 
Under the proposal, the reclusive Kerkorian, who made his fortune in casinos and entertainment, would put up $2 billion of his own money. He already owns 10 percent of Chrysler. 
About $50 million would come from Iacocca, who retired as chairman in 1992 after becoming a corporate icon by bringing Chrysler back from bankruptcy's brink. Other investors, still to be recruited, would add $3 billion more. 
An additional $5.5 billion 
would come from Chrysler's cash surplus and the rest from bank loans and bonds, said Alex Yemenidjian, an execu­tive at Kerkorian's Tracinda Corp. in Las Vegas. 
"It kind of sends goose bumps up your back," Houston Chrysler dealer Alan Helfman said. "Especially if you get Lee Iacocca back, doing commercials .... It's kind of like George Foreman com­ing back." 
Some automotive industry analysts thought the bid was sincere and if Chrysler's direc­tors reject it, Chrysler would be "in play," attracting other potential buyers. 
In a telephone news confer­ence, Yemenidjian rejected the idea that the offer was hostile. 
"It certainly is not hostile to the shareholders, who own the company and who are going to make a bundle of money," Yemenidjian said. He also said the deal wasn't hostile to em­ployees because it doesn't ask for any concessions from them. 
Kerkorian wants Chrysler managers, including Chairman Robert Eaton, to stay on and have a stake in the company. 
University of Michigan pro­fessor Michael Bradley, a spe­cialist in mergers and acquisi­tions, said the way the deal was announced almost cer­tainly meant it was not wel­comed by Chrysler's manage­ment. 
"If private negotiations were going well, this would come out completely different ­they would have announced a deal together," he said. 
The offer reflects Chrysler's status as the most profitable carmaker and the acknowl­edged U.S. leader in lean oper­ating and car and truck design. 
Publisher Peter Osnos, who worked with McNamara for two years as his editor, said the book is selling heavily. An addi­tional 20,000 were ordered af­ter a first printing of 80,000. 
Osnos said McNamara knew what he was in for. 
"The fact that there still is rage does not come as a sur­prise to anyone," Osnos said. "He was prepared for people to say he was responsible. He is not in any way, shape or form trying to escape that responsi­bility. 
What he is trying to do is to provide for the first time the fullest accounting of how it happened." 
John Mueller, a University of Rochester political scientist who specializes in studying wars and presidents, said that even The New York Times -and almost everyone but "extrem­ists" -supported the war in the Kennedy and early Johnson years. 
Even David Halberstam, whose book "The Best and the Brightest" asked how official Washington could have gone astray, wrote in an earlier book that Vietnam was "perhaps one of only five or six nations in the world that is truly vital to U.S. interests," Mueller noted. 
By 1967, McNamara disclosed in his book, his misgivings were deep enough for him to write a memo to President Johnson saying, "The picture of the world's greatest superpower killing or seriously injuring 1,000 noncombatants a week, while trying to pound a tiny backward nation into sub­mission on an issue whose mer­its are hotly disputed, is not a pretty one." 
But he kept his dissent pub­licly silent over the years. 
The initial commentary on McNamara's book was not all critical. USA Today said McNa­mara "has belatedly shown us how to avoid repeating his mis­takes."

• SOFT SCALE SODA 

ETM Develops an Alternative to Ticketmaster 
"We're not going up against Ticketmaster. We're just utilizing free enterprise." 
By ROB ADAMS Music Editor 
F
or those of you who have cringed upon hearing that your $20 con­cert ticket was actually going to cost you $27.50 after Ticketmaster's service charges, don't give up yet. There is hope of a savior in our midst. The ETM Entertainment Network and their first client, Pearl Jam, are deter­mined to lower the costs of service charges attached to ticket prices and keep concerts within fmancial reach of all fans. 
"We hope to keep our service fees to about 10% of the ticket, where Ticketmaster averages about 35%," said Jeff Watson, Press Contact for ETM. · Watson also claims that ETM had been planning to open up an interactive and cheaper ticket distribution system for a while, and the merger with Pearl Jam was just perfect timing. 
"They were looking for a way to sell tickets for their shows and we were looking for clients," he said, "Pearl Jam admired our integrity and our ability to keep the prices down." 
Pear Jam's tour, which is scheduled 
to run between June 16 through July 10 
and involves about twenty dates, will 
have the $18 ticket price that Pearl Jam 
wanted all along, and will include a 
$2.45 service charge in most areas, 
while slightly higher in others. Although 
Pearl Jam had said they would not tour unless they could find a distribution agency that could keep the service charge under $1.80, Pearl Jam's man­a g e r K e I I y Cur it admitted that they w e r e willing to "give a little in negotia­tions with the ticket bro­ker." 

Pearl Jam will probably wait to see how smoothly their first dates run before deciding to add more dates to their current 24-day tour schedule, but nothing is set in stone. In the meantime, ETM is busy attempting to gain other clients, but one major obsta­cle stands in their way: Ticketmaster still has exclusive distribution con­tracts with many venues through­out North America and they plan to keep those contracts strong. 
"Fred Rosen (Ticketmaster CEO) has indicated to me that he intends to make a very strong stand on this issue to pro­tect Ticketmaster's existing contracts with promoters and facilities, and fur­
ther, Ticketmaster will use all available remedies to protect itself from outside third parties that attempt to interfere with hose xist­
n g 
on-
tracts," said Ben urs, executive direcror of the North 
American Concert Promoters Association. Watson, who also claims 
that ETM did not enter :the market with the specific intention of providing competition for Tick­
etmaster, was nonchalant when asked about the existing con­tracts. "Yes, we'll just attempt to deal with the other venues 
in those areas and see where the mar­ket goes. Those contracts are time-
lapsed." ETM may not be able to distribute tickets for shows in certain venues, but 
it does have an edge on Ticketmaster when it comes to technology. Fans at­tempting to purchase tickets will have three methods of both acquisition and payment. Eventually, they can buy tick­ets from ETM by calling one of their 1­800 numbers, going to their home page on the Internet and accessing ETM Ma­chines which will feature chances to join fan clubs, view videos, listen to new music and a host of other activities besides just buying tickets. 
"We see our system as an example of what true interactive television can be for the 21st century," says Gene Heck­erman, CEO of ETM. "It's a direct advertising, sales, and delivery system that will be used for a wide range of applications." 
Members of the concert world are excited to watch ETM's progress, and most are confident that they are here to stay. 
"I think ETM is going to give Ticketmaster a run for its money," said Doreen Linder, who works for Eric Henning Concert Promotions. 
Watson seems to have no qualms about entering the market. Since no major obstacles stand in their way, maybe ETM, Ticketmaster's alternative, has come to save us from overpriced concert tickets. 
"Absolutely, it's a free market," he says. "Pearl Jam is just our first client. We hope to be in the business for a long time."

***~ Salt, Magnapop) who can chew bubble-gum and sing about their boyfriends at the same time. This genre of fun-loving riffy pop is fine with me. It's hard not to like and hell, I have to admit, I'm a sucker for a girl with a guitar. 
On their self-titled LP, Elastica brings to the States a sort of female rendition of current Brit-import faves and MTV darlings, Oasis. On the heels of Primal Scream, The Stone Roses and Oasis, Elastica does add a new flavor to this British pop invasion. Lead singer, Justine Frischmann, formerly of Suede, sounds like a cross between Debbie Harry of Blondie and veteran punker Chryssie Hynde. 
And unlike their predecessors, Elastica rely more on external musical elements rather than the "feel and roots" of say, The Stone Roses. Not afraid to experi­ment, drum-machine beats and fuzzy guitar riffs add an artificial aesthetic to the record. However, this arti­ficial element was intended, and combined with the face value pubescent lyrics, it makes for a fun record. 
Oh yeah, the songs. Well there are 16 of them, and let's just say there's plenty of bang for your buck. "Line Up," the first track, unapologetically introduces the lis­tener to Elastica's unabashed aggressiveness. "Drivel Head," she sings backed by a grinding fuzziness, "I knew that her mind was made up to get rocked." 
In "Connection," a techno-esque riff opens up. fol­lowed by an artificial drum beat, and ultimately a flood of guitars. Yes, there are plenty of guitars on this record. After all, that's what makes Elastica, guitars and plenty of them. 
In "Car Song," backed by a teasing and lackadaisical mixture of guitar riffs, Frischmann sings in her best Debbie Harry imitation, "I hardly know you/but I think I'm going to/ let's go siesta/ in your ford fiesta." "Shutter" is one of those vintage turn down the bass, turn up the treble British new wave songs. Guitars, guitars and more guitars. 
Elastica, is not however, all fun and games. "Never Here" is one of the few songs on the record where they let their feelings get the best of them. "And I lent you an ear/ Funny how it seems to me now/ that you were never here." 
Elastica is one of those rare records which will enjoy critical as well as commercial success. In other words, they'll probably be "The Next Big Thing." You can bet that DGC will reach into your living room and with the help of MTV, shove it down your throat. But you'll like it and probably even buy it.

emember Skid Row? Sure you do. You remember those bands with lots of hair, flashy guitarists and lyrics full of semi-clever sexual innuendo? To be fair, Skid Row had a little more genuine attitude than their brethren in Bon Jovi or Poison, but they all had that same hairspray appeal. Well, Sebastian Bach

out of five 

**~ and company are back with their first original release in over four years, Subhuman Race, and listeners take note: Those of you who have been waiting with bated breath for a repeat of 1991's Slave to the Grind will be disappointed. 
On Race, Skid Row frees itself from the glam-rock trappings of yesteryear, laying down thirteen compact tracks that were tailor-made for headbanging. That's not to suggest that the entire album is fresh, however. In fact, the great debate that seems to occupy the band and producer Bob "Hit Man" Rock is, "Should we sound like Stone Temple Pilots or Soundgarden?" The answer is indisputable on the album's opening track and first single, "My Enemy," which is such a brazen STP rip off that Bach even sounds like Weiland. Complete with a classic all-speed, no-heart glam rock guitar solo, "My Enemy" almost makes you wonder if it isn't STP. Almost. 
"Firesign," another STP cover tune, has a nicely har­monized bridge and very little posing, until the chorus. "All the ways you kill me/ They've begun to thrill me/ Nothing there fulfills my firesign." Wow. The lyrics on Race illustrate an attempt at social criticism that would be successful if they weren't almost completely inane; luckily, you really can't hear them. And one would have to be a cold, cold person to make it through "medicine Man" with a straight face. 
In all fairness, Race has some very good qualities, and these are ultimately what makes this album frus­trating. B!!.ssist Rachel Bolan and drummer Rob Affuso are among the finest rhythm sections in the business, and their incessant, pounding groove is captivating. And while this may not be the most original album ever produced, it has its moments. 
"Eileen," a song about a girl who sees things that aren't there, is absolutely creepy, the guitar hook bending around Bach's haunted, anxious vocals. "Breakin' Down," the obligatory power ballad, features some very touching and nuanced guitar work (for once), and although it builds up to explode by the sec­ond chorus, it is a nice chance to catch your breath after the relentless pace of the first eleven songs. 
However, it's what goes on outside of those songs and apart from the excellent rhythm section that holds Subhuman Race down. Bach's singing alternates between posing and honesty, never fmding the middle ground, and if you've heard one guitar solo on this album, you've heard just about all of them. This is hon­est-to-God headbanging music with real energy, and it will sound great on tour, but it isn't very distinctive. Fun to listen to at times, but hard to remember when it's over: in a way. the perfect glam-rock comeback.

W
ith sultry guitars and melodic vocals, Canada's newest lndie heroes, tre­ble charger, are making head­lines. Last fall the Sault St. Marie, Ontario quartet won Favorite New Group honors and second place at the prestigious Music Matters Discovery To Disc talent search put on by Toronto radio station CFNY. The $25,000 prize from CFNY was well reeeived, but offers from major labels including Sony, A&M, and Virgin were not. 
Instead, this relatively new band decided to keep their loyalty with the lndie music scene. Guitarists/ Lead Singers Greig Nori and Bill Priddle along with drummer Morris Palter and Bassist Hosie Martin feel that money is not the ultimate goal of trnble eharger; thn real desire is to make quality albums and have fun doing it. This decision could prove to be disastrous but, more than likely, it will be beneficial bneause it will allow the band to have more fmndom and less pres­sure to put out albums. 
Signing with the Independent rtH~ord labnl Sonie Vnyon Hecords in February of this year, their first relnase, NC-17, is gaining recognition around North Ameriea. Entnring the Canadian National Campus Chart as well as the V.S. Imports Chart at number snven, NC-17 has moved to the number ontl position on IIMV Ht1cord Stores lndie Retail Chart, and still remains in that position.

the band includes a bar graph of who they are frequently ana­logued with in their press kit. Topping their chart is R.E.M., for some uncomprehendable reason since the two groups share few musical similarities. A more accu­rate comparison is Neil Young, largely because of the similarity between singing voices. The like­ness to Neil Young is so close that treble charger received an offer to play on Sony Canada's gold selling Tribute to Neil Young, an offer which they did not refuse. A few more comparisons include Teenage Fan Club, James, The llappy Mondays and The Char­latans VK, the last three being bands that were surprisingly not found on treble charger's chart, but whose techno/pop/rave combination greatly resembles treble charger, sans keyboards.

• CVBERSURF Electronic employment Forget the Sunday want ads and Career and Placement, now you can do all of your job hunting from the comfort of your favorite PC. Scenario: You want a job in the software indus­try. Step one: Put up an on-line resume. Step two: Launch your favorite Web Browser (Netscape By Aaron Villaruz is always a winner), and browse Accem Writer a few employer databases and find a software house that looks right for you. Check out their Mission Statement, the companies they cater to, their current projects and last year's revenues. Step three: Drop them some e-mail, refer them to your on-line resume and voila, application process complete. Sounds easy, huh'? It is. It's the wave of the future. The future is now. Dozens of employers are already on-line, hundreds of colleges and universities already have on­line career and placement services and thousands of reg­ular people just like you and me already have on-line resumes. Probably the best two on-line career services around are the Ohio State Job Service and the Career Mosaic. The Ohio State Job Server allows anyone to search for a job according to the area they want to get into, features in-depth profiles of employers that often visit the Ohio State campus, an index to on-line employers worldwide, a listing ofjob search aids and an index to various on-line job listings. Employer profiles include banks, such as the Bank of America, JP Morgan and Citibank; a variety of accounting firms, including three of the Big Six: Price Waterhouse, KPMG and Ernst and Young; and a good number of tech­nology vendors, such as NeXT and Microsoft. Job search aids include the Meckler Job Web and a variety of on-line career hunting survival guides, including those put out by Riley and Dun & Broadstreet. It also has an index of other job pages at various col­leges and Universities, such as Georgia State, Texas A & M, Florida State, Stanford and University of Virginia (sadly, the University of Notre Dame does not have an on­line placement service as of yet). The on-line job listing includes listings of federal jobs, state jobs and employ­ment in the nonprofit industry. The Ohio State Job Server ends with a guide on going to business school. The Career Mosaic offers similar services, with a slight­ly broader scope. It offers an extensive Jobs Offered Database, which has listings ofjobs in a variety of cate­gories, including high technology, telecommunications, finance and software. Like the Ohio State service, it also has employer listings from a variety of industries. However, while the Ohio State service caters mainly to business and information technology specialists, the Career Mosaic features a wide range of employers. Another nifty nugget which is useful for job-hunting is the job Meta-List put out by Texas A & M. This "Monster Job Board" is an especially thorough and extensive listing. The key to any good job search is an outstanding resume. Most of the career help services offer tips and examples of what a model resume should look like. One shining example is "The Ultimate Resume" on the A & M server. This resume takes full advantage of the media it is presented on. When you pop this baby up on your favorite Web Browser, you not only get name, address, GPA and job history, you get pictures, soundbites and even some looping mood music running in the back­ground while you view. Anyone who maintains a personal home page can put up an on-line resume. In fact, in the techie arena, the personal home page has become a calling card of sorts. Now, instead of, "Here's my card and portfolio, have a look and tell me what you think," we say, "Here is my URL (Universal Resource Locater), drop in on my home page and tell me what you think." On-line job search services are expanding as fast as the Internet itself. While now it caters mostly to technology or business related fields, the Web is already beginning to feature a more diverse collection of businesses and industries. In the future, employers may abandon want­ads all together and conduct on-line hiring instead. So if you're not on the cutting edge, you better catch up! It's not enough just to have special resume paper and an e­mail address anymore. Cybersurf appears every Thursday in Accent. Brian Zelizo and Aaron Villaruz will alternate as columnists.

This trend continues through­out the duration of the album as treble charger find their niche. Different segments of songs allow all the musicians to introduce their particular instruments as the rest of the band fades into the background. However, this trend does not only apply to the instru­ments. treble charger switches lead vocalist on several tracks giving a unique blend of the Manchester sound and Neil Young. While one singer is doing his thing, the other quietly accompanies him in the back­ground with serene harmonies. This interesting approach creates a very raw, honest tinge to NC-17 with the music in its purest form. 
A major highlight of the CD is the seventh song simply called "Red." This track was treble charger's first radio single and helped gain them the popularity they have now. After listening to the album, it is a song that not only stands out because of its catchy melody and penetrating lyrics, but because it is the only song that doesn't carry the famil­iarity imposed by the rest of the album. 
"Red" starts off slow and picks up its pace as it climaxes at the chorus, "As the red fades from your wrinkled dress I A picture of the people you've impressed I hangs on a wall around here I vision starts to crawl when I'm near." "Red," if heard on its own, would create indecision as to whether or not it is some new Neil Young track due to strikingly familiar vocals and guitars. 
treble charger is heading in the right direction with this release and their resulting popularity is justified. The band plans to release a new seven song disc with a CD-ROM multimedia extravaganza at the end of it. This may be difficult to find or may be an expensive import. The band has provided alternate means by which to acquire NC-17 at a fairly low cost. For more information about this contact Sonic Unyon Records at (905) 632-1905. Look out for treble charger because their popularity is sure to grow.

Fiset shuts out Bruins 4-0 Third period goal leads 
Peter Forsberg and Mike Ricci scored power-play goals 10 seconds apart late in the second period and goalie Stephane Fiset had 36 saves Wednesday night as the Quebec Nordiques blanked the Boston Bruins 4-0. 
The Nordiques, second in the NHL with 39 power-play goals, struck quickly against Boston, owner of the top penalty-killing average in the league. They broke open a scoreless game after Maruisz Czerkawski was given a major penalty and a game misconduct for high­sticking Forsberg while Boston had a man advantage at 17:37 of the second period. 
Forsberg broke a scoreless tie with his 11th goal, sending a shot past Blaine Lacher after Wendel Clark missed the net. Quebec's Eastern Conference leaders continued to apply pressure after the ensuing face­off and Ricci was credited with his 11th goal for a 2-0 lead at 
19:58. The puck slid past Lacher during a massive traffic jam in the crease. 
Whalers 4, Senators 2 
Jimmy Carson's second goal of the game capped a third-pe­riod rally by the Whalers, who moved into sole possession of the eighth and final Eastern Conference playoff berth. 

Defenseman Brian Glynn's 50-footer at 10:29 tied the game 2-2. Carson put home a rebound 53 seconds later after beleaguered Ottawa goalie Don Beaupre stopped Glen Wesley's blast from the right point. 
Alexandre Daigle and Scott Levins connected for the Senators, who are winless in their last 14 games and offi­cially were eliminated from playoff contention. 
Rangers 3, Sabres 1 
Mike Richter returned to form and the Rangers, battling for the last playoff spot in the Eastern Conference, gained a crucial victory. 
Richter, knocked out of three straight home games and strug­gling through one of the tough­est periods of his career, dis­played the goaltending form that helped the Rangers win the Stanley Cup last season when he had a 42-12-6 record. 
Richter, who is 11-15-2, made 22 saves. 
The Sabres played without leading scorer Alexander Mogilny. out with a pinched nerve in his neck. 
Devils 2, Capitals 1 

Neal Broten's power-play goal in the third period lifted the Devils. 
John MacLean skated down the right wing and stopped at the left goalpost, sliding a pass back to Broten, who was trail­ing the play. Broten, who beat goaltender Jim Carey to the glove side, has a point in eight of nine games since being dealt to New Jersey by Dallas. 
Sergei Brylin also scored for the Devils, who came into the game with 14 power-play goals, the fewest in the NHL. 
Peter Bondra scored for Washington. 
Islanders 3, Panthers 1 

The Panthers' playoff chances received another blow from New York goaltender Tommy Soderstrom, who stopped 38 shots. 
On Saturday, Soderstrom held Florida to a 2-2 tie in a game in which the Panthers outshot New York 43-37. This time, Florida had 39 shots to the Islanders' 24, but Soderstrom was even tighter. 
Derek King, Steve Thomas and Patrick Flatley had the goals for New York. 

Flyers past Canadiens 
Associated Press 
PHILADELPHIA 
In case anyone hasn't noticed, the Philadelphia Flyers have owned third periods over the last 22 games. 
On Wednesday, it was the Montreal Canadiens' time to observe the Flyers' dominance over the final 20 minutes. 
Mikael Renberg scored his 21st goal early in the third pe­riod to lift Philadelphia past Montreal, 3-2. Philadelphia is 10-3 this season when entering the final period tied. In their last 22 games, the Flyers are 15-5-2 and have outscored their opponents 30-13 in the third period. 
"You've got to believe," Philadelphia coach Terry Murray said. "If you don't be­lieve, there's no chance at all. You can win some games you don't deserve to win because of that belief and hope." 
The Flyers are 11-0-2 this season when leading entering the final period. 
"The whole team feels we're pretty strong in the third pe­riod," Renberg said. "It's a good feeling." 
McLaughlin

eight times since I've been here. Right now, I'm playing drop outside backer." 
Whether he stays or is moved again, the sophomore-to-be has just one goal. 
"I just want to play. I love being the psycho man out there. It is fun." 
Hopefully, Irish fans can reap the same enjoyment from John McLaughlin's play. They should. 
Knight's out: After rejoining the football team for the spring, Thomas Knight has been ab­sent since the first practice and may no longer be a member of the football team. 
"I haven't seen him on the field since the first practice," Irish defensive coordinator Bob Davie said. "I can only com­ment on the people I see out there (on the field). As far as I know, Knight is not a part of the defense or the football team." 
Irish head coach Lou Holtz stated last night that Knight had to learn to be a Notre Dame student before becoming a member of the football team.

• NFL 

Owners finally approve Rams move 
By R.B. FALLSTROM 
Associated Press 
IRVING, Texas The Rams will play in St. Louis this year after all. 
A month after barring their move from Southern California, owners voted 23-6 on Wednesday to relocate the Rams to St. Louis, the first time an NFL team has left the West Coast. 
The Rams, St. Louis officials and even the Missouri attorney general had threatened to sue the league if it blocked the move. 
"The game is over and I won't say we won but ... well, I guess we won one," Rams owner Georgia Frontiere said. "I think we all won." 
The Rams agreed to pay $30 million to the league to get the owners to reverse a 21-3 vote last month in Phoenix. The 23 votes Wednesday was the min­imum needed. 
Commissioner Paul Tagliabue said the reversal, which will leave the NFC West with only one team west of St. Louis, was more an attempt to avoid a lawsuit than about the money. 
"The decision to have peace and not to have war was a big factor," Tagliabue said. 
Buffalo, Pittsburgh, Washington, Phoenix and both New York teams voted against the move. 
Los Angeles Raiders owner AI 

Davis abstained, as he did in Phoenix. Sports agent Leigh Steinberg of Save the Rams felt betrayed. 
"Clearly, the league has de­cided here that the violation of their guidelines governing fran­chise relocation isn't im­portant," Steinberg said. 
"The NFL's got some mighty tall explaining to do as to how violations of their own reloca­tion policy by the Rams sudden­ly became acceptable." 
The move also is apparently tied to the construction of a sta­dium for the Los Angeles Raiders at Hollywood Park, which would guarantee an NFL franchise in the area. 
The Raiders, who moved from Oakland in 1982, had been hinting they might move, and NFL owners worried over not having a team in the nation's No. 2 market. 
But the Los Angeles Times, citing unidentified sources, said Wednesday if the Rams' move from Anaheim in nearby Orange County was approved, the issue of the Hollywood Park stadium will also be brought before the owners and likely be approved. 
"We're studying the ramifica­tions of losing the No. 2 televi­sion market from our NFC package," Fox spokesman Vince Wladika said. 
"It's an open issue for us to 
discuss."

Montana to announce retire01ent 
By CRAIG HORST 
Associated Press 
KANSAS CITY, Mo. 
Joe will go. On Tuesday. 
Joe Montana, perhaps the best quarterback in NFL his­tory, will announce his retire­ment in San Francisco that day and follow with a news confer­ence in Kansas City on Wednesday. 
International Management Group, the firm that represents Montana, announced only that a news conference in San Francisco will be held, but a source at the agency said it would be Montana's long-spec­ulated retirement. 
Chiefs president Carl Peterson did everything but confirm Montana's career is over. 
"I will make this statement ­that we will have a press con­ference here next Wednesday, probably at 10 a.m., specific to the status of Joe Montana," he said. 
Montana, at a police benefit in San Jose, Calif., on Tuesday night, was also evasive when questioned about his retire­ment. 
"I can't say it ain't or it is," he said. 
When asked whether he'd be attending the Chiefs quarter­back camp next week, he said: "I haven't had to go to one yet. I'm hoping I don't have to go that one either." 
The Kansas City Star report­ed that NBC has been negotiat­ing with Montana to join the network as a football commentator. Montana, the paper added, also has talked with the NFL about becoming a league spokesman. 
Montana's desire to retire at age 38-he would be 39 at the start of training camp -results from a number of factors. 
They range from injuries (most recently knee surgery), the wishes of his wife Jennifer to return to California and his feeling the Chiefs had not as­sembled a good enough team to help him gain an unprece­dented fifth Super Bowl title. 
Retirement would mark an end to a marvelous career that included Super Bowl victories in 1990, 1989, 1985, 1982. He was the Super Bowl's most valuable player three times. 
An elbow injury disabled him for most of two years, and he lost his job in San Francisco to Steve Young. 
Montana has one year left on the three-year contract he signed with Kansas City. He was traded by San Francisco on April 20, 1993, with safety David Whitmore and a third­round draft choice for a first­round draft choice. 
He missed five games in 1993 with wrist and hamstring in­juries, but led the Chiefs to an 11-5 record and the AFC cham­pionship game. 
He sparked playoff rallies against Pittsburgh and Houston before the Chiefs lost to Buffalo -one step from the Super Bowl. 
The Chiefs finished 9-7 last year with a first-round playoff loss to Miami. 
Montana completed 299 of 493 passes for 3,283 yards, throwing for 16 touchdowns with nine interceptions.

This last home game of the season is also one of the most important for the Irish. 
If the squad hopes to reach the NCAA tournament, they must first down the Falcons from Colorado Springs. Air Force is also a member of the Great Western Lacrosse League, which sends one school to the tournament each year. 
Nobody seems too worried about the Falcons. The Irish have won six out of seven from Air Force in series history, in­cluding a 20-8 massacre last season. 
The Falcon offense runs from a transition game. They play a 2-2-2 set game with two men camping out by the crease. 

'tiger-hard' defensive set. It's a more aggressive defense. We'll try to deny the ball inside with our middies and our de­fensemen will try to strip the ball," co-captain Mike Iorio predicted. 
The Falcon defense will most likely employ a zone defense to contain the Irish attack. They also may switch to a pressure set. "They have good athletes, and they're big on hustling," said fellow captain Randy Colley. "We'll do what we've been doing all season with our focus on ball-control." 
Freshman Alex Cade has taken the crease and made it his home. The keeper amassed 19 saves against Harvard, a Crimson, should not give him much of a challenge. Cade has 83 saves on the season with at least four games left to play. "Alex Cade is an exceptional goalkeeper," senior middie Will Sutton offered. 

This game is the last at home for the seniors. Generally they don't seem too sentimental. "We're going out for the win. Our focus is on the game," defenseman Chris Bury said. 
"We don't want to lose this one," Iorio offered. "In our four years here we've done really well at home. It's special playing at home with our friends in the stands, but our first priority for the game is to make sure we win." 
Belles head to state meet 
By CAROLINE BLUM Saint Mary's Sports Editor 
It's the big one. The track team will compete in the Little State Meet in Indianapolis on Saturday while we are home with our loved ones. But they do not mind, for this is the event they have been waiting their whole season for. 
The Little State meet consists of all small schools in Indiana, primarily Division III teams. The meet takes place at IUPU in Indianapolis on a track that hosts the Olympic trials. 
With a great track will come intense competition, however. The Belles are expecting to en­counter their greatest competi­tion thus far on Saturday. 
"Basically, the meet will in­volve some stiff competition. The team has improved in ev­ery meet so far, and I don't ex­pect Saturday to be any differ­ent," said head coach Larry Szczechowski. 
Sophomore Kelly Medlin, who has already had two record­breaking performances in the shot put has been excited about the meet for quite awhile. 

Medlin believes that she has a good chance of breaking her current school record on Saturday. 
Paula Kivinen, the team's starring high jumper, ex­pressed her excitement toward the Little State Meet as well. She is looking forward to the intense competition and hopes to make her greatest jump yet. 
The meet will begin at 10:00am on Saturday at IUPU.

Steaming Boilermakers defeat Irish, 5-2 
By MEGAN McGRATH 
Sports Writor 
Evidently, the Notre Dame baseball team needs a little more time to warm up. 
Since the team had already missed its allotted Wednesday classes, the Irish couldn't make the trip to face Purdue until right after school, arriving about twenty minutes before game-time. 
·The result was a 5-2 beating by the Boilermakers (17-1 7) in whieh the Irish (20-12) commit­ted five errors. 
"Its going to be a difficult experience for us," Mainieri said Tuesday. "Arriving right before the game is something we've never done before." 
It might be something the Irish will never do again. 
Starter Gregg llenebry was pulled after a rough second inning. 
Hobb Hademaker led ofT with a single, and scored on a Sean Williams double. Rob McKeeman singled to score Williams, and McKeeman would seore on a bloop double Hick Galle was able to fist over first baseman Craig DeSensi. 
The sophomore left-hander allowed four earned runs and six hits. He walked two in gaining his first loss of the year 
(2-1). 
·Notre Dame received strong outings from its three relief pitchers. Freshman Justin Gleichowski went two and a third innings, allowing one run and two hits. 
Senior Hich Sauget had his strongest outing of the year, according to pitching coach Brian O'Connor. Sauget lasted three innings, allowing one hit and striking out three. Tim Kraus was perfect for an inning with one strikeout. 
The oiTensive highlights were limited for Notre Dame, thanks to Boilermaker pitcher Chris Bloomer. Bloomer threw a complete game, striking out five. 
Although the Irish tallied nine hits, 11 runners were left on base. 
The only earned run for the Irish would come on Christian Parker's first collegiate home run in the sixth. The freshman designated hitter was 2-3. 
Parker has performed well both at the plate and on the hill for Notre Dame. He is 2-3 with a 4.81 earned run aver­age, but his 43 innings pitched leads the team. 
On a bit of tear at the plate recently, Parker has raised his average to .327, good for sixth among everyday players. 
"I really enjoy doing both (hitting and pitching) and I'm happy to do it," Parker says. "I don't lind it hard to concen­trate on one or the other." 
After Parker's homer in the sixth, Howan Richards and Handall Brooks singled with two outs. But DeSensi ground­ed out to first to kill the last Irish threat of the game. 
Outfielder Scott Sollmann went 2-4 with a double and a run scored in the first. The sophomore is leading the Irish with a .395 average. Sollmann is in the midst of an eight game hitting streak. 
Brooks was the only other player to have a multiple hit game, also going 2-4. Third baseman Mike Amrhein got one hit to bring his hitting streak to 15 games. 
Notre Dame will face NAIA Siena Heights of Michigan today in a game just added to the schedule. Action will begin at 6 p.m. at Frank Eck Stadium. 
Sophomore Larry Mohs will get the start, and will be trying for his first win of the year against two losses.

replace is going to be the lead­ership in practices and big games. Someone is going to have to step up and take con­trol, make this team their own, and be the leader." 
Of course, with the high tal­ent level of the current fresh­man and sophomore classes, someone should come out to take control. 
"Three years ago, (Notre Dame) started getting athletes to compete. For the last two years, we've gotten lacrosse players who can come in and compete. And this squad will have an outstanding goalie (Alex Cade) for the next four years," Sutton predicted. 
The last home game won't be sentimental for Sutton. "I just want to win, to leave with a vic­tory. Plus, we still have four more games, and then the tour­ney." 
What he will miss is the the time spent doing the things taken for granted. "It's been fun being at home, in the locker room, going to Jim Barry in the training room. The team atmosphere." 
Coming back for a fifth sea­son demonstrates the dedica­tion Sutton has to the team, as well as to the game. "Lacrosse is one of those games that you start playing at eight or nine years old. When you finish col­lege, you're done. After all of the time and eiTort I've put in, I had to come back. Lacrosse is something I love to do."

action. So was Notre Dame, breaking the Broncos in a con­vincing fashion. 
Despite the blustery weather, ace hurler Terri Kobata fired six shutout innings, improving her record to 13-1. 
"They're a good hitting team," Kobata said, "It was hard because I had to wear sleeves. I'm not used to wear­ing something on my arms." 
Whether Kobata was talking about restricting her throwing motion or restricting Western Michigan is unclear. She lim­ited the Broncos to just four hits, and no runner was al­lowed to reach third base. 
Offensively, Miller put it best when she said, "Keys was the key." That's first baseman Andy Keys. With two out in the bottom of the second, she got the ball rolling by singling up the middle. Second baseman Michelle Cline impressed Miller by promptly following with a single to right field. 
"When the conditions are like this, that's when you need someone to step up, and she did," Miller said. 
Keys then scored the only run Notre Dame needed on Jennifer Giampaolo's single. Giampaolo scored the final run of the Notre Dame second on Katie Marten's single. 
over Grady Burnett at number six. 
"John Jay started slowly and has hecome a tough out," Bayliss said. ..Sprouse has been a rock for us at number two singles." Bayliss also added that Simme fought "like a tiger" when he was behind. 
Bayliss said the team contin­ues to get close to the level of play they need to reach. Five of the six players that compet­ed Wednesday will be back next year and, coupled with a top ten recruit, make next season look bright as well. 
On Saturday, it won't be any easier as the Irish travel to Baton Rouge to take on eight rated LSU. LSU just defeated the number six team in the nation, so the two teams should boast great confidence. Bayliss feels the Irish are probably playing better tennis now than they have all season, and they will need to continue the trend against LSU. 
The Irish are currently ranked twenty-fourth, but the new ratings computer this year does not account for strength of schedule in the ratings. But; if it is how you play that matters regardless of the rank, the Irish team is def­initely a tough out right now.

Senior co-captain Sara Hayes and the Irish defeated Western Michigan Tuesday, bringing the team's record to 24-9 for the season. 
Notre Dame added another run in the sixth. Meghan Murray drew a walk, and stole second, before scoring on Keys' double to right. 
Tomorrow the Irish will host Loyola in a game that was orig­inally scheduled for Sunday, but fell victim to rain. Loyola began the week with a 16-7 record, and among MCC clubs ranks fourth in overall winning percentage, right behind Notre Dame. The Irish will looking to change their luck in double­headers.

McLaughlin 
gives the Irish an aggressive edge 
By TIM SHERMAN Associate Spons Editor 
Last season, he was the spe­cial teams standout. Highly excitable, extremely aggressive, and very effective, freshman John McLaughlin became Lou Holtz's own Steve Tasker. 
Now, he is ready to give more. 
"Last year, kickoffs were a lot of fun but it isn't the same as actually playing," McLaughlin, who had seven solo tackles on coverage, said. "I really missed playing linebacker so I just want to get back out there again." 
If this spring is any indication, McLaughlin should get his wish.

After last year's season-ending injury, captain Will Sutton is back to lead the Irish offense 

-
-
By DAVE TREACY Sports Writer 
Imagine getting injured in the first game of your senior year. 
Imagine being told that your injury was a "freak thing" that would keep you on the side­lines for the entire season. 
Imagine being a chosen as a captain of the team, a leader, reduced to riding the bench be­cause of the stress fracture in your femur. 
Meet Will Sutton. 
"It was a strange feeling watching from the sidelines. I came into the season feeling good about the team, feeling good about myself. And then, the injury came at the Penn State game," Sutton said. 
So Sutton came back for a fifth year. "Getting injured wasn't the way I wanted to go out." 
This season, Sutton has once again assumed his role, if not his status as a captain, as the team's vocal leader. He will be leading his teammates on the field this afternoon against the Air Force Acedemy. 
"I bet my teammates wish I was a silent leader. But that's not me. I'm vocal during prac­tice, vocal on the field. I make a lot of noise. I think that's how I can best help the team. When my teammates lose track of our goals, I tend to remind them," the mid die explained. 
One thing is certain: his 
team is happy he decided to come back, shouting and all. 
"He's a coach on the field. He knows the game extremely well, and he's been a big help to the younger guys. His sbility and his leadership on the field has made the difference in the midfield this season," stated senior attackman Randy Colley. 
"He's been a great leader," senior defenseman Mike Iorio said. "He leads by example. Will's the middie who works hardest on the field, the hard­est in practice. And he expects everyone to live up to the ex­pectations he sets for himself." 
"He wants to make sure the team wins," Iorio concluded. 
He does more than yell to en­sure a team victory. With 14 goals and 12 assists, Sutton is second on the team in total points, and is tied for the lead in assists with fellow fifth-year senior Randy Colley. Sutton also has picked up more ground balls than any other middie. 
He's seen a lot of classes come and go through his career at Notre Dame. "This year's senior class is the hard­est working class since I've been here. Our starting lines have all seniors and juniors. Guys like Marc Pasquale, Billy Gallagher, Chris Bury, have all done an outstanding job. We're a pretty veteran team for the first time, and I have to

crew keys Irish win 
BY NEIL ZENDER Sports Writer 
Even though she scored the game-winning run and drove in another, Andy Keys wasn't the Notre Dame softball team's MVP yesterday. Nor was all­universe starter Terri Kobata, who fired six shutout innings. The Irish owe their 4-0 win over Western Michigan to the studs with the Shopvac -the Notre Dame ground crew. They sucked it up on the field, and enabled the Irish to im­prove to 24-9. 
"I really want to thank T, Jerome and their crew," Coach Liz Miller raved. "They're the best ground crew in the coun­try." 
Originally, Western Michigan didn't want to play because of the lousy weather conditions. There were three lakes on campus, Saint Mary's, Saint Joseph's, and the one covering the outfield at Ivy Field. But while the Irish ground crew was busy pumping all the water out of the outfield, Miller convinced Western Michigan to at least play one game if the field was up to par. Sure enough, the field was ready for
