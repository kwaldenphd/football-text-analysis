Vol. VII No. 43 Tuesday, November 7, 1972 


Professor Paul Rathburn voiced sentiments that the Faculty Senate resign if reltions between the Academic Council and Senate are come to an end. 
Dissolution of Faculty Senate deemed possible 
by David Rust Staff Reporter 
Professor Paul Rathburn spoke last night for a "widely held" sentiment in the ranks of the Faculty Senate that the Senate be dissolved or its members resign if the Academic Council follows its steering committee's recommendation to severe all formal ties between the Council and the Senate. 
Rathburn, professor of English, Faculty Senate and college council member and president of the American Association of University Professors' Notre Dame chapter, included the qualification in his own possible future decision whether or not to resign, of whether or not the Council votes to make all meetings of that body closed. 
Current Faculty Senate chairman and physics professor Jerry Jones, ex officio member of the Council, reports that no decision was reached on either of these issues at the Council's meeting concerning Faculty Manual revision yesterday. 
Presently, the only formal link between the Faculty Senate and Academic Council is the ex officio membership of the Senate's chairman on the Council. The Senate committee's Faculty Manual revision recommendations would provide that all 20 of the elected FacultyCouncil members (under the Senate committee's new Council membership plan) would automatically assume an ex officio status in the Senate. 
Council steering committee recommendations, however, 
according to Rathburn, would eliminate even the Senate 
chairman's seat on the Council and bar aH faculty senate 
members from Council membership. 
"If the Academic Council votes to isolate the Senate 
completely from the Council, so that there is no member of 
the Senate on the Council, and if it decides to keep its 
meetings closed, then it would seem very sensible to me that 
Senate members resign their position," said Rathburn. 
Rathburn reminded that the Faculty Senate only proposes recommendations, while the Academic Council "makes policy." If no channel is provided for Senate recom­mendations to get through to and be defended in the Council, said Rathburn. "That's horrible in itself." 
Combined with a proscription of open meetings, said Rath­burn, "Why bother having a faculty senate?" 
He added that "Information we're getting at the moment is that there are no plans to make these (Council) meetings open." 
Economics professor Tom Swartz, last year's Faculty Senate head, does not believe that the steering committee's revisions would "bar" Faculty senators from Council membership, but does agree that they would eliminate all "formal links" between the two bodies and said that "There would be overwhelming support to dissolve" ;:~mong the Senators should the steering committee's version on this point be adopted without amendment. 
"The Faculty Senate servesas a sounding board for issues that are passed on to the Academic Council," said Swartz. "If there is no mechanism" for this communication of issues, then the Senate would be reduced to "a nice place to debate the issues." 
"I don't think we're quite up to that," added Swartz. 



Saint Mary's lifts tenure moratorium 
Five faculty members granted tenure 
by Maria Gallagher St. Mary's Editor 

A moratorium imposed last spring suspending all tenure considerations at Saint Mary's was lifted this weekend at the Board of Regents meeting. 
Five faculty members were granted tenure upon the Board's decision, and deliberations have already begun for next year's candidates: Drs. Peter Smith and Don Miller of the Mathematics department, Dr. Eugene Cam­panale of the Education department, Dr. Harold Weiss of Religious Studies, and Librarian Sr. Mercita Lynch. 
College President Edward Henry, who at­tended the Board meeting, noted that thedecision was made by a "unamimous vote" of the full Board. on a recommendation from an executive Board meeting some weeks ago. 
The moratonumwas imposed by the old Board of Trustees at the height of the merger break with Notre Dame. The Board qualified its move at that time by citing the uncertain financial and reorganization future of the college. 
tenure after seven years 

Ordinarily a faculty member becomes eligible for tenure at the end of his seventh year. Credit for time spent at one institution is part of the ''package" an individual negotiates when transfering to another. In accordance with American Association of University Professors <AAUP) rules, the tenured faculty member holds his position until retirement age (65). This is not applicable in instances of professional misconduct, staff cutback due to economic dif­ficulties, or dissolution of department. Mter age 65, the professor may elect additional years of teaching, but then generally receives only one­year contracts which must be re-negotiated each year. · When the moratorium was first imposed last spring, the national AAUP released a statement saying in effect that faculty members couldn't be left in such a state of indecision, and that it was "not an advisable kind of polict." At least two faculty members resigned as a result of the policy. 


Dr. Paul Messbarger: "happy they lifted the moratorium." 
lmoralel a consideration 
Sr. Franzita Kane, executive committee member of the Saint Mary's chapter AAUP, felt that the move to lift the moritorium was an important one for all faculty members, not just those involved in tenure negotiations. 
"Speaking from the viewpoint of both the local and nat10nal AAUP, snf as an individual faculty member, I don't feel that the moratorium was ever necessary," she declared. 
Sr. Kane added that faculty "morale" was a primary consideration of the local AAUP this year and she feels that the lifting of the moritorium will be "a significant boost to that morale." 
President Henry declined to comment ·on the necessity of the moritorium when it went into effect because he was not on campus at the time. However, Dr. Paul Messbarger. former chairman of the faculty assembly, noted that Henry was not persuaded that it should be lifted when he first arrived at Saint Mary's. Henry met 
several times during the summer with present faculty Assembly Chairman Don Miller, and came to support the faculty viewpoint, later using his influence with the Board to have it lifted. Messbarger felt this initial step was a crucial one for executive-faculty relations. 

apprehension to lessen 
Messbarger himself is "happy they lifted the moratorium," and was "never persuaded that it was necessary." 
Miller concurred with Messbarger and added that "to my knowledge, none of the faculty up­ported thPmoratoriumor even saw the necessity for it." He agreed that it would probably in­crease the morale of faculty members. 
Dr. Bruno Schlesinger, faculty representative to the Board, thinks that "apprehension" ap­parent last spring when the moratorium an­nouncement was made will be lessened with its negation. 
"I really can't say if the overall spirit of the acuity will be affected in any way," commented Schlesinger. 
Linnea Vacca, who under the AAUP con­stitution will succeed the chairmanship of the local chapter wiht the illness of Dr. Don Horning, called the move "not unexpected" and "very gratifying," summing up the consensus of faculty opinion. 
"One wonders what the point of it was in the first place," she said.

Previously, the two served on the Associate Board of Trustees, which acted in an advisory capacity to the Board of Trustees. 
"When the Board of Trustees was phased-out this summer," ex­plained Mrs. Robin Hague, Director of Public Information, "so was the Associate Board of Trustees. This was when they incorporated the new Board of Regents." 
This newly created body, Hague continued, is currently in the process of building its mem­bership to forty. Thus, Simons and Shaheen were drafted into the Board of Regents from the Associate Board of Trustees. 
Simons became active in St. Mary's governance while his daughter attended the college, and served with his wife on the Parents' Council for eight years. 
Meanwhile, Shaheen has two daughters enrolled at SMC. 
Looking ahead to his new post in reference to the College's reforms, Simons concluded, "St. Mary's is not without problems, but I'm sure that they'll be worked out."

Optimism reigns at campaign headquarters'

Together with buildings adjacent to and across the street from it, 1700 Pennsylvania i\VPnue constitutes a bloc of power unrivaled in the country ... except, perhaps by that other famous triangle in Washington. the White House-Capital­Supreml' Court complex. 1700 Pennsylvania Avenue fortressesstrategistsand campaign workers trying to negotiate a lease for four mor<' Vl'ars with the American electorate on some· property one block down from the offiee in the 1600 area.

Nixon's headquarters, the only office visible to the general public, is paintPd in gay red and white stripes with ovl'r-sized portraits of the President and banners streaking the walls proclaiming "Nixon Now!" . "Four More Years!" or "RP-Pll'ct the President!"

But. at all three offices, as McTigue said, there is a generation of peace and con­fidence.

McGovern 
By Ann Therese Darin Campus Editor 
Although some pollsters believe a McGovern presidential victory today is "somewhere over the rainbow," few people outside Washington, D.C. know that in reality McGovern's staff is headquartered over the rainbow ... the rainbow painted on the National Headquarters for McGovern­Shriver building. 
While the tone of the campaign is reflected in the colorful, one-story rainbow spanning the third and fourth stories of the building, the color wheel is only a slight. barometer of the optimism contained within the building. 
"We are going to win," said Mary Ann Malfik, a senior at American University in 
Northwest Washington. "Have you seen the latest poll in Michigan? We are only behind by four percent and I think we are going to take Illinois even though they couldn't have the torchlight parade." 
Like many of the young aides stuffing envelopes, answering phones and typing stencils. Mary Ann is a young woman eollege student. She works five hours every day at the K Street headquarters, besides taking fifteen psychology hours at AmPrican and waitressing in the university eafeteria. 
"I think that one of the very things that we thought was going to be our loss has turned out to be a big advantage. We don't have much money. People know that. But they respect us for rhflt we are trying to do because we art.~~~~~;nig to pull the wool over on anyone. Senator McGovern is honest and the people, all over America, will vote for him because of that." 
Behind her, several older aides were sorting campaign contributions which had just arrived in the afternoon mail. Despite the much-publicized analysis that MeGovern strength is coming from coastal states such as New York, New Jersey, and California, most of the multi-colored or pictured checks stacked on the table had Mid western and Mid-Atlantic addresses on 
them. On the first floor, besides the check-


Rathburn and Swartz comment on demise of Faculty Senate 
(continued from page 1) 
Swartz believes that the steering com­
mittee's elimination of a connection bet­
ween the Senate and the Council came from 
the committee's desire, shared by the rest of 
the Council, to prune Council membership. 
The Committee chose to do this in part by 
cutting away its ex officio members, in­
cluding the Senate chairman. 
There is irony in this push for Senate 
dissolution (if the Council adopts the 
steering committee's divorce of Senate and 
Council), said Swartz, "The Senate can't 
dissolve itself. It only exists in the Faculty 
Manual, and only the Academic Council has the power to change that." Therefore, "Only the Academic Council can dissolve the Senate." 

Current Senate chairman Jones declined 
,to comment specifically on the issue of formal Council-Senate relations, pleading 
l

the fact that the Council is now in the process of making its decision but has not 1,yet reached an agreement. 
He did say that he knew there had been "some vague talk" about members resigning or Senate dissolution, but that he "didn't know if people were serious about it."

Kissinger, President Nixon's chief foreign policy advisory. 
Tokyo--Japanese police captured a Janaese hijacker who lives in America and was posing as aChinese when he demanded $2 million and a flight to Cuga.

Second best 

Economists have an obscure theory that is directly applicable to elections. It's called the theory of second best. In political language the theory says that nobody can deliver exactly what he promises because there is no way to figure out exactly what has been delivered. 
The theory of second best is such a 
menace because it wreaks havoc on 
policy decisions. A ntaional leader 
cannot decide, based on the limited in­
formation he possesses what all the ef­
fects of a given policy will be. Fur­
thermore, he cannot assess the relative 
long range and short range effects of a 
given policy. Everyone assumes that 
every politician should attempt to move 
the country closer to total satisfaction. 
What is needed, then, is a tool other than 
policy comparisons to accomplish suc­
cessful selection.

Alternatives 
Now all economists are not pledged to uphold the theory of second best just as one would hope that all voters are not committed to an equivalent sort of in­stitutionalized pessimism. What the theory of second best tells us in an election year is to judge candidates not by policies alone but by goals. It is only by looking at a candidate's particular 
goals  that it becomes  possible  to  cir­ 
cumvent the theory of second be st.  
Today  America  is  making  a  fun­ 

damental choice between two different goals for the country's future. One goal says that the best way to maximize the satisfaction of the American public is to cater to the self-interests of the middle and upper classes. The other says that the goal has to be one of forced equal opportunity. This is perhaps the most real of the choices that America will make today. We can only hope that Americans will use some insight when choosing between these goals.

Halloween '72 
jaseph abell 

So Halloween, 1972 has come and gone, as the Halloweens before it. All Saint's Day, the "white" side of All Hallow's Eve's "black" image, has also gone by, and where do we find ourselves? 
Remember those fun days around the early sixties? Most of us at Notre Dame and St. Mary's were out late (but not too late) at night, going on our annual rounds of collecting various and sundry goodies from friends, neighbors, and anyone else who had something to give. October 31st was a time of finding a goldmine in an abandoned atticful of old masks and other costume materials. It was a time of ripping up Mommy's old and not so old sheets to produ..::e a cemetery-load of ghosts and goblins. It was a time when the most important thing in the world was how realistic you looked and how much stuff you could get in an hour. Itwas a time of fun. 
But it was something else, too. It w·as time of a first-time-ever CfJtllolic president's administration. It was a time of world crisis with thel~ay of Pigs and the Cuban missles. It was a time of the beginnings of strange long-haired group of young men called the Beatles who woutd start a musical revolution, and a time of tragedy as the first United States president in almost 50 years is shot to death. It was a time of change. 
So in ten or eleven years, where have we come? October 31, 1972 is a time of tension. The first presidential election in which the two op­ponents are so diametrically opposed on nearly everything looms in the near future, the oftentimes desperate campaign dominating the front pages of newspapers and magazines. It is a time of peace versus war as the conflict in the Vietnam War suddenly threatens to cease, yet the round peace table remains alone, the peace pacts remain virgins to the necessary signatures. 
It is a time of closer relations to Communist neighbors and more cooperation among the major world powers, and it is a time of greater tensions between the lesser powers, as witness West German release of Arab terrorists stemming from an airline hijack. It is a time when the revolution caused by the British rock group is reaching a musical peak. It is still a time of change. 
But back at home, what has happened? There are no more annual journies on the night of The Great Pumpkin. Parents, terrified by reports of sadisticallyinsane "neighbors" slipping little goodies such as razor blades, Exlax, and powdered glass in Halloween treats, have called a halt to the candy-collecting custom. Parties in the home is now the fashionable thing, with limited collecting. It is a time of fear. 
So that's the progression. A time of fun, a time of change and more change, a time of fear. So much change in so short a time, it almost makes me shudder when I think that I still have around 60 or 70 years left to go. 
It was revealed recently that extensive, feasible plans for installing communications devices in every private home, an effective Big Brother system, broadcasting and spying for the government, had been drawn up and presented to the government. Government of­ficials claim that the documents were rejected, and they probably were; but the fact that they were drawn up, seriously, and presented to agencies who seriously looked it over, points up that perhaps there really is something to the fear that is at the end of the Halloween progression. 
But there's where the 60 or 70 years I have left comfort me. There's so much time to try to change things back to where there's little of the Halloween fear. 
Last week, I voted in my first election. I selected the men I thought would best help turn back that fear. I hope I was right. If I was, next time will come easier. IfI was wrong, I'll vote them out and start over again. 
The progression is not finished; what will Halloween, 1990, see? or even Halloween, 1980? Will there even be an All Saint's Day after it? I don't know. But I do know I'll be in there fighting for it.

We don't make a lot of noise, but this is where it's really happening. You see, a large corporation like Kodak has the resources and the skill to make this world a little more de­cent place to live. And we intend to do what we can to see that this is exactly what happens. 
'Thke our home city, Rochester, New York for exam­ple. We cut water pollution in the Genesee River by using natural bacteria to dispose of unnatural wastes. We cut air pollution by using electrostatic precipitators in a new com­bustible waste disposal facility. We helped set up a black enterprise program in downtown Rochester, and we've been experimenting with film as a way to train both teachers and students-including some students who wouldn't respond to anything else. 
And we didn't stop with Rochester. Kodak is involved in 47 countries all over the world. Actively involved. 

Why? Because it's good business. Helping to clean the Genesee River not only benefits society ... but helps pro­tect another possible source for the clean water we need to make our film. Our combustible waste disposal facility not only reduces pollution ...but just about pays for itself in heat and power production and silver recovery. Our black enterprise program not only provides an opportunity for the economically disadvantaged ... but helps stabilize communi­ties in which Kodak can operate and grow. And distributing cameras and film to teachers and students not only helps motivate the children ... but helps create a whole new market. 
In short, it's simply good business. And we're in busi­ness to make a profit. But in furthering our business interests, we also further society's interests. 
And that's good. After all, our business depends on society. So we care what happens to it.

Pears discusses role of security in students' lives 
by Jim Ferry Staff Reporter 
The Notre Dame Security Director Aurthur Pears met with a group of students last night in the Flanner "Pit" for an informal discussion on the role of Security in the student's life. 
Pears was. initially questioned about why a post-wire fence was located halfway between the towers and the memorial library. The Flanner tower resident said· that many people had been hurt tripping over it and that he could see no purpose for its existence. 
Pears responded that he "saw no reason" why the fence couldn't be taken down and he promised to look into the matter. 
The question of speed bumps on old Juniper Road also came up and opened wider discussion of tran­sportation problems on campus. 
.Pears said that he had recom­mended speed bumps for both the main gate and old Juniper Road, but that the "Traffic and Safety Committee rejected the initial proposal." Pears felt that speed bumps were also needed behind Dillon and Alumni Halls by the golf course. He said that speed bumps "effective" in his own mind. "The proof of the pudding is in the eating; shopping centers use 
them as safety features with great success." 
Pears went on to say that he "wouldn't be too surprised to see the day when no traffic at all will be allowed on campus." He said that White field could be used for employee parking and shuttle buses could take people from­parking areas to specific areas on campus. He used the Michigan State University shuttle-bus service as an example of the 
numerous possibilities available for future consideration. He emphasized that this traffic ban would have to be applied to "all traffic or it will meet with a lot of opposition." 
When asked of the university bicycle situation, he said that one bicycle theft had been reported over the past weekend. He said that approximately 25 bicycles have been stolen since the beginning of the year with a total value loss of about $2500. 
He termed the failure of bicycle registration efforts as "too bad." 
"We had a pretty good program. The Observer and WSND did a tremendous job of publicity for us, but only 60 students bothered to register their bikes. I'd just like to know what it takes to move people." 
Pears expressed concern that

the first big snow will result in a lot of bikes being crushed by snow plows when they clear off the sidewalks. He encouraged students to use available bike racks and not the wire and pole sidewalk fences. 
"New bike racks have been bought for the Towers, Badin, Walsh, and the Architecture Building. Others will be bought when the need arises." 
Pears told of the engraving equipment available from the Security office. 
"We've had little response. For only a $15 deposit, a hall can use one of our engravers and mark social security numbers on stereos, radios, tape decks and all manner of personal property. If the property was stolen, at least we'd be able to identify it. R.A.'s could handle it perfectly. Lar­cency in the dormitories has been nominal this year, some in Morrissey and Fisher. We've been lucky. We feel our theft is down, but larceny and vandalism are still two of our biggest problems." 
A complaint was voiced on university parking policy for football Saturdays. Pears replied that his opinion "wasn't worth a nickel because no one listens." 
·'I don't think that any student should have to pay for parking on a football Saturday after 11:00." 
Pears explained the traffic violations ticketing procedure and emphasized that no group on campus can avoid paying for 
tickets.

Pears felt that if students would register their bicycles and mark their personal effects, the effects of crime on campus would be notably decreased. 
The discussion ended up with Pears recounting a few memorable cases he has en­countered in N.D: Security work. He told of the theft of the film, "The Yellow Submarine," after a Student Government sponsored showing in Washington Hall two years ago. Student Government had to pay $350 for the stolen film. 18 months later, the film was found by county officials southwest of South Bend in a tree. Pears said that he's going to try and get a hold of the film once again.
