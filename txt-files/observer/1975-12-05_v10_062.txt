~--Hesburgb. ans calendar dominates discussion 
by Phil Cackley l.ate Reporter 
l<'r. Theodore Hesburgh, University president, 
spoke last night to a crowd of 250 disenchanted 
students in Grace Hall, responding to questions posed 
by members of the audience largely on the topic of 
next year's calendar. 
llesburgh 's talk was originally to be on the topic of "Notre Dame: Past, Present and Future " It was scheduled several weeks ago by the Grace Hall Cultural Commission. 
The affair turned into what Jack Kasel, cultural 
commissioner for Grace, termed a "monopoly by the 
members of the HPC <Hall Presidents' Council) . " 
He said the "atmosphere was perpetrated and en­
couraged by the HPC." 
l<~arlier in the evening, posters were hung by the II PC at both the dining halls urging students to attend the meeting at Grace to "talk to Fr. Hesburgh about his calendar." . . 
Kasel said the event was planned two and a half months ago and was to be a discussion with members of the hall on topics not related to the calendar. He

Students at the Universfty of Notre Dame will conduct a "laugh in" Friday against a school decision to eliminate the Friday after Thanksgiving as a school holiday, Student Body President Ed Byrne said. It will be held at 1 
p.m. on the steps of the ad­ministration building. 
Byrne explained, "We couldn't think of a better way to explain what happened at the Academic Council that caused them to choose this calendar. By having this laugh-in with the students and the faculty we hope to publically ~how the discontent of the Notre Dame community." 
The event is being called a "laugh-in" because Byrne sees thE situation as being absurd. "It's ridiculous. We think the rationale bPhind the decision is funny." 
TheAcademic Council voted 31-14 in favor of a calendar which limits the break at Thanksgiving to Thursday only with classes held on Friday. The calendar was not included in the student govern­ment survey. 
What Byrne hopes to accomplish aside form indicating discontent 
Today's OBSERVER is the last of this semester. Publication resumes on /anuary 14. 
is to "first encourage parents to send an irate letter" to the Academic Council in opposition of the proposition. 
Byrne described the loose format as beginning with an ex­planation of what apparently happened and hopefully that will spur questions. Byrne also said that University President Fr. Theodore Hesburgh and Fr. James Burtchaell, University Provost, are aware of the "laugh-in" but whether or not they will come is uncertain. 
Secondly, he feels the only way to expect any change and or reconsideration is if the faculty members pressure the faculty representatives since it was the faculty members vote which weighed heavily in the vote for Friday classes. 
Byrne commented on the entire situation by saying "I agree with the editorial which said we 'reached a new height of absurdity' with this calendar. Telling faculty and students to attend classes on that Friday is like trying to stop the wind." 
Byrne hopes that all members of the community who wonder how the council made its decision will come today. 
said he dld not see many people who were from the hall at the talk. Joe Bury, a Grace resident, said he saw "very few people from Grace and the ones who were from Grace were disgusted." He stated that "the HPC used Grace Hall as vehicle for a rap sessior on thecalendar." 
Hesburgh began his presentation by immediately laying aside his prepared ·top1c and opening the floor to questions from the audience because he felt the students were ''more interested in the future than the 
past: or the present." The first questioner asked how much letters from parents influenced the decision on the calendar. Yesterday's Observer said a major reason for the move was that Hesburgh had received "quite a few" letters from parents upset at · bearing the expense of two trips during the semester. Hesburgh resl?onded to this saying that it was "a small potato in a pile of big potatoes," that it was not an influence. A much greater influence, he said, was the issue of having two extended breaks late in the semester,

Others unavailable 
Faculty, students respond 

by Marianne Schulte Staff Reporter 

Faculty and administrators were conspicuously unavailable for comment yesterday in regard to the announcement of the 1976-77 academic calendar by the Academic Council of the University, while student response vehemently expressed itself in a variety of public and private reaction. 
Dr. James T. Cushing, member of the Academic Council and one of the few faculty members willing to offer comment, identified himself as approving of the calendar, which allows a nine.Uay October break but limits the Thanksgiving holiday to one day. 
"At this point, I really do not have much feeling about it," Cushing admitted. "It seems that the students can't make up their minds exactly what they want. 4.fter voting last year in favor of a post-labor day start with no Oc­tober break, 92 per cent of the students now opt again for the pre­Labor day start with long October break and short Thanksgiving 
vacation , although it is very clear that a certain number of class days are essential in the university academic calendar." 
Cushing, whose class attendance policy is not to take attendance, feels that it is up to the individual

student to determine his own 
academic progress. 
"Although I have never taken attendance, I have never cancelled a class either, and next year will be no exception. I will hold class as usual, and it will be up to the in­dividual student to brief himself on the missed lecture," Cushing asserted. "I will not, however, choose to be monarchal and issue a test on that day in order to insure full class attendance." 
Family holiday 

Professor Madonna Kolben­schlag, Associate Professor of American Studies, identified with the students' viewpoint that a one­day break at Thanksgiving is too short, although she feels that a nine.Uay October break slows the learning process in breaking the pace of study. 
"I don't think it follows the human rhythms established by our culture to deprive the community of the opportunity to spend the national holiday at home with their families," Kolbenschlag said. "After all, who really wants to spend Thanksgiving in South Bend?" 
Father Thomas Tallarida, 'the rector of Zahm Hall, reflected the feelings of the hall staffs, who will now have to remain on campus over break, although this year rectors and hall staffs were not obliged to. 
"Although the new calendar allows for an extended October break, Thanksgiving has always been an important time with the family," Tallarida affirmed. "The quality of the two breaks is different. Over October break many of the other family members are scattered in different areas. But at Thanksgiving, all family members come home to spend the holiday together." 
Students stunned 

Junior Class President Rob Tully expressed concern over the shortened October Break and the confusion it creates with the senior class trip to Southern California planned for next year. 
"It's preposterous," Tully argued. "The senior class trip was tentatively being planned to extend 
Burtchaell: stand in favor of a Friday of classes. 
from that Wednesday a'fternoon to Monday, providing University Provost Father James Burtchaell would grant the seniors the extra 
day off. The new calendar puts a clamp on that possibility now -how can we ask for two and a half days off? 
Petition distributed 
A student government sponsored petition is now being organized and distributed by Tom Soma and will be circulated this weekend through the Hall President's Council. The petition states, "We, the un­dersigned students, believe that the Fall semester of the 1976-77 academic calendar should not include the Friday immediately following Thanksgiving as a regular class day." 
Student government is hoping for complete student support Cat least 5000 signatures) of this petition, which will be presented to the Chariman of the Academic Council. Students are urged to make their feelin~s felt. 
The student representatives to the Academic Council felt that their feelings had been disregarded in the decision of the new calendar. Expressing their feelings in a letter to the Observer, they urged all students to write letters and encourage their parents to write letters favoring a Thanksgiving break.

Corrugated town's plans altered j 
by Mark Murphy Staff Reporfer 
Plans to construct a corrugated fiberboard village on the Notre Dame campus have been modified in recent weeks, according to the originators fo the proposal. 
Chuch Canavan, AI Sondej and Hank Miller, directors of the project known as Habitation Conservation <HABICON>, had the proposal submitted to the University Board of Officers on Nov. 20. 
While the board thought HABICON was a sound idea and agreed with the basic concepts, it did not see the feasibility of erecting an entire village and have it inhabitied by Notre Dame students. 
Th~ o~ficers did, however, give permiSSion for the construction of several test structures on University property next semestrer and also all facilities that would be necessary for further 
research. 
The board believed that a working model community belongs at a place which is in need of that 
type of housing. 
"It's not really a disappointment for us," noted Canavan "because it simply means we'll intensify our work in other areas of the 
proposal." 
Miller and Canavan will continue to refine desighn methods of the fiverboard structures which are used for disaster relief housing and for permanent poverty areas. 
The two architecture majors are also further researching aspects of portable methane digester, wind and solar energy. 
But willing to go along with it 
IH<:IRUT, Lebanon <AP) ­Bands of gunmen took over Beirut streets Thursday in a wave of kidnapings that touch­l'd off renewed clashes between Christian and Moslem militias. 
Army commandos killed two armed men in an exchange of fire at Beirut International Air­port. The gunfire spread panic among hundreds of passengers awaiting flights out of the jitte­ry Lebanese capital. 
The renewed violence emp­tied offices and shops. Most Beirut residents fled home, fearing the 10-day-<>ld cease-fire in Lebanon's civil war was heading for collapse. By late afternoon the city was desert­ed. 
Premier Rashid Karami called an emergency meeting of his cease-fire commission consisting of heads of Moslem and Christian private armies, national security chiefs and Palestinian guerrilla leaders. 
A police source said there was increasing evidence militia leaders and guerrilla captains were unable to control their own gunmen, leaving local cease-fire committees pow­erless to halt the abductions. 
More than 17 persons were captured by roaming gangs be­fore nightfall, police reported, adding to the 120 captured overnight. The victims often are held only a short time but sometimes are tortured or killed if their captors believe they have Jinks with opposing forces.

"This is where the University community will play a major part," explained Miller. We're going to need school personnel and facilities for our testing. Having the technical advice and the use of laboratories will aid us tremen­dously." 
The computer is going to play a major role in HABICAN's research along with Andy Joseph, a fifth year architecture student, heading that phase of the opration. 
"The collection of data in the technical, social and physical aspects will be fed into the com­puters to find correlations and get exact test results," Canavan said. 
Once completed, the final design and test results will be made into a presentation to be delivered at the United Nations Habitat Conference in Vancouver, British Columbia 


SMC opposed to calendar 
by Margie lrr St. Mary's Assistant Editor 
Dr. William A. Hickey, St. Mary's vice-president of Academic Affairs stated that St. Mary's administrators are "absolutely opposed'' to the new calendar guidelines approved by Notre Dame Academic Council. 
A proposal given to Fr. James T. Burtchaell, Notre Dame Provost, by Dr. John M. Duggan, St. Mary's president. was "obviously given no consideration," said Hickey. 
The SMC proposal included a post-Labor Day start, a weeklong mid-semester break, a Thanksgiving break. The proposal provided for 68 class days. 
"I attended the Academic Cm~ncil meeting," said Hickey. "I was really surprised that no one presented the proposal or even mentioned St. Mary's position on the new guidelines." 
"St. Mary's will reluctantly go along," said Hickey, though we are very opposed." 
Hickey noted that the question of continued cooperation between St. Mary's and Notre Dame is decided by the calendar. 
Two years ago the fall semester calendars for the two schools were in conflict. St Mary's October break began and ended one day later than that of Notre Damt;. St. Mary's Thanksgivingvacation was two class days longer than Notre Dame's. 
Administrators who approved the 1973-74 calendar were confident that problems with the coexchange program could be easily resolved. Hickey noted, however, that there actually were "multiple problems" in schedules con­cerning exams and rides to and from school. 
''Two calendars would be 

unreasonable," said Hickey. 
The 1973-74 experiment clearly indicated that coexchange and the cooperative departments, such as Education, Speech and Drama and Religious Studies, could not con­tinue under such a calendar, he noted. 
''In the final analysis, this action shows that St. Mary's is more concerned with the cooperative programs and what they are worth, as well as with the students," Hickey commented. 
Hickey said that he understood that transportation for two breaks could get expensive. But more people feel strongly about being at home, with their families at Thaksgi ving. 
"We've debated and we've talked," Hickey said. "The decision has been made. It is an unfortunate decision. One that I am sure that both schools will regret having made." 
Beirut street violence again increases as roving bands of gunmen prevail

Acquaintances said the kid­napers accused Dodge, an oil pipeline executive, of helping smuggle arms to the right-wing Christian Phalange party mi­litia. 
The kidnapers allegedly iden­tified themselves as members of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, but a spokesman for the front denied any connection with the in­cident. 
next May. 
The presentation will hopefully convince disaster relief agencies and even certain countries to use the cellulose fiberboard housing units which are biodegradable, rapidly and inexpensively produced, lightweight and 
durable. 
"If things go as planned, then w'll go directly to fiberboard manufacturers around the world," explained Miller. 
"We'll have exact design and technical information and the companies will simply manufacture the boards to the right specifications." 
AI Sondej of the World Hunger Hunger Coalition sees HAJ!ICON as an educational model for ihe Notre Dame and South Bend communities.

"A liveable/ fiberboard house for a family could be bought for under $100,"Sondej noted, "and a man 

l
earning a $10,000 salary could contribute that much more ro agencies throughout the world which help the poor. I f we are to equally respect the right to life of all people, then we must conserve and share our resources with the poor." 
He said that the board's decision was understandable and noted that, without nay recruitment, twenty people had volunteered to live in the proposed fiberboard village. 
Canavan said that student in­volvement in HABICON would hopefully be very heavy semester. "We've got a lot to do in many different areas and we're going to need as much help as possible in the months ahead," he concluded.

Extremists wage terror actions in Holland 

AMSTERDAM, The Nether­lands <AP> -South Moluccan extremists waged twin terror actions in Holland on Thursday in their struggle for an East In­dies homeland. 
They seized the Indonesian consulate in Amsterdam with 21 children and at least 15 other hostages. Ninety miles to the north, comrades holding a hi­jacked train since Tuesday led 
one of their 38 hostages to the door and shot him. 
The extremists are from among 40,000 natives of the South Molucca Islands of In­donesia who fled or were ex­pelled to the Netherlands since an abortive uprising against Ja­karta rule in 1950, the year after the Dutch granted inde­pendence to Indonesia. 
In a typed message from the Beilen gunmen relayed by a mediator. the Moluccans said, "'We are doing this because the people in the train and the Dutch people did not approach the Dutch government 25 years ago when great injustice was done to our people." The state-

debate on rail 
reorganization 
WASHINGTON <APl -The Senate limited debate Thursday on a multibillion-dollar bill up­grading the nation's railroads and reorganizing seven bank­rupt carriers in the Northeast. 
In a 61 to 27 vote, one more than necessary, the Senate in­
voked cloture and moved the 
r rail bill ahead of legislation aiding New York City. 
r 
The sponsors of the legisation also announced that an attempt
f 
would be made to work out a compromise with the Ford ad­ministration before the legisla­tion was submitted to a vote. 
The administration has threatened to veto the legisla­tion and to call Congress back in a special Christmas session unless substantial changes are made in the proposal.
None of the amendments sub­mitted during the early stages of the Senate debate addressed the administration's objections. 
The President objects to the cost of the measure and op­poses a legal change which the administration says would open the doors of the Treasury for creditors of the seven railroads to be reorganized. 
The rail legislation authorizes $8.5 billion to reorganize the seven railroads and to provide new funding for other railroads to rebuild their track and equipment. It would also pro­vide $1 billion in federal loan guarantees for needy railroads.

HPC accomplishments discussed 
by Pat Cuneo 
Staff Reporter 
Chairman of the Hall Presidents' Council Elton Johnson said Thursday night that his goal at the beginning of this year "was to make students feel that the HPC is their body and they can go to it at any time. As for the Ad­ministration and faculty --to show them that we really represent the students." 
As of this time, evidence is pointing in Johnson's favor. 
"The HPC is designed so that any student can come to us for help but in practical terms we try to eoordinate the 21 dorms the best way we can," cited Johnson. 
One of his first obstacles was the 
redesigning of a completely out­
dated HPC constitution. 
"The only things the old con­
stitution contained were election 
proceedings for the chairman with 
no outlined HPC procedures or 
functions nor defined purpose for 
the body," related Johnson. 
1'\tw constitution drawn up 
The HPC drew up a new con­stitution and also encouraged the separate halls to do so and most of them eomplied. Presently, the council has a file of all the in­dividual constitutions and are completing a master plan for an ideal constitution according to .Johnson. 
In an attempt to solve problems that individual halls could not eonquer on their own, the HPC has appealed to the Student Union to permit them to sponsor movies on camus. 
The Student Union Policy for the last several years has been to disallow halls the opportunity to sponsor films as a money making social function. To help those halls in bleak financialstatus, the HP­C has intervened in an attempt to get the movies and are currently awaiting a decision. 
Rockne trophy established 

On a brighter side, the HPC has established the Rockne Trophy, a traveling trophy presented each month to the hall that has spon­sored the most activities outside or within the hall for that month. The winner for September was Lewis Hall. The October and November winners have bot yeat been named. A panel of three judges, consisting of Dean Roemer, Assistant Provost Dr. Burke and Fr. Robert Griffin collaborate on the decision. 
The HPC has aslo developed the idea of the "HPC Roundtable" which is a set of meetings between hall presidents, vice-presidents, selective section leaders and commissionsers. 
With a purpose of providing a better input among dorm students, the first meeting will be held in January. 
An insurance seminar to inform 
students on "all aspects of life 
insurance and other policies" is in 
operation now. 
Prudential representative Andy Huff will be at Breen-Philips Hall this Sunday and at a south quad hall next week to discuss in­surance. Next semester they plan to cover every dorm according to Johnson. 
Alcohol guidelines 

Alcohol guidelines were also extablished by the group as well as every individual hall. The plans have not yet been officially published but the package coin­cides with the University policies ..

"We just want to recognize the football program and arouse en­thusiasm in it," stated Johnson. "Similar plans for interhall hockey are being considered," offered the chairman. 
A series of match-up meetings are being arranged between various student leaders and (their administrative counterparts. These meetings involve as examples, the Judicial Board Charimen with Dean Roemer; social commissioners with student activities department; and sports commissioners with the interhall office. 
Yet the HPC is not designed to be a social organization. As Johnson puts it, "We encourage the halls to initiate their own activities. If they fail in the task, we will be forced to step in but so far it hasn't hap­pened and hopefully it never will." 

Senator ]avits to speak Monday 
by Gregg Bangs Senior Starr Reporter 

Jacob K. Javits, senior U.S. Senator from New York will give a lecture in the Hayes-Healy Center, Monday Dec. 8, at 1 p.m. 
Javits, who was Invited to speak by the Business School, is in his fourth senate term and twenty­eighth conse~utive year in elec~ed office. He 1s currently the semor Republican on the Committee on Labor and Public Welfare, the Joint Economic Committee and the Select Committee on Small Business. He also serves on the Senate Foreign Relations Com­mittee and the Committee on 
Government Operations. 
In recent years, Javits has 
become an outspoken critic on U.S. 
defense policies. He was the first 
member of Congress to propose legislation which would return to the Congress control of the com­mitment of U.S. armed forces to hostilities in the absence of a formal declaration of war. In an effort to assert responsibility equal to that of the President in regards to policy on war, he authored the War Powers Act. This was passed into law in 1973 as the War Powers Resolution over Presidential veto. 
In addition, Javits is known for legislative accomplishments in fields as diverse as health, civil rights, small business, labor, fiscal policy, the arts and humanities, and foreign economic policy. 
He started his career as an elected political official in 1946 when he became the first Republican since 1923 to be elected to the House of Representatives from the traditionally Democratic 21st District of New York City. In 1954, he became Attorney General of New York~ State a position he would hold for two years before running successfully for the Senate against then New York City mayor, Robert Wagner. Since then, he has turned back the challenges of James Donovan, Paul O'Dwyer and Ramsey Clark. His largest margin of victory was 1,119,077 votes over O'Dwyer in 1968. 
Javits has acquired a reputation for not only being an active sen a tor, but being one of the best vote-getters ever in New York State. Part of the reasons for his success is Javits' political make­up. He is a Republican, which caters to the upper New York State vote, as well as big business. However, he is also a Jewish Liberal which makes him im­mensely popular in New York City.

When someone drinks too much and then drives, it's the silence that kills. Your silence. 
It kills your friends, your 


relatives, and people you don't even know. But they're all people you could save. 
If you knew what to say. maybe you'd be less quiet. Maybe fewer people would die. 
What you should say is, ''I'll drive you home." Or, "Let me call a cab." Or, "Sleep on my couch tonight." 

Don't hesitate because vour friend may have been drinking only beer. Beer and wine can be just as intoxicating as mixed drinks. 
And don't think that black coffee will make him sober. Hlack coffee never made anyone sober. Maybe it would keep him awake long enough to have an accident. But that's about all. 
The best way to prevent a drunk from becoming a dead drunk is to stop him from driving.

InPIRG publishes new consumer handbook 
by Pat Cuneo 
Staff Reporter 
The Indiana Public Interest 
Research Group at Notre Dame 
and St. Mary's <INPIRG) has 
published a consumer handbook 
and an up-to-date newsletter which 
will be distributed to the campuses 
next week. 
INPIRG met recently to finalize the distribution and report several of their state and local research projects. 
Representative Dave Carlyle said thetopics covered in the consumer survey include off-campus housing 
(apartments l. grocery stores, record stores, utility companies, bank checking services, etc. 
Approximately 3,000 copies of the survey have been published as an aid to the students, according to Carlyle. 
A state-wide finance center 
study is also being covered by 
INPIRG. Several finance 
companies in the state have 
charged up to 20 per cent interest 
rates on loans to low-income 
groups and INPIRG hopes to 
uncover the offenders through 
court li tiga lion. 
lnPIRG member Tom Martiny said that a sample loan will bet taken out by the research group so they can experience the com­panies· procedures. 
Along the same line, members are investigating the Educational Testing Service <ETS> which compiles the answers for SAT, LSAT and similar testing programs. 
Martiny pointed out that 30 to 60 point acceptt>d · esling margin will h< Pxamined to ascertain its validity. This means to say that a stud('nt achieving a score of 510 on a sec·tion of th< test will not be re­cvaluat<>d th<· following year if he achieves a score of 480 or 540 on sanw test. 
Martiny explained, "to benefit coll<ge, graduate and high school students, we want to find out how the testing programs can claim a specified margin of performance when the students' academic future is at stake."

"My whole life has been do­nuts," says the 300-pound pro­duction manager of a factory that turns out 4 million clunkers a week. 
"When I was eight years old I was washing and greasing pans in my grandfather's small bakery in Jacksonville <Fla.)," he recalls. "By the time I was 16 I had learned the business and was turning out 200 dozen handmade donuts a day.

Mardi Gras raffle tickets now being sent to halls 
by Ken Bradford Copy Editor 

Raffle tickets are now being distributed in Notre Dame residence halls in preparation for the 1976 Mardi Gras. 
Tickets will be distributed in dormitories at St. Mary's sometime before the Christmas break, according to ticket chair­man Peggy Foran. Off-campus students, staff members and ad­ministrators may pick up ticket books from Foran or Mardi Gras chairman Harry Spellman. 
Mardi Gras will open Jan. 30 in Stepan Center and will last until the raffle on Feb. 8. The grand prize for the drawing will be a 1976 Nova purchased by the committee from Gates Chevrolet in South Benrl. Persons who sell a book of raffle tickets will be eligible in a :-;tudent drawing to win a color t l'ievision. 
I<:ach Mardi Gras raffle book contain:-; ten tickets, which sell for one dollar each. Students will receive two dollars back for each hook of I ickets they sell. 
Each residence hall is also assigned a quota of ninety books for every hundred residents. Halls which meet their quotas will receive five dollars back from each book sold. The money returned to the halls may be used for any hall activity, Spellman said. 
The sale of one book also entitles the seller to a free Mardi Gras button which admits the person to Mardi Gras all week without an admission fee. 
Proceeds from Mardi Gras are donated to the Notre Dame Charities, which include the Hunger Coalition, Sr. Maritia's Day School, Boys' Town and other

Mardi Gras will have a bicen­tennial theme this year. Booth designers may choose any period of American history as a basis for their decorations, according to Foran. "They can work with the theme as loosely and creatively as they like," she said. 
Residence halls and campus clubs may erect booths and operate various card games, roulette wheels and other games of chance. Betting is done with Mardi Gras play money which can be exchanged for cash. 
Organizations wishing to operate Mardi Gras games must submit booth designs and floor plans to the Mardi Gras committee before Christmas, Spellman said. The committee supplies wood and building materials, but each organization must build its own booth. Also, a 100 dollar deposit, a portionof which will be refunded, must be placed by each organization, he added. 
A meeting for all persons working on Mardi Gras booths will be held in Stepan Center on Jan. 16. Actual work will begin Jan. 17. 
Spellman said he is expecting bigger crowds this year due to an improvement in the national economy. He added that he hopes more South Bend residents will visit Mardi Gras this year. He cited Mardi Gras as an opportunity for improved interaction between the South Bend community and Notre Dame. 
"It's a real big social event," Spellman said, "and everyone is going to have a good time."

Mark Arminio is one of those fighting 'optimists' of Notr£Dame. 
As station manager of WSND radio, he has been working to eliminate the misconceptions people in the Notre Dame com­munity have about the station. On · the air with WSND since his freshman year, Arminio has already given momentum to station activities since assuming his new responsibilities as station manager last April. 
Asked to estimate the size of the WSND listening audience, Arminio responds, "Your guess is as good as mine. We have heard that our audience is only five per cent of the Notre Dame community. Other sources say about 45 per cent. The station is not getting the proper feedback from the community which it serves." 
The new station manager identifies and explains the par­ticular dirriculty WSND faces. "There are so many different audiences at Notre Dame that it is extremely difficult to satisfy all tastes with one radio station," he states. "Still, we've been trying to incorporate as many types of music as possible into our present format and it's not working. At present it all depends on the in­dividual D .J. This is why the whole station sound varies from hour to hour as different programmers come on and go off the air." 
He would like to see certain 
programmers grouped together 
during certain time slots to avoid 
this problem. He proposes that, 
"the 'mellow sounds' go on in the 
morning from 7 a.m. untilll a.m., 
the top-forty and other request 
music from noon until 6:30 p.m., 
and the 'progressive rock' from 7 
p.m. until midnight." The dif­ficulty in establishing this type of rigid format is that the people who work at WSND also go to school," Arminio says. "Certain persons will inevitably be unable to be at the station at certain times and since programmers are not always available to pre-program the music, the present format is almost necessary to continue diversified programming." 
Arminio cites another station difficulty as what he terms "good radio vs. good music." Given discrepencies in individual tastes, the question of who to satisfy is a tough policy decision. He gives examples of the situation saying, "Suppose a member of the listening audience wants to hear cuts from albums that cater specifically to the die-hard Led Zeppelin fan. Such cuts are usually long and often obscure to the general audience who would prefer to hear, let's say, 'Stairway to Heaven'. Programming to appeal to the largest audience is requisite in good radio," he ob­
served. 

Another aspect WSND must deal with is competition with area radio stations. Arminio criticizes the programming of local stations. 
"The biggest rock station in this area is lousy compared to what other stations in other areas have to offer. But if that is what people want to hear we'll put it on," he confesses. 
Arminio encourages all listeners to let the station know what type of music they want to hear. He wxplains, "Every request which is phoned into the station is recorded as to the name of the record, the artist, time of day requested, and whether or not the station had the time or the record available to get it on the air. Every two weeks the results are compiled and then the process is repeated and will continue to be repeated until a pattern is discovered on which to base a new format." The manager states the station's position saying, "We won't change for the sake of change. We want to do this right." 
In a final statement on con­ditions which complicate matters for WSND, Arminio levels sharp criticism at the University itself. "The station suffers because we don't have a ready acceptance from the University and the University knows it."

This parking lot will be locked, according to Pears. The lot will be patrolled by an officer on foot at least once each hour for 24 hours a day. 
Another area of security in­volves students who own bicycles. Students shoud use the Security's winter storage policy to insure the safety of their bikes. Bikes will be stored in the stadium for the winter period. This policy involves no charge · the bike is registered and a $1.00 fee if it is not. The policy covers all four years and the bikes are completely insured. Bike storage begins today and again on Dec. 11, 12, and 15 at Gate 14 of the Stadium. The hours of storing are from 1-4:30 p.m. 
Students with bicycles are urged not to lock them to cables along the campus sidewalks. This is not only for security reasons. It is also to prevent the repeat of last year's incidents involving bikes being damaged by snow plows clearing

Christmas Every Day 
iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiijoe corpora 
Thanksgiving is over. It's December. The campus is taking on a Christmas atmosphere -lights in campus windows, a Christmas tree here and there. Besdies finals, people are also talking about Christmas. 
Christmas is a time which brings out the best in people. All over the world the best comes out. It is a time of peace and JOY and love. Christmas is a time of community more so than during any other time of the year. _ 
Here at Notre Dame and St. Mary's we have Christmas every day. The people here are whwhat really make Notre Dame the unique and special place that it is. I think that you can go the world over and you won't find as many good people concentrated in one area such as you find at Notre Dame and St. Mary's. 
What makes Notre Dame so much different from all the rest? I think that it is a strange combination of the administrators, faculty, staff and us --the student body. I have not had the chance to visit tons of other colleges and universities, but I have visited some and know people who go to many more. At the ones I visited I could not detect any real soirit. any real sense of christian community, 
There may be other schools which are better academically and intellectually than we are; there may even be some with better sports. But I don't think there are any schools with a better spirit, a better community than exists here. 
Two weekends ago Notre Dame hosted the National Conference on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism. I was involved with it and also put up seven of the participants in Holy Cross Hall. Most were either the Student Body President or Vice President of their schools. In talking with them I realized ever more how great this place is. They were all from large, impersonnal, secular cam­puses. All their student governments are presently involved in or have been involved in taking the president of their respective to court for something. 1t seems to be such a cold, heartless at­mosphere. I couldn't detect the sightest hint of warmth or com­passion in these schools. 
When I was at the University of Pittsburgh for the game., I wanted to try an experiment. I was in the Cathedral of Learning <the Dome Building of Pitt) and I asked seven people where the Chancellor's office was. No ONE KNEW. They said they'd never seen him. Here at Notre Dame Father Hesburgh, C.S.C. although he travels alot is extremely accessible when he is here. If you are walking by the Administration Building in the middle of the night and see a light flickering on the third fooor, that's him. Many times I have called or dropped by at 3:00a.m. to see Father Hesburgh about something. 
Our halls are unique. The students make them great. Almost nowhere else are the residents of a dorm so proud of the dorm they live in as here. Friendships begin here in the dorms that last forever. When I was at Purdue for the game, I remember being in a room where people did not even know who lived next door to them.lt is like living in an apartment building. Everyone keeps their door locked. It is a real cold atmosphere. It is my experience that this is not at all true here. Sections are closely united, as are floors, making the darm at times one big family. 
~~f~, 
I could go on and on. But I say that 'Christmas occurs everyday at Notre Dame, because it is really a special place. The best in people is brought out daily. It is a place of peace and joy and love and Christian communityjdaily. We don't have to wait til December for this. Ithappens all the time. 
My thanks to all of you who make Norre Dame what it is. Merry Christmas and Happy New Year.

You Shouldn't Have 
P.O. Box Q 
Reps Reply 
Dt'ar Editor: 
We, the undersigned student representatives to the Academic Council and members of the Academic Commission, feel we owe the student body an account of the proceedings during Wed­nesday's Academic Council meeting regarding next year's calendar. 
After two months of research and preparation, after drawing up a calendar acceptable to a majority of the students, we, as well as many fellow students, 
feel our feelings have been disregarded. 
Our proposals for new guidelines were enhanced by strong student support. Ninety-two percent of those students surveyed favored the midsemester break, which we obtained, but we ourselves, and most of the student body, never expected a shortened Thanksgiving break. The thought of classes on that Friday is so outrageous that it never occurred to us; neither did it appear on any of the sample choices, but ap­parently the thought appealed to the faculty and administrators on the Council. 
The council devoted only minor attention to Proposal C, the decisive choice of the 300 students surveyed. Since the calendar met all the requirements delineated by the University guidelines, and since it was the obvious choice of nearly 50 per cent of those un­dergraduates surveyed, then why wasn't it given more serious consideration? 
We would therefore like to take this opportunity to say that we, as your student representatives, are aware of these shortcomings and are prepared to do everything in our power to effect a change. We urge you to inform your parents of this flagrant disregard of student representation, and to encourage their writing of J?ro-Thanksgiving break letters, addressed to 
AdmiJ'llstrauon 
Furthermore, we urge you to attend this afternoon's student gathering for strong students support is our best chance for invoking any change in next year's proposed calendar.

Congrats 
Ut'ar Editor: 
I would like to congratulate the 
Academic Council for coming up 
with the joke of the year. 
Seriously, a one-day break for 
Thanksgiving? I rolled on the floor 
with laughter until I found out that 
it actually is the planned calendar 
for next year. 
Almost everyone agrees that a 
mid-semester break is vital, but I 
do not believe that the students 
should have to give up 
Thanksgiving with their families to 
get a break in October. <Wouldn't 
it be better to have a long week~nd 
for the mid-semester break 
coupled with the usual 
Thanksgiving break?> 
Fr. Hesburgh reported that he 
received quite a few letters from 
parents who were upset that they had to pay the expense of two trips. This is absurd. It is not man­datory for the students to go home on every break. If there were two breaks, the students could choose to stay on campus for the mid­semester break and go home for the Thanksgiving break. Now, however, the Academic Council has prohibited students from going home on Thanksgiving, regardless nf whether or not they can afford it. 
It also is rumored that the Friday after Thanksgiving will be a mandatory test day in order to discourage students from cutting classes that day. If everyone had a test on Friday, the students will spend all day Thursday studying for them. Mandatory tests will simply turn Thanksgiving, a supposedly free day, into a study day. I don't think anyone wants that to happen. 
Finally, I call upon the Student Government to take another survey, containing one question: "Are you in favor of the proposed calendar for next year?" 
On behalf of all of my fellow students, I urge the Academic Council to reconsider the calendar topic.

Childish Games 

Dear Editor; 
Being only a Freshman, I came to this University with the idea that it was an excellent school with high academic standards and a proud tradition behind it. Realizing these facts, I took for granted that it would be run by intelligent people. But un­fortunately I have had to change my opinion of the administration after observing a number of their actions over the first three months of my Notre Dame career. In particular the recent action in the formation of next year's calendar. Now I don't claim that I'm as scholarly as Fr. Burtch a ell or as world-renowned as Fr. Hesburgh, but there is one asset that I do have that these two obviously do not, that is, common sense. 
As I see it, the Administration is 
playing the same kind of childish 
games that hii,h school ad­
ministrators love to play. They 
pretend to let the students have a 
voice in the decision-making on 
school oolicies but in actualitv thev 
ignore whatever opinions the students voice. As evidence to this point I present the fact that the calendar chosen for the next school year was not even one of the six choices presented to and voted on by the student body! 
Ac­tually, I am quite surprised at Fr. ­esburgh 's stand because of a statement he made whil saying mass in Zahm Hall. He said that the greatest thing be could do with the students at N.D. was to celebrate mass with them. With this in mind, he should realize that the greatest thing we could do on Thanksgiving is to celebrate a mass with those whom we love and who deserve the most thanks, that is, our families. This will be ex­tremely hard to do if they're home and we're here at N.D.

Returns 

Dear Editor: 
Thif school is finally putting its cards on the table and showing for whom it is established. Traditionally, a university has been for the education growth and development of its students. But Notre Dame, being in the forefront of education, has fulfilled this role by bringing about a revolution in education! No longer will the University be shackled to the needs of students! Students are now here for the needs of the UniversitY!

and administration gets a 
Thanksgiving break but not the

philosophy of education, that fits 
right in). 
When the University proclaims 
its responsibility as being "In Loco

about that concept. Even to the 
extent of kindly taking the 
responsibility out of the parents 
hands for saying "No, we can't 
afford to fly you home." Catholic 
educators have long insisted they 
cannot take parental 
responsibility. Itsheartening to 
see the University expose that as a

It occured once in Domeland To the populace there That a Provost named Grinchaeli Was mean as a bear. 
He hated Thanksgiving The feasting and all With a heart that was surely Three sizes too small. 
On a gold-tipped mountain In the center of town, The Grinchaell would perch With a distained frown As the Domers would party And dance with glee, He'd say, "I hate Thanksgiving And roasted turkey!" 
"I wonder what means of Deception to take I fouled them last year with an extended break; 
"But that wasn't good enough, What can I do now? To get them at last! Let me think how." 
So he sat and he thought 
And then it occured! 
"I'll steal Thanksgiving And rip off the bird!" 
"I'll sneak into town In tht' dead of the night And steal the turkey When its out of their sight." 
"U I steal the turkey 
They won't have their feast! And there won't be Thanksgiving! Oh, aren't I a beast?!" 
So the night before Turkey-day The Grinchaell slank into town And took the turkey and dressing When no one was around. 
He went back to the Dillon And started to smirk. Hut was he successful With his treacherous work? 
But the story's not ended We must wait and see If they'll steal back Thanksgiving And get the turkey! ! ! ! !

Letters to a Lonely G 
louer of urchins and all that 
Even a dear old priest like me, lover of urchins and all that, can recognize that the gleam in the eyes of a child at Christmas is sometimes neither holy nor beautiful, being nothing more or less than the twinkle of greed. The Santa Claus myth does a rotten thing to kids, turning some of them into grasping little gnomes who are the masterpieces of selfishness. The kids don't corrupt themselves, of course; it is the parents who corrupt the kids, using credit cards, charge accounts, Christmas bonuses, family savings, bank loans, home mortgages. grandfather's inssurance, and a house wife's virtue to keep alive the notion that there is a stout gentleman from the North Pole who gives stuff away free. 
I had a friend who once decided he would teach his little brood of moppets that Christmas. was a game of giving gifts, not receiving them. On Christmas morning, he explained to them , there would be a pile of gifts under the tree for each child. These gifts could be unwrapped in the traditional way; but they were not to be kept or taken off to the nursery. Instead, 
would drive the children to the poor 
neighborhoods where they could give away the toys and treasures to the street arabs they would meet there. Later, when the family returned home, each child would receive a gingerbread man as her own Christmas keepsake. 
The moppets were good-natured about the arrangement, although the littlest girl had difficulty in understanding why she could not keep the doll that Santa had left with her name on it. Fortunately, the doll was too big for her to be comfortable with, 
so it had not yet become a favorite. At 
noonday on the Nativity feast, the family 
rode in a station wagon stuffed with gifts to 
an unprosperous neighborhood, where 
they quickly found a long line of raggedy­
muffin slum kids (so it seemed> waiting to 
get into a theatre to see 101 Dalmations. 
As soon as the moppets started handing 
out dolls and drums to those sedate pat·­
rons of the cinema, those slum kids, having 
survived their moment or two of initial 
skepticism, were turned into a pushing, 
shoving mob. 
This was no gentle sharing of the blessings of wealth. Children were giving away a Christmas that they wanted to keep to other children who were passionatley eager to accept gifts; and in their excitement, the benificiaries became insistent enough to frighten the gift­bearers. The poorer children were not of the beggar class; they had a pride, a dignity, a decency and honor that should spare them from being looked down upon.

For Heller, Bellow, Fowles, Updike and Hersey, their appearance on lists of the year's best fiction is not new, but for the remaining five writers, their emrgence from literary obscurity has placed them in comfortable positions to do battle with our established literary institutions (such as Nabokov, whose Look at the Harlequins! was also a best-seller and a celebrated work of the year).

Besides the works of notable fiction, 1975 was also an exellent year for the publication of formerly unrevealed letters by such various writers as Steinbeck, Wollf, James and Wharton. These letters added much to our personal understanding of each of the authors, but the reason for their oversight in the past has much to do with their current publication: they describe, for the most part, the sexual lives of our literary giants. 
One of the most publicized occurances this season in the realm of contemporary fiction was Agatha Christie's retirement of Poirot in Curtain.

came to pick them .....

Felhm reaches a sort of miniscus in this film, just about ready to overflow in emotion, but not quite. Beautiful photography, superb production. . . ,
A Brit'( Vacation-One of the f1Ims I d1dn t see. But reliable sources told me that it was a fine, fine movie. In a year w~en I'm having a hard time coming up w1th ten films to pick as tops, I can't pass by a good one just because I didn't get around to seeing it. Tht' llav o( The Locust-John Schlesinger, Director of Midnight Cowboy, told with an emphasis on the lives that were twisted the­re.

You know how to recognize a true and incurable movie fan? Sit him down in front of a screen. Tell him he's never heard of. If he agrees, no questions asked, he's a prime specimen of that species of huff that purelv enjoys movies for . their own sake. Your most devoted servant places herself in that category and offers a smattering of films seen recently that would appeall to this genus of movie-goer. 
The CAC should be commended for pfforts nsulting in a first-rate semester. Anyone who enjoys enveloping mysteries must see Jack Nicholson's performance m "Chinatown" and Gene Hackman in Coppola's "The Converstation" Both are Pxcelll'ntthrillers, great escapes and well-
trying to get a look at a big movie idoL Death Race 2000-Most people don't even know that this movie exists, but I contend that it will become a "cult classic," like Night or the Living Dead, andTexas Chainsaw Massacre. The Death Race i a cross-country speed trip run by the government to keep the people happy. Drivers get points by injuring, maiming, and killing people along the way with their death machines. The feebler the victim and the more creative the death, the more points. One guy gets points forbackingup over his pit crew, another by running over the "high priest" of the race. The kind of movie you'll wait up for till four in the morinng for once you've seen it. Love and neath-One of these days I'm going to get around to writing a letter to Woody Allen and letting him know that Diane Keaton just doesn't cut the mustard. 
Aside from her wooden presence, this is Woody Allen's most sustained and witty movie yet, and a definite sign of better things to come yet. Perhaps next time he might take on two more serious topics. 
Nashville-On second thoughts, I bet a lot of critics will take back some of the outrageously good things they said about 
produced films. The Bergman Festival was highly successful and a move tht I hope will set a precedent for future semesters--"Scenes from a Marriage" is one of the most poignant and meaningful films I've ever seen. Bergman at his finest which is the finest. 
"Farewell, My Lovely' is not a great film, but is is technically one of the best I've ever seen. Mitchum at his best. 
"The Homecoming", written by Harold Pinter, was a bizarre but very interesting soap-opera inversion, one shot laughter, one shot horror, in the best absurdist tradition. Excellent acting in this classic about a family seeking a mother-figure. 
PBS's "Cassie Theatre" featured Ib­sen's "Hedda Gbbler" last month, a stark and passionate drama about a woman starving for power and self-assertion in a society which denies her both. Janet Suzman plays a powerful leading role and

Anyway, this is a great movie and the best one even made and Robert Altman is God, and these are the best actors in the world and the Bible isn't as complex as this script. I liked it a lot; it gave Lily Tomlin a chance to act and gave Ronee Blakely a chance to meet Dylan. 
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest-I've only seen a few scenes from this, some in previews and some on talk shows, but it looks to be a fiercely captured rendition of Ken Kesey's great novel. Jack Nicholson treads the fine line between reality and illusion in his portrait of Randall McMurphy, and a lot of the people making the film thought towards the end that he was going crazy.

A Woman Under the lnriuence-This movie was released in 1974, and by rights shouldn't be on this list, but I'm putting it here because 1) it was a bad year for movies and 2) no one started paying at­tention to it until this year. John Cassavetes has a unique style of direction. based entirely on the actors finding their way to the audience.

Here we have a comic tribute to the old horror films which. in perfect tribute, is funnier after you've see it than when you're watching it-just like the old time horror films.

It's one of my all­time favorites. Are there any of us <the incurables> left anymore? Personally, I detest realism. 


What makes an album a "Best of the Year" choice':''Is it one that is popular; or one that is different? Since music itself is incredibly diversified, the taste in music can only bethesame, so a list will never satisfy everyone, or anyone for that matter. The following list probably excludes some very fine recordings, but the selections present all show some degree of diversification, competence, innovation and of course, fine music. 
gregg bangs 
Billy Cobham--Spectrum 
The ex-John McLaughlin drummer is making innovative strides in modern jazz with every album he turns out. 
Chick Corea--Return To Forever 
Corea, like Cobham, Herbie Hancock and Chuck Mangione ,is making modernistic jazz very popular these days. Corea presents his product a little better than most. 
Crosby & Nash--Wind On The Water 
This is the best effort to come out of the remnants of the supergroup, CSNY. As usual. thevocals are excellent, but there is some fine writing and back-up musicians to go along with it. Very pleasant listening.
Dan l<'ogelberg--('apturt'd Angel 
A personal favorite. Fogelberg is a versatile writer-singer-musician. He sometimes gets marred in sentimental lyrics, but his vocals and ove~all "listenability" make this an attractive album. Watch for Fogelberg in the future. 
John Fogerty--John Fogerty 
J .F. was Creedence Clearwater Revival. After a long lay off, he has come back with an album in which he did 
everything officiall) He shows off talent on both guitar and saxophone. Good solid rock in' --good to have him back. Bruce Springsteen-Born To Run 
Regardless of all the hoopla both pro and con, this is still a fine album. Springsteen and the E Street Band offer a listener a totally different style of music then proceed to pound it out over your head. Stay with it. Steely Dan-Katy Lied 
The Dan has never turned out a bad album, which is more than most current groups can boast. Walter Becker and 
Donald Fagen collaborate to turn out the strangest lyrics this side of Guadalajara. 
In Gary Katz and Roger Nichols, they have the best production team in the music industry. 
James Taylor--Gorilla 

Unlike past albums, this has an op­timistic air about it. All songs are written and performed well, especially "Mexico." 
"Best or" Albums 
It seems as if everybody, whether they deserve it or not, has a "best of" album out now. The ideal "best of" album would be one which is able to present an accurate account of a group's work without falling into a "most popular 45's" rut. For this reason, the best of the "best of's" .are The Very Best or Poco and The Best OF Carly Simon. Poco's two disc set is a good representation of a fine, but unfortunatley unknown, country-rock group. 
Best Group--Eagles Best Single--"Miracles" Best Female Vocalist--Linda Ronstadt 
with Bonnie Raitt on her tail. Best Male Vocalist--Dan Fogelberg Mediocre Award--Elton John Comeback Award--Marty Balin, Pure 
Prairie LeagueHowdy Time Concert Award--Eagles in .llrsey City, Springsteen in N.Y. & Chicago 
Speaking of ''best of's", best of luck on finals and have a good year.

Fleetwood Mac emerged from personnel changes, management hassles, and stale recordings to release one of the finest lp's of the year, Fleetwood Mac. The group was bolstered by the addition of a couple of new members, throaty vocalist Stephanie Nicks and singer-guitarist Lindsey Buckingham, who contributed a half of the material for the new album. However, it was Christine MeVie's development as a singer and songwriter that lifted the album from the ranks of the rest, especially with "Say You Love Me" and "Over My Head" which is finally realizing some deserved AM airplay. Sparkling has been the consensus on their live performances and I hear they still play "The Green Manilishi.'' 
Jefferson Starship has emerged from the veritable dregs to perform and also produce a noteworthy album, Red Oc­topus. While the term "Balin is back" is a cliche by now, the man Marty, if not rescuing the group from oblivion certainly put them in the spotlight with "Miracles" the first bona-fide hit single since, well, "White Rabbit." 
Perhaps my favorite album of the current year was "Old and in the Way." The only release of what was basically a touring band, the album offers bluegrass with a touch of the modern, featuring veteran country fiddler Vassar Clemens, Dead guru Jerry Garcia on banjo, Peter <Panama Red) Rowan on guitar, David Grisman on mandolin, and John Kahn on string bass. The instrumentation is marvelous and the vocals, while sometimes a little ragged make up for it in slickness and style. 
w.s. nichols 
"Nightrillt'rs" 
If you want to find some really good, gil­down Southern boogie, look no further than Charlie Daniels and his magic fingers. If the CDB can't get you rockin' into a frantic sweat, then somebody should unplug your respirator! 
' "Nothin' Fancy" 
Heartwood was a little-known Southern band that put out the best country-rock album of early 1975. Clean, fresh vocals coupled with some well-written songs and Joe McGiohan's pedal steel and sax made it a real winner. Unfortunately, the life on the road was too much for them and the band broke-up in late summer. The album is on the GRC label-good luck in finding it. I'm taking real good care of mine. 
"Walking Shoes" Randall Bramblett is the premier saxophonist in Macon Ga., and some of his friends and he decided to show the rest of the world just why his is number one. They did a good job of showing us in 
"Walking Shoes". Watch for this man, he's coming up the ladder real fast. 
"Riding High" 

If you like cowboy hats, Lone Star Beer, pickup trucks and wide open spaces, then Jerry Jeff Walker is the man for you. Even if you've never been further south than Indianapolis, JJ Walker will make you feel like you're in good ole 'Awstin Texas, sippin' a brew. He's an unadulterated , plain-singing Country and Western singer with one desire -to have a good time. That's what you'll have too. 
"Hiow by Blow" 

Far and away, the best album to cross the Atlantic this year, Jeff Beck can be proud of his achievements in this album. This is the kind of rock n' roll that can roll on all night long. One things for sure, Beck is one hell of a guitarist. 
BEST SONG: "High Falls" -Allman Bros. Band 
ACT Nov. 1 

It was almost a tossup between this and Marshall Tucker. But I've never left a concert in such astate asI did Nov. I. The whole show was Ian Anderson. Never before have I seen such a total performer. His mastery of the flute is incredible! And his showmanship! A humorist, satirist, and acrobat all rolled up in one. The other members added to the dynamic energy of the performance greatly. Seemingly 
flawless performance of extraordinary compositions provided for a totally superb show. With all that electricity on stage at one time, one more infinitessimal in­tegration into the show would have wasted my musical mind for good. To be honest, all around me, myself included, were stunned by the musical display of that night.

Bombs explode ·in Miami 

MIAMI (AP) -Bombs ex­ploded here Thursday at two government offices, including the Police Department, as se­curity was tightened after four explosions Wednesday in other government offices. 
Bombs exploded at four fed­eral buildings and a bank Wednesday night. Blasts set off Thursday afternoon damaged a police locker room and a coun­ty justice building men's room near a state prosecutor's office. 
The blasts caused only one minor injury and minor dam­ages. They were the latest in a string of explosions in the past 18 months in Miami, where large numbers of Cuban exiles are interested in Cuban-U.S. re­lations.

The discussion touched on In­diana politics and Nixon's views of President Ford and former California Gov. Ronald Reagan, who is challenging Ford for the 1976 Republican nomination. 
At the time, however, Land-grebe refused to give specifics on what was said. 
He did say Nixon, who car­ried Indiana in all three of his presidential campaigns, was "vitally interested" in next year's Republican primary battle between Indianapolis Mayor Richard G. Lugar, for­mer Gov. Edgar D. Whitcomb and former GOP State Chair­man Charles O.Hendricks for the U.S. Senate nomination. 
Lugar, who is stepped down after eight years as In­dianapolis mayor, once was known as Nixon's favorite may­or, and was an adviser to Nix­on on urban affairs. 
"I never heard him say 'damn it' and there was no pro­fanity and obviously there was no bitterness," Landgrebe said. "He didn't seem to be car­rying a chip on his shoulder about anything." 
The visit was "a very warm, exciting hour and much more than I expected," Landgrebe added. 
He saia Nixon "looks about the same ... but maybe not quite as crisp and starchy. I never saw him as President when his 
clothes had a wrinkle." 
LandgreJ:>e refused to say whether Nixon advised him to get back into politics or seek the 2nd District Republican no~ination for Congress next sprmg.

A finance major, Arminio attests to the frustration encountered by students like himself who have a great interest in radio broad­casting. "My chief complaint is that with the exception of two or three courses, a student interested in radio can do nothing to better himself on the air except to work at the radio station," he says. "The few courses that are offered are not even geared around the mechanics or writing tech1.iques of radio. The Voice and Diction course offered at St. Mary's would

the members of the Academic Council he said, would erode the academic year. 
It would break up the latter part of the semester too much, ac­cording to Hesburgh. He said a reason for not making a four-day Thanksgiving vacation was that the Council thought that this would lead to students taking an extended break of their own. 
Hesburgh said this year's
erosion of the Thanksving break 
was the worst he could remem­
ber. Some students responded that 
this was because they had been 
promised an "extended" break for 
Thanksgiving. Hesburgh coun­
tered by saying the exact working 
was that the break would be as 
long as would be "possible" with a 
post-Labor Day start. 
It was very interesting to 
Hesburgh that what the students are demanding this year is a
"complete reversal from what was wanted last year." He stated "90 percent of the students last year

yeas to this year.''

back long enough. It's about time that someone else around here pat our back for us," he states. 
Arminio directs his initial comments to those who have ex­pressed their dissatisfaction with the results of contests run by the station. 
However, contests sponsored by the station are usually true to their commitments. According to Arminio the Beach Boy Albums to be awarded were never received 
from the suppliers. 1he company · involved maintains that it sb1pped the albums as ordered but the merchandise has not appeared.

"The University has a right to be 
proud of these persons," 'Arminio 
says, "and they should show that 
they want to turn out more people
like them.'' 
In concluding his statements, he expresses his personal viewpoint. "Being a natural optimist, I hope things will change. My being here four years at Notre Dame has not squelched my optimism as much as tempered it. I'm hopeful that the necessary changes will come even if I am not here to see it. Most importantly, I hope that budding broadcasters who wish to use WSND as an educational means will be afforded the OJ!portunity to

'Danc1·ng Ir1·sh' formed· 1 tryouts held thl·s week 
by Patti Roucco Staff Reporter 

Capping last year's organizational work for beginning a drill team at Notre Dame are the tryouts for the "Dancing Irish" taking place this week. 
The tryouts are the culmination of an idea proposed by N.D. student Linda Slaughter. Working last year in conjunction with Bonita Bradshaw, Debbie Mciver, MaryAnne Shilala, Becky Thorn­ton, and a group os approximately 30 girls Slaughter has since dropped out. Bonita Bradshaw chairs the group this year who works very closely with faculty adviser Astrid Hotvedt, Notre Dame Sports Co-ordinator for women. 
As for the tryouts themselves, interested Notre Dame women can go to the second Floor of LaFor­tune from 10 to 11:30 p.m. to learn the new drill routine. Final tryouts are tentatively set for Monday night. A committee to head the drill team and form new routines will also be chosen, though cap­tains for the squad will not be picked until January 6. Tryouts results will be announced Tu.resday. 
Some of the priliminary work for the team already finalized con­tains a couple of scheduled ap­pearances at basketball games this February and the team's uniform which includes: an N.D. plaid skirt, yellow top, sash, tam and boots. One organizer Becky Thornton stated she believedthe team to be a "a good outlet for girls who want to get involved in a Notre Dame activity." Thornton added she felt this year's prospects should form "a real nice squad." 
Chairwoman Bonita Bradshaw could not be reached for comment, therefore the judges for the squad tryouts are not known.

ND hockey team hosts Wisconsin .. 
by Chip Scanlon 
!<'or theNotreDame hockey team the last few weeks have been rough, but hopefully things will looking up for them in the next three weeks. This weekend the leers are looking to break a three game losing streak as they take on mad city's finest, the Wisconsin Badgers. 
Wisconsin has been struggling this year, the victim of what Irish coach Lefty Smith calls "crucialmistakes in the early going," but is starting to come around in recent games. This seems to be the way things are going for this year's Irish, running into teams just when they seem to be on a hot streak. 
The Badgers are a young but talented team. They return 16 monogram winners and among these are five of the league's top scorers and one of the league's top goalies. Mike Dibble returns in the goal with a current goals against average of 5.06 in the WCHA, quite a bit higher than his last year mark of 3.58. 
This will be an important series for Irish confidence and morale. During final examination week practice will be optional and this will throw the timing of the team off. So this Wisconsin series looms

After this series the leers can the series is like "the best in the look forward to two perennial West versus the best in the East." 


Harvard has been in the NCAA finals for the last two years and Boston College, despite currently experiencing a character rebuilding year, is always tough. For Notre Dame it will be a prestige game accordingtoSmith,a game they can use to recapture some of the prestige they lost in last year's 8-2 loss to Harvard's Crimson. 
After a brief respite the icers return from their Cristmas vacation to play three teams in ni­ne days for a total of five games.North Dakota is the first opponent in 1976 for the Irish and right now they don't look too for­midable. This last weekend they were swept by Michigan Stateand are tiedfor last place. The Fighting Sioux have been hurt by graduation and have been unable to put it together yet. 
Bowling Green is next for ND in an exhibition game at Bowling Green. Although BG is not in the WCHA, the NCAA is looking closely at all games this year. Last year the Falcons ended up with a 23-10-2 record that was the best in the school's history. 
Last. but certainly not least in the talent department, is Min­nesota's Golden Gophers. This is a team that came within one game of capturing its second straight national championship. Minnesota is currently in second place in the WCHA with an 8-3 record., and it is showing no effects _of losing 10 
lettermen to graduatwn. 
Among the returning Gophers 
are captain Pat Phippen, a senior 
who scored 22 goals combined with 
29 assists for a total of 51 points. 
Returning on defense is sophomore 
Heed Larsen, an NCAA All­
tournament selection as a fresh­
man. 
!<'or the immediate future the 
Irish will be trying to cut down on their goals against average, a problem area so far this year. Notn Damehas been giving up about five goals a game and to hear Lefty Smith talk, "that is at least two too many." Smith remarked that "to he successful, you can only gi\'e up 
three goals a game." 
Another thing that the team will be concentrating on is l't'aeting to defensive sitLJations more quickly. "We've outshot everyone so far this year," saysSmith,"but we've either run up against good goaltending or we're getting off poorshots." 
So from now on the icers will be 
trying to "show some defensive 
improvement." A key to defensive 
play is backchecking, turning up 

...
the ice as soon as the other team gains possession of the puck. Then the opposing players find it more difficult to break out of their zone and aren't able to skate into the offensive zone unaccosted. And this is the area where Smith wants to get improvement fast. 
"We'll be trying to pick-up the wings a little quicker and quicken our overall reaction defensivP!y," Smith remarked. "You have to be strong on the fundamentals and when things aren't going well it's always good to start concentrating on them." 
Currently the Irish are posting a 4-6 record in the WCHA and although they are in seventh position in the league this isn't really cause for alarm. A sweep this weekend will put them right back into contention. 
If injuries will ease up on the Irish long enoughfor them to straighten out their lines, Smith's icers will be able to start playing the winning hockey they are capable of and vault them­selves into the top of the league standings. 
Hopefully, 1976 will be a better year for Notre Damehockey.

Texas Tech first big test for Irish 
hv El'nif' Torriero 
When Notre Dame first an­nounced that TexasTechwould face the Irish in basketball this season, ~orne people increduously queried, 
"What? They scheduled a football 
~chool." 
Well if you don't believe Texas Tech plays basketball, just ask the pt>ople from Kansas State. In the opener for both teams the Red l{aiders stunned KSU, then in the top ten. 66-58. For those of us with ~hort memories, Kansas State is the team that finished second in the Big Eight last season while streaking to the NCAA Eastern Hegional Finals, where they were finally upended in overtime by Syracuse. As a further tune-up for the Irish. Tech rolled over Nor­thwestern Oklahoma by a 40 point margin.
"Texas Tech is a great te1'1m," warns Irish coach Digger Phelps. "They could make it to the NCAA tournament. The fans will cer­tainly see a good game Saturday." 
The main cog in the Red Raider 
... 
attack occurs in the person of 6-9 senior center Rick Bullock. The 230 pound Bullock was voted the most valuable player in the Southwest Conference last season and led the league in scoring (22.0) average and rebounding (11.0). Before being hurt in a New Year's Eve snowball fight, Bullock had played in 60 stragiht games. Further, the San Antonio native has hit over 57 per cent of his shots in his career. 
"Rick'sstrong point ," explains Tech coach Gerald Myers, "is that he has a good shooting touch for a big man. He has spurts when he rebounds well and he has improved defensively every year." 
Bullock resembles another good shooting center who used to frequent the ACC. "Bullock has the potential to be as good as John Shumate," emphasized Notre Dame assistant coach Frank McLaughlin. While Phelps ad­ded,"He has got to be one of the premier players in the country." 
In addition to Bullock, who scored 32 points versus Kansas State, a pair of 6-6 seniors occupy the forward positions. Grady Newton, the team's number two scorer and an excellent rebounder is at one wing slot. Rudy Liggins, a quick shooter compliments Newton on the other side. 
Junior Steve Dunn is the Raider quarterback. The 6-2 175 pound Dallas native started 21 games at guard last year. His backcourt teammate, junior Keith Kitchens is noted for his passing ability. 
For the first time this year the Irish will face the test of a man-to­man defense. So far Notre Dame has only seen teams with zone defenses. Yet as Valpo coach Bill Purden noted Tuesday, "We thought the way we could best stop Notre Dame was with a zone. Ironically, when we went to a man-
on-man strategy late in the first period,. we outscored them." 
With Bullock in the post and Tech playing a man-to-man defense, Tech will try to force the Irish into mistakes. But Phelps warns, "We played a lot of men against Valpo. We like to play a lot

Things are not quite as they should be in the bowl picture this year. Some perennial bowl regulars are missing, and some old faces have joined the lineup in new bowls, for them anyways. 
For example, there's a Big Ten team in the Orange Bowl. a Pacifie-S team in the Liberty Bowl and Notre Dame in no bowl. But the overall bowl picture is greatly improved over previous years, because top­ranked teams which have always been limited in their bowl options can now go elsewhere, and have. Also. the minor bowls have secured such highly­touted teams as Texas, USC, Arizona State. Nebraska and Florida, Instead of holding meaningless contests between unexciting teams, the minor bowls now offer major teams of much-more-than-passing interest. Several have even been picked up by national 
television. The major bowl picture, however, offers top teams 
but the match-ups are not all they could be. Woody Hayes' Buckeyes of Ohio State are sitting pretty right now. A victory over UCLA in the Rose Bowl would practically assure a national championship. Texas A&M also has a chance to come out of a major bowl undefeated, but they would probably not beat the Buckeyes in the polls. If A&M tops Arkansas tomorrow, they will face Georgia in the Cotton Bowl but a victory over the bulldogs, though they are a fin~ team. could not be overly-impressive. For that matter. a Buckeye victory over UCLA won't be either because OSU has already beaten the Bruins this year. 
If Texas A&M and Ohio State emerge from New Year's day undefeated, the argument for a college football playoff will be stronger than ever, because no one will ever know for sure. 
Elsewhere, Michigan receives small consolation for their bowl misfortunes in the past few years. Though they were legitimately deprived of the Rose Bowl bid this year by Ohio State, they will be allowed to compete in the Orange Bowl against Oklahoma. 
.Finally, there's the Sugar Bowl in New Orleans, with Penn State slated to meet Alabama. Bear Bryant is fooling no one. He wants a bowl victory so bad <he's 0-7-1 in the last eight years) that he didn't care how he got it. Declining to face a Big Eight team. he hand-picked Penn State, and he still may not get his victory. He won't impress anyone anyway. 
Here are the Irish Eye's Bowl Picks: 
Tangerinl' Bowl: (Dec. 20th> Miami of Ohio vs. South 
Carolina Miami has been impressive in the Mid­
American Conference. But Jim Carlen has done an 
excellent rebuilding job for SC, and performed well 
against tougher opponents. It will be close but look 
furM~mi~3. ' 
Libl'rty Bowl: mec. 22ndl Southern Cal vs either 
:\rkansas or Texas A&M It's just hard to believe 
John McKay will go out with five straight losses. A 
man with the class and ability of McKay deserves 
better. If Arkansas is his opponent (assume they will 
be> then he should go out with his final victory in a
 bowl, where he has won so many great games. Ricky, Bell, Vince Evans and Randy Simmrin will have to regain their scoring touch, and the defense will have to tighten up, but they can do it. Trojans by 7. Sun Bowl: (Dec. 26th> Pittsburgh vs. Kansas Pitt has to be inspired to be great, but they can really be great. Tony Dorsett is the best runner the Jayhawks will have faced all year, and Pitt's defense can be very tough. But going bysoundness,Kansas has the edge They emerged with a fine 7-4 record in the toughest conference in the country. Nolan Cromwell is superb at leading their veer offense, so look for the Jayhawks by 7. Fiesta Bowl (Dec 26th) Arizona State vs. Nebraska This may prove to be the finest bowl of the bunch. Frank Kush 'sSun Devils hold an 11-0 record and are ranked eighth in the nation. "Fast Freddie" Williams leads the way on the offense and Mike Haynes, an outstanding defensive back, anchors the defense. Nebraska is a heavyweight. though, something the Sun Devil schedule omitted this season. State will find out that WAC and Big Eight don't rhyme. Huskers by 13. Bluebonnet Bowl <Dec. 27th> Colorado vs. Texas Texas had a "good but not quite" team this year, and Colorado had a "sometimes good and never quite" squad. Earl Campbell leads a powerful Longhorn wishbone that Colorado probably won't be able to stop. The Buffaloes will make a game of it, but Texas should capture the victory. Longhorns by 10. Gator Bowl <Dec 29th) Florida vs. Maryland The Gators 9-2 record may have been worthy of a major bowl, but they like it in their home state. With Jimmy DuBose running the ball, their offense should 
should perform as it has all year , explosively. Maryland was surprising in the ACC this year, and will put up a good fight. But home state advantage slants it towards Florida. Gators bv 7. 
Peach Bowl (Dec. 31st) North Carolina State vs. West Virginia The Mountaineers played over thier heads all year, and dropped their final game to Syracuse. When it comes down to the big one, don't count on them. State's defense can be super, and if they avoid mistakes, they'll take it. Wolfpack by 7. Sugar Bowl (Dec. 31st) Alabama vs. Penn State It 
w~mld.serve ~ea~ rig~t to drop this bowl game after he did everythmg m his power ot assure a win. Joe Pate~no. is not likel.Y to be caught off guard, and he has a sohd linebacker m Greg Buttle. This year however, as opposed to the last two years, the Bear may have the better team. Richard Todd has the offense in a groove, and back Willie Shelby leads the way. Tide by 7. 
Cotton Bowl <Jan 1st> Texas A&M or Arkansas vs. 
Georgia Let's assume that the Aggies make it to 
Dallas, and then assume again that they'll emerge 
undefeated. Their defense, as evidenced in the Texas game, is fantastic, number one in the country. 
Linebacker Ed Simmonini and Cornerback Pat Thomas are All-Americans and Georgia will find out why. The Bulldogs are good, but A&M is too tough.Aggies by 10. 
Rose Bowl (Jan 1st) Ohio State vs. UCLA Though we've already seen this game once this year (in which the Buckeyes won, 41-20) it should be a little different. John Sciarra has the Bruin veer working to 
perfection, but they have to hold on to the ball. They did everything they could to give the USC game to the Trojans, and they surely can't afford to do it against the Buckeyes. Archie Griffin and Cornelius Greene won't be stopped as easily. It will be closer than before, but the result will be the same. OSU by 14. Orange Bowl (Jan. 1st> Michigan vs. Oklahoma This may turn out to be the best of the major bowls. The Wolverines will want to prove that they belong in a bowl, and Gorden Bell, Bob Lytle and receiver Jim Smith won't hurt. The Sooners are coming off their fine victory over Nebraska, and if they play like they did in that game, it should be a great battle. Make it Oklahoma by 7.
