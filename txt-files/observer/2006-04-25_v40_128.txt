COUNCIL OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Officers approve future budget 
By KELLY MEEHAN Saint Mary's Editor 
For most members of Notre Dame's Class of 2006, Senior Week serves as a bittersweet conclusion to their four years at the University. 
But last week some seniors ­future fifth-year students with graduating fourth-year friends -discovered the tradition would not become a reality for them. 
Senior architecture major Kate Donovan made this "disappoint­ing discovery" last week when she had her student ID card swiped to receive Chicago Cubs tickets -one of Senior Week's highlight events.

The Council of Representatives (COR) approved a $481,243.06 budget Monday, up more than $100,000 from the $362,500 allocated last year. 
The increase can be attrib­uted to both projected Shirt profits and the higher $95 student activities fee that will go into effect next fall, Student Union treasurer Steve Friend said. 
"Historically we have only projected $100,000 of rev­enue from The Shirt," Friend said. "This year we decided to allocate as much as we could at the present time ­giving us $30,000 extra to play with." 

Friend said the latest pro­jection for Shirt revenues is around $150,000. 
The student activities fee will also jump from $80 to $95 for the next academic year, a result of two Student Senate resolutions. Ultimately approved by the Board of Trustees in February, the increase will make the College Readership Program possible next fall. 
Two-thirds of the money from the student activities fee increase, totaling $81,000, is assigned to the

"I was surprised more than anything," she said upon receiv­ing news that she would have to wait until the Senior Week of the Class of 2007.

Alumni rector receives award 
By PETER NINNEMAN News Writer 
After 28 years as rector of Alumni Hall, Father George Rozum was honored and sur­prised with the Distinguished Alumni Award from the Notre Dame 
Alumni Association at a ban­quet in s 0 u t h Dining Hall Friday. 
"It's very humbling 


because all Rozum I've done is continue to say I'd do the job of rector one more year and the years went by," Rozum said. "I assume they think that I've done my job of being rector as the University, the students and the alumni would suppose that I should." 
The award is not given out annually, and Rozum is only the 12th person to receive it. 
His 28-year tenure as rec­tor is a University record. 
Chuck Lennon, executive director and associate vice president for university rela­tions for the Alumni Association, said letters were sent to former resi­dents of Alumni to let them in on the secret. 
Alumni residents and Notre Dame alumni gathered Friday for the banquet to celebrate the 75th anniver­sary of Alumni Hall's con­struction. In attendance were University President 
Emeritus Father Theodore Hesburgh and five Holy Cross priests who had Rozum as a rector when they lived in Alumni Hall as stu­dents. 
Alumni Board president Tim Brady said nominations for the award are made by "a host of people," and then the Alumni Association com­mittee on internal activities makes recommendations to the whole Alumni Association, which votes for the recipient. 
"It is awarded on occasion of exemplary service to the University or the communi­ty," Lennon said. 
Rozum is the first rector to receive the award. Previous recipients of the award

Interim VP to start in July 
University forming plan for 2007-08 
By RYAN SYDLIK 
News Writer 
Don Pope-Davis, Notre Dame's current associate vice president for graduate studies and a psychology professor, has been named interim vice presi­dent for 
graduate studies and resea.rch, according to a University statement released April20. 
He will 


begin his Pope-Davis duties July 1 and replace Jeffrey Kantor, who has held the position since 2000. 
"Don Pope-Davis was selected as interim vice president because he is an accomplished researcher who understands the importance of research," Provost Thomas Burish said Monday. "He is the best quali­fied person to move in at this time." 
But Pope-Davis' appointment is intended to fill the position for just a year. The University has not decided what to do when Pope-Davis' interim term ends, Burish said, and is con­sidering a reorganization of his office.

Short power, Internet 
outages hit ca111pus 
By RYAN SYDLIK 
News Writer 
Approximately half the build­ings on Notre Dame's campus were affected by a power outage and all lost Internet service for a brief period Sunday afternoon, Director of Utilities Paul Kempf said. 
Kempf said the outage lasted for about 15 minutes. It started shortly after 12:30 p.m. and by approximately 12:45 p.m., power was restored to most of the cam­pus. 
Internet service was out from 
12:33 to approximately 1:20 p.m. 
Buildings affected by the power outage included Knott Hall, Hesburgh Library, North Dining Hall, South Dining Hall, Farley Hall, Dillon Hall, Breen-Philips Hall, Fisher Hall, Pasquerilla East Hall, Zahm Hall and LaFortune Student Center. 
The cause of the power outage was a supply interruption from an external supplier, not a fault of Notre Dame's on-campus power plant, Kempf said. 
When the connection was inter­rupted, the Notre Dame system shed half its load to cover the shortfall so the electrical grid would not damage itself, he said. 
Notre Dame produces a portion of its own power at the campus power plant and buys another

These activities, like most hobbies, involve one of two things: energy and money, neither of which I have much of at this point. 
That being said, I too have a hobby, a new love that fills tho empty hours of my afternoons: napping. 
Unlike most hobbios, where one must start from ba_<>ically nothing and chase their pa<>sion with their monoy or efforts, napping requires no introduction, no training, nothing but a love of quality rest. 
In preschool, napping was encouraged a<> part of the curriculum-and I feel that it is high time to return to the mind­set of our past. 
With time and dedication, anyone can become a good napper. Also, the nap is timeless. At any hour of the day, at any time of the year, the napper can pursue his/her passion. Night or day, winter or summer, the nap L<> always available as the perfeet leisure pursuit. 
Napping, however; is not merely tho pursuit of sleep and an absence of activi­ty. Napping is a skill honed by years of practice. While anyone can take a great nap when exhaused, these !luke por­formam:es are not signs of napping prominence. 
Tht~ true nappor must loarn to adapt to his surroundings, to push him/herself into tho optimal mindset no mattor what tho conditions may bo. With two hours of frnn time, tho eommittnd nappnr finds a way to got it donn. A ).,>Tnat napper can sleop through thn roommatn's tnlephono eonvorsation whilo tho TV blares, and tho best in the businnss could probably slnep through a rock mm:ert in the rain. 
While sleep is an inll~).,rral part of the nap, a good nap is much more than sleep. Napping is about dearing your mind, finding relaxation amidst the strains of daily Iii(~. The best naps come while the sun is out, after one has fiiUnd the momentary peace that contrasts with the bustle of the oul<;ide world. While I must admit that I am not the best nap­per, I !i"lel that I am making progress with my abilities, with a little more work, I soon eould b1~ one of tim best. 
In those preschool days, my toachers gave out the daily "Bnst-Reswr Award" to the bost napper of the day. In my four yoars under their care, I won the award only one time, ranking me last in my graduating kindergarten dass of 1991. 
I !'they eould see me now, could see how far I've come, I know my teachers would bo ploa<>ed.

Cruise baby name puzzles Israelis 
JERUSALEM -Suri, the name chosen by Hollywood couple Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes for their new­born daughter, is raising more than its share of inter­est in Israel. 
It means "get out of here" in the local language, Hebrew.' 
News of the naming puz­zled even those Israelis who thought they had seen it all after pop diva Madonna turned the ancient Jewish mystical tradition Kabbalah into a faith for the famous.

College bars students from posing for Playboy 
SAN ANTONIO-Baylor University in Waco, Texas, which bills itself as the world's largest Baptist col­lege, has threatened to dis­cipline students if they pose for Playboy magazine, which is trying to recruit models from the college. 
Playboy photographers 

came to Baylor's hometown seeking models for a photo spread on women of the Big 12 college athletic confer­ence, of which the college is a member. 
Baylor Vice President for Student Life Samuel W. Oliver sent an e-mail to stu­dents this week warning that any who "associate" with Playboy would be sub­ject to the university's disci­plinary processes. 
Baylor, known for its con­servative outlook, did not allow dancing on campus untillO years ago.

BOARD OF GOVERNANCE 
Group grants co-sp~nsorships 
Allocations made for psychology honors society trip, The Show 2006 
By LIZ HARTER 
News Writer 
Saint Mary's Board of Governance (BOG) officers approved two co-sponsorships totaling $6,045 at their meeting Monday night. One will help fund a scholarship for a group of students to travel to a national psychology honors society convention, and the other will go to support The Show 2006. 
The first co-sponsorship will help fund a trip for 11 mem­bers of the Saint Mary's Psi Chi Club to the Psi Chi Midwestern Regional Convention in Chicago, Ill. Psi Chi is a national honor society in psychology. 
Saint Mary's students have attended the conference for several years, Psi Chi represen­tative Jennifer Hanlon said. 
"Five Saint Mary's psychology [major] seniors will present research they have conducted throughout their undergradu­ate work [at the conference]," Hanlon said. 
Athletic commissioner Anne Cusak motioned to pass the co­sponsorship for $1 ,045, which promptly passed. 
The second co-sponsorship will help fund The Show 2006 -the largest annual concert event intended for all members of the Saint Mary's, Notre Dame and Holy Cross communities, according to the co-sponsorship application. 
Notre Dame junior Patrick Vassel presented the $10,000 co-sponsorship proposal to BOG. The estimated total cost of The Show for 2006 is $128,000. 
"It's important to us that [The Show] be as much a Saint Mary's event as a Notre Dame event because it shows new and returning members of this community what it means to be a part of each student body and the community as a whole," Vassel said. "From start to fin­ish we really do everything pos­sible to make sure that this is as much a Saint Mary's event." 
Following Vassel's proposal, board members discussed BOG's past financial involve­ment with The Show. 
The board discussed placing stipulations on BOG funding of the event such as advertise­ment of Saint Mary's orienta­tion weekend events like the Jamaica Shaka. 
"That's one of the reasons that the Jamaica Shaka was so big last year because it was on all their flyers," student body vice president Maggie Siefert said. 
Former BOG treasurer Jillian Waters sat in on the meeting to help guide the new board mem­bers through their first co­sponsorships. 
"I think $10,000 is a lot," she said. "I think it's a great event and I think it should be one of the largest if not the largest co­sponsorships that BOG sup­ports." 
Admissions commissioner Annie Davis motioned to pro­vide $5,000 with the stipula­tions that by the end of the school year The Show's com­mittee find a Saint Mary's liai­son as well as advertising the Jamaica Shaka on fliers. The board voted to provide the money with the stipulations after a small amount of discus­sion. 
In Other BOG News: 
+Student Activities Board president Claudia Toth announced there will be an 80s-themed dance this Saturday on the Library green. 
+Student body president Susan Mcllduff reminded the board of a Chicago bus trip and Student Activities Board bus trip Saturday to the Dunes in Michigan. A sign-up sheet for both trips is at the front desk of the student center.

$5 would go to everyone else," said Kerry Kilbourn, CCC president. "But we're not see­ing the money." 
The CCC saw no increase in allocation this year, despite a request for nearly $1,500 in additional funding. 
Friend justified the alloca­tions for the College Readership Program, which will provide three national newspapers on campus daily next fall. 
"The College Readership Program was a unique request this year," Friend said. "Unlike any of the oth­ers, it required full allocation, and that's why it was met." 
Another contested alloca­tion was that of the Hall 
Presidents Co.uncil (HPC). The HPC requested funding that totaled over $800,000 ­almost twice the overall Student Union budget. HPC received the highest propor­tion of its request besides the College Readership Program. 
Friend said while HPC was only allocated $45,000 last year, the group was reallocat­ed quite a bit more. This year's $14,000 increase antic­ipates HPC will not need any more money at reallocation.

"We don't have a priority list for reallocation," Friend said. "I can't guarantee that if off-campus comes in that they're going to get any­thing." 
While few organizations have been allocated as much as requested, groups should be reallocated a substantial amount later next fall as rev­enue estimates were modest, Friend said. 
"Our goal was to allocate as much as we could, and we allocated every bit of it," he said.

portion from outside suppliers. Since the suppliers who pro­vide approximately half of Notre Dame's power were cut off, the campus lost about half of its power. 
"Nine feeders tripped, which is about half of the 20 feeders," Kempf said. 
The feeders -lines that supply power to clusters of buildings -shut down as a result of the temporary lack of power. When the power was restored, feeders went through a reconnection process and they came back on automati­cally. 

The loss of electricity was not the only effect of the power outage, as Internet service for all of campus was lost as a result. 
"The whole network was down," Aaron Wright, a techni­cal support analyst for OIT said. 
He said while back-up gener­ators exist to protect critical areas of the network such as the data center, they are not meant to keep all of campus running during a power out­age.

Car bombs amass Iraqi casualties 
BAGHDAD -A string of car bombs rocked Baghdad on Monday, killing 10 people and wounding nearly 80 in an apparent campaign to discredit Iraq's new leadership. At least 15 people were killed in other bombings and shootings. 
Police also discovered the bodies of 28 peo­ple in the capital and the northern city of Mosul. They included 15 police recruits from Ramadi who were kidnapped Sunday and slain by insurgents, police said. 
The seven car bombs exploded over a five­hour period in six widely separated neighbor­hoods across the capital. The first blast occurred near the Health Ministry and killed five people, Lt. Col. Faleh al-Mohammedawi said.

"We extend our heartfelt condolences for all those who have lost their lives in the people's movement," Gyanendra said in the address, broadcast on state television and radio.

Siraj faces bial for subway bomb plot 
NEW YORK -A Pakistani immigrant, angered by the war in Iraq and the Abu Ghraib prison scandal, plotted to bomb one of the city's busiest subway stations in 2004 to teach America "a good lesson," a prosecutor said Monday at a federal conspiracy trial. 
The defendant; Shahawar Matin Siraj, consid­ered striking several potential targets including the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge before settling on the Herald Square subway station, said A'lsistant U.S. Attorney Todd Harrison. 
"In the summer of 2004, he could barely pass a bridge or subway station without planning to place a bomb there," Harrison said. 
Defense attorney Martin Stolar told jurors his client was entrapped by an informant who had infiltrated a Brooklyn mosque. 
The government "created a crime where none previously existed," Stolar said. 
Jury takes up Moussaoui's fate 
ALEXANDRIA, Va.-Zacarias Moussaoui's tate was placed Monday afternoon in the hands of a jury that will decide whether he is executed for his part in the deaths of Sept. 11, 2001. 
Jurors opened deliberations at 2:26 p.m. EDT, after final pleadings from the prosecution to "put an end to his hatred and venom" by opting for execution, and from the defense to spare him the martyr's death he seeks and send him to prison for life instead. 
The jury decided in 15 hours of deliberations over four days earlier this month that Moussaoui, 37, the only man charged in this country in the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, was responsible for deaths that day even though he was in jail.

EGYPT 

Blasts devastate tourist area 
Attack occurs day after bin Laden's warning, al-Qaida involvement unconfirmed 
Associated Press 
CAIRO -Three nearly simultaneous explosions rocked the Egyptian resort city of Dahab on Monday, killing at least 22 people and wounding more than 150 in a terror attack at the height of the tourist season. 
Police said the explosions hit the central part of the city where there are many shops, restaurants, bars and guesthouses. The blasts ripped through the town at

Bush calls deportation unrealistic 
Associated Press 
IRVINE, Calif. -President Bush, rebutting lawmakers advocating a law-and-order approach to immi­gration, said Monday that those who are calling for massive deportation of the estimated 11 million foreign­ers living illegally in the United States are not being realistic. 
"Massive deportation of the peo­ple here is not going to work," Bush said as a Congress divided over immigration returned from a two­week recess. "It's just not going to work." 
In addition to speaking here, Bush was meeting Tuesday with a biparti­san group of senators at the White House to press his case. 
In Irvine, Bush spoke in support of a stalled Senate bill that includes provisions that would allow for eventual citizenship to some of the illegal immigrants already here. Some conservatives say that would amount to amnesty. 

"This is one of the really impor­tant questions Congress is going to have to deal with," Bush said. The president said he thought the Senate "had an interesting approach by saying that if you'd been here for five years or less, you're treated one way, and five years or more, you're treated another." 
Standing in the center of a theater in the round-type setting with an audience full of business people, Bush spoke sympathetically about the plight of foreigners who risk their lives to sneak into the United States to earn a decent wage. He said the U.S. needs a temporary guest worker program to stop peo­ple from paying to be smuggled in the back of a truck. 
"I know this is an emotional debate," Bush told the Orange County Business Council. "But one thing we can't lose sight of is that we are talking about human beings, decent human beings." 
Lawmakers, with an eye on Election Day in just over six months, remain far apart on whether to crack down on illegal immigrants or embrace them as vital contributors to the U.S. econo­my. 
Bush said it's important to enforce border laws that are on the books and boasted that 6 million immi­grants have been captured and turned back since he took office. 
"You can be a nation of law and be a compassionate nation at the same time," he said to applause.

PANAMA 
President announces expansion of canal 
Associated Press 
PANAMA CITY -Panama's president said a planned expansion of the Panama Canal would define the waterway's "role in the 21st century" and on Monday called on voters to support a referendum to pay for the proposal. 
Tlw expansion to make way for hugo n1~w container ships that can carry twice as much cargo is 1~xpnctnd to eost $5.3 billion -in a country whose government budget is $6.5 billion a year. It will be put to voters in a refenlndum later this year.

nation to widen the canal is fueled by fears that newer, larger ships will seek other routes between the Atlantic and the Pacific. 
"The Panama Canal route is facing competition," Torrijos said. "If we do not meet the challenge to continue to give a competitive service other routes will emerge that will replace ours. It would be unforgivable to refuse to improve the capacity of the waterway." 
The Torrijos government also is counting on an eco­nomic windfall that would come from an estimated 7,000 jobs during the five­year construction.

The biggPst ships that can pass through the canal's cur­rent locks are known as "Panamax" vessels and can carry 4,000 cargo containers. They barely fit in the locks, which are about 1OS feet wide. 
The projeet calls for the construction of a third set of locks of water chambers that will allow the large "Post­Panamax" class of cargo ships to use the 50-mile waterway between the 
Atlantic  and  the  Paeific  
oceans.

The government's determi­grams. 
In 2005, Panama earned $1.2 billion in canal fees, maintenance and other related services levied on some 13,000 ship crossings. 
Panama took over the administration of the water­way on December 31, 1999, the day the U.S. military pres­ence in Panama ended. The United States is the main user of the canal, followed by the combined South American countries and China. 
Opponents of the expan­sion, among them former canal administrator Fernando Manfredo, argue that the project is unnecessary and risky because it depends on variables like the growth of maritime world trade, world economic fluctuations and even polities.

Chavez pushes to increase control 
State-owned oil company proposes larger stake in heavy crude projects 
Associated Press 
CAHACAS -Venezuelan 
President Hugo Chavez wants to 
further increase state control 
over some of the country's most 
promising oil projects in a move 
industry analysts warn could 
squeeze corporate profits and 
spook foreign investment. 
A proposal raised by state oil company Petroleos de Venezuela SA, or PDVSA, to take a larger stake in heavy crude projects operating in the oil-rich Orinoco Hiver basin has yet to be spelled out. But analysts warn it is threatening to hurt long-term oil production in an area that potentially outstrips Saudi Arabia's proven reserves at a time when oil prices are ris­ing on fears of depleting deposits and surging demand. 
In comments published over the weekend, Eulogio Del Pino, a PDVSA director who oversees contracts with foreign oil com­panies, told the El Universal newspaper that Venezuela would like oil majors BP PLC, Exxon Mobil Corp., Chevron Corp., ConocoPhillips, France's Total SA and Norway's Statoil ASA to change four heavy oil upgrading projects into state­controlled joint ventures, known as "mixed companies." 
While the terms have yet to be presented and any changes would need to be approved by congress, Del Pino said the gov­ernment should "do the job completely and the participation of the state should be 51 per­cent." 
Venezuela has already set a precedent for what it has in

mind: earlier this month, it void­
ed oil-pumping contracts with 
private companies at 32 fields 
and replaced them with the new 
mixed-company model that 
gives PDVSA a minimum 60­
percent stake, sharply raised 
royalties and taxes and reduced 
potential drilling acreage by 
almost two-thirds. 
"It's a matter of time," before Venezuela moves to impose sim­ilar terms on the Orinoco proj­ects, which together produce about 600,000 barrels a day, said Juan Carlos Sosa Azpurua, president of Grupo Petroleo YV, a Caracas-based energy consult­ant. 
The results of that could be grave in a sector that needs as much as $5 billion a year just to maintain current production and will probably suffer if oper­ations were to be handed over to other players with less expertise in extracting heavy crude, he said. 
"It's very possible that produc­tion will go down," Sosa said. 
Be said the synthetic crude produced by the projects com­prises only a fraction of total world oil supplies -currently at about 84 million barrels a day -and is unlikely to have a tangible effect on the market. 
Venezuela has so far left little negotiating room from the oil majors in announcing such con­tractual changes. 
PDVSA seized two oil fields from Total and Italy's Eni SpA after they refused to migrate their oil-pumping contracts to the joint ventures earlier this month. Oil Minister Hafael Ramirez has said Venezuela 
does not need companies that 
refuse to adjust to the new 
terms. 
Hamirez said on the sidelines 
of an oil conference in Qatar on 
Sunday that Total and Eni 
would not be compensated for 
the fields they lost. 
Much more is at stake in the Orinoco projeets, where the companies have invested a com­bined $16 billion in developing the technology and infrastruc­ture to extract tar-like bitumen and convert it into lighter, more marketable crudes at the giant Jose refinpry. 
The Orinoco projects in east­ern Venezuela differ markedly from the 32 oil lields where the state has already taken a major­ity share, because companies operating in the Orinoco own the bulk of the oil infrastructure in the area, Sosa said. In the other oil lields, the eompanies did not own such assets. 
"It's going to be much more diflieult," to ealeulate and eom­pensate the companies for investments in the Orinoco if the government deeides to seize them, he said. 
Jose Toro Hardy, an oil analyst and former PDVSA direetor, said the private companies are also clearly the best at exploiting the reserves and it's in Venezuela's interest to keep them there. "The companies that made these investments have been extremely suceessful," he said. 
Most ·of the companies involved have not responded directly to Del Pino's comments, though most indicated discus­sion were ongoing with the gov­ernment.

The disaster has forced thousands from their homes yet Orthodox Christians still managed to celebrate Easter. llomanian refugees held serv­iees outdoors in the flood­stricken village of Hast, where priests used an improvised altar in an open tent. 
Similar services in other flooded Eastern European vil­lages were aceompanied by fireworks and even celebrato­ry gunfire.

Orthodox Christians use a different calendar from Homan Catholics and Protestants, so their celebra­tion of Easter usually falls on a different date from the rest of Christianity and always after the Jewish festival of Passover. Coptic Christians in Egypt and some 25 million Ethiopian Christians also cele­brated Easter on Sunday. 
At the Vatican, Pope Benedict XVI joined Orthodox religious leaders' calls for peace and offered prayers for victims of flooding along the Danube Hiver.

"The church is our hope for the future," Christodoulos said in his Easter message. "It is the living and new resistance against the murderous world order which throws every independent voice, every protest of conscience and rea­sonable opposition into the meat grinder." 
Christodoulos' remarks were seen in part as a reference to the United States, ahead of demonstrations planned this week by anti-globalization and other groups against a visit by

JEHUSALEM-A 16-year-old American tourist is fighting for his life a week after a Tel Aviv suicide bombing, and thousands are praying for him after an Internet appeal. 
Daniel Wultz came to Israel with his parents, Tuly and Sheryl, to visit relatives on Passover. They live in Weston, Fla,. north of Miami. 
On April 1 7, father and son were eating lunch in Tel Aviv when a Palestinian suicide bomber ignited 10 pounds of explosives at the entrance to the restaurant. The bomb killed six Israelis, two Homanians, a Freneh tourist and the bomber. Dozens of people were wounded. 

Critically wounded, Daniel was taken to lchilov Hospital. Doetors removed his spleen and a kidney and treated a serious leg wound. His condition remains eritical, hospital oflicials said. 
His father suffered less severe injuries but remains hospital­ized. 
The Wultzes, who have declined to speak to the media, asked their friends and _congre­gation to pray for their son. On Monday, the David Posnaek Hebrew Day School in Plantation, Fla., where Daniel has been a student sinee elemen­tary school, held a prayer service for him. 
Haehel Keller, director of Judaie studies at the school, said, "Daniel is a most remarkable young man. lie is a person of great moral convictions and has been a wonderful asset to our school." 
In addition to praying for Daniel, the Chabad Lubaviteh of Weston has set up a fund in his name. 
The family's request for prayers also went out over the Internet, where it rnaehed Naomi Hagen, whose best-selling novels include "The Covenant," a tale of Israelis whose lives are changed by terrorism. 
"I got an e-mail from a woman in Dearborn, Mieh.," Hagon said, "who forwarded to me a letter shn had received from a friend of hers. The message gave Daniel's name and his age and asknd that people pray for him." 

Scientists study energy in space 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -With gaso­line hitting $3 per gallon, seien­tists have just found the most energy-efficient engines in the universe -black holes, those whirling super-dense centers of galaxies that suck in nearly everything. 
The jets of energy spurting out of older ultra-efficient black holes also seem to be playing a crucial role as zoning cops in large galaxies, preventing too many stars from sprouting. That explains why there aren't as many burgeoning galaxies chock full of stars as previously expect­ed, said scientists citing results from NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory that were released Monday. 
For the first time, scientists measured both the mass of hot gas that is being sueked into nine older black holes and the unseen super-speedy jets of high energy particles spit out, which essen­tially form a cosmie engine. Then they determined a rate of how efficient these older black hole engines are and were awe­struck. 

These blaek holes are 25 times more efficient than anything man has built, with nuclear power being the most efficient of man-made efforts, said study lead author Steve Allen of Stanford University and the Stanford Linear Aceelerator Center. 
"If you could make a car engine that was as efficient as one of these black hole engines you could get about a billion miles per gallon of gas," Allen said. "In anyone's book that would be pretty grnnn." 
The galaxies in which these black holes live are bigger than ours, the Milky Way, and 50 mil­lion to 400 million light-years away. One light-year is nearly 5.9 trillion miles. The blaek hole at the center of our galaxy wasn't studied beeause it wasn't gas­rkh and big enough so scientisl'i couldn't measure what was going in and coming out, Allen said. 
The results were surprising beeause the types of black holes studied were older, less powerful and generally considered "bor­ing," scientists said. But they ended up being more efficient than originally thought -possi­bly as eflkient as their younger, brighter and more potent black hole siblings called quasars.

There is no one true faith 
The belief that there is one true religion has inealeulably hampered mankind's quest fi>r truth. There is no one most true religion; every religion offers wisdom to be gleaned by the philosophieally inquisi­tive. Most of the major modern world reli­gions have historically refused to reeognizP this rnality, bneause they have an institu­tional imperative to perpetuate them­selves. II' they should have recognized truth in other religions, they would have gained a less firm hold upon their adherents. Truth is not the private pos­session of any belief system, it is common­ly held by all the major world religions. 
All the traditions of the major world religions are nocessarily flawed in several respecl'i. Whether the great sages of his­tory were recording the revelations ollim1d to them by Allah, Yawheh, Christ, the Lord Krishna, the great Buddha or any other figure, it was still a human hand with human prejudices unique to the time or eomposition that wrote down tim interpretations of divine reality. If the divine had inspirnd the sages so that it was rather a human hand dictating exact­ly what the divine desired, then a literal interpretation of scriptures would be cor­reeL The world religious traditions and scriptures contain unethical stories, con­tradietions and falsehoods that predude this from being a reality. The myths of the Old Testament, for instance, have pas­sages that suggest entirely unethical courses of action -like the stoning of certain peoples, or the divinely inspired sacking of cities. 

I an Ronderos 
Liberated 

The great sages were attempting to eapture the divine reality, and did capture elements of it. No human religion could ever capture all of it though -religions were created by human beings. Human logic can never completely comprehend or understand the divine. The divine is perfect, and hence the supreme and high­est liwm of logic. In order for humans to be able to understand the logic of' divinity, it would mean that our lesser, flawed logic would be able to contain and control the elements of this logic divine. Nothing that is inferior is able to contain that which is superior; thus, it is an impossibility for men to understand the lot:,tic of the gods. 
The wise man, understanding that truth is present in all religions, and can never truly be limnd. does not turn away from the quest for divine. He steels himself and redoubles his resolve. The search for the divine becomes much harder, because instead of looking for truth within one tra­dition, the ehallenge becomes to seareh within manifold traditions. One must, like a prospeetor, silt dirt through his pan hoping to lind nuggets of gold. Difliwent people lind eertain traditions more rele­vant than others to their individual life and spirituality. People should go forth into the world with a mind open to receive God. 
A particularly healthy approach to spiri­tuality is to develop a fusion of religious ideas, and to mold them into a coherent and sound philosophy that can be applied to one's life. Where one religion is weak, another is often strong. For example, the western religious tradition tends to draw hard dualities, like that of people and God. These seem to be false dualities to this writer. I find that the Hindu concept of the immanenee of God everywhere, and in e.veryo.ne, seems more real. God is literally in everyone; we are part of God, perhaps better seen as an absolute rnality. I firmly believe the Christian ideal of fra­ternallove and compassion. Hence, I am trying to fuse Eastern and Western tradi­ti<ms, in order to create a Hindu-Christian approach. It works li>r me, but I don't necessarily expect it to work for others. Everyone must lind out filr himself what religious traditions lie in harmony with the truth he has felt via life. 
Spirituality is an intensely personal experience, and one should seek to actu­alize her potential to participate in the beauty and splendor of the divine. If pno­ple peg themselves within one tradition only beeause they were born into it, they will not know if they arn getting the most out of their spirituallilf1. The tradition of someone's birth may be the eorrnct one or ones for him, and that is perfeetly line and aeceptable. One can only know this through experienee. All truth is experien­tial at its roots. Empiricism is the way to lind the divine. Philosophy takes the raw, visceral experienees of our lives, and orders them in a way that our mind ean process and understand them. Experience tempered by empirical philosophy is the path to the absolute reality of God. While we ean never fully understand this reality, we can become eloser to it, and gain a firmer, though still ineompletP, under­standing of it.

NCAA LACROSSE 


Associated Press 
DURHAM, N.C. -Several Duke University alumni questioned the school's president Saturday about suspending two lacrosse players charged with raping a stripper at a team party, with one saying his alma mater is guilty of "a tremen­dous rush to judgment." 
"It was convenient to throw the lacrosse team overboard along with their coach," said Joe Baden, a 1970 Duke graduate from Raleigh. 
Baden was among about a half dozen alumni to ques­tion President Richard Brodhead during a forum held as part of a weekend of class reunions. During a talk about the school's strategic plan, Brodhead stopped the program for a half hour to specifically take questions from the crowd of nearly 100 about the lacrosse team and the rape allegations. 
Duke has not confirmed it suspended the two players charged with rape, although the university has said the school's practice is to issue an interim suspension when a student is charged with a felony or when the student's presence on the campus may create an unsafe situa­tion. 
"We really asked our­selves, on the matter of interim suspension, 'How do 
IN BRIEF 
Bush refutes housing scandal 
rumors 
LOS ANGELES -Former Southern California star Reggie Bush said there was nothing inappropriate about his family's living arrangement at a home owned by a man who reportedly sought to market him because they paid rent there. 
"My parents leased the house, just like any normal family would," Bush said in an interview Monday. "It's kind of funny how this whole story is get­ting blown out of proportion." 
The Pac-1 0 said Sunday that it will investigate whether any NCAA rules were violated when Bush's family, including mother Denise Griffin, step­father LaMar Griffin and brother Jovan Griffin lived in the Spring Valley, Calif., house while Bush was still play­ing for USC last season. 
The home was owned by Michael Michaels, who reportedly attempted to steer Bush toward signing with San Diego agent David Caravantes. 

we do these things?"' Brodhead told a questioner. "The custom of this place, I assure you it is the custom of many places, on indict­ment for a felony ... that's the way to go with it and that's the way we did it this time." 
Sophomores Reade Seligmann, of Essex Fells, N.J., and Collin Finnerty, of Garden City, N.Y., were charged this past week with first-degree rape, sexual assault and kidnapping. Authorities believe they were two of the three white men who a 27-year-old black single mother says raped her at a March 13 lacrosse team party. 
Both quickly posted a 
$400,000 bond, and attor­neys for the two players and other team members con­tinue to strongly proclaim their innocence. Meanwhile, District Attorney Mike Nifong has said he hopes to charge a third person, whom he has yet to identify with certainty. 
The allegations led Brodhead to cancel the lacrosse season and accept the resignation of the team's 
· coach. Baden wondered whether Brodhead would have done the same if men's basketball coach Mike Krzyzewski, who has won three national titles and is considering among the best in the game, was at the center of the scandal. 
Panthers refuse to match 
Bears' offer for Manning Jr. 
LOS ANGELES -The Carolina Panthers declined to match the Chicago Bears' offer sheet to corner­back Ricky Manning Jr., one day after he was arrested on suspicion of assault following a fight at a restau­rant near the UCLA campus. 
-A Panthers spokesman said the decision was unrelated to the arrest. Manning, a 25-year-old restricted free agent, signed a five-year, $21 million offer sheet with the Bears last Friday after three seasons with Carolina. 
Manning was arrested early Sunday after he allegedly hit a man in the face along with four or five companions at a Denny's restaurant in the Westwood section of Los Angeles, said officer Mike Lopez, a spokesman for the Los Angeles Police Department. Police didn't know what prompted the fight, or whether Manning knew the alleged victim. 
SMU hires former Tar Heel 
Doherty as hoops coach 
DALLAS -SMU hired former national coach of the year Matt Doherty on Monday to try reviving a program that hasn't gone to the NCAA tournament in 13 years. 
Doherty signed a five-year deal, but terms weren't disclosed. Doherty, com­ing off a 15-13 season at Florida Atlantic, replaces Jimmy Tubbs, who was fired April 6 after two losing sea­sons and an internal investigation that uncovered NCAA violations. 
"I look at this as a destination job," Doherty said. "I didn't want to take a job to take another job." 
Doherty, who won a national cham­pionship as a player for North Carolina, broke into coaching with Notre Dame in 1999-2000. He took over the Tar Heels the next season and earned the coach of the year award from The Associated Press for going 26-7 and winning a share of the regu­lar-season ACC title.

NBA 

Heat hold off Bulls' run to take two-game lead 
Wade scores 21, including game-clinching shot to stop Chicago's rally with one minute remaining in the game 
Associated Press 
MIAMI-Same old story: With the Miami Heat in trou­ble, Dwyane Wade saved the day. 
Wade hit a spinning jumper in the lane with 1:04 lef't to halt a frantic Chicago rally, and blocknd Ben Gordon's layup with 26 seconds left to ensure that Miami would beat the Bulls 115-1 <H~ on Monday night and take a 2-0 lead in the teams' best-of-seven Eastern Confnnmce first-round series. 
.Jason Williams and Shaquille O'Neal each had 22 points for Miami, which saw what was a 20-point third-quarter lead cut to four with 1:15 remaining. But Wade added 21 points, seven assists, five rebounds and four steals for the Ileal, who tied a franchise playoff record with six players in dou­ble ligures. 
Antoine Walker -who played the first 40:20 without a rest, filling in for the sus­pended Udonis Ilaslem ­added 17 points and 10 rebounds for the Ileal, who also got 12 points from James Posey and 11 from Gary Payton. 
Andres Nocioni led all scor­ers with 30 points-on 13-for­15 shooting -for Chicago. Kirk llinrich had 17 of his 29 points in the fourth quarter for the Bulls, who will host Game 3 on Thursday night. 
The Bulls allowed 111 points or more four times in the regu­lar season. The Heat now have done it twice in this series, and shot 52 percent on Monday. Walker scored off an offensive rebound with 8:12 left, giving Miami a 102-84 lead -and a

two-game series lead seemed all but certain. 
Five minutes later, those prospects were precarious, at best. 
Ilinrich hit three straight jumpers -a personal 7-0 run -to get the Bulls within 102­91 with 4:52 left, and he scored four more points in what was a 13-2 Chicago burst that cut Miami's lead to 104-97 with 3:00 left. 
Wade found Walker for a layup at the 2:46 mark, and hit a jumper 59 seconds later to push Miami's lead baek to 108­
99. Once again, the Bulls weren't done -I-linrich seored, and after Wade missed from the same spot he'd hit from one possession earlier, Nocioni hit a 3-pointer with 
1:15 left that got Chicago with­in four. 
But Wade seored on the next trip, Nocioni threw the ball away on Chicago's next posses­sion, and Miami could soon exhale. 
No one need remind Chicago how a 2-0 series lead guaran­tees little; the Bulls blew a two-game lead in the first round against Washington last season, dropping the next four games. But recovering is a daunting task; the Bulls have prevailed only once in 14 pre­vious playoff series after start­ing with two losses. 
The Heat have taken 2-0 series leads on five other occa­sions, and won them all. 
After Miehael Sweetney hit two free throws with 5.4 sec­onds left in the half, the Bulls could have gone into intermis­sion trailing by only seven. 
Instead, in a flash, the mar­gin was 11. Williams streaked down the 
right sideline and made a layup with 1.2 seconds left ­leaving enough time for one more score. Wade intercepted Chicago's inbound pass and dunked just before the dock went to 0.0, giving Miami a 68­57 lead at the break. 
And the deficit had to per­plex the Bulls, who shot the ball at a ridiculous clip in the first half. They hit 61 percent of their tries, were 6-for-8 from 3-point range and 7 -for-8 from the foul line -yet still faced a double-digit hole, largely because of 12 turnovers that Miami cashed in for 14 points. 
For the second straight game, the Bulls -who led the NBA in field-goal percentage defense during the regular season -couldn't do much to slow Miami's offense. 
The Heat were up 8-0 before the game was 1? minutes old, and although Miami later found itself trailing by three in the second quarter -a period which Chicago began with a 9­0 run -it outscored the Bulls 19-10 in the final five minutes before halftime. 
Miami's lead reached 15, then its largest, after O'Neal and Wade had the opening two baskets of the second half. 
Nocioni had five points in a 7-0 burst that got Chicago within 72-64, but Wade spun in the lane and threw a lob for a one-handed O'Neal slam that got Miami's cushion back to 10 and ended the Bulls' run. 
Posey and Walker hit back­to-hack 3-pointers later in the third to start what became a 12-2 Miami run, with Posey capping it with a layup for an 89-69 lead, and the Heat entered the fourth up 95-76.

Jenkins' closing statement a serious misstep 
University President Father John Jenkins, in his April 5 closing statement, delivered the name of Notre Dame to val­idate "The Vagina Monologues" movement, including the book of that name, and the Queer Film Festival, with the movement of which it is a part. He distorted the meaning of a Catholic university. And he did it all with persistent incoherence. 
Jenkins ignored the substantive defect<; of the Queer Film Festival and gave it a license as long as it goes by its new name. That is like dealing with a soilod diaper by changing the pins. That validation of the Qm~er Film Fostival may be more significant, but "The Vagina Monologues" was the focus of his statement. 
Jenkins fell for the lie that the "Monologues" oppose violence against womon. "Tho Vagina Monologues" promotes that violence. First, the pro­ceeds go to the YWCA, which informs pregnant women about abortion. in which about half of those murdered are women. Second. the "Monologues" encourage such violence by objectifying women. The human person, as Pope John Paul II put it. is a "unified totality" of body and soul. "The Vagina Monologues" fragments that unity by personifYing a body part and equating the woman to that part. 
The "Monologues" present the vagina as an entity with which the woman should establi'ih a "conscious relation­ship." It includes such gems as, "If your vagina got dressed, what would it wear?" and "If your vagina could talk, what would it say, in two words?" The "Monologues" recount the lesbian seduction of a 16-year-old by a 24-year-old, which the victim describes as "my ... salvation." Another mono­logue consist'> of the repetition of a four-letter expletive describing a body part. Other monologists recount conver­sations with their vaginas or vulvae. Others describe lesbian sexual acts. One monologue recounts a group masturba­tion. with the aid of hand mirrors, in a workshop run by "a woman who believes in vaginas." The decisive moment 

Charles Rice 
Right or Wrong? 

came when a participant thought, "I didn't have to find it. I had to be it. Be it. Be my clitoris. My vagina, my vagina, me." This moronic equation of a woman with her body part facilitates the violence the "Monologues" claim to oppose. 
Jenkins would "suppress speech" only ifit were "overt and insistent in its contempt for the values and sensibilities of this University, or of any of the diverse groups that form part of our community." Those, including Bishop John M. D'Arcy, who rightly see "The Vagina Monologues" as a "contempt for [their) values and sensibilities," do not count, in the Jenkins world, as one of those "diverse groups." Bishops, incidentally, "should be seen not as external agent'i but as participants in the life of the Catholic university" (Ex Corde Ecclesiae, Application, III). 
Jenkins' Jan. 23 address said, of an anti-Semitic play, "I do not believe that such a performance could be permitted at Notre Dame." He got that right: "Its anti-Semitic ele­ments are clearly and outrageously opposed to the values of a Catholic university." But what about "The Vagina Monologues" and the Queer Film Festival? The Jenkins Statement says that "[The Monologues') portrayals of sexu­ality [are] in opposition to Catholic teaching.~· So they should be banned, right? Guess again: 
"It is essential," said Jenkins, "that we hear a full range of views....but ... we must ... bring these ... views into dialogue with the Catholic ... tradition. This demands balance ... and the inclusion of the Catholic perspective ... !Tihis year's ["Monologues"] was brought into dialogue ... through pan­els which ... taught me ... that the creative contextualization of a play like ["The Vagina Monologues"] can bring certain perspectives on important i'isues into a constructive and fruitful dialogue with the Catholic tradition." Translating the jargon, his bottom line is, "I see no reason to prohibit ("The Vagina Monologues"]." 
So Jenkins, correctly, would bar the anti-Semitic play, even with a panel. Such a play is a lie. But so are the "Monologues" and the Queer Film Festival. Jenkins would allow "The Vagina Monologues" ifit is followed by a panel including the Catholic "perspective" as a debatable alterna­tive. The Catholic university "guarantees academic freedom ... within the confines of the truth and the common good" (Ex Corde Ecclesiae, no. 12). That truth, a unity of faith and reason, includes the ennobling Catholic teaching on women and sexuality. It is objective and normative, not one of the "perspectives" that might be nonjudgmentally included in a panel at Michigan State. 
Why do the "Monologues" and the Queer Film Festival get an easy pass at Notre Dame? In our politically correct cul­ture, it is open season on Catholic sexual morality. That teaching can be advanced only as one "perspective" without any serious claim to objective validity. Jenkins, playing that game, confirms that political correctness is the operative official religion of Notre Dame. His statement patronized faculty and students with a self-centered concept of free­dom, divorced from any duty to objective truth. That con­cept corresponds to the "relativism" which, in Pope Benedict XVI's words, "recognizes nothing as absolute and ... leaves the I and its whims a'i the ultimate measure." 
Incidentally, Jenkins' encouragement of "Loyal Daughters," a proposed play of uncertain content, hi'i cre­ation of a diverse and predictably useless committee to dis­cuss things and his announcement of porous guidelines for events, all amount to a fig leaf to cover an accommodation to the relativist, homosexual culture. 
President Brian J. Shanley, O.P., got it right in banning "The Vagina Monologues" at Providence College. "A Catholic college" said Shanley, "cannot sanction the per­formance of works of art that are inimical to the teaching of the Church in an area as important as female sexuality and the dignity of women." Jenkins should have borrowed tl1e Shanley statement. 
The Closing Statement is well named. It closes the effec­tive phase of the Jenkins presidency. It involves no animosi­ty or di'irespect toward Jenkins to conclude, with regret, that he should resign or be removed.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Crisis in Uganda an affront to Catholicism 
What determines the Catholic character of Notre Dame? While recent campus debates are legitimate and important, I lear such confrontational discourse has distracted the Notre Dame community from other issues which constitute a much more potent affront to the tenets ofour faith in its contemporary context. Our late Holy Father, Pope John Paul II, wrote in his apostolic exhortation Ecdesia in Africa that the global Catholic community is caUed to engage in "an organic pastoral solidarity within the entire African territory." Unfortunately, we have patently failed to achieve such solidarity, and modern depravities of the most abhorrent nature occ\lr without notice or challenge from the majority ofAmerican Catholics. 
For the past 20 years, northern Uganda has been besieged by a campaign of brutality and violence executed by the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA), a rebel group intent upon overthrowing the Government of Uganda and expressing no political agenda aside from terror. The LRA's methodology is chilling: rebel leaders abduct children from their homes and force them to partake in the group's ruthless crusade of death and destruction, often­times against their own families and villages. Those who have managed to survive the deadly assaults languish in the squalid conditions of Internally Displaced People camps, where excess deaths due to disease and malnutrition claim the lives of 1,000 people per week (a death rate which is three times that of Iraq). Since the LRA's formation two decades ago, experts estimate that as many as 66,000 children have been abducted and enslaved as child soldiers. 
Plagued with an unremitting fear of abduction, tens of thousands of children-the "night commuters" of northern Uganda-take to the streets each night and walk incredible dis­tances to avoid the LRA. They sleep without shelter or protection, their bodies piled upon one another in public parks and doorways. Jan Egeland, the United Nations Under­Secretary General for Humanitarian Affairs, has referred to the situation in northern Uganda as "the world's worst neglected humanitarian crisis," and called for the interna­tiona! community's resolute action to end this "moral outrage." 
Yet the crisis persists. The world has shamefully turned its back on the suffering of those whom Jesus would assuredly consider "the poor in spirit." Given the conditions of northern Uganda, it is morally unjustifiable for any Christian to remain complacent while such degradations of humanity exist. This issue transcends partisan lines to offend every person of good will, and it is our duty as members of a Catholic institution to take responsibility for the lives of the people of northern Uganda. 
The iniquities occurring are unambiguous, as should be our unity in their opposition. With one voice, we should decry the horrors of the LRA and utilize our outrage to effect real change. We must appeal to local leaders to mobilize grassroots efforts to address the conflict in northern Uganda; we must petition the U.S. government to support peace processes and dedicate more resources to emergency aid in the region; we must entreat the United Nations Security Council to pass a resolution acknowledging and .attending to the crisis. Most impor­tantly, we must become informed and active participants in halting the atrocities of northern Uganda. On behalf of the Uganda Conflict Action Network, I implore the Notre Dame com­munity to make this matter a personal priority. You can begin by attending the Mock Trial of world leaders tonight at 6 p.m. at Fieldhouse Mall and visiting our website (ugandacan.org) for more information on becoming involved in this vital cause. 
·Notre Dame's true Catholic character can and should be demonstrated through a com­mitment to ending this crisis, for it is only when the anguished cries ofour Ugandan broth­ers and sisters are answered with loving compassion that we can stand in solidarity as the one human family Jesus intended.

'Jockular' is just a joke 
Recently "Jockular" has been at the receiving end of criticism from certain members of the community. I thought about this at length and decided this to be a debate between sponsorship and censorship. Then I thought about it again. It's just a dumb cartoon. Much to my chagrin, some people take stick ligures to be deep, insightful commentaries into the state of the Notre Dame community. I once saw Erik Powers at a party and Alec White checked his email in the computer next to me the other day. I don't really know them, but they don't look like they hate Saint Mary's. I would like to remind certain members of the community that it is okay to laugh every once in a while. "Jockular" is not :·deeply insulting and unacceptable," its just a damn comic strip. I commend the work of the artists and implore them to continue mak­ing fun of everything that is Notre Dame. Oh yeah, and Saint Mary's, too.

lsc~&Ii&ol That crazy Cruise 
Tom Cruise seams mn. I don't mean the scrnaming, lifn-11ashing before­my-nyns-typn of seared. I nwan scary in that uncomfortable, "oh-(;od­plnase-l~ave-nw-alone" type of scarnd. If" I saw him, I wouldn't bn in awn of his tal­nnt, or his wealth, or his gaudy movin-star lif"nstyh~. I would litnrally lw f"right­nnnd. 
It's not that Cruisn isn't a good artor. l'vn m1joynd many or his !licks -some I would nvnn plan~ in my "Top 5" rnovin list {Jerry Maguire is one of my favorites). But latnly, Tom, you've gotten a little out there. 
It all seemed to start with that fate­f"ul Oprah show. We've all seen it or at least heard of it. Cruise, agp, 43, made liko a hopped-up live-yflar old ­jumping on the couch, grabbing Oprah and screaming, ''I'm in lovp,!" Some poople praised Cruise's outright disre­gard in self-dignity in claiming his love for Katie Holmes. To me, I found it just plain creepy. 
Cruise appeared to be completely out of his mind. Yeah, love will make you do erazy things. But not literally! Crazy things are thinking about some­one all tho time or going out of your way for someone like you haven't done before -not things that will make a strong caso for your eandidaey ror hospitalization. 
But even with all that, I eould deal with it. Cruise was overeome with joy at his newfound amour with his young (ago 27) significant other. But it didn't stop thorn. Cruise spent the nflxt few months spastically rambling about his life with llolmes and Scientology and soomingly whatover abstraet th(lught came to his mind. Cruise increasingly made less and less sense until his blathering monologues finally became too much to handle. 

Chris McGrady 
Assistant Scene Editor 
There was talk of his relationship with Holmes as a publicity stunt, that there was a contract signed between the two that included having a baby. Ifow much of that is truth is rflally unknown. but of course, therfl was f"uss between Cruise and the family of his now-fiancee. Everything was the absolute height of drama for the llollywood pair. And why not? Cruise's on-camera dramatics had been mak­ing him famous for years -why stop there? 
As fate would have it, Holmes bncame pregnant, and Cruise, in his typical fashion, freaked out. The spiri­tuality of the whole thing was over­whelming, and Cruise yelled, and hopped and thn~w his arms up in excitement. All the while shrinking me further and further into my unhappy, depressive stage of fright. 
Maybe I'm making a bigger deal of this than is necessary. But, I ean't help but look at Cruise in a completely dif­ferent light. He joked about eating the placenta of his child. Eating the pla­centa?! Maybe Val Kilmer was right in the fighter-pilot flick "Top Gun"­Cruise "is dangerous." Probably not dangerous in the literal sense -I don't think Cruise would hurt anyone. But Cruise is definitely at least dan­gerous to my sanity. How would it look if every time I saw Cruise on screen I instinetively cowered into the fetal position? Probably not very good, and this is a problem. 
Don't get me wrong-I wish Cruise and his fiancee and their newborn daughter Suri the best of luck, I really do. But this new version of Cruise­the rambling, yelling, eecentric Cruise -is just a little too much "Vanilla Sky" and not quitfl enough "Mission Impossible" for me. And as mueh as it pains me to do so, I guess it's just the time that I say goodbye to the Cruise that "had me at hello."

VIDEO GAME REVIEWS 
'Katamari' rolls int 
As the mass of the katamari grows, it is able to consume larger and larger objects. During the initial stages, attractive items to collect include thumbtacks, pencils and bananas. However, during later levels, peo­ple, cars, buildings, ocean liners and even the Eif'fel Tower are ready to be rolled up and await the King of' All Cosmos' island-creating Hoyal Puff. Think of' it as combining the exdtmnent of professional snowball rolling with the satisfaction of' competitive rubber band ball assembling. 
As opposed to earlier Katamari games where the sole goal was to turn a 10 cen­timetnr katamari into a 1 0-mnter katarnari, "Me and My Katamari"adds dillilrPnt vari­ables that nond to be attended to. Wlwn a small worker ant rnquests a swnnt-as-sugar island for its queen, thn pint-siznd prince is charg«ld with thn rnsponsibility of' cmating a candied katamari packed with enough sweets to give a dentist nightmares.

former to the PlayStation Portable (]>SPJ is the handheld's unfortunate lack of dual ana­logue controls. Gaining a basic understanding of the controls takes a couple rounds whereas complete mastery of the kata­mari art takes a considerably longer time. 
The soundtrack offers little new material -simply a rehashed remix of tunes from previous katamari games. The 


By TREVOR GASS Scene Critic 
Namco keeps the ball rolling with its latest rfllease in the Katamari series -the outra­geously outlandish yet enjoyably eccentric "Me and My Katamari." Not only is the game a dashing display of the undflniable prowess the Japanese possess in the ways of propnr English grammar, but it is also a tnstament to their ability to create ridiculously wacky, dangerously addictive video gamfls. 
In a spring brnak blunder of preposterous proportions, the charismatic King of All Cosmos inadvertently creates a tsunami that washes out a number of nflarby animal inhabitnd islands. It is now up to thn young Prince to set things right by creating special­ized katamari islands to fit each animal's needs. 
Though the "Katamari" series has gained popularity since the release of "Katamari Damacy" for the PlayStation 2 ( PS2) in September of 2004, it is still quite a nichn game. For those unfamiliar, the premise is simple as rolling a snowball into a snowman. But instead of snow, the player picks up everything and anything in sight. 
'Streetwise' appeals 
By MARK BEMENDERFER 
Assistant Scene Editor 

There is a fine line between continuing a successful franchise and bleeding it dry. Capcom's "Hesident Evil" is an example of the former -it's a game-of-the-year expe­rience. 
But another of its recent releases, "Final Fight: Streetwise," is an example of thfl latter. 
The original "Final Fight" was released back in the height of the areade frenzy, where huddling in the dark with a bunch of guys around a glowing vertieal video game unit was the epitome of eool for teenagers. A plethora of sequels followed quickly, but a nearly deeade-long dry spell followed. Handom "Final Fights" lit up the arcade scene as well as Super Nintendo and Sega Saturn, but there hasn't been a new one in reeent memory, and for good reason. 
The "Final Fight" games fit firmly into the side-serolling fighting genre, much like "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles."The latest iteration features a three-dimensional facelift, creating a fully 360-degree brawl­ing environment. The controls are also updated, giving a eomplex collection of catastrophic combos under the player's control. 
The setting is still Metro City, the loca­tion of the original game. Most of the orig­inal stars play a role in "Streetwise," including the original trio of playable characters. The player assumes control of Kyle, the younger brother of the original lighter Cody. Kyle is an underground light­er, making ends meet by scrapping with other combatants. Cody has aged a bit since the first game and is unable to fight anymore. However, his competitive nature lives on, and he disappears early into the game into shady cireles. The rest of the game follows Kyle's search for his older sibling. 
It ison this quest that he runs into many fan favorites, including ex-mayor and muscle man Haggar and karate master Guy. Other favorites also pop up -some­times unexpectedly -but in ways that always delight fans of the series. Kyle can participate in pit fights throughout the 
story to earn money, and many of Capcom 's eoolest eameos appear during the lights. 
For hardcore fans of the original, there are two additional modes included in addi­tion to the story mode. A multi-player arcade mode -featuring multiple playable characters in addition to Kyle ­and the original "Final Fight"can also bn unlocked. 
However, for everything the game does 
correctly, there is something done poorly. One of the major omissions is the lack of a multi-player mode during the story mode. Included in the draws of the original was the ability to face tho gangs of Metro City with a friend, which is sorely missing from this sequel. 
The brutal nature of the fights is also dampened by a finicky camera -fnnding ofT hordes of' drugged mmnies is made morn difficult by having

Men's Rowing 
Notre Dame returned to Indianapolis' Eagle Creek 
... 
Heservoir Saturday to com­pete in the Indianapolis Invitational. The morning rac­ing featured two Irish eight­man crews racing in qualify­ing heats, and two more rac­ing in grand finals. In the afternoon, all four of the Notre Dame eight-man crews raced in a final event. 
The novice eight crew of coxswain Bryce Chung, stroke Karol Grzesiak, Tom Mazzacavallo, Andrew Matasic, Hay Schleck, Brendan McNutt, Matt Napierski, Taylor Donaldson and Hob Bowen finished fourth in their heat to qualify for the petite finals. In the afternoon racing, the novice boat took first in the Petite Final over Northwestern, Miami and St. Thomas, with Matt Degnan rowing for Karol Grzesiak. 
The next event for a Notre Dame crew was the second varsity eight grand final. Coxswain Julie Lambe's boat of stroke Scott Campbell, Michael Lucci.

State (6:51.8) to secure the medal. In the afternoon com­pilation Grand Final, which included the top three finish­ers from each the second var­sity eight and the lightweight eight races, and the top fin­isher from the third varsity eight race, the Irish boat fin­ished sixth with Michael Lutkus rowing for Brandon Carroll.

McAward, Dan Murphy, Johann deSousa, Craig Wiborg and Jordan Frankel also claimed a bronze medal in 7:15.7, just edging out Ohio State (7:17.2). Radhika Deva coxed the boat to sixth in the afternoon compilation Petite Final, with Carroll rowing for Lutkus. 
The last races of the morn­ing were the first varsity qualifying heats.

In the first of three heats, the Notre Dame boat of coxswain Gigi Gutierrez, stroke Dan Pearson, Nick Mathew, Jake Teitgen, Grzesiak, Teddy Hawks, Steve Maher, Kane Pithey and Nicky Catella qual­ified for the grand finals by finishing second to Michigan in their heat, outpacing three other boats. The varsity eight finished seventh in the after­noon grand final.

well  as  a  road  race  on  
Sunday.  

Mike Lavery, Tim Campbell, Matt Prygoski and Geoff Gisler raced as the Four-man team in the B division, finishing in third place. 
The criterium was hotly contested with NCAA points at stake, and numerous crashes marred the race. Andy Steves took points in two prime sprints and rode to a fifth place finish. Prygoski, Gisler, Lavery, and Campbell finished No. 13, No. 15, No. 19 and No. 32 respectively in the 52-man field.

Streak 
continued from page 24 
''I'm hoping that it's going to be a great crowd just like we had this weekend," Notre Dame coach Paul Mainieri .said. "Obviously, playing on national TV is a great opportunity, and I think everybody's excited." 
The contest comes a day after Notre Dame jumped eight spots to No. 8 in College Baseball Newspaper's top-30 and six spots to No. 12 in Baseball America's poll. The team bene­fited as 22 of the top-25 teams lost at least one game last week. with 18 losing to lower­ranked squads. 
"You'd much rather be recog­nized by the pollsters and the people in the community than not," Mainieri said. "The thing we have to guard against is liv­ing in the past." 
Notre Dame first baseman Craig Cooper earned Louisville Slugger national player of the week honors Monday after bat­ting over .500 in the team's pre­vious five games. Cooper fur­thered his now-22-game hit streak, batting .526 (10-for-19) with 13 RBis, four homers and nine runs. He was 8-for-11 with three homers and nine RBis in Notre Dame's weekend sweep of Rutgers (17-18-1, 7-8 Big East). 
Mainieri will send sophomore left-bander Wade Korpi to the mound against Purdue. 


Korpi is 4-1 with a 1.80 ERA -No. 2 in the Big East -in seven starts. He has held oppo­nents to a .208 batting average while striking out 58 and allow­ing 33 hits in 45 innings. 
Purdue did not name its start­in-g pitcher Monday. Boilermakers sophomore Allan Donato started the team's last mid-week contest, a 9-8 victory over Illinois State April 12. Donato did not earn a decision in the game. He allowed four runs and six hits in four innings. 
"Whoever it is, we'll get a lit­tle preparation for them and we'll get ready to go," Mainieri said. "My guess is that they're probably going to split up the game with a number of pitch­ers, but I don't know that for a fact." 
Boilermakers infielder Mitch Hilligoss leads the Purdue offense from the top of the line­up. A third-team All-American in 2005, Hilligoss enters the contest with a .407 batting average, five homers and 28 RBI. 
"Purdue has a really good team," Mainieri said. "We're expecting a real dog fight .... We're going to have to be at the top of our game to be able to beat them." 
Purdue first baseman Eric Wolfe hits third and enters bat­ting .386 with four homers and 33 RBI. 
Notre Dame has won the pre­vious two matchups in the series, including last year's 9-7 extra-inning victory at Coveleski Stadium in downtown South Bend. 
The Boilermakers dropped two of three games from Michigan in West Lafayette, 


Ind., this weekend but rebound­ed with a 10-5 victory Sunday. 
Notre Dame leads the all-time series 75-38-3. 
Despite the team's 22-game winning streak, Mainieri is not fully satisfied with what the Irish have done. 
"We still have a long way to go, and we still haven't accom­plished any of our goals yet," he said. "We haven't won a regu­lar-season title -we haven't 
.­
achieved an NCAA tournament bid." 
Notre Dame takes on Bowling Green Wednesday at Frank Eck Stadium and then flies to Storrs, Conn., for a three-game week­end series with the Connecticut Huskies, who currently own second place in the Big East with a 13-3 conference record.

While the Belles' sched­uled matches against Goshen have been can­celled in the past two years, Goshen played Kalamazoo on Saturday and lost both games 6-5 and2-1. 
The Maple Leafs are in a 21-game losing streak and have struggled offensively. They posted only three hits in their 9-0 and 3-0 losses against their rivals, the University of St. Francis, on April 15. 
Goshen will look to rely on sophomore pitcher Erin Layman. who recorded a

But Saint Mary's hopes to shut down Goshen early. If the Belles can get an early lead, Sullivan said, she believes they will hold it. 
The Belles head into their match against Goshen with the MIAA tournament only 10 days away. 
Sullivan said the team wants to finish the snason off strong and look toward the postseason and the possibilties there. 
"We want to secure our spot in the conference tournament," Sullivan said.

five points, most of them acro­batic lay-ups through multiple defenders. 
Irish Hockey tried to use its size advantage as much as pos­sible, muscling its way to close lay-ups. Freshman Christian Hanson, a center for the Irish during the winter, led all scor­ers in the game with eight buckets. 
"I was just trying to look good out there," Hanson said. "We had a couple of chances to get back in the game but we just didn't make the baskets when we needed to." 
After falling behind early, Irish Hockey mounted a come­back to pull within one point on three different occasions, but Rule No. 76 managed to hold them off each time. 
Wes O'Neill and Tony Gill also added to the offense for Irish Hockey, scoring three and seven points, respectively. 
The main problem for the team was getting into early foul trouble. 76's Danny Nesbon took the brunt of the fouls and was one-for-two on foul shot attempts. He also scored four other points down low. 
"I think we did pretty well out there -we're excited for the next round," Martin said. 
Huggie's Place 21 
Duffy's Girl 12 
Ty Martin dropped 10 points last night as Huggie's Place advanced to the round of 32 with a 21-12 win over Duffy's' Girl. 
Huggie's Place got off to a slow start as it struggled to find good shots against the quick 2-3 zone that Duffy's Girl had mastered. But with Martin leading the way the team came up with a 6-0 run to finish off the first half with an 11-8 lead. 
"We started off a little slow, but once we calmed down and started breaking down their zone we were fine," Martin said. 
Martin was helped by his brother, Beau-who had three points -and Ernest Berni, who played point guard and had five baskets of his own. 
Andrew Crow, an outside shooter, rounded out the scar­ing for Huggie's with three. 
Duffy's Girl cooled off after its quick start and struggled to keep the game close, plagued with turnovers throughout the second half. 
The team's biggest offensive contributors were Michael Duffy and Pete Vandeventer, with four points each. Duffy was able to use his size early on and consistently won posi­tion under the hoop for easy layups. Vandeventer, the team's outside threat, used his speed to find openings in the defense for his four baskets. 
Duffy's Girl members left before they were able to be reached for comment. 
Sparkle Motion 21 
Guards R Us 14 
Darius Walker made his first -and last -appearance in the 2006 Bookstore Basketball Tournament Monday, as his Guards R Us fell to Sparkle Motion, 21-14. 
Sparkle Motion members knew they were in for a tough game when they saw Walker walk out on the court. 
"We knew they were going to be athletic, so we just had to play fundamental basketball out there," Sparkle Motion's Chris Merino said. Merino's prediction came true as 
The Observer + SPORTS 
Sparkle used a team-oriented game to open up a quick 8-3 lead early in the first half. Sparkle was able to move the ball very well on offense, while restricting the offense of Guards R Us. All five of the Guards players struggled from the field, missing early and often both from inside and out. 
After another quick run by Sparkle fueled by fast-break layups, Guards was able to heat up from the field. Riding the hot hand of their two guards, Guards was able to close the Sparkle lead to 10-8 before Sparkle made a free throw to send the game to half­time 11-8. 
In the second half, Walker was able to find his shot, hit­ting two quick long-range shots. 
The story of the second half, however, was the tough play and hard fouls by both teams. With each team trying to establish dominance inside, neither avoided contact, and a number of players found them­selves on the ground. In such a physical game, both teams voiced their fair share of com­plaints to the refs. Walker was particularly frustrated follow­ing the game. 
Fittingly, after such a hard­fought game, the game was decided on a free throw. 
Leading 20-14, Merino was fouled hard on a breakaway lay-up. His foul shot hit noth­ing but net, giving Sparkle Motion the victory. 
Saltines 21 
Must Be 30! 14 
When the No. 12-seeded Saltines took on Must Be 30! Monday, it was a battle between youthfulness and experience. Unfortunately for Must Be 30!, youthfulness pre­vailed as the Saltines forced Must Be 30! into early retire­ment, 21-14. 
Down 5-7 midway through the first half, the Saltines were struggling to find their rhythm. "We came out a little slow. I think we were tired from yes­terday's game and it showed early on," Saltines forward Dan Ott said. 
From there, however, the Saltines went on a 6-1 run to close out the half. Using their superior height and athleti­cism, the Saltines were able to speed up the game and open it up with a series of fast breaks to open up the three-point advantage. 
At the start of the second half, both teams traded bas­kets. From there, however, Saltines again went on a 10-3 run to open up a 20-13 advan­tage. That 20th point came on one of the more exciting plays of the game as freshman Carl Andersen was on the receiving end of an alley-oop. While not the prettiest looking shot of the game, it was good enough for Andersen. 
"I just came off a screen and the ball was there," Andersen said. "I messed up the 'oop' 
. part of it, but it turned out alright." After a quick layup by Must Be 30!, the Saltines answered with a simple lay-up to seal the 21-14 victory. While Must Be 30! lost the game, Paul Minifee was proud of his team. "We are all very happy with our performance," he said. "We're not necessarily in the prime of our careers, so to have the tournament we had, that's something to be very proud of."

long time. In recent years, the games between Valparaiso and Notre Dame have been blowouts. Since the 2003 season the Irish have outscored Valparaiso 45-1 in five meetings. The one run came on a wild pitch in the third inning or the April 23, 2003 matchup. 
Along with their prolific offensive numbers, the Irish have held the Crusaders to four hits in the last six meet­ings and recorded at least one no-hitter each season sinee 2003. In 2004, pitcher Stnphanin Stenglein threw a perfeet game in a 9-0 rout. 
Senior pitcher Heather Booth is coming off of her own perfect game Sunday against Hutgers. She will get 
the start in today's game where she will look to con­tinue her dominance against the Crusaders. 
"Every day is a new day and I hope that she takes the same thought process into the Valpo game," Gumpf said. 
The key to her suceess will be shutting down the top two 
hitters in the lineup  - out­ 
fielders  Ann  Sievert  and
