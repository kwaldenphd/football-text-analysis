Members hope to improve participation in student government elections 
By JOSEPH McMAHON News Writer 
Troubled by apathy and a lack of participation in student govcrnnwnt affairs, the Council of Hepresentatives announced Tuesday its plans to launch its own "Hock the Vote" campaign to encourage a bigger turnout in the upcoming student gov­ernment elections. 
The campaign will begin Feb. 4 and last until the primary election day, Feb. 10. represen­tatives said during the Council's meeting Tuesday.

'Loyal Daughters' gets male angle in co-writer 
By AMBER TRAVIS 
News Writer 
A man will be in charge of "Loyal Daughters and Sons" next year when sophomore Devin Preston assumes the role of co-writer of the play, which focuses on sexuality and sexual abuse at Notre Dame, from senior Sarah Van Mill. 
"I was really honored and grateful that [Van Mill] thought that I was capable of such an important position," Preston said. 
In his role as co-writer -a singular position -Preston will be in charge of any new material included in next year's production. The rest of the program will consist of past stories from original writer Emily Weisbecker and Van Mill, who co-wrote this year's production. 
A physics and film, television and theatre student, Preston will take on Van Mill's duties and conduct a new round of interviews with victims of sex­ual assault. Using findings from the interviews, he will produce the scripts for any new vignettes that will be added to the program. 
Preston, a former Observer sports writer, said he was struck by "Loyal Daughters" and admired its ability to bring to public discourse sexuality, a subject he says is taboo on campus.

Campus gangs up on Zahm in snow fight 
500 students participate in frozen matchup; quads set rivalries aside, join against the Rabid Bats 
By JAY FITZPATRICK 
News Writer 
There on the frozen tundra of North Quad, Zahm stood against the world. 
The combined forces of North and South Quads -traditional enemies in the annual snow­ball fight that accompanies the winter season's first accumula­tion of snow -numbered an estimated 500 hurlers early Wednesday morning and backed the "Zahmbies" into the corner that separates their dorm from neighboring 


Professor discusses sex slavery on NBC 
Carr, human trafficking victim talk to MSNBC, 'Today Show' about forced labor in America 

By KATIE PERALTA 
News Writer 

The story of a 20-year-old Ukrainian woman and her months of forced labor at a strip club in Detroit shocked attendees at a Notre Dame panel on human trafficking in November, and now it reached audiences across America. 
MSNBC and The Today Show aired reports Monday about slavery in America, featuring the young victim -who assumed the name "Katya" for privacy purposes-and Notre Dame law professor Bridgette Carr. 
Carr and Katya, her client, told cameras that three years ago Katya and a friend left the Ukraine to study English abroad. The two young women had plans to work as Cavanaugh Hall. 
But the Zahm residents would not fold. 
Zahm freshman Scott Wilkinsen was confident in his dorm's performance in the early goings of the fight. 
"We're taking it. It's not ter­rible," he said. "It's fine if they want to come and get us ­we'll take them anywhere, any­place. We went over there and started stuff, and they came back here. It's kind of dissipat­ing. We're taking it to them I think."

waitresses in Virginia Beach while they learned the lan­guage, but instead, two human traffickers -Alex Macksimenko and Michael Aronov -picked them up at the airport and took them to Detroit, Carr said. 
The men imprisoned Katya and her friend in a house with 15 other slaves, Katya said. Their captors forced the women to work 12-hour shifts as exotic dancers in Cheetah's, a strip club. 
"We would go to work, work 12 hours a day there. And, and the end of the shift, [at] 2 a.m., [the captors] were wait­ing for us outside of the club in the car. Sometimes they raped us there," Katya said during the MSNBC documen­tary "MSNBC Undercover: Sex

Club23up for sale on Craigslist 
Owner says shooting ofstudents not afactor 
By MARCELA BERRIOS Associate News Editor 
Club 23 owner Mahmoud Hussein has put the bar he has owned for more than 20 years up for sale -on Craigslist. 
The asking price for the bar, located on 744 N. Notre Dame Ave., is $695,000 and will get the buyer the tavern's 2,500 square feet of space, the building itself, the 57 -car parking lot, the furni­ture inside and the establish­ment's liquor license. 
John Veit, a bartender at Club 23, confirmed by phone Tuesday night the listing's legitimacy. 
The Observer could not reach Hussein for comment, but he told WNDU that the August 21 shoot­ing of two Notre Dame students outside the establishment had nothing to do with his decision to sell the bar. Hussein said he was tired of the late nights, WNDU reported. 
Seniors Matthew Collins and Mitchell Depree were shot by an unidentified man outside the bar's front door while they were waiting for a ride. Depree was shot in the leg, and Collins sus­tained life-threatening injuries from bullets to the abdomen and leg. 
Though both Collins and Depree recovered, Hussein told The Observer in early September he feared students were "boy­cotting" Club 23 because they didn't feel safe in the neighbor­hood anymore.

Man allegedly leaves baby to rob store 
LEHIGH ACRES, Fla. ­Deputies said a man left his three-month-old baby home alone for six hours while he robbed a groeery store. Poliee said Tony Doden and his aecompliee, James Sehmidt, were arrested after their get­away ear was spotted by a witness. 
A teenage employee told poliee a man wearing a Halloween style 'Jason' masked robbed them at gun­point and then took off. 
Deputies said Doden had left his three-month-old son at home to fend for himself while he and Sehmidt robbed the store. 
The child's mother was 

arrested in October. 
Police say the baby was found with a severe ease of diaper ra'lh. 
Tweety, Donald Duck summoned to court 
HOME -Tweety may get a ehance to take the witness stand and sing like a canary. An Italian court ordered the animated bird, along with Mickey Mouse, Donald Duek and his girlfriend Daisy, to testify in a eounterfeiting ease. 
In what lawyers believe was a derical error worthy of a Looney Tunes cartoon, a eourt in Naples sent a sum­mons to the eharacters order­ing them to appear Friday in a trial in the southern Italian 
city, officials said. 
The court summons eites Titti, Paperino, Paperina, Topolino -the Italian names for the eharaeters -as dam­aged parties in the eriminal trial of a Chinese man aceused of counterfeiting products of Disney and Warner Bros. 
Instead of naming only the companies and their legal representatives, clerks also wrote in the witness list the names of the eartoons that deeorated the toys and gadg­ets the man had reprodueed, said Fiorenza Sorotto, vice president of Disney Company ltalia.

Snow 
continued from page 1 
By 12:30 a.m. Wednesday, between 200 and 300 students remained in the fight. Participants said the total numbers had been almost double that in the preced­ing hour, though the mounting casualties did not seem to affect the snow fighters' mentality. 
Wilkinsen quipped that Zahm's oll'season conditioning program helped its residents prepare for Tuesday's showdown against its numerous adversaries. 
"We actually worked out in Florida over the summer working with sand castles, working with compacting sand and it worked well. I think it paid off today," he said. 
After several minutes of waiting for thfl right time for an offensive charge -after a reload of fresh supplies of hot cocoa -the Rabid Bats launched their attack. As the South Quad denizens sat back complacently, Zahm ran forward, snowballs at the ready, flinging them with wild abandon at the other lines. 
"We felt that we had the num­bers. Just some tactics we've been working out," Wilkinsen said. " ... You ean't sit back. Just like you've got to take it to the terrorists, you've got to take it to the South Quad people." 
But it wasn't only South Quad people. On the other side of the conflict, Dillon freshman Adam Carlson said the main difl'erence bP-twnen this year's matchup and last year's was the nature of the combatants. · 
"This one is prfltty much every­one against Zahm," he said. "Last year was a· lot more like North Quad versus South Quad. Pretty much everybody hates Zahm, I guess." 
In the fight. Carlson said, he "hit some bros in the face." 
"It's pmtty much the best feel­ing you can have in the winter," he said. 
But Notre Dame's first snowfall stretched far beyond the battle waging up north. Many students ventured into the snow on South Quad to play full-contact football without pads -not quite a Notre Dame tradition during the first snowfall. 
A matchup between an option­style attack led by Dillon fresh­man Hyan Patton and a high-fly­ing spread lead by Dillon fresh­man Matt Seioscia took place on South Quad early Wednesday morning. 
Scioseia. who played def(msive end fi1r three years in high school in California. never played in the conditions he faced in Wndnesday's game. In fact, Scioscia had never even seen snow before Tuesday -except for on television. 
"I did not think it would be this cold." Sdosda said. "It's actually protty fun. but it's freezing." 
Seiosda said he and his dorm­mates decided in the spur of a moment to venture outside and start a game of snow football. although he is excited for the prospeeL<> of a snowy winter. 
"If it keeps snowing like this I think we'll be able to have a lot of fun and a lot of snowfights," he said. 
But not everyone outside early Wednesday morning was there f(Jr the thrill of battle and compe­tition. Some just like the snow. 
Walsh freshman Julifl Zorb and her friends -some of whom also had never seen snow before ­lef't the cozy confines of their dorm for the simple reason of being ouL<>ide. 
"We wanted something to do," Zorb said. 'The snow is exciting."

And Preston is proud of 
those efforts. 

"I feel like the writers and producers of 'Loyal Daughters and Sons' -in the two years that I've seen it and been a part of it ­have done a very good job of incorporating the male per­spective and the male expe­rience." 
Even though it has been written and directed by women, Preston said. the production has made an effort to inelude other angles and that organizers are con­tinuously "trying to make sure we get the whole pic­turn." 
And a male interviewer may succeed in grasping that picture by connecting with male intervinwees in ways a woman could not, he said. 
Preston said that as a writer and intorviewnr he would attnrnpt to make male students a bit more comfort­able telling their stories to the "Loyal Daughtnrs." 
The inter-views, which are conducted every year and are voluntary, will produce the fresh matnrial for next year's production, he said. The advertisements for interviews for nnxt year's production have yet to be posted. 
"Loyal Daughters and Sons" is one of many produc­tions that Preston has partic­ipated in since he came to Notre Damn but this produc­tion will bo his first experi­ence as a writer and inter­viewer. 
"I know it's going to be a lot of work and a lot or (~mo­tional strain, but, at the same time, I am looking for­ward to and anxious to move this project along," he said.

Bush: Iran dangerous despite report 
New intelligence findings show Persian country halted nuclear weapons program in 2003 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON Defending his credibility, President Bush said Tuesday that Iran is dangerous and must be squeezed by interna­tional pressure despite a blockbuster intelligence find­ing that Tehran halted its nuclear weapons program fimr years ago. 
Bush said the new conclu­sion -contradicting earlier 
U.S. assessments-would not prompt him to take off the table the possibility of pre­emptive military action against Iran. Nor will the United States change its poli­cy of trying to isolate Iran diplomatically and punish it with sanctions, he said. 
"Look, Iran was dangerous, Iran is dangerous and Iran will be dangerous if they have the knowledge necessary to make a nuclear weapon," the president told a Whitn House news conference a day after the release of a new national intPlligence estimate repre­senting the consensus of' all 
U.S. spy agencies. 
On Capitol Hill, congres­sional Democrats said they hoped the report would have a cooling effect on the admin­istration's rhetoric, which they said was hyped and counterproductive. At a cam­paign debate in Iowa, seven Democratic presidential can­didates stood in agreement the program, they halted the reaching out to the foreign Monday's report, the adminis­that the United States should program.

A Hannah Montana card game case, a Go Diego Go! backpack and Circo brand shoes were among the items with excessive lead levels in the tests performed by a coalition of environ­mental health groups across the country. 
Only 20 percent of the toys and other products had no trace of lead or harmful chemicals, according to the results being released Wednesday by the Michigan-based Ecology Center along with the national Center for llealth, Environment and Justice and groups in eight other states. 
Of the 1,268 items tested, 23 were among mil­lions of toys recalled this year. 
Mattei Inc. recalled more than 21 million Chinese-made toys on fears they were tainted with lead paint and tiny magnets that children could accidentally swallow. Mattei's own tests on the toys found that they had lead levels up to 200 times the accepted limit. 

U.S. looks to strengthen power grid 
WASHINGTON -Energy officials announced Tuesday they will re-examine a decision to declare a large swath of the mid-Atlantic and two Southwest states a priority area for new power lines -a nod to those fighting proposed lines in their communities. 
The Energy Department said it would grant a rehearing on its October decision to deelare two areas of the country as "national interest electric transmission corridors," a new legal designation designed to foster greater power line con­struction in order to ease the threat of blackouts.· 
Local groups often resist such proposed lines in their communities, saying they are ugly, unnecessary, and diminish the quali­ty of life. Advocates for the corridor law say it's necessary to avoid future black·· outs as the nation's energy grid ages and demand for electricity rises. 

Writers' strike reaches fifth week 
Negotiations resume after four-day recess as networks prepare for spring season 
Associated Press 

LOS ANGELES -The TV industry braced Tuesday for what could become a long strike by writers, even as both sides returned to the bargaining table. 
Leslie Moonves, chief exec­utive officer of CBS Corp., told an investor conference in New York that he was hopeful, but "not terribly optimistic." 
The two sides conceded there was likely to be ratings shortfalls if the five-week strike dragged on, Moonves said. Programming costs would fall as well, resulting in no significant financial impact to the network in the short to medium term, Moonves said. 
Bargaining resumed in Los Angeles after a four-day recess, with a relatively scant $21 million separating con­tract proposals by studios and striking Hollywood writ­ers. 
The more telling figure involves the $20,000-plus that writers now earn for a single network rerun of a TV episode and the $250 the studios are offering for a year's online reuse of an hourlong show. That repre­sents the chasm between the old business order and bur­geoning new media faced by negotiators as they try to end serial-killer drama.

cheerleaders. Every few years, millions of Americans pay homage at the dmnoeratic altar while casting their bal­lot for the seemingly less moronic politi­cian of their choice. It is an American tradition, on par with the great Catholic traditions of old. 
Our president is certainly not one to hmak tradition. No one really knows for certain whether the real reason the U.S. invaded Iraq was to get rid of Saddam llussein's apparent stockpile of WMDs as originally claimed. but the president knows one thing for sure: We're "spreading democracy" in Iraq. and that's something the U.S. should be darn proud of. 
Lest the American public forget this point, the president decided to name our little overseas excursion "Operation Iraqi Frm~dom." Apparently, he sees absolutely no difference between democracy and freedom. In his 2004 State of tho Union Address, the presi­dent said, "we also hear doubts that democracy is a realistic goal for the greater Middle East, where freedom is rare" and, "as democracy takes hold in Iraq, the. enemies of freedom will do all in their power to spread violence and fear." 
But is democracy freedom, as many maintain without giving it a second thought? What did the founding fathers think about democracy? Does democra­cy deserve as much praise at it receives? 
The founders viewed democracy with outright distrust. President John Adams said, "[r]emember, democracy never lasts long. It soon wastes, exhausts, and murders itself. There never was a democracy yet that did not commit sui­eide." Similarly, James Madison wrote in the Fed1~ralist Papers that in a pure democracy, "there is nothing to check the inducement to sacrifice the weaker party or the obnoxious individual." Edmund B.andolph said at the Constitutional Convention that "in trac­ing these evils to their origin every man had found it in th1~ turbulence and follies of democracy." The word "democracy" is notoriously absent in the Deelaration of Independence, the Constitution or the Pledge of Allegiance. 
There were a number of reasons why the founders feared democracy. Most importantly, the founders viewed free­dom and individual rights as the most important political ends. Thomas Jefl'erson famously wrote in the Deelaration of Independence that men "are endowed by their Creator with cer­tain unalienable nights. that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness." Similarly, John Adams said that individuals have "rights antecedent to all earthly governments; rights that cannot be repealed or restrained by human laws; rights derived from the Great Legislator of the Universe." 
People should be free to act as long as they don't harm others or their property. They believed that it was the job of gov­ernmlmt to secure these rights. They knew that individual rights, and there­fore freedom, would not be safe within a dernocraey. 
In a democracy, the rights of individu­als were not protected but were subject to the whims of the majority, or as Madison said, "there is nothing to check the inducement to sacrifice the weaker party or the obnoxious individual." If the majority felt like seizing an individual's property or violating his other rights, there was nothing to stop the majority. Without proteetions in place securing the rights of the people, a democracy would almost certainly end up violating the rights of individuals and destroying their freedom. It was with this thought in mind that they created a Constitutional republic. 
They knew that democratic majorities acting through the government worn likely to try to violate the rights of minorities. Consequently, the founders wrote the Constitution to plaen wnll­defined limits on what the newly cwatNI fednral governnwnt could and eouldn't do. It guaranteed certain fundamental rights from infringement from the gov­ernment such as freedom of speech. freedom of the prnss and the right to bear arms. 

Although the people democratically elected reprnsentatives to aet on thnir behalf. they wern unable to aet on cer­tain subject matters and had to respnct the rights outlined in the Constitution. Cheeks and balances further limited the power of majorities. As a wise man once said, in a democracy, two wolves and a sheep takn a majority vote on what's for supper, but in a constitutional rnpuhlie, the wolves are forbidden on voting on what's for supper, and the sheep are well armed. 
UnliJrtunatnly, the United States is, for all intents and purposes, no longer a Constitutional republic. Congrnss rou­tinely exceeds its defined and enumerat­ed powers list1~d in the Constitution. It can do nearly anything it wants. from spending money on Social Security or health care ( ncitlwr of whkh tim Constitution gives Congrnss the power to do) to spying on pnople without war­rants. 
When the government ean do anything it wants by majority vote, including tax­ing everything under the sun, it's hardly a wonder that people are much less free to do as they pleas1~. Hestoring the Constitutional republic by actually enforcing the Constitution as written would go a long way in restoring free­dom onee again.

Green eating habits mean more than just broccoli 
Just Food, a nonprofit organization that "works to develop a just and sus­tainable food system in the New York City region," held a summit the first weekend of December in conjunction with The New School. I sat in on Mackenzie a series of work­Yangshops that focused on food, farms 
Columbia
and community 
Daily
health. In the 
Spectator
process, I picked up a great deal of green information, all of which Columbia students should know, and most of which some of them probably don't. 
For instance, eating organic produce translates to eating an extra serving of fruits and vegetables due to all the antioxidants and nutrients it has com­pared to nonorganic produce. 
Students might also be interested to know that vitamin content in nonorgan­ic fruits and vegetables has decreased by 10 to 40 percent over the years. 
With so many Japanese food options, both on campus and in the neighbor­hood, students should be aware that fish and shrimp served in sushi bars and buffets are grown in large nets that enclose antibiotics and pesticides along with the creatures' excrement. 
This isn't the only issue with fish. Raising one pound of carnivorous fish such as cod requires two to six pounds of wild fish to be ground up as feed. As a result, the rise of fish farms is wiping out some wild fish populations. 
Moreover, irradiated food -food exposed to radiation to kill off bacteria -does not have to be labeled as such, even if it's sold in restaurants, schools ami hospitals. This is disturbing, as irradiation destroys vitamins, protein and essential fatty acids, and produces chemicals that have been linked to DNA damage in human cells. 
However, due to the driving market of consumer demands, the prevalence of local, healthy food is gradually increas­ing. Over 15 percent of the world's food is now grown in cities. New York City alone has 50 farmers' markets. Columbia, in response to student groups operating under the Green Umbrella, an umbrella organization for environmental groups on campus, is also taking steps toward serving stu­dents nutritional and environmentally­friendly food. 
Although they buy the now-familiar fair-trade and organic coffee, the majority of students are unaware of Columbia's green changes. If more stu­dents knew about these options, they'd be prompted to demand even more environmentally-forward programs concerning not only food, but also the energy and waste issues on our cam­pus.

The challenge of hunting for a candidate 
With each new political debate, I get closer and closer to deciding who it is I'm not going to vote for in the next presidential election. 
I also get closer to realizing my vote means very, very little. So little, in Dan Halverson fact, that I'm thinking a write-in 
Daily
vote for "King Arthur" or Nebraskan "Sherlock Holmes" would leave me as satisfied as I could possibly get. 
It's easy to pick out who I don't want. Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama and John Edwards all come to mind. If any of them get elected, I might give up follow­ing politics and just go join the circus. 
Maybe I should do that now, but that's beside the point. 
What about Mitt Romney, Fred Thompson, Mike Huckabee or Rudy Giuliani? 
Eh. Can I hit "Reset?" 
This is really the best the Republican Party can come up with? More than 300 million people in the United States, and these are it? 
But I suppose dispirited rhetorical questions don't get us anywhere. The way I see it, we have three options. 
First, you can latch on to the "most electable" candidate and ride his or her coattails to success. It's like picking one of the two best teams at the beginning of the football season and celebrating rab­idly when they win it all at the end. 
All aboard the bandwagon! I'll admit it: This is, by and large, the extent of my support for Giuliani. I've 
been saying it for months, but if I had to vote today, Rudy would get my vote. He can beat Clinton in a general election, and that is (as sad a reflection of the times as it may be) the simple truth of the matter. I'm even willing to look past scandal and a weak platform, just because I think he is the Republicans' best chance against Clinton. 
I swear I'm not a total partisan hack -I just really don't like that woman. 
Option number two may be a little more appealing to most of us. There's something a bit more dignified in it. 
This route involves going with the mainstream candidate that you most agree with in terms of policy. Obviously no candidate is going to be perfect and no candidate is going to have a platform you completely agree with, but some are better than others. Some are, in each voters' eyes, "more right" than others. Think back to the SAT (and try not to cry). There were a couple different choices you could pick (and sometimes all the choices seemed wrong), but you still had to go with the "most correct." 
Find which candidate you think is the most correct answer, and proudly fill the bubble in after championing his or her cause to all who will listen. You like the candidate, and he or she has a reason­able chance of success. What a combi­nation. 
Unfortunately, though, this strategy, as well as the previous one, tends to only work well in the primaries. By the gen­eral election, it's usually already been narrowed down to two wrong answers, and by then you're already trapped. So if either of these strategies appeals to 
you, get involved early. The first step would probably be to take a field trip to Iowa. 
Last but not least, we have the option I'm beginning to seriously consider; this involves going with the underdog, the Appalachian State of the political world. No, I won't be casting my vote for Sherlock Holmes any time soon, but I just might go with the next closest thing. 
I'm thinking about voting for Ron Paul. Yes, the somewhat nutty doctor from Texas who seems just a bit paranoid and whose foreign policy platform is, to most Republicans, highly debatable. That Ron Paul. 
Let's be clear: I really don't think Paul has a chance to win the presidency. In fact, I'm not even sure I would want him to. I'm far from convinced he would be the best choice this country could make. But that doesn't mean I wouldn't vote for him. 
His stance on several issues, most notably his incessant calls for reduced government spending, intervention and control, are all quite appealing to this libertarian-minded young columnist. The Republican Party is generally thought to consist of fiscal conserva­tives, social conservatives and libertari­ans. Most recently, the rise of social con­servatism has dominated the party. The other branches have fallen nearly by the wayside, for reasons I'm not entirely sure of. But Paul speaks forcefully about revitalizing those legs of the stool on which the Republican Party sits, and I admire him for it. I don't buy everything he says, but he offers an alternative to the other Republican candidates. He offers a shift in thinking for the Republican Party; a shift that may be necessary to undertake if Republicans hope to win any more elections any time soon. 
Paul may not win the presidency. I doubt he will. But if enough people vote for Paul, future Republican candidates will have to take notice. There is a con­tingent of conservative voters out there concerned about the other two legs of the stool. This contingent is fearful that with too much buildup of one leg, the whole thing will topple over. 
Perhaps it's time to vote for Paul in 2008 and lose this battle to the Democrats but hope the Republican Party hits "Reset" and comes back in 2012 with a new sense of what it should stand for. A "lose the battle to win the war" political mentality, so to speak. It's something to consider, anyway. 
It's not difficult for us to pick out who we don't want to vote for. In a world full of negative campaigning and tainted candidates, that's the easy part. 
The challenge is in finding someone you're willing to support. As citizens of the United States, however, it's some­thing we all ought to do. 
So good luck and happy hunting; November will be here before you know it.

Photo courtesy hollywoodjesus.com This movie Is classic. We all grew up loving how Tim Allen explained all the secrets of Santa and answered all our great Christmas questions. How does Santa get around the world In one night? Seconds become minutes, minutes become hours, etc. How does Santa fit down the chimney? He magically shrinks until he fits. Plus, who doesn't love the idea of waking up to find your dad is Santa Claus? This is a classic movie because it is the ultimate Christmas fantasy of our generation. It's funny, and we can relate to it. Even now, it's hard to watch and not wonder if Santa really does exist. And maybe someday we'll get that Weenie Whistle we always dreamed of.

Many don't consider "Meet Me In St. Louis" a Christmas movie, but here are two hard facts: one-third of the musical takes place during Christmas, and It features Judy Garland's mesmerizing performance of "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas," which never fails to be emotional. The premise is simple; it's about a Midwestern family and the love they have for each other. Their Interactions with each other are the heart of the movie. But there really are three reasons to watch It: "The Trolley Song," "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas" and finally, the Christmas dance. Maybe It's Judy Garland's red gown or maybe It's that single moment when all of her character's dreams unexpectedly come true, but the Christmas dance scene stands out from other holiday films.

Most people I know fall in love with "White Christmas" first only to discover "Holiday Inn" later, if at all. I didn't see "White Christmas" until middle school, but by that time I was already hopelessly in love with the pairing of crooner Bing Crosby and hoofer Fred Astaire in "Holiday Inn" -the first film featuring Irving Berlin's classic song "White Christmas." Crosby as Jim Hardy and Astaire as Ted Hanover are perfect comic foils as they compete for the affection of rising star Linda Mason (Marjorie Reynolds) and sing and dance their way through Jim's Holiday Inn, that is open only on holidays. It's true that "Holiday Inn" can be enJoyed year-round. After all, one of Astaire's most daz­zling solo routmes In any of his films is the firecracker number for the Fourth of July. However, "Holiday Inn" is especially enjoyable at Christmas time. You'll know why as soon as Bing sings "White Christmas" for the first time on film, and the whole world melts around you.

Maybe it's Jimmy Stewart's sweet and pow­erful performance as George Bailey, a man who feels like life has passed him by. Or maybe we all just feel like George sometimes. But whatever it is that keeps us watching, "It's a Wonderful Life" Is a classic American film that audiences return to every Christmas season. Watching George grow from a spirited kid, to an optimistic youth, to an older and wiser adult through the eyes of his guardian angel Clarence (Henry Travers) feels like watching bits and pieces of our own lives . And Clarence's final message to George-"No man Is a failure who has friends" -rings as true to us now as It did when the film came out 60 years ago. So lasso the moon for Mary and sing "Auld Lang Syne" with George Bailey this Christmas season. Maybe you·n even find Zuzu's petals in your coat pocket.

MIAMI -The 17 -year-old suspect in the death of Sean Taylor was accused Tuesday of firing the shot that killed the Washington Redskins safety. 
A Miami-Dade grand jury identified Eric Rivera as the gunman in its indictment. 
Rivera and his three co­defendants were indicted by the grand jury on charges of first-degree felony murder and armed burglary. 
Charles Wardlow, 18; Jason Mitchell, 19; and Venjah Hunte, 20; were ordered held without bail during brief court appear­ances via a videoconference from Miami-Dade County jail. The three, who stood silently during the hearing, will remain at the jail under suicide watch after Judge John Thornton Jr.'s ruling. 
Rivera, still in custody in Fort Myers, was expected to be transported to Miami­Dade on Tuesday night and make a court appearance Wednesday. One of his attorneys said the grand jury's identification of Rivera as the gunman was expected. 
"This does not come as a surprise," said Sawyer Smith, who represents Rivera along with his father Wilbur. 
The 24-year-old Taylor died Nov. 27, a day after he was shot in the bedroom of his home. Police have said he was a victim of a botched burglary. 
"I think he's in disbelief over what occurred," said Wilbur Smith. "His expres­sion to me was that 'I can't believe this kind of thing happened."' 
Asked how he would defend his client, Wilbur Smith said simply: "Stay tuned." 
Attorneys said the four young men were agitated. 
"He's very distraught," said Hunte's attorney, Michael Hornung. "He's scared." 
Hornung offered glimpses of his client's possible involvement. He said Hunte was the only suspect with a valid driver's license and behind the wheel at least part of the time. He said Hunte did not have a gun and did not know his friends' plans. 
"Just a bunch of friends that evening said they were going to the East Coast, and he went along," Hornung said. "He had no idea what­soever what was going on." 
Hunte is cooperating with police, his attorney said, and would tell them every­thing he knows. 
Probable cause affidavits for Mitchell and Rivera said the two confessed to partic­ipating in armed burglary. According to the reports, Mitchell and Rivera admit· ted entering the home and said someone had a gun and shot Taylor, but they didn't identify who. 

IN BRIEF Broncos' Henry avoids 
drug suspension 
DENVER -Broncos running back Travis Henry won his appeal of a one-year suspension over a failed drug test Tuesday. 
The NFL informed Henry in September he had failed a test for marijuana. He disputed the results and sued the NFL to avoid a suspen­sion. He contended the league violat­ed its substance abuse policy by not allowing an expert of Henry's choos­ing to be present for the testing. 
Henry's lawyer Harvey Steinberg told The Associated Press that he wasn't surprised by the decision. 
''I'm thrilled," Steinberg said. "I always thought we should prevail. I knew that if we got a fair shake, based on the evidence, we'd win. Travis knows and he's absolutely thrilled and relieved and very happy." 
The Broncos issued a statement that said they were "pleased with 
this outcome and happy that Travis has been absolved of any wrongdo­ing with respect to this matter." 
Guillen signs three_:year,
$36-million (leal with Royals 
NASHVILLE-Power-hitting .out­fielder Jose Guillen and the Kansas City Royals reached an agreement on a $36 million, three-year con­tract. 
The 31-year-outfielder batted .290 with 23 homers and 99 RBis for the Seattle Mariners this year. Seattle declined its $9 million option and Guillen turned down a $5 million player option, receiving a $500,000 buyout. 
The agreement was subject to him passing a physical, a person famil­iar with the negotiations said Tuesday, speaking on condition of anonymity because no announce­ment had been made. His deal was iirst reportnd by ESPNdeportes.com and foxsports.com. 
"We have the obvious need of adding right-handed power to our lineup," new Royals manager Trey Hillman said. 
Sports IDustrated names Favre 
sportsman of the year 
NEW YORK-Brett Favre's standout season for the resurgent Green Bay Packers has earned him the title of 2007 Sports Illustrated Sportsman of the Year, making him the fourth quarterback to win the award in its 53-year history. 
The 38-year-old Favre joins fellow quarterbacks Terry Bradshaw (1979), Joe Montana (1990) and Tom Brady (2005) as recipients of the award, given to an athlete who symbolizes the ideals of sportsman­ship. 
Favre, a three-time NFL MVP, said in the cover story of the magazine's Dec. 1Oth issue that leadership is about finding ways to raise his team's level of play.

Sixers hire Stefanski as GM 
Former Nets GM will also be team president after Philly fires King 
Associated Press 
PIIILADELPIIIA Ed Stefanski is trading a difficult commute for a much tougher road: trying to turn a fallen franchise into a winner. 
Stefanski was chosen presi­dent and general manager of 76ers on Tuesday, hours after Billy King was fired after 10 seasons in Philadelphia. Stefanski left his job as GM of the New Jersey Nets and made the daily commute from the Philadelphia suburb of Wayne to northern New Jersey. 
The move keeps Stefanski in the familiar Atlantic Division and returns the Philly-area native to his roots with the daunting task of making the dis­mal 76Hrs into winners. 
"I feHl more than ready to be the caretaker for the 76ers," Stefanski said. 
For the second straight year, the Sixers (5-12) are off to a miserable start. 
After playing in the NBA finals in 2001. Philadelphia has missed the postseason three of the last four years and was in the beginning stages of yet another rebuilding plan. 
King jump-started the youth movement a year ago when he traded former MVP Allen Iverson to Denver. He outlined to chairman Ed Snider a three­year plan to turn the 76ers into a playoff team and management seemed to back the former Duke standout. 
King, who was in the final year of his contract, instead got 17 games. 
"We came to the conclusion that we have a good plan in place, but that we needed a fresh approach in the leadership of the franchise," Snider said. 
That responsibility will fall on Stefanski, who grew up rooting for Wilt Chamberlain and the 76ers. His passion for basketball manifested itself when he played at the University of Pennsylvania under Chuck Daly and later coached his high school alma mater, Monsignor Bonner, to a Catholic League championship. 
He admits to still being a fan of local teams. "I die with e v e r y 

Associated Press 

NASHVILLE, Tenn. -The Detroit Tigers reached a pre­liminary agreement Tuesday to acquire Miguel Cabrera and Dontrelle Willis from the Florida Marlins for a package of six players, an unexpected blockbuster trade that devel­oped quickly at the winter meetings. 
In a huge deal that took the spotlight away from Boston's pursuit of Johan Santana, Florida gets lefty Andrew Miller, outfielder Cameron Maybin and four other prospects from the Tigers, a baseball official with knowl­edge of the talks said on con­dition of anonymity because the trade had not yet been finalized. 
Willis was on vacation when he heard the news. 
"I'm in Mexico right now with my family. I'm kind of busy," he told The Associated Press. 
The Marlins also receive catcher Mike Rabelo and right-banders Burke Badenhop, Eulogio De La Cruz and Dallas Trahern. The play­ers involved must pass physi­cals for the deal to be com­pleted. 
"It's very serious, but noth­ing is finalized yet because some issues need to get worked out," Tigers manager Jim Leyland told the AP. 
Florida didn't even approach the Tigers until Tuesday morning. The Marlins told the Tigers they could have the two stars for those six players, then Detroit called back about two hours later and agreed. 
"If it does happen, obviously they're getting two very good players," said Yankees man­ager Joe Girardi, who man­aged the Marlins in 2006. "Miguel Cabrera is one of the finest hitters in the game. He can do so many things with a bat, whether you want him to hit a home run for you, you want to hit and run, work the count, get on base. And Dontrelle Willis has been one of the premier lefties in the National League." 
Detroit had not been consid­ered a contender for Cabrera or Willis. 
"It was kind of like, wow, when I heard. I halfway expected one of them to get traded, but not both in the same deal. So it's a little bit of a shock," Marlins left fielder Josh Willingham said. 
"It's deflating because they're great teammates and good friends. It's going to be hard not seeing them around. I know we got some good players in the deal, but Miguel and Dontrelle are proven big league players, and it's going to be tough to fill those roles. Miguel brings you more than 100 RBis, 30 home runs and a .300 batting average, and while Dontrelle had a disap­pointing year last year, he's a workhorse. He's going to eat up 200 innings and he's always healthy. It will be tough to replace those guys." 
Boston, meanwhile, was focused on Santana, the Minnesota Twins' two-time Cy Young Award winner. Finding the price too high, the Yankees ended their efforts to acquire the 28-year-old left­bander. 
Yankees senior vice presi­dent Hank Steinbrenner had set a Monday deadline for an agreement with the Twins. 
"A deadline is a deadline. It was pretty much done as of this morning," he said. "He's a fine pitcher, but there's a lot of things that go into this. This isn't fantasy baseball." 
Boston had offered the Twins packages built either around pitcher Jon Lester or outfielder Jacoby Ellsbury, but not both. 
"I know there's a lot of spec­ulation that we're close to something big," Red Sox gen­eral manager Theo Epstein said. "Until we reach an agreement, then we're not that close." 
New York had proposed pitcher Phil Hughes and cen­ter fielder Melky Cabrera. The Twins dropped their demand that pitcher Ian Kennedy be included, but the sides could­n't agree on a third player. 
Philadelphia "We may have been Monday was its team," Stefanski delusional at the end seventh in 10 said. games.
of last season. " 
Imagine how "We may have the rest of the been delusional fans felt this Ed Snider at the end of the season. 76ers chairman last season, 
"It's a tough day for Billy," said Brown, now a consultant. 
King, who had been with the Sixers since 1997, declined com­ment when reached on his cell phone. 
Snider did say he hoped the Sixers would have built more off their 30-29 finish last season during which Andre Iguodala and Andre Miller emerge as part of a solid foundation. Instead, they have collapsed under third-year coach Maurice Cheeks and the team's 88-79 loss to Atlanta on 
King made his share of ques­tionable moves -overpaying players like Aaron McKie, Kenny Thomas and Sam Dalembert; showing impatience with the head coach; and failing to find a No. 2 to play with Iverson. Regardless, the timing of the move is curious. 
Snider had never publicly wavered in his support for King and let him shape the immedi­ate future of the franchise by making both the Iverson trade and the three first-round draft picks in June. 
Snider gave few solid reasons why King's time had run out. "We decided it wasn't work­ing, that's all," Snider said. 
Philadelphia has been mired in mediocrity or near the bottom of the East since a five-year playoff run under coach Larry Brown ended in 2003. 
Snider said. 
The Sixers hope 

the surprising move sends a signal to a dwin­dling fan base that the team is committed to winning. Few have turned out this season, as the team's average attendance of 11,960 ranks 29th out of 30 teams. 
"Hopefully they'll see we're making the right moves, they believe in what we're doing and they'll support us," Snider said. 
The team believes hiring Stefanski was the right move. He teamed with Nets president Rod Thorn to reshape Philly's division rival and is known as a sharp talent evaluator who helped bring the Nets Vince Carter and Richard Jefferson. 
"He's been a big part of our success here the last seven years," Thorn said. ''I'm sure he'll do a great job there."

After a 2-3 start to the sea­son, Saint Mary's will play its first MIAA game tonight at home against Calvin at 7:30. 
"We are excited to open up conference play and be play­ing at home tomorrow night," Belles coach Jenn Henley said. "We will have our hands full with Calvin. They are a good team. We play in a very competitive confenmce, so we have to be ready all the time." 
The Belles recently went 1­1 in the Trinity University Thanksgiving Classic, taking S\\COnd In the four-team tour­nament. They cruised past the College or Notre Dame of Maryland, I.J2-44, in the first round but lost in the champi­onship to nationally-ranked George Fox 69-58. Calvin lost its last two games in the MIANCCIW Classic at Hope College in Holland, Mich., this past weekend. 
"I think Calvin is off to a good start to the season," Henley said. "However, they arc coming off two losses against Wheaton and Carthage College. I am sure they will be ready for us on Wednesday." 
Calvin has played Saint Mary's tough in the past, but the Belles have shown them­selves a capable team so rar

to use his blazing speed. The problem is, that's the only pass route Tate could run properly all season. Weis has always said you have to design an offense for the personnel you have and not force them into a system. But Tate, who convert­ed to wideout after paying running back in high school, barely saw the field because his skill set didn't mesh with the offensive system. 
Hopefully, one of two things happens here. 1) After one season, Tate becomes more comfortable in Weis' offense and learns when to cut his routes shorter or make them longer. 2) Weis simplifies his offense to allow Tate to get the ball in the open field in ways other than a go-route. If Tate is on the field every play, he's going to draw attention that will open things up for other receivers. This doesn't apply just for Tate either. This goes

McGraw also said the margin of victory may be inflated because of the opponents Notre Dame has faced. She is more concerned with how many point<; her team allows, she said. 
''I'm perfectly content with giv­ing up a game in the 60s," McGraw said. "What I'm looking for is for us to hold them below their average." 
McGraw said she enjoys coach­ing this team beeause of their desire to learn and improve. 
"They're looking at eaeh game and saying, 'What do we have to do to get better? How can we keep getting better?'" she said. "We worked on our defense a lot yes­terday, and I think we've had a good feeling coming out that we're improving defensively." 
That defense has held oppo­nent<; to 53.7 points per game and forced 24.3 turnovers per game. The tight Irish press has also helped force 12.7 steals per game, which in turn helps fuel their tran­sition ollense.

Don't lose anyone in recruiting -Notre Dame has the No. 1 rated class in the country right now. The coach­ing staff did an excellent job hanging onto to its 21 verbal commitments in such a "Crum­my season. The worst thing that can happen to this pro­gram right now, outside of a campus-wide fire, is for recruits to start dropping like flies. 

+ 
No more back to basics. After Notre Dame's 38-0 drub­bing at the hands of Michigan, Weis went back to square one to try and improve his team. Why wait until the middle of the season this year? Re-teach the basics when the new recruiting class comes in over the summer, and teach the older guys again in the spring. Weis learned his lesson this year. He has to teach funda­mentals to his young squad 


before they start to learn a complicated offensive scheme. 
+ Lastly, and most impor­tantly, develop an edge. Head into this offseason mad. Put Mark May's picture on the wall of the weight room and curse him out as you fight through the pain of getting that one last rep. Do something, any­thing, to get fired up. Without a bowl to prepare for, you get an extra month of workouts. That must be fun. But with proper self-motivation, it does­n't have to be that bad. This way when you play San Diego State on Sept. 6, 2008, you're ready to run through a wall. 
So, that's it. Just a few things on the Christmas list this year. Notice it doesn't say a bowl win. Hopefully, that'll be on next year's list.

Weis: Clausen could be 'son1ething special' 
By JAY FITZPATRICK 
Associate Sports Editor 
After a year closely evaluat­ing freshman quarterback Jimmy Clausen, Notre Dame head coach Charlie Weis said he has seen early signs of "it" -the indefinable quality that makes quarterbacks great. 
"Let's not rush this, but I think that there's definitely evidence that this kid could be something special," Weis said in a news conference Monday. 
Clausen played in 10 games this season for the Irish, start­ing nine of them, and finished with 1,254 yards, seven touch­downs and six interceptions. But during Notre Dame's final three games against Air Force, Duke and Stanford -both wins -Clausen started to improve in play. In those games, the freshman had six touchdowns, one interception and a 55.8 percent completion percentage. These perform­ances came after Clausen rode the bench for -Notre Dame's two losses to USC on Oct. 20 and Navy on Nov. 3. 
Weis said Clausen's break in playing time midway through the season was just a part of the quarterback's learning process and the two halves were not two separate entities. 
"I look at it from when he got here last year right on through," Weis said. "You know, how it progressed. All I can tell you is he would like things to have turned out a lot better, so would have I. But I definitely like the direction where this is going." 
After Clausen showed con­siderable on-the-field improvement in the end of the season, Weis said the most important thing for his fresh­man quarterback this offsea­son will be to hit the weights and gain some strength. 
"I think that the kid has a very good mind. He has a very good arm. He has a pretty good understanding about the basis of our system that we're going to be able to expand going into the spring," Weis said. "But I think for him, more than mentally, I think that his biggest task is going to be to get himself fully healthy and physieally ready to go and add some muscle." 

Because Notre Dame failed to qualify for a bowl game, it cannot practice again until the spring season begins, but its strength and conditioning pro­gram starts this week. 
Weis said the only other aspect Clausen needs to work on is becoming a leader. 
"I think that any time you're a freshman, it's tough to be a leader or show leadership abilities when you're a fresh­man because it's tough for a fifth-year senior in a huddle to look at a freshman and say, okay, I'm going to listen to everything," he said. "It's a lit­tle tough just naturally doing it that way, although he got a lot of help from guys like [center John Sullivan] and [tight end John] Carlson to make sure that that's the way things went around here." 
But after this season, Weis feels that his quarterback has gone through the "rite of pas­sage" needed to become the head of the offense. 
One of the main things Weis was most impressed with this season was Clausen's "nasty" attitude -something the coach hoped to instill in the 
. Irish since he joined the pro­gram in the winter of 2005. Weis said this attitude helped Clausen adapt to being the starting quarterback as a freshman, despite that he did­n't' have the team experience Notre Dame's other quarter­backs had. Overall, Weis is confident in the quarterback situation going into the spring, a differ­ence from last spring and summer's four-way quarter­back free-for-all that saw three different quarterbacks take snaps in the first game of the fall season.

Instead, the hype centered on Beasley and Kansas State's other highly renowned fresh­men. 
Then the Irish proved that experience, teamwork and heart matter a lot more than hype and NBA prospects. This entire team, especially McAiarney, has been through adversity, and it showed. 
When it came to crunch time, Notre Dame's veterans stepped up and beat Kansas State's I'!ashy youth. The Irish were more composed, more elutch, and showed more hus­tle, and they won a game with the nation watching-a game that will be remem­bernd in March. 
After taking a big hit in the Virgin Islands, Notre Dame's season is baek on traek.

Tuesday's game Irish forward against Kansas Irish coach Luke 1-Iarangody 
State repre­sented Notre Dame's last chance to defeat a power-conference opponent before beginning Big East play on Jan. 3 against West Virginia. Irish coach Mike Brey said he was pleased with how his team responded to the pressure of the game. 
"I thought we were a lot more mentally tough than we were in the Virgin Islands," Brey told ESPN after the game. 
With the Irish ahead 59-57 and just over two minutes left to play, McAlarney drove along the baseline and hit a runner to put the Irish up by four. Kansas State freshman forward Michael Beasley hit a pair of free throws on th1~ Wildcats next possession to pull the Wildcats back within two. Beasley, who entered the con­test averaging 26.7 points and 15 rebounds per game, fin­ished with 19 points on 8-for­21 shooting and 14 rebounds, but only had four points in the second half.

The Irish employed a number of defend­ers, whether in zone or man, to contain Beasley. And even though the Irish often played zone -a defense susceptible to allowing offensive rebounds -they were able to win the battle on the boards 41-36. 
"That was our biggest point of emphasis eoming into the game," llillesland said by phone. " ...

By BILL BRINK 
Sports Writer 

Notre Dame will face its tough­est opposing defense since it played No. 3 Maryland when it travels to Bowling Green tonight to face the Falcons at 7 at Anderson Arena. 
La..<>t season, it took an overtime period for Notre Dame to beat Bowling Green, 85-81. Notre Dame is 3-0 in the all-time series. The Irish, ranked No. 16 in this week's Associated Press poll, will travel for the first time since Nov. 20, when they lost 75-59 at then­No. 3 Maryland. The Pakons hold opponents to 56.5 points per game, despite losing six seniors from a 2006-07 team team that reached the Sweet 16. 
"They're an experienced team in some ways bneause their point guard !Kate Achterl bas sweet six­teen experience," Irish coach Mul'fet McGraw said. "She was great last year, and she's running the team really well this year. She's their leading scorer, she's playing really well." 
The Falcons defeated Cornell in the championship game of the Cornell Classie on Saturday. They have won their games this sea..<>on by an average of 14.2 points. Achter leads the team in scoring with 17.2 point<> pE~r game. Laun~n Prochaska is second with 14.3 poinl<> and three steals per game and averaged 15.5 point<> in two games during the Cornell Cla..<;sic. 
McGraw isn't worried about her team's ball control, hownvnr, say­ing she had faith in the team's point guards, Tulyah Gaines and Melissa Leehlitner. 
"1 think Tulyah is Pxperiencnd, and she's playing mally well, shn's got a pretty good assist to turnover ratio," McGraw said. "I think shn'll handle herself well, as will Leeh. I'm eonfident in our point guards." 
But McGraw said Bowling Crnnn has the toughest defense the Irish will face since Maryland and that they nm~d to takfl earn or the ball. The Bowling Green defense has held opponents without a field goal for five-minute stretches in each of its first six games. 
After it<> loss to Maryland in thE~ semifinals of the pmsnason WNn: Notre Dame blow out it<> next fiJUr opponent<>. Even though the team has five wins by 30 points or more, McGraw said the Irish never look pa..<>t opponent<>. 
'They don't look at last year." McGraw said. "They don't say well, last year was an easy game, this year will be a tough game or vice versa."

McAlarney steps up to give squad big win 
After being suspended for most of last season, after struggling in Notre Dame's two losses in the Virgin Islands and after 3R 
minutes of frustrating basketball, McAlarney put the Irish on his shoulders and got them a 


huge win Chris Khorey over Kansas Sports Editor 
State. 

With a little over two minutes remaining Tuesday night, Notre Dame was hanging on to a tenuous lead. The Irish were up 59­57, but they hadn't scored in nearly five minutes. The situ­ation was all too reminiscent of the end of the Baylor and Georgia Tech games, where the Irish struggled to score down the stretch and blew big leads. 
But McAlarney made sure that wouldn't happen again. 
He took the ball on the wing, drove baseline, and threw in a runner to put the
