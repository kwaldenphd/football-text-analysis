The University was unsure ifthe struggling economy would cause a decline in the number of appli­cants for the Oass of 2013, but the Office of Undergraduate Admissions was pleased to receive the second-highest number of applications in history, said Dan Saracino, assistant provost for Undergraduate Admissions. 

Students packJACC to cheer on Irish tnen 
By LIZ O'DONNELL News Writer 
With football season novy over and the winter sports season in full force, even more students have shifted their support of Irish athletics from the field to the court. 
Led by last year's Big East Player of the Year, Luke Harangody, the Fighting Irish men's basketball team has start­ed the 2008-2009 season with an impressive 12-4 record.

However, while the University received about 14,000 applications after the regular action deadline passed about two weeks ago, exceeding last year's number, the economy could be a factor in the decrease in applications from two years ago, Saracino said. 
"Very few schools are reporting record numbers," he said. 
Saracino said he attributes part of the increase in applications from last year to the decision to use the Common Application, which allows students to fill out a general application that will go to several colleges and universities. 
The Admissions Office will be reviewing the regular action appli­cations through March, but they have admitted 1, 7 33 students early action, 200 more students than were admitted under early action last year, Saracino said.

INSIDE COLUMN 

Secret life of anNDteen 
Look for me Mondays at 8 p.m. and you'll find me plopped on my futon par­taking in my embarrassing, but com­pletely necessary guilty pleasure: watch­ing "The Secret Life of the American 
Teenager." 
Here's a recap for those of you who aren't as unhealth­ily obsessed as I am (That number is probably smaller than you think). 
The show revolves 

around Amy, a painfully na"ive high school freshman who gets knocked up one time at band camp. Ben, an equally na"ive and doubly annoying freshmen, is Amy's boyfriend turned husband, but not the father of Amy's baby. Ricky, the school player, is the father of Amy's baby. He is currently sleeping with the school slut, Adrian while dating Grace, the ultra-Christian, sworn virgin-until­marriage cheerleader. Oh, the drama. 
"The Secret Life" is complete with hor­rendous acting and hard to believe story lines. It is ABC Family's car accident that I just can't peel my eyes away from. With the start of the second season (How did it make it to season two?), I have made a list of the top five most ridicu­lous moments: 
5. When Grace's mentally handicapped brother calls a prostitute (Stifler's mom) and he pays her $200 to be his date for the night. Nothing happens, don't worry... This is only somewhat ridicu­lous because one of the only scenes with decent acting. "" 
4. When Ben confesses his love for Amy after about two weeks of dating... Oh, and he also pictures her in the hall­ways at school after she drops out hop­ing it will make her come back... How she doesn't find this freaking creepy is beyond me. 
3. When Ben and his best friend, Henry are on the phone with Henry's girlfriend trying to guess who she fanta­sizes about when she flies solo. (They think it's Shia Labeouf. Turns out, it's really Henry.) Meanwhile, she's in the car with her mom while she is having this conversation... This was at least amusing, but still a ridiculous conversa­tion to be having with your best friend, your girlfriend and her mom. 
2. When every single one of the high school characters goes to get fake IDs, which are being produced out of an empty classroom in the high school by a 16-year-old boy with a lisp. Each kid gets his br her picture taken through a hole in a large cardboard cutout of the same Nevada driver's license. It actually passes as an ID so that Amy and Ben can legally get married... Sorry, just doesn't happen, or all of us underclassmen would be buying our own beer for this weekend. 
1. When Grace and Ricky are baking cookies together and Ricky seductively licks the dough off of Grace's finger. She then nervously asks (on ABC Family mind you), "Does this count as oral sex?"... Seriously? 
Sadly, she was, and so is this show. But if you can look past the absolute absurd­ity of it, I'll bet that you'll soon be join­ing me in my pathetic addiction.

Ru:m_ Runner's changes na:m_e 
Popular bar leaves the franchise, becomes J& SPot-of-Gold Bar and Grill 
By LIZ HARTER Saint Mary's Editor 
Students who tried to head out for 75-cent well drinks at Rum Runner's last night may have been surprised to find a plastic sign reading J & S Pot-of-Gold Bar and Grill covering the usual tropical­themed sign. 
The Bar and Grill, owned by Shirley and John Witmer of Niles, Mich., which became a Rum Runner's franchise in 2002, is no longer associated with the Raleigh, 
N.C. based company. 
Shortly after the new year, the Witmer's dropped the brand name, in favor of their legal business name, according to a recent article in the South Bend Tribune. 
J & S Pot-of-Gold Bar and Grill manager Casey Constant was quot-
Write n. 

ed by the Tribune saying the Rum Runner's franchic;e "required three to fotrr nights a week of [the duel­ing pianos] to maintain the fran­chise name. 
However, at the 236 S. Michigan St. location, the dueling pianos show only took place on weekends while there was occasionally other local entertainment scheduled for Wednesday and Thursday nights. 
"In a major metropolitan area you could do that every night. But we see a lot of regulars who go out the same night every week so you need to change it up," he told the Tribune. 
The restaurant is still going to host a live piano bar show on Saturday and Sunday, with the entertainment starting at 8 p.m. and the doors opening at 5 p.m., according to the voice mail mes­sage received when calling the location. 
It will also continue to offer 75­cent well drinks on Wednesday nights and Thursday will be $2.50 You-Call-It with no cover charge. There will also be karaoke on both nights. ' 
The location's hours will remain the same: opening at 5 p.m. on Wednesday, Thtrrsday and Friday and 6 p.m. on Saturday with a clos­ing time of 2 a.m. The restaurant is closed Sunday, Monday and Tuesday night. 
A new Web site is under con­struction according the voice mes­sage, but anyone interested in the entertainment schedule can call the location at (574) 288-5977. 
Ifyou're a diehard Rum Runner's patron and want to genuine fran­chise entertainment, the nearest location is in Fort Wayne, Ind.

Prof. backs Bush on Iran-Israel 
Special to The Observer 
The reported derision of President Bush to deny Israel's request for assistance in bomb­ing Iranian nuclear facilities was helpful not only to the stability of the Middle Eastern region, but also to the maintenance of inter­national law, according to Mary Ellen O'Connell, Robert and Marion Short Professor of Law in the Notre Dame Law School. 
The New York Times reported on Jan. 10 that President Bush had denied a secret request by Israel last year for specialized bombs to be used for an attack on Iran's main nuclear complex. 
"The reports say the president acted out of concern that bomb­ing would further destabilize the Middle East," O'Connell said. "It is important to note that such bombing would also violate international law. The U.S. issue with Iran is over violating the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. 
"We have been telling Iran it has serious obligations undnr international law. But there is no obligation more serious than the prohibition on the use of force. Supporting that obliga­tion is the surest way to a more stable Middle East. The presi­dent acted wisely," she conclud­ed. 
O'Connell. author of "The Power and Purpose of International Law," has written and leetured on international legal regulation of the use of force and con11ict and disput(~ resolution, _especially peaceful resolution of disputes prior to an escalation to armed conf1ict. Partieularlv interested in the possibility of a classical revival in international law, she has been active in the American Society of International Law, the International Institute for Humanitarian Law, the International Law Association. and the Council on Foreign Relations.

found that there were 200 more students that we wanted to admit," he said. "We are pleased with the early action applicanl<>." 
The average ACT score was 33 and the average SAT score. com­posed of the combined critical reading and math scores, was 1451, Saracino said. These aver­ages are basically the same as the averages for early action last year. 
The st-udents accepted under early action also represent a wide range of ethnic, geographic and socioeconomic backgrounds, he said. 
Saracino estimated that the average SAT score for the accept­ed regular action students will be about 20 points lower. 
"With early action we ·are more selective, more cautious," he said. "Unless a student is clearly admis­sible, we don't admit them, we defer them, meaning we will look at them again with the regular action pool." 
However, Saracino said these averages give only a small glimpse to the profiles of accepted stu­dents. The most important factor in admission to the University, more important than test scores, is academic rigor, he said. 
"We look to see if the student has sought out the most demand­ing course load that their high school offers," he said. "The aver­age number of AP courses taken by admitted students is five." 
Saracino said the uncertain economy could also adversely affect the number of accepted stu­dents who elect to attend Notre Dame. 
"We are wondering how the economy is going to impact the yield, or the percentage of admit­ted students who say yes to you," he said. "Our yield has always been one of the highest in the country." 
The desirable size lor the incom­ing freshman class is 1,985 stu­dents, and the Admissions Ofllce will not accept more studenl<> than in past years in anticipation of a lower yield rate, Saracino said. 
"We don't want to admit too many students and then lind out May 1 that we have too many stu­dents confirmed," he said. 
The safer course is to put more students on the waiting list and then admit them later if the yield is low, Saracino said. 
Despite the economy though, the Office of Financial Aid still guaran­tees that they will meet the demonstrated need of every stu­dent, so the Admissions Ollice can assure admitted students that their need will be met, which will hopefully keep the yield rate up, Saracino said. 
Saracino said many colleges and universities throughout the coun­try are accepting more students as a way to increase the college's rev­enue, but Notre Dame has no plans to increase the student body, despite the construction of new dormitories on campus. 
"My understanding is that the additional housing spaces will be used to create more comfortable situations in other residence halls," he said.

Irish 
continued from page 1 

For the rest of the regular sea­son, the Irish are set to face a challenging schedule of oppo­nents including many from the Big East, one of the nation's pre­miere college basketball confer­ences. 
With the team's ranking stay­ing consistently in the top 15, the campus atmosphere is hyped with excitement from the team's success. 
"Our team is amazing," fresh­man Nathan Feldpausch said. "All students should attend the games because it is especially enjoyable to watch a good team play." . 
The student section has been packed during each home game, with the eager fans cramming in to the Joyce Center from court­side to the upper bleachers. 
"It's really exciting to go to the games," Winny 1-Iu said. "The team is doing so well." 
Along with the normal cheers that students chant during foot­ball games, an array of other cheer tactics are also involved at basketball gam~s. 
"You get a cheer sheet that has information on players on the other team," Feldpausch said. "It's usually pretty funny." 
Along with the success of this year's team, the Irish currently hold the longest home winning streak in men's college basket­ball (44 games), a fact that con­tributes to high attendance at the games. 
"It feels like more and more students and fans show up each game, maybe to be a part of his­tory," freshman Garrett Campbell said. 
Currently there are three Big East teams in the top 10 of' the AP Top 25 poll. While the Irish will face two or these three teams on the road, including first-ranked Pittsburgh, the Irish have quality opponents who will make the trek to the Joyce Center 
These teams include fifth­ranked Connecticut, who comes to town on the Jan. 24. 
ESPN will broadcast the UConn game on College Gameday f'rom the Joyce Center beginning at 11 a.m. 
With seven remaining home games, it appears that the atten­dance at the games will only increase. 
'The fans are intense and filled with energy," said Campbell, "The student body is there f'or the team and everyone's pre­pared to let them know it."

"It's the most p,ffeetive workout that I've evp,r dmw," Gallagher said aftnr tlw hour­long class had finished. She taught the cycling elass last semester for the first time, but has taught other fitness classes at Notrn Damn for the past eight years. 
The class, one of over 50 fitness classes ofl'ered by RecSports, took the group of 20, mostly women, up three "mountains" in a former rac­quetball court that has been renovated with fans, a sound systp,m and pietun~s of bikers and naturP. scenes on the walls. 
RecSports has invitml Notre Dame students to sample all the courses it offers for frep, through Sunday. St!Jdents can sign up to take a elass for the semester starting today at 7:30a.m. 
Jennie Phillips, the assis­tant director for Fitness and Fitness Facilities in the Office of Recreational Sports, said the University has offered students fitness classes since the mid-1980s. 
Between May 2007 and April 2008, about 3,000 peo­ple participated in fitness classes, she said. 
People come to the elasses for the quality facilities, the enthusiastic instructors and a positive environment. 
"People will come if they are seeing that the classes are effective and they are having fun," Phillips said. 
The weeklong free trial period gives people a chance to experiment with classes like "Zumba," "Triple Threat," "Yoga" and "Cardio Funk," Phillips said. 
This semester RecSports added an "Aqua Drills" class, which consists of exercises in the deep end of the pool at Hockne Memorial. 
The popularity of fitnP.ss classes tends to increase in the spring, Phillips said. 
"Usually second semester we see a great number of participants because people have New Year's resolutions, they are getting ready for spring break and you can't really go outside. The big interhall sports like football are over," she said. 
The most popular classes last year were toning classes, like "Body Sculpt" or "Flex N Tone." Yoga was also a popu­lar class, Phillips said. 
Classes like "Cycle N Sculpt" help students manage stress and keep up their over­all health, including manag­ing weight, Gallagher said. Most students at Notre Dame spend long hours sitting and studying, she said, and taking time off to work out helps the brain function bettor. 
The regular fitness sched­ule begins Monday and most classes will end April 29. For the past five years, RecSports has offered a variety of free fitness classes during study days and final exam week at the end of the semester, Phillips said. 
Online registration begins today at 7:30 a.m. through recsports.nd.edu. Visa and Mastercard are accepted; and cash and checks are accepted at the Rolfs Sports Recreational Center front desk.

Vatican secret confessional opens up 
ROME -One of the Vatican's most secrecy shrouded tribunals, which handles confes­sions of sins so grave only the pope can grant absolution, is giving the faithful a peek into its workings for the first time in its 830-year history. 
The Vatican has long lamented that fewer and fewer Catholics are going to confession, the sacrament in which the faithful can receive forgiveness if they sincerely confess their sins to a priest. 
To combat the decline, the so-called "tri­bunal of conscience" invited the public into the frescoed halls of its imposing 16th-centu­ry palazzo for a two-day conference that ended Wednesday. 
Venezuela severs ties with Isreal 
CARACAS, Venezuela -Venezuela broke off diplomatic relations with Israel on Wednesday to protest its military offensive in Gaza, the foreign ministry announced. 
The decision by President Hugo Chavez's socialist government comes about a week after it expelled the Israeli ambassador in Caracas and seven embassy staff members to protest the Jewish state's actions in Gaza. 
Venezuela "has decided to break off diplomatic relations with the state of Israel given the inhumane persecution of the Palestinian people," the foreign ministry said in a statement Wednesday. 
Israel launched the offensive on Dec. 27, seeking to force the ruling Hamas militant group to stop rocket attacks into southern Israel. Palestinian authorities say strikes have killed more than 1,000 of their peo­ple. Thirteen Israelis have been killed, four by rocket fire from Gaza.

WASHINGTON -Barack Obama's eco­nomic recovery bill has grown to $850 bil­lion after negotiations with his Democratic allies in Congress, who have rewritten some of the president-elect's tax proposals and may drive the price tag even higher. 
For starters, Capitol Hill Democrats are trying to use the economic recovery bill to extend a tax cut for middle-to upper­income taxpayers despite concerns from Obama's transition team that it won't boost the economy. 
Apple CEO takes medical leave 
SEATTLE -Apple Inc. co-founder and Chief Executive Steve Jobs said Wednesday he is taking a medical leave until June, even though just a week ago the cancer survivor tried to assure investors and employees his recent weight loss was caused by an easily treatable hormone defi­ciency. 
Apple's stock dropped 7 percent. 
Jobs, 53, said in a letter last week that he would remain at Apple's helm despite the hormone problem, and that he had already begun a "relatively simple and straightfor­ward" treatment. But in an e-mail to employees Wednesday, Jobs backtracked. 
"During the past week I have learned that my health-related issues are more complex than I originally thought," he wrote.

Ceasefire negotiations intensify 
Deathtoll exceeds 1,000 as Egypt, Hamas work towards a 10-day ceaseftre deal 
Associated Press 
CAIRO -Egypt and l-lamas are close to a deal for a 10­day cease-fire between Israel and the Palestinian militant group in Gaza, where the death toll from the Israeli offensive exceeded 1,000, officials said Wednesday. 
Egyptian and llamas offi­cials expressed optimism that an agreement for a tem­porary halt in fighting could be sealed soon and present­ed to Israel. But even if all sides sign on, further talks will be needed to resolve contentious disputes over policing Gaza's borders and ensure a longer-term truce. 
"We're working with l-lamas and we're working with the Israeli side. We hope to reach an outcome soon," Egyptian Foreign Ministry spokesman Hossam Zaki told the British Broadcasting Corp. 
Nine Israeli human rights groups accused the army of endangering Gazan civilians and called for a war crimes investigation. The groups wrote to Israeli leaders that the Gaza campaign has left civilians with nowhere to flee.

continued from page 1 
Another film clip, "Bridge to Freedom," described the voting rights and segregation in Selma, Ala. in the 1960s. African Americans did not have the right to vote in 1965 in Selma, and faced discrimination. 
After the clips, the panelists responded to a series of questions, describing how they became involved in nonviolent protests and community organizations. 

"As a child, you've got to do what your parents do," Bland said. "[MyJ grandmother joined an organiza­tion called the Dallas County Voters League." 
Crisostomo followed in the foot­steps of her parents. Her mother was a community activi'lt. 
"She started taking me with her to her club meetings and her P.T.A. meetings, and then she started introducing me to people who were also active. Pretty soon I was part of a youth group, and in the begin­ning we just wanted to do some­thing to better our community," she explained. 
Coleman grew up in South Bend. Unlike Crisostomo and Bland, his parents were never involved in activism, but he felt drawn to the career path. 
"Oftentimes, you don't get a chance to choose your career. Your career chooses you," he said. 
Muhammad also grew up in South Bend, but saw the violence against the Civil Rights movement on television growing up. 
"My father, he brought us to South Bend because he didn't want 

us to grow up under the Jim Crow 
Laws," she said. "I remember dur­
ing the '60s when they were 
marching with Dr. Martin Luther 
King [ ... ] when they were putting 
the water hoses on people. I got so 
angry [. ..] I wanted to knoek the 
television set on to the floor" 
Her father taught Muhammad that violence was not the answer. 
"My father began to tell me, 'You can't beat them like that. You've go to turn the other cheek.' I learned the non-violent social change." 
Bland told the audience the 
activists were fighting for a difler­
ent kind of freedom. 
"Abraham Uneoln had signed a paper that said we were free, and we were not on the plantation any­more. There were other things that we still didn't have, that that paper that he signed didn't bring. I had that understanding as early as I can remember," she said. 
Panelists ehallenged student<; to graduate and promote nonviolent protests. Crisostomo also encour­aged students to talk to everyone around them, 
"We were talking to everyone. We were taking our demands and on a road show. We were every­where talking to people." 
The panelists agreed that their actions have had an impact on the world today. 
"Obama," Bland said. "lie and Hilary [Clinton] are poster ehildren for the history that I live. I'm very, ·very proud that one of them was elected. I'm even more proud that it was him."

Discount booklets for busi­nesses in the South Bend area, one of the pair's cam­paign platforms, have been ordered and should arrive this week, Schmidt said.

An issue

have expressed eoncern...over, Heish said, is that of off-campus safety. A student government ad-hoc committee will address the topic in the eoming semester, with hopes to clarify the legalities pertaining to off­campus living. 
"A lot of students are often misinformed about the legal­ities about off-campus par­ties and off-campus living," Heish said. 
Schmidt told The Observer their main goal is raising awareness about the laws of the state of Indiana and the City of South Bend, as well as University regulations outlined in "duLac: A Guide to Student Life." 
Plans for the realization of one of Heish's projects -a colloquium with other col­lege and university student governments -are in the works for a late March or early April event. 
He said many other student governments have expressed interest in coming to Notre Dame to "forge a relation­ship" but Heish said he is still working with the specifies of the conference. 
Some Heish-Schmidt eam­paign promises, like a com­plete online syllabus data­base, were too ambitious to complete in only one term. 
"We hope to leave April 1 with a firm outline of the online syllabus database. We realized it would take much longer time than just one year to develop a sustain­able, online database," Heish said. 
Another initiative that will be left to their successors is plans for an International Showcase, that will most likely be put together next fall. The Showcase would offer student clubs the opportunity to perform together in one venue. 
Schmidt told The Observer a number of groups have already committed to partici­pating in the event.

IN BRIEF 
Dismal holiday sales continue into '09 
WASHINGTON -After the worst holiday season in 40 years, retailers face more sales declines in the months ahead as the recession deepens, job losses mount and consumers retrench further. 
Re·tail sales plunged 2. 7 percent in December, a record sixth straight monthly fall, and the first annual drop on govern­ment records dating to 1992, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. Last month's weakness -more than dou­ble what economists had expected -has extended into the new year with bank­ruptcy filings, store closings and more lay­offs. 
"Consumers are in deep hibernation, and there is no sign that they will wake up this spring or that the retail outlook will pick up anytime soon," said C. Britt Beemer, chairman of America's Research Group, a consumer research firm in Charleston, S.C. 
Oil prices rise to $39 a barrel in Asia 
SINGAPORE -Oil prices rose to near $39 a barrel Wednesday in Asia after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said a stimu­lus package could help revitalize the ailing 
U.S. economy. 
Light, sweet crude for February delivery was up 94 cents to $38.72 a barrel by midday in Singapore in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract rose overnight 19 cents to settle at $37.78. 
Bernanke said Tuesday that a $700 billion financial rescue program being discussed by Congress was needed to combat the worst financial crisis to hit the U.S. and the global economy since the 1930s. The stimulus pack­age "could provide a significant boost to eco­nomic activity," he said. 
Traders said low volumes in early Asian trading also helped spur volatility. 
"You're seeing a reaction to Bernanke's COJTiments and an illiquid market retrace toward $40," said Jonathan Kornafel, Asia director for market maker Hudson Capital Energy in Singapore. "We've also come off about $12 without a bounce, so it's a combina­tion of those three factors."

Rarely did the top two ranked teams Play each other on  Capitol
Comments

New Year's Day. The system was replete with regional prejudices, closed-minded traditions and excuses. 
Most egregiously though, deserving·· teams were willfully slighted. Such were the 1968, 1969 and 1973 unde­feated Penn State teams. Only after years and enough sports writers lav­ishing imperviousness onto Penn State, did undefeated Joe P.aterno teams finally translate into championships. Ironically, in December 1973, the top six ranked teams were unbeaten although half of them had a tie on their records. Sports writers then, like their counterparts today, incessantly explained away their prejudices with the subjective excuse -lower ranked teams like undefeated Penn State played a weaker schedule. 
Notre Dame has fallen on both sides of those media excuses. In strict adherence to tradition in 1966, the Irish won the championship over an equally talented Michigan State whom they played to a tie in head-to-head competition. More than two decades later, Notre Dame suffered twice on the inconsistent application of the same standard. In 1989, voters used the head-to-head loss to Miami to logi­cally name the Hurricanes national champions. Yet, under the Bowl Competition system in 1993, both major polls listed a one-loss Notre Dame team behind a team they had 
beaten, a one-loss Florida Statn team. .Vot9rs wanted to give Coach Bobby 
Bowden his first national champi­onship using ridiculous excuses like "FSU only lost by a touchdown and on 
Notre Damn's lield." 
Eventually that outdated and closed thinking gavn way to more equitable efforts within the current Bowl Championship Series. A new selection process could only be better il' fnwer voters and more computations selected the king of football. It kept thn bowl system in tact, but still does not always determine the champion through play on the field. Now is the timn for the BCS to morph into the BCP -Bowl Championship Playoff. 
Some propose continuing the bowl series but adding a "plus ono" final game..Others suggest a straight playoff system like with the 24-team Division II system. won this year by the Minnesota Duluth Bulldogs. Thn plus one approach alone is a laeking solu­tion while the Division II schedule is overbearing. The solution is a playoff hybrid that. elevates three bowls on a rotating basis and pits the top four teams against each other with the plus one championship game played a week after New Year's Day. 
This year, imagine the Rose and Sugar Bowls host a semifinal round that produces two teams vying for the championship a week later in the Orange Bowl. Bowl participation would be upgraded and expanded. Four teams would now play head-to-head to determine a·champion. This season, half of the top eight ranked teams with one or less losses could partieipate. The goal to employ is to expand partic­ipation before championship play in the least disruptive manner. The BCP accomplishes that objective. 
The new BCP could also correct cur­rent deficieneies. First, undefeated teams like Boise State or Utah with a so-called "lesser" schedules might play the fourth ranked team in December to determine the fourth place seed in the playoff. No undefeated team should suffer the indignity of being perceived as less than worthy, especially when they win every game of their season. 
Secondly, the BCP should require that a conference present only one eli­gible team for the top four rankings at season's end. That way, four separate conferences and/or independent teams could participate in the two-week play­ofT. Who can contradict the assertion that given this year's bowl results, the PAC 10 may have had the strongest conference and best team with USC by New Year's Day? Imagine the excite­ment and caliber of a Florida-USC spectacle. 
Nothing in this new BCP proposal lessens the existing system except that two fewer teams would play in a bowl since the final two slots would be determined in other bowls a week before the championship game. It is more likely that a team such as Notre Dame with a 6-6 record this year would not be invited to a bowl unless another bowl was established. That is hardly a consideration when determin­ing who plays in a championship play­off. 
Now, the university presidents and bowl sponsors need to weigh the bene­fits of a BCP. Sending the top four teams into a playoff is fair and lucra­tive with more bowls participating in the championship, more teams vying to play for the championship and a more definitive way of crowning the champi­on. The BCP is so simple, even an aca­demic can understand its benefits.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Diversity needed in m.etal 
Dear Mr. Miller, 
Your article in Wednesday's Observer ("A simple plea," Jan. 14) piqued my interest. You see, like your friend Paul, I, too, am an avid listener of heavy metal. And while I agree that there is a cancer growing on the music industry, your characterization of it is wholly inaccurate. 
You claim that the music industry has manufactured genres in order to sell terri­ble music to easily malleable music fans. While this may be true, one of the primary laws of economics is that of supply and demand. Listeners would not be buying this "garbage," as you so subtly referred to it, if there were not a demand for it. Hawthorne Heights would not write songs like Ohio Is For Lovers (arguably the worst musical abortion ever foisted upon innocent radio listeners) were it not for the fact that there are thousands of black-wearing, MySpace­utilizing, poetry-reading Tim Burton-imitat­ing emo fans. 
My second point is this: you say that "genre-fication" is artificial. It may be in some mainstream music, but certainly not in metal. The reason there are so many metal genres is because of the style's rich history and divergent musical paths. A well­versed jazz listener can tell you the differ­ence between early, middle and late-period John Coltrane records, and can discuss the particulars of the subtle musical arrange­ments on Miles Davis' "Kind of Blue." 
Likewise, an educated metalhead can dis­course at length on the variations in style between Cannibal Corpse's early "Tomb of the Mutilated" and the more recent (and succinctly titled) "Kill." The worst examples of industry-based "genre-fication" in metal are insignificant compared to the revolting qualities of American Idol and any given song on pop radio stations. 
At the very worst, you'll hear people at concerts discussing whether a band is deathcore or death metal, or perhaps you'll find a sticker on a CD that deman·ds you purchase it if you like "Slayer, Lamb of God and Mastodon!" Compare this to the last 20 years of pop radio, which have largely been based upon bands saying, "Hey, remember that Nirvana song with the four chords? Let's do that for 12 tracks!" 
In conclusion, dear sir, if you want an example of "genre-fication," avert your eyes from metal and stare into the deep, dark recesses of the pop and rap music industries. Oh, and as for metal being the "most annoying form of music out there," I submit to you every Akon song ever written, which you can frequently hear being blared at 4 a.m. out of the dorm room next to mine. 
Now I'll go back to listening to The Dillinger Escape Plan (mathcore -yes, it's a genre), Opeth (progressive death metal) and Decapitated (technical death metal).

ND a good em.ployer? 
In Dec., Notre Dame received the 2008 Business of the Year Award from the Michiana Chapter of the Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM). Those in the adminis­trative offices, the Office of Human Resources, Bob McQuade and members of the Notre Dame family around the world had reason to celebrate. 
Celebration ... we celebrate the victory for our University as a good business, and "among other things, its staff development and education programs, health care bene­fits." For this, Notre Dame has reason to be proud and to celebrate. 
However, for just one moment, we must remember, according to Pope Pius XI, "in the first place, the worker must be paid a wage sufficient to support him [her] and his [her] family." Beyond health care, beyond staff development, Pius XI tells us, first, the worker must be able to support himself/herself and his/her family. Hence, when workers work mopping floors in office buildings downtown by day and at some building on our campus by night just to eat, they are not earning enough from their work at our University alone to support a family. When mothers barely spend a waking moment with their children because they work the night shift in our academiC buildings and spend the day standing in lines with food stamps and sleeping when they can, we are not paying attention to the worker as a person. 
Pope John Paul II demands (making this not an optional choice), "We must pay more atten­tion to the one who works that to what the worker does. The self-realization of the human person is the measure of what is right and wrong." The question remains then ­does health care (while necessary and impor­tant) make up for the lack of a wage sufficient for living a dignified life -does staff develop­ment fill in the gaps where food stamps and poor living conditions cannot quite reach? 
Hence, Congratulations Notre Dame, for being the Business of the Year of 2008, we are quite proud of you. It is our prayer and hope to the God of the powerful and of those who have not yet realized the power within them­selves that in the coming year you might see what those workers you employ actually live through and experience on a daily basis out­side of your grand buildings, floors perfectly carpeted and walls freshly painted before accepting such an honor. 
We are ND, and are called to a higher stan­dard than this.We may not settle for less than our best when the quality and dignity of human lives are at stake.

File sharing helps more than it hurts 
·The thousands of students who illegally download music ofT the Internet should be feeling a little more secure. That's because last month, the Recording Industries Association of America-a trade group repre­senting the major recording labels in the music industry -announced an 
. end to its relentless campaign of filing expensive lawsuits against college students who engage in online me-sharing. Since 2003, the RlAA has specifically targeted college students because we b are unlikely to fight the charges in court·and will Ro ert 5oave instead settle out of court for $3,000 per case. 
After dozens of lawsuits brought the RlAA bad University of press, including cases where the organization was Michigan found to be suing minors, the deceased, and even Michigan people without computers, the RlAA has finally Dailychanged its tune and is now asking individual Internet service providers to do the policing them­selves. But just because the RlAA is done ripping off college students doesn't mean we should forget that me-sharing is still illegal. It's still pos­sible to get in trouble with Internet service providers because they have the power to slow or stop Internet access for those who are downloading. 
And that's a problem because file-sharing shouldn't be illegal, anyway. 
It's an easy philosophical argument. Stealing music over the Internet just isn:t really stealing. Music is only information, and information can't be stolen in such a way that the original information is no longer avail­able. If you take the disc-the physical disc that the information is on­then you've stolen because the owner no longer has access to that specif­ic disk. 
But just downloading a song online isn't technically stealing because you haven't prevented anyone else from accessing that information. What you did was essentially produce a copy -a copy that is the same as the original in every single way, but is still available to everyone else. 
In response to this line of thinking comes a deluge of criticism that all boil down to this fear: the artists aren't getting credit for their music and they won't be able to make a living anymore, resulting in the demise of the industry. But this fear is unfounded. Despite what the RlAA claims, record sales are not diminishing substantially because of illegal down­loads. The RlAA contends that every illegally downloaded song is lost rev­enue, but just because you downloaded a song doesn't mean you would have purchased it. A 2004 study conducted by economists entitled "The Effect of File Sharing on Record Sales" concluded that "downloads have an effect on sales which is statistically indistinguishable from zero." 
It may even be true that me-sharing is good for the music industry. The online community is a great place for new artists to gain exposure. You may not be willing to buy a CD by a band you've never heard of, but you'd be more likely to download it and listen to it-and then maybe you'll recommend this band to a friend who will buy the CD or go to the band's concert. You might even buy aT-shirt. 
Aside from the possible benefits offile-sharing, another good indication that downloading shouldn't be illegal is that so many people are doing it and very few people think it's wrong. The vast majority of American soci­ety does not break laws, and ifmany people are breaking them it proba­bly means the laws are flawed, not the people. A study conducted by the Solutions Research Group in 2006 found that only 38 percent considered downloading a copyrighted song to be a "very serious offense." Are the people who responded to the survey just immoral thieves? Not really. In the same study, 78 percent of people surveyed said that taking a CD from a store without paying was a very serious offense. Fifty-nine percent con­sidered parking in a fire lane to be very serious. So it's not that people are lawbreakers, it's just that laws against me-sharing are mostly pointless. 
With the RlAA backing off college students, it may be tempting to forget about the legal status of file-sharing. Though fewer lawsuits is a welcome change, there's no reason that anyone should be punished for download­ing, even with a punishment as trivial as a slowed Internet connection. 
Punishing illegal downloading just isn't necessary at all, because· far from stealing, file-sharers are actually giving musicians some positive press -and that's more than can b~ said for the RlAA.

It is an honorable thing to celebrate base­ball season. My roommate avidly celebrates hockey season. We all gleefully (if not nerv­ously) await football season. But this, my friends, is the greatest season of all. Basketball season? Oh, no! It's awards sea­son! This fabulous time ofyear comes around every January -the glorious reprieve from the winter doldrums of post-Christmas time. While others are taking down holly and pack­ing up lights, Hollywood is rolling out the red carpet and shopping for diamonds. Competition to win everything from an Oscar to Best Dressed is in the air, and it is the grandest ofspectator sports. 
Awards season begins with the Golden Globes, kicking off the festivities in early January. They usually do a pretty good job of pmdicting the heavy hitters of the Hollywood Super Bowl held the last Sunday in February, the Academy Awards. In between we have the SAGs, the awards given by the Screen Actors Guild. Here's a breakdown of each awards ceremonies. 
The Golden Globes are awards given out by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, or HFPA. Hence all the winners thanking the "Hollywood Foreign Press." But who are these mad men (and women)? They are a group ofabout 90 journali'lts who are based out of southern California and write about ­you guessed it -movies and television. They attend all the usual press conferences and screenings surrounding the promotion of a picture. At the end ofthe year they get togeth­er and vote on the best of the best from televi­sion and motion pictures and host the Golden Globe Awards, which is basicallyjust a big tel­evised charity dinner. The HFPA is mostly funded by the Golden Globes, and they donate the money from the ceremony to various entertainment related charities. The lesson here? Ifa bunch of people witl1 the power to control the critical reception of your film toll you they want to host their own award'> show, you go with it. 
The Screen Actors Guild is thP muon for Actors who, well, do screen work (as opposed to stage), which ranges from movies to video games. They arA the actor's counterpoint to the lovely a.<Jsociation of writers who haltnd Hollywood last year with a strike and left us lacking a Golden Globes ceremony. like the Writer's Guild of America (WGA), SAG has been threatening to go on strike for pretty much the same rea.<;ons as WGA did la.'lt year, with internet rights and compensation for new electronic and alternative forms ofdistri­bution oftheir films. So far there ha.'l been no strike, but SAG is not yet content, and with good reason. Keep your eyes on these guys and let's pray it gets resolved nicely so we won't have another bleak season of never­ending reruns. 
The SAG awards are voted on by over 100,000 members. This is, for all intent'l and purpose, the most democratic award'l cere­mony. It is lbr actors by actors. It includes funky little categories like Best Stunt Ensemble. It also ha.'l my personally favorite categories: Best Comedy Series Ensemble, Best Drama Series Ensemble and Best Motion Picture Ca.'lt. These air Sunday, January 25th. 
Then comes the Big One, the Mother Load of Cinema Award'l: the Oscars! Hosted by thn Academy of Motion Picture Art'l and Sciences, these award'l arP hi'ltorically the most signifi­cant and tim ones people dream of winning. Tllis is the only ceremony with its own broad­ea.'lt of the nominee announcements, whieh will be Jan. 22 at 8:30a.m. The Academy Awards will be held February 22. 
The Academy was founded in 1927 by a bunch of Hollywood big wigs, and has about 6,000 members of producers, directors, actors, art directors and cinematographers. These guys are the cream of the crop in the cinema world and have a legacy longer than the HFPA or SAG, and therefore command the most respect when they decide to dole out awards. Their awards are strictly motion pic­ture oriented, so sorry, Tma, you can't pick up anything here. Unless of course they invent a category called We Thought Tma Fey Needed Another Award, which is always possible. But the real question is, why are they called the Oscars? Well, legend has it Margaret I Ierrick, Executive Secretary of the Academy back in the day, saw one of the first statuettes and said it reminded her ofher Uncle Oscar. 
So there you have it, awards season enthu­siasts. Go forth, now, and watch knowledge­ably, root lien~ely and bask delightedly in all the glitz and glamour ofthe next two months.

Among those finally reaching the arena was Steelers wide receiver Santonio Holmes, a former Ohio State player who sat in the student section and wore an "Oakland Zoo" T-shirt, like the 1,500 students who ring the courtside section for each game. 
Michigan State 78, Penn State 73 
Two of the Big Ten's best young point guards dueled down the stretch of a tight game. 
In the end, Michigan State's Kalin Lucas stepped up at the free throw line to stave off a furious comeback by Penn State and counterpart Talor Battle. 
Lucas went 6-of-8 from the line in the final 2 minutes and Raymar Morgan scored 17 points as the seventh-ranked Spartans nearly gave up a 17-point lead before holding on for a victory Wednesday night. 
"We had our hands full," Michigan State coach Tom Izzo said. "We were lucky to win." 
Goran Suton added 13 points and 14 rebounds for the Spartans (14-2, 4-0 Big Ten), who won their 1Oth straight and are off to their , best conference start since 1977­78. 
Down by 17 points with 13:39 left, Penn State (13-5, 2-3) mounted a furious comeback, getting within 71-70 With 1:30 left after an off­balance 3 from Battle. 
He fell to the court as the shot went through the hoop, whipping the crowd into a frenzied chorus of "Let's go State!" 
"That run may not have been as possible without those guys cheer­ing us on, giving us that little extra boost," said Battle, who credited the more athletic Spartans for tir­ing Penn State out early. 
"We had them right there on the ropes," Battle said. 
But the Nittany Lions couldn't break through as Lucas, who fin­ished with 15 points, hit four free throws after Battle's 3. 
Both Battle and Lucas are light­ning-quick sophomore guards who can blow by defenders and create open shots for teanunates. They're two of the top scoring guards in the Big Ten. 
Jamelle Comley led the Nittany Lions with a career-high 26 points, while Battle finished with 20. 
But Lucas had a little more help, with four Spartans scoring in dou­ble figures .. 
In typical Michigan State fashion, the Spartans also outrebounded Penn State 41-24. They controlled the lane, especially during a 26-8 run over the last 11:10 of the first half, which included a 7 -minute field goal drought for Penn State. 
The Spartans seemingly couldn't miss, getting easy drives and hitting open jumpers in taking a 42-29 halftime lead. The lead climbed to 55-38 after Durrell Summers' free throw with 13:39left in the game. 
"We stopped defending, I guess," Battle said. "Coach (Ed DeChellis) was livid at us at halftime." 
DeChellis was a little more sub­dued after the game. 
"I don't know what word we used, but I just wasn't happy with our defense in the first half," he said. "I thought we were playing against them instead of them play­ing against us." 
Penn State played dreadful spurts of interior defense midway through the game before clamping down in the second half, setting up the tense closing minutes between Lucas and Battle. 
Battle hit a jumper to close the deficit to four with 3:33 left. 
Then he darted into the lane before hitting Comley for an open layup to get within 69-67 with about 2:30 left. 
Izzo said his team suffered from offensive lulls, and got frustrated by Battle down the stretch. 
"Yeah, I'm disappointed we're still not finishing," Izzo said. "We have to do a better job of finishing." 
The loss snapped Penn State's seven-game winning streak at home against Big Ten opponents. 
Duke 70, Georgia Tech 56 
Duke picked the right opponent to have a miserable night shooting. 

Associated Press 
PITTSBURGH-The game start­ed late -and, for the second time in four days, so did top-ranked Pittsburgh. 
Tyrell Biggs was Pitt's leading scorer the first time in his career with 16 points, and the Panthers struggled early for the second time in as many games since reaching No. 1 before pulling away to beat South Florida 75-62 on Wednesday night. 
"Teams are going to play us tough," said point guard Levance Fields, who had 11 points and 13 assists. "Everybody expects us to win by 20 or 30 points, but the.(Big East) conference just isn't like that."_ 
Sam Young scored 14 points and DeJuan Blair had 13 points and 18 rebounds to help Pittsburgh (16-0, 4-0) achieve the third-best start in school history. The 1927-28 team went 21-0 and coach Jamie Dixon's 2003-04 team was 18-0 during his first season. 
The start was delayed 20 min­utes by a rush-hour snowstorm that clogged city streets and caused South Florida's bus and the game officials to arrive late. Dixon got within two blocks of the Petersen Events Center, sat for 30 minutes and finally parked because of the standstill traffic. 
"We looked a little laid back ­no more of them Qate starts)," Blair said, smiling. "You've got to get here on time or something. They came out shooting good and our defense was sluggish." 
The Panthers did much the same thing against St. John's on Sunday, leading 41-36 at halftime before going on to win 90-67. 
With Blair constantly helping them get second-chance Jmints, the Panthers shot 29-of-59 (49.2 per­cent)-10-of-18 (55.6 percent) from 3-point range after they came in shooting 34.1 percent. Blair, the nation's leading offensive rebound­er, has 50 rebounds in his last three games -an average of more than 16pergame. 
''I've been waiting for us to get that going, the 3-point shooting," Dixon said. "We're not going to lead the nation in it, but we're get­ting better." 
Dominique Jones and Augustus Gilchrist scored 22 points each and Chris Howard had 13 for South Florida (6-10, 1-3), which repeat­edly had trouble getting more than one shot on any possession. while being outrebounded 37-23. 
The Bulls, playing a No. 1 team for the third time in school history, might have gotten a burst of confi­dence from an 80-58 Win at DePaul on Saturday -only their second Big East road win. But they could­n't sustain several comebacks and finally fell behind by as many as 17. 
"They taught a lesson in how to rebound," coach Stan Heath said. "We would get a defensive stop, you'd think we were in good shape, but Blair would go get it." 
South Florida's other games against No. 1 teams were a 75-39 loss to North Carolina on Dec. 12, 1981, and an 89-72 loss to Cincinnati on Jan. 29, 2000. The Bulls have lost 24 consecutive road games against ranked teams. 
Pitt plays its next five games against teams that are or recently were nationally ranked, starting Saturday at No. 20 Louisville. The Panthers didn't figure to have much trouble against South Florida, which is 8-46 in Big East play, 2-25 on the road. 
But the Bulls hit a succession of off-balance and tough-angle shots to rally from deficits of 7-0, 16-7 and 30-22 to keep the game close, and trailed only 41-39 early in the second half-causing a few nerv­ous fans in the late-arriving crowd of 12,508 to wonder when the real Panthers would show up. 
That happened when Pitt went on a 15-4 run to stretch a 47-44 lead into a more comfortable 62-48

Duke (15-1, 3-0 Atlantic Coast Conference) was just 23-of-59 from the field, a 39-percent performance 
'that would have been enough to 
get them beat on many nights. Not 
this one. 
Georgia Tech (9-7, 0-3) turned it over 18 times, went only 7-of-19 from the free throw line and start­ed with three straight ACC losses for the sectnd straight season. 
Lewis Clinch hit a 3-pointer that pulled the Yellow Jackets within 46-41 with just over 8 minutes remaining. But Jon Scheyer hit twice from beyond the arc and Henderson also swished a 3, stretching the margin far beyond comeback range for a team of Georgia Tech's limited offensive 
skills. 
Zachery Peacock, with 13 points, was the only player in double fig­ures for the Yellow Jackets, who were a little more accurate from the field ( 41 percent) than they were from the line (37 percent). 
Duke's previous worst shooting effort was a 41 percent against Virginia Tech on Jan. 4. But the Blue Devils, who also started dis­mally at the line, hit enough free throws down the stretch to bury the Yellow Jackets. 
Georgia Tech surprisingly led through most of the first half, build­ing its largest lead when Peacock laid it in off a nifty pass from Lewis Clinch to make it 23-15 about 12 minutes into the game. 


Duke's David McClure and Georgia Tech's Nick Foreman battle for a rebound during the second half of Duke's.70-56 win Wednesday.

NORMAN, Okla. Heisman Trophy winner Sam Bradford wasn't ready to give up the life of a col­lege quarterback -not without a national champi­onship. 
The third-year sopho­more quarterback will return to Oklahoma next season, passing on a chance to be a high NFL draft pick. 
"I've dreamed about playing at Oklahoma since I was little, and my three years here have been prob­ably three of the best years of my life, and I really feel that there's no need to cut this experience short," Bradford said Wednesday at a news conference. 
'Tm really looking for­ward to coming back and competing for a fourth straight Big 12 champi­onship and another oppor­tunity at a national cham­pionship." 
His return also means another shot at a Heisman Trophy. Archie Griffin of Ohio State is the only play­er to win two Heismans. Florida quarterback Tim Tebow, .the 2007 winner, finished third behind Bradford in the Heisman voting this season. 
For the first time, the top-three vote-getters for the Heisman Trophy will return to college football. 
Tebow announced his intentions Sunday and Texas quarterback Colt McCoy said he'd be back for his senior season long before the Longhorns won the Fiesta Bowl. 
Bradford led the nation with 50 touchdown passes and a quarterback rating of 180.8. He likely would have been one of the first quarterbacks taken in April's draft. 
Instead, Bradford will take another run at a national championship with Oklahoma. .The record-breaking quarter­back led the Sooners to the BCS championship game this season, but they lost 24-14 to Florida. 
"Obviously it's frustrating to end with a loss and I want to come back and fin­ish my career the right way: on a win," Bradford said. "I would~ay it had a little bit of an iiilluence on my decision, but I really tried to keep that out of my mind because that could have limited myself to making the best decision for me." 
Bradford also let it slip that tight end Jermaine Gresham and offensive lineman Trent Williams also decided not to enter the draft early. Defensive tackle Gerald McCoy has also said he'll be back for another season with the Sooners. 

IN BRIEF Jury sides with Burress on 
damage to borrowed car 
LEBANON, Pa. -A Pennsylvania jury has sided with Plaxico Burress in a dispute over how much the New York Giants star should pay in dam­ages for a car he borrowed that ended up getting impounded by New York City police. 
A jury in Lebanon County civil court decided Wednesday that Burress owes $1,700 in damages, far less than the $19,000 sought by the dealer who loaned the car to Burress. 
Burress declined to comment afterward and was followed by a small crowd of fans seeking auto­graphs. 
Burress testified that his agent arranged for the Chevrolet Avalanche in 2005. Burress disputed that he had agreed to make person­al appearances for the dealership. 
New York police later impounded the truck after it was connected to a shooting incident. 
Mets' Santana unsure if 
he'll pitch in WBC 
NEW YORK -Johan Santana is unsure whether he'll be able to pitch in the World Baseball Classic follow­ing offseason knee surgery. 
The two-time Cy Young Award win­ner said Wednesday he'd love to play for his native Venezuela in March, but the New York Mets will deter­mine whether to clear him for the WBC. 
After a brilliant first season with the Mets, Santana had arthroscopic surgery Oct. 1 on torn cartilage in his left knee. He said he feels good and he might report about a week early to New York's spring training camp in Port St. Lucie, Fla., next month. 
Several Mets stars are expected to take part in the. WBC, including David Wright, Jose Reyes, Carlos Beltran, Carlos Delgado, Francisco Rodriguez and reliever Pedro Feliciano. 
Venezuela's first garrie in the WBC is March 7 against Italy in Toronto. 
Irvin calmly chats with 
gunman about Cowboys 
DALLAS -Hall of Fame receiver Michael Irvin says he calmly chatted with a gunman in another vehicle after the armed passenger turned out to be a Dallas Cowboys fan. 
Irvin, who was not harmed, says he was "very afraid." 
A Dallas police report says Irvin was. stopped at a red light Monday night when two men in a truck pulled up next to him. 
The driver rolled down his win­dow, so Irvin did the same, thinking the two men recognized the radio talk show host and television com­mentator. 
The passenger flashed a gun. Then the retired NFL star heard one of them call out his name and men­tioned being a "huge Cowboy fan." 
Irvin says he began talking with the men about the team's disap­pointing 9-7 season and Dallas not making it to the Super Bowl. 
The pair eventually drove off.

NFL 
Pats' Pioli hired as Chiefs GM 
Architect of New England dynasty hopes to resurrect 2-14 team 
Associated Press 
KANSAS CITY, Mo. ­Scott Pioli, who helped build and lead a dynasty in New England, is now in charge of a Kansas City franchise which hasn't won a playoff game in 14 years. 
The 43-year-old Pioli will be introduced on Wednesday as Chiefs gener­al manager, replacing Carl Peterson. 
"He will have complete charge of football opera­tions," Ryan Petkoff, a spokesman for Chiefs chair­man Clark Hunt, told The Associated Press. "He will report only to Clark." 
The fate of coach Herm Edwards and his staff was not immediately known. 
Pioli, who became vice president of player person­nel for the Patriots in 2002 and spent nine years work­ing with head coach Bill Belichick, also interviewed for the general manager vacancy in Cleveland. 
He inherits a young team coming off a 2-14 season, but is stepping into a situa­tion that seems ripe for a quick turnaround. personnel executive in the

y because KC owns the overall No. 3 pick in the draft. Besides that, there are a number of promising young players who Edwards was counting on as the foundation of his rebuilding project. 
Pioli, the son-in-law of Miami Dolphins boss Bill Parcells, has been honored many times for his contri­butions to the Patriots' three Super Bowl champi­onships. With Pioli working with Belichick, the Patriots used an effective mix-and­match of trades, free agent signings and draft selec­tions to dominate the league. In 2007, six players drafted by Pioli and Belichick made the Pro Bowl. 
"We are very excited to welcome Scott to the Chiefs," Hunt said in a statement. "With his proven track record of success, Scott is the finest player 
onship tra­dition with players that I am proud to call Patriots." 
Pioli's NFL career started when Belichick hired him as a pro personnel assistant for the Browns in 1992. Belichick then brought him to New England shortly after he became head coach of the Patriots. 
From 2000-08, the Patriots were an NFL-best 102-42 in the regular sea­son and rang up 14 playoff wins. 
"To sum up in words everything Scott Pioli has meant to this organization and to me personally would be difficult, if not impossi­ble," said Belichick. "From the day I met him, he has demonstrated a passion for football and respect for the game that is second to none." 
A club spokesman con­firmed there had been no determination made on 
Edwards' status. That may have been a point of discus­sion between Pioli and Hunt when they negotiated their deal. Hunt signed off on the rebuilding project that Edwards launched this year and said in training camp he knew it would be a painful process early on. 
And it certainly was. Beset by injury, including season-ending mishaps to the top two quarterbacks, the Chiefs beat only Oakland and Denver and set a number of team records for defensive futili­ty. Their 10 sacks were an NFL-low since the stat was kept beginning in 1981. 
Yet, when he announced the resignation on Dec. 15 of president, CEO and gen­eral manager Peterson, Hunt said he thought Edwards was the best man for the Chiefs program going forward. But he also said the new general man­ager would have "signifi­cant input" into the final decision. 
Edwards' first season in Kansas City was a hit. The Chiefs went 9-7 in 2006 and captured the last wild­card playoff spot. They were routed by Indianapolis, but Edwards was just the fifth man to take two different teams to the postseason in his first year; he also did it in 2001 with the Jets. 
He wanted to begin dis­mantling an aging team and start rebuilding that next season, but ran into opposi­tion from a front office that felt there was enough left for another playoff run. But after an encouraging 4-3 start, age and ineffective­ness at several key posi­tions began creating prob­lems. The Chiefs ended 2007 on a nine-game losing streak. Then Hunt agreed it was time to tear it down and rebuild. 
Now Pioli takes charge of those efforts. 
NFL 
Boldin practices, may play Saturday 
Associated Press 
TEMPE, Ariz.-Arizona receiv­er Anquan Boldin practiced Wednesday, and says he will play in Sunday's NFC championship game against the Philadelphia Eagles. 
Boldin, who with Larry Fitzgerald forms arguably the best receiving tandem in football, said a trip to a Dallas chiropractor has greatly improved his strained left hamstring. The injury kept Boldin out of the Cardinals' 33-13 victory at Carolina in Saturday's divisional playoff game. 
''I'll be out there Sunday," he said after practice. 
Boldin said he was able to partic­ipate in all phases of practice, but in shorter spurts than normal. 
He said he expected to be "real effective" in what would be the biggest game of his career. 
"I don't see there being any problems, no hindrances or any­thing like that," Boldin said. 'Til just be myself and resume my reg­ularrole." 
Coach Ken Whisenhunt held out final judgment on Boldin's status until he sees how the receiver does as the week progresses, but the coach was optimistic. 
"lf he continues to progress like we think he is, I have no doubts he would play," Whisenhunt said. 
Boldin injured his hamstring on a 71-yard touchdown pass from Kurt Warner in the second quarter of Arizona's 30-24 wild card playoff victory over Atlanta. He tested the hamstring before the Carolina game and said he would have played if the team's medical staff hadlethim. 
"Would it have been the smartest thing in the world? No," Boldin said, "but that's just me wanting to be on the field." 
Boldin said the hamstring prob­lem turned out to be related to a hip injury that sidelined him for three games last season. 
"I thought it was just a ham­string but the way that my body responded told me that it was something different," Boldin said. 
He flew to Dallas on Monday for treatment from chiropractor Robert Parker, whose patients include Boldin's former teammate Emmitt Smith. As Boldin explained, the earlier injury affect­ed the muscles around the hip and eventually led to the hamstring problem. 
"Muscles shut off, muscles around it worked extra hard," Boldin said. "...Correcting that and getting everything flowing the way it's supposed to helped out a lot. He told me once he set it straight it would be fine." 
Boldin said he would do "as much as they allow me to" in prac­tice this week. 
"We're just playing it by ear right now," he said. "We're going to be smart about it because the ultimate goal is to play on Sunday." 
He scoffed at any suggested that his participation would be limited. "If I'm out there," Boldin said, ''I'm out there." 
Boldin caught 89 passes for 1,038 yards and 11 touchdowns in the regular season, despite missing four games with injuries. 
His facial bones were fractured on a brutal hit from the New York Jets' Eric Smith on Sept. 28. Smith was fined $50,000 and suspended a game because of the hit, although Boldin that it was "just football." 
Boldin had seven plates and more than 40 screws inserted to repair the damage. Still, he missed only two games. 
Such experiences make him grateful to be back. 
''I'm thankful for every day I step out on the field," he said. "I've had a number of injuries that probably could have been career ending, but I've been given a second chance. Every time I step out I think of that." 
He also cherishes another shot at the Eagles, because he felt he did­n't play well in Philadelphia's 48-20 Thanksgiving night rout of Arizona. 
"It's rare you get a second chance at anything," Boldin said, "so I'll make the most of it Sunday."

NO WOMEN'S SWIMMING 
No sophon1ore slU111p for Maxvvell 
By MEAGHAN VESELIK 
Sports Writer 

Swimming against the top competition in the country is nothing new for sophomore Samantha Maxwell, who has picked up right where she left off at the end of her stel­lar freshman season. 
A season after setting the Big East record in the 200­yard breaststroke and swim­ming in five events at the Big East Championship, Maxwell has led the Irish with her times in the 100 and 200­yard breaststroke, and has become a central factor on the 200 and 400-medley relays. 
Nationally ranked while swimming for her high school's swim team in Chandler, Ariz., Maxwell was a four-time regional champi­on as well as a Junior National record holder in the 50-yard breaststroke, and earned All-American honors in each of her four high school season. 
In her freshman season at Notre Dame, Maxwell's tal­ent quickly became evident to her coaches and team­mates, swimming in the in the 100 and 200-breast­stroke, the 200 and 400­medley relays, as well as the 200-meter individual medly 
(IM). 
"First off, [being on the team] has provided me with a group of quality team­mates that I can not only train with, but be close friends with outside of the athletic scene," Maxwell said. "It has also put a lot of structure and support into my routine that I would not otherwise have." 
Last season, Maxwell earned the chance to swim all five of her events in the Big East Championships, where she won the 200­breaststroke while setting a league and school record of 2:12.76. Her 100-yard breaststroke won second place with a 1:01.68, earn­ing her a second school record, and helped her team place second in the 200 med­ley relay with a time of 
1:48.84. breaking a third Irish record. Her reign over the pool continued as she received an invite to the NCAA championships, where she placed 30th overall in the 100-breast with a time of 1:02.36 
Maxwell has also made an impact outside of the Notre Dame sports community, as she swam the 100 and 200­breaststroke in the U.S. Olympic Trials. 
"Swimming in these large meets has been really fun," Maxwell said. "Obviously, these meets bring the best competition available, but they also bring great oppor­tunities for swimmers to rep­resent their programs. When you go to meets like NCAAs and Olympic Trials, people take notice of where you are from and its awesome to be able to represent Notre Dame in larger scale meets." 
"Sam is just like any other successful athlete," Irish coach Brian Barnes said. "She is a very hard worker." 
Maxwell's love of swim­ming started at a young age, and grew as she did. 
"My parents put me in swimming because I was awful at every other sport I tried," Maxwell said. "When I started swimming I hated it, and my parents had to bribe me just to finish one lap without stopping. As I grew older and better little by little the sport just sort of stuck. I enjoyed the chal­lenge of trying to move up to the next big meet or get another qualifying time." 
Maxwell's parents weren't the only ones to encourage her to pursue her abilities in the pool. She recalls a coach from home, Dave Tait, as being the most influential person in her swimming career, and who fulfilled the role as her mentor as well as coach. 
"When I was younger, Dave really stepped up and became an awesome coach," Maxwell said. "Through the years we worked very closely together as I learned how to be a better swimmer and he learned how to foster a growing team and help its swimmers crop their talent and be successful. The things he taught me never stopped in the pool, and he helped me learn life lessons as well along the way. This kept me wanting to swim and wanting to be better outside of the pool as well." 
Swimming may not have been Maxwell's favorite sport at first, but now the thought of life without it is strange for her to think about. 
"Life without swimming would be weird," Maxwell said. "The sport takes a lot of commitment and if I was­n't swimming, I would have all of a sudden have a lot of extra time. I'm not sure what I would do with it except maybe sleep." 
At least for now, Maxwell plans on sticking with her sport. Not only does she love the sport itself, but also says her coach and teammates are what make getting in the pool every day worth it. 
"Brian Barnes has stepped into this program and brought a lot of expertise and commitment that this team is really grateful for. It hasn't even been an entire 


season, but it is apparent that he is dedicated to help­ing the girls on our team reach their goals and swim fast," she said. "What is awesome about Brian and his relationship with the girls on our team is that he knows what it takes to get the best out of each person individually and truly cares about their success. The girls on the team also makQ swimming for Notre Dame great. They are so support­ive and work hard to not only push themselves but push their teammates to be better." 
In her sophomore season, Maxwell has shown no signs of slowing down. In the Ohio State Invitational in December, she broke her own school records in the 100 and 200-breaststroke, posting times of 1:01.57 and 2:12.46, respectively. 
Maxwell has proved that she is a force that competi­tors should look out for this season, and in future sea­sons on the Irish team. She has swum against the best, and only hopes to improve. Her goals for the season reflect her commitment to her sport, and to her team. 
"My goals for this season are to go to the NCAA cham­pionships and really try to make an impact there. Last year I competed but didn't make it back for any second swims. This year I would like to be more competitive at that meet and make it back to the finals heats at night."

Pitt's McCoy will enter '09 NFL draft 
Associated Press 
PITTSBURGH-Record-setting Pittsburgh running back LeSean McCoy is passing up his fmal two seasons of eligibility to enter the NFL draft. 
McCoy broke several of Tony Dorsett's schools records while leading the Panthers to a 9-4 record and into the Sun Bowl. 
McCoy told coach Dave Wannstedt of his decision in a phone call Wednesday. The two met last Friday, but a teary-eyed McCoy couldn't make up his mind. He delayed the decision again Monday. 
"I have frequently played both choices in my mind. I have consid­ered my alternatives and I have prayed," McCoy said in a state­ment issued by the school. "I have made my final decision and will forego my junior season." 
NFL scouts project the 5-foot­11, 210-pound McCoy as a late first-round to early second-round pick. 
Losing McCoy is a major setback to Pitt, which played in its first bowl game and had its first win­ning record in four seasons large­ly because of his running and a strong defense. 
"When you have exceptionally gifted players, you realize the NFL can be a reality sooner rather than later," said Wannstedt, the former Bears and Dolphins coach. "Certainly that is the case with LeSean and we worked to make sure he had all the information needed to make the best decision about his pro prospects." 
McCoy rushed for 1,488 yards and 21 touchdowns this season, and 2,816 yards and 35 TDs in two seasons, or more yardage and touchdowns than former Reisman Trophy winner Dorsett had in his first two Pitt seasons. 
This season, McCoy's top games included 183 yards against West VIrginia, 169 against Notre Dame, 156 against Navy and 149 against Syracuse. 
McCoy had 331 yards in two games against the Mountaineers, including 148 in Pitt's 13-9 upset win in 2007 that kept West Vrrginia out of the BCS title game. 
"One of my goals in coming here was to help my teammates and coaches bring Pitt back to its rightful place among the promi­nent teams in college football," McCoy said. 
In late November, McCoy said he would return to Pitt because he felt he needed more time to mature and had more to accom­plish in college. 
McCoy changed his mind follow­ing a 3-0 bowl game loss to Oregon State on Dec. 31, appar­ently after talking to former Pitt receiver Larry Fitzgerald of the Arizona Cardinals, among others. Fitzgerald, a former Reisman Trophy runner-up, also left Pitt after two seasons. 
Pitt's staff believes McCoy began leaning toward leaving when he got away from his teanm1ates and coaches and returned to his home in Harrisburg, Pa. The team's poor performance -the lowest­scoring bowl in 50 years -appar­ently did not influence his deci­sion. He ran for 85 yards in the loss.

Pacers, Knicks, Heat top· tOO points in victories 
Associated Press 
INDIANAPOLIS -Danny Granger scored 24 points and made the tying shot late in regulation in the Indiana Pacers' 110-106 overtime vic­tory over the Detroit Pistons on Wednesday night. 
T.J. Ford scored 23 points, and Troy Murphy added 18 points and 13 rebounds to help the Pacers snap a three­game losing streak. 
Hodney Stuckey led Detroit with 30 points, Allen Iverson had 23 points, and Rasheed Wallace added 17 points and 15 rebounds. The Pistons have lost three in a row. 
It was Indiana's first over­time win in five tries this sea­son. 
Murphy's second 3-pointer of the extra period put the Pacers up 103-98 with just under 2 minutes to play. 
Detroit's Antonio McDyess made a layup to cut it 103­100, but Ford came back with a jumper that bounced several times before going in with 
38.5 seconds left to make it 105-100. The Pacers made five of seven free throws in the final 30 seconds. 
The Pacers led 78-77 in the fourth quarter before Detroit's Arron Afflalo made a 3-point­er, then a layup to give Detroit an 82-78 lead. 
Detroit led 92-87 before Indiana's Jarrett Jack made back-to-hack mid-range jumpers to cut Detroit's lead to one at 92-91 with just over 2 minutes left in regulation. 
With Detroit leading 93-91, Jack drove to the basket and missed a layup. He thought he was fouled, and was issued a technical foul for arguing the no-call. Detroit's Tayshaun Prince missed the technical free throw, but Detroit retained possession because of the technical. Iverson missed a long jumper, but Prince rebounded. Prince missed a jumper, and Indiana's Jeff Foster rebounded with 11 sec­onds left to give Indiana a chance tq tie or win. 
Granger hit the tying jumper from near the free-throw line, over Prince with 3. 9 seconds left. Detroit's Richard Hamilton missed an open jumper from the left baseline, but the ball went out of bounds off an Indiana player, and Detroit set up for a final chance with 0. 7 seconds left. Wallace threw up an awkward shot that missed everything, and the game went to over­time. 
Knicks 128, Wizards 122 
NEW YORK -David Lee had 30 points and 10 rebounds, reserve Al Harrington scored 27 points, and the New York Knicks handed the Washington Wizards their sixth straight loss with a victory Wednesday night. · 
Quentin Hichardson added 26 points for the Knicks, who have piled up the points in the first three meetings with the Wizards this season and can complete a season sweep by grabbing the back end of a home-and-home series Friday in Washington. 
Chris Duhon finished with 17 points and nine assists for the Knicks, who averaged 118 points in their two earlier vic­tories over Washington and were even better Wednesday. But they could never shake the Wizards until the final min­utes. New York led by only three before Lee got a layup off an inbounds pass and Richardson followed with a 3­pointer to make it 119-111 with 1:25 remaining. 
Lee, among the league lead­ers in rebounding and field goal percentage, added six assists. He was coming off a 24-point performance in the Knicks' surprising victory at New Orleans on Monday. 
Washington's Nick Young scored 33 points, establishing a career high for the third time in four games, and Caron Butler added 25. Mike James had 20 points, but the Wizards stumbled when he had to leave with five fouls. 
The injury-plagued Wizards have been without Gilbert Arenas and Brendan Hayward all season and then recently lost DeShawn Stevenson (back) and Etan Thomas (torn liga­ment in his left knee). But that's meant more time for Young, who was 13-of-17. 
The Knicks were opening a stretch where 10 of 13 games are at home, but they'd better get the wins early. The last three games, all the first week of next month at Madison Square Garden, are against the Lakers, Cleveland and Boston. 
Both teams had improved defensively lately, but were back to their old bad habits in this one. The Wizards shot 61 percent and the Knicks 59.5 percent in the first half, which ended with New York leading 67-66 behind 21 points from Harrington. 
Washington made eight of its first 12 shots, New York start­ed 8-of-13, and the Wizards were ahead 20-18 with the Bucks squandered several opportunities to tie, first when Richard Jefferson, who had 15 points, threw a pass away then was blocked on the ensu­ing possession by Shawn Marion. 

Cook, meanwhile, went 4­for-4 from the free-throw line in the final 21 seconds to give the Heat a 102-99 lead with 
6.9 seconds left. 
Bucks rookie Joe Alexander, who had hit a layup moments earlier to finish with 13 points, shot an air ball a 3-point attempt and the Heat ran off the final fraction of a second for the victory. 
Marion finished with 14 points and 10 rebounds. Miami also got 21 points from rookie Michael Beasley and 18 points from Udonis Haslem. Andrew Bogut scored 12 points and had 11 rebounds for the Bucks. 
Wade, revered in this town because of his role in taking Marquette to the NCAA Final Four in 2003, could have got­ten plenty of gear from the Bucks' pro shops, which stocked No. 3 Heat jerseys, socks and other memorabilia.

MILWAUKEE -Reserve Daequan Cook hit six 3-point­ers en route to a career-high 24 points, and Dwyane Wade overcame a 5-for-20 shooting night with 17 points and 13 assists in the Miami Heat's win over the Milwaukee Bucks on Wednesday night. 
The Heat improved to 3-2 on a seven-game trip even as Wade struggled, starting 0-for­6 from the field, but contribut­ing by distributing the ball. 
It looked to be easy even without the NBA's leading scorer adding his 29.1 average when the Heat took an 84-74 lead with 10:57 to play. But the Bucks came back thanks to 25 points by Luke Ridnour and 16 by Michael Redd. 
Ridnour's basket cut it to 97­93 with 2:09 to play and Wade missed his final four shots with Redd, a fellow Olympian, hounding him.

run together in practice, along with two other upperclassmen. 
"Our group is really competi­tive," Rincon said. "We all practice together and push each other." 
The four met during Rincon's visit to campus last spring, and he said they made the transi­tion to college easier for him. 
Rincon said the 400-meter race is one of the most gruel­ing events in track. 
"You can't pace yourself like you do for the 800, and you can't burn off the first 200," he said. "It really takes strength and speed and endurance and everything, so it's pretty tough." 
Just like when he runs the event, Rincon is determined not to fade too early in the sea­son. 
"I want to win the Big East in the 400," he said. "It's lofty, and it will be tough, but that's what I've been set on since I got here." 
Rincon did not begin running until his freshman year of high school, but it soon became

rebounding team. We've been competent and we haven't been beaten up there too much." 
Then came Louisville, who put up 19 second-chance points and out-rebounded the Irish 48-43 in an 87-73 Cardinals overtime win Monday. 
"I think we held our own there," Brey said. "We didn't out-rebound them, but it was kind of a draw. But it didn't beat us. The offensive board beat us at St. John's and Ohio State. There's two losses where that was really the culprit of it all." 
Louisville grabbed 16 offen­sive boards, but some of those came as a result of long rebounds from missed jump shots. Twice in the second half, Notre Dame was trying to build on a small lead, but long rebounds helped set up three­pointers from Andre McGee and Jerry Smith that cut into the Irish advantage. 
"Sometimes you do the job to bP in position to rebound the basketball and you don't get a good bounce," Brey E!aid. "And then you've got to scramble out and match up and do the best you can. We've made a living ofT of offensive rebound threes. When it happens to us, I can relate. Hopefully, it doesn't hap­pen too much." 
Harangody said there's still no excuse for allowing these types of boards to get away. 
"It's not bad luck. We still need to grab loose balls because that's going to be the difference because a couple of those loose balls they grabbed and then hit some threes," Harangody said. 
Hillesland added: "You've got to focus on every play and it can be tough because sometimes you're natural instinct on the perimeter is when a guy puts up a shot instead of blocking him out you want to go in where you think the action's going to be, which is inside. But a lot of times a ball will come out and those can be backbreaking plays on the. road when a team can get an offensive rebound and knock down a three." 
One constant on the boards this year for the Irish has been Harangody, whether he's grab­bing long or short rebounds, 
·clear that he would be able to 
run at the college level. 
"My coaches in high school 
really prepared me, starting 
junior year, to go to the next 
level," he said. "That's all we 
really talked about." 
Although he went to high 
school in Las Vegas, Rincon 
grew up in a southwest suburb 
of Chicago and his family lives 
in LaPorte, Ind. Because of 
that, he has been a Notre 
Dame fan his entire life. 
"I grew up watching the 
games," he said. "My family 
has had season tickets since 
like the '40s. I've gone to 
games since I was five." 
It was easy, then, to agree to 
come run for the Irish, and 
Rincon said he's glad he did. 
'Tve always wanted to come 
to Notre Dame," he said. "I 
love it. My dorm's a lot of fun, 
we all have a good time. I just 
like the community here at 
Notre Dame. It's really high on 
school spirit, and I really like 
that. I wouldn't want to be 
anywhere else."

offensive or defensive. 
"The rebounding numbers that he has are staggering given that he's playing against NBA bodies," Brey said. "Our league has NBA bodies. Other leagues don't so I think it's impressive what he's doing on the back­board against that kind of length and athletic ability." 
Coming up Saturday, Notre Dame will likely need another strong effort from llarangody and the rest of the Irish, as they take on a Syracuse team that's third in the conference in rebounding margin thanks to Paul Harris (8.3 rebounds per game) and Arinze Onuaku (7.8). That duo gave Notre Dame a handful at the Joyce Center last season, out-rebounding Notre Dame 51-33. 
"Here we go again Saturday with a big front line. Can we do it?" Brey said. "We've got to rebound out of zone, we've got to rebound out of man. Our guards have to help us. When we do that, we always have a chance to win."

Celtics abuse Nets in 118-86 win 
Associated Press 
BOSTON -Paul Pierce brought the Boston Celtics to the midpoint of the season wHh their third straight win and with hope that they've regained the rhythm that pro­duced a 27-2 start. 
Pierce shook off a cold first half and scored 18 points in the third quarter by going 5­for-5 on 3-pointers to lead the Celtics a 118-86 win over the New Jersey Nets on Wednesday night. 
The current streak follows a 2-7 slump and improved the Celtics' record to 32-9, two fewer wins than they had mid­way through last season when they finished 66-16 and won the NBA championship. 
"I thought we had a really big bump in the road these last eouple of weeks with con­sistency," Pierce said, "some­thing we didn't have a year ago. Maybe it's something we needed to give us a gut eheek. 
"When you go through something like that, you really find ouJ what kind of team you are." 
On Wednesday, the Celtics were the kind of team that got oil' to the best 29-game start in NBA history as they posted their third most lopsided win of the season. " . 
"They kicked us real good," Nets coach Lawrence Frank said. "When talent works hard like tl~.at, you get embar­rassed. 
Pierce led Boston with 22 points two nights after getting a season-high 39 in an over­time win over Toronto. The Nets also won in overtime that night, beating Oklahoma City. 
But the only tie Wednesday was 0-0. And New Jersey's only lead was 13-11 on a 3­pointer by Bobby Simmons. Hay Allen then gave Boston the lead for good with a 3­pointer that made it 14-13 with 5:56 left in the first quar­ter. 
"Even when you're winning, if you're not playing well, or right, for a coach it's not that enjoyable," Boston coach Doc Rivers said. "If you keep doing that, when you need to play well, you won't. But I do think we're turnin-g in the right direction." 
The Celtics led 51-41 at half­time and opened their biggest margin, 112-79, on a basket by Patrick O'Bryant with 3:21 remaining. 
Kevin Garnett scored 20 points for the Cclties. 
The Nets were Jed by Devin Harris with 17 points, while Keyon Dooling and rookies Hyan Anderson and Brook Lopez had 13 eaeh. Anderson made his second consecutive start in place of injured Yi Jianlian after sitting out the previous four games. 
"We really let them control the momentum in the third quarter," Anders{Jn said. "They are a great defensive team (and) definitely altered our shots." 
Pieree went just 2-for-9 and had four points in the first half. But New Jersey's Vince Carter was even worse -1­for-9 with four points in the half. Carter limped off the court with a sprained right ankle with 7:09 left in the first quarter b.ut returned 5 min-

Haywood coached the Irish for five seasons and also played for the blue-and-gold during the mid-1980s. 
"I tell guys all the time what utes later. He finished with four points on 1-of-1 0 shoot­ing. 

The Celtics quickly stretched their 10-point halftime lead by scoring the first seven points of the third quarter and 13 of the first 15. 
With the score 58-41. Pierce made his first 3-pointer of the quarter, Rajon Rondo hit a basket and Pierce sank a free throw. His other 3-pointers put Boston ahead 69-49, 74­53, 81-58 and 84-58. 
"I don't get discouraged by misses," Pierce said of his first-half problems. "When we swung the ball (in the third quarter) I was wide open and stayed aggressive. I thought I was a little tentative in the first half." 
Boston Jed 88-60 after the third period and Pierce rested throughout the fourth. 
Both teams were missing big men. Yi is expected to miss four to six weeks with a bro­ken finger and Boston center Kendrick Perkins sat out his third straight game with a sore left shoulder but is expected to return next week. 
The Nets stayed close throughout the first quarter then lost their shooting touch by missing their first 10 shots of the second. That helped Boston streteh a 30-23 lead after one qu_arter to 41-2 5 before Harris hit a layup with 
5:40 left in the period. The teams meet again on Saturday night at New Jersey. 
"We didn't have too much fight," Harris said. "We've still got a lot of work to do and I look forward to the next game."

Tean1 signs Frank Verducci as new offensive line coach 
By DAN MURPHY Sports Editor 
Notre Dame announced yester­day that veteran Frank Verducci -will be taking over as the new offensive line coach for the Irish. Verducci, who has coached for several colleges and NFL teams in the past 27 years, will replace for­mer line coach John Latina who resigned after four years with the Irish. Verducci comes to South Bend from the Cleveland Browns where 
MEN'S BASKETBALL 
 Irish work to improve under the boards against league foes 
By CHRIS HINE Sports Writer 
When Rob Kurz graduated last spring, he took his 7.3 rebounds per game with him. Kurz, along with forward Luke Harangody, helped the Irish attain the fourth-best rebound­ing margin in conference play. 
Last season, the Irish out­rebounded Big East opponents by just over three boards per game. This season, Notre Dame is tenth in the league. 
Since Kurz's departure, the Irish have tried to replace his presence on the glass at both errds of the floor, but at times, they have struggled despite hav­ing the league's leading rebounder in Harangody (14.0 per Big East game). 
The Irish lost two games this season that could have been avoided with better rebounding performances -a 71-65 loss to he served as an assistant offensive coach for two years under Romeo Crennel. Crennel and Irish coach Charlie Weis know each other well from their days as coor­dinators with the New England Pattiots. 
"Frank provides an excellent background on both the offensive line and run game in general from two perspectives, having coached several years in professional foot­ball and at the Div. I level," Weis said. 

Verducci has been in the NFL for the past decade with the Cincinnati Bengals, Dallas Cowboys and the Buffalo Bills before joining the Browns. During that time he worked primarily with ofl'ensive linemen and tight ends. 
He has also coached at many major college programs, most notably the ten years he spent at Iowa before leaving for the NFL. In that time, the Iowa offense aver­aged 170 rush yards per game, including three seasons during which the Hawkeyes rushed for over 200 yards per game. 
Notre Dame is hopeful that Verducci can rejuvenate an Irish run game that has been dormant in the past few years. This season, the team averaged only 109 yards per game. In 2007, that number dipped down to 75 yards per game, which was 115th out of 119 FBS schools. 
Along with help in the trenches, Verducci is also expected to help on the recruiting trail. He was a recruiting coordinator during part of his career with the Hawkeyes and is known for roping in big tal­ented players. 
"In addition, the name Verducci in New Jersey high school football is legendary as both his father and uncle were coaching icons," Weis­said. "This should aid our recruit­ing efforts in New Jersey and in the Northeast." 
Verducci grew up in New Jersey and played fullback at U.S. Merchant Marine Academy before

On the rebound 
~t. John's and a 6 7-62 loss to 
Ohio State. In each game, the 
Irish were out-rebounded, and 
dug themselves into a hole by 
allowing crucial offensive 
boards at pivotal moments in 
the second half. 
"[The loss to] St. John's was 
just not paying attention to 
details," senior Zach Hillesland 
said. "The rebounding was the 
big thing there. They got to the 
offensive boards a lot and they 
got a lot of confidence because 
of that." 
After the St. John's loss, Notre 
Dame recommitted itself to 
rebounding and saw some 
improvement. The Irish went 
toe-to-toe on the glass with 
Georgetown in a win at the 
Joyce Center and demolished 
Seton Hall on the boards in 
another victory. 
"I mean, we're never going to 
be a team where you go, 'We're

just can't make it be something 
that shreds us," Irish coach 
Mike Brey said. "For the most

Rincon excels in first season at Notre Dame 
Middle-distance runner has two wins 
By LAURA MYERS Sporrs Writer 
Jordan Rincon is off to a fast start-and middle, and finish. 
The Irish freshman middle­distance runner h·as won an event at both of the team's meets so far, outrunning sever­al of his upperclassman team­mates. 
''I'm happy with the early success," Rincon said. "I didn't really expect it, but I'm really competitive and I'm a sore loser. I don't like to lose. I push myself at practice all the time. I mean, I knew I could come here and compete, which is all I wanted to do." 
At the Blue and Gold Meet on Dec. 5, Rincon easily won the men's 400-meter race with a time of 48.34, a full second­and-a-half better than the mark needed to qualify for the Big East Championships.
