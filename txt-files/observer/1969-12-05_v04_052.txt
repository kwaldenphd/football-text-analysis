Notre Dame and St. Mary's released their joint academic calendars for next year which show the school year beginning in early September and ending the second week in May. 
The new changes had been in the wind for a long time. There has been talk for years about changing the semesters so that the first one would end before Christmas, eliminating the hectic three weeks between Christmas and exams under the current calendar. 
There had been major admin­
istrative problems to the change 
including the scheduling of sum­
mer school and of graduation. 
Typically there has been concern 
over holding Notre Dame's out­
door commencement exercises 
in the unpredictable weather of 
South Bend May. The worry was 
relieved with the advent of the 
Athletic and Convocation Cen­
ter. Commencement was held 
indoors last year and will prob­
ably be held there regularly with 
the new change. 

The new calendars will be the same for both Notre Dame and St. Mary's. The only minor exceptic'l will be the date for graduation. Traditionally St. Mary's has held commencement on the Saturday before Notre Dame. 1971 will be no excep­tion. St. Mary's exercises will be on Saturday the fifteenth and Notre Dame on Sunday the sixteenth. 
The Academic Councils of 
both schools approved the new schedule. Notre Dame profes­sors, who had the opportunity to vote on the measure, approved it overwhelmingly. Over 70% of them voted for it. It is not known whether St. Mary's professors voted on the calendar or not. 
There has been some appre­
_hension at St. Mary's by girls that the calendar change would not enable them to get in their 9 weeks required for student teaching in the spring. This and other technical questions will be answered next week as officials at both schools were unavailable late yesterday afternoon for comment. 
Under the new calendar the fall semester would begin on Wednesday, September 9. It will end on Tuesday December 15, with exams coming from Dec. 16-22. The only break will be the Thanksgiving holiday which will be the normal 4 and one-half day weekend. Classes will even be held on holydays and legal holidays. 
Christmas vacation will last for more than a month with classes resuming on 1anuary 20. The semester will continue to May 4 with exams the 5th through the 12th. There will be no Easter vacation but classes will not be held on Good Friday. The only other break will be for a week in March from the 13th to the 22nd. 
Saturday classes will he con­tinued. 
Mack speaks on cities 
by Shaun Hill 

Professor Raymond Mack, a sociologist, author, and the Director of the Northwertern University Center for Urban Affairs spoke on "Race and Class in an Urban Context" last night in the Engineering Auditorium. He spoke as a guest of the SU A.C in conjunction with the Urban Affairs Program. 
Prof. Max addressed himself to three main points: race, class, and urban problems. 
~-~· background to his speech Prof. Mack said two points must be kept in mind. First, that the present generation is the first urban generation in history. Secondly, it is the first educated 2eneration. 
Prof. Mack said that this belief of black as inferior has been instilled gradually into people's thinking, both black and white, throughout our history. 
Th~ first of his major points 
was about the class structure in 

Raymond Mack America. Mack stated that the notion the America as a classless society is a myth. Race has been used as a substitute for class. Black people in America are forced to occupy a position 

Prof. Mack calls an "underclass." It is a separated and lower system than that of white Americans. A black man in the top echelon of this underclass system can go no further and is generally inferior to a white man in the lowest echelon of the white system, he explained. The present generation is the first to seriously question this dogma, according to Mack. Intellectuals in the past have

Procedure for 'Ten' outlined 
by Cliff Wintrode 
Observer Associatg Editor 

Notre Dame "Ten" defense counselor Gary Mcinerney announced last night that he is no longer officially associated with the Ten and their appearance before the Appeals Board. 
He will continue to serve in an 
advisory capacity to the Ten, 
however, as the ten students

TMH speaks at Senate 
WASHINGTON (UPI) -The Rev. Theodore M. Hesburgh, chairman of the Civil Rights Commission, urged the Senate yesterday to kill a House amend­ment that would prevent the government from interfering with "freedom of choice" deseg­regation plans in the South. 
Hesburgh, president of the University of Nctre Dame, warned a Senate appropriations subcommittee the amendment, sponsored by Rep. Jamie L. Whitten, (D. Miss.), would be "an irreversible setback to the over all effort to achieve deseg­regation and equal opportunity throughout the nation." 
He said the commission's investigations had shown that freedom of choice plans, under which children may attend any school in a district they please, "are not free and are designed to continue the very segregation which has been held unconstitu­tional." 
The Whitten amendment would prevent the use of federal funds to force attendance of students at a particular school against the wishes of himself or his parents. 
Hesburgh said the commission found that, under freedom of choice plans in certain parts of the South, a black parent who \"!anted his children to attend a white school suddenly would find himself without a job or subjected to economic and social reprisals.

"We feel it is better for our 
appeal that we speak rather than 
Gary," said Jack Molitor, one of 
the Ten. 
Mcinerney felt the Ten will be able to "articulate their defense more effectively by taking an active part in it" as opposed to haveing a defense counselor doing the talking for them. 
He added that by presenting their own defense they can escape the '"legal semantics" and add "credibility to the idea of a Christian community." 
"I do not feel that I can defend them in the way in which 1 they want be defended," Mcinerney said. 
The Ten's basic defense is expected to revolve around the nature of what they did rather than the legal questions involved in the case. 
"We do not want to base our defense on the legal aspects of the case but instead make it an appeal to the morality of the thing," explained Molitor. 
"Our appeal is not going to be based on whether the fifteen minute rule was properly invoked, but rather upon our motives," he continued. 
Mcinerney said he hoped that Father Riehle will dispense with his legal counsel so the case can be handled solely by father Riehle and the ten students. 
"It is a matter between the 
Ten and Father Riehle and it 
ought to be settled bet ween 
them and not between agents of 
each side," he stated. 

Mcinerney reported that the decision to have the Ten present their own case was the result of a mutual agreement between himself and the Ten and was not motivated by any other concern except that of the Ten. 
Molitor said since discussion of possible methods of presenting their defense began, the idea of the Ten presenting their own case was discussed "several times." 
A final decision was not made until Tuesday night, after the Ten had announced earlier that day to the University Court that they wo~d prefer to go before the Appeals Board, Molitor said. 
"We have been very happy with the way Gary has handled the case and we are very grateful to him for his help," said Molitor. 
Mcinerney had no comment to make on either the handling of the case so far by the administration, the decision by the Ten to go before the Appeals Board, or the effectiveness of the Ten's proposed defense. 
He cited the danger of prejudicing or harming in any

The Constitutional Court, the highest tribunal in the country, overturned Thursday a Fascist era penal code which held that 
could be convicted of adultery but husbands could not unless they lived in open con­cubinage with a woman. 
The court said the law was written at a time when women did not want equality with men.

Food serv1ce, DHC cooperate 
Edward Price, Director of 
Food Services, today called for 
increased co-operation between 
the Food Service and the 
newly-formed Dining Hall 
Commission. 
He went on to cite the 
tremendous response to the 
Commission's current 
"Feedback" program as evidence 
of the group's worth and 
speculated that the results of 
that poll should be coming in 
the near future. 
Price also expressed a desire to work with the Commission, 
to distribute advance copie8 of menus so students know them before the meals. This will come in handy particularly when exams necessitate missing meals as it will give the students a chance to be selective. 
When questioned about the Food Service poll of November 

12, Price said that the results were being processed and would be made public when completed. The rationale behind the survey 
Re -Con offers employment opportunities 
by John DiCola Mike Shaughnessy, NSA Co­odinator, announced yesterday that through Notre Dame's membership in the National Student Association, the services of Re-Con Corporation will be made available to Notre eame students this month. The object ot the service is to match students who need jobs with employers who need talented students. The service is available to iuniors, seniors, and graduate students, looking for either full -time or summer employment, at no cost to the student. 
The only thing the applicant has to do is to fill out a shgle questionaire and mail it, :·,ostage free, to Re-Con in New York. The one form on file with Re-Con exposes the student's talents to hundreds of companies, who will then contact those students who meet their needs. 

SJ aughnessy will not have a complete list of those companies. 
According to Shaugrnessy, Student Government will receive some compensation for handling publicity and p3fising out the for·-ns. Student Government will be paid a commission for each fon!l returned to Re-Con.

"My hasic aim is flexibility, I 
want to get the most out of every dollar that I can. The University makes no profit on the food service; it is just what it says, a service," Price said.

complicate food service, outstanding among these is .he. number of me:Us to be served. "You can't please everyone all of the time, our aim is to please most of the poeple, most of the time," Price continued. 
It was pointed out that many felt that the .meals on the two days prior to the survey were better than usual and asked Puce if this was not an attempt to sway the students. He said the meal calendar had been n.lanned far in advance and contended that the survey was inserted at

SMC Tickets 

The decision by the ticket office to exclude St. Mary's girls from the sale of Cotton Bowl tickets is rather foolish, to say the least. This move is rather incredible in a year when the newly expanded co-exchange program has gone into effect, and administration officials talk about the "Notre Dame-St. Mary's Community." What is being done in effect is that part of the community is being excluded from an event we are participating in for the first time in forty years. 
We can see no reason whatsoever wi1y St. Mary's girls should be excluded from the sales. It is their team just as much as the students at Notre Dame. They cheer just as loudly, and feel just as strongly as anyone else here about the team. Many of the girls have already made plans to go down to Dallas. The people in the ticket office seem to have missed the entire pomt about cooperation between ND and SMC. The students are supposed to be brought closer together by sharing experiences. It is rather difficult to share the experience of a Cotton Bowl game, when the girls can't even get a ticket. 
We call on the ticket office to change its policy on bowl tickets immediately. If there is a shortage of tickets feared, then perhaps the student allotment of 1 ,000 could be increased. After all, this is only one-twelfth of NO's allotment. It is hypocritical to talk of a community, and then deprive part of it of the right to attend an important event. 

The car is a 1969 Corvette owned by Al Kremitsky, a 2nd year law student. It was stolen from the D 2 parking lot on Nov. 16th and was later found by the South Bend Police burning on Sample St. We think there is a need for improved security protection.

FRIDAY, DECEMBER 5, 1969 


Chris Wolfe 
A middle way 
In recent years there has been much increased use of the concept of civil disobedience as a weapon or tactic. Briefly, the thought behind it seems to be this: if one sincerely evaluates a law, and finds it to be. unjust, and is willing to accept the consequences of disobeying that law, then he is morally justified in doing so. 
It is hard to say what exactly has been the stimulus to this increasing use; maybe the "Sartrean view of freedom'. or maybe its simple convenience as a political weapon or maybe a whole variety of things. More likely it is a reaction against long acceptance' of inequitable conditions sanctioned by laws (Jim Crow legislation in the south) and against a passive German acceptance of Hitler's regime which led to horrible consequences. Insofar as it is a reaction ,to these, it is a perfectly natural humanitarian distaste for such 
things. 

The whole issue though raises a very important question about democracy: whether in fact it is really workable. The fundamental principle of democracy is that people will accept the will of the majority until such a time as they may persuade enough peopl<~ of the rightness of their views that they become the majority themselves. If this principle is not upheld then democracy becomes a two-step process of election and then battle to see whether the majority can coerce the minority into accepting its laws. Democracy would thus be reduced to alternate elections and civil wars. 
The real question is whether democracy can work when important matters (concerning justice) are at stake. If it is to work successfully as a peaceful method of government, then the minority must accept this principle. But the belief of civil disobedience is a rejection of this. It holds that in matters of "justice" a minority can claim the right to reject the normal processes of society. 
How can this problem be resolved: It can't be completely, I don't think -there is simply no clear-cut answer that approximates an ideal. But it does seem as if there is a better path, one which will avoid the extremes of abject passivity before any government and a rejection of a basic tenet of democracy. 
The path is this: to reserve civil disobedience to cases not of merely an unjust law, but to cases of unjust laws promulgated by an unjust authority. 
The difficult thing to define here is "just authority", but simply put it is government sincerely dedicated to the common good of society, and not merely to the advancement of only a part. Thus Hitler's government is "unjust" because it was dedicated only to the Nazi ideology. Nixon's government, on the other hand, while it may pass laws that some people consider unjust, is legitimately elected and dedicated to the common good of our society, even if theat idea of the common good differs from the views of others. 
Obviously this does nqt solve everything. The question of just authority is not alway( easy. That question however has a tremendous advantage ov~ the question "is this particular law just (and if not so, I'll disobey it?") The advantage is that it gives democracy a chance to work even on the most important matters of government.· A person can accept, if not like, an "unjust" law, realizing that it is the product of a sincere dedication to the common good, and still hoping to change it through the peaceful democratic process of persuasion and election. On the other hand, in the much rarer cases when the government is itself unjust (when it may have power, but not just authority) then and only then will the citizen reject the authority altogether, with its law or laws. 
This may not be a perfect way of politically organizing society, but it gives democracy a chance while not denying the ultimate rights of human conscience.

The party was over 
by Tom Ehrbar 
At that very moment the party gathered its second wind. Morgan, his face conceeding an expression of bland innocence, stepped up two concrete blocks and entered the apartment. The screen door had a busted spring and it banged behind him. 
When it banged something within the girl Morgan had brought quietly released itself. The girl breathed unevenly and glanced about on an awkward neck not knowing which way to go, or what to do. She was a sophomore in college majoring in English lit; a polite, meticulous, almost lovely girl. She was content, she thou~ht, if not happy. For two hours this evening she had listened to the radio. she had sat on a bed with nine of her friends in a big triple in her dorm, popping popcorn and listening to a dreary ritual of numbers and birthdates. She waited for Morgan's birthday. She was shaking inside, yes afraid. A pocket of cold air hid within her chest. 
Occassionally one of the others would blurt out an obscenity or a moan, but the girl did not hear it. She heard nothing, only that November 29 had not been called. And as the ritual wore on, leaving behind certainty and uncertainty, which­ever is more staggering, the girl slipped out of her maroon loafers, got up off the bed, and carelessly plopped herself on the floor. Still she wondered, have I missed his date, I must check to make sure. 
When Morgan's birthdate came up number 35 3 was assigned to it. The girl rolled over on her stomach and tucked her face amid two bent elbows so she could cry unnoticed.She wanted to leap and fly about the room. Respect for the others would not allow it however. Then Morgan called. He was coming over. They 
would celebrate. She had no time to shower, and too lavishly she sprinkled powders and perfumes over her worried sweat. 
The girl hurried down the steps of her· 
dorm, not waiting for the elevator, and in 
her rush and delight she tripped and 
spilled a bag of popcorn she was bringing 
to Morgan. 
In the car, a battered Chevy with a 
hole in the floor board, Morgan said he 
was happy, very happy. He said it twice, 
but still he was not the usual grinning, 
playful Morgan. He sat a little too straight 
behind the steering wheel, stared a little 
too intensely out through the windshield, 
glanced a little too stiffly at the rear view 
mirror. The girl figured it was all due to 
the evening's tension. He needs to relax, 
she thought. 
Morgan and Morgan's feelings were important to her she admitted. Not that she planned to marry him or anything. But she did entertain the possibility from time to time. And now that Morgan was freed of military obligations, well for all practical purposes freed, he might begin to notice her in a more serious light. She prayed to herself that he would, just as the cold Chevy pulled into a parking lot which had its neat lines of yellow wasted 
by cars parked randomly and at every conceivable angle. The two of them crossed to the darkened apartment and then it was that the screen door applauded behind them. 
The girl wanted a sofa and softly rubbed the back of Morgan's neck.. "Hey Morgan, how'd ya do Baby?", a voice yelled. 
Morgan smiled and said almost apolo­getically, "I think I'm OK, 353." Laughs, hisses, insincere blasphemies, Soon a crowd of forms gathered around Morgan, throwing limp arms on his back, handing him a beer, asking him to guess what their numbers were, explaining their elaborate yet absurd schemes, shouting stale jokes about winters in Canada, asking him what he was going to do now. After the clatter and noise subsided, Morgan disappeared to the basement. 
The girl he was with pretended not 

to inind and hid in the kitchen alone 
amid a litter of empty Schlitz,bottles and 
distorted cardboard cartons. It wasn't 
until trom pure exhaustion and bewild­erment she dropped to the floor where a patch of light had been let in from the · moon that she discerned the two figures clumped together as one under a torn 
navy blanket. 

She ran, with no steps, into the living 
room. There a small tribe of slightly 
intoxicated, good, responsible, college kids formed a magical enclave over a simmeri"ng fondou pot, their mysterious faces peering downwards. They com­municated in secret incoherent laughter. 
Before they drove back to her college, Morgan put a board he had in the trunk over the hole in the floorboard to keep out some of the cold. He also apologized, said it was a group party anyway, and just as they reached her dorm, said he had decided to drop out of school and move to Boston. 
Ten more for Spiro T. 
In his never-ending quest to repulse all of the people all of the time, the Vice-president has once again managed to divide and conquer anyone's notions that he possesses anything more than a 'Crush Huntley-Brinkley' bumper sticker. 
Two days ago, the Edsel of the Nixon Administration gave America the "Ten Commandments of Protest." In a rebuttal which can be surpassed only by Agnew's original banalities, I am proud to present "The Ten Commandments of 
Spiro T. Agnew. " 

"Thou shalt insert thy foot in thy mouth at all times. 
"Thou shalt say only that which was oft' thought but never so poorly expressed. 
"Thou shalt cast from thy mind the protests of millions and the findings of the pollsters, finding solace in the LordNixon's Silent Majority. 
"Thou shalt not under any circum­stances speak in a positive or optimis­tic manner; or 
"Thou shalt not bring us together. 
"Thou shalt not attempt to under­stand the actions of protestors, but shalt dispose of them with the words 'effete snobs.' 
"Thou shalt not open thy mind to any but thine own narrow pre-conceiv­ed ideas. 
"Thou shalt not judge a person by 
his ability and intellect, but by his age 
and appearance, casting from thy 
house the long hair and the protestor. 
"Thou shalt do the Lord Nixon's will, but cause him great wailing and gnashing of teeth doing so. 
"Thou shalt not be troubled by thine own protests heard through the media by the masses; but shalt rave and storm at the protests of millions throughout the land. 
"Thou shalt become a household word." 
--brought forth from the Mount by Dave Stauffer in the first year of the Lord Nixon.
