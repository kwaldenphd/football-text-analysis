A love once flipped for is never forgotten 
Wednesday, April6, started out like any other day. 
I came back from my morning classes, read the Chicago Tribune in my room, then went across the hall to read a friend's copy of USA Today. 
Sifting through the 257 or so stories USA Today finds room to fit on a single page, one stuck right out at me. 
Using their incomparable investigative jour­nalistic skills, USA Today reporters asked 1984 gold medal winner Mary Lou Retton if she had a steady boyfriend. And Mary Lou replied that she was indeed seeing someone in Texas. 
Wednesday, April 6, marked the end of my adolescence. 
I should have seen it coming eventually. After all, it was almost four years since I had developed a terminal crush on Mary Lou by watching the 1984 Summer Olympics on televi­sion. But the sudden ending of it all in a USA Today story (she could at least have sent a Dear John letter, for crying out loud) made me immediately begin reminiscing about my last innocent adolescent infatuation. 
It began when I watched the Olympics on television that year. I had read some pre­Games publicity about some 4'9" pixie from Fairmont, W.Va., who was the USA's top hope in the gymnastics competition at Los Angeles. But when I actually saw her, I was spellbound. 
I was attached to the set for the remainder of the week, cheering her on as she garnered perfect scores in the floor exercises and vault, becoming the first American to win a gold medal in the women's all-around competition. 
During the next week, I picked up copies of Time, Newsweek, Sports Illustrated and People, all of which had Mary Lou pictured on the cover. The magazines still are collecting dust on my bookshelves. Okay, maybe I've kept them from getting too dusty. 
Now it was time to start defending the latest object of my affections from the inevitable criticism. 
She's too short. Heck, I'm only 5'6". Mary Lou is just the right height for me. She has fat thighs. She's got powerful thighs. She's so fat. She weighs only 92 lbs. I looked it up in a Sports Illustrated article. 
This one-way romance reached its utopian heights a couple of weeks after the Olympics. My family was in Orlando, and the Olympic medal-winners were touring Walt Disney World for a day. I saw Mary Lou, surrounded by a mob of people, heading for Fantasyland (I'm not searching for a pun; she really was going to Fantasyland, walking toward It's A Small World). 
I immediately ran as fast as I could, and 
before I knew it, I was side by side with the 
woman of my dreams (Well, actually there was a security guard between us, but let's not gettechnical) . 

Mary Lou turned to her right and handed me an American flag that she was holding. Okay, what really happened was that she said, "Does anybody want this flag?" a friend of mine ended up getting the flag, and I grabbed the flag from my friend. But why get into sordid details? 
I spent the rest of the day clutching that flag with all my might. Catastrophe almost struck when I was riding Pirates of the Caribbean, and water somehow got on the flagpole, but I reassured myself that the water did not land on the part of the flagpole that Mary Lou had touched. 
This Mary Lou infatuation lasted a little while longer. I collected magazine advertisements that had my dreamgirl endorsing Energizer batteries, Wheaties, Pony shoes and Vidal Sas­son. 
But I never went overboard. I didn't boycott the Duracell corporation. I didn't wake up early and sit through the Smurfs on weekends, so I could watch Mary Lou's Saturday morning ex­ercise programs. (Actually, those came out a couple of years after the Olympics, and by that time the Smurfs seemed in better shape than Mary Lou.) 
So my crush on Mary Lou had just about worn out by the time I heard the terrible news last week. But it still caused me to reflect on those old adolescent crushes of my pre-college days. 
I wonder what Kristy McNichol has been up to lately.

fighting disagreed over whe­ther the trucks which moved across the border contained troops. One source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they apparently were empty and intended for use in a Soviet withdrawal. 
Another source said the trucks were believed to contain elite combat units to replace engineering and other support troops that are thought likely to be among the first to be pulled out. 
The activity was reported the day before the Soviets were ex­pected to sign as guarantors of a United Nations agreement on the withdrawal of the Red Army from Afghanistan. 

The Soviet units headed for Gardez, 80 miles south of Kabul and 60 miles from the Pakistani border, consisted of an un­determined number of soldiers and 420 vehicles, including T-72 tanks, armored personnel car­riers and mobile rocket launchers, said one adminis­tration source. 
Mujahedeen guerrillas recently cut the road to Gardez, where a Soviet special forces, or spetsnaz, regiment is gar­risoned, said one source. 
The advancing column and the spetsnaz regiment are also expected to attack stockpiles of 
guerrilla armaments.

SMC poetry reading features Levertov 
Special to The Observer 
Poet Denise Levertov, ac­claimed for more than two decades for her modest and moving verse, will present a reading today at 8 p.m. in Car­roll Auditorium on the Saint Mary's College campus. 
Praised by fellow poet and critic Kenneth Rexrothas "the most subtly skillful poet of her generation," Levertov has numerous volumes of verse, es­says, broadsides and limited editions to her credit since the first American publication of her work in 1948. Her collection "The Freeing of the Dust," published by New Directions Press, won the Lenore Mar­shall Poetry Prize in 1976. 
with the work and traditions of the Black Mountain school, Walt Whitman and William Carlos Williams. She has also been noted for the beauty and sensuality of her nature poems, her haunting poems on grief, love of friends and friendship and for her condemnation of war and assaults against na­ture. 
Her recent collection, "Breathing the Water" (New Directions), draws upon themes of spirituality and warns of the failure to respond to the beauty of the real world.

"By the time the Democrats get to Indiana, over 70 percent of the delegates will be selec­ted," said Quayle who would like to see the primary moved foreward. 
Quayle's live speech was the first of its kind at a Notre Dame convention, said Brian McCarthy, press secretary for the convention. McCarthy said the operation required the in­stallation of a special telecon­ference line and the use of a satellite dish. Much of the work in providing Quayle's live speech was done by The Young Republicans organization at Notre Dame, said McCarthy. 
The choice of speakers, ac­cording to McCarthy, was lim­ited to those who were avail­able. "A lot of Senators were asked," said McCarthy, but be­cause of the abundance of work going on in the Senate around Easter, "Quayle was the only one who accepted."

Dukakis: Gore needs the facts 

Associated Press 
NEW YORK, N.Y.­
Democratic presidential can­didate Michael Dukakis said Wednesday that rival Albert Gore "ought to get his facts straight" after Gore touched off a campaign clash about the use of nuclear weapons in Europe. 
President Reagan, his vice president on the campaign trail and talking tough about drugs, stepped into the political arena himself, s~ying politicians don't criticize Jesse Jackson for fear of being labeled racist.

having a good time," added Smith. 
Cuomo, while not an official Democratic candidate, had support from many delegates. "He's the only person with na­tional appeal," said Marg Clarkson, Ohio delegate. "He's the only person who can beat Bush." Cuomo came in last on the second ballot, only one del­egate behind Jackson. 
Rich Coglianese, leader of the "draft Cuomo" campaign, immediately threw his support to Gore after the loss. "He's the closest in line to Cuomo's policies, and he needs sup­port," said Coglianese during the two-minute speech alloted losing campaign managers. 
After Cuomo's loss, state chairmen and delegates tried to convert Cuomo supporters. Colleen Prentice, Ohio delega­tion chairman and a Cuomo supporter, was immediately surrounded by supporters of other candidates after the an­nouncement of Cuomo's loss. "I'll do what our entire delega­tion wants me to do," Prentice said after the lobbying efforts. 
"Things are changing every minute," said Jackson mock campaign manager John Far­ley. He proved himself right as his third place candidate fell to fourth and out of the race in the 
next roll call. The Cuomo delegates appeared to split be­tween the Dukakis, Simon, and Gore camps, while Jackson ac­tually lost votes. 
Farley asked Jackson sup­porters to vote for Simon after the loss. "Jackson and Simon are the two most liberal candi­dates," said Farley. "They stand for what America needs. It's important to keep psycho­logical unity, and these two candidates agree on a lot of is­sues," he added. 
The fourth ballot saw Gore's campaign lose by 61 delegates to Simon, with Dukakis in front 
by  12  delegates.  Many  
delegates  expected  the  en­ 
dorsement  of  Mary  LaSata,  

Gore's mock campaign manager, to boost Dukakis or Simon to victory. 
LaSata said in her concession speech, however, that "both are excellent candidates. Both have sane policies. I don't want to underhand either cam­paign.'' Although she said later that "most of my delegates probably want Dukakis," LaSata said she could not en­dorse one candidate over the other. The second ballot saw some controversy involving the New York delegation. Conven­tion rules allowed a state to vote all of its delegates on a percentage basis if only some of the state's delegates were present. 
New York delegation chair­man Brian Holst announced his delegation's vote as "41 for Jackson, one for Simon, and one for Gore." Because New York had only seven delegates pres­ent, the Mock Convention com­mittee ruled that each delegate had to take seven votes to make up New York's 49 delegates. 
said I:ving, _b~cause "Not~e Dame ts a pohttcally apathetic campus." 
Deichak, however, said he became involved as a delegate for the experience, knowing he "will never go to a real one." The most important aspect for Deichak is the platform, which was composed entirely by Notre Dame students and gives a "strict reflection of the stu­dents." 
"This is not a Democratic convention," Deichak said, but "a political party for Notre Dame." He said he felt that in creating the platform, "good arguments were given" to in­decisive views on issues. 
As delegatess, many of the students are experiencing a new facet they never knew would be so interesting. "I am now more familiar with the in­tricacies of the convention," said California delegate Bo Balesh, adding the event is "awesome and a great learning process for students." 
Chairman of the New Mexico delegation Phil Lucero said the convention "gives people in­sights into politics" and the

"I have to believe that a great many of us would find ourselves in great disagree­ment with the policies that he is proposing, and would per­
. haps be more vocal about them, if it wasn't for concern that that'd be misinterpreted into some kind of a racial at­tack," Reagan said. Gore stirred a new foreign policy controversy in the final week of the New York primary campaign after Dukakis told the New York Daily News "we reserve the right to use nuclear force" in the event of a Soviet invasion of Europe "when 
"procedures people don't know about." 
Ohio delegate Lisa Orchen said she enjoys the excitement the event generates. "All your friends are here," said Orchen, making it a "unique event to be involved in." Colleen Pren­tice, chairman of the Ohio 
delegation,  agreed,  saying,  
"it's fun  to  rally  and  carry  
signs."  

utah delegate Ken Bonacci said he is ''not really involved in politics," but is "having a good time." Bonacci said at first he thought the event would be ''a stuffy affair,'' but it has proven "to be a lot of fun." 
Michigan delegate Peter Stenger remarked that a con­vention representing both the Republican and Democratic platforms "would have given an even more interesting per­spective." Stenger, nonethe­less, enjoys the opportunity to "hear others' views and debates in an exciting man-there appears to be no other al­ternative." He added, "I don't think that's going to happen." 
Gore, battling for survival in the three-candidate race for the Democratic presidential 
nomination, quickly jumped on the Massachusetts governor and said he had "made a sig­nificant mistake in saying that he would launch a nuclear strike against the Soviet Union under . . . specific circum­stances." However, Dukakis never used the word "strike." 
At a news conference in Bos­ton, Dukakis said Gore "ought to get his facts straight." 
ner." 
Most of the delegates were disappointed, however, with the low turnout of student par­ticipation. "I wish more stu­dents would have participated since they indicated that they would," said Bill Fitzgerald, 
chairman of the Minnesota delegation. 
Fitzgerald said if "people were forewarned about the re­sponsibilities," they might have been more sincere in their decision to participate. 
Pennsylvania Chairperson Matt Bradley said, "there were a lot less than there should be." The amount of time required might have proved "a bigger committment than was ex­pected," he said. 
utah delegate DeeAnn Boel­beier agreed the event was de­manding on students' time, but added, "It is a good chance for people to get politically in­volved."

Jackson 
"What does Jesse Jackson want?" This seemed to be the question that emblazoned virtually every headline across the country. Following the Mic­higan caucuses, however, that question was aptly rephrased to "Can Jesse win?" From the beginning, Jackson simply demanded that his candidacy be afforded the same degree of serious­ness and respect as that of his Demo­cratic and Republican rivals. Now armed with the title of Democratic front-runner, Jackson has ultimately changed the dynamics of American politics. Race is certainly a consider­able factor in the 1988 election; however, the Achilles' heel for Jack­son's campaign will be his controver­sial political background and his lack of traditional government experience. Win or lose, he has demonstrated that America will soon be ready for a black president in the White House. 
Lisa Boykin 
in through the out door 
On Thursday, Apr. 8, I read with great concern Bill Sammon's article en­titled "Jackson demeans Democratic Party." Notwithstanding my personal views regarding Jesse Jackson's presidential campaign, it is evident that Sammon makes several problematic statements about minority group politics and the American dem­ocratic process. 
Sammon comments that Jackson has received "monolithic support from the black community, simply because he is black." This is a gross oversimplifi­cation. To assert that Jackson's success in the black community is derived solely by virtue of his color is to neglect the issues at hand and to debase the integrity of the black electorate. It is evident from Jackson's commanding Michigan victory that his campaign ex­tends beyond the traditional color lines. For example, he garnered 70 percent of the vote in Michigan's "thumb" region which has only two percent blacks. Obviously, Jackson's broad base of support is not necessarily lim­ited to minorities and ethnic, working­class whites for he seems to have at­tracted a plurality of the Democratic electorate. Jesse Jackson's message has such a massive appeal because Ronald Reagan's legacy of "voodoo" economic policy has not only served to triple the national debt and exasperate the plight of the lower class but it has 
Doonesbury 



campaign transcends color 
also clutched at the purse strings of America's working middle class. 
Furthermore, Sammon argues that the Democratic Party should not "al­low Jackson to be a significant power broker" and that "it would be inex­cusable for the Democratic Party to force his kindergarten politics on the entire nation." Sammon even goes so far as to describe Jackson as a "rabble­rouser"--a term I find offensive and in­appropriate. What Sammon fails to per­ceive is that the people have entrusted authority in Jackson with their ballots. His political strength was not given to him by the party--he earned it. There­fore, statements such as "Jackson doesn't deserve the political success he has enjoyed" are moot. With regard to oratory skills, Jackson clearly stands head and shoulders above his Demo­cratic and Republican rivals. I doubt that there is enough caffeine in the world to sustain interest in a Dukakis 
v. Bush campaign. 
Although it has been argued that Jackson's presence has threatened the party's chances for the presidency, I would assert that he has bolstered the party by registering several million new voters which incidently helped the Democrats to regain control over the House. What will ultimately secure the White House for the Democrats, though, is the eventual surfacing of reports detailing the involvement of George Bush and his cronies in the Iran­Scam. 
A common misnomer that Sammon falls prey to is to characterize minority politics as "radical". It is an interest­ing historical note that when formerly oppressed groups in American society have organized to demand the rights that were supposedly guaranteed to them by the Constitution, they were deemed as "radical". One only needs to recollect that Martin Luther King, Jr.'s philosophy of racial equality was hailed as such during the 1960's because it posed a potential threat to the status quo of segregated white America. Jesse Jackson is no more the "bearer of black politics" than Al Gore is the bearer of white politics: Jackson just happens to be the only black in the national politi­cal limelight, and his controversial po­litical undertakings ·should not be viewed as the standard norm for minority politics. 
This country's political and economic climate is ready for a charismatic leader who espouses a more equitable redistribution of economic resources. Whether or not Jackson will be that can-dictate has yet to be determined. However, he has clearly influenced his party's political agenda and has forced this nation to re-examine such issues as economic injustice and the war on drugs. In fact, Jackson's stance on various issues has been incorporated into the Democratic platform. If Jack­1 son legitimately edges out Mike Dukakis with the most popular votes and number of delegates come July, he rightfully deserves a place on the Dem­ocratic ticket as the presidential nominee. The political reality is that we live in a democratic society. The individual with the most votes is the one who wins. To deny Jackson this po­sition in some smoke-filled convention room in Atlanta would destroy the party's unity and ultimately tear at the moral fabric of the United States. 

Although it is too soon to predict the outcome of this presidential race, recent Gallup polls have revealed that if Jackson were to go up against Bush in November, Bush would capture 57 percent of the vote to Jackson's 33 per­cent. If Dukakis were the nominee, the Massachusetts governor would defeat George Bush 49 percent to 45 percent. More surprisingly, though, the polls reveal that if Bush were to face a Dukakis!Jackson ticket, the Democratic party would seize a 48 percent victory over Bush's 43 percent. These figures clearly illustrate that Jackson has res­haped the dynamics of American politics. Although Jackson's name may not appear on the Democratic ticket, he has obviously paved the way for fu­ture minority presidential candidates and has carved out a significant role for the minority and economically dis­advantaged electorate. 
An understanding of the 1988 presidential run for the White House can only be grasped if one has reckoned with the dimensions of minority group politics in this country. To underes­timate the growing power and influence of the minority polity or to apply a dif­ferent set of standards in evaluating minority candidates is to do an injustice to the system and the ideals of the gov­ernment it represents. Jesse Jackson's campaign will be savored for many years to come because, by challenging the system, he has demonstrated that America will soon be ready "to rise up and live out its creed so that one day individuals will be judged on the con­text of their character and not by the color of their skin."

Oh, those things spring brings! 
MARIA JUKIC accent writer 

l\ h, spring... With the men­"-tion of the word comes images of sunny days, cool breezes, and bodies on the quads of Notre Dame. For the Notre Dame community, which has been imprisoned in the bleak cold of the South Bend winter, spring is an awakening of sorts. New life is everywhere. New leaves on the trees to new attitudes of the students. 
"Spring just makes you hap­pier in general," said one stu­dent. Another added, "I don't mind getting up in the morning as much when the sun is out. I 
just want to be outside." 
And outside is where Notre Dame students flock when the warm weather hits. "Spring seems to affect people in phys­iological ways because of the extended daylight," said Ursula Williams, a language professor. "You are waking up earlier, staying up later, and being more active. The physical activ­ity level is much higher." 
Groups of students abandon dorm rooms and invade the outdoors to practice their own form of sun-worshipping. Sun­bathers offer their very bodies to the whims of the sun. Ath­letes (or pseudo-athletes) defy the heat to shoot hoops, toss a football, or just frolic in the sun. Die-hard joggers thrive in the rejuvenated scenery. 
Leisure activity seems to be the rule, not the exception, for students during the spring. But 
what about school? "Spring makes your attitude on life in general better, but it tends to make your schoolwork worse," said one student. 
Students in spring seem to have so many options besides schoolwork. Their decisions are obvious. "Students are more easily distracted in class when the weather gets nicer," said Williams. "There is more daydreaming and looking out the windows." 
Why is this so? 
"Because spring means it's almost summer, and summer means fun," ,said a student. 
"Spring makes everything seem easier, like there's noth­ing you can't do," added an­other. 
"The sun and nice weather make it hard to be inside and studying. There's so much more to do," said a third. 
Spring tends to put things in perspective. It makes people happier in general. "Everybody has a lovely, whimsical look on their faces," observed Professor Harvey Bender. "Life is once again evident at Notre Dame. There is great promise for the world and the future. All is refreshing and neat." 
It seems to be a general con­census that spring, somehow, changes people's attitudes for the better. A smile appears more often than not, and people seem happier. Life is worth living once again. Wel­come spring! 

guided by expertise of Auriol 
Community College before coming to Notre Dame. He is married, has a ten-year-old son, and enjoys different sports, including tennis and soccer, as hobbies. 
Auriol gives credit to the men's coach Mike DeCicco for this season's great success. According to Auriol, the team's record of 27-1, a second place finish in the NCAA Champion­ship, and the selection of three players as All-Americans, came from, "Notre Dame's fine reputation which attracts solid atheletes year after year." 
In the next month, Auriol will know how next year's recruits look, and he is already optimis­tic. "My favorite part of coach­ing involves watching fencers develop and reach their poten­tial," Auriol said. "I enjoy teaching all three weapons: the sabre, epee, and the foil, and helping the men and women progress." He added that coaching is primarily the same in North America as in Europe, but there is a greater number of experienced fencers over­seas. Auriol sights the two coasts as hot spots for Ameri­can fencing, and notes that in recent years, the Boston area has produced several female standouts. "I never look back at success, though. If you do that too much, you endanger your future. I always look for­

ward to see how I can im­prove," said the coach. The transition that Auriol makes from college coach to 
Auriol has served as coach of the United States Olympic Fen­cing Team for the last ten years, and will be in Seoul for the Games this summer. Auriol has also coached the American entries in the 1978 World Championships, the 1976-79 World Junior Championships, and the the 1977 World Univer­sity Games. 
A native of France, Auriol holds a masters degree from the Institute National duSport in Paris. An all-around athelete, he was a professional rugby player as well as an excellent fencer. "Rugby was always my number one," said Auriol. "but you can't play it forever." Upon moving to the United States in 1972, he settled in Portland, Oregon, and formed the Salle Auriol Fencing Club which pro­vided private instruction to aspiring students. 
According to Auriol, his greatest accomplishment as a coach occurred when four fen­cers were selected by the Olympic team. From 1975 to 1985, Auriol coordinated the fencing program at Portland Olympic coach each year is "not difficult and proves to be ~ most interesting." Though col­legiate fencers are seldom

The Observei>'Rob Regovich Students perform on opening night of 'The Glass Menagerie'. 

oLder than 22, Olympians may be as old as .35. "There is no set peak age for a fencer," Auriol said. "The new training practices have lengthened the careers of many competitors." Even with the longevity, Auriol admitted that it is difficult for American fencers to excel in the Olympics. "The European nations are still the favorites," he said, "but who knows. One night, one match, anything can happen so I am optimistic." 
As coach of the 1980 Olym­pic team that boycotted the Moscow Games, Auriol remem­bers the disappointment of the atheletes. 'They sent us to China instead," he said, "but it was not the Olympics. The spirit was not there." The Los Angeles Games were different, however, and were made even sweeter by the boycott of 1980. "The spirit in 1984 was so high. The feeling of entering the Coliseum in the opening ceremony was so special, so unique. As we marched around, it seemed as if the whole track was filled by the 
U.S. team. I look forward to this year." 
Notre Dame seems to have good reason to look forward as well. In Auriol, the fencing pro­gram has a gentleman with a prolific record who is loved and admired by player and peer alike. 
As Tom Michael Grant suc­cessfully executes his duties as both narrator and son, the audience undoubtedly captures his internal struggle between fulfilling his dreams and taking care of his family. Claudia Wilson also performs well as the disabled daughter, Laura. Wilson gains the audience's pity as she portrays Laura's immobilizing self­consciousness and timidity. 
Daniel Gore brightens the production with his appear­ance as Jim, the gentleman caller. Most noteworthy, Jane Anne Riedford treats the audience to an outstand­ing performance as the mot­her, Amanda. She dives into her role as a melodramatic woman, whose perceptions are clouded by reminis­cences of and desire for a stable but vigorous, colorful life for her children and her­self. The nuances of Ried­ford's voice and gestures wonderfully mold the charac­ter. 
Despite a few slow mo­ments, the performers es­sentially interact smoothly and naturally on a well­designed set. "The Glass Menagerie" deserves ap­plause as worthwhile enter­tainment.

Lyle seeks 3rd straight win 
correction 
Junior attackman John Olmstead maneuvers against Lake Forest In Wednesday night's 11-7 Irish win. Olmstead leads the Irish In scoring with 
28 goals and 15 assists. Pete Lafleur has the detail of Notre Dame's ninth victory on page 16. 



Former pitcher has no regrets 
Associated Press 
SANTA MONICA, Calif.­
J.R. Richard, one of baseball's most respected and feared pitchers until a stroke at age 30 ended his career, harbors neither bitterness nor regret over what happened. 
"Everything has worked out for the best, that was the plan God had for me," said Richard, whose story will be the subject of a movie. "The main thing is I'm healthy and doing fine. I'm very content. " 
A lot of people thought Rich­ard was healthy and doing fine while pitching for the Houston Astros in the summer of 1980. But the 6-9 right-hander wasn't, and he knew it. 
"I knew I didn't feel right," he said. "Pitching against the Cubs in the middle of June, my arm started hurting in the third inning. The doctor with the team didn't diagnose the prob­lem, he put ice on my arm." 
Things got worse, even though he was the starting pitcher for the National League in the All-Star Game on July 8, where two scoreless innings earned him a victory in his only All-Star appearance. 
Richard was examined several times, and an ar­teriogram revealed an arterial blockage in his right arm on July 25, but the neck arteries were said to be normal and no surgery was recommended. 
"I went to the hospital, I was diagnosed as a head case," he recalled. Some people also called him a malingerer, despite his record. 
In 1976, Richard was 20-15 with a 2.75 earned run average and 214 strikeouts. In 1977, he was 18-12 with a 2.97 ERA and 214 strikeouts. In 1978, he was 18-11 with a 3.11 ERA and a big­league leading 303 strikeouts. And in 1979, he was 18-13 with a 2.71 ERA and, again, a big­league leading 313 strikeouts. 
On July 30, 1980, he was 10-4 with a 1.89 ERA with 119 strikeouts in 114 innings. 
That was the date it hap­pened. 
"I was on the field, tossing balls back and forth. All of a sudden, I felt a loud ringing in my left ear. I just laid down on the (Astrodome) floor. I re­member the ambulance com­ing to pick me up. Then I passed out," Richard said. 
He had suffered a stroke, caused, he said, by a blood clot. 
Associated Press 

HILTON HEAD ISLAND, 
S.C. -Greg Norman once referred to the newly-crowned Masters champion, an easy­going and low key man, as "Sleepy Sandy." 
~'01' Sleepy Sandy has the po­tential to accomplish almost anything he wants," Norman said after Lyle won the 1985 British Open. 
"I think I have the sleep out of my eyes now," Lyle said on the eve of his quest of a rare, third consecutive victory, in the $700,000 Heritage Classic. 
And, with eyes wide open, Lyle likes what he sees in a review of recent action. 
Last week, the husky Scot be­came the first British subject qualified to wear the green

He doesn't know the score but does know that the Seahawks convert 41 percent of fourth­and-five situations in away games. He can't tell you who is on top in the AL East, but he does know Mike Pagliarulo is hitting .244 with two out and runners in scoring position in the last three innings of a game. 
Stat Man keeps the Elias Baseball Analyst on his qesk and subscribes only to l!JSA Today. He is the annoying per­~on who buys the baseball scorecard for a quarter and ac­tually keeps score--throughout the entire game. 
At the stadium on that Satur­day afternoon, you will be forced to listen to one of these types. And one of them will be forced to listen to you. Maybe stadiums should assign seating by the type of fan and keep everyone happy, especially all the irrational, irresponsible monsters that normal people transform into at the start of the game. 
jacket of a Masters champion. His triumph at Augusta, Ga., was his third of the season and made him the first man in three years to win consecutive titles on the American tour. 
"I don't think I can play much better than I have in the last few weeks," Lyle said. 
This week, he is attempting to become the first man since Gary Player in 1978 to win three in a row.

looks to Kepler 
_t,..· -----......... .._ 
By CHRIS FILLIO Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame golf team will travel this weekend to the land of the legendary Golden Bear in an attempt to stake its claim as one of the up and com­ing schools in the Midwest. After an excellent finish at the Purdue Spring Invitational, the Irish golfers will seek to con­tinue their hot play. 
The Kepler Intercollegiate is a 54-hole tournament held an­nually at the Scarlet Course in Columbus, Ohio. The host and favored team from Ohio State will feature Gary Nicklaus, son of the legendary Jack Nicklaus. The elder Nicklaus also atten­ded OSU and helped design the Scarlet Course, which is con­sidered one of the best col­legiate courses in the Midwest. 
"Over the years, we've had some success there," said Irish head coach Noel O'Sullivan, "but generally speaking it's been our nemesis. Year after year we have one or two mag­nificent rounds, but very sel­dom three magnificent rounds." 
However, this could be the year for the Irish to break that jinx. Junior Pat Mohan cur­rently leads the Irish with a 75.9 stroke average. Senior captain Dick Connelly is providing the necessary leadership and boasts past success at the Kepler. Last year Connelly finished 15th out of a field of 120 with a final score of 229, including best score for the third and final round at 72. Con­nelly presently has a 77.5 stroke average. 
"This year, I feel that it may be the right time for a change," said O'Sullivan. "I am looking forward, as is the te!lm, to three consistent rounds. Along with the success of Dick Con­nelly, both Doug Giorgio and Pat Mohan are coming along like gangbusters." 
The starting five for the Irish Gold Squad will be rounded out with freshmen Paul Nolta, who also finished highly at Pudue, and Pat Kusek, a four-letter man out of Longmont, Colo. 
The Irish team is a relatively young one and has served to provide a unique cohesiveness for the players. Coach O'Sullivan has experimented with several variations in his starting team. Sophomore Bobby Kloska has also proven his abi1ity to play on the col­legiate level. The Elkhart na­tive comes off an excellent freshman year and is presently vying for a chance to prove himself as a member of the Gold Squad. 
"We're feeling good," stated O'Sullivan. "We have quiet op­timism. It's more than just hope, but it's not over­confidence. The team is glad to be under a little pressure. We're shooting for high place­ment as well as a proud perfor­mance in the tournament. We have the youth, experience, desire and attitude. All we have to do now is to go out and do it." 
The competition for the tournament will include teams from the Big Ten and Mid American Conference, as well as all the major independents. The top contenders will be Ohio State, Illinois and Kent State. The team from Ball State will be expected to surprise every­one once again, as they consis­tently have. "The Ball State team will come out firing, with their flashy red plaid pants and all that."

ND, IU get rematch 
Teams to meet in 'Golden Boot' charity scrimmage 
By PETE GEGEN Sports Writer 
INDIANAPOLIS-Thanks to a certain soccer match last fall and a group of promoters' ac­tions this spring, tonight's Notre Dame-Indiana soccer scrimmage has turned into more than just a scrimmage. 
It is being touted as the Golden Boot soccer match, a game pitting state rivals in a charity match for the U.S. Olympic Comittee in the state of Indiana.

from this rivalry. 
Indiana is still smarting from its 4-3 overtime upset loss at Notre Dame in the fall. It marked only the third time in 15 years a team has scored four goals against the Hoosiers, and the Irish did it a man short, coming from behind twice. 
Mter that game Indiana won 16 straight and claimed the top ranking in the coaches poll un­til eventual national champion Clemson beat IU in the tourn­ament. Despite the team's suc­cess, time has not healed the wound inflicted by the Irish. 
"We'll be playing to win," 
said Yeagely of the scrim­
mage. "We haven't forgotten 
that loss." 
The revenge factor alone is 
worth the $5 admission price at 
IUPU-Indianapolis track and 
field stadium. 
"Thi.s is a big game for In­
diana," says Irish head coach 
Dennis Grace. "Yeagely knows 
our recruiting was helped by 
the IU win." 
Let's not forget this match is 
just a scrimmage, and both 
teams are trying to evaluate 
talent for the coming fall 
season. 
"We're going to do what's 
best for Notre Dame soccer," 
said Head Coach Dennis Grace. 
"We're going to play new 
people and try new things. I 
don't want to get blown out 5-0, 
but there are some things we 
have to accomplish." 
For this scrimmage Notre 
Dame's 18-man roster will be 
missing wingback Tom Con­
naghan, who has a shoulder in­
jury, and wingback Alex Kratz, 
who has chosen this spring not 
to play soccer. Also missing 
from last fall's starting lineup 
is senior captain Steve Lowney. 

Indiana loses a few more seniors for this match, three of whom started against Notre Dame--keeper Bruce Killough, midifelder Simon Kanter and wingback David Eise. More importantly the Hoosiers will play without midfielder Ken Godat and stopper Marc Be­hringer, both of whom were in­jured in indoor play earlier this semester. 
-
Indiana had a very success­ful indoor season, winning the St. Louis Budweiser Invita­tional and losing in a shootout in the championship match of the Northwestern Invitational. 

-
In those same two tournaments Notre Dame placed fourth at Northwestern and failed to move out of the preliminary bracket at St. Louis.

Wildcats 
By SCOTT BRUTOCAO Sports Writer 
Complacency and good oppo­sition pitching were two factors that effectively shut down the Irish baseball team yesterday. Despite the home field advan­tage and recent success, Notre Dame fell to Northwestern 5-0. 
The Irish were carrying a 20­14 record coming into the game, winning 14 of their last 19 contests. Wednesday, they were unable to get anything started. 
"We weren't mentally ready to play," said first-year coach Pat Murphy. "We have to play consistently every day, but we weren't mentally ready today. We played our worst game of the season." 
Part of the reason for the poor offensive performance of the team was the Northwestern pitching. Starter Tony Ariola blanked the Irish for six in­nings, allowing only five hits. 
In the final three innings, Notre Dame managed only three singles off three Northwestern relievers. 
"You have days like this," said Murphy. "You have to wipe them off and keep going. We lapsed mentally because we've won 20 games, but we can't start thinking that way if we want to win." 
This is the 18th-straight loss 

to Big Ten powers for the Irish. 
By GEORGE TRAVERS Sports Writer 
Notre Dame tennis jumped into the forefront of college ten­nis on Wednesday when it received a letter of intent from the top tennis recruit in the­country. David DiLucia, the lOth-ranked high school player in the country, will enroll as a freshman in the fall. 
First year Irish coach Bob Bayliss is overjoyed at the prospect of coaching DiLucia, a native of Norristown, Pa. 

Bob Bayliss 

"This will be a signal to the country," Bayliss said. "Notre Dame will be a team to be reckoned with in the future. In terms of eligible college players, he is the prospect." 
DiLucia has compiled some awesome statistics over the last few years. His most recent accomplishment was winning the Easter Bowl tournament in Florida. The Easter Bowl is the biggest junior tournament in
-the country. Bayliss first met DiLucia at the National Junior Tourna­ment in Kalamazoo, Mich., last August. 
-
blank -Irish 5-0 
The last time Notre Dame defeated a Big Ten team was a 22-4 romp against Northwes­tern in 1986. 
Most of the damage against the Irish occurred in the first inning against senior starter Kevin Chenail. Mter allowing a leadoff walk to Todd Frese and a single to Tim Buhe, Chenail gave up a three-run homer to outfielder Bob Brucato. 
When the very next battter, Bob Beacon, doubled, Chenail was replaced. Mike Harmon got the call, and although Bea­con came around to score on a ground ball and a fielder's choice, Harmon pitched ex­tremely well. 
Harmon pitched seven in­nings and allowed only one earned run. He gave up five hits and no walks, and picked off three baserunners. 
"I came in with the attitude basically to hold them right

where they were and stop their------------------------------------­
momentum," said Harmon. "I felt confident with all three of my pitches, and was able to get ahead on the count. I felt strong." 
Notre Dame plays host to MCC rival Detroit this weekend at home. With a doubleheader on Saturday and then again on Sunday at Jake Kline Field, Notre Dame's spot in the postseason MCC could be se­cured. 
Bayliss, NO tennis land top recruit 
"That was a real flesh mar­ket, and I don't really get into that," said Bayliss. "I just told him where Notre Dame was going and why we might get there. He seemed interested." 
DiLucia placed third in the New Hampshire indoor at Thanksgiving. That tourna­ment featured the top 128 junior players in the country. It was then that Bayliss learned Notre Dame would be one the schools visited by DiLucia. DiLucia's signing was a move noticed around the country. 
"Notre Dame is making a huge commitment to upgrade tennis," said former tennis great Arthur Ashe in Chicago last weekend. "Think of it, Notre Dame with all it's clout. That's the biggest news I've heard in months. This will upgrade not only Notre Dame tennis but all schools that play Notre Dame." 
Bayliss feels there are a number of reasons why DiLucia chose Notre Dame. He is a member of the National Honors Society and academics are important to him. Notre Dame's difficult schedule was a factor. 
"Two important reasons I would mention are the Eck and Dick Rosenthal,'' said Bayliss. "We couldn't even approach DiLucia without a center like the Eck. Dick Rosenthal sat down and answered any ques­tions that David and his family had. These two factors demon­strated the school's commit­ment to the tennis program."

If Notre Dame splits with Detroit, the Irish would almost be assured of a bid to the MCC tourney. If they take three of four they would clinch a bid, and if they sweep both doubleheaders, the Irish would be virtually guaranteed to host the tournament. 
As of now the Irish stand at 6-2 in MCC play. Dayton is second at 2-2 and Detroit hasn't played yet. The winner of the MCC tournament wins a bid to the NCAA tournament. 
IRISH ITEMS--Kevin Chenail's start yesterday broke the record for most career starts by a Notre Dame pitcher at 33 . . . second baseman Mike Moshier suf­fered a sprained right wrist in the second inning yesterday on a stolen base play. His condi­tion is stated as day-to-day. Steve Skupien replaced Mos­hier and went two-for-three .

Irish lax downs Lake Forest 11-7 in Krause opener 
By PETE LaFLEUR Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame lacrosse team took a trip through the Twilight Zone in its game Wed­nesday with Lake Forest as the 11-7 victory seemed more like the game tape of the Irish's earlier 11-6 victory over the Foresters on April 1. 
Senior tri-captain Tom Lanahan led the Irish from his middie position with three goals and two assists while junior attackman John Olmstead contributed a goal and an two assists as the team moved to 9-1 for the season. Senior goalie Matt McQuillan had 11 saves, coming up with nine in the first half. 
The last time the two teams met the Irish led 9-1 toward the end of the third quarter. In that game Lake Forest threw a scare into Notre Dame by closing to within 10-6 with five minutes to play. 

This time around the Irish had a big third quarter on their way to scoring nine goals in a row and led 11-2 with 13:29left in the fourth quarter. But the Foresters came back against the Notre Dame reserves to pull within 11-7 at the 4 : 44 mark before the Irish starters re­entered the game to secure the win. 
Notre Dame scored its five third-period goals on only seven shots and shot 44 percent for the game, significantly above its season average of 30 percent. What makes those stats even more impressive is the fact that seven of the goals came from the middies, who usually attempt tougher out­side shots. 
"We shot terribly as a team (1-for-20) in the second half against Kenyon's zone last week, and a lot of that has to do with the fact that the middies are not used to being the ones counted on to score," said Lanahan, who led the team in scoring for the second time this year. 
"A good team shoots around 35 percent for a game and hope­fully we're on that track now." 
Just as the game followed the bluebrint of the previous Irish­Foresters clash, this contest was true to form for Notre Dame in another way. For the fifth time this season, the Irish scored five goals or more in the third quarter to produce a com­fortable lead. 
According to Irish head co­ach Rich O'Leary, the third quarter is often the most cru­cial time in the game. 
"In the third period the teams start equally and both can make significant adjust­ments and come out with con­fidence," O'Leary said. "The third quarter is when you can turn the game around and for­tunately we've been successful in the third when we've had to be." 
A key factor in the win was Notre Dame's ability to clear the ball up the field. The Irish cleared 14 of their final 15 at­tempts, in part due to a halftime adjustment that utilized the faster midfielders to bring the ball upfield. 
Lake Forest coach Wayne Braxton said that his team could do little to thwart the vir­tually error-free Irish clears. 
"We did everything we could to stop them but you can't do much when they keep catching the ball," Braxton said. "I think in one sequence they passed the ball nine times with­out a mistake. The bottom line is that they did what they had to do in key situations. Their top three guys on midfield (Lanahan and fellow tri­captains John McNicholas and Art Brady) played tough and if they lost the ball they scrapped and got it back." 
A reader's guide to fan behavior 
You stand in line, you buy a ticket, you head for the stadium on a Saturday afternoon, you find your allotted seat (or any other one that looks good) and you feel like a normal, rational, responsible human being. 
But, at the opening pitch, the kick-off, the face-off or the opening tip, you become a different being. A fan. A monster. 
Fan is short for fanatic. No one, once that game starts, is sane, and yes, we all can relate to certain types of fans. 
We've all been seated near Loud Mouth. A for­merly decent (currently armchair) athlete now sporting a tremendous beer belly, Loud Mouth is behind his team all they way but can't help but let the 6,000 people or so within the range of his voice that if he were out on the field, the game would be different. 
Loud Mouth takes no prisoners. He hollers at the players, the coaches, the ball boys, the vendors, the officials, the trainers, the opposition, God and the women in short skirts, sparing no one and delet­ing no expletives. 
"OKAY YOU (expletive), IF YOU DON'T WIN THIS (expletive) GAME AGAINST THE (expletive) LAKERS, I WILL NEVER AGAIN BUY ANOTHER (expletive) GREEN AND WHITE STUFFED LARRY BIRD DOLL." 
If the game isn't close, Loud Mouth usually sits alone by the time the fourth quarter draws to an end. So he lets loose his wrath on all those he believes to be... 
A Fair Weather fan, who does not cheer for a team unless they've already got a lock on first place. He is more concerned with beating the traffic than beating the Yankees, the Celtics, the Islanders or the Cowboys. 
Theresa Kelly 
Assistant Sports Editor 

Fair Weather can't be anywhere but on the band­wagon, but doesn't realize that loyal fans have little toleration for him. Where do the Jets fans go when the Giants are winning? Where were the Giants' fans in 1987? Where are the Cardinal football fans now? When his team is in first, Fair Weather heads to the mall, buys a team T-shirt and is passionately behind the boys until they slump into second place. 
At the opposite end of the sports spectrum is the Born Loser. This poor type of fan (90 percent of which are Cub fans) denies that the team is bad, pronounces them to be underachievers, victims of bad timing and always says, "it's a game of inches." 
Born Loser is loyal, but sick. It could be next year, or next decade, whenever or never, Born Loser is eternally optimistic but always surprised when the team actually pulls out a victory. He is not surprised often. 
Born Loser is strong, having suffered so much, but weak to the perils of success. A pennant race or sudden death is usually too much for Born Loser to watch. 
The type of fan with the most rapidly growing population is Daddys' Girl. She was born on Super Bowl Sunday (another case of failed family plan­ning) and no one has forgiven her for that. She teethed on styrofoam cups still dripping with Bud­weiser and wailed at her brother when he switched from the NFL Today to Wild Kingdom reruns. She 
. is the son her father never had, even if she has a brother. Her friends play with Barbies, have tea parties and wear pink. She plays one-on-one, has Little League and wears Toughskins. She grows up and leaves home and still calls her father to get the scores and standings. She gets a job and spends her money on season tickets to everything. She gets funny looks when she scrambles with the eight-year olds for Ozzie Virgil's autograph, but she won't forget to get one for her son. Last, and least, we have the Stat Man, who is very trying, yet interesting to sit next to, at a game.
