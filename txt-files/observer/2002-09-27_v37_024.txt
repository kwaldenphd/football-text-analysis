Presence of women transformed the classroom, campus 
By JESSICA DALSING 
News Writer 
When the first freshman class containing women arrived on campus in 1972, Notre Dame's history changed forever. 
"The University may need some structural modifications and personnel additions to make it work smoothly, but fun­damentally the healthy integra­tion of women into Notre Dame depends on attitudinal adjust­ments," then-president Father Theodore Hesburgh wrote in a 1972 edition of the "Notre Dame Report." 
The presence of 325 women on campus posed a challenge to students and administration alike. Though the University established an advisory com­mittee for co-education to deal with the changes that might be required, there were few noticeable changes to curricu­lum or tradition. Not until the number of women dramatically increased in the years after 1972 did significant changes occur. 

Many of the changes made in the early years were subtle. Anne Therese Palmer, one of the first female students, said, "For the first few years profes­sors had to change their teach­ing style and anecdotes used in lectures." 
Most of the classes and cours­es remained the same but actions within them had to be altered with the entrance of tion changed when women women. Bradley Marcotte, a arrived on campus in 1972. member of the last all-male No long-term strategic plan freshman class, was made remembered for hiring

It seems that though Notre Dame has made a concerted effort to hire female faculty in recent years, but few have reached seniority. 
"Female faculty members have been making huge strides," Assistant Director of Gender Studies Sophie White said, "but not so many women have made it to senior posi­tions." 
Preacher also agrees with White's sentiments. "Women faculty members tend to go into administration instead of to senior teaching positions," she said.

Mellencamp slated to perform at JACC 
By MARIA SMITH 
News Writer 
Tickets for John Mellencamp's 
concert at the Notre Dame Joyce 
Center on November 8 go on 
sale today. 
John Mellencamp will be the latest in a series of famous musi­cians to perform in the JACC, which has hosted performers such as Billy Joel, Elton John, Bob Dylan and more recently groups such as Matchbox 20 and lJ2. 

The concert will be the fifth in Mellencamp's solo tour fea­turing songs from his latest a I b u m "Cuttin' Heads," released in October 2001. Mellencamp's latest perfor­mances have been a hit with fans. 
"I just saw Mellencamp at Farm Aid in Pittsburgh a week ago," said sopho­more Justin Halls. "It was Jan Vijayaraghavan. "I had no idea he was coming. I'll definite­ly be there, it'll be a good con­cert." 
Many student fans of John Mellencamp are excited. "We play a lot of '80s, and John Couger Mellencamp is at the top of the list," said seniors Matt LaFratta and Chris Huebner of the L Train and Factor Show on WVFI. "We're really excited 
Notre Dame could get him." 
The concert has special meaning for Notre Dame, s i n c e MeJlencamp was born and raised in Indiana. "He's a great home­town hero kind of guy," Halls said. "Midwestern guys can relate to small town life. He just stands for a lot of what America is about." 
Students who are less familiar with Mellencamp's music are still likely to rec­ognize some of his hits, especially

Mr. ND pageant marks third year 
By SAMANTHA RANERI News Writer 
Ten Notre Dame men compet­
ed for the glory title "Mr. ND" 
Thursday night in the LaFortune 
ballroom. The third annual 
Walsh Hall-sponsored event 
showcased tbe eclectic talents of 
the participants ranging from 
singing to reciting self-composed 
poetry. 
While ten dorms were repre­
sented in the contest, only repre­
sentatives from Knott, Dillon, 
Morrissey, Fisher and Keough 
made the cut for the third and 
final round. The competition 
was tight, but in the end Mr. 
Keough, Judah Wilson, was able 
to win over not only the crowd, 
but the judges as well. 
The night began as contes­tants strutted their stuff across the ballroom stage with their own Walsh Hall escort and a sin­gle flower. Hosted by freshman Walsh resident Summer Shea, the pageant marked the final event in Walsh's Wild Week, which concludes tomorrow night with their hall dance. 
In the first round of competi­tion, designed to reveal individ­ual personality, each contestant took to the stage and highlighted the significance of his attire. Wilson was able to achieve the look that he said embodied "refinement, elegance, and class," with an appropriately worn "ND" tie and outlet-mall shoes. His favorite element of his outfit was his glasses, which allowed for the apparel to be "easily convertible to the cunning intellectual look," that he sported so well. 
The second round began with the pageant's runner-up, Mr. Dillon, singing a crowd-pleasing rendition of "Part of that World" from Disney's "The Little Mermaid." His performance, complemented by interpretive dance movements, left its mark as a highlight of the night. 
Mr. Fisher was also able to stir up the crowd later in the round with a salute to music of the 1980s complete with dance moves and spandex. But it was the winner, Mr. Keough, who stuck with Frank Sinatra's time­honored "The Way You Look Tonight," impressing the ladies and earning enthusiastic applause. 

After the elimination of five contestants, the third round, or "Q & A" period, commenced with Mr. Knott contending that if he were no longer in the realm of humankind, he would like to per­sonify a star fruit, because they are "odd and unknown." 
After much anticipation, during which the final five contestants anxiously held hands, Wilson's triumph was announced. The sophomore transfer student was then awarded flowers and a crown, as well as a $40 gift cer­tificate to Best Buy. 

Of his first official pageant, Wilson said, " It was a great experience-so much fun. Everyone was friendly back­stage." He additionally revealed that the key to his success that evening was simply being well prepared. 
Finally, Wilson, who volun­teered to represent his dorm, said that he would like to, "Thank the guys of 2A, especially Q-Tip." Although a modest win­ner. the new Mr. ND disclosed that while he plans to continue participating in pageants, he is now going to travel to Disney World and promote world peace.

Protect America 

The 30th anniversary of co-education at Notre Dame is upon us, but I still have yet to see the special significance of the number 30. After all, this is, also, ifany­one is interested, the 160th anniver­sary of males at Joe Lindsley Notre Dame. But because of the supposed "gender Wire editor problems" at Notre Dame, I'll stop myself here immediately, before I unintentionally get myself into any sort of trouble. Therefore, I'll digress, and dis­cuss a different, albeit somewhat related topic: war. And this probably will get me into trouble. 
Our nation is currently involved in a great discussion over the nature and purpose of war, and good people all over the country have well-thought out and deeply held beliefs on what this nation should do with it~ military might. Some suggest that it would be immoral for our nation to use force in attacking those who we deem a threat to our national and global security. Two wrongs don't make a right, they argue. Turn the other cheek, they say. 
Certainly. from a Catholic perspective -especially here at Notre Dame -it is important to recognize that we should respect one another, and try our best to avoid \.iolent resolutions to problems. 
There is another aspect of the Catholic perspective that is too often ignored, though, and that is the failure to acknowledge that those to whom the gifts of liberty and prosperity have been given bear a serious obligation to the protect that precious possession. Taking care to ensure the continuation and respect of liberty serves not only to keep ourselves free, but also to inspire the world. 
Ifwe truly believe in the ideals of this nation, then protecting our way of life is truly selfless. We do not necessarily have to go around the world making sure everyone set~ up their own versions of Congress, but we do need to make sure that our government -that experiment in liberty -remains a beacon for the oppressed of the world. Ifwe value our liberty, we must protect it-at all costs. In economics they say that there is no such thing as a free lunch. Similarity, we cannot obtain liberty without cost. It comes at a price; oftentimes, that price is paid in blood. 
Ifwe do not cherish this gift, ifwe do not fight for its survival, then that flame in the hearts offreedom loving patriots could he doused by the waters of apathy and jealousy. Ifwe do not show the trou­ble-making nations of the world that we will not sit passively while our values our trodden upon, while our way of life is threatened, then we might as well wel­come invaders into our boarders today. If we do not care about safeguarding our liberty, that will be the inevitable result. 
There is no guarantee that America will lac;t forever -in fact, it is unlikely. If we like living here though, and if we have a real love for the freedoms which we enjoy -ifwe want others to be able to enjoy that -then we must defend it. For ifthe greatest bastion of this sacred liberty is ever conquered, then the world will be in a sad and nearly hopeless state.

ND Campus Wide Fair revamped 
By JASON McFARLEY and 


MARIA SMITH 
News Wrirers 

If performances by the Hawaii Club or the Bagpipe Band don't attract a crowd, then Zahm Hall residents smashing a car on North Quad might. 
The cultural diversity and creativity of Notre Dame stu­dents will be on full display Saturday at the second annual Notre Dame Campus Wide Fair. Featuring a variety of student organizations representing over 15 cultures, the Fair "is a great way to open up the year -just another way to celebrate ND," said Joyce De Leon, chair of the cultural division of the Club Coordination Council. 
Student planners of Saturday's Notre Dame Campus Wide Fair say the event improves upon last fall's multi­cultural fair by showcasing a greater variety of student clubs and interests. Organizers hope the revamped format will boost attendance past the 200 to 300 students who attended last year's fair. 
"We've asked more groups to perform and be part of the fair this year," DeLeon said. "It's not just a cultural fair this time." 
Students attending the Fair can expect a relaxed, entertain­ing and informative atmos­phere, Deleon said. "We really wanted to show that culture on campus isn't just something we talk about and learn about in the classroom. This is a chance to showcase everyone's talents and celebrate a sense of togeth­erness." 
The free event includes music, dance and food from 
1:30 p.m. to 5 p.m. on North Quad. Fairgoers can sample food from a dozen ethnic stu­dent clubs and watch perfor­mances by 17 groups. The fair includes special performances by the Bagpipe Band, Ballet Folklorico, Coro Primavera, Filipino-American Student Organization, First Class Steppers, Guitar Players Association, gymnastics team, Hawaii Club, Irish Dance Team, Porn Pon Squad, St. Edward's Hall Players and Voices of Faith. Performances begin at 2 p.m. 
Zahm Hall has planned a 
unique show, said Morgan Russell, co­chair of the cultural divi­sion in the Office of the Student Body President. Residents of the North Quad residence hall will take turns smashing an old car with baseball bats. 
"The idea 
behind the whole fair was to create a fun outdoor event that people can just stop by and have fun at," RusseJI said. "It's a good thing to go out and see it. It's an even better thing to walk away thinking about it." 
Organizers timed the fair around the football team's bye week this weekend, Deleon said. 
Deleon had originally planned the fair for last spring as a campaign goal on Brian Moscona and Keri 0xley's plat­form when the pair ran for stu­dent body president and vice president. After Libby Bishop and Trip Foley defeated them in the election, the new student leaders voiced support of the

fair even though it had been a Moscona-0xley idea, Deleon said. 
Notre Dame Student Government, the Office of Student Activities, Multicultural Student Programs and Services, Student Union Board and Campus Ministry sponsor the fair. 
Among the groups providing cultural music, dance and food at the fair will be FASO. The group plans to perform two tra­ditional dances and to serve free food prepared by the offi­
demonstrate how fun it can be to try something new, and I think that the Campus Fair will give a lot of groups that chance." 
"I'm really excited for the cultural clubs that don't get to do big events on campus," DeLeon said. "With the fair, they get a lot of exposure with­out having to spend a lot of their resources."

Tremendous strides have been made in all areas of the campus in the last 30 years, but as a letter sent to female alumni noted, "Women play a key role at Notre Dame as intellectual and campus lead­ers as well as in their capacity as teachers and students, but we still have much to do."

BOG debates Reading Day issue 
By SARAH NESTOR Saint Mary's News Editor 
Saint Mary's Board of Governance passed a new pro­posal to alleviate the 10-year push to have a study day built into the academic calendar. Written by Student Body President Kim Jensen and Student Body Vice President Elizabeth Jablonski-Diehl the "reading day" proposal was unanimously approved by BOG last Thursday. 
Since 1992 students began voicing their need for a study day by pursuing avenues in which a study day could be added to the schedule. Last year Jensen and Jablonski­Diehl took on the issue again by asking for students to par­ticipate in a study day survey and used the data to write the new reading day propos­al. 
"Past proposals have not been as comprehensive, with only a few paragraphs or suggestions," Jablonski-Diehl said. "People are impressed by this proposal and are telling us that we did do our 
Mary's students." "Most ofthose Friday's are used 
for review days and professors 
could still assign projects to be 
due or hold review sessions," 
Jablonski-Diehl said. "No matter 
what you use the day for it's going 
to help you prepare for finals." The next step that Jensen and 
Jablonski-Diehl are taking is to present the proposal to the faculty assembly for their approval. \Vhile they are not asking the faculty assembly to vote on the proposal, they would like to gain their sup­port. "I think the big concern of the faculty is how we are going to know if this is work­ing and their second concern is that it will be used as a party day, which is a cheap shot," Jablonski-Diehl said. "To them we go to class, go home and do homework, but that is not realistic with the level of student extracurricu­lar involvement on campus." Regardless of what the fac­ulty assembly decides the proposal will move on to the Academic Affairs committee to vote on the proposal.

Tropical Storm Isidore batters Gulf Coast 
Associated Press 
DEi .ACHOIX, La. 

Tropical Storm Isidore blew ashorn Thursday with near hur­ricarw force wfnd, spinning off tornadoes, swamping the Gulf Coast with 15 inches of rain and knocking out power to more than 200.000 homes and busi­1wsses. 
Thousands fled their homes in Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama before the storm reached land at 3 a. m. Floodwaters swept through houses in communities across the region and rose to the wind­shields of cars in low-lying Nevv Orleans. 
"I don't know whose they are, but I've got three rncliner chairs in my yard." Susan Serpas said in Delacroix, a fishing town east of New Orleans. where screen doors, mailboxes and furniture bobbed in 3 feet of water. 
Gov. Mike Foster said the storm did at least $18 million in damage in Louisiana, including $3.7 million in lost sugar cane. Foster said the damage estimate will grow, and he was seeking a foderal disaster declaration. 
Isidore was packing wind up to h5 mph when it arrived. bPlow tlw 74 mph thrnshold of a hurricane. The storm lost its punch and \\'as dO\vngradcd to a tropical d<'pression as it moved past Jackson, Miss., in late after­noon. 
Forecasters said the storm would slide into the Ohio Valley by the weekend, bringing heavy rain to the Midwest and the Nortlmast. Up to 8 inches of rain were forncast in Tennessee. 
Several tornadoes spun out of the storm and touched down in the Florida Panhandle. One hit a barn near Graceville, Fla., injur­ing a farmer, while another damaged more than 20 homes in Santa Hosa Beach. 
Mississippi officials also said floodwaters also kept them from reaching a 67-year-old man who died of cardiac arrest early Thursday. 
The wind toppled trees in Alabama and gusts of 40 mph hit Birmingham, more than 200 miles from the coast. Most schools in the region were closed. 
Mississippi kept its floating casinos shuttered. One, the Treasure Bay in Biloxi, sus­tained a 12-foot gash when the surging sc~a drove its entrance ramp deep into one of its walls. Backup security cables were the only thing keeping the casino barge from floating away. 
"This was totally unexpected, this much water," Bernard Carlson, 71. said as he watched the swollen Tchoutacabouffa Hiver from the upstairs porch of his flooded horrw near Biloxi.

ISRAEL 


Mohammed Deif, top Hamas bombmaker may be dead 
Associated Press 
GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip 
Israel tried to kill the> mastermind of the llamas bombing campaign Thursday, firing two missiles from a helicopter into a car in crowded Gaza City and killing two bodyguards. Thirty-fiv<~ bystanders Wf~re wounded but the fate of the Palestinian militant remained uncertain. 
A senior Palestinian security official said Israel's target, 37 year old Mohammed Deif, escaped with moder­ate injuries. Israeli police sources said the Israeli military told them Deif atop 
Israel's wanted list for years was killed. The military had no comment. 
llamas official Abdel Aziz Hantisi said Deif was not even in the car. But he said the group would avenge the attack nevertheless. "We will hit Tel Aviv. \'Ve will hit everywhere." 
Barnas and the Palestinian Authority are rivals, possibly explaining the dif­ferent versions of Deifs fate. 
In other violence, four Palestinians including two gunmen, a civilian and a baby and one Israeli were reported killed. Israel maintained its strangle­hold on Palestinian leader Vasser Arafat's headquarters in the West 
Bank town of Ramallah in defiance of Tuesday's U.N. Security Council reso­lution to end the siege. 
Two helicopters appeared in the sky over Gaza just after 1:30 p.m., firing missiles that blew apart a green Mercedes sedan and sent a plume of white smoke over the Sheik Radwan neighborhood. 
"Suddenly we heard the sound of a big explosion," said Mohammed Hajar, a hairdresser working in the area. "vVhen I ran out, a second explosion took place." 
Blood, body parts and shrapnel were strewn across a wide area and nearby 
windows were shattered. A large crowd, confused and angry, gathered as rescue workers led the wounded to ambulances. 
One man leapt on a car and shouted, "God is great." 
llamas sources identified the two dead men as members of Hamas, Abdel Rahim Hamdan, 27. and Issa Abu Ajra, 29. Rantisi said they were Deifs bodyguards. 
More than a dozen children were wounded in the attack, the latest in a series of assaults the Israeli military calls "targeted killings" of Palestinians.

Germany plans to drop tech stocks 
Associated Press 

FHANKFUHT 
Germany's stock exchange operator announced Thursday it will dump its tech-heavy Neuer Markt after a 2 1/2 ­year plunge that wiped out almost all the market's value and move companies to a more tightly regulated new listing system. 
Deutsche Boerse said that dissolution of the Neuer Markt -Germany's answer to Nasdaq -was aimed at reas­suring investors with clear, tough· rules on financial dis­closure. 
Neuer Markt-listed compa­nies, some of whom were con­sulted on the move, and stock analysts said they hoped the new structure would bring investors back. 
"We think this is absolutely positive," said Gudrun Geissler, head of·investor rela­tions at Neuer Markt-listed Pfeiffer Vacuum Technology AG, a maker of vacuum pumps and one of the segment's prof­itable companies. "For inter­national investors this will give a much clearer picture." 
Thomas Effler, head of small and mid-cap research at Commerzbank in Frankfurt, said the proof of the system would be in how effective the new rules were. 
"If they really make a clear structure. and can convince investors that these are the 
rules, and the hurdles are higher to get into the stock market and to stay in the mar­ket, then I think it can be suc­cessful," Effler said. 
The changes will close out an institution that gave Germany its ticket to the high­tech party when it opened in 1997. 
The exchange pumped bil­lions in to German software and Internet companies and helped stimulate the growth of venture capital in Germany by giving investors in privately held companies a place to cash in their gains when star­tups went public. And it spread pro-shareholder prac­tices such as publishing quar­terly earnings -a novelty for many German companies. 
But then it fell along with the tech fad. Its Nemax All­Share Index traded Thursday afternoon at 411, up 2 percent on the dav but down some 95 percent f;om its March 2000 peak of 8,140. 
The number of companies has fallen from 342 in June 2000 to 264 through delistings and bankruptcies. 
The Neuer Markt was also tarnished by scandals such as that of Comroad, a navigation­systems company that prose­cutors say faked most of its earnings in 1998-2000. The government, not Deutsche Boerse, is responsible for policing fraud -but the news didn't reassure investors. 


First ladies pledge to fight poverty 
Associated Press 

MEXICO CITY 
Laura Bush joined first ladies from across the Americas in a pledge to fight child poverty, recognizing the problem is not limited to poor, developing countries but also plagues rich ones like the United States. 
Promising to honor their roles as "promoters of change," the 22 spouses of heads of state ended a confer­ence in Mexico City on Thursday by signing a SO-point declaration. 
"Our mission is to encourage the creation and improvement of social programs that pro­mote effective. tangible bene­fits for children living in pover­ty," the statement says. 
The signatories pledge to work toward everything from equal access to education and healthy early childhood devel­opment to responsible sexual attitudes in children and the reintegration of street kids into mainstream society. 
Preventing domestic violence, encouraging children to have tolerance and respect, and eliminating discrimination against minority children are among other broad goals they set forth in the declaration. 
Given that most of the first ladies lack official clout in their governments, some experts and analysts have questioned just how much weight such a conference can carry. 
But the Declaration of Mexico notes that past meetings have allowed the women to "coordi­nate efforts aimed at address­ing social problems and strengthening our role as pro­moters of change, allowing us to make a considerable contri­bution" to eradicating disease, changing women's roles in society and improving health care services, among other advances. 
The first ladies, hailing from the Caribbean as well as North, South and Central America, promised to pursue their com­

mitments in informal follovv-up meetings and to review their progress at their 12th confer­ence, scheduled to take place in the Dominican Republic. 
"No matter what country we call home, no matter what cus­toms or faiths or cultures we embrace, one value transcends every border: All mothers and fathers throughout the world love their children and want the very best for them," Mrs. Bush said. 
"From the crib to the class­room, from the classroom to the workplace, our children deserve to realize their hopes and dreams." 
In the United States. the poverty rate for all children under 18 rose from 16.2 per­cent to 16.3 percent last year, while nearly a half of Mexico's 35 million children live in poverty. 
Mexican first lady Martha Sahagun de Fox said one of the conference's most important goals should be to strengthen cooperation between govern­ments and private organiza­
tions. 

"The government can't do everything and society can't do it alone," said Sahagun, reciting what became her mantra during meetings with her counterparts. The asser­tion is included as a clause in the Declaration of Mexico. 
Speaking at the conference in both Spanish and her native language of Nahuatl. 14-year-old Bernarda Temoxtle of Mexico's Veracruz state recounted how she used to sleep on the f1oor and hike long distances from 
her Indian village to her school. 
She praised a Mexican pro­gram tha.t provided her and others with better meals. beds to sleep in and an education through satellites and comput­ers. 
"I ask with all my heart that we unite and combat child poverty," she said, dressed in a traditional white blouse embroidered with brightly col­ored flowers. "We are the future of our world. and I imagine that one day in the future, when I am big, I can arrive at a position like you have."

Irish bank to sell Allfirst to M&T 
Associated Press 
BALTIMORE Allied Irish Banks PLC is selling its 
U.S. subsidiary. Alllirst Financial Inc., to M&T Bank Corp. for about $3.1 bil­lion in a deal that it said was first dis­cussed months before a currency trad­ing scandal surfaced at the division. 
The deal announced Thursday ends a seven-month effort by AIB officials to boost the reputation and market value of its Baltimore based unit. That's after an alleged $691 million fraud by its senior foreign-exchange dealer th<'re. John Husnak. 
AIB chief' executive Michael Buckley said the trading lossPs did not push the bank "farther or faster or any other particular way into this." 
"I mean, we had the broad outline of what might work sketched out well before that happened," Buckley said. 
AIB chief financial officer Gary Kennedy said negotiations with M&T began in October 2001, well before the currency scandal surfaced in February. 
Buckley said the deal was slowed down after the losses were discovered "simply because I was spending my time in dealing with those issues." 
Robert Wilmers, M&T's chairman. chief executive and president. said he considered currency-trading case "an isolat,~d incident." lie said the fact that Allfirst had a foreign exchange trading operation was "totally irrelevent to us." 
"\Ve were never inten!sted in their foreign exchange trading business," \Vilmers said. 
Wilmers said his bank has an active foreign exchange desk. "but just for the benefit of our customers. \Ve do not take positions." 
Rusnak was charged in June with seven counts of fraud. A Feb. 10 trial date has been set for Husnak. His attorney. David Irwin, has indicated the case might not reach trial. On Thursday, Irwin wouldn "t comment on how negotiations with prosecutors have been going.

Smallpox vaccine to combat bioterrorism 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON 
Moving aggressively to steel the nation against bioterrorism, the Bush administration is preparing to offer the effective but risky smallpox vaccine to every American before an attack ever occurs. 
The decision, which goes well beyond earlier thinking, stems from practical and philosophi­cal concerns including the looming war with Iraq and the fact that, for the first time in decades, the government will have enough vaccine on hand to inoculate everyone. 
Just three months ago, feder­al advisers were recommend­ing that only select hospital workers get the smallpox vac­cine, maybe 20,000 total. Now Bush administration officials say that eventually, it will be offered to all 280 million Americans. The questions being debated are how fast and under what circumstances, according to three officials involved in the planning. 
Experts don't know if the nation will ever be attacked with smallpox, which kills one­third of its victims. Eradicated from nature two decades ago, it is still feared as a bioterror agent. But the vaccine itself carries rare but serious risks, including death, complicating any decision to inoculate peo­ple absent a certain risk. 
The Bush administration has yet to make final decisions or announce plans for what is called "pre-attack" smallpox vaccination. But administration ollicials say the consensus is to begin vaccinating those at greatest risk of encountering a highly contagious smallpox patient, such as hospital emer­gency room workers. That could total a half million peo­ple. Then the vaccine would be offered to non-hospital health workers, such as primary care doctors, and to police. firefight­ers and other emergency work­ers. 
At some point after that, it would be offered to the general public. 
"You start with one group and based on their potential risk, you keep expanding," one administration official said Thursday, speaking on condi­tion of anonymity. 
But it hasn't been decided how many people will get vac­cinated during the first wave of shots, or how long it will take to offer them to everyone. 
At issue, officials say, are important details such as who should get the vaccine while it's still an experimental drug, which requires a lengthy pro­cedure to ensure that people understand and accept the risks. One option is to wait until the vaccine is fully licensed by the Food and Drug Administration before offering the vaccine widely. which could take a couple of years. 
Another unanswered ques­tion is liability -how to com­pensate people injured by the experimental vaccine. 
Made from a live virus, the vaccine itself is risky, particu­larly for people with certain skin diseases and weak immune svstcms. Studies from the 1960s· suggnst orrn or two people pt>r million inoculated will die. About one in 1,000 will face complications, some seri­ous, including a severe skin rash or encephalitis that may kill or cause permanent neuro­logical damage. 

Other issues are logistical, such as how states and cities prepare large vaccination clin­ics and train people to give the shots. Another point: how to deal with people who get sick from the vaccine and the pub­licity likely to surround such an incident. 
Those questions get more complicated as the number of people vaccinated increases. 
No matter how these ques­tions are resolved, the adminis­tration's direction represents a remarkable shift in thinking in a very short time, say experts both in and out of government. The reasons, they say, are practical, political and philo­sophical. 
Immediately after last fall's anthrax attacks concentrated attention on bioterrorism, mass vaccinations were not consid­ered because there wasn't enough vaccine: only 15.4 mil­lion doses in storage with another 40 million on order. 
Since then, researchers have determined that by diluting the 
15.4 million doses, 75 million people can be inoculated. A drug company found another 86 million doses in its freezer and donated them to the gov­ernment. And the Department of Health and Human Services signed or expanded contracts for 209 million new doses, which should arrive early next year. 
The new shipments bring a natural pressure to offer the vaccine. Newspaper editorials and leading voices, including Sen. Bill Frist, R-Tenn., a physician, have argued that people should be allowed to weigh the risks and decide for themselves whether to be vac­cinated. 
"What if you do have an attack and people die and you had something you could have given them, how do you answer that?" a second administration official said. 
On top of that looms possible war with Iraq. All smallpox was supposed to be destroyed except for samples kept in spe­cial labs in Atlanta and Moscow, but experts fear that hostile states including Iraq have it. 
"We're very worried about lraq,"said Dr. D.A. Henderson, a top I IIIS bioterrorism adviser. "Why is Saddam Hussein push­ing ahead with weapons of mass destruction if at some point he is not going to ust~ them? It's certainly got to be a factor in all of this." 
Another factor: Officials are realizing how complicated it will be t<> vaccinate large num­bers of people quickly after a smallpox attack. This week, federal officials gave states guidelines for mass vaccina­tions after an attack; most cities arc far from ready. 
If there were an attack, mass vaccinations would be signifi­cantly easier if many people arc already protected. Some argue aggressive vaccinations might even deter an attack. 
A decision had been expected by the end of September, but officials now say it's not expect­ed until next month. 

Quechan run to protect ancient sites 
Associated Press 

For centuries, young American Indians have run a series of trails that stretch from the muddy red waters of the Colorado Hiver to the Arizona­California line. 
Running the trail has been at the center of the Quechan Nation's religion, traditions and history. Now 30 young men are running to try to save the paths for the next generation. 
The runners are making a 700-mile relay trek through California to focus attention on state legislation that seeks to protect ancient sites like the one they hope to safeguard from becoming a gold mine. 
The group wants Gov. Gray Davis to sign a bill that would require local governments to notify a tribe of proposed con­struction within 20 miles of a reservation and to protect sacred sites from development. 
Opponents of the bill said it could grant tribes veto power over both private and public land. The California Chamber of Commerce said the bill threat­ens to delay or stop public improvement projects, school buildings and new homes. 
Davis, who has until month's end to sign or veto the bill, has not publicly taken a position. 
"This is not only for politics," said 15-year-old runner Richard "Ticky" Smith, a Quechan tribal member who has sweated through triple-digit temperatures in California's Central Valley this week. "It's for all the elders -the ones that passed on, the ones who are sick, the ones who can't run or walk or hear or sec. It's also for the future." 
The run began last Friday in Sacramento, Calif., and is expected to end Saturday at the tribe's Imperial Valley reserva­tion. The proposed mine site ­at Indian Pass, a remote spot near the Arizona-California line -sits on federal land outside their reservation. 
Lillian Sparks, an analyst for the National Congress of American Indians, said no state has enacted legislation similar to the bill before the governor. 
"California is really taking ini­tiative to protect Native American sacred places, and we're hoping other states will follow through until we can get protection at the federal level," said Sparks. 
Across California, about 300 sites that average a quarter­acre each need protection, according to the Native American Heritage Commission. 
Under the legislation, a local government would hire an out­side investigator such as an anthropologist to check histori­cal records and determine whether a site has long been considered sacred. The investi­gator also would look at whether the area has a shrine or other religious artifacts. 
The bill stems from Quechan opposition to plans by Glamis Gold Ltd., a Reno, Nev.-based company that wants to build an open pit gold mine on 1,600 acres of BLM land near the tribe's reservation. The Bureau of Land Management parcel includes a site of religious cere­monies that contains ancient pottery shards and petroglyphs. 
Charles Jeannes, senior vice president of Glamis, said the proposed state bill could ruin the company's efforts to create an operation on which it already has spent $15 million. 
Jeannes said the bill now on Davis' desk would hamper development statewide by only allowing construction of pro­jects on sacred sites that have an overriding environmental, public health or safety reason. 
"It's a fairly narrow exception and it gives the native tribe any right to veto any project they deem sacred," he said. 
The Clinton administration rejected the gold mine plan, cit­ing "undue impairment"to Quechan sacred land, but thP Bush administration rescinded that ruling in October 2001. 
Quechan presidfrnt Miki! Jackson said the issue is about continuing a tradition for his 3,000 tribal members. 
"We want to preserve our his­tory just like any other person," he said. "We should enjoy our religious rights like anybody else."

Study outlines risks of Ecstasy 
Associaced Press 
WASJIINGTON 
Partying with Ecstasy sever­al times a night, a common practice among users of the illegal drug, may damage key neurons in the brain and per­haps hasten the onset of Parkinson's disease, according to a study in monkeys. 
But some researchers were skeptical that the results from the animal studies translate to humans and said such studies discourage research that might lead to medical uses for Ecstasy. 
A Johns Hopkins University researcher injected squirrel monkeys and baboons with three shots of Ecstasy, also known as MOMA, three hours apart, mimicking dosages "often used by MDMA users at all-night dance parties." He said the drug caused enduring damage to dopamine-produc­ing neurons in the brains of the animals. 
The damage was still evident two weeks to six weeks later. said Dr. George A. Ricaurte, the lead author the study appearing this week in the journal Science. But he said it is not clear if the dam aged neurons will repair them­selves, a key factor in whether Ecstasy could cause Parkinson's disease. 
Parkinson's disease is a brain disorder triggered by the permanent loss of dopamine-producing nerve cells. 
"We aln~ady know from tlrn literature that brain dopamine declines with age," he said. "A young individual who sustains injury to thest\ dopamine cells and depletes their reserve may be at greater risk of Parkinsonism." 
But Julie A. Holland, a psy­chiatrist on the faculty of the New York University School of Medicine, said carfier studies on humans have failed to show that Ecstasy causes per­m anent damage to dopamine neurons. 

"It is a big leap to f1xtrapo­late what he is seeing in these primates and what you expect to S<!C in Parkinson's syn­drome," Holland, the author of a book on the risk and rncre­ational use of Ecstasy. 
She said Hicaurte's research has helped "demonize" Ecstasy and prevented studies to determine if the drug could be used to treat post traumat­ic syndrome. 
Dr. Alan I. Leshner, former head of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, however, said the Hicaurte study shows "that even an occasional use of Ecstasy can lead to significant damage to brain systems." 
Stephen Kish, a University of Toronto researcher studying Parkinson's disease and Ecstasy. said he analyzed the brain of a deceased habitual Ecstasy user two years ago and found no evidence of dopamine neuron damage. 
"Hicaurte's findings do raise a concern that Ecstasy may damage the dopamine neurons and potentially cause Parkinson's," said Kish. But he said the current study "might not translate to humans" and has not proven a clear connection between the drug and the brain disease. 
In the study, the animals wern given six milligrams for every 2.2 pounds of their wt1ight. One of five monkeys and one of five baboons used in the study died shortly after receiving the shots. 
The brains of the surviving animals were examined microscopically and ch(~mical­ly after two to eight weeks. 
The nerve endings where the dopamine is processed \Vere destroyed, said Hicaurte. 
"There hasn't been a single animal that escaped the dopa.mine [cell] lesions," he said. 
Hicaurte said the damag<1 was not enough to cause Parkinson's symptoms, but there is "a clinical concern" that repeated use of Ecstasy will diminish the natural rnserve of' brain cells and lead to early disease. 
Holland said Hicaurte 's study in monkeys and baboons does not relate to the experi­ence of human recreational users of Ecstasy. 
"The dose that he gave killed 20 percent of the ani­mals immediately," said Holland. "Clearly these ani­mals reacted to the drug dif­ferently than humans because not one out of five Ecstasy users drops dead." 
Also, she said Hicaurte's study injected Ecstasy, while most human users take the drug orally. Drugs taken orally are less concentrated in the body than drugs that are injected, said Holland. 
The NYLJ psychiatrist said "there is a lot of politics involved" in Hicaurte's study because the government does not want to allow medical research with Ecstasy, even though it has been approved for study by the Food and Drug Administration. 
RicaurtP's research has been funded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse, the agency Leshner once headed. Leshner is now chief executive 
o ffi c e r of the Am erican Association for the Advancement of Science, the organization that publishes Science, the journal printing Hicaurte's current study on Ecstasy. 

House limits use of malpractice suits 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON 

The Ilouse, responding to doc­tors' complaints that rising insurance premiums are forcing them to quit their practices or relocate, passed a hill Thursday to cap pain-and-suffering dam·­ages that juries can award in malpractice suits. 
The 217-203 vote came after a lengthy debate over whether limiting large jury verdicts would ease the costly insurance crunch felt by doctors and patients. Its passage faced an uncertain future in the Democrat-controlled Senate, which already has rejected a similar measure. 
"Our nation is galloping toward a health care crisis of dimensions we have never faced before," said Hep. Nancy Johnson, R-Conn. "There are whole states where a woman cannot find an obstetrician that will take a high-risk pregnancy." 
"Very quietly. access to sophisticated high-risk care is declining in America." she added. 
Democrats questioned whether the bill would simply be a cash cow for insurers after Republicans rejected Democratic attempts to require that savings be used to lower malpractice insurance premi­ums. 
"They are going to allow the insurance industry to pocket this money," said Hep. Edward Markey, D-Mass. "That's what it's all about. It's about the insurance companies, not about physicians." 
But Republicans were buoyed by support from the White House, business groups, insur­ers and hundreds of physicians. 
"This is the moment of truth," said Dr. Donald Palmisano, president-elect of the American Medical Association. "Without reforms, patients, trauma cen­ters, maternity wards and physi­cians are all at the mercv of an out-of-control liability system." 
The House legislation would limit noneconomic damages, such as pa.in and suffering, to $250,000. Punitive damages would be limited to twice the amount of economic damages awarded or $250,000, whichev­er is greater. 
Patients' ability to file lawsuits over old cases would be limited under the legislation, which would also curtail lawyers' fees. 
In tackling the issue, the House waded into a debate that is already taking place in dozens of states. Nevada Gov. Kenny Guinn, a Republican, recently signed into law a bill that caps pain-and-suffering awards, and Mississippi legislators have been in a special session for weeks trying to craft a. bill. 
For doctors, the relief is sorely needed, supporters said. 
"There definitely has to be a cap," said Dr. Khadra Osman, a gynecologist in Ft. Lauderdale, Fla. who recently had to drop her obstetrics practicr, after see­ing her yearly malpractice insurance rate go from $32,000 in 2000 to $74,000 in 2002. "I cried with every single patient of mine who was pregnant." 
Dr. Hobert Comnau, a Las Vegas obstetrician, understands. lie rf~cently bogan scaling back his practice because his insurer is going out of business and he envisions trouble getting afford­able insuranc,i. Already, he has gottun, estimates of up to $100,000 for malpractice insur­ance. 

South Africa to set AIDS vaccine trials

CAPE TOWN 
South African scientists said Thursday they will begin manu­facturing, and testing on humans. three new vaccirrns intendPd to protm:t against the AIDS virus. 
Thf' vaccines showed great potential in laboratory tests on micP and primates, said Anna-1.ise Williamson. associate pro­fossor at tlw University of Cape Tmvn's lnstitutn of lnfoctious Diseases and Molecular Medicine. 
Small-scale human trials could begin as early as next year, said Dr. Tim Tucker, director of the South African AIDS Vaccine Initiative. 
UNAlDS, the United Nations ag1~ncy on AIDS. last year esti­mah1d that 40 million peopln worldwide wern HIV positive and the development of a vac­cine \\'as considered imperative to stop the epidPmic.'s sprnad.

ITALY 


Assisi celebrates fresco restoration 
Associared Press 
ASSISI 
St. Jeromp's white beard is 

largely gone, his rich cloak 
looks like it was devoured by 
moths and the roll of writing 
paper on his desk has disap­
pearnd. 
But in a kind of restoration miracle. much of the rest of the Giotto fresco is back on the soaring ceiling of St. Francis Basilica. five years after an earthquake sent the master­piece crashing to the floor in tens of thousands of frag­ments. 
Lik<' a giant puzzle knocked apart by an angry child, the fresco was painstakingly piecPd back tog11ther by a team of restorers. who celebrated th11ir achiPv1~mcnt Thursday as this town marked thP fifth anniversary of a pair of power­ful quakes hours apart that clainwd l O lives and destroyed homes and artwork across Umbria in central Italy. 
Tlw race to save the fresco. which experts believe was painted by Giotto at the end of the 13th century. began almost immediately after a huge chunk of the basilica's nave foll a distance of seven stories in thP earthquake, burying t\vo Franciscan monks and two workPrs in a mound of dust, plaster and bricks on Sept. 26, 
1997. 
After tht~ bodies were pulled out, volunt,~ers and restoration experts, who slept in a tent camp with some of the thou­sands left homeless in the quake. started sifting through some 50,000 fragments of the fresco of St. Jerome and pieces of lesser-known fn~scoes of eight other saints. 
We are bring 

They tried to match pieces to 
an enlarged photograph of the 
original St. Jerome work and 
carefully laid unmatched 
pieces on cushions of foam in 
crates and drawers. 
"Days would pass when peo­
ple would find nothing, or 
maybe just a little piece," 
recalled one of the chief 
restorers, Paola Passalacqua. 
"Then suddenly we would 
n~member seeing a certain 
piece in a certain drawer that 
matched. It was a work of 
memory." 

Part of the ceiling above the altar also came crashing down in the second of the quakes, including another priceless masterpiece, a fresco by Cimabue, who is considered the father of Italian painting. 
Restoration work on some 120,000 fragments of Cimabue's St. Matthew will begin in a few months, aided by a computer that will try to find matches between the pieces and a photograph of the masterpiece. Fragments of the Cimabue now fill 880 drawers in a cloister of the Franciscan basilica's convent. 
A computer might also have helped with the Giotto fresco, but right after the quake there was no time to tailor programs to the enterprise, said Passalacqua. 
"The computer will do what we do, looking into one's mem­ory, only we do it much more slowly."said the restorer. 
In the weeks after the quake, the art world debated if the wrecked frescoes should be mounted in a museum if not enough pieces were found to be put back on the ceiling. 
A fow months after the quake, c;iuseppe Basile, the 
restorer overseeing the fresco 
project, said that if mainly blue 
sky and little human figures 
were found, restorers would 
not be able to put the work 
back on the ceiling. 
But piece by piece, a lot of the puzzle started to be filled in: St. Clare's nose in a cycle of Giotto-school frescoes depict­ing a row of saints; St. Jerome's book, his two-peaked hat, his penetrating eyes and reed-thin nose, some of his burgundy-colored cloak and a few wisps of his wavy beard. 
The Rev. Enzo Fortunato gazed up Wednesday at St. Jerome and the other eight saints near the entrance and said: "When we could see the face of St. Rufino, his eyes, beard, a cheek, then real hope began for us"that the restora­tion would succeed. 
At a kind of thanksgiving ceremony Thursday, the Franciscan custodian of the basilica complex, the Rev. Vincenzo Coli, told the restor­ers who will work on the Cimabue: "We're faithfully waiting for another miracle of faith and of the capabilities of man." 
The upper level of the two­tiered basilica, where the fres­coes are located, was reopened to the public in 1999. 
"When pilgrims come in, they point to where the Cimabue fresco was and say, 'That's where the quake dam­age was,"'Fortunato said. 
Visitors don't realize the St. Jerome fresco also was quake­dam aged, its missing details taken for a casualty of passing centuries and not the tem­blors, a true indication, Fortunato said, of the restora­tion's success.

IVORY COAST 



Americans evacuated from Ivory Coast 
Associated Press 
YAMOUSSOUKRO 

American schoolchildren flew 
to safety Thursday on the first 
evacuation plane out of rebel­
lion-torn Ivory Coast. while 
French troops launched a full­
scale evacuation of frightened 
Westerners from a rebel-held 
city under threat of imminent 
government attack. 
A U.S. C-130 carried the first 
18 evacuees -students age 8 to 
18 from a mission boarding 
school and staff, most of them 
American -to an airport in 
neighboring Ghana, where U.S. 
Embassy workers whisked them 
away to rest and start arranging 
reunions with families. 
Smiling broadly, the rescued 
American teens and younger 
children clutched water bottles 
as they crossed the tarmac tot­
ing bags of their belongings. 
U.S. forces armed with assault rifles had flanked the children's military cargo plane when it left Ivory Coast -ending a week that saw teachers and children pinned down by rebel fire that at times came over the walls of their whitewashed mission boarding school on the edge of the besieged city of Bouake. 
"We were hunkered down for seven days waiting for help ­then the French came," said Mike Coustineau, security chief for the U.S.-allied International Christian Academy. "We were very delighted to see them." 
The first flight out came as U.S., French and British forces scrambled to bring all their nationals out of Bouake, a cen­tral city of 500,000 people that has been held by rebels since a failed Sept. 19 coup attempt. 
In Washington, the State Department advised Americans on Thursday to leave the rebel­lion-torn country and autho­rized the families of American diplomats and those whose jobs are not essential to leave at U.S. government expense. 
As the evacuation got under way, Ivory Coast Defense Minister Lida Moise Kouassi took to state TV to declare Bouake and one other rebel-
held city "war zones." He said 
attack was imminent. 
"The national forces of Ivory 
Coast will be called upon to do 
their duty," Kouassi declared. 
Troops from France -the 
once-stable nation's colonial 
ruler -hammered out a cease­
fire with rebels for the evacua­
tion and rushed to clear the city 
of all who wished to go. 
Hundreds of armed French 
troops in jeeps and at least one 
light tank secured the main 
roads out of Bouake. 
Anxious evacuees lined the 
roads in cars, rolling out in con­
voys when the word to move out 
came. 

Thousands of the Bouake's 
people fled on foot, walking the 
sides of the roads with bundles 
of belongings or cooking pots on 
their heads. 
Rebels in camouflage uni­
forms manned checkpoints in 
and out the city. Shattered glass 
and other wreckage by some of 
the checkpoints testified to 
recent fighting. 
Government troops secured the 40 mile route to a hastily erected reception center at the Ivory Coast capital. Yamoussoukro. French and U.S. forces and diplomats of several European countries and Japan waited there to take in and process their nationals. 
Refugees, streaming to the safe haven in cars crammed with suitcases and children, spoke of a week pinned down by gunfire. with water and electric­ity out and food running short. 
"It was the isolation, and thinking every night there could be an attack," Jamal Bittar, a French evacuee of Lebanese descent, among the first convoys of evacuees arriving in cars crammed with suitcases and children. 
"It's sad for the locals. They're not going to be able to leave," Bittar said. "We will pray for them." 
On the day the firing was worst, Frenchwoman Catherine Martin said, she retreated with her husband to a room with no windows, and brought in mat­tresses to avoid any flying bul­lets.

Dissidence is a form ofpatriotism 
LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 

Biblical teaching on homosexuality stands 
I don't hate gays -never have. never will. I have no fear of a gay man hitting on me. Some of my friends are gay, some of my family are gay, and I still talk to them. However, in no way does that mean I agree with or accept homosexuality. 
Joe Muto's attempt to disprove Biblical teaching on homosex­uality in his Sept. 25 column is neither correct nor convincing. He failed to take into account that some teachings are stronger and more binding than others. 
The two teachings in Leviticus that Muto cited are inherently different. It is considerably worse to "lie with another man" than to wear a garment wove with more than one fabric. Also, the infamous "garment argument" doesn't hold sway with any Christian. 
Christ ca.me to fulfill the Old Covenant. In doing so, the uni­versal teachings were kept and expounded upon while those which were temporal, those not necessary in the New Jerusalt~m. passed away. Jesus himself said not to "hold fast to the traditions of men" (Mark 7:8). The garment is such a tradi­tion. 
Ilomosflxuality. on the other hand. is not. If it were, wouldn't the Apostles have known this? Yet they spoke just as firmly against homosexuality as Leviticus, if not more so. 
St. Paul condemns homosexual acts as sinful in Romans 1 :26­
32. He does so twice more in 1 Timothy 1 :10 and 1 Corinthians 6:9, whPre he equates homosexuality with theft, kidnapping, murder, greed, fratricide, lying and lawlessness. These are St. Paul's words. not mine. It's quite obvious that Biblical condem­nation is not even remotely limited to Leviticus. 
Muto does make a good point about not dwelling on "the sex­ual relations of people you've never met." Truth be told, I nor­mally don't give them a second thought, but some things must be responded to. After all, Jesus did tell us, "Go and make dis­ciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that l have commanded you." God didn't drop the ball on this one: He took it to the basket. 

On Ttwsday. conservative radio enter­tainer Rush Limbaugh hurled a trash can in reaction to a speech by former Vice President Al Gore. 
Gore had cautioned against rushing after Iraq's 
Saddam llussein at the Pxpense of combating terror­ists worldwide. Limbaugh claimed he was so ill, he almost did not climb out of bed 

to work his show.  
Nice drama,  Gary Caruso  
Hush. vVhile he  
may entertain  
millions with his  Capitol  
conservative idP­ Comments  
ology. he offers  
little to an honest,  

intellectual debate over staging a war with Iraq. Limbaugh makes millions of other Americans, including this writer, ill with his babble. If liberals, moder­ates and Democrats stooped to Limbaugh's level of "truth," long ago we would hav<\ begun a holy war against tlrn current president like Limbaugh did on day one of the Clinton presidency. 
Yet us "non-conservatives" arc not questioning President Bush's efforts to light Osama bin Laden. \Ve know when to act as the loyal opposition, unlike anti-Clinton fanatics who claimed in 1998 that Clinton was "wagging the dog" to divert attention from impeach­ment proceedings. Ironically, Limbaugh and his fanatics prevented Clinton from seriously retaliating against bin Laden. 

Ile mocks C1inton's veracity for mere­ly firing missiles at bin Laden while Republicans waged their 1998 impeachment war. 
If Limbaugh served in Vietnam, regardless of where his military assign­ment may have been. he would have credibility for his opinions regarding war. Al Gore is a Vietnam veteran. 
If Limbaugh was an elected official who bucked his party to support the other party's prnsidential efforts in the Gulf \Var, he would have credibility when he comments on the methods and timing of Bush's war against Iraq. Al Gore was one of only a few Democratic 
U.S. senators who crossed over the isle to vote in a nonpartisan manner with Republicans to support Daddy Bush's Gulf War resolution. 
If Limbaugh would pull his head out of his ideological bag, he might lose rat­ings points at the expense of gaining respect points. Despite Limbaugh's antics and jovial entertaining perspec­tive, he is dead wrong whenever he attempts to tackle a serious issue. 
Al Gore, the Vietnam veteran with a record of supporting the Gulf War, points out that this president has squandered the worldwide good will the United States gained after the Sept. 11 attacks with his insistence on fighting unilaterally if necessary. Gore notes that an immediate war with Iraq will dilute our anti-terror efforts, especially if we cannot provide compelling evi­
dence of Iraq's immediate threat and 
the international community does not join us through the United Nations. 
Gore, like conservative House Republican Minority Leader Dick Armey (R-Tex.), has shown great political lead­ership and courage in speaking out in opposition to a first strike against Iraq when others have remained mute. 
Despite the White House's usual per­sonal and nasty characterization of Gore, saying that he was "irrelevant," Gore and Armey have struck a chord with many. Both have articulated a position for those of us who, for what­ever moral, diplomatic or logistical rea­sons, do not believe it is wise to attack Iraq at this time. 
The president has already done much harm to our diplomatic relations abroad. 
By accusing the United Nations of being irrelevant for not adequately enforcing 16 resolutions pertaining to Iraq, Bush has allowed our allies and foes to laugh at the United States for our refusal to pay U.N. dues. 
They point at our hypocrisy by citing our recent Security Council abstention, the only non-affirmative vote, condemn­ing Israel's current attacks in Gaza. 
They in fact remind us that more than 100 U.N. resolutions condemning and sanctioning Israel have also not been enforced because the United States wants inaction. 
The White House will do much domestic harm if it continues to portray the war with Iraq on patriotic terms. During the Vietnam War, my genera­tion's patriotism was impugned by Richard Nixon and the great silent majority. The Reagan campaign in 1980 portrayed Republicans as flag-draped patriots implying that the Navy veteran Jimmy Carter was less of an American merely because he was unable to man­age the economy and settle the Iranian hostage crisis. 
Al Gore, this writer, Democrats, mod­erates, independents and liberals have joined our president in response to the terror attacks upon our fellow citizens and society. The president's natural constituency of conservatives, including wind bag Rush, need to realize that we are as much Americans, as much patri­ots as anyone. 
If we choose to exercise our freedoms by questioning or even opposing the president's policies, we are patriots. 
It is time that the intolerant who think they know everything realize that we are not living a John Wayne movie. At stake are American lives and long­lasting consequences after a war with Iraq.

Why is that? Did any of these people stop to think if they really wanted to be that doctor, lawyer or Fortune 500 businessperson? Too many of us live the life set out before us on a sliver platter. But is the silver platter really what we want?

Carla and Paul plan a heist in the dark romantic thriller "Read My Lips." The French film is this playing this week at Vickers Theatre In Three Oaks, Mich.

Hollywood has been lying to you: There are more movies released each year than most people know about. While big-budget studio pictures are distributed nationally to major movie houses almost uniformly, there are hundreds of independent or smaller studio releases that have spotti­er runs. In fact, the art house movie scene has been remarkably productive in the last decade, producing much of the country's best cinema. 
But in a world of corporate-dominated multiplexes, many of these movies, despite critical acclaim, never come to a theater near you. Luckily, the small town movie the­ater is long from extinct. Art movie houses across the country continue to play quality movies against most odds. The only problem is finding a hip theater. 
Luckily, Michiana has its own art house theater in Three Oaks, Mich.: Vickers Theatre. The restored turn of the cen­tury movie theater is a breath of breath fresh air for movie buff..i; who live in a cinematic world dominated by the ever­important male 15-25 year-old demographic in which Hollywood seems to be trying to think of as many ways as possible to justify Freddie Prince Jr. falling in love with the unlikely high school nerd who just happt=ms to be a super­model underneath all her unnecessarily baggy and dis­tastefully arranged clothes. 
The building in which the theater is located was built in the 1890s to serve as a livery for the nearby train station. The livery was transformed into an early movie theater by a group of investors lead by a man named Frank Lee. Though 1911 is early in the history of movie-only theaters,

especially in the Midwest, the theater was actually only one of three located in Three Oaks. 
The Lee family owned and operated the theater until 1978 when they sold it. The building changed hands a number of times throughout the '80s, operating sometimes as a mainstream movie house and at others as office space or even apartments. Facing tough competitions from modern multiplexes, the theater finally closed in 1987. 
Around the time the theater closed, Jon Vickers moved back to the area in which he grew up with his wife Jennifer. Vickers, a civil engineer by trade, thought that the building could be restored to its former glory that he remembered from his childhood. 

"We knew a woman that owned the building at the time. I think something just struck [Jon] and he said, 'Why not? Let's created a theater here.' And I was all for it. I think if we had stopped and thought about the difficulty of opening a theater in Three Oaks, we may have not done it," Jennifer Vickers said. 
The Vickers re-opened the 120-seat theater in 1996. They had spent the last two years renovating the inside. 
Originally, the theater was meant to present all different types of art including live theatre and music. The Vickers soon discovered, however, that the plan may have been overly ambitious and have gone to an almost strictly cinema format. The theatre does, however, double and an art gallery for Midwestern artists and crafh,people. 
"When we first opened, our goal was to be a well-rounded center for the arts, offering film, music and theatre.... We've kind of flowed into the film and artwork side of things. Once in a while, we'll have live music." Vickers said. 
Currently, the theatre is featuring the furniture of South Bend craftsman Larry Szymanski. Szymanski works primarily as and educator and repro­duces antique furniture as an amateur artist. 
Now in its seventh sea­son, Vickers' Theater is doing well, and business is getting better each year. 
"Obviously, overhead on a single-screen theater is different than on a 14­screen. The business is doing fine now, but we really get more enjoyment out of the pm)ple here than the theater being prosper­ous monetarily," Vickers said. 
The theater mostly culls its audience from northern Indiana, though a there are a number of local regu­1ars. A core audience group that is devoted to the theater's rare charm most­1y supports it. Vickers' and Joe Pobocik, to fill 
out their staff. 
The Vickers like presenting an offbeat selection of film; they follow movie openings in Chicago and New York as well as read trade magazines to decide their feature sched­ule. The theater's patrons themselves request a number of the features. 
Running the theater is a labor of love for the cou­ple, who balance their duties at the box office with Jon's civil engineer­ing practice and raising their three children: Max, Frank and Ava.

MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL 



A's top Seattle, clinch West 
Associated Press 
SEATTLE 
Tlw Oakland Athletics wPrn 
all smil1~s. high-fives and hand­
shakes on tlw infield grass al 
Safeco Field. Thon it was party 
time inside the visitors club­
house. 
Miguel Tejada tied the game with a ninth-inning homer and Scott llatteberg hit a two-out, two-run double in the 10th as Oakland beat the Seattle Mariners 5-:3. clinching the Amerir.an League \Vest champi­onship for the second time in three yPars. 
"This group of guys is so fami­ly-like," HattebPrg said. "It makes it swcnter and it helps us. We are reallv excited." 
Oakland, whii~h had failed to hold eighth-inning leads against Seattle the previous two days, opens the AL playoffs at home Tuesday against Minnesota. The A's arn a half-game behind the New York Yankees, who play Anaheim in the first round. for home-field advantage through­out the playoffs. 
The A's wore championship T-shirts over their uniforms and donned "2002 AL West champi­cms" hats in a clubhouse cele­bration that lasted 40 minutes. David Justice danced for cam­eras, and manager Art Howe was doused several times with champagne, beer and Gatorade. 
"We can kick back. enjoy it for a while and start to work hard again tomorrow,· said 

Billy Koch (11-4). who pitched two innings for the victory. "I don't kno"· about any urgrmcy, but \\'f} just wanted to get it done, win, and wrap up the West. It foels good to get it out of the way." 
Arter Hatteberg's hit off Shigetoshi Hasegawa (8-3) put Oakland ahead 4-2. Tejada had a run-scoring single. Tejada, who went 4-f'or-5, had tied the score with a one-out solo homer in the ninth off Kazuhiro Sasaki, who blew a save for the eighth time in 45 chances. 
"There weren't many guys hitting good against Sasaki," Tejada said. "I was happy I got a hit against him in that situa­tion. The only thing I said was, 'I want to be on base.' ... I didn't think the ball would get out. I didn't think I hit it that hard." 
Tejada has a .306 batting average, 201 hits, 32 homers and 127 HBI, making him a strong candidate to become the AL's Most Valuable Player. 
"It topped off a fantastic year for him," Howe said. "What can I say? I le played every single inning for us. Every time we needed him, he stepped up and came through. He just had a phenomenal season." 
It was subdued in the Mariners clubhouse. 
"We were hoping they would do their celebrating somewhere else," Seattle manager Lou Piniella said.

last year before losing to the 
Yankees in the AL champi­
onship series, was eliminated 
from postseason contention 
about 15 minutes before the 
start of the game Thursday 
when Anaheim beat Texas 10-5. 
"It wasn't as fun as it could 
have been," said Bret Boone, 
who hit his 24th homer in the 
fourth. "It was a longshot any­
way. We kept that glimmer alive 
for a long time. Over the last 10 
games, we showed a lot of char­
acter." 
The A's would have clinched earlier in the day if Anaheim had lost at Texas. 
"I don't think anybody wanted to back into it," Howe said. "Even if the Rangers had won today, we didn't back into any­thing. We had a great year and clinched it with a victory. We went our in style today. That was great." 
There was little reaction from the fans at Safeco Field when the Angels' game ended. The mood carried over to the Mariners. 
"It was kind of somber going into the game," reliever Jeff Nelson said. "Everybody had some hope. When we saw that score, it made things kind of meaningless." 
Seattle went ahead in the fourth on consecutive homers, Boone's 24th and Mike Cameron's 25th. Boone favored his right foot as he rounded the bases. limping slightly because of a bruised right heel 

Angels grab wild card, avoid letdown 
Associated Press 
ARLINGTON, Texas Now, the Anaheim Angels can celebrate. 
After 16 years and a four­game losing streak that kept putting off the party, the Angels finally clinched a playoff berth with a 10-5 vic­tory over the Texas Hangers. 
"\,Ve would have taken it anyway, but to have an opportunity to get to do this right here, it's pretty spe­cial," said center fielder Darin Erstad, who was doused in champagne and beer just like everyone else in the Anaheim clubhouse. 
Since their last postseason appearance in 1986, the closest the Angels got to the playoffs was when they fin­ished a game behind Seattle in 1995, when Garett Anderson and Troy Percival were rookies. 
"I had a glimpse of it my first year, but that has been a sour note in my career until now," Anderson said. "I was so close, then the last six or seven years I got a rude awakening of how hard it is to really get to the postsea­son. I'm enjoying this." 
With the score 2-2 in the fifth. outfielder Tim Salmon hit a run-scoring infield sin­
gle and Anderson added a 
three-run homer off Colby 
Lewis {1-3). 
Salmon and Scott Spiezio each hit a two-run homer in the seventh. 
Rookie John Lackey (9-4) allowed three runs and seven hits in five-plus innings. He left after giving up consecu­tive singles to start the sixth. 
Anaheim, which eliminated Seattle with the victory, will open the postseason as the AL wild card Tuesday in New York against the Yankees. Oakland and Minnesota have also clinched AL playoff berths. 
The Angels, who had lost four in a row and seven of nine, clinched on the road for the first time. The team also went to the playoffs in 1979 and 1982 but has never won a postseason series. 
While Anaheim struggled the past week, the Mariners remained in contention with consecutive come-from­behind victories over the A's. 
"It's been a long grind. It's been emotionally draining and physica11y draining," Angels manager Mike Scioscia said. "We got over that little rough spot of maybe guys were trying to bull themselves through that last game to get at least to the playoffs."

dent of the Oregon Baseball 
Campaign, which hopes to bring 
the Expos to the City of Hoses. 
Commissioner Bud Selig said 
back in January that 
\Vashington was a "prime candi­
date," for relocation. But 
Baltimore Orioles owner Peter 
Angelos doesn't want another 
team in his area. Expos presi­
dent Tony Tavares doesn't know 
where the team will wind up. 
"It's a very difficult situation to be in," he said. "To be the leader of a group of people who every day want to know what the future holds for them." 
John McHale, executive vice president of administration in the commissioner's office, is studying the alternatives for Selig and his staff. 
"The season isn't over yet," McHale said. "There's no partic­ular immediacy to this." 
The Portland Oregon Sports Authority has already submitted a proposal to major league bast~­ball and is poisr.d to do whatever necessary to formally bid for the Expos. That includes playing host to them temporarily to demonstrate that Portland can support a team. 
"They need to answer first that philosophical question whether it's best for the Expos to exist in Montreal -or flourish somewhere like Portland," said Drew Mahalir., chief executive officer of the sports authority. 
Portland supporters cite the availability of an interim stadi­um, PGE Park, the commuter­friendly downtown home of the Class AAA Portland Beavers.

Moss apologizes, snubs cop 
Associated Press 
EDEN PRAIRIE. Minn. 
Minnesota Vikings receiver Randy Moss apologized to his team, family and friends Thursday -but not to the woman he's accused of pushing with his car while trying to make a turn. 
Moss spent a night in jail after the Tuesday night episode, which resulted in two misde­meanors but no felony charges. Moss will start Sunday's game against Seattle, and his agent said the team will fine him, although the amount hasn't yet been determined. 
"I'm sorry for what I've caused and what I brought on everyone who really cares about

 
me or this team," Moss said dur­ing a news conference. "I am human. I am a man. I do take care of my responsibilities, and I stand up for my actions." 
Moss, however, made no direct mention of Amy Zaccardi. the 27-year-old traffic control officer who police say stepped in front of Moss' car to stop him from making an illegal turn. Police say the 25-year-old Moss slowly pushed her along the street, stopping when she fell off the car. 
Zaccardi, who's a city employ­ee but not a police officer, was not seriously hurt. 
"I don't know if trouble is out 
to find me," Moss said. "But I'm 
certainly not out to find trouble." 
Moss took no questions at a news conference, but later, in an interview with ESPN, insisted he did nothing wrong. 

"By the time the woman told me to turn back into the lane that I turned in, it was too late," Moss said. "The woman had me confused as to what I was sup­posed to do. There was no con­versation.... All I know is the cuffs are slammed on me, and I'm in the back of the cruiser." 
Moss said the arrest was espe­cially unfortunate considering all the attention he's received for being a team leader early in the season. 
'Tm trying to be there, trying to change, trying to change for the best," he said. Moss prac­ticed Thursday and looked more relaxed, smiling and joking with teammates as well as Tice. 
"I thought he seemed very sin­cere in his apology, and I think everyone accepted that and is ready to have him back on this team," linebacker Greg Biekert said. "He felt bad about what happened and was willing to come to us and say that. I think it takes a lot for a guy to do that." 
Moss whistled as he walked out of jail Wednesday. He was charged with careless driving and failure to obey a traffic offi­cer. He faces a maximum penal­ty of 90 days in jail and a $1,000 fine on each charge. He will be arraigned Oct. 2. 
Police also said they found a marijuana cigarette in Moss' car, an amount that would qual­ify as a petty misdemeanor, with a fine of up to $200. But no drug charge has been filed. Moss' agent, Dante DiTrapano, and his attorney, Joe Friedberg, have said that the marijuana did not belong to Moss. 
Moss didn't directly say who the marijuana belonged to, but repeated that others had the use of his car. He said the NFL does not allow the use of marijuana and he tries his best to stay within the rules. 
Friedberg said Moss has five cars and four other people had driven his Lexus recently. The attorney said they planned to fight the traffic charges. 
Despite the arrest, Coach Mike Tice said Moss will still start for the 0-3 Vikings on Sunday against the Seattle Seahawks. But he said Moss would be disci­plined for missing Wednesday morning's practice. Tice didn't specify what punishment would entail. 
DiTrapano said that the team would fine Moss, with the amount yet to be determined. 
League and team sources told ESPN.com's Len Pasquarelli on Wednesday that the amount of fines will total about $50,000. 
"I know they had to discipline me, for what reason I don't know," Moss said. 
Under NFL rules, Moss will undergo mandatory "evalua­tion" because he was charged. Any disciplinary action would follow a conviction or guilty plea.

Griese sprains ankle tripping over dog 

Associated Press 
DENVER 

Denver Broncos quarter­back Brian Griese was limp­ing on a sprained left ankle, the result of being tripped by his dog on some stairs at his home Wednesday night. 
Griese's availability for Monday night's game in Baltimore was uncertain. 
He was listed as probable on the team's injury report, but he said his ankle was 
sore  and  still  somewhat  
swollen.  
Head  coach  Mike  

Shanahan said the injury was severe enough that X­rays were taken to be sure there was no fracture. Griese did not participate in Thursday's practice, the first of two major workouts this week. 
"I was walking down the stairs and my dog came bar­reling down the stairs after me and clipped me, and I kind of twisted my ankle on the stairs," Griese said. "These things happen. Unfortunately, it happened to me. 
'Tm getting treatment. I'm going to ice it and hope the swelling goes down." 
Asked about his status for Monday night, Griese said, 'Tm expecting to play right now." 
If Griese can't go, veteran Steve Beuerlein would take his place. 
Shanahan said the unde­feated Broncos should know more about the severity of the injury in the next few days. 
"With a sprained ankle, I don't think you really know," he said. "Sometimes it's two weeks, other times you can come back in a day or two. I'm not exactly sure how serious it is, but it's bad enough that he's not going to practice [Thursday]. 
"It's one of those things you deal with." 
Asked his reaction when Griese gave him the news, Shanahan said, "I said, 'Oh, no.' I thought, 'What's going to start from here, rumors and speculation of what hap­pened? Did he really trip over the dog?' That's what I was thinking." 
On May 5, Griese tripped on a steep driveway at team­mate Terrell Davis' house and was knocked uncon­scious. bruising his face. The injury fueled speculation Griese was intoxicated. 
Tight end Shannon Sharpe expressed disbelief when informed of Griese's version of his latest injury. 
"Are you jiving?" he said. "I know you're all joking."

McGlinn offense St. Ed's starts season late, to face challenge ready to get victory 
By ROB MILLS 
.Sports Writer 
McGlinn captain Juli!~ Kremer is worried about the Lyons defense this weekend, and rightfully so. The Lyons defense has played superbly the past few games, always making the big stops when they needed. 
Despite her worries Kremer still expect-. a well-played game from both teams. 
"It's going to be a good game," Kremer said. "You know the other team is prepar­ing just as hard as you are and that you really can't take any­thing for granted." 
Over tlw past week, Kremer and offensive coach Grant Kreizenb1~ck have worked on improving receiver routes and quarterback vision. The Shamrocks am hoping to use tlw passing game frnquently.

The past few games, the Lyons offense has had its share of problems. but after a week of work, it is starting to show some progress, Jenkins said. 
Jenkins said her team was looking for a big win this week­end. With a 1-1-1 record Jenkins and the rest of the Lyons need a few good wins to carry them into the playoffs. 
Howard vs. Pangbom 
Pangborn may not have a coach this weekend, but they will not be without a leader. Pangborn quarterback Charlotte Troupis, says that although their biggest concern is heading into the game with­out a coach, there will be plenty of talent to rally the team together. 
Troupis says no single athlete causes their success and that the strong team effort drives thn Phoxes to succeed. 
However, Troupis is impressed with the play of April Flores, one of Pangborn's lead­ing receivers. Flores is an inte­gral part of Pangborn's strate­gic aerial attack. Troupis also praised the efforts of upcoming freshmen Amy Matte and Aliya Biddle. 
Most of Pangborn's work in practice this week has l,een focused on knowing individual roles, player responsibilities and becoming more sorious and focused for the upcoming game.

quarterback Leslie Schmidt at the PW 14­yard line on the previous play. 
The Whirlwinds added to their advantage just before halftime. This time, the play was remarkably similar to Dillingham-to-Battle. 
From the PW 31-yard line, Hoeck completed a short pass to wide receiver Sarah Skrabacz, who juked and wig­gled her way around the Purple Weasels' defense to the end zone. 
Back-up quarterback Melissa Sands continued the Whirlwinds' potent pass offense, completing all three of her passes in the second half for 37 yards. including a 9-yard touchdown to wide receiver Mary Murphy. 
The Purple vVeasels (1-2) got on the scoreboard with less than two minutes left in the game, when Schmidt completed a 39-yard touchdown pass to 

wide receiver Heather Van 
Hoegarden. The conversion 
pass to Van Hoegarden was 
also successful, making the 
final score 20-7. 
"It felt good [to score] 
because we never gave up," 
Schmidt said. "We know Welsh 
is a good team. We got off to a 
slow start, but picked up 
momentum in the second half. 
We'll be ready for the next 
game." 

Whirlwinds co-captain Murphy explained the reason for her team's quarterback switch. 
"We just have two different quarterbacks," she safd. "They're both pretty solid play­ers and it's good to throw [our opponents] off a little bit." 
Following a previous loss to Breen-Phillips, Murphy said that the team really needed a good win to get back on track. 
"It's a pretty good win for us," she said. "We really picked it up and came together as a team." 
Badin 19, Farley 0 
It only took Farley's defense two plays to realize what they were up against in Badin 's offense. After referring to Badin (2-1) as a "small dorm," Farley saw Badin wide receiver Steph Heath take an out pattern 60 yards and start the Bullfrogs on its way to a 19-0 victory. 
Bullfrog quarterback Erin Zachry threw for 160 yards and three touchdowns. Zachry did not take the credit for her team's victory.

and firing to open receivers all over the field. Farley tried to blitz to slow down Zachry, but all of their efforts came up empty. 
On defense, the Bullfrogs were led by Jen Carter's three interceptions. Carter, the for­mer varsity soccer player, is playing interhall football for the first time as a junior. This year, Carter has been more than a welcome addition to the Bullfrogs, as she has emerged as a defensive leader already. 
"Jen is extremely helpful to our team." Zachry said. "She adds a lot of athleticism to our defense." 
Meanwhile, the Finest look to regroup after their third straight loss. In the post-game huddle, the team was upbeat, looking forward to their next game, in hopes of a victory. Quarterback Katie Popik, a freshman, struggled to run an option-like offense against a more experienced and skilled defense. 
However, Popik had a positive outlook about the game, and the future of the Finest this sea­son. 
"Everything was clicking." she said. "We moved the ball up the field, but we just couldn't get it in the end zone. We will be fine." 
Zachry meanwhile walked out with a smile on her face. 
"I had a lot of time to throw because of the offensive line tonight. and our receivers just caught the ball," she said.

The Irish come into the tour­nament after finishing 10th at last week's Mary Fossum Invitational at Michigan State, but the team still has high expectations for this week. 
"As long as everyone shoots somewhere in the 70s, we'll have a good shot to win," 

freshman Sarah Bassett said. "We're a deep team. everyone challenges each other in prac­tice and we have good team chemistry." 
Irish coach Debby King's lineup this week largely reflect­ed the way her players finished at last week's tournament. Bassett and fellow freshman Lauren Gebauer were the low scorers for the Irish and will play the top two positions this weekend. 
Juniors Rebecca Rogers and Shannon Byrne will be joined by two more freshmen, Katie Brophy and Lauren Barbir. All of the Irish golfers in the lineup competed last week except for that the 2000 team had in the inaugural Notre Dame Invitational. Rogers opened the tournament with a two-under par 70 on her way to the indi­vidual championship. She also the Irish to a 30-stroke win over second-place Princeton. 
Considering that every golf course is different, playing at home should be a significant asset for the Irish as they look to win their tournament for the second time in three years. 
"Playing our home course is definitely an advantage," Bassett said. "The greens and bunkers are the toughest part of the course." 
"We should be able to win if

Sometimes winning is simply not enough. Just ask the Notre Dame womens soccer team. 
Last weekend. the No. 9 Irish recorded two home victories against conference opponents Rutgers and Seton Hall, but winning those games does not tell the whole story. 
After Sunday's game, Notre Dame coach Randy Waldrum was extremely upset with his team's effort on the field. 
''Everybody's got to get on the same page and get a commit­ment level to what we're doing," Waldrum said. "Until we do that, every game is going to be like this. We've got a diffi­cult schedule. These are the types of games we need to win by five or six." 
The Irish (6-2, 2-0 in the Big East) begin the walk down the difficult part of their schedule this weekend when they play at Villanova (5-1-2, 1-1) on Friday and at Georgetown (7-3, 2-0) on Sunday. Both of these games will be important factors in determining the final standings of the Big East's Mid-Atlantic division. 
In last Friday's match against Rutgers, the Irish needed some clutch saves by freshman goal­keeper Erika Bohn and an incredible goal by forward Amy Warner in the second overtime to finally put away the Scarlet Knights. 
Sunday's performance against the Pirates was not much better. Even though Notre Dame outshot the Pirates 13-2, the Irish were lucky to escape with a 1-0 win. llad it not been for midfielder Handi Schf~ll<-~r stepping in front of Pirates forward Jo Ann Flanagan's wide-open shot from 10 feet in front of the goal, the game probably would have ended in a 1-1 tie. 
"\Ve played terrible," Irish captain Amy Warner said. "We need to improve in all aspects of the game. We need to be much quicker to the ball and play smarter. We are not as mentally tough as we need to be." 
The lone bright spot for Notre 
Dame last weekend was the 
play of its defense. Despite 
playing without injured starters 
Vanessa Pruzinsky and Gudrun 
Gunnarsdottir, the Irish did not 
surrender any goals. 
Mary Boland, who just con­
verted to defense from midfield 
only two weeks ago, was named 
the Big East Defender of the 
Week. Bohn was named the Big 
East Goalie of the Week after 
recording the first two shutouts

of her career. Notre Dame is hoping their defense continues their top-notch play against this weekend. 
"Everyone is starting to get more comfortable on defense," Chapman said. "We're starting to learn how to communicate a lot better on the field. We need to play well again this week­end." 
After scoring five goals in the final 25 minutes against Maryland two weeks ago, the Irish offense fell flat last week­end scoring only two goals against two of the weakest defenses in the Big East. 
"It's been really tough," Warner said. "We know we have the talent out there, but we just are not getting results. At this point, everything that could be said has been said. 
"Now, it's just a question of us going out there and doing it on the field. Villanova and Georgetown are much tougher than last week's teams so we know we have to play better."

Notes: 
. 
Notre Dame will again play without starting defenders Pruzinsky and Gunnarsdottir. Pruzinsky has appeared in only one game all season due to a severe knee injury. Gunnarsdottir has been side­lined with a stress fracture in her foot. She is expected to be back in two to three weeks. Kim Carpenter and Boland have replaced them in the starting lineup. 

. 
Starting midfielder Ashley Dryer is also expected to miss this weekend's action due to an ankle injury she sustained against Rutgers. Freshman Maggie Manning replaced her in the starting lineup last week­end against Seton Hall. 

. 
Warner was named the Big East Offensive Player of the Week for her dramatic over­time goal against Rutgers on Friday.

contests. With that impres­sive resume comes the bur­den of getting an opponent's best effort in every match. 
"We just have to realize for the teams in our conference, or non-conference, it is usu­ally the biggest match of the year for them against us," Brown said. "Our opponents are very well prepared and emotionally up for the game. Our biggest challenge in the conference is that we have to get up for every match. We have to match or exceed the level of determination the opponent brings to the game. 
"If we think that we don't have to work that hard, we are in big trouble," she con­tinued. "But I don't believe the team is thinking that way."

Irish Coach "I real­ly felt we w e r e coming into St. John's and looking for a victory," said Clark. "\Ve were looking to play them evenly and I think we did that. I think St. John's was very relieved to get out of today's game with a victory. "But maybe that's why they are the No. 2-ranked team in 

the country because they are able to, somehow, get a victo­ry out of a game like that." 
Notre Dame's only other loss this season came as a result of a late goal by their opponent. Bradley scored with less than 10 minutes remaining to beat Notre Dame 3~2 a week ago. Clark feels the Irish must start winning close games and cannot allow the late goal. 
"We've got to learn how to win these games because that's a couple games now that we've lost in the last five minutes of the game," said Clark. "[Allowing late goals is] maybe something we can look at when we look at the video tomorrow and take it from there." 
Notre Dame's schedule doesn't get any easier as the Irish face Rutgers on the road Sunday.

FOOTBALL 
BCS poll 
considers Irish 3-0 
By ANDREW SOUKUP Sports Writer 
Few college football fans expected Notre Dame to jump out to a 4-0 start this year. But the big surprise for Irish fans is that the BCS only con­siders the Irish 3-0, thanks to a dispute over whether or not Notre Dame can count its 22-0 win against Maryland in the Kickoff Classic toward the nine-win total needed to qual­ify for a BCS bowl. 
But Notre Dame officials think it's obvious the game should count in BCS standings because the game was played after the date the NCAA con­siders the official start of the regular season. 
According to NCAA rules, no team may play a game before the Thursday before Labor Day unless the school receives prior permission from the NCAA to play in an "exempt" preseason game. That game is then not counted toward the total number of games a team is allowed to play in a season. 
In the past, the Kickoff Classic took place two Saturdays before Labor Day and never counted toward the total number of games a school could play in a season. Hight now, BCS officials don't see any reason why it should be different. 
"The Kickoff Classic has always been an exempt game," said John Paquette, associate commissioner for communications for the Big East Conference, whose com­missioner serves as BCS coor­dinator this year. "But there's nothing to prevent them from asking (the BCS] to reconsider the situation." 
The Notre Dame-Maryland game, originally scheduled for Aug. 24, was moved when Notre Dame officials discov­ered that the game would interfere with Freshman Orientation. They moved the game back a week and began the season the same time as most NCAA teams, automati­cally assuming the game would be considered "non­exempt." 
"We always felt it was non­exempt from the beginning," Notre Dame associate athletic director John Heisler said. "In the past, the game was always
