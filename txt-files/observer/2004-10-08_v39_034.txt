Safety proposal gets mixed reception 
Board of Trustees criticize SafeBus, applaud other measures 
By CLAIRE HEININGER News Editor 
The Board of Trustees harshly questioned the timing, feasibility and logistics of student govern­ment's proposal to create a Notre Dame SafeBus Thursday, but acknowledged the importance of off-campus safety as an overarch­ing report theme and embraced some of the students' lesser initia­tives. 
The SafeBus idea -the corner­stone of a four-point proposal that also included off-campus security seminars, greater neighborhood involvement and the prospect of Notre Dame Security/Police extending its reach beyond cam­pus boundaries -should have been subjected to further student government review and Campus Life Council approval before it reached the Board's level, one trustee said. 
The Observer has a policy of not attributing information or quotes to specific members of the Board. 
"To ask the Trustees to step in first is certainly the cart before the horse," he said. . 
The presenters, student body president Adam Istvan, vice presi­dent Karla Bell and chief execu­tive assistant Dave Baron, should have also cleared the SafeBus plan with busing companies and asked the city of South Bend to take responsibility for liability concerns, another trustee said. 
"You may want to hit all those other parties before it comes to us," he said. 
Other trustees worried the SafeBus sounded too much like the various van line systems that failed at the University in the past. 
"I feel like thi'i idea kind of has a renaissance every 1 0 years," another trustee said, pointing out that when she attended Notre Dame, a saferide service died out because of sparse participation. 
"How many students would use it?" she asked. "Did you learn anything from the vanlines of the past?" 
Istvan said he had. 
"We don't want this to be another failed saferide," he said,

9/11 commissioner discusses report 
Tim Roemer explains investigation's results 
By CLAIRE HEININGER News Editor 
In order to follow the example of the bipartisan Sept. 11 panel, Americans immersed in a red­state and blue-state mentality must overcome partisan politics to pressure the government into true intelligence reform, Tim Hoerner, a Democratic member of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States and a former House mem­ber from Indiana, said Thursday. 
Roemer, who holds an M.A. and Ph.D. from Notre Dame and rep­resented South Bend for 12 years in the U.S. House of Hepresentatives, urged the Jordan Auditorium audience to return to the unity felt during the tragic attacks' aftermath. 
"We've got a threat, and we need to act on it -that means all of Ameriea, not Republicans, not Democrats;" he said. "Duct tape and color codes have not worked particularly well. The American people are tough enough, smart

Nolan to depart. in December 
SMC admissions director steps down after two decades 
By ANGELA SAOUD 
St. Mary's Editor 
In a move unrelated to the drop in enrollment at Saint Mary's, director of admissions Mary Pat Nolan has announced that she will leave the College in December, 
after 21 years in the posi­tion. 
"It has noth­ing to do with admissions or the budget," Nolan said. "It's entirely 

coincidental. Nolan I'm getting married, and my new husband lives in Philadelphia so I will be 
moving to be with him." 
College President Carol Mooney said a national search for Nolan's replacement is in the beginning stages, but there is still work to be done before it official­ly begins. 
"We have constituted a search committee and hired a consulting firm that has done a lot of work in filling enrollment management positions," Mooney said. "The search consultant will be on campus next week working with the search committee to craft a position description." 
Mooney said the search will begin soon thereafter. 
She also stressed the impor­tance of finding a person with experience in student recruit­ment, including admissions, financial aid, marketing and retention.

Pop goes the collar

Editor
ing of these is also 
the most irritating-the popped col­
lar. 
I just don't get it. Why do people do this to their shirts? Maybe they're blocking their necks from the sun, wind and rain. Maybe they're cold. Maybe they're hiding hickeys. Maybe I'm the only one who is missing out. 
Thinking back, I should have seen it coming. Fashion trends recycle, right? And in the 1800s, fashionable men starched their collars in order to wear the cravats that served as ties. The collar's points framed their faces. 
This fad simply never faded away on the East Coast, where prep-school etiquette required that young men sport starched coll~rs even on the weekends. It also appeared on the West Coast in the early 90s when hip­hop artists like MC Hammer told us to "pop ya collar." 
The popped collar is obviously a craze of the past. Why, then, is the J. Crew U.look so prevalent here, now? 
Fellow Observer staffer Kelly Meehan and I tried out the popped collar and asked our fellow students what they thought about it. While most agreed that it was fashionable, many said that the majority of collar­poppers are merely imitating those who have the right to pop. And when questioned, the general consensus was that this group consisted of upper-crust East Coasters who have been popping their whole lives. 

I won't go so far as to say that the only people who should wear the popped collar are preppy or wealthy. I don't necessarily believe that. Some of the coolest people in entertainment history flipped up their collars­think John Lennon, Lloyd Dobler in "Say Anything," Elvis, the Fonz, Michael Jackson in the "Bad" era, and even Alex P. Keaton. These were men who bravely popped where no men had popped before. They were the truly cool fashion trendsetters among the masses. 
But if you think about it, the stiff collar has been sported by many who should hav.e avoided it. Dracula, for one, is a prime example. Star Trek characters, the Bride of Frankenstein, even dogs who have had surgery all get a chance to flip their collars. 
My point to you is this: The more liberal American style.seems to get, the more and more the trendy attempt to reach back to steal fash­ions from the past. You cannot rein­vent something as classic as the polo shirt, nor is it always appropriate to try. How you dress should be a reflec­tion of who you really are. Don't let a fashion trend designate how you pres­ent yourself to the world. And most importantly, pop your collar responsi­bly.

Lilly Endowment donates grant 
Company gives University $3Mfor recruitment 
Special to The Observer 
Lilly Endowment Inc. has awarded a $3 million grant to Notre Dame as part of a $100 million program called the "Initiative to Recruit and Retain Intellectual Capital for Indiana Higher Education Institutions." 
Announced earlier this year, the initiative invited 37 Indiana public and private col­leges and universities to sub­mit proposals for attracting or ences and assist with other activities related to their teaching and research. A sec­ond part of the faculty compo­nent, the Lilly Endowment Collegiate Chairs, will provide a $50,000 fund each of the next three years to seven new young scholars for similar pro­fessional enhancement pur­poses.

Notre Dame will use the funds to recruit both new fac­ulty and graduate students. 

Within the faculty compo­nent, the University will award two Lilly Endowment Senior Fellowships each of the next three years to newly appointed senior faculty. The fellows will receive $75,000 to support their research infrastructure, make library purchases, attend professional confer-Hatch. 
"Lilly Endowment deserves consid­erable credit for establishing this innovative program, and we at Notre Dame are thankful for this generous grant." 
A second aspect of the grant will establish within the Graduate School the Lilly Endowment Fellowship pro­gram, components of which include: 
+ The recruitment of 25 doctoral students as Lilly Fellows each of the next three years, beginning in 2005. The 
funds will be used to support students during their studies toward a doctorate. 
+ 
The recruitment of 45 Lilly Endowment Presidential Fellows in the College of Arts and Letters. Funds will increase stipends for students in the existing Presidential Fellowships program, and extend suppurt to five years. 

+ 
The establishment of 30 Lilly Endowment Fellows in the Colleges of Science and Engineering. The funding will increase stipend levels of cur­rent research assistantships for four years of study, and increase the number of prize fellowships in the two col­leges. Special attention will be given to recruiting women and students from traditionally underrepresented groups. 



"We are most appreciative to Lilly Endowment Inc. for its support," said Jeffrey Kantor, vice president for graduate studies and research. "We believe the Lilly Endowment Fellowship program will bring to our region an exceptionally talented pool of advanced stu­dents who, in turn, will help us recruit exceptional faculty to the University. And, as they complete · their doctoral degrees at Notre Dame, the Lilly Fellows will add signifi­cantly to the talent pool avail­able to higher education and research driven economic development in Indiana."

Currently, there is one mem­ber of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) who holds the position of Head of the CIA and Director of Central Intelligence. The 9/11 Commission Report criticizes the policy of giving one person both hats. 
According to the report, the solution to this problem lies in dividing these responsibilities between two people instead of one, and assigning the role of coordinating all intelligence from all different agencies to 
one appointed individual.  
The creation of this role  -

They rise earlier than even the most die-hard of Saturday tail­gaters to don the legendary Scottish plaid -a tradition inau­gurated during the 197 4 football season. It is literally a Guard trademark, as the pattern is offi­cially registered in Scotland as Notre Dame Plaid, said alumnus guardsman Mark Baumgartner. 
An hour and a half before kick­off. the Guard ushers the band onto the steps of Bond Hall for its morning concert, performing the time-honored Victory Clog and standing for inspection in front of the captain and Guardsmen alum. 
The Guard then leads a proces­sion across campus to Notre Dame stadium and onto the field. There, it performs the pre-game routine, halftime show and post­game ritual. which includes a repeat of the signature Victory Clog in the event of an Irish win. 
Although the Guard requires a lot of commitment, it is all worth­while, said Anderson. 
"My most memorable experi­ence on Guard was my first game, standing in the tunnel before we went onto the field and seeing the other team go into the locker room, and then leading the band onto the field," he said. 
From an alumni perspective, memories were perhaps a little more golden and glorious in 1977. 
"[My best memory] was stand­ing on the field in Texas at the Cotton Bowl after we beat Texas to win the National Championship my senior year," Baumgartner said. "Nothing beats that feel­ing." 
"It was fun, we took it seriously and despite what some people might think, we really cared that we represented the University. Not that we were always perfectly behaved young men out of uni­form. but I think we presented the right. mix of seriousness and fun."

Explosions near Egypt-Israeli border 
CAIRO, Egypt -Three explosions shook popular resorts on Egypt's Sinai Peninsula on Thursday night as many Israelis vacationed at the close of a Jewish holiday. Officials said at least 30 people were killed and 114 wounded, and witnesses gave unconfirmed reports that all three explosions were caused by car bombs. 
The first blast, about 10 p.m., shook the Hilton hotel in the Taba resort, only yards from the Israeli border, and Israel's army radio quoted Israeli security officials as say­ing they were convinced it was a car bomb. 
"The whole front of the hotel has collapsed. There are dozens of people on the floor, lots of blood. It is very tense," witness Yigal Vakni told Israel's Army Radio. "I am standing out­side of the hotel, the whole thing is burning and they have nothing to put it out with." 
New leader in world child mortality 
UNITED NATIONS -In Sierra Leone, one in four children dies before age 5. In Iraq, one in 10 does not make it to a fifth birthday. Across the globe, poor care for newborns, malnutri­tion, malaria, diarrhea and measles snuff out lives of the very young, according to a U.N. report released Friday. 
The United Nations Children's Fund reported "alarmingly slow progress on reducing child deaths" -one in 12 children worldwide does not live to age 5,-with half of all those deaths occurring in sub-Saharan Africa. 
"It is incredible that in an age of technologi­cal and medical marvels, child survival is so tenuous in so many places, especially for the poor and marginalized," UNICEF director Carol Bellamy said.

Corporate tax bill debated 
WASHINGTON -The House moved toward passage Thursday of the most sweeping rewrite of corporate tax law in nearly two decades, a measure designed to end a nasty trade war with Europe and $136 billion in new tax breaks on businesses, farmers and other groups. 
Supporters argued that the centerpiece of the legislation -tax relief for American factories ­was critically needed to aid beleaguered manu­facturers who have suffered 2.7 million lostjobs over the past four years. 
But opponents charged that the tax package had grown into a massive giveaway that will add to the complexity of the tax system and end up rewarding multinational companies that move jobs overseas.

A direotor with the budgetary power to ensure sharing is essen­tial, Roemer said -but not under the title that has thus far been popular with the press. 
"You don't create a czar, that's the last thing he should be called," the former Congressman said. "We need to create some­body with responsibility and accountability that can create a bridge between overseas and our country." 
That scenario would be much improved from the current one, he added. · If intelligence is not streamlined through the bureaucracy, Roemer said, our government will contin­ue to be "an elephant chasing a snake." 
Roemer was also critical of Congress. 
''It they can't fix themselves, they have a have a hard time telling FBI and the CIA to fix their own problems," he said. 
Recalling the story of Flight 93 -which, due to the heroism of its passengers, crashed in a field in Pennsylvania, not into a national landmark in Washington -Roemer called those aboard "the first patriots and heroes of the war on terror." 
"They did that for us -·now what can we do?" he asked. "It takes a lot of tenacity and courage to get change . . . We had such a great unity of spirit. unity of purpose, unity of values on September 11 and right after ­and now we can have it back if we want it."

would naturally be eager to have the University instead of the city assume liability for off-campus partiers. 
However, the Board praised the officers' other initiatives for pro­moting off-campus security, espe­cially Istvan's goal to create "neighborhoods ofrespect." 
"It's not about [our neighbors] knowing us," Istvan said. "If we know them, we can be more con­scious and respectful." 
Along with student involvement on neighborhood boards, the off­campus seminar was also enthu­siastically embraced by the Board. Requiring mandatory seminar participation for all stu­dents moving off-campus would not be out of the question, he said. 
He concluded his remarks with the observation that collaboration between student government and NDSP to create a comprehensive plan for off-campus protection was also a valid goal. 
··we should have clarity and thoroughness in how we deal with security off-campus,'' the trustee said. "But relative to the bus, lots of legitimate concerns were raised ... [you should] throw that back in for more thorough 
vetting." · Istvan, Bell and Baron said they planned to do just that. 
''They didn't say no," Istvan said. "In fact, he said yes to look­ing into it. That's not a 'yes, it will exist,' but it's a 'yes, we should pursue it."' 
Following the advice of the Board, the three will now pursue the SafeBus plan through Student Senate and the CLC, Baron said. When asked why the student leaders didn't follow that route in the first place, Baron minimized· SafeBus' role in the overall report. .

enough to be involved and com­mitted to [their own security.]" 
A principal author of the legis­lation that created the National Commission on Terrorist Acts Upon the United States, Roemer highlighted the four failures id{m­tified in the report: a failure of imagination, in which the intelli­gence community did not assess the possibility of attacks within the United States' borders; a fail­ure of management, in which the director of the Central Intelligence Agency lacked the budgetary authority to be effec­tive; a failure of capabilities, in which military options were con­fmed to a cold-war mentality; and a failure of policy, in which nei­ther the Clinton nor Bush admin­istration put terrorism as its top priority. 
Instead of using a "heads will roll" mindset to compensate for these failures, Roemer said the commission -aimed for creating a global strategy to win the war on terror. 
And he is sure that America's resources -especially military, education and economic assis­tance-are up to the task. 
"We need to use all the arrows in our quiver of American power and resources," Roemer said, " ... to convince the Arab and Muslim world that we will not tolerate [their religion] being twisted." 
Another major recommenda­tion of the commission, which included five Democrats and five Republicans, was that the govern­ment create a cabinet-level national intelligence director, Roemer said.

IN BRIEF 
AT&T expands job cut plan 
NEW YORK -AT&T Corp. announced 
Thursday that it is cutting at least 7,500 more 
jobs and slashing the value of its assets by 
$11.4 billion, drastic moves prompted by the 
company's plan to retreat from the traditional 
consumer telephone business. 
The company now plans to shrink its work 
force by more than a fifth, or about 12,500 jobs, 
during 2004 -up from a previous target of 
about 4,900 jobs. 
Severance costs and other expenses related to 
the job cuts will reduce third-quarter earnings 
by $1.1 billion, the company said. 
The asset writedown of $11.4 billion amounts 
to about a quarter of the company's assets, and 
reflects the reduced value of AT&T's network 
now that it will be carrying less consumer voice 
traffic. 
"In response to recent regulatory develop­ments and a highly competitive market. we have made some tough decisions to reduce our work force and cut costs," said AT&T chairman and chief executive Dave Dorman. 
Eyeglass make~ moving to Cincinnati , 
TWINSBURG, OhiO -The new parent compa­ny of eyeglass retailer Cole National Corp. said Wednesday it plans to shift Cole's 800-employee administrative and service operations center from suburban Cleveland to the Cincinnati area. 
Italian eyeglass maker Luxottica Group SPA completed its $495 million takeover Tuesday of Cleveland-based Cole, which operated the Pearle Vision retail chain and eyeglass opera­tions in Sears, BJ's and Target stores. 
"Luxottica Group will fully integrate its North American retail division and Cole National into one business," the company said. 
Luxottica said many of the affected employees would be offered jobs at its Cincinnati-area location but had no figures. 
"We're looking to move as many as possible," spokesman Luca Biondolillo said by phone from Milan, Italy. 
Twinsburg Mayor Katherine Procop said she has begun a search for a new corporate tenant for Cole National's 170,000 square feet of office space. The operation generated about $640,000, or more than 3.5 percent. of Twinsburg's annual $17.5 million in income taxes, she said.

Rocket hits Kabul the day before elections 

Associated Press 
KABUL -A rocket slammed into the Afghan capital near the 
U.S. 
Embassy and other diplomat­ic missions early Friday, a day before landmark elections. All 

U.S. 
embassy staff were ordered to briefly take cover in an under­ground bunker. 


The rocket hit a parking lot near a media accreditation center for the elections, causing no dam­age or casualties, said Lt. Commander Ken MacKillop, a spokesman for international peacekeepers. 
He said peacekeepers suspect­ed a second rocket may have hit nearby, but no impact site 
was found. "We are alert praised his peo­"We are ple for embrac­

and Afghan troops sealed off the roads leading to the diplo­matic area. 
Beth Lee. a spokeswoman for the U.S. embassy, said all staff had been ordered to take cover in an underground bunker as a pre­caution. A senior U.S. official in Washington said embassy staff were allowed out of the bunkers a short time later. 
The blast shattered a relatively calm lead-up to Saturday's vote, at least in the capital. It was loud enough to shake windows and rouse people from bed. 
The headquarters for the 9,000-strong NATO-led International Security Assistance Force is also close to the U.S. Embassy, as are the German and Pakistani missions. 
It was the first apparent attack in Kabul since August 28, when a huge car bomb outside a private 
U.S. security firm killed 10 people -three of them Americans. The Americans were helping train anti-narcotics police. 
Taliban and ai-Qaida rebels have kept up a steady stream of attacks throughout Afghanistan since campaigning for the election began Sept. 7, but they have so far failed to launch the type of high-impact assault that might derail the vote. 
Afghanistan's Interior Minister Ali Ahmad Jalali said Thursday that Afghan forces had thwarted at least 20 attacks and arrested more than 100 people since the start of the campaign, but that the rebels had managed more than 60 rocket or bomb attacks during the period, most in the provinces. 
He put the death toll at more than 60 -including 15 civilians, 19 security forces and 30 suspect­ed rebels. Six Afghan troops were taken hostage. 
In addition to rebel violence, drug smugglers are believed to be posing an increasingly large threat to the country's stability. 
Jalali said drug traffickers, not the Taliban, were responsible for an attack Wednesday on interim leader Hamid Karzai's vice presi­dential running mate, Ahmed Zia Massood. · 
One person was killed and five others wounded in the bombing, including the former governor of Badakhshan. a mountainous northeastern poppy-growing region. Massood was unhurt. 
Jalali said "the evidence shows that it was the work of drug smugglers, because this process [the election] is against their interests." 
The attack was the third against Karzai and his political allies since campaigning began. The president survived a rocket assault on his helicopter on Sept. 16 in the eastern city of Gardez, and one of his four current vice presidents survived a bomb attack four days later. The Taliban was suspected in those attacks. 
During the last major political event in Kabul, the loya jirga, or grand council, in December and January, militants frred a series of rockets on the city, though there were no casualties.

WIESBADEN -Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz welcomed the 
U.S. Army's 1st Armored Division back to its German base Thursday after an extended, 15-month tour of duty in Iraq, joining with soldiers to pay tribute to 130 comrades killed in the Middle East. 
Soldiers representing the division's individual battal­ions, brigades and compa­nies lined up in full battle gear, helmets and de~ert fatigues as the homecoming ceremony opened with a 15-gun salute for Lt. Gen. Ricardo Sanchez, the head 
of V Corps and formerly the top military commander in Iraq. 
Wolfowitz greeted the sol­diers and their relatives with a message of welcome from President Bush. 
"Our country is proud of your service and I am proud to be your commander in chief," Bush's letter said. · 
The division's troops returned by the end of July and many immediately went on leave. leading to the delayed welcoming ceremony. After a year in Iraq, their tour was extended by three months to help deal with rising violence. 
Eight 1st Armored Division soldiers based in the town of Baumholder were killed in a single attack near Baghdad on April 29. The division was sup­posed to have begun returning home by then, and the exten­sion was a difficult time for service members and families.

Bush says _rival is .misleading 
WAUSAU, Wis. -· President Bush on 
Thursday accused Sen. John Kerry of mislead­
ing Americans, trying to turn the tables on the 
Democrat who argues that the commander in 
chief has not been candid with the nation 
about Iraq and the economy. 
Responding to Kerry's criticism just hours 
earlier, the Republican incumbent described 
his rival's words as "overheated rhetoric." 
Bush dismissed the Democrat's complaint that 
the administration exaggerated its main 
rationale for war -weapons of mass destruc­
tion -and was shifting to another explana­
tion. 
Bush citing comments Kerry made in 
October 2002 when the four-term 
Massachusetts senator voted for the congres­
sional resolution authorizing the use of force 
in Iraq. 
"Now today, my opponent tried to say I made 
up reasons to go to war," Bush said to boos 
from his friendly audience. "Just who's the one 
trying to mislead the American people?" 
Bush did not mention the final report from 
the chief U.S. weapons hunter in Iraq, who 
concluded that Saddam Hussein's weapons 
programs had deteriorated before the U.S.-led 
invasion that toppled his regime. Bush 
addressed the report before leaving 
Washington, telling reporters he was "right to 
take action" in Iraq. 
Kerry assails Bush on Iraq 
ENGLEWOOD, Colo. -Sen. John Kerry said Thursday that President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney have failed to recognize a deteriorating situation in postwar Iraq and­"may well be the last two people on the planet who won't face the truth." 
In his strongest statement yet, the Democratic presidential nominee said if Bush fails to recognize the severity of problems in Iraq, the situation could become as chaotic as the Middle East was in the early 1980s. 
"If the president just does more of the same every day and it continues to deteriorate, I may be handed Lebanon, figuratively speak­ing," Kerry said at a brief news conference. 
The Lebanese civil war, which lasted from 1975-1990, killed more than 150,000 people and devastated the capital of Beirut, once called the "Paris of the Middle East." 
In 1983, suicide attacks against the U.S. Embassy in Lebanon killed 63 people, and the bombing of U.S. Marine barracks in Beirut six months later killed 241 servicemen. Dozens of Westerners were taken hostage during that period, and President Reagan ordered U.S. troops to withdraw from Lebanon a few months after the Marine bombing. 
Kerry also spoke the day after Charles Duelfer, the U.S. weapons hunter in Iraq, reported that Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction programs had deteriorated by March 2003. Kerry said the report "provid­ed definitive evidence as to why George Bush should not be re-elected president of the United States." 
Bush conceded Thursday that Iraq did not have the stockpiles of banned weapons he had warned of before the invasion. But he main­tained that Saddam retained the "means and the intent" to prodnce weapons of mass destruction and that the United States was right to take action against him.

Bush, Cheney admit Iraq had no WMDs 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -President Bush and his vice president con­ceded Thursday in the clearest terms yet that Saddam Hussein had no weapons of mass destruc­tion, even as they tried to shift the Iraq war debate to a new issue -whether the invasion was justified because Saddam was abusing a U.N. oil-for-food program. 
Ridiculing the Bush administra­tion's evolving rationale for war, Democratic presidential candi­date John Kerry shot back: "You don't make up or fmd reasons to go to war after the fact." 
Vice President Dick Cheney brushed aside the central find­ings of chief U.S. weapons hunter Charles Duelfer -that Saddam not only had no weapons of mass destruction and had not made any since 1991, but that he had no capability of making any either -while Bush unapologeti­cally defended his decision to invade Iraq. 
"The Duelfer report showed that Saddam was systematically gam­

he prepared to fly 
to campaign events 
in Wisconsin. "He was doing so 
with the intent of restarting his 
weapons program once the world 
looked away." 
Duelfer found no formal plan by Saddam to resume WMD pro­duction. but the inspector sur­mised that Saddam intended to do so if U.N. sanctions were lift­ed. Bush seized upon that infer­ence, using the word "intent" three times in reference to Saddam's plans to resume mak­ing weapons. 
This week marks the first time that the Bush administration has listed abuses in the oil-for-fuel program as an Iraq war ration-· ale. But the strategy holds risks because some of the countries that could be implicated include 
U.S. allies, such as Poland, Jordan and Egypt. In addition, the United States itself played a significant role in both the cre­ation of the program and how it was operated and overseen. 
For his part, Cheney dismissed the significance of Duelfer's cen­tral findings, telling supporters in Miami. "The headlines all say 'no weapons of mass destruction stockpiled in Baghdad.' We already knew that." 
The. vice president said he found other parts of the report "more intriguing," including the finding that Sad dam's main goal was the removal of international sanctions. 
"As soon as the sanctions were lifted, he had every intention of going back" to his weapons pro­gram, Cheney said. 
The report underscored that "delay, defer, wait, wasn't an option," Cheney said. And he told a later forum in Fort Myers. Fla.. speaking of the oil-for-food pro­gram: "The sanctions regime was coming apart at the seams. Saddam perverted that whole thing and generated billions of dollars."· 
Yet Bush and Cheney acknowl­edged more definitively than before that Saddam did not have the banned weapons that both men had asserted he did -and had cited as the major justifica­tion before attacking Iraq in March 2003. 
Bush has recently left the ques­tion open. For example, when asked in June whether he thought such weapons had exist­ed in Iraq, Bush said he would "wait until Charlie [Duelfer] gets back with the final report." 
In July, Bush said, "We have not found stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction," a sentence construction that kept alive the possibility the weapons might yet be discovered. 
On Thursday, the president used the clearest language to date nailing the question shut: 
"Iraq did not have the weapons that our intelligence believed were there," Bush said. His words placed the blame on U.S. intelligence agencies. 
In recent weeks. Cheney has glossed over the primary justifi­cation for the war, most often by simply not mentioning it. But in late January 2004, Cheney told reporters in Rome: "There's still work to be done to ascertain 
exactly what's 
there." 
Duelfer's report 
was presented Wednesday to senators and the public with less than four weeks left in a fierce presidential cam­paign dominated by questions about Iraq and the war on terror. 
In Bayonne, N.J.. Democratic vice presidential candidate John Edwards on Thursday called "amazing" Cheney's assertions that the Duelfer report justified rather than undermined Bush's decision to go to war. and he accused the Republican of using "convoluted logic." 
Kerry, in a campaign appear­ance in Colorado, said: "The president of the United States and the vice president of the United States may well be the last two people on the planet who won't face the truth about Iraq." · 
A short time later. while cam­paigning in Wisconsin, Bush angrily responded to Kerry's charge he sought to "make up" a reason for war. 
"He's claiming misled America about weapons when he, himself. ·cited the very same intelligence about Saddam weapons programs as the reason he voted to go to war," Bush said. Citing a lengthy Kerry quote from two years ago on the menace Saddam could pose, Bush said: "Just who's the one trying to mis­lead the American people?" 
ETHIOPIA 


Blair explores problems in Africa 
Prime minister calls for international action against poverty 
Associated Press 

ADDIS ABABA -.. British Prime Minister Tony Blair ­bedeviled by Iraq and in search of a more positive lega­cy-called Thursday for con­certed international action to finally address the crises afflicting Africa, the only conti­nent to have grown poorer over the last 40 years. 
Britain is preparing to use its upcoming chairmanship of the G-8 group of industrialized nations to spearhead the effort, and at a conference to discuss African's future, Blair pressed the international com­munity to raise $150 million to help those caught up in vio­lence in Sudan's Darfur region. 
Blair also said Britain plans to train 20,000 African peace­keepers over the next fi.ve years to boost the continent's ability to respond to conflicts like that in Darfur -where pro-government Arab militia have been raiding African vil­lages, killings tens of thou­sands and pushing more than one million from their homes. 
Poverty and weak govern­ments make Africa fertile ground for terrorists. Blair warned. 
The British prime minister was in Ethiopia to chair a meeting of his Africa Commission, which he says 
· will spell out what Africa needs to develop and explain what has held it back. The commission's findings are expected in time for Britain's G-8 presidency and the leader­ship of the European Union later in 2005. "Next year will be the year of decision for Africa and the international community," Blair told the commission, 
whose members include Band Aid star Bob Geldof. Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa and Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi. "The time for excuses will be over." 
But Blair acknowledged that Africa likely will still need out­side help. 
"There will be times when Africa cannot stop a conflict on its-own," he said, suggest­ing a EU rapid-reaction force being set up could respond to a crisis in Africa if African peacekeepers fail to stem future problems. The EU force could be on the ground and ready to go in 10 days, he said. 
Troops may help provide peace, but prosperity will depend on the United States and Europe giving Africans the chance to earn their way out of poverty and slashing farm subsidies would be a good start, experts said.

For the second consecutive October meeting, the Board of the liability factor for the University is apparent.

Council. This year, the Board forcefully told current president Adam Istvan the major point of his report, the Safe Bus, is not a realistic or feasible idea. 
For the second year in a row, student gov­ernment wasted a precious opportunity to work with the Board on issues concerning the student body. 
Looking on the surface, the suggestion of having a method of off-campus transportation bringing students· from local housing complexes and bars back safely to their residences, whether on or off-campus, seems to be a valuable option for students. Off-campus safety is an issue many students take for granted because of the Notre Dame bubble, but being proactive in this area is much better than being reactive. 
However, delving deeper into the SafeBus idea reveals that it is impractical and not something that should have been presented to the B-oard of Trustees. 
Istvan projected the cost at $24,000 per year -and a trustee called it a significant understatement. With a large number of intoxicated college students traveling together,

Sister Florin has been living here, in the rural eastern edge of the state of Uttar Pradesh, India, for a number of years. Her work is rural development, community organizing, the sowing of seeds of liberation: both the simple and complex tasks of aiding others as they lift the burdens of pover­ty. Today she is simply telling a story. 
The group listens eagerly as Sister Florin describes the efforts of another community of women, from an even poorer village, who joined forces to improve the road leading to and from their town. The new road now plays an important role in their self-directed ini­tiatives for economic development. The women with whom I sit gain hope as they hear the story. I see the slow dissi­pation of the certainty that their own task -encouraging the village's upper­caste leader to turn a piece of commu­nalland into a community center-is an impossible one. Their efforts already enabled them to prevent this same leader from giving the land to a wealthy individual.

Before taking the SafeBus idea back to Student Senate and the CLC, Istvan and his top staff need to reevaluate this proposal. Recognizing it as being unrealistic as it currently stands allows student government to work on other ideas, like those praised by the Board Thursday. 
Time with the Board of Trustees is valuable. Squandering away an opportunity like Istvan did Thursday cannot hap­pen again. Last year, Jeremy Lao learned from Hallahan' s October mistake and presented two reports praised by the Board in February and April. 
For the second year in a row, student government needs to learn from its mistake and not waste the rest of its time with the Board.

How to watch the debates 
The role of the presidential debates in determin­ing the winner of the election is often overstat~d. Some journalists have entertained claims that the vice presidential debates could play an important role in the election this year. For example, USA Today reported this week that the Vice Presidential debate this Daniel Bergan year could play a "pivotal role in who becomes president." 
Not likely. Even Lloyd 

Guest Column 
Bensten's drubbing of Dan Quayle in 1988 did not result in a major change in the polls. (Dan Quayle is no Jack Kennedy. Bensten pointed this out for vice presiden­tial debate viewers and for Quayle himself that night). The effects of the presidential debates are slightly larger than the Vice Presidential debates, but the effects are not very large, nor are they long lasting. Candidates who perform well in the debates can expect at most a 3 to 4 percent bump in the polls; this small bump does not seem to last more than a week, much less until election day. 
There are a number of reasons that the presiden­tial debates do not play a major role in determining the victor. Prior to the debates, about two-thirds 'of the electorate had already made up its mind about the campaign. In addition, perceptions of who wins the debates are strongly influenced by one's party identification and political predispositions. Finally, despite the fact that polls vary a bit during the cam­paign, voters tend to behave in a relatively pre­dictable way come November. That is, debates and other campaign events may affect the polls during the campaign, but by November-barring a cata­clysmic event -it is most likely the economy, the party leanings and demographic characteristics of the electorate that determine voting behavior. 
That said, those watching the debates should keep a number of things in mind. The first is to watch out for misleading statements; we can anticipate these from statements the candidates make while on the campaign trail. With respect to jobs, President George W. Bush talks about the number of jobs cre­
vJ·!i:f,~~1last.,year;1 ignoring tne net Job loss during his tetlin: ·oem'ohatic p~esidential candidate Jotin Kerry makes the job loss seem larger than it is by focusing on one sector of the economy. Debate viewers should rely on fact checks in the next day's papers. For last Thursday's debates, the New York Times, Los Angeles Times and Washington Post all checked the accuracy of statements made in the debates. Viewers should also remember that while each debate format technically takes about 90-minutes, the debate does not truly end until days later. This 
is because at the close of each debate, journalists, pundits and now bloggers begin to formulate their own interpretations of the debates; some of these focus on fact checking while others focus on character traits. I would rec­ommend strong caution in using the latter interpretations of the debate..Consider that the candi­dates have spent a lot of time prepping for the debates and exhibit body language that is highly. rehearsed (e.g. Bush's furrowing his brow, John Edwards' thousand watt smile). Perhaps someone high­ly trained in body lan­guage might be able to catch some telling signs in this behavior, but I doubt most 
journalists can. During the 1992 town-hall style debates, George H. 
W. Bush glanced at his watch on camera. Critics drew the les­son that he was arro­gant. An interview with Jim Lehrer vears later suggested that this behavior doesn't tell us much about the former president's behavior other than that he does not like debates and was eager for it to end. 
Journalists often interpret the candidate's statements during the debates as revealing underlying character traits. Hpwever, these interpretations 
·reveal more about the journalists' perceptions of the candidates than the candidates themselves. In the 2000 cam­paign, Gore said in the first debate that a girl in Sarasota had to stand during class because of school overcrowding; he had been given a copy of the Sarasota Herald-Tribune story about the student from the girl's father. The press checked the story and found that what Gore had said during the debate was inaccurate-the girl no longer had to stand at the time of the debate, so what Gore had 
said, whHe truthful, was literally false. Similar sto­ries were used to illustrate that Gore was dishonest while Bush's statements didn't receive the same scrutfny; this is perhaps because Gore was perceived prior to the 
debates as insincere. While there were few such interpretations of last week's 
debate, there may be greater opportunity for this type of

MTV's Gideon Yago comes to campus 
S T 0 R Y BY 
MO L L Y 
t's not easy for anyone to get the kind of life_ experi­ence of which Gideon Yago can boast. 
At the age of 26, Yago has 
accomplished· what most 
news anchors have to wait 
a lifetime to achieve. He has interviewed important politicians, spent time in the Middle East as a correspondent for MTV and hosted a number of specials on hot-button issues such as drug addiction and sex laws. In spite of his youth, he has had an interesting and varied career that has focused not only on politics, but also entertainment and other areas of the media world. 
Gideon Yago was born in Madison, Wis. and attended Columbia University in New York as an under­graduate. Yago's first appearance on MTV was as a winning contestant on the MTV game show Idiot Savant dur­ing his freshman year of college, and he returned as a senior to apply at a career fair. Yago began his work at MTV as a writer and correspondent for "Choose or Lose" 2000 and worked on the McCain and Bush­Cheney campaigns, and he has worked for the network for four 
years. 
Since his start on the campaign trail, Yago has interviewed a host of impor­tant political figures including President George W. Bush, Secretary of State Colin Powell, Halph Nader, Senator John Kerry, former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani and Ambassador Paul Bremer. As an MTV correspondent, he acts as the voice of the newer generation of voters and asks questions-that have greater rele­vance to their lives, such as college tuition and the job market. Along with his political interviews, Yago has been a key figure in the MTV "Choose or Lose" campaign 
G R I F F I N 
aimed at making younger voters more informed about campaign issues and getting them to the polls for the upcoming presidential election. Recent specials have included "Louder Now!" which is the story cen­tered on Yago and a young soldier on the campaign trail; "20 Million Questions for John· Kerry," which brought viewers' questions to the presidential candidate; and "Work It," a special on the how the job market and outsourcing affect younger work­ers that featured news legend Walter Cronkite in his first MTV appearance ever. 
Yago has been one of MTV's major· correspondents _in the Middle East during the conflict in the area. Immediately after the Iraq war began, he filmed "The Diary of Gideon in Kuwait'~ while on location in Kuwait City. lie returned to the area in 2003 to film "The Diary of Gideon in Baghdad," which followed the lives of young Iraqis and American soldiers to see how the war was affecting them. 
Aside from his work in the political arena, Yago has ha_d a varied and interesting career. He has worked on specials like "Behind the Grammys" {2004} and "MTV Video Music Awards Opening Act" (2001.-2003). He was named on of the "25 Hottest Stars Under 25" last year by Teen People Magazine, and he toured with the band, Radiohead, in 2001. 
Besides working as a news anchor, Yago writes for MTVNews.com and has provided pieces for Spin, Vice and Nylon. 
Yago will be speaking at Washington Hall on Oct. 10th at 7:30 p.m. Tickets are available at the LaFortune Box office and cost $2 for students and $5 for faculty and staff.

Coming off a 6-0 victory over top-ranked Breen Phillips, Walsh looks to contin­ue its winning ways and ride the momentum into the play­offs. The Pyros simply hope to avoid a winless season. 
The Wild Women will look to continue to use the two main weapons, which have led them to this point: a suffocating defense and an agile quarter­back. In the game against Breen Phillips, Walsh capital­ized off of two interceptions by senior Katie Hesmond and also used an impressive 100­yard rushing performance by freshman quarterback Mary Sullivan to win. 
In their last game, the Pyros continued to struggle as they were shut out 19-0 by the then-winless McGlinn Shamrocks. The Shamrock ul'fense had little trouble elud­ing a porous Pasquerilla East defense. while the Pyro attack struggled. having trouble even smelling the end zone.

Team expected to excel in championship meet 
By ANN LOUGHERY 
Sports Wmer 
Mark Hamilton said opponents competing at the MIAA Championships this weekend will see Saint Mary's running on all cylinders. 
In their last tournament of the fall season, Hamilton said, the Belles should be at the top of their games and post impressive num­bers. 
"I think it will be exciting to see what we can do when we're play­ing at our peak," Hamilton said. "We just need to stay relaxed and in the zone." 
Saint Mary's already holds a 47­stroke lead and a first-place con­ference rank going into the tour­nament as a result of their hard work earlier this season. Their conference counterparts expect nothing less than a challenge this weekend. 
"I think the other teams know that we're going to come out and play well," Hamilton said. "Everyone knows we're the team to beat -we're the marked man." 
In addition to team honors, the

Belles look to collect individual

look to earn a place on the first

Hamilton believes the team will 
be ready for any challenges they 
will encounter this weekend. He 
cited the team's solid perform­
ance last weekend, despite the 
rigorous course, as proof of the 
team's ability to excel this week­
end. 
"This weekend's course has a lot of similarities to the course we played on last weekend," Hamilton said. "That's one of the reasons we scheduled that tour­nament last weekend." 
Of utmost importance, Hamilton said, the team must show its abili­ty to keep a level head under the pressure. He hopes the Belles will approach this meet as if it were a normal, regular season meet. 
"We're trying not to get too jazzed up for it, but at the same time, we are excited to hoist the team banner in the gym if we win," Hamilton said.

WOMEN'S INTERHALL GOLD LEAGUE 
Badin and Lyons square off 
By TOM DORWART, RAMA 
GOTTUMUKKALA and KATE 
SERYAK 
Spores Wrirers 

Two teams meet at 4 p.m. Sunday at McGlinn fields, and only one of them advances to the playoffs. In a must-win game for both squads. the 3-2 defending champions from Badin take on the 2-1-2 Lyons Lyons. 
"We're not ready for our sea­son to be over," Badin wide receiver and running back Meg Charlebois said. "It's a huge game, and we're going to give it all we've got." 
Badin heads into the final game of the regular season com­ing off a 13-7 loss to Welsh Family, while Lyons skids into the do-or-die contest after failing to score in each of its past two games. 
"We're looking to pul some big points on the board," Lyons offensive lineman Laura Riebschleger said. 
That goal might be tough to accomplish against an aggres­sive Badin defense. 
"The defense is going to con­tinue its level of intensity and will look for turnovers," Badin linebacker Christina O'Donnell said. 
After barely missing the 2003 playoffs, Lyons upperclassmen said they would use their experi­ence as motivation for the final game. 
"We don't want to be in that situation again," junior line­backer Mosey Nuccio said. 
Looking to rebound from a one-touchdown loss to Welsh Family, Badin continues its quest to defend its interhall title.

more is going to win it, and we've worked too hard this sea­son to lie down now," O'Donnell said. Howard vs. Off-Campus 
The teams at the bottom of the women's gold league standings have labeled their upcoming game the "showdown of the los­ers." Winner takes all -a single win and bragging rights. 
Howard (0-3-1) and Off­Campus (0-4) are both planning to leave it all on the field on Sunday at 5 p.m. at the West Quad field as one of them will get that elusive first win. 
"I talked to a few of the girls from off-campus and we decided this was like the showdown of the losers because we're both at the bottom of the brackets," Howard captain Callie Whelan said. "So we're excited to see who can be the best of the worst." 
But do not expect this match to be meaningless. After being overmatched by top teams like Welsh Family and Badin, Howard and Off-Campus will finally have the opportunity to face an opponent of similar stature to duke it out for the slot directly above last place in the division. 
Of the two teams, Howard has enjoyed greater success this sea­son based solely on its tie against Welsh Family, the No. 1 team in the division. With at least one good game under their belt, the Ducks will look to end their season on a positive note. 
"Across the board. our offense has really come together and our defense has too," Whelan said. "The whole team has really come together and it'll be excit­
ing to play a team of equal cal­iber." 
Off-Campus has been taking a much more relaxed path during this season. 
"We're really trying to improve our offense and our defense," Off-Campus captain Lauren Blum said. "We really seem to have plateaued at terrible. So maybe we can climb ofT that." 
Lewis vs. Welsh Family 

Four years ago, Lewis and Welsh met for the flag football championship game. Welsh Family won by a point, and thus began the rivalry between the two teams. 
They weren't in the same league following the stadium showdown, but now, after two years, the teams will meet in regular season play. 
"We've had a long standing rivalry with them," Welsh Family captain Mary Prendergast said. "I was there four years ago when we beat them in the stadium. It doesn't really matter what their record is -it's a big game and we are really geared up to play in it" 
Welsh Family has been ofT to a great start this year with a record of 3-0-1. The Whirlwinds are currently undefeated, but Lewis certainly has the motiva­tion to do it 
"This is the first time we've seen them in regular season play in two years," Lewis Captain Julia Burke said. "I just missed the stadium game by a year, but I've heard about it sev­eral times. Both teams are intense and get really geared up for the game."

Irish stick with what works in weekend matches 
Brown decides to keep last weekend's changes to the lineup after win 
By ANN LOUGHERY Sports Writer 
As the old saying goes, if something isn't broken, don't fix it. 
In last weekend's mate h against Syracuse, Carolyn Cooper made her first start and stepped in at middle blocker. 
The junior made quite an impression, chipping in seven blocks and a ·personal season­high three kills in one of Notre Dame's strongest defensive per­formances of the season. 
The Irish will stick with Cooper at middle blocker when they travel to face Rutgers [11-4] and Seton Hall [6-12]. 
"[Cooper] brings a lot of ener­gy to the court," coach Debbie Brown said. "We got the result we hoped we would from putting her in." 
Brown hopes Cooper will have a similar impact this weekend, beginning with Saturday's match against Rutgers. 

Last weekend, Rutgers com­peted in the Big East Challenge and defeated Villanova in the consolation match 26-30, 30-21, 25-30, 30-26, 15-13. Scarlet Knights sophomore Lora Tankauskas looks to be an offen­sive threat, as last weekend she led Rutgers with a team-high 18 kills. Rutgers senior Abbey Martin's match-high 59 assists are numbers that would intimi­date most teams. 
But Brown believes the Irish are ready for any challenges Rutgers might send their way. 
"Neither [Rutgers or Seton Hall] has players we can't han­dle," Brown said. "We just can't beat ourselves by having unforced errors." 
Seton Hall's setter Shawn McDonald looks to provide many of the offensive challenges the Irish will encounter on Sunday. 
The senior collected her 4,000th assist in Tuesday's win against Fordham, recording a match-high 40 assists and 11 digs. After Tuesday's match, Seton Hall remains undefeated at home. 

Despite the Irish opponents' impressive accolades, Brown believes Notre Dame is capable of notching wins at both Big East ­Conference matches this week­end. 
"We need each individual to be consistent with their play and we need to have the whole team on the same page." Brown said. "With any team we play, we have to anticipate that they'll have career matches against us."

Pangborn defeats Howard in fourth straight win 
By BRIAN CARDILE, RYAN 
KIEFER, and JOHN EVERETT 
Sporrs Wrirers 

The Pangborn Phoxes contin­ued their winning ways Thursday, using a strong offen­sive performance to top the inexperienced Howard Ducks, 27-6. The victory-Pangborn's fourth straight -puts them in good shape heading toward the postseason. 
It took only one play for the prolific Phox offense to assert itself, as quarterback Katie Mooney connected with a streaking receiver for a 30-yard strike on the first play from scrimmage. After another first down, the Phoxes displayed their versatility as Mooney ran around the left end and, after drawing the defense, pitched the ball to tailback Trish Donelly. who ran it in for a score. 
A completed pass on the point after attempt gave the Phoxes a 7-0 lead, a lead they would not relinquish. 
Despite the early deficit, the Ducks didn't fold, responding on their first drive with an impres­sive quarterback draw that went 50 yards for the score. The touchdown brought the Ducks to within a point and gave them new hope. 
But this hope was short-lived, as the Phoxes immediately countered with a touchdown on the first play of the ensuing drive. Mooney optioned this time to tailback Brynn Johnson, who eluded countless Ducks on her way to a 70-yard score. 
The dual tailback set gave the Howard Defense trouble all night. The Ducks often diq not know who had the ball. 
"We practiced hard all year on the handoffs," Pangborn coach Doug Cionni said. "[The dual tailback formation] has really picked up." 
The Phoxes added two more scores in the second half­another option from Mooney to Donelly and a quarterback keeper late in the game -to seal the 27-6 win. Lewis 35, Off-Campus 0 
The Lewis Chicks made it clear from the start that they were a class above Off-Campus Thursday night as they cruised to a 35-0 victory. 
The tone was set early on for Lewis. 
On the second play from scrimmage, the Chicks (2-2-1) executed a hook-and-ladder play to perfection, covering 58 yards for the first of their five touchdowns. Quarterback Tiffany Roberts completed a short out pattern to Kara Bailey who lateralled the ball to Jocelyn Moya. Maya ran the rest of the way down the side­line for the score. 
Roberts was just getting start­ed as she had a hand in all the touchdowns. She had touch­down runs of 10, 11 and 63 yards as well as two passing touchdowns. Maya was the pri­mary receiving target as she had two touchdowns, including one on the hook and ladder play. 


The Chick offense was as effi­cient as it was effective. None of the five scoring drives lasted longer than three plays. 
"[Our team was] an offensive juggernaut tonight," Lewis coach Jay Murphy said. Welsh Family 13, Badin 7 
The Whirlwinds of Welsh Family turned up the pressure defensively and used an impres­sive air attack to beat the Badin Bullfrogs and run their record to a sterling 4-0-1. 
Welsh Family was coming off a tie to Howard that cancelled their run at perfection. In that game, dropped passes were the major problem for the Whirlwinds. That was much less of a problem against Badin. 
Quarterback Melissa Sands connected with wide receiver Lauren Heck for two touch­downs, accounting for both scores. The first touchdown came on a five-yard pass to the corner of the end zone, capping off a long, sustained drive. The extra point was scored, and Welsh led 7-0. 
For much of the rest of the game, defensive stands and field position were the keys to the Whirlwinds' success. 22Badin's quarterback Stephanie Heath was forced to scramble often due to the pock­et repeatedly collapsing. Heath made the most of these situa­tions, ga1mng significant yardage on many of her runs. 
When Heath did have enough time to pass, she spread the ball around fairly effectively. Wide receivers Ashley O'Keefe and Lizzi Shappell made several impressive catches. Shappell, known as "Mo Sto" for her com­parative resemblance in height to Maurice Stovall, used her height to her advantage on sev­eral balls. 
The Whirlwinds made several fourth-down stops, including two when Badin was inside the red zone, one on fourth-and goal. Badin, backed by an extremely boisterous crowd on its sideline, made several drives in attempt to tie the score. all in vain. 

After one such drive pinned Welsh Family deep in its own territory, Sands and Heck made their second connection, as Heck slipped pass the defense and scampered about 70 yards for the score that broke the Bullfrogs' back. 
Badin never stopped trying to score, and with the aid of a bull-rushing penalty on the Welsh Family defensive line that negated a Whirlwind inter­ception, they scored their lone touchdown with under two min­utes left in the game. 
On a fourth-down, Heath rolled out and hit Ashley O'Keefe in the right corner. The Bullfrogs got the extra point to close within six, but the Whirlwinds ran one more play to end the game.

Adrian 
continued from page 28 
One of the keys to Tuesday's win was the strong play of the bench. which continued to build the team's lead as almost every player made it onto the field. The Belles will look for similar 
play  against  Adrian  on  
Saturday.  
"We've  had a lot  of tight  

games; it's not often we get to empty the bench, to let the kids 
who work equally hard in prac­tice get on to the field," MacKenzie said. "The great thing about this team is its cohesion; the players who start and the ones who are support­ing from the sidelines are all on the same page. The bench play­ers have been awesome in accepting their roles, and mak­ing the most of their time on the field." 
It has been that cohesion, which had been missing in past years, that has pushed the Belles to a higher level this sea­son. 
"We're not going to win the MIAA without utilizing our play­ers," MacKenzie said. "Having only the 11 players on the field is not going to win this confer­ence. It's important that all · these kids get some experience and the opportunity to develop so that they can get in the flow." 
No matter who makes it on to the field on Saturday, the Belles hope they can continue their recent surge in scoring. Tuesday's·eight goals equaled the total combined scoring of the previous five games for Saint Mary's, but they will face a talented goalie tandem on Saturday. 
"They [Adrian] are a pretty good squad, and made us work hard last time, but their goalies are their strength," MacKenzie said. "Their goalies played ter­rific games against as the first time. Weprobably had 30 shots on goal against them last time, and we were only able to score three goals. We'll need to figure out how to put the ball in the back of the net." 

As the Belles open up the sec­ond half of their season, they .. will look to be more consistent in their scoring than they were in the first half in order to have a shot at the MIAA crown. 
"The results ... the other day will help motivate our kids to find the back of the net," MacKenzie said. "We don't want to get urgent, but hopefully the

Tri-State game will give us the confidence we need ... to score."

In Friday's 4 p.m. match-up against Villanova. the Irish face a defensive oriented team. Much like Providence last Sunday, Notre Dame's opponent will sit back in its own end with the sole purpose of halting the Irish offense. 
Waldrum feels the Irish can turn the Wildcats' philosophy into an advantage. 
"Right now we've got a differ­ent kind of an attacking team and I think it's better suited for teams that drop back and try to defend against us," he said. 
Georgetown, under new head coach Dave Nolan, will pose the challenge of unfamiliarity.

Notre Dame will have to adjust to a system they have not yet scouted. Having to react to an unfamiliar style of play will help the Irish work on their biggest weakness, defending the counterattack. 
"We know that we need to get on top first," Chapman said, "(but] when we go on the attack and they have a quick counterattack, that's the biggest thing we need to work on." 
Waldrum will also look for one of his goaltenders to emerge as the premier starter on the team. 
"I would like to still [rotate] if I can," he said. "We might split position, the Irish appear to be games, we might split halves or hitting on all cylinders.

forwards looked good as well. This was a real all-around effort by the team tonight." 
Poulin was concerned about how the Irish would respond to rule changes instituted by the NCAA this year, in which refer­ees were asked to be more dili­gent in calling penalties. Those changes materialized in the final stats, with a total of 23 penalties called between the two teams, including two major penalties of five minutes. 
Notre Dame's penalty kill was 1-for-12 on the night. while Minnesota-Duluth finished the game 1-for 11.

The Panthers were able to hold a sharpshooting Irish offense to Megna's lone goal well into the second period. 
"I thought that the first half we actually played very well," coach Bobby Clark said. "We actually went into a lull in the second half ... in the second half I felt we didn't get quite into that rhythm." 
The battle for goals was aggressive, as referees stopped play a number. of times for fouls. Although Pittsburgh gave up fouls that put the Irish in prime scoring position, they managed to stifle Notre Dame's scoring attempts. 

penalty kill team member Jason Paige said. "We not only have to take pride in our penal­ty kill. but it's something we have to excel at." 
Penalties against both teams helped lead to Notre Dame's first goal, as Josh Sciba scored into the first period while the teams skated four-on-four. 

The Bulldogs came right back a little more than three min­utes later when Minnesota­Duluth bounced the puck off the end boards and it came right back to Josh Miskovich, 
"Set plays we've spent a lot of time on-we should be good at them," Clark said. "I think for some reason tonight we didn't quite get the service where we wanted them and I don't know why." 
It was one weak spot for an otherwise strong squad who forced goalie Chris Sawyer to make only two saves. In the season's 11 games, one of the

The Irish came back in the second with their first power play goal of the season. McLean skated the puck in from the left boards and wrist­ed a low shot short side from the left face-off dot to beat Minnesota-Duluth goalie Isaac Reichmuth. 
Notre Dame tried to maintain its lead in the third period, but a five-minute major and game misconduct by freshman for­ward Victor Oreskovich gave Minnesota-Duluth a long power play and the Bulldogs took advantage with 7:33 left in the game. 
From behind Cey's net, Evan Schwabe made a perfect cen­tering pass to Tim Stapleton, who beat the Irish goalie top shelf as he tried to slide over from the post to make the save.

Against a Minnesota-Duluth team with 11 seniors, it was the Irish upperclassmen who played biggest of all.

Make it four straight shutouts for Notre Dame, four Big Ea"st wins and four goals in the past two games for forward Tony Megna. 
The No. 9 Irish are finding their rhythm as they slash through their 

coach Dave Poulin said. "[Minnesota-Duluth] had a Jot of seniors coming back and they certainly merit their rank­ing." 
The Irish open the season hoping to return to the NCAA tournament after making their first tournament appearance in team history last year. Two fac­tors helped lead to Notre Dame's successful NCAA bid­a competitive non-conference schedule and a solid home record. 
The Irish are off to a good start in both respects this sea­son, as they either won or tied at the Joyce Center for the 15th straight regular season game dating back to the team's home-opening loss to Bowling Green last season. 
Another reason for Notre Dame's success in the 2003-04 season was solid goaltending, and that has also continued so far this season. Cey was espe­cially strong in the third period and overtime, when the Irish were outshot 23-9. 
"I felt well out there," Cey said. "Some people were won­dering how we were going to replace our veteran defense from last year and I thought our defense did a remarkable job out there tonight.

-October schedule, leaving a trail of defeated opponents in their wake. A rock-solid defense and lightning-quick offense sent Pittsburgh home with a 3­0 loss Thursday night and improved the team to 8-2-1 on the season. 
"Ever since we lost the game to West Virginia ... every Big East game we're really brought up the intensity," Megna said. "We don't want to lose another one of those. Overall we did pretty good-we had the chance, scored the goals [and] got the shutout." 
The Irish dominated play in the first half but were unable to find the back of the net until Megna hit a shot in the 38th minute to put the team ahead 1-0 gojng into the half. 
"Justin Mr.Geeney just turned and played a ball into me," Megna said. "I basically turned and I sort of took a bad touch. I lost ft, got back up, beat the defender there, turned towards

Women play Villanova, Georgetown 
By MATT MOONEY Spons Writer 
When a team is undefeated and ranked No. 1 in the country, it is easy to understand how the group might begin to feel complacent. 
But coach Randy. Waldrum is deter­
mined not to let that happen to his Irish squad, especially this weekend. 

"We've gone through this before, we did this last year going unde­feated," he said. "I think [we learned] that, going undefeated and losing three of your last five last year, 
you can't overlook things." 
Top-ranked Notre Dame (12-0-0, 5­0-0 Big East) again takes its act on the road, trying not to overlook the chal­lenge of Big East opponents Villanova (9-3-0, 3-2-0) and Georgetown (5-5-0, 2-1-0). 
"Going on the road in the Big East, that in itself is a big enough problem," Waldrum said. 
Despite the challenges, the perfect start has Notre Dame players feeling very confident about their performance level. 
"We've just been working really well as a team," forward/defender Candace Chapman said. "If we work together, we're better than any team out there."

By RYAN DUFFY Sports Writer 

The Belles are hoping to start ofT the second half of their sea­son the same way they started ofT the first half -with a win against Adrian. 
After exploding for eight goals in Tuesday's 8-1 win over Tri­State University, Saint Mary's will look to continue their strong play when they face Adrian at home on Saturday. 
"This is our second game 
against Adrian, and they're coming to us this time," coach Caryn MacKenzie said. "It's nice to have the advantage of two home games in a row; this is the only time all year that hap­pens." 
While the Belles sit in second place in the MIAA standings, Adrian is at the bottom, having not won a single game all year. In their first meeting back on Sept. 11, the Belles looked good all around in a 3-0 shutout. 
"We're feeling confident com­ing off Tu~sday's win; we're just going to have to play our kind of soccer on our field," MacKenzie said. "Adrian's going to have to bring a different look than what they showed us earlier in the year."

Passing his test 
Irish quarterback Brady Quinn has been a big reason for an improved passing game 
By JOE HETTLER Sports Wri[er 
Before every football game, 
Brady Quinn takes a shot. 
Of honey, that is. 
Notre Dame's second-year 
quarterback has kept the same 
pre-game ritual since third · 
grade. 
"Usually, I'll come in about 20 minutes before the game and about then I'll take a shot or a good amount of honey ... my uncle told me 'Take it before a game, it gives you some extra energy' and I've been doing it every since," Quinn said. "It's kind of tradition." 
As the Irish quarterback, Quinn is hoping to follow another kind of tradition ­that of the great Notre Dame. signal-:callers before him. Players like Montana, Theismann and Mirer have already proven themselves under center, and Quinn hopes to eventually add his own name to that impressive list. 
Quinn knows he has a long journey ahead before being compared to those Irish leg­ends. But midway through his sophomore season, the Dublin, Ohio, native is showing progress from when he started nine games as a freshman in 2003. Like· any team, the 2004 Irish will continue relying on their quarterback's decision­making and productivity to help 
tally victories for the remainder of the season. Quinn knows what's expected of him and says he's ready for the chal­lenges. 
"It's important to have goals . every season and every week," he said. "Individually, I'm try­ing to become a better leader. That's something I'm trying to stress and to keep trying to improve on the little things." Thrown into the fire 
Quinn had plenty of choices for college. Throwing for 2,149 yards, 25 touchdowns and just four interceptions opens up doors for any high school quar­terback. Of the more than 30 schools that recruited him, 
Quinn narrowed his options to 
three -Notre Dame, Michigan 
and Ohio State. · 
It didn't take the Dublin 
Coffman High School star long 
to make a final choice. 
"The decision was based on 
the overall feeling I got here," 
said Quinn, who committed 
early in the recruiting process. 
"[Head] coach [Tyrone] 
Willingham, the coaching staff 
and the players gave me the 
impression that [Notre Dame] 
was some place I saw myself 
going." 
While recruiting Quinn, Willingham told the young quarterback what he tells every recruit -the best player will play. 
"He told me, 'You'll have an opportunity," Quinn said. "He didn't say anything else ­where I was to play, whatever it was. I just took that and tried to do my best and work myself into that role." 
It didn't take Quinn long to see his first game action as a freshman. When Notre Dame quarterback Carlyle Holiday left the opening game against Washington State for a few plays with an injury, Quinn got the call. He didn't do too much, just handed the ball off to run­ning back Julius Jones. But the drive resulted in a touchdown, and Quinn got his first taste of the field. 
The next week, during a 38-0 drubbing to Michigan, Quinn entered the game late and threw his first pass. He finished the game 3-for-1 0 with an interception. 
After seeing significant play­ing time in a loss to Michigan State, Quinn was named the starter for the Purdue game. In that 23-10 Irish defeat, the Notre Dame offense couldn't run the ball at all, forcing Quinn to throw 59 passes -the second most in school history. Quinn started the final eight games, finishing the season with 1,831 passing yards, nine touchdowns and 15 intercep­tions, as Notre Dame struggled to a 5-7 mark. But for Quinn, the season wasn't a total loss. 

"It was just something that when you're the quarterback, you're. going to have some good games and bad," he said. "There will be times when you get hit a lot and games where you don't get hit or touched at all, so you just have to go with the flow, with the good and bad. 
"But I thought it was a good experience for me. Obviously I've learned a lot over the past year." 
Making his strides 

In 2004, Notre Dame players and fans expected the entire Irish team to show significant improvement after a dismal 2003 season. But against Brigham Young in the opening game, the Irish fell flat in a 20­17 loss. 
Quinn managed to finish the game 26-for-47 for 256 yards and one touchdown, but Notre Dame's offense was anemic for most of the game. The stats weren't important; the final result was. 
"It's frustrating to the stand­point you always look to see what you could have done bet­ter to get things done," Quinn said. "Statistically, maybe it was a good game. But a good game comes to down to win­ning and losing, regardless of the stats. That's how you grade yourself, so any time you don't get a win, that's extremely frus­trating in itself." 
But Quinn, along with an impressive game from fresh­man tailback Darius Walker, led Notre Dame to a critical vic­tory against then-No. 8 Michigan the next week. In the win against Michigan State, Quinn and ti1e offense began to click even more. After the win, Irish offensive lineman Dan Stevenson credit­ed Quinn with leading the offense and helping the unit mesh together during the first few games of the season. · "You need somebody who can take charge of the huddle and typically that position is given to the quarterback just because he's calling the plays and call­ing the shots," Stevenson said. "He comes in there with a lot more confidence. He knows what he's doing and he's not afraid to make the calls." Quinn helped the offense fol­low its Michigan State perform­ance with a trouncing of Washington, where the quar­terback tossed four touchdown passes in the first half, tying a Notre Dame Stadium record. Then last week, in a loss to Purdue, Quinn matched the Boilermakers' lleisman Trophy candidate Kyle Orton in every quarterback category, except touchdown passes. · Willingham said he has con­tinued seeing improvement from his sophomore quarter-· back. "I've said all along that I have a great deal of respect for Brady, his skill level, his leader­ship, his focus, his concentra­tion," the third-year Irish coach said. "I think we have an excel­lent quarterback to command our system. And I think he keeps getting more knowledgeable each day and I think he's driven to be the best." Still, Quinn seldom, if ever, 

you have to be your biggest critic," Quinn said. "You have to look for any little thing you can improve on, which will bet­ter yourself and, in turn, better the team." 
Eyeing his goals 
Quinn said, even before sign­ing with the Irish, that he understood the pressures of being the Notre Dame quarter­back. If the team does well, he gets much of the credit. If they struggle, he gets much of the blame. With either situation, Quinn was ready for the chal­lenge. 
"That's just being a quarter­back," he said. "Any time you assume that role, you have to realize the spotlight comes with it. All the stuff outside of play­ing football and watching film comes with it, so you just have to take the pressures of it and the different situations you may come into with it." 
Quinn said he still has many aspects of his game to work on for the remainder of-the 2004 season. He also has one over­riding objective to reach before 
his four years are finished at Notre Dame. 
"I just want to be more effi­cient in taking care of the foot­ball and become more consis­tent," he said. "Keep the chain moving; keep the offense flow­ing.... You always want to set goals for yourself. Obviously, a national championship is on [the goals list]. Trying to get these teams going undefeated and things like that." 
And what if Quinn does lead an Irish team to the national title? Eating honey may become a new trend.

·an average of 2.8 yards per carry and just two touchdowns rushing. Goolsby has been all over the field for the Irish so far this season, with 45 tackles in five games. 
Lemon averages 6.9 yards per carry, and had a key 82-yard run against USC that gave Stanford a tempo­rary lead. The Cardinal as a team average 4.0 yards per carry and, like the lri'ih, use a multiple-back offense, with Tolon complementing th~ starter Lemon. 
Notre Dame has shown.:.lt can shut down the oppo­nent's rushing offense all ­season, and there's no; reason they shouldn't do' the same against Stanford. Lemon andj Tolon are both gor.d' backs, but the ltish def'P.nse ,mibetter. -,Ji,

DEFENSE 
CARDINAL 
PASSING 
t 

The Irish cornerbacks are hurting after allow­ing four touchdowns against Orton and Purdue. Notre Dame's pass defense is currently the 11th-worst in the nation, giving up 1315 yards total so far this season. 
Edwards has a capable passing atta<~k. and mam­moth wideout Evans could cause problems for the Irish secondary. Stanford will be looking to exploit an Irish defensive backs unit that might still be embarrassed from being picked apart by Purdue. 
Edwards is a good quar­terback, but he's powhere near Orton's ability. Again~t Purdue; seyer<:tl passes·_ were just accurate throws against good Irish coverage. Notre Dame~s seeondary will be looking to redeem themselves against the Cardinal. 
SPECIAL TEAMS 
~ Fitzpatrick has continued to have a good season for the Irish, and even though he missed a field goal against Purdue, it was partially blocJ<-ed. Notre Dame's kick cover­age is horrible, with the Irish already allowing opponents to return two kickoffs for touchdowns. 
Sgroi is 3-for-6 for field goals, and Ottovegio is averaging just a little less than 40 yards per kick. Where Stanford excels is in the kick return game, where the Cardinal aver­ages 34.0 yards per kick­ofT return, the third-best average in the nation. 
The Irish have. been unim­pressive on special t$ms so far, and Stanthrd ha$ the ability to expltiit'Notre !)arne's poor kick ~rage. Purdue·s kiCkoff retUrn for a touchdown was a big turninl-ppip.~. _f}.P~~otre

INTANGIBLES 
Notre Dame hasn't lost at home to Stanford since 1992, and have yet to lose to a Teevens-coached Card­inal team. The Irish will be anxious to avenge their embar­rassing loss at home to Purdue. 
Teevens hasn't done much his first two years at Stanford, and a win against Notre Dame could really help his resume. There are still several players on this Cardinal team who played under Willingham, and they would love to beat their old coach. 
The Cardinal would love to break their own streak of futility at Notre Dame Stadium, but the Irish will bn ready to prove some­thing after being whacked at Jwmc by Purdue. Willingham has pressure as he's now expected to win out until Tennessee this year.

Oshiomogho Atogwe (above) and the Stanford defensive ba.cks have kept teams out of the end zone so far this sea.;on, allowing just two passing touch­downs so far this sea­son. 
The Cardinal allow 235 yards per game, but have six interceptions so far through two games. Atogwe is a solid player at free safety. having collected an interception and forced two fumbles so far this year.
