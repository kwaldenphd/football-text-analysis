Washington -The Wtite House announced Wednesday that Henry A. Kissinger would return to Paris next month for new talks with LeDuc Tho aimed at achieving "strict implementation" of the cease-fire agreement. Aides to Kissinger and Hanoi's cheif negotiator will begin preliminary discussions today (Thursday) to set the stage for the revived Paris talks scheduled for mid-May. 
Washington -The census Bureau disclosed that it had missed an estimated 5.3 million Americans in the 1970 head count, a 2.5 per cent oversight it called significantly smaller than errors in recent cen­suses. However, the Bureau conceded accurate figures have become more important since they are now used to calculate the distribution of federal funds. 
Washington-Vice President Agnew reaffirmed his faith in President Nixon, but conceded for the first time that some speculation on the Watergate scandal might eventually be substantiated. "If it is," Agnew told a hastily arranged news conference, "It must be con­fronted forthrightly." Itwas the Vice President's first public comment on Watergate since the campaign, and he refused to answer questions after reading his terse statement, which did little to reveal what Agnew thinks about the scandal. 
Washington -Watergate disclosures have apparently cost H.R. Haledman much of the power he once wielded with such efficiency as the White House Chief of Staff. Amid reports that a staff shakeup was in prospect, the White House Press Secretary disclosed that Haldeman had stopped conducting his regular morning meetings with top aids some three weeks ago-about the time, other sources emphasized, when important disclosu res in the Watergate case began to break.

HICCOUP questions effectiveness 
by John Rumbach Staff Reporter 
"H-man's Investigative Com­mitee" concerning "Cruel Or Unusual \ .Preregistration" is distributing questionaires to students during pre-registration to determine whether suggestions made by the committee for im­proved pre-registration procedures were successfully used. 
Mike Geisinger, chairman of HICCOUP, said yesterday that the questions will \ include inquiries into the availability of major courses to majors, the opportunity for students to get registration counseling and the justification of certain check-marked courses. 
HICCOUP had suggested to University departments that they provide ample counselors and ample time for counseling. They also suggested that the depart­ments mark courses that majors could register for before pre­registration. These courses were to be listed with an "M". 
Geisinger was disappointed that some of the departments did not implement HICCOUP's recom­mendations. "Either they did not want to use them or they were not 
aware of them soon enough." he 
said. 
Tonight at 10:00 on WSND's· Contact Notre Dame, a panel will discuss the problems o alcoholism. Joining WSND's Dave Barrett, Sheila Carney, and the Observer's Jerry Lutkus will be a reformed alcoholic, a South Bend doctor, and a university group therapist. 


Mike Geisinger 

The HICCOUP chairman also said that the final actions which came from the committee's suggestions were different than the original plans. 
Geisinger wasn't sure if the new procedures would work. "I hope that the questionaire will spot the defective areas," he said. 
Included in the original Hie­COUP plans was that all courses closed out during pre-registration were to be published in the Ob­server. Geisinger was· not sure if any action had been takenk>n this.­
" All of these things are being done experimentally. If it works we'll implement it further," he concluded. 
The Preprofessional Student Advisory Committee is currently accepting applications to fill positions on the committee for next year. Applicants need not be enrolled in the Preprofessional Department, but only interested in pursuing a career in a health­oriented field. 
Application forms may be picked up in the Preprofessional office and should be returned by May 4.

Currently there are ten students on the committee, which aims at improving student representation in the Preprofessional department. During its first year, the com­mittee has worked at evaluating a faculty report, and has worked with Chairman Fr. Joseph Walter to institute several departmentalreforms. 
Through conferences with Dr. Emil Hoffman and the Freshman Year Office, the committee has incorporated programs designed to provide needed information to students interested in the Preprofessional program. The committee's goal is to help ease the "trauma" many students experience during their Freshman year. 
Students are needed to fill six places on the committee, or to help coordinate communications between individual students or groups next year. Those interested shold contact Frank Banfield at 288-G803 or Tim Hayes at 6294 for further information.

Frivolous Friday will offer AnTostal even ·s 
by Bob Quakenbush Staff Reporter 

"Nobody throws a frolic like the Irish," claims Gregory T. Monito, author and editor of the An Tostal booklet, as well as one of the coordinators of tomorrow's third of the Notre Dame spring festival, Frivolous Friday. "This year's version of the frivolous sixth day of the weekis indeed fantastic." 
Another coordinator of the second day of An Tostal '73, Mike Lyons, said yesterday, "Frivolous Friday is most memorable for me. Two years ago on Frivolous Friday I spent the entire day in An Tostal's final kissing marathon. It was worth it-1 set a world kissing record fo ten hours and twenty minutes." 
Lyons, a senior and R.A. from Holy Cross Hall, explained why the kissing marathon is no longer part of An Tostal, saying "Its decency was called into question." Nevertheless, Frivolous Friday and all of its excitement are still here. 
Monito reported Friday's events begin at 2 p.m. on the South Quad with quarter pitching and jello toss competitions, to be conducted simultaneously. 
"We'd really like to see a lot of people compete in the Im­personation Contest at 2:30p.m.," said Monito, a senior from Lyons Hall. His partner, Mike Lyons, added, "Last year's champion, Kevin O'Neill, is working on some new, secret impersonations, and we'd hate to see his title go un­contested. 
They reported that "An Tostal Hall of Farner," Jim E. Brogan, is returning to Notre Dame to emcee· both the Impersonation Contest and the evening's amateur hour. 
The scramble for first place in the egg toss competition and the old tire race are scheduled for 3:30 
p.m. on the South Quad. 
Frivolous Friday's number one athletic attraction, the Bookstore Basketball Tournament Finals, is expected to draw an overflow crowd to the bookstore courts at 4:00p.m. The game features the finest two teams from a field of-102, and will be broadcast live on WSND. 
"Any team that getsps far as the finals is well worth watching," says Tom Smit'h, who along with his roommates, John Morin, Finn McDavid, and Pat Dwyer, along with the Observer's Lefty Rusch­mann, is primarily responsible for the entire tournament. The Breen­Phillips junior continued, "A lot volunteers refereed, kept score, and worked out schedules for the tourney, and I'm sure the best 
School to create 'philosophers· 
by Bill Sabin Staff Reporter 

Children have always seemed to have hated going to school, in­clud\ng most of us who are now sup;>fsedly seriously engaged in our own education. And it has probably always seemed that a lot more coud have been gained from that time had one wanted to learn, rather than having been forced to go. Magdalen School in South Bend is the kind of school you always wish you could have at­tended. 
Magdalen is a private, non­sectarian combination junior and senior high school, presently located in the First Christian Churcq, at the corner of Eddy and Jefferson. In its first year of existence, it has only twenty-one students; but it has a very high student-faculty ratio, about two to one, which it promises to keep. It was founded last summer by Bruce 
M. Fingerhut, the present head master, who is also a doctoral student in Political Theory at Notre Dame. His educational philosophy invoves a presentation of classical studies in a free and informal atmosphere. 
Perhaps the most distinctive feature about the school is that the students are self-motivated in their individual learning processes. Students are not required to attend classes and their parents are asked not to subject them to any pressure to do homework or "to get the grades." They are to learn because they want to learn, not because they have to. The ex­pected result of this freedom is that all academic success will spring from a real enthusiasm for acquiring knowledge (as opposed to enthusiasm for winning a contest); and, that this success will be all the more meaningful to

the student. "What we are in­terested in making is what Plato called 'philo-sophists' -lovers of knowledge," says Fingerhut .. 
In its purest state, it seems that such an educational theory would not include a grading system. Although Fingerhut basically agrees, he feels that, considering the realities of higher education, it is not practical to do away with grades completely: "The basic reason is that colleges demand some kind of systematic un­derstanding of what's happening." Anayway, students at Magdalen do not receive just grades, they also get individual reports from each of their respective teachers in all their subjects. Furhermore, grades are de-emphasized by both parents and teachers so that "making the grade" will not become a damper on the student's self-motivation. 
This all sounds well and good, but the obvious question is: does it work? Many feel that children are not capable of academic self­dicsipline and that in such an at­mosphere, where there are no demands, they would just play all day. But this is not the case at Magdalen ; most of the students do apply themselves and enjoy doing it. They have a high interest in their education, and they would probably all agree with Robin Hemley, a ninth-grade student,

NEWS: 283-1 
Lee Gentine EDITORIALS While standing in the South Dining Hall lunch line a few days ago, I a plate full of rasty, moldy, six-day old dining hall lasagna. A Business Manager BUSINESS: 
overheard the following remark: "Our student government is the biggest bunch of losers since the Philadelphia 76ers." 
Now I've got nothing against student government (after all, I'm part of it), but I really don't appreciate folks using my hometown team as a definitive standard of substandard performance. Thus I leaned over to the budding pundit and corrected him, "You mean, the 76ers are the biggest collection of losers since the Notre Dame student govern· ment." 
Perceiving a common interest, the gent engaged me in pleasant conversation for a minute or so, and we noted the following facts about the 76ers, the student government cabinet, and last fall's Student Life Council elections: 
-Hal Greer once played on a championship team in Philadelphia, 'lnd several other 76ers have played on winning teams. 
-Jim Hunt beat the Off-Campus Commissioner. 
-Anthony Abowd beat the Ombudsman. 
-Fred Giuffrida swamped the PR hack. 

-Floyd Kezele beat the Executive Coordinator, as did Jim Clarke, Glenn Sorge, and Blank Ballots at one time or another. 
-A former WSND official who no longer attends the University routed Dennis Etienne, who was made vice-pre!ijdent for his em­barrassment and who will likely be presid~nt after today. 
I told the kid in the line, J am a part of this student government, and I really can't say I mind working with these losers. After all, I have worked with Floyd Kezele, Paul Dziedzic, Jim Clarke and Bob Higgins, in the past, and although they're all great guys, they too have all lost elections. I've even worked with the biggest loser of them ali­
T. C. Treanor. 
But these losers are marching again and they have recruited a slate of candidates for the SLC districts. What's more, the ageless political loser Matt Kubik has sallied forth to make opposition with boy wonder Rick Gering. 

There must be some alternative. But let us consider the three groups on today's ballot. Quite simply, I c.ontend that they display the freshness, attractiveness, and appeal of

Itis a foolhardy man indeed who attempts to match wits with a man as respected as Ed Ellis-particularly when the subject is losers. I, however, am due for the angels soon, so I risk less than most-1 have paid all my bills, and have no good reputation to lose. 
The hon. Ellis begins. to lay out his credentials-goodstyle!-by revealing his association with other losing campaigns of the past-Bob Higgins', for example, and (though he didn't mention it) Tom Thrasher:+'However, he is too modest. He did not include his one electoral performance in one campus electoral bid--for Badin Hall Secretary-he placed badly, finishing nineteen votes behind the win­ner, who eventually moved off campus-and only four votes ahead of a kid who had just finished losing an election to the "Freshman Council" by thirty votes. It is from this perspective that the hon. Ellis judges winning and losing. 
This is the judgement: we have an election which is "exagerated,, boring, and downright false." Listen closely, because Ed Ellis is oen of the most important political figures of our generation, and never mind that those charges have occasionally been made against him. 
Edward T. makes much of the fact that various members of student government lost SLC races to his friends. What he does not mention is that for extended periods of time those ballot boxes were in the ex­clusive posession of our Arbitrator of Political Taste, Dr. Ellis himself. Now, I draw no inferences, but Smiling Ed has never been adverse to admitting to some extraelectoral activity if the question is posed coyly enough. 
We move quickly from this discussion of politics past to Smiling Ed's conlcusion; that the current candidates are as appealing as

moment's serious reflection will reveal all three platforms to be alternatively exaggerated, boring, and downright false, and the three tickets taken together remind me very much of what my good friend Denny O'Leary calls ''the Ballantine Beer three-ring sign," because "if you take one zero, and another zero, and then another zero, and add 'em all up, you still got zero." 
In any case, those in politics and the media must out of a sense of duty propose a better course, and so when my friends from around campus contacted me yesterday (as they do before every election) I told them: "Mega-Rat." 
"Meta-Rat" is a big, fat possum that lives behind Lyons Hall. Several weeks ago, one of my stoned colleagues wandered into a room full of people and announced to the ceiling , "You won't believe it but I just saw a Mega-Rat!" 
"It was this big, man," he continued, spreading his arms about two or three feet. The room, of course, emptied in the direction of the bushes behind Lyons, where all saw "Mega-Rat," who looked like a big ol' rat but who was in reality a big ol' possum. 
Since that first night, I have spoken with M. Rat on several oc­
casions. From these sessions with the critter, I have ascertained the 
following: first, he is male; second, he knows more about student 
government than all the other candidates combined; third, he doesn't 
read the Scholastic becasue he considers it beneath his dignity; and 
finally, Mega-Rat will serve as student body president only if he can 
have the Cat-in-the-Hat as his running-mate. 
Now some cynics might think I'm kidding about this whole thing. They might think that "Mega-Rat" is really a rogue, a charlatan, or Le Due Tholn disguise. However, I crossed trails with "Mega-Rat" a few nights ago at Saint Mary's, and after passing the time of day, he told me that he would not seek to change the student government constitution unless he were offered at least twelve cases of Cutty Sark. 
In short, "Mega-Rat" sounds like my kind of possum, and I urge all who are of like mind to bring M. Rat out of the bush behind Lyons and into the seat of power in LaFortune. Write-in: Mega-Rat and the Cat-· in-the-Hat. 
"rasty...lasagna" and something about Ballantines Beer, and that therefore one ought to vote for his candidate, "Mega-Rat." 
I must admit I am somewhat confused by this section of . the Writ. I'm not certain how the c~nclusion follows from the premises, and I think that the Author may here be distracted by his much-publicized search for the truth, which at last.report was resting on the bottom of a Stroh's Keg.

Of the three men running for the position of Student Body President,Dennis Etienne is by far the best can­didil te. 
Etienne and his running mate Mike Geisinger have made no promises to the students other than pledging an extension of this year's student government and accomplishments in line with the same. 
A New Outlook 
This year's edition attempted a new outlook on student government. Their hope was to produce a structure within which students outside of the "poobah" games could get constructive things accomplished. Note then the work on a grotto bus shelter, a student lobby, a committee to aid pre-registration woes, etc., etc. They are all good ideas, con­structive ideas, and all are good moves in the area of student services. 
There lies the strength of the Etienne­Geisinger ticket In their incumbancy, they will be working with the advantage of the lines of communication and structures of government that they have already set up. P articulary in the last few months, Etienne has shown great improvement in the area of student &ervices. If the improvement continues, then Notre Dame students can expect excellence in the service areas of government

power. But likewise it brings a tendency to stagnate. When an incumbant is re­elected, often he will allow things to operate as in the past and he fails to re­ignite the drive within his working structure. It appears that Etienne realizes this and will do all possible to remedy the dichotomy. 
In his last term, Etienne has been in a secondary position. Though he maintained the government office and completed mostof the managerialduties, Bob Ker­sten retained the leadership position associated with the SBP. In other words, Etienne was never really given the op­portunity to lead the students. In the future, the opportunity and the necessity will of course be presented, and looking upon his previous record, odds are that he can come through. 
The SLC 

In the six districts of the SLC, there are only two contested elections. In district 4, Matt Kubik is opposing Ed Rahill. Kubik is the recommended choice. He is probably best prepared to handle the problems, frustrations, and inter­personal relationships found in the SLC. Rahill in his enthusiasm, desire, and concern has shown that he is a satisfactory choice, but Kubik never­theless should be elected. 
In District 1, the off-campus district, only Bob Kincaid appeared before the Editorial Board and despite the fact that he did not have complete knowledge of the functions of an elected SLC member, there is nobasis for comparison with the other candidate, Christopher McManus. 
In the uncontested districts, Karen Moty is running in District 2, Mike Hess in District 3, Jude Bremer in District 5, and Bob Connolly in District 6. 
The Editorial Board

Refereeing the match-up will be Ed­mund Price, Director of Notre Dame Food Service,; Fr. James Riehle, Dean of Students; and Arthur Pears, Chief of Notre Dame Security. Rumor has it that they will keep the ice "secure" while 
"policing" the rink. 

Real Coed Talk 
Editor: 
So now you're either at St. Mary's or Notre Dame. That means that you have your home here. What was once home is now a place to visit, a summer vacation spot. All decisions you make are yours and yours alone. Any changes made will come only through your ef­forts. The sooner you realize this, the further you'll go. 
Within your repertoire of "decisions to make" is that one concerning your relations with the opposite sex. 
The only way to make a fair decision is to wave overassump­tions and deal only with what is. Assumptions only lead to misconceptions. Misun­derstanding leads to hurt. 
Now... 
Should you, the guy at Notre Dame, assume that a girl you've dated the last two Saturdays is yours and waits anxiously for your call? Sorry. The guy next door likes to "get out", too. 
How about you, SMC? Do you assume that for every concert that comes along, that same "boyfriend"will ask you to it? Did you ever stop to think he may be on the same budget you are-he needs soap and toothpaste just as much as you do. 
Do either of you really think that the once a week, mascera, tie, planned date affair blossoms into a real friendship (in one way or another)? Well, look at the rate of divorces among the marriages between SMC and ND men. (I have no paper reference for that.) 
Girls, do you assume you are forward if you stop by a room at ND on your way home from the library? If so, you're a prejudiced person. You are discriminating between a male and female. Ifyou' like a person, should it matter what biological make-up he or she has, that determines going out of your way to say hello? That hello could very well make their day. 
And guys-can you righteously assume that because a girl has decided to drop by, that she's giving you a specialsign she cares for you-or is downright bold? Are your experiences broad enough to make that assumption? If you've answered both questions yes­you're downright naive. The greater percentage of guys at Notre Dame know little more about Saint Mary's than where the cafeteria is. 

There's another side to the story, too. She may ask, "Why doesn't he ever come to see me?" It could be he's just plain shy. It could be he was never invited. He may ask himself, "Why is she so cold?" It could be she went to a girl's school and never had experiences with men. (and vice-versa girls.) There is an element of un­derstanding needed between two people for them to communicate. Why not take the time to get to know a person before you start making assumptions? 
Why assume anything and risk misunderstanding? Ask questions, be honest. No one is here to pave a clear cut way for you like you had at home. You make the decisions. You make the assumptions.

Pseudo Boycott 
Editor: 

As a life-long resident of California's Salinal Valley and as one not inexoribly opposed to the UFW boycott of non-union lettuce, I was personally dismayed to read the results of Monday's vote regarding the singular purchase of Chavez-UFW lettuce by the University. Such a vote no doubt reflects the so-called "liberal" conscience of the student body at 
this so-called "humanistic" University. It is a convenient 
band-aid "liberalism" aimed not at overcoming the inherent hypocrisy and condescension of this University's administration or at matters of great national and human concern (such as a woman's right to soci o-economic equality)­-rather, it is a "liberalism" aimed at a struggle in the Salinas Valley of California, a far-removed struggle which few students either genuinely understand or are personally aware of. 
It is far too easy to opt out for this brand of psuedo-liberalism­

where the only price is the minimal one of paying a little more for a head of lettuce or perhaps going without a salad because UFW lettuce is not available. For that low, low price, this University can further its self­styled, self-contradictory, self­deceptive image of liberal humanism. And that is quite a bargain when one considers the price of all of the Johnson and Johnson Bandaids and blemish creams needed to hide the true complextion of this University and its student body. 
Addressing myself to a solid majority of the students at this University, here is a recipe for continued success: to one part of Notre Dame "liberalism" add "King Kersten" and Mobil Oil's "Mr. Dirt" as Senior Fellow; toss in a bucket ; stir well ; pour into beer mugs--the recipe serves approximately 8000 persons, looks tasty but leaves a hollow feeling in the pit of the stomach and an emptiness in the recesses of the soul.

Thanks, Mark! 
Dear Editor : 
The  news  media  often  come  
under  critical  attack,  both  
nationally  and  locally  at  Notre  

Dame. However, I'd like to offer another slant on the job being done around here by the Observer. A few nights ago one of your reporters, Dave Kaminski, called to ask me some questions con­cerning the impending GSU election of officers. In reading his article in yesterday's Observer, (4­11-73), I was pleasantly surprised to find the information stated the way I had relayed it to Dave. Itis a small incident, but a very hear­tening one. 
At any rate, know that some people at Notre Dame do ap­preciate the quality effort of the Observer staff. 
Sincerely, Bro. Mark J. Ratkus, FSC

It takes a while, though, for students to become self-motivated. 
Since most of the students at Magdalen came from the public school system, at first they were not ready to handle their new­found freedom--as Fingerhut bluntly states: "they went wild." But he feels they eventually started to adjust when they became able to distinguish bet­ween the concepts of freedom and license. He says that the students soon come to realize that "there are logical consequences to any action, and the logical con­sequence of license is slavery­slavery to passion. The logical consequence of not going to classes is to flunk. It's not to. be derided, cajoled or bribed; it's to flunk." 
Nonetheless it sometimes happends, particularly on a nice day, that no students will show up for a class. This would irk many teachers Cas we all knoiw), but those at Magdalen not only tolerate it, they expect it. An MacGill, a French teacher, feels that to harrass her students in any way for their attendance would be detrimental to what she believes Magdalen is accomplishing: "I have a great respect for the students' own potential and self­esteem, and I feel that this should be the driving factor in education­it should not come from me." 
This reliance on the child's self­motivation is similar in some respects to the main idea that A.S. Neil employed in his "radical approach to child-rearing" in his well-known Summerhill School in England, which is "to make the school fit the child--instead of making the child fit the school." 
However, there is a fundamental difference between Magdalen and Summerhill. In Neill's book, Summerhill, he says that the

standard school subjects .''don't matter a jot" compared to the question of Man's inner happiness; therefore, Slinlnerhill's academic structure is relatively lax. Magdalen also does not strictly adhere to contemporary, standard subject matter, but it goes in the other direction: it embodies the classical approach to education: 
The subjects are classical in the sense that they are the same subjects that were taught for eight centuries in Europe to everybody. They are "non-trendy" subjects, says Fingerhut, because "what was true for man two thousand years ago is still true today," The approach divides the seven liberal arts into the Quadrivium and the Trivium: the former deals with the subjects astronomy, geometry, arithmetic and music. The Trivium was divided into gram­mar, dialectic and rhetoric. Grammar is basically the study of Latin, which leads into studies of other languages. Dialectic is the study of Logic (a subject found only in college today); and Rhetoric is the study of styles of writing. 
The intent of classical studies is, once again, to creat.e "lovers of knowledge" and to make the students aware that, as Fingerhut feels, "all learning is inter-related and on-going." He says, "Classical studies are aimed at teaching men how to think and how to live in the world." They are "non-utilitarian" in the sense that they are not specifically designed to lead one to a career, which he considers the natural effect of a standard curriculum. 
There were no "special stud­nets" in the classical approach; it was for everybody. Accordingly, there is no particular breed ~f student now at Magdalen as there is no admission test. 
It is apparent, then, that the Magdalen student faces a rigorous academic challenge. A seventh­
t: ader takes Latin, French, ~nglish, Math, Science, Logic and Music. Athletics are also stressed, but the program is informal and held after school a:\d on weekends. By the time a student graduates, he will have taken Latin, French, German and Greek ; he will be well versed in English, composition and literature; and, he will have ahad a solid introductory background in philosophy and theology. The purpose of this is to overcome the "wastefulness of secondary schools." for which Fingerhut finds colleges must compensate by offering remedial courses in philosophy, English and mathematics during the freshman and sophomore years. 
Some would say that this staggering amount of work is just too much and too complex for the pre-college student. And, though one student complained that "Logic is the most boring thing," MacGill says that the workload is nonetheless accepted as a challenge: "Most students are very proud to have this put on them." 
Yet with all this work, the classroom routine at Magdalen is anything but the usual pedantic "classroom routine." Sometimes, all classes are suddenly cancelled, and the whole school piles into the teachers' cars and heads off for a concert or a movie. 
It is a sad thing that an in­stitution such as Magdalen, that stands on such· idealistic goals, should be faced with extinction from such a materialistic concern as money. It is a sadder thing that parents are reluctant to send their children there. Fingerhut would like to get children from faculty members at Notre Dame, but he remarks that: "We get sympathy from them, but no students." himself to the fact that: "If we 
So, in Fingerhut's words the don't get enough students, we'll future of Magdalen is pack up and leave." Such an end to "problematic." Although he will Magdalen would be a loss to all of remain committed to his the educational community in educational ideals, he has resigned South Bend. 
Tucson slides planned 


by Mar) Janca Staff Reporter 
Slides of the Tucson area will be presented at 12:20 p.m. and 6:30 
p.m. in Stapleton Lounge for any interesed students in the Saint Mary's Tucson Program. 
Recently approved by the Board of Regents, the program will begin in September and will involve 20 different students each semester. 
According to Mr. John Hof, assistant to the president and coordinator of the Tucson Program, any student interested in participating in either semester should contact himself or Sr. M. Alma Peter, director of Overseas Programs, as soon as possible for complete fact sheet, curriculum materials, color broch ures, and an application. 
Any St. Mary's student whose course schedule can coincide with the· curriculum offered is eligible to apply for the program, he contined. 
No application deadline has yet bee n set, but, "interested students should try to have an application completed by the end of pre~ registration," said Hof. He further urged that those applying to the Tucson Program also register for classes here. 
The curriculum will involve a two-quarter system, with em­phasis on the various and unique southwestern areas of study. The first quarter will be comprised of Southwest Hisory, DEZ,sert Biolgy, 
John Hof, coordinator 

and Socio-Cultural Aspects of the Southwest. The second quarter will cover the areas of art, student teaching, and southwestern community studies. It will also allow for independent studies by the students. All courses will be applied to the students' credits for graduation. 
Although no professors have signed contracts yet, Hof stated that they will be selected from the Tucson area and approved by the participating departments of SMC. 
St. Mary's President Dr. Ed­ward Henry announced the ap­pointment of Sr. M. Gertrude Anne Otis as director of the program. 
Sister Otis served as the college's registrar from 1953-55 and as admissions director from 1955­
58. She was Dean of St. Mary's College Graduate School of Theology from 1959-63.

Thursday, April 26, 1973 the observer 
Israeli ambassador here, discusses crisis 
by Terry Keeney Staff Reporter 
Ynsef Tekoah, Israeli Am­bassador to the United Nations, discussed the problems his country faces in the current Middle East crisis in a press conference yesterday. 
Ambassador Tekoah, appearing at Notre Dame for a lecture in observance of Israel's 25th an­niversary, cited the two principle challenges facing Israel: freedom for all Jews and cessation of the military conflict in the Middle East. 
Tekoah expressed particular concern for the 3 million Jews of Russia who have been denied emigration to Israel. He reaf­firmed the determination of his country to continue the struggle for human rights in Russia and elsewhere. 
He was less hopeful for a cessation of military hostilities bPtween Israel and the Arab 
nr~ns. 

"I am afraid that on the 25th anniversarv of our country's in­dependence we are still facing a long and arduous road," Tekoah observed. "It is a war that has gone through peai:~ disarmament, and cease-fire, but it._ a war that continues." 
When asked to comment op the recent censure of Israel by the'\Uil Security Council, Ambassadol­Tekoah was quick to label Israel's actions that prompted the censure as defense measures. He pointed out that the Security Council had not so condemned the Arab nations for such "barbaric attacks" as the massacre of the Israeli Olympic athletes in Munich and the murder of American diplomats in Khar­toum. 
"We pointed out that the UN resolution is one-sided because it deals with Israeli defense measures," Tekoah said. "What we have been compelled to do is react in self-defense." 
Tekoah minimized the ef­fectiveness of the UN in achieving a settlement of the Middle East conflict. Asserting a general in­ternational disillusionment with the UN, Tekoah emphasized that a Middle East peace can result only through negotiations between Israel and the Arabs, not through resolutions of the Security Council. 
"Our difficulties demand a 

'Striving for peace:' Tekoah

Staff Reporter 
Joseph Tekoah, Israel's am­bassador to the United Nations, spoke on Israel and her desire for peace last night in the auditorium of the Center for Continuing Education. His speech highlighted a campus-eommunity celebration of Israel's 25th anniversary. 
Tekoah stated, "We are con­tinuing to strive for peace." He added that it should be a peace which brings progress and development to all nations in the Middle East. 
He called to Israel's neighbors to "put an end to the violence," and he said that they both most put an end to the fighting and build a peace. He added they must both educate their people to work for peace. -....Speaking on Israel as a state, Tekoah said "it is the fulfillment of an age,-old dream of the Jewish people." 
Hewent ~n to say, "the history of Israel is \the history of the preservation of that small stone in the mosaic of mankind--Judaism." 
The struggle of\ Israel was just like the struggle for fret>dom by the emerging nations of Asia. Africa and Latin America except Israel's struggle lasted aof 2,ood' .Jears

Marathon dcmcers ready

by Steve Magdzinski Staff Reporter 
Ten or more couples are ex­
pected to "Dance for Those Who 
Can't" during a dance Marathon in 
the LaFortune Ballroom beginning 
at 4 p.m. today and ending 4 p.m. 
Sunday. The Marathon is spon­
sored by Student Government to 
raise money for the Muscular 
Dystrophy Foundation. 
Most schools have raised about 
$10,000 in similar efforts, said 
Marathon chairman Collets 
Miller. "I'm not sure we'll make 
that much," said, "just because of 
a lack of participation. But I think 
we'll raise most of our money at 
the dance itself." 
As of Wednesday afternoon, $1,080 in pledges had been counted at the Student Government office. More pledges had come in, however, that had not been counted. 
Dancing is not restricted to those officially entered in the Marathon said Miller. Anyone who pays th~ $.25 admission fee may also dance. The $.25 fee may be pledged to a favorite couple. 
The Scum of the Earth, a campus rock group, will play at the Marathon Sat. night from 8 p.m. until 2 a.m. 
The Marathon schedule is as follows:

He added that Israel has brought most of the jews living in arab lands to the freedom of Israel. The next problem is the jews in Russia 
Tekoah related an incident that occured while he was ambassador to Russia. Jewish lady with her son burst in to the embassy asking him to get them out of the country. When he told her he couldn't she asked him to get her son out. 
Tekoah called the redemption and saving of these "last jews in Europe" Israel's greatest challenge. 
Fr. Hesburgh introduced Tekoah 
by reading a psalm and saying"shalom." After the speech he read two more psalms. 
Ambassador Tekoah has been Permanent Representative to the United Nations since 1968. Earlier he was Assistant director-general 
Soviet Union (1962-1965), and Ambassador to Brazil (1960-1962).

Tekoah praised American at­tempts to intervene in the Middle East conflict and urged further American aid. 
"Any assistance on the part of the United States to bring Israel and the Arab states into a serious dialogue is welcome. The question is how and when can Israel and the Arab countries get together and start the dialogue that has taken place in other parts of the world. If the U.S. can be helpful in en­couraging the Arab states to negotiate, that of course would be very useful."

Consistency eludes ND gridders 
by Vic Dorr Sports Editor 

During his nine-plus years as Notre Dame's head football coach, Ara Parseghian has become· thoroughly familiar with the athletic ups and downs of the University's academic schedule. And yesterday, in the first stadium scrimmage of the current spring season, Parseghian watched as his­team struggled to shake off the effects of one of those "downs." 
The Irish gridders, !playing in a filmed scrimmage for the first time since their six-day Easter layoff, were plagued by fumbles, 
interceptions;, and sloppy ball­handling, and the butter-fingered offensive performance left Par­seghian less than pleased with the afternoon's workout. 
"It was evident that we've been gone for six days," admitted Ara. "I think the defensive hitting was much improved, and the defense was moving quicker and reacting better, but our handling of the football made it evident that we haven't had much work recently. 
"It wasn't totally unexpected, but we will have to be more con­scious of the importance of the ball, and we'll! have to learn to protect the ball at crucial times." 
But there was an encouraging side to the scrimmage. During the four periods of the first team­second team contact, the number one's ran up a 41-15 spread over their opponents, and the day's
i scoring was widely distributed. 
~ Four touchdowns were tallied by
I 
the first offense, two by the second 
I, 
offesne, and two by the number­
I. one defense. Quarterbacks Tom Clements \ and Cliff Brown alternated halvesi at the controls of the first offense, 
and Clements, taking advantage of turnovers and better field positior., led the first-liners to four TD's while Brown directed them to two. But while at the controls of the numlki--two offense, the two QB contenders played to a standoff, each earning a single score against the 'first defense. 
"It' (the quarterback shuffle) gave us an opportunity to work them both, commented Par­seghian, "and it was a better test for us defensively, as well." 
Clements put the first defen~e to a stiff test during his second possession of the afternoon. After defensive back Mike Parker recovered Russ Kornman's fumble on the Blue's 22-yard line, Clements took the second offense to a score in three plays. A first­down flare pass to halfback Chuck Kelly carried to the 10, and, two plays later, Clements swept ten yards around left end for the score. 
But Brown, operating the first offense, got that score back just before the end of the opening period. Tim Rudnick's 14-yard punt return set the Blue's up on their own 47, and the number-one's ran it in from there, the touchdown coming on fullback I Wayne Bullock's three yard jaunt. Bobby Thomas, who handled the placekicking;and kickoff chores for both teams, ,tied it at seven with 
2:01 left in the stanza. The first-liners went ahead for good just nine seconds into the second period, when deep back Bob Zanot plucked AI Samuels' fumble out of the air and scooted 
untouched for a 46 yard touch­down. 
The .14-7 count held until the second half, when Clements and Brown shifted positions. Clements immediately took advantage of his first-string role, and led the

scrimmage. 

number one's 74 yards to atouch­down during his first possession of the final half. The drive stalled once--at fourth and goal from the nine--but a defensive holding penalty gave the offensive team a first down on the one, and Penick squirmed across on the next play. 
Penick's tally was the only score of the third period, but a second defensive touchdown triggered an avalanche of fourth period points. Tackle Kevin Nosbusch blocked Tony Brantley's punt inside the Blue 15-yard line and end George Hayduk scooped up the loose ball and carried it the final three yards int~ the end zone. 
That score made in 27-7, but Brown earned another score for the second offense moments later. 
Irisb split doubleheader -with W· Michigan 
by Stan Urankar 

Notre Dame and Western Michigan battled at Cartier Field forbetterthan five hours yesterday afternoon, but all that baseball action produced exactly what neither team wanted-a doubleheader split. 
Senior Rick Eich watched his Irish mates strand 17 runners on the bases land commit three cos­tly errors that resulted in his fifth loss of the year, a 4-2 twelve inning marathon defeat. 
MikeRiddellgot better support in the nightcap though, and pitched five-hit ball while snuffing out a last frame Bronco charge for ND's ninth win, 3-2. 
Coach Jake Kline didn't know what to do after a passed ball and Pat Coleman's bases-loaded error sent home the wi ning runs in the opener. "It seems like we just can't get any hits with men in scoring position," the veteran Irish baseball tutor noted. "We left the bases loaded four times ... you don't win ball games like that." 
The/real crusher is that twice the Irish had the sacks jammed with nobody out but couldn't squak home a run. The lninth inning proved most demoralizing as Pete Schmidt singled, Mark Schmitz dc.ubled, and Bob Roemer was intentionally walked before Bronco boss Bill Chambers replaced started Tim May with Dave Rice. 
A new pithcer in a none-out, ­bases-full, game-winning run situation-he's bound to crack, right? Rice said, "Sorrry" and got TomHansen on a foul fly to left, designated hitter Pete Clemens via an infield fly out, and Howard Wood through a soft liner to short. 
The Irish also had the sacks full with nobody out in the second via singles by Wood and Jim Smith sandwiched around Coleman's walk. May got tough, though, to get Dick Nussbaum on a strikeout and Schmidt and Schmitz on infield outs. 
Western eventually took ad­vantage of the Irish gifts, wrap­ping it up with the winnin~-and unearend-runs in thE' ~wleftl'. Two singles and a passed ball forced Eich to intentionally psss Greg 
McMannon wins at OSU 
by Tom McKenney 
Twenty-five teams, including Notre Dame, met last weekend in Columbus for the Ohio State Relays. Although the Irish did not fare well, team captain Tom McMannon successfully defended his high hurdles title while teammate Willie George scored the only other Irish points with a second place effort in the discus throw. 
McMannon's winning time of :13.8 was-good enough to edge out his old nemisis Roger Downing of Eastern Michigan University. 
"Downing has always been one of the more interesting com­petitors," the Irish captain said. "I've never lost to him in the three years I've run against him, but just the same it's always a good race. Downing always seems to bring out the..best in me. I always have good times when rcompete against him." 

McMannon's time at the OSU relays was only one-tenth of a second off his lifetime best. 
McMannon will be the only Irish representative at the Drake relays this weekend. Most of the Notre Dame team will be staying in Indiana for the Ball State Relays. At Drake, McMannon will be running against Rod Milburn who earlier this year in Detroit defeated McMannon in his attempt to retain his NCAA indoor hurdle title. 
Also included in the field will be representatives from Kansas, Kansas State and Bowling Green. A crowd of over 15,000 is expected to turn out and they'll get a chance to see the likes of Olympians Milburn, Frank Shorter and Dave Wottle. 
Geyer, and second baseman Terry kle followed with an easy double play grounder that Coleman deflected into short center for the winning runs. 
Schmitz' boot on a rundown play gave the Broncs their first marker in the third. May and Mark Orr were at the corner with two out when the latter broke for second base. Smith took Roemer's throw and started after the WMUr in­fielder just as May broke for home. As Orr neared first base on his retreat, Schmitz dropped Smith's relay to allow the run. 
Nussbaum's two-out single scored Wood to tie it in the fourth frame, but_ Orr countered with a two-down fifth inning double that put the Broncs back up. 
ND entered the seventh in a do­or-die situation, and Schmidt opened with a walk. Schmitz moved him ahead via a sacrifice bunt, and an out later, Hansen ripped a line shot single to left that put the game in overtime. 
Eich finished with four strikeouts and only six wll}ks for the twelve innings of duty, though he probably would have been happier with a plain ol' seven stanza win. 
Riddell was in top form in his outing, runnning off strings of eight and ten straight retired batters. Still, the senior righthander needed some big plays in the field. 
Coleman, Schmidt, and Schmitz combined on afourth framerally­killing double play that left a runner at third. and Hansen made a racing grab of catcher Dave Babcock's liner to end the gam.e 
Consecutive safeties by Schmitz, 
Roemer, and Hansen put the Irish 
on the board in the first, then 
Smith, Ken Schuster, and Schmidt 
likewise combined for another un 
in the second. 

Geyer bobbled Hansen's 
grounder to open the ND sixth 
frame and set up the eventual 
wining score. The "T-Bird" moved 
to second on a passed ball, gained 
third on ann infield out, then 
scored when Smith ripped a two­
out single through the box. 
Western rallied for two runs with The first "D" didn't succumb easily, but Brown, facing fourth and goal from the two, hit Greg Hill with a short scoring toss and then hit tight end Robin Weber for the two-pointer. 
The final two scores of the scrimmage both belonged to Clements and the first offense, and both resulted from turnovers. Hill's fumble his own 38 gave the first-liners one opportunity, and Clements and Penick capitalized on it when they clicked on an option pitch-play that went 16 yards for a TD. 
Tom Lopienski's 37-yard run with an interception of a Cliff 
two away in the seventh on Jim Carwardine's single, a walk, and Zirkle's double to the fence in left center before Hansen made his big catch. 
Notre Dame leaves for Oxford, 
0. this afternoon and a thre-game weekend series with Miami of Ohio. Kevin Fanning and Mike Swallow are expected to get the nod in Friday's doubleheader, and either Mitch Stoltz or Mark Pitt­man will conclude the series Saturday. The Irish them return to Cartier Sunday for a big doubleheader with independent Droit, and coach Kline expects both Eich and Riddell to be ready for that twinbill, soated for a 1 p.m. curtain call. 
That is, barring any more five hour doubleheaders. 

Brown pas's set up the final score. The soph defensive back carried his theft from the 45 to the eight, and Clements scored from the one two plays later. 
The scrimmage began the last week and a half ofspringpractice, and it also saw a limited return to action by defensive tackle Steve Niehaus, who had been sidelined with a knee injury since Missouri week of last season. 
"Niehaus played during the first half," said Parseghian, "and he did okay for the first time out. But the six -day layoff was evident in all of them, and we're just lucky that the weather was what it was today. 
It was perfect football weather, and if it had been much warmer they might have been wilting out there. I fully expected what took place today," he concluded, "particularly from the standpoint of execution."
