Jenkins to address academic freedom 
Queer Film Festival, Vagina Monologues are starting points for discussion

New~ Wril~rs 
Univorsity l'rnsidnnt Father .John .Jnnkins will discuss the int1~rplay bntwenn academic frc-ndom and Notro Danw's Catholic character in th rt~n opn n­dialogue addrnsses nnxt wnnk, a decision spurred by 

Jenkins

rncnnt hnightnnnd dnbatn about the ()twnr Film Festival and Vagina Monologues. 
"Academic freedom is an essential value in any university community, and our Catholic character is essenlial to Notre Dame," Jenkins said in a state­ment Tuesday. "I want to address both these central val~ ues, and seek comment and dis­cussion from the University community. I bnlieve such dis­cussion is an important one for Notre Dame and Catholic higher ndueation in general." 
Jenkins will not make a policy announcement in favor or against certain productions dur­ing his addresses, but will sim­ply initiate dialogue, University spokesman Dennis Brown and vice president of Public Affairs and Communication Hilary Crnkovich said. 

Professors and students said they were encouraged by Jenkins' decision to speak pub­licly about two contentious and central aspects of the University's identity. 
James Collins, associate chair of the Film, Television and Theatre Department, whieh has traditionally co-sponsored the Queer Film Festival and Vagina Monologues, said the addresses have already built anticipation. 
''I'm delightnd he's giving the talk on where he stands on all of this. Right now I think clarifi­cation of when~ he stands in really important," Collins said. "A lot of people are imagining he's going to bn for or against it and he hasn't said anything one way or another. With pnople so polarized on this campus, each convinced that .Jenkins is on their sid.e, it is very useful for him to articulate where he stands." 
While the ()ueer Film Festival and Vagina Monologues -the former entering its third year at Notre Dame, the latter its fifth -have particularly polarized the campus, Brown said the two events would serve as examples rather than focal points in the address Jenkins will deliver to faculty on Monday, students on Tuesday and alumni on

Obligatory resolution 
It's the beginning of a new semester, and also still the beginning of a new year. Although the festivities of New Year's Eve are in the past, for many people New Year's resolutions are very much a part of the present. laura Baumgartner 
It has only been about 17 days, give or Wzre Editor take a few hours, since these resolutions were made and I hope most of you can still honestly say that you are living up to yours. 
However, if you didn't choose to con­verge with the masses and resolve to improve your life in some way this year I think that's OK too. Based on my experiences, I haven't encountered many people who were able to sustain their goals for the New Year through­out the month of January, let alone the entire year. 
Personally, I don't even remember what my past resolutions may have been. This makes me fairly confident that I did not continue with my resolve to improve myself for very long. 
I think the problem with New Year's resolutions is that a lot of the time people don't really commit to them. They make up a resolution whether it's to start working out on a regular basis, to quit smoking, or to spend more time doing volunteer work not because they truly want to do these things but because they feel obligated too. 
New Year's resolutions are a tradi­tion that dates back to Babylonian times, and because they are still so popular in society today who wants to be the oddball who doesn't make one. However, if you really want to change something about yourself or your life, shouldn't you be able to do it any day of the year? 
Life is complicated enough as it is; do we really need to have the added pressure of New Year's and its dread­ed resolutions looming over our heads on top of all the daily stressors we encounter? 
If you really are dedicated to chang­ing yourself for the better or resolving to change something else that you think could use improvements and just need that extra push to get started, then I think New Year's was created for you. However, I don't think we should need a set day too encourage us to make changes. If you want to change something I think you should just go out and do it, take the initiative and start whenever you feel like it. 
There's no reason to wait until next year to make a resolution, so ifyou missed the deadline of midnight on New Year's Eve this year, don't worry about it, start today. 
I didn't start my resolution until returning to campus. In fact, I wasn't even going to make one simply because I couldn't think of anything that I thought I wanted to change. Once I had moved in and worked up an appetite after struggling with my luggage however, my resolution came to me.· 
I'm going to eat in the dining hall this semester. There will be no more spending money on snacks at Meijer or Target, no more ordering Jimmy John's at all hours of the day. I'm going to use the meal plan I paid for instead of spending extra money on food. 
I've been here for three days now and I've been to the dining hall three times. At least it's a step in the right direction. 
I hope you all find success with your resolutions as well. Good luck.

University to honor Martin Luther King, Jr. 
By PETER NINNEMAN 
News Writer 
Notm Damn has not yot hold any campus nvents to honor Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, observed Monday, but it has plans to do so. In addition, University leaders also partiei­patnd in some community and ofl'-campus events for the holi­day. 
Hichard Pierce, chair of the University's department of 1\fricana studies and associate professor of history, led a discus­sion at Notre Dame Downtown, located on South Michigan Strnnt, whkh focused on lesser­known dvil rights activists. 
Dean of First Year of Studies and theology professor Hugh Page was the keynote speaker at the "King Day" gospel program at the Century Center in South Bnnd. Page discussed tht1 rela­tionship between religion and sodal ehang11 at the annual pro­J.,>Tam. 
In meent ynars, celebrations of Martin Luther King Day at Notrn Damn have ineluded prayer serviens, a "pnaen quilt" made by studenl<> of' Notre Damn and loml nlemnntary schools and an artistic showeasn by studnnl'i of Notm Dame, Saint Mary's, and Iloly Cross. 
As in 2004, this year Notre I>ame will bn holding a town hall mneting. "A Call fhr Your Voice: Th11 H11sponsibility of Every Man and Woman," will take place .Jan. 24 and will discuss topies such as polities and global humanitarian interest<>, econom­ies, education, gender relations and cultural diversity at the University and Catholic soeial teaching. Faculty members on the panel will indude Anthony Burrow, a researcher assoeiate in the department of' psychology, and Heanna Ursin, a visiting fel­low in the department of Afrieana studies. Student mem­bers of the King Day committee, whieh organized the event, will also share the mierophone dur­ing the mtleting. 
The meeting is sponsored by Campus Ministry and Multicultural Student Programs and Services and will be held at 7 p.m. in the student lounge of the Coleman-Morse Center. In addition to Tuesday's event, there will be a similar discussion by selected student leaders and members of the King Day com­mittee on Jan. 23, in the Main Building. 
Students understood why the University did not hold any evenl'i honoring King this week. 
"It would have been nice for the University to have done something because he really ehanged the way the country works, but it's understandable that nothing happened because we all just got baek from break," freshman Eileen Helmer said. "Organizing and advertising any type of event would've been pretty hard."

Students trek to Tem_pe over break 

By RYAN SYDLIK 
News Writer 
Notre Dame and Saint Mary's students traveled from all over the United States to Tempe, Ariz .. in large numbers over the break to sec the Irish take on the Ohio State Buekcyes in the Fiesta Bowl. Despite the loss, student<; enjoyed the game and the experiences that eamc with it. 
Senior Chris Christensen of Knott Hall made the trip to the Sun Devil Stadium from Virginia with friends and family. 
"I had a good time," Christensen said. "I really enjoyed seeing all my friends there, and being in the student section made it almost like a home game." 
However, Christensen was not a big fan of Sun Devil Stadium. It was disconcerting to him because, he said, due to the stands' red color, it looked like there were more Ohio State fans than Notre Dame fans. 
Kevin Clock, also a senior from Knott Hall, made his way to Tempe and said the weather was ideal for a football game. 
"Aside from the loss, I had a great time," Clock said. "It was good to sec [all my friends] for a game one last time," 
Clock was able to go beeause a friend secured him a game ticket and beeause he received a plane ticket as a special gift from his grandfather. He knew some peo­ple that were not as well pre­pared, however. 
"One girl I know didn't initially have a game ticket, but she made all the flight arrangements before she even was able to get one," he said. 
Clock also mentioned that he knew a few people who were upset they didn't win the lottery. 
"Seniors were mad that under­classmen got tickets while they were unable to go to what would be their last game as a student," he said. 
Saint Mary's senior Tai Baird waited in line for several hours in the College's Student Center to buy one of the 100 tickets allotted to Saint Mary's students and then flew from Georgia to watch the Irish face off against the Buckeyes. 
"It was really neat meeting so many different people from all across the United States that trav­eled just to sec the game," Baird said. 
Will Kurtz was another senior who attended the game. 
"It was a lot of fun," Kurtz said. "I really thought we were coming back in the last 5 minutPs, but our defense just eouldn 't stop them." 
Kurtz also had positive experi­ences with Ohio State fans and said they were really amiablP. 
"I didn't see any lighl'i or argu­ments," Kurtz said. "I expected a little bit more animosity, but there really wasn't any at all." 
A native of Seott'idale, it was the fourth Notre Dame bowl game loss in Arizona Kurtz attended. 
''I'm still waiting for a victory," Kurtz said. "And hopefully, the fifth time is the charm." 
Ed Kummercr, a sophomore who is also an Arizona native, went to the game with his family. "It was painful at times, but it was fun to go and support the team," Kummernr said. 
Saint Mary's studP.nt Becky Feauto flew from Iowa to Vegas and then drove to Tempe to tail­gate with friends and watch Notro Dame take the field. 
"I enjoyed the game despite being disappointed by the loss," Fcauto said.

continued from page 1 
Thursday. 
Brown said he did not believe a decision had been reached about whether to change the name of the Queer Film Festival, a possibility raised in December. 
Each address' audience will be allowed a chance to respond with comments or questions, an open discussion concept that quickly generated a positive response from the Notre Dame community. 
"It's important that Father John is telling us what his thoughts are because [the aca­demic freedom issue] has caused a lot of discord in the communi­ty," said anthropology professor James McKenna, whose depart­ment has previously sponsored the Queer Film Festival. "What's important is the ability of these issues to be addressed by all constituencies of the campus." 
But he also expressed uncer­tainty -a feeling he believes many professors share. 
"I think all of us are thinking the same thing, [that is] we don't have a sense of what he's going to say," McKenna said. "It is interesting because everyone is interested in it. Everyone thinks this has a lot of implications in orde·r for our University to be great." 
Crnkovich said the new year provided a good opportunity for new University leadership to ini­tiate discussion on important topics such as academic free­dom. 
"A university setting is a won­derful place to encourage points of view and discussions of impor­tance," she said. 

Jenkins prioritized student involvement in the discussion through an invitation Executive Assistant to the President Frances Shavers extended to student body president Dave Baron during winter break. On Jan. 2, Jenkins, Shavers, Baron and student body vice president this very seriously, which is a very good sign." 
Philosophy professor Ed Manier, who has in the past been outspoken in defense of academ­ic freedom issues, including the Queer Film Festival, said predic­tions about what the president will reveal are at this point spec­ulative. 
"My initial reaction is more in 
Lizzi Shappell met while in Arizona for the Fiesta Bowl to discuss the possibility of a dialogue involving stu­dents, Baron said.

the wait and see mode," Manier said. "Jenkins is a serious man and this is an important talk. I think it will be a good idea to lis­ten to the talk with something like an open mind ... I cer­tainly plan on attending." 
Students involved with the Vagina Monologues production are also anxious to hear what Jenkins has to say, director 
extremely respectful of us, as students in particular." 
Baron said he believes there will be a sizeable student turnout at Tuesday's discussion. 
Jenkins has no choice but to confront an issue of this magni­tude, said Charles Rice, law school professor emeritus, who has previously opposed both the Vagina Monologues and the Queer Film Festival. 
"I think that's part of his responsibility as president to address this issue," Rice said. "I did not expect it but I think it's an indication that he is taking 
Madi Liddy said. 

"We just discussed that we're going to keep an open mind," Liddy said. "Although there's a lot of drama about the Vagina Monologues, we're also really willing to hear what he has to say about academic freedom ... We all want to go." 
The co-chairs of this year's Queer Film Festival were not available for comment Tuesday.

Tuesday and Thursday. Some students who utilized the class-free Monday for readjust­ing to college life after a four­week winter break did not wel­come the earlier starting date. 
"I liked having the extra day to get organized, buy books and catch up with friends before we start in with class­es," junior Catherine Reinert said. "I arrived on Sunday night and had class all day [on Monday] so I haven't had a chance to buy my books yet." 
The College made adjust­ments in attempts to accommo­date the early start to the semester. Representatives from each academic department were available on Sunday afternoon to address students' scheduling problems, and the bookstore remained open from 8 a.m. until 6 p.m. 
College residence halls, how­ever, did not reopen until 9 
a.m. on Sunday, which proved to put a time constraint on many students who desired extra time to move back into their dorm rooms. 
"I felt a little rushed, espe­cially since they didn't open the dorms until Sunday morning," junior Mary Meier said. "I was also surprised that the book­store closed at 6 p.m. I figured they would stay open later to accommodate students." 
As a junior resident advisor, Jessica Stoller returned to her dorm room on Saturday and said that the situation became frustrating when some students snuck back into their dorm rooms on Saturday evening. "Some [students] had already bought plane tickets to come back without to school on Saturday rather than Sunday, and we had to allow housing . and make special exceptions," she said. "The change was just frustrating for residents, RAs and residence life staff to have to deal with on a fairly short notice." 
Sophomores Erin Hogan and Natalie Grasso faced the chal­lenge of having a very limited time to move into their dorm rooms after studying in Rome last semester. 
"We just really hit the ground running," Grasso said. "We had to move in quickly, which gave us no time to stop and think about the readjusting process." 
Hogan agreed and said that it was difficult to find time to reunite with friends after being away from the campus since last May. 
"I have just been going non­stop since I got here, and have not even had time to think about being back," she said. 
Communications studies pro­fessor Colleen Fitzpatrick said she felt students did not seem quite as prepared on Monday as they did on the first day of class last semester. 
"Very few students had the textbooks yet . . . I also heard of a few students who missed Monday's class because they assumed the semester started [Tuesday]," she said. "But over­all, the students seemed to be enthusiastic about starting, even if there were a few grum­bles about starting on Monday."

Court upholds doctor-assisted suicide 
Without Roberts' support, Supreme Court backs Oregon's assisted suicide law 
Associated Press 

WASIIINGTON-The first major ruling of tho Hobnrts era at the Suprome Court was missing somnthing: tlw support of nnw Chief .Justico John Hobnrts. 
Hoberts joined the court's most conservative nH1Ill­bers. Antonio Scalia and Clarnnee Thomas, in baek­ing the Bush administra­tion's challengn to Orngon's unique doctor-assistnd sui­cide law. 
They were outvoted, how­ever, by moderato and liber­al justices who said Oregon doctors can help terminally ill patinnts die without fear of punishment from the fed­eral gov~~rnment. 
The 6-3 decision found that the Bush administra­tion improperly tried to use a federal drug law to pur­sue OrHgon doetors who help people din undnr the law.

Playstation consoles to food and a bed comforter, the occupants said. Desktop computers and tel­evision sets were spared. 
Senior John Noell, who lives at the house, said he and his room­mates locked every window and door before leaving for break. 
"But we have big windows and doors that aren't sturdy and lock­ing your room isn't good either [becauseI those can get kicked easily, too," Noell said. "I was prepared [against burglary], but I wasn't surprised [our house was broken into]." 
Nearly every door of the house was broken down -including the 10 bedroom doors -all of which were locked. 
The tenants didn't find out about the robbery until one of the roommates, who lives in Granger, drove by the house and realized what had happened. 
The damage was not as severe at 821 East Washington St., where residents said the bur­glars were caught in the middle of their stealing spree, thanks to a friend who drove by the house and noticed people inside. The burglary was reported on Dec. 28. 
"The house is equipped with an alarm, which apparently was not triggered during the break-in," said one of the residents, a male senior who wished to remain anonymous. "The speaker for the alarm was ripped out of the wall. We are frustrated that the alarm did not go off. but are very thankful that our friend was in the area during the time of the burglary." 

The South Bend Police Department did not return phone calls seeking comment Tuesday. 
Mark Kramer, who owns both houses on Washington Street, said alarm systems are essential to preventing break-ins. He said he sent out an e-mail to all his tenants before the holiday encouraging them to take special precautions to ensure that their houses were safe. 
Despite his instructions, this year's crimes were the worst he's ever seen. 
"That's the problem ... this is the prime time that something is going to happen, but we don't have a lot of break-ins," Kramer said. "In all my years of doing this I can count them on one hand." 
Kramer said every house he owns has an alarm system, but it's up to the tenants to make sure it's connected and working properly. 
A break-in was also reported at 524 Corby St. on Dec. 28, where vandals splattered walls with profane graffiti -causing between $500-$1,000 worth of damage, resident Ray Jarosz said. 
The vandals broke through a window on the second floor using a futon from a neighbor's porch. 
"[There was] writing on pic­tures and on walls, [and also] feces on a chair," said James Yesnik, who also lives in the house. 
The house's alarm system was not connected, allowing the van­dals to cause serious damage without the threat of getting caught. The only item stolen was an old Notre Dame I.D card.

"When I met with the search committee it felt really good. I thought, 'This could be a really good fit for me,"' Timm said. 
Timm was invited back to Mount Mary in late October for a weekend of extensive interviews, which she described as "intense." She was notified she had been selected as the College's lOth president just before Christmas. 
"I've very excited," Timm said. "I was feeling confi­dent throughout. I just felt throughout all the inter­views I communicated who I am and what my skills are and my interests in the best possible way that I could." 
Timm will take the helm at a college that has made notable progress in the past few years. Outgoing College President Patricia O'Donoghue increased enrollment this year to a record-high 1,722 students. A recent capital campaign raised $28 million, far sur­passing the original goal of $16.5 million and enabling the institution to build two new buildings. 
However, while Mount Mary mirrors Saint Mary's as a Catholic women's col­lege, it is quite different 
when it comes to student life. The school is largely a commuter college, with fewer than 200 students residing on campus. Further, the average age of the students at Mount Mary is 24, meaning many are working while simultane­ously pursuing a degree. 
Timm said she is looking forward to serving a differ­ent type of student body and working to create sense of campus life. 
"It think that is going to be a really interesting change," Timm said. 
She said her immediate goals as presi­dent are to 
Leaving Saint Mary's will be difficult, Timm said, but turnover is part of the "nat­ural transition" at any school. 
"I think at any institution there is a circle of change," Timm said. "You always want to continue to assess you contributions [to the institution], and bringing in new blood is good." 
Colleagues at Saint Mary's have been very supportive of her decisions, Timm said. 
In a statement released by the College, President Carol Mooney praised Timm for her contributions

"As we are here [at Saint Mary's], you are always going to be very attentive to your enrollment and how you are going to attract students to your institution," Timm said. 
Timm is the second Saint Mary's vice president to step down from the College's administration this academic year. 
In August, Pat White, vice president and dean of fac­ulty, announced he would leave his position in May to take a yearlong sabbatical and then rejoin the English department as a faculty member.

The College should have no problem attracting a strong replacement for her, Timm said. 
"I am certain there will be a great pool of candi­dates," Timm said. "This is a great job with great peo­ple to work with."

Pro-Syrians aecuse the United States of trying to inl1u­ence Lebanon since Syria was forced to withdraw its troops from the country last April after international and Lebanese pressure over the assassination of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri. 
The United States is one of several Western countries that backed a U.N. Security Council resolution in 2004 that demanded an end to Syrian interference in Lebanon and the disarming of all militias in the country -a reference to the pro-Syrian Hezbollah.

Governn1ent pledge will help combat flu 
Associated Press 
EUING -The United States intends to pledge $334 million to the fight against bird l'lu, according to an ol'licial state­ment shown to The Associated Press Wednesday ahead of a pledging ceremony at an international donors confer­ence. 
That is significantly more than the eonf"nrenen organiz­ers were antieipating. 
Tho gathering in Beijing has taken on a new sensn of urgency after the first deaths from the virus were reeordod outside Asia and there worn hopes it would raise at least $1.5 billion. 
That is the minimum amount needed to avert a pos­sible pandemic, tho World Bank and the United Nations have said. 
"We're talking about a tremendous amount of money here for an issue that is dear­ly of global importanen. Tho stakes are very high," said James LeDuc, a viral illness expert at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
The U.S. pledge, in grants and technical assistance, includes $56 million for ani­mal and human health sup­plies, said the statement announcing the pledge. It was to be reloasnd at tho eeromo­ny later Wednosday. 
Conforeneo organizers had expected tlw United States to make one of tho largost plndges, somowhoro betwnon $200 million and $300 million. 
Tho pledge would also indudo $:~6 million to support international health organiza­tions, $15 million for non-gov­ernmnntal organizations and tho privatn sector, and $41 million for international rosnarch, tho statement said. 
On Tuesday, tho Europnan Union and drug makor Hodw sharply inr.roasod tlwir eom­mitmnnt to combatting bird flu.

School district suspends 'intelligent design' course 
Associated Press FRESNO -Under legal pres­sure, a rural school district Tuesday canceled an elective philosophy course on "intelligent design" and agreed never to pro­mote the topic in class again. A group of parents had sued the El Tejon school system last week, accusing it of violating the constitutional separation of church and state with "Philosophy of Design," a high school course taught by a minis­ter's wife that advanced the notion that life is so complex it must have been created by some kind of higher intelligence. 

In the federal court settlement, the district agreed to halt the course at Frazier Mountain High next week and said it would never again offer a "course that promotes or endorses creation­ism, creation science or intelli­gent design." 
"This sends a strong signal to school districts across the coun­try that they cannot promote cre­ationism or intelligent design as an alternative to evolution, whether they do so in a science class or a humanities class," said Ayesha N. Khan, legal director for Americans United for Separation of Church and State, which represented the parents. 
In a landmark lawsuit, Americans United successfully blocked the Dover, Pa., school system last month from teaching intelligent design alongside evo­lution in high school biology classes. U.S. District Judge John 
E. Jones III ruled that intelligent design is religion masquerading as science. 
However, some activists con­tended that Jones' ruling opened the door to teaching intelligent design in philosophy or religion classes. 
The settlement in the El Tejon school district was announced just before a judge was sched­uled to hold a hearing on whether to halt the class midway through the monthlong winter term. 
All five of the cash-strapped district's trustees voted to settle the potentially expensive case, said Pete Carton, the district's attorney. The class started Jan. 3 with 15 students. 
El Tejon Superintendent John Wight said the subject was prop­er for a philosophy class. But Americans United argued the course relied almost exclusively on videos that presented reli­gious theories as scientific ones. 
District officials were encour­aged to settle by the Discovery Institute, a Seattle-based think tank that supports intelligent design and which had filed a court brief in favor of the Dover school board. 
The El Tejon class "was mis­conceived," said John West, a senior fellow at the institute. "It was almost all about Biblical cre­ationism, not intelligent design." 
Sharon Lemburg, a social stud­ies teacher and soccer coach who taught "Philosophy of Design," defended the course in a letter to the weekly Mountain Enterprise.

Sept. 11 workers die of illnesses 
Direct link between ground zero, fatalities unclear 
Associated Press 
NEW YOHK-James Zadroga spent I(J hours a day toiling in tho World Trade Contcr ruins for a month, breathing in dobris-chokod air. Timothy Koller said he eoughed up bits of gravel from his lungs arter tho towers fell on So pt. 11, 200 I. Felix llernandflz spflnt days at thn site helping to search for vietims. 
/\II tlmm men died in the past seven months of what their families and colleagufls say were pnrsistent respiratory iii­IHJsses diroetly caused by their work at ground zero. 
While thousands of people who either worked at or lived near the site have reported ail­nwnts such as "trade center eough" sinee the terrorist uttacks, sonul say that only now are the eonsnquenees of work­ing at the site beeoming heart­breakingly eloar. 
"I'm very fearful," said Donald Faeth, an emergeney medieal teehnieian and of'ficer in a union with two of the ground znro workers who died last year. "I think that thnre are several people who died that day and didn't realize that they dind that day." 
Some of'fieials say it is too early to draw that eonclusion. Doe tors running different health screening programs say it will take decades to get a clear picture of the long-term health effeets of working at ground zero. 
Tho eity Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, whieh is tracking the hnalth of 71 ,000 poople exposed to Sept. 11 dust and debris, said last week that it is too soon to say whether any deaths or illnesses among its enrolled members are linked to trade center exposure. 
But Hobin llerbert, who directs a medical-monitoring program at Mount Sinai Medical Center for more than 14,000 ground zero workers, said "certainly it is not incon­ceivable" thal a person could die of respiratory disease relat­ed to Sept. 11.

Keller went home to Levittown on medical leave in March. He died on June 23 of heart disease complicated by bronchitis and emphysema, the Nassau County medical examin­er's ollice said. 
Felix Hernandez, 31, worked on rescue and recovery work at ground zero following the attacks, said his former super­visor, Lt. Hegina Pellegrino. In 2002, "it started with a cold he couldn't shake ... and it kept getting worse and worse and worse," she said. 
Hernandez was diagnosed with various respiratory dis­eases and was told by doctors 
contracted blaek lung disease and had high levels of mercury in his brain. Autopsy results have not been released. 
David Worby, an attorney rep­resenting more than 5,000 plaintiffs suing those who supervised the cleanup over their illnesses, said 21 of his clients have died of Sept. 11­related diseases since mid­2004. He said he was not authorized to release their names, but represented people who toiled at ground zero, at the Fresh Kills landfill in Staten Island where trade center debris was moved, and at the city morgue. 
"This is just the tip of the ice­berg," Worby said. "Many, many more people are going to die from the aftermath of the toxicity." 
Corzine sworn in 
as governor of N.J. 
Associated Press 
THENTON, N.J. -Jon Corzine was sworn in Tuesday as New Jersey's 54th gover­nor, promising ethics reform and an end to "fiscal gim­micks" that have papered over the state's financial problems. 
The former Wall Street titan turned Democratic U.S. sena­tor took the oath of oflice dur­ing an early afternoon cere­mony. His swearing-in ended a tumultuous period in state politics that began in 2004 when Gov. James McGreevey resigned after acknowledging

lie has estimated that the state will faee a $6 billion gap in the coming fiseal year budget that must be approved by July 1. 
"Too often, for too long, under both parties, liseal gim­micks have been invented, recycled, and reapplied to mask fiscal realities," he added. 
Corzine also stressed ethics reform, a common refrain 
during his cam­
paign and one 

state of New Jersey as one community with one future," Corzine told the crowd. 
Corzine, 59, beat Hepublican businessman Douglas Forrester by 10 points in November. The two spent more than $75 million, much of it their own money, making their contest the most expen­sive New Jersey governor's race ever. 
In his inaugural speech, Corzine said the state faces "tough choices" and that "every dollar squandered in violation of the public trust is a book not bought for a class­-at every level 
of New Jersey government. Let's award pub­lic contracts by competition and quality, not contribu­tions," he said. 
There is a year left on Corzine's Senate term, and he selected Rep. Hobert Menendez to succeed him. Menendez, 52, is to be sworn in Wednesday. 
Corzine went into politics after being ousted from Goldman Sachs, where he had been CEO, in a power dispute in 1999.

Because a zygote lacks a mind, there are only three ways to define person­hood so as to extend it to the not-yet­born. The first two are similar: one can claim that some common physical attribute (probably DNA) conveys per­sonhood, or one can claim that it is con­veyed by an immate­rial soul. This line of reasoning has given rise to the popular battle cry: "Life begins at concep­tion!" 
Many who follow this rallying cry probably used the soul argument. Therefore, saying "life begins at conception" is roughly the same as saying "souls arise at conception." Unfortunately, this last statement suffers from serious flaws, not the least of which is that it cannot be tested empirically. In my opinion, a nontrivial number of those who have been convinced of the pro-choice argument probably noticed some of the weaknesses in believing that human life beings at conception, and concluded that the rest is bunk. 
As rallying cries go, "life begins at conception" was useful, but it does more harm than good, and it is past time that pro-lifers abandoned the idea and its flaws and found a more useable alternative. The trick is to do so without compromising any of the ethical conclusions that follow from the pro-life philosophy. 
One such an alternative (and the third way of defining personhood) is not to define it at all, and instead to evoke an ethic of potentiality. The premise of this ethic brushes the entire question of the personhood of an embryo aside and creates an inde-

pendent ethical (and legal) category of potential sapient life with its own spe­cific rules. In general, one always treats this class of life with reference to what it could become, because it has the active potential (as opposed to the passive potential of sex eells) to indisputably become a person, and until personhood is assured, this potential is what is most important. The moral conclusion that killing a zygote is wrong follows from this. 
I don't propose to justify the ethic here, because my knowledge is not extensive, but I will point out two problems where the ethic succeeds and the "life begins at conception" argument fails: "zygote genocide" and "human chimeras." 
The zygote genocide problem is based on statistical evidence. It is estimated that the vast majority of all fertilized eggs (50 percent to 70 per­cent) die before implanting in the uterus. If a human soul arises at con­ception, then it follows that hundreds of millions of unborn humans die undetected each year of natural caus­es, many tens of billions since the genesis of the human species. It may, in fact, be the case that far more human souls die than are ever born. 
Theologically speaking, it is certain­ly possible that there are vast herds of human souls, of which we are almost totally unaware, continually migrating into the afterlife. At least, nothing prevents it from being so. However, is this situation plausible? Does it make sense that God would be so naturally wasteful of human lives? The thesis that human souls originate at concep­tion seems to fall to Ockham's razor -it is much more reasonable to place soul genesis (as Aquinas did, point of fact) some time after implanting, and to rely on the ethic of potentiality for the rest. 
The chimera problem is subtler. A human chimera is caused by an incredibly rare event (with less than 10 known cases) where two fertilized zygotes fuse into one human person. At the most extreme, a chimera can be split down the center -male on one side, female on the opposite. Others appear normal, with cells of each zygote spread throughout the body, and most probably pass unde­tected. (One chimerical woman was not discovered until she failed a maternity test for her own children). 
llowever, chimeras become a prob­lem when one tries to work a soul into the equation. Surely it cannot be the case that two souls are cooperating in a single physical body. Nor does it seein plausible to regard each set of cells as a separate body, which hap­pens to work intimately with another, since there is only one mind. It could be claimed that one soul has died, but why should that be when its body is alive in every sense of the word, and many hold that the soul remains in the body after brain death (c.f. Terri Schiavo)? Again, the most reasonable conclusion is that fusion occurs before souls are generated. 
Hopefully I have sown the seeds of doubt in your mind that "life begins at conception" is the best route, logically and apologetically, to a sound pro-life ethic. For my part. 1 am certain that it does more harm than good and effort needs to be focused on find its replacement. The ethic of potentiality may not be the best solution, but it points in the right direction.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR 
Examining Ali to's record 
I imagine thatthn numbnr of' Notre Dame stu­denL'i who gathnrnd around CSPAN to wateh hours of' Judge Samuel Alilo's eonlirmation hear­ings ovnr winter break is fairly small-one might say rninisculn. Most students view winter break as a nnednd vacation from the cerebral. However, in thn rnnewed spirit of academie interest at the bt~ginning of a new semester, we should all take a moment to consider the ramifications of Alita's nomination to the Supreme Court. The Senate .ludidary Committee rescheduled the vote on Alito's nomination for Jan. 24, making this the perfect time to dosely examine Alita's judicial 
rneord and tnstimony from the eonlirmation hearings. 
The first thing to keep in mind about Alito is that he was nomi­natnd to replace Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, a truly moderate and evnnhanded justice who was the swing votnr in controversial and influential casns including the separation of' church and state, dvil rights and abortion. I lind it both f'rightnning and illu­minating how the same far right 
that bmnoaned nominee I Iarriet Miers as not eon­servativn enough has rejoiced in Alito's nomina­tion, daiming him to be a "mainstream" conser­vative. Analysis of ;\lito's rulings as a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals reveals a consistent pattern of radically conservative decisions, a pattern we can only assume Alito would contin­U!l to follow if c:onlirmed to the Supreme Court. 
Make no mistake, Alito's decisions on repro­ductive privacy, firnarms, federalism, discrimi­nation and executive branch authorities show him a wholly eonservative judge masquerading as an even tmnp11red moderate like O'Connor. In Unitnd States v. Hybar, Alito dissented to block legislation regulating the transfer and posses­sion of machine guns at gun shows. In 1996, Alito was the only judge in a court of ten to dis­sent from the majority that voted to strike down a law making it extremely diflicult for women to allegn workplacn diserimination (Sheridan v. 
E.I.DuPont de Nemours and C.). Furthering his record as a judge who rarely sides with defen­dants alleging discrimination, Alito rejected dis­crimination elaims by an African American con­victed by an entirely white jury. That ruling was overturned because African Americans were illegally barred from the jury due to their race (Hiley v. Taylor). 
Alito dissented to uphold a Pennsylvania law requiring women to notify their husbands before having an abortion (Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey) and refused to answer Senators who asked him if the 
I find it both frightening and illuminating how the same far right that bemoaned nominee Harriet Miers as not conservative enough has rejoiced in Alita's nomination. 

Constitution protects the right to an abortion. During the con­firmation hearings, Alito's only response regarding Roe v. Wade was that he would keep an "open mind" if the issue came before the court again. 
Considering his previous rul­ings, I sincerely doubt that Alito has an open mind regarding abortion. It's especially impor­tant and pertinent to current events to examine Alito's 
defense in 1984 for Attorney General John Mitchell's illegal domestic surveillance. If you are troubled by the thought of the National Seeurity Administration eavesdropping on your phone ealls, you should be equally troubled by Alito's nomination. 
The eonstitutionality of abortion, free speech, discrimination, domestic spying and other such issues are certain to come before the Supreme Court in the time that Alito would serve as a Justice. These issues eoncern the hard won free­doms of all Americans and, given his record, Alito simply cannot be trusted to protect those freedoms.

In his famous "I Have a Dream" speech, Mississippi King dreamed "that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: 'We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men arc created equal' .. . that one day on the red hills of Georgia the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at a table of brothnrhood ... that one day even the state of Mississippi, a desert state, sweltering with the heat of injustice and oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice ... that my four children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character."

MOVIE REVIEW 

'Chronicles of Narnia' a charm_ing, faithful book adaptation 
By MOLLY GRIFFIN Assistant Scene Editor 
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe" has received a great deal of press, but most of it hasn't actually dealt with the film itself. 
Most press has focused on how the film compares to the massively popular "Harry Potter" franchise or analyzed how much of author C.S. Lewis's Christian themes made it into the movie. 
Fortunately for viewers, director Andrew Adamson's adaptation of "The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe" surpasses these

dren, who dis­cover the magi­cal realm of Narnia in the back of a wardrobe. The four children, Peter (William Moseley). Susan (Anna Popplewell), Edmund ISkandar Keynes) and Lucy (Georgie Henley), soon find themselves embroiled in a battle between the forces of good and evil in a land they never knew existed. 
Narnia has been in a state of perpet­ual winter under the rule of the tyran­nical White Witch, Jadis (Tilda Swinton), who maintains her power 

through a mix of spies, treachery and evil magic. She fears the arrival of the children, because they are an integral part of the prophesy that foretells the return of Asian the lion (Liam Neeson), who possesses the power to overthrow the witch. The children find themselves drawn into the battle for control over Narnia, and in the process, the four children learn a great deal about them­selves and the relationship they have with each other. 
The four actors who portray the Pevensie children do a decent job in the film, considering that they have to shoulder much of the acting burden in the movie. They aren't quite as adept at acting as their peers in the "Harry 
Potter" films,

the movie. 
Overall, "The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe" manages to prove what critics expected wrong. It isn't simply a "Harry Potter" rip-off, and it doesn't push a Christian agenda, as many expected. It is an entertaining film that is appropriate for all viewers, and, as a bonus for the studios, will probably prove to be a very lucrative franchise in the future.

"Brokeback Mountain" surprised no one when it won four categories at Monday night's 63rd Annual Golden Globe Awards, but the evening was still filled with plenty of pleasant surprises and humorous acceptance speeches. The latter may be attributed to the free booze at the awards, an aspect that dis­tinguishes the ceremony from the Oscars. 
Unlike the more formal and traditional Academy Awards, the Golden Globes are presented during a dinner party-the food and alcohol give the affair a more festive tone than its counterpart. Presenter Harrison Ford even brought his drink on stage and made co-presen­ter Virginia Madsen hold it. 
Ford's behavior certainly was not the oddest event of the evening. S. Epatha Merkerson, winner for her role in the made-for-TV movie "Lackawanna Blues," openly declared she was having a "major hot flash." Steve Carell, winner for his role in "The Otlice" on NBC, read a speech he said his wife wrote and was filled with multiple praises and thanks to none other than his wife. And finally, Geena Davis who won for her role as the President of the United States in "Commander In Chief," told a touching story of a little girl who said that because of her, she wanted to be presi­dent. Actually, Davis said, she made the whole thing up, but not before the story garnered admiring applause. 

"Brokeback Mountain" took home Best Motion Picture -Drama, and Ang Lee won Best Director for the movie. On the other side, "Walk the Line" won Best Motion Pictur.e -Musical or Comedy, and its stars, Reese Witherspoon and Joaquin Phoenix, both won for Lead in a Musical or Comedy. Felicity Huffman lost for "Desperate Housewives," but won Best Actress in a Drama for "Transamerica," and Philip Seymour Hoffman won Best Actor in a Drama for "Capote," beating out perennial favorite Russell Crowe and breakout stars Heath Ledger and Terrence Howard. 
The television part of the awards offered some shocking upsets, most notably Mary-Louise Parker winning Best Actress in TV Series -Musical or Comedy over four "Housewives" for her role in the Showtime series "Weeds." Sandra Oh, who got lost on her way to the stage, won for her supporting role in "Grey's Anatomy" and Hugh Laurie got a win for Fox for his lead in "House." It was no surprise when "Lost" won Best TV Series -Drama and "Desperate Housewives" won Best TV Series ­Musical or Comedy, even though the competition was exceptional in both cat­egories. 
With the Globes over, the entertain­ment industry can now focus on the grand-daddy of them all-the Academy Awards. The Globes often successfully predicts Oscar winners, but too much can happen between now and March 5, as was seen last year when "Million Dollar Baby" beat both Golden Globes winners "Sideways" and "The Aviator." 
courtesy 

The "Brokeback Mountain" table celebrates its Best Picture Golden Globe win with a bottle of champagne. The picture also won Best Director for Ang Lee. 
Oscar nominees are announced January 31, and two films that were missing from the Globes' best picture categories -"Crash" and "Capote" -are expected to be among the nominees for the Academy Awards. "Brokeback" may be the current favorite, but the addition of those nominees would put it into a whole new competition that it may not win. 
However, the Globes may be dead on for the best actor categories. As of now, Best Actress competition boils down to Reese Witherspoon and Felicity Huffman, and Best Actor comes down 

niscent of similar scenes in the "Lord of the Rings" films. It is admirable, though, that the makers of the film managed to pull off a convincing battle sequence with no blood and very little on-screen violence, which keeps it acceptable for children. 
All of the CGI in the movie, especially the digitally-created characters like Asian, is very impressive. It is good enough to create the magical atmos­phere necessary for the film to work, but it is real enough so that it doesn't detract from the beautiful scenery in between Philip Seymour Hoffman and Joaquin Phoenix. Now that all four actors have won the Globe, there is no doubt they will be among the Oscar nominees. 
Hollywood has only a few weeks to regroup and decide who it wants to crown with Oscar gold, but Monday night was all about the Globes, which has gained significant prestige over the years. Movie and television stars gath­ered for one night to honor the year's best and take advantage of the open bar.

Irish lose 2006 Tostitos Fiesta Bowl, 34-20, as Buckeyes' offense rolls

Ohio State started on its own 15-yurd linn and got a first down to tlw 26, but Notre Damn's dnfonso tightened, hold­ing the Buckeyns to -1 yards on first and socond down.

Notre Darno nevertheless found itself in position to tie the game late, and a crucial third quarter call also prevented the game from bning even closer. 
Down 21-7 at the half, the Irish scored the first second half points on a 10-yard Darius Walker touchdown run, his sec­ond of three on the day. Place­kicker D . .J. Fitzpatrick missed the extra point to make the seoro 21-13. And Ohio State seemed unfazed with a 44-yard completion to wide receiver Ted Ginn, Jr. (X catches, 167 yards, one touchdown) on first down to the Notre Dame 21-yard line. 
But three plays later, Buekeyes wide receiver Anthony Gonzalez fumbled a completion on 3rd and 12 deep in Notre Dame territory. Irish strong safnly Tom Zbikowski scooped up the fumble and scampered the field's full length for the score. 
Not so fast, said the referees -first by throwing a !lag, then by reversing the play entirely. 
"I think everyone who saw the scoreboard saw what hap­pened. I guess everyone has their own opinion," Irish wide receiver Jeff Samardzija said. "I guess the refs have their own opinion, too." 

First, Notre Dame defensive back Leo Ferrine was called for a block in the back, negating the touchdown. But then the ref­erees reversed

But Charlie Weis' team came away from Arizona with something

trophy and a tan -motiva­tion. 
All that was needed for Notre Dame to be everyone's preseason No. 1 pick in 2006, besides the early departures of Vince Young and Reggie Bush, was a convincing Irish victory over the Buckeyes in the final Fiesta Bowl to be played at Sun Devil Stadium. 
But Weis' first season didn't end like it was supposed to. 
Maurice Stovall's final game came to a conclusion without a touchdown. 
Mark LeVoir and Dan Stevenson's dedicated careers hit a scarlet­and-gray dead end. 
Despite the frustration of many underclassmen for not giving the seniors a better going-away party, this loss could be the best thing to happen to the Irish. 
With Brady Quinn, Jeff Samardzija and most other starters returning, the team will be as tal­ented as any in college football next season. 
After the loss, that talent is much hungrier-617 yards hungrier, in fact. 
That's the amount of total offense Jim Tressel's Buckeyes racked up on Notre Dame. 
The Irish coaches' task of keep­ing egos under control suddenly became a little easier after Ohio State blew past Notre Dame in a game that wasn't as close as the score indicated.

take plenty of execution to topple Joe Paterno and Penn State one week later. And Reggie Bush or no Reggie Bush, winning at USC in next year's regular-season finale will require intense focus. 
Regardless of how well Smith ran the Buckeyes' offense and how effectively Hawk stopped the Irish running game, it was the lack of passion, execution and intensity that clouded Notre Dame's experi­ence in the Valley of the Sun. 
As he has insisted all season, Weis says the play of the team rests mostly on his shoulders. He is not a genius, a miracle worker or a messiah -just a few of the names for the coach thrown around by Notre Dame fans in 2005. 
Weis is a football coach, a very good football coach, but too often the media and fans tag Weis and others in his business as miracle workers before a miracle is per­formed. 
There was no miracle in Tempe. 
Instead, one team was outplayed 
by another in a

Weis will surely give them plenty of food for thought.

Notre Dame's defense could not l'ind a consistent answer for Troy Smith, Antonio Pittman, Ted Ginn and company on Ohio State's oiTensive end. 
That meant fewer carries for Walker and more passes to mount a comeback from the 21-7 halftime deficit. 
But the game didn't start that way. 
Walker carried the ball three times on Notre Dame's opening drive, which ate up 72 yards in six plays and only 2:01. Walker's third carry was a 20-yard touchdown run.

CLAIRE KELLEY/The Observer Notre Dame running back Darius Walker strides forward for several of his 93 rushing yards Jan. 2 against Ohio State. 
The Irish were able to block and contain Ohio State's aggressive linebackers on the play, despite solid pene­tration by Hawk and others.

lie accounted for nino of tho team's 21 rushing touchdowns and 68 percent of its offense on the ground. Add that to his 43 catches for 351 yards and two touchdowns, and it creates a productive and efficient 
ground game that balances an offense. 
But when the opposition forces Notre Dame into passing situations like Ohio State did in the Fiesta Bowl, the strength in the running game is negated. 
"It depends on us," said Irish defensive back Ambrose Wooden, a mem­ber of the secondary that surrendered two long touchdown passes leading to the early deficit. 
"We didn't play like Notre Dame has this entire sea­son," Walker said. "So that's what really hurts about losing this game is that we lost to a team but we really didn't come to play."

Ohio State aimed to extend its 21-7 lead as Buckeyes' kicker Josh Huston lined up for a 2R-yard field goal. 
But Ndukwe slipped through the line to block the kick and keep the deficit at 14 points. 
Laws' play came after Ohio State's second drive of the second half and with the Irish still trailing 21-7.

CLAIRE KELLEYfThe Observer 

A season that many believe brought a spark back to the Notm Dame football program ended with a 
thud on Jan. 2 when the Irish fell to Ohio State :H-20 in the Fiesta Bowl. A.J. Hawk and the 
No. 1-ranked Buckeyes rushing defense held Darius Walker and Notre Dame to 62 total yards on the 
ground. Quarterback and Dublin, Ohio native Brady Quinn realized a childhood dream when the Irish were paired with the Buckeyes. But Quinn threw no touchdowns for the first time all sea.<?on and Ohio State sacked him five times-two courtesy of his sister's boyfHend Hawk. Though Quinn received most of the attention before the game after setting nearly every Notre Dame passing record thi..c; season, it was the Buckeyes' Troy Smith who shined under the desert sun as he went 19-for-28 for 342 yards and two TDs, including an 85-yarder to Ohio State speedster Ted Ginn, Jr. Irish coach Charlie Weis was frustrated that his team was only down 27-20 late in the game but couldn't force Ohio State to give the ball back, as running back Antonio Pittman streaked 60 yards down the Buckeyes' sideline with 1 :46 remaining to cement the victory. Notre Dame has now lost eight consecutive bowl games, with the last win a 24-21 victory over Texas A&M in the 1994 Cotton Bowl when Quinn was nine years old.

MOVIE REVIEWS 

McCarthyism exposed in Clooney's new film 
By LAURA MILLER Scene Critic 
George Clooney's "Good Night, and Good Luck" catapults the audience back into the 1950s and, despite the presence of many contemporary faces (including George Clooney, Robert Downey, Jr. and Jeff Daniels), is successful in achieving an authentic aura. 
Clooney and cinematographer Robert Elswit photographed the entire picture in black and white, which creates a strikingly unique film that is both enter­taining and informative. However, while the style and flow of the film make it cin­

Daniels is a superb contribution to the cast -he and David Strathairn (who plays Edward Murrow) are a crucial ele­ment in bridging the gap between the modern and historical film clips. 
As a whole, the film is well written, but screenwriters Clooney and Heslov some­times forget that not all of their audience members are familiar with McCarthyism. Although it is a famous event in American history, those who have little specific knowledge or experi­ence about the original broadcasting and events may be slightly confused at the beginning of the film. Despite this, the film's focus is clear, and once the audi­ence adjusts to the style of the movie, it is easy to follow. However, this initial

This artistic blending is made seamless through the excellence of the acting. Clooney and Downey are able to leave 

the subject will both enjoy the film more and extract more meaning from it. 
The story is very different from a typi­cal Hollywood movie in that it does not have the exciting plot line of many mod­ern films. Instead, it is much more reflective of real life. It has many char­acters that each have their own individ­ual story. It is a compilation of everyday events in the lives of everyday people that unexpectedly create something extraordinary. 
This style is to the story's advantage. The down-to-earth quality of the charac­ters and television blurbs allow the audi­ence to connect to the story and under­stand its pertinence to life as an American. The story is so authentic to the 1950s styles, manners of speech, behavior and life that it feels completely non-fictional. It becomes apparent that is it Clooney's goal to record a story, not to write one. 
Like no other movie that is out in the­aters, "Good Night and Good Luck" addresses the importance of American heritage. It leaves behind the typical themes of drama to address the issue of the common man and his role in our country. The tagline for the movie states, "We will not walk in fear of one anoth­er," emphasizing the need for Americans to confront issues valiantly at a grass­roots level. "Good Night, and Good Luck" inspires change in a country filled with fear and provides a hopeful outlook for the future.

Moss grows fat on 'The Family Stone' 
By KATIE BARON 
Scene Critic 
Every year, theaters are flooded with holiday films that emphasize the impor­tance of family. "The Family Stone," which, like its predecessors, is both comedic and bittersweet, is a contempo­rary take on this American stapl!l. Although the thoroughly modern family dynamic and the subtle manner in which the film deals with serious family issues are unique and worthy of note, overall the fllm is unremarkable. 
On the surface, "The Family Stone" is reminiscent of "Meet the Parents." Meredith Morton (Sarah Jessica Parker), an up-tight executive, travels to boyfriend Everett's (Dermot Mulroney) idyllic child­hood home to celebrate Christmas with his family. Although the Stone family wel­comes her, it is very 

The family's modern dynamic is particu­larly evident in a scene in which the homosexuality and deafness of the youngest son become a topic of conversa­tion at the dinner table. Although perhaps a bit overdone, the acknowledgement of the diversity in today's world adds interest to the film. Also, the understated scenes in which no words are spoken quietly inform the audience that all is not right with the Stones. Unfortunately, unimpressive per­formances and weak writing overwhelm these strengths. 
While Sarah Jessica Parker is generally a strong comedic actress, in this role, she is downright irritating. Meredith is obvi­ously "quirky," but while writer/director Thomas Bezucha intends for this quirki­ness to be endearing, Parker never tran­scends her character's annoying traits. 
Whether this is a result of poor writing or poor acting is difficult to say -most likely it is a result

wedding ring. This spective character, 

seemingly light film departs from the comedic genre with its somber undertones, which become increasingly apparent throughout the course of the movie. 
The script has a few schmaltzy lines, but for the most part, it avoids the saccharine sentimentality that runs rampant in other films of the romantic-comedy/family­drama variety. The Stones are fairly con­vincing as a real family with real prob­lems, and the cast conveys a sense of familial cohesiveness. 

Mulroney instead comes across as whiny and a bit imma­ture. 
The two strongest performances are given by Diane Keaton as Sybil Stone and Rachel McAdams as youngest daughter Amy. This mother-daughter pair particu­larly dislikes Meredith, and although they are merciless in their treatment of her, both Sybil and Amy are extremely likable. The audience gets the sense that they behave badly not because they are catty by nature, but rather because they care about Everett. Both actresses are skilled at balancing their cutting remarks with genuine expressions of concern for Everett's well being. 
The plot becomes somewhat ridiculous when Meredith convinces her sister Julie (Claire Danes) to join her for support. Chaos ensues, and a supposedly surpris­ing, yet tiresomely predictable swapping of partners takes place. This plot develop­ment reveals a major weakness in the film -the romantic relationships between the characters are not believable. Not only do the actors lack chemistry, but the writing in most of the romantic scenes sounds as though it were stolen from a bad episode of "Dawson's Creek." 
Unfortunately, the film's redeeming qualities cannot save it from the destruc­tive influence of its other much weaker elements. "The Family Stone" has its moments, but more often than not audi­ences will find themselves hoping for more.

Killingsworth leads Hoosiers over Illinois 
Pittsnogle scores 18 as West Virginia dominates Providence; Villanova erases halftime deficit, beats Seton Hall 73-64 
Asspciated Press 
BLOOMINGTON -Marco Killingsworth scored 20 of his 23 points in the second half to help No. 13 .Indiana beat No. 7 Illinois 62-60 on Tuesday night. 
Indiana (11-3, 3-1 Big Ten) won for the seventh time in eight games and became only the fourth team to beat the Fighting Illini in the regular­season since Jan. 24, 2004. The victory set ofT a wild celebration as Indiana extended its home winning streak to 11 against Big Ten teams. 
Illinois (16-2, 2-2) was led by Shaun Pruitt's career-high 17 points, but lost for the second time in three games. Brian Randle added 15 points, but leading scorer Dee Brown, who averaged 15.6 points, had just five. 
Roderick Wilmont tied his season high with 17 points for the Hoosiers. Illinois jumped to a 14-3 lead. 
Wilmont sparked an 18-0 run as Indiana held Illinois score­less for nearly six minutes late in the first half. The spurt ended when he scored the final four points to make it 27-19. 
The Illini closed to 28-24 at the half when Brown connected on a 3-pointer before the buzzer -his only basket of the night. 

Indiana used a 15-6 run in the second half to make it 55­40 with 8:23 to go. 
The lllini rallied with 12 straight points to close to 55-52 when Randle completed a three-point play with 4:52 left. Brown missed a 3-pointer with 
4.5 seconds left that would have tied the game. Jamar Smith tipped in the miss to make it 61-60. 
Robert Vaden then made one of two free throws with 3.6 sec­onds left, and Rich McBride's half-court heave at the buzzer was ofT the mark as fans raced onto the court. 
West Virginia 64, Providence 
48 

Providence was No. 12 West Virginia's final tuneup before a nationally televised matchup at No. 18 UCLA. It looked like it. 
Kevin Pittsnogle scored 18 points and grabbed 11 rebounds to help No. 12 West Virginia win its 11th straight game, beating Providence on Tuesday night. 
"We didn't shoot as well as we did [against Marquette] and still won by 15 or something," Pittsnogle said. "It's a great confidence builder for our defense." 
The 11 straight wins are the school's most since the Mountaineers won 22 in a row 

during the 1988-89 season. 
"It's really good news that we're not living or dying by the three," West Virginia coach John Beilein said. "And now we can look at the next game. Everybody knows who we play." 
West Virginia (13-3, 5-0 Big East) is also off to its best start in the league since joining 11 years ago. 
"The schedule is a little bit different this year," Beilein said. "Don't give us too much credit yet." 
Mike Gansey added 18 points for West Virginia. Pittsnogle and Gansey are the Big East's leading scoring tandem, aver­aging 22.8 and 21.8 points, respectively. The two also rank first and second, respectively, in Big East 3-point shooting per­centage. 
The game was the finale of a three-game homestand for the Mountaineers. West Virginia travels to California to face UCLA on Jan. 21. 
Pittsnogle could miss the game because his wife, Heather, is more than eight months preg­nant with their first child, a boy. Pittsnogle said he will fly back or stay behind if she begins contractions. The Feb. 1 due date has tempered his enthusi­asm for the game. 

"She can go anytime, that's why I am kind of nervous about it," Pittsnogle said of the trip. "Hopefully it doesn't happen Villanova 73, Seton Hall 64 After shooting a miserable 27 when I'm out there.

OLYMPICS 

American fans confused over host city's name 
The northern Italian city of Torino, commonly anglicized to 'Turin,' will host Winter Olympics in February 
Associated Press 
It's the Olympic version of "You say tomato, I say tomah­to." 
The city in northern Italy that's hosting the Winter Olympics next month is "Torino" to the locals and NBC. For most of us non-Italians, it's always been Turin. 
"I believe readers are seeing it on television with the NBC logo, it says 'Torino,' the Olympic Games," Ron Fritz, sports editor at The News Journal in Wilmington, Del., said Tuesday. "And then they see it in the paper, 'Turin,' and they're thinking we got it wrong." 
The explanation for the dif­ferent versions is simple. 
Sort of. 

"Turin is the English transla­tion of the Italian word Torino," said Clara Orban, a professor of Italian at DePaul University. "Standard practice in the United States is if a city name has been translated differently, go with the English transla­tion." 
That's what The Associated Press is doing. Its policy -and it was around long before Turin was awarded the Olympic Games -is to use the English version of foreign cities. It's Home, not Homa. Munich, not Muenchen. Moscow instead of Mockba or Moskva. 
And Florence isn't going to be called by its Italian name, Firenze. At least not without an accompanying map so people would know what city that is. 
"We use Turin in accordance with our long-standing style to use English names on English­language wires," said Terry Taylor, AP sports editor. "It's the Shroud of Turin, for instance, not the Shroud of Torino. And when the World Cup comes to Germany this summer, we will write that games will be played in Munich, not Muenchen. 
"Of course, in the interest of accuracy, we will not Anglicize the name in full references to the Olympic organizing com­mittee, which uses Torino, and we will not change Torino to Turin in quotations." 
The New York Times, Sports Illustrated and many other news organizations follow simi­lar policies. Travel writers at the Times, for example, have been calling cities by their English names for years. 
"For us, it's a pretty simple style rule," said Tom Jolly, sports editor at the Times. "We follow Webster's and The World Fact Book as our guide. Generally those are spelled in an Anglicized fashion." 
Even the Italians go with English translations sometimes. One of their top soccer teams is AC Milan, not AC Milano, and it's supposedly because when the club was founded, the namers wanted to stick with the sport's English roots. 
So why the linguistic confu­sion? 
The official name of the games is "Torino 2006," and the International Olympic Committee refers to the city by its Italian name. When the games were awarded in June 1999, then-IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch announced, "The hosts of the 2006 Games will be Torino." 
After NBC Sports chairman Dick Ebersol took a trip to Turin, he decided the network would go with Torino, too. NBC has the U.S. broadcast rights to the games. 
"Dick was hearing the way the locals were saying Torino, and how it's so magnificently Italian how it rolls off the tongue," said Mike McCarley, vice president of communica­tions and marketing for NBC Sports. 
"He decided on that trip that we would call it Torino." 
And with as many as 200 mil­lion people tuning in to watch the games, that means there'll be a lot of Americans speaking at least one word of Italian for a few weeks. 
USA Today also went with Torino because that is the offi­cial name, said Monte Lorell, the paper's managing editor for 


sports. said, "because that's what 
"We had to decide what is the readers will be seeing on TV." least confusing to our readers. So, Turin or Torino. You could say the Torino Either way, the Winter Olympics in Turin, but that just Olympics will simply call the leads to confusion," Loren said. city home next month. "We decided to just make it "I think," Jolly said, "people uniform all the way throughout. will be able to figure it out." 
"I feel a little bit better that Until they do, confusion is NBC is using Torino," Lorell sure to be the rule.

This pub thmn at lil'th plaee in the Ml/\A coming into tonight's showdown with eonli1mncB rival Albion Collegn. A win against the Britons would push the Belles up to lilllrth placn in the standings, a position now held by Albion. 
The Belles are pleased with thnir play in their last I0 games but know they have to improvo even more. 
"We've made tremendous progress," eoaeh Steve Bonder said. "Our inoxpnrieneed post play1:rs have ~:~Jrno long way. and our lrnshmon. 
Bonder believns his tnam is as good as anybody but is puzzlod about why it can't win at Saint Mary's. 
''I'm really proud of ability to play well on road," he said. "Wn've got to solve tho mystery of why wo play poorly at home. Wo need to stop it up at home, start­ing !tonight!." 
Despite the dillieulties while playing on their home court. tlw Belles had plenty of mmnorable games during the winter brnak. 
"We ean't shoot mueh bettor than we did at Kalamazoo -12 thrnes is a school reeord." Bendnr said. "We had a great garnn at Calvin and a groat game at Alma." 
When asked whic.h players had ~~arrind the tmun l.o iL-; rnennt 5-5 stroteh. Bender point1~d to his captains. as wnll as other roiP playnrs. 

"We havn l.,'roat vetnran loador­ship. IBridgol.l Boyc1~. IBridgotl Lipko, land Alison I Kossler, haw shown rnally gn~at loadorship ... and Nicoll~ Tucker has bonn shooting the ball wnll coming oil' tho bmch," he said. 
Tho Bnllns litce a ehallengP in Wednesday night's matchup against Albion Collnge. Tho two tmuns oach havo a 4-:{ rnmrd in the MIA/\, hut dnspitn thn post­season implications. the Belles think that they can boat tlw Britons to notch just their second win at homo. 
Bnndor dnsc.ribnd praetieos this woek as "just groat," adding, "Wo're starting to practkn likn a Vl)teran team." 
Tho Belh~s will rwod to haw a good week of praetico to win against Albion. a tough team with a 12-4 rneord overall. 
"Wo've got to ~~xm~ute ofllmsivn­ly tomorrow and cut down on turnovers," Bendor said. "Thoy arn a h'l'lmt tnarn dnli~nsivo team."

Associated Press 
HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. ­Eric Mangini has worked for Bill Parcells and Bill Belichick, learning from two of the greatest coaches in the NFL. 
The Jets are banking on that pedigree to lead them back into the playoffs. 
Despite his youth and relative inexperience, the organization hired Mangini as its coach Tuesday. The former Patriots defensive coordinator, who turns 35 on Thursday, becomes the youngest head coach in the league. 
Terms of the deal weren't known but it is 
believed he will get between $2 million and $2.5 million per year over five years. 
"Being compared to Bill Belichick is one of the highest compliments you can be paid," Mangini said. "I am not Bill Belichick, I am not Bill Parcells. I am Eric Mangini. I'm going to approach it my way. I'm going to take the experi­ences and the lessons that I learned from those guys and I'm going to apply that to my team." 
The baby-faced Mangini won't be confused with former coach Herman Edwards, who left for 
IN BRIEF 
Seahawks prepare to face tenacious Panther defense 
KIRKLAND, Wash.-Two weeks ago, Seahawks coach and former high school history teacher Mike Holmgren gave his assistants some homework for their playoff bye week -start studying the other NFC post­season teams and compile prelimi­nary scouting reports on each. 
Soon, the coaches were scribbling notes on large dry-erase boards in their offices. 
But when Washington became Seattle's first-round foe, the assis­tants erased all of the other teams' information. 
Thankfully for Holmgren, offensive quality-control coach Gary Reynolds copied the notes on the Panthers. 
"Bless his heart," Holmgren said. "So we did get a bit of a start on Carolina." 
He's glad they did. What Seattle's assistants saw dur­ing their extra studies -and what 
Kansas City last week. Mangini was reserved and low key at his introductory news conference, hardly exhibiting any of the fire and energy that is Edwards' trademark. 
But this is a new era for the organization, which hopes Mangini can instill a different attitude after the Jets finished 4-12 last sea­son. 
Much of those expecta­tions have to do with the people Mangini has worked under. 
While Mangini was going to Wesleyan, he figured he would be an investment banker. But he spent two summers studying in Australia while coaching a semipro football team. It was there he realized he wanted to go into coaching permanently. 
Mangini took a job as a ball boy with the Cleveland Browns, then went to work in the public relations department. 
He then met Belichick, who gave him a few assignments to do. Belichick liked his work and gave him a job as an assistant in 1995. 
From there he worked for Ted Marchibroda in Baltimore in 1996, then for Parcells and Belichick with the Jets from 1997­99. 

Holmgren saw on television -was an staunch Panthers defense led by athletic 6-foot-7 defensive end Julius Peppers and former Seahawk Ken Lucas in the defensive backfield. It's a unit that is sure to provide a stern challenge for Seattle's oll'ense, which led the league in points scored (452) this season. Teixeira inks $15.4 million contract with Rangers 
ARLINGTON. Texas-All-Star first baseman Mark Teixeira agreed to a $15.4 million, two-year contract Tuesday with the Texas Rangers, avoiding salary arbitration this year and next. 
Teixeira hit .301 with 43 home runs and 144 RBis last season. The RBis were the most for a switch-hit­ter, breaking the record set by George Davis, who had 136 RBis for the New York Giants in 1896. 
The Rangers also agreed to one­year deals with right-hander Adam Eaton ($4.65 million) and outfielder Brad Wilkerson ($3.9 million), avoid­ing arbitration with two players acquired in separate trades last month. 
Teixeira will get $6 million this season and $9.4 million in 2007. Hingis wins in first round of tlie Australian Open 
MELBOURNE, Australia -Martina Hingis looked as if she'd never been away. 
Playing on the center court where she won three of her five Grand Slam titles before retiring for three years, the Swiss star was right at home in the first major of her comeback effort, routing 30th-seeded Vera Zvonareva 6-1, 6-2 Tuesday in the first round of the Australian Open. 
Hingis' victory was all the more impressive in that she had so little trouble with Zvonareva, who became increasingly irritated with everything from Hingis' winners to disputed line calls, repeatedly spiking her racket and smashing balls in anger.

Irish see hard work pay off in Dallas, Evansville 
ByJACK THORNTON Sports Writer 
The Irish took advantage of the break from classes with a gruel­ing training schedule, which paid off with a road win against Evansville and a fifth-place finish in the 24th annual Dallas Morning News Classic. 
Coach Tim Welsh said the training went well for his team. 
"The weather was beautiful, and when you're training out­doors, good weather makes for good training," Welsh said of his team's two-week stay in Boca Raton, Fla. "We did a great deal of training, and I think we got a lot accomplished, so from an ath­letic point of view, it was great." 
Following a 10-day hiatus after finals, the team reconvened on Dec. 27 to train at St. Andrew's High School for 15 days of brutal work. 
"We had a lot of sunscreen on," said senior Patrick Davis. "A cou­ple of people got burned, but we knew what to expect,". 
Still, the No. 19 Irish weren't there to relax. 
"We were training four hours a day, every day, and we had some­thing likfl 39 straight practices," he said. "I don't remember the exact number, but Sunday was first day otr since Christmas." 
The team makes the trip to Florida annually, but this is the first time the Irish have been invited to the prestigious Dallas Morning News Classic. The meet's format had each school sending eight swimmers and one diver. 
In addition to the Irish, this year's field featured No. 7 Florida, which took first, followed by No. 16 Northwestern, No. 14 Florida State, host Southern Methodist, Notre Dame and Washington. 
"The field was extremely tough," Welsh said. "It was a great field, and with a small for­mat, it was probably the fastest field we've raced against." 
Though the Irish finished 120 points behind J-llorida and more than 100 points behind Northwestern, Welsh expressed no displeasure with his team's effort. 
"I thought our swims were very strong, and especially strong con­sidering where we were in our training phase," Welsh said. "The guys that swam there trained every day since the 27th ... they had a right to be tired. They wer~. tired and they still raced well. 
Among the highlights were 

freshman diver Michael Bulfin capturing second place in the three-meter diving, while junior Ted Brown took fourth in the 500-yard freestyle and sixth in the 200-yard butterfly with a season best time of1:51.76. 
The team was split, however, as last Friday had the Irish com­peting in both the Dallas meet and a dual meet in Evansville. Assistant coach Matt Tallman went with nine members of the swim team to Texas, while Welsh coached the remainder of the squad across the state. Despite missing many of the team's top swimmers, the Irish pounded their in-state foes 163-73 while capturing first in nine of 13 events. 
With the win, the Irish improved to 3-1 in dual meets on the road and 5-1 overall. Davis was one of three Irish swimmers to win in two events. 
"It was good because you could see people who don't normally win events step up and score a lot of points," Davis said. "Also it was good because everyone was tired after training so long in Florida, and yet we still posted good times after that." 
The team has developed since the beginning of the year, as swimmers have matured and grown into their roles. 
"The most important part is [having two road meets] gave us a chance to race on the road right after a training period, and it forced new people to step up in unfamiliar roles," Welsh said. "I think we'll be better this week­end and next weekend because we raced last weekend."

Team begins indoor season with solid showing at Purdue 
Irish send a select group of runners to West Lafayette in preperation for Notre Dame Opener this Saturday 
By JORDAN BELTZ Sports Writer 
While most of the student body was returning back to campus after Christmas break, a select group of Irish track and field team members competed in the Purdue Invitational, held Jan. 14 in West Lafayette. 
After the four-week holiday break, the Irish turned in a good performance, earning two first-place finishes and six second-place finishes. Although both sides notched solid starts to 2006, both first-pi ace finishes were earned on the women's side. 
The jumpers and throwers turned in the best perform­ances of the weekend, with the Irish women sweeping the high jump competition. Freshman Lauren Biscardi took home top honors, clear­
ing 1.68 meters to lead the way. Emily Loomis and Cassie Gullickson also were able to clear 1.68 meters, which meant the final order was determined by a jumpoff. 
Freshman Mary Saxer, fresh off of her NCAA qualification in the pole vault that she earned at the Blue and Gold Invitation in December, took home the pole vault title with a vault of 3.80 meters. 
''I'm pretty happy with how it went," Saxer said after qualifying for the NCAA Tournament. "It wasn't my best jump, but being my first college meet, and looking at where I am at this point in the season, I'm pleased." 
Other notable performances on the women's side of the ledger were turned in by Alyissa Hasan, who earned a berth in the Big East Championship with a long jump of 5.43 meters, and sen­ior Meghan Horn, who was the runner up in both the shot put and weight throw events. 
While the women turned in a stellar performance, the men showed a marked improvement from their first meet as well. The men saw their biggest improvement take place in the weight throw, with all four partici­pants in the event bettering 


their marks from the last meet. 
Junior Garet Koxlien lead the way, finishing second with a throw of 16.45 meters, fol­lowed by sophomore Kyle Annen in third. 
After Saturday's event, the Irish have now qualified 29 athletes for the Big East Championships in 20 different events, along with the spot that Saxer has locked up for the NCAA Championship to be held in May. 
The Irish will return to action this Saturday for the Notre Dame Opener, to be 
. held in Loftus. The Opener marks the first of three con­secutive home meets on the indoor track and field sched­ule.

NO WOMEN'S BASKETBALL 

Duffy is fearless leader of scrappy Irish squad 
Just seven minutes into the sec­ond half, Tuesday's game looked to be well on its way to being decided. After playing what coach Mullet McGraw called its best half of basket­
ball all year, Notre Dame seemed about to fold. Down 51-39 after an 18-0 DePaul run, things were 

not looking  Heather

team.  
But the  

Irish didn't give up. In fact, they responded by playing like they hadn't all year, coming back from 12 down and going on a run of their own while holding DePaul

some bad bounces." The Irish and Redhawks tied 2­2 Friday at the Joyce Center. 
Saturday night, in front of a sellout crowd including Notre Dame's hockey alumni and sever­al pro scouts, the Irish had early chances to open up a command­ing lead on the CCHA-leading Redhawks but couldn't find the net on several breakaway oppor­tunities. 
Then, 4:08 into the second peri­od, Miami defenseman Andy Greene was called for hooking, and just over a minute later, teammate Matt Christie was sent to the penalty box for high stick­ing. 
Irish coach Jeff Jackson said he was frustrated by the early missed opportunities. 
"We're in there chirping the same things the fans are," he said. "Shoot the puck, get to the net. I can't score for them." 
Still, after playing yet another close game against a top-ranked opponent, Jackson said he saw improvement in his squad. 
"I think our team's playing bet­ter than [our record)," he said. "Our four games against Miami were all decided in the last five minutes." 
The winning goal came with 
4:32 left on Saturday, despite the Irish coming back to full strength. 
The game was marked by sev­eral after-the-whistle skirmishes, including one in the third period that sent five players to the penal­ty box -three from Notre Dame. 
"The fact is that they're playing on the edge," Jackson said of his scoreless for 8:29 and coming away with a hard-fought 78~75 victory over the No. 10 Blue Demons. It was the first win over a top-10 team this year for No. 24 Notre Dame after the brilliant sec­ond-half comeback. 

"We've had a lot of practice get­ting behind big," McGraw said somewhat sarcastically after the game. 
The Irish, after all, had lost three of their last four Big East games before Tuesday night, two by at least 10 points, and all three to unranked teams. 
But this time was different, thanks to Megan Duffy. 

The senior point guard took this team on her shoulders for the entire 39 minutes she played. And for the minute she was out of the game in the first half, the Irish looked dazed and confused, forc­ing McGraw to put her star point guard and leader back in the 
players' emotions. ''I'm happy that they're playing on the edge, but they have to keep from going over the edge." 
The Redhawks took a 1-0 lead soon after killing off the Irish 5­on-3 early in the second period. 
Notre Dame responded after two more Miami penalties left them with their second 5-on-3 of the game at 10:40 of the second period. This time they capitalized as O'Neill rocketed home a shot from the point. 
"I just got a good pass from [freshman Erik] Condra, and the puck found the net," the junior said. 
The Redhawks took the lead again two minutes later, which lasted until the 9:54 mark of the third period when Irish defense­man Noah Babin slapped a long rebound in from the point to tie the game at two. 
The loss dropped the Irish to 7­12-3 overall and 5-8-3 and sev­enth in the CCHA. Their 2-2-2 mark during Christmas break included a four-game unbeaten streak bookended by frustrating losses. 
The break began with a 4-0 home defeat to Lake Superior State Dec. 17, but Notre Dame bounced back the next day to beat the Lakers 4-3. 
After heading home for Christmas, the Irish were next in action Jan. 6 and 7 at Nebraska­Omaha. Notre Dame went home with a 4-1 win and a 2-2 tie. 
The Irish stretched their unbeaten streak to four games with the 2-2 tie against Miami Friday before falling to the Hedhawks the next day.

game. 
Duffy played some of the best basketball she's played all year. Hitting shots when the shot clock was winding down, making key shot after shot. The 5-foot-7 guard even rebounded, pulling down a career-high eight boards. She just missed a triple-double, adding 23 points and nine assists to her game to go along with three steals and just two turnovers. 
She was the glue this Irish team needed to win the game. She set the tone, she played the way her team needed to play and they fol­lowed her without missing a beat. 
The normally offensively quiet Breona Gray hit two big threes while scoring 10 points on the night, lindsay Schrader hit big shot after big shot good for nine points and Crystal Erwin brought the attitude and physical presence to the post to help Courtney 
LaVere contain DePaul star Khara Smith. But it began and ended with this team's fearless leader. 
When she dove for a loose ball and was in obvious pain, she played through it. After the game, in typical style, she shrugged it off as nothing. Just like the Irish shrugged ofT DePaul's 18-0 run and kept playing hard. 
"I took a hard foul and two peo­ple fell on me," Duffy said non­chalantly when asked about the injury and the pain she appeared to be in. "I was fine after a few minutes of collecting myself and shaking it off. I was fine after that." 
As Megan Duffy does, this team does. And Tuesday night, the sen­ior point guard found a way to take Notre Dame all the way back to being a team capable of beat­ing a top-10 DePaul squad that had only lost one game before Tuesday, after the Irish had lost to inferior St. John's, Seton Hall and Louisville in previous Big East games. DuffY reminded this team what it is like to be the elite team it was a year ago. 

"And Megan, what can you say about Megan?" McGraw said at the end of her opening remarks. "Alinost a triple-double. That's the best point guard in America right there." 
And for those remarks to come from the ever-demanding Muffet McGraw, a former point guard herself-well, that speaks vol­umes for just how well Megan Duffy not only led but played on Tuesday night.

Upset 
continued from page 28 
East losses to St. John's, Louisville and Seton Hall, losses that dropped Notre Dame from No. 12 to No. 24 in the Associaed Press poll. 
"I think everybody's got to feel pretty confident after that game knowing we can beat a ranked team," Notre Dame head coach Muffet McGraw said. 
The Irish at times still looked like they were struggling team. After center Melissa D'Amico's layup gave Notre Dame a 39-33 lead early in the second half, DePaul went on a 4:28, 18-0 run to give the Blue Demons a 51-39 lead with 13:30 to play in the game. 

"During that stretch we had just some communication breakdowns because we were switching defenses so much," senior point guard Megan Duffy said. 
The Blue Demon run was started and led by guard Jenna Rubino, who had the first nine points of the stretch, all of them from behind the arc. 
Rabino's standout perform­ance was aided by Notre Dame's commitment to stopping All­American center Khara Smith from dominating inside the post. 
"We were trying to get some­one down there so she couldn't get the ball," McGraw said. "We were trying to limit her touch­
es." 
Ultimately, just as the Joyce Center crowd was on the verge of sighing a collective "here we go again," Notre Dame regained the form it had displayed at times early in the game. With 
13:06 left to play and the game quickly slipping away, guard Breona Gray hit a 3-pointer that ignited the Irish to their own 18­0 run, giving them a 57-51 lead with 6:46 to go. . 
"I wasn't really sure if I was going take it or not, but I was wide open, so I thought, 'Why not just take it?"' Gray said. ''I'm used to shooting wide open shots." 
During the game-changing run, five different Notre Dame players scored, including fresh­man guard Lindsay Schrader, who finished with nine points despite coming off the bench backing up Charel Allen, which has been an unfamiliar role for her this season. 
"It bothered me. I just wanted to prove to [McGraw] that I belonged in the starting line up," Schrader said. "Charel's an excellent player, you can't doubt that. She deserves to be in the starting lineup right now." 
With 2:40 left in the game, DePaul was able to cut the Irish lead to 63-61 after forward Rachel Carney hit a 3-pointer, but the Blue Demons were never able to regain the lead. Down the stretch, Duffy took over in the clutch, scoring six points in the fmal 2:11, includ­ing going 4-4 from the free throw line with less than a minute left to help ice the Blue Demons. Overall, she finished with 23 points, nine assists and eight rebounds, the latter tying a career high set back in 2003 against Villanova. 

In the end, McGraw somewhat sarcastically credited the Irish's recent struggles for the come­back win. 
"I don't think [falling behind big] really bothered us because we've been here before," she said. "I thought the preparation over the last couple weeks for that particular moment really helped us."

Duelers struggle in Texas

The Irish sent 14 of their top competitors to the non-NCAA North American Cup in Houston, Texas last weekend to help mea<>­ure themselves against the nation's top fencers. The event took place at the Brown Convention Center -the same venue where the Irish won the 2005 NCAA Combined Fencing Championship last season, and this year had 6 of the 11 fencers from that squad. 
However, this tournament was not a team-scoring event. "You only go to compete individ­ually and are not representing a
