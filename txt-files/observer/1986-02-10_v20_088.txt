Notre Dame administrators have been working behind the scenes for the past 20 months on a fund-raising campaign which they hope will be larger than the five previous cam· paigns combined, administrators said. 
The campaign, set to end in December of 1990, is still in its early stages, during which campaign leadership and large contributions are sought, accordingto Vice Presi­dent of University Relations William Sexton. 
The campaign has been titled "Notre Dame: A Strategic Moment," according to Assistant Vice Presi­dent for University Relations Ric· hard Conklin. 
In a speech on Oct. 2, .1985, University President Father Theodore Hesburgh revealed the campaign and its goal to faculty members. 
"... We are embarking on a sixth (campaign), larger than all the ot­hers put together," Hesburgh said. 
The money raised from the cam­paign, which would total more than S295 million if its goal is reached, 
will be used primarily for financial 
aid, administrators said. 
Endowed chairs, support for 
research and the construction of 
women's dorms will also be funded, 
according to Director of Develop­
mentjoseph Sandman. 
Although the campaign began 20 months ago and contributions and commitments made since July I, 1985 will count toward its goal, the campaign won't be officially an­nounced to the public until May, 1987, said Sexton. 
The campaign hasn't been offi­cially announced because ad­ministrators first want to collect large contributions which, when revealed at the formal announce­ment, will provide momentum to the campaign, said Conklin. He who would not say how much had been collected so far. 

Although Hesburgh didn't divulge specific details about the campaign during his October address, he did tell faculty members that they'd be hearing more about the campaign before it was publicly announced.

Politicians make stink over ethanol funding 
SOUTH BEND-Support Is eroding In the Indiana General Assembly for state subsidies needed to keep the 
S186 million New Energy ethanol plant In business, an Indiana legis­lator says. 
·.,It Is clear to me that someday they will have to sell the plant," said Republican Patrick Kiely of Ander­son, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. 
Ethanol is distilled from corn and other plants and Is used as an octane booster In unleaded gasoline. 
The plant's future Is uncertain wit­hout oncoming government sub­sidles of one form or another, said Donald Evans, vice president ofNew Energy. 

At issue in the legislature are two bills passed by the House that have been assigned to the Senate Rules Committee. Neither of the measures has made progress there. 
One· hill would continue to ex­empt gasoline blended with ethanol from one-fifth of the 5 percent sales tax assessed on gasoline. The ex· emption was adopted to 'enhance gasohol sales. 
The other would provide a direct subsidy of about S7.8 million in the next tlscal year to New Energy in the form of monthly payments of 1i cents for each gallon of ethanol produced. 
After assigning the bills to the Rules Committee, Sen. Robert Gar· ton, R·Columbus, Senate president pro tempore, said it was his under­standing that the subsidies, which have been paid since the plant bega11 production 15 months ago under authority of previous legislation, were due to expire July 1. 
Garton said he is opposed to direct subsidies and that "either et· hanoi has caught on in the market or it hasn't." 
Evans said his·company believed it would receive state support for the next fiscal year beginningJuly I. 
"If we had known we would not be supported by the state for two years we would not have located in Indiana," he said. "We thought we had a good-faith commitment from Indiana." 
Reasons for continued subsidies were cited by New Energy President Barry Dlrenfeld In a letter last week to Mutz. 
He cited decreasing oil prices, which make ethanol less com­petitive in price, and cheaper lm· ported alcohol from Brazil. 
New Energy also is losing revenue from the sale ofdistillers dried grain, a high-protein livestock feed and by­product in ethanol production, Direnfeld said. Prices for the by· product have dropped from n 80 a ton in 1981 to $921ast year, he said. 
That large decrease more than of­tset the savings gained in declining prices New Energy pays for corn for its plant, he said. 
Even with continued state sub­sidies, New Energy would suffer a net loss of $853,000 to S4 million in the next fiscal year, according to figures Direnfeld prc:sented to Gar· ton. 
Former contras leader blasts CIA for methods, views in Nicaragua 
By DAN McCULLOUGH 
News Editor 

When the Nicaraguan contras allied themselves with the Central Intelligence Agency, it was one of the worst things that could have happened to the contras cause, ac· cording to Edgar Chamorro, a former contras leader. 
Chamorro, who spoke last night in front of approximately 300 people in the Memorial library auditorium, said he split with the contras cause because of .the growing lnftuence ofthe CIA in the Nicaraguan Democratic Forces (FDN), the contras group he co· founded. 
Chamarro said he struggled with the CIA's methods and philosophy toward the Nicaraguan situation. He told the story of a CIA agent who arrived dressed entirely in black who called himself the "priest ofdeath." 
"He thought he was the priest of death, but they nicknamed him 'the umpire,' like in baseball," he said. · 
"One of the first things that really surprised me was when I found out that we were killing prisoners as policy," said Cham­moro. 
Another thing that disturbed him, he said, was the manual for guerilla warfare that the contras put together with the cooperation of the CIA. "Morally, it was of­fensive for me . . . . That manual was recommending that we FDN train our people to hire profes· sional criminals, to kill selected people. And one of the things that really shocked me was there was this paragraph about creating mar­tyrs." 
"It was planned. It was pre­planned in cold blood," he said. "That meant some of us had to go In the process." 
Another problem Chamorro said he had with the CIA was that their intentions and those of the FDN's were not the same. 
"Your Intentions, objectives and motives must be similar, must match with your partner in a politl· cat joint venture. What objective? To overthrow the Nicaraguan government. But you could not say that." 
Instead, Chamorro said that American interests forced the FDN to comply to a policy of duplicity. "We were going to overthrow the government of Nicaragua. But we cannot say that in public. There was an element of duplicity. And the duplicity was that we were supposed to talk to the press and the Congress in different terms." 
But Chamarro said he could no longer go along with this, and in November, 1984, he decided to go public. "In this speech, I said our purpose was to overthrow the San· dinista government," he said. "I realized that the moment I was giving my personal opinion, the moment I was getting the wrong kind of feedback from the people in Washington," he said. 
Soon after that, Chamorro said, he knew the situation was wrong and he had to do something about it. 
"I thought I was a very con­servative person, but my group moved so much to the right that now I am called a Sandanista agent . . . just because I dare to tell the story, and because I want to say that If we are going to help Nicaragua or Central America It has to be out of honesty. People don't trust politicians, much less politicians who are being paid by America to prowl around," he said. 
"There is very disgusting manipulation. There are people out there who have created the policy that is not very clear in the objective, the Interest and the motive," he said. 
Chamarro said he is now opposed to the policies of the con­teas, and,is working toward finding other solutions to the Nicaragua problem. 
"1 believe there are other al­ternatives like diplomacy, like political pressures that should be used. I don't believe Nicaraguan people should die in this futile policy that has not even been defined," he said. "This policy has not worked so It must be im­mediately stopped." 
"Right now I am trying to find the political solution to the Nicaraguan conflict," he said.

Volunteering to help others: a calm in the eye of the storm 
The Career and Placement Office everyday is a Grand Central Station of future-hunting seniors, ranging from the confident to the frantic. At the Freshman Year of Studies Office, only its inhabitants' slightly younger faces differentiate it from the seniors' stomping ground. In the library, the middle classes are squirming and sweating under a pile oftextbooks and term papers. 
As students spin around and around, bouncing from class to interview to lab to dorm to dining hall to library, the Administration Building swells with talk ofcolossal fundraisers, student body diversity, and the constant tug-of-war between teaching and research. Money needs to be generated for new classroom facilities and an automated library and dormitories and .... 
This tornado ofgrowth and progress touches down a few times and wreaks havoc with such ideals as the Uni­versity's mission and its Catholic identity. 
One afternoon last September I needed to find respite from this funnel ofacademia. I was searching for 
an idea to fill this space and I ended up near the library reflecting pool. I looked for inspiration in the trees, in the cracks of the sidewalk, even at the bottom of the pool where there was not­hing but slang etched in dirt. 
Several ideas passed through my head, but none stayed around long enough for me to grab onto it. When I had just about given up on finding an idea in this sector of campus I noticed a young man, another student, walking in my direction from the Library Circle. He had with him a small child, about four or five years old. The boy was oriental and the

know. Problems of astrophysics and Aristotle were being analyzed. Students were questioning existential philosophy and the balance ofpower in Latin America. 
But on the outside, another student was using the building to teach a very simple lesson: top and bottom. He was sharing his language and his time with another person. 
This student may participate in the Big Brothers-Big Sisters program, or NCAA Volunteers for Youth or any number ofservice oriented organizations, or none at all. 
The point is that this Notre Dame student had jumped out ofthe collegiate tornado to give of himself for someone else. 
Father Hesburgh remarked about his stu­dents' generosity and social consciousness in an inter­view that appeared in the Oct. 17, 1985 edition ofCat­holic New York. "We have 2,000 students working in various programs all over town, programs that help people in one way or anot­her. And about 10 percent of our graduates volunteer a year or two of their lives for some kind of public service," he said. 
"They've (the students ) gotten the message that you've got to be a part of the community, even if it's only temporary," he continued. 
Whether the students finally have grasped a message ofresponsibility, or simply have grown to realize an un­complicated sense of priority is an issue that can be debated. But the fact remains that students are caring. 
Later that afternoon I saw the student and the boy leaving the library. The former probably had taken his small friend to the 13th floor so that he could show him the whole campus, this institution of higher education. The college student may have been carrying the boy on his shoulders, but it was the latter who was saving his teacher from the tornado. 
Notre Dame student obviously was trying to teach him English. The two stopped in front of the library, directly under the mosaic. 
"Top, that is the top," the young man said squatting down to the boy's level and pointing to Jesus on the library wall. 
"Top," the boy repeated. 

"You are at the bottom," the young man patted the ground as he spoke. "Do you want to go to the top?" "Top," the boy said again. The couple then straightened up and walked out of 
my earshot, toward the library. The boy tried to put his arm around the student, but he could only hold onto his leg. All the while he was looking to the top. 
It struck me then how ironic this situation was. Inside this looming structure, both a working tool and a syn~­bol of all the higher learning Notre Dame tries to stim­ulate, hundreds ofpeople were studying books written in more languages than even Father Hesburgh must

Students to the rescue of confused taxpayers 
ByJOHN M. COONEY 
News Staff 

Some Notre Dame students soon 
will be coming to the rescue of 
South Bend residents who are 
befuddled by loopholes, dependents 
and deductions. 

Notre Dame's Department of Ac­
countancy will once again sponsor a 
tax assistance program from Feb. 8 
to April 15 at nine sites In South 
Bend, Mishawaka and on the Notre 
Dame campus. 

Several faculty member, 45 stu­
dents and 12 to 20 certified public 
accountants from eight local firms 
will participate in this year's 
program, according to Kenneth 
Milani, associate professor of ac­
countancy and advisor to the 
program. 

Students participating in the 1'5 year old program will prepare the tax returns for eligible local resi­dents. Last year, students helped file 1,600 returns generating $278,000 in tax returns. 
The tax assistance program is open to students, who have com­pleted Accounting 476, Introduc­tion to Federal Taxation. The students learned to fill out "all the federal forms and the State of In­diana tax forms," Milani said. 
Not only does the program provide a valuable service to the community, but the students par­ticipating also gain excellent ex-

perience in dealing with tax related 
problems, said Milani. 

"The program allows students to 
apply some knowledge that they 
gained in a practical manner and as­
sist people that need their help," he 
said. 

Tim Kimmel, senior accounting 
major and a center supervisor for 
the program, said that because "you 
are actually working with real 
people with real problems ... you 
can gain invaluable experience." 
The program is different from 
classroom experience because it 
forces the student to "recognize, 
react, and respond to a variety of 
situations in a short period of time," 
said Milani. 

Although other universities h~ve similar programs, Milani said the Notre Dame program is unique in that it goes into the neighborhoods. This opens up the program to people who would not otherwise come to the university to have their tax forms completed. This is "a real hurdle for most people," admitted Milani. 
The Notre Dame tax assistance program is open to people whose . income is under $20,000 a year and to the unemployed. Those eligible and Interested should bring to the program such items as the tax package, W-2 earning forms, bank in­terest statements and a copy of last year's tax return if possible. 
Information about the times and locations of the program is availahle by calling 239-'5296.

PHILADELPHIA -A jury found a 
MOVE member guilty of riot and 
conspiracy yesterday in a confronta­
tion between police and the radical 
group that left 11 people dead and 
61 homes destroyed by fire. 

Ramona Africa, 30, was acquitted 
on 10 other counts, including ag­
gravated and simple assault, reck­
lessly endangering and resisting 
arrest. 

A common Pleas Court jury 
deliberated over three days before 
issuing the verdict. 

The charges stemmed from the 
siege in May that began when police 
tried to arrest Africa and three other 
members of the armed radical cult. 
An early-morning shootout gave 
way to a day-long standoff that 
ended when police dropped a bomb 
on MOVE's fortified headquarters 
and touched offa fire that destroyed 
15 blocks. 

Africa, the only adult MOVE mem· ber known to survive the battle, represented herself at trial. She con· tended pollee and city officials had conspired to annihilate MOVE. 
Police have said they brought heavy weaponry to the siege be­cause MOVE had threatened violence and had once before, In 1978, drawn police Into a shootout In which an officer was killed. 
Former Police Commissioner Gregore Sambor testified the bomb was intended to blow a hole in the MOVE compound's roofso that tear gas could be inserted. 
The only other MOVE member known to survive the fire was 13­year-old Birdie Africa, now known as Michael Moses Ward.

New social group seeks active role 
By MARK MELLETT 
News Staff 
In the spirit of "We are the World," the Overseas Development Network, Inc. seeks students who want to play a direct role in global development issues. 
ODN, Notre Dame's newest social concern group, was started by senior Paul Aiello and junior Sophia Twarog, with the help of Ken jameson, professor of economics. The club is in conjunction with the original ODN, which was es­tablished in Massachusetts in 1983. 
With the Catholic tradition of 

Notre Dame, ODN hopes to tap the 
resource of human compassion, 
Twarog said. She said the group is 
seeking to bring those who 
genuinely care for the welfare of ot­
hers into the organization. 
"As a Catholic university, we should be called to more than academics," says Twarog. "It's a good outlet for the need that stu­dents have to be a part of social development and welfare." 
Twarog said a unique aspect of ODN is that they actually take part in the financial development of a region in a Third World nation. Through activities such as films, lectures and dances Twarog said she hopes to raise enough money to fund a small-scale development project in an underdeveloped area ofLatin America, Africa or Asia. 
Grassroots projects already es­tablished by the ODN of Massac­husetts include tricycle making and tree planting projects in South America and Africa. 
Within the activities, the student will be orientated to the culture of the nation dealt with, Twarog said. 
"A key part ofODN is education," she said. Twarog plans to bring adv­ocates of social development to 

Comedian activist comes to ND 
By PRATIBHA TRIPATHI 
News Staff 
Using humor in the crusade for a better world, Dick Gregory will speak to the Notre Dame campus as part ofblack awareness month at the library Auditorium today at 7 p.m. 
Although not as well-known to students as the other campus speakers, Gregory is an influential human rights activist. He is also an author, lecturer, philosper, political analyst and expert on nutrition and diet control. 
His lack ofpopularity is one ofthe 

reasons Esther Ivory, chairwoman of 
Black Cultural Arts Festival, cited for 
bringing Gregory to the campus. 
"We want to introduce blacks that aren't well known," Ivory said. "The purpose is to bring people, in par­ticular blacks, who would not or­dinarily be invited." 

Gregory began his career as the first black comic to work in first-line white night clubs. From a comedian to a humanitarian, he bridged the gap between the black and the white byshattering the color barrier. 
As the '60's progressed, Gregory joined the budding civil-rights movement. Inspired by Gandhi, Gregory began experimenting with prolonged fasting in protest of the Vitnam War. 
He has fasted over 100 times, at up to 167 days, to draw attention to im­portant issues such as the plight of blacks, acid rain, and the ERA. An­ticipated topics of Gregory's speech are apartheid in South Africa and hunger in Ethiopia. 
Once weighing over 300 pounds, Gregory transformed his body to its present lean state. He became a leading advocate for a vegetarian diet and better health. Gregory focuses on individual diet and health as a common ground, a practical starting point for healing and change. 
Knowledge of his talent spread quickly and he became a regular on television, becoming popular for his one-liners. A best seller on health and nutrition, "Cooking with Mot­her Nature," is one of his eight writ­ten works.

The Deportment of Communication &Theatre in conjunction with The Kellogg Institute present the first of six films in The Latin American Film Series 
Notre Dame to lecture and wants to present workshops headed by Notre Dame proffesors. 
Twarog said ODN considers itself a liason to an awareness of what is avaible in organizational work for students. Presently, 1,500 develop­ment organizations are offered. ODN can "open the door for stu­dents in the long term with inter­nships a~d job training," Twarog said. 
ODN also hopes to strengthen the quality and organizational effective­ness of campus organizations, she said. By working with RASTA, World Hunger Coalition and SOLA, the new group wants to unify the potential of the campus. 
"We have a lot of ideas," Twarog said. "Frankly, I feel we have the energy to follow through on it." 
The group's frrst meeting will be tonight at 7 in the Center for Social Concerns.

Manila vote counters walk away, claim Marcos falsified returns 
Associated Press 
MANILA, Philippines · Thirty computer operators marched out of the government's election commis­sion yesterday, claiming the ballot· counting that showed President Ferdinand Marcos defeating Corazon Aquino was falsified. 
An international observer group, meanwhile, accused Marcos' par· tisans on yesterday of vote-buying, intimidation, snatching ballot boxes and tampering with election returns in Friday's special presidential elec­tion. 
~e computer operators wept on each others' shoulders after parad­ing single file out of the Marcos­appointed commission's counting center. 
"There was something wrong," a woman operator explained. "What's posted on the tabulation board does not tally with the computer board, and we don't know who is doing it. We can't take it any more." 
The woman, who refused to give her name, told The Associated Press that workers spotted the problem Saturday night, when Aquino was leading in the commission's count by 100,000 votes. By midday yester-

Calm returns to riot-tom Haiti 
Associated Press 
PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti · After two nights ofwild rejoicing and mob retaliation against the hated secret police of the ousted Duvalier regime, life began returning to nor­mal yesterday in this slum-ridden city of 1 million people. 
Trashed, burned-out shells of businesses that were associated with the 28 years of Duvalier family rule bore silent witness to a celebration that turned violent, killing at least 100 people and causing great material damage. 
jean-Claude Duvalier became Haiti's "president-for-life" in 1971 at age 19 on the death of his father, Francois "Papa Doc" Duvalier. He fled to France on Friday on a U.S. air Force plane with about 25 family members, guards and associates after the United States and Jamaica convinced him to step down in the face of mounting violence.

day. Marcos had taken over the lead. 
By this morning, with 28 percent of the precincts reporting, the com­mission's unofficial tally gave Marcos 3,056,236 votes to Aquino's 2,903,348, a split of51.28 percent to 
48.72 percent. 
Butanindependentcountbythe National Movement for Free Elec­tions, a citizens' ballot-monitoring group known as Namfrel, had Aquino in the lead by 5,576,319 votes to 4,806,166 for Marcos, or 
53.7 percent to 46.3 percent. 
The Namfrel tally represented 
49.14 percent of the Philippines' 86,036 precincts. Final election results from this nation of 7,100 is­lands are not expected for days. 
After the workers· 27 women and three men · marched out, tabulation was suspended. The total number of workers tabulating was not known but there were about 300 com­puters in the center. 
Victorino Savellano, chairman of the nine-man Commission on Elec­tions which operates the tally center, denounced the workers' charges as "a political attempt to sabotage our efforts." He said the commission's count is based on aut· henticated tally sheets which "are beyond doubt" and which anyone could see. 

Marcos, who initially predicted an 80 percent landslide, was hard­pressed throughout his first seriously contested campaign since 1969, when he won re-election by defeating former Sen. Sergio Os­menaJr. 
In 1972, Marcos imposed martial law, which lasted until 1981. He then won another election, but no major opposition parties fielded a candidate. Marcos has held power for 20 years. 
Marcos' latest six-year term was due to expire in 1987, but he called the special election to show domes­tic and foreign critics, particularly in the United States, that he still enjoyed overwhelming support in the Philippines. 
Certification of the election result is up to the National Assembly, which was scheduled to begin its own separate survey today. 
Citing the difference between the two counts, Political Affairs Minister Leonardo Perez said he would seek the assembly's approval to terminate all other vote-counting im· mediately. 
A military·cJVilian council assumed interim control. 
Duvalier's departure sparked riots and revenge killing against the Ton­ton Macoutes, the Duvalier dynasty's dreaded private militia. 
Reporters said Macoutes were beaten and hacked to death with machetes Friday and Saturday: 
At least 100 bodies were seen stacked in a morgue at General Hospital, but how the victims died or when they were brought there could not be determined. 
France granted Duvalier and his party temporary refuge while it searched for a country willing to of­fer them permanent asylum. Several already have refused. The French are expected to approach some of the 25 French-speaking African nations, most ofwhich rely heavily on France for aid and commerce. 
The provisional military-civilian council on Saturday annl>unced Haiti's new Cabinet. The Cabinet is expected to issue its first com· munlque today, including a date to reopen schools closed Jan. 8 be­cause of national unrest in this im­poverished Caribbean island nation of6 million people. 


The national government radio yesterday announced that a member of the new Cabinet, Minister of Justice Gerard Gourgue, formerly president of the Haitian Human Rights Commission, had obtained the release of 26 political prisoners. Further details were not im· mediately available. 
Duvalier, long accused of human rights violations, steadfastly held that there were no political prisoners in his jails. 
U.S. embassy spokesman Jeffrey Ute said yesterday that Washington was considering releasing S52 mil­lion in foreign aid already approved for Haiti but held up because of the human rights situation under Duvalier. 
Correction 

Because of a reporting error, some analysis attributed to Stu· dent Body President Bill Healy In Friday's article about Student Senate restructuring was incor­rect. Healy was referring to last spring's CREST proposal when he said he believed the proposal was not studied enough. The Obser­ver regrets the error.

asked to help as the campaign gets into high gear," he said. 
The department of development, the fund-raising arm of the Univer­sity, already had begun work on the campaign before Hesburgh's speech, according to Sexton. 
Those able to either assist with the campaign or make "significant personal contributions" were flown to campus on five weekends last spring to meet with University of­ficers, he said. 
Five more such "fly-in weekends," each involving six couples, have been scheduled to begin this March, said Sexton. In addition, the Univer­sity will invite 100 more potential donors to the campus this fall, he said. 
Similar plans for the campaign have been made for next year, he said. 
The idea for the campaign grew out of the PACE report, a study which spelled out the University's priorities, according to Provost Timothy O'Meara, who was in charge of the report released in 1982. 
In order to fund those priorities, O'Meara said, a a campaign bigger than all previous fund-raisers was necessary. 
Although the concept of "Notre Dame: A Strategic Moment" is similiar to past campaigns, its goal is much more ambitious because "we're a larger University and our needs needs have increased," he said. 
"We see there's much more to be done," O'Meara said. "We believe that our benefactors also see that and they're willing to give." 
According to Sexton, the major thrust ofthe campaign is to build-up the University's endowment, which now stands at approximately $310 million. 
Hesburgh, who declined to com­ment about the campaign but in· stead referred all questions to Sexton, said during his October address that the University hopes the campaign will bring the endow­ment "up to over a halfa billion dol­lars." 
This, he said, "plus faith, is the guarantee ofcontinued progress and avoiding the growing dilemma of either hopelessly high fees or cur­tailing our steady upward move­ment." 

AIDS victims in prison battle crowds, threats 
Associated Press 
VACAVILLE, Calif. · There is little comfort for the inmates of the spe­cial section of this prison, the place Californian sends inmates who are dying ofAIDS. 
Some lie draped across the beds of their hospital cells, staring through the bars with gaunt faces. Down the hall, in a dormitory the size ofa large living room, the stronger ones talk and kill time. They sound like most prison 
r inmates. Steven Mednick, a 29-year­
t old convicted burglar, echoes ot­
r 
hers as he complains to a visitor: "it's severely overcrowded ... the food's cold ... the restroom's dirty." Officials say they do what they can
~ to maintain good conditions. 
r 
But the conversation soon comes r around to AIDS as Mednick says
r 
bluntly, "I don't want to die in
r
, prison." Many inmates in the general
r 
prison population fear the AIDS vic­
r 
tims and refuse to be housed near them. 
r 
In fact, Lt. Joe McGrath, the prison's spokesman, said hospital and dorm areas were set aside for victims after members ofthe general population issued a threat: "if you don't take care of them, we'll take care ofthem." 
The AIDS victims in the hospital and dorm balk little at the segrega­tion. "Being quarantined is saving my life," says one. 
Khoury said the inmates at Vacaville picked up the virus from homosexual sex, from injecting drugs with a hypodermic needle used by an AIDS carrier, or from both activities. Nearly half are homosexuals and about three­quarters are drug users, he said. 
"I'm both a homosexual and a 
drug user," said Keva Smith, 30, a San 
Franciscan who violated his parole 
on a grand theft conviction. 

Twenty percent ofthose with pre­AIDS develop AIDS within two years; researchers aren't sure what will happen to the rest.

According to Sexton, most of the funds collected will go to financial aid for students. Approximately 20 percent of the funds will be used for undergraduate financial aid, and ap­proximately 12 percent for graduate financial aid, he said. 
Endowed chairs, which establish professorships to attract top scholars to the University, will receive the next largest portion of the funds, he said. The next biggest share will be used for research sup­port and equipment, he said. 
Money from the campaign will also finance the renovation of the Administration Building and con­struction ofa new classroom, Sexton said. Funds will also go to the Center for Social Concerns, he said. 
According to Sandman, campaign money already has funded the addi­tion to the law school, and will even­tually fund the construction of women's dorms. Campaign con­tributions also will enable the Memorial Ubrary and Snite Museum to add to their collections, he said. 
In addition, campaign money will be given to various institutes at the University, such as the Institute for Pastoral and Social Ministry. 
In order to fund these projects and institutions, administrators are soliciting funds from all Notre Dame constituencies, said Conklin. These include alumni, parents, board of trustees' members, corporations and foundations, such as the Ford Foundation, he said. 


Most ofthe contributions given so far have been toward scholarships and endowments, Conklin said. 
Included among these is one of the largest personal gifts evr received by the University -$6 mil­lion from Joan Kroc, widow of the founder of McDonald's, to establish an Institute for Peace Studies. 
After the amount of these con­tributions are made public during the official anouncement, the cam­paign's national phase will begin, Sexton said. 
The national phase will encom­passe 190 cities by 1989, with spe· cia! events such as dinners being held for potential contributors in those areas, he said. 
Those contacted during this period will primarily be alumni, ac­cording to Conklin. Parents not solicited earlier in the campaign will also be asked to contribute, he added. 
Although this campaign is the most ambitious, it is certainly not new to the University.

The first major fund-raising cam­paign was called "Challenge 1." Beginning in 1960, it lasted three years and raised a total of S24.6 mil­lion in gifts and commitments. 
The next major campaign, "Challenge II," began as the first ended and also lasted three years. "Challenge II" raised a total of S22 million. 
Immediately after that came "SUMMA," which lasted six years and raised a total of S62.S million. 
Three years after "Summa" ended, "Campaign for Notre Dame" began in 1975. It lasted almost six years and raised a total of Sl80.5 million. 
A few months after that, "Athletic Endowment Fund" began. It lasted less than a year and raised a little more than Sl0 million, according to Carol Hennion, manager ofaccounts and records. 
The total amount raised during these five campaigns amounts to al­most S300 million. 
Although Hesburgh «ff'dn't specify which five campaigns he was refer­ring to during his October address, several administrators agreed these were the five he was speaking of when he said the present campaign's goal is to surpass the five previous campaigns combined.

pose an obstacle, according to 
Mastrangelo. "There are no 
problems in taking care ofa cat. 
You have a litter box and that is it," 
he explained. 
When long breaks in school 
come around, most students either 
have friends come in to feed their 
pets or they take their animals 
home with them. There is never any 
question in the Frey and Hamer 
household as to where Knute will 
be spending his vacations. Proud 
owner Frey said, "My mouse comes 
home with me." 
Once a student gets a pet he likes, 
there are almost no problems, but 
finding the right pet is sometimes 
more difficult than one would 
think. Mastrangelo and his 
roommates had always wanted to 
get a dog when they moved off­
campus, so they did. But they could 
not keep him. 
"We had a serious flea problem for the first three months oflast semester," Mastrangelo explained. "You could not sit on the couch. I had fleas in my bed and everywhere." 
Good pets not only provide a hassle-free friendship to their owners, they are also "kind ofa conversation piece," as Hamer put it. When he and his roommates have parties, the mouse Is put away ("reserved for special occasions"), and everyone takes time to tap on the fish aquarium. 
Senior uto Latoni, who refers to his pet as Thomas the Mouse, said there was another advantage in having a pet. "I think it is a good way to keep people out ofthe house when you are gone all day or at the library at night. H you do have a pet in the house, people think twice about going in," he explained. 
Mastrangelo echged Latoni's sentiments. "Most people who live in houses, especially if they are around bars, do get pets" for safety reasons, he explained. 
"Everyone that can have a pet, should," Hamer said. "And those that can't should make friends with someone who has one." 
"Share the fun of a pet!" he cheered. 
Winter just isn't the same without snow shoveling 
Dave Dvorak 
Out of the lunchbox. 

W 
e always hear ofAmerican workers losing their jobs and being replaced by machines. It's pretty unfortunate, but the reasons are simple. Machines are more efficient than humans. Machines don't take 
coffee breaks or demand weekly paychecks. Machines don't go on 
strike. 
Yet, as logical as this seems, we know deep down that there is 
something unnatural about mechanical monsters cranking out 
products that human hands were meant to fashion. 
Face it, the machine-knit sweater you bought at The Gap doesn't 
mean nearly as much to you as the one Grandma knit you for 
Christmas. 
The perversity ofall this becomes especially unsettling when we 
consider that even the great American Institution ofsnow 
shoveling is in serious danger ofextinction. The culprit? The 
gas-powered snowblower, ofcourse. 
Anyone who spent his childhood In a cold winter climate knows 
that shoveling sidewalks on cold winter afternoons was an 
important part ofgrowing up. It built character. It built discipline. 
It built shoulder muscles. 
It was also an importan~ source ofemployment. On snowy 
afternoons, my friends and I used to run home from school, grab 
shovels and hit the streets. Together, we'd walk from house to 
house, ringing doorbells and offering to sell our services. 
Rarely could a housewife or a little old lady say no to a few 
bright-eyed kids with red cheeks and runny noses. They would 
usually smile and say something like, "You know, I was just 
thinking about how badly my walk needed to be shoveled." My 
neighbors were wonderful liars. 
Once we got the job, my friends and I persisted until it was finished. We'd barely be able to lift the shovels as we heaved the snow aside. But we always did a thorough job, making sure the sidewalk was clean right down to the cement. 
We usually earned a buck or two apiece for each sidewalk we shoveled. It was tax-free income that could later be invested in candy, Christmas presents or a new baseball glove. 
But I feel sorry for kids growing up in my neighborhood today. None of the neighbors on the block need their sidewalks shoveled anymore. After all, Mr. Thurber, a guy down the street, bought a Toro snowblower last year. 
Mr. Thurber is a skinny, wimpy guy. His wife, who's twice as big as he, is always bossing him around. When his kids play cowboys and Indians, they like to tie him up and shoot rubber-tipped arrows at him. 
But after every snowfall, Mr. Thurber rolls that fearsome red machine out of the garage. With one quick pull of the cord, the thing roars to life:, shattering the sacred silence ofthe winter landscape. 
Mr. Thurber hlmseff undergoes a frightening change of character. A maniacal gleam appears in his eyes and a sinister smile spreads across his face. His wimpiness suddenly gives way to confident machismo. Newly-realized power rests in the grips ofhis hands. 
With a simple squeeze ofthe power-drive lever, Thurber and his snowblower take off down the block. The red monster lunges ahead, gobbling up snow and anything else in its path, throwing everything furiously through the air. 
The hearts ofall persons nearby are swept by terror as the 
half-crazed man and his machine approach. Mothers grab their 

.,
children and run indoors; other kids dive frantically into snow­

.,
banks tQ get out ofthe way. When Thurber is finally fiqlshed, he has cleared all the sidewalks on the entire block. It's not an act ofcharity, though; it's a power 
trip. 
He shuts off the snowblower, and by the time the deafening roar has ceased, Mr. Thurber has returned to his normal wimpy self. With a struggle, he wheels the machine into his garage. His wife opens the door and yells at him to set the table for dinner. Uke a beaten dog, he hangs his head and follows her into the house. 
Meanwhile, all the kids in my neighborhood are out of jobs. I often wonder what they do with themselves all afternoon. I'm worried that they might end up like the kids from somewhere like southern California, where snow shoveling never has and never will exist. 
Mention snow shovels to California kids and they'll think you're talking about a new wave band. Since they don't ever shovel snow, they waste their childhoods flinging Frisbees, riding skateboards and playing Hackey Sack. As they grow up, their priorities come to include activities like surfing and getting their hair permed. 
That's no way for a kid in my neighborhood to grow up. Give him a snow shovel and put him to work.

Many off-campus students have 
discovered some of the joys and 
pitfalls involved in owning a pet. 
Junior Mike Frey says his mouse 
Knute is "a good friend. I can talk to 
him and he can't talk back." Frey 
and his roommates also have three 
fish: Darby O'Gill, Snooter and 
Goldie. 

The advantages ofhaving pets far outweigh the disadvantages, ac­cording to most pet owners. 
"They aren't that hard to take care of," senior Kevin Hamer said of Knute and the fish. "It is a pain to clean the tank, but I imagine a dog would be harder to take care of." 
"I am glad we have a pet," said junior Ralph Mastrangelo, who has a cat, Gumby, and a kitten, Pokey. "You are never alone with a pet around. Heck, she even moon­walks!" Mastrangelo's roommate, junior Otis Boersma, said the cats were the best pets he has ever had.

In defending either position, proponents suggest that the opposing position con­tributes to an unhealthy environment. One might look at these issues from a philosophi­cal, political or even theological perspective. I would like to address these issues from the perspective ofa psychologist. 
What is a psychologically healthy environ­ment? Examinjng society or families on the restrictive/permissive continuum would lead one to conclude that only at the extremes are environments unhealthy. Both totalitarian regimes and laissez-faire governments produce undesirable effects. Parents who in­sist on absolute control or, on the other hand, abandon their authority are likely to encounter serious problems in the family sys-
tern. 
Most societies, like most families, function toward the middle on this continuum. Thus, a healthy conmmunity could be defined as one . that does not produce a large number ofpsyc­hological problems. A healthy individual is one who is able to cope effectively with the unique stresses ofhis or her environment. 
There have been a variety of policies and procedures related to "visitation" on the campuses where I've worked. The policies themselves do not seem to produce an un­healthy environment, since most are neither totally restrictive nor totally permissive. It is clear, however, that patterns of problems are associated with residential policies on campus. 
In a residence hall which houses men and women, the students tend to develop their own "codes." There is typically a taboo against dating someone who lives in the hall. I am aware ofa studentwho moved out in order to be able to date someone from her previous hall. While not forbidden, it is customary not to bring dates into the coed hall. Areas usually are informally defined as "male" or "female," with opposite sex residents expected to respect the different territories. 
Relationships between the sexes in the halls tend to be more "brother-sister." It took me some time, coming from a Catholic back­ground, to realize that sleeping in the same room, or even· the same bed, did not imply sexual contact. Students on many campuses pushed for such living arrangements and once granted, many expected coed living to become the modal style. In fact, after early strong interest, most campuses have found either a stable or decreasing level of interest in coed dorms. 
Students in coed dorms have problems maintaining boundaries. They also report needing more time with same-sex students in order to explore their thoughts and feelings in a less stressful setting. Many report missing the privacy associated with single-sex <;torms. 
On the other hand, when male/female con­tacts are restricted, and sexes live totally separately, other problems surface. Casual male/female relationships are often difficult to establish. The talk on either side tends to be generalized. 
At Notre Dame we hear comments about "Girls here are ... "or, "All the guys here care about is ...." Much ofthe aggressive humor is typically directed at members of the opposite sex. Most important, there is less evidence of an androgynous environment. Roles are more sharply defined, stereotypes more deeply entrenched. 
Notre Dame would be described as restrictive in residential policy and, until recently, permissive in alcohol use policy when compared to the majority of college campuses. Consequently, we experienced a developing loss of boundaries in alcohol use while at the same time we wrestle with male­female issues which long ago disappeared from many campuses. 
Should more changes be made in either area, a new set of community and individual problems would surface. Ifchanges are to be made, it would be my view to look to philosophical, political or theological bases for such changes. From a psychological perspective, it would seem that we would be trading one set of problems, which are as­sociated with a most complicated develop­mental stage, for another set ofproblems. 
I would like to thank the editorial staff for 
the invitation to comment on this discussion.

We must be aware of our top officials' proposals 
If Attorney General Edwin Meese has his way, the philosophy on which our entire criminal justice system is based could be thrown right out the proverbial window. In an interview published in U.S. News and World Report, Meese was asked about his criticism of the Miranda ruling, which gives suspects the right to counsel by an attorney before police 
questioning.  Meese  was  asked,  "Shouldn't  
people  who  may  be  innocent  have  such  
protection?"  

William Wilson or to tear the pages 
Meese replied, "Suspects who are innocent of a crime should. But the thing is, you don't have many suspects who are innocent of a crime. That's contradictory. If a person is in­nocent ofa crime, then he is not suspect." Oh, if it were only true. How many innocent people have gone on trial for a crime they did not commit? Yes, they were most likely, and hopefully, acquitted, but they had to be suspect to be charged. 
Desire for law and order is something which most of us possess. Yet it becomes frightening when our nation's highest law en­forcement officer suddenly wants to change our principle of "innocent until proven guilty" to "guilty until proven innocent." 
Of course, it is easy for us to go along with Meese's thinking. One could assume that most of us are not guilty of anything worse than a traffic violation. Most people do not commit serious crimes, so they do not concern them­selves with the rights of those who might be so accused. But put yourself in the shoes of someone who is accused of committing a crime. You may be innocent-only you your­self truly know -but if you are, what do you think might happen to you ifyou were ques­tioned by police without the counsel ofan at­torney? 
Our criminal justice system is a complicated place. An innocent person trying to muddle through it without the assistance of a trained specialist would be like a philosop­her trying to decipher a complex electrical schematic drawing. 
One ofthe basic tenets ofour justice system is that the worst thing which could happen would be an innocent man going to jail. It is better for a guilty man to go free than for an innocent man to be imprisoned. And without the assistance oflegal counsel, many innocent people might go to jail. 
Fortunately, it is most likely that Meese never will get his wish regarding the Miranda ruling. But I bring this up to you for this reason: we need to be constantly aware of what our leaders and policy makers are think­ing. We need to question their actions so we are assured they are doing the right thing. You don't have to immediately write the attorney general and tell him your opinion, but just be William Wilson is a sophomore govern­aware of what's going on.

Accusation against CBS was not completely true 
DearEditor: 
I was appalled Thursday to find another ar­ticle by Rich Coglianese in The Observer. After being so ridiculed for his idiotic article on the restoration of the Latin Mass, I felt that Coglianese would learn to enter the realm of reality. Unfortunately, I was wrong. His latest pathetic effort, concerning CBS, was equally inept. 
I believe that his accusations of CBS being sympathetic toward Cuba are not entirely cor­rect. I would like to know why he bases the aim of a network on the actions of a lone employee, Robert Taber. 
His conclusion that the CBS network "would not stoop to insult Castro" does not take into account all the other important fac­tors concerning the poll ofGrenada residents and their subsequent airing, or lack thereof I must agree with Coglianese that the coverage ofthe children at McAuliffe's school was taste­­less, but so were the repeated broadcasts of the shuttle explosion and the reaction of the McAuliffe family at Cape Canaveral by the ot· her networks. I fail to see how being an altar boy is the first step to the priesthood. Silly, clueless me. 
I also find it hard to believe that Ted Turner wanted to buy CBS to transform the network. Perhaps money and prestige were more likely motivators. I would just love to see Jesse Helms buy CBS. Why, we would be able to hear the Moral Majority on network TV. Such joy!

The Aquino candidacy allowed free expression 
Dear Editor: 
Jim Lahren's articles on the Philippine elec­tions establish either one of two things: his ig­norance or his naivete. How simple it is to disregard Corazon Aquino as a "viable elec­tion choice" and to advocate a military coup and say It IIi in "the best interest of the people." 
I doubt very much that l.ahren knows how unpopular the military is, and should they do something as foolish as to attempt a coup the results would be tragic. Violence would surely erupt, especially between the army and the NPA, the Communist-led New People's Army. Moreover, President Marcos holds the reins of the military through his good friend General Fabian Ver, chiefofstaffofthe Armed Forces. It would be quite impossible to plan a coup in a country with 7,000 islands without news ofIt leaking to the president and his put­ting an end to it. 
l.ahren goes on further to say Aquino is not a viable election choice. He seems to think 
A final point I wish to make (again contrary to Lahren's opinion) is that the United States made the right decision in calling for early elections. Marcos' popularity was decreasing and it is only fair to see whether the Filipinos still wanted him as their leader or not. Moreover, it gave the United States a chance to reevaluate its policies towards the Philippines, the big question being whether or not they would support an unpopular goverment. Although the electoral process in the Philippines is obviously more tainted than what Americans are used to, it gave the Filipinos a chance to express themselves. Per­haps this freedom of expression is what the country needed all along.

Later that night Shaw returned to the scene of Hartness' murder and mutilated her body. 
Shaw, Roach and Mahaffey were arrested on Nov. 3, 1977. Each was indicted for two counts of murder, two counts of conspiracy, rape, kidnapping and armed robbery. The state elected to seek the death penalty for Shaw and Roach and served the Notices re­quired by Seeton 16-3-20(B), Cum. Supp. 1978, on Dec. 14, 15 and 16, 1977. At this hearing, evidence in extenuation, mitigation and aggravation was introduced. The trial judge found aggravating circumstances and imposed sentences of death upon both Shaw and Roach. 
On Jan. 10, 1986, James Terry Roach, an adult, 25, received the penalty for an adult crime.

Blue Devils knock off Ga. Tech, set to host Notre Dame on Sunday 
DURHAM, N.C -Mark Alarie scored 24 points and Johnny Daw­kins added 22 as fourth-ranked Duke broke open a tight game early in the second half and beat second-ranked Georgia Tech 75-59 in an Atlantic Coast Conference game yesterday. 
The victory improved the Blue Devil's record to 22-2 overall and 9­2 in the ACC, a game behind top­ranked North Carolina. Georgia Tech has lost two of its last three, . both ACC games, and dropped to 18­4 and6-3. 
The Blue Devils travel to Stetson tomorrow before returning home to host the Fighting Irish of Notre Dame Sunday in a nationally­televised contest. 
The combination of a ball­hawking defense and Georgia Tech's cold shooting helped the Blue Devils race offon a 16-6 spree at the start ofthe second half. Alarie scored four straight baskets in the spurt, and it was his layup which capped the streak and gave Duke a 50-39 edge with I 5 :4I left to play. 
The Yellow Jackets got within 52­46 at the 9:55 mark on a Duane Fer­rell drive. But six straight Duke points pushed their edge to 62-49 with 5:49 left, and the lead grew as 
large as 68-53 on a Dawkins dunk with 3:25 remaining. The final score was Duke's biggest advantage. 
John Salley led Georgia Tech with I 7 points, while Mark Price scored I2, Bruce Dalrymple had 11 and Tom Hammonds 10. 
Georgia Tech committed 2I tur­novers, 12 in the second half, and cooled off to 46 percent from the field after shooting 56 percent in the first half. 
Duke shot 45 percent in the opening period, but warmed up to 60 percent in the second half and finished at 52 percent.

Ten personal records were set by members of the Notre Dame track team in Friday's Indiana Intercol­legiate Track Meet held in West Laf.lyette, Ind. 
Head Coach Joe Plane watched as Notre Dame took third place out of an eleven team field. Only Indiana and Purdue outscored the Irish. 
"Overall, we were very pleased with the meet," said senior co­captain John McNelis. "A lot ofguys ran their best times of the year, and this was a great tune-up for the 
Central  Conference  meet  next  
week."  
The  Central  Collegiate  Con­ 
ference  meet  spans  five states'  

schools and normally provides the 
Irish with one of their biggest chal­

lenges ofthe year. 
Stand outs for the Irish on Friday 

were senior Jim Tyler and junior 
Rob Nobles. Tyler came back to 

West Lafayette to defend his first 
place showing in the 1500 meters of 
a year ago, and once again he was the 
first to break the tape. Nobles, who 
took second place at the outdoor In­
diana Intercollegiates last year, won 
the 500 meters on Friday. 
Middle-distance runner McNelis was nipped at the tape in the 800 meters, chopping a second offoflast year's time as he finished In 1 :52:15. Junior Mike Collins finished second in the 3000 meters, andJeffVan Wie finished third in the 1000 meters. 
Junior co-captain Joel Autry, who competed in the triple jump and the long jump in Friday's meet, is happy with the progress the team has made and feels that it's peaking at just the right time. 
"In about a month, we've got IC4A's," said the Fort Wayne, Ind. native, "and right now we're in a really good position to send a lot of guys. The IC4A's are big. It takes some quality Individuals to make them, and I'd say we'll be represented well there." 
The IC4A Championships are held in Princeton, N.J., on March 8 and 9, the week before the NCAA Indoor Championships. 
The Irish next run In the Central Collegiate Conference meet on February 14-1 5, in Madison, Wis., and then It's on to Bloomington for the Indiana TAC on Feb. 21.

Tway wins playoff, Williams title 
Associated Press 
SAN DIEGO -Bob Tway escaped with a playoff victory yesterday -his first on the PGA tour -when Bernhard Langer missed a four-foot par putt on the second extra hole of the Shearson Lehman Brothers Andy Williams Open GolfTournament. 
Tway, 26 and in his second season on the tour holed his two-to-three foot putt for par after Langer, a West German who holds the Masters title, three-putted for bogey on the par-3 hole. 
Each completed 54-holes in this rain-shortened event at 204, 12 shots under par. Langer, winner of 1 7 international events, had a closing 68 and Tway had a hard­fought 69. 
Both made routine pars on the first playoff hole. On the next, Langer put his tee shot some 30 feet from the flag and 
Tway was about 20 feet from the cup. 
Langer ran his first putt some four­to-five feet beyond the cup, and Tway, with a chance to win, also missed. He went two-to-three feet past the cup. 
Langer, using a cross-handed grip and putting through the shadow ofa television tower, pushed his second putt to the right and, tight-lipped, tapped in for bogey. 
Tway holed his short one for the title and the winner's share of 181,000 from the total purse of 1450,000. 
Langer, who made up two shots over the last three holes, won 148,600. 
Langer, playing about 45 minutes in front ofTway, dropped an 18-foot birdie putt on the 16th hole of regulation to close within one stroke ofthe lead. 
Tway, in the lead alone, dropped 
back into a tie when he drove Into 
the rough, hit his second through 
the green and bogeyed the 17th. 
He holed a gritty, 6-to-8 foot second putt for par on the 18th that preserved a share of the lead and forced the playoff. 
Paul Azlnger, who once held the 
lead alone, Mark Lye and Mike Hul­
bert finished one shot out of the; 
playoff at 205. Hulbert had a closing 
67, Lye 69. 
Azinger, a second-year player, sur­rendered a chance for his first vic­tory when he snatched his tee shot into an unplayable lie on the 16th and made double bogey. He also had a last-round 69 in the chilly, sunny weather. 
Gary Koch, Larry Rinker and Gary Hallberg were another shot back at 
206. Hallberg and Koch closed up with 67s, and Rinker had a 68 on Torrey Pines' South course.

that Kempton and Rivers missed them today when we won, Instead of in a loss. Both of those guys have won a lot ofgames for us in the past." 
On this snowy Saturday in central New York, however, there were plenty of heroes to take credit, and Phelps was generous in handing out the praise. 
"Everybody played well for us today," commented the Irish coach, who must prepare his team for tomorrow night's battle with Fordham at the ACC. "We never lost our composure, we did a good job on the boards and we made the key foul shots." 
And in the end, the foul shots won out over the foul language.

Notre Dame's wrestling team lost matches to Clemson and Purdue, but Irish head coach Fran McCann said that It was by no means a lost weekend. 
Even though his team's record fell to 'i-6, McCann said the Irish show signs ofstepping up to a higher level of quality that will enable them to compete with solid squads on a regular basis. 
"I really felt good about what our guys did outlhere," McCann said. "I saw some very positive things that show me we've come a long way. We've made a lot ofpro~ess." 
llnfortunately, the progress did not show up on the scoreboard against an experienced Purdue team, as the Irish were beaten soundly, 38-9. 
The only Irish victories came on decisions from freshmen Jerry Durso and Chris Geneser, and junior Dave Helmer. 
McCann said he knew Purdue was a talented squad, and they proved to be every bit as tough as he expected. 
"We expected Purdue to be a very good team and they were," he said. "They're a veteran team with five senior starters, and they really come at you." 
"I think they are probably the third best team in the Big Ten, but despite that there were some tough matches that could have gone either way. If we could have come out on top of those, it could have been a lot closer." 
Clemson came into the match ranked 20th in the nation and with three nationally-ranked wrestlers on its squad. The Irish wrestled very well against the Tigers before falling, 26-18. 
Notre Dame pulled out to an early lead when 118-pound Carl Hildinger won by forfeit and 126­pound Dave Carlin won by a 10-4 decision. 
Durso then defeated Clemson's Bobby Taylor by technical fall to raise his record to 33-6. The 33 vic­tories by the 134-pound freshman tied a Notre Dame record for wins in a season by a freshman previously set by Phil Baty in the 1981-82 season. . The Irish could get only one more victory, however. Dave Helmer scored a 7-3 decision at 190pounds. 
McCann said the Irish were very close to upsetting the Tigers. 
"We gave them a very good match," he said. "One match that was critical was at 167 pounds, where Geneser went against their guy who Is ranked No. 5 ( 26-3-1 Mike Pitts). Chris wreslted him tough and lost 7-6. 
"Ifwe win that one, the match can go either way." 
The three matches against Mic­higan State, Clemson, and Purdue in three days made up quite a demand­ing stretch for the Irish, but McCann said that type ofstretch is helpful in building a solid program. 
"We got banged up a little," he said. "It was quite a tough weekend, including Thursday at Michigan State, but we have to go through something like this to help our young team improve." 
The Irish will have some time to recover from the tough going they have endured in losing their last four matches. Next Saturday, they will travel to Bloomington to face In­diana. 

the second half, and Rivers was forced to the bench on his fourth foul with 12:43 remaining. The benching was short lived, though, as Sherman Douglas' rebound goal brought Syracuse within one at 57­'i6. Phelps took a calculated risk, and Rivers reentered the lineup. 
Undaunted, the Orangemen con­tinued the comeback, taking a two­point lead at 67-65 when Washington banked home a leaning 12-footer with 6:13 left. Phelps called a timeout to settle his club down, and it worked. 
First, Tim Kempton scored a three-point play to give Notre Dame a lead it would never relinquish. Then the Irish proceeded to pad the lead with clutch foul shooting, hit­ting 13 of 1 7 down the stretch. 
Perhaps just as important was the fact Notre Dame snared the rebound on all four ofits misses, allowing the Irish to take more time offthe clock. 
Overall, Notre Dame collected 14 offensive rebounds on its way to out­rebounding Syracuse. The Oran­gemen had entered the game second in the NCAA in rebounding margin. 
"We work a lot on getting missed foul shots," noted Phelps. "I'm glad

Women's swimming sweeps dual meet with Valpo, UIC 
ByKATHLEEN McKERNAN 
Sports Writer 
"We swam very, very fast," Notre Dame swim coach Tim Welsh said of the women's swim team after its per­formance Friday night in the Rolfs Aquatic Center. In the double-dual meet, Notre Dame soundly defeated Valparaiso, 67-46, and Illinois­Chicago, 71-42. 
With the wins, the Irish raised their record to 7-2, but more impor­tantly they came together more completely as a team and gained im­ponant experience in champion­ship events. 
"A couple of very important things happened in these meets," coach Welsh said. "First, we made substantial time drops. Second, we swam two new events." 
Those events were the 1650-yard freestyle and the 400-yar<l in­dividual medley. Usually in dual meet competition, teams compete in 1000-yard races instead of the 1650. In the upcoming champion­ships, however, the Irish will com­pete at the 1650 distance. Friday's meet gave them an opportunity to prepare for the championships in that event. 

"What was exciting about that event was that not only did we swim it fast, we swam it well," an ob­viously pleased Welsh said. "We balanced the smaller parts of the long race very well." 
Notre Dame's two 1650 swim­mers, Anne Costello and Sarah Vak­kur took first and second places respectively, with less than six seconds difference between the times in the long event. And while only Costello and Vakkur placed highly in the event, the fact that the team was able to compete success­fully in the new event gave everyone a big boost ofconfidence, according to Welsh. 
Sophomore Amy Darlington of Fairfield, Ohio, also contributed strong swims to Notre Dame's cause on Friday. Darlington swam the 400­individual medley in 4:48.64, a new Irish record. 
"Amy's success and the 1650 race were the most significant swims as far as indicating coming champion­ship performances," Welsh said. 
Jean Browne, a freshman from Al­lentown, Pa., turned in strongswims in the 100-yard freestyle race and the 200-yard freestyle relay. In the 100 freestyle, her :57.93, which she swam in exhibition, would have won first place ho~10rs. She also par­ticipated in the relay with the fastest

Sports Writer 
A determined Notre Dame men's swim team met the men from Ferris State Saturday and came away with a big 78-35 victory at the Rolfs Aquatic Center. The win, which came in Notre Dame's last home meet of the year, lifted the team's record to 4-5 and served as a sign to Head coach Tim Welsh that his team is coming together at the right time with the Midwest Collegiate Con­ference championships just a few weeks away. 
"The exciting thing is that we won one and won one big," said Welsh. "This was the kind of meet that the team really needed. It was good for moral, good for confidence and good for the upcoming champion­ships." 
Notre Dame started the meet well and never looked back, taking the first event, the 400-yard medley relay in 3:39.53, in a time that was almost three seconds faster than any previous time this season. 
"That has been a meet goal for us for some time," said weish. "This is the first time we have led a meet from the beginning. It was an awfully big lift to start off the meet 7-0." 
Things only got better from there for the lrisp, as the men took first place in nine ofthe eleven events on the day from Ferris State and led the meet from start to finish. Welsh at­tributed his teams success to key swims combined with other cir­cumstances. 
"We were a little faster today than we have been, and they were a little slower," noted Welsh. "Butwe knew we had to swim well to win. Everyth­

variables turning out in our favor. Those things combined made for the lopsided score." 
Exceptional performances for the Irish were turned in by double· winners John Koselka and John Cof­fey. Koselka, a freshman, took first place in both the 50-yard free style and the 1 00-yard free-style with 
times  of  21:97  and  49:65  
respectively  to  boost  the  Notre  
Dame effort.  

Coffey,a senior co-captain, came through with a win in the 200-yard free style with a time of 1:49.80 and the 200-yard backstroke in 2:06.06 to lead the Irish. 
With thf" meet well in hand at the end, Notre Dame was able to have a little fun, putting together an all­senior team for the last event -the 400-yard free relay. Although the team was edged out by Ferris State at the end, Coach Welsh felt it was a good way to end the meet and the home season.. 

"This was a nice way for the seniors to end up their careers here," Welsh said. "Now we are looking ahead to our meets next week against Illinois-Chicago and Northern Illinois. With the win today, our two primary goals for the season, a winning record and a win at the conference meet in Evansville, are well within reach."

"One good thing about this meet was seeing Jean Browne come around," said Welsh. "That was just terrific." 
Junior Suzanne Devine, the Notre Dame record holder in many of the butterfly and freestyle events, also had an excellent meet. She finished first in the 1 00-yard butterfly and dropped under two minutes in the 200 freestyle. 
Coach Welsh was especially pleased, however, with the way the team has pulled together as a unit recently. 
"The team has really staned to jell over the past few weeks," Welsh said. "A couple of things have been important to our recent successes. First, we've had considerably im­proved performances, which builds .~u,unn:u,Lr.. Second, we've had some easy wins, which makes things easier during our most competitive meets." 
The women swimmers had faced Valparaiso and Illinois-Chicago in the season at the Notre Dame Relays, yet they still really did not know what to expect. Valparaiso came into the meet with an undefeated dual-meet record of 8-0 after finish­ing with a 5-8 mark last year. They also had beaten five teams that they lost to last year. 
"It was important that our swim­mers were relaxed and comfortable for this meet." Welsh said. 
The relaxed Notre Dame women dominated Valparaiso and Illinois­Chicago. Near the end, when an Irish victory was assured, Notre Dame relaxed even more and let the other two swim more or less against each other.

Notre Dame topples No.8 Syracuse, 85-81 
Irish women whip Xavier, will face UIC tonight 
Irish silence crowd, sink 41-of-48 from line

SYRACUSE, N.Y.-The Syracuse University student body has a questionable "tradition" of yelling an obscenity after an op­ponent makes a free throw. 
It had a chance to practice that obscenity and a lot of others Saturday, as No. 14 Notre Dame upset seventh-ranked Syracuse, 85-81, before a crowd of 32,397, third-largest in Carrier Dome history. 
The Irish, now 16-4, won this game where they have won so many others this season -at the free throw line. Notre Dame converted a school-record 41 of 48 attempts from the foul line to snap the Orangemen's 15-game home winning streak. 
"That's part ofour offense", noted Notre Dame coach Digger Phelps, who watched his team play some ofits best basketball of the year. "We want to get to the line. We work a lot on getting the ball inside during practice so we can draw the foul." 
That's precisely what the Irish did all day, as they took advantage of injuries to Syracuse's Rafael Addison and Rony Seikaly. With those two frontcourt players out of the lineup, Notre Dame's big men had a field day inside. 
"We wanted to take it to them," noted Phelps. "We played really aggressive, and we felt we could exploit that weakness. 
"We knew Seikaly liked to block shots but we felt ifwe took it right at him, we could get him in foul trouble. That was our game plan, to get them in foul trouble." 
It worked, too, as four Orangemen fouled out ofthe contest, which dropped Syracuse to 18-3. Still, Syracuse coach Jim Boeheim didn't think it was all because ofNotre Dame's play. 
At first, Boeheim declined to comment on the officiating, which resulted in a technical foul for the Syracuse coach with 24 seconds left. Calls enraged both coaches throughout the course of the ballgame, and Boeheim went on to make some statements which were less than complimentary ofthe Atlantic Coast Conference crew. 
"Somebody got us in foul trouble," hinted Boeheim. "It was physical at one end, and at the other end, everything we did was a foul. I don't mind a physical game, if it's the same on both ends." 
The contest wasn't all physical, though, as some outstanding guard play by Syracuse's Dwayne "Pearl" Washington kept the Orangemen in the game. 
Washington tied a season-high with 28 points, many of them coming on jump shots with a hand in his face. His scoring along with eight assists left both coaches looking for superlatives. 
"Dwayne played an exceptional game tonight," said Boeheim. "He kept us in the game almost singlehandedly." "Pearl's the next Oscar Robertson," exclaimed Phelps. "He's

You could say the Notre Dame women's basketball team blew out Xavier Saturday afternoon at the ACC, but you'd be wrong. 
That's because "blow out" would be much too mild a term to describe Notre Dame's 104-57 massacre of the Lady Musketeers. Call it a thrash­ing, a pounding, or maybe just an ut­ter subdual by a clearly overwhelming force. 
Whatever you call it, Irish head coach Mary DiStanislao called it an impressive win for her team, now 13-7 on the year and 6-1 in the North Star Conference. 
"I think it was just a case ofa team that was really ready to have a good game," said DiStanislao, who saw her team's 17-game NSC winning streak end last Wednesday against Dayton; "The Dayton loss last week was a very difficult loss for us. I think the team was ready to put it behind us." 
Notre Dame will have the oppor­tunity to add another victory to its record tonight when it faces the Uni­versity of Illinois (Chicago) in Chicago. The match tonight with the 9-12 Flames will be the last non­conference game of the season for the Irish before they begin their seven-game stretch towards a second consecutive NSC title. 
Notre Dame should be in good emotional straits for that stretch drive after its domination of Xavier on Saturday. Five Irish players scored In double figures as the host team rolled to its most lopsided vic­tory since a 107-61 win over the same Xavier team last year. 
Strangely enough this win on Saturday occurred despite the fact that Notre Dame was hurting for the battle, as key bench-players Heidi Bunek and Kathy Brommeland sat out the game because ofillness. This loss ofbench strength, coupled with a fiat opening by the Irish, seemed to bode well for Xavier's hopes at least to keep the game close. 
But even those minor hopes were shattered soon after when it became apparent that the Musketeer offense could not contend with the quicker, taller Irish defense. And while the Xavier backcourt was being stymied in its attempts to get the ball inside (the Musketeers committed 3"3 tur­novers on the day), Notre Dame was getting easy shots underneath on the other side. 
"l think it took us a few minutes to get started," said DiStanislao. "I think we were a little flat and we weren't getting good defensive play. But even though we were a bit shor­thanded without Bunek and Brom­meland, we still knew we'd be able to get the ball inside." 
Irish players Sandy Botham and Diondra Toney must have known this also, as the two showed no mercy in directing the onslaught

ND dominates inside, Price puts end to slump

SYRACUSE, N.Y.-Boom, boom, boom. 
That's what it sounded like inside the Carrier Dome all day Saturday, as No. 14 Notre Dame beat Syracuse like a bass drum on its way to an 85-81 upset ofthe seventh-ranked Orangemt:n. 
Boom. 
That's the sound of the Irish frontline pounding away on the inside. The fearsome foursome of Ken Barlow, Donald Royal, Tim Kempton and Jim Dolan not only made major contribu­tions on offense, but they took away the Orangemen's inside game on defense. A tenacious zone defense limited center Rony Seikaly to five points and shut out Syracuse's leading scorer, Rafael Addison, who was already bothered by a sore ankle. 
"We dominated the inside all day and dominated the outside when we had to," noted Irish coach Digger Phelps. "Ken Barlow came through for us today, Joseph Price came through for us, and we just got a good team effort." 
Price was particularly satisfied with his performance. Phelps made it no secret at last Thursday's press conferenc he was un­happy with Price's play, but the senior guard responded with 12 points and 28 solid minutes ofplay. 
"Considering the slump I've been in, I'm happy Coach still had the confidence in me and let me play," said Price. "When I hit my first shot, it took a little of the pressure off me. As everybody says, when I hit my first one, I'm on the road." 
Boom. 
That's the sound of noise reverberating through the massive Carrier Dome. A crowd of 32,397-some of them sitting at least 70 yards away from the playing floor with an obstructed view ­made noise all day long. All the yelling, however, failed to in· timidate the Irish. 
"We couldn't let the fans dictate to us at the free throw line," noted Royal, who connected on 14-of-1 7 from the foul stripe. "We knew we had to do well at the line." 
Notre Dame did just that, setting a school record and a Car­rier Dome record by connecting on 41 of 48 free throws. 
Boom. 
That's the sound of Notre Dame knocking on the door of the 
NCAA tournament. Saturday's win left little doubt in the minds of many that the Irish could be a force come March. 
"We deserve to be ranked," emphasized Phelps after the game. "I know a lot of people question that, but I think today gives us credibility. This is a win that could only help us in March." 
"The victory means a great deal to me," added point guard David Rivers. "It's great to beat a ranked team. We proved that if
