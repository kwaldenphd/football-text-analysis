Boggs is the 27th woman to receive the award, the first be­ing Eliza Starr, a critic of Christian art, in 1885. 
"Exemplary in marriage, motherhood, stewardship and statecraft alike, Lindy Boggs deserves the recognition of the Notre Dame family," said Uni­versity President Father Ed­ward Malloy, "and it seems particularly appropriate to cel­ebrate her example during Notre Dame's Year of Women."

Associate Provost particpates in South African talks

News Writer 
The African National Congress (ANC) took a dramatic new stance in recent meetings with tlw National Advisory Council to U.S. firms, urging increased 
U.S. economic involvement in South Africa.

for black housing and educa­tion in South Africa, according to Williams. "They want more U.S. money, technology, and jobs," he added. 
The Comprehensive Anti­Apartheid Act pa,;sed by the 
U.S. Congress currently pro­hibits U.S. involvement in South Africa. Specifically, the Act for­bids the creation of new U.S. businesses or the expansion of old businesses in South Africa. The three remaining pillars of apartheid will probably be "taken ofT the books this June," because President F.W. deKlerk asked the ANC to remove them, according to Williams. These include the Group Areas Act, the Land Act, and the Popula­tion Registration Act. The ANC also hopes to improve education levels in the black community, where 60 percent of blacks in South Africa are functionally illiterate, ar.r.ording to Williams. Five times as much money is spent on a white student as on a black student, he added. "They (ANC) want to talk about the new, democratic South Africa," said Williams. "They hope formal negotiations for a

Gorbachev, Yeltsin both claim victory in first Soviet referendum 
MOSCOW (APl -Soviet Pres­ident Mikhail Gorbachev and his maverick rival Boris Yeltsin on Monday both emerged from the first rcfenmdum in Soviet history able to claim victory. 
In the nonbinding election lwld Sunday in 11 time zones across the Soviet Union, Gor­bachev won overwhelming sup­port for preserving a renewed federation with the majority of tlw population. 
But partial returns showed Yeltsin winning on a question that has been opposed by Gor­bachr.v: Creating a strong pres­idr.ney for the Hussian federa­tion. and tilling it by direct elec­tion. 
Ynltsin was elected chairman by Russia's legislature in May. Known as the Russian presi­dent, he is in danger of losing that job -hard-line members of Hussia's Congress are plan­ning a no-confidence vote on March 28. Even if Yeltsin lost that vote, he would be strongly favored in a popular election. 
Gorbachev's referendum won by margins of 70 percent to 95 percent in seven of the 15 re­publics: the Ukraine, Byelorus­sia, and in the five republics of Central Asia: Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Tadzhikistan, l'urkmenia and Kirgizia. 
There were no final totals for Russia and Azerbaijan on Mon­day. Local counts were running strongly in favor of the union in publics refused to hold the ref­erendum and the majority of their voters appeared to stay away from polls held in Com­munist Party and military bases. Less than a 50 percent turnout renders an election in­valid under Soviet law. 

But officials claimed 500,000 voted in Latvia and 652,000 in Lithuania -with a 97 percent 'yes' vote in Lithuania. The turnouts were less than the re­quired 50 percent, but still higher than expected because both republics voted strongly for independence several weeks ago. 
In Lithuania, the count could be accurate only if there were at least 200,000 'no' votes, said parliamentary spokesman Har­ris Subacius. 
Both republics reported widespread ballot-stuffing on Sunday, because voters' names were not checked against regis­tration rolls. 
There is no tradition in the Soviet Union of politicians pub­licly announcing victory or con­ceding defeat. 
The results reported by elec­tion officials and news media reflected confusion. 
Gorbachev first proposed the referendum in December as a means of pressuring leaders of the 15 Soviet republics into signing a new Union Treaty to preserve central control over politics and the economy.

INSIDE COLUMN 
The Observer: It's up to you ND/SMC 
As I was relaxing during break this year and thinking about my column, a memory of a trip last March started me thinking about the role of The Observer at Notre Dame and Saint 

Mary's. In St. Martin, the Kelley Tuthill 
government runs an ad campaign that tries to Editor-in-Chief instill a sense of ________ 
responsibility and pride in its citizens. The ads read "St. Martin: Tis our own ting." How does this neat little slogan fit in with The Observer? Well maybe it doesn't. I hope as The Observer becomes a quarter of a century old, it will become for the students of Saint Mary's and Notre Dame "our own ting." Many schools do not have a student news­paper, or have one that publishes infre­quently with little to offer the student body. We do have a paper that is fortunate enough to have ample office space, a large and hard­working staff, loyal advertisers and thousands of devoted readers. Over the next year I hope this paper can become our own thing. Something that stu­dents read with interest and respond to with thoughtful columns and letters. Students who are concerned that the paper does not give ample space to a particular issue or event should let us know and discuss future coverage with our editors. An issue of concern for the 1991-92 Editorial Board is the coverage afforded to Saint Mary's in The Observer. We believe that the number of stories on Saint Mary's could be increased. To serve the community better we have created several additional paid positions on our Saint Mary's staff. In the next few weeks there will be several changes made at the Saint Mary's office. It is our hope that the Haggar College Center office will offer more services to our Saint Mary's readers and advertisers. An issue that students have been concerned about is ND/SMC relations. A recent article in the Saint Mary's Courier examines the issue of deteriorating relations between the two schools. We hope The Observer can serve as a forum for debate on this and other topics and we can also help further increased un­derstanding between the two student bodies through increased coverage of Saint Mary's. All of us here at The Observer promise to do our best to put out a paper that offers a wide variety of stories and columns. You can be sure that we are working hard to produce quality work each day. In return, we hope that our readers continue to actively respond to what they read. We would like those students who want to see more coverage of Saint Mary's to get involved. While we have hired new staff members, they cannot cover the college by themselves. We certainly need more photographers, writers and columnists. I have only one year to accomplish the goals that I have set for this paper. There's at least one goal that all our readers can help us with-help us to serve you. Remember, The Observer "tis our own ting."

Decency standard for arts challenged 
 
WASHINGTON-A statute requiring the National Endowment for the Arts to consider "general standards of decency" when awarding federal grants was challenged in a lawsuit filed Monday as an uncon­stitutional restriction on freedom of expression. The decency standard was approved by Congress last fall as a substitute for a previous law that banned NEA grants for works that might be deemed obscene, including depictions of homosexual or sado-masochistic activities, child pornography or individual sex acts. Congress later repealed that ban and voted instead to require the endowment to recoup federal funds from grant recipients whose works are ruled obscene by the courts.

Honor code teaches students professional ethics 
By DANNIKA SIMPSON News Writer 
Father Edward Malloy, Uni­versity president, hopes the connection between ethics and the honor code is one that will extend beyond the four years students spend at Notre Dame. 
Malloy said, "I think an honor code is desirable at Notre Dame bocause I think we're trying to prepare people for a world in which that kind of attitude (one of honor and honesty) would prnvail. The hardest thing in a profession is to hold each other accountable, that is to bring to publie attention instances of misbehavior." 
"The hardest thing about an honor code at Notre Dame is exactly the same thing. To learn to make that transition in self-concept here and now is to establish what I think are life­time habits of reliability." 
He told the story of a profes­sor at Harvard Medical Sehool who obtained his position by cheating. Malloy said the man had the "perfect pedigree" for the position that he held. 
He said the scientific commu­nity apparently had not set up a system of accountability and that they had "presupposed" much that was not happening. 
Malloy further said, "It also says a lot about the the quality of the environment that nur­tures that kind of an attitude. The kind of competitiveness

and the presumption that as long as people were seemingly displaying a sort of brilliance along the way that that was adequate to the challenge." 
He stated this incident is a "scary reminder" that what we begin in college may persist in the future. 
Malloy then talked about what constitutes a profession, how ethics are involved in pro­fessions, and the difficulties in creating an environment where professionals are held account­able for their actions. 
According to Malloy, a pro­fession is an area of work re­quiring specialized education which also has a certification process and a certain set of values, often taking the form of a code. There is a presupposi­tion that professionals will be held accountable to the values and there is a high degree of status since the workers are seen as specialists. 
The problems of enforcing ethics in professions come from a fear of scandal, Malloy said. People often fear the reputation of their profession will be scarred if they report any mis­conduct. 
He also said that human dy­namics may be involved. People are less inclined to intrude without all the evidence when they are close to a case than when they have no personal in­terest in the case. 
The lecture was part of the Professional Ethics Lecture Series which is sponsored by the Provost office, the Univer­sity Academic Code of Honor Committee and the Student Academic Council Committee. 
Senate voices concerns of undergrads 
By DAVID KINNEY Assistant News Editor 
Concerned with Notre Dame's escalating movement away from the educational interests of the undergraduate, Student Senate passed a resolution calling for the administration to address the issue. 
The resolution responds to growing student concern re­garding the issue, as evidenced through a recent student gov­w:nment referendum. 
The senate expressed its 'growing discontent with the >hortage of faculty, the large class sizes -specifically in the upper levels -and the amount of classes which become 'closed."' 
The resolution, submitted by Lisa Bostwick, district 2 sena­tor, emphasizes that the uni­versity should foster intellectual growth through the interaction of students and faculty. 
These problems result in im­personal relationships between students and professors, the possible delay of students ca­reers, and the inability of fac­ulty to share their knowledge with students. 
The senate "recommends that this issue become a campus­wide priority." Administration and student discussion should address and solve the causes of the problems, including the fi­nancial inability to hire more faculty. 
In other senate business: 
The senate approved an ad­dition to the bylaws of the stu­dent body constitution that creates a loan fund to be oper­ated by the Club Coordination Council. 
The document, submitted by Club Coordinator Jeff Stark, allows for $3000 of unspent money to be used for short­term, interest-free loans. Clubs can use the funds to start fund­raising programs with guaran­teed revenue. 
Clubs not repaying the loans within the stated period of time will be subject to Joss of loan privileges, late fees, or other restrictions. 
"This would allow us to make 
loans to  a  club," said Stark,  
"rather  than  to  give  them  
money."  

The senators selected the winners of the Irish Clover Award "for outstanding service to the students of the Notre Dame community." 
Gina Mahony, the student winner, improved campus secu­rity by organizing Safe Walk. She also chaired the committee that created the Board of Trustees report on cultural di­versity. 
Phil Johnson, assistant direc­tor of ND security and coordi­nator of the Christmas in April program, received the faculty award. Senators said that Johnson's response to the cam­pus parking problem was im­pressive. 
Johnson, said Student Body President Rob Pasin, "always has student interests in mind."

The Laetare (pronounced Lay-tab-ray) Medal is so named because its recipient is an­nounced each year on Laetare Sunday, the fourth Sunday in Lent on the Church calendar. "Laetare," the Latin word for "rejoice," is the first word in the entrance antiphon of the Mass that Sunday, which antic­ipates the celebration of Easter. 
Established at Notre Dame in 1883, the Laetare Medal was conceived as an American counterpart of the Golden Rose, a papal honor which antedates the 11th century. The medal has been awarded annually at Notre Dame to a The Ou~en Mother, in Berlin to celebrate St. Patrick's day with British Catholic "whose genius has forces, IS framed for a group photo by members of the 1st Battalion of ennobled the arts and sciences,

Among the 112 previous re­cipients of the Laetare Medal are Civil War General William Rosecrans, operatic tenor John McCormack, President John F. Kennedy, J\mbassador Clare Boothe Luce, Catholic Worker foundress Dorothy Day, and novelist Walker Percy.

They want to start creating jobs now," he said. 
Williams told the ANC that sanctions won't be taken off by the U.S. Congress "until you ask for it." "They responded, 'We under­stand that,"' said Williams. He predicted that the Government would probably ask for sanc­tions to be lifted sometime in June, when the last apartheid laws will be removed from the legislature. Williams said that most U.S. businesses "will probably be very cautious," until political stability is established. "I think there will be some that will probably respond positively,"

Kerrigan, feUow at Kellogg Institute, dies 
Anthony Kerrigan, senior guest scholar at the Helen Kel­logg Institute for International Studies, died March 7 in Bloomington, Ind. He was 72 years old. 
During his life, Kerrigan re­ceived international praise for his translations of more than 40 books by Spanish and Latin American writers. One of the first writers in English to notice and understand the work of Jorge Luis Borges, Kerrigan translated "Ficciones," "A Per­sonal Anthology," "Poems," and "Irish Strategies." 
He also translated and helped edit the seven-volume "Selected Works of Miguel de Unamuno." 
Kerrigan's translations also include Pablo Neruda's "Selected Poems," Camilo Jose Cela's "Family of Pascual Duarte," and Jose Ortega y Gasset's "The Revolt of the Masses," which was published by Notre Dame Press and in­troduced by Saul Bellow, a friend of Kerrigan. 
In addition to his translations, Kerrigan also wrote his own poetry, short stories and critical essays. These writings include three collections of poetry, "Lear in the Tropic of Paris," "Espousal in August," and "At the Front Door of the Atlantic." 
Kerrigan's autobiography was published last year, and he was at work on another book of poems at the time of his death. 
Kerrigan received many liter­ary honors, including a 1975 National Book Award, for "The Agony of Christianity," the fifth volume of his Unamuno trans­lation. 
In 1987, he was elected to the American Literary Translators' Association board of directors, and the following year he be­came the first translator to re­ceive a senior fellowship in lit­erature from the National En­dowment for the Arts.

Science has no simple solution to global warming 
By JOSEPH ADAMS 
News Writer 
There is no simple answer to the global warming debate, ac­cording to Stephen Schneider, a leading climatologist and envi­ronmental poliey analyst. 
Sehneider, head of the lnter­diseiplinary Climate Systems at the National Center for Atmo­spherie Research, spoke at Notrr. Dame on "The Global Warming Debate: Seienee or Polities." 
Schneider said that sinee there is no eonsensus among scientists, the general publie is oftnn eonfused and does not know whom to believe about global warming. 
Schneider stated that he be­lieves no one doubts the green­house effeet exists. "(The greenhouse effeet) is not a threat. It is wonderful. It makes life possible," he said. 
He said the debate is over whether gases produeed by human activity ereate enough heat to be "seriously disruptive to ecosystems." 
Schneider noted that scien­tists are unable to agree on this issue and that the normal give and take among researchers has confused the public. 
He said that because of the issue's tremendous importance, the media reports all develop­ments. However, because scien­tists "learn by disproving," many theories accepted by the public are later discarded. 
Schneider said people should realize that what appears to be fighting among scientists is ac­tually normal behavior. 
He pointed out that some 
facts are indisputable. He showed how global carbon dioxide levels have consistently increased over the past 150 years. 
Schneider blamed humans saying, "We are sure beyond a doubt it is due to us." 
He also said that this increase in carbon dioxide levels has re­sulted in an increase in energy per square meter of earth. Still, scientists are unsure if this en­ergy increase contributes to global warming. 
Schneider asked, "How do you translate (energy) into X degrees of heat?" 
He pointed out that average global temperature has in­creased half a degree in the past century. He said this fact is not alarming until one realizes that in the past millennium the average global temperature has only increased one degree. 
Schneider said, "The rate of change is very fast relative to nature." 
He said that this trend does not necessarily prove that hu­man activity has accelerated global warming. Calling fore­casts of ecology "arrogant nonsense," Schneider explained that there is no way to posi­tively know. 
However, he continued, "If we wait until we are sure, then it might be too late." Schneider said that he would "call it a coin flip" as to whether the greenhouse effect contributes to global warming. 
Schneider said that "slowing down" human activity which contributes to the greenhouse effect is the key to buying time to study the problem further. 
He applauded the banning of clorofluorocarbons and called for the more efficient use of en­ergy. He said that a 20-25 per­cent reduction in energy use could be achieved at no cost with measures such as an in­crease in fuel mileage in auto­mobiles. 
He also said that a "larger­scale look" is necessary to combat environmental prob­lems. He said that governments need to "negotiate at the plane­tary level" because the issues involved affect all humanity.

Teacher testifies she loved husband who was killed by her teenage student/lover 
EXETER, N.H. (AP)-A high school teacher testified at her murder-conspiracy trial Mon­day that she was trying to break off an affair with a stu­dent when the teenager shot her husband to death last year. 
Pamela Smart said she loved her husband, but was having difficulty breaking off her affair with the student, William Flynn. She said Flynn was so distraught at the prospect of not seeing her that he threat­ened to kill himself. 
"He started crying and he said he couldn't live without me. I felt bad. I did not want to hurt his feelings," she said. 
Smart, 23, took the stand as the defense began rebutting two weeks of testimony from prosecution witnesses in Rock­ingham County Superior Court. 
Prosecutors charge that Smart seduced Flynn, then used her emotional control over him to get him and two friends to murder her 24-year-old hus­band, Gregory, because she feared losing everything in a di­vorce. 
The defense says the three "thrill-killers" from Seabrook murdered the young insurance salesman on their own, then framed his widow to avoid life

Smart said she thought her husband died from being hit on the head with a candlestick, and didn't know he had been shot until several days later. 
"One day I was driving down the road and I heard it on the radio," she said. "That's how I found out." 
Smart testified that the affair began when Flynn, then 15, was in a videotaping project she ran as media coordinator at Winnacunnet High School in Hampton. When he told her he had a crush on her, she testified, she replied that she liked him but was married and wasn't interested. 
A tearful Flynn testified last week that he didn't want to kill Smart's husband, but did so when she made it clear she would end their affair if he didn't..

Nixon visits Soviet Union to check pace of reforms 
MOSCOW (AP) -Former President Nixon arrived in the Soviet Union on Monday to check the pace of Soviet Presi­dent Mikhail Gorbachev's re­forms. 
Nixon plans to meet with politicians and scholars during the two-week private visit as a guest of the Institute of World Economics and International Relations. He also planned to travel to Lithuania at the invi­tation of President Vytautas Landsbergis. 
He then will report back to President Bush, aide Theresa Hollingsworth said. 
Nixon arrived during the vote count from the first Soviet ref­erendum, which dealt with preservation of the union. He told Soviet television that it was "very significant that my trip starts on the day after a refer­endum at which all Soviet peo­ple could express their opinion freely." 
This is Nixon's seventh trip to the Soviet Union. He last visited in July 1986, when he met with Gorbachev for a talk on U.S.­Soviet relations.

Bush wants Iraq to pay for "environmental terrorism" 
WASHINGTON (APl -Presi­dent Bush on Monday de­mandBd that Iraq pay war reparations for its "environmental terrorism" and said he wanted to cut arms sah!s to the Middle East. Yet, the administration also an­nounced new steps to under­write sales of military goods. 
Bush. just back from postwar talks with leaders of Britain, f'rance and Canada, compared notes with Secretary of State James Bakor Ill, who returned Sunday from a trip to the Mid­dle East and Moscow. 
Thn president said he wanted to build on a feeling of good will in thn aftnrmath of the war against Iraq to calm the turmoil in Lebanon, reconcile Arab­lsranli diffnrencns and find a solution for the Palestinian problem. 
!In cautioned, "I don't think the American people ought to think that you can wave a wand and solvn all three of these very

difficult problems at once." 
However, he added, "I think the longer one waits to take any initiatives, the danger is things revert back to a status quo. And I think that will be unacceptable." 
The United States and its al­lies in the Gulf War are holding talks at the United Nations this week on conditions for a per­manent cease-fire. 
"Broadly speaking, people know what is required," Bush said. "I would like to see us re­duce the flow of weapons into the area.... Iraq must pay reparations or pay damages. The more one looks at the envi­ronmental terrorism that they embraced ... the more the world understands that they have got to do something about that." 
He said Iraq is a wealthy na­tion that spent its money on weapons and aggression. "Now we've got to see that they use their resources for helping their own people." 
Congress discusses ways to get allies to pay war debts 
WASHINGTON (AP) -An angry Congress is about to de­cide what teeth to put in its threat to countries that haven't fully delivered on pledges to help the United States pay for the Persian Gulf War. 
With tens of billions of dollars at stake, the only question appears to be whether to send the equivalent of a warning let­ter or a burly thumb-breaker to collect the money. 
Congress should settle this week on language in war-fi­nancing legislation lawmakers expect to send to President Bush. The options range from a vague warning of "pay up, or else" to an arms-sale ban against countries that have promised more than they have delivered. 
The effort to get slow-moving allies to pay up hasn't set well with everyone in Congress. 
"What are we going to do" about countries behind in their promised payments, asked the House Appropriations Commit­tee chairman, Rep. Jamie Whit­ten, D-Miss. "Are we going to call Congress in session here and issue an edict and send troops over there?" 
"Is this the way you treat our allies and people who are help­ing you?" asked Rep. Neal Smith, D-Iowa. 
But with the allies still owing $36.6 billion from promised as­sistance totaling $54.5 billion, Whitten and Smith seem to be in a minority. The alternative, lawmakers realize, is for more of the war's costs to be borne by

U.S. taxpayers. 
"Our allies have a moral obli­gation to pay their share of the cost of this war," said Rep. Jim Chapman, D-Texas, who spon­sored the provision approved by the House March 7. "The American people have already paid with their lives, their troops, their will and their com­mitment," Chapman said. 
Last Thursday, the Senate Appropriations Committee without discussion endorsed a prohibition on arms sales to countries that have not fully lived up to their pledges. 
"If the promisor nation has money to buy arms from us, it can first use that money to ful­fill its pledge to help defray some of our costs," said the re­port accompanying the Senate bill. 
With little dissent, the House voted March 7 for milder lan­guage that vaguely warned, "If these commitments are not met, the Congress may consider appropriate action." 
The measure, cosponsored by Rep. Carl Pursell, R-Mich., gave contributing countries until April 15 to pay up -.the same deadline Americans face for their income taxes. 
Although the House provision does not state what action Congress might take, Pursell talked earlier in the month about requiring trade negotia­tors to take "appropriate action. " That represented a clear effort to get the attention of trading giant Japan, which has so far delivered $1.3 billion out of $10.7 billion in promised help. 
The two chambers plan to work out a compromise provi­sion this week. From the begin­ning, however, the House and Senate seemed to have separate groups of allies in mind in preparing their threats. 
In the House, much of the de­bate focused on .Japan and Germany, economic powers often singled out for criticism by lawmakers. So far, Germany has pledged $6.6 billion in aid and paid $3 billion. 
"Our European allies as a whole are 40 percent de­pendent on that region, and Japan is more than 65 percent dependent on that region" for oil, said Rep. Mary Rose Oakar, D-Ohio. "And yet our allies are not paying their fair share." 
The Senate ban on arms sales would hit hardest at Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, which together have requests pending for modern 
U.S. weapons totaling $19 bil­lion. 
Saudi Arabia has made good on $6.1 billion out of $16.8 bil­lion it has promised, while the United Arab Emirates has paid half the $4 billion it has pledged. 
The Senate provision was harshest on the United Arab Emirates (U.A.E.). The report stated that the U.A.E. rejected a 
U.S. request for $7 billion in aid, despite that country's oil wealth and its proximity to Iraq. This did not go over well with the senators.

Israeli official rejects Arafat's offer to talk 
PARIS (AP) -An Israeli offi­cial on Monday dismissed a re­ported offer by Yasser Arafat to participate in direct talks with the Jewish state. 
Arafat's offer for talks medi­ated by U.N. Security Council members appeared to mark a softening on the part of the PLO leader. In the past, he had insisted on an international conference, with other Arab nations present, to solve the Palestinian question. 
"I accept talks with the Is­raelis in the presence of the five permanent members of the Security Council at the negotiating table because I want a guarantee, and I need the pressure of the five on Israel," Arafat was quoted as saying Monday in the conservative Paris newspaper Le Figaro. 
Israel and the United States favor direct discussions be­tween Palestinians and Israelis, but Israel has refused any talks with Arafat or his Palestine Liberation Organization. An Is­raeli Foreign Ministry official reiterated that position. 
"We have said repeatedly we do not deal with terrorist or­ganizations," said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity, in Jerusalem. 
Arafat said he couldn't accept Palestinians chosen from inside the Israeli-occupied territories to represent Palestinians in talks with Israel. 
"Our people has its leader­ship outside," he said."We can­not accept that the Israelis put this type of conditions on the dialogue, because we set none." 
Mocking the Israeli refusal to deal with those whom it consid­ers terrorists, Arafat said Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir used terrorist tactics when he was a leader of the Stern gang in Israel's war for independence. 
"At least he's honest about his reasons for wanting the council involved," said a U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity. "He wants pres­sure on Israel, and that's ex­actly why the United States and Israel don't like that idea." 
Arafat said Israel's accep­tance of an eventual Palestinian state was not necessary for the talks to begin. 
"The only thing that I have asked for is that international law -that is, the resolutions of the Security Council -con­stitute the platform for discus­sions," Arafat said. Security Council resolutions insist Israel withdraw from the territories it

occupied during the 1967 war. 
Arafat's credibility in much of the world has been eroded by his support for Iraqi" President Saddam Hussein during the Gulf War. Arafat sought to downplay that support in the interview, which Le Figaro said was conducted Sunday in Tunis, Tunisia, the PLO headquarters. 
"I was not with Saddam. It was Saddam who was with me, who took up my cause," Arafat was quoted as saying. "He is the first Arab head of state who dared make the link between oil and the Palestinian cause." 
Arafat said President Bush's outlines for a Mideast peace plan, carried through the re­gion last week by U.S. Secre­tary of State James Baker, con­tained "positive elements." 
Arafat said Shamir was the main obstacle to talks, "because he benefits from the unlimited support of the United States." 
The "ball is now in the Amer­ican court," Arafat said.

'Starlight' tickets go on sale 
By JAHNELLE HARRIGAN 
Assistant Accent Editor 
In tlw tradition of the YPar of Wonwn. Notre Dame is featur­ing a weekly film series on wonwn. which began last night with tlw movie "Beadws" and will r.ontinue each Monday Pvnning for the rwxt live weeks. 
Tlw series, entitled "Women: A Film Fr.stival; flow Filmmakers Depkt Women," is co-sponsored by the Year of Women Co mm itte1~ and the Office of Educational Media. It consists of six films which were seii~CtHd by Sr. Elaine DesHosiers. O.P., director of 1~ducational media at Notre Dame. 
Acknowledging "how diflkult it is to choose six films from the vast colleetion of films that lend themselves to the study of women." Sr. DesHosiers said that "most are by women direc­tors, produeers and writers, and somn arn adaptations of novels by women." 
The primary goal of the film series is to give a sense of how women are depicted in film. both in thn past and present. According to Sr. I>esHosiers, tlwre is "a broad a seope (of depictions of women) as there are filmmakers." At the present time, however, she notes that tlwre is more emphasis on abuse in films about women, which tends to give a poor im­age of women based on stereo­types. 
The series began last night with the 1988 film "Beaches," directnd by Garry Marshall. This film, depicting a thirty­year friendship of a working dass Jnwish woman from the Bronx and an aristocratic WASP woman from San Francisco, featured perfor­mances by actors Bette Midler, Barbara Hershey, John Heard and Spalding Gray. 
"My Brilliant Career," a 1979 film, directed by Gilian Armstrong, will be shown on March 25. It features Judy Davis, Sam Neill, and Wendy Hughes who portray the life of a purposefully unmarried 19th century Australian woman. 
"Harlan County, U.S.A.," to be shown on April 8, is a 1977 film. produeed and directed by Barbara Capella. which docu­ments the efforts of 180 coal mining families to obtain a union contract. 
The fourth film in the series is "A Woman of the Dunes," a 1964 film, which will be shown on April 15. It was directed by Hiroshi Teshigahara. and pre­sents an allegory of modern life through a mysterious story about a woman who entraps a man. 
"Mnn," a 1985 film directed by Doris Dorrie. will be shown on April 22. It explores a sort of masculinity from a woman's point of view and features ac­tors Heiner Lauterbaeh, Ulrike Kriener, Uwe Ochsenknecht. and Janna MarangasofT. 
final film is the 1985 film "The Color Purple," which was directed by Stephen Spielberg. It features perfor­mances by Whoopi Goldberg and Oprah Winfrey and deals with the growth to maturity and independence of an abused rural black woman. 
Sr. DesRosiers believes that there is a particular need for an increased emphasis on women at Notre Dame. and be­cause of this, the film series is targeted at a general audience of students, faculty, and the outer South Bend community. 
Sr. DesRosiers emphasized that although the series "might attract more women, it is not purely a woman's series." 
She said that while each film is excellent. "the value of the series will far exceed the value of any individual film," and she hopes that after each of the films, members of the audience will remain for discussion. 
With the exception of "Harlan County, U.S.A.," which will be shown in the ETS Theatre of the Center for Continuing Education. all of the films will be presented in the Cushing Engineering Auditorium. Each film will be shown at 7:30p.m.. and admission is $2.50. 
Tickets for "Starlight performances of the Express," Andrew Lloyd production on Friday, Webber's international hit Saturday, and Sunday. musical spectacular, will be available today and The ticket office will also Wednesday at the Gate 10 be open on show days from ticket office at the JACC 10 a.m. to curtain time.

the sevtmth round Monday night when referee Richard Steele stopped the fight after a flurry sent Huddock to the ropes but did not drop him. 
Huddock turned his hands up and looked at Steele in disbelief that the fight was over, then bodyguards representing both camps piled into the ring and a melee brokn out. 
Chaos reigned for several sneonds. 
Tyson knocked Huddock down in the second round and again in the third. Huddock, hownvnr, came on strong in the sixth and had Tyson in trouble latn in tho round with several hooks and a right hand. 
In the seventh, action slowed until Tyson landed a six-punch combination with both hands that sent Huddock back to the ropes and Steeh1 stopped it at 2:22. 
When order was restored in the ring and thn time was an­nounced. there were thunder­ous boos from the crowd of more than 15,000 in an outdoor were still pitching people from the ring. 
The last two punches that drove Ruddock into the ropes were a right hand and a left hook. He appeared dazed but looked more shocked at Steele's decision than from Tyson's punches. 
The fight was marked by thunderous punches from both men as they tried to end it from the outset. It was also inarked by wildness and by a lot of clutching and grabbing. 
'1\velve seconds into the sec­ond round, Tyson, winning for the third time since his upset ti­tle loss to James "Buster" Douglas 13 months ago, scored a nash knockdown with a left hook to the head. 
Huddock bounced up, sig­naled he was not hurt and took the mandatory 8-count. Tyson dominated the remainder of the round with body shots. 
Ruddock was in more serious trouble in the third when, with the round drawing to a close, he went down from a left hook. 
Tyson dominated the fourth round, again with body shots, as Ruddock appeared tired and befuddled. If he landed an up­percut, it seemed to do no damage. Many of his punches were blocked. 
In the sixth, however, Ruddock appeared like he might change the course of the fight. With about 10 seconds left in the round, he shook Tyson with a left hook, a right, a left and another hook. Tyson punched back but Ruddock landed a couple more hooks be­fore the bell sounded. 
Ruddock said, "Tyson hits hard for his size, but I am dis­appointed they stopped the light." 
Murad Muhammad, .Rud­dock's promoter, shouted, "We get a rematch or we go to court." 

The victory places Tyson in position to challenge the winner on April 19 at Atlantic City. Promoter Don King has said Tyson would fight Foreman should he win, but he would not fight Holyfield because Holyfield refused to make a defense against Tyson before fighting Foreman. 
Money talks in boxing, how­ever, and Tyson against the winner of that fight would be boxing's biggest money match. 
''I'm looking to fight Mike Tyson," Holyfield said after Tyson's victory.

asking themselves, who?" after upsets 
nation only to Nevada-Las Vegas' 43-game streak, will be on the line Friday against North Carolina in the East Regional semifinal at East Hutherford, N.J. 
Eastern Michigan (26-6) the 12th seed in the East, earned its way into the tournament by claiming the Mid-American Conference title after claiming the regular-season crown with a 13-3 record. 
The team, which has already set a school record for wins, had made the NCAA in 1988 for the first time and this year set a higher goal. 
"Maybe a couple years ago we were happy just to be in the tournament because it was the first time we were there," Braun said. "But I don't think that's the case anymore. 
"The players believe in themselves, believe in each other. They're playing to win." 
Guard Lorenzo Neely said the 
team wants to prove the MAC 
belongs in the tournament 
alongside the traditional bas­ketball powerhouse confer­ences. 
"I always feel to myself we're all on the same level," Neely said. "It's just that they get more publicity day in and day out and the Mid-American Conference doesn't." 
This is the second year in a row a MAC representative made the Sweet 16 in the NCAA. Ball State did it last year, but Eastern Michigan has never advanced this far. 
The team boasts an inside game built around 6-foot-7 center Marcus Kennedy, who led the league in scoring with a 20-point average. 
Women

(third) and sophomore Kay Broderick (fourth). Tri also emerged as a breaststroker in the last month of the season. placing seventh in the 200 breast (2:27.87). 
Senior Christy Moston finished sixth in both the 100 and 200 backstrokes, while senior Jean Kelly scored points and recorded personal best times in both the 200 IM and 100 butterfly. Co-captain Chrissy Ciletti also recorded a lifetime best in the 1000 freestyle. 
Co-captain Tracie O'Connell and senior Callie Bolattino swam legs on university record breaking relays. O'Connell anchored the 200 freestyle relay team (1 :39.04). Bolattino swam the breaststroke leg on the 200 medley relay team of Stephens, Williams and Alicia Feehery (1:49.36) . 
"When a program is strong, seniors hav.e a good championship meet," said Welsh. "The seniors swam a phenomenal meet and in the process established the tone of the meet." 
Feehery also anchored the third Irish record-setting relay, the 800 freestyle relay team of Susan Bohdan. Colette LaForce, Williams and Feehery (7:45.54) . Bohdan also set a university record in the 500 freestyle (5:05.97). 
Welsh was pleased with the season's results and looks forward to the NCAA meet. Williams will compete in the 200 and 400 IM and the 200 fly this week in Indianapolis. Last year Williams placed 11th in the 400 IM and 27th in the fly. Welsh predicts her im­provement this year as a racer will translate into an improved performance at NCAA's.

Ismail's unbeaten streak snapped at NCAA meet 
By HUGH MUNDY Sports Writer 
After a track campaign in which Raghib "Rocket" Ismail broke several 55-meter dash records enroute to an unde­feated season, the Notre Dame sprinter had a streak of his own broken at last Saturday's NCAA Indoor Track and Field Championships. 
Washington State's Augustine Olobia edged out Ismail in· the 55-meter final to capture first place and end the Rocket's ca­reer unbeaten record. 
Olobia crossed the finish line in 6.17 seconds while runner-up Ismail posted a time of 6.19. 
Although unaccustomed to defeat, the always upbeat Ismail praised Olobia's effort. 
"He was really strong," re­marked Ismail. "I think we were all a little tired going into the finals." 
Ismail will now look towards an outdoor season in whieh he will compete in the 100-metet dash. 
Although Ismail has not com­peted at that distance since high school, Irish sprint coach John Millar believes the Rocket possesses the ability to succeed on a national level. 
In other races, Irish captain Ryan Cahill failed to advance to the finals in the 3,000 meter run, finishing a disappointing seventh in his heat. 
Although Cahill was not sat­isfied with his performance, he was impressed with the meet's high level of competition. 
"It was a great opportunity to

Softball finishes 2nd at Sycamore Classic 
By JENNIFER MARTEN Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame softball team played fifteen games over a busy spring break. The break was a time for the team to learn more about themselves and the season. 
The team finished with a 5­10 record and a second-place finish in the Sycamore Classic at Indiana State. 
"We didn't play as well as I had hoped we would, but we played well in every game ex­cept one, and we got an indica­tion of what we can do," said Notre Dame coach Brian Boulac. 
Starting the break off on the wrong foot, the Irish lost their first two games to Miami of Ohio. The team also had trouble with Pittsburg State, Iowa State and Washburn at the University of Houston tournament. 
Boulac summed up the prob­lem this way: "We just can't make mistakes and let them compound. We were our own worst enemy in too many in­stances." 
In Houston, the team defeated Upper Iowa 5-0. The Irish jumped to an early lead by scoring two runs in the first in­ning, and that was all they needed due to the solid pitching of freshman Carrie Miller. Miller fanned nine in five in­nings of work. Junior Ruth Kmak led the Irish offensively with two singles. 
Against North Carolina, sophomore Staci Alford and Miller pitched the Irish to a 3-1 victory. Junior Amy Folsom, senior Megan Fay, and Miller each had a run-scoring hit in the sixth inning to break open the game. 
In the lf!.st game in Houston, sophomore Debbie Boulac led

knew it was then or never." 
Notre Dame kept its poise, however, and retook the lead for good with 8:36 left on a Davis lay-up. That started a 9-2 Irish spurt which gave them a 56-48 lead with 1:33 remaining. 
However, the play that sealed the game for Notre Dame was a controversial intentional foul called on Bulldog star Julie VonDielingen as Karen Robin­son went in for a lay-up. Robinson sank both free throws, and on the subsequent possession, Coquese Wash­ington hit two more foul shots to boost the lead to 60-50 with 55 seconds left. 
"We were dead then," said Butler coach Paulette Stein. "That play put an end to any ray of hope we had." 
VonDielingen led all scorers with 23 points, but no other Bulldog was in double figures. Robinson was high scorer for Notre Dame with 22 points, while Davis chipped in 17 to earn the tourney's Most Valuable Player award. 
"Butler played a great game. There were a couple of times when we lost our composure, but our senior leadership took over and settled us down," McGraw said. 
., But it still wasn't enough. ''I'm very disappointed, espe­cially for the seniors," McGraw said. "They felt like they were ripped off, that they deserved a bid. It's simply unfair." "I was empty inside," Davis said. "We had our chance, but instead of making it so they couldn't turn us down, those two losses put it in their hands, and they decided we didn't be­long." 

inning. The Irish capitalized on many Bowling Green's mis­takes. Their four runs were scored without the benefit of a hit. Instead, walks, sacrifices, errors and hit batters gave them the victory. Miller notched the win for the Irish on the mound. 
In the 5-0 win against Indiana State, the Irish exploded in the third inning for five runs to seal the win and advance to the finals. Crossen, Boulac, Folsom and freshman Christy Connoyer 
Debbie Boulac all contributed RBis, while Linn the Irish to their 1-0 win and Alford combined their against Temple. Boulac's RBI efforts on the mound for the triple in the fourth inning drove win. in the only run of the game, but In the championship game,

The Notre .Dame men's swim team rewrote virtually its entire record book this season. 
The Irish set 17 university records at the National Catholics in December and continued their record-setting trend at the Eastern Intercollegiate Championships March 6-9. Four relay records and nine individual records fell-including one tie-as the Irish moved up a notch from their third-place finish in 1990. 
Southern Illinois captured first with 772 points, while Notre Dame rallied over Duke and St. Bonaventure to finish second with 546 points. The Blue Devils and the Bonnies followed close behind with West Virginia rounding out the top five. 
Sophomore Ed Broderick highlighted Irish performances with double wins and record­setting times in the 200 individual medley 
(1:50.94) and the 200 breaststroke (2:03.01). Broderick's breast time set a new meet record,

Sophomore Tanya Williams and the senior women led the Notre Dame swim team to a second place finish at the Eastern Intercollegiates held March 6-9 at Cleveland State University. 
Williams' winning times in the 200 individual medley (1:49.36) and 400 medley (4:27.85) broke meet records and assisted the Irish in tallying 595 points behind first place West Virginia's 651 points. St. Bonaventure scored 444 points ahead of Southern Illinois, Cleveland State, N.C. Wilmington, University of Maryland-Baltimore County, Duke, George Washington and Rutgers. 
Since Williams already qualified for NCAA's, she didn't rest for Easterns, but she raced against rested swimmers who were trying to qualify for NCAA's. 
"Tanya demonstrated what an outstanding athlete she is. She faced an extremely stiff challenge, accepted that challenge and won," said Irish coach Tim Welsh.

Hockey loses to Seawolves in tourney final 
By RICH KURZ 
Associate Sports Editor 
The Notre Dame hockey team experienced a roller coaster of sorts when it traveled to the Jeep/Eagle Independent Tour­nament in Alaska two weekends ago. 
One the one hand was a gritty, 4-3 win over Alaska­Fairbanks, which was on track to be the independent represen­tative in the NCAA Tournament. On the other hand, the Irish got bombed 10-2 by Alaska­Anchorage on Saturday night when it was staking its claim to the NCAA bid that Fairbanks vacated. 
The championship game of the tournament started on a good note for the Irish, as they jumped out to a 1-0 lead on a Lou Zadra goal 5:40 into the game, on assists by David Bankoske and·Dan Sawyer. 
Notre Dame and Anchorage traded scores over the next three minutes, and then Anchorage took a one-goal lead with five minutes left in the first period. The two teams then played evenly until, with seven minutes left in the second stanza, the flood gates opened. 
Alaska-Anchorage bom­barded Irish goalie Greg Louder with 32 shots in just the second and third periods, and Louder wasn't able to withstand the onslaught. Anchorage scored seven unanswered goals in the last 27 minutes of play, and the Notre Dame season ended with a 10-2 defeat. 
"They were bigger and stronger," said Irish coach Ric Schafer. "They flexed their muscles and that was it." 
While the Irish were pretty much out of the NCAA Tournament going into the weekend, Anchorage knew a strong performance would propel them into the tour.ney. 
"They were playing for a berth in the national tourna­ment," said Schafer. "If they hadn't won that game, 
Fairbanks probably would have gone. Circumstances were such that they were an inspired hockey team." 
The previous night's game, against Alaska-Fairbanks was something different, however. The Irish jumped out to a quick lead and never looked back, although they did have to weather a strong run by the Nanooks to escape with a 4-3 victory. 
Notre Dame wing Lou Zadra, who was named to the All­Tourney Team, scored the first of his two goals just four min­utes into the game to give the Irish a 1-0 lead, and Tom Miniscalco added another goal for Notre Dame with 7 112 minutes left in the period to in­crease the lead to 2-0, before Fairbanks, Notre Dame coach Ric Schafer's previous team, could get on the board.
