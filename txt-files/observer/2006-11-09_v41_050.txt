New city sewer work blocks campus traffic 
By MARCELA BERRIOS 
News Writer 
Drivers and pedestrians traveling between the west end of Saint Mary's Lake and Douglas Road will be inconve­nienced this week, as massive construction developments have forced Saint Mary's Road to close at Indiana 933. 
They may, however, feel bet­ter knowing that the digging is all part of Notre Dame's plan to construct a sewer system that will transport sanitary sewage from the campus directly to the county's pro­cessing plant -no longer relying on South Bend pipelines as its distributors, and helping the city consider­ably reduce its sewer over­flows. 
Paul Kempf, the director of Utilities in the Notre Dame Office of Business Operations, explained the reasoning behind the construction deci­sion. 
"After over 50 years of use the original trunk sewer con­nection to the POTW [Publicly Owned Treatment Works] is nearing its capacity, and the current project will replace the existing trunk sewer with a larger trunk sewer to handle future growth of the University of Notre Dame," Kempf said.

In terms of fundraising, organizers said money would go toward building a medical clinic for the Notre Dame­sponsored Millennium Village in Uganda. The fig­ure of $10,000 was men­tioned as a starting goal, though the cost of the med­ical clinic is expected to be higher.

LSAT undergoes change for 2007 
By KATE ANTONACCI

Four times a year, students with dreams of becoming lawyers sit in hundreds of locations around the world and take a $118, half-day standardized test -one that has remained nearly unchanged for the last 15 years. 
Beginning in June 2007, however, this exam -the Law School Admission Test (LSAT) -will feature two small, yet significant, changes recently announced by the Law School Admission Council (LSAC).

When over 50 representa­tives from academic, athlet­ic, cultural, media and serv­ice clubs come together, it's not just any old Wednesday night on campus. 
Senior co-organizers Amanda Golbabai and Bryan Hambley called a variety of student leaders together to get the ball rolling on plans 
to  respond  to  the  global  
health crisis.  
The issue of the  global  

health crisis was the subject of the Notre Dame Forum this year and the question of what the student body can do was the subject of 
Wednesday night's 10 p.m. meeting in the Notre Dame Room of the LaFortune Student Center. 
"If we all work together we're going to come up with something great," Golbabai said. 
Golbabai and Hambley put forth several goals in a handout to attendees, name­ly "to have a series of events and initiatives in response to the global health crisis that all student organizations would sponsor together." 
The student representa­tives present at the meeting do not constitute a formal organization. No name has been given to the collection of leaders participating in the health crisis response bat poverty, illiteracy, hunger, disease and injustice." 
As a public healt.h program, the Pastoral of the Child works with more than 265,000 world­wide volunteers that supply the needy with everything from nutrition to immunizations. 
The organization -founded by Neumann and her brother in Brazil in 1983 -began when Cardinal Paulo Evaristo Arns, then archbishop of Sao Paulo, asked if she could do some­thing to prevent Brazilian chil­dren from dying of preventable causes. 
After receiving the award Neuman thanked many people, but she had special words of praise for the organization's

Discussion addresses penalty 
Brooks suggests death sentence results in closure for families 
By KAITLYNN REILY 
News Writer 
While often defended as a means of closure and healing for victims' families, the death penalty is a form of revenge that fails to bring peace, Deacon George said Wednesday night in the Hesburgh Center auditorium. 
Brooks, the former director of advocacy and jail chaplain for Kolbe House in Chicago, gave examples of arguments capital punishment opponents might use against death penalty advocates. 
Some people may claim that the death penalty brings peace to the victims' families, Brooks said. But if this is true, he asked, why do only two per­
cent  of murderers  in  the  
United  States  receive  the  
death penalty?  

"If in fact the death penalty is so good for the victims' fam­ilies, and if it gives them peace of mind and healing -if it gives dignity to the person who has been murdered ­then we are saying that the state has arbitrarily chosen 98 percent of the victims' families to have no healing and to not get dignity and respect for the person murdered," he said. 
Brooks, who dissolved his law firm when he was ordained a deacon in 1991, pointed out the discrepancy

and latch onto the throat'> of individuals and their families. When campaign ads say nothing about political platforms, and instead are intent on showing how 
'unfurmy' an opponent is. 
After each election, there are always some "civil hands" in need of washing. 
One of the most unsavory elements of this kind of over-the-top antipathy for 'the other guy' is the way in which children are pulled down into the mud with the rest of us. 
Late Tuesday night during CNN's elec­tion coverage, a woman called in to speak on behalf of her 12-year-old daughter. The girl, she said, was distressed about the Democrats' victories, because she loved President Bush. The CNN analyst asked that the girl-we'll call her Jane­be put on the line. 
Jane, in a soft but very assured voice, told the analyst that what was really upsetting about the election was not so much that the President's party was los­ing, but that she knew that the winning Democrats were "all really immoral peo­ple." 
That was from a sixth-grader. 
When I was nine, my entire class wrote to political leaders. Most people picked then-President Bill Clinton or Hillary­but, not knowing much of anything about politics, I made my decision based on the person receiving the smallest number of letters. 
That person was Rick Santorum-the Pennsylvania Representative who had just been elected to the Senate. No one else wanted to write to him, and I took pity. 
Big mistake. 
Weeks went by. Everyone else in the class brought in their signed pictures of "Slick Willy" -as my dad still calls him -but my mailbox remained empty. Finally, I was the only one left without even a letter to show for my efforts. And thus was born the grudge that lasts even to this day. 
Eventually, I began to dislike Santorum for more informed reasons, but for many years I thought of him only as "the bad man who doesn't care about little girls," and hissed every time I heard him men­tioned. 
Yes, I literally hissed. 
Now, in the world of politics, it's one thing for an adult to call another adult a baby killer, a warmonger, a sleazy syco­phant. 
It's another for children to become involved in the muckraking, to be used by their parents -or political candidates ­as mouth-pieces for a cause they don't even understand. 
It was disturbing to hear that little girl on CNN last night -just as disturbing as the deep anger I still harbor for Santo rum. 
I'm just glad my mother never put me on the phone.

Beijing institutes 1 dog per family rule 
BEIJING -First it was one child. Now authorities say Beijing families will be allowed only one dog. 
The restriction is part of efforts to stamp out rabies, state media said Wednesday. It follows a campaign in August in which thousands of dogs were killed in order to fight the disease. 
China's capital will insti­tute a "one dog" policy for each household in nine areas, the official Xinhua News Agency said. 
"Only one pet dog is allowed per household in the zones, and dangerous 
and large dogs will be banned. Anyone keeping an unlicensed dog will face prosecution," Xinhua said. 
Rabies is on the rise in China, with 2,651 reported deaths from the disease in 2004, the last year for which data were available. 
Only 3 percent of China's dogs arc vaccinated against rabies, which attacks the nervous system and can be fatal.

STUDENT SENATE 
Group addresses student-alumni relations 
By MARY KATE MALONE News Editor 
After a disappointing turnout at the three student-alumni receptions this fall, the Student Senate examined what went wrong with the event and brain­stormed ways to make it better at its meeting Wednesday. 
University Affairs committee chair Aly Baumgartner headed the gatherings, which she said were meant to cultivate a better relationship between alumni and current students. 
Student turnout, however, was dismal. The first reception, held on Sept. 28 before the Purdue game, drew about 50 people ­and that was the most popular. The second, on Oct. 6 before the Stanford game, had just 20 peo­ple. At the fmal one, held Nov. 4, Baumgartner counted about 30 visitors. 
"We didn't get as many stu­dents as we would have liked," Baumgartner said. 
Breen-Phillips senator Maris Brown said senators, given their role as student leaders, "did a really poor job" attending and promoting the event. 
"I was really disappointed with the Senate's showing," Brown said. "I think we have a responsi­bility to go to this. . . . I mean if we don't come, and we're stu­dent leaders, then how are we going to expect anyone else to come?'' 
Some senators said the time of the reception -late afternoon on a football Friday -was inconvenient for most students. 
St. Edward's senator Brian Lan suggested making the reception more public, which would proba­bly draw in students passing by, he said. 
"If they smell food, they'll come over sooner or later and check it out," Lan said. 
Baumgartner said tailoring the receptions for specific majors could also attract more students. That tactic was used for the final reception, when alumni in the entertainment industry attended the event. Film, Television and Theatre majors were especially encouraged to visit that recep­tion. 
Baumgartner and student body vice president Bill Andrichik will meet with representatives from the Alumni Association later this year to discuss the receptions. After that, the responsibility to plan and prepare them again next year will fall on the Student­Alumni Relations Group, a stu­dent club on campus. 
"We can hand this off so it's not a student government initiative but an· issue that can keep going regardless of student leader­ship," Andrichik said. 
In other Senate news: 
+It's possible that Saturday's football game against Air Force will be aired at the Stepan Center, Director of Student Activities Brian Coughlin said. His office is "looking into the pos-sibility" of renting a temporary satellite truck that would attach to the Stepan Center, he said. 

+Last week's Senate resolution calling for more on-campus resources for Native American students will be presented to the Campus Life Council Nov. 13, stu­dent body president Lizzi Shappell told senators. Another resolution passed last week, which called for Holy Cross stu­dents to have access to the Rockne Memorial until the com­pletion of their new athletic facil­ity, was given to the vice presi­dent of student affairs at Holy Cross. 
+ Siegfriend senator Jim Lockwood asked what measures were being taken to make stu­dent government more accessi­ble to those who want to get involved. 
Andrichik said the revamped student government Web site, which is not yet fmished, will be an easy way to get information about student government. · 
Director of Communications Alex French said members of his department reported that, for the most part, they had little trouble getting information they needed 
about student government. "But it never hurts to advertise more," he said. 
Lockwood said he could not determine who Siegfried's Judicial Council member was. When he contacted the Judicial Council, he was told the Siegfried representative was not attending Judicial Council meetings. 
Shappell said she would dis­cuss attendance at Judicial Council meetings with the Council of Representatives Nov. 14.

Online magazine returns 
Publication re-launched after criticism caused shut down last semester 
By JENNIFER METZ 
News Writer 
Adding its voice to those of established campus publications, newly reworked The Thatcher encourages literary innovation. 
The Thatcher is Notre Dame's only independent, online literary magazine. Edited by senior Alexa Recio, it was started last year for student writers to col­laborate and produce publish­able stories. 
"[Notre Dame literary maga­zine] The Juggler mostly pub­lishes poetry," Recio said. "We wanted to create a magazine for short stories as well." 
Recio said she and co-founder Christopher Mahoney, who grad­uated last May, wanted a maga­zine that could change "the way people thought about writers" and could introduce the idea of "writing as a community." 
The magazine is only available online at www. thethatch­



Sewers

itary sewage was channeled into South Bend's main intercepting sewage pipelines -where it mixed with the city's storm waters and sewage -before reach­ing the POTW, Kempf said. 
However, during the wet seasons when severe storms added significant amounts of rain water to the system, Kempf said the POTW could not always handle the full flow of' the city's main sewer. 
"In order to relieve this sit­uation, overflows occur along the interceptor sewer," Kempf said. "These over­flows are principally storm water mixed with a small percentage or sanitary sewage, and the overflows in South Bend's case flow into the river." 
With these infrequent but serious overf1ows becoming an environmental concern, the United States Environmental Protection Agency and the Indiana Department of' Environmental Management stepped in to mandate the improvement of the tradi­tional sewage systems to eliminate the overflows, Kempf said. 
South Bend then developed a Long Term Control Plan that will address the situa­tion over time, beginning with the construction or a new system that will trans­port Notre Dame sanitary sewage -one of the POTW's largest customers -directly to the POTW and reduce the stream coming from the city's main sewage lines. 
Construction of Notre Dame's portion of the project -a collaboration between the University and South Bend -closed Saint Mary's Road on Monday, which will not reopen until Friday. The entire project is seheduled for completion during the spring of 2007. 

In the meantime, a pedes­trian path has opened around the construction, through Fatima House prop­erty. 
Motorists are ad vised to use the Douglas Hoad or Dorr Hoad entrances to the campus during these days. 
Once the entire project is completed, the sewage line will head west aeross IN 933, through portions of the Saint Mary's campus, then north along the Indiana Toll Road Interchange, west across !'armland belonging to the Sisters of Holy Cross and under the St. Joseph River before arriving at the POTW, Kempf said. 
Since its inception in the 1950s, the POTW has treated waste !'rom the South Bend sewer system -which is principally a combined sys­tem that carries both storm waters and sanitary sewage. 
Although Notre Dame has separate storm and sanitary sewer systems, the campus sanitary sewage alone is one of the biggest components in the city's main line. And as the University only expects to grow in the coming years, the construction of its own connection to the POTW seemed appropriate. 
"The new sewer has been sized to handle the long term growth plan of the University and should serve its needs for generations to come," Kempf said.

Japan suspends U.S. beef imports 
TOKYO -Japan said Wednesday it has halted beef imports from one U.S. meat­packing plant after finding a shipment with improper documentation, a development that may test the public's concern about the safety of American beef imports. 
The Agriculture and Health ministries decided to halt shipments from Swift & Co.'s plant in Greeley, Colo., after a ship­ment from the facility arrived in Osaka without proper documentation for some of the internal organs contained within, Agriculture Ministry official Yasushi Yamaguchi said.

Analysts say the Kremlin is determined not to push Iran into a corner like North Korea-blaming tough U.S. policies for Pyongyang's recent nuclear test -but Tehran's refusal to compromise has led to growing impatience in Moscow despite the two countries' close commercial ties.

Democrats take control of Senate 
WASHINGTON -Democrats wrested con­trol of the Senate from Republicans Wednesday with an upset victory in Virginia, giving the party complete domination of Capitol Hill for the first time since 1994. 
Jim Webb's squeaker win over incumbent Sen. George Allen gave Democrats their 51st seat in the Senate, an astonishing turnabout at the hands of voters unhappy with Republican scandal and unabated violence in Iraq. Allen was the sixth Republican incum­bent senator defeated in Tuesday's elections. 
The Senate had teetered at 50 Democrats, 49 Republicans for most of Wednesday, with Virginia hanging in the balance. Webb's vic­tory ended Republican hopes of eking out a 50-50 split, with Vice President Dick Cheney wielding tie-breaking authority.

Secretary of Defense resigns 
President accepts Rumsfeld's resignation, names Robert Bates as replacement 
Associated Press 

WASHINGTON Humor was not Donald H. Humsfeld's best-known trait during his tenure at the Pentagoo. But on the day he called it quits, he cracked a telling joke. 
"It recalls to mind the statement by Winston Churchill, something to the effect that: 'I have benefited greatly from criticism, and at no time have I suffered a lack thereof,"' Humsfeld said with a slight grin. 
That from a man who was a lightning rod for criticism of the Iraq war and other Bush adminis­tration defense policies. After fending off the crit­ics for much of his nearly six years at the Pentagon, Rumsfeld said Wednesday that he and President Bush decided it was time to start fresh, with per­haps new ideas on Iraq. 
Iraq was the central issue of Humsfeld 's tenure, and unhappiness with the war was a major element of voter dissatis­faction Tuesday -and the main impetus for his departure.

In the entering class of 2004 -the most recent year for which Preacher has fig­ures -there were 470 law school applicants from Notre Dame, of which 182 were seniors and 288 were non­seniors. 
"In the 2004 entering class, the average LSAT of all appli­cants was 159, for seniors the average was 160.4 and for non-seniors 158.2," Preacher said. 
Despite the high numbers ­which Baron said places Notre Dame high nationally among numbers of law school applicants -Preacher said the University is experiencing a decrease. 
"By all accounts, it's drop­ping," Preacher said. "We had a peak in 2003 or 2004, but now we're seeing a drop." 
Preacher said the drop in law school applicants from Notre Dame may have some­thing to do with the economy, and that people "tend to apply to law school because it is a secure profession." 
Not that she sees the drop as a bad thing. Preacher said she is notorious for advising students to take time off before heading to law school. 
"It may be the only time in your life that you have the freedom to do what you want to do without any strings," she said. "I think it also gives you the chance to be absolutely certain that law school is what you want. 
''I'm seeing more and more students who are taking time off, but we still have many who go directly in."

IN BRIEF 
UnitedHealth stocks messy since 2004 
MINNEAPOLIS -UnitedHealth Group Inc. warned investors on Wednesday that its stock option fiasco will cost much more than the $286 million it previously estimated, and said it would restate earnings all the way back to 1994. 
The company's chief financial officer also resigned but will be assuming unspecified operational duties at the nation's second largest health insurer. 
UnitedHealth said it has found problems with its handling of stock options as late as the end of 2005. 
The company said it expects to take paper losses on prior earnings to account for stock options, and that it would take cash charges to pay the potential tax bill. It said it doesn't yet know how much those charges will be. 
In May, UnitedHealth estimated that options­related restatements could slice $286 million from earnings from 2003 to 2005. On Wednesday it said it anticipates the final figure "will be significantly greater" than that. 
Democratic win causes Wall Street rise 
NEW YORK -Wall Street rose for a third straight session Wednesday, with the Dow Jones industrials reaching another record close as investors grew more confident that a huge victory by Democrats in congressional elections would result in gridlock and keep lawmakers out of the way of business interests. 
The market had largely expected Democrats to gain control of the House of Representatives, but an undecided Senate race in Virginia had, during early trading, unnerved investors who dislike such uncertainty. Stocks showed gains following the announcement that Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld will resign. 
Some investors saw "headline risk" from Wednesday's news but expect that Wall Street will quickly get back to business. 
"I would think over the next several weeks that investors should return their focus to the likelihood for interest rate moves in the decel­erating economic climate, the moderating earnings growth and the weakening housing market," said Elizabeth Weymouth, global investment specialist at JPMorgan Private Bank.

Pelosi presents economic agenda 
Democrats propose lower prescription drug costs, increase of minimum wage 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -The new masters of the House, the Democrats, are promot­ing an economic agenda that would put more money in the pockets of ordinary citizens and government, while leading to greater oversight of big business. 
California Rep. Nancy Pelosi, who is in line to become speaker, has prom­ised to fight early on in the next Congress to lower the price of prescription drugs available through Medicare. Efforts to curb military spending are also likely, political and financial ana­lysts said, following an elec­tion whose outcome was influenced in large part by voters' dissatisfaction with the handling of the war in Iraq. 
But with the two parties stalemated in the Senate, where it usually takes 60 votes to pass major legisla­tion, the pharmaceutical and defense industries may fmd themselves beset more by unwelcome rhetoric in Congress than any hurtful changes in law.

"They always want to learn more so that they are able to save more lives," she said. 
The Office of Farmworkers Ministry (OFFM) and Cristo Rey Network -two other Opus Prize finalists -were each rewarded $100,000 for their charitable work. 
OFFM received an award for its work with struggling farm workers in Apopka, Fla. and Cristo Rey Network was rewarded for its work in pro­viding a first-rate high school education for economically dis­advantaged youths in cities across America. 
Sister Ann Kendrick was pre­sented the $100,000 award for OFFM. 
"Tonight all of us honoring the people ... who are making a difference ... who look at the reality of the material poor who say we can do better than this," she said. 
Rev. John Foley accepted the award for Cristo Rey Network, and said he never thought the Network, which is on track to educate 12,000 students annu­ally by 2012, would achieve such a level of success. 
"The first day we opened school, I wanted to hide under the desk because I had no idea whether it was going to work or not," he said. 
The Student Opus Prize was awarded to junior Benjamin Gunty for co-founding Artisan Opportunities International, Inc. (AOI). AOI's goal is to battle poverty in Latin America by teaching individuals how to make quality hammocks that can be sold. 
Junior Brian Brownschidle, accepted the award for Gunty, who is studying abroad in Angers, France. 
Reading from a statement composed by Gunty, Brownschidle asked the youth in the audience to "make a pos­itive difference."

"There's far too much to be done in this promising age to let our own potential to go idle," he read. "To everyone else, I ask you to believe in us relentlessly, listen to us eritical­ly, engage us lovingly and above all else, lead us by your experience." 
University President Father John Jenkins had words of praise for the award winners and encouraged everyone pres­ent to be inspired by them. 
"They are people of faith ... they have faith, a real joy and thankfulness in their service," he said. 
Jenkins said the award recip­ients are a living witness of Jesus' words in that giving one will receive.

because he does not believe the government has the right to kill people to punish them for their crimes. 
"They are a child of God, and we don't have the right to take their life away," Brooks said. Scripture -as far back to the story of Cain and Abel -makes a case against use of the death penalty when read in con­text, Brooks said. 
"We have a history of peo­ple in Scripture who later on turn their lives around," Brooks said. "Had they been executed, what would have happened?" 
The reason why the death penalty should not exist in the U.S. was clearly expressed in Pope John Paul II's 1995 encyclical, "Evangelium vitae," Brooks said. In this document, the pope said the death penalty should not be used unless it was otherwise impossible to protect society from the con­victed criminals. 
In the United States, the prison systems are capable of containing threats, Brooks said. 
But these religious argu­ments can fail to persuade people who support the use of the death penalty to alter their convictions, he said. That's why anti-death penal­ty advocates need to give them the facts. 
"I think once people know the facts it is almost impossi­ble for any reasonable per­son to be in favor of the death penalty," Brooks said. 
Many death penalty oppo­nents fall into the trap of portraying the person on death row as a hero, he said. 
"Some of them just aren't," Brooks said. 
An indisputable argument against the death penalty, he said, is that executing some­one costs over a million dol­lars more than to imprison a convicted criminal for life without parole. 
Brooks said he believes the death penalty is not a deter­rent to potential murderers or rapists. Crimes happen spontaneously, he said, and most eriminals don't expect to be caught. 
Another argument against capital punishment is that inaccurate eye witness accounts and lack of DNA evidence can lead to irre­versible sentences, Brooks said. 
"We have flaws in the sys­tem that are so deep that the likelihood of an erroneous conviction is very high," he said. 
Brooks was involved in establishing a moratorium on the death penalty in Illinois. lie served as the president of the Illinois Coalition against the Death Penalty from 2000-02. Brooks received a Special Award for Work on the Issue of Capital Punishment from the Association of Chicago Priests and was named Catholic Lawyer of the Year by the Chicago Catholic Workers Guild in 2000. 
NDASK plans to hold four more lectures to discuss the death penalty this fall. Former Indiana Gov. Joe Kernan will speak Nov. 15 at 
7:30 p.m. in the Hammes Student Lounge of the Coleman-Morse Center. Kernan will discuss his deci­sion to commute two death sentences while he was gov­ernor.

After dis­covering that said food did not meet taste standards, the speaker returned to his or her abode to rejuvenate and gather strength, probably exhausted from the mental exertion necessary to speak like this. 
The following sentence continues the laconic report on the speaker's feelings, substituting the conveniently concise "dece" for the much more obtrusive and unwieldy "decent." The speaker then switches subjects and dismisses (employ­ing "whatevs" for "whatever") the press­ing assignment at hand, a paper of unfa­vorable repute, whlch is totally not his or her favorite. The speaker gauges the lis­tener's response by asking a comprehen­sion interrogative: "You under(stand)?" Being assured of the listener's under­standing, the speaker then interjects an exclamatory exasperation, remarking how obvious her comments are (and opt­ing for the more pithy "obvs" over the disyllabic "obvi"). 
Obvs, indeed. 
I'll admit that maybe I haven't heard these phrases exactly as given above. Sticking so many atrocious colloquialisms 



Totally dece

leave even the speaker wondering exactly. 
what had just been said. But I assure you 
that I have heard every one of these slang 
terms used in separate conversations, 
usually surrounded by a handful of simi­
lar words. (Well, okay, so I made up 
"under," but I can see somebody using 
that. Can't you?) 
Why do people talk like this? Numerous 
case studies have left scientists stumped. 
My own theory is that the degeneration of 
language in our age arises from the fact 
that we are just plain busier than any age 
before us. I mean, there are a lot of 
shows on TV. A lot. If you want to watch 
even a fraction, you have to learn to flip 
channels pretty fast. And if you want to 
write about them, what do you use? 
That's right, a keyboard. Those things 
are covered in buttons -I mean, how 
many letters can there be? The old­
timers had it so much each easier with 
their quaint pencils and paper. In this day 
and age, it's really a great burden to 
always be so occupied. 
Therefore, sacrifices have to be made. 
What's something else we all do these 
days, besides watch television and get on 
our computers? That's right: talk. And 
with so many TV shows to talk about, 
there's just never enough time. Other 
generations had their slang, their jive, 
their jargon, their jibber-jabber-and 
those all worked fine. But today, we need 
a language that can really capture the 
essence of our busy lives. We need a 
dialect that gets right down to the point, 
without wasting time on extraneous syl­
lables. 

And so we have one of the capstones of 
linguistic development in the past 
decade. Or century. Or ... ever. If you lind 
yourself still struggling with this new 
slang, don't worry, I'm seeking to remedy 
that here. Let's try working with another 
codex: 

"Anys, I've def gotta hit the lib. B.T. 
dubs, that teev show was soo sketch. 
Watch it later? Yeah, probs. You're welcs. 
Alright, outy." 
The speaker here transitions smoothly from a previous conversation to the exchange at hand using "anys," the trun­cated version of "anyway." He or she must most certainly visit the library. A side comment is introduced by a two-lay­ered curtailing "B.T. dubs." Thls unique construction is no solecism, but rather a highly intricate code for the letters "btw." This abbreviation, one we can all thank the Internet for giving us, means "by the way." 
Moving on, the speaker forsakes the traditional shortening of television to TV (far too cumbersome) in favor of combin­ing the two letters and dropping the final diphthong. Sketch stands in for sketchy, a term with which everyone is surely famil­iar. The fmal few coded terms should reveal themselves easily by now: "probs" for "probably," "welcs" for the extremely awkward and tiring "you're welcome," and "outy" for ''I'm out," a fittingly abridged adieu for such a condensed con­versation. 
This new manner of speaking isn't easy to grasp at first, and language depart­ments nationwide lack funding to ade­quately develop effective translation guides. I hope this brief primer will be but the first step in an intrepid age of exciting advancements in linguistic theo­ry. 
Thanks to Kyoko and Elizabeth for pro­viding many of the idiosyncratic words and terms used above, and thanks to the countless linguistic revolutionaries with­out whose inspiration and prescient understanding of language's bold new direction I could never have written this interpretive key. 
Outy.

"How about sex." That sentence (or actually, sentence fragment) comes from one of the students who wrote me after my last column, in which I wondered what topics undergraduates would find helpful, particularly in their lives of faith. That same student also told me that my writ­ing was too boring to hold people's attention, so I thought I'd try to pull Kate you in right from the start. Barrett 
"It's time for a new approach to the 
FaithPoint

talk about sex," this person continued. Yikes. I'm going to have to save that topic until I can give it some more thought. What would my new approach be? I'd want to be careful; the wrong kind of column and I could lose my job ... though come to think of it, then I wouldn't have to worry any more about what I'd write. 
Another student told me that most people don't really read The Observer, they just sort of skim it while they eat lunch and then throw it in the recycling bin on their way out of the dining hall. She'd love to give me some ideas for future topics, she said, but she was too busy and had to go write a paper. I did realize from her e-mail that I often read materials that aren't my top priority that way too -in a multi-tasking sort of way, claiming to myself that I'll get back to it more carefully later. My usual excuse for the careless first read and the often-forgotten second read? ''I'm too busy!" 
Believe it or not, being too busy came up in more e-mails I received than any other single topic; yes, even more often than sex. Most people talk about how busy they are while bemoaning the fact; you may even know (as I do) some people who are downright whiny about how high they have climbed on the "busy-meter." Maybe you've been a busy 
'Busy' is no excuse 
whiner yourself (as I have). 

I would like to propose that being busy -even being too busy-has the potential to be a very good thing. Your schedule, and your attitude toward the way you spend your time, tells you exactly what your real priorities are, no mat­ter what you say they are. A former teacher cifmine used to say that you can tell what a person values by looking in their checkbook register, though I suppose now she would have to say their debit card record. I say you can also tell by looking at someone's calendar. There's a level of honesty present in how you spend your time that you cannot deny. 
For most of us, one main demand, usually our chosen vocation or profession, takes up the bulk of our time. Whether we would consider being "student" or "faculty," "rector" or "staff member" or "parent" our main responsi­bility, we must give that aspect of our lives many hours each day. However, that one aspect of life isn't usually what puts us over the edge into the zone of the "too busy." Come on-even the most serious student around here participates in a few other activities outside of class and studying. 
So what do you consider your highest values? What-or who -is most important to you? Does the way you spend your time each day reflect that? Now, you don't necessarily have to spend the most time each day on what's most important to you. You can be very committed to your faith without spending hours each day in prayer and service. You can believe that staying fit and healthy is important without spending the entire afternoon each day in the gym. However, can you really say that your faith means a lot to you ifyou don't take time to pray during the day; ifyou find excuses to miss Mass sometimes; ifyou never participate in the opportunities for service presented through the Center 
LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
A wotnan's view on Plan B 

Editor's note: This letter originally appeared in the Nov. 7 edition of The Observer. but was incorrectly attributed to Shawn Ahmed. 
I would like to add a female voice to the discussion concerning Plan B. In Andrew Rosatostates' Letter to the Editor ("Plan B destroys embryo in some cases," Nov. 3), he writes, "Taking Plan B causes the destruc­tion of a human embryo in those cases where it prevents its implantation." The use of the word "destruction" is a bit strong. If Plan B were a pill full of microscopic men with machetes and machine guns being transported directly to the uterus with the sole purpose of mutilating a fertilized egg, then "destruction" might be appropriate. But from my understanding, that is not the case. 
Emergency contraceptives are to be used in case of an emergency (what a concept). Condoms fail. The pill fails. Furthermore, aren't those also ways of preventing preg­nancy? Plan B is the second choice to pre­venting pregnancies when previous efforts break or when your mother-in-law manipu­lates your birth control pill a la Desperate Housewives. 
The distributors of Plan B do not deny the possibility of preventing the implantation of an embryo in the uterus, therefore neither will I. They do, however, confess that there is no evidence proving that Plan B will harm the fetus (nor the woman, but she's usually not the issue in these arguments) during early pregnancy. You see, friends, an embryo is not a pregnancy until it is implanted in the uterus. An abortifacient is something that terminates a pregnancy, not something that prevents an embryo from attaching to the uterus. 
So, riddle me this: Doesn't every embryo have the same possibility of not implanting, with or without the super dose of hor­mones? 
Pregnancy is such a fickle thing; some­times it lasts nine months, sometimes it doesn't. When attacking Plan B, please keep in mind that the Food and Drug Administration and the manufacturers of Plan B are required to state that it may pre­vent implantation. There is no indisputable video evidence for either side, thus the call on the field must stand. This is the same FDA that has to warn you that your Viagra may cause blindness. But, then again, what do I know? I'm just a woman and it's just my body. 
Renee Woodward junior Saint Mary's Nov. 3 
for Social.Concerns? Can you really say that you value your health ifyou rarely-or never-make the time to exer­cise? Ifyou're always "too busy" to do something you say you really value, then face it. You just don't value that thing as much as you claim to. 
My husband has a rule of thumb for whenever either of us is asked to commit our time to anything new. Whenever we say "yes" to something new, he reminds me, we have to drop an existing activity to make room for it. His policy is a good one, in part because we're both busy, but also because it forces us to prioritize. How much do we want to say "yes" to this new opportunity? Enough to drop some­thing we're already doing? When we follow his plan we stay out of the trap of mindlessly saying yes just because it sounds good to us, or because (the slyest trap of all) we're flattered to be asked. Saying "yes" in this way keeps me attentive to the fact that really, whenever we say yes to something, we're saying no to something else. Even in our multi-multi-tasking society, we must make choices. Those choices give a much more honest accounting of our true priorities than what we claim to hold dear. 
ln any environment filled with successful people, as Notre Dame is, a person's level of busy-ness can often become (falsely) equated with how important or how valuable they are. Don't be fooled. God knows how priceless each one of us is and wants us to use the precious gift of each day with wisdom and love -and probably not at breakneck speed.

Rethink definitions 

Ignorance can be bliss, but misinformation is scarring. There have been many opinions given on the ethics of the "Plan B" emergency contraceptive pill, but it seems moral thought keeps slipping through the cracks, as shown by the view given in "A woman's view on Plan B." The main view given by this submis­sion was that Plan B does not cause abortions since the embryo .never implants on the uterine wall, which is the medical defini­tion of pregnancy. Yet, definitions can be very misleading things. 
Until very recently in human history, life was not thought to begin until a child emerged from its mother's womb. Presently, however, a premature fetus can be taken fr_om its mother and with modern technology can survive at an age that never would have been possible before. When dealing with medical defini­tions, a person must use caution and not accept everything on faith. With this said, the only non-arbitrary point in a child's development where life can be said to begin is conception. Furthermore, Plan B does actively prevent an embryo from implanting by changing the makeup of the uterine wall, contrary to what was said in that Viewpoint letter. 
Finally, also unlike Woodward's Letter to the Editor, if a drug even has the most remote possibility of ending a human life, in this case the embryo, then deference must be given to that life, whatever the chances.

Dems must enact change 
In 2004, after receiving 51 percent of the vote, President Bush ran wild and declared a mandate. Tuesday, the American people spoke and repudiated that mandate, spanking Bush back into reality.

Cardinal According to CNN.com exit polls, 62 percent of voters said that national issues mattered more than local issues this year. Angry voters made their voices heard, shouting from the polls their extreme displeasure with the war in Iraq,

The results show Americans are sick of one-party rule and wish to restore the system of checks and balances on which the U.S. Constitution was founded. 
Democrats, swept into power in the House, and maybe the Senate, by complaining and promising change, must now prove they deserve their new position oflegislative clout. The do-nothing Congress must finally do something, and we believe they will. 
U.S. Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., promised to drain the GOP "swamp" in her first 100 hours as speaker of the House. She plans to introduce legislation to decrease the influence of lobbyists, enact all of the recommendations from the 9/11 Commission, raise the minimum wage, cut interest rates on student loans, lower prescription drug prices and help advance federal funding of stem cell research. 
Most importantly, Democrats must introduce plans for the war in Iraq. We cannot remain stuck in the quagmire that is Iraq, but we also cannot withdraw all troops immediately. We need to draw up some type of exit strate­gy that will keep the peace and get us out of there. After years of clainling they can do better, the onus is on Democrats. 
One thing is for certain: Congress has put down the rub­ber stamp and the American people are better off for it.

DPAC SPOTLIGHT 

Cinematic Holocaust 
DPAC series to focus on films about 20th century tragedy 



By MARTY SCHROEDER Assistant Scene Editor 
Beginning today, the DeBartolo Performing Arts Center (DPAC) will host the film series, "Through the Eyes of Children: A Holocaust Film Series." The series examines perhaps the most tragic event of the 20th century through the eyes of those affected the most: the children who had to hide from -and, in some cases, confront -the horrors of the Nazi "fmal solution." 
The films selected depict children who were "plucked from their homes and stripped of their childhoods, the children had witnessed the murder of parents, sib­lings, and relatives," reads a release from the film, television and theatre depart­ment, which is hosting the event. "They faced starvation, illness and brutal labor, until they were consigned to the gas cham­bers." 
An exploration of the guiltless in a period of history fraught with guilt, crime and shame, this series will be an emotional and analytical event. How the lives of the chil­dren were changed and how modern audi­ences view their situations will be two of the multiple issues presented during this series. The films slated for screening include: 
Fateless (2005) 
Directed by Lajos Koltai, this recent film uses black and white, sepia and color film to explore the differing moods and situa­tions of Gyorgy Koves, the 14-year-old son of a Budapest merchant. Based on the novel by Nobel laureate lmre Kertesz, it tells the story of a youth who comes of age in Buchenwald learning how to maintain dignity in the face of complete hatred and oppression while dealing with his own growing hated. "Fateless" is a tapestry of the human emotions present in the chil­dren forced into the concentration camps. 
Everything is Illuminated (2005) 
Starring Elijah Wood and directed by Uev Schreiber, "Everything is Illuminated" is different from the other films in the series in that it does not take place during the Holocaust. Wood plays .Jonathan Safran Foer, a Jewish Ameriean who trav­els to Ukraine to find the woman who helped his grandfather flee Europe during World War II. 
Part comedy, albeit more drama, this film paints a somewhat fantastical world based in the teenage mind of Foer. However, some critics claim this only strengthens the emotional impact. Based on the eponymous novel, this film is not quite as ambitious as its source material but still succeeds in its own right. 
Come and See (1985) 
Directed by Elim Klimov, "Come and See" is, according to its press material, "a brutal condemnation of war." When a 12­year-old enlists in the Russian resistance to the Nazi invasion, his initial beliefs of bat­tlefield glory and fighting for his homeland soon become images of horror and terror when his family is slain and the reality of war sets in. While countless films have been made from the U.S. standpoint, exploring World War II from the Russian viewpoint is not something American audi­ences are used to seeing. A film from the perspective of the Eastern Front, which betrays the images of heroism and glory commonly associated with World War II films, is a perspective worth seeing. 

Au Revoir Les Enfants (Goodbye Children) (1987) 
At a French boarding school in Vichy France, two boys become friends -one Catholic, the other Jewish. Based on the childhood experiences of director Louis Malle, this microcosm of stories about Christians hiding and giving new identities to Jews during World War II is as moving as it is exploratory of the relationship between the two religions. While the Vatican is often condemned for its inaction, many Christians tried -successfully or unsuccessfully -to hide .Jews from the Gestapo. As the Catholic boy befriends his .Jewish classmate, the Catholic comes to realize what it means to be .Jewish during this period of history. 
Into the Arms of Strangers (2000) 
The only documentary in the film series, "Into the Arms of Strangers" explores the story of 10,000 Jewish children rescued from Germany, Austria and then­Czechoslovakia on the eve of the Holocaust. Directed by Mark .Jonathan Harris and narrated by Judi Deneb, it promises to give a more historical view of World War II and its impact on Jews, specifically Jewish children. The "kinder­transport" which saved these children was a type of underground railroad bringing .Jewish children from their home country to Great Britain where they lived through the duration of the war. It uses archival footage and interviews to tell the stories of the thousands saved. 
Europa, Europa (1990) 

"Europa, Europa" is based on the life of Solomon Perel, a Jew who hid his religious identity by joining the Hitler Youth to save his life. The film is based on Perel's autobi­ography and directed by Agnieszka Holland. Also written by Holland, it was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Writing Adapted Screenplay. Most of the film takes place on the Eastern front, so the German/Russian interplay, ignored in American cinema, plays an important role. This film also focuses on the Jewish situa­tion after the war and the Jews' mass migration to the British Mandate, which would become Israel in 1948. 
"Through the Eyes of Children" will be an important film series for the study of the Holocaust at Notre Dame. It brings in narrative film from Europeans only one or two generations removed from the horrors that plagued the European continent less than 70 years ago. Perhaps most impor­tantly, it includes perspectives from American Jews with all-too-fresh memo­ries of the time period. 
Exploring the Holocaust across national, religious and generational divides, the series reminds us lessons learned from the Holocaust are ones that should not be soon forgotten.

SAINT MARY'S SPOTLIGHT 
Celebrating Wendy, Saint Mary's style 
College to host humorous show honoring late playwright 


By MANDY STIRONE Scene Writer 
What started with a heartfelt expres­sion of regret for Wendy Wasserstein's untimely death in January of 2006 ulti­mately became a side-splitting selection of one-act plays by the late writer. Professor Katie Sullivan of the Saint Mary's Theatre Department has created a commemoration of Wasserstein shows, which will be shown in the· Moreau Theater at St. Mary's from tonight until Saturday. The show, called "Celebrating Wendy," shows off the ver­satility of the actors and the depth and variation of Wasserstein's imagination through her plays. 
Wasserstein's plays, all published together in 1999, ranged from a fantasy that included Wasserstein herself meet­ing her idol Bette Midler, to a little girl fighting with her father, to the re-writ­ing of a famous Greek Tragedy. They spanned decades and portrayed many types of women and men in various sce­narios. 
The various plays used a very "RENT" -like set in which various props were used as other parts of the scenery, as well as a similar small cast of actors playing several parts instead of an actor for each individual part. Costumes were unique and sometimes very glitzy. The tongue-in-cheek jokes and subtle humor all reflect Wasserstein's sense of humor and sarcasm. 
Full of song and dance, the cast and crew glides through the various plays with style and wit. After Sullivan's opening speech, a very ruffled looking Wasserstein, played by Christina Kloess, rushes on stage to begin the show. She and Bette, played by Monica Mastracco, grace the stage in-between each play, with Bette breaking into song each time, sometimes with Wendy accompanying her. They are also joined, in two instances, by a chorus, once only three girls, and finally with the entire cast. 
The one-acts begin then with "Boy meets Girl," narrated onstage by Bill Svelmoe and Lauren Mangiaforte. It tells the tale of two thirty-somethings, portrayed by Emily Rose Zandstra and Michael Girts, who become a couple. The sarcastic word play reflects the conflict between what the characters really feel and what they actually tell each other. It also relies on stereotypi­cal statements and mockery of psychia­try and dating. By far the funniest char­acter in this play is the Queen Leona Hamsley, played by Amanda Ann Goetz, who is the celebrant at the couple's wedding. 
After another shot of Wendy and Bette's day together a young ballerina and her father, portrayed by Caroline Walker and Louis MacKenzie, duke it out in a stereotypical father-daughter fight of the 90's and eventually make up in "Tender Offer. " 
Bette and Wendy sing a beloved Disney song before the audience views a couple from a time when women rid­ing bicycles was illegal. Byelinkov, por­trayed by Michael Kramer, is an uptight schoolteacher soon to be married to the flighty, flirty Varinka, played by Victoria Abram-Copenhaver. All the comedy in this skit derives from the obvious differ­ences between them and their ways of dealing with these differences. His rigid nature conflicts with her carefree demeanor in several instances includ­ing the riding of a bicycle and the say­ing of the words, "I love you." Byelinkov supplies the most hilarity here by seem­ing utterly bewildered at everything Varinka says or does. 

Next, a spunky, peppy work out girl, played by Amanda Ann Goetz, shows that there's more to her than what her students see during her class. Talking the whole time she's working out, sometimes to her students whom the audience never sees, her mood goes from light to serious in a few minutes and then she gets up and just keeps on going as if nothing is wrong. 
After a short intermission Bette and Wendy buy some makeup and Emily Rose Zandstra and Michael Girts recite Shakespeare's Sonnet 94 in the opening of "Waiting for Philip Glass." Here the wealthy main characters trade insults in a scene that seems like "The O.C." meets "Sex and the City." A lot of gossip and stress contribute to the absurdity in this scene where Holden, played by Susan Baxter, meets up with her ex­husband, portrayed by Richard Baxter, and his new wife, Rina, played by Ayslinn E. McGovern, at a party she is throwing for Philip Glass, who is late. Everything from Spencer, played by Carline Walker, who has something to say about everyone who comes in, to Holden's mini break down, fits in well with the wealthy, fake air the scene shows. 
By far, the funniest scene in the pro­duction, "Medea" is re-written, and hilarity ensues. Medea, played by Kelly Lynn Plush, introduces herself and com­plains of the lack of women's roles before the scene even starts. Between her intentional over-acting, and a cho­rus, played by Victoria Abram­Copenhaver, Shawna Broughton, and Lauren Mangiaforte, who love to throw pop-culture references into their lines, the play was hysterical over all. 
Overall, Wasserstein's one-acts are represented in a well-acted series of plays by a well-prepared group of actors. While the most obvious objective of the plays is humor, a serious side can also been seen in each of the charac­ters, both male and female. Many of them struggle with depression and anx­iety and, though psychiatry is mocked in several scenes, it also seems to be doing the characters some small amount of good. 
Their lives are all affected by whatev­er it is they feel, and even Wasserstein's character experiences uncertainty and feelings of inferiority. Each actor seemed to get his or her character and showed that through their portrayals, which makes "Celebrating Wendy" a worthwhile show, and a strong homage to the late playwright's works.

Amelie Mauresmo will not finish the year as the No. 1 player in the world. That dis­tinction will go to Sharapova or Justine Henin-Hardenne, depending on how they fare in this tournament. 
Sharapova is 2-0 in the round-robin portion, Kuznetsova is 1-0 and Clijsters is 0-1. Also in the Red Group, the seventh-ranked Dementieva is 0-2, including Tuesday's loss to Sharapova, and has little chance of reaching the semifi­nals for the first time. since 2000. 
Kuznetsova can guarantee herself and Sharapova a place in the semifinals by beating Clijsters on Thursday. 
After the 19­
year-old Russian 
saved three break points in the fourth game of the second set, she took away the momentum from Clijsters and broke the frustrated Belgian in the next game. 
Sharapova broke Clijsters again in the seventh game, but failed to hold for the first time in the match as Clijsters closed to 5-4. 
Sharapo"¢a saved a double­break point in the 1Oth before her fifth ace clinched the win. 
"I felt like I was moving really well and no matter how big and deep her shots were I still felt like I was in position for them. And that just comes from play­ing a lot of matches," Sharapova said. 
Kuznetsova capitalized on Dementieva's erratic serve. Dementieva broke when trailing 5-3 before holding serve for the first time in four games. But Kuznetsova held and broke Dementieva for the third time to take the first set. 
"I had a lot of chances that I didn't close out in the first set," Kuznetsova said. "I was losing my concentration, but that's normal after a long season." 
Kuznetsova took control of the second set, breaking Dementieva with a forehand winner for a 2-0 lead. She held serve -saving four break points -and the match went to serve until a netted backhand by Dementieva sealed it. 
''I'm looking forward to rais­ing my game tomorrow, but today it was enough," Kuznetsova said. 
Hingis stormed to a 4-1 lead in the first set against the fifth­ranked Petrova, who beat Mauresmo on Tuesday. Petrova broke Hingis twice en route to winning the second set. 
But 41 unforced errors cost the Russian. In the deciding set, Hingis broke in the sixth game and sealed the win with a fore­hand pass on her second match point. 
"I wanted to come out here and at least win one after yes­terday's loss, so I'm very happy," Hingis said.

Associated Press SAN DIEGO -The San Diego Padres found their new manager just up the freeway. Bud Black was hired Wednesday to replace Bruce Bochy, giving the Los Angeles Angels' pitch­ing coach his first major league managing job ­and drastically reducing his commute. Black lives in exclusive Rancho Santa Fe just north of San Diego. "Good dude," Tony Gwynn said about his for­mer teammate at San Diego State. "He's been in the game a long time and really warrants this oppor­tunity. I think he'll do 
well." 

Black will be introduced at the Padres' awards ban­quet Thursday night, said a baseball official, speak­ing on condition of anonymity because an announcement hadn't been made. 
Black was not available for comment and Padres executives didn't return calls. 
The 49-year-old Black has been the Angels' pitching coaeh for the last seven seasons, including when they won the World Series in 2002. lie pitehed in the big leagues for 15 seasons, helping the Kansas City Hoyals win the

North Texas parts ways with head football coach 
DENTON -North Texas coach Darrell Dickey was fired Wednesday with the Mean Green already assured their second straight losing season since winning four Sun Belt Conference titles in a row. 
Athletic dirnctor Hick Villarreal said Diekey, who has three years left on his contract, will not return in 2007. Dickey is expected to coach the final three games of the season for North Texas (2-7). 
Dickey became coach in 1998, three years after North Texas movod up to NCM Division 1-A. lie is 41-62 in his ninth season, with a 33-20 conference record. 
"I have made an informed dedsion to seek new leadership for our (()()tball program," Villarreal said. "It's time for North Texas to seek a now head coach to lead our football program to a posi­tion of prominence in the Sun Belt Conference and to a more competitive position at the national level." 
1985 World Series. 
"I think that Buddy's baseball knowledge and ability to communicate have made him so coveted the past couple of years," Angels manager Mike Seioscia said. "He not only has a great understanding of the pitching side, but a grasp of the fundamental side of baseball that every team needs to be success­ful. As an organization, you're always prepared to lose people, as we lost Joe Maddon last year to a managerial job (with Tampa Bay). 
"Buddy has made some big footprints in this organization, and if he 

gets the (San Diego) job, 
they would certainly be big 
shoes to fill." 

Black was one of six 
candidates to interview 
with general manager 
Kevin Towers. Black got a 
second interview on 
Tuesday, with owner John 
Moores and CEO Sandy 
Alderson. 

Dusty Baker, one of the 
leading candidates, said 
he was told Wednesday 
morning that he didn't get 
the job. 

"Life's full of disappoint­
ments some time and you have to deal with them," . said Baker, who formerly managed the Chicago Cubs and San Francisco Giants. 
Brown comes to settlement with Knicks over release 
NEW YOHK-The New York Knicks will pay former coach Larry Brown $18.5 million to settle a dispute over his firing in June, the NBA team's owner, Cab!Hvision Systoms Corp .. said Wednesday. 
The settlement was reaehed Oct. 30, but the Knicks were forbidden to release the amount that the team agreed to pay Brown. Cablevision, whieh owns the Knieks through its Madison Square Garden unit, dis­closed the amount in its third-quarter report filed with the Securities and Exchanw~ Commission. 
Hepresentatives for Brown and the Knieks testified before NBA commis­sioner David Stern for more than 15 hours over two days. A clause in Brown's contract made Stern the final arbiter in case of a dispute, but he got the sides to settle in a decision announced Oct. 30. 
Stern prevented either side from discussing terms of the settlement. 
United's Adu practices with Manchester United 
WASHINGTON -Freddy Adu will get his long-awaited first taste of European club soccer when he prac­tices with Manchester United for two weeks later this month. 
D.C. 
United and MLS have given the teen star permission to join the famous English team starting Nov. 18, three days after he is expe<:ted to play in a U.S. Under-20 national team game against Guatemala in Florida. 

D.C. 
United spokesman Doug Hicks said the practices with Manchester UnitPd will not be a tryout and that Adu's rights remain with MLS. 


"This is a great opportunity for Freddy," Hicks said Wednesday. "We support his decision to seek additional training opportunities in the offsea­son." 
Adu, who became the youngest play­er in MLS history three years ago when he was drafted at age 14, has often stated his desire to play for a European club.

LeCavalier lifts Lightning to overtime win at Penguins 
Nils Ekman registers hat trick in close loss 
Associated Press 
PITTSBURGH -Vincent LeCavalier's goal 2:41 into overtime gave the Tampa Bay Lightning a 4-3 win over the Pittsburgh Penguins on Wednesday night. 
Nils Ekman had a natural hat trick, scoring three straight goals late in the second period for Pittsburgh. The Penguins have gained at least a point in seven of their last eight games. 
LeCavalier had a breakaway on Marc-Andre Fleury after Martin St. Louis found him with a long pass from the Tampa Bay end to near the Pittsburgh blue line. It was the second assist of the game for St. Louis, who has a 10-game point streak. 
Sidney Crosby and Sergei Gonchar each had two assists for the Penguins, who have lost 
five in a row at Mellon Arena to the Lightning. Ekman's goals came at 15:37, 
18:19 and 19:47 of the second period against Tampa Bay goalie Johan Holmqvist. 
The four minutes, 10 seconds between goals represented the shortest period of time for one player to score three goals in Penguins' history. The previous record was held by Lowell MacDonald, who had three in 
4:17 of a 5-2 win against Minnesota on Nov. 13, 1973. 
Dimitry Afanasenkov scored the game's first goal with 6:02 to play in the opening period when he deflected in a shot from the point by Nikita Alexeev from the right circle. 
Brad Richards made it 2-0 Tampa Bay with a power-play goal, his fourth, midway through the second period. While standing in the right­wing corner, Richards attempt­ed a centering pass to Alexeev that was blocked by the Penguins but bounced right back to Richards near the goal mouth. He slammed it past goalie Marc-Andre Fleury. 
Five and a half minutes later, Ekman's first goal made it a 2-1 game when he scored from the slot on a pass from Crosby, who had received the puck in the low right-wing circle during a delayed penalty from Gonchar. 
Ekman's second came 2:42 later when he deflected in a Ryan Whitney shot from the point while standing to the right of Holmqvist while on the power play. 
Rangers 4, Panthers 3 
Michael Nylander scored the only goal in the shootout to lead the New York Rangers to a 
victory  over  Florida  on  
Wednesday night.  
Martin Straka added  two  
power-play  goals  for  the  

Rangers, who improved to 6-2 on the road this season. Blair Betts had the other New York goal. Henrik Lundqvist, return­ing in net for the Rangers after being replaced by Kevin Weekes the last three games, made 37 saves before the shootout. 


Ruslan Salei, Nathan Horton and Jay Bouwmeester scored for the Panthers, who trailed 2­0 midway through the second period. 
But the Panthers were stymied in the shootout by Lundqvist. He stopped Olli Jokinen, Horton and clinched the victory when he blocked Joe Nieuwendyk's backhand attempt on a deke.

Cardinals look to put dent in Knights' armor 
8-0 Louisville takes on 8-0 Rutgers tonight 
Associated Press 
PISCATAWAY -Students camping out. Temporary bleachers to accommodate the overflow crowd. Tickets that usually sell for $28, going for $200 on eBay. 
Rutgers football sure has come a long way in a short time. 
No long ago it was hard to give away tickets to a Scarlet Knights game. Now, seats for Thursday night's battle of unbeatens between the No. 15 Scarlet Knights and No. 3 Louisville are so scarce that even Gov. Jon S. Corzine appealed to athletic director Robert Mulcahy for an extra pair. 
"He said, 'I'm sending a check,'" Mulcahy said. 
The game is being billed as the biggest ever played by the school that was part of the first college football game in 1869. 
"I think it's a reaction that's in many ways almost an over­reaction," Mulcahy said. "They wanted this for so long, the minute they could taste some­thing, it was, 'Boom."' 
It is an understatement to say even the most ardent Rutgers followers probably could not have envisioned this level of hysteria when head coach Greg Schiano took over in 2001 and proceeded to lose 34 of 46 games, including 17 consecu­tive in Big East play. 
The former University of Miami defensive coordinator gradually built a winner out of a progr-am with only three above .500 seasons since 1984. In 2005, Rutgers went to a bowl for the first time since 1978 and this year crashed the Top 25 for the first time in 30 years. 
"When I would sit up here and start talking about how we're going to win this and we're going to build this, I'm sure people would think, 'What's this guy smoking today?'" Schiano said this week. "But the alternative is to sit there and say, 'Well, I don't know, we'll see.' So I think that kind of thinking is what carries you through the tough times, and it gives you a consistency that in the athletics world is hugely important." 

Thursday's game will be the second in consecutive weeks that pits two undefeated Big East teams, after Louisville's 44-34 defeat of then-No. 3 West Virginia last Thursday. The win vaulted Louisville (-0) to third­place in the Bowl Championship Series standings, but detractors still question the conference's strength. 
"What we feel is that we went out on the field and played great football," Louisville coach Bobby Petrino said. "We've played everybody we went up against and did a nice job. Our players here listen and are cer­tainly motivated. We probably need to get (ESPN analyst) Lee Corso to keep talking about us." 
Louisville (8-0) has already entered uncharted territory with its highest ranking and spot in the thick of the national title race. 
A win by Rutgers (8-0) would dash Louisville's title hopes and move the Scarlet Knights into the national championship dis­cussion. 
While Louisville's win over West Virginia is viewed as a defining moment in the pro­gram's history, Rutgers is com­ing into the game off ,one of its worst performances of the sea­son. The Scarlet Knights beat Connecticut 24-13 two Sundays ago with only one offensive touchdown. 
Rutgers is 4-1 against Louisville, but the last meeting was a humiliating for the Knights. 
The Cardinals won 56-5 in Louisville last year and held the Scarlet Knights to nine first downs. 
"You pretty much use it as a positive," Rutgers defensive tackle Ramel Meekins said. "It's in the past and it happened. You take it and you run with it. You take the good and the bad, and you turn the bad into good and make the good even bet­ter." 
Tht; Louisville offense, aver­aging 492 yards and 39 points per game, will be the toughest test of the season for a Rutgers' defense ranked No. 2 in the country and allowing nine points per game. 
Louisville quarterback Brian Brohm has recovered from a thumb injury this season to lead the Big East in passing and total offense. Schiano put him among the best he has coached against, a group that includes Michael Vick and Kerry Collins. 
Rutgers counters with a rush­ing attack led by sophomore running back Ray Hice, the nation's third-leading rusher with 1,203 yards who is recov­ered from an ankle sprain suf­fered against UConn. Despite losing featured back Michael Bush to a broken leg in the first game of the season, Louisville rushes for 203 yards per game, 10 more than Rutgers.

Tennessee to face off against Baltimore 
Associated Press 
NASHVILLE -Music City has seen this story many times before. A big, popular star nears the end of his run and isn't welcome anymore. Then there's the big comeback, the triumphant return. 
Cue Steve McNair. 
The quarterback Titans fans still believe was done wrong by his team in a painful and ugly separation is coming back to the town. He returns happy, a winner with his new team ­the Baltimore Ravens -and in perfect position to take some revenge. 
"A lot of people say, 'Well, maybe you've lost a step. Maybe you don't have it all anymore,"' McNair said Wednesday in a conference call. 
"When a team is willing to bring you in and put you in as a starter, that lets you know they

team." 
It's not that McNair wasn't wanted after 11 seasons with the Titans' organi­zation. But the Titans wouldn't pay the winningest quarterback in their history $9 million for 2006, with a $23.46 million salary cap hit. Not after draft-
draft about a 
trade, but they couldn't agree on a draft pick for compensation. 
That left McNair, a 2003 NFL co-MVP and the Titans' first since Earl Campbell, in limbo for months until the trade on June 8, and forced to play catch-up after the trade. 
The chance to play in another Super Bowl in Baltimore helped ease the disappointment, and McNair now says change can be good -sometimes. 
"When one door (closes), another one opens. I'm just glad to get this opportunity to fur­ther my career," McNair said. 
Billick doesn't see MeN air harboring any ill will. 
"He's had nothing but good things to say about the Titans, the organization and everyone there, both publicly and pri­vately," Billick said. 
The question is how will he be greeted Sunday? This game was the second-fastest sellout when single-game tickets went on sale in July. McNair isn't sure if he will hear boos, cheers or a mixture of both. 
Titans linebacker Keith Bulluck predicts cheering, con­sidering McNair was playing for Tennessee last season and the consensus among fans who are unhappy with how he was treated. 
"Definitely, everybody's look­ing forward to Steve coming back," he said. 
McNair earned his share of cheers in January 2000 for driving the Titans down the field before coming a yard short of possibly forcing the first overtime in Super Bowl history. He almost singlehandedly led them to 11 victories in 12 games and a second AFC cham­pionship appearance after a 1-4 start in 2002. 
And it was McNair, limping with a cracked bone spur, who barely came up short in the playoffs at New England in January 2004 after being voted co-MVP of the league. 
"Oh man, they're going to love him," Young said. "It's going .to be way different than when T.O. went back to Philadelphia." 
McNair said this will be another game. Cornerback Samari Rolle, who went through this reunion last year after being cut by the Titans and signing with Baltimore, doesn't agree. 
"I think he's going to treat it like one of the biggest games of his career because of how he was handled and how much he meant to the organization," Rolle said. "I think it will defi­nitely be emotional for him." 
And a much better exit than McNair got in June.

"Nash and Scott give you two body types that we haven't had hero a lot of," Brey said. "I think that helps

Notes: 
+ Broy addressed the cur­rnnt situation regarding team captains before practice Wndnesday. The Irish coach, who usually names his cap­tains bnl'oro thn l'irst game of tho season, is in no rush this year dun to the team's chom­istry. 
"Given how this group is kind of' devoloping before my vn ry eyes, I'v1) kind of' just held off to evaluate it. and rnally havnn 't oven put it to a vote ynt," Brny said. "I may not 1wnn put it to a vote beforn the first game." 
Brey said in tho past he has held a team vote and required that playnrs submit a short essay describing why they nominated a certain player for team captain. And while Brey has benn pleasnd with the leadership of senior guards Colin Falls and Hussell Carter, as well as junior forward Hob Kurz, he still wants to wait. 
"I think I almost want this group to kind of be together longer and then we'll vote," Brey said. "And we may vote aftnr the (preseason) NIT, and we may vote at Christmas. I'm just kind of reading it, just taking a little bit different tone with this group."

!In. 

Frank said Nwankwo's other top option was Florida, where the lineman's sister goes to school. 
"It would have been kind of an easier choice for him to go to Florida," Frank said. 
But Notre Dame's academic prestige, he said, helped nab the coveted Nwankwo. 
"He moves very well for a guard," Frank said. "And he blocks very well in run-lock­ing and pass blocking, which is something you don't often see. 
"lie's a very, very good ath­lete. A big man who can move very wnll." 
Nwankwo's 40-yard dash time is listed at 5.20 seconds, and Frank said he is a light­footed lineman. 
"It's important because Notre Dame had only one offensive line commitment," Frank said. "And I know they want at least four." 
The only other Irish offen­sive line commitment for next year is 6-foot-5, 2H5-pound tackle Andrew Nuss of Ashburn, Va. (Stone Bridge lligh School). 
Wide receiver Aurelius Benn of Washington, D.C. (Dunbar Iligh School) and linebacker Greg Little of Durham, N.C. (Hillside High School) are both expected to announce their decisions today. 
Frank said he expected Little to eommit to Notre Dame but Benn to go else­where. 
Other than Notre Dame, Benn is interested in Illinois, Maryland and Florida State, with Ron Zook's Illini consid­ered most likely to land the nation's top wide out recruit. 
"You'll see guys starting to trickle in now, I think," Frank said.

Before coming to Notre Dame in 2005, Kubinski, 36, spent a year-and-a-half as an assistant coach for the Duke men's and women's teams. There, he· worked under Duke Golf Club general manager Ed Ibarguen, also a top-1 00 teacher. 
Kubinski also attributes much of his success to the opportunity to work for two Hall of Fame coaches, Duke men's coach Rod Myers and women's coach Dan Brooks. Myers and Brooks have won a combined four NCAA national championships. 
"Each of those men were outstanding mentors and influ­enced my teaching tremen­dously," Kubinski said. "Working with each of them, I picked up things that I incorpo­rated into my own teaching style." 
In his first two full seasons at Notre Dame, Kubinski has led the Irish to consecutive Big East Conference titles and NCAA regional berths. He has also amassed three tourna­ment victories, 10 top-five fin­ishes and 12 wins over top-25 opponents _during his short tenure. Under Kubinski's guid­ance, Notre Dame set a school record last season with a 
292.97 stroke average. 
Senior co-captain Cole Isban calls Kubinski's approach to practicing one of the coach's best assets. 
"He has done a lot of great things for us on a mental scale," Isban said. "The ideas and drills used in practice have definitely improved since he got here." 
Isban also noted that Kubinski has worked hard to improve the swings of several of the freshmen on this year's team. 
The GOLF Magazine Top 100 selections will be announced later this month. Many of the instructors on the list are mainstays, which makes it dif­ficult for new teachers to crack the list. 
Kubinski is happy that the list sends a positive message to coaches around the country. 
"Regardless of how the final voting comes out, I think the fact that we're talking about teaching is exciting," Kubinski said. "Too many times, coaches focus on wins and losses and scheduling and recruiting and so many other things. It's nice to have this time to reflect on what our real mission is. We're 
here  to  help  our  players  
improve  on  and  off  the  
course."

Mallory will round out the Irish recruit class this season. In her career at McDonogh, she has averaged 19.6 points and

HOROSCOPE 
CELEBRITIES BORN ON TillS DAY: Jack Osbourne, 21; Tara Reid, 31; Parker Posey, 38; Bonnie Raitt, 57 
Happy Birthday: You may have to spend the better part of the upcoming year deciphering how you can best benefit from the changing playing field you are caught up in. Don't 
believe everything you hear and don't be afraid to make changes. Your numbers are I, 15, 24, 25, 33, 38 
ARIES (March 21-April19): Someone is likely to try to put one past you if you aren't careful today. Don't give in to someone because they are persuasive or using emotional blackmail. The more adamant you are about doing things your way, the better. 2 stars 
TAURUS (Aprii20-May 20): Doors will open if you ask for favors. Remembering a past partner will bring something to mind you can use to get what you want now. An emotional reminder will lead to a decision that will alter your personal life. 4 stars 
GEMINI (May 21-June 20): Someone may be a burden or need your help as the day progresses. Someone you live with may try to limit you from doing the things you enjoy. Unusual circumstances will lead to a series of small but important changes. 3 stars 
CANCER (June 21-July 22): You are in a high cycle regarding love, so put time aside to spend with someone special or get out and meet new people. Social events, travel and joining interest groups will all be conducive to love. 4 stars 
LEO (July 23-Aug. 22): Be careful how you handle the ones you love or live with. A surprise attack by someone you thought you could trust will put things in perspective quickly. Uncertainty will result from too little research. 3 stars 
VIRGO (Aug. 23-Sept. 22): Do whatever it takes to talk your way in and out of things. A colleague, peer or even a friend will let you down. A problem at home will lead to change. 2 stars 
LIBRA (Sept. 23-0ct. 22): Conduct business by email or phone rather than in person. A change in career will help you utilize your talents further. An emotional connection can be made with someone older or younger. 5 stars 
SCORPIO (Oct. 23-Nov. 21): Everyone will be demanding and unreasonable today. Keep your wits about you. A lie is likely to be told to get you to do something you shouldn't. Be prepared to ask questions and say no. 3 stars 
SAGITTARIUS (Nov. 22-Dec. 21): Someone is not telling you something you need to know to move forward. A problem with an authority figure, while traveling or dealing with someone who is using his or her experience to manipulate you must be brought to a halt. 3 stars 
CAPRICORN (Dec. 22-Jan. 19): A walk down memory lane should help you come up with an excellent solution to a decision you must make. Someone in a position of authority will give you a hard time if you aren't fully prepared to deal with him or her. 3 stars 
AQUARIUS (Jan. 20-Feb. 18): Socialize but don't take what others say to you as law. Exaggeration can be expected and emotional measures used to lead you in a direction you probably shouldn't go. A different lifestyle may be good for someone else but, for now, stick to what you know. 5 stars 
PISCES (Feb. 19-March 20): Someone you depend on or are close to will not agree with what you want to do today. Financial matters must be addressed. Talk lo whoever is opposing you. 2 stars 
Birthday Baby: You have a drive that is hard to match. You set your sights on what you want and focus until you have mastered your goal. You are competitive, reliable, intelligent and hard to beat.

Coach earns teaching honor 
By FRAN TOLAN Sports Writer 

Irish coach Jim Kubinski has been nominated for GOLF Magazine's 2007 "100 Greatest Teachers" list, compiled annu­ally to honor the best instruc­tors in the game. Kubinski is one of "between four and five hundred" PGA professionals selected as nominees. 
Kubinski, who last week received a letter notifying him of his nomination, said he did not promote his own case for this honor but was very happy to learn he had been selected. 
"I was pretty surprised by it actually," Kubinski said. "It is a neat honor to be mentioned with the best teachers in the country."
