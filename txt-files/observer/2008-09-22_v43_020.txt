trains in Michigan 
Bi-annual exercise held at Fort Custer 
By ROBERT SINGER News Writer 

Army ROTC cadets returned Sunday afternoon from a weekend-long field training exercise at Fort Custer, located just outside. the town of Battle Creek, Mich., according to an e-mail from Cadet Mike Howard. 
The event, held twice a year in the fall and spring, focused on developing skills in three main areas: naviga­tion, combat, and leadership, according to the email. The purpose was to provide the cadets in attendance --46 from Notre Dame, 4 from Saint Mary's and 2 from Holy Cross --with practical expe­rience that reaches beyond the classroom, Howard said. 
"In general, the idea is to improve upon what we do in class, to put meaning behind what we do in class," sopho­more Kyle Hanratty said. "For juniors and seniors, it's a good way to get experience in the field." 
According to Howard, the training exercise will go a long way toward preparing Army ROTC juniors for their Leader Development and Assessment Course next

'The Quad' social network site to debut 
By SARAH MERVOSH 
News Writer 

This week, a new Web site made exclusively for college students and meant to be an enhancement of college life will be launched midweek said Jason Schutzbank, Executive Vice President and Chief Technology Officer of College Tonight Inc. 
The site, which was previ­ously called collegetonight.com, will become thequad.com accord­ing to co-founders Zach Suchin, President and Chief Exeutive Officer of College Tonight Inc., and Schutzbank. 
According to the current Web site, collegetonight.com, the site "promotes actual social interactivity rather than the sedentary lifestyle nearly all 'social networks' relegate its users to behind a physical computer screen. It is what social networking should have evolved into by 2008, but has not." 
The two co-founders said The Quad is a service specifi­cally made to make life easier for other college students. 
"In conceptualizing all these things, these are all things that I've personally gone through and experienced a need for," said Schutzbank. 
Suchin graduated from .Emory University in 2006 and Schutzbank will graduate in 2009. 
"It is not something that was built by a bunch of 40-year­olds in a room," Suchin said.

Sex and free vvill 
I spent a good portion of my Frosh­0 experience listening to talk about how accepting Notre Dame is of peo­ple with di!Terent beliefs. But some­where along the way it was slipped in that if students were caught hav-Sarah Mervosh ing sex, they would be "sepa­rated from the 
News Writer 
Univorsity." 
I almost started 
laughing when I 

heard this. I didn't understand how 
the university could tell us not to do 
something that is completely legal 
and within our rights. 

I now understand that because 
Catholicism does not believe in sex 
before marriage, we are asked to 
respect that belief by abstaining. But 
I define respect as speaking and act­
ing in a way that allows others to live 
their life peacefully. Ilaving sex 
would not interrupt anyone from 
abstaining. 

Furthermore, the Catholic faith does not believe in reincarnation, but the University would never "sepa­rate" my llindu roommate for prac­ticing her beliefs. In fact, the University would encourage her to do so. 
Sex, like faith. is a personal choir:e. And I believe that the University should let us make that choice. 
Disallowing sex is both na"ive and ultimately detrimental. People are going to have sex if they want to have sex and should not be seen as bad people for doing so. 
Not selling forms of birth control on campus is not going to stop people for having sex. It will only make it more likely that a female will get pregnant. 
And this is where it gf~ts weird. The University says we can't have sex. but if a girl gets pregnant. she will not be dismissed. Instead. the University will support lwr. l agree that she does need support. but she could have used it a lot more back when she should have been buying condoms, but couldn't find them on campus. 
I applaud Notre Dame and the Catholic Church's good intentions and their own high morals. But I ask them to accept that we cannot con­trol anyone else. 
What is right for one person might not be right for someone else, and we cannot ask others to abide by our own belief system. We also cannot judge others for having a different belief. After all, wasn't it Jesus who said that he who is without sin may cast the first stone? 
Therefore, we should instead focus on ourselves. It needn't concern you that the couple down the hall is hav­ing sex. Instead, focus on your life and how you can become a better, happier person. We should also sup­port others on the path that they choose to follow. If someone chooses to have sex, they need our support throughout the entire process, not just when things get bad. 
God created sex. God also created free will. I simply ask the University to allow us to exercise this free will, and most importantly, give us your support to learn and grow along the way.

To improve their ability to navigate terrain, cadets were given a set of coordi­nates to find with only the aid of a compass, map and their ability to memorize landmarks and count their steps -or in ROTC jargon, "terrain association and pace count," Staff Sergeant Greg Abbracciamento said. 
"The most c·hallenging part of it was that there wasn't much visibility dur­ing the land navigation por­tion of it," said sophomore cadet Colin Raymond. 
To simulate the unpre­dictability of combat, cadets practiced carrying out mis­sions that could randomly unfold in various ways, according to Howard's email. 
Abbracciamento explained these combat scenarios. 
"All the missions have contingencies. For example, during one leg, we were ordered to execute a recon mission. Instead of just observing, we were ambushed, and the enemy threatened to kill the POW. That required a lot of nego­tiation on the part our squad leaders," he said. 
Abbracciamento also described one of the drills designed to foster teamwork and leadership. Known as "leader reaction courses," these drills put cadets from each class in charge of lead­ing their squad through an obstacle course, he said.

U.S. soldier accused of killing Iraqi 
CAMP SPEICHER, Iraq-Military prosecu­tors accused a U.S. soldier Sunday of taking an Iraqi detainee to a remote desert location, stripping him naked, shooting him in the head and chest and then watching as anoth­er soldier set fire to the body with an incen­diary grenade. 
The allegations were made at the opening hearing to determine whether there is enough evidence against 1st Lt. Michael C. Behenna for a court-martial. He has already been charged with premeditated murder of his prisoner, Ali Mansour Mohammed. Prosecutors also accuse Behenna of trying to cover up the killing. 
Iran cautions against attacks 
TEHRAN -Hard-line Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad warned Sunday the military would strike back against anyone tar­geting his· country's nuclear facilities, during a parade featuring a banner calling for the end of Israel. 
The military parade displayed various types of Iranian-made missiles, such as Shahab-3 and Ghadr, and included a truck carrying a huge banner saying "Israel should be eliminated from the universe" in both English and Farsi. 
"If anyone allows himself to commit even a tiny offense against Iran's legitimate interests, borders and sacred land, our armed forces will break his hand before he pulls the trigger," Ahmadinejad said during the parade. 
The phrase "legitimate interests" is Iranian parlance for the country's nuclear program, which the West says is a cover for developing nuclear weapons. Iran, which denies the charge, already is under three sets of sanctions by the U.N. Security Council over the issue.

She went to perhaps the easiest place in Florida to get a large Republican turnout, stuck mostly to the themes she's hit since the Republican convention and took no questions from reporters or the crowd. 
But she was welcomed like a star, with tens of thousands cramming into a plaza and nearby streets in this enormous retirement community about an hour north of Orlando. Some waited more than five hours in 92­degree heat to see her speak for 23 minutes.

Obama will head to Florida to prepare for Friday's event at the University of Mississippi. 
If Obama can hold his own on foreign policy, it could ease those worries, aides said Sunday as they tried to lower expectations for the first-term Illinois senator.

Explosion at Pakistani Marriott kills more than 50; no group claims responsibility 
Associated Press 
ISLAMABAD -Taliban militants based near the Afghan border and their al­Qaida allies are the most likely suspects behind a massive truck bombing at Islamabad's Marriott Hotel, officials and experts said Sunday. At least 53 died in the explosion, including two 
U.S. Defense Department employees and the Czech ambassador. 
The truck sat burning and disabled at the hotel gate for at least 3 1/2 minutes as nervous guards tried to douse the flames before they, the truck and much of the hotel forecourt vanished in a fearsome fireball on Saturday night, according to dramatic surveillance footage released Sunday. 
The attack on the American hotel chain during Ramadan, among the dead­liest terrorist strikes in Pakistan, will test the resolve of its pro-Western civilian rulers to crack down on growing violent extrem­ism which many here blame on the country's role in the U.S.-led war on terror. 
While no group has claimed responsibility, the scale of the blast and its high-profile target were seen by many as the signa­ture of media-savvy al­Qaida.

Aller securing $10 million from the estate of Helen Kellogg, Hesburgh and Joyce fimnded the institute that would eventually develop into one of the leaders in researching world peace. 
"They now have over a $100 million endowment. I think it's the best institute of its kind in the world," llesburgh said. "That's the kind of' thing a Catholic uni­versity ought to do. And we have wonderful people running these institutes and participating in the research, so 1 can't think of any­thing more fitting for a Catholic university to do than to work for world peace." 
The matching prize to Fundaei6n Colombia Presente was presented by Rodrigo Calderon, vice president of public affairs and communications for Coca-Cola Latin America. 
Calderon said the organization played in major role in helping Colombia establish a more demo­cratic society. 
"It is in this context that Fundaci6n Colombia Presente was created in 1993, and it has reformed Colombian society by raising the awareness of social needs," he said. "It is my great pleasure to hand this year's grant to l<undaci6n Colombia Presente."

The three-mile course went in front of main build­ing, along main quad, and finished in front of Hesburgh Library. For the first time this year, the six-mile course, instead of doing two laps on the three-mile route, ventured east along Twyckenham and Edison roads. "I wanted to experi­ence the challenge of the Domer Run," sophomore Andrew Mrugala said. Having never run six miles consecutively before, Mrugala said he entertained him­self by "singing the fight song over and over again in my head." 
Sophomore Chris Harvan partic­ipated in the three mile run this year. 
lle said he ran because "it:; for a good cause and I had participated last year," and he wanted to "just go out and have an enjoyable run with friend<>. really." 
After completing the run or walk, participants were given a complimentary pancake break­fast, courtesy of Legends. and T­shirl'i, Walker said. Traditionally, the Domer Hun t-shirt features "a view of the dome and a represen­tation of running," said Walker. This year's white, gold and teal shirl'i fulfilled the practice.

IN BRIEF 
Tests find chemicals in Nestle milk 
HONG KONG -The Hong Kong government says its tests have found melamine in Chinese­made Nestle brand milk. 
The government said late Sunday it found the industrial chemical in Nestle's Dairy Farm brand pure milk for catering use. It said the milk was made by Nestle's division in the Chinese coastal city Qingdao. 
But the statement said the tests only found a small amount of melamine and that the milk does not pose a serious health risk. 
It recommended, however, the milk not be fed to young children. 
More than 6,200 infants have become sick and four babies have died in China after being fed melamine-laced baby formula. One toddler has become sick in Hong Kong -the first vic­tim reported outside the Chinese mainland. 
Bush pushes for Colwnbian trade deal 
WASHINGTON -President Bush and Colombian President Alvaro Uribe renewed their push on Saturday for Congress to approve a free-trade deal before lawmakers leave town to campaign for re-election. 
"It's in our economic interest that we continue to open up markets in our neighborhood, partic­ularly with a nation that is growing like yours," Bush told Uribe in the Rose Garden. "And yet we can't get a vote out of Congress. I've been asking the Democrat leadership in Congress for a vote, and they've consistently blocked the vote." 
Congressional Democrats say they are delay­ing votes on trade deals involving Colombia, Panama and South Korea until the Bush admin­istration resolves questions about the impact on 
U.S. jobs and other issues. But time is running out on the legislative calendar. The Colombian pact was negotiated in late 2006. 
Bush urged lawmakers to reconsider their opposition, but seemed resigned that it might not happen on his watch. Bush called Uribe an "honest man" who has responded to U.S. con­cerns about crime in Colombia and has been successful in reducing homicides, kidnappings and terrorist attacks. 

Bailout excludes household help 
Paulson resists provison to aid individuals, calls for 'clean and quick' action 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson is resisting a Democratic push to add additional help for house­holds to the $700 billion bailout bill. 
Paulson said Sunday that because financial markets remain under severe stress there is an urgent need for Congress to act quickly without adding other measures that could slow down passage. 
"We need this to be clean and to be quick," Paulson said in an inter­view on ABC's "This Week." 
Paulson resisted sug­gestions being made by Democrats that the pro­gram be. changed to include further relief for homeowners facing mort­gage foreclosures and to include an additional $50 billion stimulus effort. Some Democrats have also suggested capping compensation of execu­tives at firms who get the bailout help. 
Paulson said he was concerned that debate over adding all of those proposals would slow the economy down, delaying the rescue effort that is so urgently needed to get financial markets moving again. 
"The biggest help we can give the American people right now is to stabilize the financial system," Paulson said. 
However, Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said that he believed there would be changes to the three-page Paulson plan and that agreement could be reached quickly. 
Schumer said that he was pushing to get a pro­vision where the govern­ment would receive stock warrants in return for the bailout relief and for creation of a government oversight board to super­vise the huge operation, which under Paulson's 


AP Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson appeared on several Sunday talk shows to discuss the finance crisis. He is shown here on "Fox News Sunday." 
plan would be run out of the Treasury Department. He said Paulson seemed receptive to changes when he had discussed his ideas with him. 
"I have told him ... we need changes related to housing, we need to put the taxpayer first ahead of bondholders, share­holders," Schumer said on "Fox News Sunday." 
Paulson said in the interviews that he had been talking to other gov­ernments about the need for them to offer similar relief because the current financial crisis is global. 
"The credit markets are still very fragile right now and frozen," Paulson 

said in an interview on NBC's Meet the Press. "We need to deal with this and deal with it quickly." 
Paulson said that the nation's outdated regula­tory system for financial markets must be over­hauled but the first job is to get the most sweeping rescue package since the Great Depression passed by Congress in coming days. 
Paulson made the rounds of the television talk shows on Sunday to stress the need for speed in getting the bailout package approved. The administration was nego­tiating the details of the proposal with members of Congress with the expectation that it can be passed in the next week. 
Paulson said that "it pains me tremendously to have the American tax­payer put in this position but it is better than the alternative." 
Both Paulson and President Bush have argued that the alterna­tive would be credit mar­kets that remain frozen, meaning that businesses will fail because they can't get the loans they need to operate and the economy will grind to a halt because consumers won't be able to get loans to make the purchases that keep the economy moving forward. 


Judge: Lehman can sell units to Barclays 
Associated Press 

NEW YORK -A bankruptcy judge decided early Saturday that Lehman Brothers can sell its investment banking and trading businesses to Barclays, the first major step to-wind down the nation's fourth-largest investment bank. 
U.S. Bankruptcy Judge James Peck gave his decision in a courtroom packed with lawyers at the end of an eight-hour hearing that extended into the wee hours, capping a week of financial turmoil. 
The deal was said to be worth $1.75 billion earlier in the week but the value was in flux after lawyers announced changes to the terms on Friday. It may now be worth closer to $1.35 billion, which includes the $960 million price tag on Lehman's Midtown Manhattan office tower. 
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. filed the biggest bankruptcy in U.S. history Monday, after Barclays PLC declined to buy the investment bank in its entirety. 
The British bank will take control of Lehman units that employ about 9,000 employees in the U.S. 
"Not only is the sale a good match economically, but it will save the jobs of thousands of employees," said Lehman lawyer Harvey Miller of Weil, Gotshal & Manges. 
Barclays took on a potential liabili­ty of $2.5 billion to be paid as sever­ance, in case it decides not to keep certain Lehman employees beyond the guaranteed 90 days. But observers have said Barclays' main reason for acquiring Lehman is to get its peopl~ and presence in North America, making widespread layoffs less likely. 
"It's unimaginable to me that they can run the business without peo­ple," said Lehman's financial adviser, Barry Ridings, of Lazard Ltd. 
Barclays had little competition to land the deal. 
Miller said that before it filed for bankruptcy, Lehman had negotiated with just one other bidder, Bank of America Corp. BofA instead announced Monday that it would buy Merrill Lynch & Co., saving it from a fate similar to Lehman's. That deal was originally valued at $50 billion.

Derheimer disagreed and felt that the team's performance against the Spartans left him with less to antieipate from the rest of the season. 
"I guess it takes the anxiety out of [the rest of the season]. I don't have to hang on every play ... I ean relax now and enjoy the that the atmosphere was upbeat before the game started and got a lot quieter as the game pro­gressed. 

"The mood just went downhill and everybody just got real quiet the rest of the game. There was also kind of an aspect where I felt like the crowd was still trying to get the team back in it," she said. Erdle said that the crowd's confi­dence was high after the first touchdown. 
Erdle said that the game was like they didn't see too much," she said. 

Erdle said that she knew that the game would be close so that the results were not "all that sur­prising." 
"Overall it was a lot of fun, I just wish the game could have been a little better," she said.

"It was pretty promising when it was 13-7. Then it got a lot qui­eter in our section," Janesheski said. 
Janesheski attended the Alumni Association's tailgate before the game and said she enjoyed the camaraderie between the Notre Dame fans, she said. 
"There were a lot more Notn'l Dame fans than I thought there would be," Janesheski said. "You would start talking to other Notre Dame fans even if you had no idea who they were. You could still bond on the fact that you were wearing The Shirt or a Darius Walker jersey," she said. 
Janesheski said she did not encounter any significant prob­lems with MSU fans while at the game. 
"It wasn't as hostile as people made it sound to be before the game, it was just afterward when [MSU fansJ knew they could gloat to us that they started getting unfriendly," Janesheski said.

The Shop, Academics and Greek life, he said. 
These four aspects are essentially "the four ends of the quad," said Suchin. 
"The reason we call it 'The Quad' is because the quad is the heart of the campus at most schools. The quad in this case represents to us the cen­ter of college life," he said. 
The Scene will be the social aspect of The Quad, and is what collegetonight.com used to be, said Suchin. 
It is a place where students can see what their friends are doing or events that are going on in the area, he said. 
The Scene is not meant to replace the popular social net­working site, Facebook.com, he said. 
"We aren't naive. We don't think people are going to leave Facebook and come join another site. I wouldn't do that myself," said Suchin. 
There are problems with Facebook, specifically the Web site's growth to include mem­bers outside of college, he said. 
"Facebook has become something that is much bigger and a lot of ways better for the adult, but not necessarily for the college student," he said. 
The Quad will have new fea­tures and tools that Facebook doesn't provide to members, he said. 
"Let's say, you want to know what the specials are at Steve's Bar and Grill, you could get a text message telling you what it was," he said. 
Junigr Sarah Rodts, who had not heard of The Quad, said she feels that the timing of the Web site's launch is good. 
"They're lucky it's coming out now because everyone· is fed up with Facebook," she said. 
Rod ts said she doesn't like the new Facebook and is inter­ested in "another way to con­nect with people socially." 
Freshman Bobby Abdo thought that the new Web site might have potential, but that it would have to gear towards Notre Dame. 
"If it actually provides a service different from Facebook, more specific to Notre Dame, I'd definitely use it," he said. 
Junior Katie Weber also said that she was fed up with Facebook and that she believes that others are as well. 
"I think people will be really receptive to something differ­ent," she said. 
Other students, like fresh­man Kaye Lushutka, said she felt that students wouldn't want put forth the effort to become familiar with the new Web site. 
''I'm ·already so used to Facebook, so it would be easi­er to use what you're familiar with," she said. ·"It would be more effort to learn how to use the new system. It would save more time just to use what you already know. You already hav~ a good way to talk to peo­ple. 
The academic aspect of the Quad is made to make school­work. especially group work, easier for college students said Schutzbank. 
For example, he said if four students need to work on a PowerPoint project, they can log onto the academic side of the Quad and work on it together and it will edit in real time. 

Group projects aren't always ·the easiest thing to do," said 
Rodts. "if you can get things 
done online, that's awesome." 
The Shop is the retail side of the Web site, whose primary focus is on selling beer pong tables, which are called "quad pong," said Schutzbank. 
"They are pretty durable and yo·u can completely customize them. It is shipped to you with­in two weeks," said Schutzbank. 
A buyer does not need to be 21 years of age to purchase a table, he said. 
"We call them multi-purpose tables so you can use them for anything, but they are regula­tion size beer pong tables," said Schutzbank. 
Lastly, Greek Life focuses on making it easy to keep busi­ness records and create social events for fraternities and sororities, Suchin said.

DNA sheds light on first Americans 
Associated Press 
PAISLEY, Ore. -For some 85 years, homesteaders, pot hunters and archaeologists have been digging at Paisley Caves, a string of shallow depressions washed out of an ancient lava flow by the waves · of a lake that comes and goes with the changing climate. 
Until now, they have found nothing conclusive -arrow­heads, baskets, animal bones and sandals made by people who lived thousands of years ago on the shores of what was then a 40-mile-long lake, but is now a sage brush desert on the northern edge of the Great Basin. 
But a few years ago, University of Oregon archaeol­ogist Dennis Jenkins and his students started digging where no one had dug before. What the team discovered in an alcove used as a latrine and trash dump has elevated the caves to the site of the oldest radiocarbon dated human remains in North America. 
Coprolites -ancient feces ­were found to contain human DNA linked directly to modern­day Native Americans with Asian roots and radiocarbon dated to 14,300 years ago. That's 1,000 years before the oldest stone points of the Clovis culture, which for much of the 20th century was believed to represent the first people in North America. 
The idea that coprolites con­tain valuable information is not new, but extracting DNA from them is. When the find­ings were published this year in the journal Science, they plopped Jenkins and his col­leagues in the middle of one of the hottest debates in North American archaeology: Just when did people first come here, and how did they get here? 
For many years the prevail­ing view was that the Clovis people walked from Siberia across a land bridge exposed by the Ice Age to Alaska and spread south through an ice­free corridor down the center of the continent exposed 10,000 years ago by warming temperatures. 
The Paisley coprolites indi­cate people had found another way, perhaps crossing the land bridge but then walking down the coast, or even crossing the ocean by boat, the way people went from New Guinea to Australia thousands of years earlier. The findings kill the suggestion some of the earliest Americans came from Europe.

Have you ever had anyone just ask you a fully open-ended question other than when professors lay the 11oor open to get you to think for yourself? In that circumstance, you know what the reading was about, you know the general topic of discussion. 
But when you aren't ready, when you're just having a normal conversation with a friend, these are the times that try men's souls ... or okay, maybe their intellects. People's intel­lects.

Talk about the motherload. A gift, yet a challenge. An opportunity where someone wants to shut up and just lis­ten to what you have to say. It's so unique that you have to be a little careful, lest you ramble and never touch upon the points you are actually trying to make (Note: resist the urge to compare such rambling to this article). 
I had no idea how to approach this. How do you put together years of classroom experience, your parents' political views, Internet articles and friends' rants and apply them collec­tively to two candidates, in what is becoming the identifying historic pres­idential election of our generation? Then there's the obligation to be real­istic, but your covert urge to slyly goad their newly-emerged political consciousness to the side of your per­sonal tendencies. I'm admitting the bias to you, beloved reader, only because I am writing on the Viewpoint pages. Otherwise, I'd be a total blank slate like all the other objective jour­nalists. 
After she posed the question, I natu­rally stumbled for a minute (not down the mountain, no worries, bitte), but then I regained my stature and started on a 30-minute question-and-answer session about Conservatives, Liberals, healthcare, environmental policies, the military and financial crises. I quickly became introspective, espe­cially about those basic questions that no one pushes on you when you're at a University -what do I know about the war in Iraq that I wasn't hand-fed by politicians or the media? How can I explain why we need to change our energy infrastructure in two sen­tences? When you start on your famil­iar rant, then someone presses you 

with, "But what will Obama do to 
change that?" and you don't have an 
answer, then aren't you just as unin­
formed as the "uniformed masses" 
about which every political junkie 
complains? 
Someone once told me that for caus­es and ideas that you truly believe in, you should have an "elevator conver­sation" ·prepared. That when someone asks you why you spend the majority of your life devoted to . you should be able to say in 60 seconds why your time spent is worthwhile. You may risk sounding like a broken record, but it's better than being a James Michner book on tape. 
So think about it. If it was a class, you could go home and write it down on an index card. Why are you voting a certain way this fall'? How will your vote better our nation? Platforms are unreliable; promises can easily be bro­ken. Theories, thought processes and political character are accurate repre­sentations of what a candidate might do once in office. Here in Europe, it's easy to see the importance of positive international ties in an increasingly global society. When you're out of the bubble, when you're not in the Ameriean academic universe, there is no presumed knowledge on which you can fall back. You have to really be able to answer those open-ended questions. 
So tell me about your politics.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR Notre Datne not truly a place where ''learning becotnes service to justice'' 
Pope Paul VI, in Populorum Progressio, states that when one gives to the poor, "you are not making a gift of what is yours to the poor man, but you are giving him back what is his. You have been appropriating things that are meant to be for the common use of everyone. The earth belongs to everyone, not to the rich" (par. 23). Hence, when Fr. Jenkins at Wednesday's Town Hall Meeting claimed that "the Catholic mission of Notre Dame should be seen as 'a guide, something that makes the university distinc­tive,"' yet the majority of our campus workers, those who scrub our toilets, desks, floors and dishes still fall under the poverty level or make a wage that is less than livable. How are we "embracing the dignity," as Jenkins says, of our campus workers? When the wage difference between the highest-and lowest-paid employee on campus is 1:49 (Living Wage Report from 2007), how are we working as a family for the com­mon good of everyone? 
Maybe, then, it is time we stop calling "renovations to the Basilica of the Sacred Heart" (John Affieck-Graves) "a hallmark of Notre Dame" and our Catholic character. Maybe it is time we start actually putting into practice what Paul VI commands us as Catholics to do and start handing back to workers at Notre Dame what is truly theirs. 
It is great and commendable that the University has implemented a new program where employees can take classes while employed at the university, but when will we address the deeply rooted social inequal­ities that exist right in our own backyard? When will we, instead of committing ourselves passively and eas­ily to lives of "service to the world," commit ourselves to an active life of change where "learning becomes service to justice" and not passivity? Where we ques­tion why the people who actually serve our community in our dorms, academic buildings and dining halls are standing in line at food banks or in line at grocery stores with food stamps? Or why they sleep on the floor of a basement in a home not their own so they can feed and educate their children? How long are we going to cover up this injustice with sugar-coated words and nice luncheons at the new Irish Green? 
I am a student at this university, I am an employee at this university and I am a member of this family. Hence, I say with great disappointment that I am ashamed of how my family -this university-is liv­ing out what we call "Catholic character." To me, Catholic character is not spending millions repainting the golden dome or refurbishing the basilica, but rather making sure the least among us are dignified and not forgotten or exploited. So until our actions are equivalent with our words, I remain strong in my statement when I say I am ashamed today of my uni­versity, of myself and of my fellow Notre Dame family members for not doing more to genuinely use our voic­es to dispel injustice and implement justice in our own home, our own family and our own university.

Colllpassion the true spirit of Notre Dallle 
When my autistic son was severely depressed, I called on Maura and Charlie Weis for support. My son is a huge Notre Dame fan. His grandfather taught here and I graduated from Notre Dame. When I told my son the new coach and his wife had a special needs daughter named Hannah, he listened. I told him, you need to look at the Hannah and Friends Web site with me. 
The Weis family is going to change our community, especially how people view people with different abilities, as Maura Weis so fondly refers to them. Coach Weis took time out of his hectic schedule, (because his wife asked him to) to boost the morale of a lost autistic young man who was caught in between two worlds. He is so high functioning, that he longed to be that neurotypical honor role student on the high school football team. That autumn day, my son no longer was autistic; he had only abil­ities-to be one-on-one with Coach Charlie Weis, his mentor. 
Yes, I believe they got the right coach to do the job. No doubt in my mind. The University should be proud that some­times it's not always about football or getting the perfect job. It is about edu­cation, compassion, making the world a better place to live, uniting racial differ­ences and educating the poor and the mentally challenged. 
So whether the Irish are up or down on their luck, when you paint your body blue and green or wear the Golden Dome on your head, you are also cele­brating the spirit of a much bigger pic-
EDITORIAL CARTOON 
ture which I believe is what Notre Dame is all about. The Weis' are building a home for our true unsung heroes and heroines, who cannot make a life for themselves, go to college or even some who cannot even wash their own bod­ies. The Weis family is building them a home in which they can grow old and fill their time with fun things to do, sur­rounded by love every day. They will be respected, cared for and celebrated. If you spend time with these gentle souls, you will learn more about God, Heaven and why you are fortunate enough to share the planet with them. They only know love and want to be your friend. Unfortunately, they have learned fear, cruelty and indifference. 
Yes, I believe they got the right Coach to do the job. No doubt in my mind. The true Spirit of the Irish is in helping those who cannot help themselves. One day you may give birth to a Downs baby, or your son or daughter will be confined to a wheelchair from an auto accident. My education from the University of Notre Dame and from my parents helped me deal with what I thought was a tragedy. I educated myself on autism and tried everything possible to help my son make sense of our world. I see what a true blessing my son is. I am honored God chose me to help raise an angel, against the odds. I did win overall.

The opiate of the people 
One of the most frequently quoted statements of Karl Marx is: "Religion is the opiate of the people." 
In context, Marx was speaking of religion as a condition that arose to help humanity cope with its struggles. He believed that calling on mankind to give up religion would mean calling upon them to give up the conditions of life 
that require what he saw as a coping mechanism. 
There is a measure of ambiguity about the usage of
Shane Nassiri 
opium in the statement because in Marx's day, opium was legally available and widely prescribed. Daily In any case, the metaphor of opium can be seen as Toreador Marx's view of religion as being a painkiller and some­thing that dulls the mind.
Texas Tech 
More than a century and a half later, I would like to 
amend Marx's statement to better fit our modern American context: Politics is the opiate of the people. What do I mean? There is this false optimism that somehow our political process will offer 
the cure for all that ails our society. Ifwe only elect the right candidate, we can solve the problems we face. What ensues is mostly an attempt by either candidate to cast the other as a wrong choice that will bring certain doom. 
This year is more of the same. In the end, there are no substantial differ­ences between either John McCain or Barack Obama that will result in any real discernible outcome for the American people. 
You will either get more war in Afghanistan or more war in Iraq. You will either get more spending on expansive government programs or more corpo­rate welfare. Both will push for more regulation on financial institutions without addressing the subsidies and easy credit offered by the government to many of these institutions. Both will offer more aid to countries such as Georgia while aggressively posturing against Russia and Iran. 
The only real division that can be drawn between these candidates is con­cerning social and moral issues, most of which have no business being in the federal domain. That is where people line up to make their stand, fighting for the "heart and soul" of the nation. 
This is the opiate of the people. They are drugged into believing that these are the issues that will guarantee the future vitality of our nation. They are corralled into voting booths to support the candidate that supports their issue, or vote against the candidate that opposes their issue. 
I cannot count the number of times I've talked to Republican-voting people who curse those "liberal Democrats," or how many times I've listened to Democrat-voting people curse the Republican policies. 
The reality is that most people are not Republicans and Democrats; they are anti-Republicans and anti-Democrats, and they vote accordingly. They are convinced by the campaigns not to vote for what they believe in, but to vote against what they do not. 
This is what is passing for democracy in our nation, and the people are dis­tracted by the false feud that exists between the two parties. 
That is not to say that we do not need the voices of Democrats and Republicans, but we do not need them to be our only voices, especially when much of what they are saying is the same. 
Until we can break the stranglehold these two entities have on our politics, we'll never see true "change" in this country. 
It is an uphill battle, for sure, but one that is definitely worth fighting, for the sake of principle, and to "secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity" as our Founding Fathers put it. 
And yet, we still find ourselves taking the opium every election cycle, hop­ing that somehow this dose will do for us what the last dose didn't. Here's to hoping we'llleave the bottle on the shelf the next time around.

RECAP: THE FIRST Two SEASONS OF "HEROES" 
By CAITLIN FERRARO 
Scene Writer 
"Heroes" is a complex science fiction series that incorporates an abundance of unique characters. When "Heroes" premiered in the fall of 2006, ordinary characters were first discovering that they had extraordinary powers. 
Some of these ordinary people chose to ignore their abilities, like Nathan Petrelli (Adrian Pasdar), a politician running for office who can 11y. Others embraced their abilities and sought understanding, like Nathan's younger brother Peter Petrelli (Milo Ventimiglia). Peter is like a sponge, absorbing the powers of those around him. 
Then. there are heroes like Hiro Nakamura (Masi Oka), once a bored office worker who now knows he was meant for something greater. To fulfill his destiny as a hero, he uses his abili­ty to bend space and time. Still others were trying to be normal, like teenage cheerleader Claire Bennet (Hayden Panettiere), who can heal herself even after 'death.' 
This premise soon expanded to pres­ent an intricate mythology surround­ing the genetic mutations that give these individuals superhuman abili­ties. As "Volume 1: Genesis" began, random people across the world were discovering that they had secret abili­ties. Dr. Mohinder Suresh (Sendil Ramamurthy) searched for truth in the scientific work of his father, a geneticist who mapped the superhu­man gene. After his father was killed, Mohinder struggled to understand the secrets he left behind. 
A greater mystery surrounded the characters' lives in the form of 
Linderman (Malcolm McDowell), the leader of a seemingly evil corporation known to the public as the Primatech Paper Company. 
The first season centered on the infamous tagline "Save the cheer­leader. Save the world." Several char­acters worked to prevent Sylar (Zachary Quinto). an evil villain who slices open people's heads in order to steal their powers, from killing Claire. Much of this plotline was fueled by paintings that depicted the future, including one image of the destruction of New York City by bomb. Presumably, if the heroes could save Claire, then they would prevent New York from certain doom. 
Episode 20 in season one was excep­tionally brilliant. Titled "Five Years Gone," it sent I-liro and his best friend Ando (James Kyson Lee) five years into a future in which they failed to stop the bomb. The ramifications of their failure were widespread -­Nathan, now President of the United States, was persecuting people with powers as "terrorists." 
When Claire finally confronted Nathan, he was revealed to be Sylar masquerading as the eldest Petrelli brother. When Peter discovered the deception, an epic confrontation fol­lowed, and the episode concluded with 
· 1-Iiro returning to the past and vowing to kill Sylar. In the season one finale, the heroes banded together against Sylar, who was presumed to be the "bomb" that would blow up New York City. In an uncharacteristic plot twist, Peter, not Sylar, was discovered to be the bomb. When he lost control of his abilities, Nathan flew him into space to save New York, saying, "You saved the cheerleader, so that we could save the

world." This caused Peter's subse­quent amnesia in Season Two, as well as Nathan's depression and alcoholism over the possible death of his brother. 
"Volume Two: Generations" began four months after Peter and Sylar's confrontation in New York. Viewers knew that the heroes were plolting to defeat Sylar and save the world, but the second season quickly became more complicated. A new villain entered the picture, Adam Monroe (David Anders), an immortal man first introduced to viewers in an earlier time-traveling episode. 
In the second season linale, Monroe sought to get his hands on the danger­ous "Shanti virus," which was being held at Primatech Paper. Through an episode foretelling the future, viewers learned that the virus would kill 93 percent of the world's population. Monroe tried to convince the amnesiac Peter to help him gain the virus, but Nathan and another hero, Parkman (Greg Gunberg), foiled his plan. 
Using his powers of teleportation, I-liro buries Monroe alive in a Japanese cemetery-the perfect pun­ishment for the immortal villain. Peter, finally regaining his senses, destroyed the killer virus strain. 
There were various other plotlines in the second season, but few reached their full potential due to the writer's strike last year. 
"Heroes" weaves a complex web of mysteries and surprises, more of which are expected in season three. Before the third season premieres tonight at 9 p.m., a brief recap of sea­sons one and two, including interviews with the cast, will air on NBC.

Tonight, "Heroes, Volume 3: Villains" will make a two-hour debut with reve­lations that will redefine familiar char­acters and potentially shake up the 1mtire series. 
Last season, viewers were left with the attempted assassination of Nathan Petrelli (Adrian Pasdar) as he was about to publidy announce that he, among others, had special "super" abil­ities. The premiere episode, "The Second Coming," picks up right after that tumultuous incident, answering the lingering question: Who shot Nathan? Though fans might be bom­barded with new plot twists when sea­son 3 opens, creator Tim Kring assured viewers that lingering matters from past seasons will be resolved by the second week. After a disappointing sec­ond season, audiences wait in hope that the wonder and fun of the original season will be back tonight. 
Several east members have hinted that some of the individuals we view as "heroes" could be villainous, and vice versa. This season, several characters will struggle with their identities including Peter (Milo Ventimiglia), Sylar (Zachary Quinto), and Mohinder (Sendil Ramamurthy). 
In the second hour of the premiere, "The Buttnr11y Ell'ect," a dozen villains with unimaginable power are unleashed after "the company" is attacked. The heroes are in for a dan­gerous run with these new villains, as cast members have commented that Sylar is hardly the worst of their ene­mies. While much attention will be paid to our original heroes, these twelve new figures will definitely make an impression. 
The additional characters will also have novel, incredible abilities. Expect the mysteries to continue with new per­sonalities like Flint, the German, the Speedster and puppet-master Erie Doyle. 
But have no fear, faithful "Heroes" fans -the main cast will be working together much more this season. 
The duo behind Adult Swim's hit show "Hobot Chicken," actors Seth Green and Breckin Meyer, will guest star this season. Kristen Bell ("Veronica Mars") will resume her role as Elle Bishop, and will most likely appear in

After an award-winning year for their film "No Country for Old Men:" Joel and Ethan Coen have made their return to comedy in "Burn After Reading." The fra­ternal filmmakers have a long history in Hollywood. ranging from dark comedies to more serious projects. 
The Coen brothers have been in the business for more than two decades, but have been interested in film since their youth. Joel got his first shot in the indus­try working in film editing with director Sam Raimi on his film "Evil Dead." From there, with the help of Raimi, the Coens were able to write and direct their own first film, 1984's "Blood Simple." Like many of their future project.'>, "Blood Simple" paid homage to various past films that they enjoyed, combining horror and noir aspects. 
Their next film, 1987's "Raising Arizona," was a comedy starring Nicolas Cage and Holly Hunter. With its comedic timing and unique style, it developed the Coens' style. With outlandish characters and dark entertaining plots, "Raising Arizona" depicted a couple that so des­perate for kids that they kidnapped one. 
The pair's filmmaking careers contin­ued with 1990's "Millers Crossing," a gang-oriented noir. The duo followed that project with 1991's "Barton Fink,'' the 
How do you fit the Coen brothers into a definitive genre? . 
Are their films merely dark satires interjected with a rush of nail-biting sus­pense, or gritty shoek-and-awe thrillers that leave audiences laughing one moment and gasping in shock the next? It seems a grave injustice to even try and fit the Coen brothers' films into a genre, for their work is unlike anything else in the film industry. 
As they have proven time and time again, from the opening scene in "Blood Simple," all the way to the closing moments of "No Country for Old Men," the Coens transcend Hollywood. Their newest film, "Burn After Reading," a return to their Fargo-like brand of cruel, dark humor with ever-elevating momen­tum is no different. 
The question is: is "Burn After

brothers' ode to writer's block. ln "Barton Fink," they further mastered their sense of the bizarre with a brilliant, character­driven storyline chock full of symbolism and allusions to such films as "The Shining" and "Eraserhead." 
The brothers are well known for their classic 1996 film. "Fargo." "Fargo" was a crime thriller with dark comedic ele­ments mostly set in Brainerd, Minn. With · characters ranging from stupid goons to desperate car salesmen, the Coens were once again merciless to the characters they created and effectively created a memorable plot built on their various failures. With "Fargo," the Coens proved themselves to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Collectively the duo received seven Academy Award nominations that year, and the film came home with two Oscars. 
"Fargo" was followed in turn by their most popular comedy, "The Big Lebowski." The story of "The Dude" and his escapades has entertained audiences since the film's release in 1998, earning a permanent place within cult filmdom. 
More recently, the Coens released "0 Brother, Where Art Thou?" a bluegrass­tinged comedy loosely based on the clas­sic Greek myth "The Odyssey," 2003's ''Intolerable Cruelty," a romantic comedy, and "The Ladykillers,'' a remake of a 1955 film. Their most recent success was 2007's "No Country for Old Men," an epic 
as a a thriller veiled as a comedy? 
To say that "Burn After Reading" fea­tures big-name aetors is a vast under­statement. It is in faet a huge A-list vehi­cle starring the likes of George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Tilda Swinton, Coen brothers favorite Frances McDormand, J.K. Simmons and John Malkovic. The plot, which is meticulously crafted, starts when ex-CIA agent Osborne Cox (John Malkovich) loses a CD containing his memoirs. 
Two dimwitted, over-the-top gym employees (Frances McDormand and Brad Pitt) wind up finding the CD and blackmailing Cox tor it. To make matters worse for Cox, his wife (Tilda Swinton) is having an affair with sex-addict Harry Pfarrer (George Clooney). 
From there the film progresses in such a brilliantly inauspicious way, with dark humor painting the corners while the characters' paths cross and double-cross each other, allowing the film to twist and turn in such a way that it is intricate and engaging, yet understandable to mass audiences. 
"Burn After Reading" appears to be the Coen brothers' most commercial project, which seems prudent following the mas­sive success of their last film, "No Country for Old Men." It features a well­measured mix of satire, cringe-worthy violence (a Coen trademark) and a plot­line that allows for an edge-of-your-seat 
adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's novel of the same name. The film three Academy Awards and cemented the brothers' place in the history of American film. 
The brothers are known as much for their techniques as· they are for their films. Examples of such trademark stylis~ tie elements include similar casting choic­es, strong dialogue, and a fond apprecia­tion for old films. Many of their films star the same actors, including Francis McDormand, Steve Buscemi, John Turturro, John Goodman and George Clooney. The characters in their films are also usually strange or off-kilter, either in their mannerisms or speech. The Coens also have a tendency to set their projects during time periods in which the charac­ters are facing extraordinary crises. The wit and banter they write for their char­acters is often quoted and cited, and their character work is some of the best in the fllm industry. 
The Coens have successfully made a wide range of films while dabbling in a variety of genres. With several new films planned for the future, including an adaptation of Michael Chabon's novel "The Yiddish Policemen's Union," fans of film can look forward to many more "Dudes" and Anton Chigurhs on the big screen.

portantly, seem to be genuinely enjoying the selves, which is a breath of fresh air today's film industry. lt also doesn't hurt that tliC entire cast hits the ball of the park, especially John and J.K. Simmons, who regrettably didn't get enough on-screen time. 
Although entertaining and well made "Burn After Reading" is by no means the upper echelon of the Coens' works It's no "No Country for Old Men," should the two films be compared to other. The reason being that "Burn Reading" is, in its purest form, a hearted movie with a darkness hidden beneath its surface, while "No Country" and the Cocos' similar movies are dark films with only a hint of daylight hidden beneath the surface. The film is better compared with "The Big Lebowski" or "Fargo," not measuring up to either. Only because it's the Coens and not some run of~the-mill Hollywood director does "Burn After Reading" not shine as a truly great film. Following up one of the est films in recent history is no and while the Coens certainly don't pure cinematic gold for the third time the celebrated careers, they do, make for a 97 -minute roller coaster of a movie that most definitely is the price of admission.

NFL 

Dolphins snap Pats' regular season win streak 
Defense leads Eagles to injury-filled win over Steelers; Browns' Anderson struggles in loss to Ravens 
Associated Press 
FOXBOHOUGH, Mass. -Fans booed the Patriots. Many left early. The record winning streak of their favorite team was ending with a stunning domination by the lowly Dolphins. 
Ronnie Brown scored a team­record four touchdowns rushing and threw for another -with four of the scores coming on direct snaps to the running back -as Miami shocked New England 38-13 Sunday. 
"It's brutal, man, brutal," Patriot<; defensive end Ty Warren said. 
The loss ended the Patriots' NFL mark of 21 straight regular­season wins that began after a 21-0 loss to the Dolphins on Dec. 10, 2006, in which Tom Brady, now sidelined for the season with a knee injury, was sacked four times. It also ended New England's chance for a second straight unbeaten regular season. 
The Dolphins, who lost their first 13 games last year and fin­ished 1-15, won for just the sec­ond time in 22 games. It was the first victory for new coach Tony Sparano, and it was a stunner. 
"That was fun. It was obviously a pretty emotional deal," he said. "They executed the game plan on both sides of the ball to perfec­tion." 
The Patriots kept getting fooled by the same trickery: six direct snaps resulting in four touch­downs after the Dolphins didn't use the play in their other two games. 
"When they get settled, they're pretty fundamentally sound as a defense," said Brown, who scored on runs of 2, 15, 5 and 62 yards. "So we wanted to give them something to adjust to." 
The Patriots never did. 
"I don't know why in the world we couldn't stop that play. They just came in and beat our butts," safety Rodney Harrison said. "You've got a bitter taste in your mouth. The only way to get rid of that bitterness is to come in and work hard. You get bitter and you get better." 

The Patriots didn't have Brady to lead a winning comeback as he's done 28 times in the fourth quarter. They had to rely on Matt Cassel and an offense missing running back Laurence Maroney to a shoulder injury, and that was far from enough. 
Brown gained 113 yards on 17 carries and the Dolphins out­gained the Patriots 461 yards to 216 in both teams' last game before their bye week. 
Miami's Chad Pennington went 17 -for-20 for 226 yards. Cassel completed 19 of 31 passes for 131 yards with one touchdown, one interception and a lost fum­ble. 
"We have to go out and regroup," Cassel said. "It is a learning situation for me playing from behind." 
Both New England (2-1) and Miami (1-2) have changed dra­matically since last season. 
Brady was lost for the year in the first quarter of the opener, and Cassel made his first start since high school in a 19-10 win at the New York Jets. Pennington is one of 27 Dolphins who were not on the team at the end of last season. 
After the Dolphins punted on their first series, the former Jets quarterback led them on drives of 74, 79 and 77 yards, ending in Brown's first three touchdowns. The Patriots managed just two field goals by Stephen Gostkowski, covering 37 and 44 yards, and trailed 21-6 at half­time. 
The Patriots got tricked again when Brown took another snap, rolled out and threw a left-hand-

opened a 28-6 bulge in the third 
quarter. 

"You should have seen his last 
pass in practice," Pennington 
said with a smile. "It wasn't very 
pretty." 

The Patriots' play was down­right ugly. 
"Believe me," coach Bill Belichick said of Brown's pass, "there were a lot of other prob­lems besides that." 
Cassel then threw his first touchdown pass of the year in 11 quarters of play when he con­nected with Jabar Gaffney for 4 yards. 
The Dolphins got that back with a big, and familiar, play: a direct snap that Brown carried 62 yards to the final touchdown.

'Boys reveal'secret weapon' in victory 
Seldom-used receiver Miles catches TD pass 
Associated Press 
GREEN BAY, Wis. -On an uncharacteristically quiet night for Terrell Owens, the Dallas Cowboys leaned on their defense and running game -then unleashed little-known wide receiver Miles Austin to put away a 27-16 victory over the Green Bay Packers on Sunday night. 
Marion Barber ran for a career-high 142 yards and a touchdown, and rookie Felix Jones added a 60-yard touch­down run in the second quarter. Austin, a backup who plays mostly on special teams, sealed the win with a 52-yard touch­down reception in the fourth quarter. 
"Just taking advantage of the double-teams on T.O. and (Jason) Witten," Austin said. "It's an advantage to me to have them on the team because they're going to take a lot of the pressure off me. I'm just going in there and trying to make plays when I can, and I'm fortunate enough that the coaches have trust in me, and the quarterback trusts me to give me the ball." 
Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo, who grew up in Burlington, Wis., was 17 -of-30 for 260 yards and Owens was held to two catches for 17 yards as Dallas (3-0) joined the reign­ing Super Bowl champion New York Giants as the NFC's only undefeated teams. 
"He played great," Romo said of Austin. "He did a great job, and we're excited to have him." 
It was the Cowboys' first win at Lambeau Field, and it came with former Packers stars such as Bart Starr and Paul Hornung watching from the sidelines. It also was a bump in the road for new Packers starter Aaron Rodgers, who completed 22 of 39 passes for 290 yards. However, he wasn't able to put together consistent scoring drives against Dallas' defense after standout performances in his first two games this season. 
"The Dallas Cowboys are far­ther ahead than we are right now, and that's the facts," Packers coach Mike McCarthy said. 
Rodgers scored on a sneak to cut Dallas' lead to 27-16 with 
2:11 remaining, but the ensuing onside kick was touched by the Packers before it traveled 10 yards and the Cowboys got the ball back_ 
Green Bay (2-1) trailed 13-6 at halftime, but Rodgers connected with Donald Driver on a 50-yard pass early in the third quarter that set up a field goal to cut Dallas' lead to four. 
Romo answered with a 63-yard pass to Austin to set up first-and­goal at the Green Bay 3. Barber found the end zone two plays later for a 2-yard touchdown run that put Dallas ahead 20-9. 
Romo again turned to Austin to put the game out of reach in the fourth quarter, tossing a 52-yard touchdown into double coverage down the right sideline to give Dallas a 27-9 lead with 9:17 remaining. 
The long passes to Austin were two of the Cowboys' few down­field plays all night. The Packers held Romo to nine completions for 75 yards at halftime. Owens caught two passes in the first half, then was silenced in the second. 
Packers cornerback Charles Woodson stuck to Owens all night, with significant help from the safeties. The Packers' pass defense played most of the game without star cornerback Al Harris, who went to the locker room with cramps just before halftime. 
But with Green Bay's defensive backfield preoccupied by Owens, Dallas got consistent production from Barber and a big play from Jones. 
With the Cowboys trailing 6-3 midway through the second quarter, Jones broke free for a 60-yard touchdown run that gave Dallas a 10-6lead. 
The Cowboys had a chance to add to their lead just before half­time, but Romo was sacked on a second-and-4 play at the Packers 5-yard line and had to settle for a field goal. 
Romo had another misstep in the red zone in the first quarter, throwing an interception in the end zone to safety Nick Collins. Collins ran the ball back 61 yards, setting up Mason Crosby's field goal that put the Packers ahead 6-3 early in the second quarter. 
Cowboys cornerback Adam Jones started the game with a big play, stripping the ball from running back Ryan Grant on the Packers' second play from scrim­mage and returning it to the Green Bay 14-yard line. That set up the Cowboys' first field goal.

Scobee's field goal lifts· Jaguars over Colts

any postgame party. The victory allowed Jacksonville (1-2) to avoid the franchise's first 0-3 start in five years and get out of what would have been a huge hole against the five-time AFC South champs. 
Instead of being two games behind Indy, they've drawn even with the Colts (1-2) and now hold the first chip in the tiebreaker. 
But it took far more than Scobee to shrug off their biggest nemesis. 
David Garrard impressively evaded the Colts' pass rush to buy more time and find receivers during the final 67 seconds. 
The powerful running tandem of Maurice Jones-Drew and Fred Taylor, who each topped 100 yards despite being nicked up with minor injuries, got the offense out of neutral for the first time this season. Jacksonville had the ball for more than 41 minutes. 
Unknown fullback Montell Owens just happened to be in the right place at the right time when Garrard's pass appeared to be tipped and fluttered toward midfield. Somehow Owens cradled it in his arms for a 10-yard gain and a first down. 
And, of course, there was Scobee. 
"That thing was drilled," Jaguars coach Jack Del Rio said. "It would have been good from 65 yards." 
Scobee disagreed, noting he had the distance but was a little 
Associated Press 
INDIANAPOLIS-Josh Scobee savored evnry part of Sunday's victory celebration. 
Evnn the wrnstling match with the ball boy. 
Scobee, who produced Jacksonville's only other win in Indianapolis with a 53-yard lield goal in 2004, did it again Sunday by making a 51-yarder with 4 seconds left to bnat the dreaded Colts 23-21. And this time, he took the ball. 

"My holder went to give me a high-five and I took off run­ning," said Scobee, who left the ball from his other winning kick in the Indianapolis locker room and never got it back. "I tried to get the ball from the ball boy and he didn't recognize me. lie wouldn't let go of it, so I had to rip it away from him." 
Just like he snatched a second straight comeback out of the Colts' grasp. 
The ramifications of Scobee's kick may last far longer than concerned it may not stay inside the right upright. 

''I'll take 51, that's good enough," he said. "It's too close to the pole to be kicking it from any further." 
Still, it didn't appear Jacksonville would need Scobee's long kick to win it after a marathon drive that con­sumed more than 12 minutes to 
Taylor carried 26 times for 121 yards, while Jones-Drew ran 19 times for 1 07 yards and one score and caught four pass­es for 59 yards. In all, the Jaguars ran for 236 yards and kept the ball for more than 41 minutes.

The Belles traveled in packs on Saturday with their top five runners all finishing within 35 seconds of each other. 
Junior Megan McClowry led the Belles to the finish line once again this season with a time of 20:22 -a season best for McClowry. 
"The difference for me this season is due to summer training," she said. "I was able to come in with a good base and then my teammates have helped push the pace at workouts this season." 


McClowry has been the front runner in each of the races the Belles have compet­ed in this season. 
Freshman Joanne Almond and sophomore Catie Salyer finished within a second of each other with times of 20:29, and 20:30 respectively. 
Senior co-captain Cailtin Brodmerkel was close behind that pair by running her own personal best time of 20:32. Fellow senior Erin Seidelmann also set a person­al record and finished with a time of 22:59.

Irish lose in finals of tournatnent 
Team beats Liberty, UC Irvine at home 
By SAM WERNER Sports Writer 

The Irish took down Liberty 
and UC Irvine before falling 
just short against Western 
Michigan this weekend at the 
Golden Dome Invitational. 

Junior outside hitter Christina Kaelin led the Irish (5-7) with 40 kills on the weekend. Against Liberty, the Louisville native posted a · .733 hitting percentage, lOth­highest in Notre Dame histo­
ry. 

"Kaelin was outstanding the 
first two matches, for sure," 
Notre Dame coach Debbie 
Brown said. "She carried a 
huge offensive load for us, 
and she's one of those players 
who wants the ball every 
time. She's aggressive and 
mixes up her shots." 

Kaelin said it was just a 
matter of fundamentals. 

"I was really working on 
keeping the ball in front of 
me and taking nice, high, 
aggressive swings," she said. 

Friday night against the 
Cairo Information Session 
Flames (9-4). the Irish put in a dominating performance, winning 25-10, 25-20, and 25-17. Notre Dame played a nearly flawless offensive game, committing only one hitting error the entire match. The Irish were almost equally as dominant on the defensive side, holding Liberty to a .090 hitting per­centage. Chelaine McCarty led the Flames with 11 kills. 
The next night, UC-Irvine (5-8) put up a better fight, but the Irish again prevailed, and once again it was Kaelin leading the way. 
The all-tournament team honoree posted a match-high 17 kills against the Anteaters, good for a .533 hitting per­centage. 
In a match Notre Dame won 25-22, 25-23, 25-23, UC­Irvine certainly staged their fair share of rallies, forcing 31 ties and 11 lead changes. The second set was even tied 23-23 before a pair of Anteater errors swung the match in favor of the Irish. 
After two convincing wins, the Irish looked to complete the weekend sweep against Western Michigan. They got off to a good start, winning

the first two sets 25-16 and 25-17. 
Something happened after the second set, though, and the Broncos came out firing in the third. After falling behind 8-4, Western Michigan ripped off a 15-3 run to stake a 19-11 lead that they never relinquished, taking the set 25-16. 
The Irish appeared to right the ship when they claimed a 7-3 lead in the fourth set, but again the Broncos rallied to claim a 11-10 lead. Notre Dame probably had its best chance to close out the match when they trailed by only three late in the set, but the Irish couldn't complete the comeback, and lost the set 25-20. 
Two key blocks by senior Justine Stremick gave Notre Dame hope in the fifth set when they trailed 12-9, but, again, the Irish couldn't fin­ish the job, falling 15-9. 
"I think as much as any­thing, Western turned it up after the first two games," Brown said. "They played a lot better." 
After the second game, the Broncos focused on loading up the middle, which, in turn, opened up seams on the out­side, Brown said. 
Brown also said that she wouldn't say much to her team after the match. 
"Everyone's down already so we don't need to blast them," she said. "We know it's not what we wanted to do." 
This weekend concluded preseason play for the Irish, who have competed in tour­naments in Minneapolis and Idaho, as well as two in South Bend. 
Notre Dame begins Big East play next weekend with a Friday night matchup against South Florida in Tampa. Brown said her team was full of potential, but heading into the conference season, she wasn't sure if they always capitalized on that potential. 
"We keep getting these glimpses of what we can do, and then we stumble," she said. "I think that our confi­dence probably isn't as high as it could have been if we had finished out strong [against Western Michigan]."

The Irish women had a good day as well. capturing first in the team category with a near­perfect 21 points. Dayton, the second-place team, finished with 107 total points. 
Junior Lindsay Ferguson took first in the 283-woman field with a time of 17:31 on the three-mile course. Sophomore Marissa Treece finished second with a time of 17:53.

Freshman Rachel Velarde fin­ished fifth, senior Becca Bauman finished sixth, sopho­more Abby Higgins finished sev­enth, and junior Emily Wauford finished tenth for the Irish. 
Women's head coach Tim Connelly was not entirely pleased with the race, even though the Irish had seven run­ners finish in the top 11. 
"Lindsay did well, a whole pack did well," he said, but "it wasn't what we wanted to see. The Notre Dame Invitational is a whole different world, and we've got to get a lot better before then."

Donohue put Notre Dame ahead for good and tied him with Donohue and junior mid­fielder Michael Thomas for the team-lead with four goals. 
Thomas made it 2-0 when he drilled a free kick from the left side low toward the far post, and junior forward Tamba Samba capped the scoring with his first career goal early in the second half. 
"It was a very good offensive performance," Clark said. "The big thing today was the play of [sophomore forward] Steven Perry and Tamba Samba... They came on for the first time this season [andl I feel they really stamped their authority in a game, and that was terrific." 
Perhaps more impressive for the Irish was the continued dominance of their defense. Quinn recorded his second straight shutout and third of the year in just Notre Dame's seventh game. 
Quinn made a career-best eight saves and has now allowed just one goal over the last four games, all against Big East teams. The Irish beat South Florida 5-0 on Sept. 7 during the Mike Berticelli Memorial Tournament in a game that did not count toward the conference stand­ings. 


The Irish have allowed seven goals in seven games but only four over their last six. 
"[Central defenders Matt) Besler and [Aaron] Maund also deserve special mention today," Clark said. "[Syracuse is] a huge team and a very physical team. I thought both Maund and Besler handled that physical challenge superbly." 
After five straight home con­tests, the Irish begin a three­game road stretch that begins Friday at Cincinnati in a Big East mateh.

Watson also had a solid game with nine kills and a pair of block assists of her own. Sophomore Meghann Rose helped carry the defense with 27 digs. 
The nail-biting victory put the Belles into the third place match for their final contest of the tournament. Callaudette, who narrowly escaped their morning match against Rose­Hulman, came out flat-footed as Saint Mary's rolled over them in the first two sets to gain a 2-0 advantage. 
The Bison collected them­selves and evened the match with two hard-fought wins in the next two sets as the nor­mally stout Belles defense crumbled. Saint Mary's stamped out any notions of a Callaudette rally with a domi­nating 15-7 final set to clinch third place. 
Four different Belles had at least 10 kills in the victory. 
Hellmann added 11. Watson and Kurczak both had 10 kills to round out the Saint Mary's attack. Freshman Danielle Brink contributed a solid effort with four kills in 12 attempts, 25 assists, six digs, a service ace, and two solo blocks. 
Schroeder-Biek said she was pleased by the team-wide effort. She has emphasized emotion and teamwork in the play of her young squad. 
"What I think it comes down to is connections," Schroeder­Biek said. "We need to stay connected with our teammates, we need to celebrate our suc­cesses on the court and pick each other up when we are down. We need to connect as teammates before we can expect to really compete as a team."

Yeatman was arrested earlier this year for driving drunk on campus. He pled guilty to drunken driving and reckless driving and entered a year-long probationary period. If he had completed the probation, the state would have moved to drop a criminal recklessness charge, the AP reported. 
The University suspended Yeatman from athletics for the spring semester. Yeatman also plays lacrosse for the Irish and is regarded as one of the top attacks in the nation. Yeatman was named LaxPower's Rookie of the Year in 2006 along with his first team All-Conference honors. 
Colic's father, Mike Colic, Sr., was a defensive lineman for Notre Dame and played for the Houston Oilers, Philadelphia Eagles and Miami Dolphins. He is now a co-host of ESPN Radio's "Mike and Mike in the Morning."

Hanks continues to pile up records in win 
By FRAN TOLAN Sports Writer 
The hits just keep on coming for KHrri Ilanks and No. 1 Notre Dame. A week after becoming the sixth player in NCAA Oiv. I history with 60 career goals and 60 assists, the senior forward scored two more goals and added several additional mile­stones to her rnsume. 
What's more, the Irish won their first Big East game by downing DePaul 1-0 Friday and defeated No. 16/17 Penn State 3-1 Sunday. The successful road trip ran Notre Dame's record to 8-0-0, including 4-0-0 away from home. 
The wins were bittersweet for the team, though, as head coach Randy Waldrum was not with Notre Dame Sunday due to a death in his family.
