EDWARDS AIR FORCE BASE, Calif. (AP) -Space shuttle Colum­bia brilliantly wound up its first trial by space-flight yesterday, sailing through the heat ofre-entry to a per­fect wheels-down landing on a sunbaked desert run~vay. 
The moment oftriumph belonged to astronauts John Young and Robert Crippen, who inaugurated a revolutionary space transportation system with a flight lasting two days, six hours. 
"What a way to come to Califor­nia," said Crippen. "'­
"Do we have to take it to the han­gar, Joe?" asked Young after the ship came to a stop. "We have to dust it off first," replkd Shuttle Control's 

Joe Allen. 
The astronauts came out of a l 5 minute communications blackout, the most danger filled time, with a tension breaking message for the shuttle team: "Hello Houston, Columbia here." 
Down, down, the Columbia went, dipping first to one side, then anoth­er. From a hypersonic speed in space it went to supersonic and then to subsonic. Two sonic booms ex­ploded over Rogers Dry Lake. 
"Looking beautiful," Allen said. And it was. 
The ship rolled to a stop on the Rogers Dry Lake runway on the Mojave Desert at I:22 p.m. right on the runway centerline. It had been aloft exactly two days, six hours, 20

Separatistspick up seats 
MONTREAL (AP) -The Parti Quebecois, which advocates in­dependence for the Canadian province ofQuebec, held its strong­est majority yet in the provincial legislature yesterday as a result of a sweeping re-election victory. 
The PQ, which first gained power 
in elections 4 years ago, won 80 
seats in the 122 member Quebec 
National Assembly in Monday's 
provincial elections. The opposition 
Liberal Party won the other 42. 
In the popular vote, with 70 per­
cent of the returns counted early 
yesterday, the left-of-centt:r PQ had 
1,215,523 votes, or 49 percent, and 
the middle-of-the-road Liberals 
I, 14 7, 160, or 46 percent. Although 
the vote was relatively close, the PQ 
won many more seats because its 
vote was more evenly distributed 
ov<:r more electoral districts. 
In the previous 1 I 0 member As­
sembly, the PQ had 67 seats, the 
Liberals 34, the Union Nationale 
five, and the Independents two. Two seats had been vacant. 
The Union Nationale, a con­servative French nationalist parry that governed Quebec as recently as 1970, received only 113,60 I votes in the incomplete returns, si&naling its apparent demise as a significant political force. 
The PQ favors ··sovereignty as­sociation" for Quebec, meaning political independence coupled with continued close economic ties with the rest of Canada. It contends this is the only way for Quebec to end English-Canadian economic

Ticket Managc:r Steve: Orsini, As­sistant Athletic Director Joe O'Brien, and Assistant Ticket Manager Jim Bell met with student hall representatives yesterday in the ACC conference room to discuss proposed basketball home ticket distribution plans for next season. 
Orsini said the plan must, "relieve the embarrassing problem of 'no­shows; and fairly distribute S,OOO tickt:ts to over 6,800 applicants." 
Athletic Director Gene Corrigan 
commented that "we have several 
different options, but we need feed­

back on what you students want in 
order to submit a final plan." 

The distribution plan which 
gained the favor of the 
representatives calls for the basket­ball tickets to he divided into two sets, each containing the same num­ber of"hig" games. This plan guaran­tees the seniors and the juniors both sets oftickets, and at least one set for the sophomores with a predetermined number of tickets 
set aside for a freshman lottery. Ifthe request for tickets by the seniors and juniors is low, the sophomores would be eligible to pick up a second set of tickets. 
Also under consideration is the possibility of changing the graduate students from junior to sophomore status tQ give the sophomore class a better chance at getting both sets of tickets. Ticket Manager Orsini told the; audience, "Don't forget we are not a policy committee. What we say here is not the final word. The plan must be submitted to Fr. Joyce." 
Representatives also suggested a distribution of tickets on a "first come, first serve" plan within the classes rather than through class lot­teries. 
Plans mentioned at the meeting but ruled out included the selling of tickets on a game by game basis and to make the bleacher seats gent·ral admission, then oversell them.

Boom town strikes it rich again 
By TIM BOVEE 
Associated Press Writer 
ELK CITY, Okla. (AP)-In this second-time boom town perched on the rim of the high plains, there's a place for anyone who wants to work ~ but not c:veryone who comes to work can find a place to live. 
The natural gas boom in Elk City is largely hidden from motorists pa..o;sing through on (nterstate 40, the old Route 66. The forest of derricks that marked earlier boomtimes is gone due to an Oklahoma law limiting drillers to one deep gas well per 640 acres. 
But the figures still add up to "boom town." . WEDNESDAY~=~===========·

The 1980 census shows a 29.7 percent growth rate in the l97()s. fownspeople think it was more. Nearly a quarter ofthe I82 phone directory Yellow Pages is for companies in the oil and gas business. 
Elk City first struck it rich on oil in the 1940s and 'SOs. Five years ago another wave o~ prosperity rolled over the town, located I I 0 miles from Oklahoma City, when oilmen began drilling for ga..o; lockt:d deep in the Greater Anadarko Basin. 

Experts estimate the entire basin holds about 88 trillion cubic fe<:t of r<:coverable gas in deep zones below I ';,000 feet. Shallow zones may contain an additional 30 trillion cubic feet or more. 
The boom has brouht money and people to Elk City, but it has also brought trouble, as growth threatens to outstrip the town's capacity to provide essential services like housing. 
ForemanJerry Grace, 31, supervises two rigs north of town. Ifa man gets off the bus in Elk City, broke and unskilled, Grace says he'll put him to work that afternoon, at SIO an hour. With an annual SO percent turnover in rough~ . necks, Grace's operation is hungry for men.

Early repayment of Guaranteed Student Loans could save both students and the government hundreds of dollars, under a plan suggested 1by the Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency. "The less time a student-borrower takes to repay a loan, the less it costs the government for special allowances and interest benefits and the less it costs students for interest repayments," says the PHEAA study. As an example, the agency explained the savings on a S4,000 GSL borrowed at 7 percent interest. Ifa student took the full 10 years to repay, the ultimate cost would be $5,573. But under the proposed plan, if a student repaid it within 30 days after graduation, the agency could discount the loan to S3,200 -actually less than the principal. Similarly, at the end of one year repayment would be just S3, 713-The federal government would make up the difference to len­ders, and would still save money in the long run. And the plan would not affect access to new loans, as would changes in GSL policy propo~ed b)' the Reagan administration. But the best n~ws yet is that students seem to find the plan feasible. A preliminary PHEAA survey of Pennsylvainia borrowers showed that more than half the students 
would be likely to opt for early repayment. -Collegiate Hedlines

Saint Mary's College recently received s6oo,ooo in the form of stocks, bonds and cash from a matured trust. The trust, created by Helen ()'Laughlin, a 1909 graduate of the College, is designated to increase the general endowment fund through invest­ments.

A weekend ofshame 


Last weekend, a stranger shamed me into re­evaluating myself and everything I have done for the past several months. The stranger's name is Glenn Rut­herford, and he is the metropolitan columnist for the 
Louisville Courier-journal. 
We crossed paths at the annual Indiana Collegiate Press Association convention. He was one of the guest lecturers; I was representing The Obseroer at the con­vention, along with Editor-in-Chiefjohn McGrath. 
Rutherford lectured. We listened. We listened hard, as did dozens of aspiring journalists attending his lecture. The man had journalism in his soul; writing was a way of life for him. He was trying to impart that at­titude to his audience. 
The technical advice he gave was nothing special ­it was the stuff of which boring textbooks are made: "write short sentences and paragraphs," "usc active verbs," "read Faulkner and Fitzgerald," and so on_ The basics covered in a beginning English class, really, and nothing Rutherford's audience hadn't heard many times before. 
Rutherford wasn't concerned about that, and neither was anyone who was listening to him. He gave these simple rules vitality and import, because he made it clear that he believed in were honored by the Association for ··caring about what they wrote": News Editor John Higgins won tht: investigative reporting award for his stories on the strip-search incident earlier this semester; former Editor-in-Chief Paul Mullaney and sports writer Kelly Sullivan received honorable mentions in the column and sports story categories, respectively; and Anthony­
Walton garnered a second prize for news analysis. 
I also was happy that most members attending the conference were envious ofThe Observer and its com­puter operation. Their envy made me eager to get back here to continue improving our system -and to begin caring about my work. 
With this renewed sense of purpose, I hopped into 
my car with my editor-in-chief to begin the trek home.

"The goal of a writer is to evoke an emotional response from the reader," he said. "You want to create in his mind a vivid and continuous dream. You can't do that unless you are writing about something that touches you deeply. 
"If you want to be a good writer, you must expose your emotions_ If you can't be hurt, you can't be a writer." 
I run the computer system at The Obsen1er. Writing is no longer a focus of my life, but as I listened to.Ruther­ford I wondered if I would ever be able to be a good writer.

nalistic attraction to alcohol. 
His elitist attitude was annoying, too. Rutherford was a writer's writer, convinced, it seemed, that writers (and all artists) were ble~sed with a heightened sen­Sitivity to the human condition -a sensitivity that only artists could share. As a computer operator, I was in­sulted by the implication. 
Suddenly, I realized that I was analyzing again, not feeling. 
Then I thought of colleagues who had won awards because they put their hearts in their work, adding feeling to analysis in an attempt to create a dream. 
I thought of a computer system I am paid to improve to help them create thal dream. Last weekend, a stranger shamed me into living.

This wt:ek's question: Do you feel the Reagan administration should send military aid to El Salvador? 
l am completely opposed to military aid as a matter of personal conviction. in keeping with the Catholic Bishops' position, and in reaction to the Government's simplistic argumentation. 
The Bishops' position recognizes the complex situation in El Sal­vador as their January statement strt:sses....Thc Bishops' opposition is hast:d on the conviction that "no real evidence exists that the g<wern­ment ofEl Salvador ha.o.; brought the security forces undt·r control." 
As for our government's rationale, I fear it to he shortsighted and too self-serving. To suggest El Salvador as "our hack yard," or our policy toward El Salvador as a stand against the spread ofCommunism, or El Salvador as a case of a bdeagut:red nation requesting the inter~ vention of Uncle Sam is more suted for the movies than for the best interests ofEl Salvador. 
Consequently, military aid is not the answer; rather: economic aid could help to lessen the plight of the peopk....The fundamt:ntal ques­. tion for our government, and the cause of democracy is: does military 
aid or economic aid win the hearts and minds of the pt.'ople? 
Bro. Rod St;·uble Stanford Hall 

When the president ofNotre Dame addressed a group ofalumni and advised them to become politically active for the proper welfare of their country, and to bear a public rt:sponsihility along with their academic training, Jose Duarte (NO, '48) was greatly impressed. As a consequence he became active in politics, and to the best of my knowledge he was active with a party of Christian Democrats which concerned itselfwith the improvement ofthe peopk. 
He has endured many difficult personal and physical times....Duarte's life was not jeopardized by the poor. Because of his staunch advocacy of the welfare of his c6untry, he has bt:en beaten, maimed and exiled. 
President Duarte has stated on several occao;ions that his country did not want military equipment from the United States; rather, all they wanted was food and medical supplies. In one interview Duarte was <L"iked if his country needed more arms in order to compete with tht: well-supplied guerrilla forces. He replied that rather than depend only on the strength of more arms, they were confident to rely upon the strength oftheir principles. 
Duarte is a dedicated individual who... must treat the great multi­plicity of problems that wet: not of his making and for whkh there is no simplistic solution.... I know Duarte. Ht: is a good and moral man. I trust him. He is dedicating his life and career in the welfare of his country. 
}amesA. McCarthy Prof Emeritus, Citil Engineering South Bend 
The most ft:asihle and humane solution in El Salv:tdor is for the economic agrarian reform to succeed. This will he done by l"Stablish­ing the military/civilian junta as being credible and by supporting them with economic aid. 
Unfortunately, Prt:~ident Reagan views the leftist threat to be a major one in Central America. There havt· been more arms Sl·nt to El ~alvador in the last year than the last 20 combined Th<"ir rnilitarv warehouSt:s are filled. . 
This ~d may result in unwanted side effects. The adJitional aid will increase the level of corruption of tht: security for<.'es within the military. These forces arc responsible for over half of the deaths in El Salvador. For tht: last 100 yt:ars the country has het'n under military and aristocratic control. Only in the last year and a halt ha." a civilian had a say in the country's affairs. The situation, esp·cially with the selection of Duarte as president, had been moving in the U.S.'s favor. Why reverse strategy now when the original one wa..' effective?

Nancy's sister, Sandy, will do her 
best to help the Tigers continue 
their luck against the Irish from her 
number-one single spot. Afreshman, 
Sandy combined with her big sister 
to help DePauw to the Indiana AlAW 
Division III championship fall, and as 
a number-one doubles tandem, the 
Gyorgyis were undefeated last fall. 
Today's match truly will be a 
battle ofchampions, since the Tigers 
claimed last fall's Division III state 
title, while the Irish captured seven 
ofnine flights to duplicat~the feat at 
the Division II level. 
"We'd really love to beat them," 
says Fischette. "But if we don't, we 
don't. It won't be the end of the 
world or anything, as long as we play 
as well as ~·e can." 
That hasn't been much of a 
problem ·for Fischette, who enters 
today's contest with 1980-81 
records of21-4 at singles ~nd 27-'5 at 
doubles. Beyond her obvious talent, 
Fischette's ability to keep her com­
posure on the court has been a large 
factor in her success. 
"Pam just goes out there and plays 
her game, and she doesn't let any_­
thing bother her," says P_etro. "You 
can't tell ifshe's winning or losing by 
looking at her. I wish all of my 
players had her composure on the 
court." 
Of course, when you're in the 
middle of a 48-9 (combined singles 
and doubles) season, it's not often 
that there's a whole lot to get upset 
about, unless, of course, your op­
ponents pops her gum or looks at 
you cross-eyed. 
"If I'm in a tough match, I feel the 
tension and anxiety inside," Fis­
chette says. "But if I would start 
throwing my racquet or yelling at 
myself, it would only makethings 
worse. I'm not really calm on the 
inside, hut being calm ()fl the outside 
helps. 
"When things aren't gomg well, I 
just pretend like it's a whole new 
match," she explains. "I tell myself 
to just get the next point, take one 
step at a time, and forget.about what 
just happened." 
Fischette started playing tennis 
when she was in sixth grade, but her 
baskeball career began even earlier. 
"I played basketball before tennis because we didn't have any tennis facilities in our grade school, and the tennis boom hadn't hit yet." 
Even though Fischette averaged 
l 7 points per game as a ~eni~r while 
winning all-conference and all­
region honors, she wa-.n't really 
tempted to give basketball a shot at 
Notre Dame. 
"It's pretty tough to play two sports, and you can take tennis with you for the rest ofyour life -in bas­ketball, you can just take an injury with you for the rest of your life," she laughs. 
Just a'i she was initially impressed by Nancy Gyorgyi's reputation, Fis­chette was lured to Notre Dame by its famous mystique after almost op­ting for Penn State or Rollins. 
"If I would have gone to either of those schools, it would have been to devote nearly all of my time to ten­nis," she says. "But I had wanted to go to Notre Dame since before I started playing tennis, so I decided to give it a try_" 
At the rate she's going. it won't t>e long before Pam fischdt~ is huild­ing a mystique of her own.

Builds mystique 
Fischette awaits rematch 
By CRAIG CHVAL 
Sports Writer 
For Pam Fischette, what she didn't know did hurt her. Fortunately for Fischt·ttt· and her teammates on the ~otre Dame women's tennis team, though. the freshman sensation is a quick learner. 

The Irish had already achieved their goal for tht· 1980 fall campaign by capturing the Indiana AlA\X' Divi­sion II d1ampionship three days ear­lier. a conquest in which the rookie from Liverpool, :'II.Y., played no small role:. conrributing state titles at third singles and second doubles.
! 
Now. <.:oach Sharon Petro's squad

1 
was hound for Greencastlc, Ind., to finish out the fall slate against DePauw. The Tigers had always' been a thorn in Notre Dame's side. defeating tht· Irish in each of the three previous meetings between the schools. 
.\taking matters worse, Petro was making the trip without two of her top singles players, number-two linda Hover. and number-five Marv
' . 
Lt·geay. In the ensuing series of flip-flops and juggles. Fischette found herself in the number-two slot, · matched up against Nancy Gyorgyi. 

ASouth Bend native, Gyorgyi had­never lost to a Notre Damc player, and Fischette's teammates duly in­formed her of that piece of trivia in the van on the way to Greencastle. Never mind her 16-0 singles record, forget her 22-1 doubles marJ{ -by the time Pam Fischette stepped onto the court to face Gyorgyi, she was a wreck. 
"Everybody was kind of joking about it on the way down," she remembers. "I was pretty much clueless. My attitude was, 'Oh I've got to play this girl, and I don't even know her or how she plays.' " 
The first set was predictably rocky for Fischette. She dropped it hy a 6-2 score, and it took a while for the awe to wear off. 
Under Faust 
By MARK HANNUKSELA 
Sports Writer 
With the coming of any new ad­ministration, so too comes change. 
Along with taxes and death, change is one of the inevitabilities of life. 
So it should come as no surprise to football fans that a number of changes have accompanied Gerry Faust and his fiery personality to this South Bend campus. 


Pahaps the most noticeable of these changes have occured on the playing tleld, where no less than a dozen players have switched posi­tions since the end oflast season. 
\tost of the changes have come in the offense, which Faust has said will attempt to put as much pressure as pos"Sibk uh opposing defenses next season by running from a number of different formations. 
One way he hopes to apply pressure is through the installation of a wingback position. Curn:ntly, the leading candidate to fill that position in the fall is junior Tim Tripp. 
A starter in two games for Dan Devine's Irish last season. Tripp should benefit greatly from the switch, because it will grant him an opportunity to log more playing time. something he was not quite able to do while playing at split t·nd behind Tony Hunter. 

"I'd heard so much about her, that every time she made a good shot, I was saying to myself, 'She really is good.' " she recalls. "But we had a couple of pretty long rallies, and I told myself that if I could rally with her, I could at least play ·a com­petitive match." 
Gyorgyi probably would choose a word other than compttitive ­awesome might not be a bad choice. Fischette rebounded to capture the match 2-6, 6-2, 6-1, giving Notre Dame one ofjust two points in a 7-2 loss. 
"That was probably the best match I played during the fall," al­lows Fischette, who had plenty of sparkling efforts to choose from. "It was mostly a matter of gaining my concentration, and keeping it 
chrou the last two 

Pam Fischette has been a key performer for the Notre Dame women's tennis team this spring and thefreshman sensation will be performing this afternoon at 3:30p.m. as the Irish play host to DePauw at the Courtney Tennis Center. (photo by Tim McKeogh) 
For. her part, Petro couldn't say enough about her freshman star af­ter the match. 
"That was really something," she enthused. "Being a freshman, I think Pam was a little nervous at the begin­ning of the match, but once she got her confidence, she was unstop­pable. Nancy was just stunned." 
The Tigers pay a return visit to Notre Dame this afternoon, as the Irish will go for their fi_rst victory in five tries against DePauw at 3:30 
p.m. at the Courtney Tennis Center. Unfortunately for Gyorgri, she won't have a chance for revenge, since she's spending the semester studying abroad, and Fischette will be back in her familiar number-three spot. 
See PAM, page 6 
Spring sees position changes 
Three other changes have been made in the Notre Dame receiving corps, a unit which many feel was not utilized fully by Devine. 
One of the changes has seen for­mer quarterback Greg Knafelc, who has been granted another year of eligibility after sitting out last season with a shoulder injury, move to split end, where he is listed behind juniors Mike Boushka and Dave Con­deni, and sophomore Mike Favorite. 
Hunter is not listed on tl:te current Irish depth charts because of an in­jury to his an~le. 
Also added to the receiving corps are juniors Pete Buchanan and Ron 
Spring Football'81 
,\1ishler. Hoth are now listed as tight ends. 
Buchanan, a 6-3, .220-pound native of Plymouth, Ind., was one of Devine's messenger fullbacks last · season, while .\1ishler, who hails from Metamora. Ill., served as a back­up to all-America middle linebacker Bob Crable last season. 
Buchanan should benefit most from the move, due to the signing of Parade all-America fullback Mark Brooks, the leading rusher for Faust's final Cincinnati Moeller club. 
Brooks is expected to battle soph­omoreJohn Sweeney for the starting 
fullback job. 

Other offensive changes have been among linemen who simply find themselves at new positions in the trenches. 
Two starters from last year, Tom Thayer and Mike Shiner, have swapped positions. Thayer has taken Shiner's left tackle spot, while Shiner is now filling Thayer's right guard position. Both men will be juniors next season. 
Sophomore Mark Fischer, a 6-4, 220-pound tight end from Massilon, Ohio, has moved to the center posi­tion, and this spring is filling in for an injured Larry Kissner on the first team offense. 
Moving from center to right tackle is freshman Steve Keane ofLit­tleton, Co., an honorable mention choice on the Adidas/Scbolastic Coach prep all-America unit, while Mike Kelley, a freshman from Westfield, Mass., who did not play last season because of a back injury, will move from guard to center. 
On the other side ofthe ball, three 
changes have been made, two on the 
line. 

Freshmen Jon Autry and Chris 
Boerner, linebackers this past 
season, have moved to left defensive 
end. 

Presently, Autry, a Fort Wayne, 
Ind. native, is No. 1 on the Irish 
See SPRING, page 7 

RITES OF FALL-With spring workouts in full swing and the annual Blue-Gold scrimmage only a couple of weeks away, many people arc already looking toward next fall's football season. 
Notre Dame's road to the national championship may be tougher than it has been the past couple ofyears, Although the Irish will play 6 of their 11 regular season games at home (including five in a row), they face stiff competition both here and away. 
The Irish open with a home contest against Lousiana State on Satur­
day, September 12, a start one week later than the September 6 start 
ABC Sports arranged this past season. They then play a pair ofstudent 
road trip specials, facing Michigan in Ann Arbor and Purdue in West 
Lafayette the following two weeks. 
Notre Dame closes out its 1981 Big Ten hat trick against Michigan 
State on October 3 in the first offive straight clashes on friendly turf 
Faust's footballers play host to Florida State on October 1 0, then take a 
weekend off to prepare for their annual showdown with Southern Cal 
on October 24. Mid-semester break runs from October 17 to 25, so 
students will have to come back early rather than stay late during the 
fall study hiatus. 

The annual Navy battle will be waged October 31 while Georgia 
Tech closes out the home slate one week later. The Irish round out the 
regular season with a trio ofaway games against Air Force (November 
14 ), Perin State (November 21 ) and Miami ofFlorida(November 28) . 
According to NCAA edicts, a school may only appear on ABC-TV's College football telecasts twice per season (once on a national and once on a regional broadcast), with one extra "exception;' game pos­sible per two-year period. Since Purdue, Alabama and USC were all 
ABC games last season, Notre Dame is only .eligible to appear twice 
next season. It is virtually a given that the USC game will be one tube 
offering, while the second game could he Penn State, Michigan, 
Florida State or even Purdue, .the lrish/Nittany Lion matchup being 
the most likely. 

However, the Ohio State/Michigan and Oklahoma/Nebraska games 
are slated for the same November 21~t date the Irish play Penn State, 
so it is likely that one or even two ofthose thr.ee power-packed games 
may be moved to some other open date in the season (just as the 
Notre Dame/USC game was this year). 
In fact, ABC has expressed an interest in moving the Penn State 
game, although no one in the Athletic Department seems excited 
about the idea. The only dates to which the game could be moved are 
September 5 or December 5, since the mid-season open dates ofboth 
tc:-ams do not coincide. Incidentally, the Lions may not-mind moving 
the Notre Dame game since their current schedule has them playing 
Alabama the week before the Irish. 
POMP AND CIRCUMSTANCE -Halftime of the upcoming Blue­Gold game will be more than a three-ring cir<.:us. Bands and pom-pom girls from local grade schools and high schools have been invited to perform at halftime of the annual scrimmage, and several awards will also be presented. Chuck Aragon, the senior trackster from Los Lunas, N.M., will be presented an award commemorating his sub-four-minute mile during the indoor track season. Retired Athletic Director Moose Krause will be presented a brand new Cadillac given to him by friends from the Chicago area, and The Obseroer will grant its Sportsman and Sportswoman of the Year awards. 
PASSING THE BALL-Mike Mitchell, a three-year veteran ofDigger 
Phelps' traveling basketball show, has been named the captain of the 
1981-82 edition. 

A 6-2 guard from San Bruno, Calif., Mitchell and walk-on Marc Kelly will be the only seniors on the predominately-underclass squad next year. Mitchell played in all but one game as a freshman before knee problems hampered his performance during his sophomore and junior campaigns. He averaged 3.0 points-per-game and finished third on the team as a rookie with 73 assists. 
October knee surgery the past two seasons kept his scoring average to 2.5 points in 24 games during the 1979-80 season and 1.3 points in 13 games during the recently-concluded session. 
Says basketball czar Phelps: "Despite his injuries, Mike has proven 
to us that he deserves this honor. We talked to him back when he was 
in high school about having tpe chance to be captain when he was a 
senior -and his leadership characteristics have earned him the op­
portunity." 

THE ONE THAT GOT AWAY-Although Phelps gained a captain yesterday, he also lost a recruit. Benny Anders, a 6-5 forward from Louisiana who visited the Notre Dame campus this past weekend, an­nounced his intention to enroll at Houston next year. 
ICE ACCOLADES-Jeff Logan and Dave Poulin, who will both be 
seniors next season, have been named co-captains oflhe 1981-82 Irish 
hockey team. Seniors-to-be Bill Rothstein and John Schmidt were 
selected as alternate captains in the election held among members of 
the team. 

Logan, who led the Irish in scoring with 24 goals and 12 assists, was 
also named the Most Valuable Player by his teammates and received 
the ~otre Dame National Monogram Club's MVP award. 
Scott Cameron won the scholar-athlete award from the Notre Dame 
Club of St. Joseph Valley and Kevin Humphreys was the recipient of 
the Blue Line Club's Ed McGauley Award as the team's outstanding 
senior. 

Laurels also went to defenseman Tony Bonadio (rookie ofthe year), 
senior Jef' Brownschidle (best defenseman), junior Bill Rothstein 
(best defe1 sive forward) aad sophomore center Mark Doman (most 
improved f· 'ayer). The team's most c'oveted award went to Don Lucia. 
who won tt. ~John Whitmer award, bestowed annually on the player 
who best ex\:mplifies the disposition ofthe team's beloved trainer.
