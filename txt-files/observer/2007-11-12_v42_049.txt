CWILhosts 6th annual conference 
lEW highlights abroad programs for students 
By KATIE KOHLER Saint Mary's Editor 
While Saint Mary's has had study abroad programs for 38 years, a centralized office to over­see international and intercultural learning at Saint Mary's was only created in 2002. 
To raise awareness about abroad programs and internation­al relations, Elaine Meyer-Lee, the director of the Center for Women's Intercultural Leadership (CWIL), and the the rest of the Saint Mary's community, will host International Education Week. 
"International Education Week is a joint initiative of the U.S. Department of State and U.S. Department of Education to cele­brate and promote a global exchange between the United States and other countries," Meyer-Lee said. 
This year's events mark the eighth-annual International Education Week across the coun­try and sixth at Saint Mary's. 
"Our observance of International Education Week started in 2002 with our first study-abroad fair for students and has grown every year with additional regular activi­ties and various new ones each year," Meyer-Lee said. 
The various speakers chosen for the events are in coordination with abroad programs in which Saint Mary's typically participates, Meyer-Lee said.

A panel of six business pro­fessionals from various back­grounds agreed Friday that diversification in the work­force is the duty of the employer and that it is a process that is never com­pletely concluded. 
As a part of its first MBA Diversity Conference, the Mendoza College of Business hosted the panel in a discus­sion, titled "Diversity as a Strategy, Making a Difference in Mainstream Business," at Mendoza's Giovanini Commons. 

Addressing the issue of the importance of diversity in the workplace, Jannifer Crittendon, the director of institutional equity at Notre Dame, said that the impor­tance lies in three different categories: social justice, legal and regulatory compli­ance and application to cer­tain business cases. 
"[Maintaining diversity in the workplace] is just the right thing. It allows equal opportunity for education and employment," Crittendon said. Quoting Martin Luther King, Jr., Crittendon added: "Morality cannot be legislat­
ed, but behavior can be regu-Iated." Crittendon said businesses . enjoy many advantages in diversifying their workforce. 
"Companies need to under­stand that diversity can mean improvement," she said. "With more immigrants and minorities entering the work­force, there is a war for tal­ent." 
She added that businesses should strive to be the not only the employers of choice, but also the providers of choice "for its products and services." 
Andrew Givens, vice presi­dent of partnership market­ing for ESPN, said business is not as effective "if everyone looks and thinks alike." Speaking of his experience in the television industry, Givens said that Time Warner, Nickelodeon and MTV all have done good jobs in diversification. 
Ricardo Hernandez, Director of ITM Controlling and Supply Management and a native of Mexico City, said diversity is not always visi­ble, making it hard to fully diversify.

Hesburgh, ROTC honor fallen veterans 
Ceremony extolling virtues of program follows 24-hour vigil at Clarke Memorial Fountain 
By JOSH LEEUW News Writer 
University President Emeritus Father Theodore llesburgh extolled the virtues of Notre Dame's commitment to its Heserve Officer Training Corps (HOTC) program Friday at a cer­!-1mony honoring Veterans Day. 
"I can't think of a better place or better group of people who are committed to service to be honoring today," Hesburgh said. 
The ceremony followed a 24­hour vigil at the Clarke Memorial Fountain, informally known as Stonehenge. 
Beginning at 4 p.m. Thursday, members of the Notre Dame HOTC kept a 24-hour guard at the Clarke MemoriaL A rotating group of four cadets, represent" ing the branches of the ROTC program took their positions on each side of the memorial; by Friday afternoon, 152 cadets had participated. 

Following the 24-hour vigil, members of the ROTC and Notre Dame community gathered at the Clarke Memorial to honor the nation's fallen veterans. 
"Today we honor all who have given the ultimate sacrifice," said Cadet Lt. Col. Margaret Lindley, who served as the emcee for the ceremony.

Liberal studies head rethinks Milton 
Fallon argues works are autobiographical, not rooted in religion 
By ASHLEY CHARNLEY News Writer 
Belying on characters and thHmes in John Milton's writ­ings, NotrH DamH professor Stephen Fallon argued Saturday that Milton was not the religious writer history has dubbed him. 
As part of' the Snite Museum's Saturday Scholar Series, Fallon, the chairperson of' liberal stud­ies at Notre Dame, said Milton did not become a religious writer until thH end of his writ­ing career. 
"My argument is counterintu­itive," Fallon said. "I am going to argue that Milton. widely con-

Students, professors vie for popular titnes 
Late morning classes among top choices 
By BRIAN McKENZIE News Writer 
While it may be obvious that students make all efforts to avoid 8 a.m. classHs in favor of more appealing choices later in the day, it seems the faculty does the same. With rostering for next semester quickly approaching, students and pro­fessors hope to fulfill their edu­cation requirements while maintaining convenience and scheduling ease. The University, too, strives to meet these demands. 
Still, convenience is one of many factors in the scheduling process. 
"Notre Dame's courses are scheduled with both efficiency and curricular needs in mind," Assistant Registrar Chris Temple said. 
"It's no accident" that courses fall in neat intervals, he said. For examplH, on Tuesdays and Thursdays one class will last from 9:30 to 10:45 a.m. and the next will start at 11. 
"We have to find certain stan­dard class times to use the class rooms efficiently.... The scheduling decision starts with the academic department," Temple said. "Then each col­lege dean assesses the situation and works with the depart­ments to negotiate what sched­ule makes the most sense for

}un1ping the holiday gun

I love Christmas as much as the

probably morn than the avorage por­

datt~ until Thanksgiving. 
On top of that, I don't think it's fair to Thanksgiving to oven think about it until wo havo onough stuffing and cranborry sauce to last us the rest of the month. 
Thanksgiving is a great holiday and orw of tho only timos each year you can nat until you pass out and not feel bad about it. I'm in no rush ((Jr that to bn ovor. 
But that's not thn point. The point is that by jumpstarting Christmas in t~arly Novmnbnr, when it finally comes on Dee. 25, it fnnls like it's over before it 1wen began. 
For as many years as I can rmnem­bnr. I wake up on Christmas morning to Christmas earols and stoeking stuffnrs, opnn a few presnnts, go to ehun~h and tlwn suddonly realizn that Christmas-thn day for which I have bonn waiting and proparing for months-is over. 
We spend hundrnds of hours and usually thousands of dollars gotting rnady for Santa. but WI\ forget that Christmas. likn all days, is only 24 hours. Dec. 26 is just another day. 
The stretch of llalloweon, Thanksgiving and Christmas within two months of eaeh other is the best span of the year, only to be topped oil" with New Year's. People need to understand that getting ahead of our­selves is the very reason every Nov. 1, Nov. 25ish, Dee. 26 and Jan. 1 that we're serat1~hing our heads wondering where the time went and saying "What a shame. That wasn't as fun as it used to bn." 
In addition to over-preparing for Christmas, theroby decreasing its ovnral( luster, people are let down by what became of it. 
And who do we have to blame for this'? Storefronts putting out Christmas decorations in November, starting the "25 Days of Christmas" 45 days in advance and ofl"ering incen­tives for buying now-all eclipsing Thanksgiving in all its glory. 
I ask you to onjoy nach holiday, preparing for no longer than the win­dow snparating them. Believe me, Christmas (and Thanksgiving) come hut once a year. You might as well get your monny's worth (or your mashed potatoes worth). 
I am all for welcoming the spirit of Christmas early. I like putting up dec­orations weeks in advance. However, there must be a line drawn so that the Christmas holiday monopoly does not infringe on Thanksgiving. The pil­grims wouldn't have wantod it that way and neither do I.

Instead, Donald Cesare is in the Erie County Prison on federal bank robbery charges stemming from a holdup Thursday at the First National Bank in Millcreek Township.

'Mr. Toilet' builds commode­shaped house 
SUWON, South Korea­Sim Jae-duck has made his political career as South Korea's Mr. Toilet by beauti­fying public restrooms. Now he's got a home befitting his title: a toilet-shaped domicile complete with the latest in lavatory luxury. 
Sim is building the two­story house set to be finished Sunday to commemorate the inaugural meeting later this month of the World Toilet Association. The group, sup­ported by the South Korean government, aims no less than to launch a "toilet revo­lution," by getting people to open their bathroom doors for the sake of improving worldwide hygiene. 
Representatives from 60 countries will gather in Seoul to spur the creation of national toilet associations of their own and spread the word about hygiene. Organizers argue the issue deserves greater attention and cite U.N. figures that some 2.5 billion people live without proper sanitation or water supplies.

Lane111an receives PECASE avvard 
Engineering prof recognized by President, also up for NSF honor 
Special to The Observer 
J. Nicholas Laneman, assistant professor of electrical engineer­ing at Notre Dame, has been named one of the 58 recipients of a Presidential Early Career Award for 
Scientists a n d Engineers (PECASE) and one of the 20 hon­orees nomi­nated by the NSF 

f r o m Laneman 
among the grantees of its Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) program. He and the other PECASE recipients were recog­nized in a ceremony Nov. 1 at the White House. 
The PECASE program, which was established in 1996, identi­fies and honors outstanding young researchers and is the highest honor that a beginning scientist or engineer can receive from the U.S. government. Selection is based on innovative research and community service as demonstrated through scien­tific leadership, education or out­reach. Nine government agen­cies. including the National Science Foundation (NSF), nomi­nate eandidates for the PECASE prohrram. 
"Because the PECASE honors young scholars for their out­standing research and teaching accomplishments and recognizes the potential impact they may have on future generations, it is an extraordinary award for a young faculty member," said James L. Merz, interim dean of the College of Engineering and the Frank M. Freimann Professor of Electrical Engineering. "We are delighted that Professor Laneman has been honored in this fashion." 
Laneman, who joined the University in 2002, specializes in the areas of communications and signal processing, with a particular emphasis on wireless communications and network­ing. Widely credited as a pioneer of cooperative diversity, an area of communications that deals with making wireless links more reliable through the use of signal relays, his seminal papers on the subject have been highly cited by other communications researchers. 
Laneman's award-winning CAREER (and subsequently PECASE) project, "Toward a Renaissance in Finite Blocklength Information Theory," focuses on fundamental performance trade-offs of com­munication systems and net­works for applications, such as wireless, in which transmission intervals are limited relative to the randomness of the communi­cations medium. Longer inter­vals enable more reliable trans­missions, but they also con­tribute to delays. Users who accept long delays for some applications, such as text mes­saging or e-mail, find them unacceptable for other applica­tions, such as cell phone calls or video streaming. The goal of the project is to provide a mathe­matical and computational framework for characterizing such trade-offs and designing more efficient systems. 
In addition to theoretical work, Laneman and his research group are developing a wireless network testbed, based upon software-defined radio (SDR), to encourage the implementation and verification of communica­tions algorithms and to enhance SDR technology. The team, which includes undergraduates as well as graduate students, is working to make SDR more portable, affordable and reliable for a variety of applications. 
As part of this effort, Laneman's team has obtained funding from the National Institute of Justice to develop SDR technology in order to help public safety and emergency response personnel better com­municate, especially during cata­strophic events, when traditional infrastructure is unavailable or inoperable. 
A native of St. Charles, Mo., Laneman earned bachelor's degrees in electrical engineering and in computer science from Washington University in St. Louis and master's and doctoral degrees in electrical engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 





ND law professor testifies to Congress 
Special to The Observer 
Mary Ellen O'Connell, Robert and Marion Short pro­fessor of law at Notre Dame, testified before Congress ear­lier this month as part of an expert panel on "Preserving America's Global Leadership through International Law 
and Justice." 
O'Connell, a professor of international law, reported that the United States has denied itself the advantages offered by international law by ignor­ing its tenets in invading Iraq, in how it occupied Iraq, and in 
tiona! law and have sought to promote it, to shape it, and to ensure our compliance with it." 
Yet, O'Connell testified, the United States was and contin­ues to be knowingly and will­ingly non-compliant with the same laws it helped to write and endorse. 
Disregard for Articles 2(4) 

':4s an occupying power, the United States has not restored nor maintained law and order to ensure public safety. '' 
Mary Ellen O'Connell law professor 
and 51 of the UN Charter, which prohibits the use of force except in self­defense to an armed attack, led to the United States' unlawful inva­sion of Iraq, says O'Connell. The U.S. also disobeyed the H a g u e Regulations, which govern 


how it has conducted interro­gation. 
O'Connell referenced the United Nations Charter, the Geneva Conventions, and the Convention against Torture in her statement at the forum organized by House Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers. 
She stated that, since the nation's founding, "Our great­est statesmen have under­stood the benefits of interna­the rules on occupation. 
"As an occupying power, the United States has not restored nor maintained law and order to ensure public safety, as required by the Regulations." 
O'Connell cites numerous Articles of the Geneva Conventions that support her contention the U.S. broke international law through its employment of coercive inter­rogation techniques.

Iraqi PM says suicide attacks down 
BAGHDAD -Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al­Maliki said Sunday suicide attacks and other bombings in the Iraqi capital have dropped dra­matically since last year's high, calling it a sign of the end of sectarian violence. A top U.S. general here said he believes the drop is sustainable, as Iraqis turn away from extremists. 
AI-Maliki said "terrorist acts" including car bombings and other spectacular, al-Qaida-style attacks dropped by 77 percent. He called it a sign that Sunni-Shiite violence was nearly gone from Baghdad.

The rate at which infants die in the United States has dropped substantially over the past half-century, but broad disparities remain among racial groups, and the country stacks up poorly next to other industrialized nations. 
In 2004. the most recent year for which statistics are available, roughly seven babies died for every 1,000 live births before reach­ing their first birthday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says. That was down from about 26 in 1960. 
Babies born to black mothers died at two and a half times the rate of those born to white mothers, according to the CDC figures. 

Senators survey San Francisco oil spill 
OAKLAND, Calif. -Federal officials want a bird's-eye view of San Francisco Bay to observe environmental damage caused by the area's worst oil spill in nearly two decades. 
U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., and Coast Guard Commandant Adm. Thad Allen planned to take an aerial tour of the damage Sunday. 
A preliminary Coast Guard investigation found that "human error," not mechanical fail­ure, caused the cargo ship Cosco Busan to sideswipe a support on the San Francisco­Oakland Bay Bridge, leaving a gash nearly 100 feet long on the side of the 926-foot vessel. 
"There were skilled enough individuals on board this ship. They didn't carry out their missions correctly," said Hear Adm. Craig Bone, the Coast Guard's top official in California.

Bush declares trust in Musharraf 
President addresses "common goal" with Pakistan in defeating global terrorist networks 
Associated Press 
CRAWFORD, Texas ­President Bush stepped up praise of Pakistan's President Pervez Musharraf Saturday, hail­ing "positive steps" the general took by promising to lift emergency rule, resign as army chief and hold elections. 
Indeed, Bush refused to pointedly criticize Musharraf at a joint news conference here with visit­ing German Chancellor Angela Merkel, continuing the cautious and measured response he's embraced in the week since Musharraf imposed the crackdown. 
Bush did, however, dodge a question whether Musharraf's moves, seen by many as an attempt to cling to power, constitute a dangerous distraction from the battle against al-Qaida insurgents. 
Speaking after two days of meetings with Merkel, the president said he has confidence in the commit­ment of Pakistan's leader­ship to stick with the U.S. in the fight against global terrorism. "We share a common goal," Bush said. 

Musharraf aligned him­self with Washington after the Sept. 11 attacks on U.S. soil, Bush noted, suggesting the Pakistani has given him no reason to doubt him since that decision. In fact, Opposition leader Benazir "He fully understands the ment program was a major Bush added, several ai­Bhutto spent Friday under dangers of al-Qaida," Bush topic of discussion.

"llis story is impossible, so it begins to disintegrate when it is met with real life," Fallon said. "He uses the Gospnl to authorize divorce. Milton believes that someone can 'mutiny against God' and exit a marriage," Fallon said. 
Arter his writings on mar­riagP and divorce, Milton's writing about himself began to change, Fallon said. Characters that resemble him in his works began to accept their sinfulness in a way Milton himself never would. In one of his works, the character that is modeled most after him is Satan, Fallon said. The story elaims that Satan was cast out of !leaven because of his pride. Although Milton never admit­ted to his own pride -or d1~nied his perfection -he did question these qualities in his characters. 
Fallon noted the maturity of Milton's characters in admitting their own sins, fur­ther asserting tlw maturity Milton himself did not have. 
"By the end of his career, I am tempted to say, Milton was at last, in spite of him­self, becoming a religious writer," Fallon said.

China confirms "date rape" toys 
BEIJING -China's safety watchdog confirmed Saturday that toy beads recalled in the United States and Australia after sickening children contain a substance that can turn into the "date­rape" drug after ingested. 
The toys, coated with the industrial chemical 1,4-butanediol, were made by the Wangqi Product Factory in Shenzhen, a city just over the border from Hong Kong, the General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection, and Quarantine said in a statement. 
When ingested, the chemical metabolizes into the "date-rape" drug gamma hydroxy butyrate, also known as GHB. which can cause breathing problems, loss of consciousness, seizures, drowsiness, coma and death. 
Millions of unite; of the popular toys, which are sold as Aqua Dots in the United States and as Bindm~z in Australia, were recalled in those countries as well as Britain. Malaysia, Singapore and elsewhere this past week after children began falling sick from swallowing the toy's bead-like parts. 

Uneven week ends with more drops 
NEW YOHK -Wall Street finished a turbulent week with another huge drop Friday after major banks warned of further losses on their debt portfolios, raising investor concerns that the credit market slump shows no sign of abating. The Dow Jones industrial average fell more than 220 points. 
Bank of America Corp., .II>Morgan Chase & Co. and Wachovia Corp. all said the ongoing crndit crisis will cause another round of heavy losses during the fourth quarter. Financial insti­tutions took big hits during the last quarter as lossns from subprime mortgages hurt their bal­ance sheets. and these three companies were just the latest to report bad news that sent stocks lower. 
BofA said continued "market dislocations," induding those related to securities it owns that are backed by loans, will all'ect its fourth-quar­ter n1sults. The bank did not provide an esti­mate of how large the impact will bn. JPMorgan said difficult conditions may cause a fourth­quartnr writndown, but did not say how much.

Broadway shut down by strikes 
Stagehands strike over job cuts, shutting down two dozen plays and musicals 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK Producers and theater owners say they're just looking for a fair agree­ment that wouldn't force them to hire extra work­ers they don't need. 
Stagehands counter by declaring their union "is open to exchanges on work rules and other areas," but will absolute­ly refuse any plan that would cut jobs. 
Therein lies the seem­ingly unbridgeable gap that has shut down most of Broadway, closing such well-known shows as "Wicked," "The Phantom of the Opera" and "Hairspray" as well as newer productions such as the Kevin Kline "Cyrano de Bergerac" and Disney's "The Little Mermaid," which was in previews and hadn't even officially opened.

Worry about hiring solely Catholics 
A recent Observer article ("Professors discuss hiring," Nov. 8) reported a "broad sense of disquiet [among the faeulty] surrounding the idea of hiring with religious affiliation in mind" and quoted the chair of the Faeulty Senate as saying that "faeulty members ... are worried that [by trying to rnspond to the decline in Catholic faculty] the University will move away from hiring solely on academic merit." It seems to me that the provost and the president-like the diverse faeulty eommittee that recently produced a helpful report on strategies for Catholic hiring-have always been dear on this erueial point: The University's goal is and should be to eultivate, identity, hirn and recruit Catholic f'aeulty-and non-Catholie faculty who embrace Notn~ Dame's mission-who are, by every sound measure of "merit," out­standing. The goal is not, should not be <md never has been to settle for see­<md-ra.te scholars who happen to be Catholie or to denigrate the achieve­numL'> and eontributions of non­Catholic faculty. Notre Dame aspirns not only to hiw oul'itanding Catholie scholars, but also to increase the eth­nic, gender and soeioeeonomie diversi­ty of' il'> faculty. 
This aspiration, however, is not seen as cause for worry that "the University will move away from hiring solely on academic merit." Similarly, a eoncen­trated etli.>rt to deepen Notre Dame's Catholie identity through faculty hiring need not triggnr "disquiet" about the University's commitment to excellence. Indeed, there are good reasons to expect, and recent high-profile hires eonlirm, that it is precisely by empha­sizing that whieh makes Notre Dame

distinctive that the University will be able to attract and retain increasingly accomplished scholars, Catholic and non-Catholic alike. Certainly, the mere fact that a certain percentage of a uni­versity's faculty (or studHnt body) self­identified as Catholic would hardly guarantee that it retained a meaningful and rich Catholic identity. No one should imagine that maintaining a pre­ponderance of Catholic faculty would complete the hard, rewarding and important work of really being a Catholic university, in a broad, indusive and critieally engaged way. 
At the same time, none of us should fi>rget that Notre Dame is interesting, and mattors because and only to tho extent that it is-in reality and not just in its history -a Catholic university. It is not enougl1 that there is at Notrn Dame a thriving Campus Ministry, an inspiring Center for Social Concerns and world-renowned individual sehol­ars who focus on specifieally "Catholic" topies. Nor is it nnough that Notrn Dame works visibly-as all universi­ties should -to allnviate poverty and promote social justice. Certainly. more than Catholie faculty arn n~quirnd, but Catholie faeulty are required. Certainly, elli.>rL'> to identify and hire Catholic fac­ulty should be responsible and earnful. not dumsy or naive. Given all the givens, the task is not an easy one. 
Still, the fact remains: Without a community of Catholic scholars, work· ing in a wide range of disciplines, Notre Dame would not be meaningfully Catholic, and therefore would not mat­ter.

Catholic staff for Catholic university 
As the Observer of Nov. 8 ("Prof(Jssors dis­cuss hiring"), poinL'> out, tho Provost's oflke ha...<> issued a report on the hiring of Catholic faeulty members. The provost and many oth­ers (University President Father John Jenkins, for example) are eoneerned, naturally enough, with the "Catholic eharaeter" of Notre Dame -or maybe the way to put it is that they are eoncerned with the way in whieh Notre Dame fulfills il<> mission a..<; a Catholic university. They think (1 l it's very mueh worth having a Catholic university, (2l that such a university has a mission, (3) that iL<> mission is not the same as that of' a seeular university (the University of' Michigan, for example), and (4l that iL'> l'ullillment of' that mission has sometl1ing to do with the propor­tion of Catholic faculty on board. 
Although I am not mysnll' Catholic, I mostly agree with them on thesn poinL'>. Notn~ Dame is a wonderful university, and certainly part of iL'> wonderfulness has to do with il'> being Christian, and indned Catholic. I think my own department-philosophy-js a splen­did departm<mt, and I'm dnlightnd to bP part of' it; part of what is splendid about it is il'i eonnnetion with Christianity and spncifkally Catholicism.

Well, what's "thn right kind" of !hculty? Surely this will inelude at least the sort of fae­ulty member that can eontribute to the Notn~ Dame's mL<>sion as a Catholic university. Clearly not all faculty members who ean do that are Catholics; equally dearly, not all Catholics ean do that. So aiming at a certain proportion of Catholic faculty is at best a bit of' a blunt instrument; but something in that neighborhood certainly seems right. 
A<:eording to the same Observer piece, on Nov. 7 the Faeulty Snnate turned iL'> attention to the Provost's report: "Faculty members are worried that in trying to rnetify this situation, the university will move away from hiring solely on academic merit." 
But if there is anything at all to the whole notion of a special mission fi.lr a Catholie uni­versity and lilr Notre Dame, and if the liu·.ulty is in some important way involved in l'ullilling this mission, won't it be p<~rfectly obvious that the university shouldn't hire solely on the basis of aeademie merit? Academic merit is of eourse crueial; it is of' utmost importance. But it can't be the whole shooting mateh. Not, at least, if Notre Damn really does have any kind ofspecial mission as a Catholic universi­ty. If it does have sueh a mission, then obvi­ously another kind of qualification that must be eonsidnred, in prospedive new !heulty, L'i ability to eon tribute to the f'ullillment of that mission and interest in doing so. 
The problem, of eourse, is to specify morn preeisely and in detail just what thn mi'ision of' this university is. and what that spndfication means for the various divisions and depart­ment<> of the University. That's thn rnally important question for Notre Dame (and one besides which the lilrtunes or misfi.Jrtunes of the football team pales into insignificance).

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Debate about Victory March's lyrics continues 
Notre Dame-Patris? 
My brother and fellow Notre Dame alum recently e-mailed me the link to the letter written by Erin and Caity Schneeman regarding the gender­exclusive Victory March ("Reconsidering the Victory March," Oct. 30). "A fun read," he headlined the subject. Indeed, I chuckled as I started down the letter. I could picture the scene in my mind vividly: Two women incensed at the omission of "daughters" in the Victory March, then marching of!' (to The Observer!) to pen their "new idea" that the Victory March is not gender-inclusive! New idea? Hardly. I recalled the very same debate when I was a student in the early '90s. Like the Schneemans. I too belted out "sons and daughters" at a football game. I am &westruck that two highly educated Notre Dame women didn't real­ize, as I did the first time I tried it, that changing the words to a song (although amusing) didn't change a thing. At the end of the day, I knew who I was as a Notre Dame woman whether or not a song declared me as sueh. And, after all these years of hearing and singing "sons," I still know who I am. There are much bigger battles to fight in this world. 
It bothers me that this kind of energy isn't spent on worthier subjects. In fact, if that was all there was to the letter, I would have finished my chuckle and gone on with my day. Unfortunately, the Schneemans made one last comment that is worth my energy and should have caught the attention of all sons and daughters who read it: "What a shame it is that ... female students have to raise their hands on 'her,' which refers to Our Lady, and not to the women of Notre Dame." The real shame is on these two women who feel forced to raise their hands to Our Lady. In their so­called quest for equality, they carelessly elevated themselves above the greatest woman of all, the Holy Mother of God! As a woman, Catholic and proud alumna of Notre Dame, I am embarrassed that fellow Notre Dame women would write such an insult. If we're all this insecure about our gender, and quite sadly, this insensitive to the Divine, let's change the name of our great University to Notre Dame-Patris."

Weis should pay 
Another home loss for the Irish. The total now stands at six for the season. In reality, the first Darner-comprised team to win inside the House That Hoekne Built this fall might be the winner of the Interhall Football Championship. We can watch that game for free, unlike the games of our Division I team, which cost each Notre Dame student $217 for the season. As a linanee major, I view this as a bad investment. In business, people do not continue to invest in an entity that does not produce positive returns. Approximately 11 ,000 students purchase a student ticket booklet each sea­son. Current prices dictate that the student body spends roughly $2.4 million per season on football tickets. I would like Charlie Weis to regain our trust­like a fund director offering incentives-by paying for our tickets next sea­son. His annual eontract, estimated to be in the $2 million range, ideally fits this cost structure. What do you say, Charlie?

Crack down on drunk driving 
Everyone knows that danger is inherently a part of driving. However, some people make choices that drastically increase the risk to others on the roads. In my opinion, and in the eyes of the law, drunk drivers really are criminals. 
Drunk driving is not a "mistake." It is a choice. A drunk driver (sometimes underage) chooses to drink alcohol and then get behind the wheel of a car. I am sick of excuses. Call a eab or stay where you are. There is absolutely no excuse for drunk driving, and in my opinion, neither Notre Dame nor Saint Mary's do enough to punish students who receive a DUI on or off campus. Fines and community service are not enough. I believe that all three schools need to partner up with the South Bend and Mishawaka police to create a registry that alerts the schools when a student receives a DUI. That student should then be expelled from the University or College, just as he or she should be for committing any other heinous crime. 
Drunk driving is not a joke, so we need to stop treating it like it is. Students who make the ridiculously unintelligent choice to drive drunk and gravely endanger the lives of those around them and innocent people in other cars must be punished justly. I urge the schools in this area to serious­ly reevaluate their polides on off-earn pus DUis and institute a much more strict policy.

Lyric change long overdue 
A few weeks ago, I read a letter in The Observer ("Original version cherished," Nov. 1) that argued that we should not change the Notre Dame Fight Song to include both genders because the song, as is, represents "tradition" and that (obvious­ly) the University of Notre Dame was founded in 1842 as an all-male school. As a professor here for more than 20 years, I would like to say we definitely should change the lyrics of the fight song (and that we are way overdue in doing so). 
First, despite the faet that Notre Dame was traditionally an all-male university, it did become eo-ed, with Father Hesburgh's help and instigation, in the 1970s. The change in allowing women to attend neces­sitated many other structural and intellec­tual changes. For example, we built female dorms. More than that, some "traditional­ly" male dorms (such as Farley, where Father Malloy stayed as an undergraduate, but in which my own daughter stayed from 2000-2002) beeame female dorms. And new traditions were born. For example, at the dorm orientation for my daughter, I met a freshman female who was a legacy of that dorm: her mother had lived in Farley during her own undergraduate years. 
Arguing that we must keep things "as they are" (or, really, "as they were") is spe­cious. "Traditionally," the United States of America only granted full "equality" (specifically, in terms of the right to vote), to white, land-owning males. Our constitu­tion relegated African-Americans to being 3/5 human, Native Americans were dis­missed as "savages" and women weren't considered at all. But our country expand­ed ethically and extended full civil rights to African-American males, then females and ultimately people of all religions and races. Obviously, "tradition" didn't count-unless it was the deeper, abiding tradition of advocating freedom and inclusion (precise­ly what Notre Dame has done by eventually admitting minorities and women as well). 
Clearly, our constitution's words were changed with Amendments. A song cannot be changed in that way. However, its lyrics can be readily changed to reflect the spirit of inclusion that began many decades ago. The change is simple. The current lyrics have a certain number of syllables whose stresses fall on certain counts: "while her loyal sons are marching onward to victo­ry!" Replacing "sons are marching" with "sons and daughters" keeps the exact num­ber of syllables and stresses. Changing "onward to victory" to "march on to victo­ry" does the exact same thing. No need to change the rhythm. No awkward holds or pauses. Just a simple change reflecting the spiritual change in a place that has been, even since I came here, increasingly com­mitted to genuine "Catholicity" in its Catholic vision.

could never be like that. 
It's unfortunate because in order to secure this ideology we go after others and their appearances -so we detach, we categorize and we judge to protect ourselves. I am OK. I am normal. 
Today there are repercussions for preju­dice against race, gender and religion in our society. Yet what isn't recognized is this dis­criminatory attitude many Americans hold toward what others look like and those who may have weight issues. 
This is unfortunate because obesity is on the rise in America. Yet, so is this aggres­sively rude attitude towards people who are different. Do you see a problem? 
I remember learning in my general psy­chology class last year that the brain auto­matically judges the better-looking person as nicer. We seem to have this innate idea that external equals internal. 
There have been studies where people put on fat suits and go out with hidden cameras to see what reactions they get. The result is they get pushed around on the subway or laughed at and judged right in front of their faces. 
People go to jail or lose their jobs for dis­criminating against others and treating them in demoralizing and disrespectful fash­ions. Yet people on the other end of the spectrum, trying to get the job, may never get the opportunity to work for an important business because the interviewer judges them as lazy, uncontrolled and maybe even stupid. 
People are financially and emotionally punished for not making the same choices. Why aren't there laws for this type of dis­crimination? 
Obesity has been labeled as a disease and I really don't think we see an obese person the same way as someone with cancer. Both are diseases, yet I can't think of anyone in their right mind making fun of some woman who just came out of chemotherapy with her hair stripped away. 
It may sound like I'm a hippie or a flower child, but I really do believe that life is about being happy. This means loving other peo­ple, not bringing them down. But a lot of times we believe that if we bring someone down we rise higher. 
So what are we to do? 
Judgment is part of our reaction to things that are different, myself included. Yet, when we act on it, it becomes a problem. 
Everyone is entitled to their thoughts and their ideas. It becomes an issue when we make rash decisions based on our own fears and insecurities.

By RYAN RAFFIN Scene Writer 

Pretentious is a word that seems to get tossed around fairly often when describing post-hardcore outfit Thrice. After naming its 2005 effort "Vheissu" in reference to Thomas Pynchon's novel "V.," use of the word only increased. 
So when Thrice announced in late 2006 that it was recording four EPs, each the­matically connected to one of' Aristotle's lour elemenl'> (fire, water, earth and air), the haters had plenty of fuel. I low dare Thrice attempt something so ambitious? llave they no care f()r the fans? Luckily, the band paid no attm1tion and produced tlu~ excellent first entry of the two-part set, lengthily titled "The Alchemy Index, Vols. I & II: Fire & Water." 
This is admittedly a little confusing; tl1e first two EPs are packaged together, but they are not meant to be heard as one album. Each has 6 songs that are lyrically and musically distinct, two different sets of 20 odd minutes that go by too fast for the listener to ever tire of. 
The "Fire" EP is what you might guess based on its name. The louder, angrier side of Thrice, it's slightly reminiscent of their hardcore punk roots. Huge sounding choruses are everywhere -this is stuff that sounds good in a stadium. "Firebreailier" starl'i things off witl1 some of the heaviest rill's the band has ever recorded and with front man Dustin Kensrue singing an anthemic verse. The song even closes with a choir. 
Hight off the bat, the listener is given the rules: This is the new school -expect to hear different things. A programmed beat opens "The Messenger" before exploding into Kensrue's shouting and subsiding again.. It's an ebb and flow, creating one of the best songs the group has recorded. 
The subtle touches and flourishes of electronics are abundant throughout the album. Such ha'i been present in Thrice's sound for a couple of' years now but is best rnalized on "The Alehemy Index." 
Another complaint that has been lev­ellnd at the band n~cently is that lead gui­tarist Teppei Teranishi no longer plays ).,'llitar solos quitn as often as h11 used to. This may be true, but the guitar work here is consistently tightnr and more com­plex than ever before. Kensrue's vocal work is stellar, as usual: lie knows exactly how to sing or shout in order to best lit the song. A'i the EP dosns out on thn powerlul "The Flanw Deluge,'' it's tough not to bP left breathless. These six songs are so strong that it's tough to imagine how tlw "Water" EP can match them. 
Subdued from the start, "Water" doesn't hit you immediatdy like its counterpart, though it is just as good. The elnctronies and various effecL'> usnd on "Fire" eontin­uc, evident immediately upon listnning to first single, "Digital Sea." Keyboards an~ also very important for this EP, as nearly every song utilizes them in some way. Just like thp, eoncept of' flame was central to its counterpart, there is an aquatic motif in the lyrics and music. Unlike "Fire," though, this sounds almost nothing like what Thriee ha'i done before. Melodic and tranquil, the band l'ully succeeds in creat­ing an oceanic soundscape. 
The group's inl'luences really show through here: Hadiohead comparisons are inevitable, but wait lor "Night Diving" lor some very Pelican-nsque guitar work. The song shines, and normally you wouldn't expect a six-minute instrumental to grip the listener quite like this does. The whole EP seems like Thrien's interpretation of how alternative music should sound, almost liko a challonge to othnr bands. If "Fire" is Thrice proving tlwy can make music as loud and pownrl'ul as bel'ore, "Water" is the band showing that they ean do whatnver else thoy want as well. 
A lot of fans want the old Thrice back. Thny want to go back to tho days of' l~tst,

hard and loud. Sorry to dis­appoint, but it's not hap­pening anytime soon. "The Akhemy Index" is Thrice's latest progression, showing that the band is (:apable of creating any music they can think of', and doing it well.

Running back's 272 all-purpose yards carry Air Force to victory, hand ND ninth loss 
By BILL BRINK Spons Writer 
The frustration Notre Dame has experienced all season can be summarized with one kick. 
When defensive end Trevor Laws booted the penalty flag after an ollsides call during the extra point attempt of Air Force's fifth touchdown of the Falcons' 41-24 win over the Irish, he symbolized the team's dissatisfaction with this historically bad season. 
Chad llall, who led the Air Force offense, caused much of Laws' frustration. Hall rushed 32 times for 142 yards. l-Ie also caught two passes for 31 yards, had 99 return yards and aver­aged 7.4 yards per touch in the game. 
"lie's a competitor, he competes out there so much and runs so hard," Laws said. "He wants to get as many yards as he can every play; he's out there loving what he's doing." 
Air Force improved to 8-3 on the season, coach Troy Calhoun's first with the Falcons. Notre Dame dropped to an all-time worst 1-9. 
Irish freshman quarterback Jimmy Clausen had his best game of the season, completing 22-of­40 passes for 246 yards and three touchdowns. He didn't have the help of his receivers, however. On the first play from scrimmage, after Clausen hit tight end John Carlson for a 28-yard completion, Carlson fumbled, giving Air Force the ball on its own 42-yard line.

Football teams have 11 players on the field at any given time. Each one has a job to do on every play. 
When a team is playing well, those 11 players can seem like one smooth unit, moving seam­lessly together down the field. 
That has not happened this season for Notre Dame. 
It doesn't have to be a total team break­down. A lot of times, especially reeenlly, the problem has been only one or two players. 
And they're different players on every play. 
But this is a team game, and if just one player fails to his job. a play can break down. 
Take a couple examples from the 41-24 loss to Air Force on Saturday:

Force touchdown. 
McNeil was fooled by the misdi­rection, so his mistake is under­standable. But some other mental mistakes came despite several rep­etitions in practice. 
+ Clausen was blindsided two times in the first half because run­ning backs didn't step up and block outside blitzers. But coach Charlie Weis said the Irish worked on piek­ing up that exact blitz package in practice. 
"We said, 'This is the blitz they run, and the lineman's going to get the first guy and the back's going to get the second guy," he said. "But it didn't happen that way, and the quarterback got hit." 
So what is causing these prob­lems? 
Sometimes as many as 1 0 players are doing their jobs effectively, but at least one man is making a physi­cal mistake, getting fooled by the opposition or forgetting what the team worked on in practiee. 
Part of the answer is youth. The imbalance toward the younger classes on this team's roster has

Even the players themselves are dumbfounded. 
"Look at the coaches' pedigrees," tight end John Carlson said. "They're good teachers. And the players on the team are students at the University of Notre Dame. You'd think thaf we're all fairly intelligent individuals. But something isn't dicking, and I don't know what it is." 
At least part of the problem is conlidencn. Notre Dame has many contributors that didn't play a lot last year. They've never had suc­cess without Brady Quinn or Jeff Samardzija on the roster. 
The only thing that can cure that is winning. For them, it would be b1~st to start next week against Duke or the week after against Stanford or at least next September against San Diego State. 
And once this season is over, the Irish coaching staff can redouble its efforts to fix this team's problems, eorrect the mistakes and get the 11 players on the field playing like one again. 
ln the meantime, as Carlson said after the game, all this team has to play for is pride. If that pride means that just one person on every play does his job a little bet­ter than he did the play before. then this Notre Dame team might just end the season on a high note and get some momentum for 2008. 
But every player on this tl~am needs to have that pride, bneause at any time, tlwy could bll callnd upon to bn one of those 11 players on the field. 
And it takes all 11 to succeed.

Weis: ''Wegot ourselves a quarterback'' 

By CHRIS HINE Sports Editor 
After weeks of ineffective performanc­es, Notre Dame freshman quarterback Jimmy Clausen, who started for the first time since Notre Dame's 27-13 loss to Boston College on Oct. 13, had the best game of his young college career Saturday. 
The highly touted signal-caller threw for 246 yards, three touchdowns and no intorceptions on 22-of-40 passing. 
"Jimmy did a very, very good job in the second half stepping up and throwing the ball." Irish coach Charlie Weis said. "I'd say if there was one thing you walked out of that game saying, [it would be, I 'We got ourselves a quarter­back.'" 
Weis had benched Clausen the last two gamos in part because junior quarter­back Evan Sharpley was able to move the ball downfield easier and put more points on the board than Clausen, but Clausen showed the ability to sustain long drives and lead Notre Dame into the end zone against the Falcons ­especially in the second half. 
Clausen threw for only 54 yards in the first half on 5-for-11 passing, but one of terback. completion percentage could have been those completions was his touchdown "He shows very great composure for a higher, but Notre Dame dropped more pass to tight end John Carlson to tie the young guy, a freshman in college. He's passes against the Falcons than it had in score at 10-10 into that drive," Weis said. "Usually with any game this season by Weis' count,

gery over the summer, and during his first starts at Notre Dame, opposing defenses hit Clausen as much as-if not more than -any quarterback in college football. 
Air Force sacked Clausen six times, with multiple hits coming to Clausen's blind side thanks to a blitz scheme that involved Air Force bringing two defend­ers around the left edge of the offense line -a scheme Weis said Notre Dame worked on protecting all week in prac­tice. Despite Notre Dame's preparation, the Falcons were still able to get to Clausen. 
After the game, Weis compared the volume of treatment in Notre Dame's post-game locker room to a mobile army hospital but said Clausen was not being treated for anything serious. 
"Other than bumps and bruises, there's no injury," Weis said of Clausen. "He's not one of the people in the MASH unit, and he got probably got hit as many times as anyone, and that's an encouraging thing."

Kamara sits because ofacademic reasons 
By BILL BRINK Sports Writer 
Notre Dame's loss dropped the Irish to an all-time worst 0-6 at home this season. Notre Dame had never before lost six straight games at home. 
If the Irish lose to Duke next week. it will be the first sea­son since 1887 in which Notre Dame lost all its home games. That year, the Irish were 0-1. 
Kamara out for academic reasons 
Freshman wide receiver Duval Kamara missed Saturday's game due to aca­demic reasons. Irish coach Charlie Weis said Kamara 
missed too much practice time to play because the issues were not resolved until the end of the week. 
''I'm never going to be a hypocrite when it comes to academics; academics are always going to take the fore­front, and he understood it very clearly that that's the way it's going to be," Weis said. 
Maust takes over punting job 
Sophomore Eric Maust took over the punting job from sen­ior Geoff Price after Price strained a muscle in his leg in practice Thursday. 
Calhoun calls for different officiating crews 
Air Force coach Troy Calhoun said he hoped inter­conference games will use officiating crews from a third conference to avoid "putting officials in a bad position." 
"We gotta get to a point where you go play a game where there's no residue at all," Calhoun said. "There are no visages. At some point, can that maybe occur? If Oregon goes to play at Michigan, then use the Mountain West Conference?" 
Taylor honored for athletic, civic excellence 
Notre Dame presented for­mer offensive line All­American Aaron Taylor, who graduated in 1994 and played in the NFL, with the Harvey G. Foster award for athletic endeavors and civic or University excellence. 
Taylor has established LegendsOfSouthBend.com, which is a for-profit "social­profit" limited liability corpo­ration that will donate money to create a scholarship fund at the University. 
Former ADs commemorated. 
The University dedicated plaques honoring past athletic directors on the North Tunnel Plaza north of Notre Dame Stadium's tunnel entrance. Jesse Harper, Knute Rockne, Elmer Layden, Hugh Devore, Frank Leahy, Edward "Moose" Krause, Gene Corrigan and Dick Rosenthal all had plaques in their names placed on the wall around the plaza. Corrigan and Rosenthal them­selves, along with family members representing the others, received replicas of the plaques on the field before the game.

AVONDALE, Ariz. ­Jimmie Johnson took com­mand of the Nextel Cup championship Sunday, win­ning at Phoenix International Raceway to open a daunting lead over teammate Jeff Gordon in the race to the title. 
Johnson, the defending Nextel Cup champion, heads to next week's season finale in Homestead, Fla., with a comfortable 86-point lead over Gordon. He needs to finish just 18th or better to become the first driver since Gordon in 1997 and 1998 to win consecutive titles. 
"It's over. It's over," con­ceded Gordon, the four-time series champion. "Even if we win it, it's because they have problems. While we'll accept it, we don't want to do it that way. 

"Those guys have flat-out killed everybody. And you've got to give credit where credit is due." 
Johnson was subdued in Victory Lane, and refused to claim the title. 
"Homestead is going to be a stressful weekend. We've got seven more days, I'm just going to try to keep my mind clear and focus on the things we need to do," Johnson said. "This is kind of where we were last year. We just have to go down there and be smart and see how it shakes out."

IN BRIEF 

Riots ensue after soccer fan 
inadvertently killed by police 
ROME -A police officer accidentally shot and killed a soccer fan Sunday while trying to break up a fight by a Tuscan highway between supporters of rival teams, authorities said. Enraged by the killing, hundreds of fans rioted in Rome, attacking a police station. 
Fans stormed the yard of a police station near the Rome's Olympic Stadium, hurled stones at passing police cars, and smashed windows at the nearby Italian Olympic Committee headquarters. 
Hundreds of youths, many with their faces covered by scarves and ski masks, dragged metal barricades and trash bins to block off one end of a bridge spanning the Tiber near the sta­tion. The rioters smashed a window in the police station and set a police vehi­cle on fire inside the gate. 
Sky TG24 TV showed images of flames from what it said was a bus set on fire near the barracks. 
had a tire rub after making contact with Kevin Harvick, and finished a disappointing lOth. 
It was a crushing per­formance on a day when Johnson raced to his fourth consecutive victory and lOth of the season. He became the first driver to win four straight in a sea­son since Gordon did in 1998, and his season victory total is the most since Gordon won 13 races that same year. 
"They are as good as any group I've seen, including Jetr in his heyday when he was winning 10 races a year," said 2003 champion Matt Kenseth, who fmished third.

Mickelson overcomes ~nalty
strokes to win in playo-rf 
SHANGJ-W, China -Phil Mickelson glanced at the gleaming trophy on his left, rolled his eyes and broke into a sheepish grin. 
"I cannot believe I'm here as the champion right now," he said. 
Here's why. 
Lefty overcame six penalty strokes in the fmal round, blew a three-shot lead with seven to play, and still won Sunday's BSBC Champions tournament on the second hole of a three-way play­off with Englishmen Ross Fisher and Lee Westwood. 
The victory in Asia's richest tourna­ment earned Mickelson $833,000. It was his fourth victory this season. 
Fisher, ranked No. 141, had a one­stroke lead going to the 72nd hole. It seemed Mickelson would need several clutch shots to at least force a playoff. Instead, he dumped his long approach into water off the right edge of the green.

Johnson to join Hendrick Motorsports when the team expanded to four cars in 2002, marveled at how strong his protege has been during this championship hunt. It's put it nearly out of reach for Gordon, who dominated the "regular sea­son" and opened a lead of more than 300 points before the field was reset for the Chase. 
"Unless you lead every lap and beat Jimmie Johnson to win the race, we don't have a shot," Gordon said. "We're just coming up short at a crucial time. Those guys have just knocked it out of the ballpark, and it would be tough to beat that even if we were hitting on all eight cylinders." 
Henin wins 25th straight
by topping Sharapova 
MADRID, Spain -Justin Renin fin­ished her record-breaking season unde­feated after Wimbledon. 
She won the Sony Ericsson Championships on Sunday, rallying past Maria Sharapova 5-7, 7-5, 6-3 in the longest three-set final in tournament history. 
The top-ranked Belgian won her lOth title in 2007 and earned $1 million at the season-ending event, becoming the first woman to pass $5 million for a year. 
"What a way to fmish the season," said Benin, who ran into the crowd to hug her coach and family after winning her 39th career title. 
Following a semifmal loss to Marion Bartoli at Wimbledon, Bellin closed the season with 25 straight wins, the longest streak since Venus Williams won 35 in a row in 2000. The record is 38 by Steffi Graf, whose string began after a loss in the 1989 French Open final.

Irish to battle Long Island University 
By CHRIS HINE Sports Editor 
The l'irst few weeks of the college basketball season saw some high-profile teams lose games that should havB bBen easy wins.

Notre Dame had a little troubl11 of its own Wednesday before ultimately defeating Division II opponent St. Edward's 71-56 and will tan­gle with Long Island University tonight at 7:30 in thn Joyce Center to officially tip off the 2007-08 season. 
In Notre Dame's win over St. Edward's, the llilltoppers wnre within eight points with fewer than 10 minutes to play bnfore Notre Dame pulled away. But before the Irish put the game out of reach, coach Mike Brey had Ohio State and Michigan States' losses on his mind. And just because teams like Long Island and St. Edward's look like easy wins on paper, doesn't mean they lack good players capable of playing at a high level, Brey said. 
''I'm telling you when 1St. Edward's] cut it to six or seven in thn seeond hall', I thought of Findlay and Grand Valley," Brny said. ''I'm telling you thnrn's good players every­whnn and 1St. Edward's] was a good team; they were well­coached and they were on a high."

"I like how we played in the second half of [against St. Edward's] because it became a Big East, grind-it-out game and we madn free throws, we got the ball to our low-post guy and we defended in the half-court pretty well," Brey said. 
Irish forwards Hob Kurz and Luke Ilarangody, the latter of whom missed Notre Dame's first game against St. Ambrose with a torn ligament in his thumb, combined for 30 points and 17 rebounds against St. 
Edward's. 
The Long Island Blackbirds' leading returning scorer from last year is forward Eugene Kotorobai, who averaged 9. 7 points and 6.5 rebounds per game. 
Irish sophomore guard Tory Jackson wasn't himself against St. Edward's because he was battling the flu, Brey said. but Jackson still did a lot to help out the Irish. 
"I thought he really fought through it. In the second half, he bounced back," Brey said. "He made free throws, he made defensive plays, to help us win the basketball game."

Irish svveep earns team spotin Big East tourney 
By PAT O'BRIEN Sports Writer 
Feeding ofT the momentum 
from two wins last we1~kend's , 
Notre Dame defeated Cincinnati 
(18-1 0, 9-5 Big East) and No. 17 
Louisville (20-5, B-1) to secure 
a spot in the Big East tourna­
ment. 
"It feels unreal. Wn just playnd 
out of our minds," sophomore 
oulo.;idn hitter Megan Fesl said. 
With the two weekend victo­
ries, Notm Dame earned the No. 
4 seed in the Big East yourna­
nwnt. Then~ will be a quick 
rematch when the Irish face 
l"ifth-snednd Cincinnati on 
Friday at II a.m. in Milwaukee, 
Wis. 
"I know that our confidence 
has gone up so high, and we 
know the task that we havP 
alwad of' us. Wn'ro going to 
work really hard this wonk at 
practice to prepare for this 
weekend." Fnsl said. 
Tho Irish ( n-12, 9-5 Big East) heat tlw Bean:ats 3-1 (31-33, :~0-23. 30-28, :m-201 in a matrh that featun~d a noisy crowd of 7,523 fans in the Joyco Cent11r -the snmnd largest gathering in the program's history. Notre I>arne rmtde four service errors in the first game but benelitml from a lark of' lkarcat scoring in gamn two. Cincinnati only hit .054 in tlw snmnd game. 
Tlw Bnarcats oll"ense hnated up 11arly in tlw third game until tho Irish came up with big blocks. NotrP Damn was trailing 23-18 whon it used teamwork to rip ofT a 12-5 run and take a 1:rudal 2-1 lead. N'tnr that. the Irish made sure that the Bearcats would not make a eomeback and hit .471 in game four. 
Junior middle blocker .Justine Stremiek scored a team high 16 kills for the Irish while Fesl, freshman middle blocker Kellin Sciacca, and senior captain Adrianna Stasiuk all recorded double digit kills with 14, 11 and 11, respectively. Senior setter Ashley Tarutis topped the team with 51 assislo.;, while notching six kills and six digs. Stasiuk topped the team with 14 digs. 
Cincinnati was led defensively by sophomom libero Jaime Frey -she had a game-high 17 digs. Freshman setter Annie Fesl, sis­ter of Notre Dame's Mogan Fesl, reeorded 43 helpers while sen­ior outside hitter .Jenny Custer led with 16 kills. 
Notre Dame knocked down Louisville :~-I (:~0-28, 30-16, 25­:m. 30-281 to ruin what would havn bmm an unblmnishnd sea­son in the Big East for the 
Cardinals. It was the final home 
game for the Irish, and Notre 
Dame's two senior players -
Stasiuk and Tarutis -were 
honored before the game. 
Before the game, Stremick 
played the National Anthem for 
the seniors -and the crowd ­
on her saxophone. 
"I was really involved in music 
when I was in high school. I did 
a lot of band, choir, piano kind 
of things," Stremick said. "It was 
actually something I loarned in 
high school. Someone gave me 
kind of a jazzy rendition of the 
National Anthem. I actually play 
it once a year here -usually 
Senior Night. Ashley Tarutis 
rnqunsted that I do it." 
After winning a closely-con­tested first game, Notre Dame found ilo.;elf going back and forth in game two. The score was 15­1:~ in favor of the Irish at the media timeout, and then they played to near perfection, capi­talizing on Cardinals' mistakes and dosing out with a 15-3 run. 
After a few early ties in the third ganw, the Cardinals pulled away and led the Irish by five throughout most of tho second half. Tho Cardinals continued their great play into game four, and it had appoared that Irish might slide. 

The turning point, however, came when the Irish wore down I 2-9. Stasiuk was serving to only two backcourt recipients from tho Cardinals and blasted three sorvice aces in a row. From thorn, the game was tied and the Irish went on to squeak out the win in game four. 
"We have a bunch of great athletes on our team," Fesl said. "We went into the match believ­ing that we could win. We were in a good mind frame, and 1werythingjust seemod to click." 
Both seniors ended their final home games with double-dou­bles. Tarutis had 58 assists and 11 digs, while Stasiuk scored 11 kills and 11 digs (her 19th this season). Fest was the leading scorer of the game -she racked up 21 kills. 
"Everyone worked off each other, and there was great pass­ing, great setting and really intelligent game play," Fes1 said. "I think that helped my game just working ofT my teammates." 
Louisville was led by junior oul'lide hitter Jana Matiasovska, senior middle blocker Svetlana Dukule, and sophomore outside hitter Justine Landi. They recorded 16, 15 and 11 kills, respectively while Landi added a team-high 14 digs.

ND CROSS COUNTRY 
Smyth qualifies for NCAA meet 
By CHRIS DOYEN Sporrs Writer 
Irish junior Patrick Smyth was the class of the field at the 2007 Great Lakes Regional meet at Indiana University on Saturday. 
He finished his 10 kilometers in 30:22.44, beating his closest com­petitor, Matt Withrow of Wisconsin, by nearly 16 seconds and securing his spot as an incli­vidual in next Saturday's NCAA championships in Terre Haute, Ind. Smyth also qualified for the NCAA championships last year on his way to earning All-America honors. 
Smyth became only the second runner in Notre Dame history to win the regional meet, joining current volunteer assistant coach Luke Watson, who accomplished the feat in 2000. 
Joining Smyth in Terre Haute will be senior Jake Watson, who finished fourth overall with a time of 30:46.98. 
Unfortunately for the Irish, however, they fmished third of 29 teams with 76 points, eight points behind Wisconsin and Michigan, who tied for first. Only the top two teams from each regional meet receive automatic berths to the NCAA championships, and the Irish will find out today if they will receive an at-large bid. The NCAA distributes 13 at-large bids, and the consistent perform­ance of the Irish puts them in a good position to receive one of them. 
All Irish scorers fmished in the top 35 overall. Following Smyth and Watson were sophomore Jake Walker in 14th (31:14.09), senior Brett Adams in 22nd 
(31 :29.40) and senior Mike Popejoy at No. 35 (31 :49.67). 
On the women's side, Miehigan State (60 points) and Miehigan (63 points) finished first and sec­ond and earned automatic bids to the NCAA championships. The Irish finished 11th of 30 partici­pating teams with 293 points. 
Senior Ann Mazur led the way for the Irish, finishing her six kilo­meters No. 26 overall with a time of 21:52.68. Nicole Edwards of Michigan won the individual title, fmishing in 20:30.76. 
Hounding out the scoring for the Irish women were junior Becca Bauman in 43rd (22:11.75), sophomore Emily Wauford in 53rd (22:23.83), freshman Abby Higgins in 79th 
(22:59.62) and sophomore Beth Tad in 94th (23:09.13). 
The women's season is likely over, but Smyth and Watson-and possibly the rest of the men ­will be back in action on Nov. 19 at the same course they traversed on Oct. 13 in the Pre-National Meet. Then, Smyth and Watson finished fifth and 17th overall, respectively, in a highly competi­tive field that featured many of the runners that will compete in the NCAA championships.

But the early going this year has been slowed by a top­heavy schedule with several mid-week games that severely limited practice time for a team playing freshmen and sophomores up and down the lineup. 
Pearce, a junior who is sec­ond in the nation in minutes played behind Michigan's Billy Sauer, surrendered only four goals in two games to a Miami offense that has averaged five goals per game while missing its top goal-scorer from last season in senior Nathan Davis. 
"I give Jordan Pearce a lot of credit," Jackson said. "It's the first timu he's played in that kind of game, and he handled it extremely well both nights." 
Davis scored Miami's only goal in the HedHawks 2-1 loss Friday night in his !irst game back after he was injured in the season opener. The goal came in the second period and was the only puck Pearce allowed to go past him on 33 shots. 
The Irish took a 2-0 lead in the first period on Christian Hanson's second goal of the season and Dan Kissel's first after missing time earlier in the season with a groin injury. Jackson called Kissel's tally "a great second-effort goal," after the sophomore took the puck out from a defender's skates before he beat Miami goalie Jeff Zatkoff. 
"We have to get production from our entire lineup," Jackson said. "When we're playing four lines, we're a bet­ter team. I think that we have depth in our third and fourth line, where [those lines] can contribute." 
On Saturday night the Irish found themselves down 3-0 after two periods, and Zatkoff stopped 27 of Notre Dame's 28 shots to split the series. 
"Miami was not going to be beat twice," Jackson said. "They played with a tremen­dous amount of energy. They were skating at full-throttle." 
The RedHawks' Nino Musitelli and Tommy Wingels scored first-period goals, and Pat Cannone added a third in the second to take the three­goal lead. Irish right wing Evan Hankin cut the lead to 3­1 when he jammed a rebound past Zatkoff just over two min­utes into the third period ­and a period after he had to leave the bench to get stitches after a center-ice hit. 
"[Steve Cady) is a loud build­ing, so they got a lot of momentum from that," Jackson said. "As time pro­gressed, our defense got a lit­tle bit tired. I think that even­tually they wore us down in certain parts of the game." 
The Irish will play a home­and-home s"eries this weekend against Western Michigan. The first game will be played Friday night in the Joyce Center.

"Lindsay, I thought especial­ly, really came out fired up," McGraw said. "She was ready to go. I was really happy with the way we shot the ball in the beginning." 
Notre Dame advanced to the second round of the 16-team tournament and will host Western Kentucky Tuesday at 7 p.m. 
Notre Dame took over the game with double-digit scor­ing runs in the first. The Irish jumped out to a 14-2 lead in the first five minutes of the game. After RedHawks senior guard Amanda Jackson hit two free throws, the Irish took off on a five minute, 16-point run. 
Miami went more than eight minutes in the first half with­out a field goal. 
After forward Michele Weynandt's baseline jumper with 17:27 to play in the half, Notre Dame did not allow a field goal until junior guard Jenna Schone came open off a screen and made a jump shot in the lane with 9:11 remain­ing. McGraw attributed the scoring runs and defensive stoutness to improved play in the paint and her bench play­ers. 
"We rebounded a little bit better," McGraw said. "Our transition game was working. We were able to run the floor. I think we were fresh because we were able to sub so fre­quently, and I think that's a big plus for us now, seeing how we can run with a little Mallory hit a buzzer-beating bit of rest." three-pointer from the corner

"We had a little bit of a lull, but we responded," McGraw said. "We got in some serious foul trouble late in the half." 
The Notre Dame bench scored 38 points in the game. Sophomore center Erica Williamson had nine rebounds, and freshman for­ward Devereaux Peters had eight. 
In the last three minutes of the half, Notre Dame returned to its previous level of play and went on a 9-2 run. Senior guard Tulyah Gaines wove her way into the lane for a layup. Sophomore guard Melissa Lechlitner, who had 10 points and six assists, left her defender motionless with a quick spin move and had an open path to the basket. Freshman guard Brittany

Notre Dame played both zone and man defense with success -the Redllawks shot only 2 7. 9 percent from field goal range. 
Schrader was excited about how her team might be per­ceived after the game. 
"I want to know what their players and their coaches say about our team," Schrader said. "Before the game, and now after the game, and I want to see what the differ­ence is. I don't know what they said before game. But I bet it's changed."

Butler's ldt, but the keeper guessed corn~ctly and dove for the stop. Dnlimdors Carrie Dew, Eliso Webor and Lauren Fowlkes all mado thnir attnmpl<>, but in vain. 
Ashley Banks, Kim Bonilla, Carolyn Blank, Sydney Metheny and Lisa DuCote all put their shots past Irish keeper Lauren Karas in the shootout, and the Mountaineers took home the tro­phy. 
The first four shot the ball to Karas' right. but she guessed tho wrong each time. On the last shot, DuCote shot the ball inside the other post. Karas guessed cor­rectly, but her hand came just short of knocking the ball away. 
"I'll have to watch the tape again, but I think certainly there wasn't much effort on the first throe !shots!," Waldrum said. "I think she's trying to get a read, but I think goalkeepers have to just go." 
Butler's first big save came in the first overtime period. Hanks p<L<>sed the ball from the right side to forward Brittany Bock in the middle. Bock slipped past two defenders and took a shot towards the far post, but Butler the second overtime, forward Miehele Weissenhofer's flip-throw landed right in the middle of the six-yard box. A serum ensued, but llanks, Bock and senior Amanda Cinalli could not convert. 
One minute later, Cinalli got around a defender and put a shot towards the far post, but again Butler elevated across the goal and knocked the ball away. 
"I was very pleased with the overtime," Waldrum said. "If we had played that way the entire game, I don't think we would have been in that position." 
The Irish opened the scoring in the 14th minute when f-lanks tapped a dribbling shot past Butler into the net. Midfielder Courtney Rosen chipped the ball into the right side of the box, and Hanks beat Butler and Mountaineers midfielder Greer Barnes to the ball. 
Notre Dame led 1-0 until the 39th minute, when Bonilla took a free kick from the far side. The ball came across the crease and Karas came out to cha<>e it. Blank headed the ball back into the cen­ter of the box, where forward Kiley Harris headed the ball into the center of the net to tie the score at one. 
The Mountaineers had their

"lie's got a great career ahead ol' him," Clark said. " ... In the moment lw is playing a role and he did that lilr us today." 
Notrn Dame held ol'f the Hed Storm filr the rest of the game to pick up its 1Oth shutout of the sea<>on. Senior keeper Chris Cahill had two saves for the Irish, who played stin1-,ry on def{mse through­out the game. Clark said that the entirn t1~am was responsible for th1~ shutout. 
"You defend from the team out," Clark said. "The actual back four was terrific, but the whole team defimded well." 

The back line got a big boost from the return of junior defender Jack Traynor. Traynor had been out ti)r three weeks after fractur­ing his leg in a 3-2 loss to Indiana Oct. 1 7. Doetors removed his hard east early last week, and the leg wa<> ready lilr Sunday's game. 
"It was great having Jack back," Clark said. "To get him back as quickly as that is a tribute to the doctors and to our trainer." 

The St. John's defense, which had allownd only 19 goals in 21 games, matched Notre Dame in the first half, preventing the Irish from controlling the ball or setting up any great scoring chances. Notre Dame had seven shots ­compared to the Hed Storm's two -but was forced to play hopeful long balls to Lapira for most of the near side led forward Deana Everrett, who was unimpeded 10 yards in front of the goal, but the cross was just out of her reach. 
Notre Dame could not control the ball in the air. Keeper kicks and punts routinely went West VIrginia's way, and the Irish could not consistently clear their zone. For the rest of the first half and much of the second, West VIrginia did not give Notre Dame any space to create scoring chances. The Mountaineers closed on breakaways and deflected through-ball attempts. 
"I just felt very much like they were winning every 50/50 loose ball," Waldrum said. "Our mental­ity and our mindset wasn't where it needed to be. We were outhus­tled all over the field. I don't think we matched their intensity." 
Notre Dame increased its inten­sity in the final 10 minutes of reg­ulation. The Irish kept the ball in the attacking third and found open passing lanes to create scor­ing opportunities. With 1:27 left, Hanks sent Weissenhofer a through-ball that was just out of reach. Thirty seconds later, Weissenhofer fired oil' a shot, but Butler made the diving stop.

Monday on ESPNews. Notre Dame entered the weekend with a No. 16 RPI (ratings percentage index, a rating equation that fac­tors in strength of schedule), which is an important selection criteria. 
Waldrum said the team was dis­appointed but realized that their season wasn't over. He wanted his team to focus on the week ahead. 
"Because of our early losses, we're probably not going to have three rounds of easy games like we have in years past," Waldrum said. "We've got to put this one behind us and get ready to go this week and get a week of training in." 
Notre Dame reached the final with a 2-0 win over Georgetown seconds to extend their winning streak to 12 games in their victory over the lloya<>. 
Hanks and Bock combined to score the first goal in the 25th minute. Bock, running down the middle of the field, passed to llanks on the left side. 
Hanks sent the ball back to Bock near the far post, where Bock headed the ball in to put the Irish ahead 1-0. 
Half of Bock's 18 career goals have come on headers. 
Soon after, midfielder Courtney Rosen sent the ball across the box to Rose Augustine, who deflected the ball into the net.

Gray qualifies for nationals 
By MATT GAMBER Sports Writer 
Megan Gray has earned the right to put on her Saint Mary's jersey for one last race. 
With a fourth-place finish at Saturday's Division III Great Lakes Hegional at Calvin College in Grand Hapids, Mich., the senior all-MIM per­former qualified for next Saturday's national meet at Saint Olaf's in Northfield, Minn. 
"Megan's race was solid and fun to watch," coach .Jaekie Bauters 
said of Gray, who advances to nationals for the sec­ond consec­utive year. "I knew she had the top-


five in her Gray before the start, but I didn't want to put that pressure on her." 
Gray carried the Belles as she has all season, but fresh­men Sam Wieczorek (78th place) and Catie Salyer (87th). sophomore Megan MeClowry (104th) and junior Caitlin Brodmerkel (134th) provided a solid supporting east, allowing the Belles to finish 15th out of 36 teams -a five-place improvement over last year's linish.
