"There is no change of the com­manders of the police and the military," the broadcast said. "Any military movements must be under the orders of the chiefofthe revolu­tionary group." 
Four tanks and soldiers from an armored cavalry division took up positions around Government House, where the prime minister's office is located, and blocked off all streets leading to the compound. 
The soldiers refused to talk with reporters. 
Tanks also were seen at the public information department and around the royal palace.

Prem did come under criticism from Arthit late last year when his administration pushed through a devaluation of Thailand's currency, the baht. 
Prem had been designated prime minister by Parliament on Feb. 29, 1979, after Gen. Kriangsak Chamanan resigned from the post.

Many issues are complicating apartheid solution 
The current state of affairs in South Africa has occupied the front pages of our hometown newspapers all summer. The situa­tion lies heavily on the conscience of Americans according to polls, and lawmakers, reacting to the growing public pressure, have called for some sort ofpunitive action by our nation.

Most Americans agree on the necessary eradication ofthe evil system ofapartheid, but how does the world's most powerful democracy pressure one of its strategic allies into internal change? 
There is concern the economic sanctions currently pendingin Washington will hurt the blacks and anger the white government in South Africa all the more, causing a backlash even more severe than the current state of emergency. Unfortunately, President Reagan's policy of "Constructive Engage­ment" has done little more than associate this administration with those "moderate" whites in Pretoria who call for evolutionary change.

realized, that to govern that bit of the Empire 
successfully, it had to make peace in a hurry

blacks from political participation. I still 
remember my rage at that discovery.

might be a different story today. I shudder to

country. It is difficult to escape the idea that continued violence and an eventual revolu­tion, whether successful or unsuccessful, are inevitable. 
Hard-line conservative and liberal Americans have ready-made prescriptions to cure South African ills. It would be so nice to believe that either will be a panacea; however, the interested observer increasingly becomes frustrated the more he learns about the situa­tion. 
Some troubling facts make our dilemma all 
the more perplexing: 

The 
white Afrikaners have been in South Africa for centuries. To say they do not belong in Africa or do not deserve a share ofpower is akin to claiming today's Americans do not have the same rights in what was once Indian territory. Most of the black South Africans are more recent arrivals to the area than the Afrikaners. 

No 
existing government in power ever is going to commit suicide. In calling for one­man/one-vote, the reformers actually are cal­ling for the removal of white authority in South Africa. Although one-man/one-vote is what we as Americans agree is moral and in the spirit of our Constitution, the white government in Pretoria never will concur be­cause in its opinion, this system amounts to political suicide. 


As troubling as it sounds, the establishment oftrue democracy in South Africa involves an overthrow of power, and probably violence and bloodshed. This is repulsive to all ofus. 
Growing 
pressure from the right-wing conservative party in South Africa only delays any attempt at reform by Bntha and the ruling national party. Even more unsettling is the growing membership of several racist­military parties which call for any and all measures to combat reform. They are willing lO use violence to maintain apartheid and their racially segregated society. There are enough administrators near Botha who are in­fluenced by the political strength ofthe right to slow progress and convince him reform only will lead South Africa down a path of "Communism" and disaster. 

The 
blacks in South Africa are not unified in their proposed means for change. Ranging from blacks who work for the government as informers, to those who align themselves with the outlawed African National Congress and see violence as the only means toward reform, the blacks have had little success in finding a leader who represents all of their interests. Currently, Desmond Tutu seems to be the most visible black leader but large groups such as the Zulus, led by Galsha Buthelezi, and the United Democratic Front disagree publicly with Tutu on the methods ofreform. 


Other interests and conflicts sometimes divert the attention away from the original goals. The two largest black organizations in South Africa, the Inkatha and the UDF, cur-

P.O. BoxQ 
think of the anti-American backlash which 
will occur when blacks finally gain their 
liberty in South Africa if we continue 
"Construstive Engagement" with white fas­
cists. 

There is a lot of thinly veiled anti­Communism in Safranek's article. We, in this country, must quit ourperpetual litanyofRus­sian sins. The immature polity, like the im­mature person, blame others and tries to control the behavior of others. H we con­centrated on improving our own political morality and began to tighten up on the ero­sion ofdemocratic values in the United States, we would not suffer nearly so much effective competition from Marxism In the world 
arena. 

Question: Why is there so much right­wingery in the Notre Dame Law School? Does the mutt lie with American law or the Notre Dame milieu?

Dad's words of advice were extremely moving Dear Editor: 
As we all sat around the lunch table reading The Observer-just like every Monday, Wed­nesday and Friday -a particular article stood out. One by one, amidst the hustle, clanking trays, and the deli lady yelling "What else?", we all read the guest column by Robert Burtchaell to his daughter titled, "Father sends advice to his freshman daughter." 
Teary-eyed and emotionally moved would be an understatement of our joyous, jealous and envious reaction. How we wished those

special words and thoughts could have been written for us. 
How lucky this young woman is to have such a father. Not only one that feels this way and is willing and able to express hiril.self as such, but to even go so far as to share these wonders with the Notre Dame/Saint Mary's community. 
Would it not be wonderful if we could all remember Burtchaell's secret? He had help. We all need that help-God. What a friend to have. 
So often God is perched on top of LeMans tower or on the Administration Building steps. Like Burtchaell, I see him in the eyes of proud parents dropping off their timid fresh­men, in the excitement of returning roommates and enthusiastic teachers, in the glow of the candles at the Grotto and even in the hypnotizing fountain on Lake Marion. 
I would not be the same old student if I did not thank Robert Burtchaell for his letter and for all those at Notre Dame and Saint Mary's who make this college community so special. 
I have a few reminders from a student's perspective. Do not forget your parents and all they have done to get you here. Do not let the booze be a big part of your life. Do not harp on looking for a husband or a wife. 
Last and most importantly, use what talents rently are locked in a struggle for land and in­fluence. 
There is no guarantee that international economic pressure, such as that from the United States, will improve the situation for South African blacks. American conservatives make a substantial claim that it will hurt the black workers more than it will help them, even driving unemployed blacks back lO the homeland. Buthelezi, the leader of the Zulus, agrees. Divestiture sends Pretoria an un­clouded show of American disapproval that our consciences merely cannot dismiss. Tutu claims the loss of black jobs is a price his people may have to pay to achieve the politi­cal rights they deserve. 
The entire controversy is complex. Addi­tional problems include the unions, the Indians and coloreds, the mixed feelings of the South African press and other complicat­ing matters. We begin to see why there is no simple course ofaction for the United States. 
Our nation needs to take more action, but how? A sophisticated problem such as this one calls for a sophisticated solution, one that Washington does not have at the moment. One thing we can say is neither Reagan's nor Botha's method is working.

Theft of personal letter a disturbing experience 
Dear Editor: 
Last Wednesday night in the library I was the victim of a very disturbing theft. It was a letter; sealed, stamped and ready to be mailed. I had just written it to my sister and left it, for a moment, unguarded. 
For a while I could not believe what had happened, and I am still very confused at what type ofperson could commit an act like that. I wonder how he felt when reading it. Did it give him a feeling of secret power to eavesdrop on the private thoughts of a stranger? Did it help him forget, if only for a few minutes, what a nobody, what a nothing he really must be? I hope it did, for now what 
else  can  it  serve  him but as  a  constant  
reminder  of that very fact.

Newly planned fountain offers many 'benefits' 
The architect's drawing appeared in lbe Observer without warning. The depicted columns and cross beams were clearly sketched. Next to the drawing, various mem­bers of the University described why the Uni­versity was constructing such a distinguished memohal to those who have died in war since World War II. 
Steve Safranek view from the limb 
"lbe next day, some students expressed their attitude toward the planned structure by stacking boxes in the Old Fieldhouse Mall. These boxes were arranged a'> a replacement of the planned structure in an attempt to save 

, the University more than half a million dollars. Such activity reveals that students at Notre Dame are not a'> apathetic a'> many say. In fact, students acted quite quickly when tlley saw what wa'> at stake (more than S'500,000 ). The structure depicted in The Observer 
readily revealed Notre Dame is not a parochial place. One ofthe published comments on the memorial said it would be similar to the Greek memorials to their dead. Another report said Notre Dame's memorial would be a tribute much like Stonehenge (a memorial to the Sun God). 
Since neither of these civilizations were 

Christian, and certainly not Catholic, this ad­
dition to Notre Dame is a tribute to our 
ecumenical spirit. It portrays Notre Dame's 
willingness to embrace pagan cultures and to 
be conformed to them. 
Various depreciating comments have been forthcoming from many quarters. Most of these comments have centered around the tremendous expenditure of money for what seems like a monstrosity. 
Such comments reveal that students fail to grasp another attribute of this memorial. just as the military has spent $'5,000 on a cof­feepot, Notre Dame is able to spend $500,000 on these stone columns. We are becoming chic. 
In a similar vein, as various states have spent hundreds of thousands of dollars decorating their highways with what they claim to be art, so too is Notre Dame decorating its quad­rangles. Thus, Notre Dame is showing its ability to· stay abreast of the current artistic fashion. 

Some of my fellow students do not under­stand this mentality. Their varied comments express a different attitude toward memorials. The suggestions they have given for a memoriai to our fallen heroes range from a chapel to a new building on campus dedicated to the fallen warriors. Or maybe the ·univer­sity could endow some faculty chairs· as a memorial. All ofthese alternatives surely were considered and rejected for "good" reasons ­reasons too profound for students to ap­preciate. 
These criticisms and comments about the new structure indicate that students fail to ap­preciate the practical benefits of the stone columns standing in a pool ofwater. 
Since the memorial will be located on the mall, students will pass it every day and be reminded of their fallen countrymen. Many of those students will be so touched by this memorial they wiU say a short prayer for the fallen. At the very least, the students will be forced to reflect on the horrors ofwar and the nuclear threat under which we all live, and because of which we all might die. 
Perhaps though, the best comment about this new structure was made by a student who noted the structure's stone material and flowing water. These attributes of the structure coupled with its proximity to the men's dormitories on the no~h quadrangle mandates that men walking back from Senior Bar or the Four Corners will pass directly by it. 
When they do so, they probably will not reflect on the fallen heroes, nor on the beauti­ful artistic" touches. But in a fit of need, they too will show their creativity and do what the early Christians did to so many pre-Christian buildings: they will transform it to suit their needs.

A look at life at ND to depress the depressed 
Are you depressed? Are you feeling low, buddy? Do you find yourself stuck to your desk at the end of Introduction to Sleep (Theology)? Did that cute little number in Freshman Seminar make an obscene gesture when you winked at her? 
Brian Broderick sincerely yours 
Well, cheer up, lads and lassies. The Univer­sity of Notre Dahle presents "Stonehenge II." This monument, which obviously had to be built in the middle of a college campus, will soon grace our presence. Construction naturally should start at the beginning of the school year. What a moving experience it is to watch those trucks tear up sod (this is the same grass where we cannot fling a frisbee). The 40 feet of snow dumped annually on the Notre Dame campus should not hinder con­struction. 

So Isound a little bitter-I admit I was one of the multitude who used the "Stonehenge quad" to get to O'Shaughnessy to sweat out another philosophy class. 
World War II monuments are not your cup of tea? Get ready kiddies, it is only a few days until Notre Dame's "Faustball" season begins. 
Like the rest of you, I believe the football team will finish eleven and zero, win the Orange Bowl and capture the National Cham­pionship that so narrowly has eluded the team during the Faust years. Being ranked in the top 20 means many football analysts are under the same illusion. 
But wait -the team is basically free ofinjury, the freshman crop looked fantastic in practice, (wait until you see how good they look standing on the sidelines) and there are so many things going for this team that we just cannot lose. Please do not tell the University ofMiami or the University ofSouthern Califor­nia. 

Watching a talented football team play mediocre football does not excite you, either. Have faith, I sense a party could be happening. 
'Hey girls, come to our 14 by 11 room for a party. We will have one red light and the rest of the room will be dark. Pretty cool, eh? Hey, you in the corner, do you want to dance? What do you mean there is not enough room? There are only 60 people in here. Hey buddy, could you put on that Talking Heads tune again? I hear after you have heard it 42 times it takes on special significance."

George Rickey -a world-renowned artist co111es ho111e 


Cathyann Reynolds 
Art review 
A 
rtists often live in a different 
world than Notre Dame and 
Saint Mary's students, especially 
engineers. But internationally­
known artist George Rickey has two 
things in common with these 
campuses. One, he has lived in 
South Bend. And two, Rickey has an 
interest in the mechanical, physical 
world. 
"I've made sculptures for the 
satisfaction or completion ofa 
problem," said Rickey. "Planned 
indeterminacy is a component of 
my sculpture." The 78-year-old 
artist, who is internationally ac­
claimed for his kinectic sculpture, 
returned to his birthplace last week 
for the exhibit "George Rickey in 
South Bend." 
Ifyou have wondered about the 
seemingly floating steel sculptures 
on Notre Dame's or Saint Mary's 
campus (in O'Shaughnessy cour­
tyard and in front ofLeMans, for 
example), they are pan ofthe five­
location exhibit at the South Bend 
Art Center, the Snite Museum, Saint 
Mary's Hammes Gallery, Indiana 
University at South Bend, and 
Rickey's childhood home on West 
Washington Street. 
For the Snite exhibit Rickey 
chose sculptures that were con­
structed using principals ofen­
gineering. "At the Snite there are 
four or five drawings that use 
elementary theories ofphysics," he 
said. "Two Conical Segments 
Gyratoory Gyratory II" has large 
curved segments that twist in the 
air. 
Also in the Snite exhibit, "Two 
Open Rectangles Horizontal," "Two 
Open Rectangles Excentric," and 
"Four Open Rectangles Excentric" 
use repetitions ofthe same basic 
shapes. These sculptures at first 
look the same, but become different 
as they move in the wind. 
Close by is a photograph ofa 
similar sculpture outside a building 
that shows these themes in a much 
larger scale. Rickey said he con­
sidered "small to big" when plan­
ning Notre Dame's exhibit. 
The Hammes exhibit features jewelry and small sculptures made for Rickey's wife Edith as well as figurative drawings. "Where the girls are, why not adornment?" Rickey joked. One set ofearrings and complementary necklace that Rickey calls "Two lines with spirals" wouldn't be worn with the familar polos and plaids ofthe day. But this jewelry might suit the dresser ofLondon's or Amsterdam's styles. According to one acquain­tance, Edith Rickey herselfenjoys wearing these hammered gold sculptures that would protrude about four inches from the ear and neck ofthe wearer. 
Referring to the "Four L's Ex­centric" in Lake Marion at Saint Mary's, Rickey said "I made two of those, one's in London." This sculpture is four steel sculptures resting on different levels just above the water that move with the wind. Their distinct reflections in the water create a multi­dimensional effect. 
Unlike expressive artists, Rickey preconceives all his sculptures. In 1949 (after 20 years ofpainting) Rickey says that he "embarked on an an of motion in which every object had to be preconceived. Yet, in spite of the preconception, I wanted the motion to be unpredic­table. So I rejected motors; only air currents could provide the energy." 

Rickey's interest in things mec­hanical can be traced to his youth, when after moving from South Bend at the age ofsix, he spent a great deal oftime at the shipyards in Glasgow, Scotland. Rickey also remembers his grandfather, the one clockmaker in Athol, Mass., who could make the village clock run. 
Rickey says, "I design what I want." But he employs "an engineer for anything that is concerned with safety." His engineer calculates the extent and types ofdamages pos­sible ifthe steel sculpture falls from high winds. The engineer also helps determine correct thicknesses for the steel shafts and walls. But it is Rickey who has learned to weld, massage, adjust and balance his steel pieces which are only a thousandth ofan inch thick. 
Rickey explains that "whatever diverse mechanical devices I con­trived, I was always dealing with the very ancient device -the pendulum -whose movements through time and space are a compromise of force and freedom." 
The exhibit opened formally at the South Bend Art Center Thursday. Saturday heralded Rickey's return with an evening banquet. 
Rickey's major exhibitions have been at The Corcoran Gallery ofArt in Washington D.C., The Guggen­heim Museum in New York City, The Walker Art Center in Min­neapolis, Neue Nationalgalerie in West Berlin, and the Stades Museum in Frankfurt. 
He has Written many articles and essays, the most famous ofwhich is "Constructivism: Origins and. Evolu­tion," published in 1968. Construc­tivism was an art movement ofthe 1920s concerned with science and technology and with the concrete rather than the abstract.

B Oken,By a slim 91, ND and SMC break
r .the world record for musical chairs 
Phil Wolf 
features staffwriter 

T 
hey start when they are about 
six years old. They spend hours 
practicing alone in the hasement, 
and they are the terror ofthe 
birthday party circuit. They dream 
ofsomeday going to Notre Dame to 
compete with the best. 
They are collegiate musical 
chairs playt·rs, and they are not a 
pretty lot. 
They asssemhle by the thousands 
on the outskirts ofcollege 
campuses to play their controver­
sial game. They display a blatant 
disrespect for the rules of the game 
as they run, dive. push and dhow 
their way into history. 
And now tht.·y have brought a 
national championship to Notre 
Danlt·. No, make that the world 
championship. Imagine: Notre 
Darnt·. Ind., the muskal t·hairs capi­
tal of the univer:.e. The subway 
alumni will be tlocking to the 
campu,s and buying musical chairs 
parapht·rnalia hy the bundle. The 
hook.\tore already ha.' contracts 
with t·ornpanies to stock official 
Fi!(luing Irish musi<:al chairs hel­
mets. dhow pads and T-shirt.,. The 
possibilities are almost endless. 
Ofcourse, there are those who do not approve of the sport, par­ticuhtrly at a Catholic institution su<.·h as Notre Dame. They attack the musical chairs establishment for corrupting the minds of the future leadt·rs ofour country and our Church. They say that the players art· too competitive, that the sport has lost its fun aspect. They claim that collegiate musical chairs has become hig business. They ques­tion tht· evil connotations of the "snakt·" pattern ustd for the large contt·sts. 
But still the game goes on. 
Olkn, we here at Notre Dame think that we are somehow immune from the evils that can accompany t'olkgiatt· athletics. But la.'t Friday afternoon, <;,I'; I people, most of them students, a.'isemhled on Green Field for a game of musical chairs that la.'ited into the night. And the administration of this fine Univer­sity ltt them get away with it. 
In fact, some bigwig ad· 
ministrators served as judges while 
the students attempted to bash each 
other's brains out for the coveted 
prize ofa color television, provided 
hy none less than that grey-haired, 
green-dad group known as the 
Notre Dame Alumni Association. 
How could this have happened at 
Notre Dame? 

"We thought musical chairs would he fun," said Jim Domagalski, the leader of the musical chairs movement at Notre Dame. "It's kind ofa college thing to do, trying to play musical chairs with 5,000 people." 
Just imagine what the administra­tion is going to do when it dis­covers that almost 6,000 students had fun last Frid;~y night. Bye-bye musical chairs. 
And what about all of those MC addicts who will be out on the streets? Never again will they he able to enjoy a simple game of musical chairs with only 200 people. They always will be trying to organize bigger and bigger groups to play the game. Society is not equipped to deal with these junkies and the chaos they may cause. 
Sure, they're mostly freshmen, but not all of them. Twelve ofthe top 16 finishers last Friday may have been rookies, but certainly all 5,1 5 I were not first-year players. 
How can we excuse the actions of"responsible" upperclassmen such as Domagalski and his counter· part at Saint Marfs, Michelle Coleman? How can we explain the involvement ofevery class govern­ment, the student body govern­ment, the Student Activities Board and the Student Activities Office? What about the commercial spon· sors, Domino's Pizza, Coca-Cola and WZZP Radio? Will they soon be offering endorsement contracts to the top players, who are practically babies, coming out ofhigh school? 
These questions, and many ot­hers. must be answered. And soon. And now that Notre Dame holds the world record, will the Guinness 

People recognize it? Or will they 
ignore it a.'i they have ignored 
Bookstore Basketball, the world's 
largest basketball tournament? 
Whatever Guinness says, 
however, there still are problems to 
be dealt with on campus. Like the 
case ofwinner Bill Brosnan, a Flan­
ner freshman who now spends 
hours a day wasting away in front of 
his new color television. Rumor has 
it that Brosnan will be on the col· 
legiate MC circuit soon, but the 
Notre Dame ticket office says it will 
not provide students with the op­
portunity to get tickets to any of the 
away events. 
Then there is Carrie Deane, a Saint Mary's freshman who now is wired permanently to her new personal stereo, her prize for a second-place finish. She says she was just out there Friday to have fun, but anyone who was there knows better. 
This musical chairs thing has gone too far. Something has got to be done before Domagalski and his henchmen branch out into pin the tail on the donkey. Soon the whole campus may he eating cake and ice cream three meals a day. Surely, this sort ofactivity must stop.

players should be valuable to the team. 
Completing the team are fresh­men Ellen Boyle, Bridget Coneys, Mary Crawford, Becky Davis, Therese Harrington and Anne Pec­hous. 
As sponsor of the varsity sport, Saint Mary's handles the team's ex­penses and its scheduling. Accord­ing to Akers, when soccer was a club sport, the College funded only a por­tion of the expenses. Student Ac­tivities and the athletic department also contributed to the soccer club, but the players and their parents were responsible for transportation and uniform costs. 
The team's varsity status allows them to compete wholly against inter-collegiate teams, producing a more demanding schedule than those of previous seasons. 
"We play some of the best women's collegiate teams in the Midwest, including Indiana, Mic­higan State, Wisconsin-Milwaukee and Marquette," said Akers. 
Such a schedule requires long practices and intense training. Team members have been practicing daily for two weeks and have scrimmaged with other soccer teams. 
"I think we have the potential skill-wise to play with these schools," Akers said. "Whether we have the physical strength and the stamina, there's no telling right now. 
We  can  compete  with  them,  
though."

get help from senior Tom Monahan and junior Pernell Taylor. Both Starns and Monahan earned monograms last season, but that was mainly for special teams contribu­tions. 

Pernell Taylor 
"We don't ha.ve as much ex­
perience at the fullback position as 
we do at some others, but we think 
that people like Starns will do what 
needs to be done," says Coach Gerry 
Faust. "They don't have to be super­
stars, they just have to get the job 
done." 
At 6-4 and 229 pounds, Starns has 
the physical tools to get the job 
done. The coaches like his blocking 
ability, and feel that his speed will 
help him become a dependable ball­
carrier. Running back coach Mal 
Moore says he has been pleased with 
the progress Starns has made since 
the end oflast season

"Frank has improved himself since last year to earn the st2rting job," says Moore. "He had a hamstr­ing pull from the Aloha Bowl game that affected him for spring drills. But he really made progress during the tail end of the spring." 
Monahan is a former walk-on who was awarded a scholarship last spring. At 5-10 and 210 pounds, he lacks Starns' size, but the coaches like his toughness. 
Having rebounded from two years of injury problems, Taylor figures to see some playing time as well. The 5-11, 216-pound junior suffered torn knee ligaments in August of 1983 and was forced to sit out his entire rookie season. After a lengthy rehabilitation, he appeared to have made a full recovery and came back in impressive fashion last spring. If he and Monahan continue their progress, the Irish could have suffi­cient depth at the fullback spot. 
But only time will tell if the cur· rent trio can effectively replace Smith and Brooks.

"Chris and Mark were two very capable athletes and experienced players so we'll obviously miss them," notes Moore. "As f.u as our current group is concerned, they've made progress and there's still room for improvement. So we're not going to change our offensive approach with respect to the fullback situa­tion. This group hasn't really been in the 'big game' situations, but we still expect them to respond."

and blocking game with much more confidence and success, helped in large part by the efforts of Ben­nington. 
Unfortunately for the Irish, Ken­tucky responded with an 8-1 run to put the score at 9-5 in favor of the Wildcats. 
It was then Notre Dame's turn to rally, as it evened the score at 9-9 be­hind the serving of Kathleen Morin. The Irish could do no better, however, as Kentucky scored the last six points to win the third game, 15-9, and complete its sweep. 
While understandably upset over his team's performance, Lambert praised the play of Bennington. 
"Tracy played well," he said. "She was really the only bright spot on the team tonight." 
Lambert stressed the importance of the group coming together soon, since the schedule only gets toug­her.

short of a victory with 0-6, 1 ,6 and 1-6, 3-6 losses against Foote and Murray at the number-five and six singles spots, respectively. 
"In the Marquette singles matches, the girls knew they were good and that they had the shots," Laverie pointed out. "Keeping confi­dent when you are behind is the key." 
Dimberio and Boyd could not bounce back against Marquette's VanLieshout and Murray, the number-one doubles team. and were defeated by a score of 1:6, 3-6. 
" We have to work together and know each others games," said Dim­berio, a freshman from Ft. Wayne. "Our team is young and for our first collegiate match, we played well," added freshman teammate Boyd. 
Drahqta and Heratz feU short to Lohr and Janusonfs 0,6, 1-6 while the Belles' Campbell and Szajko could not volley to a win against Marquette's Foote and Ploetz and lost by a score of 4-6, 0-6 in doubles competition. 
.Choosing a long distance companyis a lot like choosing 


a roommate. 

Living together with someone for the·first time can be an "educational" experience.. 
Andliving with a long distance'company isnlany·different. Because some companies may not give fOU all the services· you're used to ~~tting from AT&T. 
For instance, with some companies you have to spend a certain amount before you qualify for· their special volume discounts.With some others, voice q·uality may vary. 
But when you choose AT&T, there wQn't be any surprises when you move in. You'll get the same high-quality, trouble-free service you're used to. 
With calls that sound as close as next door. Guaranteed 60% and 40% discounts off our Day Rate-so yoti can t-alk during the times you can relax. Immediate credit for wrong numbers. Operator assistance and collect calling. 
So when you're asked to choose along dis­tance company, choose AT&T. Because whether you're into Mozart or metal, quality is the one thing everyone can agree on. Reach out and touch someone~
