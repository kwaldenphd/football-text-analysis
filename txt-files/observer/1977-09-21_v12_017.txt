Mysterious train death perplexes authorities 
CHICAGO [AP) -A case that might have popped right off the pages of an Agatha Christie thrill­er, has police in nearby Burns Harbor, Ind., still scratching their heads. 
It has all the elements of a classic Christie spine-tingler: a dead man who fell from a speeding train; the body discovered alongside a lonely, desolate stretch of track, one hand gripping a clump of black, curly hair; multiple sets of identification papers confusing the dead man's identity; police racing the train to its next stop to interrogate tlle passengers; an eyewitness account that only makes the matter more perplexing. 
The only thing that's missing is a Hercule Poirot to make sense of the case. Poirot was Dame Christie's fictional master sleuth. 
The body was found along an Amtrak roadbed early Sunday af­ternoon in Burns Harbor, a town of about 1,300 some 40 miles south­east of Chicago. A passen?,~~t on Amtrak's Lake Shore Limited­bound for Chicago from New York and Boston, had seen the man jump or fall from tlle train and reported it to a conductor. 
Police jumped in their squad cars and sped off to Chicago to catch the train's passengers for questioning. Amtrak ofticials had the Lake Shore Limited sllow down so the police could beat it to Chicago's Union Station. 
The train was sealed when it arrived in the station and Burns Harbor police, assisted by a squad of Chicago police, interviewed its 107 passengers, for some clue to the reason for the death. 
The dea,d man has been identif­ied as Angel Javie Ospina, 41, of Colombia. Police said the identifi­

St. Mary's Student Assembly met Monday night to discuss voting procedures, major policy issues, and the importance of the upcom­ing Oct. 3 meeting. 
Student Assembly representa­tive, Mary Garrett, explained the voting procedures to new mem­bers. According to Garrett, al­though each representative places one vote, it represents not only her own viewpoint but those of her peers. The vote of an assembly member represents what she thinks her fellow students want. 
In the case of any major policy issues, "Onemeeting will usually 
not  suffice  for  an  approval  or  
disapproval  vote,"  stated  Mary  
Rukavina,  Student  Government  

President. Furthermore, she said, ".More student opinion is needed when the issue is controversial." 
The agenda of the Oct. 3 meeting will include the final vote on which clubs and activities allocate funds and the amount of tlle allocations. The Board of Governance will initially review the clubs and the budgets submitted to determine justifiable requests for funds. The board reviews the clubs to deter­mine legitimate requests but has no voting power. 
Rukavina stressed the impor­tance of a "typed, specific, organi­zed" request from each club to insure immediate response from assembly members. A specific ledger is needed from each re­questing organization since Stu­dent Assembly must set aside funds and anticipate allocations. The ledger should include the number of students in the club, areas where the requested funds will be spent, and a past record of

efficiency. ''This format will save time and alleviate problems as seen in the past when unstructured requests were rejected or accepted too quickly," stressed Rukavina. 
Clubs requesting funds need not be approved by Notre Dame or Saint Mary's administrations. The only requirement is to have Saint Mary's students participating. 
•'All groups are not assured alloca­tions but appeals will be heard," Rukavina emphasized. 
Rukavina informed assembly members that any suggestions or proposals concerning academics, Senior comps, changes in student affairs, or other areas. of student concern are welcome. 
The student parking problem was also discussed. Some mem­bers were not aware of 1he fact that last year's proposal never reached the voting stage. The problem stemmed from special interest

The Church of loretto 

Secluded in a comer of St. Mary's campus, adjoining 
the convent of the Sisters of the Holy Cross, is the 
college's gorgeous stained-glass and blue mosaic­
adorned pride and joy, The Church of Our Lady of 
Loretto. 
The present church is actually the second church on 
that site. The original church was begun in 1886 and 
completed in the spring of 1887. 
However, time and weather finally forced massive 
reconstruction of the church to begin in August, 1954. 
Paul Jacques Grillo, a French artist, designed the 
reconstructed church, including all mosaic work and 
sculpturing. The architect and engineer ·was Otto F. 
Seeler, professor of architecture at Notre Dame. 
Rededication ceremonies for the new church took place 
May 1, 1956, with Rev. Leo A. Pursley, then apolistic 
administrator of the Fort Wayne diocese, officiating. A 
high mass followed the ceremonies. 
The outside walls of the reconstructed combination 
Byzantine, Gothic and Romanesque church are unusual 
in that they are faced with handmade bricks, arranged on 
the main (acade in the form of a cross surrounded by 
radiating shafts. The traditional triple-gated main 
entrance is flanked by two towers dedicated, as in 
medieval cathedrals, to the Archangels, Gabriel and 
Michael. The doors are of solid oak sheathed in a red 
brass alloy, which is also used elsewhere in the church 
where metal appears. Each of three semi-circular 
arch-shaped doors displays a stencilled design. The 
south door shows the Anunciation; the center door shows 

.... ~­
... 
,~;$~

-II -·).~·;·:;-;r·-'l( 
>'<.;:... ,r 

the translation of the Holy House of Loreto in Italy; and 
the north door shows the nativity of Christ. 
Inside, in the central vestibule of the narthex or lobby's · mosaicfloor, symbols of the Virgin Mary (anchor, rose, 
five-pointed star and fleur-de-lis) surround the words 
"Ecce Ancilla Domini" inscribed on an olive branch. 
The portion of the narthex floor beneath the tower of 
the Archangel Gabriel shows two interlaced branches of 
the lily and the olive, symbols of the Annunciation. They 
also form the gamma symbol and the zodiacal sign Aries 
for the spring equinox. 
The floor mosaics beneath the Archangel Michael's 
tower represent the last judgement with a flaming 
sword cutting through the Greek letter Omega. It also 
represents the zodiacal sign Libra for the fall equinox. 
At each side of the three glass double doors decorated 

by Jean Powley 
with cut designs of clouds, :>tars and doves and separate the narthex from the nave or central church area, are holy water fonts made from a northern Michigan boulder. It was split and the halves were hollowed out to form bowls. 
The nave floor is of white Georgian marble. In its walls are set four mosaic panels framed in stylized olive leaves of the same red brass alloy as in the doors. According to a pamphlet distributed to church visitors, "the palette of only 18 colors and the technique resemble those used in the greatest periods of mosaic and tapestry. The sharpness and vividness of the mosaic panels are achieved by the limited palette, which avoids many shades worked into one another by realistically graded color-tones. Complementary colors of great brilliancy and purity are placed next to each other, thus obtaining secondary tones which add a brilliancy of their own to the composition." 
All four of the mosaic panels, which are 80 feet high and 27 feet wide at the base, have the same design with minor variations (an alternation of palm trees and lilies) up to a height of 20 feet. 
The first mosaic panel depicts the Tree of Jesse, which contains 12 figures, grouped in three tiers. The first tier represents the major prophets ofthe Old Testament. On 
the second tier are the folllr rulers of the OldTestament and of Christian times. The third tier shows the great educators and founders of religious communities. 
On the panel of the Mother of Sorrows a scroll bearing the text of Simeon's prophecy unfurls among seven scenes picturing the sorrows of Mary. Seven swords, representing the Virgin's sorrows, pierce the heart of the central figure, the Mother of Sorrows, clad in veils of mourning 
Mary is illustrated in glory on the panel of Our Lady, Queen of Heaven. She holds the representation of the highest gift, wisdom, a symbol of Christ, in her arms. 
The fourth or Rosary panel shows a flowering bush intertwining its branches around the representations of the 15 mysteries of the rosary. The representations are partially pictorial and partially symbolic. 
The domed roof area or cupola, separated from the rest of the nave by a metal ring, represents the upper room where the Apostles were gathered at the descent of the Holy Spirit. In the 12 stained glass windows of the cupola, which were designed by Notre Dame architecture students and made in Milan and Florence, the Apostles are depicted with Pentecostal "tongues of fire" above their heads. 
The roof above the cupola continues the symbolism through a series of 12 gables joining at the summit to support a 12-foot cross that crowns the edifice 120 feet above the floor. Suspended from the apex of the cupola is a polished steel dove with spread wings, symbol of the Holy Spirit. · 
Along the balconies and between the mosaic panels of the nave are scattered plain Greek apple wood crosses, representing the stations of the cross. 
Church of Loretto's present stained glass windows were also part of the original church. They were handmade in LeMans, France by the Carmelite nuns, who employed an unusual process in making their windows. They designed them on clear glass, painted in the figures, and then fired the glass as one would fire china. The pieces were then returned to the frames . 
"There were to be four large rose windows, which would outline the cross and blend it into the circular walls of the church. These would represent the mysteries through which the Blessed Mother is linked with the .-.. story of Redemption. Her Immaculate Conception window was to be placed in the east; the Annunciation opposite , forecasting the conversion of the western world; the bitter suffering of the Crucifixtion on the north; and the Assumption completing the cross on the south. The four long panels for the rear of the church and the four shorter ones above the side altars toward the fron, were to complete the scenes in the life of Mary," reported St. Mary's alumnae magazine, Courier", in its November, 1929 issue. 
Finally, the floor of the sanctuary is of light green Vermont marble. An Italian marble table altar rests in front on the shoulders of two marble angels. The tabernacle behind the altar bears on the front a wheat design in gold filigree with the inscription "I am the Bread of Life." Above the tabernacle hangs a wood-carved crucifix, overlaid with gold leaf. 
Soon after the church's refurbishing, a reporter from the Peoda Joomai-Star named Evabeth Miller, visited the church and returned home to write a glowing report of it in her newspaper. "It is not a gaudy church, nor even an elaborate one, although it is richly done. Its woods are mellow, its colors subdued. It is truly a holy place, and the spirit bows instaptly in awe and prayer at this sight. Here is modem art that no conservative could decry.''

BCAC discusses four proposals 
"All the people have been inform­ed," Paczesny said, "so that there will be a general cognizance that minorities exist and that they are not to be ignored." 
Paczesny went on to say that he felt oversights in the past had been unconscious. One instance was the omission of the Black Cultural Arts Festival in the events section of last year's Dome yearbook. Greg Young, present editor-in-chief of the Dome, has already approached Gueringer and has promised to give adequate coverage to both the festival and the BCAC. 
Looking back, Gueringer feels that the April demonstration serv­ed a valuable purpose. "Issues were discussed and lines of com­munication were opened so that future issues can be solved as a matter of course." Paczesny commented that though there should be no need for protest and that he is personally open to all student and minority problems, "the needs (of minority studen,ts) were never articulated well enou·gh and it was a good thing to happen to clear the waters."

Service community slates annual orientation 
by Florenceanne Strlgle 
CILA will hold its annual orienta­tion weekend September 22-24 at Pioneer Trails, a Boy Scout camp in southern Indiana. 
The weekend will feature work­shops 0n CILA projects, speakers, including Rev. Don McNeil, Notre Dame theology professor, prayer services, and a square dance. Its culmination will be a mass celebra­ted by Rev. Theodore Hesburgh, University President. 
"Anyone interested in committ­ing themselves to CILA is encour­aged to come." says·aaude Porn­erleau, Notre Dame political sci­ence professor and faculty advisor of CILA. "We already have 80 people signed-up and there is limited space, but we do not want any interested people left out." The cost of the orientation is$5.00 per person. Rides leave the main Dane; finance chairperson; Mau­reen O'Brien, liturgy chairperson; Susan Grace, social chairperson; Marianne Murphy, communica­tions chairperson; and Don Murphy and Jay Brandenburger, education­al officers. Besides Pomerleau, Rev. Kevin Kearney and Rev.· Michael Glockner act as •counselors for the group.

Harriers look forward to bright future 
by Paul Stevenson Sports Editor 
The development of an athletic program at the collegiate level requires a constant inflow of talent. 
When a team loses players to injury or graduation, the younger squad members must be prepared to fill in. For Head Coach Joe Piane and his Irish harriers, twelve dedicated freshmen have stepped into the Notre Dame cross country tradition and have helped keep the program runnmg. 
"This year's freshmen are a really solid group, "the Irish men­tor commented. "In addition, they seem to be very close-knit. They're good friends as well as team­mates." 
"'As a group, they are the most dedicated freshmen I've seen since I've been at Notre Dame,"Piane added. 
This collection of youngsters has really added a lot to the entire program in their brief duration at du Lac. On September 10, when many were watching the Irish gridders perform on national tele-the juniors on the team," Piane vision against Pittsburgh, the stressed.

King Kong 
·=·=·=·=·=·=·=·=·=·=·=·=·=·=:=·========================================:===============================================================Vagabond
Odysseus would be proud of this man's deeds. Andrew Jackson would be this man's biggest fan. General George Patton would gladly shed his greens and spit polished boots to serve this man as a subordinate. Even contemporary authors are salivating at the opportunity for writing this man's biography once he retires. And to all of the citizens of the United States, this man is living proof that the American sports hero is, indeed, alive and well. He will probably be the first man to hit a fair ball out of Yankee Stadium. He should get a lot of chances, because Dave Kingman is now a New York Yankee. 
There are your faceless outfielders whom annually punch in whith their 18 homers. And then there are your Oscar Gambles who come up with their once in lifetime 30 homer season. Year in, year out, you have your Mike Schmidt's, Graig Nettles', Reggie Jackson's, Johnny Bench's and George Foster's. But then there is King Kong, the 6'6", 230 lb. slugger who responds to the homerun challenge above and beyond the call of duty. 
There are those who feel that Kingman will someday put a ball into orbit around the earth. What I'm saying is that Kingman is in a slugger's class of his own and for the average American baseball fan his mamoth home runs overshadow any other kind of baseball play. He is a baseball hero and baseball is classified as America's pastime. 
Before last night's game with the Red Sox, Kingman had hit three homers in the three games he has played since being bought on waivers from the California Angels. He could be the insurance to a division title for the streaking Yankees with his intermittent spells of homerun superiority. In addition, Kingman has almost as many RBI's as he does hits. 
Kingman has been a major leaguer for less than a decade but already, legends of his homerun heroics are making their way across cultures and across generations. 
Way back when Kingman was with the New York Mets (about three and a half months ago) he stepped up to the plate in Montreal's Olympic Stadium. Moments later, the baseball was flying high over the leftfield roof on its journey into the deep reaches of space. There was no way for the umpire to see the disappearing ball but he still managed to call it foul. 
And who could forget Kmgman in Wrigley Field last year? A blast of his traveled so far that it crossed the street running 'in back ofthe stadiuma and traveled on down past a couple of houses before finally returning to earth, hitting a front door to a house. Rumor has it that the resident answered the door and found the ball with Kingman's signature on it. 
Just two days ago, a wire photo showed several Yankees pointing to a place in the upperdeck at Tiger Stadium where Kingman had JUSt parked a moonshot. Last year, Kingman was leading the world in four-baggers before a hand injury forced him to miss a month and a half of the season. He still finished with a total of 37. 
Why, might you ask, has Kingman been shuffled among four teams this year if he is soo good (Mets, Padres, Angels and Yankees)? That can be answered in three sentences. Kingman is demanding too much money for his services. He strikes out way too much. His fielding glove is made of iron. It's dangerous for Kingman's health to even look at flyballs and grounders, let alone get his on the head by one. No wonder the rebuilding San Francisco Giants peddled him to the Mets two and half years ago. 
But Kingman remains a hero in the hearts of baseball America. The homerun ball reigns supreme among all possible sports action and that is why Dave Kingman is truly the 'King'. The Yankees are glad to have him. 


look at this month as a time of preparation. In the month of September, we'll log between 320 and 400 miles running." 
Since Piane came to du Lac three years ago, he has been striving for one thing, to imr:rove the program and send the team to national competition. 
"Our one goal that we have as a team is to make nationals," Piatt.! stressed. "I don't care which seven runners are competing. We'll take our best men to repre­sent ou1r team. I truly feel that we have a better chance than most schools to make nationals." 
Yes, the cross country program has vastly improved since Pian's brief stitnt as leader of the harriers. The d•epth and potential have drastically changed. 
"When I first came to Notre Dame, we had five or six really good runners who trained as indi­viduals," Piane reflected. "Today, we hav•e 15 really good performers. 

UM is No.1 

AP -Michigan and Southern 
California held onto the top two 
positions in the Associated Press 
college football poll Monday but 
Oklahoma and Ohio State moved 
into the 3-4 spots, setting up 
Saturday's long-awaited clash in 
Columbus, Ohio. 
Meanwhile, Notre Dame and 
Houston dropped out of the Top 
fen while Alabama plummeted to 
lOth place. 
Michigan, a 21-9 winner over Duke, received 42 of 64 firstplace votes and 1,094 of a possible 1,280 points from a nationwide panel of sports writers and broadcasters. Southern California, which beat Oregon State 17-10, received five firstplace votes and 1,032 points. 
Oklahoma, the preseason leader but only No. 5 in the first regular­season poll lastweek, climbed to third with seven firstplace votes and %5 points by walloping Utah 62-24 while Ohio State rose from sixth Ito fourth with two firstplace votes and 877 points by trouncing Minnesota 38-7. 
Penltl State edged past Texas A&M. which defeated Virginia Tech 27-6 and went from seventh to sixth with 708 points. Texas Tech was up from eighth to seventh with two firstplace votes and 631 points 'lfter trimming New Mexico 49-14. 
Colorado moved from 12th to eighth place. Texas moved from 18th to ninth. Alabama dropped from fourth to tenth. 
Notre Dame fell from third to 11th by losing to Mississippi 20-13. Rounding out the Second Ten, are Mississippi State, Florida, Nebras­ka, Washington State, Arkansas, West Virginia, UCLA, Houston and Brigham Young. 
Thes kids are just as good as those individuals, however they train and race as a team. I know it's hard to imagine, but all these guys can go out and run five miles as a unit." 
One advantage to having a great group of underclassmen is the incentive it adds to the other members of the squad. With added talent, there is greater competition and a harder working group, all vying for an open spot. 
"There's no doubt that there is a great deal of competition on the squad," Piane noted. "There are two sophomores that lettered last year and they're going to have to work all that much harder to keep their position and stay in the top seven. Once you have earned a spot doesn't mean you'll never lose it. Your performance dictates who will make the top seven, and I feel that competition makes for a heal­thy atmosphere." 
Chuck Aragon, a freshmen who placed tenth in the race against the Boilermakers, has really come on early for the Irish. The change from high school competition to college is tremendous. 
"Well, there is a lot of difference between high school and college competition," Aragon commented. 
"I wasn't use to the distance at first. In high school we ran about 40 miles a week, while here the team runs at least 85 miles a week. It really dOes take time to adjust." 
"As far as the upperclassmen are concerned, they have been super. They really encourage you and give you incentive to work harder." 
Another Irish harrier, Charlie Fox, has also added greatly to the Notre Dame cross country team. Fox finished seven in the Purdue dual meet. 
"The competition in college is really exciting," Fox aclmow­leged. "I was really looking forward to the Purdue meet and it turned out to be quite a chal­lenge." 
But cross country, although it may seem to the contrary, is a team sport. Aside from Fox and Aragon, ten other freshmen are aiding the Irish harriers this season. Keith Cooper, Mike Maney, John Riely, Jim Slattery, Craig Sobocinski, Pat Sullivan, Tim Welch, Brian Cohen, Tom Murtaugh and John Brasil have already made their presence felt amongst the members of the Notre Dame cross country team. 
The Irish still have some stiff competition to face in the remain­der of their season, but they're the type athletes that can rise to the challenge. 
"Without a doubt, the most dedicated men on campus are the distance runners,'' Piane re­marked. "They are working 12 months out of the year." 
With the Notre Dame freshmen runners, the future looks bright. For now, the present is most important, as the Irish must pre­pare for Illinois State this Friday at 4 p.m. on Burke Memorial Golf Course. 

Tony Pace Varsity Soccer 
Thursday? 

Soccer is, quite obviously, the fastest growing sport in America. But here at Notre Dame it has always been relegated to club status. That could change, howen•r, this Thursday when the athletic board meets to discuss the po~sibility of elevating soccer to the varsity level. 
The board will also discuss the possibility of making women's basketball a va·,itysport. While it appears that women's basketball will be promotLd, the soccer club's fate seems more unsettled. 
The soccer club first petitioned for varsity status last December. Though club members were told that their request would be heard at the next athlet1c meeting. the situation has yet to be settled. 
During this time, the club has been growing rapidly. Last spring 120 students tried out for the team, and 40 were invited to return to practice this fall. 80 more freshmen came out for the team in the fall. 
Club members have trained harder than ever. For the first two 
weeks of school, the team was practicing twice a day. In addition to 
their normal afternoon practice, they practiced from 6: IS to 8 o'clock in 
the morning. Their dedication certainly cannot be questioned. 
Their hard work has paid off. On consecutive weekends, they have captured fourth place in a tournament held in Oneonta, N.Y. and tied a highly regarded Dayton squad, 3-3. This week, they dropped a 2-0 decision to St. Francis College, but came back to defeat St. Joseph's of Indiana by a 4-1 count. 
The team also has a "new" look this season. Much of their equipment is new and so is their coach, Rich Hunter. Hunter is an unsalaried coach who is just "enjoying his hobby". 
While all of this development is fine, one could question the club's need for varsity status. Can't they simply continue to function as a club? No, this is where the problem begins to surface. Unless the team is promoted to the varsity level, they will no longer be able to play the schedule which they now have. 
Both the NAIA and the NCAA seem intent on eliminating all non-varsity opponents for their member schools. As far as these two bodies are concerned, there is no such thing as a game between a varsity team and a club team. The only way soccer clubs can survive is to play teams which are outside of the jurisdiction of the NAIA and the NCAA. Since most soccer teams belong to both the NAIA and the NCAA. !hi:; ~vuiu mean di:l.Teasing the schedule. With the sport expanding the way it is, this alternative does not seem realistic. So the logical conclusion is to make the soccer club varsity. 
There is,of course,orecatch: money. Will the athletic department be able to sustain additional sports which cannot pay for themselves? While a soccer team would initially run in the red, there is some evidence that this team could eventually pay for itself. 
At Oneonta, the tournament attracted a total of 13,000 for its two nights. Because of this fan support, the soccer club was presented with a check for $1,000 to help the club cover expenses. At Dayton, 6,425 fans watched the Irish (yes, they certainly were representing our Uninversity) play. These fans paid either Sl.OO or Sl.SO depending upon their age. This indicates a real possibility for the growth of a self-sustaining soccer team, if they are given a chance. 
Hopefully, when reviewing this case, Fr. Joyce and the athletic board will make a long term athletic decision rather than a short term economic one.
