Polish bomb threat 
Terrorists extend deadline 
BERN, Switzerland (AP) -Ter­rorists threatening to blow up the Polish Embassy, eight hostages and themselves have extended by 48 hours their deadline for Poland to end martial-law rule and free all political prisoners, the government reported last night. 
The gunmen occupying the em­bassy released a fourth hostage late Tuesday. He was identified as a 20­year-old Polish student who was in the building when it was taken over by the raiders Monday. Three women were freed earlier. 
A government communique said 
the deadline extension and the stu­
dent's release were obtained after 
"intensive negotiations." 
Playing a key role in the talks is an 
80-year-old Polishborn theologian, 
Professor Joseph M. Bochenski, a 
resident of Switzerland. He spent an 
hour in the embassy Tuesday in the 
first face-to-face negotiations with 
the gunmen. 
The terrorists, who still hold at 
least eight hostages, originally 
issued an ultimatum saying they 
would blow up the building at 10 
a.m. Wednesday, 4 a.m. EDT, if Poland's communist government did not meet their demands. 
One of the women hostages who 
was freed said she saw "four raiders 
armed with long weapons." The in­
vaders claimed they had enough 
dynamite to destroy the building, 
themselves and their hostages. 
At dusk, police surrounding the 
embassy moved their road blocks 
farther away from the compound, 
raising speculation of an armed as­
sault.

Notre Dame students raised more than $15,000 last year by fasting during Wednesday lunches in an at­tempt to increase awareness of and alleviate world hunger. 
The campus-wide fast, designed by the World Hunger Coalition, in­volved 10,753 lunchtime fasts during the spring term and 9,446 during the 'fall term. Food services contributed 75 cents to the Coali­tion for each meal foregone, gerterating $8,064 for the spring semester and S7,084 for the fall. 
These funds were appropriated to 

various hunger relief organizations 
which were -chosen after careful 
research by the World Hunger 
Coalition.

Pangborn Hall presidentjohn Gal­lagher presented a slide of the second floor ofthe Memorial Library and entitled it " the main lounge on the Notre Dame campus" after showing slides ofstudent centers on other college campuses during last 
night's  Hall  President's  Council  
meeting.  
Gallagher  was  on  the  Student  

Senate committee which inves­tigated various student centers on college campuses last spring. 
All of these centers are located at universities with student popula­tions comparable to that of Notre Dame. 
Norriss Center at Northwestern, Connelly Center at Villanova, and Sarratt Center at Vanderbilt were among those visited. 
All of these student centers dis­played centralized information cen­ters at easy-to-find locations. 
Another feature ofthe centers was well distributed lounge space. 
Gallagher continued by showing another feature ofthese student cen­ters -meeting rooms. Gallagher noted that such rooms could com­fortably accomodate different campus groups, like the HPC or the Student Senate. 
These student centers also have movie theatres, offering com­fortable seating in a pleasant atmos­phere.

Other agencies which received funds included the Argo Industries and Tribal Founda­tion, Investment in Man, Paroo Peak­hand, Los Ninos, Cautas, Gram Bal Shiskakendur, and Gram Gouray Pratisthan. 
According to Coalition director Ed Colbert, this year's fasting program will begin September 29. "We are trying to get Food Services to increase the amount of money donated for each lunchtime fast," he noted. "It has been 75 cents for a long while now." 
Other plans for the year include a Hunger Week, which would include speakers, films, a retreat, and other events to further explore the issue ef world hunger. 
Explosion darkens campus buildings 

By ANNE MONASTYRSKI 
StaffReporter 
A high voltage tap box exploded near the Ave Maria Press building at 9:00 yesterday morning. The explosion left the greater part ofthe campus without power thoughout the morning. 
The tap box, which was located in a manhole, exploded because ofan accumulation ofmoisture in the box, according toJohn Delee, Notre Dame's Director of Utilities. 
The deteriorated condition ofthe box coupled with the moisture from the nearby sprinkler system caused the explosion. The force of the lightning-type explosion lifted off the manhole lid and sent smoke into the air. 
Damage was limited to the two square foot tap box and feeder cable which power the north campus buildings. 
The utilities department restored power to most of the buildings by 12:30 yesterday afternoon. Stepan Center and the Guard House will remain without power until sometime this afternoon, however, since major repairs to the feeder cable could not begin until early this morning.

police to move into the embassy, which has extraterritorial status. It also asked Switzerland to permit Poland to send a "special gro<.~p" here to help end the siege. It was believed the group would include members of an anti-terrorist com­mando squad. 
Ulrich Hubacher, spokesman for Swiss federal police, has refused to rule out a police assault on the em­bassy, but another police official gave only a curt "no comment." 
Hubacher said the terrorists have not backed off their demands, and added, "It's possible they will carry out their threat." 

About 40 policemen were guard­ing the approaches to the embassy, including two dozen special forces members wearing blue fatigues and black berets and armed with sub­machine guns. More officers were believed hiding within the embassy compound.

social space available at Notre Dame, a point that was expressed in a Student Senate survey last year. 
After the presentation, Gallagher recommended better communica­tion with University administrators. 
"We have to stop talking about how bad1t is and start addressing the problem," he said. "We have to prove to the administration that we care and desire improvements." 
Gallagher added that student sup­port is crucial if anything is going to be accomplished. 
Following Gallagher's presenta­tion, Special Projects Director Jim Gibbons asked the HPC to help 
promote a basketball game on Sep­tember 18 that will benefit Logan Center. 
A representative from the United Way student drive also asked for support in achieving their s10,000 goal for the September 26-0ctober 3 drive.

Former Alabama Gov. George c. Wallace, hoping to avoid a runoffin his quest for a fourth term, went before voters for the first time in six years yesterday as four states held primary elec­tions. Both Arizona and Florida have incumbent Democratic senators and governors seeking re-election, but none faced major opposition in the primaries. In Connecticut, Gov. William O'Neill, a Democrat, and Sen. Lowell Weicker, a Republican, were unchal­lenged for renomination, and their November opponents were selected at party conventions. Voters were choosing three congres­sional candidates and a Democratic nominee for secretary of state. Wallace, 63, stopped short ofpredicting he would win a majority of the vote and thus avoids a St-pt. 28 runoffbetween the top two finis­hers. "It's hard to beat them all at one time," Wallace said at a Labor Day rally. But he added, "I'm going to be governor again." -AP 
Food allergies were dismissed as a cause ofeczema by the American Academy ofPediatrics in 1965, but they do contribute to the skln condition, a Duke University Medical Center study reported yesterday. More than half of 26 children suffering from eczema, a red, dry, itchy rash, were found to be allergic to specific foods, said Dr. Hugh Sampson, a pediatric allergist. How the foods cause eczema remains unknown, Sampson said, but he noted the tendency to have any allergy runs in families. He said eczema affects between 1 percent and 3 percent ofthe population, a range that runs from 2.2 million to 6.6 million people. -AP 
A Chicago ironworkerunable to work for 2 years because of a neck injury returned S20,000 in uncanceled checks that he found while taking a bag of food to a neighbor. Edward 
Japczyk, 63, spotted three duffelbags filled with checks made out to Wieboldt's department store Monday as he crossed a rain-dampened parking lot. Paul Miller, the store's director of security, said, "I'm sure the company would want to extend some gesture ofgratifica­tion." He did not say what that would be. Didjapczyk ever think of trying to cash the checks? "No way," he said. "We could use a couple ofbucks, but money isn't everything."-AP 
One inmate was killedand two others -one of them the dead man's brother -were injured in stabbing attacks at California's Folsom prison, authorities reported. The Labor Day at­tacks marked the eighth in eight days at the prison, bringing the 1982 total for violent incidents to 46. There were 34 attacks at Fol­som during all of 1981, and 20 during 1980. Officials said the in­crease in violence at the 2,700-inmate facility has been caused in part by increased racial tensions and an influx of younger, more violent inmates. -AP 
Hundreds of supporters of the Palestinian 
cause marched through Khartoum, Sudan to the U.S. Embassy, where 
they burned an American flag and chanted anti-American slogans to 
protest U.S. support of Israel. The group gave embassy officials a 
letter to President Reagan urging U.S. recognition of the Palestine 
Liberation Organization. The demonstrators also marched to the 
presidential palace, where they gave officials a document urging 
diplomatic support for an independent Palestinian state. Witnesses 
said the protest Monday included people of a variety of ages and 
walks oflife, but it was not known if any ofthe 500 PLO guerrias who 
came here from Beirut last month took part. The guerrillas, who left 
Lebanon under a U.S.-negotiated plan to end the Israeli siege of 
Beirut, have been settled in a camp about 100 miles north of Khar­
toum. -AP 

Movie star Sophia Loren,who spent 17 days in 
May in an Italian jail for tax evasion, has described her sentence as a "hellish and shocking experience." She denied press reports that claimed she was accorded special treatment at the women's prison at Caserta near her home town of Naples. The 47-year-old actress talked about her time in prison in an interview in Woman's Own, a British weekly women's magazine published Tuesday. "In my case, the laws on detention were applied with great vigor. No privileges -on the contrary, absolute rigidity in the interpretation ofprison 
regulations," she said. -AP 

Members of an American aid group called Operation California, including film starJulie Andrews, have arrived in the Cambodian capital of Phnom Penh, the Cambodian news agency SPK has reported. The private group, led by Richard Walden, left Bangkok last Thursday to visit orphanages, schools and hospitals in southern Vietnam and Cambodia. SPK said the group arrived in Phnom Penh Monday night from Vietnam. Mrs. andrews and her husband, director Blake Edwards, have previous connections with Vietnam and Cambodia. Mrs. Andrews adopted two Vietnamese or­phans in 1975, and in 1979 the couple chartered an aircraft for Operation California to fly in medical supplies during the Cam­bodian emergency. -AP

Corby Hall survives recession well 

The 28 religious who live at Corby Hall have survived comfortably well while our country has been subjected to 20 months of tax breaks, tax reform and econoii).ic insecurity. 
Comfortable is the most appropriate way to describe Corby Hall, the main residence at Notre Dame for mem bers ofthe Holy Cross community. 
Six concrete stairs lead to the main entrance of the 
89-year-old structure, which boasts almost 50 rooms. 
The steps support a wide gray, wooden porch. Each half of the porch encases three chairs and two hanging plants. 
Rumours of extravagant living have haunted Corby for some time. Tales include descriptions of a "Hesburgh penthouse", crystal chandeliers in priests' rooms, and a hidden jacuzzi. 
There were no hints of high living on lower floors of 
Corby. 

The pale yellow entrance hall seems in a condition 
similar to most student dorms. Gray carpeting leads to a 
hallway with parlors and guest rooms on one side; 
private rooms and a chapel on the other. 
The door to one priest's room was open. Inside, a desk covered with papers and documents filled one corner. File folders were scattered across the floor. A small bed, covered by a plain spread, was positioned against one wall. The area was the size ofa single room at Morrissey, ifnot smaller. 
Corby has few luxuries. There is no central air con­ditioning -only window fans in the television room on the first floor. Furniture looks attractive, but well­worn. 
Ninety-six religious are registered to take meals and use the fleet of 15 cars at Corby Hall. The Corby budget is financed through various sources, and 
provides only basic living and travel necessities. 

It took Father Leonard Banas his first year as Corby Hall Superior to find out just what adjustments he could make in the budget to ease the impact ofthe recession. Banas would not reveal the amount of Corby's annual budget. 
Banas finds the economic situation similar to the 
Depression, but "not as bad." Although he admits that 
he cannot speak for all ofthe priests registered at Corby 
Hall, Banas said there have been administrative read­
justments during the past two years. 
Corby Hall secretary Bert Kovacsics maintains that Corby Hall religious lead a "very conservative" lifestyle, although Banas gave serious reevaluation to several ex­penditures. 
The kitchen operation was reorganized completely. 
Banas said positions were cut, and a "very hard look" 
taken at quality offood and how it was prepared. 
Corby managed to keep costs from rising in the 
budget. 

Holy Cross religious have also been forced to look at travel expenses. Means oftravel have been reevaluated, and priests have cut back on trips. 

Clothing has had to last longer for Corby religious. "A number of people have taken a hard look at items of clothing and cut back," Banas said. "They make items last longer." 
Banas does not tolerate increases in the budget to the rate of inflation. He said supplies such as toilet articles are now bought wholesale. 
There is a strict accountability for cost at Corby now, and a significant difference in the amount consumed. 
Banas said he has also given "many exertations" on automobile use. Banas avoids using a vehicle whenever he can, unless it is absolutely necessary. 
New cars are purchased each year, but Banas con­siders this a necessity. "Someone watches the market carefully," Banas said. "We only buy American cars. The profit margin for the dealers is small." 
Corby residents use small economy cars now. When Banas came, he eliminated big cars. Chevrolet and Chrysler are the · most popular automobiles Corby residents use. 
Banas hopes the economic outlook will brighten soon. He works with parishes in Michigan, where he says people lost their jobs because they relied on the automotive in­
dustry. Banas patterns his lifestyle after they way these people live. 
The way people in parishes live is a constant im­perative for Banas. He does not use his experiences at Notre Dame as much because he thinks students here are from wealthier families. 
The poor offer a constant dictate for Corby priests. Banas said they constantly ask themselves "do I need this....can I do without it?" 
Corby Hall has gone without maintenance repairs that Banas considers long overdue. The roof is losing tiles, and the window frames need refinishing. But they're surviving...comfortably well.

Nutrition professor victim 
SusP-ectscaughtinmurder case 
NEW YORK (AP) Police captured one man after a car chase and searched for two others yester­day in the ritual murder of a Florida nutrition professor. Authorities said 
they had issued "numerous"  war­ 
rants  and  considered  the  case  
"solved."  

A man tentatively identified as Gary McNichol, 21, was arrested with the stolen car and credit cards ofProfessor Howard Appledorf, who was murdered over the weekend in his condominium near the Univer­sityofFlorida campus at Gainesville. 
Police were searching for two companions with whom McNichol was drinking at an East Side bar fre­quented by homosexuals. Police said one ofthe men had a record as a prostitute and a transvestite, and speculated the men might be dis­guised as women. 
The men left the bar after McNic­hol jumped in the car and led police cars on a chase through Manhattan at speeds up to 100 mph. 
McNichol is believed to be one of three men Florida authorities have 





Indiana rep dies in D.C. 

WASHINGTON )AP) Rep. Adam Benjamin Jr., a thirdterm Democrat who represented the steel town of Gary, Ind., was found dead in his Capitol Hill apartment Tuesday. He was 47 years old. 
Benjamin's body was found by an aide, Peter Visclosky, about 
9:10 a.m. EDT after the congress­man missed a morning appoint­ment. Benjamin's one-room efficiency apartment does not have a telephone, but is located 
only a half-block from his con­gressional office building. 
The body was taken to the Dis­trict of Columbia Medical Examiner's Office, where an autopsy was performed Tuesday afternoon. 
Deputy Medical Examiner Dr. Douglas Dixon said afterwards that he found no evidence offoul t play, but could not certify the cause of death until toxicology studies were completed Wednes­day. 
"I have no suspicion that drugs were involved, but the examina­tion would not be complete without such studies," he said. In response to questions, he·said he found evidence of heart disease, but that death coud not be at­tributed to that disease until all tests were completed.  been seeking in the slaying, accord­ing to Detective Capt. james Power. The three, whom Florida authorities declined to name, were involved in an attempt two weeks ago to cash a S900 check belonging to Appledorf. 
In Gainesville, police said that with the arrest in New York and the tentative identification of other suspects, they c.onsidered the mur­der solved. 
"1 can tell you the case is solved. We know who committed the homicide act," said Gainesville police Capt. Richard B. Ward. 
Ward  would  not  identify  the  
suspects  or  say  how  many  there  
were.  

"There are other individuals in­volved and there are numerous homicide warrants issued," Ward said. 
Gainesville police investigators were sent here to question and positively identify the man held there, Ward said. Officers also were sent to Lumberton, N.C., and police 
here have alerted officials in Boston and in Connecticut about the other wanted men, according to the police captain. 
ToUJn survives atomicshadoUJ since 1911 
By MARCIA DUNN 
AssociatedPress 

Long before the atomic bomb, 
long before nuclear power plants, 
residents of this western Pennsylva­
nia community lived with wastes 
buried by nuclear pioneers. 

Uranium processing plants, which once supplied scientist Marie Curie with radium and later helped toward building the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs, produced more than 200,000 tons of radioactive waste since 1911. The wastes now lie beneath an industrial park near this quiet, residential suburb, about 20 miles southwest ofPittsburgh. 
Saying they fear for their health, residents ofCanonsburg and nearby Strabane long have urged the federal government to speed up plans for cleaning up the site. 
But necessary government stan­dards, which were to be in place by 1979, are almost three years late. 
"When you didn't know, you weren't afraid. Now when you know, you're afraid~ It's better not knowing," said Sophie Winseck, who unwittingly used an old vat from the processing plant to catch rainwater in her backyard. 
Scientists, however, report find­ing only slightly higher rates of ill­ness among those living near the radioactive site.

Ward said police had received in­formation Monday which pointed to the North Carolina city as a stopover for some ofthe suspects. 
He refused to confirm whether more than three individuals were in­volved, but said several times that "numeroussealed murder warrants" have been issued by a judge here. 
State attorney Eugene Whitworth said that if the New York suspect waived extradition he could be returned to Florida "tomorrow or the next day. If not, it could be 30 to 60days." 
The body of Appledorf, a popular 
professor of nutrition and a well­
known defender of the nutritional 
value of so-called "junk food," was found suffocated Sunday. His body was tied and lay face up on a couch. His head was stuffed into a canvas bag of ice and swathed with sheets and pillows. 
Three plates contained the remains of submarine sandwiches. An uneaten sandwich sat on a fourth plate. The apartment was strewn with trash, and the words "murder" and "redrum" spelled backward were written on the walls.

Later, the site was taken over by 
Vitro Corp. of America, which 
processed uranium and radium, 
burying its waste there. The Atomic Energy Commission later used the property for storage. 
The industrial park is among 24 sites identified under the Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation Control Act of 1978 as requiring prompt cleanup.

gas and radium at the site in 1977. 
Up to a third ofa mile from the site, 
the emissions range from two to 
three times the normal background 
levels. Within that area, the risk of 
lung cancer would be about 25 per­cent higher, according to Depart­ment ofEnergy consultants. 
The Canonsburg site is the only one east ofthe Mississippi River and the only one surrounded by resi­dents about 8,000 of Canonsburg's 11,000 residents live within one mile ofthe facility. 
Decontamination ofthe industrial 
park and nearly 100 adjacent private properties has been stalled while government agencies finish review­ing Environmental Protection Agency standards for the cleanup. 
Angered by the delay, about 100 residents have filed classaction law­suits against the state and federal governments, six government agencies and seven corporations. 
The residents claim their health has been endangered and their property values lowered because of radioactive contamiation. "My hus­band has leukemia, and then they tell me not to worry. I worry every day," said Isabella Spinosa, who lives about 500 feet from the industrial park. 
University of Pittsburgh resear­
chers assured residents at a town 
meeting last month that radiation 
levels are not alarming. 
"The radioactive effects -if they are there -are very, very slight....l assure you this is not a serious problem that is out of control," Dr. Edward Radford said following a two-year study funded by the EPA. 
"Frankly, I would live there," said Dr. Evelyn Talbott, a native of Strabane. 
Both researchers said they found slightly higher rates ofillness among adults living within 600 yards of the industrial park as compared to those living in Muse, a community four miles away. 
The study found slightly higher rates ofthyroid abnormalities. In ad­dition, the incidence of ulcers in men and self-reported nervous and emotional disorders in women also were slightly higher, according to the study. But because only 60 per­cent of Canonsburg residents eligible for the study participated, 
the researchers said they could not conclude that the illnesses were caused by exposure to low-level na­tion. 
Both scientists said their as­surances do not apply to the 18-acre site where processing occurred Five businesses remain at the site. 
A study released earlier in the summer by Pitt doctoral student Stephan Lanes, meanwhile, con­cluded that people living near the in­dustrial park were not sigficantly 
harmed by expo radioactive element radon. 
Lanes' study indicated that lung cancer rates were not higher than elsewhere in Washington County and that lung cancer cases were not clustered around the industrial park. 
Despite such positive eports, city officials in Canonsburg say the publicity has hun business and town pride. Family reunions have been held elsewhere and real estate sales are down, says Mayor Jack Passante. 
"It's put a stigma on the area that I think is going to last for quite some time," Passante said.

BALTIMORE ( AP) -Seventeen 
years after a mysterious affliction 
crippled his right hand, pianist Leon 
Fleisher is rehearsing for a dramatic, 
two-handed return to the concert 
performing that won him world 
renown. 
Using both hands to play in public for the first time since 1965, he will play unaccompanied and with the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra at the Sept. 16 opening of Baltimore's $22 million symphony hall, before thousands of people who paid at 
least S250 each. 
"I'm looking forward to it with great pleasure," he said in a telephone interview. "It's going to be an exciting evening." 
Fleisher, 54, spent years searching for a cure, even trying shock treat­ment and hypnosis. He became depressed and acted like an "ogre" to people around him. He learned piano works for the left hand and took up conducting, but he didn't give up hope. 
In 1977, explaining that he didn',t 
want to become a full-time specialist 
in works for the left hand, Fleisher 
said: "I'm quite cenain that soon~r

Fleisher underwent physiot­herapy and psychotherapy in unsuc­cessful efforts to cure the ailment: Then in}anuary 1981 he underwent an operation at Massachusetts General to correct a new and not necessarily related problem called carpal tunnel syndrome. 
Before surgery, it was almost im­possible for Fleisher to even hold a baton, hospital spokesman Martin Bander said. His little and ring fin­gers tended to clench. 
After the operation, the clenching returned, but to a much lesser de­gree, Bander said. It was then that physical therapy began. 
Carpal tunnel syndrome "was a subsequent problem," said Fleisher. "We couldn't deal with the first problem until we took care ofthat." 
His doctors were the first to see him play again with two hands, a hospital spokesman said. He per­formed for them at a hospital chapel.

London's Standard newspaper reported that the British Army's Spe­cial Air Service commando squad was sending men to Bern to "advise the Swiss police on how to set up listening devices and try to install a minuscule fisheye camera in the building to watch the gunmen."

Their leader, who gave his name only as Col. Wysocki, has said that if the demands are not met, he and his "anti-communist paramilitary squad" will blow up the embassy with 55 pounds of dynamite they claim to possess. 
At first, Hubacher said there were 14 hostages, but later reported there were only 12, including three women who were released. The Polish news agency said in Warsaw, however, that there still were 10 hostages in the embassy.

Strong vocals by Greg Kihn kept the crowd roc.dng on its feet throughout their set.

The Greg Kihn Band prov .d to the audience they were a versatile group by their encore performance of "For Your Love." Each member ofthe band sang a few stanzas ofthe song, showingall that the talents were not concentrated in one member. 
The Greg Kihn Band excelled as a rock act, but it was evident the crowd looked ahead to the feature aurae· tion. 
And an attraction he was. For the clearly younger audience, any movement 
near the stage sent them into hysterics. In between the two acts, the crowd waited and finally received the 33· year-old teen star with open mouths. Clad in a yellow shirt and aviator-style pants, Rick Springfield wooed and wowed the crowd all night. 
Through a lit cloud ofsmoke, Springfield leaped and 
cranked out a succession of hits, which included 
"Khristina", "Love is Alright Tonight," and 
"Everybody's Girl." He blasttd the crowd as he bopped 
and kicked his way around the stage, while the crowd 
roared its approval. 

Right from the start, Springfield emitted a dynamic 
jolt that reached out to the audience. The crowd 
seemed to'respond to every little contortion or smirk, 
even to a nod ofhis head. 

This frenzied phenomena showed itselfbest when 
Springfield near the middle of his set that the next song 
was dedicated to his father, who died over a year ago. 
He sat down to play an instrumental on an acoustical 
guitar, but wao; heckled by intermittent whoops and 
hollers from unruly adolescents. Even this display of 
rudeness failed to spoil the show. 
Springfield perhaps showed his singing talents best 
when he sang "Inside Sylvia," a slow ballad he also ac· 
companied on keyboards. The ballad led him into a solo 
on an acoustical guitar, which showed his diverse 
talents. 

But the guitar playing ofJimmy Price rose above the 
main attraction. Price's clarity and style outshone that 
ofSpringfield's many times, but the two complemented 
each other well. 

While the middle ofthe concert lagged, the best was 
saved until the last, with "Don't Talk to Strangers" and 
"Jessie's Girl" ripping the lid off the A.C.C. Springfield's 
incessant motion and his strong supporting band 
cranked out fine entertainment. 
The crowd screamed for and got an encore, one that surprised the listeners by playing the end of"Jessie's Girls" before sending the love-struck adolescents home with the tune "I've Done Everything For You." 
Last night's concert displayed the experienced talents of the two different bands. The Greg Kihn Band, which started five years ago in California, proved they could still rock the audiences. Rick Springfield, who has been in and out ofthe music scene for over ten years in Australia (his homeland) and in the United States, has hit upon a market for his diverse talents and charm. 
Put together, this combination produces entertain­ment -at any age.

The last three-or-more-record set to do the same was George Har­rison's three-record opusAl/ Things Must Pass in 1970. 

7. 
The last album to yield five Hot 100 singles was Foreigner 4 (they were "Urgent," "Waiting for a Girl Like You," "Juke Box Hero," "Break It Up" and "Luanne"). 

8. 
The last single released by a non-major to hit number one was from Boardwalk Records-JoanJett and the Blackhearts' "l Love Rock 'n' Roll." 

9. 
The last chart-topping single of the 1970s was "Escape (The Pma Colada Song)" by Rupert Holmes. 


1o. The last top-! 0 single by the Beach Boys was 1976's "Rock and Roll Music," taken from their last top-1 0 album, 15 Big Ones.

Winwood bncktnlk 

teve Winwood is an artist at the mercy of his lyricists. S This is no reflection upon the man himself, an acknowledged star at 16 with Traffic and part of the infamous "super-group". Blind Faith. 
Winwood writes haunting electronic melodies on his keyboards, melodies that surround and carress the lyrics his soulful voice croons out, displayed at its finest on his hit album of 1980,Arc ofa Diver, his biggest commercial success oflate. 
His latest release, Talking Back To The Night, had all ofits lyrics 
written by Will Jennings, who wrote "When You See A Chance". 
I hope he feels ashamed of himself. 
Ofthe nine lyrics on this album, eight are garbage and these eight 
make the ninth look decent. But this is by no means the only 
problem of the album. Even in his days with Traffic, Win wood had 
problems keeping his inspiritational juices flowing throughout anal­
bum. 


Ed KonrGdy 
record review 
Now that he is self-producing his solo albums and playing all ofthe instruments, Winwood is even more vulnerable to this situation. 
Getting the most out ofa work has been Winwood's genius, but on Talking Back To The Night, there is very little to work with, and what is there has not been fully developed. 
A perfect example ofthe latter is the title song, which is still one of the two best songs on the album. 
jennings pens the only good set oflyrics on the album and Win­wood's music envelopes it well, but Winwood's voice doesn't put the feelings onto the vinyl. 
The lyrics paint vivid pictures (Stranded in the dark ofa vision in a 
park/A poet in his madness tries to find another line/And he's losing 
and he's using/And he says he's doing fine) and Winwood's syn· 
thesizers set an excellent mood. But Winwood sounds tired, as ifhe 
knows the rest ofthe album has used his energy up, and knows by 
now he's used it all in the wrong places. 
The other song that stands head and shoulders (or music and lyrics if you prefer) above the rest is the opening cut, "Valerie". While the song does flash moments oftenderness, it also manages to reach the depths ofbanality. The lyrics have their moments (So cool, she was like jazz on a summer's day/Music, high and sweet, then she just blew away ...) and Winwood's music sets the song apart, but the voice, that soulful voice that put "Arc ofa Diver" on the charts, plays tricks. 
Unique phrasing comes in at varied times, but doesn't give an in­sight on the song; it distracts the listener from it. The use ofan echo while singing in staccato gives an erie "just to prove I've got these special effects" attitude toward this song. 
The single that was released this year, and deservedly went nowhere, "Still in The Game" features a pulsing keyboard that tries to drive trite and banal lyrics. 
Winwood's soft ~nd soulful vocals rise with his music above the pedestrian lyrics of"And I Go." This is Winwood at his best, making an average song seem good. The break seems ill-timed, but it just proves that even Winwood needs a good song to start with. 
On "There's A River", Winwood tries too hard to save this melodramatic piece of trash. Tqis soulless rubbish gets a much bet­ter effort than "Talking Back To The Night" and much, much more than it deserved. 
"Help Me Angel" features junior-high lyrics that give an impres­sion of muzak drowning in sweetness. 
Two songs, "While There's A Candle Burning" and "It Was Happi­ness" prove that Winwood must have had an idea what the album sounded like ....even he sounds bored and disinterested. The music finds a comfortable riffand proceeds to bury it into the ground. The chorus break on both songs inspires sleep and all in all, total hopelessness. 
l'm reviewing"Big Girls Walk Away" last because it typifies the al­bum as a whole. Jennings was obviously more worried about his lyrics rhyming than making sense. 
1fyou respect Steve Winwood and his music pick upArc OfA Diver or Traffic when he played with the group ofthe same name. You'll hear him at his best, not his most banal.

The Observer Sports Special-Soccer Wednesday, September 8, 1982-page 11 
Soccer squad seeks to iniprove even niore 
By SAM SHERRILL 
Sports Writer 
After a year in which the Fighting Irish soccer team posted their most impressive season ever, including an upset of then-No.1 ranked St. Louis, can this year's edition really hope to better such a standard? The answer appears to be yes. Coach Rich Hun­ter, in his sixth season as head coach, feels that the squad's greatest strength will be teamwork. 
"This team, unlike some in the 
past, doesn't really have one in­
dividual star," Hunter says. "But our 
team has good overall talent. We 
have five men up front who arc 
capable ofgiving us nine, ten, eleven 
goals. So we're expecting more of a 
balanced scoring attack." 
Senior Gerard McCarthy will be 
the starter in goal after a one-year 
hiatus. Another returnee will be tri­
captain Mark Luetkehans, back after 
a year abroad, to play the important 
position ofsweeper. The three start­
ing fullbacks will be seniors Brad 
McCurrie and Larry Smith and junior 
Ted Schwartz. The other two tri­
captains, Mike Sullivan and Jay 
Schwartz, will anchor the midfield, 
with Steve Berry rounding out the 
halfback corps. Up front, junior Ken 
Harkenrider and sophomore Rich 
Herdegen are slated to man the 
wings, with senior Mario Manta the 
center forward. 
Hunter has been pleased with the 
dedication the players have shown. 
"When you lose players like Jim 
Stein (fullback) and Sami Kahale (last year's leading scorer), it can naturally create problems, bringing in new people. But the players havt· really been great about keeping up their workout schedule over the summer. We started working in January, and the guys have really sacrificed a lot. We're much further along than 1thought we'd be.'' 
Add to these comments the prospect of several quality fresh­men, and you sec the reason for the optimism surrounding the squad. 
But what of that elusive NCAA 
Tournament bid? "The reason get· 
ting to the NCAA is so difficult," 
Hunter explains, "is that there is 
such an unusually small number of 
tournament spots. Nevertheless, .1 
think we have a chanc<' at it. It 
depends on how we do in our big 
games, like Ohio State, Akror, and 
Indiana. If we get the scoring up 
front and the halfbacks contribute, I 
think we'll do well." 
"Teams like Indiana, we can beat 
them, but we're just not really "of 
their caliber. The main reason for 
that is the amount of financial back· 
ing they get from their university 
which we just don't get from ours. 
It's really discouraging to me how 
little support the Athletic Depart­
ment gives us in relation to some of 
the other sports." 
The outlook appears to be good, 
then, for this year's lrlsll socccr 
team, and, if injuries don't pop up 
and the ball bounces the right way, 
they may finally end up in the NCAA. 
Soccer action starts tonight at 7:00 
at Cartier Field.

How many coaches do you know of who can boast a 93-24-6 career record -all in the first five years of his program's existence? Rich Hun­ter's Notre Dame soccer teams have not only been consistent winners, but also hold the national records for longest winning streak ( 26) and goals scored in a season ( 116). Hun­ter, however, is the last one to take 
credit for these successes. 
"I think the players deserve all the credit," he says. "I don't like any per­sonal acclaim. Leave it to them.'' Nevertheless, it's safe to say that without Rich Hunter, there might not be a soccer team at Notre Dame, and certainly not one of the caliber there is now. 
From the start, Hunter's teams were successful, compiling a I6-l-l record in their maiden season. But the schedule then was nothing like it is now. "Teams like St. Louis, In­diana, and the others (regulars in the national ran kings) are on our 
schedule every year now," Hunte,r 
explains. "This weekend we'll be 
going to Rochester for that tourna­
ment (including Georgetown, 
Syracuse, and Rochester). All four 
teams are highly competitive. 
Syracuse is of Top Twenty caliber 
and probably has the beSt 
goalkeeper in the country. So things 
are a lot tougher now. A team like 
1think theplayers 

deserve all the credit. I don't like anypersonal acclaim. Leave it to 
them.' 
IUPU -that we open with -wa:; the kind of team that we used to have trouble with back in 1977. But now we look at that game as a chance to work on our skills and concentrate on the basics." 
Even with the increasingly dif­ficult schedules, the Irish have main­tained their successful tradition. Last

year's edition finished 16-3-3, including quality showings against most of the big names on the schedule. The secret? Dedication. Dedication from the players and from the coach. It is no exaggeration to say that the majority ofthe neces­sities for a quality Notre Dame soc­cer team have been contributed by Rich Hunter himself 
A 1971 graduate of Notre Dame, 
Hunter later earned his law degree 
here and presently teaches courses 
in business law in the College of Business. But the majority of his time is spent on the soccer team, which he almost singlehandedly has brought to the point it's at today. 
His philosophy is simple -"I tell the guys out there to just con­centrate on doing what you do best. Don't try to be what you can't. I could try and be a criminal lawyer, but I don't think I could do as good a 
job as I can as a teacher and a coach. 
If you do your best, then I think 
you're a success, win or lose." 
At the end of the year, one of the 
biggest rumors on campus usually 
has Rich Hunter leaving Notre Dame 
for greener pastures. Every August, 
however, has found him still holding 
court in the classroom and on the 
soccer field. Is this year finally going 
to be his last under the shadow of 
the Golden Dome? 
"l don't really have too much ofa 
say about that. I'm not tenured here, 
so it's really out of my hands. I've 
been here ten years now, and 
sometimes I think about doing other 
things. Someday it may be time to 
move on. But I don't really know 
when." 
Few personalities on campus can 
boast of the popularity which Hun­
ter enjoys, evidenced by the way in 
which studeitts fight to get in his 
classes, and the high demand for 
recommendations from him. The 
greatest accolade, however, came in 
1981 when he was elected Senior 
Class Fellow -an honor previously 
bestowed on the likes of Eugene 
McCarthy, Ara Parseghian, and Ray 
Meyer. No coach is more deserving 
ofsuch praise. 
Similarly, the Notre Dame soccer program takes a back seat to football. There are no Notre Dame soccer highlights on network television and it doesn't matter what the coach used to hum on his way to little league practice. The alumni don't 
pay to see it so no one is goingto get 
paid to play it. 
That's right, no scholarships. Just a 
desire to play the game and to go to a 
good school. 
It is this sacrificing, hard-working attitude which Luetkehans · ex­emplifies most. Suffice it to say that if Pete Rose had played soccer, he probably would have played a lot like Luetkehans. 
"An aggressive player? Yes, I guess I play pretty hard," said Luetkehans. "But I also feel I use a lot offinesse. 
"The way I play helps to ,in­timidate opposing players," confessed the senior midfielder, one of the team's tri-captains. "When I make a tackle I try to use a lot of my body just to let the guy know .it's me." 
Lest you think Mark is just a run­of-the-mill goon, take note ofthe fact that he played in 2 5 games .as a fresh-· man and 24 ·games as a Sbph·o.more. Luetkehans came out of high school with all-conference, all-sectional 
and all-Midwest honors. · 
During his freshman campaign Mark played with a fractured arm throughout a good part of the season. "In my senior year of high school I broke the wrist in a baseball game (breaking up a double play) 
and I didn't find out it was fractured unti!Jater on in the season. 
The arm took so long to heal that Luetkehans finally had to get an operation before his sophomore year. 
Hardships are nothing new to the Morrissey Hall resident, who is tack­ling a schedule that would even make Gerry Faust cringe. Mark iJi taking 20 credit hours as.an architec· tural student -with a few civil engineering courses thrown in to break up the monotony. He's also AROTC. 
No, Luetkehans isn't mentally ill. 
He just knows how to tackle a tough· 
workload. "As long as you know you _ 
have to do a certain thing you can 
keep going at it," he said. 
The Irish will also have a tough 
road ahead -trying to overcome 
the loss of several key players from 
last year's 16-3-3 team -as the team 
seeks its first-ever NCAA tourna­
ment bid. 
With a little student support, the 
Irish could have a very rewarding 
season. "Our support has been get· .ting better each year," observed Luetkehans. "Everyone has worked ~ very hard; especially Coach (Rich) Hunter. 
"The Rochester Tourney (with Georgetown, Syracuse, Rochester and the Irish) will be a major hurdle in our schedUle. If we can do well · there, I think it will be a good year." 
The trip, incidentally, will not be 
made through the friendly skies. 
Word has that Luetkehans will be 
the one driving the bus.

Races tighten as baseball season winds up 
Dodgers back in 1st, 
down Cincinnati 

CINCINNATI (AP) Dusty 
Baker drove in four runs with a 
homer, double and single as the Los 
Angeles Dodgers regained first place 
in the National League West with an 
8-4 victory over the Cincinnati Reds 
last night. 

The Dodgers' win put them one­
half game ahead of Atlanta, which 
lost to San Francisco. 

Baker's two-run double keyed a 
five-run third inning and he added a 
two-run homer in the sixth. 

Reliever Dave Stewart, 8-7, got 
the victory. He replaced starter 
Rickey Wright as the Reds scored 
three runs in the second inning. 

Singles by Johnny Bench nd Paul Householder, a sacrifice and Alex Trevino's intentional walk loaded the bases for · Cincinnati in the second. Reds' starter Greg Harris, 2­5, then lined a two-run single. After Stewart came in, Rafael Landestoy's RBI groundout made it 3-0. 
Twins 8, Rangers 1 

ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) Randy Bush and Kent Hrbek homered during a five-run fifth in­ning last night that carried the Min­nesota Twins to an 8-1 victory over the Texas Rangers. 
Hrbek homered for the third time in three games against Texas this week, while Bush got his second homer in as many games as the Twins accumulated 15 hits. Gary Ward had four of those hits. 
Twins starter AI Williams, 7-7, got relief help frorn Ron Davis, who earned his 18th save with three shutout innings. Texas pitcher Jim Farr made his major-league debut in reliefofstarter Steve Comer, 1-6.

Bush doubled home Ward in the second for a 1-0 Twins lead, and led offthe fifth with his second homer to make it 2-0. Lenny Faedo followed with a double, and scored on a single by Bobby Mitchell, who took second on the throw home. After Tom Brunansky's RBI single made it 4-0, Hrbek clubbed his 22nd homer to right field. 
Brewers 4, Tigers 0 

MILWAUKEE (AP) Cecil Cooper lined a three-run homer to cap a four-run eighth inning and Don Sutton scattered seven hits for his first Milwaukee victory, leading the Brewers to a 4-0 win over the Detroit Tigers last night. 
Sutton, 1-1, acquired by Mil­
waukee from Houston on Aug. 30, 
struck out nine and walked none as 
the Brewers kept a three-game lead 
over second-place Baltimore in the 
American League East. It was Sut­
ton's sixth complete game of the 
year. 

Loser Dan Petry, 14-8, carried a 
three-hitter into the eighth when Ed 
Romero beat out a single to deep 
shortstop. Romero raced to third on 
a hit-and-run single by Paul Molitor 
and Robin Yount slapped a single to 
left, his third hit, to break a scoreless 
tie. 

Cooper then lined a 2-0 pitch into 
the right-field seats for his 28th 
homer, finishing Petry. 
Orioles 7, Yanks 2 

NEW YORK (AP) John Lowenstein cracked three hits, including his 22nd homer of the season, and drove in two runs to sup­port Mike Flanagan's fifth straight tri­umph as Baltimore defeated the New York Yankees 7-2 Tuesday night, giving the Orioles their I Oth svaight victory and I 7th in their last 18games.

The streak is Baltimore's longest since 1980, when the Orioles captured I 0 in a row from Aug. 1 through Aug. 11. It is the second lon­gest winning streak in the American League this season, topped only by Cleveland's 11-game winning streak from May 23-June 4. 
Baltimore has not lost since Aug. 27, when it dropped the second game ofa doubleheader to Texas. 
Flanagan, 13-10, making his 30th start this year, lasted seven innings and gave up 10 hits and two runs while walkmg none and striking out four. Tippy Martinez pitched the final two innings.

CLEVELAND (AP)-Alan Bannis­ter's bases-loaded single with two outs in the bottom ofthe I Oth inning scored Rick Manning to give the Cleveland Indians a 5-4 victory over the Boston Red Sox last night. 
With one out in the lOth, Miguel Dilone doubled to right-center off Mark Clear, 13-8. Rick Manning was walked intentionally and pinch­hitter Mike Hargrove walked to load the bases. 
Bill Nahorodny then hit a check­swing grounder to third baseman Carney Lansford, who forced Dilone at the plate for the second out. But Bannister followed with his single down the left-field line.

his single to center. 
Expos 7, Cards 4 
ST. LOUIS (AP) -Tim Wallach and Andre Dawson slugged two-run homers as the Montreal Expos managed only six hits but defeated the St. Louis Cardinals 7-4last night. 
The two home runs handed St. Louis its fourth setback in five games, paring the Cardinals' lead in the National League East to a half­game over the Philadelphia Phillies, who beat Chicago. 
Montreal, moving within 3 and a 
half games of St. Louis, scored two 
go-ahead runs in the fifth inning 
without benefit ofa hit. 
After Wallach hammered 20th home run of the season off rookie Jeff Lahti, 4-3, to produce a 3-3 tie in the fourth, the Expos loaded the bases in the fifth on three walks. 
Veteran reliever Jim Kaat un­
corked a wild pitch, sending winner 
Bryn Smith, 2-1, home from third 
base. Montreal gathered a second 
run on AI Oliver's infield out and 
lockd up its victory on Dawson's 
two-run smash, his 19th, off Steve 
Mura in the seventh. 
Jeff Reardon pitched the three in­
nings to gain his 23rd save. 
Giants,3, Braves 2

and a single to lead the Houston 
Astros to a 4-3 win over the San 
Diego Padres last night. 
DiPino, who came from Mil­
waukee as part of the Don Sutton 
trade last week, pitched only five in­
nings. The rookie left-bander struck 
out the first four hitters he faced and 
allowed seven hits and walked none 
before giving way to Dan Boone, 
who earned his second save with 
four innings ofone-hit relief. Boone 
struck out three and walked none. 
Thon's RBI single and a run­
scoring double by Ray Knight gave 
Houston a 2-0 off loser Juan Eichel­
berger, 7-12, in the third inning. 
The Padres tied the score on Sixto 
Lezcano's run-scoring single in the 
fourth and Garry Templeton's

Players, NFL back at the table 

WASHINGTON (AP)-National Football League contract talks resume today, with team owners ready to raise their money offer and the players' union refusing to rule out the possibility of a strike before Sunday's start ofthe regular season. 
Sources close to the NFL Manage­ment Council, which represents the owners, told The Associated Press yesterday that the new offer, while not addressing the players' demand for salaries based on a guaranteed percentage of gross revenues, will include "a substantial across-the­board wage hike." They would not elaborate. 
Ed Garvey, executive director of the NFL players Association, said that it was "highly unlikely" that a strike culd be averted unless wages were tied to a fixed percentage of gross revenues. 
He did say, however: "we will dis­cuss any offer that is a basis for future negotations." 
The owners' last offer was 
rejected out ofhand by the union. 
Garvey refused to rule out a strike 
this weekend. "We're still discussing 
our options," he said. 
At last month's meeting of player 
representatives in Chicago, the uni­
on reaffirmed its demands for sub­
stantial wage increases for all 
players, a guaranteed fair share of 
revenues and elimination of what 
the union considers incentives for 
teams to cut older players for finan­
cial reasons. 
"Ifthe owners' new proposal does not address these issues, there can­not be an agreement," Garvey in­
sisted yesterday. 
Both sides, however, will con­
tinue to meet separately with 
McMurray, and he said he would be 
available to help this week ifasked. 
Union officials, meanwhile, 
expressed renewed concern about 
retaliation by club owners toward 
team player representatives. 
Monday, the Buffalo Bills waived tackle Mike Kadish, a former Notre Dame standout, and the second player rep in a week to be cut. 
"We are talking to Kadish to determine all of the circumstances of his waiver," Garvey said. "The players that are losing their jobs are capable and should be working somewhere. We have said all along that we won't be able to reach an agreement until all of the player representatives have some job with their teams."

Irish volleyball team set to open 
By MIKE SULLIVAN 
Sports Writer 
The woman's volleyball team, younger but more experienced than everand armed with a new system of offensive plays, is ready to begin its third varsity season and its first year in Division I with a match tomorrow 
against IUSB. 
Coach Sandy Van Slager's squad is looking to improve on its first two seasons in which it compiled 3-19 and 17-25 records, respectively. The marked improvement should con­tinue this season. 
"The improvement between the first and second years was a definite indication of the team's growth," said Van Slager. "There should be even more improvement this year, though. On a scale of ten, there should be seven or eight points im­
provement." 
Van Slager may seem to be overly optimistic, but she feels that there is good reason to be optimistic. 
"The girls have been training in the off-season," she explains. "We had the girls lift increased amounts of weight. We've also stressed com­petitive involvement. From February to May we competed in the USVA (U.S. Volleyball Association). It gave us game experience that will help us this year." 
The addition oftwo more scholar­ship freshmen will also give the team a big boost. Their credentials speak for themselves. Karen Bauters ( Mishawaka,In.) competed in the Junior Olympic National Competi­tion and was named most valuable player in the volleyball competition which fielded over 100 teams. Mary Mclaughlin was named most valuable player in her league in Santa Barbara, California which is in the heart ofvolleyball country. 
Van Slager also is impressed by the ability ofwalk-on Tracy Bennington 
(Colorado Springs, Co.) who has a 
vertical leap of 23 inches. "She 
jumps higher than the girls I have 
been training for a year,"said Van 
Slager. 
These three freshmen join a team 
that includes seven letter-winners 
from last year's squad, including the 
team's first two scholarship winners, 
sophomores Mary Jo Hensler 
(Cincinnati, Oh.) and Josie Mater­
nowski (South Bend, ln. ). 
Senior Jackie Pagley (Miami, Fl.) and juniors Maureen Morin (Mishawaka, ln.) and Terese Henken (Carlyle, 11.) are the veterans of the te,lJOl, while sophomores Robin Is­rael (North Huntington, Pa) and Julia Pierson (Portland, Or.) also return from last year's team. 
The increased experience has given the team something it needed badly -depth. This depth will be most evident on offense. 
"Depth on offense is a major strength now,"explained Assistant Coach Dan Anderson. "Before, while it wasn't a weakness, it wasn't too good. 
"The experience has made the girls easier to teach and they're now learning to control an offensive sys­tem. We can now have a game plan for every match." 
These game plans will involve set 
offensive plays, a new addition to the 
team's play. 
"Last year,"said Van Slager, "our 
offense was a basic middle attack. 
This year we are trying to confuse 
the opponents with our movements. 
We'll try to draw their defense away 
from the spot where the ball will go 
over the net. Like basketball, we're 
going to do a lot offaking." 
"We'll be doing a lot more than 
just trying to get the ball over the 
net,"added Anderson. 
Ifthe team is to be successful in its 
new offense, however, it is going to 
have to overcome its major weak­
ness -youth. 
. . .Boyer 
"The newness of the program is a 
major weakness,"said Van· Slager. 
"We have a young team. Most ofth~ 
starters will be freshmen and sopho­
mores, so they haven't played to­
gether much." 
It will not take much time for the ·team to get used to each other. 
Unlike last year, the team will play a 
large number of early season 
matches, including tough matches 
against Michigan and Michigan State. 
"Record improvement" is the coaches' main goal for the season. "Last year," said Van Slager, "my goal was to go .500. We didn't reach that so I felt it should be this year's goal. However, we can do better than that." 
Will the women's volleyball team at Notre Dame ever become a na­tional powerhouse? "If they let the program grow, we will get there," said Van Slager. "Right now the ath­letic department seems favorable. It all boils down to getting the best players who have the grades to get into the school. We have to find a balance between skill and academics. 
"We may never be the best, but I 
think we will be competition for the 
best. If we're competitive, people 
will want to play us and we'll get bet­
ter because the only way we're 
going to get better is to play teams 
that are equal to us or better." 
The IUSB game that will be played 
Thursday at 7:30 in the ACC Pit will 
show how far the Irish have come. 
Their opponents are beginning a 
volleyball program of their own this 
year. Both Van Slager and Anderson 
feel that the match should be won 
easily. 
Perhaps one of the biggest ques­
tions to be answered on Thursday is 
whether the Pit, an auxiliary gym, is 
an acceptable place for the team to 
play. Past games have more than 
filled the small number of seats. If a 
match against tiny IUSB can fill the 
gym, the possibility ofplaying in the 
arena might be considered. 
Dan Anderson sums up the 
upcoming year by saying that "there 
is no place to go but up."

Cardinals won the World Series in seven games over the New York Yankees that year with the help of a Boyer grand slam home run. Boyer hit .300 or better five times for St. Louis and cracked 255 of his 282 career home runs for the club. He had 1,141 career RBI, includ­
ing 1,001 for St. Louis. His 32 home 
runs in 1960 were the most ever by a St. Louis third baseman.

At U.S. Open 

Martina upset by doubles partner 
NEW YORK (AP) -Top-seeded Martina Navratilova was denied. a shot at the Grand Slam and a $500,000 bonus Tuesday when she was upset by her doubles partner, Pam Shriver, 1-6 7-6,6-2 in the quar­terfinals of the U.S. Open Tennis Championships. 
It was only the second loss this year for Navratilova, who has. dominated women's tennis, and stopped a 4I-match winning streak. 
In another upset, Rodney Harmon surprised eighth-seeded Eliot Teltscher 6-4, 4-6, 6-3, 3·6, 7-6 in a men's fourth-round match. 
"She had all the pessure on her," the seventh-seeded Shriver said of the Czechoslovakian-bom left­bander. ~·i feel sorry for her, but I'M happy for myself, ofcourse." 
Also advancng into the quacter­firials was fourh-seeded Guillermo Vilas, who outlasted hard-serving Steve Denton, the No. I2 seed, 3-6, 4-6, 6-3, 7-6, 6-3. 
In a night match, veteran Hie Nastase of Romania met second-seeded Jimmy Connors, with the winner to face Harmon, ofSouthern Methodist University, the nation's top-ranked collegiate player this 
year. 
Navratilova won the first set in I 7 minutes as she broke the 20-year-old Shriver in the fourth and sixth games. Navratilova, who had reached the quarters without losing a set, appeared to be heading for the semifinals when she broke Shriver in the ninth game of the second set for a 5-4 lead. 
But Shriver broke back in the I Oth game and fought off a break point in the IIth game before holding serve. 
After  Navratilova  held  serve  to  
send  the  second  set  into  a  
tiebreaker,  Shriver  lost  the  first  

point when she netted a forehand volley, then quickly pulled into a 2-I lead as Navratilova netted the ball twice. 
But Shriver double-faulted to even the score, then she again took the lead when Navratilova found the net with a forehand volley. 
The tiebreaker then went on serve as Shriver won 7-5, tying the match at I-1. ­
In the third set, the two held serve until the fifth game, when two un­forced errors gave Shriver a 30-0 lead. A forehand down the line made it 40-0 before Navratilova took the next two points. 

But Shriver broke her opponent 
when Navratilova's forehand off a 
service return sailed long. 
The Lutherville, Md., player, who reached the final here in I978, losing to Chris Evert, before shoul­der trouble hampered her the next two years, broke Navratilova again in the seventh game, again at 30, for a 5-2 lead. 
Navratilova, who had won the last three Grand Slam tournaments -the Australian and French Opens, and Wimbledon -had a break point, at 40-30, in the eighth game, but a cross-court backhand was wide, bringing the score to deuce. 
F'ormer Card great Boyer dead at 51 
ST. LOUIS (AP) -Ken Boyer 
btlttled cancer with the same hard­
nosed enthusiasm that he brought to 
baseball, his former St. Louis Car­
dinal teammates say. 
Boyer died yesterday morning at 
the age of 51. 
"He was a real battler, not a show­man like some players today," said former Cardinal Manager Red Schoendienst. "Kenny said yester­day that he believed he could come back from this. He went down fight­ing." 
Boyer, who managed the Car­dinals for two seasons, was considered the Cards' greatest third baseman. 
He played more than 2,000 games in his 15-year playing career, which included stints with three other teams. And he was a lifetime .287 hit­ter, a seven-time All-Star, and five 

times the Gold Glove Winner for 
third basemen. 
August A. Busch Jr., president of 
the Cardinals, said yesterday: "Ken 
Boyer gave the Cardinals and the 
baseball fans of St. Louis many great 
moments to remember, and we will 
remember him with admiration and 
respect." 
Bing Devine, who was general 
manager of the Cardinals during 
Boyer's years with the club, said 
Boyer never complained about his 
ailment. 
"He never complained about his illness or sat around wondering, 'Why me.'," Devine said. "That's the type ofplayer he was. He went about his job and never complained." 
Schoendienst called Boyer a "hard-nosed player who made 'em

AssociateSports Editor 
Question: What do Notre Dame and the Los Angeles Rams have in common? Answer: An annual quar­terback controversy. 
That used to be the case. But, like the Rams, the Irish do not have a quarterback controversy this year. Blair Kiel is the man. Period. 
"There's no question Blair has the job," says Coach Gerry Faust. "I think that will help him play with more confidence and poise." 

The confidence and poise may be crucial, considering that Kiel is learninganother new passing game. 
1t's a totally new system, andwe have alotofwork to do.' 

The man behind the new system is Quarterback Coach Ron Hudson. Hired by the Irish last spring after three seasons at UCLA, Hudson has been hard at work with Kiel and the other Irish quarterbacks. 
Hudson, who worked at California under Mike White (now head coach at Illinois) is well-versed in all facets of the passing game. He's designed a system that he hopes will utilize the 
, talents ofKiel and his receivers. 
"It's a totally new system, and we still have a lot of work to do," says Hudson. "But Blair has progressed well until now and we expect him to continue progressing." 
According to Hudson, this year's passing game "will be completely different from last year's." Different formations and more complicated pass routes will be used. But most importantly, the system will high­light the skills of tight end Tony Hunter. 
"The big difference between this year's passing game and last year's is the fact that Hunter will stay at tight end," says Hudson. Since Hunter was called on to play three positions ­wingback, flanker and tight end ­
~ last season, he was never able to find a home in the offense. "We'll be run­ning more short patterns in order to use Tony," Hudson says. "He can be very effective." 
Besides helping him learn a new system, Hudson has also tutored Kiel in other facets ofthe game. The main criticism of Kiel over the past two years has been his lack of a good throwing touch. According to Hud­son, Kiel has improved in this area. "We run touch drills every practice, and Blair improves daily," he says. 
Kiel ( 6-1, 199) has started most of Notre Dame's games over the past two seasons, and Hudson says thiit his experience shows. "He's finding 
_ the secondary receivers better now," says Hudson. "He's following the pass progression and making decisions while on his feet." 
For those who really miss an Irish 

quarterback controversy, one may 
be found when examining Kiel's 
back-ups. 
Ken Karcher and Jim O'Hara are listed behind Kiel. Or O'Hara and Karcher. 
Karcher, a 6-2, 204pound· sopho­
more, played four varsity games last 
season but did not attempt a pass. A 
highly-touted freshman last year, 
Karcher has yet to live up to his bil­
ling. 
O'Hara, a 6-1, 188-pound senior, 
earned a football scholarship this 
season after three years as a walk-on. 
O'Hara is known as a heady quarter­
back who seldom makes mistakes, 

but his lack of size is considered a rrutin obstacle. 
So who's the number two quarter­back? "We'll find out after the scrimmage," says Hudson, referring to today's practice. "Both of them have very good arms and are capable ofplaying for Notre Dame. We'll see wllo comes through with the big play. It'll be a winner-take-all situa­tion." 
Kevin Smith and Todd Lezon are listed behind the top three quarter­backs. Smith, a 6-5 205-pound junior, worked with the junior var­sity last season. Lezon, a 6-4, 200­pound freshman, was chosen to the Adidas/Scholastic Coach prep All­America team. "Lezon and Smith both need more experience," Hud­son says. "The more they play, the 
better they'll get. 
As far as Hudson is concerned, all 
of his quarterbacks are making a dif­
ficult transition. "It will take time for

The baseball races tightened in all four divisions last night, as the season entered the home stretch. 
In the American League East, Mil­waukee got its first win out ofnewly­acquired Don Sutton, and the Brewers maintained their lead over Baltimore and Boston. The Orioles were in New York, where Mike

In the ·National League, the Phillies crept a little closer to their Eastern Division rivals, the St. Louis Cardinals. Philadelphia had to come from behond with two out in the ninth to down the Chicago Cubs, 7­5, at Wrigley Field. Garry Maddox delivered the game winner in that one. In St. Louis, the Expos needed just six hits to beat the Cardinals, 7­4, but two ofthem were home runs. 
The Cards now have just a one game lead over the Phils. 
In the West, the Los Angeles Dodgers once again took over the lead. Dusty Baker was the hero as the Dodgers topped the Cincinnati Reds 8-4. Baker had four RBI's. The Braves, meanwhile, were losing to the Giants in Atlanta. Chili Davis and Reggie Smith had homers to give San Francisco a 3-2 win. 
L.A. now has a slim half-game mar­gin over Atlanta.

Leftoversfrom the summer 
Like many of you, I'm a sports fanatic. I suppose my infawation with the world of sports had some bearing on my choice of a university. Notre Dame is a great place to get a "sports fix." 
Each May, however, college sports comes to a screeching halt. Each summer, therefore, I delve into professional sports to satisfy my habit. 
Due to the recent installation of cable television at 
my house, I was bombarded by many events and 
opinions this summer. Nawrally, I formed some 
opinions of my own ... 
The talk ofthe baseball world this summer was Rick­ey Henderson. The Oakland leftfielder literally shat­tered Lou Brock's single-season stolen base record. As of yesterday, Henderson had pilfered 124 bases. And the A's still have 24 games left this season. 
The baseball media, of course, jumped on the Hen­
derson bandwagon. ("Bandwagon" seems to be too 
mild a term· "locomotive" might be better.) All summer 
long, I've h~ard the praises ofthis crafty, lighting-quick 
thief He's bet:n hailed as "the most disruptive force in 
the game." Some people are nominating him for 
American League Most Valuable Player. 
Henderson's achievements are indeed noteworthy. 
Even though he probably won't reach his goal of one 
stolen base per game, he has demonstrated great 
stamina and durability. 
But does his feat (feet?) really deserve all this atten­
tion? Should he be considered an MVP candidate? I 
don't think so. 
Going into yesterday's game, the A's were 20 games 
out of first place and 20 games below . 500. This fact 
raises two qut:stions. First, are Henderson's thefts a help 
or a hindrance to the A's? And second, would he have 
amassed these impressive numbers if Oakland was a 
contender? 
Along with breaking the record for most stolen bases, Henderson also has been caught stealing more times than any other player in history. I've watched at least two games in which Henderson ran the A's right out of rallies. I'm sure that Henderson has also caused many rallies, but it appears that he shouldn't always have the green light. 
Because his team has been out of the pennant race since the beginning of)une, Oakland manager Billy Mar­tin has allowed Henderson to literally run wild. It seems that Martin's first priority has been letting Rickey run, rather than letting the team win. 

A's centerfielder Dwayne Murphy, who hits behind Henderson in the Oakland lineup. recently complained about Henderson's favorite-son treatment. It seems that Murphy is tired of helping Henderson pile up stolen bases while the A's keep losing. I don't blame him. 
I'm sick of hearing about the Oakland/Los Angeles Raider fiasco. But I'm even more sick of Pete Rozelle. 
Don't worry -I'm not going to lecture about free enterp'rise and the fact that AI Davis should be able to take his team wherever he wants. The recent actions of Rozelle, however, deserve complaining. 
Because Rozelle was unable to convince the United States courts (he exhausted all methods of appeal) that the NFL should be exempt from anti-trust legislation, he's trying to bribe Congress into helping him. He's dan­gling pro franchises in front ofsalivating Congressmen. And his loyal owners (AI Davis would not be classified as a loyal owner) are making large campaign contribu­tions to some candidates. 
All this in the hope ofchanging the rules ofthe game. 
There's another aspect of this saga that disturbs me. While spending millions of league dollars (which ul­timately will be paid by the fans in the form ofincreased ticket prices) in legal costs, Rozelle is ignoring the cur­rent NFL labor dispute. 
The players have authorized a strike at any time, and are threatening a mid-season walkout. 
It seems that Mr. Rozelle has his priorities mixed up. But maybe a players' strike is part of Rozelle's plan to foil Davis. If there's a strike, the Raiders won't be playing in Los Angeles. Or Oakland. Or anywhere.
