In Brief 
The Institute for Pastoral and Social Ministry has become the first university affiliate of the Catholic Tele­communications Network Qf America CCTNA), according to a joint announcement by Archbishop Edmund Szoka of Detroit, chairman of CTNA and Father Robert Pelton, director of the Institute. The Institute was founded in 1976 by Father Theodore Hesburgh as "the channel through which the University offers its educational, academic and research resources, its faculty and facilities to serve the Church in today's society, in our country and beyond." ­

Loving relationships are difficult but worthwhile 
Relationships seem to be on the way out. Newspaper columnists, talk show hosts and sociologists all suggest that a loving relation­ship between a man and woman is nearly an impossibility. These supposed experts have blamed everything from female careerism to male wimpyness. Men are condemned for being insensitive while women are accused of being difficult to please. What is most disturbing is that people are lfuying this claptrap. Thirty year-old women are worrying about never get­ting married, and men are spending enormous sums of money on skin reconditioners and hair cream. Is this it? Is the very social fabric of our culture so rent with the strains of social change that normal, healthy relationships are becoming extinct? Are initimate relationships worth entering? 
Fortunately, yes. 

A sound, loving relationship is still possible today. In fact, with life becoming more un­predictible and competitive, relationships are especially in demand as harbors of refuge from the world. The world is capable of being quite cruel if you are alone. With the support and companionship of a partner life acquires meaning, and the sky adopts a particularly brighter shade of blue.

Bomb kills 11 at memorial service for Britian's war dead 
Associated Press 
ENNISKILLEN, Northern Ireland -A bomb killed 11 people and injured 61 Sunday at a Remembrance Day cere­mony for Britain's war dead in the worst Irish terrorist attack in five years. 
The huge explosion trans­formed the solemn pageant, which recalled the thousands of Northern Ireland's Protestants and Roman Catholics who perished for king and country in two world wars, into a horror scene of bloodshed and destruc­tion. 
No organization claimed re­sponsibility but the province's top police official said he had no doubt the outlawed Irish Re­publican Army had planted the bomb, and that it was specifi­cally aimed at civilians. 
Friends, relatives, soldiers and bandsmen dug with their bare hands through the rubble of a community center where the bomb was planted in this County Fermanagh town near the Irish border. 
In the frantic digging for sur­vivors, a soldier found the body of his mother. 
The blast blew out one end of the building and the structure collapsed, trapping men, wo­men and children against side­walk railings. 
Police said three married couples were among the six wo­men and five men killed, and that many of the wounded were seriously injured in the 10 :45 
a.m. explosion. 
A 14-year-old member of the Boy's Brigade said he was standing near the war memorial ready to lay a wreath when the bomb went off. 
"I dropped the wreath and rushed to where the wall had collapsed. People were screaming and we did all we could to pull them out. At 11 o'clock we should have been remembering the dead, not dig­ging them out," he said. 
The Rev. Michael Jackson, who had been waiting near the community center at the monu­ment for the ceremony to begin, said, "People started to scream and people started to run away -those who could ­but it was obvious that many would have been killed instant­ly." 

Chief Constable Sir John Her­mon said, "I am satisfied beyond doubt that this was the work of the IRA." 
The IRA views British secur­ity forces as its archenemies. 
However, the extent of civil­ian bloodshed brought expres­sions of regret from the local branch of Sinn Fein, the legal political wing of the outlawed IRA. 
Paul Corrigan, chairman of Fermanagh District Council, said in a statement that the party was shocked at the loss of life and added that Sinn Fein members "do not expect to es­
cape the consequences of this explosion -even if the IRA were not involved."

and he said he couldn't be ab­solutely sure but he would fol­low his conscious and he trusted that I would follow mine." 
"I'm not certain that policy is going to yield the good that he hopes that it will," he added. 
Williams commented that he has "wrestled with the ques­tion'' of how divestment would affect blacks in South Africa "for a long time." 
Williams said he didn't know how the Board would decide on the issue. 
"I'm not sure where the sentiment of the Board is," he said, "but I am quite confident that it will be discussed." 
In a Viewpoint column to The Observer, Peter Walshe, direc­tor of African Studies, wrote that he would be "surprised" if there were any change in the policy. 
More likely the Trustees, he noted, will issue a statement that the investment in South Africa is consistent with the commitment to social justice. 
The Board has repeatedly ig­nored calls from faculty and students to divest and have refused to act even after Sul­livan called for divestment, Walshe said. 
The Trustees are searching for excuses to "continue busi­ness as usual," Walshe said. One such argument is that di­vestment has been tried and failed. 
Walshe discounted this, noting that most of the firms that "withdrew" sold their holdings to South African cor­porations that were created to avoid disruption of the eco­nomy. 
The divestment movement, even without assistance from Notre Dame, has achieved suc­cess through damaging the in­vestment climate in South Africa. 
W alshe added that there are opportunities on campus to resist apartheid. 
The Notre Dame Anti­Apartheid Network is now working on a national lobbying effort for tighter legistlative sanctions against South Africa. 
Individual committees of the Board will meet on Thursday and the entire Board of Trus­tees is scheduled to meet on Friday.

Leaders to discuss mission of laity 
Special to the Observer 
Several Catholic lay leaders will discuss the Vatican's Synod on the Laity during a symposium entitled "Synod on the Laity: A Continuing Dialogue" Tuesday, Nov. 10 at 7 p.m. in the Hesburgh Library Auditorium. 
The symposium, sponsored by Notre Dame's Institute for Pastoral and Social Ministry (IPSM), will review the events preceding the Synod as well as its implications for the future of the Church. "We are anxious to explore the unfinished agenda and the laity's response following the Synod," said IPSM director Father Robert Pelton. 

"Lay people from around the world were consulted prior to the Synod. We want to assure that their voices will be heard in reflection following the Synod," Pelton added. 
A Synod is an international gathering of representative Catholic bishops advising the Pope on matters of importance for the whole Church. 
The theme of the Synod taking place this month in Rome is "The Vocation and Mission of the Laity in the Church and in the World 20 Years After the Second Vatical Council." 
Parent's exercise habits may harm kid's fitness 
Associated Press 

NEW YORK -Most parents 
of children aged 6 to 9 do not 
exercise with their youngsters 
and many fail to exercise at all, 
setting a poor example that 
might harm their children's 
long-term physical fitness, a 
new study suggests. 

The study found that parents 
of leaner children tended to be 
more active and exercise more 
with their children than did 
parents of fatter children. 

And it confirmed previous 
findings that children gener­
ally are fatter than in the past. 
"The message to parents is 
that they need to make this 
(exercise) more a priority in 
their lives, and they need to al­
low it to structure their behav­
ior with their children," said 
James Ross, project director for the National Children and Youth Fitness Study II. 
If parents show by example that exercise is important and make it part of a child's routine, it will "establish a pat­tern that will continue to guide the child on a lifelong basis," he said. 
Ross is director for school health of Macro Systems Inc., of Silver Spring, Md., which researches health and educa­tion issues. 
The study, financed by the 
U.S. Public Health Service, ap­pears in the November­December issue of the Journal of Physical Education, Recrea­tion and Dance. 
Researchers studied 4,678 youngsters in 19 states from a sampling that reflected the na­tion's 6-to 9-year-olds, and 4,435 of their parents. 
Report says helicopters vulnerable to radio waves 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON-Crashes of the Army's most modern troop-carrying helicopters have been caused by ordi­nary radio waves from mi­crowave towers, radio an­tennas and radar, a published report says, but a military spokesman Satur­day vehemently denied the report. 
Some army investigators believe that the radio waves have made five of the sophis­ticated UH-60 Black Hawk choppers nosedive to the ground since 1982, according to a Sunday report by Knight-Ridder newspapers. It cited Pentagon officials and documents. Twenty-two servicemen died in those crashes. 
The report quoted one senior Black Hawk pilot and investigator as saying that the Army has come out with "bizarre, superfluous and inane reasons"' for Black Hawk crashes that he believes were caused by the radio waves known as elec­tromagnetic interference, or EMI. 
Army spokesman Maj. Phil Soucy heatedly denied that the service made up any causes for crashes other than what was actually de­termined, and has spent mil­lions of dollars on continuing tests trying to learn if EMI does endanger the helicop­ters. 
"We have been study­ing... this phenomena. We have not been able to tie a single crash to EMI," despite tests in which chop­pers were bombarded with radio waves, Soucy said. 
Knight-Ridder said records show that Army tests after a 1986 Black Hawk crash found that 40 of the chopper's 42 systems were affected by high-level transmissions common around weapons radars and microwave towers. 
The article also cited 1987 tests in New Mexico that it said showed EMI could push the helicopter's rear-wing stabilator down, putting the helicopter into a dive.

'Cut the defense budget' 
Associated Press 

· WASHINGTON When 
Frank Carlucci takes over as 
secretary of defense, one of the 
first things he's likely to find 
on his Pentagon desk is a letter 
seeking his advice on the best 
way to cut the defense budget. 
It's a question Carlucci will 
be asked often as the Reagan 
presidency moves into its final 
14 months. 

The letter is being written by Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., and Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., who chair the Senate and House Armed Services Committees. 
Those two panels are meeting behind closed doors now, trying to work out a com­promise on a defense spending bill authorizing the Pentagon budget for the current fiscal year. 
The Senate panel is expected to take time out from that chore to hold hearings on Carlucci's nomination, but Nunn and other senators say the 30-year veteran of a variety of govern­ment jobs is expected to win Senate confirmation. 
Carlucci is replacing Caspar Weinberger, a never-tiring and successful advocate of ever­rising defense budgets. The bigger budgets were needed, Weinberger repeatedly said, to meet the relentless Soviet drive to outstrip Western defenses. 
During Weinberger's seven­
year tenure, the Reagan ad­
ministration laid the 
groundwork for large in­
creases in spending on person­
nel and a variety of weapons, 
and made downpayments on a 
number of new weapons that 
will force hard choices to be 
made in future years. 

The defense budget has 
doubled under Weinberger, but 
much of that increase was 
achieved in Weinberger's first 
term and Congress has granted 
only small raises -or voted ac­
tual cuts -in recent years. 

The two Armed Services committees are now working on a bill that will likely reduce military spending to $289 bil­lion, or less, in the current year, compared with Reagan's original request of $312 billion. 

Terrorists seize boat, hold 8 Israelis hostage 
Associated Press 

BEIRUT, Lebanon-The Abu Nidal terrorist group said Sun­day that its guerrillas seized a French-registered boat off the Israeli-occupied Gaza Strip and took the eight Israelis on board hostage. 
W alid Khaled, a senior lieutenant in the Palestinian group, told a news conference in Moslem west Beirut that the captives -three men, three wo­men and two children -were unharmed. 
But he said their "lives will be in danger" if Israel retaliated for the seizure. 
The Israelis have carried out 22 air raids against Palestinian camps in Lebanon so far this year, killing at least 105 people and wounding 250. 
Khaled said all eight captives are Israelis although some hold dual nationalities. He said five hold Belgian passports and one woman holds a French pas­sport. 
He said the 17-ton boat was flying the Israeli and Belgian flags but was registered in France. He declined to say when the vessel was captured. 
"We're waiting for a contact from the International Com­mittee of the Red Cross so that Red Cross representatives can see the hostages,'' Khaled told The Associated Press in an in­terview later at a hideout in Beirut's Mar Elias Palestinian refugee camp. 

"The captives have been transferred to one of our mili­tary bases where they are being interrogated after being given the necessary medical and humanitarian aid," he said, without elaboration. 
In Jerusalem, the Israeli army said it had no knowledge of the vessel's seizure. 
Iran: we fired two missiles into Baghdad 
Associated Press 

NICOSIA, Cyprus -Iran said it fired two surface-to-surface missiles into Baghdad Sunday .. Iraq reported that at least one missile exploded in a densely populated neighborhood, kil­ling a large number of civilians. 
The attack came as Arab leaders convened a summit in Amman, Jordan to seek a united stand behind Iraq in its 8-year-old war against Persian Iran. 
The missiles, fired less than an hour apart during the eve­ning, hit Iraq's state-run tele­vision and radio headquarters and the capital's central com­munications center, said Iran's

official Islamic Republic News Agency. 
Iraq's official news agency, also monitored in Nicosia, said at least one missile exploded in a heavily populated residential district, killing "a large num­ber of innocent civilians, in­cluding women and children." 
Iran fired five missiles into Baghdad last month, saying the attacks were in retaliation for Iraqi air raids against what it called "non-military tar­gets." 

Sunday's twin missile attack was launched a few hours after Iran said in a military com­munique that Iranian jets bombed an economic target in northeast Iraq and Iranian ar­tillery pounded Basra and other southern Iraqi cities. 
IRNA quoted a statement by Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps as warning that "more smashing blows will be in­flicted on Iraq's military, eco­nomic and industrial centers if the Baghdad regime con­tinues its mischievous acts."

Course offers unique insight on aging 
Editor's  Note:  The  following  is  the  
second in  a  monthly series from  the  
Center for Social Concerns.  

Whenever I think back to second se­mester, junior year, one thing sticks out: a course called Theology and Com­munity Service. Although I only spent four hours weekly at the nursing home and in class discussion, the influence that the two elderly people I visited had on me made a marked difference in my relationships with others and in my per­sonal inner reflection about aging. In essence, it was a twenty-four hour a day course.

Malloy supports drunk driving week 
Dear Notre Dame Students: 
I fully support the efforts of the Senior Class of Notre Dame to highlight the dangers of drunk driving. Alcohol and responsible use of a motor vehicle do not mix. All of us need to become more fully aware of the dangers involved since self-deception and rationalization of behavior are constant temptations. 
Please take this matter seriously. Not only your life, but that of other innocent parties may depend upon it. 
Rev. Edward A. Malloy President 
Gay lifestyle should not be condoned 
Dear Editor: 
I found Professor Storey's article on gay groups and "homophobia" inter­esting and quite commendable in its purpose to gain recognition for gays. Indeed he is content with his homosexuality -not only does he rec­ognize this phenomenon within himself, but he can also give it a concrete defi­nition. Unfortunately for Storey, the mere fact that he wrote this article defeats his very purpose; he wishes the Notre Dame community to allow homosexuals to be able to blend in naturally with the environment, yet, by

vice, theology, and learning. It is not an easy course. Its difficulty stems not from the paperwork, but from the abil­ity to be "present" to an elderly person (especially if he or she lives in dismal conditions). The difficulty is com­pounded when the student in a mini­sterial role, realizes that he or she can­not magically cure the elder's sickness, loneliness, or for that matter, even make the elderly person like him or her. One need not view these as nega­tive aspects, but opportunities in which to grow. The greatest gift the student­minister can leave the elderly person is a sense of hope. Often the student is doing this despite his or her feeling of failure. 
Each student visits the same two el­derly people for two hours weekly. I remember the first time I met with Bonnie. I had a hard time ignoring the fact that her face was lacking an eye. Through the course of the semester, I gradually became absorbed into her storytelling about her husband and I never noticed her physical appearance. 
Living in a dormitory, students take for granted friends who stop by. Often we were the sole visitors these people had. They planned their week around our arrival. The group with which I visited at Portage Manor eventually felt at ease and even thought of them­selves as members of the nursing home community. 
Class discussions, weekly speakers, small group interactions, a personal journal, and a structured case study compose the course which, incidental­ly, counts as a second theology. You have the chance to impart hope to el­derly persons and experience their gift of sharing life with you, and the occa-

virtue of his article, he sets them apart even more. Certainly his article evokes great sympathy for homosexuals, but at the same time it turns them into tragic figures, struggling with every breath, with every heartbeat, to go on living in this cruel world. --Well, it ain't easy for anyone. 
Ifsomeone chooses to be homosexual, and I use "choose" in the full meaning of the word, that is his own prerogative. Hooray! I am happy .for him and hope he has a wonderful life. The same goes for the one who decides to be hetero­sexual. Yippee! Now that the choice has been made, let it be and don't make an issue over it. I honestly do not lie awake at night thinking up new and in­novative "fag jokes" or plan mass raids on homosexual parties. It seems as though those who do the most think­ing about the homosexual "problem" on this campus are the homosexuals themselves. Perhaps they are trying to justify their own practices and to over­come their own "homophobia." 
But can they be justified? I say no. Any anatomy book will tell you that homosexuality is absolutely unnatural. Every part of the body has a specific purpose and if abused, the body revolts. Considering the practices of homosexuals, especially males, I am surprised that AIDS or something similar did not occur long ago. The body homosexuality AIDS and a plethora of other diseases. Call it God's revenge if you will, but any euphemisms you may apply will not change the fact that homosexual practices are a violation of human nature. And this is where the sin lies; it is not the feelings of love you may have for another of the same gender, but rather the active carrying out of those feelings. 
cannot  tolerate  such  abuse.  With  
smoking you risk lung  cancer,  with  
drinking  alcoholism,  and  with  

Therefore, homosexuals will never be recognized at Notre Dame. A Catholic institution such as this cannot con­sciously condone something which the Magisterium opposes; if it does, it can­not remain Catholic. And it should not have to condone it. There is no written law here at Notre Dame which says that homosexuality is illegal, but if there were to be a law saying that it is all right, Notre Dame would cease to remain Catholic. 
In the future then, not only do heterosexuals need to be sensitive to homosexuals but homosexuals also must be sensitive to heterosexuals.

sion to discuss vital life questions with your peers. These all enhance the value of the course. It is a time to think, as Pascal would say, about the one thing we know is sure, but we ignore the most: aging and death. 
Theology and Community, Service will be offered second semester. Registration material can be found in the Center for Social Concerns. I invite you to respond to what Henri Nouwen once described as "a call that goes right against the grain; that turns us com­pletely around and requires a total con­version of the heart and mind. It is indeed radical, one that goes to the root of our lives."

lowing such a thoughtless letter to be printed. 
Personally, I have disagreed with practically everything Father Griffin has written since I began reading his column. Nevertheless, it burns me up to see somebody attack the man for his beliefs. Father Griffin is not a "puritanical doppleganger," nor a "moralizing scrooge." He is a conser­vative. He writes what he does not because of "filial obeisance to the shade of his Yankee father," but be­cause he feels that what he has to say is important. And whether or not you agree with him, it is important. There are still a lot of people, nowadays, who go to college in order to learn. Certain­ly, the only way to learn is to be exposed to the ideas of others--of David Hume and James C. Maxwell, Jim Morrison and yes, Father Griffin. If you do noth­ing in college except stagnate in your own ideas, and put down other people for the ideas they hold, you might as well stay at home. 
If Miss Pettifer has something to say about homosexuality or condoms, she should put down her thesaurus and say it. It's easier to put down Father Grif­fin, however, because many of his views are unpopular. They make us question whether or not we really are good people. And that is a question you 
can't  answer just by making fun of  
someone.

Outlook on a shaky market: surviving a roaring bear 
By JOHN WHOLIHAN Business Writer "OK, so what do we do now Mr. Stockbroker?" 
The recent rollercoaster ride, known as the stock mar­ket, has enjoyed a slight com­eback since the Dow Jones In­dustrial Average lost 508 points 
on Oct. 19, 1987. 
Some analysts believe that this rebound is a technical re­action to the huge drop. They think that the recent gains are only temporary and that the Dow could still fall substantial­ly.

On the other hand, many believe that the Dow's decline has run its course and that the market will rise again in the midst of continued strong earn­ings reports by major corpora­tions. 
Before the bull market picks up steam, however, most agree that there will be an initial per­iod of volatility--lots of ups and downs, but no momentum in either direction. 
"So, why did it drop?," you wonder. 
This frequently asked ques­tion has more than one answer. The first of which relates to Wall Street believing that they need to see action taken on lowering the trade deficit. 
Realistically, it will take time before any positive action occurs. This may keep the Dow around the 1800-2100 level, but it should be pointed out that the increasing trade deficit did not stop the bull market in the mid­1980's. 
Before the drop, it was thought that a declining dollar may hurt the current economic situation. Now Wall Street believes a declining dollar could be helpful in reducing the trade deficit. 
Another factor in the mar­ket's explosive decline was 
Sen. Bentsen urges progress 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON-The chair­man of the Senate Finance Committee warned Saturday that unless the Reagan admin­istration and Congress speed up their budget negotiations, the government risks sending the wrong message to foreign markets and seriously damag­ing America's economic fu­ture. 
Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas said President Reagan should computer trading. 
Falling prices triggered brokers' computers to auto­matically put in orders to sell, further deflating stock prices. 
This created more sellers than buyers which is equated to a lack of demand. The lack of demand caused lower prices thus touching off more sell sig­nals. 
Computer trading, however, was not the cause of the Dow drop. 
The fear of a recession, in combination with the previ­ously mentioned growing trade deficit, is the prime reason why the market went into a free fall. 
Investor bearishness was also fueled by uncertainty about the future course of the economy. 
Perhaps the US is not looking at a full-scale recession, however, analysts suggest that an economic slowdown may hinder the market. 
"So what do we do now? " 
First, do not panic. 
Second, establish or rees­tablish one's investment objec­tives. 
Not all growth stocks pay dividends. Because these com­panies reinvest their earnings and have strong potential, however, the price of the stock rises. 
The question being raised now is whether or not now is the best time to invest. 
Due to the volatility of the market investing for the short­term is risky. 
The small investor has to think long-term. What is needed are stocks in "recession proof" industries. 
Nothing is immune to a recession. Yet, some indus­tries, such as utilities and food do well when the economy is ailing. 
During the month of October, the Dow Jones Average fell23.2 percent. 
The food industry, though, was off 17.2 percent, while electric companies lost only 3.5 percent. 
Let's imagine we have $5,500 to create a small, diversified 
heed the advice of this nation's close ally, British Prime Mini­ster Margaret Thatcher. 
"Mrs. Thatcher has stated that a convincing package to reduce the United States' budget deficit is a vital first step toward restoring confi­dence in the financial markets. Mrs. Thatcher is absolutely correct," Bentsen said. 
"If the negotiations between Congress and the president fail to produce major, honest, con­vincing progress toward deficit 
portfolio with established 
stocks from "recession proof" 
industries. 
The portfolio will be able to offer a decent rate of return despite the voltile market. 
A utility choice for this portfolio is Pacific Telesis. PacTel (NYSE $29) will pro­vide stability to the fund while paying $1.64 in dividends per share each year. 
The drug-health care indus­try was down about only 16 per­cent last month. Baxter Travenol is an emerging leader in this industry, capable of pro­viding 70 percent of a hospital's equipment needs. Baxter (NYSE $23) has created excel­lent long-term prosects with its acquisition of Caremark and its merger with the now profitable American Hosital Supply. 
Coca Cola is a well­diversified leader in the bever­age industry. The soft drink in­dustry was off 16 percent last month. Coke (NYSE $40) en­joys excellent name recogni­tion and pays a dividend of $1.12. 
The familiar Wrigley Gum is a solid addition to this portfolio. Wrigley (NYSE $54) has weat­hered the market storm by an­nouncing strong third quarter earnings. 
Limited funds will not permit a small investor to buy a round lot (100 shares) of each stock. 
Odd lot purchases cost 1AI of a dollar (12.5 cents) more per share. 
The $5,500 available allow us to make the following pur­chases. 
Baxter 50 shares $1150 
Coca Cola 25 shares $1000 
PacTel 50 shares $1450 
Wrigley 25 shares $1350 
Commissions amount to $160, bringing the total cost to $5110. The remaining cash is auto­matically deposited into a daily money market fund. 
The next segment of the se­ries will continue to track the stock market and discuss in­vestment ideas for the small in­vestor. We will also see how our portfolio has weathered the stormy seas of the market. 
reduction, America will ac­knowledge to the world that we lack the courage and the will to set our economic house in order," he said. 
The administration indicated Friday that it was softening its stance against defense spend­ing cuts. But it also appeared, following a White House meeting with Reagan and GOP congressional leaders, that the administration was holding firm in its refusal to rein in So­cial Security spending. 

Small St. vs Wall St. 
u The publishers of a monthly children's newspaper are under fire from the lawyers representing Dow Jones Inc. Dow Jones, which publishes THE WALL STREET JOURNAL, is asking the children's SMALL STREET JOURNAL to stop publishing. 
THE SMALL STREET JOURNAL began publications al­most two years ago. The presses were halted temporarily after the first two issues included a masthead similar to that of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL. After an unsuccessful trial with a new name, FAN DAY TIMES, THE SMALL STREET JOURNAL recently returned this summer. Dow Jones is currently debating its next plan of action.

Business Briefs 
u Rumors-Now that the Inland Steel venture is slowly taking shape, South Bend is abuzz with talk. The steel plant will be built in New Carlisle, a very small town within twenty minutes f\"om the south end of South Bend. Rumor has it that the Japanese executives are building 40 new houses in the new section of Knollwood, South Bend's answer to Gross Point. In addition, a $3.5 million house was being built by the owner of Burger King, and while still under construction, was sold to a big shot from Japan. 
The excitement in South Bend is apparent, but up to this point, the rumors are just that--rumors. But one would be foolish to downplay any opportunities that are bound to spring up, like opening up a Sushi restaurant. 
u Egos-Forbes Magazine, one of the most prestigious business magazines, and probably the dryest, occassionally offers a bit of insight on making it. Malcolm Forbes, on money: "A lot of money doesn't make anyone more often right. It just makes him harder to correct." And again, "Anot­her good thing to be said for money: It massages the ego when no one else can perceive any reason to." Many people think of the very wealthy owner and Editor-in-Chief of Forbes as an eccentric ego maniac. The lobby of the Forbes Building contains tributes to Malcolm Forbes, including scale models of the Forbes yachts. But if an over-bloated self importance is required to own a yacht with a helicopter pad and three rather large pleasure boats on board, these writers are will­ing to make the sacrifice. 
u The Last Word-Laurel Cutler, a marketing consultant on the buying habits of teenagers, feels teenagers think as follows, "I belong to a club called teenagehood, and I want to look like every other teenager--maybe a little hipper, maybe a little quicker to spot a new fashion, but for God's sake, not different."

The Notre Dame men's swim team finished in a dominating first place while the women's team tied for the first place po­sition in the Notre Dame Invi­tational Relays Friday. 
"This is a great opening meet for us," said Tim Welsh, Head Coach of both teams. Welsh is in his third year coaching for the Irish and said he is looking forward to a very strong season. 
He has good reason to be, as the Irish men took first place in 10 of 13 relays, and the Irish women in eight of 13. 
Competing against Notre Dame were schools such as Marquette, Valparaiso, Illinois-Chicago, Wayne State, North Central, Wabash, Butler, and Saint Mary's. 
The relays were definitely not umned to just a few parti­cipants. The attack was well-balanced and included every swimmer. 

"We were able to win the meetwithinthephilosophythat everyone swims," said Welsh, "Two years ago, we did not win either relays. Last year the wo­men won and the men came in second. This year we won the men's and tied the women's." 
The Irish men set record marks in the 400-yard Back­stroke, the 400-yard Butterfly, and the One-and Three-meter Diving competitions. 
The Irish women broke six records in their four-year-old Invitational, including the 200­yard Freestyle, 400-yard Med­ley, 400-yard Individual Medley, 400-yard Butterfly, 400-yard Freestyle, and the One-meter Diving events. 
"We are moving in the right direction," said Welsh.

The new meet will be called The Collegiate National Catho­lie Invitational Swimming and Diving Championships, and will consist of swimmers and divers from Catholic collegiate institutions throughout the na­tion.

"The first meet of a season is important because it is the first time the entire team com­petes under meet conditions," said Welsh.

When they fall behind, most teams look to the pass. So what did Lou Holtz tell his players to do to play catch-up? 
Run the ball. Of course. 
"The running game gave us the best chance to win," Holtz said. "How'd we do?" 
Green and the rest of the 
Irish running corps made Holtz 
look like a genius by piling up 
three touchdowns and 304 
yards on 66 carries. 
And, more important than those numbers, Notre Dame won the game. 
"We had to play catch-up," 
Brown said. "We didn't want 
to throw, so we ran it down 
their throats. We have so many 
plays in our option game. 
At one point in the fourth 
quarter, Green carried the ball 
eight consecutive times, the 
last being a two-yard touch­
down run. 
"That (running Green on 
eight consecutive plays) 
must've been a mistake,"

joked Holt~, who traditionally uses a variety of backfield players. "It should've been 10." 
Green's 152 yards this week and 102last week against Navy marked the first time an Irish back topped the century mark two games in a row since Allen Pinkett in 1985. 
"I like the number of carries I got today," Green said. "I'd like the ball at any time. 
"It was a matter of rhythm. I was getting five or six yards every time I touched the ball. We had a chemistry, and we wanted to keep moving the ball." 
Brown had praise for Green who, like Brown, came to Notre Dame as a flanker. 
"I asked him what he wanted to do," Brown said. "We wanted to show people that he's a great tailback." 
Much of the credit for the success of the running game goes to the Irish blockers. 
"I just had to get behind my guy," Green said. "Getting into the seam, follow the man, and get what I could. I can't say 
enough about the guys up front." "The offensive line does like to run the ball," said Holtz . 
Brown influenced the game with more than just his recep­tions, and the Boston College defense had more to worry about than stopping the Irish running game. 
"If they double-cover Tim­my, we look to the run," Holtz said. "We play our game and do the best we can." 
''Tim Brown does incredible things with and without the ball," Green said. "When he's out there, there's one less guy after me when I hit the cor­ner." 
Brown returned five kickoffs for 132 yards, with a long run of 36 yards. On each return, Brown appeared one step away from breaking through for a touchdown. 
"I did the things I had to do. I can't see everything at once,'' Brown said. "A guy gets a block, I make a turn, and I could go." 
Boston College was trying to keep the ball out of Brown's hands, but the kicks did not make it into the endzone. Brown's five kickoff return at­tempts also were a career high. 
"Tim Brown frightens you every time he touches the ball," said Eagles head coach Jack Bicknell. "We had to worry about the kid. We didn't know what the heck he could do." 
What can the Irish team do? With Tim Brown and Mark Green, an amazing return game and a rushing game that benefits from a passing game that benefits from the rushing game, the Irish can move the ball. 
And the grand totals are add­ing up to victories for the Irish.

The Irish soccer team has done its job -now it is up to the NCAA tournament selection committee to decide which teams from the Great Lakes Region will get invitations. 
Indiana, the top-ranked team in the country with an 18-2-0 record, will receive the region's first automatic bid. The second automatic bid and a possible at-large bid are still not determined, but Akron, Evansville and Notre Dame are the teams in contention. 
The news was good Saturday when the Irish learned that Ak­ron, last year's runner-up in the NCAA tournament, lost to Bos­ton University 1-0 at a tourna­ment in South Carolina. The Zips then faced William and Mary, a Top-20 ranked team, Sunday afternoon. The loss probably put Akron out of the automatic berth picture. 
Meanwhile Evansville won the Midwestern Collegiate Con­ference over the weekend, edging St. Louis 2-1 in the title game. The win should push On the minus side is the 
strength of the Irish schedule 
(only three games against Top 
20 teams, versus Indiana's 10 
and Evansville's 7), goal differ­
ential against weaker oppo­
nents (2-1 wins over Valparaiso 
and Ohio State), and recent 
performances (the Irish played 
stronger at the beginning of the 
year). 
It's just Notre Dame's luck 
that the three minuses are the 
three most important criteria 
in looking for tournament 
teams. 
If Notre Dame does not get 
the automatic bid, the 
prospects for one of the eight 
at-large bids do not look much 
better. The East Coast and 
West Coast regions are very 
strong this year, and it 
wouldn't be surprising if the 
Great Lakes Region does not 
recieve an at-large invitation. 
Still Notre Dame does have outside help. Many coaches across the country, such as UCLA's Sigi Schmid, have been impressed with this team which does not have any schol­arship players. Interestingly the biggest support comes from

Hartlieb's 7 TDs 



surpr1se everyone 
Associated Press 
lOWA CITY, Iowa -Iowa 
quarterback Chuck Hartlieb, 
who threw only eight passes 
last year and started just two 
of the first five games this 
season, suddenly finds himself 
in the Big Ten Conference 
record book. 
Hartlieb, a junior from Woodstock, Ill., set a Big Ten record by throwing seven touchdown passes in a 52-24 vic­tory at Northwestern Satur­day. He had five TD passes in the first half and his last scoring strike was a 95-yard play to Quinn Early that matched the longest pass play in conference history. 
In addition, Hartlieb set an Iowa record of 471 passing yards, completing 25 of 32 at­tempts before leaving the game with more than five minutes left in the third quar­ter. 
All this by a quarterback who at the beginning of the season wasn't even sure if he was going to be the starter. 
"That's one of the real surprises this year -Chuck Hartlieb's emergence at quar­terback," Iowa Coach Hayden Fry said Sunday. "It's got to be one of the most fascinating stories I've ever been associ­ated with in college football." 
The 95-yard catch helped Early set a Big Ten record of 256 yards on 10 receptions. He also tied the league mark with four touchdown receptions. 
"He was a track man when he came here and always heard footsteps," Fry said, using the phrase to describe a receiver being intimidated by an ap­proaching defensive back. 
"But he has worked hard and has developed into one of the big-play makers in college foot­ball." 
Hartlieb's other touchdown passes to Early covered 35, 9 and 44 yards. He also had scoring passes of 22 and 7 yards to Travis Watkins and 7 yards to David Hudson. 
The game was only 50 miles from Hartlieb's hometown, but no family members saw his record-breaking performance because there were so many other Hartliebs in action Satur­day.

would take flight for the first 
time in in four games. 
But as the Irish couldn't 
crack the end zone in the first 
half and Eagles quarterback 
Mike Power having a good day, 
changes, offensively and defen­
sively, were due at the half. 
After alternating at quarter­
back with Graham in the first 
half, sophomore Tony Rice as­
sumed total control in the 
second half. After an opening 
drive of 61 yards in seven play 
resulted in a 33-yard scoring 
bolt by Mark Green, The Irish 
had closed to 17-12. but Power 
hit Darren Flutie from 31-yards 
out. With a two-point conver­
sion the Eagles had their 13­
point lead. 
The Irish still hadn't gone to 
the running game exclusively, 
but when Rice tossed an inter­
ception at midfield, Holtz had 
seen enough of the airwaves. 
The Irish dodged the prover­
bial bullet when Eagle tailback 
Jim Bell fumbled at the Irish 
45. When the aftershocks of the momentum shift subsided (8.8 on the Richter scale), the Irish began to churn out the yardage. 
Not a pass was thrown from then on. A 55-yard, eight-play drive resulted in six. From then the Irish defense, which hadn't mounted much of a pass rush and had allowed some big runs, began asserting itself. 

"We didn't blitz very much in the first half, and (Power) had a lot of time to throw," Irish outside linbacker Flash Gordon said. "In the second half we started to blitz, and we were sending everyone be­cause we knew he couldn't throw if he was pressured. We were having better communi­cation during the second half between the guys up front and the secondary that enabled us to pick up the run and pass bet­ter." 
The Irish took over six plays and one yard later and chewed up 69 yards of turf to close the gap to tie the game at 25 on Braxston Banks's one-yard plunge. Four plays and minus four yards after the kickoff, the Irish went on their most im­pressive drive of the afternoon. Taking over at their own 48, the Irish went to Green nine times in 12 plays, including the last eight plays, and the junior carried the ball and his team­mates to victory. 
"Their patience was better than mine," Holtz said of his squad. "I don't think we really despaired. I don't think we really panicked. We just tried

Ifit hadn't worked out, you all would have been in here complaining about keeping it on the ground. We've got to do what gives us the best chance to win." 
As for Boston College coach Jack Bicknell, it was another frustrating loss for his 5-5 squad. 
"We didn't make things hap­pen on offense," Bicknell said. "I really thought we could move the ball on them, but we didn't. It was a very frustrating game from my standpoint." 
"When our defense could stay off the field, we were fine. But then we layed the ball on the ground. Then we fumbled the ball going in. Now our defense out too many se­quences in a row, and they just were hammering us. They're big up front, and their backs were running. They just ham­mered us."

NFL roundup 
Bears escape again, beat Pack 
Associated Press 
The Chicago Bears and Green Bay Packers have been playing football for 66 years, and the final seconds of Sun­day's game seemed just that long for the Bears' Kevin But­ler. 
His 52-yard field goal on the last play of the game gave Chicago a 26-24 victory over the host Packers and improved the Bears' NFL record to 7-1. Chicago has led the Central Division every week since the start of the 1984 season. 
"I don't know how long we can keep winning like this. I'm going to get gray hairs and I'm only 25, " Butler said after his kick capped the Bears' third straight comeback victory be­hind quarterback Jim McMahon . 
.. 
Chargers 16, Colts 13 

Vince Abbott kicked three second-half field goals, includ­ing a 39-yarder with 12 seconds remaining, and San Diego im­proved to 7-1 with its victory over Indianapolis at the Hoosier Dome. 
Dolphins 20, Bengals 14 
Dan Marino threw a 30-yard touchdown pass and Fuad Reveiz kicked two field goals as Miami beat slumping Cin­cinnati. 
Marino's scoring ,pass to Mark Clayton put the Dolphins, 4-4, ahead by 10 points in the third quarter, and Reveiz's 34­yard kick with 2:08 left sealed the Bengals' fourth consecu­tive loss. 
Lions 27, Cowboys 17 

James Griffins' fourth-quarter pass interception set up a 4-yard go-ahead touch­down run by Garry James as Detroit upset Dallas at the Sil­verdome.

not without a struggle and an­other comeback. Louisville ran away from the Irish after a 4-4 tie and took a lead of 14-9. A fired-up Zanette Bennett kept the Irish in this one, as the San Antonio native put down several big kills for side-outs to stop Cardinal rallies. Bennett was the only Notre Dame player in double digits in kills with 15, on 22 attempts. 
Facing game point, the Irish comeback effort resembled an avalanche, as the crowd of 498 sensed an overtime win. They sensed right. Kills by Wagner and junior Maureen Shea, com­bined with Louisville carries, knotted the score at 14. The snowball effect continued and Bennett hit home the final point for a 16-14 win. 
"Over the last two or three weeks," said Lambert, "Ben­nett has really improved her defense. She is a great offen­sive player, but defense is what will make her a great player. She's quick enough to be a great defensive player." 
The Irish have a week of practice to ready themselves for Valparaiso and Michigan State, who will visit the Joyce ACC Friday and Saturday nights, respectively. The regu­lar season will conclude with an away match at Western Mic­
i higan next Tuesday. Winning

Randall Cunningham's 40­yard touchdown completion to Gregg Garrity with 1:06 remaining rallied host Philadelphia over Washington.

Neil Lomax threw a 17-yard touchdown pass to J.T. smith with 2:01 remaining, climaxing a 28-point, fourth-quarter rally against Tampa Bay before only 22,449 at Busch Stadium. 
It was the greatest fourth­quarter comeback in NFL his­tory, according to league records, and the point total tied a team record for fourth­quarter scoring.

Irish storm back to 

...-----­
Running game averts BC upset 
By DENNIS CORRIGAN Sports Editor 
Conventional football wisdom says that when trailing 25-12 midway through the third quarter, you need to throw the ball to get back in the game. But then, no one ever accused Notre Dame head coach Lou Holtz of being conventional. 
When the chips were down for his

squad, Holtz turned to his veteran of­fensive line and his running attack. The back-to-basics philosophy resulted in 20-unanswered points and a 32-25 vic­tory over visiting Boston College. 
"I felt it gave us the best chance to win," Holtz said afterward. "We tried throwing the ball earlier, but we had couple of interceptions, we get a sack, we get a penalty. That's not our thing." 
The Irish had shown a different look in the first half, opening with freshman Kent Graham at quarterback. On Notre Dame's first offensive play, Graham hit Tim Brown for 58 yards. With Graham, known for his throwing abil­ity, at the helm, it looked like the Irish

They played like a team with something to prove. And they proved it. 
The Notre Dame volleyball team swept past Louisville, 15­13, 15-5, 16-14 Saturday night at the Joyce ACC. As the scores indicate, the three-game sweep was not an easy task. The Irish battled back from considerable deficits in games one and three to pull out the victory. 
"I was delighted to see us come back in those games,"

said Notre Dame head coach Art Lambert. "We rose to the occasion, and did what we are supposed to do for once." 
What the Irish were supposed to do going after last year's 33-7 record was to make the NCAA Tournament for the first time in the program's history. While key losses to Top 20 teams keep that goal questionable, in Sat-

ND soccer team beats MU, osu to keep playoff hopes alive 
By PETE GEGEN Sports Writer 
With a possible invitation to the NCAA Tournament at stake, the Irish soccer team beat Marquette and Ohio State to keep its tournament hopes alive. 
Fininshing the regular season with a 17-3-1 record, the Irish must now sit and wait for the announcement Monday morning of the 24 teams who will comprise the tournament. 
The Irish needed two vic­tories this weekend to assure a chance for a bid, and two vic­tories they received, beating the Warriors Friday night 3-1 and beating the Buckeyes Sun­day 2-1. 
Notre Dame had the upper hand against Ohio State, but lackluster play at times cost the team a more convincing victory in the final score. 
Danny Stebbins got the Irish on the scoreboard at the 35:28 mark on a disputed goal. Steb­bins went up with Buckeye keeper Norm Dellosso on a cross, and when Dellosso couldn't hold on to the ball, Stebbins knocked it home. The Ohio State bench argued that Stebbins fouled the keeper, but none was called and the goal stood. 
There was no questioning Notre Dame's second goal at the 60:40 mark when midfielder John Guignon headed home a Dave Augustyn throw-in cross. Sandwiched by two defenders, Guignon suprised the keeper with a sharp header to the short side.

Not only did the Irish want to win by a few goals, but they also wanted a shut out to report to the selection committee. For the first 89 minutes they held the Buckeyes scoreless. But with 18 seconds left on the clock Ohio State's Dean Jack hit a direct kick around the wall and inside the left post for a goal. 
"That was very frustrating," said Irish head coach Dennis Grace. "We needed a win and we needed to play shutout ball as well as win. We're a much the Irish improved their record to 23-8. 
In the opener, Louisville jumped out to a 9-3 lead by fin­ding holes in the Notre Dame backcourt and capitalizing on Irish hitting mistakes, several coming off misplaced sets. Junior Zanette Bennett started the Notre Dame comeback with a kill deep into Cardinal territory, then finished off the 
stronger team than Ohio State, but the tournament committee doesn't know that." 
Grace was also referring to last Wednesday night's 2-1 win over Valparaiso, another team which the Irish failed to put away. 

But the team did respond to the challenge Friday night against Marquette, keeping the ball in the Warriors' end most of the game. Less than four minutes into the contest midfielder Joe Sternberg started the scoring when he took a chip pass from wingback Steve Lowney and and beat keeper David Wulff. 
Marquette's Scott Steinbauer tied the game 16 minutes later on an unassisted goal, but for­ward Randy Morris put the Irish ahead whfD he split the Marquette defense on a run, took a feed from wingback Dave Augustyn and found the back of the net. 
Forward Bruce "Tiger" McCourt finished the scoring when he headed home a cross by Lowney with 10 minutes remaining.
