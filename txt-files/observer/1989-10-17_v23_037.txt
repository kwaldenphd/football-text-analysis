WORLD BRIEFS 
At least 100,000 pro-democracy demonstrators marched peacefully through downtown Leipzig on Monday night, the largest protest in communist East Germany's 40-year history. For the first time, state-run East German media promptly re­ported such a protest, saying that "tens of thousands of citizens" had joined the march. Pro-democracy activists said there were no incidents during the march. More than 70,000 protesters marched in Leipzig on Oct. 9, following a month in which thousands of East Germans fled West seeking freedom. 
The Kremlin regrets the past use of psychiatry as a polictical weapon, said a Soviet official Monday. The comment by Peter Morozov, the secretary of international relations for the state-sanctioned All-Union Society of Soviet Psychiatrists, was a depature from the Kremlin view that has only hinted at possible, isolated cases of abuse in the Soviet Union. "It's clear that we regret our past, not only (political) abuses but the whole system," Morozov said in an interview. 
Marina Ogilvy of London is two months pregnant and refuses to marry the father until the child is born. She says her parents are demanding they marry now or have an abortion. It is a sad and commonplace tale of modern morality, but it is also an uncommonly public royal scandal: Miss Ogilvy is 24th in line to the throne, her mother being the first cousin of Queen Elizabeth II. The royal family recently suffered the breakup of the marriage of Princess Anne, the queen's daughter.

Put up your 'Dukes' against poll of college knowledge 
As most people noticed last week while 

reading the paper, the National Endowment for 
the Humanities released the results of a Gallup 
Poll that tested college students on history and 
literature. Like every other poll of its kind, this 
poll concluded that we college students are a 
pack of mindless slugs who know nothing. 
As a result, every newspaper columnist, every 

professor and every politician has come out and 
said how TERRIBLE it is that the nation's youth 
apparently have learned as much in school as 
their elders have, judging by the fact that every 
poll has concluded that nobody really knows 
anything. 
Far be it from me to speak out and defend myself and my fellow scholars in the face of these terrible accusations, even though it is a perfectly honest mistake to answer that Shakespeare was a janitor in the House of Commons instead of a famous songwriter or whatever he was. 
The fact of the matter is that these polls are 100 percent correct: WE REALLY DON'T KNOW ANYTHING! This should be of great comfort to our parents, who, as we speak, are toiling away in sweat shops and the stockyards to pay our $15,000 dollar tuition and our bar tabs. It would shock them to know what the University has been covering up for years: We don't even have classes here! 
That's right, Mom and Dad, while you thought I was studying calculus and Spanish, I was running around the dorm after parietals wearing women's underwear and singing the theme from "Maude." My fellow students have been doing things like eating raw eggs and drinking cheap beer, running around campus dressed like their favorite woodland animals, building scale-model Golden Domes out of used Kleenex, and writing for "Common Sense." 
You are probably asking just what this has to do with anything, and I'm not really sure myself. But I do know that this recent Gallup poll could not possibly judge our true knowledge of the real world by asking questions about the Battle of Hastings (which, for those ignorant ones out there, is the name given to the glorious and triumphant rescue of three American medical students held hostage on the island of Grenada). If it were a true barometer of our knowledge of the world, the test would ask about the one thing we actually learned about in grammar school: "The Dukes of Hazzard." 
A true classic of American culture, "The Dukes of Hazzard" caused this author to first develop his now evident case of Dorkitis by staying in on Friday nights to watch the exploits of the Duke family. While the other seventh­graders in my neighborhood were going out and experiencing puberty, I stayed and worshiped Bo and Luke. Since coming to Notre Dame, however, I have met many closet "Dukes" fans. 
So, to prove that Notre Dame is indeed the Harvard of the Midwest, I have made my own humanities poll. Answer as many questions as possible without looking at the answers. 
1. Who sang the theme song to "The Dukes"? 

C'mon, that's a gimme-Waylon Jennings. Anyone who can stop me on the quad and sing

2. Who was the greatest of all of the Dukes? 
Anyone who answers something other than Daisy Duke automatically fails. Daisy was, in the eyes of every sixth-grade boy, the perfect woman. She. was innocent, respectful, a good waitress, and looked great in tight clothes and high heels. If you answered Crazy Cooter, I'll give you credit, just because he was a source of pride to Good 01' Boys everywhere. 
3. What was the name of the Duke boys' car? 
The General Lee. I used of dream of when I would turn 16 so I could by a 1969 Dodge Charger and then paint a Confederate flag on top, weld the doors shut, and then proceed to jump over police cars at 70 mph. 
4. Name the Duke boys' weapon of choice. 
Remember, because of their probation, Bo and Luke couldn't carry guns. The only logical alternative was a compound bow and arrows with dynamite taped to them. That's one rugged weapon. 
5. At the beginning of one episode, Bo and Luke are driving around singing what rock and roll classic? 
It was "Take it Easy" by the Eagles. Shame on you for not knowing that, you heathen. 
6. What was the name of the group in which Boss Hogg and Uncle Jesse first met? 
"The Rigderunners" was the name of the group of men who transported moonshine throughout Hazzard County. Uncle Jesse and Boss Hogg were Ridgerunners before becoming enemies. 
7. 
Who was the annoying nephew of Boss Hogg who frequently made guest appearances on the show? 

Huey Hogg. That was another gimme. 

8. 
What was the lame excuse provided by the producers of the show to jusify taking up five minutes of every show with a performance by some famous country and western singer? 


Sheriff Roscoe P. Coletrain would just happen to stop the singer for a traffic violation, forcing him to work otT the ticket with a performance. 
9. Who was the deputy who was so well-liked 
that he had his own spin-otT? Another easy one-Enos. 
10. To what large city did the Dukes frequently travel in an attempt to overrule Boss Hogg? 
Atlanta. Anyone who missed that one might as well pack it up.

Bush signs mandatory Gramm-Rudman cuts 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -President Bush signed an order Monday night cutting federal programs by $16.1 billion after giving up hopes for a last-minute com­promise with Congress. 
"It's the law. We're ready to implement it," said White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater. He said that, while the administration had sought to avoid the almost across-the­board cuts triggered by the na­tion's Gramm-Rudman budget­cutting law, "it might even be 
good"  if the budget  ax  does  
fall.  
The  order  Bush  signed  

shortly before 7 p.m., to take effect at midnight, was largely procedural as the spending cuts were automatic under the law. 
"We'll continue to work with the Congress" in seeking to de­velop a compromise to reduce the deficit to roll back the spending cuts, Fitzwater said. "But there is some feeling here that (the automatic cuts) are the way to go. It will reduce spending in a very effective fashion." 
"Everyone's going to have to take in their belts," he added."It will have a hit, there's no doubt about it." 
Earlier, budget director Richard Darman said "we are doing what the law requires." 
The cutbacks are required under the Gramm-Rudman law because of the failure of Congress and the White House to agree on a deficit-reduction package. 
The only hope for averting the cuts had been for the House and Senate to agree to a com­promise budget-cutting bill and send it to Bush for his signa­ture by midnight. 
Such quick work was made virtually impossible by the situ­ation on Capitol Hill. The House version of the measure was studded with dozens of contro­versial provisions -ranging from Bush's cherished capital gains tax cut to an expansion of child care services -and many lawmakers were out of town. 
Fitzwater said Bush's order would appear in Tuesday's Federal Register specifying the across-the-board cuts in most federal programs.

Shuttle to launch despite protest 
Associated Press 
CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. ­The space shuttle Atlantis, freed from technical and legal barriers, was declared ready Monday for today's launch with its nuclear-powered cargo. NASA said it expects neither weather nor demonstrators to interfere. 
"The vehicle is in good shape, the crew is ready to go fly and the weather looks like we'll have a good chance to get air­borne," NASA administrator Richard H. Truly said Monday. "It's been a long haul for this mission." 
The launch from the seaside pad at the Kennedy Space Cen­ter is scheduled for 12:57 p.m. EDT. 
Environmental activists, con­cerned that an accident could spread nuclear poison into the atmosphere, demonstrated at a gate leading to the Kennedy Space Center headquarters, and eight were arrested. 
"This is just only the begin­ning of the government's plan to use nuclear power and weapons in space, including in the Star Wars program," said Jane Brown of the Florida Coalition for Peace and Justice. 
The coalition is one of three groups that lost a suit to stop the launch in U.S. District Court last week. A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Ap­peals in Washington upheld the 

All times EDT AP 
judge Monday, saying his ruling was not appealable. 
The protesters vowed to infil­trate a 30-by-10-mile security zone and stop the launch. NASA had 200 armed security guards in the area and there were sea and airborne patrols. 
The space center security chief said perhaps the best pro­tection is the natural barrier surrounding the launch pad. 
"We have about 7,000 alliga­tors there, I don't know how many rattlesnakes, a lot of wild hogs, and probably millions of mosquitoes," Gary Wistrand said. 
Galileo, weighing 6,700 pounds, will be released from Atlantis's cargo bay 6 1/2 hours after the ship is in orbit, the start of a six-year, 2.4 bil­lion-mile journey to Jupiter, the largest planet in the solar sys­tem. 
Electricity to run the space probe will come from two nu­clear power packs, each loaded with 24.7 pounds of plutonium­
238. NASA has used such ra­dioactive fuel on 22 previous flights. Three have been in­volved in accidents, but no plu­tonium was released. 
The space agency said in court last week that detailed studies show the chances of re­lease of radioactive material are statistically low and that the environmentalists' fears are unwarranted. 
A large team of experts will be scattered around the center with detection devices to sample the air in case there is an accident as the shuttle lifts off. The Department of Energy will have an airplane aloft and an­other 150 people standing by, said agency spokesman Chris West. 
The mission was originally planned to begin in 1982, but was delayed, first by money troubles and then by the explo­sion of the space shuttle Chal­lenger. The cost of the project to date is $1.5 billion, NASA said.

MY NOTRE DAME EN C 0 U NTE R 
The Notre Dame Encounter Retreat Program begin.s with a three-day retreat experience designed to help participants deeply explore the meaning of their relationship with Cod and their commitment to Christian life. Each NDE weekend is directed by a team of students, faculty and staff who work together to prt>duce an exciting, chal.Jenging and reflective time away from the day­to-day problems and distractions. The following reflection was written by Amy Weber, a senior whc participated in the most recent NDE retreat experience. 
"What am I doing here? And how can 1 get out of It gracefully?" Those were my only thoughts as I walked through the back-door of Badin Hall Into the Campus Ministry office on Friday afternoon. I had signed up to go on a Notre Dame Encounter while all of my friends were signing into their hotel rooms in Ann Arbor. The Irish were to be playing Michigan and I was to be praying with 40 people I had not yet met. 
As we walked around the lake to what would be our weekend home, we sang what I considered to be a pretty silly song. l thought: "'f 1 can hide behind this bush for a while, no one'll miss me and I can run back to campus when the group passes by." But then a girl introduced herself. She knew my name. I coufdn't hide. 
We got to the Fatima retreat house and checked in. My assigned roommate must have gotten away with the bush option -she never showed. The weekend began. 
In small groups, we began talking about why we were here. The groups leaders were persistent. l wouldn't get away with just saying: "1 couldn't afford Ann Arbor." So I told the corny truth: Everyone I ever talked with about NDE tofd me how wonderful they were and how everyone should malce one. You know the statndard line: 'Oh, you have just got to go on one.' So I signed up," I said cheerfully. 


But I was really a little scared. I feared a weekend of prayer. My brother had warned me: "All your buddies will be In Michigan for the game, and you'll spend three days praying?" but I did want to see what it was all about. I decided 1 would just quietly take things in. This was my time away, and I would relax. 
Wrong. Soon, 1 found myself so interested in the people 1 was and the lectures 1 was that I 
just had to participate. 1 wanted to get involved. 
The atmosphere was contaltious. an.d I WaJ\ted to 
be part of lt. 
The talks were given by other students who had 
already made the retreat and were now members 
of the team -they were REAL. They made me 
think. They made me wonder. 
My father had told me that If the retreat was a good one, It would not give me many answers but it would ask me a Jot ofquestions. It was a good one. I had plenty of questions. So did everyone else, I found, as I kept going back to my ama,l.l group after each talk and dfscuaa things and ask even ~re question. 
Too, there was dme for me to go off by myself and ask still more questions ancf try to hear the answers. I sat by the lake and it lelt like the campus was millions of miles away, Instead of just beyond the trees. I could think of my own life and of my own life with others. 
Butenou~hthUUdngiTherewasalotoffun.The 
evening activities were broken up with fun group activities that gave me a chance to see the various sides of my new friends, and for them to see various sides of me. Without being distracted by externals, It's really possible to get to know others in a short period of time. And to care, and become memories of a wonderful weekend and,. I hoped, 
a few answers to the many questions raised over 
the past days. 
When I got back to campus, I called my brother, to Jet him know what had happened during my 55 hours away. 1 hadn't spent three days praying. Well, we did go to mass a few times, and had a penance service and many group prayer services. And those times were very special. But on top of that I had spent a Jot of time thinking. questioning and finding answers to many questions I had never raised before. 
And I had made some new friends; people I hadn't known on Friday afternoon now knew me in ways few others did, and I them. I see some of them when 1 walk across the campus, in the dining hall and In some classes. And next week we're getting together for dinner. 
It won't be the same as huddling in the small circle to pray or talk like we did at Fatima...lt never could be the same. The time I spent with those people was Incredible; something I will keep In my heart forever. 
When I introduce my new friends to my buddies who travelled to Michigan for the weekend, I can't help but laugh. Inevitably, the same corny words come out of my mouth: "Oh, you have just got to go on one."

Honor Code serves University in name only 
By Jason Carroll 

During the week of orienta­tion this year, all freshmen were required to watch an "educational" video. This video was full of many caring people who described a pleasant, non­threatening code of honor. Ev­ery student was given a fancy pamphlet, printed in blue and gold, so that no true Domer could object. For the very few students who still might not have been utterly enthralled by this new gift to our precious moral education, two endorse­ments removed any remaining doubts. This presentation of the Honor Code was, at best, in­complete. Some might even say new students were deliberately misled. 
Last spring, I was asked to appear in the Honor Code video and give my thoughts on the subject. I was somewhat sur­prised at this invitation, be­cause I had been an open dis­
senter. I was told that the video would present both sides of the issue. But sometime between my interview and the final edit­ing, the administration must have vetoed that novel idea of giving equal time to the opposi­tion. My 15-minute interview was sliced to a few seconds of a watered-down objection. The video, containing only one view, could not be called education, but rather, propaganda. 
One must ask, "What was the motivation behind the decision to leave out half of the facts?" The most convincing arguments arc made stronger by offering an opponent's objections, and then refuting all protests. In this way, questions can be an­
swered, and doubts can be re­moved. So why did the administration 
I not present criticisms? Maybe
I they were intentionally decep­
I I tive. They would rather have an

ignorant group of followers 
than an informed group of 
protestors. Or maybe they real­ized just how powerful the ob­jections are. They couldn't come up with a solid rebuttal, so they avoided the complaints completely. Possibly, they didn't want to show any evidence of the enormous divide between the administration and the stu­dents. But the exact reason for withholding information does not really matter. The point 
here is that the students are worse off by not knowing both sides, and the administration, not so coincidentally, is better ofT for not telling both sides. 
In spite of the administra­tion's intentions, one scene in the Honor Code video was acci­dentally informative. This scene is a dramatization of a student who witnesses another student cheating on a test. He is faced with the dilemma of whether or not to report this fellow stu­dent. The audience can hear the thoughts of the witness as he deliberates. The witness' thoughts, unedited, would be a successful skit in the Keenan Revue. Everyone watching the video was laughing at this idiot who was going to "help" his fellow student by turning him in. This scene is a clear indica­tion of the administration's un­fortunate failure to gauge stu­dent opinion. The people who put this scene in the video are living in fantasyland. 
In the back of the Code of Honor Handbook, two en­dorsements are presented. The first of these is written by Pro­fessor Gary M. Kern, an assis­tant professor in the College of Business. He suggested that the teacher should not be required to "use various methods to dis­suade students from cheating," because "the teacher's imposi­tion of these tactics may appear to reduce the level of trust as­sumed to exist between the teacher and the students." His statement obviously implies that reporting a student de­stroys trust. He apparently be­lieves that the accused could only feel resentment toward his accuser. 

His most shocking view is that this undeniable burden should be forced upon the stu­dents. He clearly does not want to deal with the problem him­self. Evidently, he would much rather have the trust between the students be "reduced." But Professor Kern should at least be credited for his honesty. He does show how the Honor Code can destroy the trust between the students, and therefore weaken the Notre Dame family, while the administration is merely spewing rhetoric about cheaters who will graciously thank the "narcs" for their moral conviction. 
The second endorsement was a well-written, convincing arti­cle, which was in support of some other honor code. Jeremy Lane wrote about honor codes in the professional world, specifically about the Code of Professional Responsibility, which binds him as a lawyer. He wrote that he has reported three people in his career, each incident involving "serious vio­lation." On many other occa­sions, he has simply " discussed the situation with the (offender) ... so that there would be no repetition." He would, therefore, be in direct violation of the Code of Honor here at Notre Dame. 
We have the all-encompassing clause called the "non-tolerance policy." If one student suggests the use of a synonym on his friend's paper, and the paper is turned in without a footnote, any witness is obligated to re­port them both for plagiarism. This is not an exaggeration. The word was clearly not the author's idea, but he claimed it as his own work. Therefore, the author definitely plagiarized. The witness is absolutely obli­gated to report the offense, ei­ther to the· instructor for guid­ance or to a member of the Honesty Committee; silence is not a legal option. The Honor Code does not allow for even the most minor offense to be overlooked. There can be no in­terpretation. There is only black and white. That is why virtually everyone at this Uni­versity has broken the Honor Code. 
Simply stated, the Honor Code, as it is now, is not a good thing for the students of this University. If both pro and eon arguments were presented side by side, a vast majority of the students would come to the same conclusion. In fact, many students disagree with the poli­cies of the Honor Code after having heard only the adminis­tration's view. 

The reason for implementing the Honor Code, though, is simple. The administration's first priority is not the stu­dents, but the University itself. This school will last long past any one students' matricula­tion, and therefore, the admin­istration's concern must lie with the school, not the stu­dents who just happen to be here now. The Honor Code en­hances the image of the Univer­sity. so it's effect on the stu­dents is almost inconsequential. 
As the image of the University changes, the students who will be attracted to the school will also change. As time passes, the student body will evolve from the trusting group it is today, to a group of people who are very willing to stab their friends in the back. I am sure that is exactly what the admin­istration wants. This Honor Code will serve them well. 
I would normally expect a re­sponse to such harsh accusa­tions, but I am sure that the administration is not listening.

Big Audio Dynamite 
New album, Megatop Phoenix, disappointment to fans 
JOHN LANE 
accent writer 
Megatop Phoenix is the new album from Big Audio Dynamite. Although it contains a few good songs, overall, Megatop Phoenix is a weak al­bum. 
B.A.D. is led by Mick Jones, who played guitar and wrote some of the songs for The Clash, a band that grew out of the post-punk movement in England in the late 70s. When Jones left The Clash in the mid­80s, he decided to form B.A.D. with the intention of combining his rock roots with elements of funk. In a move similar to what Paul Weller did when he left The Jam to form the eclectic Style Council, Jones wanted more diversity in his music. 
B.A.D. has moved fast, putting out four albums in five years. However, Megatop Phoenix is the band's worst album so far. 
The quality of music in Megatop Phoenix Drops drasti­cally from previous B.A.D. al­bums. There is too much com­puter-generated music and syn­thesizers and not enough gui­tars, like in the songs "Rewind" and "James Brown." The result is a sort of neo-disco sound that betrays Jones' harder­edged past. 
Another problem with Megatop Phoenix is the use, or overuse, of additional content brought in from outside sources. B.A.D. uses lines from old movies or television in the middle of many of their songs, apparently to complement thtl lyrics. They did this often on their first two albums and sparingly on their last one. But this tactic is in full force on Megatop Phoenix. For instance, the track "Mick's a Hippie Burning" is simply a compila­tion of short scenes from vari­ous old movies with a little mu­sic tossed in. This disrupts the continuity of the album and will most likely annoy the listener. 
Megatop Phoenix does con­tain some good tracks, how­ever. "Contact" is a classic 
B.A.D. song, featuring an up­tempo beat and strong vocals by Jones. In "London Bridge," Jones sings about his love for London despite its economic 

decline. Other highlights include "Around the Girl m ~0 Ways" and "Union Jack," which fea­tures good guitars and drums. 
Despite these songs, though, Megatop Phoenix remains a be­low-par album. Longtime fans might want to purchase this al­bum, but anyone hoping to ac­quaint themselves with B.A.D. would do well to buy one of their earlier albums, such as This is Big Audio Dynamite or No. 10 Upping Street, rather than Megatop Phoenix.

Late drive keys Bills' upset of Rams 
Associated Press 
OHCHARD PARK, N.Y­Frank Heich threw an 8-yard touchdown pass to Andre Reed with 16 seconds left Monday night to cap a wild final three minutes that gave the Buffalo Bills a 23-20 victory over the Los Angeles Rams, knocking off the NFL's last unbeaten team. 
Reich, who was making his first NFL start and had thrown just 20 passes in four seasons before Pro Bowler Jim Kelly separated his left shoulder last week, had thrown a 1-yard TO pass to Thurman Thomas to put Buffalo ahead 16-13 with 
2:23 left. 
But Thomas fumbled as Buf­falo was trying to run out the clock and Jim Everett's 78-yard touchdown pass to Willie An­derson on the next play seemed to clinch the victory for the Hams with 1:23 to play. 
Reich, however, drove Buffalo 64 yards in seven plays, all in the air, and capped it with the pass to Reed who was hit as he caught the ball at the goal line. 
The win put Buffalo at 4-2, one game ahead of Indianapolis and Miami in the AFC East, The Rams (5-1) fell into a tie with San Francisco for first in the NFC West. 
The touchdown pass to Thomas came at the end of an 87 -yard, 1 0-play drive that was Buffalo's only sustained offen­sive movement of the game. 
Thomas fumbled on the Rams 22-yard line and Michael Stew­art recovered for Los Angeles. 
Everett then hit Anderson streaking down the middle be­hind Mark Kelso, who could only grab at his jersey briefly before he got loose for the win­ning score. 
Reich, who had no completion longer than 13 yards in the first 51 minutes, finished with 21 completions in 37 attempts for 214 yards and Thomas had 24 carries for 105 yards. 
Everett, harried for most of the game and sacked twice by Bruce Smith, was 15-for-36 for 219 yards. 
The blockbuster ending over­shadowed a dull 3 1/2 quarters as Buffalo, with Kelly out, played exceedingly conserva­tive. 
The Rams took a 7-0 fi.rst­quarter lead on a 2-yard touchdown pass from Everett to Buford McGee following Heggie Sutton's fumble of a punt at the Bills' 16. Ironically, Buffalo picked up Sutton just two weeks ago after the Rams released him. 
Scott Norwood's 38-and 47­yard field goals cut it to 7-6 at halftime. Then Mike Lansford hit a 34-yarder to make it 10-6; Norwood's 40-yarder cut it to 10-9; and Lansford hit from 36 to make it 13-9 early in the fourth quarter.

headed into the general direc­
tion of the train station. It was 
as if the entire city had been 
called into battle. 
Curious, I followed at a dis­
tance, filing past the station 
along a tree-lined path to a 
place I didn't even know ex­
isted-El Campo de Mendizor­
roza. 
From the outside, the open­
air stadium resembled a small­
town high school football sta­
dium. Most of the fans owned 
season passes. Our 600 pesetas 
landed us in the polideportive y 
general section, where we stood 
on what looked like the ruins of 
an ancient Mayan temple. 
The male-dominated crowd 
was comprised of cigar-smok­
ing, pistachio-crunching, wine­
swilling soccer enthusiasts 
whose sense of civic duty 
seemed to consist entirely of 
whistling louder than the guy 
sitting next to them. The chil­
dren, meanwhile, sat down in 
front behind a metal fence 
which they shook vigorously as 
an American fan might assault 
the plexiglass surrounding a 
hockey rink. 

For my part, I wasn't even sure who to cheer for at first. Both teams seemed to have an equal number of supporters, so it was difficult to discern a home team. 
The first score of the after­noon quickly changed all that. After a tripping penalty was called inside Sodupe's 18-yard line, Alaves was awarded a penalty kick which it converted for a 1-0 lead. The crowd erupted-whistling, blowing horns, waving flags-it was just enough to drown out the moans of the visiting en­tourage. 
As the match wore on, Sodupe was consistently beaten to loose calls and rarely mounted enough offense to ev{m cross the -midfield stripe. The final 2-1 score owed more to blown scoring opportunities by Alaves than Sodupe's stingy defensive play. 
As we crossed through the parking lot on our way home from the stadium, my compan­ion remarked how the drivers in Spain give the impression they're out to kill somebody. 
Not if you're hoisting that blue and white flag.

Dilucia plays Volvos; Irish prepare for USC 
Observer Staff Report 
Notre Dame tennis coach Bob Bayliss may be without his top player for Friday's match against 11th-ranked USC, but this may be one time that he doesn't mind. 
Sophomore David DiLucia re­ceived an at-large berth to play in the Volvo Tennis/Collegiate Championships, the top tour­nament of the fall season. The tourney will begin Thursday in Athens, Ga. 
If DiLucia fares well in the opening rounds, he will miss USC's first trip ever to the Midwest. 
"Receiving an invitation to the Volvo Championships is an honor that I just couldn't take away from David," Bayliss said. "lie's worked hard to earn a spot in the field. There is a pos­sibility that he could play against USC if he loses in the early rounds. But I hope he ad­vances deep in the tournament and gives an excellent show­ing." 
Three other Notre Dame players were eliminated in pre­
qualification  rounds  for  the  
tourney.  
Walter  Uolhare  won  two  

matches over the weekend, but lost 7-5, 3-6, 7-5 in Monday's contest. Freshmen Chuck Cole­man and Mark Schmidt won first-round matches, but lost in the second round. 
If DiLucia advances past the early rounds, Dolhare will probably play in the top spot Friday evening against Byron Black, who is ranked 13th in the country. Black turned down a spot in the Volvo tourney be­cause of academic commit­ments. 
DiLucia is ranked 26th in the nation.

same birthdate as George Gipp's), Kline also made a name for himself as a Notre Dame player. The Williamsport, Pa., posted a career average of around .350 from 1915 to 1917, before leaving to serve in France during World War I. 


Valpo 
continued from page 12 
into the game. Freshman Paul Kaemmerer scored the second goal of the game at the 24:30 mark, and Grace singled him out for praise. 
"Paul has really developed in the past couple of weeks," says Grace, "lie scored a critical goal early in the game for us, and I think he proved he de­serves to be in the ballgame 
more." 
Kaemmerer and his team­mates dominated this game, as they lead 8-0 in corner kicks and outshot the Crusaders 21­
8. Valparaiso has an extremely young team (they started six freshmen), and their inexperi­ence was obvious on defense, where they gave up two goals on plays where they were at­tempting to clear their defense out of the zone and pull the Irish offsides. 
The only bad news for the 
In a 14-6 win over Michigan in 1917, Kline hit three home runs, which still stands as a school record. During his coaching days, the former third baseman liked to remember how he hit a fourth shot in that game that "went foul by inches."

Irish, except for the two Val­paraiso goals which upset Grace, was what appeared to be an ankle injury to junior fullback Paul LaVigne. 
The Irish will meet the Blue Demons at 3:30 Wednesday afternoon. 

FloridaQBs out because of gambling 
Associated Press 
GAINESVILLE, Fla.-Florida quarterback Kyle Morris and backup Shane Matthews have been declared ineligible for the rest of the season for betting on football games, the univer­sity said Monday. 
Meanwhile, university officials denied what it called rumors that head basketball coach Norm Sloan and three assistants had resigned, uni­versity spokeswoman Linda Gray said. 
Morris, of Clinton, Miss., and Matthews. of Pascagoula, Miss., admitted placing bets on professional and eollege games between laltl August and Oct. 7 -a violation of NCM regula­tions, Gray said. 
The Gator football program was rocked Oct. 8 when Coach Galen llall resigned amid alle­gations of NCM violations. 


Weather or not, Giants need punch 
Or Oakland, '89 World Series will be gone with the wind 
Associated Press 
SAN FRANCISCO-Will Clark is sick, the San Francisco hit­ters are in a fog and the Giants are about to face a longtime nemesis. 
So why shouldn't the Oakland Athletics think windy Candle­stick Park will be the place they breeze in the World Series? 
Maybe some lineup ehanges will help San Francisco and so 
might  a  shift  to  place where  
pitchers  must  hit.  But maybe  
not.  

Of the 39 teams that took a 2-0 lead. 29 went on to win. It happened the last two years and Oakland is hoping to get closer when Bob Welch starts Game 3 Tuesday night against Don Robinson.

The Irish were not as impres­sive in the third game as they had been in the second as they allowed the Quakers to record points in spurts.

manager Roger Craig said dur­ing Monday's off-day workout and then he promptly made changes aimed at doing just Jhat. 
Pat Sheridan, who hits left­handed, will replace Candy Maldonado in right field, and Matt Williams, who has played third base in the postseason, will move to shortstop in plaee of Jose Uribe, opening up third base for another left-handed hitter, Ken Oberkfell. 
"It's not that we're going to panic, but I feel like we've got to do something to try to get some offense," Craig said. 
So far, the Athletics have one more run than the Giants have hits. 
"I'll do whatever we need to try and score runs," Oberkfell said. "Maybe that means hit­ting the ball to the right side to

Turner led the Irish with 10 kills, live digs, three block as­sists and two service aces and Choquette tallied nine kills, five digs and four block assists to help the winning cause.

get the runner over. We need anything to help." 

The last time a team started the World Series so feebly as San Franeisco was 1950. 
That year, Philadelphia's "Whiz Kids" scored only one run in two games, just like these Giants. Those Phillies eventually did a little better, but still got swept by the New York Yankees. 
The Giants, second in the Na­tional League in runs and home runs, are batting .145 (9-for­
62) in the series so far. They were shut out a league-low six times this season, but got blanked in the opener by Dave Stewart and then managed live hits in a 5-1 loss in Game 2. 
Clark and Kevin Mitchell have combined for five of the Giants' hits, but arc 0-for-6 with run­ners in scoring position. 
''I'm really not pleased with the way the team played," Irish head coach Art Lambert said of his team's seventh win of the season. "We won but we have to do better. This was not a tough team. 
''I'm surprised we didn't jump all over Penn's young and inex­perienced team, but fortunately we got on track and gave ev­eryone a good chance to play."

The Notre Dame volleyball team swept Pennsylvania in three games Monday night 16-14, 15-0, 15-8. 
Irish men's soccer annihilates Valpo's Crusaders 9-2 
By KEN TYSIAC Sports Wnter 
Thn Notre Dame men's soccer team busted out of the grips of a six-game winless streak last night at Krause Stadium, pummeling an inexperienced Valparaiso team by a score of 9-2. 
Freshman forward Kevin Pendergast led the Irish scoring explosion with three goals. Sophomore Kenyon Meyer chipped in two goals and one assist for the Irish, and Tom Connaghan, Mitch Kern, Paul Kaemmerer, and Peter Sanchez rounded out the Notre Dame scoresheet with one goal apiece. 
Pendergast's hat trick was the first by a Notre Dame player since Randy Morris tal­lied three goals in a 5-1 victory over Roston University on Oc­tober 30, 1988. He now leads the Irish with nine goals and 21 points on the season, and is the first freshman to lead the Irish in scoring since Joe Sternberg finished with 25 points to lead the 1985 squad. 
"lie's a good goal scorer," says Irish coach Dennis Grace, "But he's also learning to play defense from the forward posi­tion. We're just happy he de­cided to come play here at Notre Dame." 
Despite the decisive victory, Grace was not completely pleased with his team's effort. The Irish gave up goals late in each half. one on a penalty kick by Valpo's Scott Fraungruber. and the other on a point blank smash by Paul Kinser. 
"I was pleased because we were able to play a lot of bod­ies." says Grace, "I was not happy about the penalty kick or the late goal they got from scrimmage, but it was good to get the win and go back above the .500 mark." 
The Irish improved to 6-5-3 on the season with the victory, and managed to work quite a few of their younger players

Clarence J. "Jake" Kline. the Notre Dame baseball coach for 42 seasons whose re­markable coaching long-evity earned him a place in the Col­lege Baseball Hall of fame, died Sunday at the age of 94. 
Kline, who had suffered a stroke on Oct. 5, passed away at St. Joseph's Medical Center in South Rend. 
Kline compiled a 558-449-5 career record at Notre Dame and in 1972 became only the sixth coach in history to win 500 games. Four of the five previous coaches to reach that plateau had been from Ari­zona and California, where the teams played schedules twice as long as Notre Dame's an­nual 20 to 30-game slates. 
Notre Dame's campus base­ball field was named in Kline's honor on "Jake Kline Day" in 1976, the year after Kline had retired as coach at the age of 81. 
Jake Kline 
1895-1989 Kline started his Notre Dame professional career as a math professor, then became a freshman football coach in 1931. He took over as base­ball coach in 1934, but con­tinued his duties in the math department until 1970, when he decided to concentrate solely on baseball at the age of 75. "I got goosebumps meeting him," current Irish coach Pat Murphy had said earlier this 


Notre Dame sweeps Pennsylvania 
By MOLLY MAHONEY Assistant Sports Editor 
It was a battle of the slow starters and the sloppy Monday night, but in the end the slow starters persevered. 
Once again the Notre Dame women's volleyball team took the role of the slow starter and the Quakers of Pennsylvania seemed willing to assume the part of the sloppy. 
It could be argued that both squads were vying for a chance to be the most slovenly in game one. 
But despite edging the Quak­ers 16-14, the Irish came to life in the second, blanking the visi­tors 15-0 and tallying a 15-8 win in game three. 
The Irish seemed bent upon proving the law of entropy in game one, as they succumbed to the Quakers inconsistent, if not unpredictable play and joined them in a free-fall to­wards disorder. 
Pennsylvania took a 5-0 led early in the game one but the

Irish crept back and finally caught the Quakers at 8-8. But that was not to be the only stalemate of the game. 
The two teams tied it up at 11, 13 and 14 before the Irish. who had been picking away at the Quaker defense with a well­rounded, but not always over­whelming attack, finally put the game away after freshman outside hitter Alicia Turner gave Notre Dame a 15-14 ad­vantage with a service ace. 
"In game one they just had us running in circles," senior cap­tain Kathy Cunningham said. "Usually we play team's with very structured play-they dig, they set and then they attack. But they just wanted to get the ball over the net, so you never knew what was coming over next. 
"All of a sudden we just fig­ured out what we had to do to win and we did it." 
One would think that Sybil had taken the court in game two as the Irish exhibited an entirely different personality. 
Unlike the apathetic Irish of game one, a possessed team came out and razed the unex­pecting Quakers 15-0. 
Sophomore middle hitter Chris Choquette, who has been playing with a broken finger. and Turner made up the first wave of the Irish attack and freshman Jessica Fiebelkorn, junior Colleen Wagner and Cunningham provided the surge needed to polish off a stymied Quaker squad. 
"We knew we shouldn't have let them get 14 points on the board in the first game," junior Amy White said. "We came out and served more aggressively and played with morn intensity in game two and just played them off the eourt. 
"We felt more in control once we put the first game behind us and we didn't want to concede anything to them in the final two games." 
Notre Dame took up where it leftlittlff in game two as they

year about his introduction to Kline. "He's a true legend in Notre Dame baseball. I hope I can touch half as many people as Jake has." 
Kline led Notre Dame to nine NCAA tournament ap­pearances, including five con­
secutive trips from 1956 to 1960. Kline's 1957 team earned the only College World Series berth in the Notre Dame baseball program's his­tory, and finished fourth in the nation. 
Kline taught University President Edward Malloy in mathematics and his former baseball players included Hall of Fame inductee Carl Yastrzemski, Notre Dame Athletic Director Richard Rosenthal, South Bend Mayor Joe Kernan, Montreal Expos President John McHale and Super Bowl quarterback and former Irish third baseman Joe Theisman.

Soccer mania thrives throughout Europe 
VITORIA, Spain-To the European sports fan, soccer is more than a national pastime-it is a call to arms. 
That's why thousands of spectators brandishing flags and ban­ners march miles to cheer on their respective teams. That's pri­marily why Barcelona earned the right to host the 1992 Olympics. And that's why I, during a brief respite from the semester in London, recently shelled out 600 pesetas to watch a Division III match between the Sodupe Union Club and Deportivo Alaves, in Vitoria, Spain.

Vitoria, the capital of Alava in the Basque country of Northern Spain, is home to some 180,000 people and is one of the few Spanish cities which has circumvented the threat of commercial­ism. Like any Spanish city, Vitoria closes down from one to four in the afternoon for the daily siesta. But after four, the shops re­open, bars begin to swell with people and the streets bustle with activity. 
It was then that I noticed a caravan of people, bubbling with en­thusiasm and waving flags adorned with blue and white stripes,
