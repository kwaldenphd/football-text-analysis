Nixon to give Vietnam progress report 
WASHINGTON (UPI) -President Nixon conferred for the first 
time yesterday with his military chief in Vietnam and announced he 
would report to the nation on Wednesday on prospects of ending the 
war. 
White House officials said the President would not usc the speech 
to announce a limited withdrawal of U.S. troops from Vietnam. 
Gen. Creighton W. Abrams flew into Washington unannounced 
Sunday afternoon for the White House conference, described as a 
general review of the military situation. The new, intensive wave of 
Viet Cong mortar attacks and whether they constitute a significant 
new offensive were dist:ussed, White House spokesman Ronald 
Ziegler said. 
Fortas to resign rumor: 'very reliable' 
WASHINGTON (UPI) Sen. Paul J. Fannin, (R., Ariz.) said he 
has "very reliable" information that Abe Fortas will resign this week 
from the Supreme Court. Fannin said the information came to him 
from a Washington attorney in a position to know. He would not 
name him. 
At the same time, Atty. Gen. John N. Mitchell confirmed that he 
met secretly with Chief Justice Earl Warren to give him "certain 
information known by me which might be of aid to him." 
Mitchell's terse announcement confirmed Newsweek magazine's 
report of a Mitchell-Warren meeting. Newsweek said the attorney 
general called on Warren at the request of President Nixon and to 
tell the chief justice of "far more serious" evidence against Fortas' 
off the bench activities than those made public so far.

N D booters tie 
The Notre Dame Soccer Club walked off the field Friday afternoon with a 1-I tie with Goshen College. It was a hard fought contest from the start. Goshen came from the opening kick-off and scored within the first three minutes of play. They scored on a left-footed shot from the outside. It was a tough goal, on the first penetration of the game and one of the few the Irish defense was to allow all day. The defense, led by Captain Greg Abrams, Rick Coleman and Ken Foley constantly thwarted Goshen offensives the entire afternoon. It was Foley especially who was effecitve at his left-fullback position, working with Abrams to start Irish fast-breaks. 
The first half ended with the 

visitors leading l-0, but the Irish front line soon permeated the Goshen defense to score with 15 minutes remaining in the third period. Fred Rohol scored from in close with the assist coming from John Amato. The Irish fought through the Goshen line many times in the second half and completely controlled play. It was only the eratic shots of the line that kept the score from being greater. Bob McAleer, the Irish goalie, played a fantastic game saving several shots that were certain scores. This game ends the Irish' undefeated spring soccer season, with a record of 2-0-1.

sport~ parade 
By Milt Richman, UPI sports columnist 
The man behind the merger 
NEW YORK (UPI) -Somebody had to make the move and in the end it turned out to be the one man nobody ever expected to-Art Modell, the National Football League president and owner of the Cleveland Browns. 
He didn't to it because he's a martyr, nor did he do it for the money as some already erroneously believe. 
He did it for the corniest reason in the world-"for the good of all"-and if there are those who take that to mean for his own good as well, Art Modell isn't going to bother arguing the point. 
As happens whenever 25 millionaires get together in the same room Modell, the 26th, was in Doctors Hospital with bleeding ulcer, there was considerable difference of opinion over which NFL clubs should move into the much younger, less established American Football League. 
The prevailing sentiment was "let George do it" and for awhile NFL officials were looking exactly as foolish as the major teague baseball owners did when they were going around in the same unbroken circles trying to find themselves a suitable commissioner. 
But there are some good thinking men in football also, men who 
will put the game ahead of their own selfish interests, and did this 
past weekend. 
Pete Rozelle, the football commissioner, is one of those who 
worked hardest. When the 25 millionaires in his Park Avenue office, 
who sat there 35 hours and 45 minutes all told, protested they were 
"too tired" from time to time, Rozelle insisted they stay until they 
could hammer out an agreement. 
So Rozelle deserves any extra fanfare he gets. So does Carroll 
Rosenbloom of the Baltimore Colts and Dan Rooney of the 
Pittsburgh Steelers, who agreed to go into the AFL along with the 
Browns. 
But one man possibly deserves more credit than all the rest and Paul Brown picked him out. Brown's choice was Art Modell, who originally objected to moving his ball club to the AFL. 
"I just feel that's all to his credit," Brown said of Modell when 
asked how he felt about the NFL president and Cleveland owner 
changing his mind. 
"It was his decision that what is best for pro football is best for everyone." 
Those who are now saying Modell, Rosenbloom and Rooney "sold out" for the money, an estimated $1 million apiece couldn't be more wrong. 
None of the three asked for any money. The idea to give them. some came from the 13 other NFL owners who felt the three new representatives in the American conference should be compensated for the natural loss in receipts they are bound to uncur because the new ballparks in Cincinnati and Kansas City won't be ready for at least another year. 
Besides, none of the three arc hurting that much for money that they'd bolt the NFL for that reason alone. All three are well fixed. 
The next logical question then is why would such a hide bound NFL man like Modell consent to over to the rival circuit, and from his room at Doctors Hospital where he's still on a bland diet, he undertook to furnish the answer. 
"A week ago this past Friday night May 2 I had dinner with Pete Rozelle," Modell said. "I told him 'I have a surprise for you. If certain conditions are met, Cleveland is a possibility."' 
That was the first time Rozelle had any inkling Modell would even consider moving his club to the other league, but Modell had a surprise in store for himself, or rather a shock, when he returned to his hotel room here for the alignment meetings. 
He fell unconscious that night and was taken to the hospital where he has been since. But he has kept in touch by telephone . "I made my decision this past Friday," he says, "but before I did 
spoke with Wellington Mara of the New York Giants and Dan Rooney. l wanted to make sure the Rooneys knew my position and that the Giants wouldn't suffer." 
"Originally, I was dedicated to a 16 I 0 status quo," says Modell about the alignment. "I wanted 16--10 for two years. The next best thing, l felt, was to deliver three teams now so as to preserve the rivalries and maintain competition. Now that it has been done, I feel happy. It's been rough. I haven't had a smoke in nine days."
