Futur~ president at P-ress conference 
Henry lists 
by Ann Therese Darin Campus Editor 
Incorporation of St. Mary's College controlled by laymen ranks high on new SMC president Edward Henry's list of priorities 
At a press conference Tuesday afternoon to officially announce his appointment as first lay president, the 51-year-old Minnesotan stressed the need for reconstruction of the Board of Trustees. and inclusion of students and faculty on the Board. He also emphasized the necessity for the two groups to work on SMC forward planning. . 
Questioned on future cooperation between the 127-year-old college and neighboring Universit of Notre Dame, Henry prophesized, "I am strongly in favor of cooperation. Not only with Notre Dame, but also with other local instutions." He believes other forms of cooperation, specifically a consor-tium of South Bend colleges and universities should be explored. 
Meeting with Burtchaell 
The present director of the Center for Local Government at St. John's University, Collegeville, Minn., has not yet conferred with Notre Dame administrators. However, he hopes to meet with Rev. James Burtchaell, university provost when the Notre Dame administrators heads north to St. John's next month for a speech. 
If merger does occur, Henry thought "organic growth" of both schools and "not the superimposition of a forced pattern of cooperation" would be a prerequisite. 
"I am not set against merger," he continued. "I believe we should stress those attributes which the two in institutions have in common, but keep differentiating characteristics." 
The former St. Cloud Minn mayor enumerated these St. Marv's characteristics as an ability to be responsive'needs and as a small college which creates a better community atmosphere 
In event of merger, Henry revealed he is not 
assured of a job by the Board. While he will "technically not begin" until July 1 (with a self­limitation of a 3-year term), he plans to com­mute between St. Johns and SMC bi-weekly.

Dr. Edward Henry, new SMC president stresses lay and student emphasis on~oard of Trustees 
He emphasized any merger action should not be motivated by projected financial cost savings, but on a better quality of education. Diagnosing the problems with the present merger stalemate. Henry said, "The groundwork was not well prepared ... the ramifications were not well explored." 
Several questions from local newsmen con­cerned SMC's continued existence as a non­federally funded college. Henry expressed confidence in his newly-adopted college, which recently disclosed a $694,000 surplus. 
Small college renaissance 
The former St. John's University Vice­President of Development reinforced his op­timism by predicting a small college renaissance in popularity, "Students are asking for a community which is viable. Small colleges, small units, can provide this." 
Before the conference, Henry briefed repor­ters on other results from Sunday's special Board of Trustee session. Besides confirming him as president, trustees also voted to continue merger negotiations with the University of Notre 
Dame. They also declined to appoint a new t Trustee Vice-Chairman, despite William

Introducing Henry, Mort Lmder, press hason for the college during the merger, read the of­ficial staement from Mother Oliv~tte Whele~n, Trustee Chairman, to the St. Mary s commumty. 
Dated March 13, 1972, the two paragraph communique read, "The Board of Trustees of St. Mary's College is happy to announce the appointment of Dr. Edward Henry, President of St. Mary's College, Notre Dame, Indiana. 
"Dr. Henry will meet with the faculty and professional staff at 4:30 pm in Carroll Hall and with students at 5:30 pm in Stapleton Lounge, Monday March 13." 
Active at St. John's 
Neither Mother Olivette nor Sr. Alma Peter, acting president, whom Henry succeeds, were present at the news ~l''lference. 
A graduate of St. John's in 1943, Dr. Henry attended Harvard Graduate School of Business and received his masters degree in political science, a masters in business administration and a Ph. D. in political science from the University of Chicago. 
He inaugurated the Department of Gover­nement at St. John's in 1954 and served as its chairman until 1969. From 1959 to 1964, Dr. Henry also served as assistant to the president and Director of Development at St. John's. From 1951 to 1954, he was assistant to the president of Mt. St. Scholastica College in Minnesota. 
Dr. Henry's wife, Elizabeth, is a college professor of psychology and counseling. They have nine children. 
Dr. Henry funded and directed the Minnesota Tri-College Honors Program from 1958 to 1967. The first of its kind in the nation, the program provided travel aborad, research, workshop and summer school for faculty members of three colleges, including a state-supported institution. 

Bayh discusses busing, the war, the election 
by Jerry Lutkus 
Observer News Editor 

US Senator Birch Bayh, senior Democratic Senator from Indiana, argued yesterday that "Where it's necessary to supply quality education, then we must bus, but quality education is not supplied by a magical racial ratio." 
Talking and answering questions with a small group in Carroll Hall, Bayh continued that too often it is only "the blacks who are bussed out and that isn't entirely fair, but it doesn't make sense to bus kids to inferior schools." 
Bayh related the schooling problem to deeper problems within the environment. He claimed that Nixon's veto of the day care center bill was "tragic." "The cards are stacked against these kids from birth." he said. 
The problem that is left. then, he continued, is inferior schools. Bayh outlined three alter­natives to inferior schools: 1 l tear them down, 2) refurbish them, or 3) bussing. 
He also identified bussing as "the most volatile issue in the '72 election." YIETI\:\1\1 AI\D THE DRAFT 
The question of the Vietnam war and the draft 
occupied much of Bayh's time and he complied 
that "I firmlv believe that the war will be over 
within a vear. Next vear. the residual force 
protecting the freedom ·of the Vietnamese people 
will be volunteers."' 

In Senate action concerning the war. Bayh 
voted in opposition to the extension of the draft. 
but he said that he isn "t philosophically tied to 
the volunteer army concept. Rather. he felt this 
was an effective means of registering his 
disapproval of Nixon's war policy. 

He did express approval of the present draft 
deferments. "Too often college exemptions 

Sen. Birch Bayh on busing: quality education not supplied by magic racia I ratio. 
become permanent deferments. We cannot exist \l"ith nne class intellectually immune from the most dangerous service to the country," he noted. 
Bayh claimed that support for the volunteer army is so great because it means that >:omebodv else would have to serve. He reminded the students that "a bad war isn't made good by having somebody else's head shot off. .. 
:\IECII.\:\JZ,\TIO:\ OF THE WAR 
The increased mechanization of the war is 
··folly"" according to Bayh. "It makes a bad 
policy politically acceptable." He claimed that 
militarily it is also follly. The American forces 
have shown an inability to use weapons on the ground and they haven't been able to shut off Viet Cng supplies. Bayh contends that we should sit dowrwittt-he North Vietnames::-and tell them: "You release our prisoners, we'll with­draw, let's set a date." 
Nixon's television speech revealing his peace plans was "a line political move," Bayh said, but he continued that Nixon knew one of his con­tingencies would never be met. 
Bayh further emphasized the necessity of ending the war when he stated that "This business of a nice way to conduct war is foolish. The name of the game is to kill and that's reason enough to stop." 
The Gulf of Tonkin resolution which initiated American activity in Vietnam was a "'presidential carte blanche," according to the Indiana Senator. "It wasn't a responsible thing for Congress to do," Bayh claimed. 
He noted that there were only two dissenting votes on the resolution when it appeared before the Senate. "McGovern, Muskie, McCarthy, Hartke ... they all voted for it. I even voted for the crazy thing." 
When questioned about possible amnesty for deserters. Bayh said, "I'll buy it. But only after the war. Not before the war is over." 
ITT HEARII\'GS 
Bayh noted that when the hearings on In­ternational Telephone and Telegraph and Hichard Kleindeinst began, he was "really surpsied." He said he couldn't predict what was going to happen. 
"There is a great deal of circumstantial evidence, hard evidence." But, he added, "where there's smoke, there's gotta be fire."

South Bend protests train schedule 
by Mike O'Hare 

The Interstate Commerce Commission held public hearings last evening concerning the request of the Chicago South Shore and South Bend Railroad to discontinue 37 passenger trains and reschedule other trains. 
The hearing was held before a large crowd in the auditorium of the South Bend Public Library. Mr. Cross was the ICC examiner at the hearing, with Mr. Karl Van Doren, Public Counselor for the State of Indiana, representing the state. Also present were attorneys representing the city of South Bend and the South Shore Railroad. 
South Bend Mayor Jerry Miller was the first to testify at the hearing. The Mayor stated that in regards to its effect on South Bend, "virtual isolation would result from the new scheduling." Miller also cited "the ecologically desirable effect which the electric trains have on our environment," as opposed to other means of transportation. 
Mr. Bauer, state representative for St. Joseph County and a member of the state assembly's transportation committee, ac­cused the South Shore of wanting to severely cut back on passenger service in order to concentrate upon the more lucrative freight service. He referred to the railroad industry's lobbying for government subsidies for public transportation as "halfhearted when compared to their intense effort in the issue of "full crew repeal." 

Persons from all walks of life testified at the hearing; com­muters to Chicago and Gary, college students, businessmen and homemakers. The hearing is a result of an application of the Chicago South Shore and South Bend Railroad to the ICC for permission to discontinue 37 passenger trains, as well as changes of schedules of certain other trains. The ICC must rule on the application by May 31, 1972.

Editorials printed in The Observer reflect the opinion of the writer,Business: 283-7471 on behalf of the editorial board. Columns reflect the opinion of the individual writer; they are not to be taken as editorial comment. 
Opportunities at St. Mary's 
The past few years have been difficult ones for St. Mary's College. It has been without a permanent president for two years following the death of Msgr. John McGrath; it has been without a clear direction since the alternate suspension and resurection of merger negotiations with the University of Notre Dame. Caught in a situation they could not control, St. Mary's students have been enraged, then resigned, and never sure what would come next. 
As the new president, Dr. Edward Henry has the opportunity to change this. He is not tied to any of the past policies, and brings considerable experience in academic and political life to the job. 
In his press conference yesterday, he defined some of his priorities. Perhaps the most important is restructuring the Board of Trustees, the power of the college, so that it is controlled by lay people. Both faculty and students would be represented on the new board, a long over due idea which wouldn't hurt Notre Dame, either. 
A new governing body at St. Mary'swill go far in openin~ the channels of 
communication that have been strained and broken in the last months. It will grant the school more freedom to ex­periment with new educational ap·· proaches. 
The most pressing issue facing Henry remains the relationship of Notre Dame to St. Mary's. It would be absurd to reverse history, to renounce what cooperation and unity exist, to deny that in many ways, Notre Dame and St. Mary's are inevitably united. With Henry's approach, however, the question is: how close should the schools be? 
Again, Henry has the opportunity to plan and act without the spectre of past decision hanging over him. He has called for a consortium of colleges, which is a realistic proposal in a time of tight money for higher education. It gives several schools the chance to act collectively, if they are willing to cooperate. 
In short, Henry faces opportunities as the new president at St. Mary's. He has the chance to make the school a living entity.

Calendar proposals 
Now that over 3400 students have signed a petition disagreeing with the Academie Council's 1972-73 academic calendar, its time to offer some concrete proposals. The two calendars listed below offer a choice of the University approved semester schedules and alternate proposals for each semester. 
In order to make a large sampling of student, faculty and administrative opinion on the calendar proposals, we are asking you to mark your choice of a calendar for each semester. Students give the straw vote ballot to hall presidents. Faculty and administrators mail them, via campus mail, to The 
Observer's LaFortune office. 
Briefly, the rationales behind each of the semester schedules is: 
1. University first semester: designed to follow a current trend towards pre-Labor 
The calendars 

Day openings, provide more first semester class days, provide a longer break at Thanksgiving. 
2. 
Alternate first semester: designed to protect summer jobs that must run until Labor Day, provides for only a five-day Thanksgiving break. --both first semester calendars have 70 class days 

3. 
University second semester: primarily a re-organization of the present second semester schedule redesigned to allow two medium length breaks. 

4. 
Alternate second semester: follows the trend towards early May closings when the first semester begins in August, allows one long mid-semester break. --both second semester calendars have 72 class days.

Notre Kersten Out on the weekend1umuuumummnm1nmm1muum 
~iophomore bows out 
1111uuu1uuuuuuuunuuuuuuuluuuuulmmmmmmmlml Bob H;ggins 
Tom O'Mara's decision to transfer to Berkeley should make all of us 
think about more than just who his replacement will be at forward next 
season. 
Tom O'Mara is a good basketball player. With a year of experience 
under his belt he could verywellhave been one of the mainstays in a potent 
Irish basketball team next year. But he has chosen to leave. 
The reasons he gave in yesterday's Observer article are more than 
personal reasons. They comprise an accusation against Notre Dame and 
even more so against the society as a whole. 
He called collegiate basketball a job, not a game. For us, as students, it 
may be just a game. Or is it? It was students who pelted Marquette 
coach AI McGuire with hot dogs and assorted rubbish during one game. 
It was students who were involved in the Minnesota-Ohio State fiasco. 
And Bob Lackey of Marquette and Tom Rikker of South Carolina, they're 
both students, yet they slugged it out on National television in January. 
It's more than a game. 
On the administration level it is worse. College basketball is an in­
dustry, competing to a certain extent, with professional basketball for 
talent. A significant portion of the income for College basketball is 
provided by television which is using the power of the dollar to call more 
and more shots concerning who will play who, when and where. And 
ticket prices are no longer set in the good spirit of the old college rivalry. 
If you care to see the NCAA Regionals at Dayton this weekend be 
prepared to pay a scalper up to $50 for a ticket whose face value ia an 
astounding $20? 
It is no wonder that a basketball player feels like an employeee. Just 
ask Tom how many "friends" asked him for tickets to the UCLA game. 
On the subject of Notre Dame specifically, O'Mara called the university 
"something less than an intellectual or academic oasis". The implication 
is that Notre Dame does not stand out among the desert of universities 
that exist around it. Perhaps this is true; perhaps not. More probably, it 
is a matter of opinion. I hope, for Tom's sake, Berkeley is such an oasis, 
or he is liable to spend another year realizing how bad his choice was. 
O'Mara further contended that the university "fails to consider the 
emotional needs of its students." Cases in point here are the perrennial 
rejection of hall self-determination of parietal hours by the Board of 
Trustees and Father Hesburgh's closed-minedness on this is one clear 
cut example of administrative disregard for student's emotional needs. 
Tom has taken issue with what he calls an" attitude of sacrifice-an at­
titude of let's get it over with," which he finds on this campus. I contend 
that this attitude is prevelant anywhere, but may be more widespread 
here. The fact is that a lot of students would rather not study than study, 
but few realize that things may be even more difficult when all the 
studying is over. If Tom can find a more positive attitude at Berkeley he 
should definitely transfer. 
Notre Dame is loosing more than a top-notch forward. Notre Dame is 
loosing a very intelligent and sensitive student who is challenging the 
university to justify its existance in an "over competitive society." Notre 
Dame is being asked to answer to the unhappiness and frustration that 
seem so great at times. And it is being asked to evaluate its athletic 
programs to discover whether the athletics and fans are still the primary 
consideration or if the almighty dollar has assumed the place of honor. 
The sophomore forward's personal criteria is, as he put it, "to do as well as I could out there, and I'm glad I did well enough so that what I'm saying can be taken seriously." I don't think there is any question that he will be taken seriously. The fact that he did so well in a year that he knew would be his last, playing in a sport that he considered a job, shows what a fine athlete Tom O'Mara really is. Yesterday's statement is an indication of the strength of this man's convictions. 
I do not attempt to pass judgment on Tom O'Mara's decision. Rather the fact that someone in his position would transfer for the reasons he gave should make all of us, as members of the University Community re-evaluate our own position here and realize that there are many mor~ Tom O'Maras whose names never reach the newspaper but are just as alone, unhappy or frustrated.

Observer Insight by Ed Ellis 
SBP Kathy Barlow --an evaluation 
Today is the last day that Kathy Barlow will occupy the office of Student Body President of St. Mary's College. She will celebrate her "going out of office" tonight and tomorrow will find a new name, a new face, and a new and vastly different personality sitting in her chair in the basement of Holy Cross Hall. 
The year Kathy Barlow influenced was a tough year, a year of uncertainty, sweeping change, and high melodrama at SMC. Freshman hours were eliminated with no apparent traumatic drop in frosh morality; parietal hours were proposed for the first time at SMC; a new president will sit in Lemans next August when students return, and the impending marriage of SMC to the Golden Dome was halted inches from the altar. Most important of all, the revolution came to St. Mary's in the form of departing Notre Dame diplomas. 
This will be an analysis of the year of Kathy Barlow. We will consider the following five points in discussing her period of leadership: --the potential value of the goals set up by her administration --the realism or appropriateness of the goals --the amount of effort expended on those goals --the intelligent direction of those efforts --results 
There are, of course, other variables to con­sider, and these will be discussed also. GOALS 
The goals of the Barlow Administration were quite admirable, but at times totally out of step with the political reality of the St. Mary's campus. She drove to raise the consciousness level of a student body that had hours, sign-ins, ludicrous liquor regulations, and closed dorms, not to mention a severe identity crisis relating to Notre Dame. 
Better results would have appeared had she knocked off some of the regulations before playing philosophy teacher with 1700 students who could care less. Self-determinism is fine, but we can say with some validity that had Barlow shown people action before coming on strong with her philosophy, her search for cosmic truth would have been more successful. 
An incident illustrating this further is the unmerger crisis. Here Barlow was out hunting for truth, and full disclosure, but occasionally she left a desire for concrete results back in her room along with her celebrated radicalism. 
In another area, Barlow wanted to cooperate with the Notre Dame Student Government, but her irlealism clashed too often with the pragmatism of Notre Dame SBP John Barkett. 
This idealism didn't always clash, however. 
Barlow aimed at uniting students with liberal 
faculty and administrators against the nuns who 
control the College. This was pure pragmatic 
politics with well-conceived goals iln~ excellent execution. It worked well, and the groundwork will serve the next SMC student government well, and could even be studied by Notre Dame politicos. 
In short, Kathy Barlow possessed high idealism and a coherent set of goals for her program. In dealing with students and ad­ministration, however, she often confused the can with the ought. 
EFFORT 

The efforts of the Barlow government to affect the students were strenuous and fairly well thought out, except, of course, for the issue of ND-SMC cooperation. Political reality, however, often inerfered, and Barlow was unable to separate her principles from her concrete programs. For example, she refused to separate the question of parietals from the philosphical principle of self-determination. We all know that nuns can take parietals if disguised carefully. However, "self-determination" is reality intruding into a sanctuary. Had Barlow carefully manipulated the issue, she probably could have achieved soe sort of positive esults, but her misdirection of the student effort leaves 
the  question  to  be  settled  by  tomorrow's  
president.  
RESULTS  

Results, of course, must be our key to judging any outgoing official. v:e can divide most of Barlow's results into three sections: 1) merger, 2l self-determination, and 3) groundwork. q 
As noted, her groundwork deserves the highest of praise. If cultivated carefully by succeeding administrations, this will prove to be a valuable source of student power for years to come. 
Self-determination and the raising of student consciousness get mixed reviews. Some students were turned off by Barlow's efforts, others wre very impressed. The very fact that students at an all-white, middle-class establish­ment school even thought about such mattets seems to be an accomplishment, although it falls short of what might have been done had Kathy Barlow been more of a diplomat.

The most importan issue, and the one on which this year's government will be judged, is the unmerger crisis. One result of this was the in­tense student activism of last December. This is good. Another result-though probably indirect ­is increased administrative respect for the student body and its wishes. 
However, Barlow's demands for complete disclosure and remerger will probably never be attained, and many students are going to be hurt. 
One very plausible explanation is that the classical radical Kathy Barlow, faced with her greatest challenge, was not radical enough. Simply, a great non-violent but physical manifestation of student power was needed, but never came. 
At any rate, Barlow's performance during those last weeks of last semester was good, but perhaps not good enough. 
ADDENDA We ought also to consider some qualities of Kathy Barlow the person. First, she gets high grades for sincerity and resoluteness of purpose. Nothing-not even political reality -could shake 
.....
her faith in her philosophy. Though some will 
I
criticize her for such stubborn maintenance of 
belief, we must realize that she has someting 
there that few of her detractors -and few of her 
supporters -can claim. 
Also, we might note that Kathy Barlow is a 
very strong-willed person. She is stubborn and 
vocal, and this led eventually to the disin­
tegration of the working relationship between herself and her vice-president. A strong per­sonality always creates problems, and this was no exception. Hopefully, the benefits she gained for the students and the groundwork shs gained for the next administration will override the ill­effects of the demise of Missy Underman. 
CONCLUSION 
"Call 'em like you see 'em" is always the best anyone can do, a on this score we cannot fault Kathy Barlow. It should be clear from the preceding analysis -brief and insufficient though it may be -that she always made her decisions conscious of the information she had a and the principles she held. Today, she says she would change few of her decisions of the past year. That is the mark of a person who has done her best. Her best may not have been good enough, but it could certainly have been much worse. 
Were the job of SBP a 3-hour course, SBP 
KathY. Barlow would rate a solid B.

The forgotten view: SMC parents 
by Maria Gallaght>r St. Mary's Editor Vv hite the merger controversy rages endlessly, one side stands strangely silent, seldom heard from or sought: the parents' viewpoint. Being removed from the immediate scene of the debate, they are at a disadvantage at either getting information or making themselves heard. Usually, their only expression of 
Obst>rvt'r Insight 

opinion is in the form of an occasional ietter to the administation, or perhaps a third-hand account borne by their daughters. 
This past weekend, however, was Sophomore Parents Weekend at St. Mary's, providing a rare op­portunity for parents to seek their own answers right at the scene of the battle, and for their opinion to be samples. 
A prevalent attitude of "disappointment" was echoed by all parents polled. Most appeared neither bitter not upset, but simply resigned to a decision which seemed beyond their grasp and impossible to reverse. Tired of double-talk and reluctant to accept any more optimistic communiques issued by various sources, one parent sighed, "No official spokesman will tell you what's going on. You don't know how much to believe of what they tell you. And no one seems to agree on anything ... " 
The confused mother was not alone in her sentiment, Edward T. McKiernan agreed saying, "The whole thing should be discussed openly. As things are now, the situation isn't even understandable. More in­formation is definitely necessary and it should be given." 
Not only did parents lament their uninformed position, but complained that they consequently could not help guide their daughters in deciding what 

SMC parents express an attitude of disappointment over merger affairs. 
direction their education would take in the future. 
Some parents felt that the decision not to merge would actually prove beneficial to SMC, or at least have little or no effect. 
"The science department at SMC has always been strong; that's why Linda came here," said Mrs. Ed­ward D. Hotlcamp, whose daughter is a biology major. "The student -faculty ratio of 120 to 7 is much better compared with Notre Dame. I see no reason why SMC shouldn't remain academically strong, if not stronger, by the decision not to merge." 
Questioned about girls in majors not offered at SMC, Mrs. Holtcamp said she felt these girls should be given first preference at Notre Dame in transferring, since they had matriculated here on the pretense of a merger that would strengthen their departments. 
Mrs. Urban John Kampsen went a step farther in her views.

Miami, March 13-A half-dozen would-be Democratic presidents scattered around Florida today in last efforts to win support in the state's presidential primary in whieh every other issue has been lost in the long and loud debate on school busing. 
All seven major candidates returned to populous Miami tonight, the eve of the primary. The election, which state officials say has generated unusual in­terest, will probably result in a record voter turnout. 
Secretary of State Richard Stone, Florida's chief election official, predicted that during the hours when the polls are open tomorrow --from 7 a.m. until 7 
p.m. --1.5 million Democrats and 500,000 Republicans are expected to vote. 

down tonight, there was continued squabbling over who was going to finish second. 
Almost everyone agreed that Alabama Gov. George C. Wallace's segregationist history and his angry denouncing of school busing, had made him the Democratic primary favorite. 
President Nixon is expected to win easily in the Republican primary over Rep. John M. Ash­brook of Ohio, a critic of the t'resident's foreign and domestic policies, and Rep. Paul McCloskey of California, who stopped cam­paigning after getting only 20 percent of the vote in the New Hampshire Primary last week. 
Sen. Hubert H. Humphrey of Minnesota and Sen. Henry M. Jackson of Washington each claimed that he would be second in the Democratic primary despite

"I've seen this happen at other schools; usually the male institution wants to gobble up the smaller girls' school. I think there is room in our society for good women's colleges, and I think St. Mary's is a good one. 
She added, however, that ''In a way, though, it's too had." Most of the parents, however, favored merger and regretted its demise. 
"I myself am in favor of the merger and was sorry to see it fall through. That's all I have to say," com­mented Richard A. Batt. · 
"It would have been the greatest thing they possibly could have pulled off," concurred John Tuohy. "The ones who are caught in between, the sophomores and juniors. will have it rough, but the place will be around for a long time to come." he said. 
Three -parents found fault with the administration and the trustees for the final outcome. 
Pierre C. Lacombe said he was "disappointed that the merger didn't go through, but it's better that it was brought to a head and now its over." 
"St. Mary's will go on." he believes, "but the trustees couldn't have done thir homework very well to have discovered a discrepancy." 
"I'm really sorry about it all, especially after all the publicity, the announcements, and the promises," remarked Mrs. RobertS. Kenney. "Sr. Ama should have gotten up at the banquet last night and talked and answered questions." 
Peter Carella likewise expressed disappointment, and puzzled "It's hard to see how they can do what they did since this year's freshman were guaranteed Notre Dame degrees. 
Donald Cistle, apparently dissatisfied with the merger's fate, summed up his feelings this way: "As far as I'm concerned, the merger is my $4,000 and it's all going to the nuns."

vote effort for Sen. Edmund S. Muskie of Maine. 
Muskie, a heavy favorite with Democratic party regulars when the Florida campaign started, has had trouble catching fire in the state and there were some reports that his support had eroded to some degree. 
In addition to organizing car pools for tomorrow, the Muskie forces had a telephome and letter blitz underway this weekend. Computers were feeding hundreds of thousands of pieces of Muskie literature into the mail. 
Before returning to Miami, where he plans to lie in the sun alongside a hotel swimming pool tomorrow, Jackson flew across the state, holding press conferences at the airportsn Tampa, Orlando and Jacksonville as well as Miami.

Bayh speaks here on '72 campaign Issues 
I <..ontinued from page 1) If Nixon's aooointment of Hichard Kleindeinst were left up to him. Bayh said he "wouldn't let him through the door." A presidential endorsement, as 
of yet. has not been made by Bayh, but he cautions that "I wouldn't be surpsied if I made one b before the week is out." 
Bayh sees Nixon as the force that 
will l'ventually unify the Democratic Party in the 1972 Pl£>ction. The situation in the (}(mocratic Primaries now, ac­cording to Bayh, is "healthy." llow£>vcr, "in an effort by the candidates to survive, thee are things said that'll make reconciliation difficult." He cited the behavior of George McGovern and John Lindsay in the Florida primary. "They aren't going to kiss and make up," he said. 
Ceorge Wallace's role in the presidential picture is "a bad one" in Bayh's eyes. Wallace will not be a major force in the vote count, he predicted, but rather he will be an important psychologi· al force. He will show a significant con­stituency and that is detrimennal according to Bayh. This support, lw said. will ~:a use the OUJt'r candidates to compromise. 
When questioned about his ab­sences from the Senate, Bayh confirmed that for quite a while he toyed with a presidential aspirations. Because of this, he found it necessary to campaign. 
Bayh said that it's a question that must be answered by the people of the state. If the people of Indiana didn't think his absences were warranted then Bayh said they should vote against him. 
"Thre's no way that Birch Bayh from Indiana could win the presidency unless he was out talking to the people. As a Senator I'm payed to represent my state and from the governmental standpoint I could shape evets better as President than as Senator."
