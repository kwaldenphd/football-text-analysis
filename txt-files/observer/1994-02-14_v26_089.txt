Accident ends students' Mardi Gras celebration 
By SARAH DORAN Associate News Editor 
A van carrying ten passen­gers, eight of them Notre Dame students, to New Orleans for Mardi Gras crashed on an icy Missouri highway early Friday morning injuring two passen­gers seriously, according to William Kirk, assistant vice president for residence life. 
Alumni sophomore Greg Borkowski is in the Intensive Care Unit of the Missouri Delta Medical Center in Sikeston, Missouri after undergoing surgery Friday for two broken ribs and a slight liver lacera­tion. He may return to Notre Dame towards the end of next week. 
Also, Pangborn sophomore Mary Kraft is hospitalized in Saint Francis Hospital of Cape Gerardo, Missouri after sustaining a broken pelvis and broken fifth lumbar vertebrae. Her injuries did not warrant surgery, and the date for a return to school will be deter­mined pending arrangements for physical therapy. in South Bend.

Only two passengers, Doer­hoff and Howard sophomore Mairin Ocheltree, who was dri­ving the van at the time of the accident, were wearing seat­belts. Doerhoff suffered a bruise to the side of her head and Ocheltree.a broken nose. 
Other passengers, including Borkowski and Kraft, were asleep in the rear of the van when the accident occurred. They were either uninjured or sustained minor injuries and returned to school Friday af­ternoon, said Kirk. The Univer­sity sent its airplane down to get them, he said. The students are: 
Alumni sophomore James Delaney, who suffered a broken wrist. . 
Alumni sophomore Michael Lauinger, who was uninjured. Lewis sophomore Amy Mapother, who was uninjured. 
Walsh sophomore Catherine Mcintyre, who suffered a bruised pelvis bone. 
Maddie Hopkins, a student at the University of Missouri, and Seth Hopkins, a student at Southwest Missouri State Uni­versity, were also passengers in the van at the time of the ac­cident. Both were uninjured. 


Center for Spirituality celebrates 1Oth anniversary 
By LAURA FERGUSON Assistant News Editor 
In a small office tucked away on the first floor of Saint Mary's Madeleva Hall, a dedicated staff works to foster the mission of the Sisters of the Holy Cross-to prepare women to assume roles of leadership in the Church and society. 
Ten years ago chairman and professor of religious studies, Keith Egan created the Center for Spirituality for that purpose. Now, in the celebration of their tenth anniversary, the Center for Spirituality continues to grow and foster the mission of the Sisters of the Holy Cross for students, alumnae and friends of the College. 
In the original proposal Egan submitted to the Board of Re­gents in 1984, he outlined the several goals which he had for the Center for Spirituality. 
The Center seeks to "witness that life in Christian faith is central to all the other educa­tional benefits offered by Saint Mary's, bridge the gap between the college community and the Sisters of the Congregation of the Holy Cross, serve as a re­source for the alumnae, par­ents, and friends of the College and to make a contribution to the life of the Church in Amer­ica and at the same time to the local church in South Bend." 
Egan proposed to accomplish these goals by sponsoring workshops at Saint Mary's and at several other areas in the United States. He also aimed to collaborate with other academ-CE::.'\TER FOR SPJRITL"AUTY SAl:\TT .:'>IARY'S COLLEGE 


ic departments, such as nursing and work with Campus Ministry and Mary's Solitude in facilitat­ing spiritual programs for stu­dents, faculty, alumnae and friends of the College. 
Because Campus Ministry fo­cuses mainly on the direct min­istries such as liturgies, sacra­ments and counseling, the Cen­ter for Spirituality was designed to cater more to the spiritual dimensions and focus on a more intellectual side. 
In recent years, the Center for Spirituality has organized several lecture series aimed at education in spirituality. The most notable of these lectures, the Madeleva Lecture in Spirituality, is also the high­point of the year's anniversary celebration. Given every April, the Madeleva Lectures focus on an outstanding woman thinker in spirituality. Each lecture is published by the Paulist Press and usually becomes a best­seller, according to Egan. 
This year, Gail Porter Man­dell, professor of Humanistic Studies will be speaking on Sister Mary Madeleva Wolff, one of the most fondly remem­

'94 Literary Festival underway 
By MELISSA SHELDON News Writer 
In keeping with its tradition of bringing together authors and their readers, the twenty seventh annual Sophomore Lit­erary Festival kicked off last night with a reading by author Michael Harper. 
"The Sophomore Literary Festival brings two elements together -the author and the reader; there are few places where this union can take place," said Katie Lawler, chairman of the festival. 
Lawler and her eighteen com­mittee members have worked since last March to bring the festival to the student body. The search started with three brain storming sessions in which the committee persons formed a list of wanted authors by asking students and professors which authors they wanted to be invit­ed to the festival. This list was then divided into three rounds by order of preference. 
"Our main focus was to chose authors by how excited they were to attend the Literary Festival, " stated Lawler. "We wanted authors that wanted to be here." 
By September of last year the committee had already ar­ranged for the arrival of five authors. Charles Johnson, the second African-American au­thor to win the National Book Award and author of "Middle Passage," expressed excitement about the festival and will arrive at Notre Dame later this week. The committee also invited

INSIDE COLUMN WORLD AT AGLANCE 

Valentine's Day ... Humbug 

There are no days in the·-------­
year that I have more dis­like for than Valentine's Day. I understand that for those who are young and in love, this can be a very sig­nificant day and probably feel that I shouldn't be slamming it. However, since I am old and bitter: pipe down, read, and be Eric Reuthling happy in your own col­Photographer umn. 
My dislike for today goes back to my early grade school days. The bad news for me came about a week before the actual day when the teacher would convince all of us to make some form of a card holder for all of those valentine cards we would receive. 
Now, I've never been artsy-cutesy guy, and was much more of a barbarian in grade school than I am now, so the idea of doing anything associated with hearts -or other "girlie things"-repulsed me. This attitude often pro­duced a ragged, glue sloppy, faintly valentine­like folder which resembled nothing that the teacher had in mind. 
The mandatory giving out of cards to all the members of the class also didn't sit too well in my Star Wars ridden mind. I couldn't imagine Luke and Han giving such flimsy and "smoochie" things to the likes of Shanna Brelsford. They'd probably blast her. Despite my active protest, which mainly consisted o whining, my mother always got me plenty o cards and "strongly encouraged" me to fill them out TO EVERYONE. 
I seemed to be the only one who actively fol­lowed this rule of elementary school card giv­ing, because for many years I had fewer cards than there were people giving them. If you think getting dissed for a SYR here is bad news, imagine sitting in fourth grade with all of your friends talking about "the cool cards that Tonya gave out," and you lacking one. 
As I progressed into later years, I thought this nonsense of Valentine's Day would cease but today it continues to plague me. It came in the form of the radio. 
First, understand that I'm a slow person wak­ing up in the morning, and one of the things I do is wait in bed until a real pumped up, guitar braying, could wake the dead song comes on the radio. Then I get up. Since I'm usually tuned into a classic rock station, for most morn­ings it only takes a song or two to get me going. 
On Valentine's Day it is a different story. It seems that the people who are awake enough to phone in requests are bent upon giving their slumbering loved one a music greeting by requesting various slow songs. This is a prob­lem for me because it is impossible for me to think, much less to rise when I hear "Wonderful Tonight" at 7:10 A.M. Usually I end up spend­ing an inordinate amount of time, like the entire day, just lying there in a comatose state, eagerly waiting/praying for something by Bob Seger to get me going. 
I could go on and on about how the personals annoy me, the over abundance of red in cloth­ing, the constant braying of "Happy Valentine's Day" or derivatives thereof. and so on. There is nothing that I like about today. However, i you happen to see my fourth grade Valentine from Tonya, just drop it by my room. I'll proba­bly be in bed.

LOS ANGELES 
Gas prices rose just over a penny per gallon on average during the last three weeks, a national survey showed Sunday. 
The average price of gas on Friday was $1.1086 per gallon, including all grades and taxes, according to the Lundberg Survey of 10,000 stations nationwide. 
Survey publisher Trilby Lundberg said the upward trend started in January. The last survey, taken Jan. 21, showed an average price of $1.0985 cents per gallon, up from the Jan. 7 figure of$1.0951. 
The rise "should be looked at as a partial correction of extraordinarily low prices that prevailed from a fall over­supply of gas and a winter drop in crude oil prices," Lundberg said. 
At self-serve pumps, the average price of regular unleaded gas was $1.0361, mid-grade unleaded $1.1512, premium unleaded $1.2325 and regular unleaded was $1.0647. 
At full-serve pumps, regular unleaded was $1.4313 per gallon, mid-grade unleaded was $1.5191, premium unleaded was $1.5920 and regular leaded $1.3205. 
No reunion planned, McCartney aide says 
NEW YORK 
A London newspaper report that the three surviving Beatles are planning a concert in Central Park is an "out and out lie," an aide to Paul McCartney said Sunday. A spokesman for John Lennon's family said he knew nothing about the concert either. Jeff Baker, McCartney's personal assistant, told ABC Radio News that 'there's not a shred of truth" to the report in The 


Mail on Sunday. The newspaper said McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr would perform in Central Park later this year, and would be joined on stage by Lennon's sons, Julian and Sean. The newspaper did not identify its source. It said each of the former Beatles would be paid $30 million for the concert, which would be televised worldwide, and said McCartney chose New York as a tribute to Lennon, who was gunned down in front of his Manhattan home in 1980. Baker told ABC that the report is an "out and out lie put around by optimistic promot­ers" trying to persuade the trio to perform. 
Diplomats leave as talks waver in Sarajevo 

SARAJEVO 
Bosnian Serbs besieging Sarajevo resumed turning in their big guns on Sunday after the United Nations accept­ed a compromise plan. The Muslim-dominated Bosnian government expressed concern that the Serbs were just buying time to prevent NATO air strikes that could begin Feb. 21 if the guns ringing Sarajevo are not pulled back. The compromise allows Serbs to turn in their heavy weapons at U.N.-monitored Serb bases, rather than at Sarajevo airport as originally planned, said Maj. Jose Labandeira, a U.N. spokesman. The Bosnian army object­ed. "Those weapons can be returned to combat positions very fast," said Bosnian army Gen. Fikret Muslimovic. "I am afraid that such an approach and an attempt to ap­pease the aggression further would bring a hardening of the Serbian position," said Haris Silajdzic, the Bosnian prime minister. The Serbs earlier insisted they would surrender their guns only if the Bosnian infantry aban­doned its front-line positions. But after heavy lobbying by 
U.N. officials the Serbs turned over 13 heavy weapons on Sunday. bringing the total to 36 guns: 26 Serbian and 10 Bosnian. The Bosnian Serbs are estimated to have at least 500 heavy weapons, while the Bosnian army has about 50.

VMI argues men, women learn differently 
ROANOKE, Va. 
The issue of whether men and women learn differently is on trial as the Virginia Military Institute struggles to remain all-male. It wants a separate, different military college for women set up at a former finishing school. The Justice Department has sued VMI, saying the exclu­sion of women at the state-supported school is discrimi­natory. An appeals court agreed, but gave the state the option of setting up a similar program for women. The Justice Department returned to court Wednesday to argue that The Virginia Women's Institute for Leadership, proposed for the all-female Mary Baldwin College, is based on gender stereotypes. It wants U.S. District Judge Jackson Kiser to force VMI to admit women. Testimony was scheduled to resume Monday. The V-WIL program would exclude the 24-hour military atmosphere at the 155-year-old men's school. There would be no Spartan barracks without privacy and no boot camp indoctrination. VMI's witnesses have said women would develop as better leaders in civilian and military life without the military atmosphere and "adver­sative model" of education. 
Accused woman discusses clinic arsons 
WICHITA 
A woman accused of trying to kill an abortion doctor has provided details linking herself to abortion clinic arsons around the country over the past three years, The Wichita Eagle reported Sunday. In a series of letters and interviews with the newspaper, Shelley Shannon provid­ed details that suggest she was involved in several arsons or knows who was. Her activities are under investigation by the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. "This could go on for some time .. .I figure at least six different states, several places in some states," she wrote in a letter to the newspaper. "That's what I get for traveling hither and yon, doing this, that and the other thing." Shannon, 37, of Grants Pass, Ore., was charged with attempted first-degree murder in the Aug. 19 shooting of George Tiller outside his clinic, Women's Health Care Services. Tiller was slightly wounded in both arms and returned to work the next day. Shannon is being held in lieu of $1 million bond awaiting a March 21 trial. In one telephone interview,-Shannon said she decid­ed in 1990 that violence against clinics was justified. "In fact, I think one baby's life is worth more than all the buildings in the world," she said.

president, Jo Hackenbruck for secretary and Liz Broghammer for treasurer. 
Jennifer O'Dell for president, Jennifer Wicker for vice presi­dent, Erin Kopfer for secretary and Beth Renken as treasurer. 
Implementing more commu­nication throughout the class including off campus students is a top priority, according to Condon. 
"It seems that in the past, there have been a number of activities, but since students don't know about them, they have not had a large turnout; we'd like to change that," Con­don said. 
Increasing class unity and in­volvement is essential, accord­ing to Conway. 

Her ticket would like to estab­lish a program for students to work at a city soup kitchen. 
"We'd also like to increase awareness about post-graduate scholarships and work with the Counseling and Career Devel­opment Center to help seniors prepare for their future," Con­way said. 
In order to have the best se­nior year, they will need the input from the rest of the class, according to Wicker. 
"Our whole campaign is based on implementing change and producing results," Wicker said. "The only way to do this is to encourage seniors to speak out." 
There are also three tickets running for junior class officers. In alphabetical order they are: 
Meggan Awe for president, with Jennifer Doyle as vice­president, Maureen Zamarelli as secretary and Sarah Fol-

Kathy

Improved relations with the junior class at Notre Dame is a priority, according to Awe. They are interested in fund-raisers and increasing the amount of class input in the activities and events, according to Awe. 
"We want to know what they want us to do so we can accom­plish it for them," Awe said. 
Opening the lines of com­munication by using the col­lege's e-mail system is their main thrust, according to Raczkowski. They hope to use the system to record the min­utes from each board meeting, she said. 
Making the student govern­ment system open to more ideas and opinions is the primary goal for the Misch ticket. 
Misch said that in order to achieve this, they would like to "specifically delegate power to more people to encourage a di­versity of ideas." 
There is only one ticket run­ning for sophomore class board. 
Laura Lob is running for pres­ident, Emily Ruffner for vice­president, Becky Kellogg for secretary and Kathleen Zimmer for treasurer. 
All have served on the fresh­man board this year. Through their experience with each other, they would be able to accomplish many goals, said Ruffner.

seen in his latest work "Every Eye Ain't Asleep: An Anthology of African-American Writers Since 1945." 
The committee planned this year's festival with a different focus. 
"This year we wanted the Lit­erary Festival to be just that-a festival and a celebration of lit­erature rather than a lecture series," said Lawler. 
In addition to the nightly readings there will also be in­formal discussions with the guest authors. 
This festival is great for the aspiring writers, lovers of liter­ature or the readers who just want to meet the person be­hind the writing, according to Lawler. 
"I know it's easy to let a win­ter February week pass by without leaving your room, but this festival with dialogue literature would be a really sad thing to miss," Lawler said. 

Rushdie remains in hiding from Islamic world 
ByALEXEFTY 
Associated Press 
TEHRAN, Iran 

Five years after the late Aya­tollah Ruhollah Khomeini sen­tenced Salman Rushdie to death for allegedly insulting Is­lam, Iranian leaders remain adamant that all Muslims have a religious duty to kill him. 
The "fatwa," or Islamic reli­gious decree, that Khomeini is­sued Feb. 14, 1989, was un­precedented in modern times. 
It caused a storm of interna­tional protest led by Britain, Rushdie's country. It widened the fissure between Islam and Christianity after centuries of distrust and strained Iran's re­lations with the West. It was endorsed by the Organization of the Islamic Conference, which represents 51 Muslim states. 
Rushdie has so far escaped the assassin's bullet or knife. He has been in hiding and un­der guard by Scotland Yard's elite Special Branch since Khomeini declared him a tar­get, then died four months later of cancer. 
The death sentence was ex­tended to anyone associated with publishing Rushdie's al­legedly blasphemous novel "The Satanic Verses." Several translators and others have been killed or wounded by Is­lamic zealots. 
Iran's Khordad 15 Founda­tion, a religious charity, has offered a $2 million bounty to anyone who slays Rushdie. The bounty was increased last year by an unspecified amount. 
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Khomeini's successor as Iran's supreme religious and political leader, has ruled the fatwa ir­reversible. 
Western diplomats in Tehran believe that appeals to Iranian leaders to withdraw the fatwa are unrealistic, because that would mean questioning the wisdom of Khomeini as the di­vinely-inspired leader of the Islamic revolution. His word is considered infallible. 

They believe it could only be withdrawn if the fundamental­ist clergy-dominated govern­ment is no longer in power ­and there is no sign of that hap­pening, even if it means contin­uing Iran's international isola­tion. 
The government was strongly criticized by Tehran newspa­pers last week for allowing the screening of a film with a script by Turkish writer Aziz Nessin, who has published "The Satanic Verses" in his country. 
The radical Jomhouri daily had denounced Nessin as some­one "who no longer has a place among Muslims and should, like Rushdie, be killed." 
The Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance banned all Nessin's works in Iran and or­dered his works removed from bookstores and libraries. 
Rajaei Khorassani, a leading Iranian lawmaker, believes the best way to deal with the fatwa is to quietly forget it and get on with normalizing relations. 
"I believe we should avoid politicizing the case of Rushdie," Khorassani, chair­man of the Parliament's Human Rights Committee and a former ambassador to the United Nations, told The Associated Press. 
He contended that President Hashemi Rafsanjani's govern­ment "has not made the slight­est attempt against the life of Salman Rushdie, either offi­cially or in a covert manner." 
How true that is may never be known. But Western gov­ernments have accused Tehran of being behind the assassina­tions over the past five years of exiled dissidents and non-Ira­nians opposed to Iran's brand of Islamic fundamentalism. 
Khorassani, who has advo­cated improved relations with the United States and criticized Iran's hard-line clerical leader­ship, also said that the fatwa cannot be lifted by Khomeini's heirs.

"The School of Sacred Theol­ogy, which was founded by Sis­ter Madeleva in 1943, was a forerunner to the Center for Spirituality," Egan said. "At the time that it was created the School of Sacred Theology was a creative, daring, and innova­tive step in educating women in theology. It was clearly an inspiration for the Center for Spirituality."

President Malloy, 

In these days, when so many institutions are struggling with the ques-­tion of sexual orientation, it is necessary that our university not remain silent. In particular, we, the Graduate Student Council, urge you to initiate the process of formulating an official and public statement which repudiates discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation alone in the employment and advancement of faculty, students, and staff at this university. 
Further, we feel that there is a clear mandate from the Church to enact such a policy. Both the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith and, more importantly, the new Catechism of the Catholic Church have noted the distinction which must be drawn between homosexual orientation and activity. We also note the declaration in the CDF's "Letter to the Bishops of the Catholic Church on the Pastoral Care of Homosexual Persons" that the Church "refuses to consider a person as a 'heterosexual' or a 'homosexual' and insists that every person has a fundamental identity: the creature of God, and by grace, his child and heir to eternal . " (Section 16) Where the Church refuses so to categorize persons, surely a Catholic university must also refuse. 
Therefore, in light of the aims of this university as expressed in the col-­loquy for the Year 2000, and especially in light of the renewed emphasis on the Catholic character of this place of study, let us serve as a model for a Catholic response to this pressing social question. Let us make a clear state-­ment to the members of the Notre Dame community that discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation will not be tolerated.

Any questions cal/1-6482 
By JENNIFER DIXON Associated Press 
WASHINGTON 
The Clinton administration is considering taxing or slashing welfare benefits to the poor, el­derly and disabled to finance expansions in training and child care for millions of single mothers on public assistance, officials say. 
The administration's welfare reform task force is also eyeing strict limits on federal cash payments to the growing num­ber of elderly people who im­migrate to the United States legally and then retire on Sup­plemental Security Income, a senior administration official said Sunday. 
To pay for its overhaul of a welfare system that supports 5 million families with children, most of them headed by a sin­gle mother, the administration has decided it must find offset­ting savings in other federal welfare programs. 
But an advocate for the poor says the very cuts the adminis­tration is now considering in SSI, food stamps and Aid to Families with Dependent Chil­dren could hurt the working poor and near-poor in order to help other poor women get jobs. 
A senior administration offi­cial, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the task force is considering several options to pay for welfare reform, but that no decisions are final. 

"We are committed to a deficit-neutral plan in which revenue from these options would be used to pay for the new investments in child care, education and training," the official said. 
President Clinton's welfare reform legislation, to be intro­duced this spring, will seek to limit welfare benefits to single mothers to 24 months. Women would be given the training and day care they need to get a job and after two years, would be required to find a job in the pri­vate sector. Those who are left behind would be required to do community service work. 
Among the cost-cutting op­tions under consideration is a plan to cap emergency AFDC assistance, a program that helps poor families avert being evicted or having their utilities shut off. In the fifth year after the administration's welfare re­form takes effect, the cap would save $500 million. 
Also on the table is a plan to treat AFDC, SSI and food stamps as taxable income, much like unemployment in­surance, so that a person who lands a job after being on wel­fare part of the year would pay taxes on those benefits. 
The government could save from $1.5 billion to $5 billion in the fifth year of welfare reform, but advocates for the poor says such taxes undercut the admin­istration's often-repeated promises to "make work pay." 
Robert Greenstein, director of the Center on Budget and Pol­icy Priorities, said taxing wel­fare would primarily hurt low­income working families who collect food stamps and could push them deeper into poverty. 
Another option under consid­eration is to limit SSI benefits to elderly immigrants. 
The Clinton plan would re­quire than the income of an immigrant's sponsor be count­ed in calculating welfare bene­fits until the immigrant becomes a citizen, not just the first five years after arriving in the United States. 
That would save up to $4 bil­lion in the fifth year. 
The Treasury Department is also looking for ways to root out fraud in the Earned Income Tax Credit program for the working poor, with potential savings of up to $1.5 billion a year. 
The administration official said the task force is also study­ing limits on SSI disability pay­ments to drug addicts and alco­holics, which have been grow­ing rapidly in recent years.

Buthelezi prepares for violence after boycotting elections 
By DONNA BRYSON 
Associated Press 
JOHANNESBURG 
Zulu leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi told followers Sunday to prepare themselves for "casualties and even death" af­ter his party's decision to boy­cott the nation's first all-race election. 
The Inkatha Freedom Party's decision to sit out the April vot­ing will lead to heightened vio­lence, Buthelezi said. He ac­cused the rival African National Congress of having already started "ethnic cleansing" against his people. 
An ANC leader told 5,000 chanting supporters Sunday that it was Inkatha and the white right-wing that was lead­ing the country toward civil war. 
"We warn them that we have put our lives down for freedom before," Tokyo Sexwale, the ANC's leader in the Johannes­burg-Pretoria region, said at a rally in the violence-scarred black community of Tokoza outside Johannesburg. "If we have to do it again, we will not hesitate." 
The Zulu nationalist Inkatha party called for the boycott Sat­urday, hours before the dead­line for registering for the first election to include South Africa's black majority. Nine­teen other parties, including the ANC and the governing National Party, met the dead­line. 
The ANC, which led the fight against white minority rule since its founding 82 years ago, is expected lead the voting in the April 26-28 election. 
Months of talks involving Inkatha, right-wing whites, the government and the ANC dead­locked last week over how much power regional govern­ments would have under a new constitution. 
Negotiating as the Freedom Alliance, Inkatha and the white right-wing want autonomous or independent homelands where they can govern themselves and maintain privileges enjoyed under apartheid. 
The government and ANC re­ject setting up territories on the basis ofrace or tribe. 
"There are people in this country who are claiming that they must be given their own land. That will not happen," ANC head Nelson Mandela told a cheering crowd of 5,000 dur­ing a campaign speech Sunday in Retreat, in the southwest. 

President F.W. de Klerk scheduled a meeting Monday with Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini, Buthelezi's nephew, seeking to break the impasse. The ANC set talks next week with the Bophuthatswana black homeland, another Freedom' Alliance member. 
"We'll continue to try to ne­gotiate, even after the elec­tions," Mandela told reporters. 
Speaking in the northeast town of Empangeni to more than 8,000 members of the Inkatha youth wing, Buthelezi hammered at the ANC's al­liance with the South African Communist Party and at the in­ability of its leaders to stop political violence. 
"lt is impossible for me to lie to you and reassure you that the IFP's opposition to fighting 
the election ...will not bring casualties and even death," he said. 
"If you look at the 'ethnic cleansing' that is taking place on the East Rand, they seem to have started on this kind of genocide," Buthelezi said. 
The East Rand area has been the center of bloody clashes be­tween Inkatha and the ANC. Ethnic cleansing is a eu­phemism coined in Bosnia­Herzegovina to describe the practice of one ethnic group using killings and threats to drive members of another group out of an area. 
Calling up references to an­other historical tragedy, Buthelezi said the ANC and its Communist allies might try to "exterminate the Zulus as the Nazis tried to exterminate the Jews."

Assistant Accent Editor 
Among the dozens of roses, mil­lions of pieces of candy and thou­sands of cards being given today, plans for the future are also being made. Love is in the air, and the pealing of wedding bells is in the near future for four Notre Dame/Saint Mary's couples. 
Sorin Hall was the setting for the blossoming romance of one of these couples. Angela Rathweg, a Notre Dame senior majoring in German and sociology, and Marcus Adrian, a fifth-year architecture major, met in Rathweg's freshman year at a dorm party in Sorin Hall, she explained. 
"On our first date, we went to the Sorin Talent Show," she said. 
The couple got engaged during exam week this past semester, with Adrian proposing in a manner straight out of the Old World. 
"He drove to my hometown at 
4:00 a.m., met my father at his office and talked to my mother and asked their permission," she said. 
"Then he came back and asked me." The couple is planning a wedding in the summer Of 1995. 
One of the most memorable moments of their courting years took place while the two were study­ing abroad, agreed Rathweg and Adrian. The couple met up with each other in Venice. 
"We hadn't planned to study abroad at the same time, but it just worked out that way," said Rathweg. 
To celebrate this Valentine's Day, the couple will share a romantic dinner together. 
Fate had a romance in mind when Jennifer Nicola, a Saint Mary's junior elementary education major and Eric Belin, a Notre Dame senior Biology and pre-med major met. 
"He called me my freshman year out of the dogbook at 6:30 on the night of his Dillon Christmas SYR to ask me to it," said Nicola. 
"And I said yes for some strange reason. We've been dating ever since." 
The couple 


Students celebrate 
Valentine's Day with wedding plans 

weeks ago, on Fri. Jan. 28. 
"He told me not to make any plans for that Friday night," she said. "We went to Tippecanoe Place and he gave me 'Phantom of the Opera' tickets for my birthday." 
After the two got back to Saint Mary's they went for a walk, said Nicola. The couple walked behind the Haggar College Center to a bridge connecting Lake Marion to a small island. 
Nicola explained a Saint Mary's legend that whomever a girl walks with over the bridge will be the man she marries. 
"We talked for a while and then he pointed out the statue of Mary on the island and said something like that there was too much snow on the step leading up to the statue," she said. 
"Finally, he convinced me to try and brush the snow off." While she was digging through the snow, Nicola found a rose and a card, in which Belin had written that he needed to ask her something. 
He then asked her to marry him. 
"I was completely in shock and I think I still am," said Nicola. The couple is getting married on June 3, 1995. 
Nicola said that their birthdays are close to Valentine's Day, so they them celebrate together. She said in the past they have had dinner and spent time together on Valentine's Day. 
"This year, I think we've been eel­ebrating Valentine's Day since the engagement," she said. 
For Nicola, one of her most memo­rable moments was her first date with Belin. 
"I will always remember the night we met," said Nicola. "It just seemed r t-he asked me if I believed in fate, and I told him I guess I did." 
For two Notre Dame senior accounting majors, a class offered more than an opportunity to obtain knowledge. It gave them love. 
Greg Pryor and Dana O'Leary met their freshman year in their Introduction to Philosophy class. 
"Our first official date was the beginning of our sophomore year," she said. "We went to see a movie." 
The couple got engaged on Nov. 10, 1993. "He got down on his knee and asked me," she said. The couple is planning a Sept. 1995 wedding. 
One of O'Leary's most memorable moments in their relationship was· when she flew down to Pryor's hometown in Oklahoma City on June 11, 1993 to surprise him for his 21st birthday. 
The couple does not have anything particular planned for this Valentine's Day, but in the past they've gone out to dinner, said O'Leary. 
Not only «;lid the Notre Dame marching band camp help Notre Dame senior Genny Yoder help introduce her to the band, but she also met her future fiancee, Brian Hagerty, ND class of 1992, there. 
"Brian was my section leader and the third person I had met," said Yoder. 
"On our first date, we tried to go to LaFortune for a milk shake, but LaFortune was closed," she said. 
The two were friends until close to the end of her freshman year, when they started officially dating each other. 
Hagerty and Yoder got engaged on Jan. 2 of last year, after Yoder returned from the Notre Dame Band Cotton Bowl trip. 
"We went to the wedding of one of 
his roommates. After that, he asked me to marry him," explained Yoder. 
One of Yoder's most memorable moments in their relationship was when she went to see him last sum­mer at his home near Lake Erie. 
"We went fishing and we started to notice that a storm was coming," she said. Hagerty turned the boat around, but on their way in they saw two boaters whose engine wouldn't work. 
Hagerty and Yoder helped the two men pull their boat in. As they were doing this, "the sky opened up and everyone got drenched," she said. Yoder explained that it was quite a sight. 
Hagerty currently lives in Buffalo, but he comes out to Notre Dame almost every three weeks, said Yoder. "The phone bills are crazy," she said. 
The two do not have any plans for Valentine's Day and have yet to set a date for their wedding. 
Modern Love 
Isn't What It 
Used To Be 
Always a bridesmaid, never a bride . 
At the mere age of twenty­one I already find myself saying this cliche, after recently being in the bridal parties of two of my peers. 
They say we're too young, too naive, too unexperienced to be in love, but what do they know. Everyone told my roommate, "You'll be disap­pointed. You'll be poor. You'll miss out." . 
But the words did nothing more than wiz by my roommates ears, deaf by love. "We have each other, and that's enough for us," she'd always reply, her wide brown eyes sequined with tears of devotion. 
The truth is my roommate and her husband are running into some financial difficulties. And she is living a 'different' lifestyle -instead of studying and going to the 'Backer,' she's cooking dinner and watching'the news. But she's happy and in love and that's all that matters. 
Of course. it doesn't always work that way. Love shafts us all, and each in our own way. The loyal get trampled. The promiscuous get diseases, the unsus­pecting get betrayed, the fragile get broken. The rich get poor. the poor get poorer, the needy get needier. The obssessed sleep on the doorsteps of their beloveds, sobbing all night, or call their message machines over and over just to hear the cherished voice, always hanging up without leaving messages. 
Love makes us do crazy things. Our hearts create a coup on our minds. We stare mindlessly out the win­dow of O'Shag. We giggle at the thought of our loved one while in the computer lab. We stand outside in -12 degrees after parietals, just to be with each other. 
But now we're starting to go a bit overboard folks. 
What we want from love, what we expect from love, what we need from love hasn't really changed. What changes, what makes modern love modern, are the impersonal forms we have been using to express it in, and the public landscape on which we expose our private lives.

At this very moment, in every town large enough, every college liberal enough, to print personals, legions of lonely hearts are taking pen in hand to reduce their charm and aspirations to the lowest possible word count. 
They are single, divorced, and married; gay, straight and bi; black, white, Hispanic, and Asain; non-smoking and smoking. They are senstive . They are voluptuous. They look a little like Billy from 'Melrose Place' or Hally Berry. They write their ads, they fax them in and they wait , they hope, they dream. Even the atheists find prayers on their lips. 
If the ads don't pan out, they try other means. They sign up for video-dating services, call 900­number party lines, e-mail suggestive messages, air out their dirty laundry on STUDS.

Garth Brooks 'Honky Tonks' through the 
JACC 
By KAREN SHOPOFF 
Accent Writer 
The night had finally arrived. The singer who makes men stomp them cowboy boots and women shriek his rocking country vocals in delighted anguish was about to take the stage at the JACC. 
Garth Brooks had come to Notre Dame. The crowd at the JACC was ready to go an hour before the concert was to begin. 
Still, they had to wait a little longer. Martina McBride opened the concert for Brooks with her spunky, energetic music. 
Even though she delayed the much-antic­ipated main event. the audience was very receptive of McBride and her musical charisma. 
"I really enjoyed Martina McBride as the opening act," commented junior Peggy Bailey. 
Now it was just a matter of minutes before the king of country music was to take the stage. 
The Wave rushed around the arena three full times, as chants of "Garth, Garth," grew louder and louder. 
Finally, the lights went out, and Brooks, along with his band, entered from a cap­sule that rose up from underneath the stage. 
Brooks opened the show with Standing Outside the Fire, which quickly brought the crowd to their feet. 
Next up was The River, with elaborate blue swirling lights adding to the emotion. 
Brooks credited George Strait and George Jones as his country music mentors. He also noted gaining direction from James

Taylor and Billy Joel. 
Performing with his keyboardist, Brooks sang Candle in the Wind,, the hit song by Elton John, who Brooks mentioned as another of his influences. 
Brooks expressed his personable nature as he told a story about a Notre Dame stu­dent he met Saturday afternoon. 
"Jamie asked me to play this song for her, but I also dedicate it to you and to me," Brooks said as he began to play Unanswered Prayers. 
Although Brooks performed Unanswered Prayers without his band, it was not a solo performance. The entire arena acted as his backup singers, screaming each chorus. 
At the end of the song, the overwhelming applause caused Brooks to throw off his guitar and fall to his knees. 
"He seemed like an everyday guy from Oklahoma," commented Bailey. 
Although Brooks used staged set-ups to introduce most of his songs, Thunder Rolling needed no such introduction. 
As smoke once again filled the stage, mechanical thunder clapped and bright white lights simulated lightning. 
The mood created by the lights and sounds added to the emotion of the song, which tells the story of a woman who is abused by her husband. 
Brooks was extremely appreciative of the Saturday night audience. Speaking of the Sunday night audience, Brooks said, "They'd better pack their lunch if they're going to beat tonight." 
The women in the audience cheered loudly to Brooks' gyrations as he crooned 

Shameless. 
The superstar finished the hit with white lights on him from all angles, including lights· shining from the floor. 
In another break, Brooks introduced his lead guitarist Chris Leuzinger, who claimed to know only three chords. 
Because of this, the audience was well aware that I've Got Friends (in Low Places) was to be the next song. 
Once again, Brooks and his band had over 10,000 backup singers. The crowd sang the chorus of I've Got Friends with the musical backup of Brooks' band. 
Brooks closed the show with his favorite song The Dance. Judging by audience reac­tion, it was also the favorite song of many in attendance. 
Before he left the stage, Brooks gathered the many flowers and gifts that his fans gave him. 
With his arms full, Brooks thanked the audience for the warm and enthusiastic response. and left the stage. 
The applause of the audience caused Brooks and his band to reappear for an encore. 
With intensity, Brooks sang Ain't Coin· Down (Til the Sun Comes Up). He ran around the stage before jumping onto a rope ladder hanging from the lights, singing all the while. 
Those in attendance at Brooks' shows were definitely not disappointed. 
The intensity of the show was maintained for almost an hour and a half, with the energy of the performer matched only by the energy of his .audience.

Brooks arrives to warm welcome By KAREN SHOPOFF Accent Writer  
After much anticipation, the entertainer of the year made it to Notre Dame. On Saturday night, 'the JACC was trans­formed from basketball arena to big-time country music show set. Garth Brooks had finally come to town. Many Notre Dame and Saint Mary's students waited in line for tickets last December. However, few were actually able to attend either of Brooks' sold out shows this past week­end at the JACC. Junior Peggy Bailey was lucky enough to get a ticket Uyst before the concert. "I just found out one of my friends had an extra ticket," she said. "It should be awesome, because everything that Garth does is awesome," said Bailey before the concert began. Chad Gardner got two tickets from a more interesting source, complements of Garth Brooks himself. Gardner, a junior studying electrical engineering, was in the JACC on Saturday after­noon watching the erew set up the lights and stage. "Garth walked up to me, shook my hand, showed me around his dressing room and gave me two of the best tickets in the house," Gardner said. Gardner's friend Paul Singh did not believe that he was go­ing to go the concert courtesy of the big guy himself. "I thought he was playing a prank on me," Singh said of Gardner's luck, "It should be a good concert; I hear he's a great performer," Singh said in anticipation. Singh and Gardner agreed on one thing: "Garth has a firm handshake, nice table man­ners, and God did a good thing when He put him on earth."

Zurcher was playing the match of his life that the murmur of a upset floated among the fans at the Eck. 
The upset, however, was not that of a team but of a player, Chad Clark, currently No. 2 soon to be No.1 in the nation when the next poll comes out. 
A seemingly red-hot Clark ran into an intense, focused, Andy Zurcher. 
The result? 
Zurcher pulled off the upset of the year by beating Clark 6­2, 3-6, 6-1. 
"The plan," commented Zurcher, "was to consistently pressure Chad by chipping my backhand low and seize the net whenever possible. The match was pretty even throughout. Both of us had our opportuni­ties. I guess the turning point was when I broke him at 2-1 in the third set." 
It takes more than a plan to win, however, for victory re­quires execution. 
Notre Dame fell a few scarce points away from following the lead oftheir captain, and a moment's breath from beating a frontrunner for the NCAA championship. 
"It is unfortunate that we were one tie-breaker away," stated Notre Dame head coach Bob Bayliss. 
"It's tough to play as hard as we did and not come away with the win. You don't get too many chances to knock off a top-four team. I am proud, however, of the way our play­ers played. With a little luck we could have won." 
The season continues when Notre Dame faces MSU at 6:00 Tuesday night in the Eck Paval­lion. Maybe this time lady luck will show.

Irish ROTC dominates basketball tournament 
Special to the Observer 
Battling through tough com­petition unscathed, the Notre Dame ROTC basketball teams won both the men's and wom­en's titles in the eighth annual Flying Irish Invitational this weekend. 
Navy Notre Dame men com­piled an 8-0 record in the three-day event to claim their second title in the last three years. 
The midshipmen defeated Louisville Air Force 52-37 to complete a title run that fea­tured a payback victory over last year's champion Purdue Navy. 
John Neal's lightning quick defense and hot shooting keyed the victory with strong long­range support from Ben O'Rourke. 
A joint Air Force-Navy squad hung tough in a series of tight contests to claim the women's title. Spearheading the host team's effort was player-coach Shari Shepard. She got support 
Peter, 
from freshmen Shannon Crombie, Amber Simonic and Jen Laurie. 
A one-point semifinal defeat of defending champion South Dakota State Air Force and a come-from-behind 36-30 tri­umph over Kentucky Army-Air Force capped a perfect 6-0 weekend. 
The two victories continue the Irish dominance of the event. Nine of eleven champions have been from Notre Dame. To complete an Irish weekend sweep, Navy men's coach Lt. Roger "Chip" Hilarides claimed his third straight cadre hotshot title. 
The Flying Irish Invitational, hosted by Air Force ROTC's Detachment 225, is the nation's largest ROTC sporting event. Forty-three teams from across the midwest made the trip to South Bend, squeezing in 109 games in 44 hours. 
"This year was the most com­petitive ever, with high-calibre play all around," said advisor Captain Alan Andrysiak.

Different meets, different stories for Irish track teams 
By DOMINIC AMOROSA 
Sports Writer 
Healthy runners and injuries were the story for the men's and women's track and field teams this weekend. 
The women had injuries, while the men had their health, as the squads ventured into the state of Michigan for two differ­ent meets and came out with two different results. 
The undermanned women's team placed fourth in a quad­rangle meet with Big Ten pow­ers Michigan, Penn State and Michigan State in East Lansing, while the men's team finished third in the 25 team Central Collegiate Conference meet. 
"We struggled a little bit," commented coach Joe Piane concerning the women's result. "The 14 girls that made the trip all showed tremendous heart and they competed very well." 
The three other Big Ten schools entered over 30 ath­letes in the meet. Injuries and illness have depleted a power­ful Notre Dame team.

"It really hurt our team goals because the other teams had so many people," explained junior Lisa Junek. "We'll do better in larger meets because our team will get healthy." 
The Irish did have their share of standouts as Junek finished first in the 55m hurdles with a time of 8.05, and sophomore Erica Peterson placed second in 1600m. Freshmen Carolyn Long and Heidi Altman also shined for the Irish in the BOOm and 400m races respectively. 
"It wasn't what I wanted, but I was happy," commented Junek, who won the Meyo Invi­tational in 7.96 seconds. "Our team did fine considering the circumstances." 
On the men's side, the Irish scored in every event except three, but still finished behind a powerful Michigan and Eastern Michigan team. 
"We performed pretty well," said Piane. "It was a good, solid team effort and we had good people across the board."

Todd Herman placed second in the high jump Saturday at the Central Collegiate Conference Meet. 
Tom Mescallled the way for the balanced Irish team. 
Herman placed second in the high jump with a mark of 7'1. Mescall competed in the triple jump and high jump and had his best performance of the year according to Piane. 
"Tom is doing very well right now in all his events, including the long, high and triple jumps," said Piane. 
"The competition was the best we faced all year," said Mescall. "Our team did really well and we'll be ready for IC4A's."

"We had a lot of people do very well," echoed Herman. "We knew we had a shot to win if everyone ran personal bests, but we had good perfor­mances." 
Other stars for the Irish in­cluded freshman football stand­out Randy Kinder (55m, 200m); senior Mike McWilliams (5,000m); and junior Jeff Hoj­nacki (800m). 
The distance medley relay consisting of Joe Royer, Andrew Burns, Kevin O'Brien and Dan Amitie placed third in the meet. Junior J.R. Meloro finished sixth in the 5,000m, and Notre Dame's John Coyle, James Trautman and Nate Ruder had the fourth, fifth and seventh places in the 3,000m. 
"We did okay, but we didn't perform up to what we're capa­ble," concluded Meskall. "We're going to surprise a lot of people later in the season in the important meets." 
Both teams are looking for­ward to performing in front of the Junior Parents Weekend crowd at Loftus on Saturday against Drake University.

An 'N. for effort, but no 'W' 
ByTIMSHERMAN Sports Writer 
The effort was dramatically improved. 
The result was not. 
The Notre Dame hockey team, despite the fact that the game was nationally televised, came out flat on Friday night against Western Michigan. 
In the CCHA, you cannot do that, especially against a team that is fighting for second place. The result was a 6-0 blanking. 
On Saturday, the Irish stepped up their intensity, yet still lost 4-1. 
Friday, though, set the tone for the weekend. A disputed goal deflated the Irish. 
With the score 1-0 late in the first period, Irish goaltender Greg Louder was run off the crease. Western Michigan's Misha Lapin took advantage of the blatant interference and found the empty net. 
The goal stood and the Irish were never the same. 
The Broncos took advantage of the edge and scored three second period goals. including a shorthanded effort by Brian Gallentine. 
Notre Dame was too sloppy on offense to challenge, and the game ended 6-0. 
On Saturday. the energy level seemed higher. as was the play somewhat. Notre Dame out­shot Western Michigan 26-21. 
"Tonight, the team worked hard," said coach Ric Schafer. "We were down to the end of our roster. but our hard work was a positive." 
"It was a big improvement over Friday, we just didn't get the breaks" commented the lone goal scorer on the week­end, Ben Nelsen. 
With injuries to key forwards such as Brent Lamppa. Jamie Morshead, and Jeff Hasselman, the Irish have trouble generat­ing quality scoring chances. 
Finding themselves down 2-0 after the first period, it looked like the squad would be shut out for the second straight evening. However, Nelsen's power play goal at 19:19 of the second period, gave the Irish some life. 
They could not carry the momentum into the final pe­riod. Western's Darren Mal­oney scored the backbreaking goal midway through the third. Jamal Mayers added another with three minutes left to ac­count for the 4-1 final. 
"We had it close for a while, but it just didn't fall our way," said Nelsen. 
"We just can't afford to make losing worse," said Schafer. "We'll get one (win) when we get one. We'll keep working hard for it."

INDIANAPOLIS 

David Palmer, Alabama's all­purpose threat, wants to nar­row his range of responsibili­ties in the NFL. 
In other words, don't expect him to line up behind center. 
"No, I'll leave that up to the quarterbacks," said the 5-foot­9 receiver, one of 29 juniors eligible for the April 24-25 draft. 
"I just want to catch it and run some reverses. Going into the draft, returning punts and kicks will be my biggest assets, and I think it will help me make it in the league if I can run reverses and catch passes too," said Palmer, among more than 300 of the nation's top players attending the annual NFL scouting combine at the Hoosier Dome.
