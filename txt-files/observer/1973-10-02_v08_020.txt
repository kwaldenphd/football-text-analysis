Philosophy of rules topic of SLC meeting 
Etienne objects to Faccenda draft 

by George Velcich 
and Fred Graver 
Staff Reporters 
The Student Life Council discussed. rules regarding drugs, sexual relations and the implications of the rules philosophy during yesterday's meeting. 
Student Body President Dennis Etienne questioned the wording in the opening paragraph in the Faccenda draft of the rules manual. The rules now say that certain ac­tions by a member of the Notre Dame com­munity could raise the question of "whether the offender wishes to remain a member of this voluntary society, and whether the community wants him or her to remain here." 
Etienne objected to the clause, saying that it disregarded the degree of consequence in the action and implies that anyone breaking these rules will be subject to review by the community. 
Dr. Phillip Faccenda,Vice-President Student Affairs, answered by saying that "this is the cornerstone to the entire policy of the University. Judgment on an action is based on a person's attitude rather than on the act itself." 
He continued by stating that the difference lies in "whether the person doesn't want to be here and simply made a mistake." 
The Council passed a motion to have the Drafting Committee re-word the passage, retaining its basic philosophy. 
The Council then turned to the passage in the rules on marijuana and other drugs. Last week, Dr. Faccenda stated that the Student Affairs office had made a distinction between hard drugs and marijuana. 
The rule presently states: "Although there is some uncertainty about the effects of marijuana, the University does not consider its use acceptable." Dennis Etienne objected on the grounds that he felt the University should not state this because of the ambiguity . . Dr. Faccenda: "We want to help you, whether you want the help or not." 


and vagueness of the University policy. He 
then stated that the rules would be very hard 
to enforce. , 
Dr. Faccenda answered by defining the 

University plans for enforcement, which 
center on "the providing of drugs, and the 
using of drugs." 
The Council then voted to keep the 

paragraph as it stands, maintaining three 
levels of drug use. The first states that all 
providers of any drugs, including marijuana, 
are committing a serious violation. The 
second pertains to using of hard drugs, such 
as hallucinogens and narcotics, which is also 
a serious violation. The third category states 
that the users of marijuana are not com­
mitting a serious violation. 
Dr. Faccenda stated the University plans 

on using "more reasonable means to stop this 
problem" <marijuana usage). 
He continued by saying that "the Univer­

sity says that they have the right to intrude on 
the privacy of the student. We want to help 
you, whether you want the help or not." 
Next, the Council discussed the section in 

the rules pertaining to sexual relations. The 
present version is a long statement of 
University philosophy on human sexuality, 
ending in what could be implied as a 
University rule on sexual conduct. 
After a long discussion, the paragraph was .changed to state, "the University believes 
that sexual union should occur only in 
marriage." 
A motion to delete the entire philosophy was defeated on the grounds that the relaxing of rules would be, in the iong run, detrimental because of peer group pressure to exercise "liberties." 
The SLC will meet again Wednesday at 4:30. 

Prices delay co-ex dining until Oct. 8 
by Denise Crowley Staff Reporter 

The co-exchange dining program for Notre Dame and St. Mary's will begin Oct. 8. The program has been held up this fall because of price differentials and unequal exchanges. 
St. Mary's will receive one hundred tickets for dinner at Notre Dame. These tickets will be distributed to each of the four halls at eight o'clock in the morning. Each hall will receive 25 tickets and they are available on a first-come first-serve basis from the girl at the main desk. Judy Mardoian, head of the co-ex program at St. Mary's, stressed that the girls must be respon­sible in allowing everyone a fair chance for a ticket. 
At Notre Dame, the tickets will be handled on a random rotation basis. There will be two or threehalls receiving the 100 tickets allotted for each night but the specific rotation hasn't been decided yet. The food Service Advisory Board, headed by Mariclare Molidor, is coordinating the exchange at N.D . 
The unequal amount of exchange from each school was one of the reasons for the delay in the exchange. More N.D. students were going to St. Mary's than girls going over to Notre Dame. This has been worked out to a balance of 100. Brother Kieran Ryan, Assistant Vice President of Business Affairs, said that this balance "worked out fairly well in the past. We want to keep .those same guidelines." 
Another reason for the delay was the problem in printing the tickets. St. Mary's tickets still have to be numbered and dated. With these two delays out of the way, the co-ex program will start next Monday. 
Washington Hall hosts Plimpton tonight at 8 
George Plimpton, best known for his do-anything antics, often before nationwide TV audiences and in best selling books, comes to campus tonight at 8p.m. in Washington Hall. 
Plimpton's greatest fame is probably as a result of his pro-football debut, the subject of his book, and later a movie, called Paper Lion. 
He has played tennis with Pancho Gonzales, bridge with Oswald Jacoby, and football with the Baltimore Colts. Plimpton boxed with light heavyweight champion Archie Moore, swung his baseball bat in the major leagues, and played with the New York Philharmonic. 
Currently Plimpton is the editor-in-chief of the Paris Review, an international literary magazine. He is past editor of the Harvard Lampoon. 
His appearance on campus is sponsored by the Student Union Academic Commission. Admission is free.

It was the "most orderly it's. been ever," commented one Student Union official, on the selling of the homecoming package tickets Monday morning. 
In past years, cutting in line and fights breaking out were a com­mon occurance. Several years ago some students went so far as to go up to the top floor of La For­tune, throw rope ladders out the windows on the inside and climb in the Fiesta Lounge to get tickets. 
This year the sale was set up on a first come, first serve basis, that included a sign-up list. At 9:00

Mondale attacks Austria onJewishimmigrationban 
WASHINGTO, (UPI) -The Senate opened its foreign aid debate Monday by voting disapproval of the Austrian government's decision to close 
a  major  transit  camp  for  Jews  
leaving Russia.  
The  amendment  to  the  $1.2  

million foreign aid bill, intro­duced by Sen. Walter Mondale, D-Minn., calls on President Nixon to express to Austria its concern over the closing of a castle used by Jews in their way to Israel. The Austrian government took the action at the request of Arab terrorists who had seized Jewish hostages aboard a train from Russia. 
Mondale said he was dis­turbed that the United States had said nothing to Austria about the action so far, and added: "the closure of this facility is a very serious matter 
I cannot help being imoressed by what this action poses in modern terms to the situation of German Jews in the 19305." 
Mondale said Germany had sealed her borders to Jews who wanted to leave, the United States and other countries did nothing to help them, and the holocaust of Hitler's death camps resulted. 
"I believe that if we rema~ silent now, our silence will be regarded as an endorsement" of the Austrian policy, Mondale said. 
The amendment was criti­cized by Sen. J. William Fulbright, D-Ark., who said it amounted to unwarranted inter­ference in the internal affairs of "a small, friendly country". 
Mondale denied he was meddling and termed his proposal a "minimum state­ment." 
The legislators defeated two amendments offered by Sen. James Aboureszk, D-S.D., to bar the use of aid money in countries that hold political prisoners or to finance police operations in any country. 
They deleted from the bill entirely a plan to promote U.S. exports to poor countries through a cheap loan system.

Student interes'ted in tickets for the Michigan State game should be prepared for a tough battle and high prices.

The Observer. 
Calls to numbers posted on the boards and in the paper brought of~ers as lJigh as twf>nty five a:-~d ~Irty dollars for a pair of MSU tickets on the forty yard line. 
There was some range in offers. Some poor people could offer only ten dollars for such choice seats and are condemned to listening to the game on the radio. The average offer was twenty dollars, but prices should rise as the game approaches and tickets become scarcer. It looks like those

An intensification of curricula, added musical groups and an expanded concert series highlight an attempt by the Notre Dame Music Department to service the musical needs of all the members of the university community. The Observer spoke with Dr. William Cerny, chairman of the music department, about what he termed "an encouraging expansion of musical interests" here on cam­pus. 
Music majors, according to Cerny, will undergo a new, in­tensified curriculum dealing with musical history, theory, per­formance-literature and two types of musical education. A new two­year program geared toward the graduate level has also been established in these five areas. 
"The department also has a new double-degree program", said corny, "which enables a student to

The professorship is being created as the University com­minces its !31st year and as the College of Business Ad­ministration enters its second half century.

Cerny emphasized that the department wishes to serve the whole university. "There is an increased interest in music among the students," said Cerny. "This is shown by the increased enrollment in the introduction to music and piano courses."

A Bad Move 
There's one thing that the people who run an organization that serves a large number of people should always remember--people are very im­pressionable. 
They're not always fair-but they always remember. 
Monday was the day that Student Union announced as the day on which ticket sales for the Homecoming Weekend would go on sale. They announced that tickets for the concert would go on sale in the Fiesta Lounge beginning at 1 p.m. and a package deal containing two dance tickets and two tickets to the Southern Cal game would be made available starting at 7 p.m. 
By 1 p.m., or shortly thereafter, all of the package deal tickets were sold, and a waiting list of 50 people greeted those who had come to stand in line. 
And that's poor management. 

The decision to sell the tickets ahead of the announced time was apparently made because "500 people" had already joined the line by this morning to await the sale of the 240 package deals. 
Logically, it was then reasonable to sell the tickets since any students who joined the line later would only be turned away. 
But business men shouldn't base their decisions solely on logic. Because their customers don't base their impressions of that business solely on logic. 
And it's the customer we're supposedly worried about. The fact is that every student waiting in that line for football and dance tickets got 
in that line fully expecting to wait until 7 
p.m. 
for the tickets to be sold. Whether they arrived at 11 p.m. Sunday or 1 p.m. Monday, they expected to wait until 7 

p.m. 
for the tickets to be sold. So holding off on the sales would not have affected the people in line. 


And every person on this campus who read the article announcing those sales or saw a Student Union poster advertising those sales had atleast the right to get to LaFortune before 7p.m. and wait in line. It's those people who are most affected by the early sales. 
They weren't too happy to arrive at the lounge hours before the announced time of sales and be informed that everything was sold oul Don't be surprised if those people read an article on the 16th of Ocotber announcing the start of sales for an upcoming concert on November 1, and immediately form a line in the Fiesta Lounge expecting to be waited on as soon as these people did. 
That may not be too logical, but it's the logic of people who will never again trust the announcements Student Union makes concerning ticket sales. 
It is indeed unfortunate that Student Union, already suspected by many hopefully mistaken students of playing favorites with all ticket sales, was not more careful with the students' feelingsMonday. 
Remember, S.U., the customer is always right. Let's hope those who felt cheated today come back to be right.

Dissatisfied Customer 
Dear Editor: 
What is the sense in setting up rules if they are not going to be enforced? I am referring to the 

·"rules" concerning the sale of the USC tickets. According to an article in The Observer of October 1 and according to directions posted on campus, "anyone in the Fiesta Lounge before the doors open O.p.m.) will be ejected." Why is it then that when I arrived at 1p.m. (being one of the many people who were stupid enough to follow the rules), not only were all the tickets spoken for, but also a back-up list of fifty names? I, like many other people, would ahave arrived well before 1 p.m. when tickets were still available, but I, like many other people be_lieved that the rules were made for a reason, namely to be adhered to. 
On behalf of all the rightfully irate students, I ask the Student Union for an explanation. 
Sincerely, Kathy Rimar 


Dirty Chess 
Dear Editor: 

This past weekend I participated in your annual "Observer" Chess Tournament. Admittedly, I am a player of limited skills, and therefore am not on the N.D. chess team, but nevertheless I expected to receive treatment equivalent to those of the team. The tournament director showed favoritism in his management of the tourney. Never before have I been engaged in such a haphazardly run tour­nament, i.e. no table numbers and no definite set of rules. The rules were changed seemingly to aid ceratain players and hinder others. The director TWICE in the course of the tourney changed the rule concerning the "grace period" allotted tardy players. This rule was so drastically altered the second time that I was defeated by an opponent who never arrived at the tournament site! 
'fhe lack of participation in the tournament, as compared to previous years, to me reflects the inefficiency of the tournament's management. I feel that a com­petent director would increase both the participation and the validity of future tournaments. 
Respectfully, Mark J. Caminite 


The Screechers 

Dear Editor: 
Here we sit at 1:42 a.m., being kept awake by a volley of various pre-historic screeches. And that's putting it mildly. It seems that somebody forgot to feed or change the diapers of the inhabiants of the Dillon Day (and apparently Night) Camp. 
Last night, it was funny at first. But then 2:30 a.m. rolled around and the children were still at it. Somehow, it's lost its novelty. Tonight it looks like they may break their record. 

I guess that when we walk into Emil T. 's chem quiz tomorrow and explain our predicament, he'll be more than happy to hear our tale, and tell us to forget the quiz and go get some sleep. 
But if Dillon hears about that, they'll probably scream during the day, too. We have but one com­ment for the Dillon pre-schoolers, and we think they'll understand what we're driving at. Goo-goo, ga­ga. 
Sleeplessly,

Celebration of Work 
Editor: 

According to an article con­cerning the 1974-75 academic calendars which appears in today's Observer, the observance of the Roman Church's holy days during the coming academic year may necessitate the scheduling of Saturday classes. The logic of this proposal escapes me. If we take seriously Father Burtchaell's suggestion , that education is a moral as well as an intellectual adventure, and if, as such, it contributes to our fulfillment as Christian human beings, I don't see why education should be suspended on days when some of us choose to celebrate our brotherhood with the Lord. While I do not pretend to know much about the Roman Church's canons. I believe that the prohibition of "servile work" on these days was designed to alleviate the kind of drudgery which inhibits the celebration of our humanity in Jesus, not the kind of ennobling work which makes us men, and gives meaning to our celebration._ 
Even if we consider the academic life to be servile work, to defer classes to Saturday can only make our observance of holy days hollow: we will observe the letter of the law, at the expense of the spirit. 
Lest it be thought that I am being too idealistic about this, I have practical reasons for this mild protest. My (Catholic) Church has no "holy days of obligation," our feasts fall on different days, and since my kids go to public school they will not behome on the Roman holy days anyway. Rather than being obliged to celebrate somebody else's feasts by rattling around in an empty house and looking forward to an extra classroom day·, I'd rather 
' praise God with my work on the holy day' and with my family on the weekend. Sincerely, Bob Kerby

hit -and -run 


damage 

Hit-and-run accidents in Notre Dame and St. Mary's parking lots this year have caused considerable amount of property damage. During the first month of this semester six hit-and-runs have been reported to the securitydepartments. 
SMC Security Director , Anthony Kovatch, urges students who have hit a parked car to leave their name and address. Insurance will take care of the damage. Kovatch cited an example which occured a few days ago. "A red Fire bird was parked in the lot. Someone pulled out and put a big dent in the car and left without leaving their name and address." N.D. Security Director, Arthur J. Pears, reported one hit-and-run on the third of September totalling $100 worth of damage. Kovatch sees no reason for these hit-and-run ac­cidents since all registered cars are listed with insurance. 
SMC Security also asks students to lock their cars as a safety precaution. Students sh(JUJd also co-operate in the proper parking of guest cars.

Fine Arts senior exhibits design work lor Chrysler 
by Janet Denefe Staff Reporter 
Sal Graziano, a senior Fine Arts major, is currently exhibiting his design work inO'ShaughnessyHall. Last summer Graziano wor~ed ic Chrysler's Design Department"and it is these work designs now on display. 
Graziano was one of seven designing students throughout the country that was selected to work for Chrysler. Each was given a specific project to develop during the summer, and Graziano's job was to design a four-passenger luxury car. The car had to be turban-powered and fit within certain limitations such as ground clearance and bumper height, and the creative aspects were up to each student. 
His initial concern was with proportion. He began working with box-like shapes and produced only rough sketches in the beginning, but the exhibit clearly shows that Sal resolved the problem of proportion and became more involved with originality. The exhibit traces his progress from very basic drawings to the finished product. 
There are also several-drawings of the car's interior: the dash­board, the steering wheel, cushioned seats, etc. Graziano found that he enjoyed working in interior design almost more than exterior because he could work with both hard and soft textures. 
Graziano and the other students were continuously given professional guidance and advice by interior and exterior designers atChrysler. Thus, as well as ­
learning the progression of ideas, they learned techniques. 
Any junior interested in automotive design who would like to have the same opportunity that Graziano had should contact Professor Frederick Beckman, the director of Industrial Design.

When she first came to the United States, she couldn't see the differences among varied areas. "It's too big. Houses and towns are the same all over the country.

Watergate defendants 'punished enough' 
WASHINGTON (UPI) -The lawyer for four of the Water­gate burglars said Monday his clients "weren't ordered to kill anybody" but yet are being treated discourteously by the office of Special Prosecutor Archibald Cox. 
The lawyer, Daniel E. Schultz, also said the families of the four men are strapped for money ar.d are launching a public appeal for defense funds, beginning with a benefit dinner Thursday night in Miami. 
Schultz said his clients­Bernard L. Barker, Frank A. Sturgis, Virgilio R. Gonzalez and Eugenio R. Martinez-have been "punished enough" for their part in the Watergate bugging and yet more trouble may lie ahead. 
He said he had gotten indications that Barker and Martinez would be indicted by a federal grand jury for the 1971 break-in at the office of Dr. Lewis J. Fielding, Daniel Ellsberg's psychiatrist, whereas the leader of the team, Watergate conspirator E. How­ard Hunt Jr., would not be. 
"You ask yourself why are they intent on indicting the men further and at the same time justify not indicting Hunt," Schultz said in a subsequent interview with UPI. "Watergate and the Fielding office are out of the same cloth. 
"They (Cox's office) have constantly treated them dis­courteously. They have shown no sympathy or empathy. 
"They weren't ordered to kill anybody ...They were ap­proached on a basis of where they were asked to get information on a 'traitor."' 
Neither Barker, Martinez nor Hunt were among the four men indicted Sept. 4 by a county grand jury in Los Angeles for the Fielding burglary. Cox's office is known to be investigat­ing the incident and to be considering federal charges. 
Schultz's clients-who have come to be known collectively as "The Cubans" in the Watergate case-were hired by Hunt to carry out the Water­

Group threatens renewal of 
WRBR license 
by Gary Allietta Staff Reporter 

People for Progress in Radio, a group of concerned local listeners, hs.ve filed a petition with the FCC to deny the renewal of radio station WRBR's broadcasting license. 
'<. Steve Raymond, 25, spokesman for the group, sald the move was in response to the format change away from progressive rock which WRBR enacted last March. Ed Welch,26, is the group's at­torney. He said that after he filed the petition on July 2, Booth Broadcasting of Detroit, station owner, had until July 22 to file a s­response. Booth obtained several extensions but the FCC has now ruled that they must file by Oc­tober 15. 
Among points on the petition are allegations that WRBR failed to meet community needs and that 
" station logs were falsified. WeJch also noted that no minority em­ployees were used at the station although the entire staff has been replaced twice. 
Both Raymond, who owns Pandora's Books, and Welch pointed out that Booth cited an unprofitable situation as a reason for the change. However, Welch has a balance sheet from 1970-73, the period during which the old format was used, along with statements from station em­ployees, showing that the progressive rock was more profitable. Welch also noted instances of fraud and false representation under the station's new arrangement. 
Both men asked for community support in the matter. In Toledo, courts ruled in favor of the listeners in a similar situation after a group turned in a petition with many thousand signatures. Welch feels that with a similar backing PPR could also be suc­cessful. 
Raymond added that anyone who wishes to help in any way, ex­pecially by signing or circulating petitions, should stop in or call

community. If the school can collect 40,000 Campbell soup can labels before November 25, Campbell's will donate the projector. 
The children are requesting the assistance of all St. Mary's and Notre Dame students, faculty and administration members with their deadline. All the Holy Cross students are collecting labels but it is unlikely they can save enough on their own. They have already gathered 4,000 labels. If just each off-campus student saved 20 labels between now and November 25, the children could have their projector. 
There are 300 children in the primary department and 550 in the school. The primary department is comprised of grades one through 
four. The school has some films and the South Bend Public Library has many films which could be used by the children at no charge, but a projector is often not available to the lower grades. Rising education costs prohibit purchasing a projector. Labels can be dropped off in the Notre Dame Lawyer office in the basement of the law school at any time during the day between now and November 25. The children would appreciate the help.
