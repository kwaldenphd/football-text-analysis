The Notre Dame Literary Festival brought in a writer more familiar with the University than most when organizers chose Tasha Alexander as one of the event's headlinnrs. 
Alexander, who spoke Tuesday night, graduated from Notre Dame in 1992 and is the daugh­ter of two Notre Dame philoso­phy professors. Writing under a pseudonym -her real name is Tasha Tyska -she is the author of the Victorian era thriller, "And Only to Deceive" (2005). 
A first time author, Alexander said she was "incredibly lucky" to get her book published.

INSIDE COLUMN 


Please note the headshot 
Hello there. As you turned to the inside page of the The Observer, I bet you couldn't help but notice that I have a picture that goes along with my article. It's okay to be impressed. As you read this 
article, I would suggest you eon­stantly reference my picture with the corner of your eye to drive home the points I am making. 
It's hard to get a 

picture to go Adam Fairholm along with your article. Joey 
Falco, Scott Cartoonist 
Wagner and Pat Leonard all have pictures with their articles. Their pictures are notably the best I've seen by the way. So Joey, Scott, or Pat, if you are reading this, yours are notably the best I've seen. 
But anyways, you've got to go down to The Observer office and they have to take a picture of you. 
You've got to have a blank expres­sion that says, "I mean business" and is not inappropriate for re-use. Example: your picture has to work with not only articles like "You Killed My Grandma" or "I Love My Grandma," but also articles like "Your Grandma Killed Me" or "''ve Got AIDS." 
Which brings me to my next point. 
Whatever happened to that guy who had a unicycle on campus? Did he graduate or something? He proba­bly graduated. 
When you have a picture with your article, there is an aura around your article. A lot of the articles in The Observer don't have pictures, and therefore many don't have auras. Example: If you've got some article in Scene reviewing "Grand Burglary Larceny Rape Booger Challenge Assault 4" for PS2 or PSP or you know, whatever, then I am going to take you a lot more seriously if I can see how serious you are in your pic­ture. 
Even if I don't play video games I am going to sit there and consider your opinion and look at your pic­ture. I will say to your picture, "I have listened to what you have to say about 'Grand Burglary Larceny Rape Booger Challenge Assault 4' and I will consider purchasing this item because I see you are serious about this." 
Or if you are doing a news story, I can see you are serious about the news. News reporters, I am giving you some advice. The advice is don't smile in your picture, because I want someone serious giving me the news. That way I could stop you in the _hall­way and say, "Thanks for being seri­ous about that." Or not. You know, whatever. 
Many great men in history have had pictures that go along with their articles-or would have, had they gone to Notre Dame and worked for The Observer. I think I'm out of space. That's one of the downsides of having a picture to go along with your article. You run out of spa

nasy targnl'i by pnopln who are not IL'i reputable IL'i they should bn," she said. 
Nash said the complaints include reporl'i of drivnrs stufl'­ing unsali1 numbers of passen­gers in eabs and eharging stu­dnnl'i excessive and not agreed­upon fares, as well as eompa­nins refusing to send studenl'> a cab latn at night. 
"I certainly sympathize with pt1oplt1 who want to get from a nightclub to home or campus," she said. "That's the sort of thing I want to work very hard !fori to <Teate a better environ­ment." 
South Bend licenses taxis, so the city can take away the liennses of drivers who violate regulations. Na'ih said she plans to develop amendments to the city ordinance governing cab companies and to improve enforcement of the existing ordinanee. 
'Tm worrind about thn quality of the taxi service lstud<ml'i are! rncniving," Nash said. 'Tm try­ing to tighten enforcmnent so studnnLr.; arnn't taknn advantage of or madn to filnl unsafe." 
Whiln Nash said it is "inappro­priatn" for a cab company to rllf'usn s11rvicn httn at night. cab company r11presentatives say it is not always possible to send customers a cab in a timely manner on busy weekend nighL'i. Some companies recom­rnnnd that callers contact anoth­er company. while others expect callers to wait for an eventual ridn. 
"If wn can't get !the cus­tonwrsl in a reasonable time. like :m minutes ... we tdl them we don't have cabs available," said Walter .Jones. owner of ABC Cab. "Sometimes lcus­tom<1rsl don't even get a cab from any company in town." 
no-show eustomnr is eallod, his 
time and gas is wasted -a fac­
tor that drivos up rams. 
Senior Sarah Gelwieks said 
she thinks cabs are convenient. 
but she ha'i spnnt time on many 
nights waiting for a cab to 
arrive. 

"It takes forever," she said. "Either there [arel a lot of peo­ple trying to get a eab and not nnough leabsl or you call a cab and someone else takes it." 
In any case, the wait is typi­cally longer than the company predicL'l, Gelwieks said. 
"They usually tell you it will be there in 20 minutes, and it gets there after 40 minutes," she said. 
When a driver is sent to pick up passengers, the cab often becomes jam-packed with stu­dents eager to reach their desti­nation. The law says each pas­senger must have a seatbelt, but drivers arc motivated to collect the fares of additional passen­gers, while passengers often want to save money with group discount rates and avoid sepa­rating from their group of friends. 
Sophomore Jimmy Newman ha'> sharnd numorous cab rides with morn passengers than the law would allow, a situation he said was initiatod by the cabs' drivers. 
"They would just keep pack­ing people in and say an excuse, that it's the last cab of the night," he said. "They'd try to pack tons of people in with no soatbelt.s." 
Jones said it is not uncommon to find small cabs brimming with eight or nine studenl'>. 
"That's dangerous," he said. "If parents knew that, they'd have a hoart attack. If insurance companios knew. they'd have a he.art attack ~nd then they'd nuse the rates. 
When asked how he address­es city regulations like the seat­belt rule, Jones said he can only encourage his drivers not to said. The company's flag drop, or rate to get into the eab. is $2 and the per mile rate is $2. When five or more passengers ride by van, they can travel up to three miles for $3 per stu­dent. 
Checker City Cab ha<; a $7 per party minimum. Like ABC Cab. Cheeker City Cab charges a $2 flag drop. followed by $1.40 per mile, Jan said. A $1 gas sur­charge is also added to the party's meter. 
These prices are not always understood by students. .Junior Kate Moran said she expects to pay a set fare for short rides. 
"Sometimes I think prices can be completely arbitrary," she said. "But normally it's the stan­dard $2." 
Each company has speeial rates for popular destinations like South Bend Airport. 
"I think the economics of cabs is not understood by students," Jones said. 
.Jones also noted that when an occasional student vomits in a cab. the company is forced to pay an expensive bill to clean the cab's interior. 
"It's not unreasonable to expect to make enough money to clean it up," he said. 
While Nash expressed con­cern about cab companies' com­pliance with city regulations. United Cab driver Bob I Ioftinan said companies are aware that they must follow the rules. 
'The city does keep checking on taxi companies to see how they're operating," he said. 
He admitted that some drivers do allow students to "load up" on Friday or Saturday nights, but said the decision is left to students. 
"Very, very seldom do we have any problems," HotTman said. "!The studenlr.;] are a very good bunch of people to work with."

that cover a wide spectrum of stu­dent life issues. If they deliver on their word, results will be t.an!-,rible come fall. 
Andrichik said he is confident new items will be addod to Grab­and-Go when students arrive on eampus in August. Three or four additional food choices will be selected bar.;ed on a student survey to be conducted this semester, he said. 
Possible additions include ramen noodles, popcorn and soups, Andrichik said. 
And thanks to a $15 increa'le in the student activities fee that will take effect next year, three national newspapers will be available daily for free at different poinl'l around campus. The College Readership Program was piloted at Notre Dame last year and won positiw1 feedbaek from student.<; -prompting student government to pursue implement­ing the program permanently. 
But concerns have been raised regarding the number of newspa­pers that will actually be available each day -estimates hover around 2,000 -since the money allotted for the program will not be enough for each student to get a newspapnr. 
To counter this. Shappell said she wants to create a recycling system that would encourage students to return their papers to a bin, so that several student.<; can mad the same copy. 
"But if the !College Headershipl Program takes on·. we're hoping to seek funding from other resources" to purcha<;e more papers and not have to rely on recycling. Shappell said. 
like her predecessor, current stu­dent body president Dave Baron, Shappell said her administration plans to work tirelessly at improv­ing community relations -starting as early as the Feb. 27 meeting of the South Bend Common Council. There, six student speakers will address the Council to "display that we want to take an aetive part in city government," Shappoll said. 

"We want to explain tho initia­tivos we're taking to improve com­munity relations," she said. "Spm:ifieally our issues with the nnw ldisordorly house) ordinan<:e Imeant to curb student partying! ... and how we believe that with the first oll'ense evietion, the punishment doesn't always fit the erimn." 
Shappell and Andriehik alr.;o want to enlist the help of' the Notre Dame Law School for legal consultation regarding the ordinanee. 
Student.r.; ean also expect Student Senate committee meetings to become more visible, since Shappoll wants to relocate some meetings to more public locations like rnsidence halls and academic buildings. 
''I'm proud of the strides Dave and I have made this year," Shappell said. "But as far a<; the stu­dent apathy question goes. that is a constant battle for studenl<; to feel like student government is accessi­ble and working f(lr their day to day needs." 
Shappell said having committee meetings "on location" provides "a more personal c:onneetion for stu­denl'l and student government." 
Shappell and Andriehik also said they will t.<tilor thnir goals to fit any issues that arise following University Pn1sident Father John Jenkins' recent addresses on aca­demic freedom and the University's Catholic eharader. 
"Jenkins will bo visiting !Student! Senate in a month, but we don't know how much !the issue! will earry over from this administration to the next," Shappell said. 
But Shappell hopos to "eontinue to solicit student opinion" on aea­demic freedom fL'i long as the dia­logue and debate persists on cam­pus. 
Shappell and Andriehik sneured 
51.78 percent of the vote in Monday's eledion. just enough to avoid a run-off eleetion.

The problem arises because companins sometimes receive hundred of calls in a fi1w hours, said .Jan, a Checker City Cab dispatcher who dedinnd to give hnr hL'it name. 
Given the concentrated dmnand for cabs, Jan -said a lengthy wait is sometimes unavoidable. Though this may bn inmnvenient. she doseribed a call li1r a eab ar.; a verbal agree­mnnt that is violated if a prospeetive par.;senger calls rival companies to see whieh cab arrives most quickly. 
"When you order a cab, you'rn suppos11d to be rnady filr how11vnr long it takes," Jan said. "I work filr a cab company. and I have waitnd two hours for a cab." 
.lorws said students do not understand how frustrating it is to <:ab eompanios whnn tho stu­c!Pnts call rnultipln eornpanies and tak<l a ride from whiehnvor drivor shows up first. When a cab drivPr "gpts a void." as a overload their cabs. 
"You don't have full control because you're not in the cab with them,'' .Jones said. 
Jan, who formerly worked as a driver, attested to the difliculty of turning down an extra stu­dent on a cold South Bend night. 
"When I was driving, we had kids begging, 'Please let our friend in."' she said. "It's hard to turn down a really tiny girl, who could just share a seat, and make her stand out in the cold because her friends are already in the cab." 
The subject of cab fares is also marknd by miseommunica­tion between studenlr.; and cab companies. While many stu­dents expect to pay $2 for a short trip, employees of various eab eompanies strossnd that $2 is usually a llag drop priee eom­pounded by a metnr rate per milo.

of the skits in "The Vagina Monologues." 
"How do they heal? Whether we like it or not, it's by writing plays [like 'The Vagina Monologues'] ... Kids write these plays," Nordstrom said. 
Nordstrom requires students in her anthropology classes to write ethnographies of them­selves, some of which have dealt with campus rapes perpe­trated by both males and females. She said she has had more males than "you would expect" come to talk to her in her office about being sexually violated. 
"It really is an unspoken real­ity," Nordstrom said. 
Nordstrom was not the only panelist who brought personal experience to the table. Father Paulinus Odozor, an associate professor of theology, was born and raised in Nigeria -a back­ground that made him aware of the prevalence of crimes against women. 
"I .can relate to some of the issues [Nordstrom] was talking about," Odozor said. "I saw the kinds of atrocities people com­mit in wars." 
But Odozor differed from Nordstrom in his opinion of the play. One of the things he found problematic stemmed from what he saw as the agenda of the play, reflected in the subti­tle of the official script, which states the play's involvement in the worldwide V-Day Campaign -a movement that works to end violence against women. 
Campaigns, Odozor said, are organized courses of political action meant to convert peo­ple's hearts and minds. In the case of "The Vagina Monologues," Odozor said he was concerned with the values it presented, though he sup­ported its anti-violence goals.

After the pan­elists were fin­ished, they field­ed emotional questions and comments about the "Mono­logues," rape and gender rela­tions at Notre Dame from stu­dents and faculty members in the crowd.

she later settled on using her son's first name, Alexander, as her new last name. 
Alexander said she had wanted to write since childhood but always had found excuses not to get started. 
"I always had this idea that you need a big uninterrupted block of time [to write a book]," she said. 
After staying home to raise her first child, Alexander changed her mind and told herself, "If it stinks, well at least I know I tried." 
With her newfound motivation, Alexander reflected on her per­sonal interests, such as historical fiction, London, Paris and ancient art. The result was a story about art forgeries. 
Alexander created a young, widowed woman as a main char­acter with the intention of reusing the young character in a series of novels. Furthermore, a widowed woman in 1890s England would have the freedom of movement that an unmarried or married woman would not have had at that time, Alexander said. 

When she began as an author, she had "a barely serviceable computer and a three and-a-half year old in the room," she said. 
Her busy schedule actually served to motivate her as she wrote, Alexander said. 
"It is a lot easier to procrasti­nate if you have a big block of time," she said. 
And the motivation led to enjoy­ment as she progressed through the novel. 
"If you are not having fun writ­ing the book, than you have to change something," she said. "You can't control and agent or a publisher, but you can change your book." 
Alexander said it was very sat­isfying to know a large company was taking her small book very seriously. 
After talking about the anxious­ness of waiting a year and a half, Alexander told the audience about the joy she received when she finally got the first published copy in the mail. 
"I had a hard time believing that it was real," she said.

Monologues'], sex is little more than genital activity, [there is glorified] sex with adults, [and] sex is something we should feel free to do whenever and with whoever one wants to," he said. "This play should not be viewed as a presumption-less produc­tion." 
Odozor discussed the view of sexuality in the eyes of the Catholic Church, and said Catholics have a responsibility viewed the play as a two-way street that opened up dialogue. 
"I would like to challenge the views of the play to promote the ideal of sexuality as a self­giving love, but then the play challenges me to think about how we get there from where we are," Doak said. 
Doak also said that people don't "just one day spring up as sexual adults," but instead internalize sexual feelings even 
sided propaganda," Odozar said, "cannot go unchallenged in a Catholic university." 
Theology professor Mary Doak also brought experience and a different perspective to the panel. 
"There are five girls in my family ... [so] I always thought the statistics [on sexual vio­lence] must be skewed." Doak said, referring to statistics that about one in three women nationwide is a victim of rape or sexual abuse. 
But after receiving tearful phone calls from some of her sisters about sexual violence perpetrated against them, Doak said she has since realized the statistics were accurate. 
As a Catholic theologian, Doak said she agreed with Odozor that sexuality is a gift from God. But she also said she the first time Tuesday, said after the performance and before the panel he was "not too surprised" by the content, but was "really struck by the quality of the acting." 
"I wanted to see it as an aca­demic event," said Poorman, who said he attended the play on his own accord. "It seemed to go pretty well [in the DeBartolo classroom setting]." 
He said he was looking for­ward to the second half of Tuesday's event -the panel discussion. 
Another panel discussion will take place tonight at 9:15 p.m. in 102 DeBartolo following the third and fmal 7 p.m. showing of this year's "The Vagina Monologues."

Streets svvell as citizens re111e111ber dead-leader 
Demonstrations come year after assassination 
Associated Press 
BEIRUT -It was Hafik Hariri's day in Beirut. Men with children on their shoulders, women waving flags and even the elderly in wheelchairs ral­lied to remember the assassinat­ed former prime minister credit­ed with rebuilding and freeing Lebanon. 
Hundreds of thousands of peo­ple -unofficial police estimates put the figure at about 800,000 and organizers at over 1 million -thronged the Lebanese capi­tal in a show of unity reminis­cent of the days after Hariri's bombing death a year ago.

down. 
"Haven't you had enough, Bashar?" read one placard, referring to Syrian President Bashar Assad, whose government many blame for Hariri's killing. In a play on words, another placard read in English: "Assadsin." 
Demonstrators came from across the country, carrying red and white Lebanese flags and pictures of the slain former pre­mier. "United, thanks to you," read one banner held by a white-haired woman. 
Those who packed downtown Martyrs' Square and went to Hariri's nearby grave included women in Islamic robes and headscarves, elderly leaning on canes, families with babies and young women in tight jeans and designer sunglasses. 
"I wanted to be here at what­ever cost to show that we are still united and will 
born," Samia Baroudy, a 52­year-old Christian, said as she clutched a Lebanese flag. 
The throng fell silent at 12:55 
p.m. -the time a huge truck bomb -exploded on a down­town street as Hariri's motor­cade drove by a y~r ago, killing him and 20 others. A horn blew three times to symbolize the instant the bomb went on·. Then the crowd roared with shouts of "Syria out." 
Demonstrators repeatedly shouted the name of Hariri's son and political heir, Saad. 
"We tell them (the Syrians) ... remove the symbol of your sup­pression of Lebanon and its peo­ple because the people of Lebanon will not compromise," Saad Ilariri said, referring to Lahoud. The crowd responded with chants of "with souls, with blood we redeem you, Saad!" 

Politicians who rarely leave their homes for fear of assassi­nation showed up to rally the crowds. But in contrast to anti­Syrian protests a year ago, they spoke from behind a bullet­resistant glass panel and then left quickly. 
"There can be no stability and no freedom while the symbol of subservience to the Syrian regime remains in Baabda," Druse leader Walid Jumblatt told the crowd, referring to the presidential palace. Of Lahoud, he said: "The ter­

"I think it's everyone's view that the presidency should be something that looks to the future of Lebanon, not to its past," she said in an interview with the Lebanese Broadcasting Corp. satellite channel. 
Buses carried people from the country's remote north, south and east, mainly Sunni Muslims, Christians and Druse. Thousands of troops and police, backed by armored vehicles, provided security and schools were closed for the day. Businesses also shut their doors.

Opponents of Syria are a major­ity in government and Parliament, but lack the two­thirds majority needed to force out Lahoud. 
In a statement, President Bush said "Lebanon has continued to make progress in the year since Mr. Hariri's murder, thanks to the foundation of 

freedom he laid and the deter­mination of the Lebanese peo­ple." 
Neither Lahoud nor Syria had any immediate reaction to the gathering. Syria has .denied any role in J-lariri's killing or the later bombings, and has stalled on cooperation in the U.N. inquiry into Hariri's death. 
Syria's troops withdrew from Lebanon in April under interna­tional pressure, and the U.N. probe into Hariri's slaying already has implicated top Syrian and allied Lebanese security ofticials in his death. 
Three top Lebanese generals close to Lahoud have been arrested in connection with the slaying. 
IRAQ 
British flag burned in rage 
Protest follows video depicting soldiers beating and kicking Iraqi youth 
Associated Press 
BASRA -More than 1,000 protesters burned a British flag Tuesday and the regional administration in Iraq's main southern province severed all ties with British authorities over video footage showing British soldiers allegedly beating and kicking Iraqi youths. 
In London, the British Defense Ministry announced the arrest of two more people in connection with the images. Another person ­apparently the man who shot the video -was arrested Monday. 
Protesters, many of them supporters of radical Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr, marched on the British Consulate in Basra, where they burned a British flag and shouted slogans against the alleged abuse of the youths during a riot Jan. 10, 2004, in the southern city of Amarah. 
Protesters held banners reading "No, no to Tony Blair" and "Try the British soldiers involved in this aggression." 
With outrage over the video mounting, the governing council for Basra province, which includes Iraq's huge southern oil fields, announced it was cutting all ties with British military and civilian operations in the area, head­quarters of Britain's more than 8,000-member military contingent in Iraq. 
The Basra police chief, Maj. Gen. Hassan Suwadi, said Iraqi security forces would cease joint patrols with the Br.itish military in the province to protest the alleged abuse. "We condemn the abuse of the British forces and demand the British gov­ernment to adopt legal proce­dures as soon as possible to punish its soldiers who car­ried out the abuse," Suwadi told The Associated Press. 
Elsewhere, gunmen killed 11 Shiite farmers north of Baghdad, including eight members of one family, offi­cials said. A U.S. Marine was killed and six coalition per­sonnel were wounded in two attacks in Baghdad. 
A homemade bomb explod­ed near a Baghdad liquor shop on Wednesday, killing three people and wounding two, police said. The motive for the attack was unclear, but stores selling alcohol have been targeted before by reli­gious extremists. 
In Amarah, about 100 miles north of Basra, two Iraqis who claimed to have been beaten on the video _ Bassem Shaker and Tariq Abdul­Razzak -told reporters they would seek compensation from Britain, which occupied Iraq for decades after the country was established fol­lowing World War I. 
The beatings allegedly occurred during a violent protest in Amarah by hun­dreds of people demanding jobs. Six people were killed and 11 injured, according to reports at the time. 
"I was one of 250 unem­ployed people demonstrating in the street in 2004, but when we reached the gover­nor's office we were sur­prised by the presence of the British forces," Shaker said. "We started throwing stones at them because we believed that they were behind all our misery." 
Shaker said British troops "were boating us with fists and batons and were kicking us'"'before taking the prison­ers to a British base "where they also beat us and fright­ened us with dogs before releasing us before sunset." 
He said he didn't report the treatment because he did not believe any officials would deal with their complaints. 
"But when we saw this tape and the amount of anger it caused inside and outside Iraq, we decided to come today ... to sue the British forces and compensate us," he said. "Those troops humili­
ated  us  and  violated  our  
rights to demand jobs."  
Helations  between  the  

British and the Shiite-domi­nated provincial administra­tion have been strained in recent weeks after an uptick in attacks on British troops and moves by the British to crack down on Shiite militias that have infiltrated the police and security services. 
Last month, British troops arrested four police officers, alleging they were involved in militia and criminal activities. Basra authorities had threat­ened to suspend contacts with the British over the crack­down well before the video was first reported in London's News of the World.

Atnerican Dada exhibit to open 
National Gallery of Art will host conceptual art form for first time 
for sexual harassment 
Associated Press 
WASIIINGTON -Marcel Duchamp's version of the Mona Usa added a mustache and goatee to the Da Vmci original. Man Ray exhibited a flatiron with a row of tacks glued to the bottom. 
Their work was typical of the art-as-rebellion movement they called Dada. 
A ehallenge to both artistic and political establishments of the early 20th eentury, Dada flourished in New York as well as western Europe. 
More than 450 I>ada works are getting their first big Ameriean exhibit Sunday at the National Gallery of Art. 
Dada can mean various things in various languages: "yes, yes" in Russian and Romanian, a hobby horse in French, baby talk for "daddy" in English. The name seems to have been chosen to m£~an notlling in particular. 
Dada's first publicist, Romanian­French poet Tristan Tzara, gave a formula for writing a Dadaist poem: Choose a newspaper story or the right length, cut it up word by word, shake the word'i in a bag, take them out one by one and arrange them in the order they emerge. 
I>ada wa.<> born in the slaughter of World War I, and it did have a ba.<>ic motivation: fierce and bitter contempt of the old men who sent young men to kill one another for principles that had little or no meaning to artists. Dadaists said traditional art bore mueh of the blame for the war, and they did their best to subvert it. 
Duehamp, the most prominent of the Dadaists in New York, made both political and artistic points.

both sides to a "peace without vie­tory." But the German High Command was prepari.ng an announcement of intensified sub­marine war. That made it almost inevitable that the United States would join the war on the side of the western allies. 
That night Duchamp, with American artist John Sloan and four friends, climbed the Washington Areh at the foot of Fifth Avenue, a Greenwich Village lanamark. They took a picnic lunch, several bottles of wine, some red, white and blue balloons and a proclamation. 
After drinking a certain amount of the wine and fixing the balloons

al skills as cause. 
Lyle's attorney, Scott Ohara Cummings, said many of the sexu­al vulgarities had nothing to do with the show. IIe said one writer drew a vagina during the meet­ings. 
"That's an offensive thing that shouldn't be in the workplace," Cummings said. 
Warner Bros. acknowledges that some, but not all, of the sexually explicit talk Lyle alleges did take place, but feels the comments were a vital part of the creative process. 
Levin said Lyle had been warned when she was hired that explicit discussions were part of develop­ing the sexually charged NBC com­edy about six friends in New York. 
Lyle alleged she was offended by repeated references to the actors' sex lives and to the writers' own sexual exploits. She also grew tired, she charged, of repeated profanity, talk about women's breasts and even simulated mas­turbation allegedly performed dur­ing seript meetings. 
In making the earlier ruling, a state appeal<; eourt said the writ­ers' creative process was protected speech, but that Lyle also has a right to try to prove that the vul­garities strayed beyond that ere­ative process and perhaps violated workplaee harassment rules. 
The Supreme Court has to rule within 90 days. 
"Fountain" and the version of the Mona Lisa are both in the National Gallery show. 
It's as if the Dadaists anticipated a quote that the Andy Warhol Foundation attributes to its founder: "Art is what you can get away with." 
The exhibit includes work by Duchamp, Man Ray, Francis Picabia, Max Ernst, Hans Arp, Paul Klee and others who became famous for their work among the Dadaists and in other styles. They frequented a kind of salon in the ample apartment of Walter and Louise Arensberg, just off Central Park West. The couple kept a col­lection of modern art, now in the

Cheney's cotnpanion suffers heart attack 
Critics call for vice president to speak on incident 
Associated Press 
COHPUS CIIHISTl, Texas -Thn 78-year-old lawyer wounded by Vice President Diek Cheney in a hunting accident suffered a mild heart attaek Tuesday after a shot­gun pnllet in his chest trav­eled to his heart, hospital offi­cials said. 
Harry Whittington was immediately moved back to the intensive care unit and will be watched for a week to make sure more of the metal pellets do not reach other vital organs. He was reported in stabln eondition. 
Whittington suffered a "silnnt heart attack" obstructed blood flow, but without the classic heart­attack symptoms of pain and pressure, according to doc­
tors  at  Christus  Spohn  
Hospital  Corpus  Christi­ 
Memorial.  

The doctors said they deeid­ed to treat the situation con­servatively and leave the pel­let alonH rather than operate to rmnove it. Thny said they are highly optimistic Whittington will recover and livn a healthy life with the pellet in him. 
Asked whether the pellet could move farther into his hoart and becomn fatal, hos­pital officials said that was a hypothntical question they eould not answer.

using 7 1/2 shot from a 28-gauge shotgun. Shotgun pellets are typically made of steel or lead; the pellets in 7 1/2 shot are just under a tenth of an inch in diameter. 
Cheney watched the news conference where doctors described Whittington's com­plications. Then the vice pres­ident called him, wished him well and asked if there was anything that he needed. 
"The vice president said that he stood ready to assist. Mr. Whittington's spirits were good, but obviously his situa­tion deserves the careful monitoring that his doctors are providing," the vice presi­dent's office said in a state­ment. 
Cheney, an experienced hunter, has not spoken pub­licly about the accident, which took plaee Saturday night while the vice president was aiming for a quail. Critics of the Bush administration called for more answers from Cheney himself. 
Whittington has said through hospital officials that he does not want to comment on the shooting. A young man at Whittington's Austin home who identified himself as his grandson said Tuesday he did not have time to talk to a reporter and closed the door. 
The furor over the accident and the White House delay in making it public are "part of the secretive nature of this administration," said Senate 

Democratic Leader Harry Heid of Nevada. "I think it's time the American people heard from the vice presi­dent." 
Before hospital officials announced details of Whittington's condition, the hunting accident had pro­duced a raft of Cheney jokes on late-night television. 
"l think Cheney is starting to Jose it," Jay Leno said. "After he shot the guy he screamed, 'Anyone else want to call domestic wiretapping illegal?!'" 
On Tuesday morning, the White House spokesman briefly joined in the merri­ment, joking that the orange school colors of the visiting University of Texas champi­onship football team should not be mistaken for hunters' safety gear. 
"The orange that they're wearing is not because they're concerned that the vice president may be there," press secretary Scott McClellan said. "That's why I'm wearing it." 
Hospital officials said they knew that Whittington had some birdshot near his heart and that there was a chance it could move closer since scar tissue had not had time to harden and hold the pellet in place. 
After Whittington developed 
an irregular 
heartbeat, doc­
administrator at 
the hospital. 

The shot was either touch­ing or embedded in the heart muscle near the top cham­bers, called the atria, officials said. Two things resulted: 
+ 
It caused inflammation that pushed on the heart in a way to temporarily block blood flow, what the doctors called a "silent heart attack." This is not a traditional heart attack where an artery is blocked. They said Whittington's arteries, in fact, were healthy.

+ 
It irritated the atria, caused an irregular heartbeat known as atrial fibrillation, which is not immediately life­threatening. But it must be treated because it can spur blood clots to form. Most cases can be corrected with medication. 


White House physicians helped advise on the course of treatment, hospital officials said. 
Texas officials said the shooting was an accident and no charges were brought against the vice president. 
A Texas Parks and Wildlife Department report issued Monday said Whittington was retrieving a downed bird and stepped out of the hunting line he was sharing with Cheney. "Another covey was flushed and Cheney swung on a bird and fired, striking Whittington in the face, neck and chest at approximately 30 yards," the report said. 
Public OK vvith school curriculUlll 
Government calls for increased rigor, amount ofmath, science content 
Associated Press 
WAc;;HINGTON -If improving science and math edueation is suddenly a national priority, someone apparently forgot to tell the parents and the students. 
In a new poll, 57 percent of parents say "things are fine" with the amount of math and science being taught in their child's public school. High school parents seem particularly con­tent -70 percent of them say their child gel<; the right amount of science and math. 
Students aren't too worried, either, according to the poll released Tuesday by Public Agenda, a public opinion research group that tracks edu­cation trends. 
Only half of children in grades six to 12 say that understanding sciences and having strong math skills are essential for them to succeed in life after high school. 
This is not what the people in eharge of the country want to hear. 
Congressional leaders, gover­nors, corporate executives, top scientists -all of them have urgently called for schools to raise the rigor and amount of math and science taught in school. In his State of the Union address, President Bush made the matter a national priority. 
Yet where public ollieials and employers see slipping produc­tion in the sciences as a threat to the nation's economy, parents and students don't share that urgency. Such a disconnect could undercut the national push for more seience and math. 
"There's energy and leader­ship at the top, but there is a task to be done in getting par­ents and kids to understand some of the ideas," said Jean Johnson, executive president of Public Agenda. "You can do a lot from the top, but you can't do everything. Schools are local. The leadership needs to reach out and help the public under­stand the challenge." 
In theory, parents and stu­dents say, more math and sci­ence education is a good thing. 
For example, 62 percent of parents say it is crucial for most of today's students to learn high­level math, like advanced alge­bra and calculus. 
The story changes, though, when parents talk specifically views. 
"They are assuming schools are providing enough. That's the part that is problematic," said Susan Traiman, who oversees edueation and work foree poliey for the Business Roundtable, an assoeiation of chief exeeutive officers from major U.S. eorpo­rations. 
Her group leads a coalition of businesses that has launched a public relations campaign, hop­ing to give math and seience the same urgeney it had during the Cold War space raee. But to reaeh parents, Traiman said, loeal leaders must talk up the subject 
see at school. 
They are much more worried 
about bad language, cheating or 
the pressure for good grades. 
Most parents, meanwhile, say 
their kids are getting a better 
education than they did. Only 32 
percent of parents say their 
child's school should teach morn 
math and science. 
If anything, parents are less 
worried about math and science 
these days -not more. 
In 1994, 52 percent of parenl'l 
considered a lack of math and 
science in their local schools to

In case you missed it, Sunday was the 197th birthday of Charles Darwin. In hundreds of churches across the nation fides et ratio-minded Christians gathered in a spirited, if frustrated, attempt to remind the rest of America that sound science and religion cannot be enemies (unless, of course, you claim that the creator is a liar) and that Reason is tradition­ally another name for Christ. As one Atlanta pastor told her listeners, "A faith that requires you to close your mind in order to believe is not much of a faith at all." 
It is a startling-or perhaps trou­bling-fact that approximately half of all Americans will not accept the plausible and foundational principle of evolution by natural selection, no matter what argument or proof is given for it. Those rejecting this prin­ciple, though they generally give many rather childish and ignorant excuses for their reluctance -once the words monkey, skull or dinosaur have been used, you know that the argument has been lost--nonethe­less float comfortably in their sea of outright contradiction merely because their opposition is religious in origin. 
We should, I suppose, be grateful that this type of bizarre attitude is presently only with regard to evolu­tion in the present day. Certainly if the attitude were, for example, to take hold in the arena of public health, it would be appropriate to panic. 
You have probably figured out by now that I take a very dim view of scriptural literalism, which happens to be one of the causes of this particu­lar problem. Augustine of Hippo was reading Genesis as a metaphor by the

fourth century. His predecessors had already taken major steps toward developing a system for weeding out inconsistent passages, which today allows us to write away Paul's misog­yny and Joshua's genocide and to locate in the Bible the kernel of com­plementary ideas that have become Christianity. This flexible, and almost unique, attitude toward its holy books, together with an early embrace of science, is perhaps the single greatest strength of the Christian religion. In this context, I regard scriptural literalism as unthinking at best and religious sui­cide at worst. 
I draw your attention to the issue of evolution in America because it is indicative of the growth of a particu­larly nasty type of though in the mod­ern world. This type of thought, which goes by many names, but is often referred to (somewhat confus­ingly) as fundamentalism, manifests itself broadly as the notion that clas­sical Western liberalism, free speech, gender equality, specific scientific truths and/or religious tolerance, are incompatible with the tenants of a given religion and that they should consequently be eradicated. 
There are both Christian and Islamic fundamentalists in the world today (whom some people have recently taken to calling Christanists and Islamists, respectively.) Each of these groups speaks with increasing strength, political power and occa­sionally violence. If only for this fact, the rise of fundamentalism in our world should be troubling to many. 
Keeping in mind the historical Catholic understanding of the union of faith and reason, of science and theology and of the tradition of liber­alism granted to empirical enquiry (Galileo being very much an anom­aly), we should also realize that fun­damentalist assumptions are antithet­ical to the core of Christian tradition that gave rise to Notre Dame. Therefore, Notre Dame must, if it is not to be self-contradictory, be an opposition force to these assump­tions. 
To put it another way, the very pur­pose of a Catholic university is to stand as living proof that the ideals of Western scholarship, freedom and science are not incompatible with an orthodox world view, but that they two are wholly complementary. Further, the very purpose of an American Catholic university is to show, not only that the principle of Western scholarship can be married to orthodoxy, but that the principle of American liberalism, republicanism, democracy and equality can be as well. 
At its very best, Notre Dame is a liv­ing model for the rest of the world, in particular those places and peoples infected with fundamentalism, that reason, freedom, equality and ortho­doxy can coexist without pain, con­tradiction or compromise to any of them, and that, in truth, all of them are the better for this mixture. To fail to be this example to the fundamen­talists, to in any way compromise the principles that glue us together in the Western tradition, is to failure in the mission of the University. 
The world is watching, because Notre Dame is a unique mixture in the modern world and has a the diffi­cult task of walking the lines others avoid because they lack the tradition, the desire or the courage to do so. It is a task that we must not fail at, because fundamentalist thought, and its rejection of our foundation, is ris­ing, and the cost of failure -I fear -­would be great.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR 
Vote solicitation went too far 
In the aftermath of the recent student body election, I was greatly disappointed by the behavior of many of the candidates and their supporters. I received around six different e-mails from people supporting the various can­didates. I also received four private messages on face­book. Worst of all, two of the messages on facebook came from the same person, and they each endorsed different candidates. They were also sent out within one minute of each other. This immediately invoked my suspicion. ' 
This leads me to believe that either ad-ware software was used to produce these mass mailings remotely or that someone stole this person's password to do so. Since I know the person who "sent" the messages, I doubt he had anything to do with mailing them. These activities are highly dubious. Furthermore, the messages I received were from three of the five tickets. 
That is not the whole story. There were flyers every­where, some of them without the proper student activi­ties authorization for display. One ticket's team even went into unlocked rooms around campus and put flyers on people's desks. This gross disregard for personal pri­vacy drove me away from voting for that particular can­didate. 
Of the five tickets, only the obvious joke ticket which did nothing to even try to win, avoided using these tac­tics. It is a sad statement to democracy when st"udent government elections can not even be run without cam­paign improprieties. Sadly enough, this strategy works. I know a lot about each ticket because of this intrusive campaigning. So who knows what will happen? In a few years, maybe Dick Cheney will be spamming my inbox telling me to vote for him too. Well at least I'll be able to put that into my junk mail folder alongside all those herbal Viagra ads I keep getting. 
God bless America.

LETIERS TO THE EDITOR 
An ideal worth striving for 
One part of Univnrsity President John .Jenkins' address on academic frnedom and Catholic character that has largely !wen ovnrlooknd is also one of tho most challenging and consequential. Jenkins lauded the "scholarly temperament" as one of tlw highest ideals of tho University of Notre Dame, a quality which he described as "a Socratic con­vktion about one's ignorance, and a corresponding willingness to entnrtain questions and various answers to thnm." lie went on to note that such a tmnperanwnt "demands an appreeia­tion of tho eomplexitins in any area of' n~ality. high standards of inquiry and infernnee, a reluctanen to settle for the current synthesis, and a rnsistance to a prmnature elosure of qunstions." 
This should he a serious provoeation to each mnrnb<1r of our community, as it posns a far greater ehallenge to the character of this university than does his proposal to adopt more carefully definnd limits on the sponsorship of certain events. Taken as seriously as it d<~servns, and as seriously as I believe it was intended, it is an invitation f'or us to strive to bt~ a great university, a Catholic university and a much freer community than many of us have imag­irwd to bn possible or worth striving for. 
 .Jnnkins' words indicate a university which is intm1S11ly concerned with a thirst f<ir a truo understanding of reali­ty in all of its dimensions and thus, one not settling for halfctruths, one contin­ually searching and qunstioning, one not eontent with any rnduction of our desir11 to understand things and to grasp their mnaning and their interre­lation. To this nnd. Jenkins correctly insisted that, "It is the nurturing of this scholarly temperament that deserves, and indeed demands, academic free­dom." That is a much firmer founda­tion for academic freodom than any based only on thin notions of unre­strained individual interests, because it dnmands of us that academic freedom bn engaged in a deep, uncompromising and inexhaustible quest to comprehend lht~ nature, significance and intercon­nnetndness of all things. 
From this perspective, merely the tol­nranee of diversn views on campus without any authentic engagement of our humanity in its capaeity for criti­dsrn and judgnwnt is virtually irrele­vant to the mission and identity of a great univ11rsity. If' that is what is mnant by ;u~adnmie freedom, it is almost trivial and much too uninterest­ing to thn serious quostions of our lives to warrant a deep commitment. In fact, an uncritical free-for-all can be worse than insignificant, because it encour­ages the opposite of freedom: the sub­jection of our reason to the whims of intellectual fashion; sentimentalism and moralism (whether of the right or of the left); or mere inculcation upon our students of the opinions of others (and the power, monny and self-inter­est behind them). That is why Jenkins was right to af'lirm that, "Our greatest contribution as intellectuals and schol­ars ... consists rather in the cultiva­tion in ourselves and in our students of' this scholarly temperament in a world that is often uncomfortable with uneor­tainties, questions and now perspec­tives." 
But then what is the place of Notre Dame's Catholic identity in this insis­tence on the free­dom of' our rna­son to reach always onward'? 
sider the relationship between academ­ic freedom at Notre Dame and a con­troversial campus event such as "The Vagina Monologues." Its sponsors' goal of raising awareness of violence against women is necessary and urgent 
as Jenkins himself acknowledged. The play purports to serve this laud­able end by presenting monologuns of women talking about their sexual expe­riences, which aim to provoke us with their explicit images and language. 
The issue isn't-or really shouldn't be -only that some might be shocked by the assertive use of the word "vagi­na" or that others lind the behavior described offensive to their moral sen­sibilities. The more fundamental prob­lems are, lirst, that the aggressively ideological manner in which it is 
pushed as a 
piece of advoca­
cy, including its 
ritualistic regu­

deep grappling acteristic of the with the mystery settling for half-truths ... scholarly tnm­
of human life and the universe around us, but one that is mostly ignored, and sometimes systematically excluded, from the intellectual life of most elite universities today. Notre Dame can't be a great and Catholic university without a pervasive and seri­ous attempt to propose this tradition as an explanatory hypothesis for under­standing the things that we study and teach and for ordering the way we ought to live as a community. To be very dear: in the context of study, teaching and research the Christian tradition is a proposal, not a shield from inquiry or an obstacle to knowl­edge, but an invitation to verify some­thing, to test it through sincere criti­cism (in the original, literal sense of "separating" or "evaluating") ~~end thus to arrive at a more mature appropria­tion of its value. It is an understanding of Catholic character reJ1ective of a dynamic life, not of formal and sterile doctrine. The scholarly temperament in its encounter with tradition is an open­ing up of reason, not a closure of dis­cussion. This is what I understand to be the real weight-and the attrac­tiveness-of Jenkins' appeal. 
Only against the background of those broad premises can we reasonably con­perament, but 
rather blatantly 
undermines it. 

And second, in substance the play seems to reduce the meaning and value of women's lives to their sexual experiences and organs, reinforcing a perspective on the human person that is itself fundamentally a form of violence. In its radically reduced understanding of and love for human dignity in all its richness, the play thus shares the same root as every violation of human rights, including in particular the many grave violations of the human rights of women throughout the world today. 
The problem of academic freedom in this ease therefore has to do not simply with the presence of the play on cam­pus. but more with the failure to take it up and understand it in any seriously critical way, especially in a manner that might expose and question its violent reduction or the person through a vig­orous, genuine engagement of the Christian intellectual and moral tradi­tion. That tradition proposes to us instead that the immeasurable worth of the human person is rooted in our direct and total dependence on God, evident to us through the mystery or the Word made 11esh. Only in this relation­sbip of my 'T' with that infinite "You" can my frnedom be assured in every circumstance and from every injustice, power or ideology. The evnnt of that encounter is what gave birth to this University, named after the woman who lived her freedom and dignity more fully than anyontl else in all of' history. This is the history that Jenkins is asking us to remember and to make a vital part of Notre Dame's character today, so that we might seek a true education of our hearts and minds in the fullest possible freedom. 
Which is the moro ambitious, morn demanding and morn nxaltnd view of aeademie freedom, education and research: one that is satisfied with a complacent weleoming of every dimin­ished or demeaning view of our ration­ality and our humanity that may be given by the prevailing conventions of the world; or one that insists uncom­promisingly on the scholarly tempera­ment and urges us not to settle for any­thing that fails to correspond adequate­ly to the ultimate valuo and meaning of our lives'! 
The greatness and promise of the University of Notre Dame consists in striving toward the latter as its goal. It pushes our research to be both broader and deeper. It impels our tnaching to be more dedicated to tho good of our stu­dents in friendship rather than giving in to boredom or the temptation to indoc­trination. It urges students always to look for reasons am~ to remain open to those answers that can more fully satis­fy their deepest yearnings for truth. jus­tice, beauty and happiness. 
Because so much more is at stake here than in many conventional plati­tudes about academic freedom, the core of Jenkins' vision proposes a heighten­ing of the dramatic meaning of freedom for this community and for higher edu­cation in general, not a restriction of it. Of course, resolution of the practical implications of this vision will certainly not be without some missteps or con­troversy, because the risks of human judgment and thus the limitations of human frailty arn nneessarily in play. 
But this vision does provide a tension toward (as in "tending to" or "reaching out to") an ideal that makes it possibln to start again every day, despite every mistake or disagreement. It is a dutl­lenge to us as sdwlars, teachnrs and students-a ehallenge that can make Notre Damn truly worth dedicating our­selves to with passion and expectation. 
Paolo Carroza <tssociatc professor of law Feb. 14 

The nature of 'Catholic character' 
Notre Damn history professor Brad Gregory finds that his acadnmic f'rendom has been enhanced by a move from Stanford University to Notre Dame. Philosophy professor .John ()'Callaghan reminds his collnague professor Fritz Warfield that while the I>npartment of Philosophy at Notre Dame can host an annual mooting of the American Catholie Philosophical Assoeiation, providing the necessary facilities for daily mass, ete., our sister department at tlw University of Michigan does not tmjoy such freedom. 
I honestly nwan no offense to anyone when I say that (;regory and ()'Callaghan are exaetly right about sonwthing. Gregory is freer to do many of the things he wants to do as a professor at Notre Dame. ()'Callaghan fHljoys the prospect of return visits to campus by the Amorican Catholic Philosophical Assoeiation. 
But just wlwre's tho seoreboard keeping tally in the all-out contest among tho Sweet Sixteen eon­tenders for tho title of "the frnest university of them all?" Does anyone know how to keep seore in this game'! Is this game worth the eandle'! Does this issue help us promote both academic freedom and Catholre character at Notre Dame? The discussion about aeademie freedom and Catholic character is not about who's number onn. 
It's got to focus on Catholic character, because I think most consenting adults understand that the best way to destroy honesty, trust and friendship in an academic eommunity is to bestow more academ­ie freedom on the defenders of a particular position than is granted its critics. Academic freedom ought to be a no-brainer. But Catholic charaeter? Sounds like a topic for a 400-level course to me. 
But we've got to get a few things straight before we think about a syllabus for that course. Sinen we all share a moral obligation to be as intelligent as possible, we must all understand this course will not be Marketing 401. We're not talking about the University as a brand; we're not thinking about the logo or which actors' names can run above the title. 
To the extent that this issun merits all the atten­tion it's getting, "Catholic eharactor" in ust refer to the quality of a Notre Dame education, specifically -since no one argues that "The Vagina Monologues" or the Il'ornwrl ()uner Film Fnstival are vehides for incrnasing familiarity with tradi­tional Catholieism or the doctrines of the Churd1­the quality of moral education at this Univorsity, and, most particularly, moral education about sexu­ality. Presumably the official Catholic view on sexu­al morality is not trivially trun, a matter of obvious first principles; principles never to bo disputed nor proved. But if that teaching has the status of a the­orem duster, eomplex propositions following rea­sonably from first prineiples, tlwn as it is the busi­ness of some to use every possible means to prove that theorem duster, it must be the business of oth­ers to contest it, by all reasonable moans, ineluding those appealing pownrl'ully to the emotions. That. I propose, is what "Catholie character" rnquirns at a university. 
A disputable point, I hopn.

MOVIE REVIEWS 

Uneven thriller bolstered by Pierce Brosnan 
By GARY HOTZE Scene Critic 
Seeing a film starring Pierce Brosnan as a hit man has certain expectations that come with it. But rest assured "The Matador," directed and written by Richard Shephard, will meet none of them -and that's not necessarily a bad thing. 
While it fails at being a real thriller -as many of the previews suggested it would be -it does succeed, at least partially, as a satirical dark comedy. In the end, "The Matador" is an ironic buddy flick and comedy-drama. Ultimately, it's really the story of the strange friendship that arises from a happenstance meeting in a Mexico City bar. 
Brosnan and Greg Kinnear play the two unlikely associates. Julian Noble (Brosnan) is a far-from-noble 


dialogue-heavy. The thriller aspect of the film never really takes hold. "The Matador" in no way seems to know where it is going, which kills the film's momentum toward the end. 
The performances by Brosnan and Hope Davis -as Danny's devoted wife, Bean -keep the flawed movie from completely submerging before arriving at a disordered destination following a somewhat lackluster finale. 
For this and its many other flaws, "The Matador" is a good but not great film. But it is easily Brosnan's best performance to date. He strikes a note 
as the margarita-soaked and ever­aging hit man, in contrast to his drab performance in the lackluster "After the Sunset." 
And if nothing else, no one who has seen "The Matador" will ever view Brosnan, the former debonair James Bond, the same way again. He pro­vides one of the few truly classic moments in the film -the sight of him as he pra-nces through a busy hotel lobby, grasping a beer and clad only in a black Speedo and boots, is unforgettable.

Timeless message drives 'Glory Road' 
By COURTNEY WILSON 
Scene Critic 
These days, it is unlikely that any­one would question the talent, influ­ence or place of black athletes in com­petitive basketball. In the 1960s, how­ever, small-minded and racist thinking was still commonplace. 
While "Glory Road" replicates the same predictable formula as previous Disney sports movies, its message res­onates nonetheless. 
"Glory Road" tells the story of how Coach Don Haskins (Josh Lucas) made basketball history by turning around Texas Western University's (Texas University at El Paso) program by changing the makeup of the school's basketball team. He eventually played an all-black starting lineup in the NCAA Championship in 1966 against a white Kentucy team. Haskins, 
needed to recruit top players. Desperate, but nonetheless keeping an open mind, Haskins recruits a team full of black players who, based solely on color, are unwanted by other col­leges. 
Facing opposition from all sides, Lucas plays Haskins' fierce yet con­trolled character impressively. Haskins is tough on his players, demanding discipline both on and off find a way out. 

Each man finds himself in Mexico City in pursuit of career opportunities. For Julian, it's a corporately motivat­ed big hit from his handler, Mr. Randy (Phillip Baker Hall). For Danny, it's a last-ditch effort to land a deal with a Mexican firm that will solve his finan­cial troubles. Their chance meeting at first goes awry as a crassly drunken Julian makes a joke out of the situa­tion that killed Danny's son. 
Complications arise in Danny's deal, . which leaves him stranded in the hotel a couple more days. This is enough time for Julian -suddenly lonely after he realizes it's his birthday -to seek redemption and friendship. He takes Danny to the bullfights and con­fides in him with his unseemly occu­pation, dubbing himself a "facilitator of fatalities." Julian must of course prove this to Danny, and it is only a 
matter of time 
before Julian asks 
the court. Hostile opposition from crowds and local racists are set off by Haskins' stern and unwavering father­like image and powerful locker room speeches. What the movie fails to make clear, however, is whether or not Haskins is working to make a statement by pushing his black ath­letes to the forefront, or whether his actions were merely a coincidental way to win basketball games. Audiences will have to assume both if they are emotionally invested the story. Whether he did so or not, his place in basketball history will forever be respected. 
Haskins and his team are forced to overcome all of the obstacles that come with an integrated team travel­ing through racist southern cities in the 1960s. The film depicts little vio­lence on the actual campus of Texas Western, saving its most dramatic scenes for the hatred and humil­

"Glory Road," however, focuses largely on the success and emotion of each game on the road to the champi­onship. For this reason, it might be assumed that the plot is aimed at a younger, more sports-enthused audi­ence. But the story is no less inspira­tional. 
The best part of the movie comes at the very end, during the credits, with a tribute to Haskins and the entire 1966 Texas Miners team. Clips from the real game and a synopsis of each player's continued success are encour­aging. 
Now more than ever, the inspiring story of Texas Western University's team and its1966 NCAA Championship will continue to be recognized as the most influential game in college bas­ketball history. If nothing else, watch "Glory Road" for its uplifting spirit and positive message.

By SEAN SWEANY Scene Writer 
As the Olympic Games at Torino kiek into high gear this week, hHadlines arc filling quickly with updates from the Italian Alps. 
For some, the abundance of coverage is pure bliss, but others actively look forward to the closing ceremonies of the 1:old-weather sports. The magic of llollywood can provide a simple alter­native for both those awaiting the next piece of coverage and for anyone hop­ing for warmer weather. Various films use the competitive zeal of the wintnr Olympics as a backdrop, but only a select handful appear ageless and con­tinue to enthrall audiences regardless of thn snason. 
D2: The Mighty Ducks (1994) 
Quack. Quack. Quack. This popular chant, made famous by the first "Mighty Ducks" movie, echoes the sanw goofy snntimentality in this sec­ond film of the Disney franchise. 
Emilio Estevez returns as Gordon Bombay, a minor league hockey hope­ful who must return to coach the Minnesota Mighty Ducks after suffering an injury. The Ducks are invited to a teenage version of the Olympics -the Junior Goodwill Games -in Los Angnlns, Calif. 
Branded as Team USA, the group is quickly ovorwhelmed with the hypn and glamour of Los Angeles. Much like the first film, both the coach and thn team lose focus before rallying around each other at the end of the movie to heat the bigger and meaner Iceland squad. 
There are many rnasons why this should be a bad lilm. The plot is pre­didable and laughable, the acting ranges bntwnen the B-grade talents of Emilio Estevez and Joshua Jackson ("Dawson's Creek") and the hockey presnnted in tho movie is horribly fake. Nevertheless, "D2" has found a deservod place in the hearts of many viewors. 
As expected with a Disney film, the message is positive and conveyed in an internsting format. Any youth aspiring to play hockey is undoubtedly aware of the "Knucklepuck" and "The Flying V," two moves immortalized in the "Mighty Ducks" series. 
Additionally, the dramatic theme song helps mako the movie momorable, especially during the final shootout scene. when the Ducks win victory over Iceland wearing the same uniforms the NIIL's Anaheim Mighty Ducks wear. 
While cheesy and simple, "02: The Mighty Ducks" is a film that resonates and recalls childhood. Tied to the Olympics at least somewhat, it is a film worth viewing to get in the spirit of international hockey competition. 
Cool Runnings (1993) 
"Cool Hunnings" falls in the same genre as "D2" -another feel-good, inspirational family movie from Disney. Inspired by a true story, the film relates the trials of the 1988 Jamaican bobsled team, which struggled against the odds to simply train and compete in the Winter Olympics at Calgary. 
The story begins with Jamaican track runner Dorice Bannock (Leon Robinson, "Oz"), who falls vietim to an accidental tripping incident, disqualify­ing him from representing the Jamaican team at the Olympics. 
In his desire to compete, Bannock decides to organize a bobsled team since one does not exist in Jamaica. In spite of the fact that there is no snow in

medal taken away for cheating, Blitzer is another misfit who joins the group. Thanks to the acting of Candy and the other members of the bobsled team, there is enough comedy to carry the movie through to its com­pletion. 
The team faces much hardship and scrutiny from outsiders because of its appearance and actions once at the Olympics. Their looks, reggae music and unconventional style draw derision and make them stick out like sore thumbs in the cold weather of Canada -until they begin to perform well and amaze the world. 
This is an entertaining movie that accomplishes what it sets out to do ­tell a story about personal courage in a fun, lighthearted manner. The late Candy turns in an emotional, inspired performance that highlights his diversi­ty as an actor. 
The various bobsled scenes provide enjoyable action, including a funny run down the hills of Jamaica. "Cool Runnings" is another enjoyable Winter Olympics movie that tells of the unend­ing perseverance of the human heart. 
Miracle (2004) 
The 1980 "Miracle on Ice"-the U.S. men's hockey victory over Russia -is documented in the film "Miraele." The movie stars Kurt Russell ("Backdraft") as Herb Brooks. the legendary coach of the team of college players against the Russian juggernaut at the Lake Placid Olympic games. During the Cold War, when the threat of a possible nuclear showdown between the United States and Russia loomed overhead, the world watched as the two countries battled on the ice. 
This excellent film manages to cap­ture the mood of the time while detail­ing the training and play of the Olympic team. The scenario of a young team facing a perennial powerhouse and winning is the inspiration for many sports movies, including the Mighty Ducks series, but this version is the precedent from which the other movies draw their 
scenes filmed for the 
movie. This credibility 

makes the movie enjoy­able for serious hockey fans and those looking for a relaxing watch. 
As the Americans make their way through the Olympics, coming from behind to beat every team they play, the showdown with Russia in the semi­finals takes the world stage. 
Hussell turns in a spectacular per­formance as a stern, caring, plaid­wearing head coach who must lead his team to victory amidst many distrac­tions. 
The historic game against Russia is tense and exciting, capped with the famous AI Michaels question at the final buzzer, "Do you believe in mira­des? Yes!" 
Overall, "Miraele" is well done and presents both the spirit of Olympic competition and a feel-good success story.

Not quite saved, but still good enough

Scene Critic 
Alice Wu's "Saving Face," one of the movies in last week's "Gay and Lesbian Film: Filmmakers, Narr.atives, Spectatorships" series, takes a look at the intersecting li.ves of Chinese Americans living in New York City. 
Written and directed by first-timer Wu, "Saving Face" mainly follows the story of a young lady .named Wil, a sur­gery resident who falls in love with Vivian, a ballet dancer. Vivian is also the daughter of the chief of surgery at Wil's hospital. This spurs Wil to keep the illicit rela-

Wil's m,iddle­
aged widowed mother becomes pregnant and refuses to reveal the father's identity. This leads Wil's grandfather to disown her unless she can find a husband. With no place to go, Wil's mother moves in with Wil, and hijinks ensue. 

Alice Wu's script keeps things bouncy throughout by mixing different plots. The film is part mystery (who is the baby's father?) and part romance with sort of an unfamiliar, foreign aspect. 
The Chinese immigrant milieu never­theless is set in the every-city, New York. 
"Saving Face" is also a coming-of-age story. But the direction tends to be unimaginative and of little conse­quence. 
Wil's mother is the most interesting character. She's a hypocrite. As a victim of love's mischance, which brings shame upon her family, Wil's mother should understand Wil's predicament as a fellow community outsider. But her only response to Wil's sexual orienta­tion is to ignore it -thus perpetuating the unspoken hostile attitude towards 
Wil's sexuality. 
Wil's mother also starts the film as someone who's never really set foot outside her Chinese immi­grant neighborhood. She has never lived by herself. She has race anxieties, and, most importantly, she's never dated before, complicating 
her urgent search for a husband. 
But Vivian and Wil make a fairly uninteresting pair. Wil is the wide-eyed novice in the rites of love. She never leaves that gee-whiz act behind, nor does Wil's love ever get complicated, which means the possibility for conflict remains unexplored. 
As a simply drawn polar opposite, Vivian seems to just breeze in out of nowhere, already certain of her attrac­tion to Wil and of Wil's attraction to her. Equally uncomplicated is their falling­out -it just sort of happens. 
The time they spend during the rela­tionship is insignificant. As a romantic plot, it almost falls secondary to the subplot involving Wil's mother's dating habits. Wil, for a surgery resident, seems to have both an unusual amount of time on her hands. 
Also implausible is the large amount of energy she seems willing to expend on things that a closeted lesbian would find pointless, such as weekly dances at the. Chinese social club, which functions as a stand-in for the stereotypically conservative Chinese community as a whole. Both of them have their own versions of generi(: young Asian­American parental issues, the perennial fodder for drama in films of this sort. 
But that might be the rub. This is a film that was featured in the gay and lesbian film event. Normalization of the relationship between Vivian and Wil to the point at which it felt dull and famil­iar was probably an ideological victory in of itself. 
Either that, or Wu was afraid to push buttons in what was clearly intended to be a mainstream romantic movie.

DVD REVIEW 
Hard-hitting boxing film comes to DVD 
By MOLLY GRIFFIN 
Assistant Scene Edi cor 
Much like the inspiration for its title, "Cinderella Man" is a familiar story. It explores the common sports film cliche of the underdog triumphing over seem­ing insurmountable odds to find victory. 
While it doesn't necessarily add any­thing new to the genre, it is an enter­taining movie. It has a great cast and an intriguing real-life story, and in spite of some overly sentimental moments, it emerges as an engaging movie. 
"Cinderella Man" follows Jim Braddock (Russell Crowe), a once suc­cessful boxer whose career suffers due to injuries and the onset of the Great Depression. He and his wife Mae (Renee Zellweger) must cope with the encroach­ment of poverty, and Jim must deal with being unable to box the way he used to. Through some hard work and lucky breaks, Jim -with the help and support of Joe Gould (Paul Giamatti), his manag­er -reclaims his boxing career. He faces his greatest challenge, both as a boxer and a family man, when he is called to face heavyweight champion Max Baer (Craig Bierko), who has built an imposing reputation for previously killing a man in the ring. 
The movie is based on a true story, and as far as biographies goes, it does a good job of selecting the most salient part of Jim Braddock's life in terms of interest. While the subject matter itself is interesting, director Ron Howard paces the film too slowly and it would have benefited from some trimming. 
The greatest strength of "Cinderella Man" is its high-caliber cast, and the actors all do a fantastic job with their respective parts. Crowe is a convincing actor both on and ofT the canvas, and he is particularly effective at portraying both the pain and resilience of boxing through just his expressions and physi­cal movements. 
While Zellweger isn't given a great deal to work with and has a number of painfully cheesy lines in the film, she does a good job playing the equally nerv­ous and supportive wife of a boxer. Giamatti's character, like Zellweger's, isn't particularly meaty, but he does a great job as a supportive manager and friend. 
The boxing scenes are extremely well choreographed and gut-wrenchingly effective in portraying the sheer physical pain of boxing. 
Scenes outside of the boxing realm suffer, mostly because of the heavy­handed sentimentality that pervades 
them. Not all of the 

scenes are overly emo­tional, but a few, such as when Mae tells Jim that he is "the champion of my heart," are cringe­worthy. 
The extras included on the DVD focus primarily on the historical back­ground of the film and its production. The short featurette entitled "Ringside Seats" provides historical footage from the Braddock-Baer fight in 1935, and "Friends and Family Behind the Legend" features interviews with people who knew Braddock. "For the Record: A History in Boxing" provides a look at the accuracy of the boxing scenes in the film. 
There are also a number of deleted scenes that come with optional commen­tary from Howard, as well as a short featurette entitled "A Filmmaking Journey," which chronicles how the film itself was made. The featurette "The Fight Card" details how the cast got involved with the movie. 

"Cinderella Man" is far from perfect, but much like the film's protagonist, it manages to overcome its difficulties with determination and persistence. While it is a familiar story, the great cast and loving direction of Howard make it an enjoyable experience, and the extras add historical context to an already strong film.

WINTER OLYMPICS -TURIN 

USA slices Kiwis with win 
U.S. men's curling team having strong showing at games 
Associated Press 
PINEROLO, Italy -The 
U.S. men are hogging wins in Olympic curling. If they keep this up, they might start get­ting as much attention as the American women. 
Pete Fenson's team picked up a 10-4 victory over New Zealand in eight ends on Tuesday, wrapping things up two frames early a day after a last-rock loss to Finland. 
"I still say we're playing pretty well," American vice­skip Shawn Hojeski said. "Unfortunately, yesterday we 

missed the last shot of the day." 
The Americans' next game is against host Italy, where curling is usually associated with fusilli. Throw in Wednesday's game against the winless Germans, and Fenson's team (2-1) probably needs to steal just one or two more victories in its other four games to reach the medal round. 
The U.S. women, mean­while, fell to 0-3 with an 11-5 loss to Canada on Tuesday morning, followed by a 6-5 loss to Japan later in the day. The American women, who started with two of their toughest opponents, need to win at least five of their remaining seven games to qualify for the medal round. 
So did sisters Cassie and 
AP 


Jamie Johnson deserve all of their pre-Olympic ink? 
"Of course they should get the attention," men's lead John Shuster said. "They're coming ofT a silver medal .at the worlds." 
Neither team wants the attention for itself as much as for the hacks, hammers and hog lines beloved by curlers but befuddling to a country that doesn't know those terms refer to the push-off blocks, the last stone and the red lines that divide up a curling sheet. 
"As long as curling's getting the promotion it's getting, that's really good for the sport," Hojeski said. "Whether it's our team or their team, I don't think it matters." 
New Zealand went score­less for five straight ends despite having the last rock -a big advantage, called the hammer-in four of them. 
In the third, the Kiwis (0-3) tried to sneak a rock through 
a  couple  of blockers  and  
nicked  one  of them.  The  
Americans  overcame  the  

hammer -think of it like a tennis player breaking serve -for the first of three times in a four-end span. 
New Zealand managed to snap the slump in the sev­enth, but in the eighth Fenson kept clearing them out of the target zone and scored three. Kiwi skip, or captain, Sean Becker shook hands to concede. 
A regulation curling match has 10 ends, or innings, but a team usually concedes when it doesn't have enough rocks to catch up. 
WINTER OLYMPICS -TURIN 
Great One focuses on Tealll Canada's future 
Associated Press 
TURIN, Italy -Wayne Gretzky said he didn't do it. Again. 
He said his own troubles won't affect Canada's supposed­ly good-as-gold Olympic hockey team. Repeating himself there, too. 
Looking tired and drawn, Gretzky arrived at the Olympics with Team Canada on Tuesday, recapping what he's said for days but is vowing not to talk about anymore: that he placed no wagers with a betting ring allegedly run by one of his best friends and possi­

Gretzky said. "''ve conference room said it for seven executive director looking for a good days, it's over and Team Canada vantage point as won't discuss again at Turin the gambling ring alleged to be run by one of assistant coaches and longtime friends, Hick Tocchet. 
"Quite frankly, this is the last time I'm going to talk about it," said Gretzky, the NHL's all-time scoring leader and arguably Canada's most revered citizen. "I've stood forward each and every day, and I'll talk hockey all day long, take any questions about the hockey team or the Olympic games. But, quite frankly, it's over and done with." 
Gretzky was accompanied to Turin by wife Janet Jones, who

done with." 
But where he said it -at the Olympic games -was different. 
So was the size of the audi­ence. His press conference was televised live throughout Canada, where the NHL's all­time leading scorer is a trusted, respected cultural icon. 
Now, like it or not, Gretzky understands his problems could immerse others should Canada not live up to its own immense expectations in a tournament it won in 2002 and is expected to win again. 
"If we don't win the gold medal obviously I'll get blamed, but I've been blamed for losses before. It's not going to change my life," said Gretzky, who as Canada's executive director is effectively the team's general manager. 
No matter what happens, the Phoenix Coyotes coach said he his son talked. 
Not that the 

elder Gretzky heard anything different ­Gretzky repeated much of what he said at a pre-Olympics news conference Monday in suburban Toronto. 
There, Gretzky repeated he did not place any wagers with any betting ring and there was no reason for him to leave his job with the Olympic team. Canada's players have fully sup­ported him, and several said the investigation will not be a dis­traction as they try to repeat as gold medalists. 
"We're thinking about what athletes have to think about, and focus on the job at hand," Canada coach Pat Quinn said. "They have to put things aside, and whatever that distraction may be, that's exactly what they expect of tbemselves and we're all going to move forward."

Still, it's two memorable days for Wright in what has already been a remarkable soason. 
The Wildcats raced to their bost start in conference history and have their sights set on a No. 1 send in this year's tourna­ment. They've done it with a unique four-guard starting line­up that was born out of necessity when star forward Curtis Sumpter was lost with a torn ACL.

The 44-year-old Wright banked Villanova's turnaround on this year's highly recruited senior elass of Allan Hay, Handy Foye, Jason Fraser and Sumptnr. Thny all played major rolns in the renaissance the past two seasons, even if injuries have only rarely allowed them on the court at the same time.

Indiana's Davis will ride out Hoosier problems 
Hoosiers have lost five of last six games 
Associated Press 
INDIANAPOLIS -Mike Davis 

doesn't plan to resign, quit or 
leave Indiana any time soon. 
Arter fueling speculation Monday that his tenure with the Hoosiers might be shortlived, Davis said in interviews Tuesday that he appreciated the opportu­nity to coach one of the nation's top basketball programs. 
''I'm not quitting. I'm going to coach the remainder of the sea­son," he said during an interview with The Sporting News Radio. "We're right there at making the tournament; we're right there. Now someone has to lose for us to have a chance to win the con­ference championship, but every­State for Wednesday's game, thing is right there." Davis told Indianapolis television

SNOWBOARDCROSS 
An1erican injured in debut sport 
Associated Press 
SAUZE d'OULX, Italy -The rough-and-tumble sport of snowboardcross claimed its first Olympic victim before the open­ing race was even run when American Jayson llale tore up his knee during a practice ses­sion Tuesday. 
Hale was running alone, not four-wide as is typical in compe­tition, when he got too much air on a late jump and landed awk­wardly. 
He was taken to a medical center in Sestriere. Dr. Jim Sterling, the U.S. Olympic Committee's chief medical offi­cer, said Hale tore his anterior cruciate ligament and suffered significant bone bruising around the knee. 
"He is comfortable and sta­ble," Sterling said. 
Hale returned to the athletes' village in Bardonecchia, where the snowboarding events are held. He is expected to decide in 
the next few days whether he 
wants to remain in Italy for the 
remainder of the games or go 
home. 

He was not immediately avail­
able for comment. 
His spot on the U.S. team is expected to be taken by Graham Watanabe, an alternate who traveled to Italy to serve as a wax technician for his friends on the team, but now will likely find 
-himself racing in the Olympics. 
The USOC and U.S. Ski and 
Snowboard were preparing to 
submit Watanabe's name as an 
injury replacement. Barring any 
surprises, Watanabe will race 
for the United States on 
Thursday when snowboardcross 
makes its Olympic debut. 
In the final rounds of snow­
boardcross, four riders race 
down the motocross-type course, 
taking big jumps and vying for 
the fastest line down the slope. 
The top two in each heat 
advance to the next round until 
a winner is decided. 
"It's definitely a little crazy," American rider Jason Smith said last week. "You're going down course as fast as you can with three other guys. That's got to be a little crazy. But we're all pro­fessionals, we've all been doing this a long time. We know the risks involved." 
There are also timed qualify­ing heats in which riders go alone. Much of training is about trying to find the fastest line down the mountain, which is what Hale was trying to do when he wrecked. 
The 20-year-old from Sierraville, Calif., tore up the same knee last March, shortly after finishing third in the 2005. World Championships. 
Hale returned in September and had a pair of top-five finish­es in World Cup events this sea­son, squeezing onto the Olympic team at the last moment. He was ranked 13th in the world coming into the Olympics, behind American teammates Nate Holland, Seth Wescott and Smith. 
past two seasons, missing the NCAA tournament both years. 
Davis wants his team to con­centrate on winning as Indiana has six regular-season games remaining before the Big Ten tournament. 
"It's just too mueh emphasis on Mike Davis. It's just too much emphasis on every press confer­ence. It's just too much emphasis on where he's going to be at next year," Davis said in the radio interview. "It's been six years now. So it's time for everybody to get on the same page and just pull for these young men." 
When Davis was asked Monday to explain why Hoosiers fans have embraced him tepidly, Davis suggested it was because he wasn't an Indiana alum. 
On talk radio and on Internet sites, many fans speculated that meant Davis had already deter­mined his future would likely be elsewhere. Not so, Davis said Tuesday. 

"I appreciate this opportunity; it's a blessing for me," he said. "If I say some things out of line, if I say some things people don't agree with, I'm not the first one to do that." 
Davis missed Saturday's 70-67 loss to Iowa, the Hoosiers' first Big Ten home loss of the season, because of flu-like symptoms. Davis attended Tuesday's prac­tice, departed with the team for Penn State and was expected to coach the Hoosiers on Wednesday. 
The question now is whether the Hoosiers can end their slump in time to save their coach's job -something even Davis can't answer yet. 
Associated Press 
The University of Missouri will investigate the circum­stances that led to Quin Snyder's sudden resignation as men's basketball coach last week. 
Snyder stepped down Friday, a day after vowing to fmish his seventh season with the Tigers. A report in the Kansas City Star said athletic director Mike Alden sent his special assistant, Gary Link, to inform Snyder that he would not be retained. 
Link has had no comment about his role in Snyder's resig­nation. Alden has said he asked Link to "gauge how he's doing," but not to inform Snyder that he was a lame duck. Link did not return phone calls Tuesday. 
University spokesman Joe Moore said Tuesday that Elson Floyd, Missouri systems presi­dent, asked Chancellor Brady

Missouri to look into Synder's resignation 
Deaton to investigate the situa­tion. Chad Moller, the sehool's sports information director, also confirmed the decision to "take a look at the course of the events." 
"Dr. Floyd did ask Chancellor Deaton to look into some ques­tions regarding events sur­rounding coaeh Snyder's deci­sion to depart," Moore said. 
Missouri won its first game without Snyder on Sunday, ending a six-game losing streak behind interim coach Melvin Watkins. The Tigers are 11-11 overall and 4-7 in the Big 12 with five regular-season games remaining. 
Snyder was scheduled to make hi<> fust public comments sinee his departure at a news conference later Tuesday in Columbia, Mo. His lawyer, Wally Bley, said the former coach had been awaiting a signed settlement agreement. 
A copy of that settlement, posted on the university's Web site Tuesday evening, shows the eoach will receive at least $574,000. Snyder had two years remaining on a contract that paid him $195,000 annu­ally. 
"If you were involved in this, wouldn't you want this to be signed, sealed and delivered?" Bley said. "We've got to have the deal done. I've got to see this in writing." 
Bley also represented former Missouri point guard Hieky Clemons, whose troubles off the court in part led to Snyder's downfall after leading the school to the NCAA tournament his first four seasons.

have come just before schedule lulls. The Irish beat Providence 92-77 on Jan. 14 for their first conference win, moving to 1-3 at the time. But after six days of rest, they lost consecutive games to Marquette, Georgetown, Villanova, West Virginia and Louisville. 
South Florida -new to the conference this season -is the only winless team in the Big East, but the Bulls lost to the Hoyas, Wildcats and Cardinals by only three points each. The Georgetown and Louisville losses were on the road, as well. 
"I think they really like to play on the road more than at home," Brey said. "They really, 
fearlessly,  go  on  the road.  
They'll  be  excited  to  play  
here."  

Notre Dame is coming off a 90-63 blowout of the same Rutgers team that won 91-84 Sunday over Marquette -a team that beat the Irish by two points on a buzzer-beater Jan. 
20. The Big East produces such parity. 
Irish senior forward Torin Francis was named to the Big East Weekly Honor Roll for the third time this season after scoring 21 points and grabbing seven rebounds against the Scarlet Knights. He combined with senior forward Rick Cornett (14 points, seven rebounds) in that game to dom­inate the inside on both ends of the court -a performance Brey hopes to replicate Wednesday. 

"(South Florida] really, physi­cally, get[sl after you defensive­ly," Brey said. "They're pretty straightforward with how they play. They're a talented group. I know they haven't had the best of luck finishing games, but we can't feel sorry for them." 
Notre Dame is 9-4 at home this season but only 2-3 in Big East games at the Joyce Center. The Irish have five games remaining, including tonight's test, to make up ground on teams ahead of them for the final spots in the 12-team Big East tournament field. 
Providence (4-6), Rutgers (4­7). Louisville (4-7), St. John's (3-7), DePaul (2-9) and Notre Dame are all at the bottom of the pack. And if Marquette (6­5), Syracuse (5-5) and Cincinnati (5-6) hold their spots at Nos. 7, 8 and 9, that will leave just three openings. 
Three other Big East games take place tonight, all with cer­tain or possible implications for Notre Dame postseason hopes. 
Pittsburgh plays at Providence, Cincinnati visits Syracuse and St. John's goes on the road against Rutgers, with all games beginning at 7:30p.m.

Michigan 
continued from page 24 
The last time Notre Dame faced this Big Ten foe was in last year's match when the Irish claimed the 7-0 victory ­one of only two shutouts Michigan suffered last season. Today, the Irish are hoping to use their three nationally ranked doubles teams to their advantage to follow up on last year's success. 
"No other team in the coun­try has all three of their dou­bles teams ranked," junior Christian Thompson said. "(Coach Jay Louderback] said he'd be shocked if we gave up any doubles points this sea­son." 
The No. 1 ranked Thompson twins are hoping to lead the team in trying to dominate their opponents as well rebounding from their first loss of the season. The duo fell to North Carolina's Sara Anundsen and Jenna Long 8-3 last weekend. 

"Last week Catrina and I struggled mentally," Christian Thompson said. "We just did­n't take advantage of the break points and that is what hurt us. But we have two other great doubles teams that we can count on to pull through." 
Following the Thompson sis­ters are the No. 35-ranked pair of sophomore Brook Buck and freshman Kelcy Tefft. Playing at No. 3 for the Irish and ranked No. 45 in the country is the pairing of sen­iors Kiki Stastny and captain Lauren Connelly. 
In singles, playing at No. 1 for the team is No. 24-ranked Catrina Thompson, who shares the most wins on the team this season with Stastny at 13. 
Following at No. 2 is Christian Thompson who is coming off an impressive 4-6, 6-3, 6-4 win over No. 46­ranked Caitlin Collins. That victory clinched the win for the Irish over the Tar Heels 

JENNIFER KANG/The Observer Irish All-American Catrina Thompson prepares to deliver a serve during Notre Dame's Jan. 28 win over Ohio State. 
Saturday. 
Buck is playing at No. 3, fol­lowed by Tefft, Stastny and freshman Katie Potts at No. 6. 
"Katie has had a great start this season. Her wins at Wake Forest and North Carolina have really helped the team get off to the great start we've had," Catrina Thompson said. "We are definitely going to need her in today's match." 
Following the match against Michigan, the Irish will return back home to compete against Tennessee and Harvard Saturday and Sunday, respec­tively.

Crunch time 
Irish look to tame the Bulls in crucial conference contest 
By PAT LEONARD Sports Writer 
The last time Notre Dame received this long a break in Big East play, it returned to lose five straight games. But the team stayed alive for postseason eligibility by beating Rutgers Feb. 8. 
The Irish (11-10, 2-8 Big East) have had a week off leading up to tonight's 7:30p.m. tipoff with South Florida (6-17, 
-
0-10) at the Joyce Center. Entering the season's final stretch, they know repeat­ing such a losing streak would leave them watching the Big East tournament from their home televisions in mid-March. 
"Everybody wants the opportunity, no matter what you do in the regular sea­son, to get to your league tournament," Irish head coach Mike Brey said at a press conference in the Joyce Center Monday. "But we knew the rules [of qual­ification]. We knew the ground rules before we started this thing, so you deal with it." 
Notre Dame's only two conference wins

Belles seek tenth league vvin against Albion 
A Saint Mary's victory would mark the first double-digit win total in program history 
By JAY FITZPATRICK Sports Writer 
The Belles are trying to reach .500 for just the second time this season tonight at Albion College (15-8, 7-7 MIAA). 
The only other time Saint Mary's (11-12, 9-5 MIAA) had an even record was after a 65­61 win over Franklin in the team's second game of the sea­son. The Belles lost their next four games. 
But with their recent stretch of six wins in their last eight games, the Belles are serious contenders going into the MIAA tournament, boasting a 9-5 record in conference play and a guaranteed finish of no less than fourth place. What's

Michigan State  at the Eck  
Tennis Pavilion.  

The No. 31 Irish improved to 5-4 with three straight victo­ries at home over the week­end. 
"I think everybody was tired Sunday with two matches, and the day off was good," head coach Bobby Bayliss said. "I think we're ready to go." 
The Spartans are tied for No. 75 nationally and boast a 4-4 record coming into today's match. 
'Tm very aware of who they have and what their tenden­cies are," Bayliss said. 
Michigan State has a strong doubles team, including Nick more, a win tonight would give the Belles their first 10-win season since joining the MIAA in 1997. 
Saint Mary's is confident going into this game, especially after its first encounter with Albion. In a last minute thriller on Jan. 18, the Belles upset Albion, then 12-4, in a show­case of sophomore guard Allison Kessler's talents. 
The 55-51 win instilled the team with a surge of confi­dence and helped the Belles recognize they had players who could carry the team on their backs. 
And after showing its tough­ness in three dose victories over the next three weeks, the team enters tonight's game on

Michigan poses test for tea111 
Notre Dame rallies with the Wolverines in Ann Arbor today 
By DAN TAPETILLO 
Sports Writer 
Coming off the team's biggest win in five years, Notre Dame looks to continue its success in a matchup with a long-time rival. 
The Irish are putting their current season's undefeated record and 10-1 record in their past 11 meetings with the Louderback Wolverines -on the line today at 4 p.m. in Ann Arbor, Mich. four days after toppling No. 10 North Carolina. 


Notre Dame has dominated the series in the past decade, but this season the Wolverines are coming into the contest with momentum. Michigan is entering the match after upsetting No. 31 Maryland 4-3 in a come-from-behind win on the road last week. 
But the Irish are looking to prevent any possibility of their winning streak being snapped. "We have had a lot of success against them in the past and are off to a great start this season," junior Catrina Thompson said. "But we don't want to overlook any of our opponents."
