Frick won't change fundraising plans 
By JOHN MCGREEVY 
News Staff 
Fundraising efforts at Notre Dame have been so successful in the past that no radical policy changes are being planned, according to James Frick, who was recently appointed special consultant to University President Theodore Hesburgh on public relations and fundraising. 
"The key to the University's successful fundraising is the outstanding leadership of Father Hesbtirgh and the loyalty and commitment of the people who repre­sent this place." 
Frick, former vice-president of public relations, alumni affairs, and development, said he hopes his new role will allow him to "shed some of the day-to­day responsibility and pressure that I have had previously and focus on the things I have both a talent and a disposition for." 
As a key University fundraiser, Frick organized several major fund drives during his 18-year tenure as vice-president. He was the chief architect of the Cam­paign for Notre Dame which ended in 1981. The Campaign collected more than $180 million in con­tributions and gifts.

SMC endowment largest in country 

By JOHN MEN NELL 
News Staff 
Saint Mary's possesses the largest endowment of any Catholic women's college in the country, accor­ding to a recently released 1981-82 survey by the Council for Financial Aid to Education. 
The report lists Saint Mary's endowment as $9.9 million, $4 million more than Resis, the second rank­ed college. The College's endowment currently stands at more than $13 million. 
Jason Linsower, controller and business manager, is not surprised by the findings. "I knew we were strong," he said. "In an era when most schools have had to dip into their endowments, Saint Mary's hasn't had to. 
"Saint Mary's has operated with a favorable surplus each year since 1969. That year the endowment was only $865,000." 
What Lindower says pleases him more than the fin­dings is "the significant progress of the last three years." 
In the survey Saint Mary's also led in contributrions from alumni. Karen Heisler, public information of­ficer, said, "There has never been a vigorous cam­paign to get the alumni to give."

Programmed for excellence 
Excellence. We hear a lot about that at Notre Dame. Father Hesburgh loves to talk about it. So does Gerry Faust, and your parents might have even men­tioned the word while persuading you to attend school here. It might even be said that excellence is a tradi­tion at Notre Dame. 
For the most part, this university does an admirable job of upholding that principle. However, there is one area in which there always has been a lot of room for improvement: the computing facilities on campus, especially, as any engineering student can attest, in the College of Engineering. 
Last summer, the college finally made a move toward improving the facilities here, a move that was loudly cheered by everyone who had ever tried to use the old system. Already, however, complaints are be­ing heard about the new computer. This makes one question the administration's actual commitment to 

excellence and its willingness to provide the assistance necessary to upgrade the Notre Dame computing facilities. 
The last engineering computer was donated by the Burroughs Corp. two and a half years ago. The Bur­roughs Corp. is a leader in the field of business com­puters, but unfortunately its machines are not design­ed to be the main frame of an entire college. 
The Burroughs was slow. How slow was it? Last year, I almost exclusively used punch cards rather than face the long waits on the main computer. Punch cards. This was 1982, and the most efficient access to a computer was a method I naively thought was only used in museums. 
This year things changed. For one thing, most of the punch card machines are removed, so that option has been taken from the students. And more impor­tantly, we have a new computer, one made by PRIME Computer Inc. The PRIME was supposed to be much

faster and able to handle larger numbers of students. And it is. 
But now that the initial euphoria has worn off, we realize that much better than the old system is still not good enough. Twice as many students can use it at one time. But, as one professor put it, that only means "we can frustrate 40 students at a time instead of just 20." It is also faster. Where once you had 15-minute waits, you now have only five. A vast improvement, but is it good enough? 
The system still collapses under a much lighter load than should be acceptable. The situation is so bad that several professors are seriously considering withdraw­ing their class projects rather than "make life miserable for them, not to mention the other 800 who are forced to use it." 
In fairness, it must be noted that the new computer is not all that was expected; and company represen­tatives are coming here next week to try to correct some of the problems. And it also must be noted that once there is a computer installed, more people will want to use it, causing much better systems to appear no better than a poor one. 
There does seem to be an attitude among the 
bureaucracy that strongly supports computers, both on the college and the university level. Plans have been made to replace the college computer with one with double capacity next semester; and the university is already in the process of moving the administrators onto another, attached system. 
In the college, things are probably not as bad as they seem. There are almost always problems with any new system, and many of these can be corrected, at least in part. There now is a long-range outline to con­tinue to upgrade facilities, plans which are compatible with what is already present. 
The existence of these plans is perhaps the most im­portant reason to be optimistic about the future of computing at Notre Dame. If the money can be raised, whether from corporate grants or through private donations, the computing facilities at Notre Dame will be gradually, but steadily, improved, until it has reached a level comparable to the national norms. 
Of course, it would be nice if the process went beyond that, beyond average to the excellence we claim to strive for.

War Powers Act passes in committee 
WASHINGTON (AP) -The House Foreign Affairs Committee voted 30-6 Thursday to give Presi­dent Reagan broad authority to keep I ,200 Marines in Beirut for the next 18 months, as House Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. moved to quell a mutiny within his own ranks against the war powers compromise. 
The committee vote was the first legislative test of the war powers resolution reluctantly accepted by President Reagan, who has said he has constitutional objections to any congressional voice in the deploy­ment of U.S. forces overseas. 
But growing criticism of the compromise agreed to by O'Neill and other congressional leader guaranteed there would be attempts to shorten its length from 18 mon­ths in a heated debate on the House floor, probable next Thursday. 
The resolution declares congres­sional approval of Reagan's policy of assigning the Marines as part of a multinational peacekeeping force in and around Beirut, but also sets some specific restrictions on how they can be used. 
At the White House, deputy press secretary Larry Speakes greeted the vote as a "significant step toward full approval" of the resolution. He said the committee action speaks well "for ultimate passage and indicates widespread support for this legislation."

Even without such a campaign, the school received $502,000 in gifts from alumnae in 1981-82. Last year the school received $930,000. 
The endowment has grown year­ly since 1969 with gifts from alum­nae, bequests, leftover operational expenses and gifts from the sisters. The sisters' $1.4 million cumulative gift is the largest from any single source. 
"If the endowment would grow a lot faster it wou'ld take pressure off the rising tuition rate," Lindower said. 
The endowment itself is not spent but is handled by a group of five outside investors who are given the discretion to administer the funds. 
The earnings of the endowment are considered when deciding upon the tuition. Ti was also pledged as collateral on the bond issued for the building of the Cushwa­Leighton Library.

The "it" is the newly renovated Art Building that once was called  
the Chemistry Building. Snuggled against the south side of  
Nieuwland Science Hall, the renovated building officially becomes  
the new home ofthe art department today at 4.  
A Mass in the building and celebrated by Father Theodore Hes­ 
burgh, president ofNotre Dame, will dedicate the building.  Dennis Ryan and  
The students seem pleased with the new setting. Chuck Hutti, a  Terlsita Arvelo discuss

said, "It's a major fmprovement; the whole building looks better. I  lobby.  
don't see how anyone could work in it (the old Fieldhouse), but I  
really like this new building."  
The new building has more than 55,000 square feet for classes and  
studios. The decision to renovate the old chemistry building was  
made because the department's old home -the Fieldhouse ­was  
demolished last spring.  
The renovation was the cheapest way to give the department a  
new home.  
"For an expenditure ofabout $1.2 million we now have a building  
worth between 3 and 5 million dollars," said Fredrick Beckman,  
chairman of the department.  
The art history classes will remain in O'Shaughnessy in order to be  
close to the Snite Museum ofArt and the art library. Administrative  
offices wlll remain in O'Shag also, but everything else has been  
moved into the Art Building.  
When the Snite Museum of Art was designed, Beckman had the  
architects also design a building to house the department The build­ 
ingwas to wrap around the Snite and its projected costwas just more  
than S2 million. But when cost estimates rose above S5 million, the  
University decided to renovate the old chemistry building instead.  
The chemistry building is in excellent structural condition, and  
the renovation has transformed the interior. Kay Healy works on a The architecture work was completed by Cole Esochis, of South project in Industrial De­Bend, who also designed St. Ed's Hall after it burned in 1981. sign.Curt labitzke, a second-year graduate student in the art depart­ 
ment said, "Everybody is 100 percent happier in here." And he noted  
that "everybody seems to have more energy here."  
The Isis Gallr.ry is located on the third floor of the building, and  
labitzke has an exibition of his drawings and collages there until  
next Friday. He thinks that the presentation is much better in the  
new gallery.  
But some complained that the new building has less space than  
the Fieldhouse.  
The Department ofArt, Art History, and Design has more than 90  
possible majors for both undergraduate and graduate students. Each  
year more than 2,000 students enroll in some art course, and this  
year they have a newly renovated building for their classes.

I always enjoyed being able to walk from one place to another, and I never gave much thought to the fact that what seemed like a tremendous asset . to me was a terrible obstacle to the handicapped person. After I had knee surgery, I began to experience some of the difficulties and frustrations that come with being on cruiches and having to get across campus.  
When I first got out ofthe hospital I tried to see if I could gain access to one of the many golfcarts that can be seen speeding about the university. I was <ntickly informed that the carts I saw were available only for varsity ath· letes who were unable to walk. The average student was left to fend for themself. 
In the past, Notre Dame students often rented golf carts from businesses in South Bend. The costs were prohibitive and the 
supply became uncertain as acts of vandalism on campus made local merchants unwilling to rent their carts to Notre Dame students. 
This problem forced Sister Evelyn Booms, the director of handicapped student affairs and rectress of Pasquerilla East, to try to form a transport service for people with difficulties getting around campus. Fr. Van Wolvlear was originally skeptical about the idea because of the past record ofgolfcart vandalism. He final­ly relented and the service was begun during last year's spring semester. 
The Athletic Department donated one ofits older carts to the cause, and the Office ofStu­dent Affairs showed its support by purchasing a second one. To help cut down on vandalism, the vehicles are stored in the maintenance garage. 
The transport service is staffed entirely by volunteers who have to go out to the main­tenance garage early in the morning so they can have the carts ready for students to be driven to their classes. Handicapped students are driven to and from wherever they have to go on campus until 4:15 p.m. Admittedly, the service is not all-encompassing, but it certain­ly eases some of the burdens that can be as· sociated with an inability to walk while a person lives on a pedestrian campus. 
People interested in utilizing the transportation service, or anyone who is wil­ling to volunteer their time as a driver should contact Sr. Evelyn Booms, 626 Pasquerilla East. The telephone number is 239-7200.

Is scalping tickets really wrong? 
The tradition ofscalping is as old as the con· cept of charging admission to spectator sports. Scalping is deeply embedded in the history of our own country (settlers ex·

Let's look at who loses by scalping on this campus. 
The scalpers don't lose; they make money through scalping. The people buying from a scalper don't lose; they get to see their team play. So who loses? The ticket office. 
Even though most universities and colleges give tickets to their students, the Notre Dame ticket office sells tickets to its students at 
$7 .50 a pop. General admission tickets sell for fifteen dollars each. A considerable sum, espe· cially since the stadium holds 59,000 people. But even at these steep prices, we scal­pers...uh, the scalpers can make a 100 percent profit on each ticket -a profit that the ticket office does not receive. 
So why is scalping at Notre Dame illegal? The state ofIndiana, the leader of the Mid· west, dropped the law against scalping from their penal code in the late 1800's. But DuLac is still against scalping (a tiny bit behind the times?). Why? 
Profit. 
Someone is making a profit where Notre Dameought to be. Personally, every time I see some poor old alumni standing outside a pep rally with a "Need two" sign, my heart just bleeds. I see that poor alumni, who might have driven hundreds of miles to see his old alma mater in action, standing dejectedly in the midst of a celebration. The thought of him driving all that way in vain just tears me. What do I do? Am I going to tell this man that there's no room at the inn? No!

Noseguard vs. Center 
Kelley gets task of block·ing Miam·i's 'rock' Fitzpatrick 
ByTIM DOYLE 
Sports Writer 

Trench warfare is often considered the most grueling form of combat. for victory or defeat. This battle ofthe trenches refers to the confrontation ofoffensive linemen and defensive linemen. 
The ~attic between the Notre Dame football team and the Univer­sity of Miami football team promises to he a classic battle of the trenches as possibly the key matchup ofthe game will he the Irish of­fensive line against the Hurricane defensive line. 
The Irish will be faced with a 5-2 defense from the Hurricanes, the same defense that the Hurricanes will see from the Irish. The key positioh in the 5-2 defense is the noseguard position. The man at this position for Miami is senior Tony Fitzpatrick. 
Miami head coach Howard Schnellenberger refers to Fitzpatrick as "the rock ofour defense." 
Ifyou were to see Fitzpatrick you might think he looks like a rock At 6-0, 243 pounds, he is ideal for the position ofnoseguard. Because ofhis height, he is usually shorter than most centers. This allows him to get good leverage and get·under the offensive center. 
Fitzpatrick also has the strength needed for the position. He can bench press 520 pounds and squat 450 pounds. To put this in perspective, Notre Dame alumnus Larry Moriarty, who was the strongest player on the team last year, could bench press a maximum of485 pounds. 
The noseguard lines up directly over the center position. That means that junior Mike Kelley will have the blocking assignment on Fitzpatrick. Kelley, 6-5, 269 pounds, will he getting his first true test
\ 
at center against a top lineman. 
Head offensive line coach Carl Selmer says, "The matchup of Fitzpatrick and Kelley should be very good. Mike has made the transition to center very well, hut he will get his first true test Satur­day." 
Selmer continues, "Fitzpatrick is obviously their best lineman. He I?'?SS<;~ses !1~~~.t,stre~_gth and good speed." 
\Voile tfiis is Kelley's first season at center, he is no stranger to the offensive line and he has extensive experience. Kelley started all 11 games at the quicktackle position in 1982. ln 1981 he started the last 
two games ofthe season and saw action in the four prior games. Last 
spring he was awarded the Hering Award as top offensive lineman. 
"Going head-to-head against a noseguard is kind ofdifficult," ad­mits Kelley. "You have to snap the ball and at the same time block a player who is breathing down on you. You just have to concentrate on doing what your supposed to do and think." 
Although Fitzpatrick is Miami's top lineman, do not look for the Irish to make any special changes in blocking assignments on his ac­count. 
CoachSelmer notes, "We will just run our regular offense. W c can­not afford to concentrate on just one player, because there are 10 other players out there also playing defense." 
Supporting Kelley on the offensive line on the left side will be senior Greg Golic at quick tackle and sophomore Tim Scannell at quick guard. 
Golic, 6-7, 263 pounds, is starting for the second week in a row in place of Mike Shiner. Shiner remains sidelined with a twisted knee. 
"Greg started last week for us and did quite well, says Selmer. "Shiner has not practiced for seven or eight days because of his knee." 
Scannell, 6-4, 270 pounds, is a probable starter. He hurt his knee against Michigan State and is on a day-to-day basis as far as playing. If Scannell cannot play, look for either seniorJerry Weinle or sopho­more Torn Doerger to start. 
On the right side ofthe offensive line senior Neil Maune and junior Larry Williams remain the starters. When Notre Dame and Miami square off in the Orange Bowl on 
Irish center Mike Kelley leads the blocking Saturday, do not be surprised ifyou hear the banging ofshoulder pads and the butting of helmets. The battle of the trenches will he center stage.

Mr. Consistency 
Jon Autry shows that hard work pays Ol 
By ED DOMANS.KY 
Sports Writer 
Although not one ofthe most glamorous assignments on the defensive unit, the position of nose tackle is cer­tainly one ofthe most important in terms ofits value in supporting the defense. "The nose tackle anchors the center ofthe defense,"says Notre Dame head defensive line coach Greg Blache. "He holds down the middle, and with the help ofhis other linemen, aids in forcing the play to the outside -and that is a key to a successful defense." 
SeniorJon Autry is currently responsible for the nose tackle position on this year's Notre Dame football team. Autry, at 6-2, 246 pounds, is in his second season as a starter in this crucial spot. 
Autry previously saw action at linebacker and end before converting to nose tackle during the spring of 1982. As a linebacker during the 1980 campaign, he played in the last eleven games, including t the Sugar

day that has previously been reserved for rest. "I think we'll bounce back and play very well this week," predicts Notre Dame Head Coach <;erry Faust. 
The second challenge for the Irish is to overcome the widespread vengeance and enthusiasm that has gripped the city of Miami in an­ticipation of Notre Dame's arrival. Notre Dame's I6-14 victory last year on Mike Johnston's ~2-yard field goal with I1 seconds left to play left the Miami team ;md its fans with a very sour taste in their mouths. 
"Not heating Notre Dame last year at South Bend was a missed opportunity," says Miami Head Coach Howard Schnellenberger. "We have, I think, a better team and should be favored in this game (they are favored hy a field goal)." 
With the game being televised nationally by CBS, Miami 
promoters have called it the higgest game in South Florida since the 
1979 Super Bowl which was playt:d in the 75,500-seat Orange Bowl. 
Among the events to take place are a halftime extravaganza that in­
cludes fireworks, and a 50-event promotional plan which began yes­
terday in conjunction with the Notre Dame-Miami game. 
"All summer long we've heard what a hig weekend this is going to 
be in Miami," says Faust. "But we've got to remember that despite all 
those other things going on we're going down there to win a football 
game." 
That will be a third difficult challenge since Miami has won 20 of its 22 games in tht Orange Bowl under Schnellenberger. But facing a high-powered pro-style passing offense and a strong experien(·ed defense are the real challenges that the Irish will face. 
The Miami oll"ense features Bernie Kosar, who was redshirted as a freshman last year, as the quarterback. The 6-5, 205-lb. Kosar has completed 52 ofhis 91 passes this year for 602 yards and has thrown five touchdowns and five interceptions. Tight end Glenn Dennison and speedy wide receiver Stanley Shakespeare head an outstanding corps ofreceivers for the Hurricanes. Dennison has caught 15 passes this year for 18~ yards while Shakespeare has latched onto 13 completions for 194 yards. Eleven other receivers for Miami have c;aught at least one pass this year. 
"Kosar is a big stron~-armed kid," says Faust. "I'm sure he's still 
maturing because he'll only be starting his fourth game against us. 
But you know he'll come out there and throw the ball right at us, just 
likeJim Kelly did the last time we played Miami at the Orange Bowl 
(Kelly threw for 2~8 yards in the first half alone in that game). 
"Howard Schnellcnberger does a great job with his quarterback.~. and he'll be the first one to tell you that throwing the football is the way they like to do husiness. Miami's running game has really im­proved the last couple of years, but there is not much question they're going to put the ball up 30 or 35 times a game." 
The running game, though, is also quite solid for the Hurricanes as Bowl against Georgia. In 1981, his sophomore year, Autry started eight ofthe last nine games at end and earned second-team recognition on the sophomore All­America team as chosen byFootball News. 
When making the transition from end to nose tackle, Autry found himself battling Tim Marshall for the start­ing assignment, but, by virtue ofa Marshall foot injury which sidelined him for the entireseason, Autry landed the starting nod. 
During the I982 season, his top efforts produced seven tackles against Purdye, Arizona, and Oregon. He also recovered a fumble in the season opener with Michigan and garnered two tackles for losses against Arizona. 
A healthy Marshall once again provided competition for Autry during the spring of 1983, but Autry worked very hard and held on to hls starting job. For his efforts in the spring drills, he received the liering Award as 
top defensive lineman. 
With this season still just two games old, Autry h made his mark on his coaches by maintaining a con tent style ofplay. "Going into this season, we thou@ Jon was our most consistent player," says Blache, "1 even after Purdue and Michigan State, we still belie he is." 

Consistency is an important ingredient at a vcrsa1 position like nose tackle. A variety ofdifferent situati arc encountered, and each one may call for somethl different. The nose tackle must be capable ofadaptit to them all. "He is responsible for for quite a few thin! depending on the set up," says Blache. "He is respon sihlc for containing the center, for keeping the offens linemen offthe linebackers, for filling certain gaps, t blitzing certain gaps, as well as understanding a wid1 range of blocking schemes." 
When discussing why one player is often better suited to a certain position than another, the idea of physical assets usually plays an integral part in the dis sion. Autry's coach notes an important quality -no necessarily physical -that greatly influences his pL 
"Jon Autry is his biggest asset," says Blache. "Just: character that he brings as a person. He's an ovcrac-1 hiever. He plays better than he really is. I don't think1 good Lord blessedJon with the talent as he did som other people, butJon manages to get the maximum c ofthose talents. He ha-; made himself a good footbal player. He's a real pleasure to coach." 
Another ofAutry's coaches, defensive tackle coao Jay Robertson, further supports Blachc with his vie, Autry. "Jon is one ofthe players who really accepts coaching and constructive comments in the way till they're made. He's one who will put into action a sq gestion that was made just minutes earlier. 
"He says very little at practice, yet you know from 
look in his eye that he heard everything that was sat 
Robertson continues, "and you never have to worr] 
about ifit will be done or not." 
When Autry looks at himselfand attempts to pinpt 
his own assets, surprisingly enough, his own ideas p 
ty much parallel th0se cited by his coaches. 
"I have a strong desire to do well," says the senio 
economics major from Ft. Wayne. "I don't like to sc 
myselfongame films doing things wrong. I get very 
set with myself. Ofcourse everyone wants to be peri 
but nobodywill. I strive each time just to do evcrythi 
right." 
At the beginning ofevery season each player usu; setsa goal for himself, and Autry is no exception. In tl case, by usingwhat Autry himselfand his coaches set his biggest assets, the goal he has established beco 
very realistic. 
"My goal is to be the best that I can possibly be," 
says, "by performing to my maximum capabilities 
game, each play. As far as I'm concerned, things do 
come easy for me. I just have to work hard in gctf 
them done." 
To be the best that he iscapable of, Autry works lu both on and offthe field. "When we're not on the fie 
go over in my mind my foot placement, my hand p 
ment, and where I'm supposed to be at a given time­
well as what an opposing player may do in certain sit 
tions. I think this mental review, then, just carries o 
into the game." 

Alongwith mental preparation, Autry also worked the physical. "Over the summer I worked out with Stacey(Toran) and we did a lot ofrunning and lift" he says. "I feel a lot stronger. In the la'lt two games I wasn't getting as tired as I was last year. I feel like I'm · lot better shape." 
Being in good shape cn-.blcs Autry to be the co · tent player he is, and consistent play is an example · the type ofleadership the senior veteran provides li his teammates. 
''I'd like to think that my teammates respect me a what I stand for," says the soft-spoken Autry. "l'mn vocal leader. I just try to present myselfin a way that show someone a good example." 
"He's a quiet leader," said Blache. "He leads bye ample or by battling. I think the guys rally around h because they know they're not going to outwork hi They just strive to be as consistent as he is." 
When Autrycompletes this season at Notre Dame, will have to move on to other things. Although his future holds a vast amount ofuncertainty at this time still has some ideas that keep him looking ahead. " now I just have things in the back of my mind," he s "but nothing is final. I have school. I'll get my degre and I hope to play further on. For the time being, though, I'm just taking things as they come." 
As fur as playing football beyond college is con­cerned, Autry believes it"s something he has to try. " not drafted, I'll try out somewhere," he says. "I feci I owe that to myself. I've heen in the game for as longa can remember, and it's something I've wanted to do 
No matter what Autry does in the future, his serv· will certainly be needed the remaining nine games this season. Autry is a team player and his detcrmin manner is just one thing that everyone will soon co to notice. A player ofhis type can only aid in prov· positive support for those around him. 

   Miami 
it is led by a trio of seniors. Keith Griffin, the team's leading rusher last year with 473 yards, will start at tailback, while Speedy Neal, a 6-2, 245-lb. bruiser, will start at the fullback slot. Neal has gained 100 yards this year so far on 22 carries. 
The top rusher is backup halfback Albert Bentley who has run for 206 yard~ this year on 41 attempts. 
If the Irish arc to stop Miami's strong offensive attack it must ex­ploit the relatively inexperienced Hurricane offensive line. Notre Dame's defensive line must definitely put better pressure on Kosar than it did against Michigan State's Dave Yarema. In an effort to im­prove the line, sophomore Eric Dorsey will make his second start this year at the flip tackle position. The Irish may also need to rush as many as five men. Mike Gann, who started at flip tackle in the first two games, will move over to the cont~in tackle slot in place ofGreg Dingens. 
"Our defense has to get better as much as anything, especially against a team that will test it the way Miami will," says Faust. "We're asking a couple of young inside linebackers (freshman Mike Kovaleski and sophomore Tony Furjanic) to grow up in a hurry, and as they do we'll get better."  
Seven starters return for the Hurricanes on defense. The cast is headed by nose guard Tony Fitzpatrick, linebacker Jay Brophy, roverback Ken Calhoun, and cornerback Rodney Bellinger. Besides being experienced, it is an aggressive hard-hitting defense that Phil Carter, Notre Dame's starting tailback last year, described as "very mouthy." 
Whatever it is, it is unit that poses a threat to Notre Dame's ground-oriented attack led by tailbacks Allen Pinkett and Greg Bell. The Hurricanes have yielded an average of just 134 yards i>er game on the ground this year against such ground-oriented teams as Florida and Houston. The Hurricanes arc also very capable of defending against the pass. Three of the four starters return from a secondary that allowed only 145 yards a game through the air last year while allowing the opponents to complete less than halfoftheir passes. 
Based on last week's performance, Faust isn't pushing any panic buttons yet. After all, the Irish offense did pile up 446 yards oftotal offense while the defense allowed the Spartans only two first downs and 47 yards oftotal offense in the second half. 
'We didn't play that poorly either offensively or defensively, but we can't give up the big plays the way we did last weekend," says Faust. "Miami committed seven turnovers in its opener against Florida and Purdue did the same thing against us. That's not the way to win football games. We gave the ball away four timesagainst Mich­
igan State and it cost us." "'"'""u" ~ 11118 ;. _, Thus, the final challenge is to not give up the big play and·llave any critical turnovers. With so many challenges confronting it at Miami, Notre Dame does indeed have the opportunity to redeem itself.

His best, he says, has yet to be seen. It may come this weekend. "This is the biggest game ofthe season," he says. "We feel we are on a roll." 
Coming offtwo consecutive vic­tories, scoring 64 points in the two games and holding their opponents scoreless in the last seven quarters, you can understand why. 
Griffin led the Hurricanes in rus­hing last year, gaining 473 yards on 87 carries ( 3.6 average). But in a pass-oriented offense, 100-yard rus­hing days are rare. Only one player had a 100-yard game for Miami last year (Speedy Neal had 110 against Cincinnati). 
Griffin's best day rushing was against Virginia Tech last year when he gained 85 yards. It was the game in whichJim Kelly was lost for the season, and UM turned to the ground game to preserve its lead. 
The running game at Miami is not the same as at Ohio State where the elderGriffin made history. UM's lon­gest run from scrimmage last year was 20 yards -by Keith Griffin.

letters to a lonely god 
Becoming Immortal 
by Rev. Robert Griffin 
N
ine years ago, Darby's Place, a haven for the night people of Notre Dame, was opened from mid­night until four a.m., in the basement of Lafortune. Hemingway has writ· ten a story called "A Clean, Well­Lighted Place". Darby's was the campus equivalent: a hostel for characterswho don't fall asleep until morning is near. The Ombudsman suggested that the place be named after the original Darby O'Gill, who travelled with me as a sidekick, like Tonto accompanying the Lone Ran­ger, or Laurel hanging out with Hardy. Darby's Place had semes­ters when it was very popular, and semesters when it was nearly forgot­ten. For years, the cocker spaniel and his master were faithful in showing up to meet the patrons. At times, it felt embarrassing to be near­ly alone in a shabby room, pretend­ing to be Toots Shor, the Falstaffof midtown Manhattan, while everone else was asleep. Night people come and go, but students never signed a contract that the basement of Lafortune would be their after-hours gathering place. When the original 
Darby died in 1980, he was replaced 
by D. O'G. II as the maitre d'. The 
name on the door didn't have to be 
re-painted, because one cocker 
spaniel looks a lot like another. 
Last year, feeling out oftouch, I kept away from the place that was 
neither entirely clean nor especially well-lighted 
Last Monday, a thoughtful, pleasant student who now manages Darby's, asked me ifI minded ifhe changed the name ofthe place. His question led to a mcment when I was fighting for grace under pressure. Did I mind? Ofcourse I minded. Why shouldn't I mind? It was the end ofan era, the turning point between one generation of students and another. It was the beginning ofbeing forgotten. 
I told the new manager: "I mind a great deal, for sentimental reasons. But it's your right to make a managerial decision. I have no right to oppose it." 
Most ofus would like to be num· bered among the immortals ofthe Notre Dame tradition. We would like our names included amon_g the traditionally great ones, with ourlife stories being told as part ofthe Notre Dame myth. In the song from 
Cymbeline:"Golden lads and girls all 
must/ As chimney sweepers, come to dust." We cannot deserve to be unforgettable. We can't even make people care a great deal that we are 
here now. 

Coaches stand the best chance of ' becoming immortals, but Destiny has to be favorable in giving them the breaks. A new coach comes to the campus with universal acclaim. He is a mythical figure as long as his luck holds out. Coaches know better than anyone that we ·were never promised that life would be fair. 


ProfessorJoseph Evans was a wonderful man. At his death, his 
Darby O'Gill II, pet dog of Father Robert Griffin, relishes 
in the attention ofa young visitor to the ND bookstore. Widely ac­claimed for his role as a campus celebrity, Darby never misses a chance to greet a new fan. 
friends wanted to immediately es­tablish him as an immortal. Because they were in such a hurry to honor him, they settled for too little: a dedicatory plaque that tarnishes, on the least impressive fountain in the mid-West, outside the Huddle near · the picnic tables. In the cold months, when the water is turned off, it becomes a receptacle for paper cups and napkins. It is a depressing monument to a teacher who stood as tall as the statue of Moses outside the library. 
Father Cavanaugh was president 
ofNotre Dame when I graduated in 
1949. He was an immortal who 
slipped home to God almost un­
noticed, because the students were 
away on Christmas break. A winter 
blizzard closed the South Bend air­
port on the day ofhis funeral, 
keeping away mourners. He 
deserved a chieftan's sendoff, but many ofus were not here to honor him in death."Men must endure/ Their going hence, even as their coming hither:/ Ripeness is all" wrote Shakespeare in King Lear. Ripeness only means the fulfillment ofone's alloted years. 
Woody Allen, in the movie,Annie Hall, tells the story oftwo ladies staying at a hotel in the Catskills. One lady says to another,"The food in this place is terrible." The other replies,"Yes, and they give you so little ofit." Woody Allen com­ments:"life is like that. At times, it's pretty bad, but it's disappointing how little you get ofit." 
Managers have a right to make their decisions to change. Darby O'Gill II has lost his right to have a place named after him. It's my fault that he didn't get out much at night to go over there. When I break the news to him, I'll be thinking on his behalf: "It wasn't much ofan oppor­tunity to become immortal, but how quickly this little honor has passed me by." 
Rev. Robert Griffin is University Chaplain and resides in Pasquerilla West.

ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -Tom 
Paciorek drove home Carlton Fisk 
from third with a groundout in the 
eighth inning to lift the Chicago 
White Sox over the California 
Angels 3-2 last night. 
Jcrry Koosman, 11-7, scattered 
six hits through seven innings to 
gain the victory with relief help 
from Salome Barojas, who picked 
up his 13th save. 
Fisk singled with one out in the 
Chicago eighth and moved to third 
on a double by Harold Baines. 
After an intentior.al walk to Greg 
Walker, Fisk scored as Paciorek 
bounced into a force play. 
Ken Forsch, 11-12, lost his fifth 
straight decision despite going the 
route for the II th time.

A tradition of teamwork. 
Notre Dame's heritage of football greatness began before Rockne. It will last beyond Faust. Because it is built on discipline, cooperation, self­sacrifice-qualities that blend individual skill and spirit into fighting, ~nningteams. 
Teamwork always has been important in Michiana. Through the years, Michiana people have proven their willingness to put aside their differences, to wqrk together to make their commun­ities alive with economic, education, cultural and spiritual opportunity. 
We at 1st Source Bank are proud to be part of the Michiana · team. We're delighted that we have been able to play a role in a continuing regional effort to revitalize the economy through local business ownership. 
Of course, we know the game is not over. But we also think the time is right to celebrate the Notre Dame/Michiana tradition of teamwork. So we are pre­senting two very special television programs-"Wake Up the Echoes" and "Building with Our Vision." 
"Wake Up the Echoes" is the spine-tingling history of Notre Dame football. "Building with Our Vision" tells the bright story of Michiana yesterday, today and tomorrow. Thanks to the team­work of the staff at WNDU-TV, the two programs will be shown without commercial interruption starting at 3:30 P.M. SUNDAY, SEPTEMBER 25, ON CHANNEL 16. 
We urge you to tune in. We know you'II be entertained "', ·~
