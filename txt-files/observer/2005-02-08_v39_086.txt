Students see profs as liberal

Editor's Note: This is the second in a three-part series exploring the role of partisan politics in classes at Notre Dame. 
With the prevailing trend in academia leaning to the left, as many students and professors noted, Notre Dame's always !=atholic and often conserv.ativn tone~ can sometimes lead to tension within departments and IWPil between professors and thP.ir students. 
Last semester. philosophy professor Kenneth Sayre taught a class called Environmental Philosophy. Subjects discussed included Western consumerism, global warming, Alaskan oil-drilling and other controversial sub­jects. Sayre said that although he generally keeps his political views in the background in his morn con­ventional philosophy classes. this class soon developed a different tone. 
"It's good not to Jet your own views enter into the dis­cussion. if you can have .any control over it," said Sayre. "I began the course with the point of view of keeping my own political views complete­ly in the background. As time went on, that became less and less possible." 
Sayre said that since many of his students who took the class were already con­cerned with the current state of the environnwnt. many had more progressive points of view. Nonetheless. he maintained that the class­room discussion never descended to the level ol' ser­

INSIDE COLUMN 
Proud legacy child 
When sitting down to think of what I could possibly write about for my inside column (yes, ideas for these are harder to come up with than you may think), I was brought back to last week's "town­ie" column and thought, what about the legacies? 
Yes, I'm one of "them." 
Twenty-six years ago, my mom, a jock BP babe who lives for March Madness, and dad, a ROTC accountancy Tricla de Groot Zahmbie, who swears the dorm was different when News Writer he was here (no bun runs back then, or at least let's hope not) met via a mutual friend. My mom, or so I'm told, acted kind of like a fifth grader does when they like someone. You know, the "Eeew, Steven de Groot, how could anyone like him?" attitude accompanied by a series of childish pranks. But, I guess it worked for my dad because last year my par­ents made the almost 700 mile drive· from Atlanta, about half of which is 

I through Indiana cornfields (which 
r-makes the drive seem about twice as long), to drop their oldest, that's me, off at Walsh Hall. My dad proudly boasts that the first song I learned was the Notre Dame Fight Song, the result of a long car ride with a two-year-old and a real love for the Irish. We have a "Play Like a Champion Today" sign at the foot of the basement stairs, which my parents give even my Purdue friends grief about ifthey don't hit in on the way down. And yes, the only reason we got cable television growing up was so that my dad could watch Notre Dame football games. Notre Dame has been a part of me since August of 1985, when at just two weeks old my parents moved back to South Bend to live during the school year, so that my dad could join the Notre Dame Law School class of 1988 and become a double darner (guess four years here just wasn't enough for him). However, the ND tradition didn't just start with my parents. I have a picture of my mom's parents standing in front of the dome before a formal when my grandfather was a junior here. My mom's sister, Tricia, is one of the names lining the wall of the JACC. (To this day, my mom swears that if she had been a couple of inches taller she could have played basketball for the Irish too.) Some people might hear my story and think that the only reason I'm here is because I'm a legacy. That may in part 
be true, but because I've always loved the school so much, I did all I could so that I too could become part of the Fightin' Irish. 
Reading this, you might think that I'm awfully cheesy, which I probably am, but sometimes, I think that's ok. Sure, there are things that frustrate me abom the school, and yes, I do find myself complaining to the tune of my peers about things I wish could change, but I wouldn't have it any other way. I am, and we are, ND.

Even  though  he  was  

unable to reach the accelera­tor, the boy managed to put the car in gear and the idling engine provided enough power to take him slowly to the store, a quarter-mile from his home, about 1:30

Weaving and with its head­lights off, the car got the attention of police Sgt. Jay Osga, who initially thought he was following a driverless car that had taken off after being left running at a gas pump. 

The car turned into the boy's apartment complex and struck two parked cars, then backed up and struck Osga's police car. 
That's when Osga discov­ered the boy inside.

COR 

Council assesses fund for concerts or speakers 
By MARY KATE MALONE 
News Wriler 

In the midst of student body president and vice president elec­tions, the Council of Hepresentatives met briefly Monday to discuss the progress being made on the possible endow­ment fund for concerts or speakers at the University. 
COR recently formed a commit­tee to address the likelihood and logistics of creating such an endowment. which Council mem­bers predkted would be valued between $1 million and $5 million. Though details are still being debated, COR considered con­tributing $100,000 from Student Government's carry-over fund, which has accumulated an excess of money over the past few years. 
Dave Baron, chief executive assistant and a member of the newly-created committee, updated representatives on the steps being taken to create the endowment. 
Baron told representatives that the next step is to speak with vari­ous members of the Notre Dame community to acquire a better understanding of what is involved. 
"We met to discuss the concert endowment and whether it would go to concerts. speakers or both. We decided we need to talk to peo­ple to see which is the most feasi­ble," Baron said. 
Baron notnd that meetings will be scheduled with the Office of Student Affairs, the Investment Office and the Student Activities Office in the next few weeks. 
Jimmy Flaherty, the Student Union Board manager and a com­mittee member. told representa­tives that he hoped this fund could be modeled after other well-known endowments at the University. 
"We arc going to gather as much information as we can. We need to learn how thny are start11d up and managed." Flaherty said. "We need to find a rnodpf." In otlwr COR news: 
+ Baron and Karla Bell, student body vice president. spoke to rep­resentatives about their presenta­tion to the Board of Trustees. The report, which is the second of three presentations for the year, focused on issues of diversity on campus. 
"The Board really liked it. They said that it was a problem when they were here in 1996," Bell said. "They said it was in the top tier of reports they had ever received because a lot of the time it's just people asking for money." 
Baron was quick to note that the third report, which will discuss solutions to the problems present­ed in the second report, will require a great deal of effort.

Charat: France still uneasy ally 
By MEGAN O'NEIL Assistant News Editor 
Sylvain Charat, a former his­tory professor at the University of Paris-Sorbonne and assistant to former Finance Minister Alain Madelin, downplayed the strained relationship between 
· the United States and France during a lecture at Saint Mary's yesterday. Charat asserted that French­American relations are current­ly tense. but that the distrust born out of the 2003 invasion of Iraq is slight in comparison with past moments of crisis, including during the French Revolution, World War II and in the 1860's when France attempted to establish its power in Mexico. According to Charat, French­American relations reached one of its worst periods during the 1960's when President Charles de Gaulle sought to build a strong independent France and European Union by seeking to obtain nuclear arms. "This agenda was extremely worrying for the United States," said Charat. "In the 1960s the relations were not good at all, even worse I would say, than right now." Charat called the current uneasiness between the two countries "typical of the rela­tions of the United States and France" since the birth of the French Fifth Republic in 1958. "You have to know that France was not against an armed intervention in Iraq [ini­tially]." said Charat. 
According to Charat, French president Jacques Chirac, agreed to support the United States in Iraq under U.N. reso­lution 14. which granted the right to use force in certain cir­cumstances. 
From a business perspective, support for the American-lead invasion would have been a wise decis-ion, said Charat. French entrepreneurs and bankers would have had an advantage in securing lucrative development contracts. 
However, the French presi­dent reversed his decision in January 2003, leaving the French public confused and the Bush administration slighted. 
"We had a sense in Paris that a promise was made and not fulfilled," said Charat. "The question is why the French change their minds because it was very fast and it was rather unexpected." 
The change in the French position on the invasion is very complex, Charat said, and stems from both internal and international sources. 
Charat cited the first reason as changing demographics in France and in Europe as a whole. 
"In France there is about five million Muslims," said Charat. "That's a huge power in a way. The big problem is that the French society fails to integrate them into French society." 
With a growing Muslim popu­lation, it would have been domestically unpopular to sup­port the invasion of Iraq, said Charat. Such a stance would have alienated a demographic that already fails to identify with French culture. Further, those votes will be important to Chirac in the next presidential election. 

Opposing the United States gave France an opportunity to act as a leader in the European community, Charat said. · 
"France is a leading force in the European Union and wants a strong European Union in a multi-power world," said Charat. "[ChiracJ doesn't want a 
world where France is  con­ 
trolled by other states."  
The  anti-war  stance  also  

reflected differences in political ideology. According to Charat, Chirac does not believe democ­racy will work for all nation states. Attempting to bring democracy to a place such as Iraq, therefore, would be a mis­take. 
The effects of two World Wars fought on French soil have col­ored its approach to interna­tional conflict, said Charat. 
"The Europeans prefer nego­tiating to going to war," Charat said. "It may be because of our history." 
Charat said he was confident that French-American relations will improve in the future. 
"We have now to set up new relations. It is extremely hard, the Iraqi crisis helped show us that." 
The United States will have to improve its relationship not just with the estranged French gov­ernment, but also with the European Union.

Holy See's No. 2 official, Cardinal Angelo Sodano, faces resignation question 
Associated Press 

HOME-From inmates in prisons he has visited to diplomats from onn the few countries he hasn't, get­well messages and girts have been pouring in for Pope John Paul II. who the Vatican said Monday will stay longer in the hospital as a precaution. 
Papal spokesman .Joaquin Navarro-Valls told reporters that the popn continued to get better a wcnk after his emergency admission to the Gemelli Polyclinic with breathing problems that developed with the l'lu. but that "his doctors have advised him to stay a few more days." 
Navarro-Valls refused to be pinned down on a dis­charge date for the 84­year-old pope, who is also weakened by Parkinson's disease. "Doctors have sug­gested several more days," he said. 
The next medical bulletin from the Vatican is sched­uled for Thursday.

"I think some students just have a personal axe tci grind, and then you've got this whole system telling them the University is a liberal place. that the University is out to corrupt you." 
Tillery recalled the purpose of the university, a melting pot of people and ideas, where students and faculty can think creatively and criti­cally together about ideas and issues that are relevant to the world they live in. 
''I'm indebted to my stu­dents who disagree with me from the left and from the right, because I've learned a lot from them, and I thought that's what university is about," said Tillery. "I think we have a culture of pugna­ciousness and vapidity that is really trickling down to the University and it really makes it hard to have robust conversations."

that was set to expire in June, University spokesman Matt Storin said Monday. 
The prosecutor's office filed two counts of battery and two counts of domestic battery, each a class A misdemeanor, against Duerson in the incident, which took place in room 236 at the Morris Inn at 1:45 a.m. Thursday, according to records on the Notre Dame Security/Police (NDSP) crime blotter. An accompanying blot­ter record of a theft in the same room at the same time refers to a piece of jewelry that was not accounted for when Duerson and his wife, Alicia Duerson, "both cleared out of the room," NDSP director Rex Rakow said. 
Rakow declined to comment further on the incident, and Storin said he did not know any details about the nature of the argument. 
Alicia Duerson was treated at a local hospital and released, according to the prosecutor's statement. 
The Duersons were staying on campus for the winter meeting of the Board of Trustees. Dave Duerson, who was a member of concerns. We ask that you respect our privacy, particular Alicia and our children, and ask for your agreement with us in prayer. I offer my sincere apolo­gies."

Storin said that to his knowledge, Dave Duerson was not arrest­ed. and added he did not know if the former Irish ·defensive back was brought in for questioning by NDSP or other 
"As with all people, we, too, are less than perfect human beings. This is a family misun­derstanding which occurred in private and has already been resolved in private," Duerson's statement read. "It has brought us even closer together. Our attorneys are working with local officials to address their police agencies. There is no record of Dave Duerson being booked at the St. Joseph County Jail, Deputy E. Brownbridge said. 

There were witnesses to the alleged crimes who gave state­ments to law enforcement offi­cials, the prosecutor's statement said, but Storin said he did not know the identities of the wit­nesses or how many were pres­ent. 
Morris Inn director William Beirne declined to comment. 
Storin said he did not know when Dave and Alicia Duerson left Notre Dame. 
Board chairman Patrick McCartan recognized Dave Duerson's resignation Monday. 
''In view of the serious matter now confronting Dave Duerson, he has voluntarily resigned. from the University's Board of Trustees," McCartan said in a statement. "We have accepted his resignation. Without pre­judging any legal outcome, we believe this is the right decision, consistent with expectations for membership on the Board. Our thoughts are with everyone in the Duerson family during this difficult time." 
University President Father Edward Malloy also issued a statement on Dave Duerson's decision to resign. 
"It is regrettable but proper that Dave Duerson has resigned as a member of the University's Board of Trustees," Malloy said. 
"We are appreciative of his past service, but the circumstances in which he finds himself clearly make this the proper course of action. Our prayers are with Mrs. Duerson, Dave and the entire family." 
It remains to be seen whether there will be any changes to the status of Dave Duerson's other titles and awards at the University, Storin said. In 2001, Dave Duerson received the Notre Dame Alumni Association's Sorin Award, and has also served as a leading member of the athletic depart­ment's mentoring program. according to und.com, Notre Dame's official athletics Web site. 
Dave Duerson is also presi­dent, CEO and founder of Duerson Foods, LLC. and he and his wife are both on the company's Board of Directors. Duerson Foods, LCC did not return calls seeking comment Monday.

ND's Hatch in need of econon1tc experience 
Wake Forest has previously lead the post­industrial revival for the city ofWinston-
Associated Press 
WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. ­Wake Forest's incoming president is largely untested in one area that may define his tenure at the school -as a leader of regional economic development. 
In recent years, the city of Winston-Salem and Forsyth County have both looked to Wake Forest to lead efforts to revitalize his thoughts on economic develop­ment since he was named Wake Forest's next president on Jan. 21. 
"As I keep saying, 'I have a lot to learn,' " he said. 
"I think one has to be creative, opportunistic and collaborative ­not in a way that diminishes the role of Wake Forest as a private university," he said. "The key goal of a university is not economic

since 1975, Hatch also is considered an expert in the history of religion in America. 
In succeeding outgoing Wake President Thomas K. Hearn, who steps down June 30, Hatch takes over for a man who was highly active in efforts to link the univer­sity to the local economy. 
. Hearn helped found Winston­Salem Business Inc. in the mid­1980s to recruit companies to the city, as well as Leadership Winston-Salem, which brings local leaders together to talk about community issues. 
He also has chaired the group that manages the Piedmont Triad Research Park, which area lead­ers view as essential to building a new economy in the area. 
Notre Dame has taken a less active role in economic develop­ment in South Bend. 
When asked whether the local economic-development agency in South Bend looks to Notre Dame for leadership, Project Future executive director Pat McMahon said simply, "No." 
With South Bend (population 107,789) transitioning out of the manufacturing economy and into one based on health care, educa­tion and financial services, Notre Dame plays a huge role in the local economy, McMahon said. 
And he said Hatch has been one of two people at Notre Dame who discussed with his group how to get research out of the university and into the community, particu­larly in the sciences and engineer­ing departments. 
Mark Eagan, the president of the local Chamber of Commerce, said Notre Dame has stepped up its community involvement over the last decade, taking part in efforts to revitalize housing and keep young people in the area. The school and city leaders are also involved in plans for develop­ing a technology park. 
But a local corporate leader who has worked with Hatch on a number of community projects said anyone expecting him to take a front-and-center role in local economic development could be disappointed. 
"He's not a drum beater," said Chris Murphy, chairman of 1st Source Corp. and 1st Source Bank. "If people want him to jump to the front of the parade, he's not going to do that. He's a quiet, sen­sitive leader." 
Hatch noted that many people in North Carolina have asked him ple he could go to 
for input who he trusts,'' said Richard Jensen, the chairman of the economics and econometrics department at Notre Dame. 
"He doesn't have that at Wake. He'll have to learn who to trust." 
Teresa Ghilarducci, an associate professor in the economics and policy studies department at the school, said that she saw Hatch perform best as a mediator of con­tentious situations. 
"He doesn't shy away from con­troversy. I believe he embraces it as a way for a solution to emerge," she said. 



Notre Dame grad leaves DNC race 
Tim Roemer bows out and offers the Democratic party a warning 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON Tim Roemer, the only remaining opponent of Howard Dean in the race to be chairman of the Democratic National Committee, said Monday he's bowing out of the race -but he offered a warning to Democrats. 
Dean, the former presidential candidate and governor of Vermont, is expected to win the DNC chairmanship at the elec­tion Feb. 12. 
Roemer, a former congress­man from Indiana and a mem­ber of the Sept. 11 commission, said Democrats must be more inclusive in their outreach to fast-growing parts of the coun­try. 
"I got into this race five weeks ago to talk about the devastating loss we experienced in November,'' Roemer said in an interview. "It was not about 60,000 votes in Ohio. It was about losing 97 of the 100 fastest growing counties in the country. If that's a trend in busi­ness or politics you're in trou­ble." 
Republicans are in the strongest position they've been in since the early 20th century, Roemer said. 
Roemer, who said top Democrats in Congress encour­aged him to enter the chair­man's race, said he wants to strengthen Democrats' position on national security. 
"If there's one reason Senator Kerry lost the presidential race, it was because he failed to make the American people feel safer," Roemer said, adding that he also wanted to encourage talk within the party about develop­ing a stronger position on val­ues. 
Roemer said he hoped to make the party more inclusive, especially on the issue of abor­tion. He opposes abortion except in cases of rape, incest and the health of the mother. 
His opposition to abortion rights sparked early opposition in the race from abortion choice advocates. 


Witness gives suprise testitnony 
Retired stuntman says Blake complained about relationship with wife 
Associated Press 
LOS ANGELES-A key pros­ecution witness who was expected to say that Robert Blake solicited the murder of his wife testified Monday that the actor never directly asked him to murder Bonny Lee Bakley. 
Gary McLarty, a retired stunt­man, also acknowledged he was a heavy user of cocaine and had experienced paranoid delusions that people were tun­neling under his house, that he was being chased by police and was being watched by satel­lites. 
Under prosecution question­ing, McLarty said Blake com­plained to him about his wife, showed him where she lived at his home, and pointed out a place where "someone could go up the stairs at night and pop her." 
Asked by the prosecutor if Blake led him to believe he wanted him to commit the crime, McLarty said, "It was obvious." But at another point McLarty said, "I insinuated it." 
At a preliminary hearing, McLarty had testified Blake solicited the killing of his wife. 
Defense attorney M. Gerald Schwartzbach pressed McLarty on Monday about what Blake had really said. 
"Mr. Blake never actually said he wanted you to do something to Bonny Bakley at that time?'' asked Schwartzbach.

Bakley, 44. was shot May 4, 2001, in Blake's car near a restaurant where the couple dined. The 71-year-old former "Baretta" TV star is charged with murder, soliciting others to commit a murder and lying in wait in the 2001 shooting death of Bakley, the woman he married after learning he had fathered her baby.

It is unclear what lhwrson's future assoeiation with Notre Damn will hi\ Storin said. 
Duerson has bonn outspoken about Notm Danw f(JOtball in tho past y1lar. Last spring. tho Monogram Club wrote a nlsponse to a letter writtlln by a group of' Not!'ll Dame alumni that criticized tlw way the football program was managnd. In the letter written by tho Monogram Club. the group rlainwd tbat the alumni letter should have never been rnleasml to the media bm:ause it hurt the University's image, impedlld the ovl'rall administration of the University and athletic dcpart­nwnt and negatively all'ected nw­entw resourcPs. 
Duerson told The Observer in April that pooplc nlleded to move on from Notro Dame's 5-7 finish in 20<n. 
"1-:very program has il'i ups and downs, but that is not indicative of tlw dirnction the program L'> head­ing" lw said in the April 23 edi­tion. "It's tinw to move on [from tho criticism]. Nobody is more upset about last year's finL'ih than those student-athletes and the coaching stall'." 
lhwrson also responded to Notrn Dame's 1956 Ileisman Trophy winner Paul Hornung's comments about Notre Dame's standards. 
"We can't stay as strict as we arn as far as the academic struc­ture is eoncerned because gutta get the blaek athlete," Hornung. who later apologized, told Detroit's AM-1270 The Sports Station. an ESPN radio alliliate in March. "We must gp,t the blaek athlete if we're going to compete." 
Duerson responded ·to llornung's commenl'i by saying he should lose his job as a radio broadea.'iter for Notre Dame foot­ball. llornung was later fired lhHn his broadcasting position. 
Duerson spokn out most rnccnt­ly al'tnr Notre Dame football coach Tyrone Willingham was fired in NovembP.r after a 6-5 season. describing a decision that was madP. with great "dissension." 
"With all the other things going on at the University, the least of' the problems was wins and loss­es," he told the Associated Press in December. 'There's greater dis­sension in some other things at tho University that need to be eor­rceted and dealt with." 
Duerson, who now resides in llighland Park. Ill., was a two-time All-American defensive back at Notre Dame, where he played from 1979-1983, and still holds the all-time record for career interception yardage. lie served as tri-captain of the 1982 Irish. lie WP.nt on to win two Super Bowls 
· in the NFL f(Jr the Chicago Bears (lY85), and the New York Gianl'i (1990). He earned four all-Pro honors in his 11 seasons with the Bears, Giants and Phoenix Cardinals.

Duerson also sponsored free foot­ball camps in Chicago and his hometown of Muncie, Ind., teach­ing fundamentals of the game and stressing the values of education and drug and alcohol prevention. 

After football, Duerson went back tu school. graduating from the llarvard Business School's exeeutive education program in 2001.

Following the sale, a part­nership with Johnsonville Sausage, LLC was ereated, and the new Duerson Foods plant opened in April 2003.

Priest convicted in sex abuse case 
A.ssocitcd Press 
CAMBHIDGE, Mass. Defrocked priest Paul Shanley, the most notorious figure in the sex scandal that rocked the Boston Arehdiocese, was con­vietcd Monday of repeatedly raping and fondling a boy at his Homan Catholic ehurch during the 1980s. 
The conviction on all four charges gives proseeutors an important victory in their effort to bring pedophile priests to justice for decades of abuse at parishes around the eountry. 
Shanley, 7 4, could get life in prison for two counts each of child rape and indecent assault and battery on a child when he is sentenced Feb. 15. His bail was revoked and he was imme­diately led off to jail. 
The victim, now 27, put his head down and sobbed as the verdicts were announced after a trial that turned on the relia­bility of what the man claimed were recovered memories of the long-ago abuse. Shanley showed no emotion as he stood next to his lawyer. 
The jury deliberated 13 hours over three days. During the trial, the accuser broke down on the stand as he 

testified in graphic detail that Shanley pulled him out of Sunday morning cateehism classes and molested him in the bathroom, the rectory, the con­fessional and the pews starting when he was 6 and continuing for six years. 
"He told me nobody would ever believe me if I told any­body," he testified. 
The accuser said that he repressed his memories of the abuse but that they came flood­ing back three years ago, trig­gered by news coverage of the scandal that began in Boston and soon engulfed the church worldwide.

Executive Committee of the Election Committee of the Judicial Council to hold a hearing to assess the violation and whether sanctions should be levied before the results could be officially announced. 
Anderson explained that a message supporting the Baron-Shappell ticket was sent to the Alliance-ND/GSA [Gay-Straight Alliance] ListServ by AllianeeND presi­dent Mac Russell at 11:54 
p.m. Sunday. Though e-mails alone are permissible forms of campaigning, Article 17, Section 1 of the student union constitution details that ListServ messages are not. The constitution later speci­fies that candidates may be held responsible for the con­duct of their supporters. 
Though the Election Committee, made up of dele­gates for each of the 27 dorms, found merit to the allegation, and the six-mem­ber Executive Committee ruled that the ticket was guilty of the violation, no sanctions were assessed. 
"[The Executive Committee) decided no sanetion was appropriate because it is diffi­cult for candidates to control people that they didn't know

Shappell confirmed that nP-i­

visit. 
"Neither Dave nor I were

she said. 
Anderson said she sent a 
message to the Office of 
Information Teehnology to be 
forwarded to all ListServ own­
ers, letting them know that 
they cannot use the ListServ 
as an avenue for campaign­
ing. 
Baron-Shappell secured the plmality of votes by winning 11 dorms and the off-campus votes -including their respective home turfs of Morrissey and Badin. Leito­Bongiovanni won 10 dorms, including the loyalty of their own dorms, Siegfried and Cavanaugh. The Craig Brede­Vijay Ramanan. Alec White­Erik Powers and Mark Ilealy­Bob Costa tickets shared the remainder of the dorm victo­ries. 
Both advancing tickets said that while they're relieved by Monday's results, they expect a tough three days ahead, as the four candidates who have worked closely together in student government clash. 
"The results are great, but we're ready to go again. We've got three more days. and less than 300 votes isn't a margin of confidence," Baron said. 
Leito -vice president on Charlie Ebersol's tieket that made it to the runoff' in last year's election-agreed. 
"It's always exciting to make it past the general election, but this is going to be a tough one," he said. 
They all said they plan to stick to their \ried and true campaign strategies, focusing mainly on the grassroots effort to build support, nspe­cially sinee none of the losing tickets chose to givP. nitlwr of the tickets their endorse­ments. 
Candidates pointed toward their common experience and passion as kindling for what they expect to be a lwated sprint to the finish. 
"Voters are going to get a great show." Bongiovanni said with a smile.

Diversity should unite America 
I was doing my laundry at the laun­dromat last week because I like bigger washers and dryers than most places have. Also, I happen to be a big fan of throwing all of my laundry into gigan­tic washing machines arid getting my ridiculous amounts of laundry done in Tom Rippinger record time. The laundromat being Confessions of the multicultural and a Campus diverse income back­Conservative ground environment it is, I began to think about multicul­turalism and the recent efforts at Notre Dame to push it. 
Since I was dumb enough to forget to bring something to read while my laundry was being washed. I began to think about the roots of multicultural­ism. Although many may consider me a heartless conservative, I do take into account 500 years of western world dominance. Of course, the icing on the colonialism cake came in the past cen­tury with apartheid, the holocaust, segregation and a spattering of proxy wars fought in the third world in which the United States and the Soviet Union used these nations as pawns in a game of bilateral global dominance. 
For the past few hundred years, the world outside of the west has had some pretty raw deals in the games of international power struggles. Now, the formerly oppressed have the advantage of using the ideas of liberty originating from enlightenment thinkers to their advantage. In today's reality, the world's largest democracy is India and every nation is connected through a complex global economy. 
In the backdrop of these world events, there is of course a special guilt placed on the United States. We were supposed to live up to a higher standard, but it was not until the past century that we really sought to become a colorblind society. All of this I realize and personally lament, but it must be taken with a grain of salt. 
I was thinking of this and many other things when I was trying to get to the roots of the multiculturalist movement and its politically correct supporters. As far as I can logically reason, l believe they feel the same guilt for the aforementioned history. Out of their guilt comes the modern multiculturalist agenda. Perhaps they felt guilt over the more quiet racism of the north. which was almost as effec­tive but less messy than its southern counterpart. The guilt brings out the culture of over the top political cor­rectness we saw in the '90s. It also made it en vogue for a university to have an equal spattering ol' every race in its brochures. 
What happened to the colorblind constitution of Brown v. Board of Education? Why would an equal spat­tering of races and sexual preferences make Notre Dame any better if you truly believe that skin color and sexual preference are irrelevant? The multi­culturalist game seems to be very inclusive with the exception of white kids. Our culture is already fairly well known and it just doesn't look good in university public relations campaigns. We're too culturally homogeneous to create a true university environment and everyone knows we are "born with silver spoons in our mouths" anyway. 
Let's pretend I represent a university or a large institution. "Hmm, Tom, it seems like you could stand to see a lit­tle bit more diversity," a multicultural­ist would bemoan. Let's say he equally distributes all of my friends with peo­ple of every race with different cul­tures and skin colors. Does that make me a better person? Would it not depend on totally the content of the characters of the people I would hang out with, regardless of their skin color? 
Getting back to the laundromat, I can compare the dynamics of a laun­dromat to the United States. People of all different races go to the !au nd ro­mat to try and accomplish a similar objective of washing laundry. In the United States, this objective would be acquiring the American dream of a house in the suburbs, an SUV and the average two kids. The situation is com­pletely random and race does not even rmter the equation, but everyonE' has a similar goal. I didn't care that the guy next to me was black and there was a Ilispanic family doing laundry as well. We all just wanted to get our clothes washed. 
I bt~lieve that if WP focus on what wP have in common instl~ad of ttws<' cheesy diversity weeks. we can mak<' far greater steps toward a colorblind society. We're all people with similar feelings and desires. As long as the truth that "all men are created equal" is accepted, there should be reason for nothing but optimism. Simply following the "golden rule" consistently is enough to end racism in itself. That's why I advocate a death of the self­loathing fake multiculturalism that pervades universities around the coun­try and a rebirth of practicing simple virtues in everyday interaction.

Mediocrity rampant at Super Bowl 
lETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Abstain from storming the court 
Today, llw Notre Dame men's basketball team has a very important ganw against Boston College (or "Backup College" as Justin Tuck prdnrs). Wlwn. and I do mean when. our embattled band of Irishmen dd'l!at number live. undefeated and overrated Boston College, I strongly urge my fellow students and fans to not sturm to the court in ePlebration. 
Normally, a victory at home over a top l 0 team warrants a court storming. llowever, in the case of Boston College. normal conventions must b1! set aside. As Notre Dame Students we must be deliant and not storm the court as a display of our common despise for that institu­tion. 
l.nt us not forget that this is the same school that greedily and hypo­critically stabbed Notro Dame and the rest of the Big East in the back when it fled to the ACC not long ago. They left the conference scram­bling just days after denouncing similar moves made by Miami and Virginia Tech. 
This is also the same sehoul that claims to be our rival in football based solnly on four consecutive last second wins over two of our pro­gram's worst head coaches. Let us also not forget the disrespect their football players have shown to Notre Dame by ripping large clumps of grass out of our hallowed stadium in celebration. 
This is the same school that also claims to be our academic counter­part in the world of higher education for reasons that I cannot com­prehend. 
The point is that Boston College wants desperately to be Notre flame, to he our rival and be our peer both academically and athleti­cally. The truth is that they aren't even close. I therefore urge all stu­dents to defiantly abstain from storming the court following the Irish victory. Such an action only legitimizes their claim to be our rival. Backup College dnsnrvi!S an "overrated" chant coupled with a few "We are NDs." I'd rather save the storming for Oct. 15.

Do not support Coke 
Hecently students have been debating the merits and faults of the new Coca-Cola dorm competition and some very good questions have been asked. But we would like to bring to light another side of this debate that has as of yet not been dis­cussed: Coca Cola's human rights abuses. 
First and foremost. let us recall that as membnrs of the Notre Dame community each of us is a beneficiary of the Coca-Cola Corporation. either through general dona­tions to the University or by way of individ­ual scholarships and grants. As beneficiar­ies we are all called to understand the nature of our benefactor and to investigate the means by which it procures the resources that are ultimately used to build our dorms and fund our research. 
We would like to outline the facts about just a few of the abuses committed by the Coca-Cola Corporation. In sp doing we ask: do we deserve to enjoy the comforts of Coca-Cola's relationship with our University at the expense of the lives and livelihoods of others? More specifically, can we con­done such a situation and even go so far as to participate in it? 
Some of the worse abuses have been committed in Colombian bottling plants·, resulting in the death of at least 13 work­ers. A lawsuit filed against Coca-Cola charges that it "contracted with or other­wise directed paramilitary security forces that utilized extreme violence and mur­dered, tortured and unlawfully detained or otherwise silenced trade union leaders." Guatemalan workers have suffered in simi­lar ways. 
Coca-Cola benefits from child labor that takes place under hazardous conditions. In El Salvador for instance. thousands of chil­dren. some as young as eight years old. are working on sugarcane plantations where they often suffer from severe machete wounds. smoke inhalation and burns. 
Coke's bottling practices in India have caused water shortages and groundwater pollution. Entire communities have been exposed to toxic levels of waste and pesti­cides. In addition. Coke's bottling plants draw so much water from the wells and groundwater sources that the local water supplies are depleted to the extnnt that thousands of farmers are left with an inad­equate supply for their own agricultural uses. These practices have not only poi­soned the inhabitants of thesn regions. but also deprived thousands of local farmers of their livelihoods. Similar abuses have taken place in Mexico and Ghana. 
We choose not to participate in the Coca­Cola dorm competition because we believe it is more important to ensure that all pno­ple have the right to healthy, dignified lives than it is to secure profits and share their comforts with a select few. As consumers we understand that "money" can mean "approval." We have decided to withhold our approval and we invite you to join with us in abstaining from this competition. Stand in solidarity with workers and com­munities around the world who are no less deserving of Coca-Cola's beneficence than we arc. 
More information about Coke's human rights abuses and how to take further action can be found at www.cokewatch.org and www.killercuke.org.

For $80,000 a second, they could at least make it good. But the only 2005 Super Bowl ads worth watching are the ones that didn't run. 
Snvnral of the spots, which FOX sold for a record $2.4 mil­lion per 30 seconds, Rob Howard never made it on the air -some were too 
Syracuse
negative, others too 
University
risque. So with all 
Daily Orange 
tlw good stuff swept 
under the rug, most of this year's ads wnre car commer­cials. rnovin previews and self-paro­
dies. 
FOX blocked a campaign that would have fueled the beer war between Miller and Anheuser-Busch. asserting that Miller's anti-Bud ads were too negative to show during the game. Anheuser-Busch is the Super Bowl's exclusive beer sponsor and the biggest advertising customer with five min­utes of airtime. 
Those five minutes were mostly mediocre Bud Light ads, one of which filled the first post-kickoff spot. As if to say, "lley, dude, we're extreme," that ad featured a reluctant skydiver who took the plunge after his pilot dove out of the plane in pursuit of a dropped Bud Light bottle. (It is physi­cally impossible for him to catch up to that bottle, unless Spider-Man is somehow involved.) 
Miller, a distant second to Anheuser­Busch in the domestic beer market, still ran a few spots during the pre­game show and tried to purchase local airtime, but the brewery was effec­tively locked out of advertising to the nation's largest audience. 


So, new Super Bowl rule No. 1: no competing with our sponsors. Next on the list: no fun of any kind. 
Anheuser-Busch pulled one of its ads because it harkened back to Janet Jackson's nipple-bar­ing extravaganza, the root of all this self-censorship. The spot, which would have been far and away the fun­niest of the game, showed a frustrated Jackson throwing down her outfit a few minutes before half­time. Then a backstage employee grabbed a frosty Bud Light and tore the bosom of her costume to open the bottle. Let's just say he didn't have much time to fix the damage. 
Too soon, Bud Light. Too soon. 

In a more reasonable move, Ford pulled an ad about a priest's lust for the new Lincoln Mark l:r. The priest found a key to the new SUV in 
the collection box and ogled it in the parking lot for a few awkward moments before its owner and his small daughter showed up to claim the vehicle. The 
scene cuts to the priest adding the letters L and T to the new 
message on the marquee board: "LUST." Not real­ly funny, but def­initely weird. 
The worst repercussion of the priest's 
banishment was that Ford filled the gaps with its awful Mustang spot. In the ad, a police car pulls up 
behind a red convertible waiting at a 
green light in a barren tundra. For some reason 
the cop sees nothing weird about this, so he 

waits behind the ear and honks his horn before finally investigat­ing. He finds the driver frozen solid with a look of euphoria preserved on his icy face. The message: we're not even putting 
this car on the market until spring, 
because our consumers are so dumb 
they'd drive it around the Artie Circle. 
The funny ads that made it on the air were all parodies of themselves. In other words, Super Bowl ads suck so much that the only creativity comes when they remind you of their sucki­ness. 
Fedex Kinko's hilariously demon­strates the top 10 necessities for a good Super Bowl ad. Among them: Groin kicks. Burt Heynolds and several instances of talking, dancing bears. And the ad fur a domain registrar called GoDaddy.com takes place at a Federal Communications Commission hearing, where a busty coed pleads for permission to be on TV. 
The most ridiculous self-parody came from Budweiser-in a throw­back to last year's donkey-becomes-a­Ciydesdale ad, Bud introduces several other animals (from giraffe to pig) with the same goal. But it makes no sense if you don't have last year's ad at the front of your mind, and even then it's barely funny. 
So mark 2005 down as the beginning of the end for Super Bowl advertising. Almost everyone who bought a spot wasted their money, and the rampant censorship was more embarrassing than the banned ads could ever be.

DVD REVIEWS 
'Best of Fallon' collects comedian's finest moments 
By KELLY DUOOS Scene Critic 
Jimmy Fallon built up quite a fan base on Saturday Night Live because of his ability to consistently deliver fresh faced performances week after week. Breaking into the late night scene in 1998, this featured player achieved cast member status and contributed to the show until his departure in 2004. His inability to keep a straight face has helped him charm viewers with his infectious smile and lovable personali­ty. 
Rarely a SNL scene-stealer, Fallon often times is not the shining star of his sketches. Instead, he graciously pro­vides a solid comedic foundation to glo­rify a hostlng celebrity or an off-the­wall cast member. The sketches on this DVD are evenly split between Jimmy's supporting and starring roles. This col­lection highlights his comedic ability where it might otherwise have been overshadowed. 
While on Saturday Night Live, Fallon had the chance to develop some origi­nal characters that have stood the test of time. The best are showcased in this collection and include: Jarret. a third­time college junior who hosts a web cast show from his dorm room; Sully, a teenage Red Sox fan who has the ten­dency to become extremely angry; and the Leatherman, who creepily dresses head to toe in leather. 

From his performances, it is evident that Fallon grew up idolizing the play­ers of Saturday Night Live, since his impersonation skills are quite impres­sive. The DVD's opening clip is the unforgettable 'sketch that takes place in Mick Jagger's dressing room, in which Fallon plays a feisty reflection of the real Rolling Stone. Though Darrell Hammond's Sean Connery steals the spotlight in the Celebrity Jeopardy sketch, Fallon's dead-on impression of former SNL player Adam Sandler deserves recognition. His knack for creating these truly remarkable carica­tures is appreciated in a montage of various clips of celebrity impressions. 
However, Fallon's most hilarious moments have arguably come while he has played his most natural character: 
himself. Combining for­ces with SNL writer Tina Fey proved a success, and the two took Weekend Update by storm in the fall of 2000. "SNL's Best of Jimmy Fallon" contains clips of the two executing their biting commentary on current events. To end the featured program, the co-anchors perform a heartfelt duet before Fallon narrates a Star Wars type story of hope and tragedy that will leave the viewer in stitches. 

Since this is a DVD, bonus features have of course been obligatorily includ­ed. Fallon's audition tape for his spot on Saturday Night Live is priceless. He shows off his impersonation skills dur­ing a celebrity walk-a-thon and spoofs popular music with the help of his gui­tar. However, the other bonus features fail to live up to SNL potential. The Weekend Update camera test with Fey is pretty lifeless and the inclusion of the "Drinkin' in the Woods" dress rehearsal sketch makes it obvious why it was cut from the live episode. The mediocre music video for the single "Idiot Boyfriend" and Fallon's perform­ance on the Carson Daly show round out the bonus features. Let this be a lesson: sometimes less is more. 
However disappointing a few of the extras might be, the new "Best of Jimmy Fallon" is a must-have for DVD collectors and casual fans of the pro­gram alike. It shows how his six years spent with Saturday Night Live have earned him stardom.

Visual splendor lifts 'Sky Captain' above its genre 
broadcasts of that age will find some­thing familiar and nostalgic about the movie. 
There is a downside to the nature of the movie however. This is not a typical action film and expecting it to be filled with the cliched ·look of an action film would be a disservice. Calling the movie cheesy, and the plot contrived would be valid criticisms, but would also be a dis­service to the point of the movie. For many films of the film, those would be part of the reasons why it works so well as a tribute to old radio programs. 
The actors do a commendable job, considering their unique situation. All of their actions are performed in front of a blue screen, so they have to react to things that do not exist. Jude Law does a great job in his role of the Sky Captain, acting serious on call and hamming it up when necessary as well. Gwyneth Paltrow gives a commendable perform­ance as the reporter covering the Sky Captain's exploits. Both act convincingly in front of the blue screen and meld into th.e .computer generated backgrounds well. 
The rest of the cast perform admirably 
against the blue screen as well. Indeed, it's often quite difficult to separate the computer­generated extras from the flesh-and-blood ones. If any one movie will be remembered for blending what is real and fake, this is it. 
A significant amount of time went into creating this movie, and it shows in the special features on the DVD. There are com-

It's not every day that a movie is jaw­droppingly beautiful. "Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow" is one of the rare movies where every scene looks like a work of art. Which in a way, they were. 
The first thing that should be known about the film is that every scene was filmed in front of a blue screen. That means that every background was creat­ed on a computer, digitally worked upon so that every pixel is perfect. This in turn creates some truly spectacular images never before seen on film. The visuals can even be described as breath­taking, a trait that not many movies can claim. 
The movie is based on the radio broad­casts and stories of the early 1900s. That means that a new amazing image is pre­sented every couple of minutes. Giant robots, flying fortresses and genetically created monsters grace the silver screen in all their computer-generated glory. Anyone with even the slightest bit of knowledge of the cartoons, comics and with each progressive sce.ne. Do not make the mistake that millions did by not seeing this movie. It is unfortunate the movie bombed in the box office, as it would have been great to see more of the Sky Captain's exploits. This movie is a unique gem, unlikely to be imitated anytime soon.

Pow-erful perfortnances drive 'Million Dollar' success 
By BRIAN DOXTADER 
Scene Critic 
Who would 'vn thought that the great­Pst ~~ra of' Clint Eastwood's career would comP this latn? A nno-rnnaissance that hogan with "Unforgiven" continued with "Midnight in tlw Garden of Good and Evil" and "Mystic Bivnr." IIis latest liiJn, "Million Dollar Baby," is one of' the best liiJns or 2004 and another winner in the sanw vnin of nxecll1~nce as Eastwood's prnvious work. 
Eastwood has aged with remarkable graen, and "Million Dollar Baby" is a bnautil'ul, unpretentious. difficult l'ilm that sonwhow manages to remain in an undnrstatnd minor kny despite its sub­jPct mattfH·.' The plot revolves around Maggio Fitzgnrald 
"Raging Bull" than "Hocky," it is handled with technical finesse that creates a sur­prising amount of tension -unlike most sports movies, the boxing itself is clearly not the main drive. Instead, the !lim is concerned with its characters and the underlying themes of the plot. Boxing here is not the focus of the plot, but a device used to explore the plot and nuances of the characters. 
Though his talents are manifold and well employed here, Eastwood's greatest skill as a director is his ability to evoke powerful performances; "Million Dollar Baby" more than upholds this tradition. Swank's portrayal of Maggie is pitch­perfect: tough, strong-headed and yet utterly believable. Expect her to walk away with the Oscar come Feb. 27. 
Likewise, Freeman's one-eyed gym 
assistant Eddie is

hncause she is an older woman, he eventually agrees and the two begin working toward the wel­tnrweight championship. 
In ways, the film seems a contradic­tion: it initially appears to be one of the most simplistic major movies made by llollywood last year, but it eventually rPveals itself to be one of the most com­plnx. "Million Dollar Baby" is far more than a simple story. It is well told and it rnveals itself in the fight scenes. More 
soul. His portray­al of Frankie is perhaps the most inter­nalized of the actor's storied career, and while the film doesn't resolve or spell out Frankie's past, inferences can be made from Eastwood's performance to com­prehend him as a character. In a time when Hollywood seems to be spiraling out of control in its attempts at overblown epics peppered with vacuous special effects, the film's minimalism and character-driven pl_ot is a welcome thange. By the end of'the lilm, the audi­ence cares very much for all of its char­acters. The film paints a stark and inti­mate portrait that examines not just one, but several unforgettable individuals. 

If asked to describe "Million Dollar Baby" in one word, a typical answer might be "dark." And this would not be an unreasonable response; the film is very dark, both literally (through its excellent cinematography) and figura­tively (through its thematic elements). 
A better word to describe Eastwood's latest film, however, is "true." This story is true to itself, true to its plot, true to its characters. Even the controversial end­ing is true in a way that few Hollywood lilms would dare to bn. Whether one dis­agrees with how it ends, in this situation with these characters, it's the only logi­cal conclusion and Eastwood handles it un!linchingly. 
It doesn't quite reach the heights of "Unforgiven," but it also doesn't aspire to do so. With that film. Eastwood seemed to have something to prove, with "Million Dollar Baby" it is obvious that he made the film he wanted to make. As a result, it ends up being his most inti­mate to date and an instant classic in line with his previous achievements.

While LSU swept all 44 first­place votes from a national media panel and the top six teams remained the same, UW­Green Bay joined at No. 24. The Phoenix (20-2) came in on the strength of a 14-game winning streak, the fourth-longest in the country. 
"We're moving up," UWGB coach Kevin Borseth said. "That's a good thing. That's what we want to do. Certainly it wasn't a goal of ours to get there and be happy and then get bumped out. We want to keep moving up." 
The Phoenix did that the last time they were ranked. They joined the poll for the llrst time in school history on Dec. 16. 2002, and stayed in the rest of the season. rising to as high as 16th. That team finished 28-4, the best ever for the program. 
"I don't know if the polls will be quite as kind this tiine around," Borseth said. "We need to solidify our position a little more. Ultimately we want to get into the national tourna­ment and see what we can do." .

Despite changes, Patriots' goal is to repeat 

Associated Press 
JACKSONVILLE. Fla. -Deion Branch needed just five little words to explain why the New England Patriots have won three of the last four Super Bowls. 
Asked Monday if he had any thoughts of leaving the team when he becomes a restricted free agent, the Super Bowl MVP 
replied:  "My  home  is  in  
Foxboro."  
Then,  referring  to  team  

owner Robert Kraft, Branch added: "J'm-proud of the family that Mr. Kraft has built." 
An emphasis on winning over money is what drives the Patriots to success in an era when free agency and the salary cap force major turnover at most teams each season. 
Next season's Patriots certain­ly will be different than this season's. The biggest losses are not players but coaches: Offensive coordinator Charlie Weis is the new head coach at Notre Dame, and defensive coordinator Romeo Crennel accepted the Cleveland Browns' head coaching job immediately after Sunday night's game. 
Crennel's move, which gives the NFL a record six black head coaches, was hardly a secret. As the Patriots' 24-21 win over Philadelphia was ending, coach Bill Belichick put his arms around his two top aides in a gesture of affection and appre­ciation. 
They will be hard to replace. 
"Romeo and Charlie have done a great job. A lot of the success we've had should go to them," Belichick said Monday. 'Tv~ been with them both a long time. I go back to 1981 with Romeo and I'll miss both of them a lot." 
The Patriots might, too. 

Next season, they will be seeking to become the first team to win three straight Super Bowls and the first to win four in five seasons. 
The San Francisco 49ers came closest to three NFL titles in a row, winning the 1989 and 1990 Super Bowls, then losing the next NFC championship game on a last-second field goal by the New York Giants' Matt Bahr. 
That New York team, which went on to beat Buffalo in the 1991 Super Bowl, had a coach­ing staff headed by Bill Parcells and including Belichick, Crennel and Weis, along with future NFL head coaches Tom Coughlin, AI Groh and Ray Handley. 1\vo of the players on that team are also coaches and are reportedly on Crennel's wish list for his staff with the Browns: Pepper Johnson, New England's defensive line coach, and Maurice Carthon, the offen­sive coordinator in Dallas under Parcells. 
Belichick's first order of busi­ness, therefore, is rebuilding his coaching staff, although he will take at least a week off, travel-ing to California for the AT&T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am. 

Most of the core players, how­ever, should be back, although some are getting up there in age, notably linebacker Willie McGinest and safety Rodney 
Harrison, both of whom have 
played major roles in the team's 
success. 

Harrison, who had two inter­ceptions in Sunday's game, will "turn 33 next December, when 
McGinest will turn 34. 
One member of the Patriots unlikely to return is cornerback Ty Law. who missed the second half of the season with a broken foot after quarreling with the team over his contract in train­ing camp.

Pacific moved into The 
Associated Press men's college 
basketball Top 25 for the first 
time in school history. Monday 
thanks to a perfect start in the 
Big West. 

While !llinois was No. 1 in

for the second time in a row, 
l'acilic joined the rankings at 
No. 24. 

The Tigers. (18-2), who have won 14 straight games, arc 12­0 in the Big West and off to their best start. Their only losses this season were at Kansas and to San Francisco, and they have a school-record 25-game winning streak in conference play. 
"It's great for our town and our school and our players," coach Bob Thomason said Monday. "They worked hard the last two years. I think they were a little disappointed they didn't get in last Monday. Now we have to go to Idaho and Utah State. As soon as we get ranked, we have to go play our hardest game of the year. but that's a good challenge for us."

Connecticut sends Syracuse to its third loss 
Villanova wins match of Philly teams as the Wildcats knock off St. Joseph's 
Associated Press 
SYHACUSE, N.Y. -Charlie 
Villanueva experienced tho ups 
and downs of college bask1~tball 
in three days. 
The sophomore forward had one of his worst games in Connecticut's win over St. .John's on Saturday. On Monday night. he had 21 points, 10 rebounds and several big plays to lead the 19th-ranked I luskics lo a 74-66 victory over No. 8 Syracuse. ending the Orange's I l1-game home winning streak. 
"This was a huge win for us," he said. "For me personally, it was as huge as it gets. This was a big game in a tough place to play." 
Connecticut coach Jim Calhoun said Villanueva was in tlmrs after scoring three points on 1-for-5 shooting in the home win over the Hod Storm. 
"I told him if he plays hard good things will happen for him and then for us." Calhoun said. 
Conrwcticut closed the game with a 9-1 run and Villanueva outscored Syracuse 7-5 over the final 8 minutes as the lluskies (15-5, 7-3 Big East) won for tho fourth time in five ganws. 
"Our young kids took over the ganw," Calhoun said of his starting lineup that features a junior, thr110 sophomores and a freshman. "We're fighting for our NCM life. Obviously, this is the best win we've had this sea­son. We're getting a little better. I believe in this team." 
Hakim Warrick had 16 points for the foul-plagued Orange (21-3, 8-2), who had won all 14 horne games this season. The last time Syracuse lost in the Carrier Dome was last Feb. 16 to Notre Dame. 
"We have been very good down the stretch, but every game down the stretch you're not always going to make the right plays or miss a shot or two and that's what happened," Syracuse coach Jim Boeheim said. "I thought we played as hard as we played all year." 
The game was a rnatchup of the last two national champi­ons, and the defending champs prevailed. It also matched two of the winningest coaches in the sport's history. Calhoun has 695 victories, two behind Boeheim. 
No. 22 Villanova 67, St. Joseph's 52 
Jason Fraser tries not to let his nagging injuries bother him. I le sure looked healthy Monday night. 
Fraser had 14 points and 14 rebounds, and No. 22 Villanova withstood a second-half rally by St. Joseph's for the victory. 
"It felt good just being able to do what's needed for the team," Fraser said. 

With the sweltering Palestra rocking in the latest meeting between these local rivals. the crowd at the famed home of the Big 5 saw another wild one in the series' 84-year history. 
Villanova (14-5) used a full­court press, hustling guard play and the best game of the season from the oft-injured Fraser to take a 21-point lead midway through the second half. 
Then Pat Carroll found his shot for the I lawks (11-9). 
St. Joe's leading scorer had a miserable first 30 minutes, missing all 13 of his shots and looking nothing like the two­time defending Atlantic 10 play­er of the week. Then it all came together for the 6-foot-5 senior, who nailed three 3-pointers and scored 13 of St. Joe's next 16 points during a run that sliced the lead to 49-40. 
The student sections taunted each other all night, but this was a pro-St. Joe's crowd and the fans cheered wildly with each basket. 
It was just too little, too late. 
The Wildcats hit a few free throws. Fraser fought his way through the middle for a tough inside basket and Allan Hay sank a 3-pointer that pushed the lead back to 61-44 and enabled them to hang on for their fifth win in six games.

Associated Press 
CLEVELAND -After winning another Super Bowl, New England's Mr. Do-It-All issued a warning to the rest of the NFL 
"Look out for Cleveland next year," said two-way standout Troy Brown. "They're getting a great coach." 
Romeo Crennel, who borrowed Brown from the Patriots' offense to play cornerback this season, accept· ed Cleveland's offer to be their next head coach Sunday, fulfilling the longtime assistant's lifelong dream. 
Crennel's agent, Joe Linta, arrived at the Browns' headquarters in sub­urban Berea on Monday morning and spent the day in contract negoti­ations with team president John Collins, the final step in making the 
IN BRIEF 
Canseco wreaks havoc with 
new book 
WASHINGTON -President Bush was not aware of any steroid use by Texas Rangers players while he was a team executive, the White House said Monday. 
In his upcoming book, Jose Canseco said he introduced Rafael Palmeiro, Ivan Rodriguez and Juan Gonzalez to steroids after being traded to Texas in 1992, the New York Daily News reported. Canseco said Bush, the Rangers' managing partner at the time, must have known about the drugs. 
White House press secretary Scott McClellan said he spoke to Bush about alleged steroid use. 
"If there was, he was not aware of it at the time," McClellan said. 
"He has recognized, for some time now, that steroids is a growing prob­lem in professional sports, particu­larly Major League Baseball," he said. "That's why the president has made addressing the issue a priority 57-year-old defensive coordinator the 11th full-time coach -and first full-time black coach -in Cleveland history. 
Linta, who was seeking a five-year deal for his client, was not immedi­ately available for comment. 
The Browns hope to introduce Crennel at a Tuesday afternoon press conference. 
His return to Cleveland -he was the Browns' defensive coordinator in 2000 -will cap an emotional few days for Crennel, who just won his third Super Bowl title with New England and the fifth of his career as one of the league's pre-eminent assistants. 
But now he'll be in charge of rebuilding the Browns, who are coming off a disastrous 4-12 season 
in his administration." 
Canseco's book, "Juiced: Wild Times, Rampant 'Raids. Smash Hits, and How Baseball Got Big," is sched­uled for release by Regan Books on Feb. 21. A company spokesman has said the date might be moved up. 
Palmeiro, now playing for Baltimore, dis_euted Canseco's claim. Racing Hall of Farner dies 
INDIANAPOLIS -Former car owner John Zink Jr., whose 13 champ car victories included the 1955 Indianapolis 500 with driver Bob Sweikert and the 1956 Indy race with Pat Flaherty, has died at 75. 
Zink, who was inducted into the Auto Racing Hall of Fame last May, died Saturday at a hospital in his hometown of Tulsa, Okla., the Speedway said Monday. 
Zink had at least one car in the Indianapolis 500 each year from 1952 to 1967. Besides Sweikert and Flaherty, his drivers included Jimmy Reece, Jerry Hoyt, Gene Hartley, Troy Ruttman, Jud Larson, Ed Elisian, Bob that included Butch Davis' resigna­tion on Nov. 30. Crennel is inheriting a team that has gone 30-66 since its expansion rebirth in 1999. Over the same span, the Patriots won consec­utive Super Bowls, three titles in four years and assured their place among the league's dynasties. 
Soon to be fitted with another Super Bowl ring, Crennel is ready for a new challenge. 
"Now I have an opportunity to take the next step, be in charge of a team, and see if I can be as success­ful as I have in the past," he said. 
Crennel's initial task in Cleveland will be assembling a coaching staff. He has reportedly chosen Maurice Carthon to be his offensive coordina­tor, prying him away from Bill Parcells and the Dallas Cowboys.

continued from page 24 
San Franeiseo (29-0) in a IJ3-82 win. 
Now. tlw Irish are in the middle of a four-ganw stretch against four ranked opporwnts, begin­ning with a loss to Syracuse Saturday and ending with a matchup in Pittsburgh Feb 12. 
As Mike Brey coaches his 300th career game (151 at Delaware; 148 at Notre Dame), the Irish are looking to repeat history while simultaneously making a statPment in the con­ference. 
Boston College is led by junior forward Craig Smith, who aver­agl~s 1S.IJ points and 8.3 rnbounds per game while shoot-ing 53.9 percent from the floor. The most pleasant surprise for the Eagles has been sophomore forward Jared Dudley, who is averaging 16.2 points and 7.2 rebounds. 

Notre Dame's fronteourt did improve over the past three games, with Torin Francis (9 .2 ppg) and Dennis Latimore {8.5 ppg) playing up to the physieal levrd that Big East games demand. Tlw three-point shoot­ing of Colin Falls ( 43 percent) and Chris Quinn (41.5 percent) has driven the Irish oll'nnse most of the season, but the success of both the interior and outside games is reliant on the play of senior point guard Chris Thomas 
(13.7 points, 6.4 assists per game.) 
Boston College has defeated Georgetown, Connecticut and Villanova -a few common opponents to the Golden Eagles and Irish. Boston College's 60-52 defeat of Seton Ilall Saturday made it the first team in the his­tory of the Big East to start a season with 20 straight wins. 
The Eagles have games against Syracuse, Villanova and Pittsburgh waiting on their remaining schedule. 
As of Feb. 2, ESPN.eom classi­fied Boston Colh1gn, Syracuse and Pittsburgh as "locks" to reach the NCAA tournament from the Big East. Notre Damn 
(60) has a lower HPI rating than Villanova, Georgetown and Connecticut, the three teams the Irish will most likely compete with for a spot in the Big Dance. The Irish are 2-2 against those three teams, with rematches against the Hoyas and Huskies remaining. And· the way Notre Dame fares in big-time Big East

State that helped launch them into the national doubles rank­ingc. 
The play of Langenkamp and Parbhu, on the other hand, has been a welcome surprise for the Irish. The duo has surpassed all expectations from both coaches and teammates. The pair's dou­bles record now stands at 9-2 this season at the No. 2 slot, including 6-1 in dual-match action. 
"In Eric's case. he deserves a lot of credit because it was not natural for him and he's really made great strides," Bayliss said. "He has terrific hands, he's very quick and he's developed a great feel for the doubles game. He's playing with Sheeva Parbhu, who is a less natural doubles player but really is a terrific athlete and a great competitor." 
The highlight for Langenkamp and Parbhu's consistent perform­ance this spring came against Florida State's Jeff Groslimond and Chris Westerhof, ranked at No. 32 nationally. The duo's 8-4 victory marked the first time either player topped a nationally-ranked doubles team. The dou­bles win was also the first for any Irish pair against a nationally­ranked team since D'Amico and Keckley's strong showing against Ohio State. 
"! think the win over Florida State has been the highlight so far," D'Amico said. "! thinkthat's the on~ match that everyone came together. It was a tough match and everyone fought hard and we ended up pulling that one out. Our No. 2 doubles team has been huge for us." 
At the No. 3 slot, Bass and King have shown flashes of brilliance for the Irish. Both players are highly-talented singles competi­tors who have played at the No. 2 and No. 3 singles slots, respec­tively, for much of the season. As they continue to shape their dou­bles teamwork, Bayliss sees a lot of potential in the duo's team­work. 
"The work in progress is at No. 3 and that's probably the most significant improvement of all," Bayliss said. "Barry and Stephen were 0-for-autumn in the fall. They didn't play particularly well, but through some real hard work focusing on their volleying skills and improvements in the serving area, they are becoming a pretty darn competent No. 3 team." 
Although the Irish have enjoyed a great deal of early suc­cess in doubles play, the team still feels that there's plenty of room for improvement. The team has dropped the doubles point in the last two matches, against No. 9 Duke and No. 34 Texas. If any­thing else, those losses just solidi­fy how important the doubles play has become to the Irish team dynamic .. 
"Anytime you're playing a top team in the country or a team that's comparable to our level, most of those matches will come down to a 4-3 or 5-2 finish," D'Amico said. "So that one point is huge and everyone can feel it. The break in between playing the singles and doubles matches is a lot different when you win the point as opposed to when you lose it." 
After playing four consecutive matches against nationally­ranked foes in the past few weeks, the Irish will have a little time to rest and reengineer their attack before next Sunday's match against Marquette. Bet on doubles play to continue to be a focus for the team's improvement as the season progresses.

currently holds all four school records in diving, and was named the Big East Championship's Most Outstanding Diver for the past two years. 
She won the conference title for the one-meter board in 2003, becoming the first diver from a school other than the University of Miami to take a Big East title since 1996. Last year, Perry-Eaton dominated the competition, claiming vic­tories off both the one and three-meter boards, each by more than 40 points. 
In her junior year, Perry­Eaton was named honorable mention All-America after fin­ishing ninth in the NCAA Championships in the one­meter competition. Last year, she finished third in the event, just a mere 3.30 points away from a national title. 
Her road has not been pain­free, though. 
Perry-Eaton was originally a swimmer, until, at the age of 13, she decided that diving would fit her personality bet­ter than swimming laps in a pool. The converted diver became a three-time diving

All-American in high school, and qualified for U.S. nation­als three times. 
But upon coming to Notre Dame as a freshman, the Brandon, Fla., native compet­ed in only two events before suffering a season-ending injury. 
The diver refused to get down, and completed an intense rehabilitation process, to return to the pool her soph­omore year. She was granted another year of eligibility because of the injury, and is now looking to make the most of the extra chance she was given. Since then, the fifth­year senior has earned an undergraduate degree in aerospace engineering, and is currently working on a mas­ters in mechanical engineer­ing. 
This season, Perry-Eaton has won 17 of the 18 competi­tions she has entered, and is 9-0 in three-meter diving. She has not been beaten off the higher board in a dual meet since November of 2002, claiming victory in 21 consec­

utive competitions. The fifth­year senior currently owns six of the top nine scores in three-meter diving in Irish history, and holds the Big East record on the one-meter board. 
After missing last summer's Olympic Diving Trials because of a broken foot, the five-time all-conference diver now has her sights set on a top-three finish off of both boards at this year's NCAA Championships. 
She is particularly motivated to do well in the three-meter competition after never plac­ing in the top-20 at the national level. 
Perry-Eaton and the rest of the Notre Dame women's swimming and diving team will take center stage at the Big East Championships, scheduled for Feb. 16-19. Then all eyes will turn to the NCAA Championships, set for March 17-19 in West Lafayette, Ind.

Irish look to knock offundefeated Boston College 
By PAT LEONARD Associate Sports Editor 
Notre Dame has a 5-4 confer­ence record, a desire to return to the NCAA tournament and only eight regular season games to prove that it deserves a postsea­son bid. So, at arguably the most crucial point in Notre Dame's season, the Irish are hosting an undefeated. No. 5 nationally ranked team in the Joyce Center tonight. 
Notre Dame (13-6, 5-4}, who sits on the bubble of most post­season predictions, including those of ESPN.com. hosts Big East foe No. 5 Boston College (20-0, 9-0) tonight at 7 p.m. While the past 20 teams have failed against the Golden Eagles, the Irish hope having history on their side can help them succeed. 
The last time Notre Dame host­ed an undefeated team with 20­plus wins, the Irish beat No. 1 DePaul (25-0) in a 76-74 double­overtime victory on Feb. 27, 1980. Just three years prior, Notre Dame knocked off No. 1

MEN'S TENNIS 
Improved doubles play helps team 
By RAMA GOTTUMUKKALA 
Sports Writer 

The well-known maxim of "if you fall short, get up and try again" can be applied to any aspect of individual or team sports. But it can cPrtainly explain the resurgence of the doubles play for the Notre Dame men's tennis team. trans­forming a liabili:y last year into an ever-growing strength this spring. . 
The Irish, who claimed the doubles point just 10 times in 23 attempts last season, have won the doubles point in five of their eight spring matches. Not surprisingly, the Irish have a 5­0 record in those matches. 
After only sporadic success in doubles matches over the past few years, the Irish coaching staff targeted the team's dou­bles play as a key area for improvement. 
"We've really worked hard on our doubles," head coach Bobby Bayliss said. "It was cer­tainly not a strength in the fall. I just think that the guys deserve a lot of credit. They've put a lot of time in and we've spent an inordinate amount of time in practice on our dou­bles." 
The Irish have relied on three principal duos to drive their doubles success this spring. Senior captain Brent D'Amico and sophomore Hyan Keckley have faced some tough compe­tition at the No. I slot. In thP last four matches, the two play­ers competed against two top­15 doubles opponents. Junior Eric Langenkamp and fresh­man Sheeva Parbhu have occu­pied the No. 2 slot. with sopho­mores Barry King and Stephen Bass rounding out the doubles teams at the No. 3 slot. 
"We have two very natural doubles players on our team. Brent D'Amico and Ryan Keckley," Bayliss said. "Eric Langenkamp has become a great doubles player. It was not natural for him and he did not play doubles as a freshman." 
D'Amico and Keckley are no strangers to the doubles spot­light. The pair posted strong victories last year, including an 8-6 upset of No. 26 Joey Atas and Jeremy Wurtzman of Ohio

Cowan hopes to make 6-foot jump 
Irish All-American 
hopes to join the elite 
jumpers in the NCAA 
By RYAN KIEFER Sports Writer 
Two weeks ago Stacey Cowan ran down the high jump runway, leapt and cleared the bar. This was not 
--surprising for Notre Dame's All-American high jumper, who had just cleared a season best 1.80 meters (5 feet, 10 3/4 inches). What Irish coach Scott Winsor told her after the jump was quite a surprise to Cowan. "That would have easily cleared six feet," Winsor told his star high jumper. Six feet, 1.829 meters, 72 inches. 
Whatever you call this height, Stacey Cowan now knows she can clear it, and this is the stated goal for Notre Dame's top high jumper. 
Clearing six feet would place Cowan among the elite high jumpers in the NCAA. and would take Cowan to what Winsor refers to as the "next level." 
"What is remarkable about Stacey is her consistency at a very high level. She's ready to take it to the next step and compete at the highest level of competition," Winsor said. 
Cowan, a native of Ferndale, Wash., started jumping in the seventh grade, but it wasn't until her fresh­man year of high school that she discovered her natural ability in the event. That year
