Philbin, King to visit catnpus 
By HELENA PAYNE 
New, Editor 
Two prominent talk show hosts will be making appearances this weekend for the Notrf' Danrn foot.ball game against Stanford. 
ICJ5:~ graduate Regis Philbin will follow through on a promise to 
givn CNN talk show host Larry King a Laslc of' Notn\ Dam<\ cu ltu rn th is v.·1ir1km1rl. 
"Hegis is excited to show Larrv Notre Dame." said Dr.bbie IJolins, publicist for "LIVE with Regis & Kelly." 


Philbin is scheduled to Philbin arrive from New York on Friday and King will come from Los Angeles 
on Saturday. · 
The host and executive producer of "LIVE" proposed that King visit the University dur­ing a May 13 show of "Larry King Live," wlwre he was a guest. 
Philbin was rPminiscing about his under­gradualP days at Notre Dame when King rnentio1wd that Im had never been to Notre 
name. "Oh, I'd love to introduce you to it," Philbin told King. 
After some conversation about attending a football !{ame, King eventually told Philbin, "Whenever you go, I'll go." 
Dolins said the exact itinerary for Philbin has not been decided. Last year's campus homecoming by Philbin included trips to the lake, the Grotto. the football locker room and the Stadium, as well as a visit to his old room on the second floor of Zahm IIall. 
Philbin visited Notre Dame last year to tape a show for "LIVE" and attend the groundbreaking ceremony for the Marie P. OeBartolo Performing Arts Center that is currently still under construction on the south end of the DeBartolo quad. 
Philbin, who has won Emmys for both "LIVE" and "Who Wants to be a Millionaire," donated $2.75 million last year to go toward a 100-seat studio theater in the center that the University is naming after him. 
The center will cost an estimated $50 mil­lion to construct and it is scheduled to open next year.

Father Joyce in1proving after suffering a stroke 
By HELENA PAYNE 
News Editor 
Father Edmund Joyce remains in the South Bend St. Joseph Regional Medical Center, but his condition is improving, said Father William Seetch, religious superior for the Holy Cross Community. 
Joyce, the executive vice president emeritus and a 1937 Notre Dame graduate, was hospitalized Sept. 20 after suffering a stroke. 
The hospital moved him Friday from intensive care to the rehabilitation unit where Joyce, 85, is undergoing physical therapy. 
The hospital has not yet set a date for his release. 
"It depends on how he responds to physical thera­py," Seetch said, adding that 

Joyce is trying to restore strength in his arms. He has retained his ability to speak. 
The priest's younger broth­er, Lylo Joyce, arrived yp,ster­d ay from Paris, where he resides, to visit his ill brother. 
According to Seetch, Lyle. also a Notre Dame graduate, is Joyce's closest living kin. Joyce's second brother, Jack, is deceased. He also has nieces and nephews that live in the United States. 
Joyce, a former resident of Spartanburg, S.C., was the 

first  student  from  South  
Carolina  to  attend  Notre  
Dame, Seetch said.  

Since graduating with a bachelor's degree in account­ing, then called commerce, Joyce has spent 35 years at Notre Dame as a University administrator. His former

BOARD OF TRUSTEES 


Dorm_s topic of student report 
. Bishop plans to suggest new buildings are needed to Board of Trustees today 
ByJASON McFARLEY News Writer 
Notre Dame should build new residence halls to alleviate overcrowding, and the University should equip current halls with apartment-style amenities, according to a report that student government officials will present today to the Board of Trustees. 
The "Plan to Improve Residential Life" from the office of Student Body President Libby Bishop recommends construction of several new dorms that include suites, kitchens, private bathrooms and 
Bishop other apartment-type conveniences. It proposes that existing dorms be renovated to include those features as well. 
On-campus housing is at 102 percent capacity, the 52-page report said, and most dorms were built to accommodate far fewer residents than the number who occupy them now. 
"We expect the report to be a catalyst, to start the wheels turning in their heads to think about new dorms," Bishop said. 
Bishop, Vice President Trip Foley and report chairman Jordan Linville will present the plan to the Student Affairs subcommittee of the Board of Trustees at a closed 1 p.m. meeting in McKenna Hall. The trustees are on campus today and Friday for their annual fall meeting. 
Trustees received copies of the report as early as Wednesday, but Bishop said she wouldn't make the document available to the public until after the presentation. 
The report comes at a time when the University is finishing a 10-year strategic plan and amid concern among officials that upper­classmen are moving off campus in increas­ing numbers. 
About 77 percent of Notre Dame under­graduates live on campus. Because adminis­trators want to increase that figure to 85 per­cent within 10 years and in light of recent enrollment trends, the report said, there is a need for more dorms. 

School officials in the past have acknowl­edged that they depend on students to move off campus because the 27 residence halls can't accommodate Notre Dame's 8,500 undergraduates. But even with about half of the senior class living off-campus this year, most dorms are at or beyond capacity. 
The report relies heavily on a Campus Life Council study la.st year that surveyed student interest in types of on-campus housing other than traditional, single-sex residence halls. 
Of the more than 2,000 respondent<; to the CLC survey, most listed suite-or apartment­style living as better alternatives to the cur­rent residence halls, Bishop said. If such alternatives existed, about 80 percent of sur­veyed students who either lived off-campus or were planning to move off campus said they would consider moving back or remain­ing on campus. 
The report includes historical data that tracks upgrades to the halls. Overall, the dorms have changed little, said Linville, who will oversee the writing of all three student government reports to the trustees this year. 
"I was surprised by the relatively small amount of changes that have taken place over the years." he said. 
The report also includes data from focus group interviews with students, hall rectors, administrators, facilities officials and the University architect. 
Senior administrators from the Office of Student Affairs and Brian Coughlin, director of Student Activities, are expected to attend the hour-long report presentation. Bishop's chief of staff, Pat Hallahan, is also scheduled to attend. 
The fall and spring trustees meetings at Notre Dame have traditionally served as the only formal contact between student leaders and the Board. Trustees have rarely followed student government proposals to the letter. 
"If nothing else, they'll start looking at our plan seriously and allocating the resources for these improvements," Linville said.

INSIDE COLUMN 

Major ch~nges or staying with it? 
When freshmen come to campus, most have a feeling of high expecta­tion for their next four years. We wouldn't be hem ifwe didn't excel in high school so most of us think that we'll breeze through college Justin Krivickas too. Rut then again if everyone 
Assistant
here did well in high school then News Editor things should be harder hero, and l for one didn't take that into account. 
Reality is starting to set .in as stu­dents begin to take their first exams this year. Would-be engineers now get the sudden shock that they did poorly on a test, and other students begin to see that their majors may noL be the best thing to do with their lives. Things may look tough now, but don't despair. 
There's time right now to tnrn everything around by hitting those books and getting back un track. One exam won't hurt your grade too badly as long as you can pull it up the next time. If you'vp done poorly don't fret, use it as a learning experience that you have to change your study habits and with time you'll learn how to best prepare for those exams. Go to tutor­ing. As long as you love what you're majoring in, don't give up on it too soon or later on in life you may regret your decision. 
Yet, on the other hand, if you have decided that another day as an engi­neer, architect, or perhaps PLS major is going to make your head fall off then by all means get off that track. Don't stick with anything that you are beginning to dread doing, but think long and hard about any changes you do make. Making a mistake now may change your entire life so it's safe to be prudent and plan every aspect of your decision over and over again. 
At least you've found something that vou don't want to do and that's one down and a few others to pour through. I've seen a report that found upwards of 75 percent of college stu­dents change their major at least once in college, and up to 80 percent of freshmen have some career uncer­tainty. Although I doubt these figures are credible at institutions such as · '.\fotre Dame, the statistics do show the extreme nature and unease some freshmen can face. 
I heard someone say last week you should do what you want to, and not worry about what anyone else thinks and I think that advice is just about the best I've heard in awhile. Going through life in a field you loath, after all, is not much of a life. 
Just because your parents, friends or some voice in vour head wants vou to do something, -remember this is" your decision and only you can make that choice. You're in college to find yourself and striking out the first time isn't the end of the world. Just remember that the ball game isn't over until you hit that home run.

The memorial's design was chosen last spring from 20 submissions by a panel of architecture professors and experts. The winning design, created by fifth-year archi­tecture students Kevin Clark and Meg Kroener, would incorporate the flagpole on South Quad. 
The concept envisions a sunken area for personal reflection, including a reflecting pool, from which the pole would r.ise. A walk­way would pass over the water. and would be posi­tioned so that the flagpole's shadow would fall across the walkway at 9:08 am, the time of the first plane's impact into the World Trade Center. 
Administrators were vague on the prospects for the memorial. As the Observer reported last spring, officials say they prefer a small memorial, less prominent than the Clarke Memorial Fountain. but have not allo­cated funding for the project. Doug Marsh, the University's architect, declined to com­ment for this story. 
Kroener, who works for an delayed the project, but she doesn't know why it's still on the back burner. 
Kroener and Clark submit­ted only a one-page schemat­ic of the memorial, and more design work would be needed before construction could begin. "I'd like to havP. the opportunity to continue in the design process," Kroener said, though she has not been contacted by University offi­cials. 
Four Notre Dame alumni lost their lives in the terrorist attacks. Robert Ferris, class of 1962, was on the 102nd floor of the south tower of the WTC. Lt. Col. S. Neil Hyland, Jr., class of 1977, worked at the Pentagon. Also, Peter Batacan, class of 1983. and Dora Marie Menchaca, class of 1977, were on American Airlines Flight 77 when it was flown into the Pentagon. The attacks also took the lives of some 2,800 people in lower Manhattan, Washington D.C. and rural Pennsylvania.

Shoe botnb suspect to plead guilty on all charges 
Associated Press 
BOSTON 

Richard Reid, the man accused of try­ing to blow up a trans-Atlantic Oight with explosives hidden in his shoes, plans to plead guilty to at.tempted mur­d!ff and all otlrnr charges against him. his lawyer said Wednesday. 
Attorney Owen Walker said Rt>id wanted to avoid the publicity of a trial and the negative impact it would have on his family. 
Heid faces up to life in prison if con­victed of the most serious charges. His attorney said Reid "has no disagreement with the facts" asserted in the charges. 
In his court filing, Reid said he would admit to all eight counts against him, but asked the court to remove language from two of the charges alleging he received training from al-Qaida. Reid earlier lost a bid to remove the same language from the indictment against him. 
The motion does not say a guilty plea is contingent upon the al-Qaida refer­ences being stricken. Walker declined comment on the issue. 
In Washington. Attorney General John Ashcroft said Reid acted on his own and has no plea agreement with the govern­ment. Federal prosecutors also filed a pleading that opposed removal of any language from the indictment. 
"The Justice Department stands by 
each and every allegation in the indict­ment. We are prepared to substantiate all of the charges," Ashcroft said in a statement. Trial is set for Nov. 4. 
Reid, a 28-year-old British citizen, is accused of attempting to kill the 197 passengers and crew members aboard American Airlines Flight 63 from Paris to Miami on Dec. 22. He was overpow­ered by flight attendants and passen­gers, and the flight was diverted to Boston. 
Authorities said each shoe contained a plastic explosive often used by terror­ists. They said the homemade bombs could easily have ripped a hole in the plane if Reid had successfully ignited them. 

The indictment said Reid "received training from al-Qaida in Afghanistan," but it provided no other details about Reid's alleged ties to the network. 
The FBI has said it believes Reid had help making the bomb from "an al­Qaida bomb maker," and have cited unidentified human hair and a palm print found on the explosives. Reid insisted to FBI investigators that he acted alone. 
In statements to law enforcement after his arrest, Reid said he acted because of the U.S. military campaign in Afghanistan and that he hoped his planned attack would cause Americans to stop traveling, leading to a downturn in the economy, prosecutors said.

Former Irish President to speak at Saint Mary's tonight 

In 1966, Holy Cross College opened with a handful of students and a mission. The mission was to provide a personal, caring, educational environment that would prepare students to transfer successfully to the four-year institution of their choice. 
Holy Cross College now has over 500 students, a residence life program and an ever-increasing selection of course offerings, amenities and social opportunities. But no matter how much we grow, we will never lose sight of our fundamental mission. Every year, our students develop the skills necessary to transfer to outstanding colleges and universities like Notre Dame, Saint Mary's, Indiana University and scores of other fine four-year institutions. 
Our mission is what has made us successful. So while many things change, our mission is one thing that will not.

IN BRIEF Feds OK United, US Airways Sharing 
The government on Wednesday approved a proposal by L.:nited Airlines and US A.irways to sell scats on each other's flights. coordinate schedules and offer reciprocal perks such as freqm'nt flier miles, effective immediately. 
!n its decision, the Transportation Department said it gave the go-ahead to the two struggling airlines because the partner­ship would increase competition and benefit travelers. 
"We have not yet seen evidence that the agrnements will unreasonably restrict either air!ine·s incentives and ability to compete independently or would be likely to result in collusion on fares or service levels," the deci­sion said. 
The regulators, though, said they would monitor the so-called code-sharing agreement closely and would take action against the air­lines if they found the venture dampened competition.

Price noted that special cer­emonies integral to the parish community such as baptisms, weddings, and first commu­nions could not be a part of the liturgy because of the time constraints. 
Rocca, however, considers the television coverage "a wonderful opportunity for evangelization." 
He said that a large propor­tion of the television audience is people who have fallen from the Church or who are curious about Catholic wor­ship. It's not just the sick and homebound watching. 
It's also a great way for Notre Dame, the Liturgical Choir, and the Congregation of the Holy Cross to gain national exposure, he said. 
On the whole, reaction to the televised liturgy has boen positive, said Rocca. 
"I think it's good for people who don't have access to Mass, because it brings them closer to tlrn Church," said Mary Hao, a sophomore from Howard, "but nothing can beat the real thing." 
The Basilica will continue its national evangelizing for a while, at least. The University's contract with the Hallmark channel extends through June 2005.

The mention of High Mass at Sacred Hoart Basilica 1wokes images of incense, elaborate vestments, sacred rituals and an angelic r:hoir. But how about robotic cam­eras, high-tech sound equip­ment and prncision timing? 
Beginning in early .July, the Hallmark cable channel, in conjunction with Faith & Values Media, has broadcast the Basilica's 10 a.m. Mass to over 47 million homes nation­wide. Preparations for the nation-wide broadcast required the Basilica to be outfitted with digital clocks, strategically located cameras, and a control room in the basement of the building. 
Father Peter Rocca, rector of the Basilica, said the cam­eras arc "very well-placed" and am not a distraction for the congregation. They arc hard to notice unless you know to look for ttrnm: he said. The unoblrusive place­ment of the cameras was part of the Basilica staffs effort to ensure that broadcasting the Mass wouldn't compromise the quality of the celebration or the beauty of the Basilica. They didn't want cameramen walking up and down the aisles of the Basilica, distract­ing the congregation, Rocca said. 
The timing of the Mass, however, may be unnaturally preciso. Digital clocks, visible from behind the altar, as well as in the sacristy, choir loft. and foyer coordinate the cele­brants and choir. They count down from 60 minutes during the Mass. At 54 minutes and 15 seconds the opening hymn begins and the celebrants begin to process to the altar. Then Mass proceeds at a reg­ular, uninterrupted pace. When the clock reads 3 min­utes, it's time for final announcemnnts. And at 1 minute and 15 seconds the closing hymn starts and the celebrants leave the altar. The key factor in keeping on track with time, Hocca points out, is limiting the length of the homily. "I make it very clear, whether !the presider] is a bishop or a regular priest, the homily has to be seven min­utes -period," he said. 

Some worry that a national audience and such a stringent timetable have a negative impact on thn Basilica's litur­gy. Erin Fitzpatrick, a junior, is concerned that national broadcasting "compromises the integrity of' the Mass." She feels that tlrn mass is a sacred event, and commercializing it through the I Iallmark channel cheapens that. 
Lauren Price, a sophomore theology major, cited con­cerns about tailoring the homily to a national audience instead of to the local congre­gation. "It's a great thing to share our faith with the wider community," she said, "but [broadcasting the Mass] is a disservice for the people

In 1979, Einhorn's mystique took on a sinister side. Einhorn's girlfriend. Holly Maddux, a Texan who had graduated from Bryn Mawr College, was found dead in the apartment the couple shared. Maddux had been missing for over a year before authorities discovered her mummified remains stuffed in a trunk in Einhorn's bedroom closet. 
In 1981, Einhorn was arrest­ed and subsequently released after paying the $40,000 bail. Upon his release, Einhorn fled the country and, aside from random alleged spottings in a few cities across Europe, did not surface for the next 16 years. 
From 1990 to 1992. under the pseudonym Eugene Mallon, Einhorn lived in a cottage in the county of Devon, England. Richard Buxton, who identified himself as Einhorn's landlord in England, has vivid memo­ries of Einhorn and his wife, Annika Flodin-Einhorn. whom he married in Europe. 
"He was an overbearing and rather intense man with mad eyes," Buxton wrote in an e­mail. 
"He used to frighten some of the locals by swimming with [Annika] naked and sun­bathing on the lawn," Buxton wrote. and he "spent much time on computers, slept on the floor and painted the house interiors some outlandish col­ors." 
Buxton wrote that when he tried to evict Einhorn as a ten­ant. Einhorn refused to leave, and Buxton was forced to get a court order to remove him. 
"We were suspicious of his status and

Though convicted and sen­tenced, Einhorn's whereabouts remained a mystery.

Notre Dame Women Past and Present 

Reaching for the Better Part 
¦ by Chandra J, Johnson, Assistant to the President 
I graduated from high school che same year Notre Dame became a cu-ed campus: 1972. 

HoweYer, I didn't find my way to South Bend until twenty years later. A lot happened between 1972 and 1992, but finding my Yoi.ce through a college education was always my dream and life goal. When I finally got here, I realized that my dream was shared by a small group of tenacious and willing women who, like me, stopped dreaming and joined the Notre Dame student body. 
Today's column is dedicated to the women in the Class ofl 976 who blazed the trail of co-education at Notre Dame. As we take this year to reminisce on their pioneering spirit, I and thousands of women who came after you, want to say, "thank you!" You helped us to find our voice. You came from near and far to join an all-male student body who would have to stretch their imaginations to include women in their traditionally male stories of excellence and tradition. As a Notre Dame woman with a modern-day perspective, I often think about you and wonder how it was sitting in class­rooms surrounded by Notre Dame men who had to adjust to your smell, smile and common sense. I wonder ifyou or they were distracted or empowered by chis new campus experience. Or if you knew how much your spiritual and intellectual contributions would impact Notre Dame's future and national reputation. As we look back on your 30-year legacy, we remind ourselves ofyour pioneering spirit and how you helped to make Notre Dame a place where both men and women could obtain a quality education while learning the educative value of gender balance and shared perspectives. "May they be brought to Twenty years after you arrived on campus, I followed in your footsteps as a non-traditional student, and became the

later, rest assured that your stories have not been forgotten. Your legacy and influence can be witnessed in the scories of our current generation of women intellectuals who, like you, 
-John 17:23 have learned co think critically and recite their stories from a position ofstrength. One such story was told a couple ofweeks ago at a A Life Uncommon meering in Pangborn Hall. 
One of the most stirring interpretations I have ever heard of the story of Jesus, Martha and Mary was given by a senior leader of the women's supporc group, A Life Uncommon. For anonymity sake, let's call her Rebecca. Our topic for the evening was self esteem and removing the 
barriers which prevent women from active learning and critical thinking. Rebecca said that it was in chis story that Jesus showed his compassionate care and concern for the cognitive well-being ofhis female friends: 
Ai they continued their journey he entered a village where a woman whose name was Martha welcomed him. She had a sister named Mary {who] sat beside the Lord at hisfeet listening to him speak. Martha, burdened with much serving, came to him andsaid, "Lord, do you not care that my sister has left ml' by myselfto do the serving' Tell her to help me." The Lord ,aid to her in reply, "Martha, Martha, you are anxious and worried about many things. There is need ofonly one thing. Mary has chosen the better part and it will not be taken ftom her." (Luke 10:38-42). 
Rebecca's interpretation of Luke's story was a brilliant hermenwtic comparing the societal roles of women then and now. She suggested that Jesus's reprimand. of Martha was helping her to see busy work and routine chores as secondary to knowledge-seeking. Mary's position at Jesus's feet was not a subservient gesture but "the better part" of their shared interaction. Jesus's response to Martha's complaint that her sister left her alone to do the serving provided her an opportunity to consider her options: she could either postpone her chores for the time being, or join her sister in a rare, teachable moment with Jesus. He encouraged Martha to be still and sit with him a while. Perhaps he wanted their undivided attention while he shared details of his journey and the miracles that happened along the way. Perhaps he wanted to teach them about the privileges of discipleship (Luke 10:23ff), the greatest Commandment (25ff), or the parable ofthe Good Samaritan (29ff)-lessons he taught the disciples on their way to Bethany. Perhaps he wanred ro reach them what others wouldn't. 
Like the women in the class of I 976, Martha and Mary were offered an educational opportunity. They were encouraged to stretch the boundaries which had defined their lives. Jesus gave them permission to realign their roles and think outside the box. By recon­structing his expectations and traditional social norms, he spoke to their minds and their spirits. He helped them to see that although household responsibilities are important, there is no substitute for learning. Nothing can replace knowing. 
When Rebecca completed her story, the room fell silent. We were touched by her modern day interpretation ofa very old story. We were charged to reach for "the better part" of our busy days and cake time to listen and learn. As we closed the meeting with a prayer, I reflected on my own journey from the kitchen to the classroom, and thanked God for the courage to follow my dream. Through her biblical interpretation, Rebecca taught me co look to ages past and embrace the lessons we have learned from those who have gone before us. As 21" century Notre Dame women who stand on the shoulders of rhe women of the Class of 1976, we join in solidarity with our sister matriarchs and carry the torch ofsovereignty and influence. We call on their maternal spirits and relive the trials and triumphs of their graced lives. We are blessed because they weren't afraid to trod on rocky ground. As we celebrate the 30th anniversary of co­education at Notre Dame, we remember their courage. fu a woman the age of those to whom this column is dedicated, I went home that night humbled by what I had learned from Rebecca, and thankful for the wisdom to know how much she had taught me.

Abortion exhibit stirs up debate at Colorado State 
By WILLOWWELTER Rocky Mountain Collegian 
FORT COLLINS, Colo. 

A giant display of posters showing bloody. aborted fetuses caused controversy in the Plaza at Colorado State University Monday. 
"Warning: Genocide Pictures Ahmtel" read the signs erected at the l'ree speech Plaza, where lhe anti-abortion group Justice For All had set up for day one (the group will be on the Plaza again Wednesday) of its controversial exhibit. Billboard-sized posters showed fotuses at diffenrnt stages of pregnancies, after the women bad undergone abor­tions. 
Surrounding the anti-abortion dmnonstration area were blank white boards where spectators could freely write their thoughts. Writtrn in marker on the "Free Speech Boards" wern remarks like. "It's too bad vou have to use gory pictures to p·ersuade people to believe you" and "I hope this makes you sick because it's mur­der and if you support il. you need help." 
Justice For All was not the only organization present, although their display towered in size over the others. The pro-choice group, National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League, had a booth focused on the upcoming election. 
Nearby, shouting ensued between another pro-choice platform. Life and Liberty for Women, and several anti-abor­tionists. 
Throughout the Plaza, students engaged in heated discussions. some wearing neon-colored "I Am Pro-Choice" stickers that NARAL had distributed. Some of these conversations were sparke.d by a group of about 90 people that had traveled from Colorado Springs to engage stu­dents in non-confrontational dia­logue about the topic. 
The Colorado Springs group was composed of students at the Focus Institute, a Christian orga­nization and school against abor­tion. 
Bonnie Bolz, a student at Focus Institute, said Justice For All came to their school and asked them to come engage in dialogue without necessarily expressing conflicting views. 
The resident supervisor at Focus Institute, Lindy Beam, said their group came to educate peo­ple about abortion. 
"I don't think people really think about what abortion really is," Beam 
said. "If it's legal and it's the most common surgery in the United States, why don't we ever see pictures of it? Why don't we ever look at it?" 
Beam said the group of stu­dents came with the approach of engaging in conversation without trying to force their beliefs on people. 
"We're all pro-life and we want to get our view across, but basically the truth is going to stand for itself," Beam insisted. 
"I don't have to force you to believe it." 
The bloody abortion posters upset some students, inciting obscenity, shouting and disap­pointed sighs. 
"I completely disagree with this," said Hannah Girtin, a sophomore English major, as she examined the Justice For All exhibit. "It's so atrocious. If I don't even have a right to choose, then how can someone expect me to be a mother?" 
"Yeah," agreed Emily Latta, a freshman open liberal arts major. "It kind of makes me numb to the whole thing. Why scare me with something like this?" 
Nate Enyart, a young man who had traveled from Denver to wit­ness the demonstration, had other thoughts. 
"People are just mad that they have to see these pictures, but no one is forcing them to look," Enyart said. "Students can sec it if they want to see it, and if not they don't have to look at it."

Conversations between the leaders of the Wichita, Kan. group, Justice For All, and members of the crowd contin­ued throughout the first day of this display, which lasted from 8 
a.m. until about 3 p.m. 
Tammy Cook, spokeswoman for Justice For AU, sat on a stool addressing comments and ques­tions that passers-by confronted her with. 
"This is just another form of education," Cook said. "Our main goal is to help raise awareness that abortion takes the life of an unborn baby." 
Cook said she realized the pic­tures may disturb people, but for a reason. 
"Ifsomething is so horrifying," she said, "then maybe we need to rethink how we view abor­tion." On the other end of the Plaza stood Peggy Loman from Life and Liberty for Women, arguing with a cluster of people surrounding her. Loman also had bloody pictures displayed at her pro-choice platform, but instead of aborted fetuses they showed a naked woman bleed­ing on a tloor after undergoing an illegal abortion. 
'Tm here to educate the peo­ple on this campus about what illegal abortion looks like, because they don't know," Loman said. "It's important that against those (Justice For All) pictures, which I believe are distorted, that you see what an illegal abortion looks like." 
Her posters included more text than it did pictures, first posing the question, "Does God Condemn Roe vs. Wade?" then answering it with sentences like, "God Committed the Deliberate Act of Abortion," and "Abortion is Absolutely in Line with God's Laws." 
Steering clear of students hoping to debate, the NARAL members had a booth on the north end of the Plaza focused solely on the upcoming election. Since the Colorado State Senate has a pro-choice majority by merely one vote, NARAL emphasized the stance, "We Must Elect Pro-Choice Candidates!" 
Corrie Bonnar, campaign coordinator from the Laramie county NARAL, said the group just began its Voter Contact Program, which involves informing voters of the pro­choice candidates in their dis­tricts. To further this cause, NARAL has organized a pro­choice rally to take place in Denver on Oct. 7. 
"What we're doing today is focusing our efforts on the elec­tion because it's a really impor­tant election year," Bonnar said. "So today we're signing people up for our pro-choice rally next week and signing them up to volunteer in our Voter Contact Program." 
Tammy Cook and the· Justice For All group, labeled "anti­choice" by some people, dis­agree with that term. 
"I say that I am vehemently pro-choice for women to be able to choose their schools, thAir careers, what color their hair is, what they wear, their husbands," Cook began, "I am for all of these choices. But some choices are wrong, like taking the life of a human being.'' 
Justice For All, as well as the pro-choice groups NARAL and Life and Liberty for Women, continued to demonstrate on the Plaza Wednesday.

Global 
out Mark Twain's challenge. 
The beaches of Spain, mountain cliffs of Switzerland and bike trails of Scotland have all been marked by the footprints of eager Irish travelers, out for adventure during the first of two week-long breaks in London. 
One prime destination was Munich, Germany for Oktoberfest. Expecting to see tarp tents full of tables and barmaids carrying out jugs of beer, we were surprised to discover one big German carnival. Out in the rain ven­dors sold pretzels, bratwursts, deco­rated cookies and even old-fashioned cotton candy. In the large beer hous­es. waitresses in full German dresses carried out scores of liter steins to the international patrons. Bands played music in the festive houses as groups standing on tables swayed to the German and American tunes, toasting strangers with a loud clink. If the beers weren't enough to make the partygoers dizzy, maybe the out­door Ferris wheels, spinning carnival rides and roller coasters would. 
A few dizzy German men needed to follow us on the way back to our hos­tels ten minutes away. They couldn't speak a word of English, but they could sing the full chorus to "Hooked On A Feeling," which echoed in the tunnel over that stretch of road. At the hostel, I grabbed my camera to take a picture of our 12-bcd room. Some Korean roommates got exciteci and huddled together with their tall Oktoberfest hats on their heads. I jumpf!d in, and an Australian woman took the shut. 
Munich is an international attrac­tion, but we didn't get too far from the Notre Dame crowd. Students from the Spain, Rome and London pro­grams bumped into each other all in one day. Running across a familiar face unexpectedly in a foreign coun­try is a strange exhilaration. 
My travel pack was surprised to bump into another London group with two other flatmates. Eager to share stories, we traveled together by rail to Salzburg, Austria. A shift of pace from the busy Munich streets, Salzburg offered several decorated churches and monuments dedicated to Austria's renowned composers, including Haydn and Mozart. 
Having struggled with poverty, Hadyn was noted for saying, "I have associated with kings, emperors and many great gentlemen and have heard many flattering things from them; but I do not wish to live on an intimate footing with such persons, and [ prefer people of my own sta­tus." Were he alive today, he might have preferred passing time outside his great exhibition hall with the harpist playing for change nearby in the quiet public square. 
Being the dumb American tourist was an adventure. On an Austrian mountain field like those seen in "The Sound of Music," three of us found some big cows with horns grazing in the brush. I walked up to the big white cow. The big cow looked at me. I ran away. In the Munich hostel, a friend had left behind some clothes I stuffed in my bag. While the sandals were hers, the bra was not. 
Others returned from their coun­tries having encountered cultures that touched a part of their soul. On their bike excursion in Scotland, one group met and counsP-led a sad teenager outside a phone after his "lassie" had just broken up with him. Another roommate on an Italian beach watched a father teach his son how to skip rocks over the water and is determined to do the same when he has kids. 

After the week away, we were glad to be back in English country. Getting home, we found London had had a 150,000-person demonstration against the possible Iraq attack and the tube workers were to strike start­ing today. 
The adventures continued while home. At the Welcome Back Mass that had been set up, we did the readings and sang at the usually quiet local church. The local parish­ioners must have been amused by the choir, who had organized 15 minutes before the service and often sang off sequence with the priest far away in the large, stone church. Thanks to Corey the organ player and singers from the Glee Club and Folk Choir, we kept somewhat on track. That evening was a flatmate's birthday, so we stuck candles in some donuts and the girls across the hall sang for him. 
After exploring, many have lived out dreams formed before coming abroad and now anticipate discover­ing the people here anew. Oddly enough, people noted how real life in a far-off street in Switzerland felt much like real life in America. 
What added to the experience was what it drew from the soul within. The challenge now is to find the sim­ple gifts of relationship and life that fill the heart. What makes you feel the joy? To echo Twain's words, "Explore. Dream. Discover."

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Don't believe administration's SYR spin 
I am writing in response to the Ocl. 1 article, "New SYR gets mixed reviews." While waiting for an update on how my girlfriend was feeling and for my friend to return from the hospital early Sunday morning, I secretly hoped that an article of this nature would appear in this week's paper and give me the chance to write this response. I find it insulting that the University would attempt to place a positive spin on a policy that, I feel. placed my friend in this very com­promising position. 
The reason that the new alcohol policy was put into effect, to my recollection, was to promote more responsible alco­hol use on campus. While the idea to limit the time of a pre-party and take the dance outside of the dorm was well­intended, I could not help but notice more students drinking to get -and stay -drunk this weekend. 
I do not blame the University for the mentality of students. I am simply stat­ing that their restrictions are exacerbat­ing the situation. Out of the 200 people who attended our dance, I was aware of at least five examples of abusive drink­ing which led to illness or hospitaliza­tion. In all honesty, I saw more cases of binge drinking in the two hours before our dance Saturday than I did all last year. 
If the University wants to help ensure our safety, I believe that they can pro­vide a more conducive atmosphere for social drinking instead of fostering an environment with abusive drinking. As the social commissioner of Keough Hall and a person who has taken a Jot of pride in living here, I find it truly dis­heartening that dorm spirit has dimin­ished in the past year, especially among freshmen. 
From what I have heard this has been consistent around campus and even the article mentioned the lack of spirit in the dorms. Many dorm dances have already been cancelled -for example, O'Ncill's -and I fear that the lower attendance rates could possibly lead to the extinc­tion of hall dances. I find dorm life to be one of the most unique parts of Notre Dame and think that the new SYR poli­cies are a destructive force. Do not allow the University to convince themselves that the alcohol policy solves drinking issues here on campus. If these rules and regulations remain constant, it may be you waiting up all night hoping your girlfriend/boyfriend is alright and that your friend makes it home from the hos­pital.

Arguing against a pre-emptive strike on Iraq 

Ignoring the rule oflaw makes us no better than Saddam 
Regarding Mike Marchand's column urging a pre­emptive attack on Iraq ("Time for talk is over," Sept. 30), it's time for a reality check. A morality check, too. 
The writer and President Bush seem to have devel­oped ESP or some machine that lets them look into the future and know for certain what will happen. How else do you explain their insistence that they have the right to punish criminals before they have committed a crime? 
Let's pretend, as the writer suggests, that intelli­gence sources had uncovered the Sept. 11 plot a few months in advance. The writer says the proper course of action would have been to order a "fierce preemp­tive attack" (on Afghanistan, presumably) before the plan could be carried out. 
What does he suppose would have been the response of the civilized world to this attack? Utter outrage ­and justifiably so. There we'd be, bully-boy USA, invading a sovereign state because we claimed to have information that a mysterious terrorist group was plot­ting a diabolical attack on our soil. 
Rather than launch an invasion, the smarter, safer and infinitely more economical response would have been to catch the perpetrators in the act. It would have been child's play to follow them to the airport and onto the planes and put them in handcuffs the minute they entered the cockpits (remember these guys had box cutters, not guns). Then you put them on trial and, if they're convicted, put them in prison. No "fierce pre­emptive attack" necessary, just good police work and a firm dedication to justice and the rule oflaw. 
The United States is supposed to stand for those things, but cowboy-justice hawks and simpletons like our president and his advisers follow different princi­pies, like "war now, inspections later" and 'Tll kill you now in case you might be plotting to kill me." 

Saddam may be a madman, he may be developing terrible weapons, he may use them against other coun­tries. Or he may not. Only he and God know for sure. George Bush doesn't, and neither does Donald Rumsfeld, no matter how strongly they insist they do. 
lfwe ignore the rule oflaw, pretend we know the future and take matters into our own hands, we're doubtfully any more principled than Saddam.

MLB 
-Angels battle for late 8-6 victory over the Yankees 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK 

Dramatic home runs. Clutch pitching by closers. Yet another late-night comeback in the Uronx. 
Yes. the Anaheim AngPls cer­tainly have learned from the New York Yankees. 
Garrrt Anderson liit a tying home run off Orlando Hernandez ti:., the eighth inning, Troy Glaus 
. rollowed with a go-ahead shot 
··-and the Angels evened their best­of-five AL playoff series by win­ning 8-6 in Game 2 Wednesday night. "I know crazy things happen here," said Troy Percival, who escaped jams in the eighth and ninth innings, "but not tonight." After watching the Yankees rla"'· back from a 4-0 deficit to take a 5-4 lead. the crowd was stunned. It was the first time New York lost a postseason game at Yankee Stadium when leading after the seventh inning, accord­ing to the Elias Sports Bureau. "We know we can come back and win any time," Anaheim's Bengie Molina said. 'They proba­bly know that, too." A night after not bringing in Percival and watching his bullpen squander a lead in the opener, Angels manager !\like Scioscia called for his closer with Anaheim trying to protect a 7-5 edge in the eighth. Percival got out of the jam, throwing a called third strike past Derek Jeter, who questioned the call, with the bases loaded. Scott Spiezio provided a cush­ion with a run-scoring double in the ninth off Jeff Weaver, his third hit and RBI. The Yankees tried for one more comeback in the bottom of the ninth, with Jorge Posada blooping an RBI single with one out. But with two runners on, Percival struck out Nick Johnson and retired Raul Mondesi on a popup. Anaheim, which set a team postseason record with 17 hits, headed home to California after the 4-hour, 11-minute marathon with its first playoff win since 
1986, one that gives the Angels hope they can knock off the four­time defending AL champions. 
"We do what it takes to win, no matter the circumstances, no matter whatever," Glaus said. 
The series resumes Friday, with the Angels' Ramon Ortiz facing .'.vlike Mussina in Game 3. 
"We've got a big challenge ahead of us, no doubt about it," Sciuscia said. "\.Ve've got to go nut thPre and continue to press these guys." 
Giants 8, Braves 5 
Barrv Bonds didn't have to come "up big for the San Francisco Giants to get a jump on the Atlanta Braves. 
The rest of the San Franrisco hitters knocked around Atlanta's heralded pitching staff while Russ Ortiz threw seven strong innings, carrying the Giants to an 8-5 victory Wednesday in Game 1 of the NL division playoffs. 
"Obviously, Barry gets most of the attention, and he deserves the atti-rntion," Ortiz said. "But we have a really good ballclub up and down the lineup." 
Down 8-2, Garv Sheffield and Javy Lopez homered in the eighth to get the Braves close. Atlanta had its chance in the ninth, but Robb Nen got Sheffield to ground into a game-ending double play ""ith two runners on for a save. 
"It doesn't matter how you get it or the way you get it," said J.T. Snow, who got San Francisco off to a quick start with a two-run double in the second off Tom Glavine. "You've just got to get the win." 
Bonds, an overwhelming favorite for his fifth MVP award, was denied a homer in the eighth when Andruw Jones leaped above the center-field wall to make a catch. 
It didn't matter to Bonds, who is more concerned about winning his first World Series ring. He smiled as he walked off the field, glancing back to look at the replay on the video board. 
Bonds' teams are O-for-5 in the postseason, losing twice to the Braves in the early '90s while

manager last week as part of 
the changes that also saw 
Wendy Selig-Prich step down as 
team president. 
"I don't have any problem 
with what Doug's doing, I think 
it's the right thing to do," 
Royster said. "A general man­
ager has to hire his own guy. If 
I were Doug, I'd fire me, too." 
Melvin said his search for a 
replacement would begin with 
Jerry Narron, who was fired by 
the Texas Rangers on Tuesday, 
and Buck Showalter, former 
manager of the Arizona 
Diamondbacks, but that he 
wanted to include a wide array 
of candidates, both with and 
without previous managerial 
experience. 
The Brewers had the NL's 
worst record at 56-106 and 
easily surpassed their worst 
mark of 64-98, set in 1969 
when they were the Seattle 
Pilots. The Brewers finished 41 
games behind the Central 
Division-winning St. Louis 
Cardinals. 
Yet, Royster said he felt he 
would have had a decent shot 
at sticking around in 2003 were 
it not for the changes made last 
week. 
"I would hope that with Wendy and Dean, I would have been retained," Royster said. "Not only do I hope I would have, I deserved it. I took over a situation that was an absolute mess." 
Milwaukee went 53-94 under 
Royster. who became interim 
manager when Davey Lopes 
was fired on April 18 following 
a 3-12 start. 
Royster said he did every­thing he could to make the Brewers competitive, including turning them loose on the bases because their station-to­station approach wasn't work­ing. 
All that did, however, was lead to ugly outs on the bases and mounting fan frustration. Attendance at Miller Park plummeted by 841,000 to just

an issue," he said. "It's just that we were short. We got beat, we got beat often and I was fired." 
Besides Royster and Narron, the managers dismissed since Sunday are Bruce Kimm of the Chicago Cubs, Luis Pujols of Detroit, Hal McRae of Tampa Bay and Bobby Valentine of the New York Mets. 
Royster often said the only reason Lopes, his best friend and mentor, lost his job was because the Brewers didn't hit for him. But they didn't hit for Royster, either, finishing with a .253 average. 
Royster said he hopes to man­age again, and Melvin wished him luck. 
"I told him to look at it not as a failure but as an experience," Melvin said. "I hope he does get another chance. Managers are the ones that lose the job but they're not always the ones that are totally at fault." 
Melvin said he will look for a disciplinarian and teacher in 
Showalter. "I've got a call into Buck," he said. 
Melvin said he considered retaining Royster but felt he had to provide a clean slate coming off the franchise's first 1OD-loss season. 
He said Royster's decision to sit All-Star shortstop Jose Hernandez eight times in the final two weeks to protect him from jeering as he neared the major league strikeout record, played no role in his dismissal, although Melvin criticized it. 
"It does tarnish the great year he had," Melvin said. 
Melvin said he considered calling Royster in St. Louis and demanding he play Hernandez but decided not to because he hadn't met either man and was busy enough with other busi­ness. 
Hernandez finished with 188 strikeouts, one shy of the record set by Bobby Bonds in 1970. 
Royster said he doesn't regret his decision.

Deliberations begin against alleged attackers of Celtics' Pierce 
Associated Press 
BOSTON 

Jurors began deliberations Wednesday in the case of three men accused of attacking Boston Celtics star Paul Pierce in a nightclub two years ago. 
William Ragland, Anthony Hurston and Trevor Watson are on trial for armed assault with intent to murder for the attack, in which Pierce was stabbed at least eight times and hit in the head with a champagne bottle. 
Despite being seriously injured in the attack. Pierce returned to play the entire 2000-01 season and led the Celtics in scoring at 25.3 points a game. 
The jury deliberated for about 2 112 hours before going home. They were scheduled to come back Thursday morning. 
During the three-week trial, two key prosecution witnesses changed significant portions of their testimony and failed to identify Ra.gland. Watson or Hurston as Pierce's assailants. Pierce also testified, and he was unable to positively identi­fy any of the three men. 
Defense attorneys said in closing arguments that police rushed to charge the men because of Pierce's celebrity. Prosecutors, however, said police found the right men after witnesses came forward and identified them as Pierce's attackers. 
The prosecution countered that two key witnesses had changed their testimony because they were afraid of retaliation. The witnesses, 
Regina Henderson and Krystal Bostick, identified Hurston, Ragland and Watson as Pierce's attackers when they testified before a grand jury 10 days after the Sept. 25, 2000 attack. Both women changed major portions of their testi­mony during the trial. 
"They can't take it back," prosecutor John Pappas said of their grand jury testimony. Pappas said Henderson had given the grand jury a different story because "Mr. Hurston, Mr. Watson and Mr. Ragland were not seated five feet away." 
Watson's attorney, Martin Leppo, said there were no wit­nesses who could identify his client in court as one of Pierce's attackers. He acknowledged that one woman said she initially saw Watson making stabbing motions at Pierce with a knife, but later recanted her testimony. 
"It happened, but who did it? Certainly, no one has selected Trevor Watson," Leppo said. 
Hurston's attorney, John Swomley, noted that even Pierce could not identify Hurston, and said the man Pierce originally identified as initiating the attack was much smaller that Hurston. 
"Tony Hurston did not attempt to kill Paul Pierce. There is no evidence of it," Swomley said. 
Last season, Pierce averaged 
26.1 points and helped Boston advance the Eastern Conference finals for the first time in 14 years. The Celtics lost to New Jersey in five games.

NFL 
Maddox to start for Steelers 
Associated Press 
PITTSBURGH 

Many NFL quarterbacks would feel uncomfortable going a few weeks with­out starting. Tommy Maddox is about to learn what it's like to play after 10 years without a start. 
Maddox, a former Broncos first-round flop who revived his career in the Arena League and earned ·another NFL shot by starring in the XFL, will be the Pittsburgh Steelers' starter Sunday in New Orleans. 
Coach Bill Cowher's surprising decision, announced Wednesday at a team meeting, sends 2001 team MVP Kordell Stewart to the bench for the third time in four sea­sons. It also signals that Cowher is running out of patience with an under­achieving team that was favored to win the AFC title but is only 1-2. 
"He came up in his little crystal ball that he want­ed to start Tommy," said Stewart, clearly upset by the decision. "It's not the end of the world for me, and I'm going to have an opportunity to start again... I just don't know when. 
Stewart went to the Pro Bowl after the Steelers (13-3) advanced to the AFC championship game last season, but he com­mitted six turnovers in the first two games of this season as the Steelers were manhandled by New England and Oakland. 
With Pittsburgh trailing Cleveland 13-6 Sunday, Maddox replaced Stewart to lead two scoring drives and a 16-13 overtime vic­tory. Running a hurry-up offense with four receivers, Maddox was 11-of-13 for 122 yards, a touchdown and an inter­ception. 
Afterward, Cowher said Stewart probably would remain the starter, but the coach changed his mind after watching game tapes and weighing his options. On Tuesday, he warned that no start­ing job was secure. 
Stewart has three touchdown passes, five interceptions and two lost fumbles in three games. 
"I just feel it's the right thing to do at this time, and now let's move on," Cowher said. 
The 31-year-old Maddox has never started and won an NFL game, going 0-4 as a rookie replacement for the injured John Elway in 1992. His last two starts were against the Cowboys and Bills, the Super Bowl teams that season, and 
he  split  time  in  both  
games  with  Shawn  
Moore.  

Maddox later played briefly for the Hams and Giants but left the NFL for six years until signing with Pittsburgh last year. Maddox was out of foot­ball for three years, run­ning an insurance busi­ness in Dallas, only to rejuvenate his career in Arena ball. Then he was the MVP of the XFL's one and only season. 
Maddox didn't get a long-term commitment from Cowher, and he wasn't expecting one. 
"At quarterback, you've got to go out and play and put your team in a position to win," Maddox said. "If you don't, there's going to be somebody else that's going to get a shot." 
Stewart could tell him that. 
After directing the Steelers to the AFC title game as a first-year starter in 1997, he strug­gled for two seasons until being benched for Mike Tomczak for the final five games of 1999. 
Stewart also began 2000 on the bench, behind Kent Graham, before regaining his job. He has since started 30 consecutive games, but that streak apparently will end in New Orleans, where he was a high school star about the same time Maddox was breaking into the NFL.

Gus Frerotte started a 30-3 loss in Atlanta, and Akili Smith went the distance in a 35-7 loss to Tampa Bay last Sunday. Kitna will make his first start of the season Sunday in Indianapolis. 
Regardless of what they say, the Bengals (0-4) never stick with a quarterback for long. 
"Coach LeBeau stood in front of the team today and said this is the guy he's going with and we're going to sink or swim," Kitna said. 
"I think that's what the team needed more than anything. Now, it doesn't matter if you like me or not, I'm going to be in there, so we might as well get along."

"This is a business," Smith said angrily. "They don't care about being fair around here. There's guys on this team that are fight­ing for jobs, there's coaches on this team that are fighting for jobs. So it's not about being fair." 
Smith was the third overall choice in 1999, but the Bengals gave up on him after less than one full season as a starter. Elevated from third string last week to face one of the NFL's toughest defenses, he was under constant pressure as he went 12­of-33 for 117 yards.

Michigan takes ice after loss of stars 
Associated Pr<!ss 
ANN ARBOR, Mich. 

Yost Ice Arena might not have been filled with fans, the pep band might not have been playing and no stats may have been kept. 
But the road to the Frozen Four started here on Thursday, when the Michigan hockey team officially began practice for the 2002-03 sea­son. 
For the fourth straight year, the Wolverines took the ice after the loss of a couple of stars. This year scoring leader Mike Cammalleri and defen­sive enforcer Mike Komisarek left school for the professional ranks. 
In what has become an annual event, Michigan and Michigan State have been picked to finish one-two in the CCIIA by both the league's coaches and the media. Michigan was also voted No. 3 in the U.S. College Hockey Online national preseason poll lhat came out Monday, trailing behind Minnesota and Denver. 
While the Wolverines are picked to win the CCHA, the league might be as close as H has been in years. According to Michigan coach Red Berenson, the Wolverines were only picked first because no other team in the league stood out. 
"We've had this before where we weren't necessarily the best team on paper," Berenson said. "But there wasn't neces­sarily anyone better than Michigan, and based on the fact that we finished first and that we did have a good playoff Marty Turco and Josh experience [we were picked Blackburn. Al Montoya hopes first] ... not because we were to be the fourth. Montoya the best team on paper." should be a senior at Huron

The team is looking to the second-year players to fill the scoring void left by Cammalleri, who led the team with 23 goals despite missing 25 games to the World Junior Championships and mononucleosis. 
"Everyone's looking for us to step it up," Nystrom said. "We're a big part of the team, so we got to play a leadership role. The freshmen coming in, they're looking at a small senior class, a small junior class and a really big sopho­more class, and they're going to be looking at us to make an example." 
The Wolverines may be start­ing a 17-year-old between the pipes. Since Berenson took over the Michigan program 18 years ago, three goalies have come in and started their freshman year: Steve Shields, C h r i s 
Gartman and 
Noah Ruden, who will see playing time should Montoya have difficulty adjusting to the college game. 
"We recruited Montoya with the idea that he would be our starting goaltender," Berenson said. "And I think he'll get that opportunity. rf he looks like he needs help, I will be quick to throw in one of the other goalies because they're a little more experienced then he is." 
But Montoya isn't worried about being replaced as he ­just like the entire freshman class including Danny Richmond and Jeff Tambellini -is happy to finally get on the ice. 
"Ever since I committed last year, all I have been waiting for this year is to get on this ice at Yost," Montoya said. "And to be part of the tradition and add to it."

Paterno not punished for grabbing referee 
Associated Press 
UNIVERSITY PARK, Pa. 
Joe Paterno isn't at all regretful for grabbing an official's shirt as he was coming off the field Saturday. 
And according to Big Ten officials, he doesn't have to be. The conference has decided against taking action on the winningest coach in Division I-A history for chas­ing down referee Dick Honig after the Nittany Lions' 42-35 overtime loss to Iowa Saturday, Big Ten associate director of communications Scott Chipman said Tuesday. 
Earlier this week, the con­ference asked Penn State athletic director Tim Curley to gather information about the incident. Athletic depart­ment spokesman Jeff Nelson said after reviewing the videotape and interviewing people standing around the tunnel at the end of the game, Curley concluded there was no improper action and conference officials agreed with his assessment. 
"The process for review for unsportsmanlike conduct had not begun," said Chipman, who added the conference had "no comment on the incident because there was no violation." 
For his part, Paterno dis­missed the incident Tuesday at his weekly press confer­ence, explaining he did catch up with Honig but only said a few words to him before going into the locker room. 
"All I did was try to stop him because he was running ahead of me and I was run­ning toward the locker room and I grabbed him by the shirt and said he had two lousy calls," Paterno said, "Aren't I allowed to do that?" 

The two calls in question came during overtime on Iowa's sideline regarding whether players were in bounds. On replays, both calls, which went against Penn State, appeared to be incorrect. 
Paterno also dismissed the notion that he approached Honig, who he called a per­sonal friend, with any mali­cious intent. 
"I did not make contact," Paterno said. "I just stopped him, I came up from behind -I didn't try to knock him over." 
Such sentiments weren't isolated to Happy Valley. Paterno's fellow Big Ten coaches agreed with the decision to not enforce disci­plinary action against the coach, both because of how Paterno handled the situa­tion and because of his exemplary conduct in the past. 
Minnesota head coach Glen Mason said he was surprised by Paterno's sprint across the field, but also understood why he did it, especially con­sidering the plays had repeatedly been shown on the stadium Jumbotron. Mason said the incident was further proof that instant replay is needed in college football. 
"I was watching Monday Night Football last night, and they have the top officials in the game, and look at the number of calls they over­turn," Mason said. "I think it's a crime we don't have that luxury. I think we owe it to our players."

On another personal level for Johnson. in playing Notre Dame he will be competing against a school that he looked up to for years and even con­sidered attending. 
"Notre Dame recruited me 

for football and basketball.'' 
Johnson said. "It was a place I 
really considered going to, 
although I didn't take a visit 
there. You watch the movie 
'Rudy' growing up, and obvi­
ously it's the mecca of college 
football. But as you get older, 
you begin to sec where you 
think you fit in, and Stanford 
was the place for me." 
For four hours Saturday. the two sides -Stanford players and Irish coaches -will look across the sidelines and see nothing but another opponent. 
But through it all, there will be no lack of respect and admi­ration from Johnson's side. 
"It's going to be a big game no matter who the coach is." Johnson said. "Hopefully he'll come over, shake hands and give a hug. It's just all love. I have all the love for them and their program, except on [Oct.] 5."

Freshmen making an early impact 
By ANDY TROEGER Spom Wmer 
A win at the Notre Dame Invitational would have made Irish coach Debby King happy no matter what. 
Winning the tournament with a lineup composed mainly of freshmen made her ecstatic. 
"It helps build a program," .said King when asked about the impact of the victory. "It really makes us look forward to the future." 
The most impressive fresh­man thus far has been Lauren GebatIPr, who tied for fifth at the Notre Dame Invitational and played well at Michigan State the ,veek before. 
"My short game has helped me out a lot." said Gebauer, "and my driver, when it's on, helps me have confidence in the rest of my game." 
Gebauer is far from the only freshman to have made a major impact early this sea­son. Sarah Bassett turned in the team's low score at Michigan State and finished in the top five at Notre Dame through two rounds before struggling in the final round. Also Katie Brophy overcame a poor first round at Notre Dame 
..... 
by firing rounds of 78 and 77 to garner a top-20 finish. 
Fellow freshman Lauren Barbir also contributed to the Notre Dame Invitational win over the weekend, and class-

In addition to the team's defense, Troy lauded the play of Walsh quarterback Carrie Campbell, who scored the team's only offensive touch­down. 
Walsh has lost for two straight years in the semifi­nal game to Welsh Family, putting a little added pres­sure on this year's team to make the playoffs.

BCSnow says Irish are 4-0 
Associated Press 

Notre Dame is 4-0 in the eyes of the Bowl Championship Series after all. 
Reversing a decision made less than two weeks ago, the BCS said Wednesday that the win by thn Fighting Irish over Maryland in the Kickoff Classic will count toward qualifying for a BCS bowl game. 
The change means the ninth-ranked Irish are now five wins away from qualifying for one of two at-large berths f'or BCS bowl games -Piesta, Rose, Orange and Sugar. Under BCS rules, teams must have nine "nonexempt" wins to earn a chance to play in a BCS game. 
Until this season, the first 19 Kickoff Classics, along with all the other "preseason classic" games were considered "exempt." However, since the date of the Notre Dame­Maryland game was changed to Aug. 31 from Aug. 24, it took place after the NCAA's window of exempt games. 
On Monday, Notre Dame athletic director Kevin White informed BCS coordinator and Big East commissioner Mike Tranghese that the NCAA ruled the game should not be exempt. A conference call fol­lowed with Tranghese, White and the five other BCS com­missioners -from the ACC, Big Ten, Big 12, Pac-10 and SEC. 
"With that, the commission­ers felt the Notre Dame game should not be exempt," BCS spokesman John Paquette said Wednesday. "Notre Dame will be able to count the win toward qualifying for the at­large pool of nine wins." 
The six conference champi­ons receive automatic bids to the BCS bowls, with two at­large teams selected. Notre Dame finished 9-2 in 2000 and played Oregon State in the Fiesta Bowl. 
Besides gaining a victory this week, the Irish also were ranked No. 1 in the New York Times and the Atlanta Journal-Constitution Colley Matrix computer polls. 
"Just took at the next poll, OK," was coach Tyrone Willingham 's reaction. "You don't get carried away with any of that. Our guys can see those examples all around them."
