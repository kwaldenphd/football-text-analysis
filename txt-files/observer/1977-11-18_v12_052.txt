Daydeaming healthy, says D~bin 

PHILADELPIDA [AP] 
Daydreaming is good for 'the health 
and people can slip into any 
situation that is pleasant for them 
without using hypnotism or tran­
scendental meditation, says a re­
searcher who studied how to relax. 
"All work, not one beter than 

another," says Dr. Louis Dubin, a 
dentist who teaches a course on 
hypnotism at the Temple Universi­
ty School of Dentistry. He was part 
of a four man relaxation study team 
for 18 months. 
Dubin likened relaxing more to a 

flight of fancy, a mind visiting trip 
to somewhere else -or doing 
something you like which always 
makes a person feel better. 
"It used to be if you closed your eyes, sat back in a comfortable chair, maybe listened tCI some music, that this environment of doing nothing was regarded as relaxing," Dubin said in an inter­

The Notre Dame Concert Series will present Haydn's "Pauken­messe," also known as the: "Mass in the Time of War," at 8:15 p.m this Sunday in Sacred Heart Church. Tht~ concert mass will be performed by the Notre Dame Orchestra, conducted by Adrian Bryttan, the University Chorus as prepared by director Walter Ginter, and guest soloists. 
An open dress rehearsal of the Mass will be held Sunday at 4 p.m. in Sacred Heart. The reht:arsal is suggested for children. Both dress rehearsal and concert are open to the public without charge. 
The solo quartet is comprised of noted Chicago performer!; Anne Perillo, soprano; Ann P'orayko, alto; Marc Allan, tenor; atitdl Ken­neth Bobis, bass. Miss Perillo gave a joint recital for the Notre Dame Concert Series in 1976 with her husband, Leo Michuda, violin. A Juilliard trained musician, Miss Perillo has appeared on the WTTW series "Artists Showcase." She teaches at De Paul Universi.ty. 
Haydn's "Paukenmesse" was written in 1796, at a time when the 27-year-old Napoleon Bonaparte was threatening Vienna from the south. The "Mass" is the first of six writt~n for Haydn's life-long patrons the Eszterhazy family. The masses. , settings of the Catholic Ordinary, were written when Haydn was at the peak of his creative powers. They relf·ect the mastery of his symphonic writing also evident in the London sym­phonies. Haydn's choral wr:iting in the masses shows the influc:nce of Handel, . whos oratorio the

1791. 
Haydn's masses, like those of Mozart, have been criticized for their lack of gravity and for their alleged sentimentality and flip-· pancy. Haydn's response, accord­ing to the historian Grout, was that when he thought of God hi~: heart "leaped with joy," and that he did not believe that God wolilld be displeased with praise given ''with a joyful heart.''

We now recognize that it is sometimes a mistake, that relaxa­tion is unique to the individual, that it means different things to dif­ferent people. Some people are geared to move rapidly. They have to be doing something. Their best way of relaxing is doing what pleases them most -playing tennis or scuba diving, skiing or driving a racing car. 
"Relaxation is a pleasant emo­tional state which subsequently results in a pleasant physical state," he said. 
"Suppose you enjoyed the sea shore," Dubin suggested. "You conjure a mental picture of a beautiful balmy day, the sun shining, the water rolling up the beach, the seagulls flying by. 
"With no other thoughts you let yourself go into whatever is pleas­ant for you. You leave your body where it is and transport your mind to another location and experience. 
"If you stop being on guard as you do in the course of your business, your professional. or your social life, and Jet go physically and emotionally, all the tension. all the apprehension, all the facade you create for the people around you, you are completely free of all responsibility. 
"The muscles relax. the mind relaxes, the physical well being of the person is almost divorced from his body and he will relate to what pleases him the best." 
Dr. Donald Morse, an associate professor of endontology at Tem­ple's Dental School, headed the team that measured the physiologi­cal body responses of 37 men and 11 women. 
The real shocker was that the instruction to relax did achieve deep relaxation," Mol'§e said.

'Awareness Week' emphasizes· Latino culture 
~-­
Friday, November 18, 19n 
the observer 
by Jerry Perez 

"What impressed me most this week was an awareness of how many ways each of us can affect United States-Latin American relations," claimed Peggy Osher­ger, co-chairman for Latin Ameri­can Awareness Week. 
A series of movies, lectures, seminars and musical performan­ces reflecting the current political and cultural status of Latin Ameri­can countries make up the week's program. which concludes today. 
According to Osberger, the pro­jects originators envisioned the week as a means to foster in the Notre Dame and IUSB communities "an awareness of Latin America's political struggles and the role the United States plays in that strug­gle." 
The Latin American Information Service (LAIS), in conjunction with the Justice and Peace Center of South Bend, is sponsoring the six-day series of events. Osberger also acknowledged funds donated by CILA and the Hunger Coalition. 
Besides the political dimension of Latin American Awareness Week, Chilean "arpilleras," see­narios of South American life made from strips of cloth, were on display in the O'Shaughnessy Art Gallery. These will be up for sale today. 
On Wednesday 35 people met in the Old Fieldhouse and combined efforts to creat a mural depicting Latin American life. The mural will be on display tonight at the "Pena Folklorica Coffeehouse," a fiesta complete with dancing, poetry readings, and refreshments, that

will begin at 7 p.m. tonight in the LaFortune ballroom. 
To conclude this week's activi­ties, Albert LeMay, professor of modern and classical languages, will speak about Latin American literary movements at noon today in LaFortune's Caron Court. In addition, a prayer service for Latin America will be held in Keenan Chapel tonight at 6 p.m. 
Justifying the program's atten­tion to the finer aspects of Latin American culture, Osberger com­mented, "Too often we make the mistake of thinking that the United States is necessarily the brightest and the best of everything." She argued the unfairness of the United States to impose its ways of life and culture upon less fortunate coun­tries. 
A documentary examining hun­ger in Third World countries kicked offtheweek'sevents last Sunday. A lecture by Tom Quigley, advisor on Latin America to the US Catholic Conference, highlighted Monday's activities. Quigley outlined the ''back-to-the-people'' movement of the Church in Agentina, El Salva­dor and Chile. A standing-room­only audience crowded into the library auditorium Tuesday to see Costa Gavras' film "State of Siege," an account of a political kidnaping in Chile. 
Speaking on Wednesday before a small group in the library auditor­ium, Marl Squella, an exiled Chile­an sociologist, lamented the inter­vention of foreign imperialism in underdeveloped countries. The young activist pointed out the American business interests main­tain higher profit margins in im­poverished countries than else­where. Futhermore, she added, American businesses are enabling the dictatorial regime in Chile to remain in power. 
Brown paper lunch bags, infor­mal seating and interesting rhetor­ic characterized a series of lunch­time seminars held in LaFortune Caron Court. Small groups of 25-30 people considered issues ranging from the authority of law in Latin America to the controversy sur­rounding the Panama Canal treaty. 
A recurring theme throughout the week's many lectures and comments, Osberger reported, was the United States' responsibility to support only governments which do not have continuing patterns of injustice. Acknowledging that the United States offers aid to many of the countries in Latin America, she asked, "How can we justify the support of_repressive regimes?" 
The main goal of the week, Osberger said, was to instill in each individual attending an awareness of his or her personal responsibility for human rights. "And I_'m not just talking about rights in Latin America. Consider South Africa. Even consider the United States,'' she added. 

Divorced remarrieds welcomed 
NEW YORK[AP]The lifting of the penalty of ex-communication for Roman Catholic's remarried after divorce openly welcomes them back into participation in the church -but not into sharing Holy Communion. 
For that, they'd have to take a further step to regularize their status. The new action was intended to encourage them to do it. 
It now, "is up to them to take the next step by approaching parish priests and diocesan tribunals to see whether the return to full Eucharistic communion is possi­ble," says Bishop Cletus F. O'Don­ell of Madison Wisconsin, a key figure in securing the change. 
The excommunication decree's removal was voted at his urging last spring by the U.S. Bishop's and approved by Pope Paul the VI last week does, however invite divorcedremarried catholics to par­ticipate in church life .. 
"It offers them a share in all the public prayers of the church com­munity," says O'Donell. "It restores their right to take part in church services. It removes certain canonical restrictions on their par­ticipation." 
Many in practice have been taking part with their pastors' approval, while not receiving Communion, despite the 1884 Baltimore Coun­cil's ex-communication decree, but its revocation gives explicit, official sanction to the growing practice. 
But it' doesn ;t, in itself, remove the barrier to sharing Communion. Nor does it alter the church's insistence on the permanent indis­solubility of valid marriages. 
However, for the nation's esti­mated three million remarried Ca­tholics -half of the six million who have divorced -various moderating moves have taken place to smooth the way back into a full communing participation. 
Basically, this requires a conclu-· sion that the previous marriage was ' not a real one. This is possible in varying ways under church prind­ples. 
But formerly, such a decision must come from a diocesan mar­riage tribunals. Their procedures have been simplified and speeded up to facilitate the process , al­though it still is clogged in hand­ling the volume . 
Broader grounds for annulments also now range from psychological or emotional immaturity at the time of the first marriage to evidence of merit in the second. 
While the number of annulments has swelled 30 fold in the last eight years, it still falls far short of the number of Catholic divorces. Also, policies of the tribunals vary sharp­ly from diocese to diocese. 
Other than tribunal decisions of annulments, another way divorced, remarried Catholics can return to Communion is through ''internal forum" decisions in their own, informed consciences. 


A SPECIAL THANKSGIVING MASS FOR THE UNIVERSITY WILL BE CELEBRATED BY REV. THEODORE M. HESBURGH, C.S.C. 
5:00p.m.--Monday, November 21 Sacred Heart Church 
This private alternative is occur­ing increasingly, through pastoral counseling, when evidence is una­vailable for a formal tribunal annulment, but when the conclu-~ sion is reached in "good faith" that grounds exist for it anyway. 
Such a decision, however, does not recognize the validity of the second marriage in the eyes of the church community. 

Polish experience ·in America 
Today through Dec. 11 the Notre Dame Art Gallery will present an exhibition of potographs entitled "The Polish Experience in Ameri­ca." This collection of thirty photographs has been assembled by the Kusciusko Foundation, an organization dedicated to the edu­cation and advancement of the Polish American Community.

at Ellis Island in the early 1900's, 
workers in industrial centers, typi­
cal scenes of Polish culture and life, 
and the political involvement of 
Polish Americans throughout the 
century. This exhibition has been

Education Project Institute for Ur­
ban Studies at Notre Dame, repre­
sented by John Kromowski, assis­
tant professor of government and· 
international studies. 
Also on exhibit at the Art

RSB:-small but active group 
[NOCR]-A small, but active force is emerging on the nation's college campuses in the form of an organization called the Revolution­arv Student Brilzade (RSB). 
Inevitably, some comparisons are made between the RSB and the infamous Students for a Democrat­ic Society (SDS) of a past era. Indeed, many of the RSB organiz­ers are former SDS people and the groups embrace similiar causes. The RSB, however, is admittedly a communist organization; the SDS was not. 
The RSB was formed in 1974 on two New York campuses and today has grown to a nationwide organi­zation claiming SO chapters. 
According to a RSB spokeswo­men. the group plans to soon merge with a smaller communist organization, Youth in Action, cre­ating a single student arm of the Revolutionary Communist Party of the U.S. A. A national office in . Ch1cago organizes national cam­paigns and produces a newspaper called Fight Back . Local chapters develop local issues and elect officers to participate in national meetings. 
The RSB claims a broad spect­rum of concerns. "Anything that affects students," according to an RSB spokeswomen, ''from elec­
tions  and  teacher  firings  to  cut­ 
backs  and  South  African  invest­ 
ments."  

Recently, the RSB has been particularly active in the steady escalating Kent State gymnasium controversy. RSB chapters around the country organized many dele­gations of sympathizers who travel­ed to Kent to protest. RSB also sponsored a national campus 
Smiley to present violin recital 
Julie Smiley, a graduate music major at Notre Dame will present a violin recital tomorrow at 8:15 p.m. in Crowley Recital Hall. Smiley, who received a Bachelor of Music from the University of Arkanasas in 1976, will perform music of Wieni­awski, Mozart, and Tartini. She will be accompanied by John Humphrey, also a graduate music major at Notre Dame. 
Senior trippers: pick up your WA rebates 
Notre Dame senior trippers who were on the World Airways plane out of South Bend can pick up their rebates at the Student Activities ')ffice in LaFortune from 8-5 Mon­day through Fridav. 
speaking tour by RSB member AI Canfora, who was wounded in the shooting at Kent State in 1970. 
Canfora says the Kent State experience changed him from a socialist to a marxist-teninist and taught him that ''the rich people are our enemy." Canfora's cam­pus talks typically drew only a few dozen listeners, but he is not discouraged. Mysticism and reli­gion have kept the "movement" dormant for a few years but the Kent State controversy represents the ''beginning of a revolution,'' he believes. 
RSB activities are spawnin~ pre­dictable controversy. At the U of Connecticut a petition was started in opposition to a student govern­ment grant of $350 to the local chapter for a bus to Kent State. At the U of Wisconsin -Madison, the Student Body President vetoed a similar grant to the RSB chapter. 
"Revolution is no tea party,"· says one RSB member, ''but we don't believe in 'revolution 'for the hell of it either." The organization can play within the rules -generally RSB chapters becorne officially recognized student organizations 
and there is even talk of running a presidential candidate some day. 
But RSB also demonstrates a belief in the old SDS tenet that "the end justifies the means." The 
U. of Illinois RSB <:hapter was placed on probation for distributing a leaflet that resembled an official university leterhead. And the Kent Sate U. chapted faced losing its · charter (which would have made it the first student organization to do so for discinplinary reasons since 1969 when the SDS was deregister­ed there), but instead was given only an "official wa.rning" for reserving a campus me:e:ting room, then turning it over tc. the non-regi­stered Mav 4th Coalition. 
Uncertainty about the fate of the 
Kent Sate Chapter was one of the reasons the site of the upcoming RSB national convention remains undecided at the eleventh hour. The dates have been set for November 19 and 20 and the site is expected to be either Kent or some other Ohio location.

SMC Board plans rape prevention measures 

by Caroline Moore 

The question of security prob­lems, in response to students' concern and fear, was among the items discussed at the St. Mary's Board of Governance meeting last night. 
Mary Rukavina, student body president, said she had been assured by Kathleen Rice, dean of students. that steps are being taken. 
This includes education of women in self-protection, films and speak­ers, to be presented by the police department or the Sex Offense Staff. 
Rukavina said she would like to see one more security officer hired for evening duty. This would allow for greater protection around the campus, she claimed. 
Rukavina also noted some recent improvements in security. She said that beam lights. always used by St. Mary's Security, are now being used bv Notre Dame Securitv. She also pointed out the change ·in the Shuttle route and the re-institution of the Notre Dame escort service. 
Mary Laverty. director of Stu­dent Activities. said "we must be realistic about security and not narrow ourselves to just one road. Both campuses are without outer walls or fences. thus there are manv areas in which an assult can occu~. We should not just make changes on St. Mary's Road." 
In other business. Rukavina an­nounced that although Phil Dona­hue was contracted to come to St. Mary's to give a sho~ the only possible date was Dec. 13. The Board of Governance decided to cancel his performance because it is so close to finals and student 
Sadat plans visit to Israel 
[continued from page 1) the "significance, both symbolic and substantive," of Sadat's trip. -As soon as Sadat returned to Egypt,the official Middle East News Agency announced the resig­nation of Ismail Fahmy, his foreign minister and top foreign policy aide since the October 1973 war. Sadat replaced him with Deputy Foreign Minister Mohammed Riad, but several hours later the agency said Riad too had quit. 
There was immediate specula­tion both resigned in protest of the Israel visit. The news agency said Sadat accepted both resignations and named Butros Ghali, a minister of state and member of the minority Coptic Christian faith, as acting foreign minister. -In Beirut, Palestinian leader Ara­fat condemned the planned visit and urged Sadat to cancel it. 
The Syrian statement claimed Sadat's visit would give Israel "Gains it failed to achieve through war or otherwise in the last 30 years,'' an apparent reference to de facto recognition of the Jewish state implied in such a visit. 
The statement appealed to the Arabs to "act to thwart the expected dangers, and search for proper formulas to intercept them." 
For the Israelis, the visit falls just short of answering their 30­year quest for Arab recognition. 
"But the psychological impact of this on the Arab world... " said an Israeli Foreign Ministry official, pausing to search for words, " ... the psychological impact will be immense." 
The announcement of Sadat's visit followed several days of public exchanges by the Egyptian and Israeli leaders. The trip's timing came as a surprise to U.S. and other diplomats, who had not expected it until later next week. 
Begin said Sadat's arrival date was set Wednesday, and the final agreement came in an exchange of letters through the U.S. ambassa­dors to Egypt and Israel. 
The Israeli told repoters in Jerusalem that after Sadat's visit to the Israeli capital he hoped to be invited to Cairo. 
response would be limited. The cost was also another factor for cancelling. 
An Tostal chairman, John Roo­ney made a second presentation to the Board. He asked for volunteers for the An Tostal Executive Com­mittee from St. Mary's student leaders. He asked ·the hall presi­dents to seek an An Tostal chair­man from each hall. He noted that he would like to see "someone who is good with working with people." 
Gentle Thursday will be held at St. Mary's this year. Rooney wants "a lot more mud" for the Saturday events and possibly a greased pig contest. He said girls will be part of Bookstore Basketball and that there ar~ plans for a sleepout for this year's An Tostal. 
Last year St. Mary's sponsored a circus for An Tostal. Rukavina suggested having a mini-marathon this year. The event would be between 8 and .16 miles and would be opened to both males and females. 
St. Mary's students are circula­ting a petition protesting the allotment of basketball tickets, announced Amy Hartzell, sports commissioner. She said the petition will be presented to "Moose" Krause and the ticket office to show St. Mary's concern. 
Hartzell noted that "Digger" Phelps recently spoke at St. Mary's to a group of about 75 students and he seemed impressed by the aud­ience's concern over the limited number of tickets. All the games are sold out, but Phelps said the girls can show their interest by attending open basketball prac­tices. Hartzell cautioned, however, that students should call ahead to be sure that it will be an open practice. 
The friction between St. Mary's Board of Governance and the Observer has lessened. Rukavina 
noted  that  ''the  Observer  has  
responded to  the  difficulties  and  
everything  is  cool  because  the  
coverage has improved."  ·  

Presently, a Women's Awareness 
Week is being planned for April 3-8. Nancy Mogab, Senior Class president, is heading the commit­tee to set up this event. Mogab said this event is still in the planning stages so they are open for ideas. She suggested that Women's A­wareness Week highlight a wo­man's perspective on business, health, sports, and the value of a women's college. 
The Board of Governance wel­comed a new member, Adriana Trigiana, chairman of the Fresh­man Council. Following the meet­ing she said she ''was impressed by the concern and enthusiasm of the people on the Board of Gover­
nance."

THEY CHOOSE TO SING THE BlUES 
Rrst in a three-part series by 

Frank Laurino 
Muddy Waters sat at the end of one of the long tables in the back room behind the stage. Occasionally he'd sip the drink he'd been fondling for the past half hour and glance to one of the few places where no reporters or groupies stood. His eyes twinkled  partly from the Johnny Walker, but mostly with an angelic, deceptively innocent sparkle of a five year old. 
He turned to a staggering girl who was talking with him. Muddy wore his patented Cheshire cat smile, plastered across his face. "Thank you, darlin' , " he said, picking up on a compliment. Then, adressing all gathered there, "You'll have to excuse me now. My voice is starting to go. I can't talk to anyone." 
Some people left. Others remained, staring at 
Muddy as if he were the risen Christ. To many people 
he is. He's the bossman, the man who Is the blues. 
Muddy surveyed the glazed expressions around him. "My, my, my," he mumbled as he turned to me, drink in hand. "People sure do enjoy getting messed up, don't they?" Then, after a sip and a thoughtful pause, "Gonna be a good one tonight." 
Muddy was the headliner for the final session of the 1977 Midwest Blues Festival. "They're here for you tonight, Muddy," I said. 
"Naw," he humbly replied, "they came here for more than me." 
True. People had come to Stepan Center Friday, Nov. 11 and Saturday, Nov. 12 to see the finest blues acts still in existence. 
Friday night, well before the start of the show, crowds with blankets and pillows and numerous paraphenalia for mind alteration had lined up in the snow outside Stepan Center. There was a genuine enthusiasm in the air. But despite all the excitement, few people, if any, recognized Edith Wilson, Little Brother Montgomery, Brownie McGee as they made their way to the doors. 
The three calmly walked past the members of the sound crew who were frantically making last minute sound checks. They passed the MBF director Bob Kissell, who was trying to resolve his frustration with one working light crew and no working spotlights. The 
atrists paid no attention. They came to have some fun. 
Backstage was no les.s hectic. MBF staffers were busily filling the refrigerator with beer and munchies. Someone was filling the coffee pot. 
"Ahl Where's the coffee?" yelled Brownie. He reached into his back pocket and produced a flask. "Yeah, I'm all set for some coffee!" 
Brownie started drinking. Edith went to the bathroom. Brother sat down and talked about a recording Meade Lux Lewis made in 1930. 
"No! It wasn't in 19301" screamed Brownie. "Man, that wasn'tevenLewis on that song! It was ... uh ... .'' "Now I know who you mean," replied brother. "But that was so long ago. I can't remember.'' 
Perry Aberli, former MBF director, darted in occasionally. He was wearing a MBF staff shirt, similar to the ones he and his wife were selling at one of the concession stands. The crowds had already .come in and were settling down to an improvisional inebriated travelogue of music. Perry announced that the show would start in 20 minutes. He had all the excitement of a little boy who· d peeked .under the· Christmas' tree. . .·, "Psyched yet, Perry?" I asked. He only smiled. 
Bob stepped on stage as the lights died. Stepan was 
not full, giving Bob yet another worry: gate returns. 
But he put his problems aside as the crowd applauded. 
His "Welcome to the 1977 Midwest Blues Festival" 
opener was drowned by clapping, whoops and screams. 
"We've got a good show lined up," continued Bob. 
"It took a lot oftime and effort. I hope we won't have 
any unfortunate incidents like last year." The 
reference was to the Albert King s'et of the previous 
year when some clown tossed a beer can at the blues 
guitarist and nailed him on the forehead. There would 
be no such occurrences this year. 
Little Brother Montgomery took the stage to play his 
mixture of urban blues, boogie-woogie, and jazzed-up 
hooky-tonk ragtime. 
"This is a song I first recorrted in 1929," Brother 
said, fumbling with the mike. "It's called 'St. Louis 
Woman Blues.' " 
Except for an occasional clink of a bottle, yell of 
"play the blues, Bro," and cough from something-or­. other, Montgomery played piano to a quiet, attentive audience. Among his selections were the timeless "Vicksburg Blues," "Boogie-Woogie Blues," and "The Boogie-Woogie." Edith Wilsonsoonjoined her 
piano player, belting out the blues. 
Meanwhile, Sonny Terry had caught up with his 
partner Brownie backstage. Brownie had changed into 
his "concert clothes" which included a brown pullover 
and African jewlrey. "Got to be comfortable when I 
play," he explained. "None of this jacket-and-tie 
junk.'' 

A roar could be heard as Edith and! Brother left the 
stage. Edith's face beamed as she !ntered the back 
room. "My! These people are so ~nice! I like this 
place!" 

Brownie finished tuning his guita1·. "Damn," he 
said. "Where's that coffee?" He smiled and reached 
for his flask, contented. "Oh well .. .'' 
Sonny, blinded in two separate childhood accidents, 
was helped onstage. Brownie, who had polio when 
four, limped behind. The ovation for the duo was 
amazing. "I can't believe the response the're 
getting!" exclaimed Perry. Sonny was simply 
mystifying on harmonica, and Brownie provided 
graceful complements on guitar as the two performed 
numbers they had recorded with artist:> from Leadbelly 
to Arlo Guthrie. 
During the Sonny and Brownie set, Son Seals had 
made his entrance with all the fanfare of a church mouse 
with a sore throat. For much of the evening, Son was 
visible to only a few. Not so with his band. They had taken over operations backstage: the drummer was adjusting the tilt of his tom-tom to the mi:cro-angle; the rhythm player quietly sat with a female: companion, sharing conversation and drinks; the bass player pranced about in a red jumpsuit and hat, looking like a negotiator of physical extravaganzas. 
The chanting for Son started soon after Sonny and Brownie left the stage. Perry was dancing and clapping in the wings. Bob had his arms raised 011. stage, trying to scream above the screams, " ...Son Se-als Band .. .'' 
Stepan exploded. Everyone was on tht!ir feet--those that were able. When Son finally joined the stage and strapped on his Guild, the noise hit pep-rally levels. 
Son wailed, burned, twisted, grimaced, squeezed every drop from his guitar. I remember glancing to the front row and seeing members of the Stumble Inn (a respectable off-campus social organization), in trans­fixed wxpressions. Once, a feedback-induced ~ose by Son during B.B. King's "It's My Own Fault/How Blue Can You Get?' had entranced the first few rows of swaying bodies and nodding heads.·' · 
At one point, Son's mike died. "That's O.K.," he yelled. "I don't need no mike to sing, the blues!" And then, tearing into a solo, he added, "I got another way ... " 
As the set ended, I rushed backstage to watch a sweating, panting Son Seals collapse into a chair. "Christ, it sounds like a riot out there," someone said. Son's manager appeared, trying to hold back part of his smile. "Boys, I don't think you're through yet." 
It was like blinking your eyes between Son's encore and Big Joe Duskin's opening number Saturday night. There seemed to be no passage of time, no change of atmosphere. Perry and Bob were running about, weary but excited. The only difference in the crowd was that it filled Stepan to capacity. Everywhere there were bodies, blankets, and bottles. Some people had already partied themselves out. The spotlights were back, working this time. Drums were being stacked offstage. The Stumble Inn had. Photographers battled the light crew for position in front of the stage. 
· Big Joe hopped into the spotlight and waved to the crowd. He dwarfed his piano as he flawlessly banged out blues piano standards. "I can't believe he's never made a record," a MBF staffer said. Midway through the act, a cowboy hat flew on stage. Big Joe donned it to the crowd's delight and waltzed to his electric piano/harpsichord. After a few of his originals, Big Joe was joined by Pine Top Perkins, Muddy Waters' piano player. for an extraordinary jam which sent the crowd flying. Dozens of people came to the side of the stage after the set to greet Joe and present him with various bottles of liquid refreshment. Joe turned to me with a mile-wide grin. "Man, I love it!" he said. "I L0-0-0-VE it!" As Mighty Joe Young's band set up on stage. the crowd made its usual shift to the back of Stepan. buying eats and t-shirts and records. Two people walked in with a newly-replenished ice chest and were distribu· ting the contents. "Man, I thought we had enough the first time," said one. A member of the Stumble Inn was scrawling some words on a MBF billing in the River City Review: 
And the rowdies were rowdy! 
And the blusies were blue! 
And everybody smiled ... a lot. 
... And it happened on my birthday; 
Ain't it a shame' 
Backstage, Joe Young was passing out copies of his latest record to some FM jocks. Perry did his excited-little-boy bit and gave me the "thumbs-up .. sign. 
The Mighty Joe Young Band was definitely the tightest band of the night, with better-than-average performances by the drummer and keyboard man. Joe was equally fine with some very tasteful guitar licks which were unfortunately not loud enough. 
Joe eventually brought the crowd to its feet when he jumped off the stage and played on his knees. People were dancing by the sides of the stage. One very good-looking yound lady was drawing her own crowd as she gyrated with a number of red-eyed young men. ''I hope this crowd doesn't burn itself out before Muddy comes on." was the response of a photographer. 
The Bossman by now had settled down backstage and was surrounded by reporters and fans. Someone in his band was pouring some Johnny Walker for a very young girl. "I just want a little bit to get my mother smashed," she explained to Muddy. "We came 90 miles just to see you." 
To Muddy's left was a very persistent and very messed up DJ from Pittsburgh. He was telling Muddy how much he loved Muddy, the blues, concerts, and drinking. "I drank a fifth tonight, Muddy," he proudly stammered. 
"Oh, gee," said Muddy, politely but very unim­pressed. "That's real nice." 
Muddy caught my eye as Mr. DJ tried unsuccessfully to hand the Bossman a joint. "Man. I'm tired." he said. 
The Muddy Waters Band had started playing. The leader would join in a few numbers. "Muddy, what are you thinking about?" I asked. 
"Man, I gotta get my act together," he answered blankly. ''Man,there'sa big crowd out there!" 
The Bossman was greeted with a standing ovation. Although the set was musically near-perfect, it was not without technical flaws. Muddy's guitar amp mike had to be quickly replaced, and PineTop's vocal mike had a gremlin attack. One guitar player (there were two besides Muddy) broke a string during a solo, but managed some very good riffs. 
Both of Muddy's guitarists were technically excel­lent, but they always seemed to be outshone by the Bossman's pick-and-run playing and occasional slide. Star of the night award goes to harp player Jimmy Roger. 
Because of transportation constraints, Muddy had to disappoint the Stepan audience with a short set, highlighted by the classic "Kansas City." 
"You didn't play 'Mannish Boy' for me," I said to Muddy after his set. "Sorry, my man," he apologized. "No time, y'know?" 
About 20 people were trying to get past MBF staffers guarding the wings. Kissel turned to one and screamed, "NO-one is to get back here. Understand?" 
The band played another song without Muddy. The cheering for "more" got louder. Perry was doing his clap-dance as he egged the crowd on. The guy from Stumble Inn continued to write: 
That's the blues: Abstract, patterned, Something for everyone. 
Muddy grabbed for a glass of Johnny Walker and rested near the refridgerator. "Man, that was a good one," he said, smiling. "A good one.''

The gallery has been transformed into an environment of monumental ellipses, cir­cular lines and graphic blacks and whites.

Support Letter Offering
__.__.__.iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiann titus 
"The right to food is a basic 
human right... the fundamental 
freedom is the freedom from 
hunger and starvation," according 
to the Carter Administration. The 
President has stated the import­
ance of feeding the hungry; now it 
is time for him to show his concern 
by proposing and implementing 
programs aimed at overcoming 
poverty and hunger. By joining in 
the "Offering of Letters" this year, 
people can prompt Carter to pro­
pose a new course of action dealing 
with the causes of hunger. 
The "Offering of Letters" is a nation-wide letter-writing campaign held around Thanksgiving. Each year key issues concerning hunger and poverty are targetted and people are requested to write to the · President and their congressmen asking for reforms. In previous years, this campaign has been instrumental in obtaining the Right to Food resolution passed in 1976 and a grain reserve program in 1977. The Right to Food resolution is one of the most far-reaching declarations concerning hunger made by congress and the grain reserve is essential to world food 
security. Probably neither would 
Budget constraints 
Dear Editor: 
At long last I have rallied to the 
support of Notre Dame. I am finally 
urged to take up the pen and write 
to "theEditor''. For months I have 
been reading the barbed and often 
misleading columns concerning the 
social injustice and immorality that 
is evidently leading to the ethical 
downfall of this university. The 
latest issues seem to be the 
question of unionization and the 
entrance of the Saga food program. 
Before the anguished cries of "unjust" are wrenched from the pursed lips of frenzied moralists, let me remind you that the Univer­sity is two things: 1) a Catholic University, and 2) a financial institution. As unfortunate as it may be, money is what keeps this university open. This money, how­ever. is not God-sent, but rather, it is yours, it is mine, and it is some pr~stigious group of backers' who have taken a liking to the golden dome And/or the Fighting Irish. Despite this seemingly endless supply of money, there is a limit to our financial resources, and it is this bounded capital that does not always allow us to act inthe most benevolent and generous manner. Although this may be stone cold reality, it is nevertheless true. 
This is not to say that financial excuses compensate for every apparent unethical decision made by the administration, but rather that the students should be aware of the fact that certain priorities have to be established. A choice ha~ to be made; either y.our tuition goes up (undoubtedly a cause for cries of alarm), we lose some of the distinguished faculty we have been fighting for, or we try to economize in other areas, i.e. dining halls, groundskeepers, heating bills, etc .. It simply does not work any other way. Much to the disappointment of those who evidently enjoy hold­ing the knife to the administrator's throat. many of the decisions made are done in the students' best interest. They arc concerned with upgrading an academic institution. After all, we are what Notre Dame is here for. 
While I don't sanction the cold­blooded slashing of innocents' jobs. I do ask the students, while remaining suspicious of adminis­
have been passed without the campaign of letters. This year we would like to see President Carter make the struggle against hunger one of his chief concerns. Speci­fically we will be asking for fair economic arrangements between nations and reforms within countries particularly our own. 
The Notre Dame Community is showing its concern about poverty already by fasting and giving money at the dining halls. This is good, but it is not nearly enough: The basic political, social, and economic evils underlying hunger still exist and can only be changed by taking political action. Writing to Carter is one opportunity of doing this, but it is important to write now since he will be deciding some of his major objectives within the next few months. 
The letters do not have to be long, but it is important that many people write. Briefly state your concern about the problem and urge Carter to take the initiative. The more support there is, the greater the chance that he will act. In the past the "Offering of Letters" has proved successful and with your support the results this year will be no different.

Justice 
and reality 
Dear EdJtor: 

As a male member of the Notre Dame community, I would like to comment on Marilyn Hosher's letter on Social Injustice (11-16­77). It is not the goal of men in general to keep women locked in hiding. No sane person defends the motives and actions of a rapist. However, it is a very different matter to discuss the ideologies of rape and face it in everyday practice. 
From a legal point of view, we must prevent society form nurtur­ing the idea of rape being provoked by the woman. Statements by judges that women's clothing sti­mulate rape and any woman accep­ting a ride from a man must expect sexual advances are intolerable. Rape is generally not motivated by sex, but by one person's desire to dominate another. Sex is the means used to satisfy this motive. Conjec­ture that women bring rape upon themselves is false and certainly should not be used to rationalize the man's act. Legally, the man is responsible and should be punish­ed for his transgression. · Yet, fighting the issue in the courts and in the streets are vastly different things. In avoiding any crime, it is never foolhardy to take realistic precautions. I don't be­lieve women are victimized when they are told that an area is unsafe at certain times. Sure, there are steps that can and should be taken. The distressing thing about hind­sight and new actions is that they are unbable to change what has happened. I regret that all I can do is offer my sympathy to those two girls. Yes. I'm fighting mad. but not mad enough to have loved ones of mine take unnecessary chances.

The mailbag is empty, so take up those pens, pencils and crayons, ND-SMC, and get those deep thoughts down on paper NOW! 
An alternative to the shuttle 
Dear Editor: 
Like every other citizen of this community, I was shocked and appalled to learn of the senseless rape of two SMC women on the ND campus last week. 
For many of us, the first reac­tions were, "Where was Security at the time?" (driving right by), "why don't they install a better lighting system?" (they did last year at a substantial cost to the University), and "If only the shuttles ran more regularly ... "(the night shuttle has since been rerouted). These are all areas that will continue to :receive adminstrative consideration. But the wheels of bureaucracy turn slowly and only with a lot of !:rease. We cannot always afford to wait for others to act for us. The cost is too great. 
In the final analysis, the respon­sibility is ours. How can we continue to function as free and independent citizens of this com­munity -pursuing our live!> with dignity and purpose and without paralyzing fears and limitations ­and yet still be mindful of our own safety? 
U.W.-Madison and other large universities have initiated pro­grams such as "Whistlestop" which encourage all female stu­dents to wear a specially engineer­ed, very visible and very distinc­tively shrill whistle around the neck at all times. This has proven to be a dcterrant to many would-be assailants. SMC presently offers a class in t.he art of self-defense. Eight or nine students signed up this semester -perhaps it should be mandatory? Educational "rape workshops" are presently being organized for the SMC Campus. 
All of these ideas taken together are helpful; no one of them, in itself is failsafe. I would like to add my voice to the clamor and suggest an informal "underground shuttle" between ND and SMC based on the tried-and-true principle of "safety in numbers." If there were desig­nated an official "safe-station" on either end of the "ND-SMC line" 
(i.e. steps of Holy Cross Hall-SMC and the lobby of ? ), students who are walking either way could meet and wait in sheltered safety until enough other students came along to make the trip together. There is enough traffic between the two schools so that, with some cooperation from the student body, the wait would never have to be too long. ND men could have the courtesy to pass by these "sta­tions," as they walked from one campus to the other, thereby providing a convenient kind of 
It is past-timt· that we all recognize our interdependence and responsibility for each other. It's a lot easier to join hands than to squeeze the bureaucratic oilcan.

Beef up ' security 
Dear Editor: 
In view of the recent rape incident involving two St. Mary's students, we wish to call to the attention of the administration the ludicrious state of our alledged security, "For what types of duty are our security officers qualified ?" Certainly not for dealing with crisis situations. 
While the physical condition and abilities of Notre Dame Sec­urity is admirably suited for the task of writing traffic tickets, these gentlemen are by no means capable of subduing a would-be assailant. It appears inexcusable to us that this glaring deficiency is allowed to perpetuate while such heinous offenses occurs. 
The answer is not better lighting, it is a security force armed, not of necessity with guns, but at least a group possessing the physical powers to cope with such emer­gencies.

Out of court 
Ticket 'misunderstanding' settled 
By Diane WUson Senior Staff Reporter 

A misunderstanding over an unwritten University policy on athletic tickets sold to faculty and staff resulted in a law suit settled out of court yesterday, according to Michael Busick, Notre Dame ticket 
manager. 
Zenon Dibzinski, class of '75 and former University employee, pur­chased two ND season football tickets last May at the official faculty-staff ticket sale in May. After Bidzinski left his position with the Universtiy in late July, the University sent him a notice in the 
first week of the semester stating two season football, basket-

he would not be receiving the tickets because he was no longer 
employed by the University.  The  
note  enclosed  a  check  for  the  
amount he had paid in May.  
Bidzinski, a first-year Law  
student,  said  he  protested  the  

revocation to Busiock and other universtiy officials, but no com­promise was reached. He filed suit· Sept. 16 against the university for breach of contract in St. Joseph County Small Claims Court. The preliminary hearing was set for Monday. but the settlement made 
any court action unnecessary. Eligible members of the faculty and staff are given the option of 

ball, or hockey tickets at a 50 percent discount each spring, Bu.­sick said. It is University policy to refund the ticket money if the person leaves the employment of the Universtiy, he added. He did state that this policy was not explained on the application how­ever. 
Thomas Mason, vice-president for business affairs, stated he believed that the policy is right, but did not know if the employees were informed of it. He added taht while the people involved should be informed, it was only logical that if a person terminated his employ­ment with the University he would no longer be eligible for tickets at a

ing to Bidzinski, he was unaware that the ticket office claimed the right to revoke the sale. He stated his main objection to the Univer­sity's action was that he was not offered the chance to purchase the 
tickets even at full price before the University refused delivery. 
The main element of the settle­ment Thursday included tow sea­son football tickets for next season purchased at full price. Bidzinski

said he settled because he con­sidered the offer to be the first one representing any sort of compro­mise. 
After filing in September, Bid­zinski learned of a similar case against the University of Michigan two years ago. In that case two Michigan law students were re­fused eight tickets they had pur­chased for the Ohio State-Michigan game. They filed suit against the school, but apparantly because of the adverse publicity of surround­ing the case the school settled out of court and gave the students four of their tickets free. 
Had the case gone to court this Monday it would have been too late for Bidzinski to receive the tickets. However, in the original suit Bidzinski had alternatively asked for !1,500 in damages in the event the suit was not tried until the season ended. this amount is the maximum allowable damages in Small Claims Court. 
Bidzinski said he wasn't inter­ested in fighting only for money and added, "Since the University would definitely appeal any mone­tary decision against them, I have no interest in getting involved in a law suit that I couldn't possibley win until long after I was gone from law school."

450 to eat rice and tea 
by Mary Leveno 
The St. Mary's World Hunger Coalition has scheduled their annual rice and tea meal for this Monday. Approximately 450 stud­dents will substitute the rice and tea meal for their normal dinner. 
For each who participates in this 
meal,  the  Hunger  Coalition  will  
receive sixty cents.  However, the  
Hunger  Coalition  stressed  that  

each student must attend the rice and tea meal or the money will not be donated. Money collected will be distributed through various agencies connected with this organization. Helen Gallagher, co-ordinator of the ND-SMC Hun­ger Coalition noted, "We would appreciate anyone bringing· to the organization's attention any other groups that are worthy." 
The meal will also serve to publicize the Thanksgiving "offer­ing of letters." Thousands of congregations across the land have joined in a massive "offering of letters" to show President Carter their support for an initiative to help the poor and needy. This initiative would include fair econo­mic agreements between rich and poor countries, including our own. Also included are proposals made for reforms within countries so that the poor will have opportunities fot adequate nutrition.

Irish open season at Michigan State 
by Brian Beglane Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame wrestling team opens up its 1977-78 campaign tomorrow at the Biggy Munn Invitational Tournament, hosted by Michigan State, with hopes of improving last year's 8-6 record. The loss of last season's co-captain, Dan Heffernan, is counterbalanced by the return of nine experienced grapplers who should constitute a well rounded Irish lineup. 
Tomorrow's Biggy Munn Invita­tional will feature some strong competition for Notre Dame's wrestlers, with teams such as Michigan State, Toledo, Central Michiga, Indiana State, and Wes­tern Michigan being represented. Irish Head Coach Ray Sepeta looks at the tournament as more of a steppingstone towards the rest of the ~cason. 
"I am taking a very low keyed attitude as we go into this tourna­ment because its main purpose is for conditioning and experience," noted the coach, who begins his third year at the helm of the Irish. "Every wrestler is guaranteed to compete in at least three matches so I see this tournament as an opportunity for experience. Each weight class is given a five pound allowance also (you can wrestle 150 though you weigh 155) so we won't be going all out to train for it." 

Pat McKillen, Dave DiSabato, Bob Dreger, and Mike Padden are four grapplers whom the Irish look to to fare well this weekend as well as throughout the season. Co­captain for third straight year, McKillen turned in a record of 20-5 last season adn will wrestle in the 150 pound class. The native of Waukegan, UJ., is just one match away from tying the ND career win record of 58. As a freshman, DiSabato ended with a recod of 15-9 and will once again compete at 
126. Three time monogram winner Dreger will be in the 177 pound slot while Padden will grapple at 167. 
· ''The Joss of Dan (Heffernan) will hurt but we are a more experienced team this year so I hope to do better. We face a very tough schedule and must avoid unjuries to stay competitive," com­mented Coach Sepeta, who is assisted by Jerry Ross-, a law student at DuLac. "I was pleased with last year but we fell down in the critical stages. I hope not to do that this season." 
George Gedney, will compete for Notre Dame at the 118 pound position. The wily junior finished last season with an 8-8-2 record. Art Branner, who never wrestled in high school and learned the sport at Notre Dame, will be in the 134 pound slot while sophomore Chris Fayo will grapple at 142. Senior Pat Landfried, who won the Na­tional Catholic Tournament as a freshman, will compete at 158 while junior Vince Keszei will go at 
190. Freshman Dave Rodgers will fill in at Michigan State at heavy­weight for Bob Golic, who will be performing for the Irish on the football field tomorrow. 
"Bob Golic can compete with anyone in the world. Jknow that is an extreme superlative but he has just got it all together. To be a 250 pounder and have all that speed and agility is very rare," said Coach Sepeta. "If he devoted all his time to wrestling he would be practically unbeatable.'' 
So the Irih take the fir:>t step towards what they hope will be a successfuf season. The Blue and Gold grapplers face a tough schedule and must stay away from injuries, as was not the case last year. The seven tounaments they are in will give them competition from New England to Colorado. Between these and the squad's dual meets, Notre Dame will see five Big Ten teams and two Big Eight clubs. "I know this schedule is demanding but I feel we have 
the chance

The Irish Eye 

Well. the Irish are just one game shy of clinching a bowl bid. The Air Force Academy upset Vanderbilt last week and will be trying to do the same to Notre Dame. tomorrow allowing Ben Martin to go out a winner. 
Although Irish fans will have their hearts in South Bend, even Notre Dame supporters will have to admit that all ears will be tuned to Ann Arbor to see what's happening between the Buckeyes and the Wolverines. 
The Crimson Tide and the Oklahoma Sooners are both idle this weekend. The Norman boys are preparing for their battle next week with Nebraska. while. Alabama is waiting for their season finale with Auburn in Birmingham. 
So. with the assistance of Tom Desmond. here are the Irish Eye's picks for this weekend's collegiate gridiron action. Air Force at Notre Da:me: The last time these two clubs met was in Colorado two seasons ago. Notre Dame found themselves trailing 30-10 entering the fourth quarter. However. aided by the last minute heroics of .Joe Montana. Notre Dame emerged victorious. 31-30. a win which was later termed. "the greatest comeback in Notre Dame history ... Tomorrow, Hen Martin says goodbye to the Falcons after 20 dedicated years as football coach. The Academy will no doubt be looking to send their coach out a winner. No one really expects the Air Force to challenge the Irish, but then no one thought that the contest two years ago would be close either. It's funny how much emotions can play in a ballgame at times. The Irish better not wait for some final period tallies to put them ahead. Where the Notre Dame gidders will be over the Holidays is riding on this game. This i~ not the time to let the Falcons soar down for the kill. If the Irish regain their form from two weeks ago, Notre Dame should triumph bv 21. Desmond backs the Irish by 35. Clemson at South Carolina: This battle is always the highlight of the year ror both squads. although the Tigers made an exception last week. Columbia is the sight of this contest and that will certainly help the Gamecocks. Every year this game proves to be a very tight battle and the favorite usually does not mean a thing. But, tomorrow the Tigers will chalk up w1n number eight and hope for their bid to the Gator Bowl as they down SC b~· b. Desmond Clemson by 3. Ohio State at Michigan: This garne really will decide a lot as far as the Big Ten picture. But, although this battle will decide who will be travelling to l'ascdena. nothing else is really at stake. Whichever of these two powerhou!>es attends the Rose Bowl does not matter. One of these teams will end up playing either Washington or UCLA in the January event. Even with a victorv in the Rose Bowl, the Wolverines or the Buckeyes will pn b<1hly not be fn the -National Championship picture. The Pa~ Eight rcpn.:!>entative will have at least two losses. and by defeating that team, not much will be proven. But, anyway, tomorrow's game is what is important at this time. Although a tie would be a welcome sight. allowing the Irish to advance in front of both teams in the polls, that is highly improbable. The Buckeyes have a stronger team, but playing in front of 
over 100.000 Ann Arbor fans is no easy task. Michigan needs this win to go to the Rose Bowl, while Ohio State could settle for a tie. Bo Schembechler and Woody Hayes are both known for their conservative play, but look for Schembechler to be a little more flamboyant. The Wolverines should capture this battle for the second consecutive year as they start to smell roses by 7. Desmond eyes the Buckeyes by 4. Texas A & M at Texas Christian: How much can the Horned Frogs take every week. Last Saturday, TCU had to suffer through their game against Texas. This weekend there is no let up in sight as the Horned Frogs compete with the Aggies. Since the game is in Fort Worth, the Horned Frogs might be good for one touchdown. However, the'Aggies will just be using this clash as a prep game before their contest with Texas next weekend. So, this battle will go to A & M by 35. Desmond looks for the Aggies to triumph by 21. · Delaware at Colgate: The Red Raiders defeated Northeastern last 
weekend to lift their season ledger to I0-0. However, even though Colgate won. they were dropped from the AP top twenty. It's hard to judge how good Colgate is when they have not played anyone that has a representative football team. But. just being able to go I0-0 is a l"cat in itself and deserves some recognition no matter what kind of schedule is played. Jim Coyle believe> the Red Rai9ers should capture win number II tomorrow as they defeat the Blue Hens by 10. Desmond backs Delaware by 4. Euylor at Texas: The Longhorns have to win this one if they expect -the Irish to maintain their interest in the Cotton Bowl. A loss to Baylor would send Notre Dame looking for a berth in the Orange or Sugar Bowl. But, Texas isnot about to let the Bears stand in the way of their chance to play Notre Dame for the tirst time in seven years. The Longhorns should retain their number-one ranking as they down Baylor by 14. Desmond looks for the Texas Longhorns to capture this one by 21. Tt:nnessee at KentuckJ: The Wildcats are unable to participate in any post-season competition, but that's not stopping them from proving they are among the best. Rumor has it that things are not going well in Knoxville. Fans expected Johnny Majors to bring them a National Championship in one year. but it just has not worked out that way. Majors will build a winner, but it's going to take a couple more years. Tomorro's contest. however, will go to Kentucky by 14. Desmond backs the Wildcats by 10. Purdue at Indiana: Mark Herrmann may be one of the nation's passing sensations, but, he is also leading the country in interceptions. Michigan held the freshman quarkrback to his lowest total completion mark last Saturdav. The Hoosiers '-"ill not be as fierce as the Wolverines, but this battle ~ill be unbelievably close. Indiana will give the Boilermakers a battle. but in the end. Purdue will end up ontop by 3. Desmond goes with the Hoosiers by 1. Mississippi at Mississippi State: This should be quite an intra-state battle. The game will be played in Jackson, the same place where the Irish met their doom. That stadium is where both teams play most of their major games. There will not be any home field advantage. but the Rebels should be able to down the Bulldogs and make up for last year's 28-ll thrashing. So, give this game to the Rebels by 6. Desmond backs Bulldogs by 7. Colorado at Kansas Stat!~: It's hard to believe that the Buffalos were destroyed by the Sooners. Is Oklahoma really that awesome or did Colorado just fall apart? Well. tomorrow the Buffalos will have an opportunity to redeem themselves. Kansas State should give Colorado the chance to get back in the win column as the Buffalos capture this confrontation by 10. Desmond goes with Colorado by 20. Wisconsin at Minnesota: The Badgers won their first five games and then proceeded :to drop the following quintet. Well, that is not known as consistency. Wisconsin will be trying to lift their record over the 500 mark, but Minnesota is a difficult place to accomplish that task, The Gophers are not overly consistent either, defeating Michigan and then losing to Indiana and Michigan State the next two weekends. However, tomorrow wm be the day for Minnesota! as they down the Badgers by 2. Desmond backs the Gophers by 6. U1set of the Week: illinois at Northwestern: Can the Wildcats win their last game for John Pont? Yes, Pont has decided to give up his reign as football coach and simply reside as athletic director. Maybe Northwestern can pull this one off. The Illini will not be a pushover, but if there's any chance, this is one of the Big Ten teams that Northwestern can beat. Although this is a wild shot, it's hard to go against Pont in his final game. So, give this contest to Northwestern by 1. Desmond follows Illinois by 14. Last Week: Eight right and three wrong for 73 percent. Guest picker, Bob Keen, had nine correct and two wrong for 82 percent. Overall: Eighty-five right and 22 inco.rrect for 80 percent, 
Joe Montana will start his sixth 
straight game at the Irish helm. 
The Monongahela, Pa. passer has 
thrown for 1,240 yards and seven 
touchdowns this season. His chief 
target has bee All-American tight 
end Ken MacAfee, who has 46 
catched for 698 yards and four 
touchdowns. Recently, Montana 
has thrown more to split end Kris 
Haines, who has had seven recep­
tions in the last two games and a 
total of 20 for the season. 
The regular Irish defensive unti 
is healthy and will start intact. 
Middle linebacker Bob Golic is only 
23 tackles away from the Notre 
Dame record of 144 tackles set by 
Greg Collins in 1974. 
The Irish have dominated the 
series with Air Force, winning all 
six previous encounters. In their 
last meeting, played at Air Force in 
1975, Notre Dame had to score 
three, fourth period touchdowns to 
overtake the Falcons and win, 
31-30. Montana was the quarter­
back who rescued the Irish on that 
day. 
Tomorrow's game marks the 
coaching finale for Air Force men­
tor Ben Martin. Martin announced 
last Thursday that he . is retiring 
from college football and the Air 
Force Academy after 20 years of 
coaching. 
The home finale is, of course, a 
sellout and game time is set for 
1:30. 
Big Ten action 
It's fourth ranked Ohio State 
versus fifth ranked Michigan Satur­
day for the right to go to the Rose 
Bowl, but Michigan State's Spar­
tans have hjopes of breaking 
between the Big Two for a second 
place finish in the Big Ten football 
race. 
If Ohio State, 7-0 in the 
conference, defeats, Michigan 6-1, 
and Michigan State 5-l-1, defeats 
Iowa, 3-4, Michigan State, would 
finish in second place, one-half 
game ahead of Michigan. 
The Spartans, however, are on 
NCAA probation and are not 
eligible for a bowl bid. A Michigan 
victory over Ohio State would leave 
the perennial powers as co­
champions again, with Michigan 
going to the Rose Bowl and Ohio 
State probably getting a Sugar 
Bowl bid. 
Ohio State is on record that it will 
not accept anything but a major 
bowl bid. Michigan has in<:Jicated it 
would go to a lesser bowl. 
While the two giants battle for 
the Rose Bowl and Michigan State 
hopes to break the one-two hold of 
Ohio State and Michigan, Purdue 
wil be at Indiana, Wisconsin at 
Minnesota and Illinois at North­
western. 
Indiana, 3-3-1, could clinch a 
fourth place finish with a victory 
over Purdue, 3-4. However, the 
Hoosiers will have to stop quarter­
back Mark Herrmann, who has 
passed for 2,289 yards and needs 
239 yards to break the single 
season Big Ten record of. 2,527. 
Indiana will be trying to retain the Old Oaken Bucket in one of the oldest rivalries in the Big Ten. 
The other two games involve retiring coaches John Jardine at Wisconsin and John Pont at North­western. 
Wisconsin hopes to end Jar­dine's career with a victory against favored Minnesota. Wisconsin won its first five games and them lost five straight. A victory would give the Badgers a winning season of 6-5 overall. 
Minnesota already has a 6-4 record and is assured of a winning season, the the Gophers need this one to break even in the Big Ten at 4-4. 
Falcon pep rally 
There will be a pep really for the Air Force game tonight at 7 p.m. in Stepan Center. Speakers will include Daryle Lamonica Officer Tim McCarthy and members of the Notre Dame football team.
