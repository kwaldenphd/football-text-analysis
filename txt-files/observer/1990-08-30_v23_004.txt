Iraq leader denies reports of secret deal 
Saddam Hussein says he will not be an easy target declares Kuwait to be a province of Iraq 



PARIS (AP) -Saddam Hus­sein said in an interview Wednesday that he is constantly moving so he won't provide an easy target for a possible U.S. air attack. 
Saddam spoke in separate in­terviews with French television and CBS, his first to Western reporters since the Iraqi presi­dent sent his forces to invade Kuwait on Aug. 2. 
In an hour long interview with CBS anchor Dan Rather taped in Baghdad on Wednes­day, the Iraqi leader declared flatly. "Kuwait is part of Iraq. 
We have said this, and the legislative bodies in Iraq have issued a clear decree saying that Kuwait is an Iraqi province," he said. 
Saddam also denied that he is making any secret proposals to pull out of Kuwait. 
A White House official con­firmed Wednesday that the Bush administration received a secret Iraqi offer to free all captives and withdraw from Kuwait if certain conditions were met. 
The conditions were that the international trade embargo against Iraq be lifted and Baghdad be granted access to the Persian Gulf and sole con­trol of an oil field that dips into Kuwait, according to the New York area newspaper Newsday. 
The White House official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the offer was rejected. 
In his comments for French television, Saddam asserted once again the United States cannot defeat Iraq, adding "I 
BONN, West Germany (AP)­Chancellor Helmut Kohl's gov­ernment said Wednesday the two Germanys will likely sign within two days a treaty providing the formal basis for unification, although

In  East  Germany,  an  esti­

About 10,000 nurses, garbage men, bus drivers and others stopped working for two hours in East Berlin. 
Strikes of up to two hours were also reported in Erfurt, Potsdam, Leipzig, Gera and several other cities.

residence hall survival tips. --------­
You must always find the positive in every situation. Since your trash will only be emp­tied once a week (some weeks, anyway) and you know nothing will possess you to do it, you have a new excuse to add to the list of reasons why you cannot hand in your final 
paper. 
Forget horror tales about malfunctioning software, and LaserWriters that refuse to spew out your document. Stop vandalizing toner cartridges and disks all over campus to lend credibility to your tale. You have it made. 
By the end of the semester you will have accumulated so much garbage that if you tell your professor that your dog threw the masterpiece away by mistake he will auto­matically waive your final requirement. After all, it is unsanitary to expect students to dig through that much filth. 
And who cares about a few mice, roaches or ants? The attendance rate at your par­ties will double, which provides a great means to impress the opposite sex. Your scope might think he/she has competition. 
Granted, this lack of cleanliness could 
cause a few odors. They'll cover up the 
ethanol smell beautifully. And there's always 
the outside hope that if the entire campus 
smells like a brewery after a couple of 
weekends, the administration will be forced 
to acknowledge the existence of alcohol. 
The 'behind closed doors' approach will 
be more difficult to take, since rectors will 
never know whether the Coke you're carry­
ing down the hall is liberally spiked with 
rum or whether it's the lingering scent of 
your last three social gatherings. 
Don't forget that you never have enough money by Christmas. If you stop cleaning your sink now, you should have enough plant life growing from it by December to decorate in lieu of an expensive Christmas tree. 
This might prove particularly effective for Planner and Grace residents hoping to im­press their Christmas Formal dates with some extra holiday spirit. 
I suppose we could actually be responsible about this but why take the easy way out? If you're concerned that the University is not adequately pampering you, consider finding other students with similar desires for neatness. 
How about the students who clean out the War Memorial fountain periodically when they dump a week's supply of soap into it?

NO student claims new parking lot construction is harming wildlife 
By PETER AMEND News Writer 
In the process of construct­ing a new parking lot on the corner of Juniper and Douglas Roads, five acres of foliage were removed, which has the Environmental Action Club (EAC) concerned about the safety of the wildlife in the sur­rounding area. 
Last summer, Sam Nigro, a member of the student-run EAC, discovered the destruction crew in progress. "I was strolling through these woods when I saw the crew of back­hoes digging up the trees. I asked one of the crew to stop what he was doing because he was killing a lot of plants and animals," he said. 
Nigro began a petition to stop the destruction of these woods. He said he obtained 136 signatures from both students and local residents. "I was working with a sense of des­pening right then and there and not that many people were on campus to know about it," Ni­gro said. 
Thomas Mason, vice presi­dent of Business Affairs, was one of the administrators re­sponsible for overseeing the parking lot project. Mason said the plot of land used for the parking lot was once farm property with few healthy trees remaining. 
"We removed all the old bushes and left the trees that were still good. Notre Dame has a strict policy that any tree removal for construction pur­poses has to get administrative permission," Mason said. When asked why the parking lot was being constructed, Mason said, "we have to respond to the needs of an expanding univer­sity." 
Within the 580 acres of woods that ND owns, Nigro's primary concern is the cluster of deer dens located a few yards from where the foliage

Kohl's coalition said the more restrictive West German abor­tion regulations should auto­matically extend to what is now East Germany at the end of two years. 
Earlier Wednesday, Schaeuble expressed confidence that all major obstacles to the treaty would be worked out. 
Schaeuble also said Kohl's government and West Ger­many's 11 states agreed that Oct. 3, the chosen date of unity, will be written into the treaty as an all-German national holi­day. 
The Interior Minister told re­porters the treaty will likely be signed Friday in West Berlin at a ceremony in the Reichstag, the former Parliament and one of Germany's most important landmarks, "if everything goes according to my own desires." 
He said the two German gov­ernments will hold one final round of negotiations on the treaty Thursday. 
Schaeuble made the remarks after Kohl met with governors of the 11 West German states, most of whom belong to the opposition Social Democrat Party. 
The conservative chancellor needs a two-thirds parliamen­tary majority to ratify the treaty and thus the support of the Social Democrats, the sec­ond-largest party in West Ger­many. 
The Social Democrats had given Kohl until Wednesday to reverse his earlier decision on abortion. During the past two days, he had given strong sig­nals he would do so rather than jeopardize the treaty.

Tornadoes tear through northern Illinois 
24 killed, more than 300 injured by surprise storms; Bush declares scene disaster area 
CREST HILL, Ill. (AP) -Res­cuers on Wednesday searched a tornado-devastated swath of northern Illinois for the missing and the dead, while folks began salvaging belongings from homes the twisters shredded "like an eggbeater." 
At least 24 people died and more than 300 were injured Tuesday by the tornadoes, which steamrolled across a re­gion known as "Tornado Al­ley," about 35 miles southwest of Chicago. 
Scores of people were left homeless. Others spent the day cleaning their yards, hammer­ing on temporary roofs, sifting through rubble, piling up be­longings in pickup trucks lining the streets in neighboring Plainfield. Offers of aid have poured in, including one from the Soviet embassy in Washing­ton.

South African groups begin discussions to end fighting 
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) -Police used bird­shot, batons and tear gas Wednesday to disperse student marches against fighting in black townships. Three blacks died in new violence, raising the toll to 518 in less than three weeks. 
Also Wednesday, delegations linked to the African National Congress and the conservative Inkatha movement met in Natal Province to discuss the violence, according to news reports. 
The independent South Africa Press Association reported a member of the ANC's national executive committee, Jacob Zuma, took part. 
Inkatha, who are supported by the Zulus, have been at war with ANC-affiliated groups since the mid-1980s in Natal. Battles erupted in the town­ships around Johannesburg on Aug. 12. 
Low-level delegations from Inkatha and the ANC have met previously, but ANC leaders have refused to meet Zulu leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi. They contend Inkatha spread the conflict to the Johannes­burg area this month to broaden its constituency. Inkatha accuses the ANC of terrorizing other black opposi­tion groups to try to consoli­date power. 
Inkatha and the ANC both oppose apartheid, South Africa's system of racial sepa­ration, but they differ on ways to fight it. 
Buthelezi reiterated his call Wednesday for a meeting with ANC deputy president Nelson Mandela. He also said in a statement the ANC should end, instead of merely suspending, its armed struggle and stop calling for sanctions to push South Africa to end apartheid. 
The violence around Johan­nesburg has eased markedly since the initial days of fight­ing, when dozens of blacks were killed daily. But protests against the fighting and allega­tions of police bias toward Inkatha have continued. 
In Cape Town on Wednesday, police fired tear gas and bird­shot at students from the Uni­versity of the Western Cape, near Cape Town, who were protesting the recent violence, witnesses said. 
Police Maj. Gys Boonzaaier told the independent South Africa Press Association the students were throwing rocks at police and passing vehicles. 
Separate protests against the fighting also were held in Jo­hannesburg and Pretoria.

In the township violence, two men were hacked to death and set alight at a migrant work­ers' hostel in Tembisa, north­east of Johannesburg, while another died at a hostel in Katlehong, southeast of the city, police said. 
Some anti-apartheid leaders have blamed police for fueling the fighting in the townships. 
President F.W. de Klerk told Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu and other church leaders Tuesday he would investigate charges that police sided with Inkatha. 
De Klerk has previously said individual officers may have acted improperly but that the police force as a whole followed orders to be impartial.

Fordyce said NEA support for the catalog conveys "ames­sage of hate and animosity to­ward institutionalized religion" sponsored by the federal gov­ernment in violation of the First Amendment's provision for separation of church and state. 
He asked the court for a perma11ent injunction prohibit­ing the arts endowment from "funding, sponsoring and en­dorsing works which promote blasphomous and sacrilegious hate material." 
The rndowment, an indepen­dent, $171 million federal agency that underwrites a wide variety of artists and arts or­ganizations, had no immediate comment on the lawsuit.

Malloy called the conference "a chance to interact with peo­ple from all over the world.~ He discovrred thaf "Notre Dame enjoys a good reputation inter­nationally." 
Such casual exchanges also provided an opportunity to dis­cuss such simultaneously oc­curring global events as the Iraqi crisis. The circumstances­forced an Iraqi university pres­ident to withdraw from the running for vice-president of the Central Office. 
While Malloy did not have a great deal of contact with the representatives of various Arab schools, he said, "comments from one Iranian university president indicated his desire to have better communications between their part of the world and ours." 
Earlier in the summer, Malloy also wont to Spain to address the Tri-annual Conference of the IntPrnational Association of University Presidents on the "various aspects of culture and how they affect what goes on in higher education." 
This also afforded him the 
opportunity to visit some of the 
sites of the world's oldest uni­
versities, such as Salamanca, a 
part of the world he had never 
seen before. 
However, the majority of the summer months were not spent abroad as Malloy's schedule was complete with meetings and addresses all across the United States. 

In Moraga, Calif., he spoke to an audience of 600 Christian Brothers at Saint Mary's Col­lege on the future of higher ed­ucation. In Chicago, he deliv­ered a similar talk on chal­lenges that face this higher ed­ucation. This included reference to demographics, diversity, the humane use of science and technology and a better sense of community. 
In addition, he addressed the National Press Association on the ethics of photo journalism, calling attention to today's ca­pacity for computer manipula­

tion, the issue of privacy and other topics "relevant to the re­sponsible practice of the pro­fession." 
With regard to the University, Malloy, along with the officers of the Provost office and their spouses, vacationed at the aquatic research facilities in Land 0' Lakes, Wise., to review the events of the past year and discuss plans for the 1990-91 academic year. He was also available on campus to monitor the summer activities.

CEO retires from position with ESPN 
NEW YORK (AP) -Roger Werner, who solidified ESPN's dominant role in cable televi­sion by acquiring rights to ma­jor league baseball and retain­ing the network's contract with the NFL, quit Wednesday as president and chief executive officer. 
Werner will become president and CEO of Prime Ventures Inc., a new company being formed by Bill Daniels, who has interests in several regional ca­ble networks. 
No successor was named by ESPN, an 11-year-old venture that was one of the first major steps into cable television. The network, which has 56 million subscribers, is 80 percent owned by Capital Cities-ABC and 20 percent by RJR Nabisco. 
The 40-year-old Werner, who joined ESPN in 1982 as a senior vice president, became presi­dent of the network on Aug. 17, 1988, succeeding Bill Grimes.

equity ownership was. 
They also denied that losses in the baseball package were the reason for Werner's depar­ture. ESPN said it will lose be­tween $30 million and $40 mil­lion this year after projecting a $31 million loss. 
"It has nothing do to with dissatisfation I have with ESPN," Werner said. "We were upfront anticipating losses on baseball. There are no sur­prises on the baseball losses. That is not a factor in my deci­sion to leave." 
Daniels owns a majority of Prime Ticket; a Los Angeles­based network, and has minor­ity shares of Home Sports Entertainment (Texas), Prime Sports Network (Denver-Salt Lake City), Sunshine Network (Florida). Prime Sports Network Midwest (Indianapolis) and Prime Sports Network Upper Midwest (Minneapolis). 
Granath said Cap Cities had had discussions about acquir­ing interests in regional sports networks, including those owned by Daniels, but that nothing was imminent. 
On Jan. 5, 1989, ESPN agreed to a $400 million, four-year contract with baseball that be­gan this season. The network's coverage is now dominated by baseball for half the year, with single games on Wednesday and Sunday and doubleheaders on Tuesday and Friday. A total of 1 7 5 games each season are being shown. 
Last March, the network re­tained its rights to eight Sunday night NFL games each season, but the price went up from $150 million from 1987­89 to $450 million for 1990-93. 
Granath said that profits for ESPN would be down slightly this year, but that was antici­pated because of the baseball startup costs.

riffey joins son in Seattle 
SPORTS BRIEFS 

Jr., 20, the Mariners' """"rT·m<T center fielder the past asons, attended a me news conference his father before 
sday night's game be­with Detroit. 
The father-son duo then took batting practice. 
The younger Griffey bantered with his father but said nothing to reporters. 
Griffey, an 18-year major league veteran, was placed on waivers Friday by the Cincinnati Reds for the purpose of giving him his unconditional release. He cleared waivers Wednesday morning, making him a free agent. 
Griffey publicly thanked Reds owner Marge Schott "for the opportunity to let this happen." 
He also thanked former Reds manager Pete Rose for bringing him back to Cincinnati in 1988 after he was released by Atlanta. 
Griffey initially retired Aug. 2 because the Reds needed a roster spot. But he asked for, and received, his release from the Reds last Sunday. 
Griffey will wear No. 30 with the Mariners. His son wears No. 24.

their roster, the Mariners placed stopper Mike Schooler on the 15-day disabled list, retroactive to Saturday. Schooler, who has 30 saves, has been diagnosed with weak­ness in the back of his right shoulder and has been put on a two-week exercise program to 
strengthen it. 
When he left Cincinnati, Griffey was hitting .206 in 46 games. He had 13 hits, includ­ing a homer and two doubles, in 63 at-bats. 
He has a lifetime average of .296 with 148 home runs, 832 RBis and 200 stolen bases in 2,046 games. 
He was selected to three National League All-Star teams, in 1976, 1977 and 1980. He was a member of Cincinnati's "Big Red Machine" that captured the World Series in 1975 and 1976. 
Griffey Jr. had a .306 batting average with 18 homers and 62 RBis entering Wednesday night's game. He was eighth in the AL in batting and led the league with 152 hits. 
Seattle manager Jim Lefebvre said the elder Griffey would be asked to contribute down the stretch. 
"A lot of people are going to look at this as a dog and pony show," he said. "It's not going to be that way. He's going to play and he's going to make a contribution." 
Griffey said he wasn't ready to play Wednesday night, but Lefebvre said he would put him in the lineup as soon as he feels comfortable. 
"We're shooting for this weekend," he said. "It may be sooner than that."

Mitchell's 30th HR defeats Montreal 
MONTREAL (AP) -Kevin Mitchell and Robby Thompson rallied San Francisco with solo home runs in the ninth inning against rookie Bill Sampen.Mitchell, who brought the Giants within 5-4 with a two-run homer in the sixth against Dennis Martinez, hit his 30th homer leading off the ninth. Two outs later, Thompson hit his 13th. 
Jeff Brantley (5-3) pitched two hitless innings for the win and Steve Bedrosian retired the Expos in order in the ninth for his 10th save. Rookie Larry Walker had three hits, including a two-run homer, and drove in three runs as Montreal built its 5-2 lead against Kelly Downs. 
Pirates 10, Braves 0 
Doug Drabek pitched a two­hitter and became the National League's first 17 -game winner and Barry Bonds matched his career-high with five RBis as Pittsburgh snapped a four­game losing streak in a rain­shortened game. 
Bonds hit an RBI single in the fourth inning, a two-run single in the sixth and a two-run dou­ble in the seventh. The game was called with two out in the top of the seventh. 
Drabek's career-high 17th victory -he is 17-5 -gave him an 11-0 record against the NL West. He struck out five and did not walk anyone. Drabek, 8-1 since the All-Star break, is 10-2 this season following Pirates losses. Atlanta rookie Steve Avery (3-8) was the loser. 

Astros 1, Cubs 0 
Chicago's Rick Sutcliffe held Houston to a run and two hits in five innings in his first ap­pearance of the season follow­ing shoulder surgery but came away a loser when Mark Portugal and Larry Andersen combined on an 11-hit shutout. 
Portugal (8-9) won his fourth consecutive game, scattering eight hits in seven innings and striking out nine, equaling his career high. Andersen pitched two innings for his sixth save. He yielded three hits. 
Blue Jays 7,
Brewers 3 
Tony Fernandez ended three Toronto slumps with one swing Wednesday when he hit a three­run homer to lead the Blue Jays over the Milwaukee Brewers 7­3. 
The Blue Jays hadn't homered in 11 games and had totaled only four runs in losing their last five games. During the los­ing streak they fell from one game behind the first-place Boston Red Sox to six back be­fore Wednesday's game. 
Jimmy Key (9-6) was the ben­eficiary of the Blue Jays' offen­sive awakening. 
"I was just lucky to be pitch­ing today," Key said. "It was good for the team." 
Thursday, August 30, 1990 

Key gave up six hits, striking out six and walking none in six innings. Only Paul Molitor, who hit a two-run homer, doubled and singled to go 3-for-4, gave him trouble. 
Duane Ward held the Brewers hitless for three innings for his 10th save. 
"Key pitched well, challenged hard in, got his breaking ball over," said Milwaukee manager Tom Trebelhorn. "Ward pitched fine, too. They pitched 


PHILADELPHIA (AP) 
National League president Bill 
White disputed Joe West's in­
terpretation of what White said 
about breaking up player fights 
and the umpire's handling of an 
ejection. 
West had said Tuesday that 
White, who met with the umpire 
earlier in the day in 
Philadelphia amid feuding be­
tween West and the 
Philadelphia Phillies, told him 
umpires "are not to become in­
volved in any more fights." 
White issued a statement in 
New York on Wednesday saying 
that only West was told not to . intervene, not other umpires. 
"In my meeting with Joe West 
yesterday, I told him that since 
he has been involved in a num­
ber of on-field incidents with 
players, he is no longer to 
physically touch a player," 
White said. "All other umpires 
are to continue acting as they 
have in the past." 
White attended the game 
West worked Tuesday night 
between the Los Angeles 
Dodgers and Philadelphia. The Phillies had criticized West for throwing Von Hayes out of a game in Los Angeles last week over a remark he heard Hayes make about another umpire. 

In his statement, White criti­cized West for ejecting Hayes, saying: "I also told Joe that I did not agree with his handling of the Von Hayes situation." 
But West, who worked Tuesday night's game at Veterans Stadium, told The Philadelphia Inquirer that White told him he handled the Hayes situation appropriately. West claims Hayes made a comment to umpire Harry Wendelstedt, though Hayes claims he was talking about the umpire to first-base coach John Vukovich. 
"At first, he thought it was unusual," West told the news­paper. "He didn't know that we eject players for comments they make to other umpires. Once I explained it all out, he told me I did the right thing." 
White met with Hayes, West, umpires union counsel Richie Phillips and Phillies manager Nick Leyva, general manager Lee Thomas and Vukovich. The Phillies' side was keeping mum on their talks with White, and Phillips did not immediately re­turn a phone call Wednesday. 
Thomas had called West ar­rogant and Leyva said West . was unprofessional and had a grudge against the Phillies. 
West had worked Phillies games against the Dodgers and New York Mets when fights broke out. In the Mets game, he lifted Phillies pitcher Dennis Cook during the brawl and threw him to the ground. 
White wasn't commenting Tuesday night on what he told West or Phillies representatives. 
"If they (players) want to fight, let them go kill each other. If it gets that out of hand, we'll call the National Guard," West said. 
"It's just a matter of forget­ting about what's gone on and getting on with it," Leyva said. 
Phillies fans weren't so willing to forget. When West was introduced Tuesday night as first-base umpire, they booed. 
better than we did." 

Paul Mirabella relieved Mark Knudson (10-7) with two out and two on in the fourth. He said Fernandez's homer was not hit very hard but it caught "a little jet stream that goes out that way." 
Boston 7, Indians 1 
Dana Kiecker shut out Cleveland on three hits for seven innings and Ellis Burks homered as the Boston Red Sox beat the Indians for their sixth straight win, all on the road. 
Wade Boggs had three hits for the Red Sox, who main­tained their six-game lead over second-place Toronto in the American League East. The six­game road winning streak is their longest since they won eighth straight road games in June 1986. 
Kiecker (6-6), a 29-year-old rookie, walked one and struck out six. He 12 retired the first 
12 batters before Candy Maldonado led off the fifth with a single. Maldonado singled home a run in the ninth against Rob Murphy. 
Mike Walker (1-4) took the loss, giving up five earned runs on 10 hits, nine of them singles, in 6 2-3 innings. 
Yankees 3, Orioles 2 
Matt Nokes and Kevin Maas homered on consecutive pitches in the sixth inning as the New York Yankees sent Baltimore to its fifth straight loss. 
Tim Leary (8-16) gave up one run on four hits in seven in­nings. He allowed only one bat­ter to reach base in the first five innings. 
Dave Righetti relieved to start the ninth and gave up pinch hit­ter Tim Hulett's two-out home run, but got his 29th save. 
1 
Trailing 1-0, the Yankees! took the lead in the sixth when Nokes hit a 1-0 pitch from Anthony Telford (1-1) over the right-field wall for his 11th homer. Maas followed by driv-' ing a breaking pitch into the right-field seats for his 16th home run. 
Twins 6, Chicago 1 
Mark Guthrie pitched a five­hitter and the Minnesota Twins turned four errors into four runs in the second inning to beat Chicago, the fifth straight loss for the White Sox. 
Chicago matched its longest 
losing streak of the season. The White Sox began the day 6 1/2 games behind Oakland in the American League West. 

APF'how Umpires such as Randy Marsh are free to break up fights betwee teams, National League president Bill White said Wednesday.

Sports Editor 
It was a very short scrim­mage, but Notre Dame coach Lou Holtz accomplished his objective ­get quarterback Rick Mirer some more work. 
Mirer, a sophomore from Goshen, completed 5-of-11 pass attempts for 92 yards in the brief scrimmage against the second-team de­fense at the conclusion of Wednesday's practice. 
"We tried to get some con­tinuity on offense and Rick Mirer some more work un­der fire," Holtz said. 
Mirer failed to complete six of his pass attempts, but some of those were catch­able. He had receivers open across the middle on two oc­casions but both of those balls were dropped. 
"We didn't catch the ball very well," Holtz said. "Our concentration was not very good, but we don't have to play tomorrow. This is the time we need to get those things done." 
Mirer is playing with a flak jacket like former quarter­back Tony Rice, something Holtz says he will not ap­preciate "until he gets blind­sided." One completion was about a 52-yard touchdown pass to freshman Lake Dawson. 

The Observer I Andrew McCloskey Quarterback Rick Mirer, pictured here in April's Blue-Gold game, is beging tested "under fire" as the Michigan opener approaches. 
Mirer works under fire in football scrimmage 
middle when he lined up at tailback. 
Former Irish assistant coach Jim Strong is setting some big goals after taking over as the head coach at Nevada Las Vegas. The Rebels were 4-7 last season and have not posted a win­ning record since 1986. 
"Our number one goal is to have a winning season," he said during UNLV's recent media day. "Our secondary goal is to win the conference championship and to go to a bowl game. And our third goal is to become a top 20 team." Strong has 32 lettermen and many key starters back from last year's squad. Wide
