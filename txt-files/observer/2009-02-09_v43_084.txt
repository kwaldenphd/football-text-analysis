Team raises money for cancer research 
Women's basketball 'Pink Zone' game garners $38,000 to support fight against breast cancer 
About 1,200 other schools are involved in the project, Mallory said. These schools each hold their Pink Zone game on a dif­ferent day to benefit the cause. 
"We want to raise money for breast cancer research and make people more aware," she said. "We basically want to get the message across." 
Mallory said a silent auction took place before the game to raise funds, and doctors and members of breast cancer sup­port organizations spoke dur­ing timeouts and handed out pamphlets before the game to raise awareness. 
Breast cancer survivors spoke during halftime, Mallory said. Along with the basketball

The Notre Dame Women's basketball team abandoned its normal uniforms in favor of pink jerseys during Sunday's game against DePaul University, helping to raise about $38,000 for breast can­cer research, according to sophomore Brittany Mallory, a sophomore guard on the team. 
The money was raised as part of the Women's Basketball Coaches Association's Pink Zone project, which enlists women's basketball teams around the country to desig­nate one game to be the Pink Zone game in order to raise money and awareness.

Observer Staff Report 
Notre Dame management pro­fessor Robert P. Vecchio was "seri­ou.<.;)y injured" after a fall from the roof of his Granger, Ind. home Saturday morning, according to a report by the South Bend Tribune.

Warm temps surprise students 
By ROBERT SINGER 
News Writer 
Weather, like the success of the football team, has become relative at Notre Dame: a victory in the Hawaii Bowl is reason for optimism and 40-degree temperatures call for shorts. 
For the first time in weeks, temperatures aver­aged in the high 30s over the weekend, with the thermometer even hitting 54 on Sunday. Combined with the unseasonable warmth, the sun has melt­ed away feet of snow. 
"I haven't worn shorts or 
gone without a jacket, but I have worn my jacket open," sophomore Mistee Colbert said. 
Shorts, T-shirts, and fewer people wearing Ugg boots with sweat pants were spotted around cam­pus. Students commented that the warm weather has also affected the general mood. 
"You have everyone smil­ing, the bright blue skies, and snow on the ground. It looks like it could be March or April instead of February," Colbert said. 
"It looks like people are standing up straighter,"

ND sends care packages to troops 
Senior's 'Sweets for Soldiers' project supported by ND initiative 
By LIZ O'DONNELL News Writer 
Members of the 2009, 2010 and 2011 class coun­cils -with help from stu­dents from each class ­gathPred in South Dining llall Sunday afternoon to build care packages for sol­diers who are fighting over­seas. 
The care packages are comprised of an assortment of goods ranging from candy and chips to basic necessi­
ties  like  deodorant  and  
toothpaste.  
Also included in the  care  

packages is a thank you note to the soldier and valentines. A table was set up in the LaFortune this 
past week where students could sign valentines that 
would  be  placed in  the  
packages.  
Notre  Dame  senior  

Christine Cartwright and her brother Kevin created the project Sweets for Soldiers in her hometown. 
"My brother and I started this project because we wanted to find a way to sup­port our troops," Cartwright said. "We have a Jot of fami­ly in the Air Foree, so we feel very connected to the war." 
Notre Dame was first involved in the project last year when Cartwright was a junior in Lyons Hall. She and then-junior Alyssa Corcoran held the project primarily as a dorm event. 
"When we initiated the project in Lyons it ran very smoothly," Corcoran said. "The large turnout gave us confidence to move it to a larger scale operation. 
Cartwright and Corcoran brought the idea to the sen­ior class council during the first semester in order to open the project up to the rest or the school. 
The project's first campus wide event took place in December when Sweets for Soldiers made care pack­ages for the holiday season. A variety of holiday-themed goodies, including Santa hats and reindeer hats, were included in that batch of packages.

Observer elects next top Editor 
Observer Staff Report 
The Observer General Board elected News Editor Jenn Metz as the 2009-2010 Editor-in-Chief Sunday. 
Metz, a junior English and Romance Languages major with a minor in Journalism, Ethics and Democracy, is a native of Westfield, N.J. who joined The Observer in her freshman year. 
Metz, who Jives in Cavanaugh Hall, covered a variety of stories for three semesters before study­ing abroad in Rome during the spring of 2008.

INSIDE COLUMN 


FMy Life 
Have you ever passed a building, saw someone inside and laughed because the person is fat and ugly before realizing you are looking at your reflection? I haven't. But 
anyone who is  
a frequent vis­itor to the  Madeline Buckley  
Web site 'F my life' would know that  News Production Editor  
someone has  
had that  

unfortunate experience. 
There are only so many ways to procrastinate doing homework. Facebook and Perez Hilton run out of new stories and photos after awhile and Postsecret is only updated once a week. As a result, F my life is my newly discovered procrastination tool. 
On the site, anyone can post sad truths about their own lives, always signing off with FML. Feeling sad, stressed or over­worked? F my life is the perfect solution to feeling better because most people can read the numer­ous posts and think 'at least my life doesn't suck that much' over and over again. 
I was referred to this site by a couple of my friends, and we get a (somewhat misplaced) sense of satisfaction from laughing at the sad problems of these people. 
The doomed feeling that is a result of an unfinished paper due in 12 hours can be counteracted completely by reading about the woman who received a text from her boyfriend of two years that stated, "Don't worry I'm gonna break up with her soon. Love you." 
The disappointment that follows not getting that perfect summer internship also can be solved this way: 
"Today, my girlfriend dumped me proclaiming she wanted some­one more like her "Edward." I asked her who Edward was. She held up a copy of her "Twilight" book. She was talking about a fic­tional vampire. FML." 
It works for pretty much any minor problem or stressor in life. Some may criticize this form of de­stressing. It can be misconstrued as slightly obnoxious to laugh at other people's crappy lives in order to feel better about your own life. It does not really solve the problem of the unfinished paper or unemployment for the summer. This begs the question, can that sort of thing actually make you feel better? 
The answer is a resounding yes. It really does work. Although there are a few posts that are truly pathetic, most are posted in good humor, and they allow you to enjoy a good self-satisfied laugh before moving on with the day. 
So, take my advice, and visit www.fmylife.com. Most likely, whatever chemistry test is looming won't look so bad after you have compared your own life to the lives of the people that post on this site.

Escaped prisoner turns up in judge's trunk 
MOUNT CLEMENS, Mich.-A Michigan judge says he's learned a lesson about locking his car after a 16-year-old prisoner who escaped from a courthouse cell was found hiding in the vehicle's trunk. 
The Macomb Daily reports the teen had van­ished Friday after appear­ing in juvenile court in Mount Clemens on a pro­bation violation. 
Sheriff's deputies searched for about an hour until a security officer became suspicious when he saw a picture that had fallen to the ground outside judge's car. 

A deputy checked the car and found the boy in the trunk. 
Macomb County Circuit Judge Peter Maceroni says the teen likely used a but­ton inside the unlocked car to open the trunk. 
The judge says that from now on he will lock the car when he's at the court­house.

SMC sees increase in e-n1ail scmns 
By BECKY HOGAN News Writer 
Phishing scams have com­promised Saint Mary's e-mail accounts this year more than ever before, according to Coordinator of Student Computing Kathy Hausman. 
"This year we've had a larger number reply to phish­ing scams and that's why we've tried to make more of an issue of it," Hausman said. "We've tried to send e-mail messages to say that Saini Mary's will never ask for passwords over e-mail. Unfortunately, we've had more people respond this year than ever before." 
According to Hausman, phishing scams are an attempt to get near money. 
"A phishing scam is some­body pretending to be some­one they are not, and they want your personal informa­tion -passwords, date of birth, your mother's maiden name to get into your credit info," Hausman said. 
She also said that phishing scams have also affected local banks. 
"Notre Dame Federal Credit Union and First Bank have both had phishing scams ... where e-mails have been sent giving a link to a Web site asking to provide account info." she said. 
But Hausman also said that phishers are expanding the ways they acquire personal information by using e-mail account info to send further phishing messages. 
"[Phishing scams] are also being used to log into e-mail accounts to send spam and additional phishing mes­sages," Hausman said. 
Hausman also said that people with '.edu' accounts 

are particularly vulnerable to these scams. 
"I think [the increase in scams] is because the phish­ers themselves are getting smarter. They know that they can say that your account can be deleted because they are associating '.edu' accounts to faculty and students," she. said. "They are also specifi­cally _men~ioning your web­mail account. They are try­ing to use key words that stu­dents hear all the time, so it's more difficult to determine whether it's real or not." 
According to Hausman, no legitimate institution, includ­ing colleges and banks, will ask for personal information over e-mail. 
"If you receive an e-mail directing you to a phone number or Web site to pro­vide this information, do not use the contact information or links provided in the mes­sage. Instead, contact the institution using their official­ly published phone number or Web site and ask for instruc­tions," she said. 
Phishing scams can even affect students who have· not had their accounts compro­mised by phishers because e­mail providers can block users on an entire network. 
Hausman explained that Hotmail, MSN, AOL, AT&T and SBCGlobal have repeat­edly blocked saintmarys.edu accounts after one address has been compromised, pre­venting any messages with saintmarys.edu addresses from being delivered to intended recipients. 
Hausman said that the best way to identify a phishing scam is to see if an e-mail message asks for passwords, account numbers, social security numbers, 9r address­es. 
"Never give out that infor­mation over e-mail," she said. 
Examples of recent phish­ing scams subject lines at Saint Mary's include "final verification of e-mail account," "e-mail account maintenance," and "alert: mail quota and confirm email account." 
Hausman said a recent phishing scam reported by msnbc.com exposed an inci­dent in which a man's Facebook account had been hacked into, telling his friends that he had been robbed at gunpoint and need­ed money. Many of his friends responded, with some even sending money to an account without realizing that it was a scam. 
Hausman said that Saint Mary's Department of Information Technology has been working to educate stu­dents about phishing scams. 
"Not only are they seeing all e-mail_ messages that say this is a phishing scam, we've also got a number of different advertising campaigns," she said. 
The Department of Information Technology will hold a "Computer Security Awareness" event in Vander Vennet Theatre on March 2. Topics will include protecting your computer from viruses and trojans, a review of phishing scams, password security, and online identity theft. 
Hausman also recommend­ed the SonicWALL Phishing and Spam IQ Quiz tests how well one can identify a legiti­mate e-mail from a phishing scam. The quiz can be found at www.sonicwall.com/phish­ing/.

Plant, Krauss take home 4 Grammys 
Brown now under investigation for assault 
Associated Press 
LOS ANGELES -Robert Plant and Alison Krauss' unorthodox musical partner­ship yielded rich rewards on Grammy night, as the pair won a leading four Grammys, including record of the year for the haunting "Please Read The Letter." 
At the same moment that the show was going on, teen heart­throb and double Grammy nominee Chris Brown was talk­ing with detectives about an alleged felony assault on an unidentified woman the night before. Police records showed he was being held on $50,000 bail. 
Brown and longtime girl­friend Rihanna, also nominat­ed, were both slated to perform in different slots of the show, but separately dropped out at the last minute. The victim of Brown's alleged assault wasn't identified, and it wasn't imme­diately clear whether Rihanna's absence was related to Brown's. 
Jennifer Hudson was there, however, and provided the night's most emotional moments onstage. The Oscar winner took her first Grammy award -for best R&B album -for her self-titled debut. 
Hudson, 27, made no direct reference to the October killings of her mother, brother and nephew that kept her in seclusion until just this month. But while fighting back tears, she made it clear that her fami­ly was foremost on her mind. 
"I first would like to thank God who has brought me through. I would like to thank my family in heaven and. those who are with me today. 
Hudson later performed "You Pulled Me Through," a dramat­ic song about overcoming deep despair, with the lyrics: "When I was drowning, when I was so confused, you, you pulled me through." As she sang the last note, she looked directly into the camera and dissolved into tears once again. 
There were no tears as Krauss and Plant accepted their awards for their emotion­rich CD, "Raising Sand." The pairing of the former Led

senior Greer Hannan added. 
Friday, when the cold forced many to bundle up, Hanna walked to Sacred Heart Parish Center for a weekend retreat. On Sunday's return journey, she noticed a change had overcome the campus -much of the snow had melted and people were out jogging. 
"A retreat makes it feel like you're coming alive, and see­ing the snow melt reinforces that," Hannan said. 
A group of students gath­ered on Mod Quad Sunday to play Frisbee. They remarked that the disc was much easier to throw and catch without gloves. 
"The weather is so nice and warm and this is the first time I've seen green grass in a while," sophomore Kim Zeppelin rocker and Krauss, a bluegrass queen, may have seemed downright weird on paper, but the T Bone Burnett­produced album was universal­ly acclaimed. 
Plant said "Please Read The Letter" was "an old song that me and Jimmy Page wrote together post Led Zeppelin, and it's been given that Nashville touch, and it feels pretty good." 
The Grammy telecast was filled with eye-popping and eyebrow-raising performances, from Radiohead's collaboration with a college marching band to a televised black-and-white throwback performance from Jay-Z, T.I., Lil Wayne, Kanye West an,~ a very pregnant M.I.A. 
But the absences of Brown and Rihanna put a huge hole in the Grammy telecast. Rihanna was supposed to sing "Live Your Life/Disturbia" as the sec­ond performance of the night, Brown was later to sing "Forever." Each was nominated in the pop collaboration with vocals category, Brown for "No Air" with "American Idol" champion Jordin Sparks; and Rihanna for ''If I Never See Your Face Again" with Maroon 5. 
Brown was also nominated for male R&B vocal perform­ance for "Take You Down." 
Neither won a Grammy on Sunday, and the Recording Academy found able replace­ments for their performance slots in Justin Timberlake, AI Green, Boyz II Men and Keith Urban as they all sang Green's classic hit, "Let's Stay Together." No mention was made on the broadcast about the switch. 
According to the police report, released 90 minutes before the show began Sunday, Brown and a woman were in a vehicle in the ritzy neighbor­hood of Hancock Park when they began to argue around 
12:30 a.m. Sunday. Brown stopped the car and both got out, whereupon the argument escalated, the report said. 
The woman, who had visible injuries when police arrived, identified Brown as her attack­er, but he had left the scene, the report said.' 
Schlesinger said. 
''I'm just afraid that it's going to snow 12 inches tomorrow," sophomore Eddie McDonough added. 
Others were pessimistic that the change was only a tempo­rary reprieve, and not a sign of spring. 
"I definitely plan on enjoy­ing this weather while it lasts, because it will probably be snowing tomorrow," said Colbert. 
According to The Weather Channel Web site, the tem­perature should remain in the 30s for the rest of the week, even reaching the 50s the next two days. 
Sophomore Cait Listro said that the warm weather has made her feel better about being at Notre Dame. 
"It makes me feel. a lot bet­ter about being in South Bend for the winter," she said.

Gaza military rocket hits south 
JERUSALEM-Israel's military says a rock­et fired from Gaza in violation of an informal truce has struck an Israeli communal farm. 
The military says one car was set ablaze and several others were damaged by shrap­nel. No injuries were reported. 
Israel unilaterally halted a blistering, three­week Gaza operation on Jan. ·18. Hamas announced later that day that if would hold its fire. 
But the two sides have not agreed on a for­mal cease-fire. Egypt is trying to mediate such an agreement.

Capt. Chesley "Sully" Sullenberger said in an interview with CBS' "60 Minutes" that the sound of the geese hitting the plane and the smell of burning poultry entering the cabin was "shocking." 
"Oh, you could hear them," he said. "Loud thumps. It felt like the airplane being pelted by heavy rain or hail. It sounded like the worst thunderstorm I'd ever heard growing up in Texas. 
The interview with Sullenberger and the other four crew members was broadcast Sunday, their first since US Airways Flight 1549landed in the frigid water Jan. 15.

Judge approves pay raises 
SOUTH BEND -A judge has ordered the St. Joseph County Council to approve $79,000 in pay raises for his eight employees despite a projected $4.3 million county government deficit. 
Probate Judge Peter Nemeth had warned at a council meeting last month that he would order the raises through a judicial mandate after the council cut them from his court's 2009 budget.

IN BRIEF 

Republicans wary of stimulus bill 
WASHINGTON -Republican congressional leaders and a key House Democrat are voicing misgivings -but for different reasons -over the Senate version of an economic recovery plan costing more than $800 billion. 
Sen. John Ensign of Nevada:-and Rep. Mike Pence of Indiana, both members of Republican leadership teams, complain that the legislation has too mueh spending and not enough in tax cuts. 
A top House Democrat, Rep. Barney Frank of Massachusetts, says the Senate bill cuts spending necessary to protect the jobs of policemen and firefighters. 
The Senate cut $40 billion in aid to state governments contained in a House version of the legislation. 
The Senate is expected to pass its bill on Tuesday. It then has to be reconciled with the House version. 
Drugmakers' push boots murky illness 
WASHINGTON -Two drugmakers spent hundreds of millions of dollars last year to raise awareness of a murky illness, helping boost sales of pills recently approved as treatments and drowning out unresolved questions -including whether it's a real dis­ease at all. 
Key components of the industry-funded buzz over the pain-and-fatigue ailment fibromyalgia ar~ grants -more than $6 mil­lion donated by drugmakers Eli Lilly and Pfizer in the first three quarters of 2008 -to nonprofit groups for medical conferences and educational campaigns, an Associated Press analysis found. 
That's more than they gave for more accepted ailments such as diabetes and Alzheimer's. Among grants tied to specific diseases, fibromyalgia ranked third for each company, behind only cancer and AIDS for Pfizer and cancer and depression for Lilly. 
Fibromyalgia draws skepticism for several reasons. The cause is unknown. There are no tests to confirm a diagnosis. Many patients also fit the criteria for chronic fatigue syn­drome and other pain ailments. 
Experts don't doubt -the patients are in pain. They differ on what to call it and how to treat it. 

Plan supports higher education 
Stimulus package could offer boostfor student financial aid, campus construction projects 
Associated Press 
DURHAM, N.C. The stimulus plan emerging in Washington could offer an unprecedented, multibillion­dollar boost in financial help for college students trying to pursue a degree while they ride out the recession: 
It could also hand out bil­lions to the states to kick­start idled campus con­struction projects and help prevent tuition increases at a time when families can least afford them. 
But cuts of $40 billion for state and local governments in the Senate version were a big disappointment for col­lege leaders. House-Senate negotiations will determine whether education aid to the states -is relatively mod­est or massive -and how much gets directed to high­need institutions for build­ing projects, versus elite universities that would ben­efit if the final package spends more of the money on scientific research.

Unemployed use 
timefor~th,family 
Associated P~s 
FOND DU LAC, Wis. -Jay Capelle would give anything to get back his factory job of 32 years. At the same time, he's grateful to have extra time on his hands these days to care for his ailing wife, stay in shape and work on a long-planned baseball documentary. 
The unemployed are stressed out about unpaid bills, dashed retirement plans and the loss of workplace camaraderie. But many say life minus work also has its bittersweet upsides, including more time with family and friends, learning new skills, focusing on their health and pursuing hobbies. 
There is a wide range of opin­ions, of course, about just how sweet, or bitter, the experience has been. 
An idled auto worker in Wisconsin cherishes extra time with his kids, and his guitar. A former communications worker in Virginia fmds time for hiking as a distraction from the job search. But two jobless friends in North Carolina who've played plenty of golf together · say enough is· enough: they're ready again for the joy of earn­ing a paycheck. 
All of these people said they would give up their newfound free time in a heartbeat if they could land jobs. And most spend hours each day trying. But as unemployment spells drag on longer than anticipat­ed, they have allowed them­selves to enjoy activities not directly related to the job hunt without feeling guilty. 
Alex Swain, 36, of Leesburg, Va., said his fruitless search for work has been discouraging. Since losing his job last April at a wireless communications company, Swain has applied for more than 200 jobs, gone on 10. interviews and has not had a single offer. 
But rather than sulking in front of the television when he's not searching online job post­ings, Swain forces himself to keep up with hobbies like play­ing music, painting and hiking. 
"You can't stay in the house all day or you'll lose your mind," he. said. 
Others are spending time in the classroom. 
Andre Lovato, 55, of Waukesha, Wis., who was laid off from his job at a signmaking company in 2006, earned a degree in printing and publish­ing from a technical college in December. Lovato, who has applied for 35 jobs since then without any luck, devotes his free time to woodcarving, sketching and computer illus­trations. 
But as his unemployment drags on, he longs for interac­tion with colleagues and getting praise for a job well-done. 
"I miss showing my work and having people say, 'Hey man, you did pretty good stuff,"' he said. 
Associated Press 
CHEYENNE, Wyo. -When Erica Olivares ran away from home at age 16, the penalty was not a stern lecture -it was a month in Laramie County jail. Soon, under the tutelage of adult criminals, she was addicted to drugs. 
·"Methamphetamine, I'd never even heard about that. And I heard about that in there," said Olivares, now 26. 
Legally, she should never have been in position to learn such harsh le~sons. Runaways are not supposed to be put in jail, let alone meet adult law­breakers on the inside, under a 34-year-old federal law called the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act. 
Yet year after year, some states disregard key parts of the law with little conse­quence, an Associated Press examination has found. Those states included Wyoming, Mississippi, South Carolina and Washington in 2006, according to documents obtained by The Associated Press under the Freedom of Information Act. 
The federal law provides funds for compliance, money that can be withheld for failure to comply, just as millions in federal highway funds can be lost by states not setting a drinking age of 21. But the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act provides far less grant money -from $600,000 to about $7.5 million annually per state. This is less than the cost of building juvenile lockups and hiring guards trained to work 


States disregard juvenile justice lavv 
with juveniles. States feel less public pressure to comply, juvenile advocates say. 
The U.S. Department of Justice, which administers the act, has a policy of not naming publicly the noncompliant states and not disclosing how those states have run afoul of the law. As a result, many kids become victims, advocates say. 
"Kids' lives are literally at stake," said Liz Ryan, execu­tive director of the Campaign for Youth Justice, a Washington, D.C.-based group that lobbies to keep youths out of jail. "They can be harmed in adult jail, they can be harmed in juvenile correctional facili­ties." 
The Senate Judiciary Committee began debating renewal of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act in 2008. The process bogged down but is expected to resume in the new Congress. Ryan said she's hopeful that the Obama admin­istration will be on board to improve the law significantly and release to the public more information gathered under the act. 
Advocates say the law's renewal is a good time to open up {irocedures, require every state to have a full-time com­pliance monitor and reverse steep cuts in federal funding for juvenile justice programs. 
The law contains four core areas: 
+First, juveniles generally should not be held in adult jail. 
+Second, if they are put in an adult jail -for an adult felony or if space isn't immedi­ately available at a juvenile facility -they must be sepa­rated from adult inmates .. 
+Third, juveniles should not be locked up for age-specific crimes, such as running away or possessing alcohol. 
+.Finally, states should not lock up minority youth at a higher rate than other kids. 
The states in violation have remained largely unknown over the years -to advocates and even elected officials. U.S. Sen. Edward Kennedy, D­Mass., a member of the Judiciary Committee, has said he's had trouble obtaining information. 
"Congress does not receive reports on whether a state has met the standards in the act, and states are not required to publish their state plans. The result has been a serious lack of transparency and accounta­bility in compliance," Kennedy said in a statement to the AP.. 
Itwas only after a six-month, back-and-forth process under FOIA that the AP obtained records of states' compliance from the Justice Department's Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention. 
The office said itdoesn't rou­tinely -name noncompliant states because it doesn't want to embarrass them. 
"I don't think it's ever a good customer-friendly service to embarrass somebody, do you?" said Greg Thompson, an offic_e administrator who works with states to comply with the law. "I think we achieve more by working collegially with the states rather than trying to work adversarially with them." 

Organrecipients meet victim's family 
Five people receive organs from man killed in tragic church shooting 
Associated Press 
CLIFTON, N.J. -James O'Hea was told privately his failing heart gave him little more than a month to live. Terence Begley's diabetes meant more years of dialysis and deteriorating kidneys. 
That was before a tragic event -the shooting of three people in a church last November -turned life­affirming through the quick response of one victim's fami­ly. 
O'Hea, Begley and three other people received organs from 25-year-old Dennis John Malloosseril (mahl-LOO'-sir­ihl). He was shot and killed Nov. 23 as he tried to break up an argument between a fellow church member and her estranged husband, according to police and wit­nesses. 
O'Hea, Begley and the other recipients -Malta Hameed, 40, of Clifton; Migdalia Torres, 52, of Cleveland, Ohio, and John Muscarella, 22, of East Newark-attend­ed a memorial service for Malloosseril on Sunday at the St. Thomas Syrian Orthodox Knanaya (kah-nahn-NIGH'­ya) Church, where the shoot­ing happened. 
Before the service, the recipients had an emotional meeting with Mallossseril's parents. 
"They bent down and lis­tened to my heart," O'Hea said. "I had tears rolling down my cheeks." 
Torres, who has suffered for 25 years from lupus that has affected her kidneys, recalled jumping out of bed at 6 a.m. on the morning after the shooting when she received a call that an organ match had been found. Like the others, she admitted hav­ing mixed feelings about the events that led to her trans­plant. 
"I knew someone would have to die for me to get a kidney, but I didn't expect it to be the way he died," she said Sunday. 
For the 57-year-old O'Hea, who was suffering congestive heart fai~ure, the donation and transplant literally meant a new lease on life. 
"I was weak and basically bedridden," O'Hea said last week. "My cardiologist agreed that if I hadn't gotten a heart, I would not have made it through December." 
Begley, 39, who no longer requires the thrice-weekly dialysis treatments he has endured for the last four years, received Malloosseril's kidney and pancreas. Hameed received a liver and Torres received a kidney. 
Muscarella suffers from cystic fibrosis and· had been given a less than 50 percent chance of surviving more than two years had he not .. 
received  both  of  
Malloosseril's lungs.  
Malloosseril  died of his  

wounds on the night of the shooting, two days before he would have turned 26. His family decided to donate his organs. 
"It's so totally altruistic," said William Reitsma, direc­tor of clinical services for NJ Sharing Network, the non­profit organization that coor­dinated the recovery of Malloosseril's organs. "It's not like this family knew these people, these are peo­ple they've never met. It's not like you're doing this· for a friend or a cousin, it's some­thing totally altruistic, and our community isn't too given to doing this anymore." 
According to Donate Life New Jersey, more than 100,000 people nationwide are waiting for transplants, and an average of 18 people each day die waiting. 
"We are so happy we did it," Malloosseril's mother, Aley John Malloosseril, said Sunday. "We saw how we could help other people to live, and there is no way to describe how happy \o/e are to see them all, their spirit. I want people to learn some­thing from this; Dennis' life was lost but I want some good to come of it." 
The woman Malloosseril tried to help also was killed, and her cousin was seriously wounded. Joseph Pallipurath has pleaded not guilty to murder and other charges and remains in jail. 
Chief Assistant Passaic County Prosecutor John Latoracca said the case will be presented to a grand jury in the next few months.

DENVER -Rearing 32 feet high, the metallic blue mus­tang sculpture demands the attention of every traveler through Denver International Airport. 
But that wild look of "Mustang" is prompting some to wonder if the sculpture installed just a year ago should be moved somewhere less prominent. Alternate monikers suggested for the horse with the glowering eyes include "Bluecifer," "Satan's Steed" and "Blue Devil Horse." 
"What exactly was the deal with that horse?" said Rachel Hultin, a Denver real estate agent who's behind a Facebook site that derides the sculpture. 
About 28 million travelers last year passed by the rearing blue horse, located south of the main terminal. 
·"It's not the image you want in your head as you're about to board a plane," said Christie Carlson of the Denver suburb of Thornton. "My daughter asked me 'Is that the devil's horse?'" 
Stan Ryland, a business development manager from Huntington Beach, Calif., isn't bothered by the horse's look. 
"That's what horses in the wild look like," he said as he waited. to board a plane Saturday. "They survived the wilderness and the mean ones led the pack." 
The city of Denver commis­sioned the fiberglass sculpture from New Mexico artist Luis Jimenez in 1993, two years before the airport opened. His 1969 sculpture "Man on Fire" and 1990's "Vaquero" have been displayed at the Smithsonian American Art Museum. 

In 2006, Jimenez was killed when a section of the unfin­ished horse fell from a hoist at his Hondo, N.M., studio. Jimenez's sons, Adan and Orion, completed the sculpture, which was installed Feb. 11, 2008. 
"We worked very closely with the artist's family," said Erin Trapp, director of the Denver Office of Cultural Affairs. "I don't think that anybody ever considered not finishing." 
Jimenez's widow, Susan Jimenez, said the original pro­posal was for a sculpture of a buffalo stampede. That was rejected because buffalo were hunted to near extinction in the West. 
Jimenez then proposed the mustang -wild horses that symbolize the West and provid­ed long distance travel, like airplanes today. 
Trapp said any petition to move the sculpture wouldn't be considered until 2013, a city policy designed to give people a chance to get used to new pub­lic art. "People's relationships with art change over time. It's something you have to live with before you really appreci­ate it," Trapp said.

Emergencies abound at our fair uni­versity, and if a plummeting endow­ment, rising tuition costs, squirrel attacks, the erosion of intellectual life and the occasional sports embarrass­ment (to say noth­ing about the perennial furor over the Vagina Monologues) were not enough, you can add the disap­pearance of Notre Dame's "Catholic identity" to the list. Apparently, the Bernard Madoffs of the educational community have swindled us into an intellectual Ponzi scheme founded on faculty research, higher tuition costs and building booms. Now, we face a severe crisis of repu­tation -an academic liquidity crisis, if you will -as indicated by the huge drop in the proportion of faculty members who call themselves Catholic, less than two-thirds of what it was in the 1970s. As the reasoning goes, a Catholic professoriate is one that cleaves appropriately to Catholic tradition and the guiding principles of Notre Dame, and because we have let go of the former, we are losing the lat­ter. 
But have you noticed that the loud­est voices calling (at least, in this paper) for Notre Dame to reassert its Catholic identity in the undergraduate classroom tend to belong to people who spend the least amount of time in

it? I am not sure how teachers pro­
mote or stifle Catholic identity in the classroom, unless they roundly abuse their position. I doubt that it would 
matter much whether you have a Catholic as opposed to a Hindu teach­ing organic chemistry, a Catholic as opposed to an atheist dose-reading the Iliad or a Catholic as opposed to a 
Protestant solving a differential equa­
tion. 

The job of a professional academic (yes, graduate students count, too) is to impart knowledge, promote analyti­cal skills, all those other nice-sound­ing educational catchphrases -and nothing else. Students should be able to figure out their professor's or TA's intellectual interests, areas of expert­ise and maybe a favorite extracurric­ular activity or two based on their time together in the classroom. They should not, however, be able to figure out whether their teacher is or isn't Catholic. So unless faculty members go beyond the considerable bound­aries of academic freedom and begin promoting religious or ideological viewpoints instead of free inquiry, the classroom will never be a place where the university's Catholic identity is fashioned. It should not matter , whether the faculty is 1 or 100 or some in-between percentage Catholic. Saying otherwise is simply untrue, and arguing that the University should promote it is absurd. If Catholicism were a prerequisite for a job hire, it might not affect ho"Y class­es are taught all that much, but it would send a clear message that.in the eyes of Notre Dame, research and teaching skills are less important than one's religious orthodoxy. I probably don't have to spell out what that would do to the University's academic reputation. 
But campus culture is not made in the classroom. However much the quality of instruction, of students and of curricular range differs between universities, an English course at Notre Dame will still be recognizable to a student from Harvard or a stu­dent from Linfield College in McMinnville, Ore. Extracurricular activities, clubs, athletic competitions, administrative and marketing deci­sions and even the public debate that goes on in the pages of campus news­papers shape a campus' identity far more than what happens in discussion sections and lectures. And by that standard, Notre Dame's Catholic iden­tity is doing fine: Just take a look at the event flyers in O'Shag, the activi­ties sponsbred by the University's var­ious institutes, centers and offices and even the Faithpoint column that runs in this paper every other week. 
If that's not enough, I suppose those worried about Catholic identity might demand that one of the two TVs in the LaFortune main lounge be perma­nently set to the Sat 2000, the 24­hour Vatican TV network. But then the lack of ESPN might cause the sports fans to wonder if the University is losing its athletic identity ...

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Ordain fem.ales 

To preface this letter, I'm going to say that I have never done this before and therefore am a Viewpoint virgin. However, I cannot hold my thoughts in any longer for fear of unleashing them upon random passersby. I can't have that on my conscience. 
In his Feb. 6 Letter to the Editor "Pope deserves a break," Kyle Tennant spewed enough incen­diary comments for me to write a kitschy tell-all memoir ala Mommie Dearest. Although I could write about the fact that the Church, as a community of believers, needs to be in touch with the needs of said community (i.e. third-world poverty, among a laundry list of other concerns), I'm going to instead focus solely on Mr. Tennant's observation about the dwindling number of priests. This is a concern. but it has an obvious solution: Allow the ordination of women priests. Shocker! I'm sure this concept just opened a can of worms on the Notre Dame community, but it seems fair­ly simple. By allowing the ordination of women priests, the populace that has the potential to be priests doubles. That's math. Also, the ordination of women priests allows for women to enter the hierarchy of the Catholic Church, thereby having an ability to offer their insight onto matters of faith. 
I have never once heard a valid reason why women cannot be priests. Ever. I sincerely doubt that having a penis allows men to perform baptisms, and having a uterus prevents the ability to perform the last rites. The argument against the ordination of women priests generally devolves into an argument about tradition. Tradition is important; however, I feel that blanketing an entire issue under this word is just an excuse to exclude a group of individuals from having authority. Lots of traditions prevalent in the past are no longer in practice, such as saying the mass in Latin. However, blatant discrimination upon the grounds of sex (which tends to be frowned upon in most circles) is still a practice of the Church. I may not be the most religious person on the planet, but I will concede that I would be more willing to be an active Church-goer if the church became truly Catholic by including all the people in its community.

A defense of the Pope 

To those students who have spent the last week criticizing the Holy Father: Stop it. You all should be ashamed of yourselves. Here you are, attending the premier Catholic university in the nation and you attack the head of the Catholic Church. Seriously? What makes you think that you, someone barely out of high school, has more knowledge and insight than the Pope does in matters of spirituality and the shepherding of the Church? For you to assume that your judgment surpass­es that of the Holy Father's on these issues is incredibly, ridiculously and offensively arrogant. If you haughty ones are unwilling to accept the leadership of Pope Benedict XVI, perhaps this isn't the university for you. 
But you're probably wondering, what authority does this guy have to say these things? Isn't he, after all, "barely out of high school" as well? Certainly. But I am a Knight of Columbus. The Knights are ever-committed to defending our priests, our bishops, and yes -you guessed it -our Pope. Any attack on the Holy See will always be met with a passionate, rigorous and emphatic defense of the Holy Father. So I'm not just speaking for myself-I am speaking for the Knights of Columbus Council No. 1477. There's a reason that our organization has been dubbed "the strong right arm of the Church"-when the battle rages, we're always there, unified, defending our Church and her leaders. 
If you are interested in joining our Catholic brotherhood, e-mail Jim Redden at jredden@nd.edu. Our only requirements are that you must be over 18, Catholic and male. We are always looking for new brother Knights to join us in the good fight. God bless you all; God bless Pope Benedict XVI.

Beyond poor 
sportsmanship 
Having just returned from the women's basketball game, I am so excited about the victory over DePaul. It was also great to join in the efforts of the Pink Zone by supporting many organizations fighting against Breast Cancer. However, I was extremely annoyed and angered by the students in the front row of the student sec­tion -including our "beloved" Leprechaun -as well as members of the male cheerleading squad. While I must admit that I was grateful that they shared their pizza with me, I was not impressed by their overall sportsmanship and representation of Our Lady's University. 
Upon arriving to the game, they sat in the front row, which was clearly already reserved -one would be able to notice this by the shirts and jackets covering the seats. These people appeared to think that the seats had been reserved for them. These seats were actually reserved for some students in the Science department who were recognized early in the game for all of the cancer research the department here at Notre Dame has done and con­tinues to do. When these students returned, they shyly asked for their shirts and jackets, but they did not get to enjoy the rest of the game from the seats which they came early to reserve. As the game continued, the boys in the front row and certain male cheerleaders exchanged reactions (not all related to the game) and used language such as "f"ck," "what the f"ck" and "motherf"cker." Now I know they were placed in front of the stu­dent section, but we were on the isle and there were families with children who could not have been older than eight years old. On the other side of the student section sat more families, including cancer survivors. Perhaps theses students could restrain them­selves from using profanity for the two and a half hours that they are "cheering" on our girls. 
The most disrespect came during halftime. Since this was the special Pink Zone game, there was a memorial ceremony honor­ing survivors and those who have lost their battle with cancer. WNDU's Tricia Sloma introduced a clip from the Secret Sisters Society which featured people who have since passed away after losing their battles with cancer. During this short film, the stu­dents in front of me started using their best movie announcer voice to say things like "In a world where ... " and "Coming this summer ... " These comments were being made during a slide show of mothers, sisters, daughters and friends who had lost their lives to cancer. How could they be more disrespectful? As a child of a cancer survivor, I found their comments particularly harsh. Impolite and disrespectful do not seem just words to describe this behavior. Some of these people represent our University on a reg­ular basis at sporting events and at other events on campus, but they seem to have little regard for those around them. This goes beyond poor sportsmanship to being disrespectful to those stu­dents and community members who came to support the Fighting Irish. Today I was proud to support the Fighting Irish as well as the Pink Zone and its efforts, but I was ashamed to be associated with members of a student body who have no regard for the many lives lost to cancer.

Om.aha, m.usic Mecca. 

In my excitement for the upcoming Tilly and the Wall concert, I eagerly turned to The Observer Scene section to see how the musical love of my life would be described. On Feb. 5, I opened to the Weekend Events Calendar to find that the person who compiled the best bets for the week­end mistakenly chose what I am sure is an extremely educational and interesting movie at Browning Cinema over Tilly and the Wall for the Saturday's best pick. For this transgression, I was willing to forgive the Scene staff of The Observer. 
Until I read Patrick Griffin's Feb. 6 article about Tilly ("Tilly and the Wall, this week at Legends"). I actually had to read the phrase "the small­scale music scene of Omaha, Neb." twice-three times-before assuring myself that it was not a misprint. Saddle Creek. Cursive. Bright Eyes. The Faint. The Good Life. Son, Ambulance. Tilly. Omaha's music scene is any­thing but "small-scale." Rilo Kiley lyrics reference going to Omaha to "work and exploit the booming music scene" as early as 2002. Just two years ago, The L.A. Times published an article entitled "If It's Hip, It's Gotta Be Omaha." Rolling Stone magazine hailed Omaha's music scene as the biggest thing since Seattle's Grunge movement. Compared to the tradi­tional music Meccas, full of transplants hoping to make it big, Omaha's music scene is organic, coming from the city itself. After I got past the misleading first sentence, Griffin did an adequate at describing the band's journey, despite focusing too much on tap dancing-as-percussion and not enough on the sense of wildness and freedom that inspires the band's music and lyrics and is the real key to their growing success.

It's not about the m.om. 
First, I came across the AP article in front of The Observer, and then I read the Black Dog comic at the end about the crazy octuplets' mom. Yes, she is crazy if she wants to keep on having random sperm donor children. That isn't what I am contesting. Rather, people keep talking about the crazy mom and forget about the eight infants and six other children. Companies and corporations don't want to send the mom things she obviously needs because of her not-so-socially correct way of having children. To quote the AP article, " ... people are ready to boycott any corporations that help the octuplets or their mother." 
My question is this: Is it the octuplets' fault, or really any of her children's fault, that their crazy mom wants to keep haviri.g IVF sperm donated babies? I don't think it is. It infuriates me that corporations and really average people who would normally laud and donate to a set of multiples this large are letting their opinions about the mom get in the way. The reali­ty is that any help you give is really helping the babies, not necessarily the mom. They still deserve anything and everything that any other baby born into this world deserves. They, unfortunately just have a crazy mom getting in the way. I myself have a brother who had not one, but two babies before he turned 21 with a crazy wack-job of a girl. It's not my nephews' fault that they have a crazy mom and I do my best to love them and give them everything I think they deserve. Do the clothes or toys or diapers or formula I buy inadver­tently help her? Yes because then that's one less thing that she has to buy, but I don't do it to help her. I do it to help my amazingly beautiful little nephews. The same thing applies here. 
Most people may not agree with this crazy mom's family planning strategy (I know I don't) but should that stop us from helping out the little octuplets? No, because in the end, it's not the crazy mom who is going to suffer (she'lllikely just keep on having babies), but rather it's the children and they really don't deserve that.

Winslet Flexes Acting Muscles in 
"The Reader" 
By MAIJA GUSTIN 
Scene Writer 
"The Reader", based on the novel of the same name by Bernhard Schlink, tells the story of a young boy in post­World Wadi Germany who embarks on a passionate affair with an older woman. "The Reader" is nominated for several Academy Awards; including Best Picture and Best Actress. Director Stephen Daldry had tremendous mate­rial to work with, both in the novel and in the screenplay by David Hare, and was successful in some areas whHri perhaps failing in others. 
In the film, young Michael (David Kross) becomes sick on his way home from school and is  helped home by an older woman, Hanna Schmitz (Kate Winslet). Mter a long recovery, Michael returns to the site of his illness to thank her With flowers. 
She, both for her beauty and for her poise, entrances him, and a torrid affair begins. 
She awakens Michael's awareness of his own body, and in return, he reads to her. She devours the great literature that he reads aloud, and it acts as a precondition to sex: he must read to her first. But one day, Hanna disap­pears without a word to Michael. It is not until many years. later that Michael sees Hanna again. 
This time, Michael is a law student sitting in on proceedings 'for a war crimes trial from World War II. Hanna is there, being tried as a concentration camp guard. But this history was not the only secret Hanna kept. During the course of the trial, Michael learns an even deeper secret of Hanna's, one that has dictated her entire life, and one that forced her into the harrowing situ" ation of this trial. 
"The Reader" is a beautiful film that is best when giving a glimpse into the intimate interactions between Hanna and Michael. Some have deemed it too overtly sexual, but that is precisely the point. This isn't a relationship about love, at least not at the beginning; it is only a fulfillment of the individual needs of the two characters. To shy away from the imdity and sexuality would also dishonor the source materi­

But the sex is never gratuitous;

rather, it is the manner by which the audience comes to understand the characters. 
Daldry also succeeds in his subtle hints at Hanna's secret. lie wants the audience to be aware, .but always left guessing. However, the next stage of Michael's life, the time of the trial, is perhaps where the film fails the most. The war crimes trial is admittedly exciting and intriguing. but the film itself seems too stable, relying only on the plot and the acting to drive it. 
But as the trial comes to an end, and the film begins to center on the older Michael (Ralph Fiennes), Daldry's grace and beauty of storytelling return. Tho final half hour of the film is emotional and poignant. It brings Michael and Hanna together again, in perhaps an unexpected way, and provides a sort of closure for both. 
Where ''The Reader" succeeds the most is in the acting. Relative newcom­er David Kross both revels in his own youth and exemplifies maturity far beyond his age in the film. His role is difficult, but he never shies away from it. Even though he was only 17 during filming, Kross also holds his own against the veteran Winslet and brings warmth to the film. 
Ralph Fiennes is excellent as well. His screen time is less and mostly reserved for the end of the film, and his perform­ance has been critically overlooked, but he serves as an anchor to an emotion­ally tumultuous story. · · 
Kate Winslet, though, is the real backbone of the film. She received her sixth Academy Award nomination for "The Reader," and is well deserving of it. Most critics anticipated that Winslet's Oscar nomination would come front ':Revolutionary Road" this year. But where she displays traditional act­ing chops in "Revolutionary Hoad," with emotionally charged arguments with her husband and a fight against nor­malcy in the suburbs, she is perfectly understated as Hanna Schmitz. She does not have long tirades and mono­logues. to display her abilities. She is alway;o strong and sure, never waver­ing in her character, and making no apologies for what she must do. She is deserving of the praise she has received, and truly carries the film on her shoulders. 
"The Reader" is brutally 
honest. It does not glaze over the controversial themes of the original novel, and never tries to preach a message. It also never asks for pity for 
Hanna. It simply wants one to

This upcoming weekend, Steve Martin's latest film, "The Pink Panther 2," will be out in theaters. 
YPp, you read that correctly. "The Pink Panther 2." In the strange, alternative 
universe known as  
I Iollywood. people  Analise Lipari  
actually make  
sequels of remakes of other films.  Scene Editor  
If you don't  

remember the first "Pink Panther" remake, I wouldn't worry too much. As much as I love Steve Martin, I love the purity of the original "Panther" series just as much, if not more. Martin's 2006 remake of the classic Peter Sellers films just didn't work-Sellers' Clouseau was a case study in wry, bumbling, physical comedy, but Martin's faux Fran<;ais accent mwer holds up. More than 40 years after the original film's cinematiorelease, the remade version eventually grossed around $80 million. 
And the remake machine lives on. 
It's an impulse that filmmakers and stu­dios seem to lind inexhaustible: The move to redo old material again and again, often to the point where the remake's con­nection to the original is almost unrecog­nizable. "The Pink Panther 2" is only the most recent example of the remake machine giving audiences another retread. If viewers laughed at Martin's Clouseau, it's to his credit as a veteran comedian. But too many unfunny, un-dra­matic and un-compelling remakes have graced our cinemas to let one semi-suc­cess make up for years of bad movie memories. 
There have been some high-profile movie remakes in recent years, not all of which gained their reputations for good reasons. 
Some remakes are, to be honest, just shockingly bad. Gus Van Sant's 1998 ver­sion of "Psycho" is but one painful exam­ple. A shot-by-shot repeat of a I Iitchcockian classic, Van Sant's film swapped out Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins for Anne Heche and Vince Vaughn, and left audiences wondering where all of the suspense went. 
The 2007 Ben Stiller bomb "The Heartbreak Kid" was also a remake, tak­ing a classic Charles Grodin/ Cybill Shepherd black comedy and giving it the Farrelly brothers ("Then~·s Something 
MARY CECILIA MITSCH I Observer Graphic 
About Mary") treatment. 
Few may remember 2002's "Rollerball," but that film's violent take on its extreme subject matter lacked the subtlety of the 197 5 original. If we can, let's not look back on Jude Law's 2004 remake of "Alfie." \Vhile I haven't seen the 1966 original starring Michael Caine, I'm almost certain it was more winning than Law's tiresome trek through the role. 
And while the original "The Wicker Man" isn't exactly straightforward film­making, it's hard to watch the recent Nicholas Cage remake without cringing. 
Then. there are those remakes of films you loved the first time around. Sometimes they're underwhelming, some­times they're overwhelming. and some­times you have to ask: \Vhy was this made? 
While "You've Got Mail" wins some poin~ for its ability to make e-mail into somewhat compelling ftlm fodder, the sweet, quirky source material, 1940's "The Shop Around the Corner," doesn't deserve to get lost in the remake shuiTie. 1995's "Sabrina" is a similar example. While the new version starred Julia Ormond, Greg Kinnear and even Harrison Ford-whose fllm ventures I will always support-the Billy Wilder-directed origi­nal is a perfectly cast comedic confection. 
Occasionally, the remake does its sub­ject one better. It's a rare retread indeed that succeeds in eclipsing its source by raising the material to a whole new level. Brain DePalma's 1983 film "Scarface," for example, took a lesser-known AI Capone flick from 1932 and turned it into one of the most iconic drug warfare-flicks ever produced. 
And while its source material, "Internal Affairs," is seen as an achievement in its oWr! right, it was Martin Scorsese's take on the story, "The Departed," that fmally won this erstwhile directorial bridesmaid his due at the Oscars. 
In the end, you never know how a remake will turn out. Good, bad, or ugly, only one thing is certain: no matter what audiences may do, the remake machine will keep on running.

NCAA BASKETBALL 

Illinois beats Purdue 66-48,Washington over Stanford 
Associated Press 
CHAMPAIGN -Bruce Weber thinks the Top 25 hasn't been kind to Illinois. 
The Illini coach said that since the team edged into the rankings in mid-January, the first time in more than two seasons, it's forgotten to play the tough, smart defense that got it there. 
'It was kind of human nature where we started thinking we were better than we are and we reinvented ourselves,' Weber said. 'We just had to get back to what we did and who we were by guarding and play­ing our butts off.' 
The memory lapse ended Sunday when the 23rd-ranked Illini knocked off No. 12 Purdue, 66-48.. 
The Illini (19-5, 7-4 Big Ten) held the Boilermakers, who are playing without star for­ward Robbie Hummel, to sea­son lows in scoring, shooting percentage (32.2 percent) and 3-point shooting (2-of-15). 
'The key for us was our defense and our effort,' Weber said. 'We were able to get stops and get out in transition and get the crowd into it, and eventually broke their spirit.' 
Sophomore forward Mike Davis, who had 14 points and a career-high 16 rebounds, did much of the damage to Purdue (17 -6, 6-4). 
Davis has been as inconsis­tent as the rest of the team the past few weeks. Weber said that Davis had been fighting tonsillitis, as well as a related case of Bell's palsy, a tempo­rary facial paralysis. 
While that illness didn't directly affect Davis' play, Weber said, 'Mentally it bugged him. I think it took a toll.' 
Davis benefited Sunday from the absence of Hummel, who has been out with a hairline fracture in his back. Hummel stretch and points from the Illini that revved their crowd up to earsplitting volumes. 
Illinois opened the second half with a 9-4 run to go ahead 41-32, but Purdue rumbled right back with five straight points, including a crowd­calming dunk by Johnson, to pull to within 41-37. 
Purdue went cold again mid­way through the second half, hitting just one field goal over a five-minute span. Illinois used that stretch to open a 12­point gap at 53-41 with just under eight minutes to play. 
With their cold shooting, the Boilermakers were forced to look inside for openings that just weren't there. Beyond Johnson, Purdue's biggest inside threat, 6-foot-9 Namanja Calasan was just 1­of·-7 on the afternoon. 
Davis, on the other hand, thrived in the paint and out­side. 
The 6-9 Illinois sophomore had nine rebounds by half­time, and scored a half dozen of his points on soft jump shots. 
'Mike Davis was the differ­ence,' Painter said. 'He's got a good nose for the basketball. He's long and athletic.' 
Davis acknowledged that he'd been slowed by his ill­ness, but said he's feeling bet­ter now than he has in a cou­ple of weeks. 
'I'm getting my wind back,' he said. 'I'm getting better and been hitting the weight room a little more and getting stronger and healthier.' 
Demetri McCamey added 13 points for Illinois, which never trailed. 
Illinois' late run, the one that finished the Boilermakers, was .keyed by six points from Davis and seven from Chester

Pondexter scored 20 points, 
including a pair of key free

Thomas added 17 points. 

'We weren't worried about it. Coach wasn't worried about it,' Thomas said. 'He said the streak was nothing. He made a -little joke about i(, and that was it. It's good that it came to 
an end and we got a win.' 

Jon Brockman had 13 points 
and 12 rebounds for the 
Huskies (17-6, 8-3 Pac-10), 
who overcame a 10-point 
deficit to take a 35-34 halftime 
lead. Venoy Overton also had 
11 points. 

'I have to admit this one did 
look like some of the other 
games we've had here, but I 
thought our guards did a good 
job of controlling the game 
down the stretch,' Romar said. 
'Venoy was the MVP. He 
brought us a lot of energy.' 

Landry Fields scored a 
career-high 22 points and had 
10 rebounds to lead the 
Cardinal (14-7, 4-7), who've 
lost four of their last five. 
Anthony Goods added 12 
points and Jeremy Green had 
11. 

'It's frustrating,' Goods said. 
'We were getting decent shots 
but we were just missing 
them. It's no fun losing.' 

Stanford closed within 66-63 
on Fields' jumper with 2:18 
left. Thomas followed with a 
leaner and the Cardinal never 
got any closer. 

'Isiah drove to the basket 
and made an incredible shot,' 
Romar said. 'That was a big, 
big shot because it kind of 
broke the drought a little bit. 
Our guys got energized by that 
one. It wasn't the most spec­
tacular shot he's made, but at 
that point in the game, it was 
probably the biggest shot he's 
made.' 

Thomas has reached double 
figures in 17 straight games. 

Washington maintained its 
lead throughout the second 
half, though Stanford made a 
run to close within 64-60 on a 
breakaway dunk by Josh 
Owens with 4:01 left. 
Pondexter followed with a pair 
of free throws -he was nine 
of 10 from the foul line -to 
quiet the crowd. 

'We had 11 turnovers in the 
first half and we average 11 

turnovers a game,' Fields 
said. 'We have to be stronger. 
They came in and imposed 
their will on us.' 

Fields was 10-of-15 from the 
field and recorded his third 
double-double. The junior also 
had two blocks. 

Brockman recorded his 11th 
double-double and the 52nd of 
his career, the most among 
active players. His putback in 
the final five seconds of their 
last meeting gave the Huskies 
one-point road losses the 
Cardinal have suffered in con­
ference play. 

The Huskies scored 11 unan­
swered points in a run that 
spanned both halves and gave 
them a 10-point lead five min­
utes into the second half. 

A 12-0 run gave Stanford a 
25-15 advantage with 8:48 
remaining in the first half. 

The Cardinal made two of 
their final nine shots and com­
mitted six turnovers the 
remainder of the half, allowing 
Washington to go into the lock­
er room with a slight edge.

NFL 
NFC takes down AFC 30-21 in 2009 Pro Bowl 
Associated Press 
HONOLULU -With a huge red lei around his neck and a wide grin that could have stretched across Oahu, Larry Fitzgerald held up the gleam­
ing,  silver  MVP  trophy.  It  
sparkled in the sunshine  as  
much as his game.  

The only problem: It wasn't the Lombardi Trophy. 
Fitzgerald caught five passes for 81 yards and two touch­downs, 44-year-old John Carney kicked two fourth­quarter field goals, and the NFC rallied to a 30-21 victory over the AFC. The Arizona Cardinals' All-Pro receiver, coming off a record-breaking postseason and a spectacular Super Bowl in a loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers, earned MVP honors. 
But he said the victory over the AFC, which featured three members of the Steelers' defense, didn't ease the pain from the Super Bowl. 
'No, not one bit,' he said. Fitzgerald also took home keys to a new Cadillac. 
Tm just ghi.d we won, that's the most important thing,' he said. 
On a sweltering day, with 60 percent humidity, Kurt Warner started for the NFC and played just one series before making way for Brees. Warn'er was just 1-of-2 for 8 yards. 
'I would've liked to have won last week and not this week, if I could switch th·em out,' he said. 
Fitzgerald caught a 46-yard scoring pass from Drew Brees before the half and a 2-yard TD pass from Eli Manning for the go-ahead score with 4:07 to play. 
The NFC defense took care of the rest. Manning, making his Pro Bowl debut, was 8-of-14 for 
111 yards. While big brother Peyton had better stats, 12-of­17 for 151 yards and a TD, Eli got the win. 
'He didn't play the whole second half, so it's not about beating my brother, it's just about having fun,' Eli Manning said. 
The Manning brothers were the first quarterback brothers in Pro Bowl history. And Carney, who was a perfect 3­for-3, became the oldest player in the game's history. He boot­ed a 48-yarder with 2:06 remaining to make it 27-21 and sealed the win with a 26­yarder with 32 seconds to go. 
Sunday's all-star game ended a successful 30-year run at Aloha Stadium, with a sellout every year. The Pro Bowl will be played in Miami next year, a week before the Super Bowl. The NFL, which has been looking to increase the profile of the game, hopes to bring the game back to Hawaii. 
The players, who spent most of the week by the beach and sipping umbrella-adorned mai tais, were pretty unanimous in wanting the game to return. 
For Warner, the question now is whether this was his · final game in the NFL or, as a free agent, will he opt to con­tinue playing at age 38? 
'I don't know right now,' Warner said. 'Again, when I have a feeling one way or the other, I'll let everyone else know. I don't have a time frame. This is the first time right now that I am done hav­ing to think about football for a while, and I'm going to enjoy that part of it, enjoy my wife, enjoy my kids and then we'll make a decision as soon as we can.' 
The AFC was looking to hula dance into halftime with a comfortable 14-3 cushion after Kerry Collins connected with Owen Daniels on a 9-yard scoring pass with 28 seconds left in 


the half. However, that was· more than enough the time for the NFC, with all its weapons. 
The NFC took over at its 45 with 19 seconds left after a nice kickoff return by Clifton Smith. The~ ran two plays before Larry Fitzgerald hauled in Brees' 46-yard bomb with fellow All-Pro Cortland Finnegan on his back as time expired to pull the NFC to 14­10. 
It made for two huge end-of­the-half plays in consecutive weeks for Fitzgerald. But this time, rather than trying -and failing-to chase down James Harrison on his 100-yard interception returned for a TD, Fitzgerald was the one cele­brating. 

Fitzgerald also beat Finnegan on his second score. 
'These guys are such elite players, it doesn't take much time to get in the groove with these players,' Fitzgerald said. 'These guys were great.' 
The usual high-scoring affair surprisingly also featured plenty of defense. Despite rules such as no blitzing line­backers and safeties, the quar­terbacks were feeling the heat, at times buried by the defen­sive line. None of the passes had any room for error on throws against the speedy defensive backs. · 
The AFC had a chance to take the lead late, but Julius Peppers got in the way. Down by six, the AFC started its drive on its 20 with 4:03 remaining and got to midfield. Peppers then swatted a pass by Jay Cutler with his left hand and came up with the interception that led to Carney's 48-yard field goal. 
There were three straight drives ending with a turnover in a span of about 2 minutes in the third quarter alone, including two by Collins.

Oudin and Huber rally to keep_ U.S. win in Fed Cup 
Associated Press 
SURPRISE, Ariz. -A fiesty teenager and a transplanted South African led the way in a comeback victory for the United States over Argentina on Sunday in the first round of the Fed Cup. 
Melanie Oudin, a 17-year­old from Marietta, Ga., kept the United States alive by rallying to beat Betina Jozami 2-6, 6-1, 6-2 and tie the best-of-five competition at 2-2. 
Then Liezel Huber, born in South Africa but a U.S. citi­zen since July 2007, teamed with Julie Ditty to beat Jozami and Gisela Dulko 6­2, 6-3 to give the United States the victory 3-2. 
'We wanted it to come down to the doubles,' U.S. team captain Mary Joe Fernandez said. 'When Liezel's on the court I feel really confident every single time.' 
Huber and her usual part­ner Cara Black of Zimbabwe -are the No. 1 ranked doubles team in the world. After the match, Huber took the American flag and paraded it around the court. 
'Everybody got to play and everybody gave it their all,' Huber said. 'It's a proud day in my history book.' 
Fernandez decided at the last minute to go with the left-handed Ditty rather than Oudin or Jill Craybas. Ditty joined the team only after Bethanie Matteck with­drew on Tuesday because of a nagging hip injury. 
'I just did what Liezel told me to do,' Ditty said with a 
laugh. 
The triumph at the Surprise Tennis and Hacquet Complex in chilly suburban Phoenix sends the ·united States into a semifinal matchup against the Czech Republic. Defending champi­on Russia will face Italy in the other semifinal. 
Argentina had taken a 2-1 lead in Sunday's' first match when Dulko defeated Craybas 6-1, 6-3 in a meet­ing of the top two players in the competition. 
That left everything on the shoulders of Oudin, who turned pro only last year and is ranked 151st in the world. 
'She really dug deep,' Fernandez said. 'For some­one so young playing in their first Fed Cup when it's all on the line there -she had to win to stay in it ­she really came through.' 
Oudin acknowledged that she felt the pressure of hav­ing the team's fate left up to her. 
'I think that going into the match I was thinking about it a little bit too much and that's why I don't think I started off too well,' she said. 'But after the first set, I mean I knew I could beat her and I knew I could play better than that.' 
Oudin's victory was inter­rupted by a 30-minute rain delay. She was up 4-0 in the second set when the delay came. 
When play resumed, the second set ended with a double-fault by the 20-year­old Jozami. 
Oudin lost the first two games of the last set, then 


dominated the next six. Through it all, she kept her and the bundled-up pro-USA crowd's attention by yelling to herself after virtually every shot. 
'One of my huge things is my mentality on the court,' Oudin said. 'I never think that any point is different, even if I'm down like 5-0, I'm going to be running down every single ball and fighting as hard as I can.' 
Two of the games ended when Jozami, ranked 134th in the world, couldn't finish off with her trademark drop shots at the net. 

'She was obviously better than me,' Jozami said before quickly returning to the court for the deciding dou­bles match. 'I don't know how to explain it. I couldn't come back like happened in the first set.' 
The United States has won 17 Fed Cup titles but none since 2000. Argentina has never won a Fed Cup but has been to the semifinals twice. 
Fernandez invited Serena

and Venus Williams to par­ticipate but the sisters declined, citing scheduling difficulties. The semifinals will be played, probably on 
clay,  April  25-26  in  the  
Czech Republic.  
'I'm  hoping  Venus  and  

Serena will be available and they can play,' Fernandez said. 'You always want the very, very best and Serena and Venus are the very, very best. But you go with who can play and who's ready to go, and my team was ready to go.'

NBA 
Buzzer-beater gives Blazers vvin 

Associated Press 
PORTLAND, Ore. -New York's Nate Robinson couldn't watch his former teammate at Washington, Brandon Roy, in the final seconds against the Trail Blazers. 
Robinson pretty much knew what was coming. Roy's fmger­roll layup at the buzzer gave Portland a 109-108 victory over the Knicks on Sunday. 
"At that point there is nothing you can do, just put the best defense you have on him," Robinson said. "Unfortunately, he made it." 
Travis Outlaw made a jumper with 31.9 seconds left to pull Portland within one at 108-107, and AI Harrington missed a layup at the other end for New York. The Trail Blazers called a timeout with 4.3 seconds left before Roy took an inbound pass from Rudy Fernandez and drove for the winning layup. 
"I got a little nervous when it started to roll to the left, because I've missed a lot of those this season," Roy said. 
Robinson, on New York's bench for the final play, turned his back to the basket for Roy's shot. The two were teammates with the Huskies from 2002-05. 
Knicks coach Mike D'Antoni saw it coming, too. 
"He's going to get it," D'Antoni said. "You play as hard as you can on him and he's going to do that." 
Roy, who was selected to the All-Star team as a reserve, fm­ished with 19 points and eight assists, while Outlaw led the Blazers with 23 points. Greg Oden had 17 points and 12 rebounds for his 15th double­double of the season, and added a career-high six blocked shots. 
David Lee led the Knicks with 29 points and 11 rebounds. After trailing by 13 points in the first half, the Knicks built a 17 -point lead in the second. 
New York Was helped by its 14 3-pointers, including five straight in the third quarter. Tim Thomas made five of seven 3­point attempts and finished with 17 points. Robinson had 19 points along with Harrington. 
The Trail Blazers, who had won five straight against the Knicks. were home after losing their last two on a three-game road trip. Their latest was a 102-93 loss at Oklahoma City on Friday. 
The Knicks had lost three straight at Madison Square Garden going into Sunday's matinee game at the Rose Garden. But the losses came against the Lakers, the Cavaliers and the Celtics and going into the slump, and had won five of their last six. 
The Trail Blazers let a 17­point, third-quarter lead dwindle away, and the Knicks went up 97-84 early in the fourth quarter after Robinson's 3-pointer. 
The Blazers climbed back to 105-101 on Roy's layup with 
2:15 left. After Harrington hit a 3-pointer for the Knicks, Oden and Outlaw each scored to nar­row it to 108-105 with 1:10 left -setting up the winning -sequence for Portland. 
Oden was confident the Blazers would come away with the win. 
"I didn't have any doubts. I was just trying to stay with my guy and give him a clear path," Oden said. 
The Blazers ·remain without starting point guard Steve Blake, who's still nursing a shoulder injury. Coach Nate McMillan said he would be evaluated for Wedrtesday's game against the Thunder.

Junior Joanna Shultz, with a second place in the 400-meters, along with Kelly Langhans in the 800-meters, Lindsey Ferguson in the 3000-meters, and Jack Howard in the 800.-meters also set the mark.

4.15 meters. 
In the Meyo Mile, five runners ran sub-four­minute miles. Paul Springer, with a 21st place finish, was the high­est Irish finisher in the· Ryan ~hay 3000-meter run. 
Friday's meet featured a number of unseeded races and events, some of which the Irish won. In the 
men's 500 meters, Billy Buzaid continued his suc­cessful senior season with a first-place time of 
1:02.82. Fellow senior Anna Weber also per­formed well, being the top collegiate finisher in the women's weight throw. Patrick Smyth finished off his day with a win in the 5000-meters, followed by

Notre Dame rolls to win over Olivet 
By MIKE GOTIMER Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame men's swimming and diving team wrapped up its dual meet season on Saturday with a 16-event sweep of Olivet in the team's 173-102 win over the Comets. The Irish com­pleted the regular season with four consecutive dual meet wins, three of which came during the Shamrock Invitational on Jan. 24. 
Irish coach Tim Welsh was pleased with his squad's per­formance in the meet and thinks Notre Dame is in a good position to succeed at the Big East Championships. 
"We appear to be on sched­ule at this point to achieve our best times at the confer­ence championship meet, and that's our goal," he said. "The things we saw today encouraged us"to believe that we're on the right track. We leave today's meet more excited about our conference championship potential than we were coming into it." 
Facing a Division III oppo­nent, the Irish saw the meet as an opportunity to experi­ment with lineup alternatives heading into their champi­onship season. 
"We learned a great deal," Welsh said. "We set up our entries so that we'd be able to see some alternatives and lineups we hadn't seen before. It was a very helpful meet for us." 
The meet provided an opportunity for Notre Dame's freshmen to stand out. Rookie Jonathan Whitcomb took top honors in the 1000­meter freestyle, while class­mates Marshall Sherman and Conor Evans finished first in the 100 backstroke and 200 butterfly, respectively. 
Fellow freshman B.J. Roth helped ensure a sweep in the distance freestyle events with a win in the 500 freestyle. Brian Maloy also contributed to the strong freshman show­ing with a first place finish in the 100 breaststroke. 
The meet also allowed many of Notre Dame's sen­iors to finish on top in their final meet at the Rolfs Aquatic Center. Senior Danny Lutkus won the 50 free while fellow seniors Jeff Wood and Bill Bauman took top honors in the 100 free and 200 back­stroke, respectively. Senior Mitchell Sherman finished in second place in the 100 but­terfly behind Irish junior Andrew Hoffman. 
The Irish return to action at the Big East Conference Championships in Indianapolis from Feb. 18­
21. The Irish hope to earn their second straight confer­ence title and fourth in five years. ,

Park leads ND into spring 
By ERIC PRISTER Sporrs Wrirer 

The Notre Dame Women's golf team will end its three and a half month hiatus Monday when it travels to Palos Verdes, Calif. for the Northrop Grumman Regional Championship. In the three-day tourna­ment, which will begin the spring portion of their season, the No. 25 Irish will take on a field of 15 other universities, includ­ing No.1 UCLA, No.2 USC and No. 3 Arizona St. 
The Irish are coming off of a somewhat successful fall season with one tour­nament title and two other top 5 finishes. In their victory in the Heather Farr Memorial 
last September, Notre I!!!!!!!!!!!! Dame shot a 281, a record-low for the University. 
The Irish will be led by sophomore So-Ilyun Park. An All-American, Park leads the team with a 
74.87 scoring average, including a 66 in the record-setting Ileather Farr Memorial, which is also a University record. 
Joining Park for the 

Irish will be freshman Becca Huffer, who has the second-best scoring aver­age on the season. Huffer was recently named Colorado female high school athlete of the year for 2008, and has had an excellent first year for the Irish, having 13 out of her 15 scores counted. 
Junior Annie Brophy leads the team with 14 out of 15 scores counted, and has played consistent­ly for the Irish, averaging a 75.40 through 15 rounds. Brophy, Park and senior Lisa Maunu have each finished fourth indi­vidually in a tournament this season, the highest on the team. Park and Maunu finished tied for fourth at the Heather Farr, and Brophy finished fourth in the Lady 
Northern Tournament last October 
The Irish lineup is rounded out by sophomore Katie Conway, who has averaged a 76.92 so far this season. She missed the first tournament for the Irish, 'but has compet­ed in each of the others. Her 75 in the second round of the Heather Farr Memorial helped the Irish secure their record-set­ting performance. 
The five Irish starters will play a total of 54 holes over a three day span, playing 18 holes Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, with the top four scores each day counted towards their final total.

After Frilling dropped a tough contest 4-6, 4-6, sophomore Kristen Rafael claimed the cov­eted fourth point for Irish when she defeated her opponent 6-7, 6-2, 6-1 in the No. 4 singles match. Krisik and Ciobanu each dropped their singles matches in three-set thrillers. 
This victory gives the Irish a perfect 4-0 record so far this season and includes two victo­ries over top-twenty competi­tion. 
The Irish will travel to Madison, Wise. to compete in the 16-team ITA National Indoor championship tourna­ment on Feb. 13. Notre Dame defeated Pepperdine and No. 17 Arkansas to advance to the national championships next weekend. 
Last year, the Irish fell to No. 6 Georgia in the opening round of the tournament before split­ting their two games in the con­solation bracket.

Not to be outdone by the men's team, the Irish women also went undefeated at the· Duals with a weekend record of 12-0. The women's squad improves to 32-2 on the sea­son, tying the program-best mark in win totals originally set in 1995. 

The women's outstanding performance was highlighted by wins over Michigan State (21-6), Air Force (23-4), UC San Diego (21-6), Detroit (25­2). Cleveland State (26-1), Florida (24-3), Cal Tech (24-3), and Stanford (21-6). 
Experience led the way for the women's squad, as senior sabreist Ashley Serrette earned her program-best 234th win, 43 more wins than the second-best total for sabre. Senior foilist Adrienne Nott tallied 24 wins at the event, moving into fourth place for all-time career foil wins. 
Although the Irish eagerly await the beginning of the postseason in two weeks, sev­eral of the talented under­classmen will head to New Mexico to compete in the Junior Olympics, which begin on February 13th.

Louisville collles back to beat SJU 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK -Louisville had 
a tough day at Madison Square 
Garden on Sunday. The fifth­
ranked Cardinals still managed 
a 60-47 victory over St. John's 
because of their defense. 
Their leading scorer for the 
season finished with three 
points. Their freshman center, 
who was half the offense in the 
first half, had two teeth knocked 
out and went to a hospital 
instead of returning to the 
game. Their shots weren't 
falling. It all pointed to a second 
straight loss. 
"Everything that could go wrong for us from a physical standpoint did," Louisville coach Rick Pitino said, then started his list with his leading scorer. "Terrence Williams, I admire him so much as a basketball player. He shouldn't have played today. His right wrist was taped ·up. It's a terrible, terrible bruise, but nothing keeps him out. He couldn't shoot but be had seven rebounds and seven 
assists. 
"(Samardo) Samuels was 
playing terrific and was off to a big game but had his teeth knocked out. Our guys found a way to win against a team that played very hard. I am very pleased we overcame a lot of adversity." 

Jerry Smith, who didn't start for the second time this season, was a big part of that. 
The junior guard had a sea­son-high 21 points, 19 in the ·second half when he matched 
· the team's entire total for the first half, its lowest mark of the season. "It was our defensive intensity that turned things around," Smith said. "I wasn't looking for shots but when the opportunity came I took it." The Cardinals (18-4, 9-1 Big East), who were coming off their first conference loss of the sea­son to No. 1 Connecticut, shot 
38.5 percent from the field (20­for-52), including 3-for-17 from 3-point range. 
The numbers are a lot better when you consider what they did in the first half. 
The Cardinals were 8-for-23 at the break (34.8 percent) and missed all eight of their 3-point attempts. They were outre­bounded 28-20 and Samuels was heading for a dentist appointment, while Louisville trailed 22-19. 
"We were a little flat and we did have those things going against us," Pitino said. "I was concerned because we weren't making shots and sometimes when you don't make shots you lose your confidence. But we went backdoor. That's what's we kept preaching. there's easy 
·l 
baskets to be had." I 
Smith had three baskets on I backdoor cuts, including a back­door dunk on a pass from Earl I Clark that made it 4 7-38 with 
2:58 to go. Clark had 10 of his 12 points in the second half. 
Sean Evans had 12 points and nine rebounds for the Red Storm (12~11. 3-8), who have lost three of four. St. John's shot 
31.1 percent for the game (19­for-61), including 2-for-12 on 3s. 
"They've got a very good team and they made some big plays in the second half," St. John's coach Norm Robert said. "We missed some shots but I thought we played extremely hard. We really competed hard."

Playing its best defensive game of the year, Saint Mary's dominated Alma 66­39 on Saturday afternoon from start to finish. 
"I think Alma missed some shots early. on," Belles coach Jennifer Henley said. "We built some momentum from that." 
The Belles (13-8) started out strong, building an early 15-8 lead. The Scots (7-13) 
were able to cut it to a 15-12 game before the Belles pulled away to a 30-20 half­time lead. 
In the sec­ond half, the Belles start­ed on a 26-1 run that ulti­mately sealed the deal. Saint Mary's fin-
ward Erin Newsom and 12 points and 9 rebounds from Anna Kammrath, but they also received quality play off the bench. Kelley Murphy added 7 points and 8 rebounds and Jessica Centa added 10 points com­ing off the bench for the Belles. 
"Our bench is continuing to improve." Henley said. "With the loss of Nicole Beier due to a foot injury, these two players have real­ly stepped up for us." 
The Belles are now 11-2 in 
"Our bench is continuing to improve. With the loss ofNicole Beier due to a foot injury, [Centa and Murphy] really stepped up for us" 
Jennifer Henley Belles coach 

ished the game shooting better than 40 percent from the field. The Belles also forced the Scots into 25 turnovers and held them to 25 percent shooting. 
"We continue to stress the importance of team defense and defending the paint." Henley said. 
The Belles received their norm a! 10 points and 8 rebounds from senior for-
conference play and hold second place in the MIAA with just four reg­ular season games to go. Their next contest will be at home against Adrian. Saint Mary's defeated the Bulldogs 74­69 at Adrian 
the last time the two teams faced off. 
"We did not play particu­larly well down the stretch at their place." Henley said. "They are a very good team who will be ready for us." 
Tip-off is slated for 7:30 
p.m. Wednesday at the Angela Athletic Facility.

Bruins 
continued from page 24 
Saturday. 
And !tll the words Notre Dame has thrown around for the past month to explain how it'll emerge from its tailspin ­talk _of soul searching and refo­cusing -never seemed as empty as they did Saturday. 
"UClA's a good team and we knew that," Irish forward Luke Harangody said. "We didn't fight today at all and it showed." 
The 26-point loss was the largest margin of defeat for a Brey-coached team at Notre Dame. Harangody had his worst game of the season and for the first time in 53 games, scored less than 10 points. Harangody grabbed one rebound and finished with just five points on 2-for-12 shooting, a product of UCLA's double teams that frustrated him the entire game. 
"Time for us to go back to step one," Harangody said. "There's not much you could say. This was embarrassing today, definitely a low point in my career at Notre Dame." 
It didn't take long for Notre Dame's disastrous day to start. 
Less than four minutes ticked off the clock before the Bruins opened up an 11-2 lead. 
Nine points is hardly a large deficit, but Notre Dame couldn't have been farther behind. 
Bruins forward Nikola Dragovic had firmly planted Luke Harangody on his behind, the end result of a stiff rejection near the rim, and·guard Josh Shipp had thrown down an ESPN-worthy one-handed alley­oop from guard Darren Collison. 
"Our transition 'D' tonight was terrible," Harangody said. "It was like a layup drill for them. That can't happen. It's embarrassing." 
The run was indicative of how UCLA carried itself in warm-ups, jumping up and down and chest bumping all around, showing no signs of sleepiness because of a 10 a.m. start time. 
Then there was Notre Dame, who sat quietly during intro­ductions -and played even quieter. The Irish committed turnovers, had lapses on defense and created little offen­sively. Notre Dame looked like a team that didn't learn much from its six previous defeats. 
Those opening minutes car­ried over the rest of the half. Following a Notre Dame time­out, Collison buried a three and center Alfred Aboya sent in another monster jam. Notre Dame was down 20-13 and fad­ing fast. The rest of the first half, there were more turnovers by Notre Dame, more defensive lapses, and more easy baskets for UCLA. The Irish were down 46-30 at intermission. 
"They got off to such a great start shooting the basketball and scoring it," Irish coach Mike Brey said. "We had some great looks early, which has been a little bit of our history this year and you've got to knock down a few more of those. Transition 'D' hurt us at key times." 
The Irish were down 16. Again, not an insurmountable deficit. But UCLA came out of the locker room with the same intensity it had in the first half -and so did the Irish. Another Collison 3-pointer made the score 65-40 with 12:21 left to play. Notre Dame failed to score over the next four minutes and found itself down 73-40 with 
8:13 remaining. Brey took our Harangody with just over 10 minutes left and kept him on the bench the rest of the game. 
"My feeling was, you weren't jump-starting it today," Brey said. "No use forcing that." 
Harangody, meanwhile, was­n't too thrilled. 
"I don't know what he was trying to say to me, but I was ready to go in there the whole time," Harangody said. "''m kind of upset he didn't go back to me. I didn't think I had to go back in the game because he always knows I'm ready to fight for him." 
Aboya led all scorers with 19 points. Collison added 17. Junior guard Tory Jackson, who began the game on the bench, an attempt by Brey to get results by shaking up his rotation, led the Irish with 1 7 points. Guard Kyle McAlarney added 16. 
"We're obviously struggling right now. We're not going to deny that," McAlarney said. "We're trying to find our way back from where we were in the beginning of the season. It's. a process, but hopefully with a win, one win, just look for one win right now." 
One win never seemed so hard to get.

Notre Dame has maintained that it is capable of going on an extended winning streak and get itself back in NCAA Tournament contention. So what has to change for that to happen? 
"That's hard for me to say right now," Brey said. "I don't know if I have an answer to that right now." 
Irish forward Luke Harangody had a similar thought. 
"I don't know right now. I'm kind of at a loss for words," said Harangody, who finished with a season-low five points. "We're not fighting at all, .we're not the team we were last year." 
Brey would elaborate on his answer. 
"Somehow you've got to come into the locker room and win a game and feel good about your­self," Brey said. "But there's a lot of things, things you've got to do better before that, transition 'D,' battling in the pain _more consistently. And we have done that, didn't do it as much in the second half. 
"Staying in character offen­sively, and screening consistent­ly. I don't know if we've done that against this level of team for 40 minutes where we've really helped each other consis­tently on offense. We do it for maybe three possessions, and then maybe two we don't work as hard. Work on offense is something that against really good teams we haven't done consistently." 
Or, as guard Kyle McAlarney said, the Irish need to work on "everything." 
The Irish are desperate for a win right now. To try and save the season, Brey is re-opening every position in practice this week. No one is guaranteed a starting spot, he said. 
"I said, 'I'll see you in practice tomorrow, we'll compete for playing time, starting jobs and if that rotates the rest of the year, that's the way it rotates,"' Brey said.

.That gives the Irish a few days to lick their wounds, regroup and to work on Brey's laundry list of improvements. But one thing the Irish won't be doing before Thursday is feeling sorry for themselves. 
Harangody added: "We're 21, 22-year-old men, we're not going to feel sorry for our­selves." 
"We've been on a heck of a stretch with who we've played, that's not lost on me, but you don't have time to feel sorry for yourself because here comes another one on Thursday ... " Brey said. "It's going to be hard. Hardest thing we've ever been in, in our program's history, biggest challenge in the history of our program."

Notes: 
+The Pink Zone fundraiser raised more than $38,000 for breast cancer research. 
"It seemed like a special day when we went out," said McGraw, wbose mother, Anne O'Brien, is a breast cancer survivor. "When I saw that pink in the arena, I took a deep breath and it really made me appreciate what those women had gone through. We're worried about making a shot or turning the ball over and they're surviv­ing cancer." 
The referees used pink whistles, fans had pink shirts and the players had pink shoelaces and uniforms. The Irish players even had streaks of pink in their hair; Bruszewski's was more bla­tant than the rest. 
"It was the hair. Got a new attitude going," Bruszewski said of her performance. "''m a little different, a little more punk, so I just wanted to add it in."

cles, the rebound bounced towards Irish captain Erik Condra· and with just over a second remaining the senior buried a game-tying goal. 
Less than a minute later, sophomore Calle Ridderwall buried another Irish powerplay go~l giving Notre Dame a 4-3 overtime win. 
Cole started things off early for Notre Dame with a blast from the point only five min­utes into the game. The Buckeyes fought back over the next two periods, taking the lead twice before the Irish finally pulled away in dramatic fashion. 
Ohio State got goals from Corey Elkins and Sergio Somma to take the lead in the second period. Midway through the third, Condra started the come­back with his first of two pow­erplay goals. 
After falling behind once again with three minutes remaining the Irish got the break they needed. 
Buckeye freshman Ian Boots got tagged with a five-minute major for spearing. The penalty gave Notre Dame a man advan­tage for the rest of the game. Condra and Ridderwall were both able to advantage and stretch Notre Dame's road win streak to 12 games. 

The win did not come without a hefty price for the Irish though. 
Junior right wing Hyan Thang left the game in the third peri­od with what appeared to be a serious lower leg injury. Thang's left leg got caught when chasing down a puek along the boards and buckled awkwardly underneath him. The junior, who has nine goals so far this season, had to be helped off the ice and did not dress for Sunday afternoon's game. 
No members of the tp,am were available to comment on the extent or the injury dufJ to travel.

Buckeyes in the Sunday mati­nee 4-1. 
Junior Christiaan Minella started things off with his sixth goal or the season midway through the second period. 
The goal, Notre Dame's fourth powerplay score on the weekend, came ofT of a rebound from a Kevin Deeth shot. The Irish converted only one of their six man advantages after going 3-for-5 Friday night. 

The Buckeyos answered with a llurry of goals late in the see-· ond stanza. Loss than a minute after Minella's goal senior John Albert tied the game up with his tflnth tally of the season. Albert also pieked up assists on goals from Shane Sims and Taylor Stol"ishen later in the period. 
The pace settled down in the third as Ohio State goalie Dustin Carlson held off all of Notre Dame's chances before the Buckeyes added an empty netter at the end. Carlson fin­ished with 32 saves. 
The loss was the first for Notre Dame on the road since opening the season with a 5-2 defeat at the hands of Denver. However, due to Friday night's win and other games in the conference this weekend, the Irish did lock up a first round bye and home ice in the second round of the CCI-lA tournament this weekflnd.

LOS ANGELES -Over the span of Notre Dame's seven­game losing streak, Irish coach Mike Brey has dubbed himself "Mr. Positive," a man always in search of something good to build upon for the next game. 
But the only positive the Irish (12-10) can take away from Saturday's 89-63 loss to UCLA (19-4) is that they can't possibly play any worse. 
The freefalling Irish hit rock bottom at Pauley Pavilion, as the Bruins ran circles around an Irish team that, for all their struggles the past month, never looked as complacent, as sloppy or as helpless all season as it did

Team left searching for remedy to losses 
By CHRIS HINE Sports Wrirer 
LOS ANGELES -For as slow as the unmerciful clock seemed to tick away for Notre Dame during its 89-63 loss to UCLA Saturday, the opposite is true when applied to Notre Dame's season. 
The loss to the Bruins was Notre Dame's seventh in a row and with it came another missed opportunity for a quality win. The Irish are 12-10, 3-7 in the Big East, and the wins they thought they could hang their hat on, over Georgetown and over Texas, look worse by the day, as the Hoyas and Longhorns are going through rough periods of their own.

Last-second goal ties Friday's game, Irish win in extra session 
By DAN MURPHY Sports Editor 
With the final seconds ticking away Friday night, No. 15 Ohio State looked poised to skate away with a much-needed win over No. 2 Notre Dame. The Buckeyes led 3-2 after looking to be in control throughout most of the game. 
All of that changed in the blink of an eye. 
Sophomore defenseman Ian Cole, operating with a 6-on-4 advantage, patiently handled the puck at the blue line as the clock crept below ten. He avoided a Buckeye defender and slipped a pass to freshman Billy Maday. Maday ripped a shot from the tops of the cir-

Men's team coinpletes perfect season in Duals 
By CHRIS MASOUD SportS Writer 
Perfection in the sports world is hardly commonplace, but for the Irish feneing program per­fection is just second nature. The top-ranked Notre Dame men's fencing team put togeth­~~r a 14-0 record at the Notre Dame Duals this weekend to finish the rPgular season at a pnrfnet 34-0. 
The undefnated 2009 season is thP 20th in program history and the l'irst since 200:~. Tht~ men's win total of 34 is the highest in Notre Dame history. 
The men's squad earned vic­tories over Lawrence (25-2), Cal Tech (22-5), UC San Diego (18-9), Wayne State (19-8) and Oberlin (25-2). Facing seventh­ranked Stanford in a highly­anticipated matchup, the Irish emerged victorious with a 15­12 win over the Cardinal to protect their undefeated record. 
Once again the underclass­men led the way for the Irish, as freshmen Reggie Bentley and Gerek Meinhardt. and sophomore Avery Zuck each contributed two wins. Although relatively inexperienced, Irish coach Janusz Bednarski believes his youngsters are adapting rapidly to collegiate fencing. 
"ThPy are adjusting very quickly to the different type of compntition, the diffprent type of bouts because definitely it's a different systf~m." Bednarski said. "Sometimes there are sur­prises from the intensity of the bouts, intensity between schools, and intensity of engagement. But I believe we will also be successful on this
