The 5 cornerstones of student life 
For decades, the taverns on Five Corners have been an important aspect of Notre Dame and Saint Mary's social life. They have been places where old friends could hang out together and new friends could become acquainted. 
While the murder of Corby Tavern owner Harold Rowley Jr. over the summer nearly put an end to one of the traditional centers of comradery and often inebria­tion, an eleventh-hour decision by Rowley's widow, Rose, opened the bar before the first home football weekend. Back taxes were quickly paid, the interior was swept and straightened out, and the doors ofall the taverns opened in time for the thirsty Notre Dame fans Friday night. 
Old alumni reminisced and first-time patrons were initiated into the familiar atmosphere of the Five Cor­ners bars, an off-campus tradition. The pennants on the walls of Corby's announced who the Fighting Irish

Who's that? Who just walked in? Hey! Whassup? Have a beer. Bartender, get my friend here a beer. No, wait, get him one of those. 
You know, I never see that girl on campus. The only time I see her is in here. Jeez, she must ltve here.· Last round! Go get two more. One for the walk. Good­night, drive safely! Back to the dormitory, the chilled night air makes a brisk walk ideal right now. The darkness makes it hard 
to see the roll of the ground as you walk across Green Field. Stumbling a little, you try to maintain control as you walk by the security gate. Can they really bust you on sight if you appear drunk?

Everybody knows somebody who has been there when it has been raided. One or two have the honor of having been arrested there by South Bend's finest. 
Does alcohol play such a central role in your life that your social life has to revolve around it? No, not neces­sarily. Then why is Five Corners such a popular student meeting place? Good question. Maybe because it's fun? Because friends like to get together there with mini­mum hassle to enjoy the company of others in a warm and inviting atmosphere -without having to worry about being a little too loud and obnoxious, or how many people are in the room or whether a rule is being broken or not. It's a place where adults can meet and talk and act and be treated like adults. 
Perhaps the proposed renovations to the new Stu­dent Center should include some well-worn leather, stools and the pungent smell of stale beer. And most definitely some students. 
Doesn't matter, though. There's always the Corners.

Though it is nearly a mile from campus, Five Corners 

is where Notre Dame and Saint Mary's meet. It is the crossroads between the in­stability ofyouth and the confident, self-assuredness of young adulthood -an adulthood which will meet friends in bars and buy drinks for friendly strangers. Five Corners is a sanctuary for the student who has put too much time into studying for that midterm or who has had enough of the rules which plague incessantly the 
need of the individual to have fun and offer him the ability to bail out for a few hours. 
Corby's, Nickie's, The Commons, Bridget McGuire's and even Lee's are the last refuge for the hopelessly doomed -who have had enough of the dormitory life and who are going to explode if that rector asks to turn down the radio just one more time or who has two papers due next week and one quiz tomorrow and there are only 24 hours in a day and-­

Owners of locations of off-campus events must agree to responsibility 
By SCOTT BEARBY 
News Staff 
Under the new alcohol policy, owners of the location of an off­campus hall-sponsored activity must take responsibility or the event can­not take place, according to john Goldrick, associate vice president for residence life. 
Goldrick, at yesterday's Hall Presi­dent's Council meeting, along with Father Francis Cafarelli, associate vice president for student services and Sister Jean Lenz, associate vice president for student affairs, fielded questions on the newly Imple­mented alcohol policy and the ul­timate responsibility for such events. 
With this agreement the halls and Notre Dame would not be liable. Al­though there was some skepticism about owners taking such responsi­bility, Dr. Goldrick said he "saw no reason why they wouldn't agree." 
It was stressed, however, that hall presidents should be completely aware of what they are undertaking. If a mishap should take place, the president must have made an effort to avoid it or responsibility could be placed back on the hall. Cafarelli said "the processes oflaw seeks responsi­bility," so there must be proof of an effort to uphold the law should an infraction take place. 
All three encouraged hall presi­dents to be aware ofpossible infrac­tions at off-campus events and to be mindful ofhall events as well. 
Goldrick was questioned about students bringing alcohol in by car. Security has been stopping some In­dividuals carrying alcohol, accor­ding to one hall president. 
Goldrick said a letter has been sent to security in order to change this procedure. He asked that guards use good judgment in deciding whe-

The new alcohol policy does not pose any additional problems on the weekend, according to Madden. The trip will be restricted to high school age students to alleviate entertain­ment problems. 
The student's time will be filled with scheduled events leaving little free time. The students will have to be trusted because there is no way ther or not the amount being brought in is excessive. 
Tom Lezynski, co-chairman for the Notre Dame United Way Fund Drive, told the council the student goal for this year's drive is Sl2,500. United Way funds 35 organizations, including the Big Brothers/Big Sisters program. Lezynski said this year halls may be able to donate all oftheir funds to a particular agency. The drive will run the week of Oct. 8. 
to watch every visitor, according to Madden. 
To insure a strong relationship be­tween the committee and the ad­ministration, Madden will be talking to John Goldrick, associate vice president for residence life, to remove any problems before the vote is taken. 
In addition to the work of Mad­den, help from the alumni clubs and the sophomore class will play key roles In building this year's program. Many of the members of the sopho­more class came to the campus as "little sibs" and Jim Domagalski, class president, will be working closely with the committee in its at­tempts to strengthen past weaknes­ses.

Coed 
continuedfrom page I 
with Saint Mary's would never be al­tered by women at Notre Dame. He hoped any foolish rivalries between the women of the two schools would nev.er begin, but that friendships would flourish between the campuses. 
In a · recent · discussion with Burtchaell, now a professor oftheol­ogy, Hesburgh said hostility existed from the beginning between the two 
groups of women. In contrast, he thought the relationship between Notre Dame men and women was never strained. 
Burtchaell believed coeducation 
was "the best thing that has hap­
pened to Notre Dame in years." 
Burtchaell said the first women at 
Notre Dame were concerned with 
academics and would have been in­
sulted if anyone suggested they 
were at Notre Dame for any other 
reason, including the social life. 
The Advisory Committee on Coeducation allowed no favoritism, such as special accomodations, ac­cording to Burtchaell. They did however, allow special arrange­ments such as the installation of laundry machines in women's halls. 
Freshman Marlen Zloza from Saint Mary's toured Badin Hall in 1972 and when asked what she thought of it as a women's hall, she said, "Ugh! I'd never want to live there, it's a pit!" 
After the announcement that Walsh and Badin were to be the first two women's dorms, men from both halls protested strongly and criticized the administration for ig­noring a study which termed the halls unsuitable for women, accor­ding to a 1972 Obseroer article. 
SisterJohn Miriam Jones, assistant to the provost, liked the facilities. She said "the girls who come here will pick up the Notre Dame flavor fast. They (the dorms) ~e not overc feminized and add a women's per­sonal touch." 
Since the early years of coeducation the number of under­graduate women at Notre Dame has increased so that eight of Notre Dame's 23 dorms are women's halls. 
Before Notre Dame went coed, drinking was not allowed in public rooms because of Indiana state law. Approximately 10 years ago, however, drinking became permissi­ble in private rooms. It gradually developed into the main focus of campus social life, according to Jones. 
Because the drinking age was then 18 in Michigan, students were taking great risks driving back to campus at night. Jones said the administration preferred that the students "learn to drink" on campus where they were safe and people cared about them. 
While the philosophy worked for three to four years, Jones said, stu­dents began abusing this generosity. 
In the late 1970's, Sister Jean Lenz, then rector ofFarley Hall, said some rectors asked for the establishment

"The president tried to present in a somewhat modified form the self· same policy aimed at further ag· gravating international tension, achieving military superiority and interfering in the internal affairs of other states," the news agency Tass said. 
The Tass report and a speech by Soviet President Konstantin U. Cher· nenko made clear the Soviets are not retreating on major East-West disputes, despite milder U.S. rheto· ric and Reagan's scheduled meeting Friday with Soviet Foreign Minister

isn't clear enough concerning off· campus events, and that some memorandum should have been published long ago detailing such in· formation. 
"It was really unfair," Pellegrino said. "We lost a lot of money on the tickets, D.J., buses, and the down payment on the boat. I guess they saw what they didn't like, namely a booze cruise, and ended it." 
Although Pellegrino believes his dorm was a victim of an after-the· fact decision, Cafarelli sees the guidelines as beneficial to the stu· dents. 
"We are actually trying to protect the students. For instance, in the Oil· Ion Hall SYR case, Bernie and Kevin (O'Brien, co-president of Dillon), could have been named co-Andrei Gromyko. 
In a speech to the jubilee meeting of the SO-year-old Writers Union, Chernenko renewed charges that the Reagan administration is respon· sible for what the Kremlin calls an increased nuclear war threat. 
Chernenko, in his first major speech since last spring, also charged that Washington is con· ducting psychological warfare against the Soviet Union. And he ex· horted Soviet writers to join the "ideological struggle" and issued new warnings that those who "blacken" the image of the state won't be tolerated. 
Chernenko's speech was shown on the main Soviet evening news program. The tape ran 22 minutes and the 73-year-old leader displayed the breathing difficulties he usually has while speaking in public. 
defendants if anything had hap­pened. In fact, anyone who attended the booze cruise could have been held liable if another person had been injured." 
Goldrick and Cafarelli both ex· pressed concern that the incidents could extend beyond the civil level of the law and include the criminal realm. "After the lawsuits are settled, there's a family out a kid. That's a sit· uation that can't be solved," said Goldrick. 
Both administrators believe that the alcohol policy is a reflection of the times, and is concurrent with many state laws concerning alcohol consumption in the U.S. The same discrepancies that arise within the state laws surrounding alcohol have 
arisen  on  campus,  according  to  
Cafarelli.  
"It is  so  typical of the law that  

someone wants a further explana· tion; that's the law," Cafarelli con· eluded.

Does God hover over the White House? 
Ronald Reagan is not only a movie star in the White House. He is conducting his own movie in the White House. Uke most movies, it very much resembles its Hollywood predecessors. In fact, sometimes it seems a mere rewrite. 
Take the president's treatment of his own assassination. He took the shooting itself in stride, passing it off with quips like Dick Powell under the bandages in "Murder My Sweet." Yet, at the Republican Convention in Dallas, Reagan said he had taken the attempt so seriously that the rest of his life now "belongs to someone else." 
That is, so help me, the plot of an old '30s movie called "Gabriel Over the White House." In this MGM film, the U.S. president is left at death's door after an auto accident. In a 
Garry Wills 

outrider 
coma, he is given by the archangel Gabriel a vision ofthe way he should live ifhe recovers, and he goes on to do that. The rest ofthe time left him in office is spent doing good. Franklin Roosevelt, new in the White House himself, like the movie and watched it several times. But Ronald Reagan has lived it. You can't top that. 
Obviously the vision Reagan has for "What Time Is Left Me" does not include spending a lot of hours in church. George Washington, whom Reagan quoted in his prayer breakfast address at the Dallas convention, would have sympathized with that. Washington was not much of a churchgoer himself. But even he attended Episcopal services when he was in office, to set a good example. Reagan cannot bring himself to do that. 
Reagan's use of Washington to link religion and politics did not cite the one real tes­timony Washington offers in favor ofthat link­his churchgoing as president. That would have been too embarrassing. 
But aside from that temporary attention to divine services, Washington would not have been a favorite of the evangelicals who now quote him. Parson Weems made up the story ofWashington being seen in prayer during the war. Washington never used the wordJesus in his writings -as opposed to Jefferson, who of­ten called jesus history's greatest moral teacher, and who ended up his days reading from the New Testament every night before he went to bed. 
Jefferson was not a favorite ofthe preachers during his life. He was a deist, which he defined as a "monotheist." That is, he did not believe in the Trinity-so, obviously, he could not believe in Christ's divinity. Still, he gave more serious thought and respect to religion than Washington ever did. 
Washington did not even like to use the word "God." He customarily used "Providence" instead. Some of the religious touches in his messages to the troops were supplied by his secretaries, who were New England Congregationalists. His real views came out when there was a move to extend the informal chaplain system of the Revolu­tionary Army. Up to that point, individual units had been allowed to adopt a chaplain or not as they chose. One clergyman wanted to put the appointment of chaplains on a federal basis (as it is now). Washington quashed the move. 
After he retired from the White House, Washington gave up his ceremonial office as vestryman of the local Virginia church, and did not attend any more. Even earlier, when he failed to take communion during one ser­vice, and the preacher drew attention to that fact, he never returned to the man's church. 
The passage from the farewell address cited 
by Reagan in Dallas was written by Alexander 
Hamilton and actually toned down by Wash­
ington. If the current zealots are looking for 
religious enthusiasm in the founders, they 
should go to Benjamin Franklin. For a while in 
his speculative youth, he not only believed in 
God but in a plurality of gods. He would have 
had many archangels hovering over the White 
House. Would that please the Reverend Fal­
well?

People must believe abortion is wrong 
Dear Editor: 
I am writing in response to Terry Donovan's guest column on Cuomo's speech. I think that she ha.~ missed one of the main points of Mr. Cuomo's speech. She ha.~ failed to touch on the reality ofabortion. I think we can all agree that no one who ha.~ an abortion likes or wants to kill their child. That Is not the reason for most abortions. The reason Is that the mother and father simply don't have the means to care for the child and believe (rightly or wrongly) that the abortion is in everyone's best interest. Cuomo says the best way to stop abortion is to provide alternatives. In other words, provide money for the care ofthe child and the contin­ued education and job training of the mother and father if necessary so the mother and fa­ther believe that the child ha.~ a chance at a decent life In the world. When these opportu­nities ar available to everyone, then serious debate on the legislation concerning abortion can truly begin. 
If we han abortion before alternatives are available, the abortions will not stop, they will simply become more dangerous because of lack of funding and qualified doctors to per­form the operation. Because It is not the abor­tions of people who can afford it that we can realistically prevent, but those of the less for­tunate. Until the rest ofthe community is will­Ing to lend a hdping hand to those in need, legislation against abortion could just be counterproductive. 
I would like to point out for the benefit of the readers that slavery didn't end because Uncoln or anyone else with power believed in the personhood of blacks (which Is a major embarrassment) but because they thought slavery was wrong. Uncoln himself believed blacks were inferior people and that they didn't even deserve to vote.

Forgotten freshmen of Pasquerilla West 
Dear Editor: 
lbis letter Is written from roon 200 Pasquerllla West. You may never have heard of room 200 because It technically does not exist, but Is a mere figment of the administra­tion's Imagination. Perhaps the room does ex­ist (as a "study lounge") yet its occupants doubt their own physical presence at Notre Dame. Accepting the fact that we would be places In a temporary housing situation was the easy part of our predicament. However, we are now left to deal with the repercus­sions. 
While freshmen accepted at an earlier date received all the necessary Information (order form for football tickets, and more impor­tantly, the application and submission of pho­tograph for the dogbook), we "secondary citizens" only received the bill for tuition, room, and board (which was the same, despite the situation). Although we realize the dogbook Is an artificial means of meeting people, at least it is a way (now that parties are all but obsolete). 
In conclusion, we would like to wish you all a good time at all your SYR's, semi-formals, and formals-if you're ever in the area, feel free to stop in, we'll always be here!

Religion is not an alien to politics 
Dear Editor: 

Having left graduate work at Notre Dame for one semester in order to teach history at a seminary in the placid hills of southern In­diana, I feel a familiar mingling of puzzlement and dismay as I read student articles and let­ters in the Observer on the stormy subject of religion and politics. Chris Julka compares Governor Cuomo with those passive Germans who refused to speak out against Hitler. Mi­chael Quinlan charges the New York gover­nor with standing "for the proposition that political success for a Catholic requires the surrender ofone's values: at least those values which are not fashionable." 
No serious Christian will contend that Americans of any religious persuasion ought to refrain from taking stands on public ques­tions. Moreover, few will contend that dis­tinctively Christian positions never emerge regarding political ;questions which demand an essentially moral response. One thinks of slavery and fascism. Julka and Quinlan are cor­rect in contending that the world ofa religion is not wholly alien to the world of politics. There is a sense in which reality must always be experienced as a seamless web; hence, one's morality will in one sense always suffuse one's thinking on everything else. 
Still, there are no ineluctably "Christian" answers to most of the great public problems of our time (or of any era). The J udeo­Chrlstian heritage, to paraphrase Toc­queville's description ofan abstraction, is like a box with a false bottom. One can put into the heritage whatever one pleases and then take it out again without being observed. One can as easily quote St. Thomas Aquinas, for instance, to consecrate freedom of choice regarding abortion as to justify a legal ban on the same. 
People who struggle to make sense of the world of politics by describing it as a virtual sub-branch of moral theology usually turn out to be censorious, self-righteous and one­dimensional in their political as well as their religious thinking. They forget that politics is essentially an obscure and intricate scramble between competing interests, rather than a forum for the translation of God's will into public law. Anyone can claim to possess a divine imprimatur for his or her political views. Chris · Julka and Michael Quinlan remind one of Uncoln's observation that, "Men are not flattered by being shown that there has been a difference of purpose be­tween the Almighty and them."

Appalled by the juvenile behavior 
DearEditor: 

We were appalled by the juvenile behavior displayed by some unartistic individuals as ex­pressed through the defacement of several buildings on the campus this weekend. 
We realize that many may feel that a void has been created by the alteration ofthe social life, but we don't feel that it is necessary to stoop to such a low level ofbehavior to fill idle time. 
Up until this point, with few exceptions, we have been relatively impressed by the quality and caliber of students at this university, however, this "prank" has led us to believe that perhaps there are still a few people around that have nqt matured past the grade school level mentality required to perpetrate such a stunt. 
We can only hope that in the revealing light of dawn these "artists" were as distressed as we to see the havoc that they wreacked.

We left something out of the Constitution 
DearEditor: 

I am writing in response to Governor Cuomo's speech on defending his abortion public policy. I disagree with him. Cuomo: "Catholic public officials take an oath to preserve the Constitution...not because they love what others do with their freedom, but because they realize that in guaranteeing freedom for all, they guarantee our rights to be Catholics." 
In our constitution many rights are stated and guaranteed. One key resulting issue ofthe Constitution is a general thesis ofInnocent un­til proven guilty, and thus giving people "the benefit of the doubt." 
We all as humans, have the right to life (life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness). When are we humans? Scientists keep pushing this date back further and further toward concep­tion. Scientists cannot prove the date is con­ception, but we must give the developing individual"the benefit of the doubt." 
The developing fetus is human too. He also has the right to life. We did leave something out ofour constitution. 

Many issues need to be considered 
DearEditor: 
Since I have been on campus, many of the editorials in Tbe Observer have dealt with the single Issue ofabortion. I think It's time to add a little variety to your column. I think that we all should take the time to realize that the cam­paign this fall Is not a single issue campaign! There are many other important Issues to con­sider and discuss rather than always discuss­ing abortion. 
Instead, why don't we consider where each candidate stands on other issues? Such as the control of military spending and the true im­portance of nuclear disarmament? We have enough power In nuclear weapons to destroy (murder) the world (people) many times over. Is it really necessary? What is the point of this abominable Increase In nuclear weapons in the past few years? What about our current relations with other nations? 
Let's also consider the troubles that are going on in Central America. Do those countries need our help in the form of guns, bombs and such? Or do they need our help In the form of food for their starving and homes for their poor? I think that we are too con­cerned about being "tough" on the Soviets and Communism; so much so, that we have lost our perspective in the arena of Interna­tional Relations. 
Then, there Is always the deficit to fall back on. Should it really be this large? It's terrible to put it aside for even a moment because it Is so important to the economic health and stability of our nation. Can our economy survive with such an enormous deficit? What exactly has been done about It? 
How about considering social programs? We as Catholics should consider such sub­jects as civil rights, social security, prorams for the aged and disabled and programs to feed the children of economically deprived families. Is the current administration really giving these Issues the concern they deserve? 
Finally, why don't we talk about the envi­ronment for a while? Don't we need to con· serve our environment for our enjoyment and the enjoyment of generations to come? Shouldn't we be doing something more about pollution control, acid rain and toxic wastes that threaten our health and our lives? I haven't seen much done in the past few years on these thn;e very Important concerns, have you? 
I think that we, as somewhat educated voters, should look at all aspects of this years' campaign and not focus our attention on any single issue. We should set aside for a mo­ment, that we are Democrats or Republicans. We are all Americans, and we should vote for the candidate that most emulates our concern for the equality ofall people, no matter where they are or who they are.

Save a tree, don't write a rebuttal 
DearSirs: 
In regard to Tim O'Brien's letter regarding Fran Theby and Nancy John's letter regarding Chris Skorcz's letter regarding Marc Ramirez's article regarding freshmen, I would'just like to say that (now I ca¥\'t remember) Oh yeah, what we have here/is a very important Issue. My God! It is Important, that Is right really lm· portant, you bet it's Important, It's as Impor­tant as... I can't think ofanything as Important as this important issue! Yes, sir, Important all right. Anyway, I have a solution to this Impor­tant issue. Take the entire freshman class and break it into two teams, the captain of one team will be Marc Ramirez and the captain of the other will be Chris Skorcz. Each team will be armed with three obscene phone calls, four baseless Insults, five cheap shots, and limitless supplies ofletters to the editor. The game will be terminated when either side acknowledges that they are taking themselves too seriously or when all members die of old age, which­ever comes first. 
Iopenly acknowledge that this letteris face­tious, stupid and probably the result of brain 
rot.  Therefore...SAVE  A  TREE,  DO  NOT

ND suntnter ­where the real action is  
by Cat Francis features copy editor  
The school year ends. Crews ofworkmen roll huge tarpaulins over the halls of Notre Dame. The Administration Building is encased in plastic, to guard against nicks and scratches. The squirrels, chipmunks and other small furry animals are returned to their cages. The campus waits, silent and empty, gathering cobwebs until next September. Well, maybe not. Try this scenario instead. The students, haggard from late night studying for finals, stagger out of their dorm rooms, and vanish softly and silently away. The campus breathes a sigh ofreliefand buckles down for the real action. Summer school is, ofcourse, a main part of this action. Professors, instead ofbooking seats on the next flight to the French Riviera or dusting off their inner-tubes, polish up their notes and sharpen their chalk. Summer school at Notre Dame is a curious blend ofvery basic courses and graduate level studies. The student body for the summer consists ofhigh school and graduate students, with a scattering ofundergrads who either desperately need credits or just want to keep their hands in. The hours are longer, and the pace a little faster. The classes are smaller, and involve more discussion than most. But while these students swelter in classrooms, even more goes on, outside. The major event, hailed with much fanfare and hoopla, is the week the Wally Byam trailer people come to campus. Hundreds of silver trailers, contoured like marshmallows to reduce air resistance, stream onto campus and proceed to set up housekeep­ing. I've been told that the Airstream trailers are the creme de Ia creme ofthe trailer world. They're sturdier, longer-lasting, more expensive. Their proud occupants set up flags next to their campsites. Almost every trailer has three: an American flag, one showing their state oforigin, and another with the traditional Wally Byam emblem. Wally Byam is, I gather, the man who started the whole thing. I don't know where they go after they depart. Perhaps they wander to some other campus, or else cruise the highways of America in an endless search for some unimaginable Wally Byam Truth. What goes on in the mind ofsomeone who drives thousands of miles to sit in a parking lot in the middle ofSouth Bend, Indiana? Do they show slides oftheir vacation here? Do they display their souvenirs of Notre Dame on their mantels? Where are they when they're not here? The only time ofyear I glimpse one of those silver shapes is while they're convening here on campus. Perhaps Notre Dame is sacrosanct to t~em. Like the fabled Elephants' Graveyard, the Golden Dome may be regarded as the sacred meeting place ofthe Airstream trailers. Soon after they trundle out, however, another incredible phenomenon takes their place. American Youth On Parade. It boggles the mind. What does this name mean? Why are they on parade? Why do they parade at Notre Dame? For whatever reason, they do arrive. And for yet another week the campus is infested, but with a totally different breed. Children in sequined outfits, each with a baton firmly clutched in one sweaty little hand. Elaborate costumes worthy ofa Broadway musical. Station wagons with banners in the rear windows, proclaiming that riding in this very car is "Miss Sweet Valley, 1982." I have never witnessed the strange and arcane rituals that then take place in the ACC. And frankly, I'm not sure that I want to. I was at a drugstore one day last summer when a flock ofthem came in. They went to the make-up counter and, as God is my witness, proceeded to discuss the various merits ofeach and every shade oflipstick. Luckily, my bus arrived and I left before they moved on to the fingernail polish. Once America's little sweethearts migrate elsewhere, the campus again lies barren. But not for long. The trailer and mobile home show arrives. For a few very special days, you can see every new model of mobile home being manufactured. The representa­tives lure visitors to their booths with various inticements like posters, balloons, free food. Several years ago, I allowed myself to be persuaded to attend this spectacular extravaganza. I came home with three posters, several dozen key chains, two plastic leis, a drinking cup which folds up, a whistle shaped like Yogi Bear, several reams ofbrightly colored pamphlets, a sunburn, a headache and a vow to never return. I think next year I'll just hide. Summers at Notre Dame are far too exciting for the likes ofme.  

Heifer is a hand up, not hand out 
by Moe Brick 
features staff writer 

H
eifer Project International is not a foreign study program for cows, as its name might suggest, but an Arkansas-based volunteer organi­zation which raises various types of livestock, poultry and bees to be sl:tipped to third world countries. The healthy animals are then breed to increase herds in developing countries. The measure is seen as a hand up, not a hand out. 
Last Tuesday the group held a meeting to inform students of the organization through discussion and a film strip on HPI's history, and to encourage Notre Dame and Saint Mary's students to spend their Fall break down on the farm, on the group's trip to Arkansas. The group also outlined the different geo­graphical areas to be assisted by the project. 
HPI was conceived, incredible as it may seem, by a Hoosier named Daniel West. West was working in Spain during the Spanish Civil War in the 1940's. He felt sad giving out the meager supplies ofmilk to children, as it was quickly gone while always needed the next day. So the thought occurred to West, "why not just give them a heifer? Then the children can have milk all of the time." 
Unfortunately World War II started soon after this idea was put into action, and only one shipment ofdonated midwestern animals ever made it to Spain. However, the dream offeeding the children per­sisted, and after the war Heifer Project International turned its attention to war-ravaged Europe and Asia. Japan received so many 
goats that today many farmers know 
exactly where their livestock dec­
sended from: HPJ heifers. After the 
Korean War, chickens were sent to 
South Korea. Today it is estimated 
that one halfofall poultry in that 
country are decsended from the 
government's joint efforts with HPI. 
Here in the U.S., a program has been established in Mississippi, where people who earn less than 52,000 per year can get college training at a Heifer Project farm. Upon graduation they receive an animal. The deal is, however, that the animal's first born must be given back to the college, to be given to a future graduate; thus continuing the program. 
People who go to Arkansas for fall break will work about eight hours a day, beginning around six or eight in the morning. Their chores will include working with the animals, painting and carpentry work. Non­working hours can be spent learn­ing more about the economics of the project or hiking through the farm's beautiful 1,200 acre expanse. 
The farm is about a 15 hour drive from Notre Dame, just north of Little Rock. The cost for the week will be less than S40, with the parti­cipants buying and preparing their own food, while staying at a large house on the farm. 
Although HPJ is founded upon Christian beliefs, the project is interdenominatioal. Generally the Protestant churches and different volunteer organizations that partici­pate have their members fulfill a mandatory week ofservice for a week at the farm. 
The Project also sells its high­quality stock to local farmers to earn 60 percent ofits operating expenses. The animals are bred for third world conditions, so that all of them (goats, pigs, sheep, cows, rabbits and bees) are especially productive, hardy and mature at an early age. Volunteers, however, are the basis of the organization, for it is only through them that labor costs are minimized and animals are cared for. 
Why work on a farm? For one thing, it is a unique and perhaps once-in-a-lifetime experience. Secondly, one's efforts are in­directly helping malnourished people throughout the world. Unlike receiving a handout from rich Americans, poor people are instead gaining self-respect, dignity and hope. The best thing about this is that it does not stop here. Instead, it is given to others as a part of the deal made with Heifer Project. 
This project shows that people have a different attitude toward hand outs than they do toward responsibility. HPJ's philosophy brings to mind that age old adage, "Give a man a fish, and he will eat for a day," under HPI "teach a man to fish ... " and he will develop a fleet ofboats which will employ countless countrymen and increase his country's balance of trade. The Biblical similarities are apparent. The actual results can be seen in successful areas ofEquador, South Korea and japan. 
For people who may be inter­ested in learning more about this alternative for fall break, there will be a meeting this Wednesday night at 8 in the Center for Social Con­cerns. Ifyou want to go, bring lots ofenthusiasm and ... your overalls!

DALLAS -Been looking high and low for a desk in the shape ofa longhorn steer? Or maybe you've been prowling the stores looking for a nice chair in the shape ofa spotted dog? 
Look no further. The Neiman­

Marcus Co. has mailed out its 
Christmas catalogs, a traditional 
source ofimaginative, unusual and 
high-priced goodies. 
For the cost-conscious, the cata­log mailed out Monday features · eight pages ofgifts at $25 and un­der, and four pages ofpresents at no or less. 
But for those with money, this year's "his & hers" gift is a lifelike

creation ofa longhorn, or a horse, available for a mere 565,000. It's made ofeight exotic woods, and a fold-down desk or vanity, with shelves and drawers, is built into its side. 
The spotted dog armchair, hand­carved and painted, sells for S450, while a canvas cat floor mat goes for $125. 
NEW YORK-Awoman on a flight from London to New York forgot that she had concealed S4,000 in her pantyhose and dropped the whole bundle down the plumbing when she visited the lavatory. 
"She was somewhat beside her· 
self," said a TWA spokesman who 
spoke on condition he not be iden­
tified. 
A TWA report on Friday's acci­
dent said simply: "When nature 
called, the money went down the 
tube." 
After TWA's Flight 701 landed at 
Kennedy Airport, the woman ex­
plained her plight and two TWA 
ramp servicemen volunteered to 
check as the effluent was pumped 
off the plane, and found the money. 
The $100 bills were "laundered" and returned to her, the spokesman said. The airline did not release the names ofthe woman or the helpful ground crew.

lege level or at any other level of coaching. 
"The athletic department says that there has never been money in the budget for a bus driver, but I have always had one and they have always paid for it," stated Rouse. "I think that it is a joke, an embarrass­ment, that a national college cannot provide a bus driver." 
His complaint is not about local games such as Bethel College, but rather concerning the trips of 150 or 200 miles one-way, or even a 700 mile round-trip to Iowa. 
As for recruiting, Rouse claims that the Belles probably could not even field a team without it. To back his claims he cites last year as an ex­ample. Without recruits he would have had only five or six players try out for the team, and this year would have been a repeat performance. 
Although Rouse says that he sent over 800 letters, made over 300 telephone calls and scouted about 10 games last year, the athletic de­partment told him that there is not one penny available for recruiting this year. 


"They said that it has never been in the budget before, but I have al­ways had it," Rouse said. "lfit has not been in the budget, then where has the money come from? 
"I have brought in five to 10 stu­dents during the past two years who probably would not have attended Saint Mary's. At SIO,OOO a year during four years for only five stu­dents, this accounts for over $200,000 ofincome for Saint Mary's, but I cannot even get them to spend $1000 a year in return for recruit­ing." 
In that which concerns the Na­tional Catholic Basketball Tournament at Iowa beginningJanu­ary 9, 1985, Rouse feels that one full week is "a minimal amount ofprepa­ration" for such a tournament, espe­cially since the team will not have practiced since December 9. The present budget accounts for only five days which Rouse considers to­tally unacceptable.

into shape physically and mentally in such a short time after being out that long. E~en a full week is pushing it," he said. 
"I am not asking for anything more, but just for the same things that I have had for the past two years," Rouse adds. "The point is that if Saint Mary's wants to have a team and wants to be able to com­pete, they ace going to have to spend a little money." 
Although Nester was unavailable for comment, Rouse feels that she understands his point of view, but might have her hands tied by the ad­ministration. 
"I am only disappointed in that I feel she is not even going to try to negotiate these points," commented Rouse, "and I think they are going to lose more in the long run than what little that they might gain now." 
Representing the players' inter­ests, senior captain Elaine Suess set up a meeting between her teammates and Nester which was to have taken place this morning to de­termine the future ofa team that was scheduled to begin practice Mon: day. 
Suess denied comment on the topic until after the adjournment of this morning's meeting. 
It appears that the ball is in the athletic department's court, because Rouse would like to continue as coach and would be willing to live with all of the lesser problems if these three main areas could be worked out. Under the present con­ditions, however, he stands firm in his decision to resign, and he will live by it. 
It only remains to be seen ifSaint Mary's can do the same.

Notre Dame gets third at golf championships 
The Notre Dame golf team placed third out of 1 7 teams at the Indiana Intercollegiate Golf Championships held last weekend. The Irish, with a 36-hole score of 623, finished be­hind Purdue and Ball State, with scores of606 and 613, respectively. 
The championships were held at the Golf Club ofIndiana in Lebanon, which is rated one of the top four courses in the Hoosier state. 
In the individual category, the top Notre Dame finisher was freshman Rich Connelly. Connelly, who had a two-day total of 1 50 with scores of 74 and 76, finished fourth overall out of 85 golfers. 
"I'm overjoyed with Rich's perfor­mance," says Notre Dame coach Noel O'Sullivan, "but not totally surprised. I recruited him as my one freshman recruit." 
Dan Palm of Valparaiso was the medalist of the championships with a total score of 145. His 18-hole 
scores  of  pac-72  and  73  were  
compared  by  O'Sullivan  to  pro  
scores.  

Junior captain John O'Donovan, as the second-highest Irish golfer in the individual standings, captured eighth place. His scores of76 and 77 gave him a two-day total of 153. 
"John showed excellent leader­ship by his performance," com­ments O'Sullivan. "There's no doubt about it." 
Notre Dame's Chris Bona took tenth place with a score of 154 (76,

78), giving the Irish three of the top 1 0 finishers. 
. "When you can get three players in the top 1 0," says O'Sullivan, "that's really saying something. I'm really proud ofour guys." 
Junior John Anthony was the fourth Notre Dame finisher with a 36-hole 166. Lon Hu.tlman rounded out the five Irish golfers with a 171. 
"The putting pact of Lon's game got to him," O'Sullivan says. "He just had an off day. He'll probably never have another off day like this again. In golf, you just can't afford to have eight three-put greens like he had." 
Next Sunday, Monday and Tues­day, the Irish golfing contingent travels to the Midwestern City Con­ference Championships at the French Lick Golf Resort in French lick, Ind. Notre Dame finished third at this tournament last year behind Oral Roberts and Oklahoma City, both of which have full-scholarship golf programs. 
The Irish will play 54 holes during the three-day tournament and com­pete against the eight other schools in the conference. Junior Steve Fuh­rer, winner of the Notre Dame Open, will be a sixth Notre Dame golfer at the conference champion­ships, giving the Irish four first-time golfers at the MCCC. 
By next week at this time O'Sullivan should have a better ide~ of just how talented his team really is.

'Doctor's orders' 

help football 
Chuck Freeby 
Sports Writer 
Irish Items 
Hello again, everybody! 
You can now take the Irish football team off the critical list and 
move them into the improving category. 
S;nurday afternoon's rout of Colorado seemed to be just what the 
doctor ordered for Gerry Faust's Fighting Irish and their fans, as a 
"wave" of confidence rolled througl1 Notrt: Dame Stadium. The 
Irish, who had been looking very ill in previous weeks, snapped out 
ofit in convincing style by using clinical execution to bury the Buf­
faloes. 

Now the question is why are the Irish looking so much better in their last six quarters ofplay than in their first six? Part of the reason stems from the fact that Colorado just was not as good a football team as Purdue or Michigan State, but that is not the only explanan­tion. It seems as though the good doctor has reached into his black · bag and pulled out a few medications for the Irish, and some ofthem 
appear to be working. For instance .. _ 
Take a pass on first down and call me in the end zone_ .. Steve 
Beuerlein has been tremendous at quarterback, but part of the rea­
son for his success stems from a new-found unpredictability in the 
Irish offense. Purdue didn't exactly need jeanne Dixon to know the 
Irish were going to run on first down, but that has changed in recent 
weeks. 

On 1 0 occasions over the last two weeks, Beuerlein has passed on 
first down. On four drives when Notre Dame threw on first down, 
the Irish scored. The Irish have taken advantage of linebackers 
keying on Allen Pinkett, and that's one of t.he reasons Beuerlein has 
been so effective. 
Avoid hazardous turnovers . .. This is the simplest reason for the 
resurgence of the Irish. In the first six quarters of 1984, the Irish 
treated the football as though it had some kind ofdisease, turning the 
ball over nine times. Now the Irish offense is treating the football like 
it was a steady girlfriend, holding on and never letting go. Notre 
Dame has not turned the ball over once in the last six quarters and 
now seem to realize that the football field is no place for generosity. 
Restyour secondary by rushing tbe passer . .. Opposing quarter­
backs have not been riddling the secondary in the last two games, 
mainly because the secondary has received some help from the de­
fensive line. After recording only one sack against Purdue, the "Gold 
Rush" has come to life with six sacks in two weeks. Now opposing 
signal-callers do not have the luxury of waiting for a receiver to get 
open, and the result has been a much more effective Irish pass 
defense. 

One reason for tbe improved play of tbe Notre Dame football team in tbe last game-and-a-balf opponents by passing on first down several times. bas been tbe lack of turnovers by players sucb as In bis column on this page, Cbuck Freeby describes quarterback Steve Beuerlein and tailback Allen the team's situation as it prepares for Saturday's 
Pinkett. Beuerlein also bas surprised Notre Dame's game at Missouri. 
Saint Mary's basketball coach resigns amidst budget controversy 
Student fans make the grade 
Tiger Tidbits... Missouri is known as the "Show-Me State," as in a Tiger fan's plea to "show me some victories." The Tigers are 1-2 entering this week's action, following a 47-30 win over Mississippi State last weekend. The frustration in Columbia stems from seeing a comeback fall short against Illinois in the season opener, then blowing a 28-7 fourth quarterlead against Wisconsin one week later. However, last week's win proved there is still hope for Missouri, and the Tigers will be looking at this game as though it were a bowl matchup. 
The toughest task for the Irish will be stopping Missouri's high­powered offense. The Tigers are fifth in the nation in total offense, averaging 475 yards per game and scoring 35 points an outing. Walk­on Marlon Adler is likely to start at quarterback, and he will offer the Irish the challenge ofa mobile quarterback. When Adler goes to the air, he will look for flanker George Shorthose or split ends Andy Hill and Adrian McBride. 
On the ground, Mizzou has used its depth well. Tailback Jon Redd is the main man for the Tigers, averaging 5.9 yards a carry. When it's close to the end zone though, look for bruising fullback Eric Drain to get the call. Drain carried for three touchdowns last week, and it will be up to the Irish defense to plug Drain near the goal line. 
Defense is something the Tigers have been lacking. Missouri has been giving up acreage to their opponents, especially against the pass, and it has led to a plethora ofscoring. Ifthe Tigers are going to shut the Irish down, they will need a big game from linebacker Tracey Mack and free safety Anthony Frazier. 
Pick ofthe Week. .. Since we have already discussed the pleasant topic ofwhat is right with the Irish, it's time to move on to the "Pick of the Week". There's no doubt that it is high time to shine the spot­light on Coach Dennis Grace and his Irish soccer team. 
The Irish kickers are flying high in Grace's first year, entering tonight's game at Loyola with a 6-1-1 record. The Irish will return home for your chance to see them this weekend, playing host to DePaul under the lights of Cartier Field on Friday night at 8:00, before entertaining St. Joseph's at Alumni Field Sunday at 2:00. The action is always exciting, so don't miss out on any of it this weekend. 
By MARK B. JOHNSON 
Saint Mary's Sports Editor 
Amidst confusion and contro­versy concerning the budget al­lotted to his program this season, third-year coach Mike Rouse resigned yesterday as mentor of Saint Mary's up-and-coming basket­ball team just days before practice was scheduled to begin. 
"This was a very difficult decision for me to make," explained Rouse,· "but we are talking about a top na­tional college not being able to run a basketball program." 
The last three-plus years ofNotre Dame football have been a real test for all involved with the program, in­cluding the players and fans. As far as grades go, nobody has done very well. 
The football team's grades have ranged from poor to mediocre fur the most part. The coaches have scored even a little lower as they have not used their vast supply oftalent very well. 
The media coverage, so important in maintaining the Notre Dame mystique, does not deserve a very high score, either. There has been some wild speculation about potential coaches like Howard Schnellenberger (who doesn't have a prayer ofcoaching at NO). Some of the national media, especially the Chicago papers, have been brutal and unfair at times. And, finally, there has been quite a deal of candy-coated coverage by some of the local media who can't afford to get on the school's bad side. 
Then, there are the many Notre Dame fans-in partic­ular the students -who quickly are improving their grade as the 1984 season progresses. 
The students have changed quite a bit since the beginning of the 1981 season. At that point, the stu­dents were used to big seasons, major bowl games and the hope ofa national championship. Three years later, the students still hope for a national championship, but they now realize that big seasons and major bowl games are things not to be assumed. 
It's taken a tough few years for the students to realize this. 
At first, when the team began losing regularly and even finished with a losing record, everyone acted like it was just a bad nightmare. The 1982 season woke everyone up and showed them that it was no dream, that Notre Dame can, indeed, lose, and lose frequently. It was this realization that began the students and other fans on what has been an emotional roller-coaster ride. When the team won, people got very excited and started dreaming ofold times. When the team lost, the disappointment was very great. 
This point has been made before, though. What has changed is that people, especially the students, are fi­nally starting to get control of their emotions. 
The last three weeks have been a great example. In the past, a loss to Purdue would have h;td the students 
According to Rouse, the athletic department informed him and the other Saint Mary's coaches of this year's budget division in a meeting last Thursday. The budget had been approved prior to this year by Erin Lorenz, former Director of Athletics and Recreation, and is now being firmly upheld by Dr. Jo Ann Nester, Lorenz's replacement. 
Problems arise in three major areas for Rouse, including the exclu­sion from the budget of funds for a bus driver, for recruiting, and for a full week of practice before the Na­tional Catholic Basketball Tourna-

howling just like they did after the Michigan State and Miami losses last year. However, this year, there was little reaction besides the usual disappointment of a loss. Meanwhile, the national media and alumni were going crazy. 
The same level-headedness seems to have prevailed this week despite the impressive score of the Colorado game. Fifty-five points is quite a high number, even higher than the 52 points the Irish scored against Purdue last year. However, nobody is putting much im­portance on the final score. The Buffaloes are a battered team, physically and emotionally, and it is understan­dable that they got wiped out by a better team. It was a good confidence-builder for the players, but that's about all. 
What's going to decide whether this is going to be an outstanding season for Notre Dame are the next two weeks. If the Irish can beat both Missouri and Miami, they deserve to be in the top ten. Otherwise, a finish in the second ten is probably the best Notre Dame can hope for. 
Missouri, despite its I-2 record, is going to be tough to beat in Columbia. The Tigers realize that a win over Notre Dame could turn their season around. A loss, with Nebraska and Oklahoma still ahead on the schedule, would probably finish them off. 
Miami should be even tougher to beat as the Hur­ricanes will get two weeks off(ifyou don't count Satur­day's toughie against Rice) to think about their 38-3loss to Florida State this past weekend. They also realize that hopes for a major bowl are riding on the game. But, then, the Irish can't afford to think about that now. 
Notre Dame has reached No. 19 in the country by playing consistent, intense, aggressive football. The Irish can go much higher in the polls, if they can keep playing that way. Maybe then, too, their grades can im­prove as much as the grades of the students. 
ment after Christmas vacation. 
Analyzing these three areas separately, Rouse finds the same_ problem as their mutual cause: the unwillingness of Saint Mary's to spend the money that is necessary to field a varsity basketball team, let alone a competitive one. 
In past years the coaches have had the option to drive to away contests, an option that Rouse has never taken because he feels strongly that it is not a part of his job and that it is definitely not called for at the col-

The Notre Dame football schedule became a little clearer yes­terday when it was announced that ESPN would televise the Notre Dame-Miami game on October 6. The live national telecast will push the starting time of the game to 6:45 p.m. A portable lighting system will be brought in for the game. 
The game will be the fourth Irish home game in the last three years to use the portable lights. Notre Dame beat Michigan under the lights, 23-17, in the 1982 season opener, while losing to Penn State that same year and Pitt last season in late-afternoon games. 
Also announced yesterday was the public sale of a number of South Carolina general admission tickets. The tickets, which go on sale tomorrow for S16 each, were part of South Carolina's original allotment
