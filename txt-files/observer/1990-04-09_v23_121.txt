Volunteer 
learns the joy 
of giving 
Sara's broken English might have been frustrating to some, but not to the girls who gave up a Saturday of sleep and relaxation to give her day care center a 

paint job. Monica Vant 
When our Christmas in April crew was sent Assistant News Editor to the center, my first response was relief-relief that we wouldn't be picking up leaves for eight hours in 30­degree weather. But after spending the afternoon with Sara, and the others at the center, my selfish attitude changed, and I couldn't believe that I had actually consid­ered turning off the alarm and skipping the entire event. 
Sara runs "Proyecto Madre," a project for single parents designed to help them orga­nize their life. As the crew helped her cover the blackboards before painting the aging building, she explained that the Lord's Prayer was written on the board in Spanish because many of the children are learning English as a second language. 
Her directions may have been a little on the meticulous side, such as suggesting that we paint the lock and chain on a set of doors that hasn't been used in a year, but they were far from dictatorial. She was thrilled that we were there, and as we pro­gressed from room to room, she did nothing but rant and rave about our work, which was far from a professional paint job. 
When Sara learned that I spoke a little Spanish, we worked together to teach the other painters Spanish songs and cheers. As she fluttered from room to room, supervis­ing our work, she would break into song, encouraging us to follow suit. By the end of the day, the "Coffee Song" was so popular that I had volunteered to copy the words and translation for our crew. 
1 honestly had no idea that the experience 
would affect me, at all. I've never really 
been much for volunteer work-not because 
I'm opposed to helping others, but simply 
because I never had the time. But spending 
an afternoon with Sara, and seeing hoiW 
something as simple as painting could be so 
significant, I think I'll have to make the 
time. 

I learned a lot about Sara that day. 1 
learned how her life had changed since she 
left Cuba. I learned about her children, their 
careers, their spouses' careers, and her 
longing for a granddaughter. 
But more important than the miniscule 
details about the life of someone I may 
never see again, I learned about myself. 
While I'm not planning to jump on the near­
est volunteer bandwagon, I do think I'll be 
more apt to give to others what I've for so 
long thought I couldn't. 
Sara told me that "Proyecto Madre" is in 
dire need of blankets, and asked me to do 
what I could to help. While I'm not sure if 
others will respond, I know that I'll have a 
package sent to the center within the week. 
It's the least I can do.

The conservative New Democracy party sun­day won the most seats in Greece's third parliamentary election in 10 months and appeared close to the outright majority needed to break the country's political deadlock, according to partial results. Opinion polls had indicated Sunday's balloting could also be inconclusive. However, caretaker Interior Minister Theodore Katrivanos told re­porters early Monday that New Democracy was close to an outright majority in the 300-member single-house Par­liament.

The estate of Liberace, who died in 1987 from AIDS, went up for auction in Palm Springs, Calif. The late, flamboyant pianist's trademark candelabra, silver and a Steinway grand piano were among the 2,000 furnishings and artwork sold from "The Cloisters," his Palm Springs es­tate. The sale raised $300,000, with 

proceeds benefiting the Liberace Foundation for the Per­forming and Creative Arts, which provides scholarships to students of the arts.

Celebrated novelist Mario Llosa won the first round of presidential elections in Lima, Peru Sunday, but he fell far short of the majority needed to avoid a runoff, according to unofficial projections. Llosa, 54, of the cen­ter-right Democratic Front coalition, has run on a free­market ticket. He said the results showed voters had re­jected leftist policies and the governing left-of-center Aprista Party for its "catastrophic five years in govern­ment.' Alberto Fujimori, a political independent, was in second place in projections with 26.7%. 
A federal judge barred police Sunday from confiscating photographs from an exhibition of Robert Mapplethorpe's works in Cincinnati, Ohio that led to an obscenity indictment against an arts center and its director. U.S. District Judge Carl Rubin also ordered county and city authorities not to interfere in any way with the exhibition while the obscenity charges are tried in state court. The Contemporary Arts Center hailed the protective order, which will let the 175-photo exhibit proceed unchanged until a jury can decide whether its seven sexually explicit photos are obscene.

to pay his respects to the fam­ily. 
"He was a personal friend," said Jackson, who had given White a red Mustang sports car and kept in ~equent touch by telephone. White was Jackson's guest at the star's California ranch over the New Year's hol­iday. 
"He was a good friend of mine, and I'm too overcome 
with grief to talk about it," the 
reclusive Jackson said in a 
statement. 

Three limousines took Jack­son, Trump and their en­tourages to the Whites' home in Cicero, about 20 miles north of Indianapolis, where the car Jackson had given White was parked on the front lawn, sur­rounded by floral arrange­ments. 
Jackson, Mrs. White and An­drea walked over to the car. Jackson sat in the back seat and Andrea started the car so that he could listen to the sound system. 
White's legal and medical fight was dramatized in a 1989 television movie, "The Ryan White Story," in which he had a cameo role. He also helped de­velop an AIDS education pro­gram called "I have AIDS -A Teen-ager's Story," which won a Peabody award. 
White's attorney, Charles Vaughan, called White a "courageous young man." 
"He went through his case more !'or others, so that they wouldn't have to endure, than he did for himself ... ," Vaughan said. "He fought it to the end. There was no quit in Ryan White." 
Dr. Woodrow Myers Jr., who as Indiana stat~-1 health com­missioner supported White during his legal battle, said his death meant "the nation has lost one of its major leaders ... a major spoke'sperson on the disease." 
"Through his eloquence, he showed all of us our true colors and showed all of us we had picked the wrong enemy," said 
_ Myers, now New York City health commissioner. "We should have been fighting all along against the disease rather than the people who had it." 
According to the federal Cen­ters for Disease Control, more than 2,000 U.S. children have gotten AIDS since the epidemic began a decade ago. 
White's last public appear­ance was with Reagan and his wife, Nancy, at an Oscar party.

ployment and student loans.

DULUTH, Minn. (AP) -A strike by longshoremen against stevedoring companies in the Twin Ports entered its third day Sunday as the companies con­tinued to use supervisory em­ployees to load grain ships. 
Supervisors were loading grain onto the Algonorth, the second ship of the season to arrive in the Twin Ports, and Duluth longshoremen said they had been locked out of their jobs. 
Longshoremen in neighboring Superior, Wis., went on strike Friday at the Harvest States Cooperative's elevator, the largest grain elevator in the Twin Ports.

It's not what you would normally think of wlwn you lwar "dancn tlwatrn." ISO (I'm So Optimistic) has lweonw wnll known as a modnrn dance company that foeusns nqually on both dancP and tlwatrics. 
The dances are physically demanding, as the four perform to quick-tempo songs such as the Talking Heads'"Psycho Killer" and the Beatie's "Helter Skelter." 
Tlw four-nwmher group has pPrfornwd all across tlw Unitnd Statns and in l·:uropn for almost forty wm~ks in its latest tour. The mmnbers. Daniel Ezralow, .lamns !Iampton, Ashley Holand and Morlnigh Steinberg, have all had extensive background in dance, including performances with the dance company 
MOMIX, from which ISO 
evolvnd in 1987. 
Between MOMIX and ISO, the nwmbnrs have been in the mu­sic videos of U2, Simply Hed, David Bowie and Sting. They also chon~ograplwd for and appnarnd in thn movie "Earth <;iris An~ Easy". 
!SO's form of dance allows for humor and great creativity bf~C<tuse of its focus on the physical actions and the light­ing rather than nlaborate props or costumes. The dam~es arc physically demanding, as the fintr perform to quick-tempo songs such as thn Talking I leads' "Psycho Killer" and the Beatie's "llelter Sk1~ltnr." Most of ISO's dances arn theme­orinntnd, with such titles as "D.N.A.," "Night Thoughts," "Captain Tenacity" (a solo perfornwd by Holand.) "Blind Vnrwtian." and "Linguini Arms." Thn dances vary in thnme from humorous to stark imagery that creates a message for the viewer. It promises to be one of the most interesting pieces of dance theatre ever. 
ISO will perform tonight at 8 p.m. in Washington Ilall. Tickets are $5 for students, $8 for non-students, and may be purchased at the Lafortune Information Desk.

Mears begins season with a victory 
SPORTS BRIEFS 
PHOENIX (AP) -Rick Mears started 1990 the way he ended 1989-in the winner's circle. 
Mears took the lead 68 laps into the race Sunday and ran away from the field to repeat as champion at the Autoworks 200, the season-opening event for Indy cars, at Phoenix International Raceway. 
Mears. who ended last year by winning the final race on the CART-PPG circuit at Laguna Seca, Calif., averaged 126.291 mph in his Chevrolet-powered Penske 90 and earned $88,708. 
His time of 1 hour. 35 min­utes. 1.112 seconds was 7.256 seconds -about a third of a mile -better than runner-up Bobby Rahal. 
AI Unser Jr.. Rahal's team­mate on the Galles-Kraco Racing team. was third. Rahal's average speed was 126.130 mph. and Unser averaged 
126.090 mph. 

Mario Andretti was fourth, Mears' Penske Racing team­mates Emerson Fittipaldi and Danny Sullivan were fifth and sixth, respectively, and Eddie Cheever, the only American on the Formula One Grand Prix circuit last year, placed seventh in his first Indy-car race since 1986. 
Mears won the pole and the

oval.  lie  went  on  to  capture  
four  other  poles,  two  other

Mears picked up where he left off after an opening hitch. 
Unser, starting from the out­side of the front row. got the jump on Mears at the start, beating him into the first turn and getting Mears to back off. 
Unser gave up the lead to Hahal, who joined the Albuquerque-based Galles or-

•·-Old Masters can't bring home green jacket from tournament 
Nicklaus couldn't muster final run for title at Augusta 
AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) -This time, Jack Nicklaus couldn't muster the back-nine magic that had produced six Masters championships. 
On Sunday, the 50-year-old Nicklaus fell victim to a hole which had produced many of his most dramatic moments ­the treacherous 170-yard par-3 No. 16. He hit a fat 7 -iron and the ball found the pond in front of the green. The ensuing bogey finished off his chances for a seventh green jacket. 
''I'm disappointed," said Nicklaus, whose goal is to win a Senior Tour event and a regu­lar tour tournament in the same year. "At the age of 50, I'm not going to have that many chances. " 
Nicklaus struggled to a final­round two-over par 7 4 and a 72-hole score of 3-under 285. He was seven shots behind Ray Floyd and playoff winner Nick Faldo when it was all over. 
"I never did get that big run going," Nicklaus said. "I knew I couldn't play just regular golf. I had to try to play catch-up golf. When you try to play catch-up at Augusta National, then you are going to lose two strokes every time you make a mistake. And I made a couple of mistakes." 
Nicklaus even wore a golden 
"Golden Bear" half-sweater for 
the occasion, indicating he felt 
good about his chances. 
Nicklaus, who was the oldest 
winner of the Masters at 46 in 
1986, had a five-shot deficit 
when the day began. 
"I still thought I was in it when I made back-to-hack birdies on 12 and 13," Nicklaus said. "The bogey on 10 hurt but I got back at 'Amen Corner' with a 15-foot birdie at 12. Then I two-putted for another birdie at 13. 
"But I hit a bad chip at 14 for 
a bogey then a fat shot on 16. 
That did it." 
Nicklaus was 5-over for the 
week on par-3s. 
"I dropped way back then

Floyd blows four-shot lead in most disappointing loss 

AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) -Haymond Floyd called it "the most devastating thing that's happened to me in my career." 
Floyd, at 47 trying to become the oldest Masters champion, blew a 4-shot lead with six holes to play Sunday and then lost the championship on the second hole of a sudden-death playoff to defending champion 
Nick Faldo. 

''I've had a lot of losses, but never like this," the distraught Floyd said. "I've never felt like 
this ever. I've never had any­thing affect me like this. 
"At this stage of your career, how· many chances are you go­ing to get?" 
Floyd appeared to be on a cakewalk to victory with a birdie on the par-3 12th, one that put him four shots ahead of Faldo, the Englishman who was to become only the second player to put together consecu­tive Masters titles. 
"I didn't think I could lose it," Floyd said. 
"I think what happened was nobody ever got running at me early," he said. "That dictated play. I started playing for pars, I think not consciously. But that's what happened. I just think that was the way the round set up." 
The victory that slipped away would have put Floyd in the record book as the only player

Professional Vision 
Instead, it was Faldo who 
carved out history by winning 
his second Masters in a row, a 
feat previously accomplished 
only by Nicklaus in 1965 and 
1966. 

Faldo forced the playoff with 
birdies on Nos. 13, 15 and 16, 
and a bogey-5 by Floyd on the 
17th, when he three-putted 
from 50 feet. 

Both players parred No. 10, 
the first playoff hole, although 
Faldo had to come out of the 
sand to do it. 

The task became easy for 
Faldo when Floyd's second shot 
on 11 caught the pond guarding 
the green. 

After dropping, Floyd pitched 
to 15 feet from the cup, lying 4. 
Faldo's second shot stopped 18 feet from the hole. He lagged to a foot, tapped in for par and had the victory. 
"I competed marvelously well all week," Floyd said. "That's one thing I can be proud of when I look back. I did not play well today. It was a struggle." 
Asked what the victory would .have meant to him, Floyd replied: 
"It would have meant so 
much that you can't imagine. 
To be the oldest to win the 
Masters, to have broken the 
par-3 jinx ... everything." 
Floyd had won the par-3 
competition Wednesday. No one 
has ever won the Masters after 
winning that pretournament 
competition. 

He was asked if his feelings 
might not be as bad had he lost 
in regulation. 

"To blow it coming in and not 
get in a playoff," he concluded. 
"that would have been worse."

New owner of Mariners not afraid to spend in attempt to bring his club out of doldrums 
SEATTLE (AP)-New Seattle Mariners owner Jeff Smulyan has made his fortune bv bor­rowing money virtually' every way possible. He spends a lot, too. 
The 43-year-old Indianapolis broadcasting magnate has built his fortune on bank loans, junk bonds, credit lines and private r.ontracts. 
The result has been a com­pany -Emmis Broadcasting ­built from nearly nothing to $75-million-a-year revenues in little more than a decade. Emmis Broadcasting Co. paid Smulyan $1.7 million last year. 
His company purchased a new multimillion-dollar corpo­rate jet last month. It spent $100,000 to paint the Mariners logo on the plane's tail. 
Borrowing money in huge amounts isn't cheap. Emmis spends $2.5 million a month just on interest, according to the most recent financial statements on file with the fed­eral Securities and Exchange Commission. 
Smulyan said his company's growth strategy is described in those filings as one of borrow­ing and buying. 
Records show Smulyan's em­pire owes more than its worth. 
At the time of the filing last November, the company owned 11 radio stations, a magazine and other properties valued at $182 million, and had debts of $219 million. 
Smulyan has had great ideas and great bankers. His philos­ophy has been to buy underval­ued, money-losing radio sta­tions and turn them around. 
POWAY, Calif. (AP) -Kris Monaghan shot a 4-under-par 67 Sunday for a two-stroke vic­tory in the $300,000 Red Robin Kyocera Inamori Classic, her first victory in six years on the LPGA Tour. 
Monaghan, whose round in­cluded six birdies and two bo­geys, posted scores of 72-6 7­70-67 and finished at 8-under 276 over the 6,024-yard StoneRidge Country Club course. She earned $45,000. 
Cathy Gerring finished second at 278 and collected $27,750. Tied for third at 279 were two­time champion Avako Okamoto 


He purchased KPWR-FM in Los Angeles for $12 million and turned the moribund station into the No. 1 FM station in the Los Angeles broadcasting mar­ket. It now is worth more than $100 million, industry analysts say. 
Smulyan bought the Mariners for $76 million last October from George Argyros, a Southern California land devel­oper who owned the American League franchise for nine sea­sons. 
It was an uncharacteristic Smulyan deal. Because of major league baseball's rules govern­ing ownership, the Mariners purchase had to be financed mainly with cash. 
The largest share of the team eventually will be owned by Emmis. Emmis is trying to sell as many as three radio stations to finance the purchase. 
For the time being, however, Emmis doesn't own any portion of the team. Instead, it is owned by Smulyan, Indianapolis developer Michael Browning and New York in­vestment bank Morgan Stanley. 
Stanley owns 26 percent and Browning owns 10 percent. Smulyan owns the rest of the franchise, thanks to a $30 mil­lion line of credit from Security Pacific Bank and a $40 million "bridge loan" from Stanley. 
The bridge loan is intended to bridge the gap between last fall's purchase of the franchise and the time Emmis sells enough radio stations to buy about 54 percent of the fran­chise from Smulyan. 
Smulyan says he has always

Third-round leader Nancy Brown duplicated her final-day collapse in this tournament last year with a 76, finishing tied for seventh at 281. Last year, Brown took a two-shot lead into the final round but shot 78 to finish in a 17th-place tie. 
Monaghan, whose best previ­ous finish was fourth in the 1986 Safeco Classic, started the day four shots out of the lead. But she birdied the fifth, sixth,

been a buyer. not a seller. 
"The hardest part of this whole thing was selling any­thing," he said. "Can we afford to keep all the radio stations and the ball club? No." 
When Argyros ran the Mariners, he spent as little as possible. The Mariners made money for Argyros but lost on the field. In 13 years, they've never had a winning season. Argyros bought the Mariners for $13 million in 1981. 
Smulyan has a different phi­losophy from Argyros. He be­lieves it takes a lot of money to make a lot of money. He's spending money in Seattle. 
During the off season, he signed free agent Pete O'Brien to a five-year contract for $7.6 million. 
The Mariners will take in more than $32 million this sea­son, up about $7 million from last year, The Seattle Times re­ported. 
But players' salaries are climbing fast, too. 
"It doesn't take a rocket sci­entist to figure out our payroll last year was about $8 million and it'll be about $13 and a half million this year, so easy come, easy go," Smulyan told the Times. "We've also in­creased our marketing budget, we've increased the size of our staff, we've added a farm team, we've added some scouts." 
He added: 

"I've seen it in the radio busi­ness where a guy says, 'Look, rising tides raise all ships.' He buys a radio station, it's 25th (in its market). The market grows, he holds his 25th posi­
three-shot lead at the turn. 
A birdie at the 385-yard 11th was negated by a bogey two holes later, but Monaghan re­gained her momentum by mak­ing a six-foot putt for par at No. 14, then sinking a bunker shot from about 50 feet for birdie on the par-4 15th. 
She three-putted No. 18, a 173-yard par-3, but the rest of the field was too far back by then. 
Gerring, a six-year tour vet­eran who started the day tied with Monaghan four shots back, birdied the 14th and 15th

Okamoto birdied the first seven holes then birdied the par-4 eighth and ninth holes to make the turn at S-under, three strokes behind Monaghan. 
She never got any closer, however, making bogey at the par-4 11th and a birdie at the par-5 17th in matching par 36 on the back nine. 
Brown, seeking her first win in six years on the tour, double bogeyed Nos. 8 and 9 to drop

Jets fly past Oilers~with late goal 
Hawerchuk's tally helps VVinnipeg regain lead in series 
WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) ­Dale llawerchuk scored with less than five minutes remain­ing to give the Winnipeg Jets a 2-1' victory over the Edmonton Oilers Sunday night and a 2-1 lead in their Smythe Division semifinal series. 
The veteran Jets' center scored his third goal of the playoffs at 15:30 of the third period, snaring an errant clearing pass in the Oilers' zone and whipping a 20-foot screP.ned wrist shot past Oilers goaltender Bill Hanford. 
Tlw Jets outshot Edmonton 
30-16 but had trouble beating 
Hanford, whoso play was spec­
tacular. 

Hanford, making his third straight playoff appearancP. de­spite a shaky start in the opP.n­ing game, was outstanding, stopping Doug Smail with a sliding kick save on a break­away and later diving in front of Pat Elynuik's rebound shot in the opening period.

(AP) -Martina Navratilova won the battle of tennis' old and new generations Sunday, beating eighth-grader Jennifer Capriati 6-2, 6-4 to win the Family Circle Cup. 
It was the 150th career sin­gles win for the 33-year-old Navratilova, who won seven of those tournaments before her 14-year-old opponent was born. 
Navratilova won the match at the net and by using her serve­and-volley attack on the green clay at the Sea Pines Racquet Club. 
Capriati, who was just 2 years old when Navratilova earned her first Grand Slam ti-tie in 1978, struggled with her serve and rushed her shots when Navratilova came to the net. 
Capriati was playing in just her third tournament since turning pro last month. She is now 13-3 and her loss to Navratilova, ranked second in the world, makes her 3-2 against players in the top 10. 

Faldo

the last four holes. 
All of that he accomplished. 
He came back from the po­tential devastation of the first­hole double bogey, climbed back into contention and caught the front-running Floyd on the 17th hole. 
Both finished regulation play at 10-under-par 278. Floyd had a closing round of par 72. Faldo displayed enormous pa­tience and perseverance in a comeback 69. 
On the first playoff hole, the lOth at Augusta National, Faldo put his apprnach into a bunker on the right and Floyd threw his some 15 feet below the cup. 
Faldo's excellent sand shot 
came out some three feet below 
the cup. When Floyd left his 
birdie putt short, Faldo calmly 
rapped in his shorter effort and 
they went on to the 11th. 
From the fairway, Floyd ag­
gressively attacked the flag, 
tucked on the left near a pond. 
lie pulled it. Just a bit. Just 
enough. 
Water splashed. In effect, it 
was over. 
Faldo went through the for­
mality of playing his second 
safely to the green. After Floyd 
dropped and pitched short, 
Faldo two-putted for the win­
ning par. 
"I made history today," he 
said. 
He also renewed the 
Europeans' claim to world golf 
superiority, a claim supported 
by their 1985 and '87 Ryder 
Cup victories and a cup-retain­
ing tie last year. And by the fact 
they have won six of the last 11 
Masters. 
And chilly water of the 11th­
hole pond, along with Faldo's 
undeniable rally, shattered the 
lovely mood of nostalgia that 
prevailed until the very end. 
For more than two days, 
Floyd and Nicklaus, 97 years in 
combined age and with a 
Masters history covering 58 
appearances, treated the enor­
mous gallery to the spectacle of 
old heroes doing the old things 
in the old places. 
But the treat didn't last quite 
three days. 
In the end, just as the sunlight 
began to fade in the Georgia 
pines, so too did the old heroes.

now be 25th when she receives her first world ranking on Monday, having now played the required three tournaments. 
Navratilova, who has now won four Family Circle titles, earned $100,000 and a Mazda Miati. Capriati took home $40,000 -more than she has earned so far in her career. 
Capriati struggled for all but one game on her serve. She faced break points in three of her four service games in the first set. In the second set, Capriati faced break points in all but one of her five service games. 
Although she got in just over half her first serves, the top­seeded Navratilova faeed just three break points all day in running her match record this year to 21-1. 
Navratilova had two break points against Capriati in the first game and led 30-0 in the third game. Each time, Capriati managed to hold serve. But Navratilova went uo a break in the fifth game when she hit a 
First, it was Nicklaus, the best of them all, holder of six Masters crowns and 18 major titles overall. 
Now 50, he tried to use a re­juvenating victory in his first start on the Seniors Tour a week ago as the springboard back to his youth. 
It almost worked. At one point on the front side, he shared second place. 
Could he make it happen? 

Nicklaus tried. He tried mightily. But the shots didn't quite come off. The putts just missed. He couldn't make up ground. On the back side, with the holes running out and Floyd's lead growing, he began to gamble. 
And he paid the price. Nicklaus bogeyed three of four holes and three-putted for par on the other, a string that sent him spiraling back into the pack. 
The three-putt par on 15 
could not return. 
Capriati had a chance to get the break back in the following game, but Navratilova slammed two straight service winners and hit a forehand down the line to go up 4-2. Navratilova broke Capriati in the next game and then held serve at love to win the set. 
Capriati continued to struggle with her serve in the second game, but she managed to avoid a break in the first game. She was not as lucky in the third game, sending a forehand wide to go down a break. 
Navratilova had a service winner on her second serve in the next game to wipe out a break point and held her serve to go up 4-2. She had a chance to break Capriati and win the match two games later, but Capriati rifled a cross-court backhand at the net to delay the inevitable. 
Navratilova won the match with a forehand that landed on the tape near the servir.P. linP

when he did so. He made the par putt that kept him in front, barely. 
On the 17th, though, that smile disappeared. After Faldo made par,. Floyd again found himself with a long, breaking, up-and-down putt. This time he three-putted, missing a six-foot second putt. 
Now they were tied. 
After Faldo parred the 18th, the pressure was on Floyd to force the playoff. He drove into a deep fairway bunker on the left. From there, he hit into a greenside bunker on the right. 
He got it up and down for the par he had to have, setting up the third playoff in the last four years. 

But it only prolonged things. 
"The shot on the 11th was in the water the moment it left my club," he said. "It's the most devastating thing that has hap­pened to me in golf. 
"I've lost before, but never like this. I've never had any­thing affect me like this. I've never felt like this." 
Lanny Wadkins and .John Huston tied for third at 283, five shots out of the playoff. Wadkins eame from far back with a 68, but was not a title threat. Huston, who started the day only two strokes back, took himself out of it with a 40 on the front nine and finished with a 75.

Frosh lead the way for Irish in weekend sweep of Flyers 
By SCOTT BRUTOCAO 
Assistant Sports Editor 
The Notre Dame baseball team relied on freshman pitch­ing and a dramatic comeback victory in the final contest to sweep a four-game series with Midwestern Collegiate Conference opponent Dayton over the weekend at Jake Kline Field, improving its record to 17-5. 
The freshmen pitchers shut down the Flyers, picking up all four victories. David Sinnes and Pat Leahy won their games on

Saturday by respective scores of 11-3 and 6-4, while Alan Walania and Sinnes improved their records on Sunday in 7-1 and 10-9 victories. The Irish seemed to do every­thing right over the weekend, even when they found them­selves down 9-0 in the fifth in­ning of Sunday's second gamf). In that contest, Dayton scored nine runs in the first four in­nings and the Irish countered with 10 runs in the final four. "We've proven that we could score runs when we've had to," said Irish coach Pat Murphy, who watched his team score six runs in the fifth;' one in the sixth and three in the eighth in

laCrOSse team falls despite gtreat defense 



By ANTHONY KING 
Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame lacrosse team fell to an opportunistic Denison team 7-6, on Saturday at Moose Krause Stadium. The Irish defense held the high scoring Big Red to single digits, but never was able to overcome an early deficit. 
The Irish, now 6-4, were led 

, by senior attackman Brian McHugh who,~scored three goals and raised his career point total to 98. But the Irish offense couldn't convert on man-ups, going 0 for 3. "We out played them, but we didn't outscore them," said Irish Coach Kevin Corrigan. "We had a lot of shots, but we couldn't complete them." Another slow start plagued the Irish, as Denison quickly 
the nightcap on Sunday. "We 
shouldn't have been nine runs 
behind. We had one inning that 
really hurt us, but we really hit 
in the clutch." 
The one inning that set the 
Irish back was the Dayton sec­
ond, when sophomore starter 
Joe Binkiewicz allowed six runs 
to cross the plate. Freshman 
lefthander Chad Hartvigson re­
placed him, only to allow three 
more runs in the next two in­
nings. 
After the fourth, it was all 
Notre Dame. Sinnes relieved Hartvigson and extinguished the Flyers' fire, allowing only . two hits in the final five in­nings. The Irish bats then seemed to awake from a four­inning slumber, exploding for 
six runs in the fifth. 
With the bases loaded, Craig Counsell drew a walk that scored Cory Mee. Junior Frank .;acobs followed with a single, scoring Mike Coss and Dan Bautch. Counsell came home on an Ed Lund sacrifice fly, and Eric Danapilis delivered the fi­nal blow of the inning by smashing a line-drive home run over the left field fence, making the score 9-6. 
After a solo home run by Binkiewicz in the sixth, pinch-


Brian McHugh 

jumped out to a two goal lead. The Irish battled -back with a goal by Mike Sullivan on a pin­point P_l;I.SS from co-captain Dave Carey to close the first quarter. McHugh scored the game tying goal at 7:30 in the second period. 
Denison then pulled away With. four unanswere~ goals,
one m the second penod and 
three in the third. But after the 
Big Red scored their sixth goal, 
attackman McHugh pulled the 
Irish back. He scored twice in 
the third, to bring the score to 
6-4. Junior Mike Sennett then 
closed the gap to one with a 
goal in the fourth period. 
A critical miscue allowed 
Denison middy Scott Harrison 
to score on a breakaway with 
36 seconds left in the game. 
The Irish tried to pull off the 
impossible as Carey scored with 
15 seconds left, but it was too 
little, too late. 

Notre Dame's tournament hopes lie in the next five games, with key match-ups against Ohio State and Michigan State. The Irish host Lake Forest to­morrow at Moose Krause, game time is 3 p.m.

Dropped passes mark scrimmage 

By FRANK PASTOR 
Associate Sports Editor 
On his first pass attempt in Friday's in­trasquad scrimmage in Notre Dame Stadium, sophomore-to-be Rick Mirer dropped back, spotted sophomore split end Hay Griggs streak­ing down the right sideline and launched a bomb into his outstretched hands. 
Griggs dropped the football. 
He was not the only Irish receiver who had trouble catching the ball in Friday's cold weather. Senior split end Ricky Watters and ju­nior tight end Irv Smith also dropped the first balls thrown in their direction, which just hap­pened to be Mirer's next two attempts. Even ju­nior tight end Derek Brown, known for his good hands, dropped a pass later in the scrimmage. 
"Our concentration by our wide receivers was not very good today," Notre Dame head coach Lou Holtz said. "We made some mental errors. We're still a football team trying to find its identity." 
Part of that discovery process includes set­tling into an offensive system compatible with the talents of its two young quarterbacks. If Friday's scrimmage is any _indication, Notre Dame is still primarily a running team. 
The Irish rushed 55 times in the scrimmage for 1 77 yards, while passing 29 times for an identical 177 yards. Nowhere was this emphasis on the running game more ,pronounced than. in quarterback Jake Kelchner s final game statis­

Kelchner completed five-of-nine passes for 41 yards, but his 12 carries led all offensive backs. He picked up 27 yards on the ground during an impressive 60-yard scoring drive against the first-tfmm defense, punctuated by an eight-yard touchdown run up the middle on a quarterback draw. 
"Kelchner is a great competitor," said Holtz. ''I'm really impressed with his development and ability to take charge." 
Ironically, Kelchner amassed a total of only 18 yards rushing for the scrimmage as inconsistent pass protection often forced him out of the pocket. The offensive line gave up seven sacks for minus-30 yards on the day. 
"We have a ways to go on the offensive line," said Holtz. "We have got to be a unit, and we aren't right now. 
"But this offensive line, Coach (Joe) Moore tells me, will be a good one, and Coach Moore doesn't lie." 
Mirer completed 8-of-20 passes for 136 yards, numbers that are misleading considering the number of dropped passes. He answered Kelchner's touchdown run with a four-yard touchdown pass on the next series by scram­bling to his right and finding Griggs in the corner or the end zone. 
"Rick made some great plays," said Holtz. "These younger quarterbacks are starting to take charge. I see it more each time we go into
