Rifleman kills 14 and wounds 12 in Montreal 
MONTREAL (AP) -A young rifleman invaded the University of Montreal engineering school on Wednesday and singled out females for his targets, killing 14 women and wounding 12 people before committing sui­cide, police said. 
Montreal Police Director Claude St. Laurent said the killer, clad in a hunting outfit, rushed into a packed classroom on the second floor and yelled in French, "You're all a bunch of feminists!" before beginning his murderous rampage. 
Witnesses said the man di­vided the students in the class­room by sex and sent the men into the corridor before open­ing fire on the women. 
Six women were shot dead in that room, and a seventh in an­other room. Then the man, car­rying what looked like a .22 
caliber rifle, left in search of more victims, St. Laurent said. 
The gunman prowled the halls, killing three women in the cafeteria and four more women in the corridor of the third floor, where he then shot him­self. 
One police officer called to the scene found his daughter was among the dead. 
St. Laurent at one point told reporters police were looking for two accomplices but said later he was mistaken and the man acted alone. 
"I saw the bodies of the peo­ple who were slain -they were all women," said Louis Courville, director of the engi­neering school, his voice shak­ing.

Aquino declares emergency state in Manila Wednesday 
MANILA, Philippines (AP) ­President Corazon Aquino de­clared a state of emergency Wednesday and evoked the "people power" revolution in appealing for support against mutinous soldiers bent on over­throwing her government. 
"I am telling you now that I have put so much at stake for democracy: I have lost my hus­band," Mrs. Aquino said in a nationally televised address, appearing tired on the sixth day of an attempted coup. 
"Why did I become pn~sident? It was because you believed in me. and in spite of all of the coup attempts. you have stuck by me" against enemies who want "to kill me ... so that they can rule our land," she said. 
Mrs. Aquino's husband, Be­nigno Aquino Jr., was slain in 1983 as he arrived from self-imposed exile in the United States to challenge President Ferdinand Marcos. She took his place as the opposition presi­dential candidate and was swept into office in February 1986 by a civilian-military uprising. 
After her speech Wednesday, the government announced that Mrs. Aquino had proclaimed a national state of emergency, giving her broad powers to cope with the rebellion launched Friday by thousands of soldiers. 
On Wednesday, rebels still held parts of the Makati finan­cial district in Manila and the Mactan Air Base in Cebu, 350 miles south the capital. At least 79 people have been reported killed and more than 570 wounded since Friday. 
The emergency declaration came after a cease-fire ar­ranged by rebel and loyalist forces so about 1,800 foreign­ers, including about 250 Ameri­cans, could be evacuated from Makati, scene of heavy fighting since Saturday. 
In Washington, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater 


Salvadorian plane destroyed 
SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador lAP)­Leftist guerrillas shot down a military observation plane, and scattered lighting killed live rebels and two gov­ernment soldiers, the army said Wednesday. 
The 0-2 observation plane was shot down by rebel rifle fire Tuesday near the town of Ozatlan, 88 miles southeast of the capital, killing the pilot, the army said. 
The rebel clandestine Radio Venceremos said the plane -the second downed in the past month ­was shot down as it was firing rockets at rebel position. 
An A-37 jet fighter-bomber was similarly shot down by the rebels Nov. 18 in the eastern province of San Miguel. 
The Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front broadcast said the rebels have damaged 23 government aircraft during a new offensive they launched Nov. 11, but the claim could not be independently verified and military sources refused to confirm or deny it. 
30 Notre Dame women visit SMC 
By ALISSA MURPHY 
News Writer 
Approximately 30 sophomore Notre Dame women attended a get­acquainted dinner at Saint Mary"s on Tuesday and Wednesday this week. 
The dinner took place at Saint Mary's dining hall and provided an opportunity for a social exchange between Notre Dame and Saint Mary"s women. On Wednesday night the Notre Dame women were taken on a brief tour of the campus. 
"An Impression of St. Mary's," was the theme of an invitation to all sopho­more Notre Dame women to dine and experience life at Saint Mary's. 
The Saint Mary's sophomore student government board described the event as an effort to break some of the nega­tive stereotypes between schools by inviting Notre Dame women to dinner and giving them the opportunity to visit the campus. 
Wendy Garret. vice-president of the St. Mary's sophomore class, described the event as "giving both St. Mary's and Notre Dame women an opportunity to interact and the first step in trying to break the barriers". 
Earlier this week board members vis­ited the Notre Dame dorms inviting sophomores to visit campus. 
Liz Tootley, the sophomore represen­tative for Walsh stated, "I thought it was a great idea, I only wish that more Notre Dame girls had taken the oppor­tunity to do it." 
The Saint Mary's sophomore board has been discussing plans for another activity with the Notre Dame women to occur next semester, with the possibility of a lecture pertinent to women. 
said the the U.S. Embassy "is working to help these individu­als with their travel plans." He said the evacuation was man­aged without incident, and "all Americans were reported safe and we have no reports of in­juries." 
Rebel leaders, angered by 
U.S. military support for Mrs. Aquino, said Tuesday some Americans might be held, and on Wednesday threatened those who remain in the country. 
After the evacuation, rebel and army representatives be­gan talks on ending the rebel­lion. Sporadic sniping resumed, but the cease-fire generally held through the day. 
It was unclear what new powers Mrs. Aquino would have. Cabinet officials insisted personal liberties would not be curtailed, but said special pow­ers were needed to deal with the economic and social crisis caused by the coup. 
Public confidence has been shaken far more than by any of the five other coup attempts. 
Jose Fernandez, governor of the Central Bank, said Wednes­day two billion pesos ($91 mil­lion) had been withdrawn in runs on Manila banks in the past two days and many parts of the archipelago had cash shortages because domestic air service had been suspended.

Careful readers are aware of world events 

golden opportunity to expand our world, but often we only read the comics and toss them away. 
Newspapers and news magazines come to our doors every 
day with all the 
information to put us Liz Panzica in touch with events, Business Editor but we are somehow--------­too busy expanding our educational horizons on Aristotle to take a couple minutes to read it. By neglecting current events we are forgetting the very reason we are in school. 
Education gives us the tools and ability to 
piece together the events around us in an 
intelligent manner. Teachers aren't here to 
tell us exactly what happened and 
newspapers don't clearly lay out why things 
happen. 
As educated adults it is up to us to take 
the information around us and draw our 
own conclusions. We can't do that without 
media or education. The two go hand in 
hand. 
It is not a coincidence that The Wall 
Street Journal, The New York Times, 
Newsweek magazine and the likes offer 
student rates. These publications are 
creating their future market. Don't think 
the discount is out of charity. No, the big 
boys know better. Reading habits formed in 
college follow us through life. 
Students often feel as if they don't have time to be informed right now, but when they get out of college they will have the time to read the paper every morning. That is a very unlikely scenario. If we are lazy now, we will never get motivated. There is no excuse for a student at a nationally acclaimed university to be ignorant of current affairs. 
Television does a great job bringing a little information to a lot of people. A six­second blip on a television screen, however, doesn't make one enlightened. Television should really just give the base and newspapers and magazines can fill in the details. Yet most of America is content to let the tube do it all. 
Newspapers, magazines and TV should not be considered completely objective. People write for the media and try as they might to avoid it, they cannot be totally without biases. When reading, it's admirable to be skeptical, but never indifferent. 
But an educated populace, as a campus should be, ought to be able to sort through everything the media brings it. Knowledge doesn't come only from a textbook. 
Newspapers always give background on an occurrence, if you read the stories to the end. If you stop at the third paragraph and skip to Calvin and Hobbes you're not going to find out how the chain of events got started. 
Only an avid newspaper reader would have made it this far, so go ahead, you deserve it -turn to Calvin and Hobbes.

SMC board discusses hall chapel renovation 
By COLLEEN TRAVERS 
News Writer 
The possibility of celebrating mass again following chapel renovations in Le Mans Hall was discussed at Wednesday's Saint Mary's Board of Gover­nance meeting. 
Henovations of the chapel are currently underway and will be completed by the end of Febru­ary. 
Generally, students' reactions have bem1 supportive to the prospect of mass being held there. Some students feel that it is the only traditional chapel on campus and should be used not only for mass but also as a place for quiet reflection, said board members. 
However, according to board 
member Amy Hushin, Campus

Ministry is less than enthusias­tic about the idea. "They really don't want mass there at all," she said. 
Saint Mary's Campus Ministry claims that the space is too long and narrow. "It is very hard to get priests to do mass there,"said Rushin. 
Campus Ministry stressed that nothing has been decided and further discussions will be underway, Hushin added. 
Also discussed were plans for the Wellness Program, which will deal with promoting better health of the mind, body, and spirit. It has not yet been de­cided where the Wellness center will be located. Some possibili­ties suggested were the Haggar College Center or the Hegina Hall basement.

The ruling Sandinista paper also said Wednesday that El Salvador will be "fanning the fire" of its 1 0-year-old civil war unless it finds a negotiated so­lution. Leftist rebels in that country are battling a U.S.­baeked right-wing government. 
The editorial in Barricada re­flected a sentiment, expressed in private conversations by government and party officials, that Nicaragua has been fulfill­ing its part of regional peace pacts, while other countries have not.

It said Honduras' president­elect, Rafael Leonardo Callejas, already was feeling pressure from Hondurans to oust the Contras. The editorial praised Callejas, saying he was echoing Nicaragua's call for disbanding the Contras.

Palestinian barred from West Bank 
.JERUSALEM (AP) -The leading spokesman for Pales­tinians was barred Wednesday from entering the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and Israeli De­fense Minister Yitzhak Rabin said the Arab uprising might last another two years. 
Troops opened fire in the West Bank town of Nablus to disperse demonstrators, wounding eight Palestinians, hospital officials said. Six Arabs were shot by troops in stone-throwing clashes in Gaza, they said. 
The army imposed a curfew that will confine Gaza's 750,000 residents to their homes beginning Thursday to head off possible protests Fri­day, when the uprising enters its third year. A similar curfew was expected for the West Bank. 
Soldiers also demolished three houses of Palestinians suspected in attacks on Israeli soldiers and civilians. 
Palestinian spokesman Faisal Husseini, who lives in the Arab sector of Jerusalem annexed by Israel, was banned by the army from entering the occupied ter­ritories for six months. He ac­cused authorities of trying to increase tension among Pales­tinians in the occupied territo­ries. 

The army orders said the travel ban against Husseini, 49, was taken "for the sake of en­suring public peace, the defense of the area and the establish­ment of public order." 
A military official said Hus­setm was involved in "incitement against the author­ities, against the army." The official. who insisted on anonymity, gave no details. 
Husseini, a pro-PLO activist, was released from prison in January after being held for 18 months without charge or trial. 
35 killed in Bogota truck bomb incident 
BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -A truck bomb containing half a ton of dynamite exploded out­side secret police headquarters during the morning rush hour Wednesday, killing at least 35 people and wounding hundreds. 
The bomb, presumably the work of drug gangs, was the most powerful to strike the capital since Colombia's cocaine traffickers began a wave of terror after the government declared war on them 16 weeks ago. 
A spokesman for President Virgilio Barco said the bombing might be the start of a new campaign of mass killings by the drug traffickers, but that the government would fight on. 
The blast, which tore open a crater 20 feet deep and de­stroyed or heavily damaged a score of buildings, occurred less than 24 hours after gov­ernment investigators said a bomb caused the crash of a Colombian jetliner last month that killed 107 people. 
No one claimed responsibility directly for Wednesday's explo­sion, but Gen. Faruk Yanine, Bogota police chief, said it was undoubtedly the work of drug traffickers. 
A statement from the so­called Extraditables delivered to newspapers and radio sta­tions in Medellin, base of the most powerful drug cartel, said: "We will stop the war only when the Senate understands the people must be our judge." 
The reference was to a bill that would permit a national referendum on extraditing drug trafficking suspects wanted in the United States. The House of Representatives approved it Tuesday night. 
Barco's government opposes 
the measure, contending the 
drug barons would step up ter­
rorism before a referendum to 
frighten voters into rejecting 
extradition. 
In their statement, the Ex­
traditables said: "The president 
should not fear what the 
congress decides, because the 
congress is the voice of the 
people, and the voice of the 
people is the voice of God." 
Minister of Government Car­los Lemos Simmonds told re­porters after the bombing: "The slaughter that we warned of when the House approved extradition in the plebiscite has started." He is acting president while President Virgilio Barco is on a state visit to Japan. 
The bomb went off at 7:30 
a.m. in an area crowded with people bound for work on foot and in cars. 
So powerful was the explo­sion that it broke windows in a building across the street from the U.S. Embassy seven miles away. The broadcast network Caracol quoted sources with explosives experts at the scene as saying the truck was packed with 1,100 pounds of dynamite. 
Reports on the number of dead and wounded varied, and rescuers were pulling bodies from the rubble of buildings hours after the blast. 
Health Minister Eduardo Diaz said in an interview with Cara­col that at least 35 people were killed, 250 seriously wounded and 750 treated for cuts, abra­sions, shock and shock. Uncon­firmed reports gave higher death tolls.

shook," said student Vanthona Ouy, 22. 
Witnesses told police the gunman entered the classroom at about 5:20 p.m. 
Students said the man emerged from the classroom, fired three or four shots at a group of people and ran up a flight of stairs. 
Student Francois Bordeleau said he had to drag people by the collar to keep them from going in the man's direction. 
He said he heard 20 to 30 shots and the man appeared to be aiming mainly at women. 
"I heard the gunman say: 'I want the women,"' said Borde­leau. 
Several other witnesses con­firmed that the gunman said that. 
Student Eric Chavarie said the gunman "told us to stop ev­erything. And then when we looked at him we thought it was a joke, but he fired a shot in the air and separated us into two groups, the guys in one 
corner  and  the  girls  in

Students learn about global market in Europe 
By Mike Kolar Busmess Wnter 
In today's business world, there is much talk of the orientation toward a global markr!tplace, as well as the impact of the birth of the Europr!an Economic Community in 1992. 
In this changing environment, a global awareness, and an increased r!mphasis on international business education is important to students planning to enter the corporate world upon graduation. 
At Notre Damn, one way of obtaining a morf! global business perspective is the European Business Smninar. 
Approximately three wneks in length, this summer program allows students to travel to some of Europe's greatest cities and sights, and to visit many well known rompaniPs engaged in business in Europe. Since it was first offnred at Notre Dame in the summer of 1988. the program has grown in popularity under the direction of Terry Clark, Assistant Professor of Marketing. 
While the logistics of travel. hotel accommodations, and seminar activities are handled by International Business Seminars, Notre Dame arranges its own preparation and course work before the seminar. The course work involves weekly classes, as well as a major test and paper. Through the seminar program, students are eligible

The 1989 seminar included visits to London, Paris, Lyon. Nice, Monte Carlo, Geneva, Cologne, Stuttgart, and Amsterdam, with all of the transportation on the continent being by motor coach. During their travel, the participants had ample free time to shop, sight see, and acquaint themselves with the local culture and people. 
The major benefits of the trip, however, lie in the education received in visiting with the men and women who are engaged in international business, and hearing their views on the issues facing their respective entities. 
Last year's participants visited such well known corporations as Price Waterhouse, Steinway & Sons, Cadbury, and Mercedes-Benz, in addition to the British Banker's Association and the ADN Bank. At each of these, the group was very well received, and heard top executives address the issues important to their companies, the European market as a whole, and the coming changes in 1992. 
In addition to the education received, many participants find that prospective employers are impressed by their seminar experience. Senior Megan

LETTERS 
Women presiders do not diminish 'Catholic character' 
Dear Editor: 
The understandable alien­ation of millions of faithful Catholic women deserves a thoughtful response. The Pope's own Biblical Commission could find no reason for ex-eluding women from the priest­hood; neither could the Catholic Theological Society of America. 
 
Women in the Church concluded that the exclusion of women from ordination is the most blatant example of "anti-femi­nine bias" in Church law. 
While many parishes throughout the world must cope with priestless Sundays, the Notre Dame community eel­ebrates thousands of masses each year. We very modestly request that one occasion 


set aside for a service in which women can be full presiders. · 
Will forgoing -one Mass among the thousands dilute Notre Dame's Catholic identity. as Fred Freddoso facetiously implies in his letter to the editor (The Observer, Nov. 21)? Can Fred Freddoso seriously sug­gest that opening the school year with a non-Eucharistic ~rvice of the Word will start us down the slippery slope to-women's ordination as wards Brown and Yale's god-"schismatic." less secularism? My proposal that we substi­

It is sadly ironic that the Clark Power featured editorial in the new Associate Professor magazine Dialogue, refers to Program of Liberal Studies the campus discussion of Dec. 1, 1989 
Considering the plight of St. Michael's Laundry workers 
Dear Editor: 
I am disturbed as to what was not said or was inadver­tently omitted by The Observer as to the tragic loss of St. Michael's Laundry a few weeks ago. 
The Canon Law Society's Committee on the Status of 
St. Miehael's Laundry was a precious landmark to many of us here on the campus, past and present. It was unique in so 
DOONESBURY 
many ways, as were the won­derful dedicated men, women and Holy Cross Sisters who la­bored there throughout the decades. These dedicated people have made a unique contri­bution to this University, the students, faculty and Holy Cross priests, brothers and sis­ters. 
Our debt to these employees past and present is infinite. 

Vandalism and leisurely strolls: Defacing Notre Dame 
Dear Editor: 
I was disturbed to read in The Observer (Dec. 1) that both the LaFortune Student Center and the Christmas tree at the corner of Notre Dame Avenue and Angela Boulevard were re­cently vandalized. Although there is apparently no com­pelling reason to believe that the LaFortune vandalism was done by Notre Dame students, the discovery of footprints leading from the Christmas tree back to campus suggests that some of our own are vandals. 
But whether the vandalism comes from "Benders" or "Domers," we should be outraged. What kind of per­sonal gratification vandals 
derived from deliberate defac­
ing of things that others find 
beautiful and enjoyable is sim­
ply my understanding. It illus­
trates yet again that some peo­
ple are not content simply to be 
immature. They insist on dis­
playing that immaturity for all 
the world to see. 
Another thing that disturbs me is the apparently acceptable defacing of our campus by countless people walking across lawns. I have had the opportunity to visit many col­lege campuses nationwide, and very few are as beautiful as ours. Yet so many people on the Notre Dame campus seem to­tally unconcerned about the de­structive consequences of their casual, repeated. leisurely straight-line strolls from their 
point of origin to their destina­tion. 
I do not believe this is imma­turity, but it is wanton can~­lessness. Such carelessness is unbecoming of an academic community that takes justifi­able pride not only in learning but in values, not so much in personal conv1~nience as in the rights and needs of others. Since we are about to begin a new year, perhaps we ean all resolve to use paved rather 
than grassy surfaces as our walkways, and to encourage our friends to do the same. 
Father Ronald Wasowski Associate Professor Department of Earth Sciences Dec. 4. 1989 

They went about their task of sorting soiled linen and sundry tasks with little or no thanks or recognition. No matter how much money is spent on re­building another laundry. you can never replace the unique beauty of what was lost. In my 40 years near and around this campus. I consider myself for­tunate in knowing so many of these totally dedieated people, and my life has been enriched 
fourfold by our mutual friend­
ship. 
Also, it is with much vexation 
of spirit that I take issue with 
Mr. Joe Zadronzny in his article 
"Fire Leaves Mark on Men's 
Fashion at ND," whieh ap­
peared in The Observer, Nov. 
28. I found his article rather silly, immature and unfeeling in light of losing our laundry and 
. the disruption of the lives of the employees who labored there. It could b1~ doubly trying for many because Christmas is so near. 
Mr. Zadrozny has inadver­tantly omitted the sadness and saf effeet on the lives of the laundry employees. May St. Miehanl come to our assistance in our loss.

Padres, Tribe finish deal; Mets, Reds trade closers 
NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) ­Joe Carter finally was traded and baseball's winter meetings finished with a flourish Wednesday as free agent Kent 
Hrbek  stayed  with  the  
Minnesota  Twins  while  Jeff  
Reardon left for Boston.  

Bill Gullickson returned from Japan to sign with Houston in the morning and the slower­than-usual meetings then hit full speed in late afternoon. 
In a deal of high-profile relief pitchers Wednesday night, the New York Mets dealt Randy Myers to the Cincinnati Reds for John Franco. 
With trade rumors circulating about Mike Greenwell, Von Hayes. Lee Smith and others big names, most teams planned to stay in town past the official ending. 
Cleveland and San Diego, which conditionally agreed to trade Carter on Monday night, finished their business soon be­fore the deadline to complete the deal. 
The Indians sent Carter, one of baseball's top hitters, to the Padres for catcher Sandy Alomar Jr., the minor league player of the year, plus Chris James and prospect Carlos Baerga. 
''I'm definitely relieved," Carter said from his home in Kansas. "I know San Diego is a good ballclub and it's a chance to compete on a contender." 
Carter, 29, hit 35 home runs -most for the Indians since Rocky Colavito's 42 in 1959 ­drove in 105 runs and batted .243. He averaged 31 homers and 108 RBls in the last four seasons with Cleveland. 
Carter was not signed for next year and indicated he would leave the Indians when 
he became eligible for free 
agency after the 1990 season. 
The Padres got permission to 
negotiate with Carter and were 
given until mid-afternoon to 
work out a deal. 
Carter got a three-year con­
tract worth $9.2 million, mak­
ing him the highest-paid posi­
tion player in baseball history. 
"The Padres answered all of 
our concerns positively and it 
was a situation that Joe really 
liked," Carter's agent, Jim 
Turner said. ''I'm glad everyone 
was able to get it done." 
So were the Padres. 
"Joe's numbers speak for 
themselves over the last few 
seasons," Padres manager and 
vice president Jack McKeon 
said. ''I'm sure we 'II find a 
place for him." 
Carter will play center field and join an offense that in-eludes Tony Gwynn and Jack 
Clark. 
Alomar, 23, was never able to 
break into the Padres' lineup 
because they already had All­
Star catcher Benito Santiago. 
Alomar hit .306 with 101 RBis 
at Class AAA Las Vegas last 
season and Indians general 
manager Hank Peters said, 
"We've already received three 
or four offers for him." 
Baerga, 21, is a switch-hit­ting third baseman who batted .275 with 74 RBis at Las Vegas. James, 27, hit .243 with 13 home runs and 65 HBis for Philadelphia and San Diego. 
The Twins, meanwhile, got a split with their high-priced free agents as Hrbek and Reardon each made hometown moves. 
llrbek got a five-year, $14 million contract to re-sign with Minnesota. Detroit and Seattle each offered about $15 million, but Hrbek, born and raised in 

the Twin Cities, turned them 
down. 

''I'm happy to be staying in 
Minnesota," Hrbek said. "Being 
at home was the determining 
factor." 

The Twins appreciated their 
first baseman's loyalty. 

''I'd like to thank Kent Hrbek 
for making a concession in dol­
lars," general manager Andy 
MacPhail said. "We're a small­
city market and only have a fi­
nite amount of resources avail­
able." 

Hrbek, 29, broke into the majors with Minnesota in 1981 and is a lifetime .290 hitter with 201 home runs and 724 RBis. Last season, lw hit .272 with 25 homers and 84 RB!s. 
Reardon, who led the majors with 264 saves in the 1980s, took a three-year, $6.8 million 
offl~r by Boston.

Syracuse nips Duke in Challenge contest 
LOUISVILLE, Ky. 
Everick Sullivan seored nine 
points as No. 11 Louisville 
opened with a 14-0 run and 
was never headed in beating 
Vanderbilt 101-75 
Wednesday night. 
It was the second straight 
time Louisville (5-1) hit the 
century mark, having beaten 
Cleveland State 104-77 on 
Monday. 
Sullivan, who scored 13 of 
his 20 points in the first half. 
hit two jump shots, a 3-point 
shot and a slam dunk during 
the opening spurt, which was 
capped by a Tony Kimbro 
free throw at the 14:1 7 
mark. 
Louisville's full-court 
pressure defense forced 
Vanderbilt (2-2) to miss its 
first eight shots and commit 
three turnovers before 
Derriek Wilcox broke the 
drought with a jumper from 
the top of the key with 13:55 
left in the half. 
Louisville then upped its 
advantage to 26-6 over the 
next three minutes on the 
strength of two 3-pointers 
from LaBradford Smith, who 
had 10 points in the half, one 
from Keith Williams and a 
three-point play from 
Cornelius Holden. 
Vanderbilt pulled within 11 
points three times, the last 
at :i8-27 at the 2:51 mark. 
before Louisville scored 10 
of the final 14 points in the 
half for a 48-31 lead at the 
break. 
Kansas 86, SMU 53 
DALLAS-Terry Brown hit four 3-pointers and scored 14 points to lead second­ranked Kansas to an 86-53 victory Wednesday night over badly-outshot Southern Methodist. 
Kansas (8-0) trailed only once as it had six players in double figures. Mark Handall, Pekka Markkanen, and Kevin Pritchard had 12 points apieee while Freeman West and Mike Maddox added 1 0 each. 
SMU (1-4) was led by Heginald Muhammad who had 13 points and Vernon Perdue, who chipped in with 10. 
Kansas outshot SMU 57 percent to 37 percent and outrebounded the Mustangs 33-28. 
Missouri 106,
Hawaii Loa 48 
COLUMBIA, Mo.-Fourth­
ranked Missouri shot a 
school-record 75 percent 
and Doug Smith scored 17 
points to lead five players in 
double figures as the Tigers 
beat NAJA member Hawaii 
Loa 106-48 Wednesday 
night. 
Missouri (6-0), which won 
its 20th straight home game, 
opened the game with a 23-4 
burst, led by Nathan 
Buntin's 13 points. The 
Tigers led 56-23 at halftime 
while shooting 83 pereent. 
The 75 percent for the game 
broke the record of 73 
percent against Iowa State 
in 1982. 
Michigan 100, 
Central Michigan 51 
ANN ARBOH, Mich. ­
Michigan led the nation in 
field goal percentage last 
season, hitting 56.6 percent 
of its shots en route to the 
national championship, and 
it appears the Wolverines 
are trying for that 
distinction again. 
The eighth-ranked 
Wolverines shot 80 pereent 
in the first half and 56 
percent overall en route to a 
100-51 victory over Central 
Miehigan on Wednesday 
night. 
"We got good shots and 
made them," Michigan coach 
Steve Fisher said. "It was a 
game that was a little easier 
than we thought it would 
be." 
Terry Mills scored all his 17 points in the first half, helping Michigan to a 53-24 halftime lead. Sean Higgins led the Wolverines with 18 points, Rumeal Robinson had 17 and Loy Vaught 12 as the Wolverines won their fourth straight after dropping their opening game. 
"They feel good about themselves," Fisher said of his starters. "They know they played well. They know they played hard. It's another step in the direction we want to go." 
Central Michigan, which is 1-14 against Michigan and has dropped the last 11 meetings, made only 19 of67 shots for 28.4 pereent, well below its season average of 47.6. 

Duran wants to end 'No mas' talk 
LAS VEGAS (AP) -Roberto 
Duran wears the pride of his 
accomplishments for everyone 
to see. He tries to cover his dis­
grace with a verbal blanket. 
That blanket, however, has 
grown ragged with use. 
Thursday night, outdoors at 
the Mirage, Duran, 38, will try 
to put a final bright patch on 
his crazy quilt career by beating 
Sugar Ray Leonard. 
"Hey, Sugar Hay Robinson 
(the late welterweight and mid­
dleweight champion) and 
Hoberto Duran are the two 
greatest fighters ever to step 
into a ring," Duran said. 
"I get tired of people asking 
me about New Orleans." 
In the eighth round at New Orleans Nov. 25, 1980, Duran, who had beaten Leonard on a close but unanimous decision in 15 rounds six months earlier at Montreal, waved his right fist in resignation and muttered, "No mas." 
"After the New Orleans fight, I won two more titles," Duran said. "I beat Davey Moore (for the World Boxing Association junior middleweight crown) and Iran Barkley (for the World Boxing Council middleweight championship), but all that people talk about is 'no mas.' " 
'The two words became part of boxing's lexicon. They were used in routines by late night television hosts and standup comics. 
Duran, who had ruled the lightweight division for eight years during the 1970s and was known as "Hands of Stone," was ridiculed as "Belly of Jelly." 
He claimed at the time he suf­fered stomach cramps. 
Now he says, 'Til tell the press after I beat Leonard why I quit." 
Leonard, 33, has said, "I think I just frustrated him." That is the generally accepted theory. 
Leonard, who had gone toe­to-toe with Duran at Montreal, used his speed and had Duran lunging and lurching at New Orleans. In the round before Duran surprisingly auit, Leonard taunted and mocked the king of machismo. 

APPhokJ 
Sugar Ray Leonard and Roberto Duran pose at a news conference promoting their fight for the WBC super middleweight championship. Leonard and Duran, who have split two previous meetings, will square 
off Thursday night at Las Vegas. 
The victory, however, was a 
hollow one for Leonard, whose 
pride has been fired by five 
world championships and his 
position as the premier fighter 
of the 1980s despite three re­
tirements. 
"I was never given credit for 
that," Leonard said. "I beat 
him fair and square. lie was 
the star. He got more play than 
I did. It was Duran's doing, not 
Ray's doing. That's what ticked 
me off. 
"That (Duran's act) robbed me of my accomplishment." Leonard is a 2-1 favorite to win the rubber match. 
There was no immediate rub­ber match because Leonard was afraid the public might view Duran's action as being calculated to set up a third fight. 
Then, Leonard retired for the first time in 1982 after retinal surgery on his left eye and Duran's career went into de­cline. Leonard has said he might not fight again after Thursday night, but that there will not be a retirement an­nouncement. 
"Nobody would believe me anyway," he said. 
Now that it's finally here, the rubber mateh is much bigger than it would have been had Leonard won a decision at New Orleans and if it had been held soon after that. 
"If it wouldn't have been for that bizarre ending, it wouldn't be this big," Leonard said. 
"This will be the biggest event in the history of boxing," pro­moter Bob Arum said. 
The scheduled 12-round match at a 16,:i05-seat stadium will begin about 7:40 p.m. PST and will be shown on pay-per­view and closed-cireuit televi­sion. 
Arum said 13 million homes will be available for pay-per­view TV at an average price of $32. 
The most homes available previously were nine million for the Leonard-Thomas Hearns fight June 12 and the biggest sales percentage was nine per­
eent for the Leonard-Marvelous Marvin Hagler match in 1987, according to Arum. 
The promoter said Leonard, who is guaranteed $15 million, could make as much as $21 million.

NEW YORK (AP) Mohammed "Moe" Elewonibi was minding his business, hav-· ing a little fun booting a soccer ball around on the campus of Snow Junior College in Ephraim, Utah, when the foot­ball coach wandered by, caught a glimpse of him and led him away. 
Two years later, the 6-foot-5, 
290-pounder found himself at 
Brigham Young University and 
Wednesday he was named win­
ner of the Outland Trophy as 
the best college lineman in 
America. 
Elewonibi beat out Morris "Moe" Gardner, junior nose tackle from Illinois and Michael Tanks, senior center from Florida State for the award presented by the Football Writers Association of America. He is BYU's second Outland winner in four years, following Jason Buck of the Cincinnati Bengals, who took the award in 1986. 
Elewonibi, a native of Nigeria who grew up in Kamloops, British Columbia, never played high school football. "I was small when I came to Canada," he said. "I wasn't even tall enough to play basketball." 
Soccer was his game but when he got to Snow JC, he found the sport limited to club status. "There were guys from the Middle East and Africa and

we played a little pickup soc­cer," he said. " But there were no other teams for us to play. We even played BYU once and lost 13-0." 
By then, though, he had grown large enough to try other things. So he had no hesi­tation about playing football. His first game was less than a rousing success, however, with Snow losing, 41-7. 
"I was emotional thinking about it, thinking if I did this or that," he said. ''I'm competitive by nature. I don't like to lose. I worked on my technique and my footwork and by the end of the season, I was as good as you can get in junior college."

continued from page 16 
in years before. It should be intriguing to see the results of the Joe Carter trade. I wonder how Carter could help a team he actually enjoys playing for, particularly a potential contender like San Diego (provided the Padres do not once again choose to start their season around late August). We also finally will realize whether Sandy Alomar is as good as everybody has been saying for the last couple of years. 
Boston seems to have made one of the biggest moves of all by signing Jeff Reardon. That should shore up the Red Sox bullpen woes, created when Lee Smith's career burned out faster than expected. It still remains to be seen whether the Sox will deal Mike Greenwell or Ellis Burks for some starting pitchers.
