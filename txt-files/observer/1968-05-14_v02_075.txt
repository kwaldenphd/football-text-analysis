Editor: 
I, like so many others on this campus, have been made a victim of the ruthless Establishment, and I feel that it is my civic responsibility to expose the cir­cumstances of my misfortune. I lost a shirt in the ND Laun­
dry and found, much to my dis­may, that that old lady at Door 3 not only took the fact that the Laundry had misplaced my 

shirt as a personal insult~ but that she just didn't even care! So, I have appealed to the Direc­tor for proper redress. I wrote him not because I felt that the loss of a three dollar shirt would break me financially or that it would ruin my career. To be sure, this loss places no real strain on my economy. I wrote him, rather, because of the antagon­istic way in which my case was handled. When I, the average un­suspecting Notre Dame Student, sent my bundle of belongings to those famed launderers on the banks of du Lac sometime ago, I had no idea that I might never see that shirt again. Now, I rea­. lize their system is highly so­phisticated and efficient, but somewhere, somehow, somebody screwed up. My shirt is missing and I know that these people do mis­place items occasionally, for I now have in my possession a washcloth owned by one James 
F. Swartz. I greatly sympathize with Mr. Swartz for I know the agony that must have attended the loss of his washcloth. (Mr. Swartz, you may pick up your 
washcloth in my room at any time) Mr. Swartz's problem is now solved; but my shirt is still 
at large, and I can only feel that the laundry service is responsible. I can't promise that if something is· not done about my shirt that the whole campus will rise up in rebellion and do dirty little things to t~e ND laundry; in fact, I really don't think that anybody really gives a damn about my shirt. Had it not been for the lowly attitude of that "nice laundry lady" at Door 3, I would have taken this loss very graciously. Now, I am an­
gered. Sincerely, 
Ed Kurtz 128 Keenan Hall 
Editor: Without going into the over­all concept of ROTC at this time, I would like to correct a serious factual error in Mr. Gal­lagher's May 10 column. In at­tempting to refute a statement by Air Force Lt. Col. John Abbott ("They want to uphold thcir rights but they are depriv­ing us of ours"), GallaghP,r states "...Air Force ROTC expels 
any of its students who get involved in anti-war or civil rights demonstrations. Free expression is dangerous." Had Mr. Gallagher taken the time to check on this, he would have been shown a notice which has been posted on the Air Force ROTC bul­
letin board since October 10. Signed by the Professor of Aero­
space Studies, Col. Victor J. Fer­rari, it says "It is the policy of the Air Force that while wearing the uniform, the person will not engage in any activity which would indicate approval or sanctioning of that activity 
by the U.S. Air Force. Exam­ples of such activities would be political rallies, civil rights mar­ches, student demonstrations, etc. This policy does not infringe on your rights to participate in these activities; however, if you do so, the uniform will not be worn." Robert E. Franken Chief, Information Division 225th AFROTC Cadet Wing 
Editor: Mr. Gallagher wrote: "At all events, wars are not fought with speeches but with guns and bombs." In a letter, Mr. Higgins wrote. "If so many of those ROTC students hate the war as you say, they have no business wearing their uniforms. Both of those statements re­flect an attitude that I believe to have several serious defects. First, war is an instrument of na­tional policy. The military imple­ments this policy under orders from its Commander-in-Chief who is elected by the people. If the people make a mistake and elect a man whom they later deem a poor choice, the solution does not lie in condemning the machinery that is ready to claim that the United States doesn't need an Army, it is inane to ac­cuse this Army of anything other than inefficiency. Secondly, one cannot say that a man who may "hate the war" should not enter the Army. Of course, the majority of Amer­icans-all of the same ones-hate 
war. However, realistically, many realize it is sometimes necessary. But even those who absolutely condemn our part in Vietnam should not try to use this as a basis for not joining ROTC. As I stated above, the military is a to9l of the government; it is no more logical to not join the Army because of its role in Vietnam than it is to refuse to run for the 
U.S. Senate because they over­whelmingly passed the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution (which ac­tually stated the escalation in Vietnam). If one is a pacifist, he can stay out of the Service, but if one simply opposes a particu­lar action of the Service, his condemnation of this action should be directed to the Admin­istration-not the military. 
Finally, I'd like to take a short look at what happens to those who do not join ROTC. If one is drafted after leaving Notre Dame, he can refuse to go-but very, very few do. Most of our campus "radicals" that talk and sign petitions and de­monstrate eventually go in the Service (as exemplified by our most renowned demonstrator of the last four years). Upon being 
inducted, the next choice is whe­ther or not to go to Officers Candidate School. Those that do have just taken a different route toward the same goal as ROTC students. Those that do not are evading the responsibility that their Intelligence and education places upon them. If one doesn't approve of the tactics the Army uses, a suitable method of influ­ence would be to raise himself to a position of command. 
In summary, I can only re­peat-in the United States, the military is a tool of the civilian government. Criticism leveled at the Services is pointless. 

Fred Torrisi 404 St. Edward's Hall 
Editor: 

When The Observer begins 
daily publication, with the in­creased workload there should come an increased realization of the responsibilities of your posi­tion. Mass media hold tremen­dous power over the direction of public opinion and with that power comes a very cogent re­sponsibility. That is, that the ex­
ercise of that power should occur 
only through the employment 
of the truth and that the truth 
may not be distorted nor perver­
ted in any way to satisfy a par­
ticular argument. 

As Editor-in-Chief of this 
newspaper, it is obvious that you 
have done little to discharge that 

responsibility. The Observer's 
consistent disdain for that part 
of the truth which does not 
please it is notorious, and in your 
short tenure there has been no 
evidence of an attempt to correct 
this situation. 
Had you done this, Mr. Gal­lagher's statement that "Air Force ROTC expels any of its students who get involved in anti­war or civil rights demonstra­tions" might never have been published. Also, had he been working unde:r such a directive, Mr. Gallagher would have found that the political activities of ROTC cadets are unrestricted so long ~s they occur on the cadet's free time and he is out of uni­form. Very truly yours,

understood the reason behind the request. Chairman Mac is 
either terribly stupid (which he is not), or preferred to evade the 
question, to put it sweetly. 
Lawyers were called in by the committee to resolve the ques­tion of whetherlndiana's lascivious conduct law could be applied to the University. No one could decide whether Du Lac was a "boarding house, hotel or home that the owner knows is used for prostitution or immoral conduct," which would place it 
under the particular law. Fr. McCarragher commented, "Lawyers don't like hypothetical cases." Perhaps it should be brought to court and unhyportheticalized. Fr. McCarragher obviously finds 
any type of case distasteful. 
The most disappointing of all was the failure of the committee 
to consider any of the General Assembly bills. The committee's 
recommendations and modifications to the Board could have been 
very useful to the students' case. Instead, the corrnittee discussed 
three or four of the seven resolutions passed by the Assembly, almost as afterthoughts. No consideration was given to the impor­tant bills such as parietal hours or self-government. Admittedly, the bills were handed to the committee only a few weeks previous to the scheduled meeting with the Board, but no effort was made to call extra meetings. Evidently Fr. McCarragher decided the 
bill did not warrant extra consideration. 
McCarragher's own Sandbox (bigger and better than the Sen­ate ever dreamed of making theirs) is not the only offender. Fr. Riehle decided not to consult with Rossie on the demonstra­tions directive even though he said he believes students should have a voice in such affairs. After all, it was not the Administration's policy at the time and woe is he who attempts to consult the students. Well, it is supposed to be the policy now. 
Notice, too, that the four parietal hours violators were rein­stated by Fr. Hesburgh because of a "moral ambiguity" and not because they had been denied trial by the student judicial board which had been created for precisely such cases. 
Quite obviously, the Board of Trustees believes the students can handle responsibility and deserve a voice in their own affairs. Ted & Mac's Amateur Hour will end this week. The Administration will be commissioned to implement the student affairs board. The motives of the Administration have been suspect thus far but perhaps now we can expect an alteration. 
Let's hope that the Administration can follow orders as well as give them.
