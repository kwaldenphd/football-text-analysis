Istvan, Bell win 2004 presidential election 
Candidates react to results of Student Senate vote 
By SCOTT BRODFUEHRER 
News Writer 
The Student Senate broke the election deadlock Sunday after­noon, electing Adam Istvan the next student body president by a15-13 vote. 
While senators were constitu­tionally bound to vote for the candidate that the majority of their dorm voted for, they were not informed of their dorm's vote until Sunday's meeting. 
Judicial Council President Elliot Poindexter declined to release dorm vote totals to The Observer.

Monologue demonstre)tors asked to shut down table in LaFortune 
Queer Film Festival ends without protests 

By ANDREW THAGARD Associate News Editor 
A group of Notre Dame stu­dents promoting Saturday's performance of "The Vagina Monologues" were told to leave the LaFortune Student Center on Friday. 
The group had reserved a table across from the Huddle on the ftrst floor of LaFortune for Friday afternoon in order to promote "The Monologues," but the event turned into a demonstration that offended guests of the student center, said Brian Coughlin, director of Student Activities. 
"They said they were going to be promoting the . . . event this weekend and it was really much more of a demonstra­tion," he said. "They reserved [the table] under one purpose and did something different." 
Coughlin said that his office received several complaints, both by phone and in person, from individuals shopping at the Huddle who said they were upset with what they consid­ered aggressive behavior on the part of the group. Witnesses in LaFortune at the time of the incident character­ized the group's actions as "intimidating." 
Some members, including Notre Dame junior Carole Kennelly, came dressed in biki­nis wrapped in police-style tape with the words "rape free zone." 
"There were a couple of peo­ple who weren't exactly thrilled with us being there," she said. 
Kennelly said that one woman in particular approached her and asked if she had ever been raped. She

Notre Dame's first Queer Film Festival concluded Saturday after drawing large crowds but none of the protests that some had antici­pated on the campus of a Catholic university. 
"It was very successful," said Liam Dacey, a senior Film, Television and Theater major who organized the event. "It's been the best weekend I've had at Notre Dame." 

The four-day festival opened Wednesday evening to a sold out crowd in the Hesburgh Library auditorium. A showing of the film "Jim in Bold" was followed by a question-and­answer session with director Glenn Holsten. The remainder of the festival featured addi­tional films and sessions with directors, producers and screenwriters, though these events did not sell out, Dacey said. 
Notre Dame students, facul­ty and alumni attended the festival, which featured a screenwriting workshop with alumnus Don Roos, a director and \friter and two panel dis­cussions titled "Gay Hollywood: Still in the Closet" and "Film and the Construction of Sexual Identity," in addition to the films. 
The two most popular events, Dacey said, turned out to be on Thursday and Saturday nights. 
On Thur~day, director John Cameron Mitchell came to campus to showcase his film "Hedwig and the Angry Inch." The film and its director drew a busload of fans from Chicago and some of the attendees dressed up in costumes fea­tured in the movie. Saturday's event was also significant as it featured a screening of the film "The Opposite of Sex" Roos. 
Dacey said that the event marked one of few times that Roos had returned to campus since he was a student here several decades ago and that 
his  visit  left  him  more  
impressed  with his  alma  
mater.  

"After this weekend his whole viewpoint on Notre Dame changed," Dacey said. 
Students who attended the festival also said they were pleased with the event.

Tunnel 

VISIOn 
I know what's down there. 

I've now seen the inside of Notre Dame's worst-and-best-kept secret: the tunnels. Worst-kept: you'd have to be oblivious not to notice the selective snow-melting that 
streaks across South Quad and snakes past Stonehenge. Best­kept: they've been sealed off for years, leaving stu­dents with only speculation about what lies 

beneath-until Claire Heininger now. Let's start at the 
Assistant
middle ofit all: the tunnel more than News Editor 400 feet below the Golden Dome. Here we fmd the ghosts of alcohol poli­cies past, from a pyramid stacked high with the kegs that satiated the student sections of the 1970's to the lingering stash of hard alcohol forced to depart the dorms only two years ago. 
Head down the branch towards the Stadium, and you'll uncover the foot­ball team's A-list recruits, right next to Leprechaun Mike's coordination. And if you look hard enough, you might glimpse the charred remnants of a green jersey or two. 
Take a right over to North Quad, and you've hit the tunnel jackpot: leather couches, music, soft lighting, and thou­sands of those utterly seductive Lion King valentines from Knott Hall. It's the anti-dorm lounge, the ultimate 24-hour space, the pit where parietals come to perish -let the digging begin. 
Straight past the den of sin lies LaFortune underground, where Starbucks is bottomless and quarter dogs cost a nickel. The feast just keeps getting better when you round the cor­ner into Grab n' Go gourmet, with a selection that puts Willy Wonka to shame. 
The gluttony comes to a sobering halt, however, when you reach the final stop on our tunnel tour: Big Brother. It's the above-ground e-mail censoring we've all been warned about times a hundred, with bugged microphone links to every salt shaker, every show­erhead, and of course, every post­ResLife hearing, sorrows-drowning commiserating session. 
Got a dirty little secret? No you don't. Big Brother knows. Notre Dame knows. And the tunnels let them keep it that way. 
Leaving the headquarters -feeling pretty violated, I might add-you'll pass the four people who remember in­hall SYRs and the three people who still care about student government. You'll fmd half the cabs in the city of South Bend, and maybe even that freshman hookup you left in one. You'll stumble upon motivation, positive gen­der relations, sunny skies, and all those phrases we toss around that up here, don't really exist. If you're lucky, you might even fmd a computer cluster sta­pler. 
Given the uproar surrounding that idea lately, maybe it's better that the tunnels stayed shut.

In the wake of corporate scandals involving formerly respected firms like Enron, Tyco and Martha Stewart Omnimedia, the Mendoza College of Business is calling "time out." 
The theme of this year's ethics week, which begins today, is ''Time Out for Ethics," said accounting pro­fessor Ken Milani, who is organizing the week's activi­ties. From today through Thursday, the College will host speakers to discuss vari­ous points of ethical behavior in modern business, both in the U.S. and beyond.

"Enron proved that if you don~t have an ethical under­pinning, you'll find yourself on the outside looking in," Milani said. "It was a Fortune 20 company and basically disappeared overnight."

The final five contests were each asked a question and allowed a set amount of time to respond. Piposar was asked which cartoon superhero best suited his personality .

The event also featured three raffle winners, gift bags for attendees and free blue martinis for audience members of legal age.

Istvan later said he was happy the popular vote was fol­lowed. 
"At this point, I was just glad that what the will of the stu­dents was is what happened. I was excited on Thursday when 
-we got a large victory in the popular vote and I'm glad that we got the victory from the stu­dents," Istvan said. Ebersol said that the results were not unexpected, as Istvan had captured 1.723 votes as compared to his 1,538 in Thursday's runoff election. "I didn't think we were going to win, the numbers just didn't work out in the dorms. There is no way the numbers could have worked out," Ebersol said. Istvan received 97 5 more votes in the runoff election than he did in the first election, which he attributed to the mer­its of his ticket, among other factors. "The endorsements [of the other tickets] ... helped us build our own support in addition to the 'anyone but Charlie' [mind­

set among some students]. But [Ebersol has] never been any­thing but completely pleasant and [Leito] is a spectacular stu­dent leader and I would expect to see him in student govern­ment in the future," Istvan said. 
Ebersol said he could not imagine changing the way he campaigned. 
"I don't think we could have run any different a campaign. I think that we did everything that could have been thought of in running a presidential elec­tion and I think at this point we have to just move forward," Ebersol said. · 
Istvan said he planned to incorporate the some of the ideas of the other candidates, saying that student government is "all about great ideas." 
"Ryan [Craft] and Steve [Lynch] had the staplers in the computer clusters, I gotta go with it. I haven't spoken with them yet, but if [Ebersol] says he can get a student on the Board of Trustees, that is some­thing no one can afford to over­look. Any help in that area he can give me would be greatly appreciated," Istvan said. 
Ebersol said his campus involvement next year would likely take the form of work with the Kroc Institute. Leito said he was open to speaking with Istvan and Bell about working in student government next year. 
Istvan, whose previous expe­rience with student government is limited to serving as a dorm dance commissioner, said he would work in the next weeks to overcome this inexperience. 
"I have to ask the current administration a million ques­tions. I want to surround myself with an experienced staff. We are not in office by ourselves," Istvan said. 
Istvan said he would also ben­efit from the efforts to stream­line student government that took place and that he would keep the main idea of the changes in place. 
"The general idea of the changes ... to streamline stu­dent government, to get our own house in order, is a positive step," Istvan said. "It's going to make my job easier, especially being a less experienced presi­dent. It's going to make our job much easier having a new structure in place."

Three mules cloned successfully 
Associated Press 
SEATTLE -Three young mules who are the first mem­bers of the horse family to be cloned are all healthy, normal and energetically enjoying life, say researchers who put them on display here Sunday. 
Idaho Gem, born May 4, 2003, was the first successful cloning of an equine. He was followed by siblings Utah Pioneer on June 9 and Idaho Star on July 27. The clonings were a project of the Northwest Equine Reproduction Laboratory at the University of Idaho in Moscow, Idaho. 

All three were born to surro­gate mares from embryos that were cloned using eggs from horses and cells taken from the 45-day-old fetus of a mule. The cloned mules are the true siblings of Taz, a famous rae­

ing mule. Researchers bred Taz's parents, a jack donkey and a horse mare, and allowed the resulting fetus to grow for 45 days. This provided the DNA needed for the clones. 
Gordon Woods, director of the University of Idaho labora­tory, said the animals undergo intensive medical tests every three months and all three appear to be normal and healthy.

also called the group's actions inappropriate. 
"I was wearing a bikini and I had the "rape free zone" tape wrapped around me," she said. "She thought that was lewd and inappropriate." 
Shortly after this encounter, Kennelly said, representatives from Student Activities approached the table and told the group to close it. The group then relocated to a booth not far from the original table where they continued to hand out literature. 
"That really made them mad and they came down an hour later and told us [that] we needed to leave," Kennelly said. 
Coughlin said that Friday's dismissal resulted from the group's decision to deviate from the agreement they made in reserving the table through Student Activities, not the students' choice of cloth­ing. He said, however, that there is an expectation that visitors will take care in how they dress while in the build­ing. 
"We would just ask any guest of LaFortune to dress in a manner appropriate," he said. 
Controversy continued to surround the production of "The Monologues" on Saturday. Members of Notre Dame and Saint Mary's Right to Life and area churches con­verged outside of Stephen Center before the perform­ance to protest against it, waving signs and distributing miraculous medals.

Rare snowstorm hits Middle East 
AMMAN, Jordan -A rare storm dumped more than two feet of snow on parts of the Middle East, breaking power lines in Lebanon, collapsing a wall at a holy site in Israel and delaying talks between Israelis and Palestinians. At least one person was killed. 
In the capital of this desert kingdom, snow­men lined the streets of Amman on Sunday, and children sledded on plastic tubs and bowls. Parts of Jordan received as much as 2 1/2 feet of snow, and more was reported in outlying Lebanese and Syrian villages. 
The wintery blanket stranded motorists and closed schools and businesses Sunday, the first day of the work week for much of the region.

Once it produces nuclear fuel, Iran would market it under the supervision of the United Nations nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, the official added, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
The United States seeks to restrict coun­tries from acquiring uranium enrichment technology if they have not already done so.

Cruise ship virus strikes 300 
GALVESTON, Texas -A Carnival Cruise Lines ship returned from a five-day cruise to Mexico on Saturday with more than 300 peo­ple sick with a gastrointestinal illness. 
Carnival officials said preliminary tests show the outbreak might have been caused by a norovirus. The virus is spread through contaminated food, contact with infected people or poor hygiene. It can be prevented by regular hand-washing. 
"They did try to handle it very well, from a cleaning perspective and disinfecting and sanitizing things," passenger Christal Davis said after leaving the ship. 
Bush attends Daytona 500 
DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. -President Bush throttled up his re-election campaign Sunday by donning a racing jacket and opening the Daytona 500, NASCAR's most prestigious event in a sport that draws a prized voter profile. 
"Gentlemen, start your engines!" Bush said, squinting up from pit road to the grand­stands, where some 180,000 fans roared. They were promptly drowned out by the scream of stock car engines roaring to life. 
Bush seemed to relish a chance to see what he called "one of America's great sport­ing spectacles."

Drug makers recruit students 
INDIANAPOLIS -A 19-year-old woman who committed suicide this month while par­ticipating in an Eli Lilly and Co. drug trial was among the hundreds of college students recruited to become human research sub­jects. 
Although it is uncertain how many college students offer themselves for the tests, they are exposed on their campuses to notices for the thousands of ongoing research projects via e-mails, Web sites, fliers and word of mouth. 
Traci Johnson, a former student at Indiana Bible College in Indianapolis, was one of 25 local healthy volunteers taking higher-than­normal doses of duloxetine, a compound developed by Lilly to treat incontinence and depression. 



Advisers: Dean close to quitting 
Campaign chairman says nominee 'likely to be John Kerry;' Dean stays defiant 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON 
Howard Dean is preparing 
to abandon his race for the 
Democratic presidential 
nomination if he loses 
Wisconsin's primary, sever­
al advisers said Sunday, 
despite the candidate's 
assertions to the contrary. 
Steve Grossman, national chairman of Dean's cam­paign, said the former Vermont governor will seek to convert his grass-roots network into a movement that helps expand the party and elect the Democratic nominee -"and, obvious­ly, that looks likely to be John Kerry." 
The se'ntiments were echoed by other high-rank­ing campaign officials. though they differed on how much -if any ­direct help Dean would be willing to give Kerry. Polls show the Massachusetts senator, who has won 14 of 16 contests to date, holding a wide lead in Wisconsin, site of Tuesday's contest. 
The comments came as Dean struck a defiant tone hours before debating his rivals in Milwaukee. "We're going to keep going. no matter what, because I think there are a lot of peo­ple all over this country who want to rebuild the party and rebuild America in a different way," Dean said on "Fox News Sunday." 
Dean had told supporters via e-mail that a defeat Tuesday would end his bid for the nomination, but he has backed away from that statement in recent days. 
Several advisers, speak­ing on condition of anonymity, said Dean has privately acknowledged that his prospects for the presidency will effectively end if he suffers another major defeat Tuesday. They leave open the remote pos­

sibility that he will waver 
again, but said it's highly 
unlikely given his com­
ments in recent meetings. 
And, for the first time, there is growing consensus among advisers that it would be foolhardy for Dean to continue fighting for the nomination beyond Wisconsin. The circle of die-hards has shrunk, and most confidants are telling Dean it's time to begin making plans to convert his Internet-fueled network into a long-term political movement. 
"I have no doubt he'll support the nominee in any way he can, no matter who the nominee is and obvi­ously that nominee looks to be John Kerry," Grossman said in a telephone inter­view from Vermont. "He may say that Tuesday night. He may wait until Wednesday or Thursday to say that." 
Grossman said Dean feels just as strongly that he is obligated to press for reforms supported by vot­ers who made him last year's front-runner. "In what form that movement takes, I can't spell that out to you and I don't think Howard could right now, either," said Grossman, for­mer chairman of the Democratic National Committee. 
"I believe that work will effectively be in concert with ... and fairly support­ive of John Kerry, should he become the nominee, and it appears he will," Grossman said. 
Other top advisers said they had doubts whether Dean would ever work directly on Kerry's behalf this year. They are dis­cussing ways to use Dean's network to help elect Democrats to Congress who would support Kerry's agenda as president, sever­al officials said. Scores of campaigns aides were making plans to leave their jobs after Tuesday. 
Campaign manager Roy Neel did not dispute the assertions of Grossman and other advisers, but said it was premature to write Dean's campaign obituary. 
"Any and all options are on the table," Neel said. "The results Tuesday night will help dictate what he does but he is still passion­ately committed to continu­ing the message. What form he does it in, any option for that is on the table." 
Advisers say Dean is torn between his pragmatic conclusion that the race is about over and his emo­tional attachment to the fight itself and his support­ers. His staff is looking at several options -such as suspending, not technically ending, the campaign ­that would give Dean a voice in the process even after he concedes. 

"This is a delicate bal­ancing act that has to be struck for Howard Dean," Grossman said. "His sup­porters, they will not want him to give up and will want to carry out the 
. cause. His name is on the ballot in many states whether he campaigns or is less engaged. The fact is Howard Dean will do everything possible to help the nominee. He will do nothing to undercut the nominee's success." 
The advisers sought to square their perceptions with Dean's public remarks. 
"When Howard Dean says he's not going to quit, what he means is the battle to restore democracy and citizen participation is long-term and he's not going to quit on that bat­tle," Grossman said.

IRAQ 

Leaders promise not to interfere 
Associated Press 

KUWAIT CITY -Iraq's neighbors pledged Sunday not to meddle in Iraqi affairs but urged U.S.-led coali­tion forces to fulfill their duty in pro­viding security there. 
Foreign ministers from Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, Turkey, Kuwait, Syria plus politically influen­tial Egypt wrapped up a two-day meeting at a luxury hotel in the Kuwaiti capital Sunday about the repercussions of developments in Iraq on their region. 
'rhe group has met four times since 
U.S. forces overthrew Saddam Hussein in April, but this weekend's talks were the first to include an Iraqi representative. Bahrain also attended as a representative of the Arab League. 
The nations affirmed "their com­mitment to the principal of noninter­ference in· domestic affairs" and urged others to do the same. 
The group's final communique vowed to support Iraqis as they assume control of their country from U.S.-led forces July 1 and respect the wishes of the Iraqi people. They urged the United Nations to "carry out its pivotal responsibilities" in has­tening the transfer of power and car­rying out the country's elections. 
The group also expressed the importance of a unified Iraq. 
Arab nations had expressed con­cern about a proposal by the U.S.-led coalition to reorganize Iraq into a federal system before transferring power, fearing it may empower eth­nic groups and lead to the country's partition and regional instability. 
But Iraq's Foreign Minister, Hoshyar Zebari, assured the minis­ters that would not happen and asked them to keep out of Iraqi affairs. 
He told The Associated Press they should "leave it for the Iraqis them­selves to decide their own political future, and not dictate." 
The issue of securing borders with neighboring countries did not figure in the final communique. That is most pressing for Iraqis who fear for­eign fighters will cross the border and stir up trouble. 
However, the ministers condemned acts of terror in Iraq, saying those who carry them out must be identi­fied and punished. They called on the U.S.-led coalition to "assume [its] responsibilities ... according to inter­national agreements." They did not elaborate.

IN BRIEF 
U.S. trade deficit hits riew high 
WASHINGTON -America's trade deficit ballooned to an all-time high in 2003, reflect­ing the hearty U.S. appetite for foreign-made cars, clothing and TVs. 
The total deficit was $489.4 billion, 17.1 percent larger than the previous record, set in 2002, the Commerce Department reported Friday. The deficit with China alone was close to $124 billion, also a record. 
The value of foreign goods and services sold to the United States swelled to a record $1.5 trillion for the year. an 8.3 percent increase, as the economy gained momentum in the sec­ond half of the year. 
Feds to indict Enron ex-CEO 
HOUSTON -Federal prosecutors are preparing criminal charges against former Enron Corp. chief executive Jeffrey Skilling for an indictment expected to be handed up this month, perhaps as early as next week, sources close to the case told The Associated Press Friday. 
The two sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, confirmed the government focused on Skilling after securing a guilty plea to two counts of conspiracy from former Enron finance chief Andrew Fastow last month. But they said the process was delicate and public revelation of the new case could be delayed. 
The Houston Chronicle first reported in its online edition early Friday that prosecutors were finalizing possible charges against Skilling. 
Lawyer grilled in Parmalat probe 
ROME -A longtime lawyer fo-r Parmalat's jailed founder Calista Tanzi is being investigat­ed for possible money laundering. as investi­gators in the fraud probe of the dairy giant keep digging into the company's intricate finances. 
Lawyer Michele Ributti denies he laundered money for Tanzi, his attorney said Friday. 
Prosecutors questioned Ributti in his office Thursday night in downtown Milan, searching the office and seizing some documents, said his attorney, Vittorio D'Aiello. They are look­ing at the transfer of money -reportedly more than $1 million -from Parmalat to Ributti's accounts in 2001 and 2002.

CORPORATE SCANDAL 

Tyco trial continues, tests jurors 
Associated Press 

NEW YORK -As the trial of two former executives of Tyco International entered its fifth month, key testimony in the Manhattan courtroom played like Economics 101. 
Defendant Mark Swartz, Tyco's former chief financial officer and first defense witness, opined on such topics as pretax income and bonus plans. Two jurors leaned for­ward and took notes. But most made no attempt to conceal long faces and yawns during last week's testimony. 
No wonder: The jury has. seen five prosecutors call nearly four dozen witnesses and offer 700 exhibits ­an approach that legal observers consider risky. 
"They have a huge amount of proof," said Paul Summit, a former federal prosecutor in Boston. "But it's a delicate balance. You have to wonder how much of the initial proof the jurors are going to 
remember months and  months  
later."  
Ronald  Fischetti.  a  veteran  

Manhattan defense attorney, said prosecutors may have miscalculated by "throwing everything up in the air. hoping something would stick." 
Swartz, 43. and former Tyco CEO Dennis Kozlowski, 57. are charged with grand larceny and enterprise corruption, accused of stealing about $600 million from the elec­tronic and medical supply conglom­erate. Each faces up to 30 years in prison if convicted. 
At times. the white collar case has lived up to its high:.profile billing, with enough sensational allegations of greed, excess and sex to steal headlines from Martha Stewart. 
Jurors have watched a videotaped tour of an $18 million, company­owned apartment on Fifth Avenue highlighting now-infamous decorat­ing flourishes: a $6,000 shower cur­tain, $15,000 umbrella stand and $2,200 wastebasket.

government. Now Istvan will face one of the toughest challenges of any student body presi­dent in simultaneously trying to fix the disen­chantment with campus government demonstrated in this election and the flawed election procedures that helped pro­pel him into power. 
Even those who believed in student government have to shake their heads at the election itself. Under the Student Union Constitution, when election results fail to yield a majority winner, representatives in the Student Senate pick the winner by casting their votes according to which candi­date won a plurality in their dorm. Additionally, had there been a tie in the Senate vote, the student body vice president -Emily Chin, who was not elected to the position -would have made the tie-breaking decision. . 
That meeting took three days to happen, even though dorm results were instantly available after the election. Whether the constitution was followed is anybody's guess. The voting was closed to the public, and student government officials only revealed how each senator voted. Student body presi­dent Jeremy Lao, vice president Emily Chin and Judicial while running. Look at the 1 ,000-vote gain 
Istvan received in the run-off election, which 
leads one to wonder if people were voting for Istvan or against the unpopular Ebersol. Has student apathy reached such a point that students will pass up the most qualified yet least popular candidate -Ebersol -in favor of a candidate whose only experience with student gov­ernment comes as a dorm commissioner-Istvan -because they believe student government doesn't accomplish anything anyway? 
This attitude only fosters a cyclical relationship between students and their elected leaders. When a fundamentally flawed procedure is used to settle the election instead of actual vote totals, students have a reason to feel apathetic. In turn, they have a hard time taking candidates seriously because they don't believe it will make difference. And in this instance, students' votes led to the election of a president who is inexperienced in dealing with the inner workings of ­student government functions-and thus at a disadvantage when it comes to combating some of the problems that cause student apathy in the first place. ­

LETTER TO THE EDITOR 

Run-off process inherently flawed 
While today's closed Senate meet­ing chose the winner that coincided most with the wishes of the Student Body in Thursday's run-off. Adam Istvan, I would like to remark that I have never seen a more unfair, non­sensical and poorly designed process. 
As the off-campus senator, I repre­sent 1,600 people. Let's say every member of my constituency voted and they all voted for one candidate. And let's say every member of Dillon Hall, that has over 300 residents, also all voted for that same candi­date. That's 1,900 votes, which is more than the SO plus one percent needed to secure the presidency in a run-off, even if every other voter chose the other candidate. Let's hypothetically say that happened. 
For fun, if that vote was taken to Senate, the outcome would be grossly different than what students wanted. While that first candidate with over 1,900 votes would have over SO per­cent of student's support, he would only procure a shocking 7 percent in a Senate meeting like today's. The fact that a process like this could turn someone's majority into a mere 7 percent is pretty disgusting to me. 
In Friday's Observer, Charlie Ebersol said, "I think it's important that each dorm has equal representa­tion and equal voices." While the article suggested that Charlie shares my sentiments that the system is 

inherently flawed, this comment does 
not. By saying that "it's necessary that each dorm has an equal voice," Charlie is advocating that students do not have an equal voice. If every dorm is to have an equal voice, then Carroll's some 100 members are more than three times important and influ­ential in today's election than Dillon's 300 mem­bers (and 16 times more important than my off­campus stu­dents). The fact that stu­dents are made unequal in choos­ing their own presi­dent sickens me. 
Candidates run on plat­
forms -promises that will bene­
fit and hurt individual students, not 
dorms. The promises are things that impact the students. And the stu­dents, not the dorms, have a right to pick who they want leading them, whose policies they like bet­ter and want to go 
into effect. Today. a pres­ident who got 
fewer votes than his opponent

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 

Reacting to the Queer Film Festival 
Notre Dame students have duty to respect faith 
I am not a graduate of Notre Dame, but I am a Catholic -a convert-and am sensitive to how our Church appears to the "separated brethren." A top-notch university which bears the name of the Mother of God should be especially con­scious of its duty to present a bold witness to the world of what the Church means. 
I am writing with regard to the gay/lesbian film festival, which I would not be shocked to see on a campus such as Indiana University-Bloomington, but at a school named after Our Lady? Representing a Church founded by Christ who was not ashamed to admit the existence of objective evil, and was not tolerant in the face of such evil? 
I think you have a duty before God to clearly represent the faith on which your school was founded. Anything else is dishonesty and capitulation. Your school is not the correct forum for the gay/lesbian lobby to find its voice.

Let controversy bring a greater understanding of .Catholicism 
I wo,uld like to respond to the Feb. 13 editorial "Festival a step in the right direction." 
The discussion of the administration's policies towards homosexuality has long been discussed at Notre Dame. Under the guise of "academic enlightenment," students, alumni and friends of the University have pushed for greater acceptance of non-Catholic values at Notre Dame. 
I would challenge students at Notre Dame to pursue an understanding of Catholicism while at Notre Dame. Very few people understand why the Church stands by its antiquated teachings of a celibate, male-only priesthood, anti­birth control teachings, no sex before marriage, social teachings, or homosex­uality. Is it simply because the Church is an old institution with old and dated ways? 
The author of the editorial would like­ly answer "yes." The editorial stated Notre Dame's policies are still "far from perfect" but that Notre Dame is starting to see the light. I suggest that this is incorrect and that perhaps much can still be learned from Catholic teachings. Let the Queer Film Festival inspire debate and understanding of Catholic teachings. Do not let it be a vehicle to bring Notre Dame to the standards and thinking of the rest of the world. 
Upon graduation (if not already), most Notre Dame students will find that many Catholic teachings, such as its position on homosexuality, are not pop­ular and are considered laughable by many. Because of this, I think true "aca­demic enlightenment" will be found in understanding why the Church has and holds its unpopular teachings in the face of a world with very strong and popular opposing beliefs. There are very few places to learn about Catholicism on a high intellectual plane. Notre Dame is one of those places. Do not waste your time reaffirming soci­ety's common sense.

Whither Lieutenant Bush? 
 

In the contest between George W. Bush and AI Gore four years ago, hindsight reveals, the press patently neglected its duty to the public. By glossing too mercifully over the rolling litany of Bush's less-than-presi­dential lapses and tics, the press left voters under-informed. America ­or, at least, the Supreme Court-plumped in the end for W. The country, as a result, got stuck with a cowboy blueblood whose biography brims with episodes of mendacity and

recklessness, for which he was scarcely held respon­sible. Precious little has changed. Curiously warm Big

Chaser

Behind," his mammoth tax-plan swindle, the pander­ing shams called "Clean Skies" and "Healthy Forests," his Top Gun photo-op theatrics, and, of course, WMD and the Iraq war-Bush's taste for illusion, and elite dis­taste for accountability, has not only been preserved intact, but bolstered by the license of White House fiat. 
What should we expect from a "war president" who dodged the draft? It's an intriguing irony, and worth our scrutiny. To get a clearer grasp of Bush's character, we should turn to a revealing chapter of our presi­dent's life -a chapter more or less passed over by the mainstream media in 2000: his "service" in the Air National Guard. National security, of course, wasn't issue number one back then. One thing's certain: he got a free pass from the media last time (which Clinton never got), but he's not getting off so easily this year. 
Of the countless measures of electability, a candidate's military history has survived to become a perennial issue. The campaigns of decorated vets John Kerry and Wesley Clark drew special attention to this matter, reviving the storm swirling around Bush's non-stint. Both Democrats hold military credentials infinitely more impressive than Bush's. For this reason, both Kerry and Clark have been forced to confront the contro; versy head on. 
Kerry was drawn in, undoubtedly, by his crack campaign staff, who saw the advantage of pitting Kerry's sterling record against Bush's hazier one. Clark was drawn in by the bothersome Michael Moore's antics, who framed the prospect of a forensic scuffle between Bush and Clark one-dimensionally: "The General versus The Deserter." Soon Clark drew wide criticism for refusing to reject Moore's slander. Draft dodger, sure, but ''deserter?" Not technically, under Article 85 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice. 
Rewind back to 1973. The ordeal of Vietnam was finally ending, as the anti-war movement and the sheer military triumph of the North Vietnamese had taken its toll. Nixon ordered a ceasefire in January, announcing a peace deal later: in the month. By the end of March, the last American troops had left Vietnam. 
At the beginning of October 1973, Bush was relieved of his commit­ment to the National Guard eight months early so he could attend Harvard Business School. This despite his annual performance review, dated May 2, 1973, indicating he did not report for duty to his home base for an entire year. In his defense, Bush says he worked on a campaign in Alabama, d,ging service at the Air National Guard base there. Bush wants us to believe that he "did the duty necessary" to merit the honor­able discharge he received. 
The reality isn't so cut-and-dry. Bush's commander in Alabama, William Turnipseed, reportedly said, ''Had he reported in, I would have had some recall, and I do not. I had been in Texas, done my flight train­ing there. Ifwe had had a first lieutenant from Texas, I would have remembered." 
Bush's discharge papers agree, showing no record of service after May of 1972. Disappearing, without family connections, would mean jail time or a court-martial or an order to active duty. Bush, as usual, got off scot­free. 
There's no question Bush is feeling the pressure: he agreed to a tele­vised cross-examination, to set things straight. During this recent "Meet the Press" interview, a surprisingly declawed Tim Russert broached the issue of Bush's National Guard service. Bush lied, saying he released all relevant records in 2000, when the Boston Globe, on May 3, 2000, reports otherwise. And he claimed again he served in Alabama, despite his commander's recollection. The White House also, on Feb. 10, released more discrepancy-heavy documents, which trimmed his time missing down to six months, leaving questions about his early discharge -in light of his poor attendance, suspension from flying and failure to meet the minimum-traning requirement-wholly unresolved. 
Understandably, the Bush administration is chagrined at the swelling criticism of Bush's military record. "These kinds of attacks have no place in politics and everyone should condemn them," White House spokesman Scott McClellan said. But Bush Sr. had no qualms about branding Clinton a draft-dodger. 
What does this all mean? Foremost, it severely and irrevocably dam­ages his credibility as commander in chief-it's a character issue. And the problem isn't that he dodged the draft by joining the National Guard, 
. it's that he shirked his modest obligations to his country, thanks to old­boy connections. On. top of that, he assiduously denies it all. If the media presses the issue, and the voters learn the facts, the AWOL President and his stable of strategists can only pray it doesn't become a decisive cam­paign issue.

Exhibit at Snite brings America to life 
 By MEEGHAN CONROY 

t ) 
Scene Writer 
The sum of a man's life is ultimately the stories that he leaves behind for others to hear. In the case of painters, their stories are seen and not heard. An artist tells his or her story and offers a brief window into who they were by drawing the viewer into their art. He or she is commonly judged by the vivid way they are able to create a world and share that world with others. 
One individual who strove to preserve man's daily life and surroundings was William Merrit Chase. Chase expressed the identity of Americans through his impressionist paintings. Critics hailed Chase's ability to allow his audience to connect and identify with the work. For the viewer, a park scene became the park down the street, children playing in the fields became their own children and a harbor became their latest vacation spot. The audience is drawn into his work through their own experiences. 
William Merrit Chase was born in Nineveh, Indiana in 1849. He grew up in Indianapolis, where he trained with Barton Hays as a teenager. Hays quickly recognized Chase's talent, and sent him to New York to study. From New York, Chase continued to Munich in 1872 to study at the Royal Academy. After six years of intensive study, Chase returned to New York where he resided and worked for the rest of his life. 
Chase was a true New York cosmopoli­tan. Downtown, his elaborate studio served as an office, gallery and a center for other artists and socialites. Chase was well known in the social scene. However, he was also a devoted father and husband of eight children. Chase often included his fam­ily in his paintings, as may be seen in 'Shinnecock Hills, Long Island'. 
At the Snite, four of Chase's oil paintings are on display. The first three, "Shinnecock Hills, 
Long Island" (1895), "Summer Time (Pulling for Shore)'' (1886), and "Wash Day (Washing Day-A Backyard Reminiscence)" (1886). offer glimpses into the daily activities of nineteenth-century Americans. His use of varied brush stroke and soft color creates dramatic light and perspec­tives, bringing the subjects to life. The audience can-familiarize with the 'normal' scenes and activities, often overlooked in their own lives. 
The last painting in the collection is a still life, "Peonies" (1903}. This piece exhibits one of Chase's greatest challenges: flowers. Although more than one hundred of Chase's works were still lives, very few were flowers because of the technical difficulties they posed. This piece demonstrates his exceptional talent with calculat­ed brush strokes and colors that evoke the beauty of nature and its transience. 
The Lily Endowment Collection, a private phi­lanthropy agency in Indianapolis, made this exhibit possible. The agency strives to support the community, education, and religion of its hometown and state. Thanks to the agency, Chase's work may be preserved as part of Indiana's heritage. The public is welcome to see the collection at the Snite through May 16.

Along with the terrific success Legends has had in its first year of operation comes a unique seminar that discusses the 'lighter' aspects of the college student's beverage of choice. 
·:.B e e r 1 0 1 , " b e ing held at Legends this Tuesda}' from 8 to 10 p.m., is a PowerPoint presentation demonstrating how beer is brewed and fermented, what ingredients make up the contrasting styles of beer, and a sam­pling of seven to eight different kinds of beer so students can taste the differences for them­selves. The seminar also rewards students with two free pints of their choice. This event is lim­ited to students 21 or older. 
"We're just trying to get people exposed to beer," says Jeff Crotty, the general manager of Legends. "We're trying to educate your palate just like your brain. 
"I first discovered these differences working at a microbrewery. If you don't try something, you don't know it's there!" 
"Beer 101" will be led by Jim Herton, the facilities organizer for Notre Dame Food Services, and students can hope to enjoy the demonstrations he makes between the stan­dard domestic beer and international imports. "Beer 101" is also the first of a three-part series in alcohol education at Legends, with the management hoping to have "Wine 101" and "Alcohol Etiquette", the latter of which is aimed at how to interact with others at busi­ness-like processions with alcohol present. 
The event costs $20 per person.

Sandler and Barrymore get back together for Valentine's day 
Romantic movie is top draw for weekend 




By !\1ARIA SMITH 
Scene Editor 
Most students have walked through the second floor of the Hesburgh Library and seen Marian Owczarski's steel sculptures on display. Before Sunday's exhibit opening, few under­stood the meaning of the sculptures for Owczarski and for Owczarski's native Poland. 
The "Pride of Poland" celebration, sponsored by the Polish Club of Notre Dame, gave students and members of the surrounding community the chance to hear the artist speak about his life and work. 
The exhibit features several portraits of influential Polish figures in history. Some of the subjects are well known to most students, such as Pope John Paul II and Nikolaj Kopernik, better known as Copernicus. Others are less well known here, but still significant.· Biochemist Casimir Funk, for example, was awarded a Nobel prize for discov­ering vitamins and raising awareness of vitamin-deficiency diseases. 
Owczarski's life has had a great influence on his work. The artist was born in Lukow in 1932. Seven years later the country was sunk into the horrors of World War II. A Nazi air strike claimed the lives of his family. Owczarski himself was badly wounded and barely survived the war. 
After' the war, Owczarski began to pursue his artistic career, working his way through several schools including the University of Art in Lodz and the Academy of Fine Arts in Warsaw. 
After earning his final degree in 1931, Owczarski became part of a nationwide restoration effort, working to restore churches damaged during the war. Owczarski, a man of diverse talent, worked with wood, glass, stone, plaster, marble and metals in his restoration work. He has also created sculptures using different materials. including wood and stone. 
Ultimately, however, his sculptures in steel are one of the best representa­tions of his art. His first metal sculp­tures were made from pieces of aban­doned tanks found in the Polish coun­tryside, making them particularly potent for Poles who had lived through the war. The artist now uses stainless steel, a product essential to madern society, to create art that will speak to a modern world, describing it as "the most logical medium of the age." 
Owczarski's skill in working with a difficult material has rightfully gained him artistic renown. His sculptures have been exhibited in eleven coun­tries and over 50 cities. including Warsaw, Budapest, Prague, Frankfurt, Paris, London, Moscow and New York. He has won numerous awards for his work. 
Owczarski is currently director of the Galeria at Saint Mary's College and Artist-in-Residence of The Orchard Lake Schools in Michigan. He continues to be involved with Polish-American art organizations in the area. 
The "Pride of Poland" exhibition will be on display in the second floor lobby of the Hesburgh Library until April 25th.

Associated Press 
LOS ANGELES -Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore's romance ·~so First Dates" proved an irresistible draw for the Valentine's weekend date crowd, taking in $41 million to debut as the top movie, according to studio estimates Sunday. 
If the estimates hold, it would be the second-biggest February opening ever, behind the $58 million debut of "Hannibal" in 2001 and just ahead of last year's "Daredevil" at $40.3 mil­lion. 
The previous weekend's top film, "Barbershop 2: Back in Business," slipped to second place with $15.6 million, bringing its 10-day total to $44.1 million. 
The overall box office was down, with the top 12 movies grossing $107.8 million, off 13 percent from the same weekend last year. 
"50 First Dates" was a reunion for Sandler and Barrymore, who starred in "The Wedding Singer," which opened over Valentine's weekend in 1998. 
Sandler's main audience is males in their teens and 20s, who turned out in force, but women made up 57 per­cent of the crowds on the strength of Barrymore and the movie's romantic theme, distributor Sony reported. 
And the Valentine's weekend sealed the deal with audiences. 
"Talk about great timing. For a lot of couples, this was their Valentine entertainment," said Paul Dergarabedian, president of box­office tracker Exhibitor Relations. 
Sandler plays a womanizer smitten by Barrymore, an accident victim who forgets the previous day's mem­ories each morning, forcing Sandler to dream up new ways for the two to meet and fall in love. 
Playing in 3,591 theaters, "50 First Dates" averaged a strong $11,417 a cinema. 
With many people off work Monday for President's Day, "50 First Dates" should come out of the long weekend about halfway to the $100 million level. The movie is positioned to become the first released in 2004 to top that mark. 
Though many critics trashed "50 First Dates," the movie earned its share of positive press, with some reviewers taken in by the story's sweetness and Sandler and Barrymore's chemistry. 
Almost half of the audience was 25 or older, a more mature crowd than normally turns out to see Sandler. 
"I think people were excited to see Adam and Drew paired up again," said Rory Bruer, Sony head of distri­bution. "And I think one thing I would say about Adam, he's just such a likable guy. He's just so accessible to all audiences. People can relate to him." 
In narrow release, the murder thriller "Highwaymen," starring Jim Caviezel, debuted weakly with $203,000 in 111 theaters for an aver­age of $1,829. 
Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at North American theaters. according to Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc. Final figures will be released Tuesday. 
1. "50 First Dates," $41 million. 
2. 
"Barbershop 2: Back in Business," $15.6 million. 

3. "Miracle," $14 million. 


4.

7. "Catch That Kid," $4.35 million.

Special to The Observer 
After trailing 7-2 in the sec­ond period, the 11th-ranked Notre Dame men's lacrosse team rattled off 10 goals in a row to take command of the game en route to a 14-11 exhi­bition victory over the Boston Cannons of Major League Lacrosse Saturday afternoon in the Loftus Sports Center. 
Senior Matt Howell's four goals led a quartet of Irish players who found the net multiple times. 
Howell, who was ninth in the nation in points per game 
(2.11) last season, started Notre Dame's comeback with a goal from sophomore attack Pat Walsh with 8:07 remaining in the first half. It began a 
17:41 stretch in which the Irish would outscore the Cannons 10-0 to take a 12-7 advantage. Irish senior goalie Stewart Crosland was a key part of that run, registering six of his 14 saves in that span. 
Boston struck back with four consecutive goals late in the third and early in the final stanza. With its lead cut to 12­11, Notre Dame got a pair of late insurance tallies after being held scoreless for 18:42.

(12) Teresa Borton (11) and Megan Duffy (11) all scored in double figures. 
Notre Dame (15-8, 8-3) outrebounded Providence (4­18, 0-11) 46-28 and shot 
54.1 percent from the field for the game. 
"I thought we played well offensively. TJ.. J.t was really our emphasis tonight," McGraw said. "We really wanted to score and get out and run in transition." 
Notre Dame passed the ball well in the paint and created many easy scoring opportu­nities. Batteast, Borton and LaVere combined to shoot 16-of-25. 
Playing in their first game in a week, the Irish looked sloppy for some of the first half. After jumping out to a 10-3 lead over the under­sized Friars, Notre Dame held just a 16-15 advantage with 7:13 remaining. 
But Joyce gave Notre Dame a cushion by hitting all five of her shots in the final seven minutes of the half. By the time intermission came, Providence saw a one-point deficit turn into a nearly insurmountable 14-point dis­crepancy. 
··1 really think that 3-point­er that she hit at the end of the half really demoralized Providence," McGraw said. " ... We really fell apart there [for a while in the first half). I thought we lost our intensi­ty at both ends of the floor. Then [Joyce] came in and gave us a little spark and we just fed off of that." 
The Irish played better in the second half, shooting over 64 percent from the 
field, as they led by as many as 32 at one point. McGraw used her entire bench as every player except Anne Weese logged at least 10 minutes. 
"Overall I thought just about everybody played well," McGraw said. 
Notre Dame is now just a half-game behind West Virginia in the Big East standings. The Mountaineers are 9-3, while the Irish are 8-3. West Virginia beat Notre Dame earlier this season, giving the Mountaineers the tiebreaker. Connecticut is 10­1 and in first place in the conference.

With the home sweep, Notre Dame also took a step closer toward securing home-ice advantage in the playoffs for the first time since joining the CCHA. The top six finishers in the con­ference receive home-ice advan­tage in the first round of the playoffs. 
"Any time you can get four points at this point in the season, it's huge," Irish coach Dave Poulin said. 
Friday, the Irish got the first goal of the game just 2:53 into the first period, as defenseman Tom Galvin took a shot from the blue line, and it was deflected past Mike Brown by forward Matt Amado. Ferris State would come back to tie the game less than two minutes later, with Derek Nesbitt beating Irish goalie David Brown with a hard slap shot on a 3-on-2. Each team scored a goal on its first shot of the game. 
The Irish came back to take a lead, this time with Aaron Gill picking up a tally with less than a minute left in the first period. · Notre Dame outshot the Bulldogs 16-5, but Mike Brown stifled Irish chances again and again. 
Ferris State would come back to score the only goal of the sec­ond period, taking a 2-2 tie into the intermission, but Notre Dame would come back to score two quick goals in the third. After Jindra's tally, the Irish whipped a perfect pass to forward Josh Sciba as he came out of the penalty box. 
Sciba broke in alone on Mike Brown and beat him one-on-one with a quick wrist shot to put the game away for the Irish.

tant to take advantage of it. Sciba's goal might have been even bigger, and that was proba­bly the best penalty we've ever taken since we got two goals out of it." 
Saturday, Notre Dame got off to an even quicker start, with defensemen Galvin and Neil Komadoski scoring the first two goals. Komadoski and Galvin worked the point positions to perfection all night long, with each senior picking up three points on the night as Galvin had two assists and one goal and Komadoski notched two goals and one assist. 
The second period had no scoring, but it still featured a key moment in the game. Mike Brown was hit by a shot in the neck at 2:22 and was forced to leave the game. Tom Mueller came into replace Brown, who had played every single minute of the season for Ferris State up until this season. 
"I was not very happy with our second period," Poulin said. "There was a kid who came in and hadn't played a minute, and we seemed to get away from the little things we take pride in. 
"At the second intermission, I told these guys that I was not going to let an opportunity slip away here." 
The Irish answered the call, peppering Mueller with 13 shots in the third, connecting on two of them. Komadoski scored his sec­ond goal of the game with a low shot from the blue line while the Irish were on the power play. 
The senior defenseman picked up his third goal of the season, a career high. Michael Bartlett scored an insurance goal at 
14:55 of the period, beating Mueller with a quick low wrister to the glove side after skating left-to-right in front of the net. 
"We got back to our game in the third period," Poulin said. "We're not there yet as a team, but this was still a very good effort, especially going into a break week." 
The Irish are off next weekend before facing Michigan in a two­game series at the Joyce Center Feb. 27 and 28.

~--to cater to the personnel on the court. 
Without Francis, the Irish created spacing on offense and became more active on defense. 
Notre Dame out-rebounded (37-32}, out-assisted (16-15) and outscored its opponent, a Seton Hall team that sits fourth in the Big East and has wins over Pittsburgh, Rutgers and Syracuse -all teams which have defeated the Irish. 
Thomas led all scorers with 26 points on 9-of-19 shooting, including 19 in the second half. He also finished with seven rebounds and four 
-assists. "Thomas made a lot of good shots," Brey said. "I've always 

<. thought he is a second half player, and he came out in the second half. His conditioning is what really paid off. In the second half, the other players got tired but Thomas didn't." 
The Irish had four players in double figures, including Thomas, Torrian Jones (13), Chris Quinn (1 0) and Tom Timmermans (10). 
Both teams began the game with poor shooting. The Pirates made 35.5 percent of their first-half field goals. with the Irish shooting just 37.1 percent. 


Seton Hall point guard Andre Barrett led all scorers at halftime with 11 points. The Irish. however, got five or more points from five different players in the half. Sophomore forward Rick Cornett, who is receiving more playing time due to Francis' injury, had six first-half points during a scor­ing drought for both teams. 
Jones, Thomas and Quinn accounted for 14 of the 16 total Irish assists. due in large part to the success of a drive­and-kick method the guards employed Saturday. The team turned the ball over just nine times while managing to spread out the offense and execute the motion offense Brey has installed. 
"On the offensive end with­out Torin, we play more five out on the perimeter," Quinn said. "[That] leaves open driv­ing lanes. [We] did a good job of getting into the lane, and Seton Hall was really collaps­ing on us. We just found the open guy." 
Notre Dame expe.nded its lead in the early second half to seven points after Jones con­verted a basket off a pass from Quinn. but Seton Hall would score eight of the next 10 points. Pirates' forward Kelly Whitney, who had 18 points, gave the Irish problems down low, scoring 12 points in the second half. Barrett -who finished with a team-high 20 points -reached the foul line and made key plays to keep his team in the game. 
Thomas, however, had the upper hand on the day, scor­ing nine points in an 11-6 Irish run and making key shots toward the game's fin­ish. 
The Irish shot 43.9 percent from the field and just 29.4 percent from the 3-point arc, but the team took care of the ball and used baseline drives and pick-and-rolls off of Timmermans and Cornette to get 23 free throw attempts and establish solid ball con­trol. 
The effort the team gave Saturday gives the Irish hope for a test at Syracuse tonight. 
"We have a tremendous amount of momentum right now [going into Syracuse]." Thomas said. "With Torin going out, everybody's turned their back on us. If we contin­ue to play like this, we'll give the [NCAA tournament] selec­tion committee a great run for their money." 
Note: 
Thomas missed a foul shot and erased hope of being a perfect 7-for-7 from the chari­ty stripe late in the game Saturday. 
With the miss. Thomas came one point shy of tying his own career record of most points in back-to-hack games. Thomas scored 31 points ver­sus Connecticut and 26 points against Seton Hall, amounting to 57 points in two games. Thomas scored 58 points in two consecutive games at West Virginia (26) and Miami 
(32) as a freshman.

and the sellout Joyce Center crowd roared their approval. 
"I made a play on the ball, and he got a step on me going down the court. I knew that either I had to block it or coach [Mike] Brey was going to chew me out:' Jones modestly said after the game. "I knew I had to block it to make up for my mis­take." 
His teammates were more praising. "I wish I could have a block like that," Jordan Cornette grinned. "That's a hell of a play," Tom Timmermans added. 
Jones went on to score five of Notre Dame's final six points and swatted J.R. Morris' 3­pointer with four seconds left to secure Notre Dame's 71-68 win over Seton Hall. And when ESPN wanted to put Chris Thomas on-camera after the game, that gave Irish coach Mike Brey and Jones a chance to walk off the court with arms around each other's shoulders. 
Sure, Thomas led Notre Dame in scoring for the second straight game with 26 points. But Jones' stat line -13 points, five rebounds, six assists and two blocks in 39 minutes ­underlined the important role he plays in trying to help the Irish claw their way toward the NCAA Tournament. 
With Torin Francis missing Saturday's game with back problems, Notre Dame had no consistent low-post presence to exploit against the shorter Pirates. But Jones and the rest of the Irish turned that weak­ness into a backbreaking threat. 
Because the middle of the floor wide open, Jones was able to penetrate a sieve-like Seton Hall defense easily. If he didn't flip a layup from an impossible angle that dropped into the bas­ket, he fired a pass to the perimeter for his teammates to drain a 3-pointer. 


"I think Torrian Jones has shown the greatest improve­ment over knowing when to drive and when to pass. and knowing when not to force a shot," Brey said. "And that's a fine line, because he can make difficult shots." 
Sure, Jones had his weak moments, like in the early min­utes when he missed easy lay­ups and open jumpers. But he adapted over the course of Saturday's game -a process that somehow mimics Jones' progression this year. 
Few. had ever questioned Jones' vocal leadership, but he had only played in a supporting role. And over the summer, 
faced with the prospect of play­
ing significant minutes for the 
first time in his college career, 
the senior co-captain spent end­
less hours working on his game. 
He tried to showcase it all, too, as the season began -by firing long-range jumpers and doing things that were very un­Torrian Jones like. But a con­versation with. Brey helped Jones realize he had to return to his strengths -pia ying 
 aggressive defense and attack­ing the basket with slashing drives. 
He has. And it's no surprise that Notre Dame is on a roll.

Return date tmknown for Francis 
By ANDREW SOUKUP 
Sports Writer 
Until Saturday, sophomore forward Torin Francis had never missed a game in his Notre Dame career. Now, the Irish don't know when he is going to play again. 
An MRI last week revealed that Francis is sidelined indefi­nitely with a bulging disc in his lower back. He had only played an average of eight minutes in games against Pittsburgh and Connecticut before leaving because of back spasms. 
''I'm planning on playing the rest of the season with him not coming back," Irish coach Mike Brey said. "If he were to recover in the next two to three weeks, that would be icing on the cake. But I think right now, what you see out there is what you get." 

Francis, who had started all 54 games of his Notre Dame career, is the team's third­leading scorer and leading rebounder by averaging 14.8 he said sitting out is the best points and 8.8 rebounds a hope for a speedy recovery. game. He will not travel to "You get into a thing where tonight's game against its what's best for the team Syracuse. and what's best for the kid," 
"Hopefully, it won't be any Brey said. "What's best for the longer that two weeks." the kid is that he can't play. and sophomore Francis said. "But I he has a future beyond Notre can't tell." Dame that we have to protect 
Brey said the Irish had not a little bit. And he understands decided whether to have that, and we'll have to move Francis undergo surgery to on without him." correct his back problem. But For a frustrated Francis, this is the most serious injury of his career. But the Irish, which have won two straight games against top-25 RPI foes, have managed to have success in Francis' absence. 

"It's tough, but we got two wins," Francis said. "We're playing well, and that makes it better."

No Francis, no problem in 71-68 Irish win

Trailing by six points with just over two minutes left in the game, Seton Hall was barely clinging to its hopes for a victo­ry when John Allen drove hard toward the basket and tossed up what seemed to be an uncontested layup that would have cut the Irish lead to four. 
It didn't stay uncon­tested for very long. 
Torrian Jones, Notre Dame's resident S.W.A.T. team operative, soared high into the air and reached his arm up even higher. Just as quickly as Allen released the ball, it moved away from Jones' hand even faster. 
Saying he rejected Allen's shot would be an understatement. The ball landed well out of bounds and started bouncing up the tunnel from where Notre Dame enters the Joyce Center court. Jones finally landed, waved his arms in front of him as if to say, "No way, not today,"

"Jeneka was the difference, espeCially in the first half," McGraw said. "She had the knockout punch at the end of the half to hit that 3-pointer. That was really great to see her come in and have a great

Joyce said she  was just  
doing her job.  
"Whenever  I  have  an  

opportunity to play and get in, I take my shots when they're open," Joyce said. "That's my job. I'm just filling my role."

Irish move to sixth in conference 
ByJUSTIN SCHUVER Associate Sports Editor 
The Irish showed no love for Ferris State on Valentine's Day weekend, collecting a 4-2 win Friday and a 4-1 victory Saturday. 
An offense that has been rather quiet all year finally start­ed clicking as the Irish scored a combined eight goals in their two wins. 
Notre Dame collected three goals from its defensemen on Saturday, and even goalie David Brown helped out on the offense with an assist Friday night. 
"We really worked on getting the puck to the net this week in practice," Poulin said. 
The Irish got the puck to the net quickly in both games this weekend, scoring the first goal in each with less than three min­utes elapsed in the first period. 
Also, in a season in which the luck of the Irish simply hasn't been there, Notre Dame got a few bounces to go their way. Friday the Irish scored a short­handed goal in what was per­haps one of the strangest plays of the entire season. 
With the score tied 2-2 in the third period, and the Bulldogs on a power play, Notre Dame was forced to take a faceoff in its defensive zone. Irish forward Jason Smith won the draw and made a short pass to forward 
T.J. Jindra, who skated the puck into the neutral zone. 
Jindra then flipped the puck along the center-ice boards, and Ferris State goaltender Mike Brown headed toward the boards to stop it. 
The puck glanced off a metal scansion and deflected toward the vacated net. Brown tried to get back to stop it, but the puck hit off the wall at a perfect angle and slid down the ice into the empty net. 
"We finally got a bounce to go our way," Jindra said after the game. "Anytime you get a goal on the penalty kill it's a big goal. I just dumped the puck down and got a lucky bounce." 
Notre Dame's special teams came through in a big way this weekend, with Notre Dame's power play scoring two goals on Saturday, and the team killing all nine Ferris State power plays in the two games, in addition to Jindra's shortie. 
When shorthanded, The Irish have been especially solid lately and stretched their streak to 33
