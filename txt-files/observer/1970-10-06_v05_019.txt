Will hold senate e-lections Oct. 14 
by John Abowd 
The 1970 Student Senate elections will be held on Wednesday October 14, according to SBVP Mark Winings chairman of the elections committee. SBP, Dave Krashna, said that the vote is being held because a referendum to establish a new constitution replacing the Student Senate with a President's Council is "out of order at this time." 
"The constitution we've drawn up will be presented to a new senate which JS going to be elected next Wednesday," said Krashna. 
Commenting on his original plan to hold a referendum without convening the senate he said: "I thought it was rather ridiculous to have a Senate consider a constitution to abolish itself. If the referendum had failed then I would resort to a senate." 
The new constitution calls the President's council an ''executive organ of the students of the University.''' The council would be composed of the SBP, as chairman, the Hall Presidents 
and  off-cam pus  representative,  
the  undergraduate  members of  
the  Student  Life  Council, and  
the  Student  Government  



Hesburgh outlines problems 
In a spl'ech delivered to the Notre Dame faculty yesterday afternoon University President Rev. Theodore Hesburgh out­lined what he considers the major problems confronting American Universities today. Hesburgh called the task of meeting the challenge of modern education crucial to the survival of the University system. "I can't think of a time when the task looked more difficult than now, Hesburgh said. 
One of the basic problems, according to Hesburgh has been the "steady dryup of public and private, moral and financial support." He contended that this ioss has seriously hurt many universities. 
"The largest single factor in the growth of higher education is the public support for it,' he claimed. 
Hesburgh speculated that the Jack of public suooort was partly due to the outside com-. munity's expectations for it. 
"In a real sense, the university has been oversold," he said. 
Hesburgh noted that there has been tremendous expansion in the nation's university system in recent years but called the. growth "uneven," since most of the emphasis has centered on the sciences. Hesburgh claimed this imbalance caused the humanities to lose a part of their direction as they strived to imitate the scientific method in a quest for the money and material poured into science. 
Hesburgh saw some of the university's problems' with the local community as stemmjng 
from a reaciion to what the community views as a threat to the status quo, brought on by the university's constant concern with seeking solutions to con­temporary social problems. 
"The University at times, is judged to be subversive," he said. 
Citing the example of the University of Wisconsin, where 
student  leaders  pressured  the  
president  into  resigning,  and  
caused  a  breakdown  in  the  

governing of the university, Hesburgh declared the collapse of administrative authority as a more serious threat to the entire system. 
"The greater danger is what is happening within the university itself" he said. "Some call it the collapse of academic freedom ·and call for punitive measures. Feeling is running high" he 
added. 
Hesburgh claimed that every sector of the university com­munity had its own demands on the institution. He described the various wants of Trustees, Alumni, Faculty, Benefactors, parents and students demonstra­ting how they can often conflict. 
"In general, I would say the 


University President Theodore 
M. Hesburgh, pictured here at an earlier address. 
Trustee system has worked well" he said, stipulating that it was necessary for faculty to have a say in academic structures and students to be largely responsi­ble for handling student life regulations. He felt that changes in the governing structure of the university w;i3 by no means the total solution to ·the university's 
·problems. 
Hesburgh indicated that he had recently received two letters from President Nixon in connec­tion with student 'and faculty unrest. Hesburgh said his advice to the president had been that Nixon should be aware of the issues that lie at the roots of student discontent. Though he conceded that campus unrest was a major nation'al crisis he said he believed the two most 
important  issues concerned  the  
"equality  of  life"  and  the  
"priorities  represented  by  the  

national budget." 
Hesburgh countered the many problems facing the universities by listing the many values that remained conl\tant in the system. Most importantly, he speculated, "niaybe the university is the only place in the world where we can bridge the generation gap." 
tie praised modern students for their talents, chief of which was what he called their ability to think in terms of absolutes. But he included a belief in the shortcomings as well principally a lack of a sense of history. 
He offer,~d a solution to this lack in an increase in the quality of education. "Good teaching, no, great teaching may be the salvation of the university today." He was skeptical about teachers who engage in research to the extent that their teaching duties are neglected. 
Hesburgh said he believes the nation and the world are facing a very crucial mom~nt in their history. "I suspect we are, in the Western world, passing an histor­ical watershed," he said, adding that· this country especially is facing "a fork in the road." 
While he recognized the im­portance of political activity for the modern student and teacher, Hesburgh affirmed his belief in the necessity ·ror disassociation of the university from any political affiliations. "It can and must remain politically neutral," he said. 
Hesburgh noted that though action is important in time of crises, in his view the primary purpose of college is thought. He called learning the most "thrilling" task of the faculty and the most "exciting" exper­ience of the student. Of the ultimate nal.ure of the university as a whole, Hesburgh concluded, "It is still the House of Reason." 
Cabinet in a non-voting capacity. 
The SLC members would vote 
only on budgetary matters. 
The constitution also creates a General Assembly of the entire student body. This body would be called by the SBP at least once during his term. "This general assembly will be structured in such a way as to allow for the airing of student opinion," according to the text. 
SBVP Mark Winnings said that an assembly would "probably be called once a semester" He added, "We envision different structures for different assemblies so that we can hear from every segment of the University." 
When questioned about his campaign acltivities Krashna said, "We will state our position on 
the new constitution in the different halls probably this weekend. 1 would imagine that each potential ·senator will have in the back of his mind that he may be voting on the abolition of the Senat'~ and some senators may· run on that position. Simply, we will be saying that we plan to abolish the Senate." Krashna and Winnings said they do not "at this time" plan to endorse any specific candidates. 
Krashna added "The Senate has never been representative in any way. shape or form, I really wonder if we're representative of the student body here. I wonder if Phil McKenna was; I wonder if Rich Rossie was. I would think that we would be more 'liberal' or 'radical' than the student body. To make student government work, hall governments have to work." 

SBP David Krashna 

Regarding the election itself, Stay Senator Russ Stone said the election would follow traditional procedure. Potential candidates will report to the Senate room in LaFortune Center at 7 p.m. on Wednesday October 7. Completed nomination petitions

PARTIAL TEXT OF DAVE KRASHNA 'S STATEMENT ON THE 
PROPOS/<,"'[) CONSTITUTION. 

"We're moving to abolish the present form of student government that is, the student senate because we believe that the senate as it is structured now is useless considering the reality of the pres:ent situation. All student life !legislation is in the hands of the SLC. So, I believe our emphasis should be directed there. The student government per se, should consist of a body which can, hopefully, congeal student opm1ons from the various hall members by the most appropriate and natural people within the halls to do so the hall presidents. 
"To have the student senate would make us virtually ineffective. We do not need a Student Senate. What we need again, is a body made up of the people closest to the hall members. We believe that to be the Hall presidents. To say that the senate or any student government body at the present time can legislate on student life would be quite erronious and impractical and not an accurate picture of the present situation." 
HPC finalizes float plans 
At last night's meeting, the Hall Preside:nt's Council laid the groundwork for a successful homecoming weekend, student support will determine the out~ come. 
The H.P.C. is guaranteed $350 from the Student Union for homecoming week activities. It was originally decided that each hall would erect its own display or float, that they would all be judged, and those halls taking first. second, and third place would be a warded $200, $100, and $50 respectively. 
While in session last week, Buz Imhoff proposed a change in homecoming. His plan called 
for  each  hall  to  donate  their  
expected  expenditures  to  
charity,  and  that  the  prize  

money be used to build a float 
for each quad. 
The council accepted this plan half-way, deciding to use some of the money to build a display on the South Quadrangle, and to distribute the remainder among a number of charities. The eighteen halls aligned with the North and South Quads agreed to support the construction of this display, while the Grace and Flanner presidents chose to combine their efforts in the building of a separate project. 
The burden of designing and organizing a display was assumed by fifth year architecture stu­dent, Frank Liebner. After pre­liminary matters were com­pleted, chairman John Barkett gave' the floor to Liebner who then explained what progress had been made and what com­plications could be expected to rise. 
He then presented the plans for the display which he had devised. He described the project as "a cadet, 20 feet high, in green field, on maneuvers, con­fronted by Ara 's secret weapon." 
The materials have already been ordered·and the expenses are not expected to exceed $120. Four items are still in demand: a power drill, a saber saw, heavy-duty extension chords, and "manpower."

Janis Joplin found dead of overdose 
HOLLYWOOD (UPI)-Singer Janis Joplin, whose husky, near shouting vocal style propelled her to the top of the pop charts was found dead at her apartment late Sunday'. 
Her body was found wedged between a bed and nightstand by one of the members of her group, "Janis Joplin Full Tilt Boogie Banp,'' She was clad in a short nightgown. 
Ed Sanchez of the Hollywood Police Department said the singer had "numerous hypo­dermic needle marks on her left forearm." Some appeared to be covered over by makeup but were from two to 14 days old, he said. No drugs nor narcotic paraphernalia was found in the room. 
The coroner's office said yes­terday an overdose of drugs was the cause of death and that further tests were underway to determine the specific agent. 
Miss Joplin, considered by many to be the top female rock singer in the nation, was the object of concern by some writers in the field that she would burn herself out by her all out delivery. 
"People like to say I'm · ruining it," she said last year. "Maybe it's getting rougher but I still could reach all the notes I ever could. I don't know how long it will last. As long as I do, 
probably." 

Miss Joplin had an electrifying appearance on sltage, with her long· hair shaking, her unin­hibited movements and her husky, shouting vocalizing. "She tore the guts out of songs," a critic once said of her singing. 
When her physician told her she should slow down her frenetic pace, Miss Joplin re­plied: "Man, I'd rather have 10 years of superhypermost than live to be 70 sitting in some goddamn chair watching TV. Right now is where you are. How can you wait'?" 
Miss Joplin burst on the national rock scene in 1967 when she sang her .blues version of Gershwin's "Summertime" and "Ball and Chain" at the Monterey, Calif., pop festival. 
Her rough, throaty singing and the remarkable intensity of her voice, which would soar into screams and shouts, were dis­played in concerts around the country and in record albums. Lately, she said, she could get high just on the music. 
Her fondness for drinking Southern Comfort was well known -she would down it by the quart on stage -and her fans would bring scores of

Federal Wiretaps increase 300% 
WASHINGTON (UPI)-Fed­eral wiretaps during the first half of this year were up more than 300 per cent over all of 1969 Attorney General John N. Mitchell1"eported yesterday. 

Mitchell defended the sharply increased use of electronic sur­veillance, calling it "a particular­ly effective weapon" in the government's law enforcemt::nt arsenal. 
"The only repression that has resulted is the repression of crime," he said. 

Mitchell, in a speech for the annual meeting of the International Association of Po­lice Chiefs in Atlantic City, N.J., said federal agents installed 30 court authorized wiretaps in 196 9 and l 03 more through July 13 of this year-most of them to get evidence for gamb­ling mnarcotics and extortion cases.

U.S. senators oppose election reforms 
WASHINGTON (UPI) The 
Senate yesterday gave up con­
sideration of a constitutional 
amendment for direct election 
of the president. Its chief 
sponsor conceded he lacked the 
votes to break a Southern lead 
filibuster. 
"We're just not going to be 
able to shut off this filibuster," 
said Sen. Birch Bayh, D Ind. He 
consulted with Senate Demo­
cratic Leader l\ijke Mansfie[d 
who then won the Senate's 
consent to call off Tuesday's 
third scheduled vote on whether 
to coke off debate through the 
parliamentary device of cloture. 
Senators from southern and 
small states opposed the amend­
ment which had passed the 
House 339 to 70, out of fear 
their states would wield· less

Control Act were not ordered as "fishing expeditions" Mitchell they had produced evidence so far for 419 arrests and 3 25 indictments. 
"Arrests resulted in all but 12 of these wiretaps," he added. 
In addition, Mitchell said, police in states where wiretap­ping is permitted had installed 241 taps last year but that records for 1970 were not yet available. 
"I hardly think the 271 federal and state wire taps occurring last year in the United States constitute an abuse of the privilege,"· he told the police chiefs in a reference to claims by civil libertarians that the eaves­dropping is an invasion of privacy. 
But the Attorney Ger.eral said his department also was vigor­ously enforcing a section of the 1968 act prohibitting wiretap­ping by private parties."" 
"We believe that it is our duty to be jsut as. diligent in halting the illegal use of wiretaps as in using . authorized wiretaps to combat organized crime," he said.

Mansfield said the third vote on limiting debate would not be held before Nov. 16-if the Senate failing to finish its work before the election holds a post election session. Without such a session, no further action was scheduled on the amendment Bayh told reporters too many senators were absent-many of them campaigning for 
reelection-to win the the two thirds vote needed to cut off debate. 
Sen. Howard H. Baker, R Tenn., another backer, said he did not want a third vote on cloture. "It was not part of our strategy," Baker said.

Rusk was hired for the faculty of the state supported university 
last  December  over  the  
objections  of  conservative

Maddox who described him as " A LEFT WING INTERNATION­ALIST." 
Rusk and his wife moved into a small apartment in this city of 50,000 Saturday following a two day drive from Washington. He spent Monday quietly moving books and personal items into his office at the School of Law. 
Instead of conducting formal classes Rusk will deliver lectures and ·participate in panel discussions with students. The lectures, to be carried to student groups on closed circuit television, will start in about two weeks. 
"I didn't come to the University of Georgia to propagandize the foreign policy of the Kennedy and Johnson administrations_" Rusk told a reporter in his wood-panelled office, "but I won't shrink from any questions or discussions by students about the things that happened during those years " 
Students from Tennessee Invited to work for Gore 
Students interested in doing campaign work this fall will be invited to work for Senator Albert Gore's bid for reelection, in a meeting to be held Thursday night. In what is expected to be a close race, active student participation could be the decid­ing factor in determining tht; outcome. 
Fred Meyer, of Jackson, Ten­nesse, is coordinating the pro­gram to involve students in working for Gore. Until now, the idea has met with little success, mainly as a result of poor publicity. Meyer who 

-himself worked for Gore's cam­paign during the summer stres­sed the crucial political situation throughout most ·of Tennesse, and urge any interested Tennesse residents to overcome the feeling of apa-thy that could spell defeat in such a close contest. 
Meyer will hold a meeting Thursday night at 7:00 pm in 425 Walsh Hall. He invites all interested students to attend. Last Thursday's meeting attract­ed a few students and no definite course could be mapped out With the defeat of the Princeton Plan referendum Meyer feels it's now up to the personal initiative to make the student voice count in '70 elections.

Student respon.e to the Ruddle's new hours has been faonble,

Huddle hours work well 
by The Redman 

The extended hours in the Huddle have been quite successful so far, according to Edmund Price, Director of Food services 
He claimed that business has been good during the new times. However, he emphasized that the change in hours is not final, and that permanent change depends on continued student support. A final decison won't be made on Huddle hours until the beginning of the second semester. 
(Continued from Page 2) 
Bayh  tried  to win  Southern  
support  for  a  compromise  
amendment  but  he  had  to  

abandon that effort too, late in the day. 
"The general feeling is that at this late date there is not sufficient time to consider some­thing totally new," he said. 
Attempts to invoke cloture failed by five votes last week when 14 senators were absent. It failed by six votes the previous week. 
Baker and Bayh preferred that the amendment be side tracked to the Senate calendar from which it could be revived in a post election session. A third cloture defeat, they feared, might kill it forever. 
They proposed, instead, a compromise to the Southern bloc that abandoned the direct popular vote principle, but re­tained safeguards against a candi · date who received fewer votes than his opponent becoming President, which can happen under the current Electoral College system. 
Under the compromise, the Electoral College system would be retained, but without the office of elector.

construction will be between the Knights of Columbus building and Alumni Hall. Success, he stressed, will depend almost entirely upon the number of hardworking hours put in by the students. 
People interested should work during any free period from 
9:00 until dark; those with construction background are urged to respond to this call. 
The new hours are a result of a student questionnaire strongly favoring later hours for the Huddle. In response to the ques­
tionnaire,  Mr.  Price  expanded  
hours  to  12:30  A.M.  for  all  
nights.  

One advantage to the change has been the increased student employment at the Huddle. A staff of seven students mans the Huddle from 10:30 P.M. until closing. 
Mr. Price also mentioned the possibility of obtaining some new equipment for the Huddle. Included would be a pizza oven, which would offer the student a greater selection of food than already offered. 
He expressed hope that the Huddle would be open all night during first semester final examns. He said there may be a staffing problem however, since most students wouldn't have the time to work before exams.

Princeton Plan (2) 
Last Friday the Notre Dame Student Body, with a convincing finality, called a moratorium to its participation in the national democratic process. 
The proportions of the vote were mind-bending. At least, it bent the minds of those who still held the hope that the students of this University didn't sell the political birthright they won last May for a mess of Thanksgiving turkey. But that part, at least, is over. 
There are all sorts of things on which we could blame the landslide: Dave Krashna, for procrastinating on his endorsement; the Scholastic, for weakening their endorsement, WSND, for their opposition; the Academic Council for making the terms of the agreement so harsh and dissonant that it was inpalatable tc the weak, but the issue would be skirted if we passed the blame to small individual entities. 
We are the guilty party. Let it be noted here that we, the Student Body of the University of Notre Dame, rejected our first chance ever to effect American politics a:. free men. We rejected it overwhelmingly, and with unmistakable clarity. And in rejecting it, we confessed our willingness to take the consequences of the campaigns and elections over the next four years of our life. 
During the next four years, a large number of students at this University will pretend that this year-1970-marked the breakdown of the American political svstem Then let us mark, too, the fact that in 1970 it was not the American political :.ystem, but us which broke down. 
PRINCETON PLAN POLLING 
About the only good thing about the election was the way it was run-efficiently and honestly. Student Government could take a lesson and a half about running elections from this escapade. There was a theory-long cherished by Student Government-that if ballot boxes were put outside every door everybody on campus would vote, and that would be a Good Thing. 
We submit that the late referendum indicates precisely the opposite. It indicates that when an election is held in a place where it tak,~s a minimal amount of effort to find and a little bit of exercise to reach, the voting public is more informed and more interested . And that we submit is a Good Thing.

.. Now that is lifelike!'' 

on Fr. McGrath 
In this, the last of the series of articles reflecting on the present situation at St. Mary's College, it is fitting to examine the direction in .which the college is moving. Little can be said concerning concrete advances in the future, for at the moment St. Mary's is searching for someone to take the place left by the death of Msgr. McGrath. 
This place is currently being held by Sister M. Alma Peter, 
C.S.C. formerly Assistant to I'resident McGrath. Since coming to St. Mary's twenty years ago, Sr. M. Alma ha~ held the posts of Director of Admissions Dean of Freshmen, and Academic Dean. As Acting President, Sr. M. Alma is perhaps the best qualified to speak on the direction of St. Mary's. 
Having worked under four presidents at St. Mary's, Sr. M. Alma has seen definite progress made, "as far as continuing excellence in teaching and upgrading of the academic areas." Upgrading can be seen in such areas as pass/fail, the Madeleva Scholars programs, and the participation by St. Mary's in the programs abroad as well as the St. Mary's Campus in Rome. 
Progress under Msgr. McGrath was made in both social and academic areas. "He more or less set up a new idea of the college community. He increased participation in the college by setting up committees from the Board of Trustees on down on which students and faculty were included as well as administrators." Community Governmnet originated during Msgr. Ml--Grath's administration and social reforms such as no-hours, and a new dress code came into being. 
Thus, under the administration of Msgr. McGrath, St. Mary's progressed and changed. Now in his absence new directions must be chosen and followed through. 
At present there is much discussion as to the advisability of St. Mary's becoming coeducational with the University of Notre Dame. Daily the pros and cons of the situation are discussed on both campuses. The ultimate decision is not imminent but according to Sr. M. Alma there are "great advantages in having an academic co-educational situation. And I also believe in a coeducational social and cultural community. But I still think there are advantages to a woman's residential college." 
Asked about the future of St. Mary's if Notre Dame would go co-educational independently, Sr. M. Alma stated that as long as applications keep up, there would be no problem. Last year for the present Freshmen class, there were 3778 requests for information, 984 applications, and 507 freshmen currently enrolled in classes. 
Sister sees definite advantages to St. Mary's remaining a separate institution, such as freedom in the dorms and the residential aspect of the college. "As far as academics, we've always mentioned the fact that smaller classes make for easier dialogue with students. I think the liberal arts area should be continued and strengthened because this is something a small college should do and be able to do well." 
The selection of a new president will be a large factor in the direction which St. Mary's will take. As a member of the search committee, Sr. M. Alma says she personally is looking for " the best possible person for this period of development at St. Mary's. A person who might have been a candidate I 0 years ago might not be right for 1970. We're not looking for some big name but a person who might be a leader. And also someone who will maintain the real aims of St. Mary's as a Catholic Liberal Arts College." 
Thus St. Mary's College is at a crossroads. She has made advances in the realm of academic and has maintained her status as a residential Catholic Libeml Arts College. The question of her future can only be answered by the new President when he decides the directions in which she is to go. With Msgr. McGrath's death, St. Mary's has had a time to reflect her worth and her goals. We've come a long way--but there's still a long way to go.

Nixon pledges 'full generation of peace' 
WASHINGTON (UPI) President Nixon said last night he hoped his 12,000 mile tour would help make possible "what this world has not had this century-a full generation of peace." 
In the exact words that he had expressed earlier in the day at the gravesite of his ancr:stors in Ireland, Nixon summed up his nine day trip as a voyage to remind America's antagonists of its strength and of its intention to use that strength for peace 
About 1 ,500 wellwishers­including cabinet members, leaders of Congress and many diplomats-welcomed Nixon and his wife in a huge hanger at Andrews Air Force Base, Md., near Washington. Mrs. Martha Mitchell, dressed in a bright orange coat, was especially prominent in the receiving line. 
The President, fresh and in good spirits despite ~is hectic travels, said he say young faces in the air base crowd and said, "What we want for them is what this world has not had this 

century, a full generation of peace." He said he hoped "that the trip may have contributed 
substantially to that goal.'  
Earlier,  standing  at  a  
graveyard  at  the  village  of  
Timahoe,  where  his  

great-great-great great-great grandfather, Thomas Milhous, was buried two centuries ago, Nixon dedicated a memorial to the dead and said there, too, that "a full generation of peace"-denied all young people in this century-was the goal of his presidency. 
Nixon palnned a report to Congressional members and the nation on his journey which brought him to Italy, the Vatican, the 6th fleet in the Mediterranean, Yugoslavia, Spain, Britian and Ireland. 
His purpose was chiefly to flex the nation's naval muscle in the Mediterranean where an expanding Soviet fleet is challenging America's dominance. But in the aftermath of the deat!r-of Egypt's Gamal

Irish opponents should help ranking 

by Terry Shields Observer Sports Editor 
When the last few weeks of the season roll around there just might be a reshufffling of the top teams in the nation as far as the wire r ranking is concerned. This reshuffling will be a direct result of the strengths and weaknesses of opposing teams. 
If Notre Dame can manage to go through the season unbeaten along with Ohio State, Texas, and Mississippi, the obvious choice of the team with the roughest schedule would have to be the Irish. 
After four weeks of the season has been completed there are six teams on the Irish slate with winning records The combined record of all ND opponents is 20-13-1. 
A glance at the Irish schedule 
might clarify rna t ters. 
Jim Donaldson 
Sports Shorts 
How about that Irish defense! They have given up just 3 74 yards 
rushing in the first three games and have yielded only 213 yards 
through the air, while holding the opposition to a mere 4.7 points 
per game. 
The alert Notre Dame "D' has intercepted five passes and 
recovered five fumbles thus far. 
Opposing quarterbacks have completed just 26% of their passes 
22 of 84, against the Irish. 
Clarence Ellis and Walt Patulski, both bidding for All-American 
honors, led the Notre Dame defensive effort against Michigan State. 
Ellis notched his third interception in as many games to kill a first 
quarter Spartan scoring threat while Patulski spent so much time in 
the MSU backfield that he should have had a green jersey on. 
The Irish defense has given up but one touchdown this season, 
that score coming on a 23-yard march by Northwestern. 
The Irish will be hunting their third straight shutout Saturday 
versus Army. The last Notre Dame team to ring up three successive 
whitewashing was the 1966 national championship unit. 
The Cadets have been shutout in their last three meetings with the 
Irish, losing 17-0 in '65, 35-0 in '66, and 45-0 last season. 
The Notre Dame ground game accounted for .366 yards Saturday 
the season's best figure. Joe Theismann was the club's top runner, 
gaining 113 yards. 
Bobby Minnix and Larry Parker saw a good deal of action against 
State and both were impressive. 
Denny Allan, the team's No. I running back, suffered an ankle 
injury Saturday and will miss the Army game but should be back in 
action for the Missouri contest. 
Generally, the team's reaction to the Tartan surface in Spartan 
Stadium was not favorable. The Irish prefer grass to the "rug". 
Joe Theismann and Tom Gatewood dazzled the Spartan stadium 
crowd of 76,103 by combining for 9 completions, good for 117 
yards. Theismann hit on 12 of 17 passes on a windy day not 
conducive to an accurate aerial attack. 
Gatewood now has 28 catches and needs but 33 more in the next 
seven games to break Jack Snow's single season pass reception mark 
of 60, set in 1964. 
Scott Hempel kept his perfect kicking record intact, booting two 
extra points. He now has put 13 of 13 PAT's through the uprights 
and is two for two in the field goal department. 
The Orioles had too much firepower for the Twins and took the 
American League playoff while the Big Red Machine swept1Jhree 
games from the Pirates in taking the National League crown. Last 
week, I confidently picked the winners of these playoffs but this 
week I'm torn between logic and loyalty. I'd like to see the Reds win 
but. because of the questionable pitching, I'll have to pick the Birds . from Baltimore in six games. 
Booters tie again 
Kevin Kniely's goal with four minutes left in the fourth quarter enabled the Fighting Irish soccer team to salvage a 1-1 tie with Marquette in a match played Saturday in Mil­waukee. The Notre Dame boaters are now 1-1-2 on the season. 
Marquette had grabbed a 1-0 lead by virtue of a second quarter goal but the Warriors were unable to hold their advan­tage. Late in the game Kniely took a pass from· Tom Shriver Northwestern has not been able to win a ball game in three outings. One loss was to ND and the other two have been "nail biters" with UCLA taking the measure of the Wildcats 12-7 and SMU scoring 23 to their 20. 
Purdue is one Irish foe that may convince many pollsters of the Notre Dame strength. The Boilers have shutout Texas Christian and upset previously unbeaten and highly regarded Stanford. The men from Lafayette were not quite so fortunate when they came to South Bend, yet they must still be given recognition for their two big wins. 
Michigan State can help the Irish cause this weekend with an impressive showing against Ohio State at East Lansing The Spartans have split a pair of games with two Washington 
about 30 feet from the goal and booted home the tying marker for the Irish. 
Neither club was able to score in a pair of five-minute overt­imes. 
The contest was rough and tumble throughout and two players from each club were ejected from the game.

opponents (WSU and UW) besides their whitewashing by the Irish. 
The two service academies will not make much of an impression on sportswriters or opposing coaches with a combined record of 2-6 but each have been a traditional game for Notre Dame thus they appear as "breathers" for the Irish. 
Missouri as was expected, has fielded another tough ball club in the rugged Big Eight Conference. The tigers are 3-1, losing to Air Force and whipping

Pittsburgh, after a near upset of UCLA, has come on to beat two unheralded opponents in Baylor and Kent State so no one actually knows what the Panthers can really do. Their game with West Virginia,if they win, can make the ND schedule that much more impressive. 
Georgia Tech has been the most surprising of all the Notre Dame foes. The Yell ow Jackets are undefeated and untied in four contests and they are becoming more prominent in the national rankings each week. With seven home games in Atlanta this season their record should still be impressive for their November 14 appointment in South Bend. 
After an upset by Texas A&M, Louisiana State has managed to bring its record to a very fine 3-1. The big question that Irish fans are asking is can the Tigers hold Archie and the Bear's teams in tact before their late autumn date in scenic Northern Indiana? 
Southern Cal was felt by many to be the strongest team in the nation this fall but a rugged tie with Nebraska should halt the Trojans from any No. I activity. To make the ND schedule that much· more formidable SC victories over Stanford this weekend and UCLA later are necessary. 
The National Ch~mpionship might just not be conceded to Woody or Darrell after all. 
Ruggers drop Spartans 
by J.W. Findling -The Irish ruggers won their 
second straight game with a 
brilliant 20-6 victory over Mich­igan State at East Lansing last Saturday. The well-deserved win kept the ruggers undefeated. 
The hard fought battle was highlighted by the outstanding defensive performance of Irish senior Jim Hagenbarth who stopped several Spartan drives. The scoring for the Notre Dame Rugby Club looked like a reunion for second floor Kee­nan. Seniors Tom Herlihy, Charles "Jack" Blum, and Mark "Savage" Rubinelli (all ex­second floor Keenan men) scored the tries for Notre Dame. Herlihy opened the scoring with a fine run from outside the 20. Blum and Rubinelli each scored twice to bring their season total to three tries apiece. Doug Smego, a sophomore who just moved up to the "A" team, made two conversions and kicked a 25-yard penalty kick to complete the Irish scoring.

ND Sailors place lllglt 
The Notre Dame Sailing Club competed in two regattas over the weekend. The Irish placed high in both matches. In the 
·regatta at Bloomington with host Indiana University, ND finished third in a field of seven Midwest schools. Tom Willison and Will Donalon were repre­senting du Lac. Donalon was impressive by sailing either first or second in every race except for one in which he capsized. 
The other regatta was held in Milwaukee, Wisconsin with Marquette University serving as the host squad. Kevin Hoyt was the outstanding Irish sailor as he finished second m his division. George Gaw and Tom Salack also competed for the Irish who managed a second place finish among seven schools. 
The next action for the ND sailors takes place next Saturday as they travel to Ann Arbor for the Michigan Regatta. This is the second biggest regatta in the Midwest. This will be the first time that Notre Dame will pool her talent for a regatta and an optimistic outlook is held by the Sailing Club. 
In two weeks Notre Dame will host a dectagonal regatta on Octob ~8.

Stone  also  noted that  the  

amendment procedures of the present constitution require the Senate to either adopt the amendment directly by a two-thirds vote or schedule a "plebicite", if 500 students request one. 
Stone thought that the decision to hold the election was reached by "mutual agreement" within student government, "not a power play." 
Winnings disagreed with Stone's views on the necessity of the Senate for constitutional revision. He said that Student government would ask the new Senate to adopt the new constitution "in toto" but referendum. He noted that the considered this to be "unlikely." Senate is bound to provide for

Mario Savio returns to Berkely 
BERKELEY, Calif. (UPI) fhe University of California opened for its 10 l st year yesterday with the return to classes of Mario Savio and a mild threat from the banned Students for a Democrlltic Society.

old Savio worked as a bartender and bookstore clerk and spent a year at Oxford University in England. 
No incidents marred the first day of classes as approximately 27,500 students enrolled for the fall term, including about 2,700 freshmen. Several changes have occurred at the university since the spring. Some were aimed at preventing a repetition of the wave of student unrest which plagued Berkeley and other college communities across the nation last year.
