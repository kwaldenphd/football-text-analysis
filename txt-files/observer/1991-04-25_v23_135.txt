U.N. military observers open first posts in southern Iraq 

SAFWAN, Iraq (AP) -Un­armed U.N. military observers opened their first posts Wednesday in southern Iraq, but a U.S. Army colonel said his troops would stay on indefi­nitely to protect Iraqi refugees. 
The U.S. flag was lowered and a blue United Nations flag raised in its place during a brief noontime ceremony in 100-degree heat at a check­point vacated by about a dozen U.S. soldiers. 
However, Col. Bill Nash of the 3rd Armored Division's 1st Brigade, said roughly 5,000 troops under his command would remain in southern Iraq to provide security and humanitarian aid to thousands of Iraqi refugees. Many of the Iraqis supported a failed uprising against Saddam Hussein and fear reprisals from his security forces after U.S.

Brother Scully is 'Rector of the Year' 
Special to The Observer 
Brother Bonaventure Scully, rector of Keenan Hall, has been named Rector of the Year by the Hall Presidents Council at Notre Dame. 
Among the most popular res­idence hall rectors, Scully has been an enthusiastic supporter of spiritual retreats and social service projects for Keenan Hall residents. 
In addition to his assistance in organizing these and other hall activities, Scully was re­sponsible for what one student recommendation called the transformation of "an aban­doned dungeon of a basement into a bright, well decorated and much-used social area with drop-ceilings, piped-in music, televisions. pool tables, video games and study space." 

Brother Scully 
Also, largely through Scully's efforts, Keenan Hall boasts a small library and the only mu­sic room in any campus resi­dence hall. "Quite simply," wrote the student, "he has made the hall itself a more comfortable place to live." 
A native of Baltimore, Md., Scully graduated from Catholic University of America and pro­fessed vows in the Xaverian Brothers in 1951. He holds a master's degree in chemistry from the University of Detroit and a master's degree in reli­gious education from Loyola University in Chicago. · 
Before becoming Keenan Hall's rector in 1985, Scully taught science and religion and served as counselor, retreat di­rector, and principal for Xave­rian Catholic high schools in Massachusetts, Kentucky and New York. 
lie has also served the Catholic school systems in Den­ver, Colo. and Memphis, Tenn. as superintendent and his reli­gious order as its provincial vocation counselor. In 1971, he became the first president of the National Association of He­ligious Brothers. 
Gorbachev defeats attempt to oust him 
MOSCOW (AP) -President Mikhail Gorbachev on Wednes­day quashed an attempt by hard-line Communists to oust him as party leader, claiming his departure would create an "explosive power vacuum" and lead to dictatorship. 
Strengthened by a last­minute agreement by leaders of nine Soviet republics to back his economic "anti-crisis" plan, Gorbachev outmaneuvered his critics at a closed meeting of the party's 41 0-member Central Committee. 
In the process, he again demonstrated the political skills that brought him from a minor post in the provinces to the top of the party and have allowed him to survive six years of turbulent reforms. 
The agreement with the re­publics was reached late Tues­day after the republic's leaders were reportedly brought to Gorbachev's dacha, or country home, in southwestern Moscow. 
Gorbachev's concessions to the reformist leaders -includ­ing dropping an unpopular tax and a possible cost-of-living wage index -gave him the backing to thwart the hard-lin­ers. 
Among those at the meeting was Gorbachev's chief political rival. Russian Federation Pres­ident Boris Yeltsin, whose sup­porters have staged recent ral­lies demanding Gorbachev's ouster.

Toying with the idea of

One of my best friends will soon be, quite frankly, going to the Chapel of Love. 
In the immortal words of the Dixie Cups, they're "gonna get ma-a-a-rried."

their very functiona.._________ coffee mugs, and cursed for their sticky stools. 
We were all sitting at the counter, and, not yet realizing that we had become one with the marmalade on our seats, we were rhapsodizing about how exceedingly comfortable it was to grip these mugs (they were ideal, really), when I suddenly noticed the couple immediately to my left. 
She was weeping. He was sweating. They were engaged. My mind whirled with a thousand questions. 
Did I get to throw the shower? What would I wear? Could I possibly talk her into having fuchsia and teal as her wedding colors? 
How much did the ring cost? When it's my turn, will I settle for anything less than nine carats (the rock, not the gold)? If she had said no, would he have been able to return the ring? Or only exchange it? Would the salesclerks snicker and suggest cufflinks as consolation? 
More importantly, did she have to get married? After all, it all comes down to babies. I can't imagine any good reason to get married except to have babies. 
To be honest, I've toyed with the idea o having a child out of wedlock, eliminating the annoying male counterpart altogether. Actually, I've toyed with the idea of having a child out o wedlock every two years, maybe trading them in or something -they're only cute for so long. But I know it's something I could never follow through on. I might lose my credibility. 
Our waitress (who, being only mildly cor­pulent, couldn't possibly have been the Fat Shirley. I wouldn't call her svelte, though, either. Let's call her Well-Fed Willa) interrupted the blissful reverie to ceremoniously announce her preference of being paid before the actual digestion process begins. 
We showed W. F. Willa the ring, but she didn't seem to be too surprised. "Oh, that happens here all the time." 
Shocking, but true. Fat Shirley's is South Bend's very own love shack. 
I'm afraid this recent betrothal might have affected me. For example, during room picks, I opted to live on the "garden level" (most conducive to being serenaded). 
Every time I encounter a child-person under the age of two, I involuntarily blather in nonsensical monosyllables (also, sometimes i you poke their little tummies, they'll cover up their eyes with their chubby hands). 
Perhaps one of the most awkward devel­opments is that lately, whenever someone approaches me and says, "Paige, will you-" I throw my arms around the speaker and shriek, "Yes 0 YES, a thousand times YES!" 
And I must admit that I've become a regular at Fat Shirley's. (I can't help it. I love their mugs.)

Antarctic mining talks deadlocked 
MADRID, Spain -Talks aimed at protecting the fragile Antarctic environment were at an impasse today over the issue of mining on the continent, the leader of the U.S. delegation said. The United States is among the 38 nations that signed the 1959 Antarctic Treaty and are attending a special conference on the Antarctic environment. The treaty banned military bases and nuclear and other weapons testing, but did not address mining and drilling for oil on the frozen continent. All signatories support at least a limited moratorium on these practices. More than a dozen nations including France, Australia and New Zealand go even further and favor a permanent ban. The United States, Britain, Chile, China and Brazil are the strongest opponents of this permanent ban.

A youthful fling with Lana Turner resulted in her pregnancy and an ensuing abortion, he reports.

Death row inmate may not be sane enough 
BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) ­Michael Owen Perry becomes aggressive and hostile when he hears about pop singer Olivia Newton-John, who he thinks is a goddess living under the Louisiana town where he killed five relatives. 
He also has shaved his eye­brows so his brain can get more oxygen. 
The issue isn't whether Perry is insane. It's whether Perry should be medicated to make him coherent enough to be exe­cuted. 
The state wants to force Perry to take Haldol, a power­ful mind-altering drug, so it can strap him in the electric chair. Defense attorneys say the plan, once tossed out by the U.S. Supreme Court, is cruel and unusual. 
State District Judge L.J. Hymel is scheduled to take an­other look at the case on Thursday. 
"It is contrary to what we have said we are going to do with the death penalty," said Perry's attorney, Keith Nordyke. "As a society, we have decided that we are going to have the death penalty for cer­tain crimes, but we are not go­ing to execute certain people. That includes the insane." 
A 1986 U.S. Supreme Court ruling bars states from execut­ing anyone who is insane. 
Perry, now 36, was convicted of first-degree murder in the 1983 shootings of his parents, brother, cousin and 2-year-old nephew in the small south Louisiana town of Lake Arthur. Perry lived in a trailer behind his parent's home. 
According to authorities, Perry said he first used a pistol to shoot the victims, then re­turned later with a shotgun. 
During a police hunt for Perry, authorities said they had learned he had written fan let­ters telling Newton-John that he thought she was a goddess who lived beneath the town. Police also said Perry was turned back by security guards when he tried to visit her Cali­fornia home. 
Perry's mental state rapidly fell apart after he went to death row. In October 1988, Hymel ruled that Perry's mental illness rendered him incompetent for execution. But Hymel also ordered that Perry receive medication -against his will if necessary -so he could regain competence and be executed. 
"Louisiana's interest in the execution of that jury's verdict overrides those rights of Perry," Hymel said. 
But last November, the U.S. Supreme Court in November set aside Hymel's ruling. The high court ordered the judge to restudy the case in light of an­other ruling that gave prison officials the right to force in­mates to take drugs -provided that it was in the prisoner's best medical interest and if the inmate posed a threat to himself or another. 

Nordyke said that even with the drugs, Perry "is never really coherent." However, the state attorney general's office said the drugs help Perry and the state has a legitimate 
interest in  seeing that  he  
becomes  sane  enough  to  
execute.  

During arguments before the Supreme Court, Justice Thur­good Marshall, who opposes capital punishment under all circumstances, asked state at­torneys why Perry was not sim­ply given enough mind-altering drugs to kill him. 
"It would be cheaper," Mar­shall said caustically. 
Medical resident suspended for AIDS mishap 
CHICAGO (AP) -A first-year medical resident was relieved of his duties after giving a woman a gynecological exam with a swab that may have been used on a patient with the AIDS virus, a hospital spokesman said Wednesday. 
Officials at Illinois Masonic Hospital refused to discuss details, except to say that Dr. Omar Gaeda, a resident in internal medicine was suspended pending an internal investigation. 
The hospital planned to release a more complete statement Thursday, said a nursing supervisor, who asked that her name not be used. 
The woman was inadver­tently tested with the used 
swab last week during a routine test for cervical cancer and has been advised by doctors to take the drug AZT, her lawyer, Philip Corboy, said Tuesday. 
AZT, or zidovudine, is used to combat AIDS. 
"The terrible aspect of this is that she's in doubt; she doesn;t know where she stands," Cor boy said. "This woman ... has been faced with the possibility of a disease that she never had to face before." 
"They've protected her as much as possible by pre­scribing the AZT. But she's a mother and a wife with two children and a husband ... she's scared as hell," he said. 
The woman, identified only as Jane Doe, filed a lawsuit Tuesday against the hospital and Gaeda in Cook County Circuit Court. The suit says they were negligent and failed to take appropriate precautions. 
There was no telephone listing for Gaeda in Chicago or its suburbs. 
Corboy said his client, who is in her early 30s, was referred to Illinois Masonic by her health maintenance organization for a medical checkup, which included a Pap test. 
The Pap test for cervical cancer involves scraping cells from the cervix, which are examined for signs of abnormal development. 
The woman said Gaeda 

returned to the room a few minutes after the exam and told her he mistakenly used a swab that had been used on a person with an infection, according to Corboy. 
Corboy said the hospital wouldn't comment about the infection, but two other staff doctors told her to immediately begin taking AZT, which she did. Corboy said the prescription of AZT led him to believe the other patient has the AIDS virus. 
The state Department of Public Health, which regulates and licenses hospitals, is investigatiPg the matter, said department .,pokeswoman Pam Locklin.

the Kremlin tried to force Gor­bachev to give an account of his handling of the embattled party and crumbling economy. That would have opened the way for stinging criticism and a move to force Gorbachev to step down as party leader. 
In recent weeks, some hard­liners have demanded separat­ing Gorbachev's dual posts of general secretary of the 18 mil­lion-member Communist Party and president of the country. 
Also, Gorbachev has faced resignation calls from re­formists who believe he has be­trayed his original democratic vision. 
The effort to make Gorbachev give an account of his govern­ment was defeated by a show of hands, with the overwhelming majority supporting Gorbachev, Central Committee member and historian Roy Medvedev said in an interview with The Associ­ated Press. 
The official news agency Tass said before the meeting began that Gorbachev was "under at­tack by the party apparatus, the so-called conservative forces, which are seeking revenge for the perestroika (reforms) that he started in 1985." 
Because the Central Commit­tee meeting was closed, details of Gorbachev's maneuvering were unknown. 
But his main thrusts were clear: He brandished the agreement with republic lead­ers as evidence that he was taking resolute steps to halt the country's economic collapse, and painted a dire picture of the power struggle that would occur if he stepped down.

"Let's soberly imagine what would happen if these demands are fulfilled: The destruction of the lawful state structure would inevitably create an explosive power vacuum," Gorbachev told the plenum, according to Tass. 
"And no matter who were to come out on top, in place of democratic institutions would come arbitrary rule -to put it simply, a very real dictatorship, and not the imaginary one that some people see in the current constitutional regime," he said. 
Gorbachev hailed the signing of a joint statement by the leaders of nine Soviet republics as "the start of a turning point" for the nation. 
There, he made several con­cessions to the reformist lead­ers, offering to cancel an un­popular, new 5 percent sales tax on everyday goods and to consider a nationwide wage in­dexation program. 
The republics that did not take part in the agr.eement were the three Baltic states, as well as Georgia, Armenia and Moldavia. 
Religions focus attention on sex 
NEW YOHK (AP)-Sex, often ealled an obsession of modern soeiety and its mass media, also is attracting concentrated attm1tion by religious organiza­tions. 
Four major Protestant de­nominations have had special task forces probing the subject, and Homan Catholic bishops n~eently issued their first com­prnhensive guidelines about it. 
But this shouldn't suggest "it is some form of fixation," dis­tracting the church from its work of evangelism and serviee. says an Episcopal commission's report on human sexuality. 
"There is too much else to be done for God." 
Nevertheless, special panels of two denominations -the Episcopal Church and the Pres­byterian Church (U.S.A) are recommending basic changes in church stances about sex, particularly homosexuality. 
Indications of wide opposition cast doubt on whether church conventions this summer would approve the reports and made sharp controversy about them inevitable. 
In both cases. recommenda­
tions are being made that would allow ordination of ac­tive or non-celibate homosexu­
als to the clergy, and also 
would ask consideration of 
blessing same-sex unions. 
"Coming of age about sexual­
ity requires affirming a diver­
sity of responsible sexualities in 
the church, including the lives 
of gay men and lesbians," says 
the Presbyterian report. 
In a third denomination, the United Methodist Church, a study committee also has tenta­tively decided to recommend dropping its condemnation of homosexual practice as "incompatible with Christian teaching." 
The Rev. William Mason of Tulsa, Okla., chairman of an evangelical wing, Good News, sees "absolute indignation" among both clergy and laity as the result. 
The issue, however, won't be acted on by that denomination until its next general confer­ence in 1992. 
A fourth denomination, the Evangelical Lutheran Church in American, also has a special sexuality study under way, but its conclusions won't be ready in time for the biennial church assembly in August. 
Still another religious body, the Central Conference of American Rabbis, representing Reform Judaism, last fall acted to allow ordination of active homosexuals as rabbis. 

Roman Catholicism's sexual education guidelines, approved by U.S. bishops and published in February, uphold traditional positions limiting sex relations to marriage and requiring celibacy in singleness and the clergy. 
However, recommendations by the Episcopal and Presbyte­rian panels would condone sex­ual relationships of homosexu­als, and allow ordination of those involved in such unions. 
All "persons can benefit from the comfort and support of close relationships," says the Episcopal report. "We agree that homosexual relationships 
· often provide such comfort and support and exhibit commend­able love and commitment." It is recommended that "the church be open to ordaining gay men and lesbians otherwise qualified who display the same integrity in their sexual relationships which we ask of our heterosexual ordinands." The Presbyterian study panel was sharply divided, 10 to six, in its majority conclusions that acceptable sex relations need not always be confmed to mar­riage -the traditional church position.

Future of Little 500 in question after revelry 



BLOOMINGTON, Ind. (AP)­City officials, Indiana University administrators and students and apartment owners and managers are trying to figure out how to stop the troublemaking associated with the Little 500 bicycle race. . 
In a news release, IU Presi­dent Thomas Ehrlich said he is "keenly disappointed with the harmful and even violent con­duct of those individuals whose behavior has cast a shadow over the Little 500 weekend. 
Countless hours of hard work by thousands of IU students to make the Little 500 weekend successful were quickly sub­sumed by the disgusting actions of those who chose to break the law and violate the rights of others." 

Off-campus revelry led to hundreds of alcohol-related ar­rests after the bicycle race this past weekend. Officials have History moved questioned whether the annual event should be canceled or

INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -A mu­seum worker who combed through Purdue University's archives believes he has found the clue that could tell the world once and for all what re­ally happened to pioneer avia­tor Amelia Earhart. 
Gary Quigg, who is a pilot himself, says the clue lies in two old photos of Earhart, who disappeared over the South Pa­cific during an around-the­world flight 54 years ago. 
Quigg, 28, discovered the photos last month in a Purdue library. Earhart was a women's career counselor at Purdue in 1935. 
The photos show her and navigator Fred Noonan stand­ing in front of the open cockpit door of their twin-engine Lock­heed 10-E Electra a few days before their July 7, 1937, dis­appearance. 
Also visible in the photos is an object resembling an alu­minum box that Quigg said looks like a bookcase used to hold navigation records. He be­lieves it is the same one found in 1989 on Nikumaroro, an un­inhabited island in the South Pacific. 
The box was found on the is­land by members of The Inter­national Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery, of which Quigg is a member. 
It has been identified through its serial number as an avia­tor's bookcase, and FBI tests dated it to the 1930s. But it wasn't linked to Earhart's plane before Quigg found the photos. 
"That makes me feel good," he said in a recent interview. "I feel like I contributed some­thing." 
Now, recovering the plane and solving the mystery is his next goal. 
Earhart. already one of the most prominent celebrities of should not be tolerated in our city, and if we can't figure out a way to get this under control. then we should consider not having the race." 
Sharp. who was threatened with a stick in a riot at the Varsity Villas complex where hundreds of students live, isn't calling for the race to be canceled. But he agrees changes must be made. 
Sharp said he will propose changing the race from spring to fall, when students would not be celebrating the end of the school year. and to a week­day rather than weekend. He also suggests giving it more lo­cal focus and discouraging out­of-town attendance. 
"They're coming in to have a good time, and they're very de­structive too," Sharp said. 
IU Foundation President Cur­tis Simic said Little 500 does "a heck of a lot of good" and should not be canceled "just because a few people are living outside of the law" any more than should football or basket­ball games. 
Simic, who would have final say on any changes, does not see how changing the season would help, but is "willing to listen" to all proposals. He said he would consult with city and IU officials before making deci­sions. 
City officials say off-campus partying has escalated since the' Bloomington campus dean of students cracked down on al­cohol use on campus. 

Indiana pilot may have a Clue to Earhart's vanishing 
the 1930s, became a eult figure after disappearing about 3.000 miles north of New Zealand, somewhere between Lae. New Guinea, and Howland Island. 
She had become the first woman to cross the Atlantic alone in 1932 and the also the first woman to fly solo across the United States that same year. In January 1935 she be­came the first woman to fly from Hawaii to the U.S. main­land. 
Her disappearance triggered a massive search, and has led to speculation ever since. Among the theories put forth was that she was spying on the Japanese for the United States and was captured and died in captivity. Other theorists as­sume she simply became lost and ran out of fuel over the ocean. 
TIGHAR's theory of what happened to Earhart and Noo­nan goes like this: 
The pair became lost and crash-landed on a coral shelf extending from Nikamaroro, which was once known as Gardner's Island. The shelf was exposed because the tide was low, but the plane was probably washed away within a few days when the tide came in. 
Meanwhile, Earhart and Noonan set up a camp on the island but died. probably from thirst. before rescuers could reach them. 
The U.S. Navy dispatched the battleship USS Colorado to the area. But the ship, traveling from Hawaii, took a week to reach the remote island 2,000 miles away. 
Lt. John 0. Lambrecht, the Colorado's senior aviator, re­ported seeing signs of recent habitation on the island, but no people.

The comfort of dormitory rooms makes the problem of homelessnHss seem distant. P1wple often picture the down­trodden lining strHets and sub­way stations in large cities, but not in South Bend. 
Heality shows the homeless scrape for survival only a few milf!S beyond the Golden Dome. 
ThH Hope Hescue Mission, 532 South Michigan, provided 16,046 beds for the homeless lust year. The Center for the llomeless, R 1 :1 South Michigan, provided 1,903 beds lust month. 
The U.S. Census Bureau counted 236 homeless people in the shelters or visible on the streets of South Bend in 1990. 
The Center for the Homeless provides shelter and services that help reintegrate the home­less into sociHty. 
;\ major expansion to the Center ineludHd 13 family rooms and a dormitory which can accommodate 40 women. It also included a playroom, triple the office space for Madi­son Center programs in support of addicts and the mentally ill, and expanded office space for a lngal aid clinic staffed by ND law students. 
The Center has the capacity to accommodate 150 guests and currently has 60 to 70 res­Idents. The number of beds provided for March 1991 de­<~reased to 1,903 from the 3,540 provided in March 1990.

The Hope Rescue Mission also works to meet the needs of South Bend's homeless. 
The numbers at the Mission have increased dramatically. Between 1980 and 19$10, the number of bnds rose from 7,545 to 16,046. 
The numbers have not only risnn but the composition of the population has also changed. Ninety-five percent of the Mis­sion's homeless population was male in 1954. Forty-five per­cent of the beds have be·en for women and family groups in the last four years. 
Guests must tie in with a caseworker upon arrival at the Hope Rescue Mission. "One of the first things we require a person to do is to set up some goals," said Bert Harrison, ex­eeutive director. 
The Mission also provides Bible studies, chapel services, emergency transportation help, emergency medical help, a

"We'll try to help anybody that comes through the door, but it may not be financial. It might be just to listen to them, but at the very least anybody that comes through that door will be treated with dignity and respect," stated Sara Goetz, coordinator. 
The Advocacy Center has also observed a rise in the number of its clients. "From just 1989 to 1990 it went from 1 300 cases a' year to over 1:600 cases, and it is not dropping," Goetz said. 
Broadway Christian Parish United Methodist Church 1412 South Carroll St., provides a community meal every Sunday for its congregation and the Southeast Side neighborhood of South Bend.

Something needs to be done to help the homeless in a per­manent way. "We need to ap­pro_ac~ th!s t~uough the thr~e

Broadway Christian Parish has bngun an innovative project that creates jobs, The Southeast Side Neighborhood Summer Gardening Project. 
The project will employ 20 young people, provide fresh produce for the feeding pro­grams of the parish and clean up five vacant lots . 
Welfare reform will also be necessary in combatting home­lessness and extreme poverty in South Bend and in the nation. 
A single mother with one child in South Bend currently receives $229 a month. "Women are not having babies so they can get a lot of money because that is just not true in this state," said Goetz. 

National health insurance would benefit the poor, aceord­ing to Goetz. "With the re­sources we have in this country, there is no reason why one child out of eight goes hungry. There is no reason for people not to be able to access afford­able health care." 
A final problem needed to be approached is drug and alcohol abuse, said Goetz. "I don't think the answer is in prisons. I think the answer is in treatment centers," she said. 
'People like people' was the lesson of the day etched on the blackboard of the Advocacy Center. 
Maybe if Americans could remember this simple lesson, children would not go hungry, the sick and mentally ill would not want for treatment. and the homeless would not roam the streets of South Bend.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 

First ND women faced sexism 
Dear Editor: 
I'm visiting the eampus for the w~nkend and have read with great interest your articles on thn SUFH group and it's com­plaints against the University. I empathize with the group as I, too. was part of a minority wlwn I studied at Notre Dame. I was diseriminated against and made to feel unwelcome and unwanted on campus by the student body. Their feelings wnrn justified in some eases. 
For instance, hundreds of stuchmts received letters during the summer break in which they were told they'd been "lotteried" ofT campus; that the University needed their dorm rooms for an expanded incom­ing frAshman class. Naturally, the upperclassmen took their frustrations out on us. I regu­larly heard remarks in the din­ing hall or on South Quad like, "You don't belong here" and "Why don't you go to a school wlwre you belong'?" 
The University discriminated against us. While the rest of the student body had diversions and dubs which they could join and in which they could compete and socialize, we had none. While more than 95 pereent of tlw undergraduate students on eampus had maid service, laun­dry service and dry cleaning snrviee. we had none. While we were supposedly an important part of the University's make­up, we were ignored. Similar groups from other colleges were regularly invited to participate in social events. We weren't excluded per se, but we felt the University had made a statement that we weren't good enough for these events. 
Most of us didn't understand why our fellow students re­sented us and most of us didn't understand why the social at­mosphere was so difficult. On top of the academic and psy­chological challenges of a freshman year at college were added the emotional problems of feeling singled out, not fitting in and always wondering why. 
Through all of this I don't believe I or anyone else in my group truly faulted the University administrators for the situation. Their intentions and goals were righteous. My astonishment was simply that the management of a major in­stitution could have so poorly forecasted and planned the giant change they were at­tempting in the make-up of the student body. 
But we didn't demonstrate; we didn't hold sit-ins; we didn't retaliate with harassment. We organized regular meetings with our rectors and our pro­fessors. When things got to the "ridiculous" stage we held meetings in our halls with Fa­ther Burtchaell and Sister Miriam John. We worked with the University to make their original plan a success. 

It wasn't easy, smooth, nor without arguments. Having made the decision to create an enrollment that more realisti­cally reflected the national pic­ture, the University officials never stopped or refused to discuss how to develop an at­mosphere that would encourage others like myself to attend the school. 
The experiences I had at Notre Dame are with me every day of my life. The difficulties taught me how to change the status quo from within and how to compromise. The years at Notre Dame, however, could never fully prepare me for the prejudices in the real world of industry, but it was a good start. I might have been part of a minority group and we might have been unintentionally discriminated against, but women were a new phe­nomenon at Notre Dame in 1973. 
The one thing that was always apparent was that the Univer­sity was committed to making the transition work and I be­lieve they are equally committed to making a success of a more diverse student body. The commitment is 90 percent of the battle: the logistics usually work themselves out.

Students should take action to end campus apathy 
Does it ever bother any of you that we are growing up in the most apathetic time in history? Sometimes it seems like no one cares anymore. 
Here we are, content to sit at good ol' Notre Dame as we work away on our homework, making sure that we get our good grades so that we can get a good job or get into a good school when we graduate. Some people around here are so stressed out about making the Dean's List that they never stop to laugh at a good joke (or at life) once in a while. 
We'll end up in our nice ca­reers, we'll raise our families, and then we'll all die, and we'll all be forgotten without having actually achieved anything. Face it: most of us won't really make it into the history texts, and you sure can't avoid death. It's coming, like it or not, and you can't do a damn thing about it. 
Matthew Miller Column 0' Thrills 

Doesn't it bother you that, with a very few exceptions, that's what we'll all end up do­ing? Granted, there will be some of us who end up as politicians (and what an impact they do make!) or great scien­tists. But, for the most part, we're stuck into that rut be­cause that's just what everyone before us has done. 
Nicely put, our world is screwed. Man has single-hand­edly destroyed the environment (which, incidentally, doesn't be­long to him in the first place), causing huge health risks for future generations. One in ev­ery thirty African-American males will die a violent death. There have been over 120 wars on earth since 1945, and they are the cause of over 3 million deaths. Despots all over the world are killing people by the millions. 
So what do we do about it? How do we escape the pattern of complacency? How do we improve the world which we complain about daily in The Observer? Get involved. If you're worried about the thou­sands of political prisoners be­ing tortured all around the globe, join Amnesty Interna­tional. If you're worried about the environment, talk to Earth First!, an environmental action group that's not afraid to take a stand. Concerned about the homeless? Help at a soup kitchen. Do you want to help America's poor? Join the Ap­palachia service trip. Never think that your little bit won't help. If everyone thought that, no one would get anything done. 
If there's something you don't like about the University, go out and try to change it. Be­lieve me: people do listen to what you have to say. Do you think that Notre Dame doesn't give out ·enough financial aid to its students? Do you feel that the University should recognize the gay & lesbian group on campus? Don't like parietals? Do you think that DART is woefully inadequate? Write a letter, circulate a petition, do something. If you don't bring the issue into a public forum, no one will know how you feel. 
So don't just sit there, reading this semi-aimless column over your lunch tray. Think, just for a moment, about what really isn't just in this world, and think of a way that you can work toward a solution. Never stop striving for justice. If there's something wrong, it is our duty to put an end to it. You've got a voice-use it.

The resolution was careful to mention, in a footnote, that federal law may require the ex­tension of this benefit to men as well as women. But the doc­ument goes on to assure the reader that, being a private University, we can dispense with such trivial notions of equality. 
As a faculty wife, a law stu­dent, and a mother, I would like this opportunity to explain to Professor Kmiec why this pro­sity, has no right to dictate my lifestyle. Kmiec has no right to impose his idea of "family" on the faculty and staff of this University. 
I am not, as Kmiec says, "antagonistic to the family." am antagonistic to a view that allows only one kind of family-his kind.

Some Notre Dame faeulty members will travel to Australia for the beginning of the January to Oetober 1992 session but Link was "not at liberty to say" who they were. Link also said he has reeeived ealls from eollege faeulty all over the eountry expressing interest in teaehing at the sehool. 
Link himself will only be staying in Australia one year. One of Link's primary goals is to find a permanent president for the sehool. preferably a native Australian. He said it was "very important to have an Australian president. But right now nobody there has mueh experienee in Catholie tertiary edueation." 
A little over one-third of the eountry is Roman Catholie but the ratio is slightly higher in the western part of the eountry, where the sehool is loeated. 
To emphasize NDA's wish to be a fixture in the Paeifie rim, the sehool was loeated on the western eoast instead of near Sydney or Melbourne, Australia's two major eities. 
Link, a "great believer in pri­vale universities," said "it's hard to imagine a eountry of that size with only one private university." There are no legal or financial bonds between the two schools but Notre Dame will offer NDA guidance in its first years. 
Student and faeulty exehanges will be the main part of this relationship. Stressing gradual growth for the school. Notre Dame students will not be able to visit the Australian eampus until the August 1992 term.

Bobby Cremins remains silent about Irish vacancy 
Falcons continue to have trouble on and off the field 
Holyfield-Foreman fight expected to gross $75 million 
SOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP) -Tlw clamor of speculation is rising, but Georgia Tech bas­kntball coach Bobby Cremins is kePping his silenee. 
Broadeast reports suggested that Cremins would be named Notnl Dame basketball coach this wenk to replace Digger Phelps, who retired April 15 after 20 seasons. 
Cremins. in Columbia, S.C., for his induction Thursday into the stat11's Athletic Hall of Fame, wouldn't talk about the Notrn Dame job. 
Asked about the Notre Dame job WednP.sday at a reception for him, Cremins said: "This is a private party. I don't have any eomment now." 
ESPN reportnd Tuesday night that Cremins is the lea_Ping 
ATlANTA (AP)-EvenL'l have not gone well for the Atlanta Fakons over tlw past few years -on or on· tho field. 
The Falcons latest problem involves Walter Sutton, the team's 1Oth-round pick in Monday's NFL draft. Turns out Sutton, a wide receiver from Southwest State (Minn.), is a convicted craek dealer. And the Falcons knew it. 
"He saw his wrongdoing and turned himself -and the others who got him involved ­in to the proper authorities," Ken llerock, Falcons vice pres­ident of player personnel, said Wednesday. "That's why the judge let him continue to go to college and why he's been a model citizen through a parole officer program since his arrest. 
"At this time, I think the judge Is the only one who can pass judgment on Walter, and so far it's been favorable. Our understanding and feeling is that there's not going to be any jail term." 
NEW YORK (AP) -The Evander Holyfield-George Foreman fight will gross an estimated $75 million world­wide, record revenues that bode well not only for boxing but also for the pay-per-view television business. 
On Wednesday, TVKO announced figures that repre­sent industry records not only

for gross revenues but also for viewership. 
With 75 percent of the 1,200 cable systems reporting, TVKO projected total U.S. revenues of about $55 million, based on sales to 1. 5 million or more homes at $35.95 apiece. 
According to figures compiled by industry analyst Paul Kagan, the next highest-grossing event candidate to replace Phelps. Prime Ticket, a Southern California-based cable TV ser­vice, cited unidentified sources in reporting Cremins would be named today. 
But Notre Dame athletic di­rector Dick Rosenthal said the school probably won't name a coaeh this week. 
Two of Phelps' former assis­tants emerged Wednesday as possible replacements. 
John Shumate of Southern Methodist said he has accepted Notre Dame's invitation to dis­cuss the job, The Dallas Morning News reported. 
"Whether I'm offered the job or not offered the job, I'm happy where I am," said Shumate, a former Phelps as­sistant. 
Controversy is nothing new to the Falcons, who hired tough­talking Jerry Glanville to coach the team back to respectability. In his two seasons, the Falcons won just eight games. 
Off the field, there has been tragedy and run-ins with the law involving players and a coach: 
-In 1988, defensive back David Croudip died of a cocaine overdose. 
-In 1989, two Falcons were killed in car crashes -tight end Brad Beckman {in December) and rookie tackle Ralph Norwood a month earlier. 
-In 1990, draft picks Steve Broussard and Mike Pringle were involved in a barroom brawl at college but never charged; linebacker Aundray Bruce was placed on probation for allegedly threatening a pizza deliveryman with a BB gun; interim coach Jim Hanifan was arrested and charged with drunken driving and simple battery for allegedly striking an in pay-per-view history was the Holyfield-Buster Douglas fight last October at $38.6 million. 
The fight was seen in 62 countries, and they should help bring the total to $75 million, Abraham said, of which about $38 million to $40 million goes to the promotion team of TVKO, Bob Arum and Dan Duva. 
TVKO's next show on May 10 
Nebraska's Danny Nee, an­other former assistant under Phelps, has also been men­tioned as a candidate. Nee says Notre Dame hasn't contacted him. 
"All I'm doing is recruiting and working for Nebraska," he said. 
Former Virginia coach Terry Holland, now athletic director at Davidson, has been included as well. 
"If they wanted to talk, I would certainly consider a situ­ation like this," Holland said. 
AI McGuire, a former Marquette coach, says Notre Dame's decision to stay outside a conference hurts the Irish at­tempts to find a new coach. 
"Some of the big names that came up right away, like

And now Sutton, who is from Fort Myers, Fla., the same hometown as Falcons corner­back Deion Sanders. 
Last September, Sutton pleaded guilty in U.S. District Court in Fort Myers to two counts of conspiracy to possess and distribute more than 50 grams of crack cocaine between 1986 and 1988, federal court records show. 
U.S. District Judge Elizabeth Kovachevich sentenced Sutton in February to nine years in prison, but she allowed him to return to college to get his de­gree in sociology before report­ing to prison on Jan. 28, 1992. 
NFL communications director Greg Aiello said the league did not know about Sutton's con­viction and added that he didn't believe any exceptions were made to allow Sutton to enter the draft. Aiello would not say if the NFL excludes convicted felons from its draft. 
Sutton's Fort Myers lawyer, will feature IBF middleweight champion Michael Nunn and Olympic silver medalist Michael Carbajal in a pair of fights. The summer programs will be de­voted to heavyweights and could provide a challenger for Holyfield should negotiations between Holyfield's promoter, Duva, and Don King fall through for a fight with Mike Cremins and P.J. Carlesirrio (of Seton Hall), have great setups in their conferences," McGuire told the South Bend Tribune. "I mean, why would you want to leave that, although I think Cremins would listen. 
"But Notre Dame is going to have to jump to a conference. They're having problems al­ready, not just with this but with scheduling. And it's going to get worse." 
When Phelps retired, he said he doubted the school could continue as an independent. 
The timing of Phelps' retire­ment was nobody's fault, McGuire said. 
"But the best time to fill a job is just before the Final Four," he said. "Then you can go to the 
Bob Coleman, said the judge's order requires him to stay in school until he graduates, then go to prison. Sutton was re­leased from custody on a $100,000 bond posted by his parents, records show. 
But Sutton's lawyer in Minnesota, Roy Henline, said the player might be able to at­tend the Falcons' training camp this summer, and then finish his college education in the fall. Sutton is scheduled to graduate in November. 
"It is my understanding that if I continue to do the positive things that I have been doing ... they will take into account how I have been progressing," Sutton said Wednesday in an interview with the Independent of Marshall. 
"I can't speak for the judge, but I feel I have changed since then, and the way I have been carrying myself will determine whether I go to prison or not," Sutton said. 
Sutton had been in trouble 
before. In 1987, he was sen­tenced to 18 months probation on state drug possession charges. He said Wednesday that he had learned from his mistakes. 
"I was young, and it was a way to make some fast money," he said. "I never sold it out on the streets. I just took it to a person. I got involved because my girlfriend's brother was a big dealer. I just helped him de­liver it and that led to other things. I left Fort Myers because I knew that wasn't for me. I have never done drugs in my life. "But what I did was wrong, and I can't change that." 
His college football offensive coordinator, Brent Jeffers, said both the Falcons and the league were told of Sutton's conviction and sentencing before the team drafted him. 
"They were never misled," Jeffers said. "He's always been real up front with us about his situation. He's very honest." 
coaches' convention, get all your ducks in a row. 
"But now people have made a commitment to their recruits, to next year." 
McGuire speculated the Irish probably wouldn't consider anyone who offers the slim cre­dentials Phelps brought in 1971 -a single, although successful, season at Fordham with a 26-3 record. 
"I don't think they would take a chance that like, because of Gerry Faust," McGuire said. 
Faust, a former Notre Dame football coach, had no college experience when he came to the Irish from Moeller High School in Cincinnati. He left for Akron after a disappointing five-year tenure. 
Tyson. 
The IBF and WBA have called for a June 11 deadline for King and Duva to come to agreement on terms for a fight since Tyson, the former champion, is the No. 1-ranked contender. If they have not come to terms by then, the fight will go to purse bids. 
Asked about King's suggestion for a winner-take-all fight, Duva said: 
"Evander doesn't want Mike to have to fight that hard and earn nothing."

Danapilis followed by crushing a pitch off the left field wall. While the Irish coaching staff disputed in favor of a home run, the umpires the ruled that the ball stayed in play for a two-RBI triple. 
Ironically, Danapilis, the cleanup hitter who keyed the ninth inning run with a sacri­fice, also earned the victory. The right fielder, who threw three pitches to get the final out in the top of the ninth, raised his record to 1-1. 
While the game had an abundance of comical or con­fusing moments, it also had a few highlights expected of two nationally rated teams. One example, besides Danapilis. Layson, and Coss, was the de­fensive play of Dan Bautch, who graciously toured the spa­cious center-field area at Coveleski Stadium to make sev­eral breathtaking catches.

Bookstore hits Sweet 16; Tequila number one seed 
By DAVE McMAHON 
Associate Sports Editor 
About 350 games ago, close to 700 teams started with the dream of journeying to the fi­nals of Bookstore Basketball 
XX. As the intensity level in­creased in visible form Wednesday during Bookstore Basketball XX action, the teams decreased, leaving only the Sweet 16 to vie for the coveted title for the annual rite of spring. 
Top-seeded "Tequila White Lightning X" put on its best show of the tournament, as sophomore Eric Jones, against a man-to-man defense, took control with 12 points in a 21-8 win over "Shoot or Get Off." 
"Eric Jones had one of the best games I've ever seen from a big man," said "Tequila's" Shannon Cullinan. "He's the quickest big guy on campus, and it's great to have Jim Dolan contributing, too." 
Primarily a team that relies on strong inside play from Jones, "Tequila" has been wont to increase the offensive tempo. 
"Although some people don't consider us a running team, we like to turn it up when we can," said Cullinan. 
"Tequila" faces 16th-seed "Julius and 4 Other Guys" in their Sweet 16 opener. 
While Cullinan was surprised at the top ranking due to a few close games in the opening round, he feels that at least one other team has dominated from the outset. 
"We've had some pretty tough games, and 'Adworks' has been nothing short of phenomenal in their games, so we didn't really expect the top spot." 
After taking an 11-10 lead at the beginning of the second half, "Adworks" put on a pres­sure defense that virtually shut down "Cullliflower, Crud, Silk of Magnesia, Chief, and Doctor Dumb" in a 21-14 win. 
Dorsey Levins (seven points) and Derrick Johnson (six} paced ' the All-Stars. 
"Malicious Prosecution" snagged the third seed with an impressive 21-15 victory over Kevin Ellery's "X-Force" squad. 
"Gaucho's", behind the most balanced scoring effort of Wednesday's action, rolled past "Commons Club", 21-12. 
Dave Bose contributed five points, while Pete DiGiovanni, Tom O'Connell, and Rob Vasquez each had four points for the winners. 
"Bose is pretty much carrying us right now," said DiGiovanni. "We play our best when we run, and he's been holding us to­gether when we've had to rely on outside shooting." 

After losing in the Round of 16 last year, "Gaucho's" is hoping for a longer stay this time around. 
"We're pretty excited to be seeded fifth," said Mike Toner. "We expected to make the top ten, but four really came as a surprise." 
Fifth seed "Gina's Pizza" ben­efitted from 12-of-23 shooting from Kyle and Chris Garlitz in rolling to a 21-6 win over "No Clue", which played with only four players for about three­quarters of the game. 
"Gina's", after a trip to the Final 32 last year, expected at least an equal performance in this year's Bookstore tourna­ment. 
"We knew we could do a little bit better this year," said Chris Garlitz. "We've got three guards who shoot well from the outside, but our defense is what really carries us." 
The combination of two con­secutive quality Bookstore tournaments likely played a role in their ranking. 
"We ended up higher than we thought we would," said Garlitz. "We figured we'd be around lOth, so we're pretty happy with our position." 
John Rapchinski poured in seven points and Demetrius DuBose added five as "4 Men With an Attitude" outlasted "Off Campus Crime", 21-18. 
Seeded sixth, "4 Men" are on a mission that they anticipate will last for a few more games. 
"We're not in it to lose," said Rapchinski. "Everything's coming together for us right now. There are a lot of great teams out there, bu I haven't seen anyone that we wouldn't be able to match up against." 
While "4 Men" uses DuBose as their "go to" man, they have played together long enough to know that someone will step forward when the pressure moments come. 
After falling in last year's Round of 64 to "Just Chillin", the nucleus of the team is sat­isfied with their sixth seed, but is by no means content. 
"Bareback Cowboys" rode their way into the seventh seed with a 21-16 win over veterans "V's Revenge". Seniors Stu Healy and Pete Parten pumped out six points each and Corey Lawrence pulled down eight re­bounds, leading the Alumni Hall squad into today's matchup against "McCormick's Coney Island." 
"Bareback" strives for an up­tempo offensive show, comple­mented with a strong perfor­mance on the boards. 
Eighth-seeded "Just Chillin"a Final 8 participant last year, strengthened their defensive game en route to a 21-8 win against "Barking Cliff Chickens". 
"We played well as a team, and our passing was better than it has been," said "Chillin" junior Joe Fulton. 
"Fighting Kernals II", behind eight points from Russ Allegrette and six from Brad Leshnock sailed past "I'd Rather be Skiing ... ", 21-10, to grab the 14th seed. 
"We full court pressed them into a lot of mistakes," said sophomore Pete Tulchinsky. "Today was our best played game of the tournament. Our goal was to make the Sweet 16, and now we hope we can take that a little farther." · 
Raghib 'Rocket' Ismail didn't back up accusation 
When Raghib Ismail launched himself toward Canada over the weekend, he made every effort to make the New England Patriots choke on his exhaust fumes. 
Through his agent, Ed Abram, Ismail accused the Patriots' director of player relations, Joe Mendes, of making a racist remark. The Associated Press reports that Mendes suggested that Ismail lower his asking price in Ken Tysiac preliminary contact talks with 


the ex-Irish superstar. 90-91 Assoc. Sports Editor When Ismail looked away from Mendes, the Patriots' executed allegedly told Ismail that he had the attention span of Tim Worley. Worley, a running back for the Pittsburgh Steelers, is black, as is Ismail. How do the above statements add up to a racist remark? Good question. Perhaps Ismail would like to explain it himself. The fact of the matter is that Worley, in negotiations with the Steelers, held out for a substantial amount of money and has been criticized for being lazy and unproductive. It is possible that the Rocket might have suffered from a an attention deficit similar to Worley's when he found out that nobody in the National Football League was prepared to pay him the type of money commanded by Jeff George and Troy Aikman, the top picks in the past two drafts. If that was the case, Mendes would have been justified in comparing Ismail to Worley. It may have been merely a coincidence that they are both black. After all, approximately 60 percent of the players in the NFL are black. If Ismail is going to accuse Mendes, or anybody, for that matter, of racism, he owes it to them to back it up. In this case it doesn't appear that he did. As for jumping for the big bucks and going to Canada, it appears that Ismail is convinced that money can buy happiness for him. The 26 million dollars he is likely to earn in his contract with the Toronto Argonauts of the Canadian Football League will make him a very wealthy man. Maybe it will. If it does, we should all wish him the best of luck. Toronto is a great city, although it may not be the apex of cultural diversity that Ismail believes it is. If he enjoys himself there, that's all that matters. But if he ever had any concern about proving his doubters wrong, the CFL is not the place to do that. All of the critics who say that he will never be an impact player in the NFL will be right if he spends the rest of his career in Canada. If the added financial incentive eliminates Ismail's desire to prove he can play with the best, then the Canadian route is the best one for him. If not, let's hope somebody in the United States welcomes him back to the negotiating table after he saddled one NFL negotiator with an unsubstantiated charge of racism.
