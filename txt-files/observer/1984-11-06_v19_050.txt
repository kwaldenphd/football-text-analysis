Walter Mondale's last, best hope for a miraculous up­set in today's election rests with a silent vote composed of women who may support him in greater numbers than they've been willing to admit and a black and Hispanic minority that might be bigger than people think. "Along -yvith the undercounted minority, we have the discounted majority," said Ann Lewis, political director for the Dem­ocratic Party. Women are expected to be about 53 percent of the electorate this year. Lewis said she and other party operatives encounter many women who identify with Democratic vice presidential candidate Geraldine Ferraro "but insist, 'don't use my name, don't tell my husband, don't tell my ex.'

Let's get back to work 
At last, today it is finally over. 

It seems this presidential campaign has lasted forever. The Iowa caucus was Feburary 20th and eight days later New Hampshire held the first of the many primaries that we were bombarded with the results of. Does it seem possible both of these events were actu­ally this year? 
Finally, by tonight, we will know who is to be our president for the next four years. But, a little over two years will pass before the in{:umbent has to start seriously preparing for the next campaign. 
Personally, I will be glad when this election is over. I 
am getting tired of political announcements, commer­
cials, mailings, and the news being full of what the can-
dictates have done and said that day. 
A friend said yesterday that it would be OK with him 
if the election was not held for another couple of 
months because he finds it "exciting.'' I just can't get 
excited about an election in which the pollsters are 
talking about the possibility of a record-setting landslide. This election, especially of late, hasn't exactly provided us with a great amount of suspense as to the outcome. 
A worker in the Mondale-Ferraro campaign said last night she wished the elec­tion was not for a while be­cause if held later, the Democratic ticket might have a better chance. That' may be true, but how much time do they really want? Campaigning started close to two years ago. 
There seems to almost be a feeling of futility and of wasted time with this cam­paign lately. Very few reasonable people will tell you they have any doubt about the outcome oftoday's contest. We need to settle this election and get on with the business ofrunning the country. There are more significant issues for the press and the public to focus on than who wore more makeup in the latest presidential debate or the finances of the Democratic vice presidential candidate's husband. 
From a purely practical point of view, the public is 
not getting what it is paying for in government if our 
elected officials are campaigning for office for close to 
half their term, rather than governing. Can a president 
who is spending a significant amount of his time away 
from Washington campaigning really govern the 
country as he was elected to do? It doesn't seem likely. 
During the campaign it seems nothing ofimportance 
is accomplished. The incumbt:nts are too busy cam­
paigning to be doing a lot of ~ignificant work, and of 
course they don't want to enact any law that would dis­
please any section ofthe electorate.

Wouldn't the public interest be better served if the campaign was shorter, so that those elected to office could spend more time doing the job they were elected to do and less time making sure they will be elected again? 
Election campaigns are not a bad thing nor should they be abolished. They produce a lot of good results. They get the candidates out among the people and force them to at least appear as if they are listening to the voters. Although many campaign promises end up 
-==-~
--==--. unfulfilled, we do know the 
candidates are at least think­
ing about the issues people 
are concerned with. 
Maybe we need to set the 
primaries and caucuses 
closer to the election and to 
have some sort of laws 
regulating how early before 
an election a candidate can 
campaign. But, what we 
really need right now more 
than anything is rest -rest 
from campaign rhetoric and 
posturing and from political 
commercials and mailings. 
The quicker today's winner 
settles into the job of run­
ning the country and heals 
political wounds the better. 
The problems facing the nation won't be dissipated by campaign promises or whistle-stop tours. Progress can be made on them ifthe victor in today's election puts the election as far behind us as possible and starts to work on them. It's as if we have spent time in limbo, time in which very little has been done by our elected officials except to make sure they have the same position for another term. 
Let's put the election behind us and get on with life.

Essays on media ethics published by ND Press 
Spedal to The Observer 
"The Responsibilities of Journalism," edited by Robert Schmuhl, assistant professor of American Studies at Notre Dame, has recently been published by the University of Notre Dame Press. 
The book is a collection of essays arising from a conference convened at Notre Dame under Schmuhl's di­rection to study the ethical prob­lems of contemporary journalism. Contributors include Edwin New­man, veteran br<)adcast journalist and author of "Strictly Speaking"; syndicated columnist Georgie Anne Geyer; Father Edward Malloy, asso· date professor of theology and Fa· ther Oliver Williams, adjunct associate professor of management at Notre Dame; Jeff Greenfield, synd­icated columnist and commentator for ABC news; Max Lerner, synd­icatc:d columnist and John E. Swearingen, Standard Oil executive. 
According to Phil Record, prc:si­dent of the Society of Professional Journalists, Sigma Delta Chi, "'Ibis book is so pertinent to our times, and if we are to become responsible: journalists...we should heed the les­sons and admonistions it contains." 
Sl·hmuhl graduated from Notre Dame in 1970 and receivc:d his master's and doctoral degrees from Indiana University in 1978.J:Ie joined the Notre Dame faculty in 1980. In 1983, he received the Clarion Award for his direnion of the "Responsibilities of Journalism" conference the year before. 


Bulletin to be revived by University Ministry 
By MATTHEW DOlAN 
News Staff 
Notre Dame's Religious Bulletin, a 
campus newsletter once described 
as "the most palatable one-a-day 
spiritual vitamin ever compounded 
for college students" has been 
revived by the Office of University 
Ministry. 
The bulletin originally appeared in 1921 and was a prominent feature of student life. It was organized by Father John O'Hara, who was Notre Dame's dean of religious affairs before becoming University presi· dent and later Cardinal Archbishop 
of Philadelphia. 
"Informally it was referred to as 'letter from God"' said Father Frank Gartland, a former editor of the bul­letin in the late thirties. 
Popularity of the bulletin grew, and by Sept. 1938, there was a cir­culation of 18,000, according to Gartland. Other colleges and neacly every Catholic high school in the country wanted a copy. 
The revised bulletin will be a weekly distribution to Notre Dame students at Sunday masses in Sacred Heart Church and copies will be put under student's doors. 
"Originally we gave the rectors 
about ten copies to post around the 
halls but response has been so posi­
tive, we arc now distributiflB tbc 
bulletin to all the student's rooms," 
said Father Daniel Jenky, director of 
Campus Ministry. 
Campus Ministry members said they decided to resurrect the bulle­tin because they saw the need to communicate the message of the church. 
"We saw the bulletin as a way communicating to the students the way a parish bulletin communicates to it's parish," saidJenky. 
The bulletin is organized by Fa­ther-Steve Gibson, Prescilla Wong and Margaret Garvey. It is designed to carry church announcements, mass schedules, and religious read­ings. 
"We want the bulletin to be a simple reading that students can read quickly," saidjenky. 
Jenky said altough the demand for copies has been very high, the bul­leting will remain a weekly for the time being because there is not enough information for it to be printed daily.

Experts explore ethics of baboon transplant 
By PAT CONLIN 
News Staff 
The life of a human must always 
take precedence over an animal, 
even if it means the death of the 
animal, said Father Edward Malloy, 
University associate provost. Malloy 
was referring to the recent 
transplant of a baboon's heart to an 
infant. 
The child, nicknamed "Baby Fae," 
has reached the tenth day consid­
ered critical in organ transplants. 
The landmark operation and its 
medical and ethical ramifications 
are now being examined by experts 
across the country. 
"I have no problem with the priority of saving a human life over an animal's life. Of course the life of an animal must be respected, but in a critical situation, a human life must be saved," said Father Edward Mal­loy, University associate provost, and noted expert on medical ethics. "I have a question about whether we should finance advanced tech­nological surgery like this, or put funds toward things that would benefit the majority." 
Professor David Sever, chairman of the biology department at Saint Mary's said, "Anything to save a 
human life is proper. Ifthey had had 
the luxury of time they should have 
looked longer for a human heart. 
This should not be experimental 
surgery." 
This type of surgery is unprece· 
dented. Cross species organ 
transplants are a relatively new area 
in the field of medicine. Research 
has been done with animal-to­
animal transplants, but the baboon 
transplant is the first in animal-to­
human surgery. · 
According to Sever, "it (the · baboon heart) will have to be 
replaced with a human heart fairly 
soon. I can't imagine a baboon heart 
functioning in a human, once it has 
grown beyond the size ofa baboon." 
Questions have arisen as to the validity of this particular case and the necessity of performing the op­eration on this child. Some have speculated a human heart could have been found in time to save Baby Fae. Malloy further said, "There is a pressure on scientists to do something radical to improve their own reputation, to gain recognition. The context in which this surr,ery is used must be ex­amined."

FLOC supporters aim for better working conditions 
ByJOHN HINES 
News Staff 
Extremely low wages for farm laborers is one reason the Campbell Company is being criticized by agricultural workers, according to Notre Dame student Dennis Arec­higa. 
Arechiga is co-president of the Notre Dame chapter of the Farm Labor Organizing Committee, a. group of farm workers who have been conducting a national boycott ofCampell and Libby products since January, 1979, to get to the bargain­ing table with Campbell's. 
"The goal of FLOC is to obtain 
AssociatedPress 
WARSAW, Poland -Authorities charged an Interior Ministry colonel yesterday with assisting in the kid­napping and murder of a pro­Solidarity priest. A dissident said church officials were keeping a "terrifying" autopsy report secret to 
maintain calm. 
The official news agency PAP carried an Interior Ministry com­munique saying Col. Adam Pietruszka had been arrested and charged with "aiding and abetting" in the kidnapping and killing of the Rev. )erzy Popieluszko. 
Dissident historian Jan )ozef Lipski, a member of the now­disbanded .workers' rights group KOR, told journalists he had learned from church sources that "the doc­tor's description of the body and what most probably happened is ter­rifying and could heat up the present tense emotions." 
Pietruszka, described by PAP as deputy director ofan unspecified In­terior Ministry department, was the fourth ministry official charged in connection with the case. 
A captain and two lieutenants in the secret police face kidnapping charges, and a government spokes­man said the three either have already been charged with the kil­ling or will be charged soon. 
Government spokesman )erzy Ur­ban told Tbe Assoctateti Press in a telephone interview that he did not know whether murder charges had been filed against the three, "but if this has not been done, as far as I know, the prosecutor's office will charge them with the killing." 
PAP said the prosecutor general did not find grounds to charge an-three way bargaining between farm owners, The Campbell Company and the farm workers. The national organization has concentrated on Campbell because Campbell is the biggest and most observable," said Arechiga. 
At Notre Dame, FLOC has been successful at eliminating the use of Campbell products in The Huddle, Corby Hall, Moreau Seminary, the North and South Dining Halls, and most of the dorm food sales on campus. 
The fact that the Campbell Com­pany forces independent farmers to either pay their migrant farm workers very low wages (averaging Jl.96 per hour) or to increase their mechanization process, thus com­pletely eliminating the need for mi­
grant farm laborers, is the major point ofgrievance. 
"It definitely bothers Campbell that Notre Dame, a well-known insti­tution, has passed the boycott, but in my opinion it has a long way to go still," said Arechiga. 
"Their argument is that they (The Campbell Company) do not employ any farm workers. They are neglect­ing the fact that they are entirely re­sponsible for the wages and living conditions of the workers. 


Polish government official tied to the kidnap and murder of priest 
other colonel arrested Friday. It said he faced possible "disciplinary procedures" within the ministry. 
An official who took part in the autopsy refused to comment on reports that Popieluszko had been beaten, but confirmed earlier that the priest had been thrown into the water with his hands and ankles bound, and a rope tied around his neck so he would choke if he struggled.

U.S. hopes for Soviet approval of new anti-chemical weapons treaty 
r Associated Press 
r WASHINGTON· U.S. arms control r officials are hoping for Soviet ap­r proval of a new anti-chemical weap· ons treaty which would give each of~ the superpowers the right to make unprecedented and wide-ranging in· 
r 
' 
spections ofthe other side's military r 
and government facilities.
r 
The proposed treaty, which has

the ongoing 40-nation Geneva dis·

r 
armament talks, is now the subject 
r 
of intense discussion among U.S. allies, according to sources who spoke only on condition they not be identified. Douglas Feith, deputy assistant secretary ofdefense for negotiations policy, said in a recent interview that the U.S. treaty "is totally un· precedented. We've never made an offer like this." The heart ofthe U.S. proposal is an offer to permit "special inspections" of all government facilities, includ· ing any military installations, along with all "government-controlled facilities," which would include private companies doing contract work. That would permit the Soviets to inspect a wide range ofU.S. facilities ifthey wanted, even the Pentagon or the White House, Feith acknowl­edged. But the United States would have the same right to look at Soviet facilities, something the Russians have never granted, he noted. With polls showing President Reagan likely to win re-election, the arms control policies which would be pursued in a second Reagan ad· ministration are now under review by advisers who are divided on how

Investigation begins in Gandhi assassination 
Associated Press 
NEW DELHI, India · The ashes of 
Indira Gandhi were sent out to the 
distant corners of India yesterday as 
her son and successor struggled to 
keep new violence from flaring 
across this bloodied, embittered 
land. 
The worst of the deadly anti-Sikh 
reprisals for Prime Minister Gandhi's 
assassination subsided over the 
weekend, but at least three people 
were reported killed yesterday in 
New Delhi · two Sikhs burned to 
death, and one person shot dead by 
snipers said to be Sikhs. 
Other deaths were reported in Sikh-populated Punjab state. 
Rajiv Gandhi, the new prime mini· ster, asked the Indian Supreme Court's chief justice, Y.V. Chandrac­hud, to head a commission to inves­tigate Mrs. Gandhi's slaying last Wednesdayby two men identified as Sikh members of her security guard, the news agency United News ofln· dia said. 
Unsubstantiated newspaper reports persisted ofa high-level mili· tary conspiracy behind the assas­sination. Justice Chandrachud was expected to give his reply soon to Gandhi's request, UNI said. 
One of the assassins was killed by 

other Gandhi guards, but the 
second, identified as Satwant Singh, 
survived with gunshot wounds and 
was listed in serious condition yes­
terday at a New Delhi hospital. 
Reports conflicted on whether Sat· 
want Singh was well enough to be 
interrogated. 
In the chill gray dawn yesterday, about 36 hours after Mrs. Gandhi's bodywas cremated on a sandalwood pyre beside the Yamuna River, her son returned to help collect her ashes. 
On Saturday, in a final ceremony, the ashes will be scattered over the snow-capped Himalayas beloved by Mrs. Gandhi. 
The rioting that exploded after her assassination took more than 1,000 lives, mostly Sikhs, in one of the worst sieges of communal vio· lence since the Hindu-Moslem carnage at the time of partition of the subcontinent in 1947. 
Over 500 were reported slain in New Delhi alone, many of them Sikhs slaughtered Thursday and Friday in a poor district of east New Delhi.

Realizing the kind of civilization we are 
Equating Pro-Life with anti-women 

At the l·nd ofthe campaign, with little doubt about victor and vanquisht:d, the historian will observe that everyone was trying to fig· ure out what it all proved-if anything. 
Did it prove that "issues" don't count for much In a media-oriented culture, that charisma does count, that debates are tricky 
Max Lerner 
The Lerner column 
and dangerous, that a campaign can get pretty nasty with steamy epithets and wild distor­tions or that voters don't behave as pundits want them to? 
All this, yes, and much more. For me the campaign has shown the kind of civilization we are, warts and all. 
It is a civilization ruled by fears, and both candidates have tried to exploit them. The big fears cluster around the economy and around nuclear war and terrorist deaths. Walter Mondale has gone after both, fixing on the budget deficit and on arms control and "star wars." Ronald Reagan has gone after the fears ofhigher taxes and spending. 
Somehow, through the whole campaign, a third major lurking fear has surfaced -that of ethnic and religious divisiveness. The Jesse jackson blacks feel the election has bypassed them, and the Southern whites feel threatened by the racial overtones of the black registra­tion drive. 
The Jews in turn feel caught between the menace of a Left black anti-Semitism with roots in mideast Arab-Israeli tensions, and a movement of Evangelicals on the Right to a "Christian" America. 
It isn't pretty, but it is what happens in presidential elections. Alas, by the very nature of our democracy, any national referendum, packing such high power stakes, is bound to stir fears and divisions. 
Since Mondale is the attacker and lacks the incumbent's record and persona, he has had to explore for fears, hoping that one of them would break out of the Pandora's box and sweep him to an unimaginable victory. 
It hasn't, not even the one that trembled for a precarious shining moment on the edge of Mondale's hope chest -the question of Reagan's age. So Mondale is back now with a litany ofall the fears, gambling that where no one of them alone could achieve a breakthrough and avert a Reagan landslide, all of them together might. 
President Reagan, by his nature and posi­tion, has had to move away from most of the fears and divisions. Since he is likely to win, he would have been an idiot to want an election campaign that further would tear up a civiliza­tion over which he will be presiding until 1989-and his party probably even longer. 
Moreover, a sunny, affirmative mood goes with his image and his public outlook on the future. He hao; used them to play the politics of hope and national pride and to appeal espe­cially to the young and even to Gary Hart's "yuppies." 
Despite all the fears and divisions, I suspect that American civilization has moved a bit closer to a state of equilibrium than it did in 1980 -and with it the world hao;, too. lbis edging toward some sort of balanct' -In jobs and production, in arms, In world prestige -is what America's allies and even Its enemies respolld to. It is the stuffofa period of realign­ment.

In most discussions ofabortion in an atmo­sphere like Notre Dame, two basic ao;sump­tions are usually present. 'Ibe first assumption Is that pro-choice people are the villains in the drama; they are the ones keeping the abortion mllls In business. lbe second assumption is 
Ann Pettifer 
guest column 
that pro-life people are the heroes, waging war on this terrible social evil and that their triumph Is necessary If we are to see any dedine in the abortion statistics. 
Rut what if ao;sumption number one is wide of the mark and assumption number two Is wrong? Is there any evidence that might be marshalled to support the charge that pro-life people actually contribute to keeping the abortion clinics supplied with client? There is. In what follows, I hope to suggest where that evidence Is to be found. 
When reading the literature and watching 
documentaries on abortion, one striking fact emerges -most women having abortions see themselves ao; powerless. Powerlessness produces alienation in relation to self (otherwise why would these women be un­willingly pregnant?) and an extention of that alienation is a psychological numbness towards the embryo. Because a dramatic re­duction in the capacity for ethical nuance is a major result of the poverty of alienation, It would make better sense for those of us who find abortion repellent, to take a good look at the factors that contribute to the alienation and poverty of the women who wind up in abortion clinics; it would be a damn sight more constructive than cursing or patroniz­ing them. 
Terrorizing, deprecating, lecturing or con­sidering women who have abortions has proved the most counter-productive strategy immaginable. It manifestly has not saved fetuses. Why then Is this tactic still pursued? Is there, perhaps, another agenda at work in the right-to-life groups? I think there Is. 
Women and men who are pro-choice, wo-
Make 
My 
Day! 
men and men who are just plain anguished over those abortion statistics, resist the pro­life arguments, in part, because they feel in their bones that the saving offetal life is being used as a shibbeleth, a banner under shich anti-women troops have re-grouped. The pro­lifers are seen as the counter-revolutionaries eager to stem the small progress towards equality that women have begun to make. 
The hate-filled, wildly intemperate in­vective that the pro-life people hurl at the Equal Rights Amendment betrays much, much more than a desire to stamp out abor­tion. It reveals a mindset that would restore women to the hearth -to her angel-in-the­home role -providing consolation in the com­fortless world men create. While the pro-life movement is spearheaded by brutal and un­savory men like Jesse Helms, we cannot pres­clod from a diagnosis ofan anti-woman bias to the campaign. 
When the Women's Pavilion opened In South Bend six years ago, right-to-lifers imme­diately began to organize protests and marches. I asked a Catholic woman, now well into her seventies, Ifwe should be joining any ofthe protests. "Good gracious, no. You don't help those people to power," she replied. Her apostolic simplicity has discerned that "those people" would polarize, not reconcile. Inci­dently, this vigilant old lady has been a crusader all her life; she was active in social justice and liturgical reform movements long before the Vatican stirred Itself from its post­Tridentive somnolence. 
The overwhelming majority of men and many of"their" womenfolk (I use the posses­sive pronoun deliberately) in the pro-life movement are hostile to the emancipation of women. This can be gauged by a very simple litrims test viz. birth control. Scratch a pro­lifer, and you will usually discover a vigorous opponent of birth control. Now the most ef­fective way to stop abortion is to prevent the conception ofunwanted babies. This logic has no appeal for the pro-lifer; he is not daft, he

knows .that birth control has always played a major role In the emancipation of women. Without birth control, women are pretty much at the mercy of their fecundity; with It they are quite literally In control, and, alas, women in control are threatening to the patriarchal pro-life male. 
The only way we are going to have any chance ofbeating those alarming abortion sta­tistics is by giving women more equality, not less. Adoption ofthe ERA would be an obvious first step. I long to see the day when women enjoy the respect and equality that Jesus so abundantly afforded them. When Jesus befriended the prostitute Mary Magdalen, he did so in a context of equality. By gJving her the gift ofself-respect, Jesus empowered Mary Magdalen to become a remarkable disciple. When the going got rough, she had the resilience and the intestinal fortitude to stick with Jesus while the chaps fled the scene. That's what equality and self-respect can do fora woman! 
In a world that evinced a mature equality and power-sharing between women and men, the feminine mystique would disappear. We would celebrate the humanity women and men share Instead oftheorizing -always at the expense ofwomen -about the significance of genital and hormonal differences. Women, In such a world, would appropriate their sexuality confidently and this would lead to a surer sense ofcontrol over their fertility. 
This is the sexual revolution which has barely begun, and It is the one that the pro-life male most fears and resents. It Is, however, our best hope for reducing the Incidence of abortion in this country. If the pro-life people continue to have their way, Ifthey are permit­ted to set the political and legal agenda, wo­men will remain powerless and alienated. This would be the perfect recipe for keeping those abortion mills humming-legally or illegally.

ORLANDO, Fla.-Lee Corso, who was released from his contract as head football coach of Northern Illi­nois University earlier yesterday, was named the first head coach of Orlando's entry in the United States Football League. 
"We'll do everything we can to represent you in a major-league fas­hion and... to win," Corso, 49, told a downtown news conference called by Orlando Renegades owner Donald Dizney. 
Corso, who has also served as head coach at Indiana and Lousville, reportedly signed a three-year con­tract amounting to about $1 50,000 in annual salary and bonuses.

that is more extensive than any pro­gram a Notre Dame team has ever faced. The coach's motivation for such training, he said, is to improve the team now so that it will he ready for an upgradcd schedule next year. 
Most of this season's players will he rcturning for next year's cam­paign, and Gral·e has an excellent foundation on which to build. 
"What we have to recognize is that we can he hettcr," Grace said, "and, more importantly, we have to recognizc what we have to do to get 
better. Everybody has a desire to win; what we have to do is establish with these boys the desire to do the training to win. '!bat's the project right now." 
The Irish coach certainly has his work cut out for him, as he must find a replacement for seniors Rich Her­degen, who led this year's squad in scoring with 34 points, and Dominick Driano, who recorded 23 defensive saves from his sweeper­back position. 
Herdegen, who now is seeking a professional contract, finsihed his collegiate career in second place on the all-time Notre Dame scoring list with I 3 7 points in four seasons. 
Second-leading scorer Pat Szanto, who had 28 points this year to make him sixth on the all-time Irish 
scoring list, will be back next year for his third season. Dave Miles, an­other productive player on this year's front line, also will be back. 
Most midfielders and defenders will return next fall, and goalkeeper Jim Flynn is expected to fill the va­
c;;ncy left by Mark Steranka and Dan, Coughlin. 
"The bottom line reads," accor­ding to Grace, "at the end of the 
year, we were fighters .... Next year's success is dictated by what we do now." 
If the winter and spring practices go as well as Grace hopes, and if his recruiting is successful, next year's success may be something to see.

Four-way tie in NFC East 
Redskins overcome Atlanta, 27-14 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -joe Theismann passed for one touchdown and ran for another and john Riggins hulled over for two short scores as the Washington Redskins beat the At­lanta Falcons, 27-14, last night and forced an unprecedented four-way tie for first place in the NFC East. 
But it wasn't easy for the Redskins, who broke a two-game losing streak and joined the St. Louis Cardinals, New York Giants and Dallas Cow­boys at the top of their conference with a 6-4 record. It was the first time since the NFL went to 28 teams in 1976 that four teams had been tied this late in the season. 
After a scoreless first period, Washington took a 14-0 lead in the second on 1-yard TO runs by Theis­mann and Riggins. But, the Redskins lost the lead almost as quickly, giving up touchdowns to Atlanta late in the first half and early in the third period as the RFK stadium crowd of 
51,301 booed loudly. 
lben, with the game tied at 14-14 late in the third quarter, Redskins linebacker Mel Kaufman hit Atlanta quarterback Mike Moroski, who had replaced an injured Steve Bartkowski in the second period be­hind the line ofscrimmage. 
Moroski fumbled and Neil Olkewicz recovered on the Atlanta 
32. Seven plays later, Riggins hulled over from the one and it was 20-14 ­Mark Moseley missed the extra point. The TO was the 105th of Rig­gins' career, tying hfm with Don Hutson on the all-time NFL list. 
The Redskins defense, which had seven sacks on the night, held and Washington came right back, mixing Riggins' running and lbeismann's quick out passes. The touchdown came on a slant-in from 7 yards out to Calvin Muhammad at the end of a 12-play, 65-yard drive that consumed the first six minutes of the fourth quarter. 
Atlanta, which dropped its fourth straight game and fell to 3-7, trailed 14-7 at halftime. But Gerald Riggs, who became the first back since Marcus Allen in last season's Super Bowl to rush for 100 yards against Washington, blasted over from 10 yards out at the end of the Falcons' first second-half possession to tie the 
score at 14-14. 
Riggs, who finished the night with 134 yards in 27 carries, gained 49 of the 79 yards on the drive. 

Health a factor in decision 
McKay resigns as Buccaneer coach 
Assodated Press 
TAMPA, Fla. -John McKay, the 
only coach in the nine-year history 
of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, an­
nounced yesterday he will resign at 
the end ofthe season. 
His resignation leaves only Tom Landry of the Dallas Cowboys, Don Shula of the Miami Dolphins and Chuck Noll of the Pittsburgh Steelers as coaches with longer careers with the same National Foot­ball League team. 
McKay, who amassed a 127-40-8 record during 16 years with South­ern California, will become the Bucs' president at the end of the 1984 season, the club announced. 
At Southern Cal, McKay led the Trojans to nine Pac-8 champion­ships and to eight Rose Bowls. But with the Bucs, McKay's record is only 41-85-1, including a 3-7 mark this season. 
His Bucs have made the playoffs three of the past five years, but have won only five oftheir last 26 games. 
McKay cited the team's perfor­mance and his health in his resigna­tion to owner Hugh Culverhouse. The 61-year-old McKay underwent cataract surgery on his right eye Sept. 19 and said he would have a there yet," said McKay. "In light of similar operation on his left eye at my_continuing problems with my vi­the end of the season. 
"Recent weeks have shown that sion, I told Mr. Culverhouse today while I believe we are fairly close to that I believe we need someone else where we want to be, we ace not to coach the team next season."

Suspension of 21 days pending 
McEnroe takes Stockholm prize 
Associated Press 
STOCKHOLM, Sweden -John McEnroe shrugged off a pending suspension of at least 2 l days and blitzed Mats Wilander after a second set lapse, 6-2, 3-6, 6-2 yesterday to win the 531 S,OOO Stockholm Open­Scandinavian Championships. 
It was the third time McEnroe has won this coveted title, the only offi­cial national indoor championship recognized by the International Tennis Federation. McEnroe also won in 1978 and 1979, but then missed his chance to win an un­precedented three straight titles when Bjorn Borg beat him in the 
1980 final. 
McEnroe, who was fined $2,100 for "unsportsmanlike" conduct in a turbulent semifinal against Swede Anders Jarryd to exceed the $7,500 limit, behaved better yesterday. 
But the American's behavior was not perfect. He was warned once by the umpire in the second set for ver­bal abuse. 
McEnroe, the world's top-ranked player, improved his 1984 won-lost record to 75-2 after yesterday's vic­tory before another sellout crowd at the Royal Tennis Hall and millions watching on TV in several countries. 
The Wimbledon and U.S. open champion's only setbacks this year came in the French Open final last June, when Ivan Lend! rallied to win 
in five sets, and in the first round of the ATP championships at Kings Is­land, Ohio, last August, when Vijay Amritraj of India stunned the New Yorker. The victory also evened 
McEnroe's head-to-head record 
against Wilander. The defending 
champion and No. 3 seed here, 
Wilander held a 3-2 edge over the American going into the final after beating the left-bander on three dif­ferent surfaces -clay, hardcourt and grass -last year. 
In the semifinals Sunday, McEnroe knocked out fourth-seededJarryd of Sweden 1-6, 7-6, 6-2 while Wilander outlasted No.2 seedJimmy Connors 6-7,6-3,6-3. 

Competition continues today 
Allen, Brown score boxing upsets 
Associated Press 
INDIANAPOUS -Darin Allen of Columbus, Ohio, and Obie Beard of Jackson, Tenn., produced upset vic­tories in the second round of the 1984 United States-Budweiser Boxing Championships yesterday. 
Allen outpointed 1984 Golden Gloves and U.S. Junior champ Mylon Watkins of Tacoma, Wash., in the second round of their 147-pound match. 
The five-day competition con­tinues today with quarterfinal action at the Indiana Convention Center. 
Allen, who won the Eastern Olym­pic Trials earlier this year, matched Watkins blow for blow and was able to capitalize on several of Watkins' exchanges. In the second round, Watkins was penalized a point for ducking his head, which greatly aided Allen in notching the decision. 
Watkins was considered one of 
the early favorites in his division 
after moving up from the welter­
weight class where he lost to gold 
medalist Mark Breland in the Olym­
pic Trials. 
Beard, the younger brother of professional boxer Jackie Beard, defeated 1984 National Golden Gloves champ Marvin Chambers of St. Louis on a disqualification.

Notre Dame's volleyball team played well at the University of Pittsburgh tournament over the weekend, but lost two of three games against the tougher competition. Eric Scheuermann details the weekend's action below. 
Maternowski impressive 
ND soccer season a success as Irish stood up to tougher competition 
ByPHILWOLF 
AsststantSports Edttor 
Last Thursday afternoon, the Notre Dame soccer team ended its season with a 6-4 overtime victory at Valparaiso. Now, first-year head coach Dennis Grace has a chance to look back over his inaugural season at the Irish helm. 
"Overall, everything was fine," Grace says. "We could have done better, but we didn't do badly. In fact, we did well at times, and at times we were a brilliant team." 
The Irish completed 1his, their eighth season, with a record of 12-6­2, which is not as good as the team's record has been in the past few years. The record still is impressive, though, in light of the fact that the Irish played what Grace called "the toughest schedule in Notre Dame soccer history." 
The Irish opened the season with three consecutive victories at home, downing Indiana-Purdue/Fort Wayne, Purdue and Louisville. The team then took its show on the road to defeat Bethel and Northwestern, while coming away with a tie against Michigan State. 
The Michigan State game, accor­ding to Grace, was represt~ntative of all of the games the Irish had played to that point. Although Notre Dame had established the lead at 1-0 and 2-1, the Irish could not put the game out of the Spartans' reach, and even­tually they had to settle for the tie, 2-2. In the previous four games, the 

Irish do well in Pittsburgh tourney

Coming into the University of Pit­tsburgh tournament over the weekend, the Notre Dame women's volleyball team was riding high on a four-game winning streak. And al­though the Irish lost two out of the three matches they played, they continued to play good volleyball. 
Notre Dame started off the tourn­ament by playing a tough Penn State team that was ranked No. 7 in the nation. The Irish lost in three straight games, 1-15, 7-15 and 1-15, but coach Art Lambert was pleased with the team's effort. 
"We had a lot of side outs against Penn State," said Lambert, "and we stretched them to an hour and 15 minutes despite being swept." 
The Irish next faced host Pit­
tsburgh, who would go on to win the 
tournament with an upset win 
against Pie Nittany Lions. Although they played well against the Pan­thers, they could not holu the lead during the contest, and ended up losing by scores of 4-1 5, 10-15 and 11-15. 
With their record now standing at 11-11, the Irish came back to capture a tough match against the Tar Heels of North Carolina. After losing the first game, Notre Dame put it all together to win the match, 12-15,15-9,15-12,12-15 and 15-12. With the victory, the team was able to capture a third place in this com­petitive tournament. 
Senior Josie Maternowski was one member of the team who stuck out with her very effective play during the three games. 
"Josie played as well as I've seen her play," said Lambert. "She was as consistent in this tournament as she has been all year." 
Besides taking home the third place honors, the Irish came away with some bruises. Senior Mary Jo Hensler sprained her ankJe over the weekend, and some other players suffered minor injuries. The team will have two weeks to get back to 100 percent, as it will not play again until the North Star Conference tournament. 
Lambert is pleased with the way the team is performing now, and hopes for more improvement. 
"I think these girls are making good progress," says Lambert. "Our defense is a lot better, and we are playing tougher. We're still a young team, and we make some mistakes, but our mistakes are coming with less frequency." 
With the two weeks fret~. the Irish will have time to work toward the tournament. The team finished with a 7-1 conference record, so a strong showing is hoped for. Perhaps the tournament will also give the Irish a chance for revenge against Loyola, the only team in the conference to defeat the Irish. 

One of best years ever 
ND field hockey completes season

This weekend the Notre Dame 
field hockey team completed one of 
its most successful seasons ever. 
Friday through Sunday the Irish competed in the St. Louis Tourna­ment, in which they notched, en 
route to a third place finish, two vic­tories, a tie and a loss. To open the t~urney, Notre Dame faced 
nationally-ranked Southern Illinois, played Friday morning at 8 a.m. on a 
... 
frozen artificial surface in St. Louis. The Irish, according to Notre Dame 
coachJill Lindenfeld, "played an out­standing defensive game" while holding So. Illinois to a scoreless tie, 0-0. 
Later that evening they squared off against Da'yton. On the strength of goals by Corinne DiGiacomo, 
Molly McCabe and Christina Wein­mann, among others, the Irish stearnrolled past Dayton by the score of6-1. 
Saturday the Irish had to face off against the University of Louisville. Notre Dame propelled past the Car­
dinals via Corrine DiGiacomo's two goals, Molly McCabe's score, and the 
stingy goaltending of Patti Gallag­her. The final score was Notre Dame 3, Louisville 1. 
The Irish then advanced into the quarter finals where they faced an­other nationally ranked team, South­west Missouri State. This time the opposition proyed too much as 
Southwest Missouri State shutout the Irish 3-0. 
Lindenfeld said this season was a very successful one,said she, " this year the players acquired a winning attitude they also vastly improved their ball handling skills." 
In terms of wins and losses there can be no question that this was a profitable year for the Irish field 
hockey team as they compiled their best record in years, 15-5-2. The Irish will now have a few months off until they will begin training for an­
other season of field hockey, a season which they hope will em­ulate the successes ofthis year.
