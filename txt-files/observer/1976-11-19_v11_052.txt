Homecoming dance.  

·'These events combined with Saturday's game, the happy hour at Fat Wallv's, the Doobie Brothers Concert and the wrap-up party at the Nazz should make for a fun homecoming weekend," said Kevin Sadler, Student Union social commissioner. 
"1 don't feel that the Death March will put a damper on the Homecoming dance, for as long as the Seniors don't get too loaded they will still come and enjoy the dance." Sadler remarked, adding that last vear's dance was financial­ly sut·ccssful. and he is hoping for the same amount of student sup­port.

Ninety percent complete 


Registration termed sucessful 
by Don Reimer Copy Editor 

Preregistration went smoothly and over 90% of the students have completed the process, according to Assistant Registrar David Kil. 
Kil noted that students can still turn in their Form SO's in the registrar's office today. Those who do not complete registration today will receive a notice next week requesting that they either come to the registrar's office and register or notify the University that they do not plan to return next semester. 
Two major changes in the process were initiated this seme:,­ter: sophomores picked up their checkmarked cards for most Arts and Letters Departments at Stepan Center, and seniors and juniors had only Monday and Tuesday in which to complete registration. 
"I thought it went well," Kil said in reference to the new sophomore procedure. At the suggestion of Arts and Letters Dean Isabel 
Students go to Washington 
by Marti Hogan St. Mary's Editor 

Eleven St. Mary's government majors have been accepted into the American University Washington Sc'llester Program for the spring semester, according to Louis Tondreau, chairman of the depart­ment of government. 
The Washington Semester Program allows students from 200 accredited colleges in the country who are interested in government to become involved in current political affairs. St. Mary's has sent students every year since it was admitted into the program in 1971. 
According to Tondreau, this is the largest group of students from St. Mary's yet enrolled in the program. "I think we have a great deal of interest and were able to negotiate them in," Tondreau ex­plained. "We don't expect that many each semester." he said, adding that normally there is a quota of two students. 
The students are Cindy Rac­cuglia. Marjorie lrr, Carol Tucker, Deborah Lewis, Joan Marcouiller. Shannon Mahoney, Colleen Clukas, Jean Joyce, Joan Griffin, Mary Beth O'Hara and Renell Sullivan. 
"We're all thinking of govern­ment as a career, and the exposure will enable us to see if that's what we want to do." Raccuglia said. 
To qualify for the program, a student must be at least a second semester sophomore and a govern­ment major. "We have a process in which we consider the student's grade point average, the number of government courses she's taken and how well she's done in them," Tondreatr explained. "If they are up to par, I send in their applica­tions and set them in order of my priorities,'' he added. 
Students are selected mainly on the basis of the proposed topic submitted for their research paper, which is to be done during the semester. "Our students presented well thought-out project topics," Tondreau said. 
"It had to be something we could do best in Washington -not something we could do in Notre Dame's library," Irr explained. She indicated that the proposals may be changed or revised when the students are in Washington. 
"Our research will consist of 

primary sources and interviews," 
she continued, adding that the

Charles, a new process for sopho­more registration was begun under which Arts and Letters Depart­ments with checkmarked class cards available to sophomores withheld them until Wednesday. 
The process was begun to insure that all sophomores had an equal opportunity to get checkmarked cards. according to Kil. He ex­plained some sophomores were counseled by their colleges before others, so in past years, some sophomores could get their cards earlier. 
Under the new system, all soph­omores in Business. Science. En­gineering, or Arts and Letters were forced to get their Arts and Letters checkmark cards at Stepan Center on Wednesday. 
Kil said the only complaint he received was that the Modern Language Department was not at Stepan. T}1ls department did not come because they do not have many checkmark cards, but if the procedure is used again. Kil will

pages.·· 
The students in the program receive 16 credit hours, but do not attend regular classes. "We'll be staying at American University in D.C.," lrr said. "It's an American University program, but it's not in the university itself." 
The Washington Semester Program includes five areas of concentration: American govern­ment, international relations. inter­national development. urban studies and economics. 
In addition to the research paper, the program consists of a seminar and an elective class or an intern­ship. "Usually everyone takes an internship," lrr stated. "They tell us to write ahead if we have an idea but not to make anything final until we arrive in Washington," she explained. 
Suggested internships include work on House or Senate staffs. Congressional committees and lobby groups. Students are encour­aged to find an internship in an area different from their research projects. 

LeMans formal tix sold out many still desire want to go 
by Anne Bachle Staff Reporter 

Tickets for the LeMans formal, which will be held Dec. 4 in the Studebaker Mansion, went on sale Wednesday night are now sold-out. All 17S tickets have been sold and there are approximately 100 who still want tickets. 
"Last year only 110 tickets were sold to the formal, so we figured this year 17S would be enough," said Cathy Libert, LeMans Hall vice president. 
Hall President Michele Jaworski explained, "There just aren't any bigger places in the area, except the Armory. and we couldn't picture having a formal there. There were rumors we'd sell 200 tickets, but we couldn't--it'll be crowded as it is." 
Tickets were originally schedul­ed to go on sale at 6:30 p.m. Wednesday, but the time was moved back to 10 p.m. after students complained that that would interfere with tests, classes and lectures. Students began lining up iri the lobby in the early 
afternoon. 
"It was like they were camping out for a concert," commented one onlooker. 
It was estimated that there were already 175 students in line by 6 , p.!11,:! an.d .rumors ?f a roll .~all or a. 
-·"We'll intern 16 hours a week 
probably on Thursday and Friday.'· 
lrr said. "We have to keep arecord 
of what we do on our internships 
because we'll have to give bi­
weekly reports to our internship 
directors." she added. 
The seminar, which meets three 

days a week. includes visiting 
various government agencies and 
attending Senate hearings. Also 
featured in the program arc lec­
tures by noted speakers such as 
congressmen and Supreme Court 
justices. 
"If something big comes up that 

we've been talking about. •ve'll go 
to that," lrr said. ''I'm sure we'll 
go to the inauguration," she 
added. 
According to lrr the seminar and 

research project will demand the 
greater part of the student's time 
while the internship will serve as a 
supplement. "It's a way of putting 
our knowledge to work and seeing 
real politics at work." she said. 
"It will be interesting for us to 

start out with a new administra­
tion." Raccuglia said. "If you 'rc 
interested in government. it's an 
opportunity that one can't refuse." 
she remarked. 
inform students which departments will not be represented. 
"I think it will be maintained," Kil commented about the new system. but he noted that the final decision had not yet been made pending an analvsis of this semes­ter's procedure: 
The period for completing pre~ registration for seniors and juniors was cut to two days this semester to reduce staff time used and to get the forms processed quicker. In previous years, Kil explained. stu­dents came in slowlv over the longer period. so one d~y was cut to force student< to register earlier. 
Though an instruction sheet was sent to each individual student, 
some  juniors  and  seniors  were  
unaware  of  the  shortened  time  
period.  

Kil. however, doubted the ef­fectiveness of announcing the change through the media. "It is best to communicate with each individual through the instruction sheets. Mass communication could 
Many students ere upset that they couldn't get tickets to the formal according to Jaworski. 
"It was all really embarrassing," said one girl. who preferred not to be identified. "It was hard enough to get up the nerve to ask him, then I had to tell him we couldn't go after all." 
"They didn't take into consiuer­ation that the make-up of the dorm is different this year .. another student. "!.a~.: •iar tL ·r• were a lot more fi e~h•~u:· .. aren't nearly as inclined to go to a formal their first semester here. This year LeMans is mostly juniors; there's also about SO more resi­dents than last year. They should have taken that into account." 
She suggested in addition that they consider holding future for­mals at the concotlHe in the ACC. "When it's fixed up for a dance it really looks nice, and it's also convenient for kids without cars," she said. 
Other suggestions for the future were to have students sign up with their R.A. 's or submit written requests for tickets. This way tickets would be distributed on a first-come, first-serve basis, so that girls who knew from the start that they wanted to go would be assured tickets. 
Signs are now appearing all over the dorm asking for tickets.

Parietal Committee urges response 
b)' LiHian Solar Staff Reporter 
The St. Man··s Parietal Investi­gation Commiitce held a meeting with its subcommittees last night to discuss progress and plans for the future. 
Diane Smits headed the central committee which concerned itself with the problems and results of the work done thus far by the subcommittees. 
She stressed the need for letters from the students to demonstrate interest in changing the parietal code now in effect at St. Mary's. 
"We have onl~· received five letters as of now and this is very frustrating because of the amount of work that we have put in for tr~·ing to change the current parie­tab... said Smits. "Students need onlv write a small letter of concern anli interest for changing the Jli'L''-oL'lll p.mctals :·.nd drop it into thl' paril'tal mailboxes in each indi\ idual hall at St. Mary's.··

The questionnaire will be given to students bv their R.A. 'sand will also be made available for off-campus students. 
"We are looking for a minimum of 75 percent return on surveys and arc strongly urging all students to complete and return these impor­tant questionnaires." stated Smits. 
The research committee will also distribute a survey to all adminis­tration. f.aculty,.alumnae, and par­ents. and also' plans to write

c~pccially in regard to their present male visitation codes. The research committee will also compile the returned data as it is received. 
"The public relations committee is also planning several publicity campaigns.·· according to Suzy Plavac. committee member. ··Articles will be written weekly for the Observer to inform students as to the progress that we have made along with bi-monthly articles to The Grapevine. a St. Mary's stu­dent information letter." said Plavac. 
"We will also put up several posters telling students of the progress being made and inform­ing them of upcoming meetings in which thev can voice their concern and inter~st. ·· she added. 
"We want everyone to know that only with their help can we change the present parietal situation at St. Mary's." declared Smits. 
Benefits to veterans increased by Gl Bill 
Veterans recetvmg educational assistance under the GI Bill recent­ly received an eight percent inc­rease in their benefit payments effective Oct. I. 1976. The increase was reflected in the regular month­ly payment for November. 
Veterans who were entitled to 36 months of payment on the GI Bill were awarded an additional nine months of eligiblity. which is not limited to undergraduate training. This particular provision of the law is also effective Oct. 1. 1976. The ten year eligibility period for veterans to use their educational benefits was not extended, however.

The prize in the raffle will be a 1977 blue and gold Cutlass Supreme. which has been ordered from a local automobile dealer. The student prize will be a color television set. In order to be eligible fo~ the television. a student 
must sell at least one raffle ticket. Raffle tickets are priced at one dollar apiece and a book contains ten tickets. The hall will receive
two dollars back for each book of

The hall quota has been lowered from 90 books per hundred resi­dents to 75 this year. Each hall which sells its quota of books will receive five dollars back from each book sold. Boast commented she thinks the quota of 75 percent is more realistic than the 90 percent quota. 
Selling the raffle tickets is "a good way for halls to make money," Delucenay pointed out. Last year. Farley Hall made enough money from raffle ticket sales to pay for all the expenses of its booth at the Carnival, Boast added.

The African program, known as "Crossroads Africa," was featured in a discussion last night by Moses Thompson. (Photo by Jim Hofman.) 

Area establishments benefit from Notre Dame 
(continued from page 1) 
get along without them. Notre Dame football is not only essential to mv busincs~. but to the area as welL" 
Football traffic significantly in­creases the percentage of business in restaurant revenues. 
Luxury-type dining as well as fast-food establishments contacted showed a large increase in business. 
Fred Creager of the Boar's Head estimated an average of 22 percent increase which translates into a $2.000 bonus. 
"We increase our business con­sistcntlv to ISO dinners more each home football weekend,'· Creager explained. "Our reputation. high standards. and good location con­tribute to the success." 
He observed that aside from the increased revenue the-restaurant draws. the relationship that develops with the fans is unique. and is particularly enjoyed by him and his employees. 
Manager of Holly's Landing. Steve York. reported an estimated increase of between 25 percent to 30 percent. Although the location seems to be ·'off the beaten path,'' York feels the location does not reduce his business. "Notre Dame football benefits the hospitality industry more so than any other industry in town," he observed. "We are very much appreciative." 
The Down Under, unlike many other restaurants, takes reserva­tions from their clientele. Jack Stewart, owner and manager, cited an estimated 70 percent increase with the football traffic. "The crowds are sometimes a little more than we can handle, but we manage," he said. "Every merchant in town wishes that every weekend was notre Dame football weekend. The fans contribute to making life a little easier." 
Stewart also saw the location of the Down Under as being slightly detrimental to its popularity, but speculated that business is rarely affected. ''Our advertising is done by word of mouth. Once they're here. we've got 'em." 
Mike Lane of Barnaby's stated a preference for football weekends to any other time of year. 
"Our increase is approximately lO percent. Notre Dame football is 
a big shot in the arm for the
community and business in gen­era!," he explained. "The week­
ends are a tremendous help to 
both. Fresh money is brought into the city and stimulates our econ­omy... 
Lane also observed that along

with the money comes familiar faces. "What brings people to South aend? !be cp{Ilmlp:~itr,llelp~.Notre ' D'aine"' · and · No~re· Dam'e' 
AI Vcldmann of Veldmann's service station explained that he doubles the gas volume on football weekends. "The entire situation is difficult to describe. but most people in this town thrive on the football traffic." 
Jim McDonald of Bob's Standard Service revealed an increase in sales as much as 30 percent. "Our business is boosted on these week­
ends." he commented.  "We sell  
more gas, service  more  cars.  and  
move more products.''  

One manager however. who insisted on remaining unnamed, expressed his disgust and dissatis­faction with home games. ·'The onlv contribution to the community that I sec is drunk p<'oplc who have no idea where they arc going or what thev want." he declared. "I know otic thing for sure, they certainly don't want gas. My sales do not increase significantly." 
Also reporting business spurts were area liquor stores. Depending on their proximity to the campus, managers reported that sales ftg­urcs increased from 20 to 40 percent-. 
Walter Pollock and Bob Snider of the Party Shoppc reported that during football weekends their business increases between 60 and 70 percent. 
Most managers of the establish­ments interviewed agree that Notre Dame football is an asset to St. Joseph County. One manager con­firmed this by saying "We very much appreciate the support of the fans. They have been wonderful to us and have helped us all a great deal."

Director Thompson describes Crossroads Africa program 
by Mary Pinard Staff Reporter 

Moses Thompson, director of Operation Crossro~ds Africa, con­ducted an informal discussion and slide presentation on the Cross­roads program last night. 
Crossroads Africa is a six-week summer program that allows stu­dents to go to Africa on a voluntary work project. To qualify. a student must be interested in the work and have applicable course experience. 
Thompson explained the purpose of the program. which was founded by a minister from Harlem in 1958. "Crossroads allows young Ameri­cans to live and work daily with people and gain a cross cultur~l insight that could apply. as well, 111 America." 
Thompson cited "Americans' failure to comprehend the values and aspirations of Africa and its people." To illustrate. he indicated that two theories for the develop­
ment  of  Africa  are  common  to  
American  thought.  First.  the  
"trickle  

down thcorv" in which the top sector of the. economy is boosted so the surplus will eventually reach into the need areas. Secondly. the "take-off theory." in which money is invested into technological pos­sibilities so that Africa might "take-off', like America, and suc­ceed economically. 
"We have a tendency to place ourselves in the center of the universe. We find it difficult to comprehend that other cultures arc taking place at the same time." he declared. "We arc. however. very 
involved with Africa. During the oil
shortage we received one-third of

The basic device for mak'ing student contact with Africa and its people is the self-help community project. according to Thompson. Communal labor situations arc established and coordinated with the needs of a particular village. Projects arc approved by the national government and include clearing land. building schools. and developing rural areas. The stu­dents work with the villagers and in some cases apprenticeships are available for the student to learn weaving. tribal music. or even the health methods of the midwives in the village. 
·'The project is a device for making contact with the people." Thompson continued. ·'the labor itself is communal and phy~ical." 
Special projects arc also avail­able. This year's projects include work in archeology. communit~· development. agricultural develop­ment and health systems. "This spcdtic contact, .. Thompson said. "might begin to unravel the com­plex value systems of the African culture." 
Other students in the program arc from every regional. ethnic and economic background. "One will be learning as much about America as about Africa.·· Thompson ob­served.

Dome Decision Background 
The Observer has tried to report the recent administration-student arguments as completely and accurately as possible, but from past experience we have learned that things under the Dome are not always as they seem. What we have learned of administrative decision-making in several years of covering it is sketchy and in some cases speculative, but it is useful back­ground to recent events. 
The most obvious problem with Dome decision-making is the cloak of secrecy administrators occasionally draw around it. This is usually done not by-flat "no comments" but by giving the reporter the "run-around" from office to office, or by making a statement which sounds nice but says little. Sometimes information is given only on an "off the record" basis though there is no apparent reason why it should not be public. The tendency to secrecy is strongest on the business side of the University, as the resistance to reporting Notre Dame's finances shows. (The artic­les appear on yesterday's and today's feature pages.) 
How tight can the lid be? As a nationally known investigative reporter, who was involved in revealing the CIA scandal remarked during a visit here, "This place is tighter than the CIA.'' 
Administrators fail to realize--or do not care--that their secrecy makes students susp1cwus. When there are no good reasons for secrecy they look as if they are hiding something. These suspicions raise doubts about administrative good will. The attempt to hide a mistake, as a recent president learned, often turns out to be a bigger mistake. 
Secrecy and "stonewalling" occur most often when a reporter tries to trace the origin of a decision. From several years' experience we have learned that the man announcing and enforcing the decision is not always the man who made it. He may simple be acting on orders from "above." 
Has this happened recently? fu Septem­ber Dean Roemer announced a parietals policy of giving first offenders work assignments. Recently he suspended four first offenders for a semester. Was he acting on new orders to crack down? No one is saying, which causes speculation, suspicion and distrust, whether justified or not. 
We seem to have painted a picture of Byzantine maneuvering beneath the dome. But the tendency towards secrecy is only one part of the administration-student relationship. The students should always remember that administrators really are motivated by good will and genuine concern. fu the heat of debate it is sometimes forgotten that though adminis­
trators  are  sometimes  wrong  they  are  
never malevolent.  
As F'r.  Burtchaell explained,  "We  are  

terribly vulnerable and we do our work for love and not for gain." 
Unfortunately, this is often obscured by the administrative credo, "Father knows best.'' Both concern and condescension show in remarks such as Bro. Just Paczesny's "I am student affairs"; Fr. Hesburgh's, "The undergraduates will not make policy· here"; and Dr. Philip Faccenda' s famous "We are going to help the student whether they want our help or not." 
Student-administration relations would be smoother if administrators were more open and if they more often recognized students as responsible adults. That will 
come, 1f it comes at all, when the student body takes the responsibility and demands respect. Until the golden age arrives, our readers should at least be aware that things under the Dome are not always 
what they seem or precisely as we can report.

Michelangelo who? 
--eugene yang &paul fujawa 
The great painter thoughtfully stood on a loftly scaffolding gazing at his ultimate masterpiece. He was Michelangelo; and the master­piece was the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. It was nearly complete with only some work on the figure of Adam needed . 
Below, a workman trudged into this hallowed room. "Hey boss, someone here to see you," he bellowed. · 
"Be down in a minute," the great painter responded. He descended, slowly and carefully. In the mean time, a short, middle­aged man with little black eyes dressed in the latest fashions, tailor made, strutted into the room.

Beef Remark Explained 

Dear Editor: 
There is no doubt in my mind that the anonymous letter entitled, "N.D. Males Are Nerds and Chau­
~nistic," was the cheape~ shot I've even encountered, on or off the 
field. Not only was my name the
only one mentioned but also my words were taken totally out of context. 
Because I believe in a quote by

writer but instead will give an 
explanation of what was really said.

with cattle I turned to the practice in which we all have partaken, grading the opposite sex. This was not done in spite or with any other malicious intensions, but rather 
.just to give me something to talk about. When the speech came to including Notre Dame I dealt with the high requirements necessary for a woman to be accepted. I noted that only those women with both high SAT scores and high scholastic averages were ever con­sidered to attend Notre Dame. This high standard of acceptance seriously limits the type of women which can attend this University thereby limiting the number of so called, "grade A beef." State schools, by and large, have very minimal academic requirements and therefore get a lot more, "grade A beef," as far as beauty goes. In conclusion, I made the comment, in referring to personal appearance only, "at state schools you'll find a lot of 'grade A beef' while at Notre Dame you'll find a lot of 'grade B beef.' '' If I were to grade women by brains, the grades I gave would definitely have been reversed. For those who find my means of comparison rather crude, ask you to stand up and give an impromtu speech on the topic Grading Beef and at the same time be asked to, "make it clever." 
I am not upset that my comments were printed, however I was con­cerned that they were taken out of context. I have a tremendous amount of respect for Notre Dame women and hope that my children whether male or female, will someday have the opportunity to attend this University. However, I hope that they will be man enough or woman enough to sign their name to what they believe.

letters to a lonely God 
The Sins Full of Grace 
Reverend Robert Griffin 

In a well-loved parish in Greenwich Village, there was a young woman who used to come to daily Mass. Frequently, she was a reader at the mass; and occasionally. at the Sunday liturgy, she was a cup-bearer of the wine blessed as the Precious Blood; and every Sunday, she would serve as an extraordinary minister of the Eucharist, bringing Communion to some sick and elderly people who lived in her apartment house. None of these services of ministry were unusual in that stylishly avant-garde parish (enough avant-garde, in fact, that they sometimes reserved the Eucharist under both species in the tabernacle), except that the young woman was very obviously pregnant, and it was plainly understood that she was not married, and did not intend to be married. If there were people in the parish . who knew the private history of the young woman. they never talked about it; they never talked about her at all in a gossipy way. They just accepted her as an expedant mother, to be cared for with love and to be rejoiced with in the happy context of a child to be born. No one made excuses for the girl; no one condemned her; no one wanted to. When an infant son was finally born, the parishioners gave a baby-shower, and the needs of the mother and child were provided for with clothes and money. As far as I know. they two of them still live in the Villiage, attending mass in the well­loved parish church, with the mother serving in the ministries that are open to women, and the parishioners still looking after the welfare of that little family. Two of their best friends are aneighty year-old couple who are traditional Catholics in all things except their extraordinary charity. The church I am writing of is not a mixed-up. hippy commune full of way-out types with highly permissive attitudes toward conventional morality; it is a venerable parish of the archdiocese of New York, a highly conservative place in its Catholic religion. Its communicants tend to be Irish and Italians of the old school. and professional people, and Catholics from established families. The place is old­fashioned enough that the services still include a Monday night novena toOur Lady of the Miraculous Medal. 
Once upon a time, when I was still in high school up in Maine, I briefly considered asking a girl to marry me. I was not in love with the girl; she was not in love with me, though we had both loved each other in a brother-and-sister way since we were children. Those were the days of World War II; and in the confusion of the times, the girl had slept with a chap she hadn't known very long, just before he marched away to war. While he was in some far-off training camp, she discovered she was pregnant. The circumstances were especially distressful for the girl; her mother had recently died of cancer; her father, unable to cope with the grief, had begun drinking heavily. 
I did not marry her, of course; but I thought of it, and she thought of it too. But she was in love with the baby's father, and he was in love with her; the obvious necessity, it seemed, was for the two of them to be married. The problem was the distance that separated them. He was inthe Air Force ; and three or four months after he entered the service, he was shipped overseas to some place close to India, never having gotten a leave at all; he remained there without home leave until the end of the war. So the terrible time of waiting began for her, and so did the pretensions before the neighbors of having married the previous summer; preten­sions, incidentally, that no one the least bit believed. There was the wedding ring I helped her buy, a pitiable symbol of hope for a wedding that all the tides of war seem to doom to frustration. There were the lies, deciving no one, that seemed necessary to the girl if she were to continue holding up her head in public, and not simply dying of shame; lies that she felt she owed to the honor of her newly-buried mother, whom she looked on as a saint who mustn't seem sullied by her daughter's disgrace; lies that didn't become any simpler after the baby was born; lies that I became so involved in that my own relationship to the girl and the infant became the subject of gos'sip that even my parents heard about, until they began to wonder about the urchin whom I bounced on my knee. Then, always, there were the ever-present fears that the young seargeant overseas might never come back for the marriage, because he didn't want to; fears that he might never come back, because he would end up as a casualty, 
buried in some distant, alien field. 
Finally, he did come back. In my first 
vacation home from college in 1945. I met 
him again, back fromwar;by now, they were 
married, and the long nightmare was 
over. Yet I knew, perhaps better than the 
husband did, how deeply the girl had been 
scarred by the lies, the fears. the pretense. 
Thirty years later, she is still scarred from 
three years of waiting for her child to have 
a name, as the phrase goes. At times, after 
thirty years of happy marriage. I think she 
trusts me more than she trusts her 
husband (whom she loves very much. and 
he loves her), just because I w'as the friend 
she never had to lie to. 

Last year I went to a dinner party with 
several. early middle-aged cou)'les I never 
met before. During dinner. the question 
arose: If Christian people are so opposed 
to abortion, why, by their gossip. their 
cruelty. their censorious judgements, their 
failure to feel compassion. they have 
always driven -why do they still drive ­
unmarried mothers to consider a surgical 
termination of pregnancy as an option 
preferable to public embarrassment? I 
understood the legitimacy of the question. 
Fear of what the neighbors might say is, of 
course, only one of the reasons why a 
woman may consider an abortion; but 
again and again, in conversations with girls 
who are "in trouble." I have heard the 
question: "How will my family face the 
neighborhood? How will my parents 
survive the disgrace?" 

I said to these middle-aged couples : 
"How would you feel if one of your 
unmarried children came home and an­
nounced that he or she was soon to become 
a parent? Would you forgive them 
easily?" 

''Forgive them?,'' they said. ''Of course we would forgive them. Pregnancy is something that could have happened to any one of us when we were young and foolish and full of risks. The fact that it didn't happen was a matter of luck, and the grace of God, and a fear that our parents would have beat the hell out of us. if we got in trouble. But we would forgive our kids, if they got in trouble. just as our own familes would have forgiven us. Forgive them easily, for Christ's sake? What's to forgive?" 
"You mean you wouldn't mind. if your daughter got pregnant?" I said. 
"Mind? Of course we would mind. At seventeen or eighteen or nineteen,our kids are not ready to be married. They are too young to have the responsibility of being tied down to raising a family, paying bills, maintaining a home. We would mind because we would feel sad for our kids made old too early by very adult obliga­tions. We would mind because they're not ready for the permanent commitment of marriage." 
"Would you feel shamed if your daugh­ter got pregnant, or your son got his girl pregnant?" I said. 
"Not shamed." they said, "but grieved at the hardships ahead for them, and sick at heart at the choices they would have to make." 
Four couples met a single time at a dinner party do not represent a consensus of parental opinion, but they left me in a mood where I wanted to begin a campaign to silence the gossips and scandalmongers who make the simple fact of having a baby outside of marriage seem like a gross indecency. If a girl is driven to have an abortion out of fear of what the neighbors might say, then I think the neighbors deserve hanging. Not long ago. I was marring a couple who were expectmg a baby, and I asked them if they weren't embarrassed at having a pregnant bride walking down the aisle. "We are not embarassed," they said; "in fact, we are rather proud of ourselves. We don't have to accept the baby; we don't have to be married because of the baby. But we want to accept the baby; we want it to be born, but we could have chosen otherwise." 
It is that kind of a world, a world. where you respect young people for their simple decency in accepting a life they could quickly and quietly destroy. If you believe in the Sixth and Ninth commandments (And I do believe in them, without reservation, and so do plenty of others, including young people), you may hope that unmarried couples should feel a little shabby for having transgressed, but what the hell kind of an attitude is it that wants to make a girl feel like an outcast and a dirty person for making love to her warm-borne sergeant in circumstances that the world deems unblessed? It is a simple

The Entertainment Week 
By Dauid O'Keefe 
ON THE TUBE 

Friday, November 19 I Want to Keep My Baby! (9:00 pm. 22). and, at the same time, Revenge for a Rape (9:00pm. 28): You might want to tune in on either one of these to get a good idea of the limited intellectual capabilities of network television programmers. I for one am tired of programs that purport to make some significant social contribution while in reality contributing to the retardation of social development. What do v.e need 
shows about unwed mothers and rape for? Saturday, Novembt>r 20 NCAA College Football (12:45 pm. 28): 
The Michigan Wolverines meet the Ohio State Buckeyes in Columbus to deride the Big 10 Championsl:lip. The winner will go to the Rose Bowl to face either USC or UCLA. while the loser will probably end up in either the Orange or Gator Bowls. also a distinct possibility for the Irish. 
Billy Jack (9:00 pm, 16): Tom Laughlin wrote the screenplay. directed and starred in the film, and borrowed the money to make it all possible back in 1971. What he ended up with was what's called a sleeper. a seeming second-class film that, for reasons unknown, becomes a box-office hit. Billy Jack is a half-breed Indian and Vietnan1 vet who fights the prejudices of the townfolk in a one-man crusade to gain tolerance, if not acceptance. of the wav­ward band of misfits that live in a small communal school in the country. 
Sunday, November 21 NBC
The First 50 Years (7:00 pm. 16): gives itself a huge pat on the back in a 4-112 hour look at their first half-centurv of broadcasting. Orson Welles is the host-for a journey down memory lane that takes us from Rudy Vallee to Rowan and Martin with the help of film clips. old radio broadcasts, and half of Hollywood. Thunderbolt and Lightfoot (9:00 pm. 28): Clint Fastwood and Jeff Bridges star in this moderately interesting yarn about a young thief and a not-so-young thief who team up for a bank job. 
Monday, November 22 A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving (8:00 pm. 22): One of my personal favorites and, all things being equal, one of the higher quality shows on this week, finds Snoopy playing host to the gang for Thanksgiving dinner while Charles B. is out of town. All sophistication aside. the scene in which Snoopy is whipping up the feast (icc cream, popcorn, potato chips and toast) is really 
pretty funny. I guess that makes me a nerd. Wednesday. November 24 The French Connection (9:00 pm. 22): 
Somebody is trying to smuggle a ton of smack into the States but runs into some tough opposition in the person of Popeye Doyle (Gene Hackman). Based on a real-life incident, this 1971 hit is as honest in showing the seedy side of New York City as it is in portraying the seamier side of policework. 
Hot Air Balloon (4:30 pm, Green Field): The legal way to get high. See the Dome and all the other campus sights from the clouds as you soar majestically in an 8-story high hot-air balloon. Ride info at Green Fieln 
Pep Rally (6:30 pm. ACC): Featured speakers will be Offensive Line Coach Brian Boulac, J.V. Coach Francis Peay, Rick Slager, Danny Kelleher and Luther Bradley. Because of the Homecoming dance at Stepan, the rally will be held in the North Dome of the ACC. Everyone coming to the rally should use Gate 2.

South American novel described:.: 
by Kate Flynn Staff Reporter 

While experts currently consider the earliest Latin American novel to have been published in 1816. aa expert in the field told a large gathering in the library lounge yesterday that his discovery may push back that date. 
Dr. Harvey Johnson, professor emeritus at the University of Houston, disclosed that an anony­mous manuscript he found whiie searching through the catalogues of Chicago's Newberry Library "will inevitably revise history's view of the Latin American novel." 
The work, entitled El cadete mexicano was authored in the early 1790's. 
Professor Konrad Schaum, chair­man of the Modern --Languages Department. introduced Johnson, who is the author of four major works on Latin American culture and literature. 
In his lecture, Johnson charac­terized the six volumes of 1800 pages as a "pseudo-autobiographi­cal novel set down with temporal and geographical accuracy in a simple prose style." Johnson stressed that the plots, all episodic in nature, are continued through­out EI cedete mexicano with such "clock-like precision and historical vcracitv", that there is no doubt that this is the story of a real man. 
According to Johnson, the pro­tagonist Selicio, who "unifies all incidents and characters." repre­sents the author. His adventures, Johnson explained, are real. Ficti­tious subplots and characters were incorporated in picaresque style, 
Growth rate small 
(continued from page I) is based on the school's computer model of the economy. Professors Saul Hymans and Harold Shapiro said even if there is a $13 billion tax cut early next year, GNP would grow next year, by 4.3 percent, compared by the 6.2 percent growth they estimated for the current year. They estimated that the tax cut could reduce unemployment to about 6.5 per­cent by the end of next year. In another report. the Treasury Department, releasing its first effort at presenting government accounts in the financial statement format used by corporations, said government expenses exceeded re­venues for 1975 by $152.1 billion. This compares to a $43.6 billion deficit under the traditional ac­counting procedure used for gov­ernment financial reports. The new system included dollar estimates of government assets such as buildings and land. It also lists liabilities accrued for such things as Social Security which have not yet been paid. Accrued 
Social Security benefits alone added $83.4 billion in new expen­ses. 
The Treasury Department in the past reported only actual receipts and actual payments, Treasury 
Secretary William E. Simon, who initiated the new system, said he hoped it would "enable a more 
penetrating and realistic assess­ment of government programs and a better evaluation of the effect of the federal government on the. , nation'"s economy." ' . ,,·I.·, : \ ..).... ,.. 
however. to render the narrative as "fact and fiction confounded." 
The first volumes of th~ manu­script deal with the hero's birth in Seville and his subsequent journey to Veracruz at age twelve. where he resides with an unfit guardian. The bov then settles in Mexico Citv for six years as a student. Meticulously detailed accounts of Mexico City manners and customs arc recorded through the student's e:-·es. 
Selicio then joins the army in 1792. Johnson continued. to partic­ipate in the campaigns against the French forces in the Caribbean. particularly Haiti. 
The narrative continues with an imprisoning of the hero by the French. a bizarre escape from

This is the weekend that college football fans have been waiting for. By 9 p.m. Saturday night, the remaining four conference races will have been decided and the bowl bids will be out. 
Notre Dame renewed their slim hopes for a post season bid last week with their win over Alabama. Rumors abound about a possible Irish appearance in the Gatcrr Bowl. but one has to wonder if the Irish are willing to play in a •· minor" bowl. If the price is right, look for them to go. 
So here with the help of guest picker Tom "T.D." Desmond here are the irish Eye's picks for this weekend: 
Indiana at Purdue: The Boilers are playing better ball now than they've played in the last two years. There' not much to be said about IU. Purdue by 14. Desmond: This one's for the Old Oaken Bucket and the fans will shout ''win the bucket or.... " Boilers by 14. Lehigh at Lafayette: John Matt and his mates were shut out of the final Division II poll and they're fit to be tied. Engineers by 21 in a traditional battle. Desmond: Lehigh by 7. Tulane at LSU: Playing in BatonRougein a Saturday night is like trying to out-swim Jaws-hopeless. Tigers by 10. Desmond: No one wins in Baton Rouge unless they're the LSU Tigers. LSU by 14. Robinson State at Union: The Teds of Robinson State are rugged club, but tight end Bob Carey makes Union almost impossible to stop. Union by 41. Desmond: Union by 7. Dayton at Miami [o]: Just can't say no to Miami 0. Redskins by 6. Desmond. Miami Ly 10. West Ker<tucky Central of Ohio at Akron: WKCO is led by the hard-runnmg Czar Best and seem<; to be peaking just about now. Akron has "B11se" Busick and he's almost impossble to defense. The result -a tie. Desmond: Definitely a tie. Clemson at South Carolina: The Gamecocks were caught looking ahead last week, and they're ready to roll over the Tigers. Look for the Gamecocks to go bowling by 17. ')esmond: Gamecocks desparately want a bo'l\l bid and need a win for supremacy in the state of South Carolina. S.C. by l3. Virginia at Maryland: The Twerps (or is that Terps) wrap-up an undefeated season at home tomorrow. Maryland by 17. Desmond: Maryland by ltl. Iowa State at Oklahoma State: This one is for a share of theBigEight crown and an outside shot at the Orange Bowl. Iowa State by. Desmond: doth teams vying for Oranges...Oklahoma State by 10. Kan8118 Stat~ at Colorado: The Buffaloes are Orange Bowl bound. Colorado by 21. Desmond: .\ Buffalo win gives them a piece of the Big Eight pie. 2olorado by 17. Missouri at Kansas: The Tirers wish they had Dan Devine back. Tigers by 6. DtsmonC:: The rigers are better on the road than they are at home. Tigers ty 10. Michigan at Ohl<1 State: The Wolverines were beaten by Purdue, but they won't b( be.tten by OSU. Michigan will make their field goal this year. Wolves b.v 3. Desmond: Woody is a historian, and history repeats itselt. Buckeyes by 4. UCLA va Sot.the-n Cal: This is the game of the year. The winner could very wdl be the best team in the nation. SC has the better defense so make it Trojans by 5. Desmond: Winner of this game could conceiv.tbl) win the .National Championship come New Year's day. USC by 7. Mlaml [Fla.] at Notre Dame: Val Zurblis thinks this game may be closer than people think. ''It'll be tough, but the cold and it being the last home game should pull the Irish through," she said. "Rusty Lisch is an unknown quantity at quarterback, but I'm confident that he :-an do the job. Make it Notre Dame by 14." Desmond: Irish sek a bown bid...ND by $500,000 or so.

the Irish iccrs the rest of the \\·ay. A promising opening night win over Michigan State was tarnished by a third-period loss the following evening. Add three losses in four road games the last two weeks and :-.ou have a 2-4 team at present. The Irish need to play well this weekend to establish themselves as a factor in the race for the remainder of the season. 
The 6-5 overtime win at Michi­gan last Satruday was highlighted bv Brian Walsh's second hat trick of the vear. Walsh, who has been returnt;d to his usual center slot after a brief exodus to the blue line, leads the club with seven goab.

Krause denies Bowl rumors 
SOUTH BEND, Ind. [AP[ -Notre Dame Athletic Director Erlward .. Moose .. Krause predicted Thurs­day that the school's football team Wl;uld receive a number of bowl bids if it clckats the Univcrsitv of Miami. Fla. this Saturda~·. . 
However. he denied published reports that the 13th-ranked Irish arc dclinitcly headed for the Gator Bowl. 
"It could be the Libcrtv Bowl. it could be the Gator Bowl. ii could be the Fiesta Bowl." Krause said during a telephone interview. "If we win Saturdav, J"m sure there will be a few off~rs ... 
Krause expressed a preference for the school to send its team to one of the major bowl games. saying .. I'd like to go to the Sugar Bowl. Orange Bowl or Cotton Bowl. .. But he refused to rule out the possibility that Notre Dame will acl-cpt another invitation. 
''If the boys want to go to a game and the coaches recommend it. we would definitely consider it. Some­one I hope ~·ill give us an invitation." 
He dismissed as "absolutclv false" a story in the Orlando Sentinel Star that arrangements have been completed for the Irish. 7-2 on the season. to play in the Gator Bowl against either Nebraska or Penn State. 
The paper reported that Gator Bowl Executive Director George Olsen flew here earlier in the week to work out the details of Notre Dame's appearance in the game. 
·~That story coming out ofOrlando 
is absolutely false... Krause said. "There's no way he (Olsen) could have been here without breaking the rules." 
Bowl representatives are prohib­ited from extending invitations until this Saturday. 
"He was here to watch one of our games earlier in the season," Krause said, "but he wasn"t here this week. No one was here."
