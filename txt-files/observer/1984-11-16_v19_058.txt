Vietnafn accused <liinayesterday ofkilling Viet­namese civilians by firing shells and crossing the bonier in October and early November. The Vietnam News Agency, monitored in Bangkok. accused Olina of more than 100 "anned provocations" during the period and said Olina had sent five more infantry divi­sions to areas opposite Vietnam's Ha Tuyen and Lang Son provinces. Olinese troops crossed the bonier 15 times from October to early November, mined roads and warehouses, and kidnapped and assas­sinated Vietnamese, the news agency said.

Fire engulfed a mobile home in Conway, S.C., killing three children, after their mother lit candles to light the trailer and left to watch television next door, authorities said. The heat and flames kept firefighters from entering the mobile home in the Buck­sport community when they arrived shortly before 10 p.m. Wednes­day, Horry County Fire Chief Bob Maxwell said. Maxwell said the mother had put the children to bed approximately 30 minutes before the fire broke out and went next door, leaving three candles burning because the power had been turned off that day. However, Maxwell said the cause of the fire is still under investigation. -AP

"You're talking about a changed person when you talk about Jack Murphy today," Hender­son told The Tampa Tribune on Wednesday.

The Bank ofEnglandyesterday began distributing its new 20-pound note -with a slightly altered appearance intended to make it more difficult to forge. The note, worth about S25, is unchanged in size and general appearance, but has a new, more noticeable watermark of English playwright William Shakespeare in place of Queen Elizabeth Il's silhouette. A printed picture of the queen remains on the note, however. Sections of the note's silvery metal strip, which is costly and difficult for counterfeiters to copy, are discernible behind small windows, making it easier for bank clerks and customers to detect. -AP

How come no one ever goes to the Linebacker Lounge? 
Two four-foot leprechauns adorn the Edison Road side of the building, and Fighting Irish caps are on sale inside. A wide-screen television sits in the corner, and the drink prices here probably are lower than any place in town. Best of all, this bar is right across the street from Notre Dame. 
But few students ever go there. It's the Linebacker lounge. 
Branded as a "townie" bar, students pass by the Linebacker either to pay a fortune at fancy new places or to practice group perspiration and hearing loss at the Five Points taverns. 
Don Sizemore, a bartender at the lounge, wishes more students would stop in. "They have more man­ners. They're more intellectual," he says, unlike a few of his other patrons who, he says, act like something un­printable. "You treat people with respect and you get respect," he says-the sound advice one always expects to hear from bartenders. 
"It's geared more for people over 25," says Fred Neidlinger, one of the owners, "but when younger ones come in we like to see 'em. We'd like to get the stu­dents in, but not at the ex· pense ofolder alumni." 

Those folks -alumni and subway alums -obviously constitute the backbone of the bar's business, and many of them packed the place last Monday night. The ABC football game-even without Cosell -blared loudly from three televisions. Most everybody seemed to be Seahawk fans, including a huge jack lambert lookalike sitting next to me at the bar. He spent most of the night cussing at the referees. 
Only kind words, however, were directed to the three scantily-clad models prancing about the tavern. Monday night, of course, also is "Intimate Apparel Fas­hion Show" night, sponsored by Candlelight Fashions in Scottsdale Mall. 
"This is $20," said one, beginning her routine. "It's called 'Baby Doll' with French accents, a black satin bow in front and black puffy stuff." Puffy stuff? 
"Would you like to huy a raffle ticket?" she asked. I bought one, as did my friend, both of us unsure to whom we would give lingerie small enough to fit in a sandwich bag. The guy to my left already had purchased 14 chances. We didn't win, and neither did he. 
By 2 a.m., the Linebacker crowd thinned, leaving the two of us, Dan the bartender and Frank D. Romeo, nicknamed "Dino". Dino offered all sorts of advice on life, and before long the subject naturally turned to Notre Dame football.

Inside Friday 

"You gOl talent, you got to produce," says Dino, matter-offactly. "I don·t hate Faust. You just can't be a priest and coach at the same time," he says. The early game times and the way traffic is directed straight toward the toll road after the game has generated more resentment among the clientele. "Only two games this this year have contributed to South Bend, Indiana," says Dino. 
As I left the bar, I could not help wondering if stu­
dents had ever flocked to the linebacker Inn. Ap­parently not, at least not in the last decade. 
"I graduated in 1974," says Mike Garvey, assistant director of public relations and information at Notre Dame, "and I think I was there maybe three times in my career as a student. There were a few dirtballs who would go there be­cause it would stay open later. But it never rivaled Corby's or Nickie's. It was talked about, but it's never been a popular student bar." 
Back then, says Garvey, the tavern had a cement floor and offered little more than tables and beer. Nowadays, carpeting hides 
the foundation, and a juke box plays a mix of modern rock, country and even a· version of the Victory March that must be 30 years old. 
Neidlinger says he varies the music to please all age groups. "We have a DJ on Friday nights, and 75 percent ofthe music he plays is geared to the young." I certainly did not feel uncomfortable there, and one does not have to major in economics to appreciate 6S cent drafts. 
"The prices are right, and I'm sure you're going to have a good time here," says Dino. "But you're going to get carded." Underage sorts should head farther south­west on State Road 23, but for those students looking for something new, the linebacker's worth more than a passing glance. Try a Monday.

College Bowl returns 
By KATHRYN HUMM 
News Staff 

The College Bowl Tournament, a question and answer game, will be held at Saint Mary's College during the first two weeks of December, said Georgenna Rosenbush, assistant director ofStudent Activities. 
Now entering its eighth season, the College Bowl On-Campus Pro­gram, co-sponsored by the Associa­tion of College Unions-International, features intra­mural and intercollegiate champion­ship play. 
Rosenbush said the intramural game is played by two teams of four who compete for points by answer­ing toss-up and bonus trivia ques­tions. At the end of the two seven-minute halves, the team with the highest score wins. 
Questions for the College Bowl are taken from many subject areas: literature, histor;· current events, science, religion, philosophy, myt­hology, art, music, rock, drama, sports and films. The emphasis is on quick recall and entertainment for players and the audience, Rosen­bush said. 
The winning team from Saint Mary's will travel to the University of Illinois, Urbana/Champaign, Ill., on the weekend of Feb. 16 and 1 7 to compete against other colleges from Illinois and Indiana. 
Rosenbush said all Saint Mary's students are encourged to partici· pate. According to Rosenbush, the registration date has been extended to Nov. 28, to allow more teams the opportunity to sign up. The games will be played on Dec. 2 and 9 from 1 to 5 in the Haggar College Center. Registration forms are available at the information desk in Haggar Col­lege Center. 
Robin Delaune, Chairman of the 1984 College Bowl Tournament said, 'I think everyone who par­ticipates will have fun. We're hoping to spark enough enthusiasm this year to revitalize the program. 

Smoking week at SMC ends 
ByJULIA HEWSON 
News Staff 
After a series of special events, in­cluding a non-smoking section in the dining hall, Smoking Awareness Week at Saint Mary's concluded Wednesday with a campus-wide "No Smoking Day". 
The week, sponsored by the Stu­dent Nurses Association, was planned to coincide with the nationally-observed Smoking Awareness Week. This is one of the health awareness efforts planned for the students and community this year, and is the first event of its kind at Saint Mary's, said junior Katie Schoen, chairman of Smoking Awareness Week. 
In observance of the week, the McCandless side of the dining hall was reserved for non-smoking stu­dents. Information was provided about the hazards of smoking, ano ashtrays were removed from many ofthe tables. 
The Student Nurses Association also provided free brochures on "How to Quit", available at the dining hall during the dinner hours. Any student who crushed a cigarette at the information recieved a free lollipop. Letters were sent to the fac­ulty of the Nursing Department as­king them to encourage students as well as teachers to participate in the week. 
According to Schoen, the results of this week have been promising. Students responded favorably or in­differently to the nl>n-smoking sec­tion in the dining hall, she said. The cafeteria will be deciding if these changes should be permanent. Schoen said the event was definitely a success and several students had even spoken to her about "kicking the habit."

Student should serve 


on Board of Trustees 
How can students be fairly represented in the formation ofUniversity policy 
without representation on the Board of Trustees? How can the Notre Dame 
administration believe the board can clearly understand student opinion with­
out the input of someone who is in the middle of it all? And how can Notre 
Dame students be satisfied with the way things are done at the University when 
they are allowed only token presentations at board committee meetings? 
The lack ofa student on the board is blatantly inconsistent with the philoso­phy of a community established for the advancement of its members' knowl­edge. The attitude of the administration on this issue is disturbing, as is evidenced by Vice President for Student Affairs Father David Tyson's explana­tion for the absence of a student trustee. "I don't know why there is not a student on the board," he said in Monday's Obseroer article in this week's special series on the issue, "but I suspect it was decided in 1967, when the board was set up, to not include a student on the board." 
This is not a legitimate excuse. To dismiss this injustice as a tradition or as a matter decided 1 7 years ago is unacceptable. It is time to re-examine the issue. Itis time to take a long look at the reasons for this lack ofrepresentation. And it · is time to let students have reasonable input in the way things are done around here. 
The student government cannot have the same kind of influence on the administration as a student trustee. Student government is fine for doing things such as putting lights on basketball courts, but when it comes to affecting University policy, few seem to take it seriously, neither the students nor the· administration. 
Notre Dame would do well to take a look across U.S. 31 at Saint Mary's as an example ofhow a student successfully can represent her peers on the College's governing body. The College's Board of Regents has had a student representa­tive as a contributing member to its meetings since the board's beginnings. It should serve as an example of a system which has overcome the excuses and does a good job offairly representing its students in the formation ofpolicy. 
Other schools also have overcome the traditional explanations which resurface whenever the issue is brought up. While the University ofKentucky's board is required by state law to include a student, its board is "sensitive to what is happening on campus" because ofits student trustee, according to Tim Freudenberg, UK student trustee. 
Notre Dame Board Chairman Thomas Carney's reasoning that a student trus­tee would be ineffective because of the need for confidentiality is proven in­correct by the success ofthe Saint Mary's and University ofKentucky's boards. 
Also mistaken is Student Body President Robert Bertino. He said that because a student is only here for four years, a student trustee would lack the foresight demanded by a position on the ultimate governing body of the Uni­versity. This simply is not true. Because the student is participating in the University experience he or she would serve as a gauge ofstudent opinion and would be able to give integral insight in the formation ofpolicy by the board. 
We are convinced that appointing a student trustee is an excellent idea. Where is the courage on the part ofNotre Dame to take this bold step? Students at this University, no matter the head-patting from its administrators, are not being heard. Allowing a student to serve as a voting member of the Board of Trustees is a move that should have been made 17 years ago. 

Current student voice does not have muscle 
Yesterday, student government flexed the only muscle it has with Notre 
Dame's Board of Trustees: a three-hour meeting with the trustees' Student 
Affairs Committee and a handful of administrators. 
It was a friendly and relaxed meeting, and the three student presentations ­which addressed the role ofwomen at Notre Dame, senior townhouses and an alcohol-free social life-were all well prepared and clearly stated. 
But when 6 o'clock rolled around and the trustees closed their folders to head offto dinner, it did not seem as if much had been accomplished. 
Lyons Hall President Joan Cahill argued strongly against sex discrimination in the admissions office, but with the exception of a few outspoken trustees, it was unclear if the committee will recommend to the entire board that more women be admitted to the University. Executive Coordinator Alison Yurko proposed building on-campus townhouses for seniors, but when questions were asked about funding and location, the discussion stalemated. Executive Coordinator Doug Wurth asked for the trustees' support of new social-life op­portunities, including an undergraduate club. But the trustees wanted specifics, and the discussion turned into little more than a brainstorming ses­sion. 
So much for muscle. 

The trouble is that at Notre Dame student government is a misnomer. The administration has never allowed student government to have any legislative powers whatsoever. So when the cries from LaFortune's second floor fall on deaf ears under the Golden Dome, it seems only logical to take student con­cerns before the Board ofTrustees. 
But that does not work either. As trustee Anthony Early said yesterday, the Student Affairs Committee can only listen and tell the entire board what it heard. "We are an advisory committee," Early said. "Whether or not we can do anything is another matter. We are not involved with the administration of the University." 
It seems a shame that the students' greatest influence in policy decisions is to tell someone who can only tell someone else.

Finishing those peas do starving little good 
No one who has been watching the nightly news lately could help but feel uncomfortable about the horrible pictures brought to us from Ethiopia, concerning the continuing famine there. Of course, we have all seen those pictures before: the living human skeletons, the bloated stomachs, the flies and fleas crawl­ing all over the babies. But it is always discon­certing for us to be confronted with these pictures we are good at forgetting, and we tend to be resentful ofthose people who feel it 
Faustin Weber 
guest column 

is their moral duty to remind us. We are all aware of the burden that our afiluence places upon us, but we become tired of that burden and the seeming hopelessness of the whole situation. What can we possibly do in the face of our limited supply and their inexhaustible demand? Very little it seems, and so we do things designed to allay our uneasiness and help us forget. 
Perhaps we throw a couple of bucks into the collection basket for the missionary who preached at Sunday Mass. Or maybe we signed up for the Wednesday fast. Or perhaps we even participated in the Hunger Meal a few weeks ago. Or possibly we have consciously not participated in any of these things, and have made for ourselves a moral justification on this position by claiming that our involve­ment will do very little in the general scheme of things -the "poor will be with us always" argument. I believe all four of these actions, though marked perhaps by a deep sincerity (even the last one), often belie a more profound unwillingness on our part to accept the burden that our afiluence places upon us. 
We give a few bucks here and there, maybe to a "consciousness-raising" event or lecture at the Center for Social Concerns, but the result is too easily that we feel as if we have 'done something' and can go about our lives with an easier conscience. My purpose is not to try to undermine admirable groups such as the World Hunger Coalition, or those working at the Center for Concerns, or to imply they are trying to simply ease our conscience. Yet it is to say that this is often the result of such consciousness-raising events, and if this is so, it is better not to have them -and let us be uneasy. 
Such a statement might seem unfair to the organizers of these events, for it is precisely this moral uneasiness which they are trying to create. But I have never been a big believer in consciousness-raising events, especially if they are divorced from any concrete action like fund-collecting. I refer more specifically to the recent World Hunger Coalition meal. If you are like I am you have been doing this since freshmen year in high school, and the whole thing has taken on a ritualistic form; once a year we all go eat rice and drink un­sweetened tea, and thereby supposedly have new understanding and insight into what those poor starving people in Ethiopia must be experiencing. But ofcourse, we do not. We cannot. How can we; the same network which brings us the picture from Ethiopia is sponsored after all, by Purina Cat Chow (chow, chow, chow) and Charmin toilet paper (starring Mr. Whipple). Ours is a com­pletely different world. We can never even hope to understand that poverty (unless, I guess, we move to Ethiopia and begin starving ourselves.) The problem with trying is that it often leads to a moral inertia, in that it makes us believe we have actually "done something" for those people, when in fact all we have 
done is deluded ourselves. 

I finished the Hunger Meal feeling good that I had participated. But of course I had not done anything more than those who refused to participate · those to whom I was easily led to feel morally superior. As we found out later, no money was donated from the dining halls. Thus to me the whole thing makes little more sense than my grandmother's argument about why I should finish eating my peas: "Think of all those starving people in India; it would be a sin to waste them." Finishing my peas does those Indians very little good. Neither does my "consciousness being raised" really help out those Ethiopians. It is even harmful if it leads to this moral inertia. 
What then, do I propose? Simply forget about these starving Ethiopians? Hardly. We can all give concrete aid to th~se people in terms of money, and for some of us, with our lives. But we should be persuaded to do so in a way that always makes us feel very uneasy, as if we have never done enough. We bear a bur­den for our affiuence, and we should frankly admit to ourselves that we do not like this bur­den, and will subconsciously try to rationalize it away. And more concretely, we should do away with other "consciousness-raising" events such as the Hunger Meal, at least until we can get a real financial commitl)lent from the dining halls. I find Notre Dame Food Services Director Bill Hickey's statement that the dining halls did not save a substantial amount from the meal very hard to believe ­not only because of the cheaper cost of the meal for those who participated but also be­cause the combined total count for both dining halls was significantly lower than a reg­ular dinner. The problem is that if there is no concrete financial outcome from these proj­ects I will have done little more for those Et­hiopians than the eating of my leftover peas.

Last, best hope of man according to Johnson 
Dear Editor: 
Thomas Jefferson once said that this nation is the "last, best hope of man". And indeed, even as one of those Evil Liberals daily vilified in your newspaper, I still believe it. I do not accept the thought that we were put on this earth, in this rich nation, at this particular time in history, simply to eat, live, and die. I love my nation, but not just for what it is today; rather, for what it can be if we are willing to work for what our nation really stands for. 
There are many voices in this land telling us that in order to be an American, we must love our country simply for what it is and be satisfied with that. They say our nation should no longer stand for any principles or ideals, since it is so bothersome to try and do so. W c no longer protest the increasing misery ofthe poor at a time when we are getting better off; we no longer protest when our nation alone abstains from the responsibility ofstriking out against South Africa's destruction of a people; we no longer seem to care when our nation sinks to the moral level ofits adversaries in the world, apparently believing that we must become the things we hate in order to get the things we love.

ministration, as well as many of the students who supported the plan, chose to look upon the vote as a consciousness-raising message, not a request for officially sanctioned suicide. I am not so sure, however, that the referen­dum is not better as an actual alternative in­stead of a symbolic one. 
I feel torn between two views. Part of me is optimistic: it believes that human beings have the wisdom required to avoid nuclear self­destruction. The other part is pessimistic: it believes that I am a fool to disregard the end­less historical examples of the same human failings. This part says that I should take my cyanide now: it says that we will eventually destroy ourselves, and probably sooner than later. 
My optimistic side points me to the belief that human beings are basically good. Human beings have had trouble for centuries, yet we

I, however, believe that the bad times have been caused

partially paranoid 
by something else -the home game environ­ment. Let's face it, we are 4-0 on the road (Purdue was officially a home game). This leads me to the conclusion that something is wrong with our home games. It seems that whenever it rains at home, we lose. Whenever we have cable 1V coverage at home, we lose. I now present a few modest proposals which might hopefully help the Irish next season. 
The simplest solution would be to schedule all of next year's games on the road. Since we cannot win home games, we might as well play them all in everyone else's stadiums and win. This, of course, would be quite un­workable. After a while, the team and the fans have flourished. Look at the Jose Duartes, the John Pauls, the Mohandas Gandhis of our world. Your fear ofthe atomic bomb is foolish. After all, the Bomb has been around since 1945 and we are still hen:, though many a chance went by when more foolish men would have used it. 

My pessimism laughs as it counters my opti­mistic side. It bases its claim on the fundamen­tal reality that, while our knowledge has increased through the centuries, our con­cepts ofwisdom and justice have not grown to meet this new knowledge. Human knowledge has yielded an evolution of warmaking devices; from a simple beginning ofstones and clubs, we have created nuclear weaponry and its globe-girdling delivery systems. Our wis­dom, however, remains blinded on two criti­cal points: we believ~ that each new weapon is the ultimate weapon and that each war is the last war. We were once foolish enough to believe that the atomic bomb was the ultimate weapon. The hydrogen bomb, the neutron bomb, and new chemical and biological ordnance indicate that we have only begun to discover creative new ways to destroy our­selves. People in 1919 referred to the worldwide conflict of the last four years as "The Great War"-that is, until World War II. We build bigger, "better" weapons, yet we refuse to acknowledge that we do not have the wisdom to deal with them. 
Our sense of justice seems to be as faulty as 
might get tired of travelling every week. 
Besides, with no home games to draw 
thousands of tourists, the entire South Bend 
economy would crash into ruin and never 
recover. 

The solution then, is to convince the team that they are playing an away game, even though they are at home. If all of the Notre Dame fans dressed in the rival team's colors and cheered against the Irish, perhaps the team would he fooled. Another way to try to fool the team would be to place microphones in the visiting sections. If their cheers were amplified, the pseudo-away game atmosphere would be quite believable. Then, the team will think that they are on the road and will win the game. 
Whenever a home game is covered by a cer­tain cable TV network, we always seem to lose. Now, the simplest solution would be to ban the television crews from the stadium. We have done well enough with just radio coverage for fifty years. Alas! The loss in 1V revenues, however, would probably finan­cially cripple our friends at the ACC who sit on plush chairs in elegant offices. 
So, how does one convince the team that they are not on televison when they really are? If we camoflauged the camera men in whirt skirts and gave them porn pons and megaphones? Well, on second thought, I am 
not sure if the camera men's union would like 
that. 

Maybe it is the fact that ESPN is covering 
our games. The team seems to do well onABC, 
but why not ESPN? The reason is, I believe, 
that no one thinks of ESPN as a legitimate net­
work. After all, how many television networks 
havefour letters in their acronym title? There 
is also something about the letter "E"; it seems 
so mild and unaggressive. When you hear 
ABC, you think of the American Broadcast 
Company. When you hear NBC, you think of 
the National Broadcast Company. But, when 
you hear ESPN, what do you think of? In a 
recent poll, four out of five dentists recom­
mended sugarless gum and believed that 
ESPN stood for the English, Spanish and Por­
tuguese Network. 

If those letters confuse the fans, imagine what they do to the team. "All right men, listen up. We are going to be playing this game on ESPN. Huh? Isn't that like AstroTurf?" 
Well, even if we cannot schedule all of our games on the road or convince ESPN to change their logo, there is one thing we can do here at home. I have hear someone com­pare our offense to an old Plymouth-It runs great when it is dry outside, but it sputters when it gets wet. 
our sense of wisdom. This country con­
demned the Holocaust; at the same time, the 
United States took part in the fire-storming of 
Dresden. Though Dresden was thought to 
have no strategic importance, at least 135,000 
people were burned alive as the Allies turned 
the city into an edificial furnace. As far as dis­
crimination on the basis ofrace is concerned, 
our country also incarcerated almost 80,000 
United States citizens, merely because they 
were of Japanese descent. Our war-making 
ability continues to be far more developed 
than our sense of justice. 
My pessimism relentlessly continues its cri­tique. Nuclear deterrence is based on ven­geance alone, it points out. Deterrence is supposed to prevent countries from launch­ing their weapons, due to fear of a coun­terstrike by the attacked country. Once a country's weapons are actually launched, however, deterrence has already failed. As Michael Walzer put it, "the use of our deter­rent capacity would be an act of pure destructiveness." Besides, biological warfare is ready to leap into any gap left by a nuclear 
peace. In addition to the "advantages" of being cheaper to make and easier to launch, certain biological weapons oxidize, leaving a country ready to occupy in a matter ofhours, days, or weeks instead of nuclear half-lives. 
Just over a week ago, the majority of the citizens of the United States used their most direct governmental influence, the vote, tore-

not made some sort of serious effort to gain 
world peace. They re-elected a president 
who, by agreeing to put U.S. missiles in West­
ern Europe, both upset the balance of power 
and drew a threat ofautomated, unnegotiable 
retaliation from the Soviets -a threat that may 
soon become reality. They re-elected a presi­
dent who said that the time for making swords 
into plowshares had passed, a president who 
made jokes about global annihilation. It is no 
wonder that I am somewhat pessimistic. 

I believe that I have plenty of reason to be 
ambivalent. On the one hand, I believe in 
basic human goodness and in the occasional 
outstanding peacemaker. On the other hand, I 
suspect that such beliefs are foolish: perhaps I 
am merely attempting to close my mind to the 
inexorable weight of human history and 
humanity's tendency for knowledge, rather 
than wisdom and justice. 

Write your political representatives. Inves­

Ground Zero. Show those in power that you 
don't want to die byany form ofsuicide, espe­
cially nuclear suicide. Ifyou are not willing to

keep your cyanide handy: the next four years ­

It seems that whenever kickoff time is 
changed for television coverage, it rains. A 
simple solution would be to let the 1V people 
change the time. Then, the day before the 
game, move the kickoff back to its normal 
time. Hopefully, both the 1V people and the 
rain clouds would show up long after the 
game. 

Well, just suppose for an instant that we had 
an opportunity to get the team out of the rain

that giving up our present stadium would be a 
great loss of tradition. But hey, that new

Larry Williams 
Injuries end hopes for excellent season 
Mike Golic 
N D tri-captai n 
ByJOE BRUNETTI 
Sports Writer 

For college athletes, their senior season is always supposed to be something special. It should be a season full ofvictories and injury-free play. 'That is what every senior athlete would like. For a football player, a perfect senior year would be capped off by a national champion­ship. 
However, for Notre Dame guard Larry Williams this year hasn't come close to being a perfect senior season. 
It has hardly been a season full ofvictories that will lead to a national championship for the Irish. To make matters worse, Williams has been hampered constantly by ligament problems in his ankle and knee that have prevented him from playing the way he would like to. 
For Williams the '84 season just hasn't lived up to his expectations. 
"I didn't think that I would get hurt at all (this year). I thought that I would put in a good solid year and just let the chips fall where they may," says the Califronia resident. "As it has turned out I haven't played as much as I wanted to or practiced as much as I should have." 
Not only have Williams' personal expectations not been fulfilled, but his expectations for the team have also been fruitless. "My expectations going into this season were for a national championship," says the American Studies major. "I expected nothing but the best (for this team). I thought we were doing it. We had all the tools. I thought we had the spirit behind it too. It (this season) was an incredible disappointment. When you see that many injuries, everyone gets a little down. I guess everyone felt a little sorry for themselves for a while, too. 
Williams attributes several things to the team's falling short ofhis expectations. "The injuries were a major pan, but we also got down on ourselves. We started making mistakes that we made as freshman or sop­homores," he explains. "A great team would make their own breaks. We had too many mental breakdowns to be a great team."

But everything went well in preparation for the season opener against Purdue in the Hoosier Dome -see GOLIC, page 12 Golic had adjusted well to his coach, defensive end and outside linebacker coach Bishop Harris, and the shoulder was ready to go. However, for the second time, misfortune struck the outside linebacking position ofthe Irish ­Mike Larkin -as Golic sustained a deep shoulder bruise, or so he thought, ofhis other shoulder. 
"In the Purdue game, my shoulder felt bad, but I thought I could work it out," Golic recalls. "It loosened up, so I returned in the second half, but every time I did some hitting, it felt 

Williams entered the season as a highly-touted lineman that was selected to many preseason all­America teams, but after an injury-plagued season, Williams' name probably won't appear on any post­season all-America teams. "I really don't care (about being picked as an all-American), but being injured has just about demolished my chances," comments the 276-pounder. "That doesn't bother me as much as our record and that my ability to perform has been shot to heck." 
The injuries to his ankle and knee have forced the captain to miss most ofthe practices during the week and this has also affected his leadership capabilities. "Being injured has made it difficult for me to be a leader because I'm not real vocal," comments Williams. "I try to lead by example and by not being on the field in practice to partcipate in drills takes away from my leadership role." 
In fact, Williams' practice time has been so limited that from the time ofhis initial ankle injury in the Purdue game until the Air Force game he only practiced two days during that five-week period. However, since the week ofthe South Carolina game the senior has been able to practice every day. 
"Its a weird feeling to go out on Saturday and play without practicing. My timing is off and I haven't played like I should," says Williams. "It has really taken away from my skills." 
Since Williams' return to the practice field the week ofSouth Carolina, the offensive line has seen great improvement over previous performances, and the running game has also come to life. "On the whole, our offensive line play hasn't been good. We are a veteran group that has been working together for a long time. We missed assignments," says Williams. "After South Carolina, we got our confidence back and got back to our old ways." 
The renewed life of the offensive line has definitely helped tailback Allen Pinkett who has had three

Bouncing back 
Doug Strang comes off bench to sh_ut up critics 
By GREG LODER 
Sports Writer 
Penn State Daily Collegian 
Slowly and all alone at midfield, he walked to the sideline with his head hung low. He had just made a statement to more than 85,000 people and a regional television audience in the only and best way he knew how. 
At the other end of the field in the south end zone, his teammates were celebrating Herb Bellamy's 42-yard touchdown catch, but there at midfield the person who threw the ball was celebrating deep down inside. 
For Penn State quarterback Doug Strang, the 1984 season has been a lonely one at certain times. After being benched because of his inability to move the Lion offense in the West Virginia game, and not getting the start against Boston College two weeks ago; it was unclear if the senior would see much time running the Penn State offense ever again. 

But when Strang delivered the ball to Bellamy, a pass that was misjudged by a Boston College defender, the Linwood, N.J., native overcame numerous barriers only he knew could be knocked down. 
And when the quarterback, who led the Lions to a wild 37-30 win over then-No. 9 Boston College, was mobbed by reporters after the game, again he was making statements the best way he knew how. 
"I believed I was going to come back and nobody can tell me different that I can't go out there and play quarterback," a quiet Strang said. 
In the middle ofthe week before the game with the Eagles, Penn State Head Coach Joe Paterno made a move toward the future when he decided to start sophomore John Shaffer against Boston College. Shaffer, who played for Notre Dame's Gerry Faust at Moeller High School in Cincinnati, Ohio, had a superb game in the loss to West Virginia and this season has thrown for 385 yards while completing 29 ofhis 68 passes. 
When Strang replaced Shaffer at the end of the first quarter against the Eagles, he was greeted with a chorus ofboos from fans who remembered a 6-0 shutout loss to Alabama and a three-point offensive performance against Texas. 
Paterno's move to Strang was forced by a slight concussion that Shaffer suffered in the first quarter, which left him without peripheral vision in the left eye. Paterno said Strang was probably the right choice. 
"I was glad to see him have such a good game," Paterno said.

Doug Strang PSU quarterback 
"With all the blitzing B.C. was doing and all that pressure they were putting on the quarterback, we felt in the back of our minds that he may have to be the guy to get us out of it." 
The boos continued in the B.C. game when Strang missed on his first four passes. But with 7:38 remaining in the half, Strang connected on the first Penn State completion of the day for the touchdown to Bellamy. The boos subsided, but, for the quarterback methodically heading for the sideline, the criticism was all but forgotten. 
"I'm not going to stoop down to anybody's level and say they weren't fair," Strang said. "I'm not going to say anything back. They can say anything they want, but I know deep down inside and the team knows inside what the truth is." 
Flanker Rocky Washington, who has caught one ofStrang's five touchdown passes this year, is one who has a lot of confidence in Strang. "I've been saying all year long that Doug Strang is a good quarterback." the senior from Beaver Falls, Pa., says. "It seems that everyone is bandwagon-jumping. Ifhe's doing good they love him, and if he's doing bad they hate him. He's a good quarterback and sometimes you have to stay with someone like that." 
Center Nick Haden said being benched was a tough thing for 
Strang to handle. ''I'm sure he was a little bit bummed out about 
what happened, but the thing is, Doug's a winner," Haden said. "I 
told him, 'Hey, just keep your head up.' I knew he was going to be 
in there, I just had a gut feeling." 
All season long, Paterno and his teammates have been loyal to 
Strang. Paterno cites inexperienced wideouts and an injury to 
tailback D.J. Dozier as "tough circumstances" for anyone. 
But with all the support, Strang said he had to realize his day was not over when he was benched. "I had to approach it like I was going to play," Strang said. "I didn't want john to get hurt or anything bad to happen to him, but I was hoping some way, somehow, I was going to get a chance to play again. 
"Hopefully I proved to myself that I'm a winner. I might not go out and have the most awesome stats, but I think I proved that we can bring Penn State's offense and we can score somehow, some way." 
Statistically this season, Strang has posted numbers that are far from his 18 touchdowns and nearly 2,000 passing yards from last year. He has completed 54 of 138 passes for 783 yards and eight touchdowns and five interceptions. 
The one statistic that is an improvement for Strang is his 245 rushing yards, with 52 of those yards coming against Boston College. Many of the runs against the Eagles were for key first 
While it has been an up-and-down season for Strang, the senior remains confident going into Saturday's game with Notre Dame, which Paterno has announced he will start. "I really hope it can be an example that you're not down-and-out until you think you're down-and-out," he said. "People put you down and people talk behind your back, but you're not done as a football player until you think you are." 
----------------------~~~~~============

Harris was in quite a bind after losing Golic but the injury affected the defense less than expected. "Of course it hurts to lose a player of his caliber, but it also has allowed some players to progress because of the roles they had to perform early in the season. I'm proud of how he has responded to his injury. He has been a positive influence on the other members ofthe defense." 
Golic knows that he has to put the injury behind him and try not to let it affect his performance. "It's hard to forget an injury, but I have to put it aside because I'm a captain and I can't let down the team. That's what it is to he a competitor." 
At the end of the I983 season, Golic experienced what he calls "one of my greatest honors." He was named the defensive captain for the 1984 season. The management major has his own idea of what he should do in his role. "For me, to have good communication and to be open is what my role is," Golic states. "We don't need dissention between the players and coaches. I also think that a captain should be some­what ofa motivator. Ifthe defense gives up a big play, I feel it's my job to get us fired up again and to tell the players not to worry about it. I try to lead by example and to keep people thinking about doing the best job they can. I must admit that it was difficult when I wasn't out there.'' 
"Mike is excellent player, especially considering the amount of adversity that he has experienced this season," Harris says. "He's done a super job ofhandling the responsibility ofbeing captain, also." 
Mike's older brother Bob also had the honor of being a captain for Notre Dame, leading the 1978 Irish. But all of the members of the Golic family shun comparison. "We never have compared ourselves to the other. We've all had different styles," Golic notes. "Ifanything, we help each other out, like Bobby and I working out together over the summer." 
The youngest Golic has benefitted from the fact that his older brothers Bob and Greg preceded him at Notre Dame. "I saw Notre Dame from two perspectives," he says. "I came up for Bobby's games 
when I was in the seventh grade. I was in awe of great 
players like Willie Fry and Ross Browner. When Greg 
began to play here, I was a senior in high school, so I 
thought about the players as people who were more 
like me because they were closer in age. 
"Through those six years, even though I looked at 
the football program the most, I saw that there was so 
much more to Notre Dame than football. When it 
came down to making a decision. There really wasn't a 
choice for me." 
There was a great deal ofoutside pressure for Mike to fill the shoes of Bob, the second-leading tackler in Irish history. The basis for comparison was obvious. Mike even wore the same jersey number-55. "I'm not trying to fill anybody's shoes," states the Notre Dame senior. "The reason I came here is because I was fortunate enough to be led by a father who played football. He knows that football is just a shot in the dark, and after a career of maybe ten years, which is really long these days, you have to have a good 
education to be able to work for you. 
''I'll always rememberJoe Restic talking about how academics and athletics are mixed at Notre Dame better than anywhere else in the country. My parents taught us that even after football is over, you've still got 50 years of your life left." 
Another one of the high points in Mike's career was the Michigan State game last season. "It was really exciting for both Greg and me in the Michigan State game," Mike states, "because we were both starting at the same time. It was the first time that Greg has started. Greg's probably the hardest worker of us three, because he didn't have all ofthe physical talent Bobby and I had." 
Mike also used his physical talent when he com­peted for the Notre Dame wrestling team. In the past two years, he has performed well for the Irish in the heavyweight division. His record for two years stands at 38-6. ''I'd like to wrestle this season. I think wres­tling has helped out football for me," Golic says. "It has

given me better agility and balance. When you're out there, it's just you against the other guy, either you win or you lose, all by yourself. That takes a lot ofdis­cipline. But, in football, there are ten other guys out there to back you up." 
The thing that might keep him off the wrestling mats, though, is the fact that he is interested in playing football in the professional ranks and doesn't want to hurt himself again. "I would definitely like to play pro football," Mike says. "Pro is quite a bit different from college. They pick you, instead of you picking them. I hope I play until the fun ends, but because the type of sport football is, I'd think it would be hard to play if you didn't like what you were doing." 
'Ibe fun in football for the Notre Dame defensive captain will not end with his last home game under the Golden Dome. But it does bring to an end the line of Golics playing in Notre Dame Stadium.

Taming the Lions 
Healthier Irish look for consistency against PSU 
By LARRY BURKE 
Sports Writer 

Football returns to Notre Dame Stadium Saturday as the Nittany 
lions ofPenn State will take on the Irish at 12:20 p.m. EST in Notre 
Dame's final home appearence of the 1984 season. 
For the 5-4 Irish it is a chance to win their third straight game, 
and also an opportunity to snap a three-game home losing streak 
and a three-game skid against joe Paterno's Nittany Uons. For Penn 
State, 6-3, Saturday's game is an opportunity to establish some 
consistency, coming off a big 37-30 win over Boston College. 
This game figures to be particularly hard-fought because both 
teams have had an extra week to prepare, as well as recuperate 
from injuries. 

"The games we've played with Penn State the last few years have 
been great ones for the fans, even though we haven't won any of 
them," says Irish Head Coach Gerry Faust. "With both teams having 
an extra week to get ready and to get some injured people back, 
there's no reason to think this one won't be in that same league. 
Obviously, this is a big game for both teams, and I'm sure that 
intensity will be reflected. Penn State is coming offa big win over 
Boston College, and I'm sure they would like to carry that 
momentum over against us. We certainly didn't play well against 
Navy, but we did win and we've won two in a row. Ifwe eliminate 
the errors and play the way we're capable ofplaying, we can 
accomplish a lot in these last two games. 
"It means an awful lot to us to get healthy with the week off. We expect to have (flanker) Milt jackson, (cornerback) Troy Wilson, (tailback) Alonzo Jefferson, (linebacker) Mike Kovaleski, and (guard) Larry Williams all back. We won't know about (tight end) Mark Bavaro until later, plus there's a possibility either (linebacker) Tony Furjanic or (tackle) Ron Plantz might have a chance to get back in there. It's the last home game for the seniors and we'd like to make it a special one for them, especially considering we haven't played very well here at home this year so far." 
Penn State's offense vs. Notre Dame's defense: 
The Nittany Lions have done some shuffling at the quarterback position this season. Senior Doug Strang had the starting job for most of the season, but sophomoreJohn Shaffer, a product of Cincinnati's Moeller High School, got the nod against B.C. As things turned out, it was Strang who came off the bench impressively last week after Shaffer suffered a first-period concussion. Strang has not been outstanding-completing just 39 percent (54 of 138) ofhis passes, for 783 yards, five touchdowns and seven interceptions-but he has gotten the job done for most of the season. Nonetheless, Paterno has shown that he won't hesitate to go to Shaffer ifStrang i'i having problems. 
Penn State averages 345 yard~ per game, 208 of them on the ground. Tailback D.J. Dozier has come back from an early-season groin injury in fine style, breaking the 100-yard barrier in each of his last three games. In six games this season, the sophomore has carried 102 times for 578 yards and four touchdowns. joining 
Dozier in the Penn State backfield are fullback Steve Smith ( 67 
carries for 355 yards and five touchdowns, including 126 yards and 
two touchdowns against B.C.) and reserve tailback Tony Mumford 
( 97 carries for 434 yards and two touchdowns). 
Top receivers for the Nittany Uons are sophomore split end Herb Bellamy ( 16 catches for 306 yards and two touchdowns), flankers Eric Hamilton ( 14 receptions for 196 yards) and Rocky Washington ( 11 catches for 194 yards and a touchdown), and tight end Dean DiMidio (eight receptions for 122 yards and a touch­down). 
The Irish defense is coming off its best statistical outing of the season against Navy, allowing only 205 total yards. Overall the Irish are permitting 331 yards per game, 182 of them on the ground. 
Notre Dame will benefit from the week off in that leading tackler linebacker Mike Kovaleski (sprained wrist) and cornerback Troy Wilson (severe thigh bruise) are expected back off the injured list. 
Notre Dame's offense vs. Penn S1ate's defense: 
Frequent use of the double tight end formation has had an immediate effect on Notre Dame's statistics. The Irish averaged 290 yards per game through the first six weeks of the season, but that figure has jumped to 393 over the last three games. Notre Dame's possession, hall-control offense has averaged 14 more offensive plays per game over the last three games than it did through the first six. 
Tailback Allen Pinkett has keyed the resurgence of the offense, raising his season stats to 818 yards on 214 carries, with 12 
touchdowns. Bothered early in the season by the after-effects ofa 
spring ankle injury, Pinkett has come back to run for over 160 
yards in each ofhis last two games. 
"There's no question we've been a lot more productive the last 
three games," says Faust. "Part of it has been getting our lineup 
healthy, especially people like Larry Williams. But part ofit has 
been getting off the ball better and being able to run the ball with 
greater success. Pinkett has looked like the Pinkett ofold over the 
last three games, and that has made a difference." 
Quarterback Steve Beuerlein has completed 60 percent ( 113 of 
178) ofhis passes this season, for I,53 1 yards and six touchdowns, a pace that would set a school record for completion percentage. But the sophomore has has thrown 16 interceptions in eight games. 
Notre Dame's top two receivers will be hampered by injuries 
Saturday. Junior tight end Mark Bavaro ( 27 catches for 313 yards 
and one touchdown) is questionable for the game, having suffered 
knee ligament damage against Navy. Junior flanker Milt jackson ( 22 
receptions for 275 yards) should be ready Saturday, coming off an 
bruised collarbone suffered against LSU. 
Penn State's defense is allowing 3 3 5 yards per game, 130 of them 
on the ground. That represents a big improvement over last year, 
when the Nittany Lions gave up 432 yards per contest. 
The pass rush has produced 16 sacks for Penn State so far, with junior defensive end Bob White the leader with six sacks. Top tacklers for the Nittany lions are safety Ray Isom ( 61 stops), outside linebacker Shane Conlan (58), halfback Lance Hamilton (56), and inside linebacker Rogers Alexander (52). 
The kicking games: 
Both teams have placekickers who have proven that they can come through when the game is on the line. Navy's Nick Gancitano, a senior, has made 9 of 13 field goal attempts this season, and is 3 7 -of-48 for his career. For the Irish, sophomoreJohn Carney has been consistently accurate, hitting on 12 of 14 field goal tries, including the 44-yarder that won the Navy game. 
The Irish have a slight edge in the punting department, as senior Mike Viracola has posted an impressive 41-yard average this season, as compared to Penn State'sJohn Bruno, who has a 36-yard average. 
The key to the game: 
Consistency has been Notre Dame's goal all season long, and lately the defense has come closer to achieving that goal than has the offense. The Irish offense pulled out a victory over Navy by turning it on for the last four minutes, after stalling for most of the second and third quarters. The offense can ill afford a similar performance against Penn State -it will have to put together several scoring drives in the early going in order to establish some momentum.

consecutive 1 00-yard games starting with the South Carolina game. 
Although the '84 season has not lived up to Williams' expectations in the win-loss cloumn and in the amount of playing time, he hasn't found the season a total disappoint­ment. "In the aspect of wins and losses, this season has been a disappointment, bm I'm really enjoying myself though," reflects Williams. "Our team is great and I feel great everytime 1go over there (the ACC). In the aspect ofwins and losses I'm bummed out, but ten years down the road, it is not going to make any difference what out record was." 
Williams is entering possibly the final two weeks of his career at Notre Dame, and it has become an emotional time for the 6-6 guard. 
"It's really a weird feeling (getting to play your last home game). All the seniors before you talk about it, but you never really feel it or experience it until its your turn," says

Williams. "It's really a depressing feeling knowing that your home for the last four years will be history. I don't know if I'm ready for it to be history." 
The final game of the season against Southern Cal may be Williams' last game for the Irish, and it is something he isn't really looking forward to. "Playing USC will be a real emotional game for me just like Penn State is going to be," says Williams. "It's my last chance to put on a Notre Dame uniform. It's really a depressing thing to think abom right now. I don't know ifI'm ready for it." 
Although Williams hasn't had the ideal senior year full of victories and a national championship, the senior captain will always find his career at Notre Dame a fond memory. ''I'll look back on my football career in 1 0 or 1 5 years and be very happy with it," says Williams. "I'm disappointed with our win-loss record, but I still feel I made the right choice when I decided to come to Notre Dame. I've gotten to play three full years and I've had a great time doing it."

Records are compiled as to how each person does against the spread. In other words, it isn't enough to pick the winner of a given game. The person must pick the winner and give the underdog points.

A ttention "progressive music" 1'\Jovers and pop fans alike! The Fixx are here and available for your audio/visual pleasure. Yes, the creators ofthe popular songs "One Thing Leads to An­other," "Stand or Fall," "Saved by Zero," "Deeper and Deeper" and "Are We Ourselves?" are making a stop in South Bend for one concert, tonight at the Notre Dame Athletic and Convocation Center. Showtime is 8 PM. Tickets are $1 0 and S l 1, available at either the SAB Record Store or at the ACC Box Office, and at the door. 
Increasingly popular on the 

"new music" circuit, the Fixx 
have succeeded on the basis of 
their fine musicianship and 
carefully-crafted lyrics. Their 
style is a fusion ofsynth-rock 
intertwined with funk roots, and 
the result is a sound that, even 
today, is unique. 
American radio has been 

graced with several of the Fixx's 
songs, most notably their top 
five smashes, "One Thing Leads 
to Another," "Saved by Zero," 
and their recent top 20 single, 
"Are We Ourselves?" Their al­
bums have fared well, too. Shuttered Room, their 1982 
debut LP, lasted nearly a year on 
the charts. It led the way to their 
platinum follow-up, Reach the Beach. 
Reach the Beach exposed the band to mass popularity. They were chosen to open for the Police on their 1983 Synchronici~y tour, and Mn' kept their videos in heavy rota­tion. 
This year, with the release of their third albumPhantoms, the Fixx have become headliners. Phantoms, according to lead singer Cy Cumin, is "about per­sonal visions I've had about iso­lation and society's rules, about the superficial public selfand the deeper emotional self. The new position we've found our­selves in because of the band's success gives us more confi­dence to delve into the emo­tions of the more private self." 
Cumin also explains one of the Fixx's aims regarding its audience: "We can show people that you don't have to cage your­selfaway -that you can show your deep-down feelings rather than expressing only what people want you to say. Ifyou could adopt that position on a semi-permanent basis, you'd be isolating others less." Whew! 
Along with Cumin, the Fixx consists ofguitaristjamie West­Oram, drummer Adam Woods, and Rupert Greenan on keyboards. Though not a full member yet, Danny K. Brown is playing bass for the tour. Their songs deal with such topics as nuclear war ("Red Skies"), the dangers ofconformity, and, in "Less Cities, More Moving People,·· the destruction of Beirut. 'The members ofFixx want to elevate their music to a higher intellectual plateau with­out losing its sense ofacces­sibility. So ifyou like the Fixx or would simply like to see a think­ing band with good intentions, get yourselffixxed up and head on over to the ACC. 
'Amadaeus' one ofthe screen's best-ever portrayals of genius 
Don Seymour 
features staff writer 
Movies 
The autumn has provided a 
.l welcome relieffrom the child­ish movies ofsummertime.The three months between summer and Christmas seem to be the only time when the film industry releases any serious films. We've already seen "Places in the Heart," "A Soldier's Story" and now "Amadeus," Milos Forman's screen adaptation ofPeter Schaeffer's stage play. Sporting a script by Schaeffer, the film success­fully captures the spirit ofthe play, although inevitable changes have been made. The film is one ofthe year's best. 
"Amadeus" is the story of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, told by Antonio Salieri, his chiefrival and court composer for the emperor. The story begins at night in Vienna where a very old Salieri, by his memories of Mozart, tries to com­mit suicide by slitting his throat. He is promptly locked in a sanitorium. 
Upon a visit by a priest, he tells us his story. flashback technique seems staler than the play, where Salieri talked to the audience while scenes changed behind him. The movie flows a bit slower, but the story is no less riveting. 
Salieri is in love with music. Pledging his industry and chastity, he makes a personal bargain with God that he will become a great musician. Through diligent work and moderate talent, he works his way to the post ofcourt composer for the Austrian emperor. His world is shaken when a young prodigy 

named Mozart comes to Vienna. This young man obviously pos­sesses gifts far beyond his own. 
In trying to outdo this upstart, Salieri recognizes his own mediocrity in the face of true genius. He feels betrayed by God for giving the talent he so wanted for himself to a repulsive ingrate. He burns to celebrate God's glory with music, but his pleading has done nothing. Only one thing fills his mind-revenge. Revenge on God for betraying him and revenge on Mozart for being so talented. Salieri takes up a war against God, and his objective is to destroy God's abom­inable creature, Mozart. 
Salieri finds every way he can to make life miserable for Mozart. Yet, he remains fascinated and stunned by the music ofthis man. When Mozart is forced by lack of tnoney to produce burlesque operas for commoners, Salieri is the only member ofthe emperor's circle to attend. ·when the court composer uses his influence to have Mozart's operas closed, he still attends every performance. Ironically, Mozart believes Salieri one ofhis best friends. 
Salieri finally kills Mozart, by working on the guilt associated with Mozart's dead father. He dis­guises himmselfin black and cum­missions a death Mass from Mozart. After Mozart collapses, Salieri takes dictation from the bed-ridden Mozart in order to complete the Mass on time. Mozart is tremen­dously grateful, but Salicri is merely helping to drive the object ofhis hatred to death. 
This scene is one of the screen's most successful portrayals ofgenius ever: Mozart, with no instrument, simply dictates and hums music for voices and an entire orchestra to a flustered Salieri. 
The performances here are com­mendable. Thomas Hulce, who, if my eyes do not deceive me, played Larry Kroger in "Animal House," plays Mozart brilliantly. His cease­less energy captivates the audience and his abrasive, braying laugh captures the qualities Salieri finds so repulsive in Mozart. L Murray Abraham does a competent job as Salieri. He has less to do than the character did on stage and he plays it low key -perhaps a little too low key -but it is by no means a bad performance. 
Other outstanding performances include the emperor, whose dry, understated delivery punctuates the film with laughs, and Mozart's wife. 
"Amadeus" is a movie about envy and mediocrity and genius and dissatisfaction amd self-hate. It also speculates about talent, about how those who want it most don't al­ways possess it. More themes than can be mentioned weave their way through this complex film. Chances are you'll come out ofthe theater affected in some way. 

Landesburg amuses O'Laughlin with dialects and success secrets 
by Margaret McCabe 
assistant features editor 
"Ah,Saint Mary's ... I haven't 
been here in a few weeks," 
was comedian Steve Landesburg's 
opening line ofhis performance at 
Saint Mary's O'Laughlin Auditorium 
last night. 

Landesburg, better known as Sargent Arthur Dietrich ofthe long running TV sitcom "Barney Miller," appeared before a nearly full house, comprised ofa surprisingly older crowd with only a few students in attendance. But the ages or inter­ests ofthe audience didn't matter to last night's act. 
Landesburg gave a humorous perspective on a wide variety of topics ranging from politics and sports to ethnic jokes and the lyrics ofsongs. "Country and western lyrics kill me," he comments. "all you need is something like, 'my woman left me and beat up my pig' or 'my girl's gone and my dog got hit by a diesel,' and you've sold two million records. 
"It seems they're (country sing­ers) always giving themselves awards,'' says Landesburg and con­tinues in a perfect Nashville accent, " '...and now for the best country and western song written on a Thursday.. .' " 
Landesburg's mastery ofa num­ber ofdialects contributed some of the more humorous moments to the act. Throughout the act, the comedian slipped easily into a Texan, Chinese, French, and even Russian accent.;..~'l missed the Rus­sians during the Olympics," Landes­burg adds, "especially the women ­
love 800 pound women." 
Afew celebrity impressions 
proved to be crowd pleasers. A 
special request was made by a 
member of the audience for Landes­
burg's specialty, Gregory Peck, an 
impression he did on one ofhis 
early episodes of"Barney Miller." 
Landesburg proved to be a well­seasoned performer when it comes to live audiences. He maintained a very casual and comfortable rap­port with the crowd as he sipped ice water and, towards the end of the act, asked the audience ifthey had questions or requests. As the crowd responded with laughter and applause, the comedian nodded and audibly mumbled, "good crowd, this is a great crowd." 
Landesburg spoke freely about his personal life. "I was a shy, quiet kid so my father thought I was nuts when I told him I wanted to go into show business. He was probably right." 
Landesburg spoke ofhis first appearances on "The Tonight Show," "The Mike Douglas Show,'' and an interview with Robert Frost. "I wore the same suit and used the same material for all of them,'' he chuckled. 
The star was even willing to talk about his love life, or at least his ex-love life, "I broke up with my girlfriend awhile ago," he reflects. "Whenever you break up with someone, you suddenly think every song on the radio is about you and your ex. 
"All the maybes and what-ifs start running through your head like 'maybe I shouldn't have thrown her down the stairs.' " Landesburg admitted to the audience that he missed "Barney Miller," "I espe­

I cially miss the money!" He's been traveling to colleges around the country doing the act but when people ask him what he does for a living he responds, "I pack and I fly. Seriously," he continues, "the shows are the fun part." Offstage, the comedian reveals even more. about what's behind the laughter. When asked if he thought he was much like his former charac­ter Dietrich, Landesburg responded, "I'm much smarter than he was, but you always try to make the character as much you as possi­ble." What does a celebrity like Steve Landesburg do in what little spare time he has? "I find enjoy­ment in taking off my clothes in strange places," he jokes, "Actually I really love sports, especially baseball." Do comedians have favorite comedians? Ofcourse, and Landesburg's isJohn Winters, "I'd like him to be in a movie that I'll be working on this spring." Landesburg has a few words of wisdom for students who want to break into show business, "You've got to keep acting. Do what ever you can to make yourselfgreat before you take that step into Holly­wood or New York. Don't think about money because there won't be any unless you make it big." What's ahead for Landesburg? In his immediate future there is a show in Grand Rapids tomorrow followed by a show in Chicago "Then I'll head for home and take a couple ofweeks off before I start planning for the movie."

Doerger emerges from 'utility man' role on offensive line 
By THERON ROBERTS 
Sports Writer 
Many people talk about the adjust­ment that students have to deal with when they make the transition from high school to college. For athletes, adjustments also must also be made in their sport. 
Tom Doerger, the 6-5, 272-pound starting quick tackle for the Fighting Irish did not have as much of a prob­lem as many football players do, be­cause he joined two of his teammates from LaSalle High School in Cincinnati, Oh., for his freshman year in 1 981. 
But the initial year at Notre Dame was not a good one for Doerger, who sat out the entire 1981 season. Even though he had a slow start because of the injury, after Doerger had knee surgery to repair some torn liga­ments, he has progressed slowly toward gaining the starting position he currently holds. 
After starting his career under the Golden Dome at the tackle position, Doerger was moved to center and saw limited reserve duty behind Mark Fischer in 1982. Doerger's task became more difficult in the 1983 season, when he came to be known as the "utility man." 
The Cincinnati, Oh., native was considered to be available for no fewer than three positions on the of­fensive line last year, gaining his ex­perience quickly. He filled in at quick guard for Tim Scannell, who was sidelined with a knee injury for three games, and took over for Mike Perrino, who had injured a shoulder, at strong tackle against Penn Stat~. Doerger also was capable to replace Mike Kelley at center ifany injuries prevented the starter from playing. 
"Switching positions last season was good for me," Doerger states. "I got a chance to do different types of running and passing blocks, and I 
think my technique is better be­
cause ofthat." 

With the graduation of Neil 
Maune, however, the shuttling be­
tween different positions was over. 
Doerger joined the other four re­
turning starters -Kelley, Perrino, 
Scannell, and Larry Williams -to 
form what most people considered 
to be a very experienced group 
which had the size and talent to 
overwhelm many opposing defen­
sive units. 

But not having that lineup all 
healthy at one time until recently 
has prevented Notre Dame from 
having its measure ofsuccess. 
"Defenses knew what to do' against us," Doerger says. "They stunted to the strong side ofour line, and with all in the injuries, they could stop us from establishing the running game. But I think that using two tight ends at once has made it difficult for other teams to know what side of the ball they want to stunt. 
"I think that we did solve the problem of not doing as well as we could have on the offensive line when we got healthy." 
As far as injuries go, Doerger has personally experienced that feeling, although he has managed to escape injury so far this season. 
"It seems as ifI always get injured before, or after the season, but during the season, I stay pretty healthy," continues Doerger, refer­ing to his pre-season knee injury as a freshman and hamstring problem before the Liberty Bowl last year. "The injuries are part of the game. We aren't practicing as hard this year, so that has cut down on the in­juries a little, but they still happen in games." 
Because he has had a taste of playing the different positions on the offensive line, Doerger knows 
what is needed to pertorm well at team that had run all over other of­"Jerry and Smitty had exactly the each spot. fensive lines and sacked quarter­same personality then as now," says "It takes different skills to play at backs a number of times. But we Doerger. "I lifted weights with Jerry

Lefty has homecoming 
Hockey team travels to St. Thomas 
By ED DOMANSKY 
Sports Wrlter 
ST. PAUL, Minn.-The Notre Dame hockey team is on the road once again this weekend. The Irish are here in St. Paul to take on the Tommies from the College of St. Thomas in games tonight and tomor­row. 
After dropping two games last weekend at the University of Michigan-Dearborn, Notre Dame hopes it has ironed out the problems that led to its undoing a week ago. The Irish surrendered four goals in Friday's third period and yielded three first-period goals on Saturday to greatly hamper the Notre Dame attack. 
"Last weekend we seemed to be somewhat intimidated by their ag· gressive style and that concerns me," said head coach Lefty Smith. "In a close· checking game, we must


\'

Last season when the two teams met at Notre Dame, the Irish swept the Tommies by 3·2 and 7-5 scores. 
Notre Dame arrives here with a 2· 2 record, while St. Thomas has yet to see action in '84-'85. The Tommies finished last season with a respec· table 20-10-1 overall record, with a 13·3 mark in the Minnesota Intercol·

St. Thomas advanced to the quar­terfinals ofthe NCAA Division III Na­tionals and closed out the season ranked fifth nationally in the NCAA Division III hockey poll. 
When the two teams square off tonight and tomorrow, it will mark the second reunion in as many years between former coach and player. Smith returns to his hometown to take on his alma mater, and at the same ume coach against a former player, Terry Abram. In his two seasons behind the St. Thomas bench, Abram has compiled a 39·19· 
I record. 
Notre Dame freshman Pat Foley will also be returning home this weekend and he is hoping that he and the team will play well. 
"It will probably be the only time 
my parents will get to see me play, so 
I hope things go well," said Foley. 
"I've also played against a lot of guys 
on their team before. It would be 
nice to come away with a sweep." 
After last weekend, the Irish had 
to make some adjustments to 
prepare for the Tommies. 
"We went back to emphasizing some of the fundamentals this week in practice," said Smith. "We worked more on our puck control and playing the body. Basically, we hope to solidify ourselves as far as sticking with a system both offensively and defensively."

The Ramblers, in turn, had their as yet unblemished conference record dirtied with a loss to the Musketeers of Xavier as the conference season ended. To complicate m<~tters, the Irish whipped Xavier in four games in their last home game three weeks ago. 
"We have to play error-free vol­leyball this weekend to win," says Head Coach Art Lambert. "It's a tough assignment. but we can do it if

Freshman center Mike McNeill has moved back to defense along with Foley. Junior Jeff Badalich has been switched from right wing on the third line to center in McNeill's place. Sophomore Rich Kennedy is on the right wing. Tom Parent will miss his second weekend of action with a separated shoulder. Freshman Mark Anquillare will once again cen­ter the second line with Steve Whitmore and Dave Waldbillig. 
"Lefty has done a lot for us and he's returning home so we hope we can bounce back and win two for him," said Whitmore. "In any case this is an important series for us. They will be a tough team and we must get things going again." 
After four games, senior co­captain Brent Chapman is on top of the Irish scoring chart. He has ten points on four goals and six assists. Unemate Tim Reilly is second with two goals and seven assists. Thebeau is the third highest with four goals and three assists. 
Smith has yet to decide which of his goalies will see action tonight and tomorrow. Tim Lukenda has played in three of the four games thus far and is expected to see action at least once. AI Haverkamp, who has played once, and Marc Guay are the other two possible starters.

"We've had two weeks off, and that has given our people some time to heal," says Lambert. " Mary Jo Hensler had a sprained ankle, but she should be ready by Friday." 
Even with a strong and healthy squad, the Irish will have to play solid and consistent volleyball to be victorious. Setters Mary Mclaughlin and Jill Suglich will have a large say in this matter.

NCAA tourney finals ahead for Notre Dame cross-country team 
-
By NICK SCHRANTZ 
Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame cross country team, which is currently ranked 13th in the latest national coaches' poll, culminates one of its best seasons ever with the NCAA Cross Country Championships at Penn State on Monday, November 19 at 11 a.m. 
The Irish will compete against 21 other teams for the national champi­onship. Irish head coach Joe Piane feels all the teams in the field are strong, but reveals that several teams stand out above the rest. 
"Wisconsin is the number one team in the country now, and Iowa State has been up there all year," 
Piane  explains.  "Arizona  and  
Arkansas  will  be  excellent,  while  
Clemson also will be strong."  

Going into the race, Piane and the team have hopes of further improv­ing its ranking in the polls and attain-

Kempton, Barlow score 20 
Offense spurs Irish rout of Zadar 
ByPHILWOLF 
Assistant Sports Editor 
The Notre Dame men's basketball team, making its first official appear· ance in uniform, defeated the Zadar Club of Yugoslavia in an exhibition game last night in the ACC. 
The Irish were able to generate enough offense to run up 103 points in the contest, but the Notre Dame defense gave up 86 points to the visiting Yugoslavians. 
The score was close for the first five minutes of play, but the Irish opened up at that point and began to run away with the game. At halftime, they owned a 23-point adavantage at 58-35. 
In the second half, however, Notre Dame failed to execute its of­fense effectively while also provid­ing the Yugoslavians with several opportunities to get back in the game. 
"In the first half I thought we played with a lot of intensity," Notre Dame coach Digger Phelps said. "I thought we ran well. In the second half I give them (the Irish) an 'F' on ing more well deserved national recognition. 

"There are 28'; Division I schools in the country, and right now we have one of the top 22 teams," Piane said. "Things are going well for us now, and so I feel a top ten finish is a realistic objective." 
The Irish reached the NCAA 
championships by capturing the· 
fourth and final qualifying spot at the 
NCAA District IV Qualifying Meet 
last Saturday at Illinois. The team 
scored 13 1 points and finished be­
hind Wisconsin, Illinois, and Mic­
higan. 
Freshman Dan Garrett led the 
Irish with a 15th-place finish. Sopho­
more Mike Collins and senior Tim 
Cannon placed 21st and 23rd 
respectively. Senior co-captain Bill 
Courtney finished 38th, while 
senior Ed Willenbrink rounded out 
the Irish scoring with a 44th-place 
finish. 
defense; I give them an 'F' on inten­sity; I give them an 'F' on offensive execution." 
The Irish scored first in the con­test when Ken Barlow won the opening tip, which was recovered by Jim Dolan. Dolan passed off to David Rivers, who was open under the Notre Dame basket for an easy layup. 
Rivers' basket, his first in a Notre Dame uniform. sent the crowd of 10,532 into a frenzy. Rivers, the highly touted freshman point guard for the Irish, entertained the crowd for most of the evening with his ex­cellent ballhandling skills. 
The six-footer from jersey City, N.J., finished the game with 19 points and three assists. His shooting percentage was not as good as Phelps would have liked, however, as he hit only seven of his 21 field­goal attempts. 
"For his first game, I'm not too worried about that (shooting pecentage )," Phelps said. "I think he learned some things tonight." 
Among those things that Rivers learned, Phelps said, was that he 
Senior co-captain Jim Tyler and juniorJohn Magill, while not scoring for Notre Dame, placed 56th and I 12th respectively. 
The Irish arranged a different strategy for this meet. 
"Last week at the District IV's we went out hard because we wanted everybody to be in the top 30," Piane indicated. "However, the NCAA's will be different so we only want everyone to be in the top one­third." 
"To do well and finish in the top ten we have to run an intelligent race," Piane said. "We want to run conservatively in the beginning so we can keep a high level of intensity for all 10,000 meters." 
The Irish have run consistently and as a team all year. 'These qualities contributed to their undefeated record and incredible success. Ifthe runners continues to run as they've done all year, then their goal ofa top ten finish is very likely. 
must adjust his shot against bigger players. The Yugoslavians, whose average height is 6-6, gave Rivers a lot of trouble when he tried to pene­trate the middle for shots. 
Also impressive for the Irish last night were Ken Barlow and Tim Kempton, who each had 20 points to lead all scorers. Kempton pulled down 13 rebounds to go with his

"After we scored the first goal, we really weren't looking for more," said Flanner captain Mike Etling. "We've got a pretty good defense, so we thought we could make that first goal stand up. We just concentrated on clearing the ball out of our end. We figured we could sit on the lead, but, as things worked out, we didn't." 
Flanner, in fact, increased the lead with about three minutes left in the half. The 0-C goalie blocked an indirect kick by Greg Wright of Flanner, but Wright got the, rebound and scored to increase the lead to 2-0.

The end of a tough four seasons 
Three years and 20 home games ago, the Class of 1985 filed into Notre Dame Stadium for its first home game a~ part of the Notre Dame student section. For seniors like myself, it was a moment that will never be forgotten. 
The weather was beautiful as the Irish ran out 'onto the field for the first time ever behind Gerry Faust. L.S.U. ("L.S.Who?" according to T-shirts that were popular that week) was the first opponent. The Tigers brought a huge inflatable mascot with them, but the Irish promptly deflated the visitors. L.S.U. fumbled on its first possession and the Notre Dame offense took over. Numerous players went in motion on the first play and the student body went crazy. Notre Dame won easily, 27-9, and moved to No.1 in the nation in the polls which came out a few days later. 
Imagine the thrill for a group offreshmen who, within a few weeks of entering college, found themselves at the school with the best football team in the land. It was time to start planning for New Orleans and the Sugar Bowl. 
Recently, this memory almost seems like a dream. 
It is hard to imagine after four disappointing seasons that NO was once the No. 1 team in the country. Now it's cause for celebration to even be in the Top 20 at all. 
It is hard to imagine that Gerry Faust was once the most popular man on campus. Students used to tell how Faust would come share a pizza with them in their rooms. Now some hang him in effigy. 
It is hard to imagine that Notre Dame fans not only ex­pected the Irish to win, but to destroy the opponent. Now we're happy to beat Navy by a point. 
It is hard to imagine that the students once felt that they 
Mike Sullivan 
Sport> l rl!-tor 

could play a large part in an Irish victory. Now the team plays better on the road than at home. 
But, most of all, it is hard to imagine that tomorrow's game will be our last as students in Notre Dame Stadium. Despite the disappointments of the past four years, there will be some tears and sentimentality in Sections 28 and 29 tomorrow. Football has always been a big part of a Notre Dame student's life and will always remain so. 
Undoubtedly, however, there will be some other emo­tions among the seniors tomorrow. There will be some relief that four seasons of unfulfilled hopes and expecta­tions finally will be over. And, for a minority, there will be anger caused by the team's and the coaches' failures on the field. 
The last four years have, indeed, been tough on just about everybody -students, players, and administration ­but they may be the most valuable years ever for Notre Dame, its students, alumni, and extended family. 
The last four years have taught Notre Dame people an invaluable lesson: Never take wtnningforgranted. There is no arguing that the seniors' four-year span has 
been a humbling experience for all who call themselves Notre Dame fans. The attitude of invincibility that seemed to be such a large part of Notre Dame football earned ND many enemies. Now these people are making the Notre Dame supporters eat their words -and rightly so. 
There was a time when teams like Navy and Air Force were shown no respect by Irish fans who felt that there was no way they should be able to stay close. The question was not, "Will Notre Dame win?" but rather "How much will Notre Dame win by?" It wasn't good enough to beat Navy. The Irish had to beat them convincingly. It was as if the opponents had nothing to do with the game. IfNotre Dame played well, it would romp over all but the toughest teams. Ifnot, the Irish would win by very little. 
Recent experience has told us not to take anybody lightly. When you don't win every game, you learn to ap­preciate every win. 
No, God did not make Notre Dame No. 1 on the football field like some people used to believe. But, then, maybe the past four years have been a message that people at Notre Dame were taking the game a bit too seriously? It is wrong when a loss in a football game sends a campus into mourn­ing. Fortunately, people are starting to put everything into perspective and to realize that it is just a football game, not a personal indictment of them, 
No, neither Gerry Faust nor the football team has spoiled the fun of the past four years. In fact, they may have helped teach us and other true Notre Dame fans an important les­sen. You don't win all the time, or maybe even most ofthe time, so cherish those times when you do.
