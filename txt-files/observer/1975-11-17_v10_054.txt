Marijuana crop offers harvesters free high 
by Maureen O'Brien Starr Reporter 
It's  harvest  time  again  for  
Hoosier marijuana.  
And  Indiana  legal  authorities  

and individual entrepreneurs are now racing to reap the illicit weed. 
Marijuana grown in the South Bend area is not very potent, some sources say. But marijuana grows wild and free in many rural areas in the county, offering the temp­tation of a free high. 
Indiana state law does not favor the private pot picker. Possession or sale of up to 25 grams of marijuana or 5 grams of hashish usually merits a court fine or a suspended sentence. Any amount above 25 grams of marijuana or 5 grams of hashish may result in a felony conviction and a prison sentence. 
An Indiana State Police officer claimed that total arrests for marijuana possession are up 100 per cent. The harvest by police

The high price of marijuana on campus is one reason given for harvesting local patches of pot. "Marijuana prices range from ten to twenty dollars an ounce," the source complained. "Good Colombian pot can cost thirty dollars an ounce." 
"I would say at least half of the students here who smoke try to grow their own," she continued. "But most of the real good stuff comes from Ann Arbor. Mich." 
The South Bend police depart­ment has improved their methods of catching pot smokers and pot harvesters in the act. "The

The coalition will launch the drive at a meeting tonight at 7 in the LaFortune Ballroom. The campaign will culminate on M­onday, Nov. 24, with a day-long fast followed by a Thanksgiving Mass celebrated by Fr. Theodore llesburgh at 10 p.m. in Sacred Jleart Church. 
"All letters collected by Monday from the Notre Dame community will be offered at the Offertory in recognition of the wealth that God has bestowed on us and our challenge to share what we have so that others may live," Greg (;rarnelspacher, Coalition research committee chairman, st­ated. 
"The Coalition has also sent 1200 letters to parishes in South Bend and St. Joseph County urging pastors to support the resolution and participate in the "Offering of Letters" on a parish basis," he added. 
The World Hunger Coalition was created in November of last year under the instigation of Fr. Theodore Hesburgh. Allen estimated there are now 50 members. In addition, ap­proximately 500 people are par­ticipating this semester in the Wednesday Night Fast Program in which the dining hall pays 75 cents per participant per night. 
According to Allen, the program will bring in approximately $4,000 in contrast to last year's $1,100. The money will be sent to overseas relief organizations and the poor of South Bend. 
Seven coalition members will attend the National University Conference on Hunger in Austin on Hunger in Austin, Texas, November 21-23. The trip is being financed by donations from Hesburgh and others.

Notre Dame hosts tournament 
by Phil Cackley Staff Reporter 
Atwo-man team team 'from Butler 
University won the final round of the 24th Annual National In­vitational Debate Tournament by a 1 four-to-one decision over a Un­
.versity of Iowa team. 
The topic for the tournament 
which was hosted by Notre Dame, 
was "Resolved: that the Federal 
government should institute a 
comprehensive program of land­
use control in the United States." 
A total of 46 teams from 29>sch­
ools in nine states participated in 
the tournament. Notre Dame's 
debate club entered one novice 
learn, but none of the more ex­
perienced club members debated. 
The club does not ailow its own 
teams to participate in the final 
rounds of a tournament held at 
Notre Dame. The novice team, 
which was debating primarily for 
the experience, did not make it out 
of the preliminary rounds. 
The final round was held Sunday evening at 7p.m. in the Law School auditorium. Approximately 20 spectators and judges watched as the two teams sparred verbally for an hour-and-a-half. 
The Butler team of Jack Guest 
and Randy loser maintained in 
support of the resolution that the 
federal government should ban 
nuclear fission paints and con­1concentrate km developing nuclear fusion as a source of power. 
The members of the Negative 
team (opposing the resolution) 
from Iowa were Mark Deathera~e and Kevin Finkel. They claimed that fusion is not feasible because it will take too long to develop that fission is not dangerous and that if fission plants are banned on the continent, power companies will build floating power plants of the oceans just outside the territorial waters of the U.S. 

Finkel said this would bring the serious possibility of a chain reaction with the hydrogen and deuterium present in sea-water, if there was any kind of accident. 
This, he said, would bring "the end of the world." Loser, from Butler, brushed aside this argument while 
steadfastly asserting the danger of nuclear fixsion and the inability of the Atomic Energy Commission to control fission plants and prevent disastrous accidents. "The AEC is a turkey," he said numerous time. 
Guest emphasized that fusion has none of the dangers of fission and the government should make the development of fusion a national priority as improtant as the Apollo space program was in the 1960's. 
The Butler team was awarded the tournament trophy in a short ceremony afterward., The last time Butler won the tournament was in 1967.

But the South Bend police are not concerned with the use of the drug on the Notre 'Dame campus. "The Notre Dame campus is not under our jurisdiction," Wawrzyniak said. "We are only concerned if the student brings his business into South Bend.

Another exited Kennedy's chest and still another passed thru the right shoulder pad of his jacket. There were three bullet holes in the ceiling panels, and an AP wirephoto showed two policemen pointing to what was described as a bullet hole in a door­frame. When confronted with this the police explained it thru ricochets and by denying there was a bullet hole in the AP wirephoto. 
For two years, former N. Y. Congressman Allard K. Lowenstein, a friend of the late Senator's and leader of the fight to reopen the murder case, asked the police to release these pieces of evidence so it could be determined whether or not 8 bullets did all of this damage. They refused. But suddenly this August they announced this evidence had been routinely destroyed, the ceiling panels in June, 1969. Yet on October 11, 1971, a Police Dept. Board of Inquiry report on a "reevaluation of the evidence" described "an in­
spection ofthe cediling panels". How could ceiling panels destroyed in 1969 be reevaluated and inspected in 1971? 
It can easily be seen, regardless of what the press says or what the police do, that the case against Sirhan Sirhan as the actual assassin of Robert Kennedy is rapidly falling apart. Although most Americans who did not watch the October 7th NBC Today Show or CBS Eveining News believe the case is closed, Lowenstein et al, will go back to court in Los Angeles on November 18 to deal with the questions raised by the ballistics tests. No one is too certain of what an open investigation will bring, whether there are horrors lurking beneath an official cover-up, as many fear, or just simple explanat­ions. But with presidential contenders shot during the last three presidential campaigns there really isn't any choice. And that's why Lowenstein will go on no matter what the odds.

World leaders set trade policies 
RAMBOUILLET, France ( AP) -President Ford and other leaders at the six-nation economic summit conference reached tentative agreement Sunday on new guidelines for world trade and currency ex­change rates. The United States· described the talks as "extraor­dinarily fruitful." 
However, strong opposition developed to a proposal by Sec­retary of State Henry A. Kissin­ger to transform the summit into a high-level group that will meet regularly to consider world economic problems. 
A spokesman for the West German delegation said Chan-cellar Helmut Schmidt spoke against the Kissinger plan, al­though he did agree to occa­sional meetings as problems arise. 
Notwithstanding this setback, however, the American delega­tion said "good progress was being made" and it appeared that President Ford and the leaders of Germany, Britain, Japan, France and Italy would cover the entire agenda Sunday with still a third meeting day remaining Monday. 
Secretary of the Treasury William E. Simon and finance ministers of the five other na­tions met separately Sunday morning and agreed to issue a joint statement at the end of the meeting to be known as the "Rambouillet Manifesto." 
That represented progress in itself, since U.S. spokesmen had said Saturday they weren't sure anything could be accom­plished that would justify is­suing a joint statement. 
The French-initiated summit was called to discuss monetary problems, inflation and the worldwide economic downturn, but the most that was expected to come out of it was a series of policy guidelines that indi­vidual nations could follow. 
A German spokesman said the finance ministers, following up talks by the heads of gov­ernment, tentatively agreed that their nations should smooth over sharp-up-and-down fluctuations in the value of their currencies. 

He said they also agreed that the six nations should pledge themselves not to resort to pro­tectionist measures, such as setting quotas, to restrain trade. "Some sort of statement against protectionism" would be contained in the joint state­ment, he said. 
President Ford had come to the 14th century chateau here expecting he. would encounter pressures from the other na­tions to do more to stimulate the U.S. economy, which woulrl in turn help the world economy. He anticipated these pressures in his first remarks, saying the United States couldn't do more than it was doing already. 
Spokesmen for both the Ger­man and Japanese delegations appeared to accept Ford's view, as neither of them called for greater activity by the United States, although the Germans were said to feel Ford could be more confident about the future because the United States depends far less than other nations on foreign frade.

But face it, Notre Dame is one of the top teams on our schedule. They bring out the best in everyone and I may have gotten a little more psyched for them. Notre Dame is the name, when you're growing up you have a dream to go there. I had a dream to go there, but I just didn't go.

I was just happy. The coach, he didn't dig it too much. He told me to be careful, that if it was a second before the game was over it wouldn't be so bad. But in a game like this, he told me, anything could happen. On blocking and faking: It's all part of my job. I don't mind it. I know I can't carry the ball all the time. I have to give a lot of credit to my teammates, they did a great job. I loved it, they loved it, and this is all as much theirs as it is mine.

"I'm very fortunate this happened to me," he said. But that's a bad way to put it. It all didn't happen to him, he made it happen and before he's through he may have made it happen better than anyone else to ever run the ball. Saturday's sensational performance is one of those that a great player comes up with when there is hardly anything left for him to J. do. 
He already holds the all-time Pitt rushing record. He broke it in the third game of his sophomore year. He was an All-American as a fresh­man, amassing the most yards in one season (1,686) and in one game

"When I play, I like to think of it as performing," he says. 
Once Dorsett got around the end, he was virtually unstoppable. 
He sure puts on a heckuva show.
