Discovering 
Dante 

Vast exhibit, program make renowned works accessible 
By GWENDOLYN NORGLE A"o<iatc New.< Editor 
The exhibition illustrating the work of the Flonmtine p!wt Dante Alighinri and the estab­lishrnPnt of the Study Program at Notre Dame honoring him are mom than art. They are more than literature. And they are more than theology, philosophy or history. They arn all of these. 
J·:neornpassing numerous passions and fields of study, "Ways Into tlw City of Woes" is an exhi­bition of illustrations of Dante's "Inferno", which is eo-sponsored by the William and Kath!wine Devers Program in Dantn Studi(lS and the Department of Special Collections at the llesburgh Library where the exhibit is being shown. 
The Danw Studies Program was established in l'JIJ5 after a $1 million donation by William and Katlwrine Dnvers was offered to the University to promote a wide range of scholarly activities relating to the study of Dantn, according to one of tlw exhibition's displays in the library corri­dor. 
The nxhibition includes illustrated editions of Dante's "Divine Comedy", which was printed in Flownr.e in 1481 and illustrated by the artist Midwlangelo. It furthers the vision of the University's own Father John Zahm, who, as Proeurator General in Home and later as Provincial of the Congregation of Holy Cross, as­snmblml for Notre Dame one of the finest Dante eolleetions in North Ameriea before his death in 1921, aeeording to the display. At the time of its assembly, Zahm 's eolleetion was one of the three largest collections of Dante's works in the United Statlls. 
Challenging the prevalent be­lief that homosexua.lity and Catholicism are incompatible and citing Catholic doctrine as support, Father David Garrick, a professor in communieations and theater, claimed that it is the obligation of a Catholic uni­versity to recognize a homo­sexual student group. 
To facilitate this step, Garrick believes that a University wide dialogue must take place which concentrates on Catholic teach­ing and the moral status of gay and lesbian students. Saying that Notre Dame is the ideal set­ting to discuss these issues, Garrick stated that some fun­damental questions must be addressed. 
The Observer/David Murphy 
This illustration, part of Notre Dame's Dante exhibit "Ways Into the City of Woes," depicts a scene from Dante's "Divine Comedy" in which a fortune teller has been turned inside-out following his death. 
"The exhibit offers a complete overview of Dante," said Christian Dupont, graduate student in the department of theology who, with the assistanee of Simone Spanu, graduate student in the department of Romance languages and liter­ature, assembled the exhibit. 
There is a comphiteness present in the illustra­tions and in the collection of books, Dupont said, beeause they show the various traditions of the cantos, the segments into which Dante divided his work. Especially interesting, according to Dupont, is Canto I, in whieh Dante is confronted by the three beasts. 
"In offering both art-historical perspectives and print perspectives, the exhibit reveals the in­fluences that the printing press and other devel­opments in print technology had on inter­pretations of 'The Divine Comedy,"' Dupont said. 
"Illustrations were another kind of interpreta­tion," he explained. "They offered insights dif­ferent from those in written commentaries." 
Notre Dame Professor of English Edward Vasta, an expert in English literature who stud­ied Dante at the University of Florence in Italy, said that Dante is seen as the greatest philosoph­ical poet that ever lived. 
"Dante is highly regarded as a Christian mind," Vasta said. "lie is unmatehed and unparalleled in his work." 
The work of Dante, who lived in the late 13th and early 14th centuries, is studied as much today as it ever was, added Vasta, who, along

"Are homosexuals an op­pressed group?" Garrick asked. "And if they are, what are the practical ways to help this mi­nority?" 
Garrick noted that several tenets of The Catechism of the Catholic Chureh (1994) provide an answer. In a letter to The Observer on April 4, he said that certain points of The Cate­chism provide support for his claims. 
In the letter he said, "The Catechism offers teachings that should be construed as support for the recognition of groups of gay people, governed by gay people, for gay people -so long as these groups do not in any way encourage their members to break the institution's rule that prohibits sexual inter­course outside of marriage."

His letter came in response to Vice President of Student Affairs Patricia O'Hara's denial of offi­cial recognition for a homo­sexual student group whieh was made on the basis of Catholic teachings. lie explains in the letter, "In light of the Church teaching...! would like respect­fully to ask her to explain pub­licly what her authority or ra­tionale is for the prohibition." 
Garrick chose to step forward at this time because he believed that it was his duty, both as a priest and as a man of homo­sexual orientation, to question the stated belief that homosex­ual groups are inconsistent with Catholic doctrine. It was a diffi­cult step, said Garrick, who had not previously stated his sexual

An ignored minority 
Every now and then something sparks a bit of controversy throughout the otherwise peaceful Notre Dame and Saint Mary's campuses. Whether it's deciding to allow females into Notre Dame nearly 25 years ago, deliberating 

whether or not to light up  Joey Crawford  
the number one after the  Accent Editor  
girl's soccer team won the  

national championship, or handling the un• abashed outbursts of esteemed (uh-hum) cam­pus commentators as Fred Kelly or Cristiane Likely, the campuses have handled it in stride. 
Recently though, the pace has been dis­rupted with Student Affairs' commentary (through the four page advertisement by Patti O'Hara in the Observer on March 6) on the sta­tus of gays and lesbians at Notre Dame. 
In summary, Student Affairs is allowing gays and lesbians to have a club, but they are not giving the club the same rights and privileges other clubs and organizations on the two cam­puses possess. They are not allowed to have officers or guest speakers. In addition to this, before they can do anything whatsoever, it must be pre-approved by the administration. Now this hardly seems fair. 
Some have argued that a club would give the homosexual population an outlet for something like a "gay single's bar" within the boundaries of our campuses. Arguably though, a recog­nized club would give homosexuals a chance to meet people with some common traits in a purely on-perverse fashion. Emotional sup­port for students who may feel lost within the system could be one of the main advantages of establishing such a club. 
The students at Notre Dame and Saint Mary's pride themselves on being one of the most intelligent groups of students in the na­tion. Yet does anyone see the narrow-minded­ness that is really going on here? The universi­ty has been adapting to differences in race, culture, and gender since its conception in 1842. The schools, although at times bela­bored, have done their best to make Notre Dame and Saint Mary's more student friendly. For the most part they have taught that every­one is equal. So why should sexual preference be any different? And why won't the student body speak out against these atrocities? 
True, homosexuals differ from me and a predominant amount of the campus, but then again isn't everyone a unique individual? The world would be a pretty boring place if there was a uniform mold of all human beings. It must be realized that homosexuals did not choose to become who they are. It is a biolog­ical condition, not a choice. Not too many peo­ple would choose a life that is plagued with ridicule and unacceptance, unless they were thrust into it. Their lives are not easy, espe­cially at Catholic institutions. 
Gay and lesbian students at Notre Dame and Saint Mary's need their outlet, maybe more than anyone else on these campuses. A true club would give them a common place to meet and the opportunity to find others who happen to have the same feelings as they do. Notre Dame and Saint Mary's are not the most accepting places, a recognized club could pos­sibly help the students feel like they belong. It would offer them a chance to express who they truly are without inhibitions. 
Individuals differ from one another greatly. I am not attempting to decided if homosexuality is right or wrong but rather search for support for people who may really need help.

Dole blasts Clinton veto as extremist 
WASHINGTON 
Sen. Bob Dole's placement of President Clinton on the "extremist fringe" for his veto of an anti-abortion bill sharpens battle lines for the 1996 presidential election. But for all the strong rhetoric from both sides, polls show a majority of American voters don't want a ban on abortion. Dole's sharp comments, made after Clinton 
······ vetoed legislation Wednesday to ban partial-birth abor­tions, could make it harder for him to win support from the political center as he moves beyond the GOP pri­maries into the general-election campaign. Asked about Clinton's veto as he campaigned in Pennsylvania late Wednesday, Dole said: "Big mistake. He's out there on the extremist fringe." Dole renewed his contention dur­ing a campaign stop Thursday in Memphis, Tenn., saying, "He is out there on the extreme edge." Dole's point was that the bill, which would ban a seldom-used late-term procedure, had considerable bipartisan support in Congress -even if not enough to override a veto. Clinton contended the procedure was sometimes neces­sary to protect a woman's health or save her life. 
Rudeness a problem in the U.S. 
WASHINGTON 
A poll says Americans think their country is becoming a nasty place to live, where bad manners, uncouth dri­vers, unholy language, and unruly kids are crowding civility out of society. But when asked what has brought us to this. the respondents blame political campaigns, prime-time television, rock music and talk radio as the culprits. Eighty-eight percent of respondents to the Bozell Worldwide-U.S. News & World Report Quality Quotient poll to be published in the magazine's April 22 edition said lack of civility is a serious problem in our society. Ninety-one percent said that contributes to increased violence, and nearly 80 percent said the prob­lem has worsened over the past 10 years. Only a minori­ty said lawyers, journalists, police and other oft-maligned professionals were uncivil. Some of the behaviors people associate with declining civility are driving habits, speak­ing manners and children's behavior. Seventy-one per­cent said driving habits have become somewhat or much less civil over the past 10 years. Sixty-seven percent said people were somewhat or much less civil in speaking with others or using appropriate language. 

Ford comes to Mazda's rescue 
TOKYO 
Ford Motor Co. will assume virtual control of ailing Mazda Motor Corp., which has been battered by Japan's recession and the strong yen. Mazda and Ford put out a joint statement Friday confirming reports Ford would in­crease its share in Mazda to 33.4 percent of the compa­ny's shares, and that Mazda would voluntarily cede man­agement control. Trading in Mazda shares was sus­pended Friday morning in Tokyo following the news re­ports of the impending changes. The increased share alone does not give Ford control, but analysts said cou­pled with the top-level management changes, it would effectively put the U.S. company in the driver's seat. "Ford and Mazda believe that closer coordination of our cooperative strategies and plans, particularly in the areas uf product development, manufacturing and distribution of vehicles, will enable both companies to improve competitiveness and to achieve improved economies of scale and efficiencies," said Wayne Booker, executive vice president of Ford. Even before the formal announcement, the news was being welcomed. Japan's trade minister, Shunpei Tsukahara, said Ford's plan to raise its share in Mazda was "good for the world econo­my" in an era of economic liberalization. 
Actor beaten and robbed in home 
LOS ANGELES 
Two men pleaded no contest to robbing and pistol­whipping actor Harry Dean Stanton and making off with his loot-filled Lexus. Alberto Mauricio Guerrero, 20, and Jose Enrique Rivera, 18, will face up to nine years in prison rather than the maximum 20 years due to a plea bargain. Stanton, 69, played grizzled outsiders in the films "Repo Man" and "Alien," and has a lengthy list of credits including "How the West Was Won" to "Paris, Texas." The men allegedly forced their way into Stanton's house on Jan. 20, tied him up and hit him in the head. Police say they then fled in his 1995 luxury car filled with electronic goods and other items from the car, which contained a homing device. Police staked out the car and later arrested the men at Los Angeles Valley College. Authorities said the two men planned to destroy the Lexus with a homemade firebomb. Sentencing was set for April 24. Other charges of assault, false imprisonment and possession of flamma­ble material were dropped Wednesday in Van Nuys Municipal Court. Stanton declined to comment through his publicist.

Scenes of Spring
Mize honors Madeleva's goals 
ByBERNADETTEPAMPUCH 
News Writer 
Adventure, danger and romance may not be the first things that come to mind when contemplating a Catholic edu­cation, hut it was certainly the focus of yesterday's presenta­tion on Christian Identity and lligher Education held at Saint Mary's. 
The third in a series of pre­sentations sponsored by the Cnnl!lr for Academic Innovation, the discussion was lwadnd by Sandra Yocum Mize from the University of Dayton. Miztl, the author of the forth­coming book "Strange Impulse: Educating Women in the Science of Theology, Saint Mary's College, South Bend Indiana (1943-1969)," taught at Saint Mary's from 1988 to 1992. She spoke about Sister Mary Madelnva and her contri­butions to the theological atmosplwre of the college in its early days. 
Aceording to Mize, the pur­posn of the speeeh was to "view thn possibilities of Catholic higllllr education through the eyes of Sister Madeleva." Madnltlva was instrumental in making Saint Mary's the first Roman Catholic institution in the United States to grant a degree in theology to women. 
Madeleva, also known for her elegant and imaginative prose, was intent upon helping Saint Mary's draw a parallel between 20th century materialism and the spirituality that she hoped she could instill in her students. Much of Mize's presentation focused on Madeleva's views of the role of Catholicism and Catholic col­leges in the secular world. 
"Sister Madeleva thought that to enter into the process of a Catholic education was an opportunity to begin a great adventure," said Mize, who then went on to detail the "danger" and romance involved in choosing a Catholic path. 
"There is no doubt that for Sister Madeleva the great dan­ger to Catholic education was exposure to secularism," she explained, adding that Madeleva's romance with Catholicism contributed greatly to the development of the Saint Mary's community as it is known today.

lion without God at its center was merely wordplay, but education with God at the cen­ter was the Word," said Gail Mandell, Saint Mary's profes­sor and biographer of Madeleva. Mandell spoke afterwards in response to Mize and later joined in the open discussion that followed. 
Not content to only establish the School of Sacred Theology, Madeleva was also instru­mental in shaping the vast li­brary resources of Saint Mary's College and had a hand in many of the important deci­sions on campus. 
"The library was a repository of both the sacred and the sec­ular world," said Mandell, not­ing that the theology school was established so that women could receive degrees in theol­ogy, the ultimate goal of which was to establish a core of in­structors to teach at the under­graduate level. 
Both Mize and Mandell agreed that Madeleva was an important figure in shaping the future not only of the Saint Mary's school of theology, but also of the religious training of The Observer/Brandon Candura many women in the years that This skateboarder was just one of many students who took advan­followed. tage of yesterday's warm temperatures to play out on the quads.

Council election runoff. The Barbara Nolan ticket failed to receive the required 50 per­cent plus one vote to win the election. 
"We want to remind the resi­dents to vote on Monday," said Nolan. "The runoffs are just as important, if not more important than the prelimi­nary elections." 
The Jenny Wejman ticket re­ceived 46 percent of the vote in the Regina election. "We figured there would be a runoff," said Murray-Nolan. "We're hoping to win on Monday. We will work to improve ND/SMC relations and Regina Hall." 
Despite the deduction, the Gundler ticket won the McCandless Hall Council elec­tion with a significant majori­ty. Twenty percent of voters abstained against Gundler; 38 percent of future McCandless Hall Residents voted. 
"We hope to get McCandless more involved on campus," said Gundler. "We'd like to unify the dorm and have a great year." 
Patty Corbitt, Rachel Torres, Kim Kurgan, and Julie Kochman will serve as LeMans Hall Council next year. 
They were victorious with a 52 percent majority. "We are very pleased," said Corbitt. "It was a great race. I hope to accomplish our goals and have a great year." 
The Jody Jennings ticket, in­cluding Meghan Driscoll, Megan Gallagher. and Julie Gangloff, claimed the Annunci­ata Hall Council race with 96 percent of the vote. Voter turnout for the hall was 46 percent.

Dante

with his colleague Dino Cervigni of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, translat­ed one of Dante's other works, "Vita Nuova", or "The New Life." Both specialists in medieval literature, Vasta and Cervigni are working on a sec­ond volume to their translation, which Vasta said will serve as a commentary to that work. 
"Stunning" and "massive" are the words Vasta chose to describe Notre Dame's Dante collection. "It's one of the best in the world," he said, "Some of the samples of original material in the collection are very rare." 
The oldest item in the exhibit is a facsimile of "Dante Es­tense," or a photographic copy of a late 14th century manu­script by the Italian poet, which dates back to the 1370s or 1380s, according to Dupont. 
The collection also includes 500-year-old original editions of "The Divine Comedy". Over 50 editions of Dante's work, which include color and black and white reproductions, are on dis­play in the exhibit. 
Some of the more recent artists who have contributed to the collection include the well­known Spanish surrealist Sal­vador Dali, who painted illustra­tions of "The Inferno." 
The work of Robert Pinsky and Michael Mazur, who col­laborated to produce an illus­trated version of Dante's work, is also featured in the exhibit. While Pinsky wrote a verse translation of Dante's "Inferno," Mazur supplied monotype print to illustrate Pinsky's words. 
In a presentation of their book at Notre Dame on March 6, Pinsky said that the theme of "The Inferno" is the "weak faith" of the Pilgrim in the story. D.ante's work can be interpreted as "an imitation of action, a defi­ciency of the soul," Pinsky said of the narrative which describes a journey to hell and, thus, an exploration of the self. 
Mazur said that through the images he created for Pinsky's translation, he attempted to

depict the human soul and to illustrate the themes present in "The Inferno," one of which is the struggle for faith. 
In addition to the artists and literary experts who have praised the University's Dante collection, other faculty mem­bers agree that the Italian poet's work should be showcased at Notre Dame because it en­compasses a vast area of study. 
"Dante was a bridge figure who historically brought to­gether the Medieval period and the Renaissance," said Howard Louthan, assistant professor of history and teacher of a Renais­sance Europe class. Therefore, Dante "linked an older, intellec­tual tradition with a new, emerging mode of thought." 
As an endowed program, the Devers Program in Dante Stud­ies will fund rare book acquisi­tions to the Dante collection, an annual visiting lecturer in Dante Studies and print and electronic publication of scholarly research work in the field. 
As Dupont explained, part of the endowment has already been put to good use. For ex­ample, the 1380s manuscript was a purchased using part of the Devers' donation. And a Web site will be set up with in­formation on the present Dante exhibition in Special Collections next semester. The Renaissance edition of Dante is already on the Web, Dupont said. 
Ted Cachey, associate profes­sor of Romance language and literature and director of the Devers Program, noted the importance of the program. 
"The Devers Program enables the soul, shape and form of Dante to touch the hearts and lives of students at Notre Dame," Cachey said.

Seven-year-old pilot dies in.airplane crash 
By JON SARCHE 
Associated Press 
CHEYENNE, Wyo. 

A 7 -year-old girl who hoped to 
become the youngest person to 
fly cross-country was killed yes­
terday when her small plane 
nose-dived to the ground "like a 
dart" soon after taking off in 
driving rain and snow. Her fa­
ther and her night instructor 
also died. 
Jessica Dubroff, who used a 
red booster seat and extenders 
so her legs eould reach the con­
trol pedals, spoke to her mother 
by telephone even as she rewed 
the engine on the runway. 
Lisa Blair Hathaway said she heard no word of problems as the three began to take off and ended the communication. 
"I beg people to let children fly if they want to fly," a teary­eyed Hathaway said before fly­ing from Boston to Wyoming to daim her daughter's body. She had flown ahead to Massaehusetts to await the arrival of Jessiea and her ex­husband. 
"Clearly I would want all my ehildnm to die in a state of joy. I m1~an, what more eould I ask for? I would prefer it was not at agn 7 but, God, she went with her joy and her passion, and her 
life was in her hands," 
Hathaway said. 
Jessica, her father, Lloyd 
Dubroff, and flight instructor 
Joe Heid began their journey 
Wednesday morning in Half 
Moon Bay, Calif.. and spent the 
night in Cheyenne. They 
planned to arrive Friday in 
Falmouth, Mass. 
The Cessna 17713 owned by 
Heid crashed about one mile 
north of the Cheyenne 
Municipal Airport, narrowly 
missing houses and cars. Its tail 
section came to a rest just 25 
feet from one home's garage. 
"I kept thinking, 'Please! 
Please get some altitude!'" said 
Tom Johnson, a 15-year pilot 
who saw the plane fall. "It just 
went right into the ground. I 
knew no one survived. It would 
have been impossible." 
Johnson, whose office is about a half-block from the crash site, said he spotted the plane shortly after takeoff and it appeared the pilot was trying to return to the airport. He said the plane never got higher than 400 feet. 
"It stalled over my building, winged over and went straight into the ground like a dart," he said. 
Hours after the crash, the

age can fly alongside a licensed

flying: crashing. But she said 
she did not worry about it. 
Jessica lived with her mother, a 9-year-old brother, Joshua, and a 3-year-old sister, Jasmine, in Pescadero, a rural community about 40 miles south of San Franeisco. Lloyd Dubroff lived with his second wife in San Mateo. 
The children were schooled at home, learning to read, write and do arithmetic through such activities as flyiqg, riding horses and even helping rebuild a house. 
On Tuesday, Lloyd Dubroff said he was inspired by another young girl's cross-country flight several years ago, and when Jessica expressed an interest in flying a year ago, he asked her

Israel completes first in potential series of bombings 
Peres advocates further warfare when necessary 
By SAM GHATfAS

BE!HUT 

Israeli aircraft fired rockets across Lebanon yesterday, tar­geting the command center of Ilezhollah guerrillas in Beirut and bombarding cars suspected of earrying the guerrillas' com­manders. 
It was the first time since the 19R2 invasion that Israeli forces have attaeked the Lebanese eap­ital. The airstrikes were in retaliation for llezhollah attacks on Israeli soldiers in southern Lebanon and rocket assaults on northern Israel that killed one soldier and wounded 38 other Israelis this week. 
But with Israeli elections just weeks away and recent suieide bombings deep inside Israel still fresh in Israelis' minds, the nine hours of strikes went beyond the usual reprisal. 
Casualty and damage reports were conflicting, with four or live people reported killed and about a dozen wounded. 
Speaking not long after the airstrikes, Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres refused to rule out further attacks on the Shiite Muslim guerrilla group. 
"We are not trigger-happy, (but) if someone prefers a con­frontation to a dialogue we have

U.S. investigates -weapons plant 
By MARIAM SAMI 
Associated Press 

CAIRO, Egypt 
In a surprising move, Libya offered yesterday to begin talks "without preconditions" over U.S. suspieions it is build­ing an underground chemical weapons plant. 
The United States has accused Libya of building a plant inside a mountain at Tarhunah, 40 miles southeast of the capital Tripoli, to make nerve gas and other chemical weapons. 
U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry, on a visit to Egypt earlier this month, said Washington would not allow the plant to begin operation and suggested it was vulnera­ble to American military strikes. 
Libya's foreign minister, Omar el-Muntasser, dismissed the allegations yesterday as "another lie by U.S. intelli­gence." 
"What I want to make clear is that nothing of what Perry said exists except in the imagi­nation of U.S. intelligence," el-Muntasser said at a news con­ference. 
"No chemical weapons facto­ry exists in Libya, whether above ground or below ground." 
But he said Libya was willing to diseuss the allegations with Washington, insisting it has no quarrel with the United States. 
"We are ready to conduct dialogue without preconditions with any country who will agree to talk to us," he said. 
The Libyans insist Rabta is a pharmaceuticals factory that never made chemical weapons.

Internet services face taxation Train derailment causes 
r 

By ELIZABETH WEISE 
I 
Associated Press 
i I 
SAN FRANCISCO Slowly, surely and to the hor­
f 
ror of many users, that final symbol of civilization-the tax­man -is coming to the Internet. 
A recent decision by the Florida Department of Revenue that it can tax companies pro­viding Internet service set off a storm of protest by business groups. But unbeknownst to many, at least seven states and the District of Columbia already tax computer services -and more are considering it. 
It's all part of a natural pro­gression, said Dan Bucks, ex­ecutive director of the Multistate Tax Commission in Washington, D.C. 
"If states didn't update their tax systems to reflect changes in the economy and technology, (they) would still be basing their taxes on the number of horses you use to draw your buggy," he said. 
But just how to tax cyberspace transactions in a nation made up of 50 states and myriad counties, each with their own sales tax, is a daunting question for Internet service providers, who worry that their nascent industry could crumble under the weight of the accounting tasks. 
In the Florida case, a Gainesville company that sells Internet access on a subscrip­tion basis called the state De­partment of Revenue last year to ask if it should be collecting taxes. 
After some deliberation, the department ruled that a 1985 rewrite of state law that added computer exchange services to the definition of telecommunica­tion service meant that compa­nies that sold access to the Internet were indeed required to pay a gross receipts tax. 
But because the law was writ­ten before those kind of busi­nesses really existed, the department went back to the state Legislature to make sure that's what it wanted. A hearing on the issue is scheduled for Monday in Tallahassee. 
The tax -and the confusion -aren't restricted to Florida. Texas, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, New York, Mas­sachusetts and the District of Columbia also impose sales tax on information services, ac­cording to R. Scot Greirson, a California lawyer specializing in online taxation issues. 
But the field itself is so new that although laws may be on the books, collection is still a haphazard affair. In Austin, Texas, Zilker Internet Park col­lects both state and municipal sales tax from its customers, as seems to be required by state and local law. 
But when asked by a reporter, the director of tax policy for the state, Wade Anderson, said he wasn't sure whether such ser­vices were in fact taxable. 
And that's only for in-state services. An even larger concern is the question of "nexus," or taxable presence. If a person in one state gets an online account through an Internet service provider based in another state, and sends messages through connections in several other states, which state has juris­diction? 
Take, for example, the WELL, an Internet service provider based is Sausalito, Calif., with more than 12,000 subscribers around the world. Vice President Ben Aspero says the company pays sales tax on cus­tomer accounts in California because it is based there. 
But as far as he can tell, under New York law the WELL should also be paying not only state but county-by-county sales tax on its customers who dial in from New York. 
''I'm looking at this thing, thinking I'd have to have a whole department to do that," said Aspero. "It's in my night­mare pile." 
Meanwhile, the WELL is po­litely ignoring the issue until someone comes after it. Many other national Internet service providers seem to be doing the same.

ALBERTON, Mont. 
A railroad tank car contain­ing poisonous chlorine gas derailed and ruptured near this western Montana town yester­day, forcing the evacuation of hundreds of people and send­ing at least 91 to hospitals. 
A cloud of chlorine gas hov­ered over the area throughout the day; emergency officials anxiously watched to see if the plume would dissipate or move. 
Bill Reed, chief of the Mis­soula Rural Fire Department, said late Thursday afternoon the plume was stable and did not threaten other nearby com­munities, including Missoula, one of Montana's largest cities. 
Of 91 people taken to four area hospitals, 11 were admit­ted and two were listed in criti­

Tatarstan and Chechnya both have large Muslim populations and strong separatist leanings. But while Tatar leaders man­aged to reach political agree­ment with Moscow, the Chechen drive for indepen­dence was answered by Krem­lin troops. 
President Boris Yeltsin an­nounced a peace plan March 31 that included calls for new talks through mediators. 
The president, who is seeking re-election in June, is under growing pressure to end the war, which has left at least 30,000 people dead. 
In addition to negotiations, Yeltsin's plan to end the war also called for Russian troops to cease major combat operations. 
·But residents and witnesses, including officials of the Moscow~backed Chechen gov­ernment, say bombings have continued against Chechen vil­lages where the Russians say rebels have bases. 
"I was tidying up the yard and saw that planes were flying overhead," said Khava Ansarova from the village Goity in southwestern Chechnya. 
"They dropped their bombs straight into our garden. Now we have no house, no nothing," she told Associated Press Television from her hospital bed in nearby Urus Martan.

Bob Dole is desperate for a running mate with the appeal of Colin Powell, but will prob­ably not have Powell on the ticket for three reasons. One, Powell will not run. Two, Pat Buchanan's faction of the Republican Party demands a conservative. Three, without Buchanan's crowd, Dole loses. 
With all the speculation about who Dole will pick as his number two man, few have mentioned Notre Dame's own Dan Lungren. A former Congressman from California, Lungren is currently serving as the state's Atto.rney General. Despite Lungren's most recent national media exposure of chasing

can win a smattering of western, south­ern and midwestern states. He can win New Jersey and Ohio, but has serious prob­lems in the industrial Rust Belt, New England and California. Texas and Florida are within Dole's grasp, but it is unlikely that he will carry both. 'Dole must hit several home runs in several large states to win. That is why the short lists include Michigan Governor John Engler, Wisconsin Governor Tommy Thompson, Ohio Governor George Voinovich and Florida Senator Connie Mack. 
All three governors are Catholics. All three come from the industrial midwest. Picking one of them does not guarantee that they can carry more than their state in the region. Senator Mack might be a better pick for Florida's larger electoral vote, but his excuses for not serving in the military rival both Bill Clinton's and Dan Quayle's for creativity. That negative alone may not be worth defending. 

The presidential game hinges on California. It is the game-winning, or game-losing grand slam. For Bob Dole, California gives him a good shot at the presidency. Lose it, and Clinton trots around bases in triumph as a sure winner. For Clinton, a loss in California forces him to strug­gle through the extra innings by playing flawlessly in other regions to overcome his elec­toral deficit. 
If Bob Dole and his advisors were shrewd professionals, Dan Lungren would be their only choice for Vice President because Lungren is their only hope. Aside from being a fel­low Notre Dame graduate, which this writer does not automatically recognize as a credential for political office, Lungren is a professional politician and good human being. He separates the petti­ness and hostilities of politics from personal and family con­cerns. He always takes time to say hello to those he knows, even to us liberal Democrats, and is one of the most gra­cious persons outside of the political arena. If only he could see the "liberal light!

Social Transformation Grounded in Relationships 
I
n Dr. King's dream for the world, economic and racial justice not only reign, but are also grounded in relationships which transform society. 
"Christ has flO body now but yours: no hand, no feet on earth. but yours. Yours are the eyes through which he looks with compassion on this world:yours are the feet with which he walks to do good: yours are the hands with which he blesses all the world. Christ has no body now Of! earth but yours. " -St. Teresa of Avila 
.Jim, a tall, tattooed and large man, stays at a home­less slwlter in Portland, Oregon. While a Holy Cross Associate working at this shelter, I encountered Jim on many occasions; in all honesty, I don't remember car­ing much for his rugged appearance nor his abrasive personality; thus, rather than investing time into devel­oping any relationship with him, I instead chose to avoid attempts at conversation, and consequently, to avoid him whenever I could. Until one afternoon .... 
Tired from a hectic day at a job where a state of per­petual crisis characterizes the majority of both client and workers' lives, I put on my coat and quickly left my office to ride the next bus home. Checking my watch and anxious to leave, I noticed Jim in a crowded space with fifty or so men, waiting for a cot assignment for the evening. Saying hello quickly, I received a tired, low "hello" in return. 
"How's the day been?" I asked, recognizing an ele­ment or gloom in his tone. 
"Not so good," he replied. 
Now I had to make a decision. Do I proceed with fur­ther questions to see if he's okay? Or do I return his remarks with the best and most sincere "Don't worry, things will be all right," I can muster, then hurry out the door to hail the bus home? 
Christ has no body now but yours. 
I
chose (thank God) to ask at least one more question, just one more which manifested interest in his con­cerns and thus provided the smallest light of hope in his depression. He soaked in this tiny (and given how tired I felt -very tiny!) ray and requested that we go into the ollice, to escape the crowded and impersonal space. I agreed reluctantly, realizing that staff rules prohibit presence in a room alone with clients. Immediately as the ollice door closed behind us, this rugged, normally stoic man, three times my size, crum­pled beside me in his own tears and reached out for a much needed hug. What could possibly be wrong? Dmls the possibility of not getting a cot for the evening concern him'? Does continual unemployment upset him'? Does hunger intensify his worries? llow do I respond to the tears of someone I hardly know? 
Arter composing himself enough to speak, he explained simply that today was his birthday, and aside from a eard from home, he had had no contact with anyone else about this special day. Jim just want­fld to get out. lie just wanted, for one night, to leave the erowded yet lonely shelter. He just wanted some­one to buy him a beer for his birthday. lie just wanted another person to spend time with him, not out of duty but out of friendship. 
This experience, together with countless others, starkly indicate one vital need facing most Americans, especially the marginalized. This basic need surfaced over and over during my year at the shelter, and con­tinues to surface in my daily encounters. Three strands of experience inform the recognition of this need, and these experiences thus mature and transform my vision of service. 
Yours are the eyes through which he looks with com­passion on the world. 
T
he first strand involves the fact that crises charac­terize this particular, shelter, and I imagine the majority of them. Initially, shelter programs often plan to provide long term assistance; in fact, we had tried numerous times to implement "case management" programs which employ a young, naive, middle class person like myself, oblivious to the daily stress of life "on the streets," to "advise" forty year old, mature men, ones much wiser than most give them credit. Ultimately, however, "case management" always reduced itself to "crisis-intervention," trying to attend to one's immediate, essential needs: food, shelter. transportation, clothing and the like. Thus, various crises continually either limited or interrupted the opportunities to act as a supportive presence to clients. 
The second strand which informs a newer outlook on service involves the recognition that many of the peo­ple I encountered would not be in a crisis situation had they only had a caring and stable community of sup­port. This network of support could include family, friends, church groups, etc.. but sadly remained nearly (or completely) non-existent. Notably, in a survey taken that same year, one of the questions posed to the homeless was, "Whom do you trust?" An overwhelm­ing number answered either, "No one," or simply, "Myself " Such a telling response reflects a genuine void, an un-connectedness with any supportive, faithful community. 
The third strand which furthers my outlook on ser­vice involves the conditions in which many poverty-stricken individuals live. Visiting "single room occupancies," I observed the "homes" of those at least able to afford monthly rent. One barren room consti­tutes their apartment. Their home consists of dank walls, large enough only to fit a bed and possibly a desk or sink. Their isolated, independent, "trust-no-one" lives exist within these dreary four walls, entirely unconnected with the society they view as untrustworthy. 
Jim, one of many, by the hour encounters these experiences of crisis, loneliness, and lack community. What can one do to temper such marginalization? How does one appropriately respond to this essential, yet unrecognized need for community? 
Yours are the feet with which he walks to do good: yours are the hands with which he blesses all the world. 
ountless experiences of the lonely and of the mar­Cginalized led to discussions in which my housemate and I marveled at work done by Sisters and volunteers of The Downtown Chapel, a Holy Cross church situated in the center of such poverty. Though the Downtown Chapel responds to immediate "crisis" needs when possible, it also offers an altogether unique ministry which nourishes the emotionally and spiritually impov­erished community. This ministry recognizes what most government programs, social workers, and even most church ministries do not. Like God incarnate, 
W
whose very self became-me Christ to dwell among us, these volunteers bring their very selves to the lonely and isolated. They do not try to simply meet an individ­ual's material needs. Instead, they do what many view to be non-essential; they visit. They visit the residents of single room occupancies. They seek out those whom others try to ignore. They sit with them, talk to them, and listen to them. They are Christ's body. Theirs are his eyes which look with compassion on the world. Theirs are his feet with which he walks to do good and the hands with which he blesses the world. e in society will not solve our crises simply with more food nor with better shelters. We will not solve crises by avoiding the marginalized via separate neighborhoods with advanced security systems, nor with an increased police force, nor with bigger prisons. The crises of life will only truly be addressed through caring and supportive relationships. Few relationships can ever fully resolve another's problems, yet they pro­vide a foundation of support; they bring Christ's self to another to share in another's loneliness, to offer anoth­er encouragement, to grapple with another's painful situation, and thus to transform lives. 
I might easily, yet irresponsibly imagine that the "Jim's" of this country exist only in homeless shelters or low-income housing, and not in my daily experi­ences as a student at Notre Dame. One, in fact, lives right here. Ironically, she shares the same last n-me as the man in Portland. More importantly, however, she too crumples under the indescribable burden of being and feeling utterly alone, unconnected with a society which would, in her eyes, continue uninterrupt­ed without her. This woman at Notre Dame excels in her studies, yet remains plagued by an insecurity I doubt will ever be healed. She tries desperately to have and to be a friend, yet regularly alienates others in her despair and seemingly endless need. I sense that she sometimes contemplates suicide to escape from her loneliness. 
!
And so again, I must make a decision. Do I ask another question and invite her to share this loneliness with me? How do I invest myself in a challenging situa­tion, one which I would rather avoid and which appears to involve far more energy than I possess? I remember now not only the work by volunteers of the Downtown Chapel, but also Dostoevsky's words that, "Love in reality is a harsh and dreadful thing com­pared to love in dreams." imagine that at least one "Jim" exists in all of our lives. He is the one who, in our hurry home, stops us to share some important news. He is the one we often want to avoid, the one with the abrasive personality or the desperate desire for recognition. Jim is the person who either goes unnoticed at a social gathering, or the one we never think of to invite. He is the one we regu­larly see alone at the dining hall or on campus. Who will respond to such need? Whether on or off the street, the underlying crisis in our society appears not simply to be homelessness or hunger or poverty or crime, but rather a society which rnrnains unconnect­ed, one which avoids relationships and thus the responsibilities which relationships entail. Who will seek out the lonely among us? Clearly we must, each and every day witiJ those here in our midst, for Christ has no body now on earth but ours.

Likely's participation in Board ofTrustees report questioned 
A myriad of words came to mind when I read in the last Thursday's Observer that position? Cristiane Likely had been named among four contributors to the Board of Trustees In her November 15 piece, Likely writes "... it is necessary to now evaluate the report this May.

I believe the expression GLND/SMC debate, our outgoing leaders Jonathan Patrick and Likely was looking for was "intents and purposes." Jonathan Dennis McCarthy took a quantum leap backward in addressing ' Likely, in her usual, Patrick says Likely will "contribute a student voice in written the very real and serious issue of multiculturalism at Notre form."

Canadian Domers head south for more than the winter 
By DAN CICHALSKI Accent Copy Editor 

ll
ey are our neighbors to the north, hailing from he second largest country in the world, known or (among other things) its bacon and the sport 
of ice hockey. 

They are citizens of the same country as Dan Akroyd, Wayne Gretzky and Barenaked Ladies. They are Canadians, and several have matriculated at Notre Dame to pursue their education and take advantage of the opportunities college has to offer. 
Although they fit right in and are no more noticeable than a Texan is to a New Englander (or vice-versa), Notre Dame's Canadian students are aware of the slight differences and little things that set the coun­tries apart. 
Fresh-man Scott Giuliani, originally from Burlington, Ontario, forty-five minutes east of Toronto, points out that "there are a lot of similarities [between Canada and the United States] but there are some differences. You can't say we're the same at all. When I go home, I notice the differences. But you see them among the states too." 
Several of Giuliani's countrymen and countrywomen agree. Freshman Benoit Cotnoir, from Rouyn-Noranda, Quebec (400 miles north of Montreal), asks "Where do you want me to start?" when dis­cussing American­Canadian differ­ences. "For one thing, hockey isn't as big here and there are dif­ferences in sports in gen­eral." But Cotnoir has another cul­tural barrier to cross: "French is my first language and my back­ground is very different. I've been speaking English for only two years." 
"Canada is a lot more liberal," says fr<>shman Emily Block, from Toronto. "There's a lot less crime and racism in Canada and our cities are cleaner and safer. But people are a lot friendlier here." 
Perhaps there is a reason Americans seem friend­lier: "Canadians like to be distinct from Americans," says freshman Megan McNally, from St. Catharine's, Ontario. 
All four agree in one general contrast between Canada and the United States: Canadians know more about America than Americans do about Canada. American history is not required in Canadian sec­ondary schools, but classes are offered. ".I took a course," Giuliani recalls. "It mostly dealt with how American history relates to Canada." 
"Americans are more concerned with their own country," Cotnoir says. This observation is evident. Consider any high school class offerings or even Notre Dame's own DART books: few, if any, classes on Canadian history or literature, even in the context of · American history. "Americans seem to overstate their role [in history]," Block adds. 
So what would convince someone from "the Great White N,orth" to cross the border to attend college? The fact that this is Notre Dame has a little to do with it. "Opportup.ity, change," says Giuliani. "This school has a lot to offer. Hockey was part of my decision, too. I wanted the chance to play at a competitive level." 
While Giuliani made the Irish hockey team as a walk-on, Cotnoir was recruited. "[Notre Dame] was the best option I had," he says. "I wanted to play at a higher level and this is a good school." 
McNally, who moved to Ontario from the United States in 1984, had no choice concerning the country in which she would attend college. "I had to go to an American school," she states. And Block is in the 
same boat as hundreds of 
o t h e r

-?'"" have the borders
.rJ to consider. But, at 
least in the cases of 
these four, that did not 
present too much of a 
problem. "My dad was a little hesi­tant," recalls Block. "But that was because my parents didn't want me going so far away." 
Giuliani and Cotnoir both describe their parents as being "completely supportive" when they made their decisions to come to Notre Dame. 
In the same way that students from the coast miss the ocean and others from the west miss the mountains when they spend eight months of the year in northern Indiana, Canadians long for some of the things ·absent in the United States. "There's a whole attitude," Block says. "There's no per­vasive fear. people are just people. I miss the diversity and seeing different types of people." 
Giuliani and Cotnoir both miss the hockey. "Compared to Canada, you don't get any hockey here," laments Giuliani. "And the broadcasters 
back home are better." 

Last fall, the news coming out of Canada that most Americans might be aware of dealt with the vote in Quebec on whether or not the French-Canadian province would secede from the rest of the nation. "I think it's funny that Americans ask about that," Block says. "There's so much going on in Canada but that's all that gets down here. All my professors ask me about it, too. I don't think Quebec should secede." 
"I'm glad they didn't secede," says Giuliani. "A big part of Canada would have been taken away and it would have been tough for the country to stay together." 
Coming from Quebec, Cotnoir has a different perspective on the situation but the same opin­ion. ''I'm fortunate. I got to travel a lot [because of playing hockey] and to see western

secede." 

If there is one thing that America is consistent in when it comes to other countries, it is the stereotypes (perhaps prejudices?) that this country has for others. 
Some of the more common ones about Canada have been expressed in pop culture in movies like "Strange Brew" and a version of the "Twelve Days of Christmas" by Bob and Doug Mackenzie, the two main characters in the movie. "I think the 'eh' thing is right," Cotnoir says. "It's humorous. I don't take offense," states McNally. 
"I catch myself saying 'eh,' " Giuliani admits. "People let you know about it in the states. When I'm down here I notice it more-like the accent in words like 'out' and 'about."' 
"I've got stories about that one," Block laughs. "People have asked me if I live in igloos. But I think [the stereotypes] are kind of stupid. Americans are ignorant about Canada-1 live in a city as big as Chicago. Americans make more of a distinction between America and Canada. Canadians see it more as North America." 
Although these four Notre Dame Canadians all hap­pen to be freshmen, they are already thinking ahead beyond graduation and whether to stay in the United 

States or return to Canada-and both sides of the spectrum are covered. "That's a big dile.mma for me," says Block. "I like Canada better, but I'll probably stay here." 
"I love it here," Cotnoir says. "I like traveling and I'd love to go to Europe, too. But at one point I'll probably go back to Canada." 
"I wouldn't mind a job in Canada," McNally remarks. "But I'll probably stay here." 
"I'm undecided," says Giuliani. "I can't really say that now. But I at least now know I'm not going to live in South Bend." 
Despite the obvious differences between Americans and Canadians, both sides at least are in agreement on their opinions of Notre Dame and its standing and prestige. And, it seems, in their feelings towards the city of South Bend.

ast night the Barenaked Ladies excitnd the crowd at Stnpan Center with their Canadian rock sound, hut tonight students and the public have the opportunity to shift gears and go hack in time to lwar and see the music that has helped form the different rock 'n roll styles of today. 
Jazz is a dynamic and highly creative form of music in which the idnntity of naeh musician and each instrument play in eoncnrt with others and ean also hn showeased individually. Jazz is about mixing improvisation and struc­turn to create sounds whieh have the ability to snt moods and sway emotions. 
Live jazz like the kind that can be seen tonight and tomorrow at the Collegiate Jazz Festival is the best way to appmdate the music because seeing it live pmwtratns the audio and visual sensations. 
Sooing the artists play with the same emotion that the writers of the music 
put into their pitlees while sirnultane­

Wiskerchen C.S.C. 

These three have worked in conjunc­tion with many devoted students to bring Notre Dame an event that is unequaled on any other campus. The festival has a rich thirty-eight year his­tory that is still being written this year. Bands hail from four different states and eight universities, including: Oberlin, Western Illinois, Purdue, Central Michigan, Northern Illinois, Illinois and Western Michigan. The University of Illinois is back for the first time in several years, and Fr. Wisknrchen thinks they will prove to be one of the favorites in the ·competition. lie says. "Illinois sounds real good, and it's good to have them hack at the festi­val." 
All of the bands are very impressive and offer a wide range of jazz, from big bands to combos. Their performances are complemented by Friday night's .Judges Jam, which is a session of the judges who evaluate them. 
This year's group of ". .. judges is.loaded with

sonalities to the performances might be a phenomenon to which many p11ople at Notre Dame have rwver bmm exposed. 
Tlw .Jazz Festival unveils this art to both those who have never giv11n jazz a second listen, and sat­islies the hunger of thosn who wait all year to see some of the best jazzmen in the eountry play tlwir astonishing music. 
Tlw festival is an affair that attracts some of the finest coiiPge jazz hands i tlw country to co pPte, learn, and tlwir trade with oth ers who sham a simi Jar lovtl for tht musie. This year festival is chaired by Sue Himnann and MikP Sasemt, who both play in Notre Dame's jazz hands as Wtlll. The twt~nt is also guidml by longtime faculty advisor and band director Bev. George

some artists whose careers are rela­tively new but accomplished, and a couple whose roles as lead­. ing jazz m us i­c ian s span 
generations. Fr. Wiskerchen is thrilled with the pros that Hiemann and Sasena were able to drum up. IIe says, "This is a great group. !Wallace) Roney is something else. He's really line, and it's

also good to have [Richard) Davis back with us after a few years. It should also be an interesting set because some of them have recorded together recently." 
Roney is one of the premier trumpet players in the world; like many hot artists, he spent his time touring with Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers. In 1991, Honey made an international splash by being chosen by Miles Davis to play with him at Switzerland's Montreaux Festival. 
Hichard Davis is an artist whose recordings cover many years and band leaders. Donald "Duck" Harrison has blown his saxophone with the best in the business. He has played with probably the most famous and cer­tainly the most accom­plished judge, drummer Hoy Haynes. Haynes began his professional career in the 1940's, and he has provided the rhythms for greats such as Sara Vaughan, Louis Armstrong, and Charlie Parker. He has won what is the equivalent to the Nobel Prize for Jazz, and he is a member of the International Academy of Jazz Hall of Fame. The other judges are the youth­ful pianist Geoff Keezer, and critic Dan Mortgenstern. 
Mortgenstern has been a part of the panel nearly every year since 1968, a definite sign of the quality of bands that play in South Bend each Spring. Fr. Wiskerchen claims, "Dan is one of the most knowledgeable jazz historians and critics around. lie provides a sense of history and perspective." This perspec­tive will also be aided by Haynes' expe­rience. Mortgenstern's loyalty to the festival is not only a testament to the level of jazz found here, but it signifies the tradition that the festival embodies as the oldest festival of its kind in America. 
The members of the Student Union Board, the musicians in the Monday Night Band and the Tuesday Night Big Band, and the rest of the people involved are sure to deliver a spectacu­

lar event. In addition to a magnificent group of upper­classmen like drummer Greg Van Slam brook and vocalist Emily Lord, Notre Dame's band features some freshmen that Fr. 

Wiskerchen is very excited about. He says, "Our band is very good. There are some very good freshmen. and usually we don't find that." He is talking about soloists Jeff Spoonhower and Phil Erskine on trombone, and Keith Syska on sax. Riemann cannot think of a bet­ter show that is so conducive to bring­ing a date and has so much bang for the buck. At $5 for the Friday session, $1 for Saturday afternoon, $3 for Saturday night, and $6 for an all-session pass, Fr. Wiskerchen is on the mark when he says that students "ean't claim it costs too much money." The public can get the whole package for $15. 
The festival opens tonight at 7:30p.m. in Stepan with Notre Dame's band, which is followed by other universities' and the Judges .Jam at 10:30 p.m. The afternoon session starts at 1 pm, and Saturday evening revs up with Illinois at 
7:30 p.m. Tickets are available at the La Fortune Student Center information desk and at the door. If you have never seen live jazz, this is your opportunity. Don't let it happen without you. 
Barenaked Fun 
By KEVIN DOLAN 
Mu;i, Criti<

t's t•asy to forgt•t that the Barenaked Ladies are a rock 'n' roll band when you'm sitting there, before the show, watching them eat Chinese food. Guitarist J·:d Hobc1rtson mnergns from outside with his plate· and a thick hook, soon putting them down to throw hacky-sacks-"this one's hand­sewn," lw announces proudly-at the Bogmen. Bassist Jim Creeggan ohst1rves the food sknptieally, chatting with the girl who serves it. Load singer Sttwtm Page is nowhere to be found. but his voice drifts over the PA as "Break Your lleart" plays. Tyler Stewart is eating, less than enthusiastically. 
In a few hours, they will take the stage and play a show that blends their zany pnrsonalities with some of the linest songwriting and musicianship on the planet. flow do they strike the balance between business and pleasure? 
"We have to keep nach other amused," says Stewart, munching on an egg roll. "Wiwn yo11'n~ on tour ten months a year, you want to be amused by your buddies, not lw bummed out by 'em, you know?" 
Presumably, he refers to the process behind their second full-length American relnase, Maybe You Should Drive. lie nods and admits without hesitation, "It was lwllish. /\ndy (Creeggan, brother of Jim and former keyboardist) wanted to leave tlw hand. St1we was not in the greatest of mental health. We had been away from the hand for a long time, and I don't think we were ready to come back and work." 
"For exarnpl11," Stewart continues, "I think I recorded the drum track to '.Jane" about 70 times, you know? It was that kind of thing. Ilalf the time, it was one guy and the producer in th1~ studio, and that isn't how we work." 
That has all ehanged with their new release, Born On A Pirate Ship, and the aeeornpanying tour. "We recorded this one with more of the group thing. Michael (Phillip Wodjewoda, producer) just let us go in and play our songs. We had been erafting songs on the last album, hut now there's a lot more group input. Miehael lets tlw band sound like they sound." · 
It shows on stagn. Thn Barnnaked Ladies tnndc1d to the acoustic in the past, and tlwy've k1~pt to that for the most part. whieh doesn't translabl well to playing in the lunar module Dorners know as Stepan Center. IIowever, Stewart is unfazed. "We wern playing 15,000 seat arenas in Canada live years ago. We've gone from small dubs, to small tlwatres. to arenas, and baek to small clubs down here. This sum­mer in Detroit, we're playing Pine Knob, whieh is about 15,000." 
"We ustHI to treat our shows like it was just us and the fans hanging out in a hasmnent. Now it's likn us and the fans hanging out in, like .... " lie gestures around, searching l'or words. "This place, here. You play a bigger place, you make

your sound bigger." 
And bigger it is. Their pirate-map backdrop was absent, but the joie de vivre was no less apparent. The Barenaked Ladies are a fun band, and they can play, .• too. You may not hear them on the radio that much, but Barenaked Ladies could care less. "We're not 'alternative' enough for radio, but. .." Stewart is more amused than frustrated. "You never know what's gonna fly down here. I mean, who would have though llootie and the Blowfish would sell12 million! That's boring. It's hard to tell the difference between bands anymore." 
Nonetheless, BNL plans to keep on keepin' on. "In ten yrnrs, I hope to be a lot f-ing richer," jokes Stewart. "But I'd also like to be making music with the Barenaked Ladies." Considering that Tyler and Hobertson wrote together for the first time in three years, a session that produced twenty songs. the future looks bright. Judging from their stage show, the present is shining.

Shark attacks Masters' record 

By RON SIRAK Associated Press 
AUGUSTA, Ga. 
Greg Norman, more than anyone, knows that major championships aren't won on Thursday. 
More than anyone, the man who has finished second in a major eight times knows how much work he has ahead of him. 
But perhaps more than any­one, Greg Norman wants to win the 60th Masters at Augusta National Golf Club. 
"Those two guys have some­thing I want," Norman said Wednesday night at a dinner where he was honored, looking at Tom Watson and Ben Crenshaw and speaking about the green Masters jackets they've won. "And I'm going to go get it." 
He took a dramatic step in that direction in the first round, shooting a 9-under-par 63, two strokes better than Phil Mickelson and four better than Bob Tway and Scott Hoch. 
For all the times Norman's greatness had been denied in a major championship, especial­ly at Augusta where he has fin­ished in the top six seven times but never won, golfs greatest money winner was for one day golfs greatest player. 
Norman's round, only the fourth 9-under-par round in the history of all the majors, was an overwhelming effort on a lightning-fast course. 
It started normally enough with six consecutive pars. Then the awesome talent that has astounded, baffled, amazed and confused a generation of golf fans kicked in. 
Closing with nine birdies in the last 12 holes, Norman tied the major championship record with his 63. 
"When you get into that type of roll like I got into today you just decide to let the reins loose and let the horse run," 
Norman said. 

Run they did. Birdie putts of 10 feet, 10 feet and 14 feet to close the front nine in 33. After pars on Nos. 10 and 11 -a bunker save on 10 that he al­most holed -Norman birdied Nos. 12-15, making two-putt birdies on both the par 5s. 
He tied the course record set in 1986 by Nick Price with a 10-foot birdie putt on No. 17 and a 24-footer on the final hole to close the back nine in 30. 
"This was one of my handful of great rounds," Norman said after posting only the 18th 63 in major championship history and the fourth on a par-72 course.

Red Wings shoot for record against 'Hawks 
By HARRY ATKINS 
Associated Press 
DETROIT 

The Detroit Hed Wings are chasing an NIIL record. Whether they achieve it may depend on whether Chicago wants to play hockey. The brawling Blackhawks have been talking blood bath. 
Tlw Hed Wings became just thn second NIII. team ever to win 60 games in a season, matching the 1976-77 Montreal Canadim1s with a 5-2 victory over the Winnipeg Jets on Wmlnnsday night. 
The Hed Wings have two games remaining. They play the Blackhawks at Joe Louis Arena, in a rematch of Sunday's brawl in Chieago. They finish Sunday at Dallas. 
Chicago is 0-4-1 against the Red Wings this season. The frustration is beginning to show. Chicago coach Craig Hartsburg had the Blackhawks playing roughhouse on Sunday, trying to intimidate the Red Wings. 
But the move backfired. Chicago's goon tactics resulted in 95 minutes of penalties. The Hed Wings scored three times in 13 power-play chances and left the Windy City with a 4-1 victo­ry,

tice at Notre Dame until towards t~e end of the season last year." 
Bryant's prolonged absence from practice, combined with a change in position from line­backer to defensive end as well as a change in the offensive schemes he sees in practice, has led to an expected degree of frustration on his part. 
"It's been tough, but I'm just trying to ta:ke it day by day, make the best of the situation," said Bryant. I've gotten better to the point where I can go out there and at least try to con­tribute." 
The Irish coaching staff has continued to put faith in Bryant's potential, slating him to backup veteran Bert Berry at rush end next season.

ously a real fine athlete," mused defensive coordinator Bob Davie. "He's up against a lot of obstacles now, but in the end, that's what's going to help him. The things we're expecting from him escalate his whole process of development. We're throwing the whole ball of wax at him now." 
That ball of wax appeared a little heavy for Bryant during Thursday's practice, during which the freshman struggled to pick up a few defensive schemes, although often com­pensating for his mistakes with his pure athleticism. Bryant is the first to admit that he is up against a much tougher chal­lenge now than he ever saw in high school. 
"I always was a physical play­er," said Bryant. "I never really got blocked in high school. It's a little different going up against this offensive line here." 
Bryant certainly wasn't blocked much in high school, garnering 160 tackles and six sacks his senior year on the way to earning all-state honors. But college is a different story, and Bryant is yet to become a lead­ing character. 
Davie isn't the only one who sees a world of potential in Bryant. however. 
"lie's the type of person who's going to do whatever the coach­es ask him to do," said Berry, who was been an inspiration to the freshman as of late. 'We have a great friendship going on, and I'm looking forward to seeing him progress. lie's young and inexperienced, but he's got the mold to be a great one." 
Bryant himself is more cau­tious with his words, saying, 'Til just try to give it my all, see what happens." 
Bryant's standing in the an­nals of Notre Dame football re­mains to be seen, but it appears clear that he has taken the first crucial steps towards achieving that greatness. 
He has overcome adversity.

The Saint Mary's softball team looks forward to revers­ing what occurred against Adrian College last weekend and renewing a winning streak as they face Concordia University this weekend. The Belles have been off since last Saturday, after losing a disap­pointing pair of games to Adrian. 
The Belles have certainly had their ups and downs this season, and were frustrated to leave for Easter with two fresh losses on their minds. Coach Jan Travis and many players

felt that they were too anxious to head home for the holidays and were not mentally in the game. 
"At times, it seemed like we were already home for Easter," Travis stated. "It was as if we were not in the game at all. We played a good defensive game but we will never win a game when we are batting .149 to our opponent's .404, which was the case against Adrian". 
So it was batting practice that took up much of the Belles' practice time this week. Both the coaches and the team hope that honing their hitting skills will help to combat some of the slumps that they find themselves in during games. It also helps that the Belles can now practice outside, a treat that was not so long ago for­bidden to them because of the cold weather. . 
"It is good to have days out­side to work on our bats," said Travis. "It also helps to work on defensive situations that is otherwise difficult simulating indoors." 
The Belles trounced Concordia last year in both games of their double header by scores of 12-2 and 13-8. They hope to put on a repeat

Sports Wri1er 
The Notre Dame men's tennis team has one last chance to proVIl to the rest of the country that they are still a force to be reekorwd with. They face their final opportunity to improve tlwir national ranking before tournament play. 
With just two regular season dual matches left. the Irish are looking to build on their recent monumtum. The team is riding on the wings of a four-match winning streak, so this chance comes at an opportune time. 
The squad will take on a twelfth-ranked Texas team this weekend. The Longhorns will be a tough match-up, as their top three players have been ranked in the top ten in the eighteen and under age group. In addition, their lineup includ11s some formidable imports from England and a newcomer this semester from South Africa. Nationally ranked B. J. Stern and Paul Martin lead their charge for the Longhorns. 
Winning two out of three at the Blue Gray Classic has high­lighted an exceptional year for the Longhorns. Last September the Irish came out on top of a 4­3 decision in an exhibition match. 
However that match was played on quicker indoor courts while the meeting this Saturday will be outside on the slow courts of Austin. 
"They are a lot better out­doors," explained Irish head coach Bobby Bayliss. "It was good that we got outside yes­terday for practice and for the Purdue match." 
Key for the Irish will be capturing the doubles and tak­ing advantage of their depth at 
love you, Mom& Dad 

the bottom of the lineup. 
"We need to figure out a way to win the doubles point," Bayliss explained. "I think we have an edge down low, so we'll have to take advantage there." 
The Irish will be looking to the sophomore-freshman combination of Jakup Pietrowski and Brian Patterson who have compiled a 13-5 mark to lead the team. 
"Jakup and Brian have been very solid," Bayliss raved. "Brian brings a lot of athleti­cism and Jakup is probably our best pure doubles player." 
On the singles side Bayliss is hoping either Mike Sprouse or Pietrowski or Ryan Simme can pick up a point or two at the top of the lineup. 
"We're going to have to scratch and claw Saturday, they are tough at the top," Bayliss observed. "Itis a match we can win, but we'll have to play very well to come out with a win." 
After taking on the Longhorns the Irish will get a couple of days off before finishing up re­gional action at Michigan next Tuesday. 
Irish commit three errors which led to three unearned runs, it was the bat of fresh­man Allen Greene and the arm of senior Rich Sauget which saved the day. 
Greene, who filled in for the injured Rowan Richards in right field, went 3-4 with four RBI, and Sauget pitched the fi­nal two innings to stabilize an erratic Irish bullpen and earn his fourth save of the season. 
Three of Greene's career­high four RBI came in the sec­ond inning, when his bases­loaded double off loser Tom Stauffer put the Irish up 5-l. Greene also helped seal the vic­tory in the eighth, with a one­out RBI single which put the Irish up 8-6. 
"He's been in and out of the lineup," said Mainieri of Greene. "With Rowan (Richards) hurt, we're looking for somebody to step up and take that job." 
"With Rowan out, somebody had to step up, and Coach basi­cally offered the job to anyone," said Greene following the game. "I'm just glad I was able to get in there and contribute."

on one hit. But when Stavisky turned the ball over to Wally Widelski in the seventh, trouble began brewing for the Irish. 
Widelski gave up three hits which would lead to three runs for the Rockets, failing to record a single out. In the early going, it looked as if Sauget would struggle sa well. 
Sauget surrendered an RBI single to the first batter he faced, but bounced back to erase two Toledo batters on a double play ball. But the hard­throwing reliever allowed yet another RBI single and a wild pitch, and trouble seemed to loom with the lead narrowed to just 7-6.• 
But Sauget struck out Jon Kempf swinging with some nasty side-armed heat, finally dousing the name from the Rockets. 
Greene's RBI single in the bottom of the eighth gave Sauget a two run cushion head­ing into the ninth, and the Irish closer didn't disappoint, allow­ing just one hit before sealing the victory. 
"I came in and threw strikes, and that's what I'm supposed to do," said Sauget. "I was happy with the way I threw, although I could have done bet­ter." 
Sauget now owns a 2.66 ERA to go along with his four saves, and he has fanned 29 batters in just 23 2/3 innings of work in emerging as the clear closer on the Irish staff. 
The next test for the Irish will come this weekend, when the team plays host to Big East National division rival Rutgers ina crucial three-game series.

"This team is team-orient­ed," De Riso said. "There are no real starters like last year, and that's what makes it so much fun to play each week. They (the opposition) don't know who they have to shut down." 
.As the big-game pressure starts to build, Corrigan thinks that the balanced attack will be prepared to meet the latest challenge. 
"The road trip may have been good for us. It forced us to concentrate, work on our fundamentals and come togetber as a team. It may have been a blessing in dis­guise," he said. 
And despite the remarkable road winning streak, Irish players recognize that now is no time to rest on their laurels. 
"This is a big game, but its going to be nice to be home in a game like this. I think our best lacrosse is yet to come," said Dusseau.

6-4, 6-3. The other freshman, Marisa Velasco, won at the No. 4 singles position. She defeated Texas' Laura Berendt, 6-3, 6-3. 
At the No. 6 singles spot, sophomore Molly Gavin squeaked past the Longhorns' Anne Pastor, 7-5, 7-6. 
.In the doubles competition, the Irish dropped their first match, but claimed wins at the No. 2 and No. 3 doubles spots. Seniors Wendy Crabtree and Holyn Lord, ranked nineteenth nationally, lost out to the eleventh-ranked pair of Cristina Moros and Farley Taylor, 4-6, 5­
7. The pair consisting of junior Erin Gowen and Hall won 6-4, 7-5. Sophomore Kelley Olson and Velasco claimed the win for the team, by defeating their Longhorn opponent in three tough sets, 2-6, 6-4, 6-4. 
"Basically, we were excited that we won," stated Velasco, "Everyone played really well." 
The team then headed to North Carolina to take on the Blue Devils. The match was much tighter than the score showed, according to Louderback. Duke claimed a quick 4-2 lead against the Irish in singles compntition. The only Irish players to win their singles matches were the freshmen. Hall squeezed out a close match, 3-6, 6-4, 6-3. Velasco quickly silenced her opponent, 6-3, 6-0. 
The doubles competition was shortened due to weather and time, so the Irish did not really get a chance to rally back. In the end they fell to Duke, 2-5. 
The netters did not have a chance to recover as they had to face Wake Forest the next day. In the singles competition, the Irish were strong in the middle of their line-up. At No. 3 sin­gles, Crabtree annihilated Wake Forest's Nicola Kaiwai, 6-0, 6-0. Then at the fourth position Velasco captured a close victory over Maggie Harris, 6-7, 6-2, 7­
6. Gowen pummeled the Deacons' Cristina Caparis, 6-3, 6-3. 
The doubles competition start­ed ofT heading in the right direc­tion as Lord and Crabtree won, 9-7. At the No. 2 spot, Gowen and Hall dropped their match 3­8, and at the No. 3 spot, Olson and Velasco were defeated 6-8. The Irish just couldn't put away the surging Deacons, and they fell 4-5. 
The high point of the past week was the stellar play of the freshmen. Hall has proven her worth throughout the season, as she had steadily moved up to the No. 1 singles position. Velasco showed her power as she was the only Irish player to win all three of her singles matches. 
The Irish are looking to bounce back against Indiana at home on Friday.

• HOCKEY 
Key recruits revive Irish hopes 
By MIKE DAY 
Assistant Sporrs Ediror 
It was a season of firsts for Notre Dame hockey coach Dave Poulin. And although the cam­paign was marred by disap­pointment and frustration, there is reason for optimism as Poulin concluded his first re­cruiting season. 
The rookie head coach un­veiled the Class of 2000 Wednesday, and although it is too early to make any predic­tions, this could be the class that adds life to a program that seems to be on its deathbed. 
Recruits Troy Bagne, Nathan Borega, Joe Dusabek, Tyson Fraser, Sean Molina, and Ben Simon could become household names within the next year for the Irish. Coach Poulin is con­fident that the group will help lift the Irish back to re­spectability. 
"We feel that we ended up with a really strong class," said Poulin. "We targeted a very small number of players, and we were able to get six of them. They seemed like they wanted to be part of building a pro­gram at Notre Dame." 
With Garry Gruber, Jeremy Coe and Davide Dal Grande graduating, the Irish were forced to address a need at the defensive end. Blue-chip de­fensemen Fraser, Molina, and Borega hope that, come next season, they will be able to fill the void for Notre Dame. 
Fraser, a native of Surrey, British Columbia, represented the province in the Canada Winter Games all-star competi­tion. He was also named to the BCHL all-star squad as one of the league's top defenseman. 
"The opportunity to play next season," said Fraser, "along with the coaching staff was what influenced me the most to go to Notre Dame." 
A resident of Skokie, Ill., Molina played for the Dubuque Fighting Saints of the USHL last season. The six foot, 185 pound defender was accepted into Notre Dame last year but chose to continue his develop­ment in the USHL. 
"He is a highly skilled player who should contribute right away," said Poulin. "He played in a pretty good league (USHL), so he has a lot of experience. He is the type of player that can contribute on special teams and at the offensive end." 
At 6-foot-2, 225 pounds, Borega has the size and strength to make Irish fans for­get about Dal Grande. Hailing from Wasila, Alaska, Borega is currently playing for the BCHL Vernon Vipers and was named to the all-star team in his rook­ie season. 
"I feel like I can help the team next year and be part of a pro­gram that is on the way up," said Borega. "Coach Poulin has created a lot of excitement about hockey at Notre Dame. I am really looking forward to being part of what he started." 
The Irish offense was a weak­ness last season, struggling to put the puck into the net, even against the CCHA's weakest teams. Poulin's sights are set on changing that next year, and he feels that Dusabek, Bagne, and Simon will be a big help.

some high skilled players who should make an impact for us next season," said Poulin. "We're excited about the guys we got coming here. We feel like we got the type of players necessary to build a team." 
Of the three, Bagne is ex­pected to make the most im­mediate impact. From Moorhead, Minn., the six foot, 170 pound right wing was a member of the US Select 16 team in 1994 and the Select 17 team in 1995 and led his high school team to States in two of the last three seasons. 
Simon, a native of Shaker Heights, Ohio; and Dusabek, from Faribault, Minn., agreed to attend Notre Dame during November's early signing peri­od. The pair gave Poulin some­thing to look forward to as he. struggled through his rookie season. 
"Ben and Joe are both ag­gressive, skilled players who should help out at the defensive end as well as the offensive end," said Poulin. 
Together, the Class of 2000 gives Irish fans the rare oppor­tunity to be optimistic.
