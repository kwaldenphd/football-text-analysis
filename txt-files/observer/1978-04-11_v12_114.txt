He used various than life. This gives films a voyeuristic quality.'' 

Knight traced the development 
of cinema from the nickelodeons to 
the large theatres. The motion 
picture association was formed 
in1915 to provide self-regulation, 
he explained, because "The Su­
preme Court ruled that films were 
an instrument of commerce and 
thus not protected by the rights 
given to other forms of expression. 
This ruling did not change until 
1952." 

During this period, Americas' 
desire for sex in the cinema was 
satisfied by films which used crafty 
ploys and pretexts to display nudity 
and sex, Knight said. 
"This new freedom made the 
film producers realize that X-rated 
movies have limited audjence and 
are attended by mass audience only 
when enough 'heat' is placed upon 
the movie by the press." 
Knight used film segments rang­
ing from early 1900 films to a 
milder segment from Deep Throat. 
Included was a short view of Mom 
& Dad, a 1946 movie which grossed 
over $40 million and is still used for 
sex education purposes. 
"I am not here to defend Deep 
Throat, concluded Knight, "but if a 
film like this is prosecuted it may 
make vulnerable some of the most 
distinguished films of our time 
such as Midnight Cowboy, Carnal 
Knowledge and Last Tango In 
Paris.'' 

Knight is currently a professor of 
cinema at the University of South­
ern California and writes for Play·

The UveUest Art, a comprehensive 
history of film and was film· critic 
for the Saturday Review for over . twenty years.

ing Program compared Notre Dame's freshmen applicants and enrollees with national norms in several areas. The typical enrolled freshman last fall at Notre Dame had a 3.71 overall grade point average in high school, and almost three in four incoming students were in the top 10 per cent of their graduating classes. The average grade point for prospective appli­cants to all four-year private insti­tutions of higher learning in the nation was 3.16, with about one in four ranking in the top 10 per cent of their graduating classes. (A "prospective applicant" is one who has his other test scores sent to an institution's admissions office.) 
Nationwide, 56 per cent of the prospective applicant to private, four-year colleges and universities were women, while Notre Dame's figure was half that--28 per cent. While 80 per cent of prospective applicants at these same institu­tions last fall were from public schools, NotreDame'sCiass of 1981 had 60 per cent from public schools. 
Notre Dame freshman were also more likely to plan postbaccalaur­eate work than the national average for private institutions, and they were more likely to have participa­ted iJ1 high school varsity athletics, held a major office in a high school student organization and received a high school honor or award. 
The average income for the parents of enrolled Notre Dame freshmen last fall was $32,000, about $11,000 above that for the parents of prospective applicants to private colleges and universities nationwide.

Security changes recommended by audit 
[continued from page 1] _ tinued, the Security Director should take the responsibility for instructing his officers in the techniques of arrest. 
They also said that the designat­ed officers should attend the Indi­ana Law Enforcement Academy for a ten-week basic course given to all law enforcement officers with the powers of arrest. 
In relationship to Security's liai­son with other local law enforce­ment agencies, SAl recommended "the University's General Counsel establish with the corporation ~ounsel of South Bend the prosecu­tor of St. Joseph County, and legal counsel representatives of the St. Joseph County Police Department and the Indiana State Police the clear and definitive lines of juris­diction with respect to police services on campus. 
"With these jurisdictional lines firmly set, the Security Director should then initiate a conference with the head of the St. Joseph County Police Department, the South Bend Police Department and the local commander of the Indiana State Police and liaison arrange­ments perfected and policed and placed in writing which will provide effective police services at this University." 
SAl believes the law enforce­men~ agencies are all friendly with each other, there is presently no real liaison between them as ND Security has referred only four investigations to other police de­partments in the last four years. 
The escort system was one item of Security that the reprot felt was necessary and should be retained as it now exists. They recommend­ed the response to a request be courteously received and promptly made. 
It was found by SAl that ND Security k~pt a "very low profile" around campus. Because they believed that it is difficult to have faith in something that is seldom 


Welfare reform meeting tonight

an evening discussion on President 
Carter's proposed welfare reform 
package tonight at 7:30 p.m. in 
the dining room of the YWCA. The 
YWCA is located at 802 N. Lafay­

and open to the public. 
The guest speaker of the meeting 
will be Judy Rausch, the Welfare 
Reform coordinator with Legal

who will speak on the proposed 
reforms. 
Rausch has also worked with the

seen, SAl recommended "the De­partment's three vehicles be plain­ly and prominently marked as "Security." It is also recommend­ed that the replacements for these vehicles be uniform in make and model. The present vehicles should be equipped with search . lights, if permitted by State law." 
The first impression visitors often receive of Notre Dame is the one they get from the gate keepers, the report stated. The gate guards, the report continued, particularly during the day, should not only have the capacity to make good judgment and be discerning, they should present a positive, vital, visual impression. 

Security provides the service of transporting students in need to local health institutions. Although this is a necessary function, SAl believes that because Security pre­sently has only three cars, "the responsibility for transportation in medical emergencies be removed from the Security Department and placed with the Student Health Center. 
One fault that the students possess, the report stated is the

assaults that were made against Security officers. In 1977 there were seven reports of assaults as well as verbal abuse the Security guards at the gates received from students wishing to bring vehicles on campus. 
SAl believes that Security De­partment officers should not be subjected to discourtesy and abuse from students. Therefore they suggest that ''in duLac, the guide to student life at Notre Dame, a better definition of the Security Department's function should be given." The report suggested that any such abuse be treated in the same manner as an assault on a faculty member. 
In checking into the number of crimes reported in each year, SAl found that the number of bicycle thefts have been declining, larceny has declined from 228 in 1975 to 77 in 1977. In relation to crimes against the person, SAl believes crimes in this area are well within the expected range, considering the population of this community. SAl has come to the conclusion that crime is not rampant on the ND campus.

I am afraid our goal has been reached: the final product has been purified. And the essence of Notre Dume is none other than the essence of alcohol. 

But what is the end-result of this predominant aspect of our univcris­ity experience? To answer this we need two facts of biologv: a) alcohbl 
destroys brain cells and b) each of us has a finite number of brain cells. Now consider all the tail­gaters, section parties. kcggers, birthdays, St. Patrick's Day cele­brations, ad infinitum. What does our drinking and drowning in pursuit of the foxy lady during those interminable happy hours lead to? The conclusion is painfully obvious. The Notre Dame exper­ience, coupled with the biological effects of the imbibation of alcohol, points to a logical. inevitable and very sobering denouement, i.e. the Notre Dame experience reduces a student body of very high intellect­ual potential to the level of morons. 
The situation thus exists. Is there any alternative? I can't think of one. But you see, I am a junior at Notre Dame, or to put it more accurately. I am three-fourths of an idiot. But perhaps the essence is unalterable. So please show no surprise if you should see me in some bar this weekend. And if by chance our eyes should meet as we raise our glasses. do not expect me to say anything more than just "Cheers!"

WASIDNGTON--Hospitals are get­
ting more efficient these days and 
have cut down the time it takes to 
get a bed for you. The reason for 
this is that there is a surplus of 
beds, and in order to survive a 
hospital must keep them full. This 
is good and it's bad. 

I went to visit a sick friend at the 
hospital the other day. I had to go 
to the information booth which also 
handled the admitting procedure. 
Before I could ask what room my friend was in the lady took down my name. age. occupation. filled out a slip and rang a bell. I was just about to tell her I was only visiting a friend when two attendants arrived with a wheelchair. placed me in it and started pushing me down the hall. 
''I'm not sick." I yelled. ''I'm just looking for a friend." 
"When he comes." one attend­ant said, "we'll send him up to your room." 
"He's here already," I pro­tested. "Good. Once we have you in bed he can come up and see you." 
I found myself in a small room ' marked ''Private. Check With Nurse Before Knocking." The attendant stripped me, gave me a weird. short nightgown that tied in the back, a water pitcher and turned on the television set hang­ing from the ceiling. "If you need anything. press the button." 
"I want my clothes back." "Oh, you can trust us." the attendant said. "Even if the worst happens we will see that your widow gets everything." 
I was trying to figure how to escape out the window when D~. Ward came in with several of hts students. 
'Thank heavens you finally 
came," I said. 

"It hurts that bad?" he asked. 
"It doesn't hurt at all," I retorted. 
Dr. Ward looked worried. "If you don't feel any pain that means it's much more serious than we thought. Where did it originally 
hurt?" 
"It didn't hurt anywhere." 
Dr. Ward nodded sympathetic­ally and turned to his students: "This is the toughest kind of patient to handle because he refuses to acknowledge that he is 
ill. He will never be well again until he gets over the delusion that he is in perfectly good health. Since he won't tell us where it hurts we'll have to do exploratory surgery to find out for ourselves." 
"But I don't want an operation." 
Dr. Ward nodded. "No one docs, but wouldn't it be better to get it out now rather than later?" 
"There's nothing to get out! Everything is in order." 
"If it was," said Dr. Ward, writing on a chart. "you wouldn't be here." 
The next morning they shaved all the hair off my chest and refused to give me breakfast. 
Two attendants arrived and placed me on a rolling stretcher. The head nurse walked along beside me. A minister brought up the rear. I looked for help from anywhere. There was no one. 
Finally, I was wheeled into the operating room. "Wait," I said. "I have something to tell you. I'm deathly sick but I HAVE NO MEDICAL INSURANCE! I can't even pay for the anesthesiologist." 
The anesthesiologist turned off the valve on his machine. "And I have no money to pay the doctor," I said. The doctor started to put his instruments away. 
Then I looked at the head nurse. "I can't even pay for the room." 
Before I knew it I was back in my civilian clothes and out on the street, thrown there by the two attendants who had first wheeled me in. 
I went back to ask what room my friend was in but the admitting clerk looked at me coldly and said, "We don't ever want to see you in this hospital again. You're sick."

WHITE SOX OPENING DAY 

TAKE ME OUT TO THE BALL GAME 
by daue gill 
As an American Studies major, I am becoming increasingly aware of the c~ltural trends and fads that run deep and wtde through this country. Fast food chains, backgammon, Steve Martin, Southern Democrats. Some are good but last only a short while; some are bad and seem never to end. There are also those trends that, I hope, will never stop being a part of American society. The United States. as a_ society, celebrates the coming?f spnng wtth a cultural rite that is unique m the world: Opening Day of major league baseball. 
As a consenting member of the Amer­ican society, I deemed it necessary to participate in my culture's spring rites. Throwing caution and grades to the wind, I, along with five other participants, left my Friday classes in the hands of those willing to attend, and made my way to Chicago, where the White Sox and the Boston Red Sox were scheduled to welcome spring. 
The dress for the affair was to be casual, the weather for the day, warm; I dressed accordingly, sparingly, and cursed myself for leaving my sunglasses at home. I dedded my tennis cap would suffice as a sun barrier, and I took a jacket in case the Windy City suffered a cooling breeze. Loaded down with camera, zoom lens, cigarettes, five extra packs of matches, and contact lens supplies (leaving my baseball glove at the last moment), I was ready. 
The drive to Chicago was uneventful, other than that we took a couple of wrong turns; but that was all right, because it was a beautiful day, perfect for Opening Day, and we didn't have any reason to hurry. Even though I have been to countless other major league games, this would be my first Opening Day. and I wasn't quite sure what to expect. I went knowingly, but hesitant­ly. 
We parked the car, edging between two others in an uncomfortably small space, and walked toward the ballpark, quickly merging into the throng of people. As trite as it may sound, there was something in the air; I could see it in the myriad of faces as the crowd maneuvered toward the gates. The people surged at the ticket takers and I enjoyed the moment, seeing the variance of colors and shapes, looking at the different friendly smiles, realizing this was the first and last time I would see any of these people. I indulged in the anonymity. remembering the all-too-soon return to Notre Dame and its familiar sights and sounds. 
When we arrived at our seats, most of the pre-game hoopla had been completed. I quickly took out my camera, switched to the zoom lens, snapped a few pictures, and realized that it would be impossible to take any good shots. For two reasons: one, the sun was glaring straight at us; two, I was tipsy from the ride up and didn't intend to stop drinking beers just so I could have a few black and white remembrances of a baseball game. 
The game itself did not matter. After beginning the game with the habitual "Star Spangled Banner", my friends and I settled back for a day of hot dogs and beer in the newly arrived spring sun. Initially, I cheered for both sides, not caring who won the game, only caring that it would be a good game to go along with the good day. 
Three images of the game remain with me, and one didn't even occur on the playing field. Due to the hot sun, the overflow crowd, and a lack of concession workers, the beer and food lines were unusually long and slow-moving. In fact, the lines moved so slowly, I spent a third of the game under the bleachers, hearing the crowd cheer and boo, waiting in line and listening to a frustrated housewife inform the thirsty hordes that they would not be served until the patrons formed a single, straight line. Luckily, the lady was not serving our line, so we traded jibes with her until she started serving her restless, single-filed customers. 
During the seventh inning stretch, when the home fans normally stand, stretch, and mill about, announcer Harry Caray led us all in a rendition of "Take Me Out to the Ball Game." It was the most enjoyable time during the entire game for me, standing up, looking around at the 50,000 people, and knowing that everyone was having a good time. 
The third image came near the end of the game. The sun had cooled and we sat contentedly slouched in our seats, awaiting the final out. While we watched, I remembered a friend's request for a baseball and, at that instant, the batter swung and sent the ball on a line directly at our section. I jumped up to position myself for an attempt at the ball and, as I jumped, my camera, still hanging around my neck, swung up and back, hitting me in the chest and knocking the wind out of me. The expression on the right fielder's face mirrored my reaction: surprise, pain, and helplessness. Luckily, the ball landed in the stand thirty feet to our left, so I sat down and nursed some air into my stricken lungs. My friend's request went unfilled. 
The game finally ended, the White Sox coming from behind to beat the Red Sox, 6-5. It was an extremely satisfying way to bring in the long-awaited spring. A cloudless day, some good friends, and a pari in America's culture, the welcoming of spnng, opening day at 'Comiskey Park.

Academic Council accepts recommendations 
by Ann Gales News Editor 

The Academic Council yesterday accepted three recommendations for minor revisions of the Academic Manual but rejected three other major revisions recommended by the Faculty Senate. 
By a vote of 33 to 14 the Council turned down a Faculty Senate proposal setting up ad hoc review committees to deal with faculty members turned down for appoint­ment or promotion within the teaching and research faculty b:cause of what they considered inadequate procedures, inadequate criteria or violations of academic freedom. The Academic Manual currently provides a review pro­cedure only if the issue is alleged violation of academic freedom. 
Under the rejected proposal, ad hoc committees consisting of five tenured faculty members of the petitioner's college would investi­gate the case and then deliver "an opinion and rationale to the peti­tioner, his chairman and Depart­mental Committee on Appoint­ments and Promotions, the dean, provost and president." The president would "make a deter­mination of the case and deliver his decision in writing to all of the aforementioned individuals and bodies." 
University President Fr. Theo­dore Hesburgh asked leadership of the Faculty Senate to consult with the executive committee of the Academic Council to see if any mutually_ acceptable formal review

process. can be arrived at. 
The Council also defeated 35 to 6 a Faculty Senate proposal" that would have mandated an election for chairman by a department's faculty. The president would have retained his current right of making the final appointment of chairmen, but if he appointed someone other than the person receiving the majority of votes of the depart­mental faculty he would be required to provide reasons to the department for doing so. 
Among minor Academic Manual revisions approved were two that formalized procedures already widely in use within the University. 
One spelled out the right of a faculty member to be informed if he or she is under consideration for reappointment or promotion so that he or she might submit evidence of use to those making the decision. 
Another insured that reports of committees on appointment and promotion are forwarded to the deans in a form approved by the committees. 
Defeated by voice vote was another Faculty Senate recom­mendation that faculty members retired while on University commit­tees to be allowed to finish their terms. 
A series of proposed guidelines governing th1: relationship of fac­ulty members to the federal government's Central Intelligence Agency(CIA), modeled on those adopted a year ago by Harvard University, were sent to a subcom­mittee of the: Council's executive committee for reaction. Chairing the subcommittee is Dean David T. Link of the Law School, and serving with him are Robert E. Gordon, Vice-president for advanced studies, and Thomas A. Werge, associate professor of English. 
The recommended guidelines state that the University "may enter into research contracts with the CIA provided that such con­tracts conform with Notre Dame's normal rules governing contracting with outside sponsors and that the existence of a contract is made public by University ofticials," and that individual members of the University community may enter into consulting arrangements for the CIA, but must report in writing the existence of such arrangements to the dean and president. 
the CIA should report that fact in writing to the dean of his college and "should not give the CIA the name of another member of the Notre Dame community without the prior consent of that individ­ual;" that members of the Univer­sity community "should not under­take intelligence operations for the CIA;" that "no member of the Notre Dame community should assist the CIA in obtaining the unwitting services of another mem­ber of the Notre Dame com­munity;" and that questions con­cerning the application of these guidelines should be discussed first with the appropriate dean and later with the president or members of his staff, if necessary. 
After the full Council's meeting, Hesburgh asked the elected faculty members of the body to remain for consultation on the selection of a new provost. The faculty commit­tee to advise the president on this matter interviewed eight candi­dates in February and March and recently met with Hesburgh to give him its evaluations. 
The provost is elected by the trustees upon recommendation of the President, and Notre Dame's board has its next regularly sched­uled meeting May 12. 
The guidelines also recommend to-~HI-oCH-.O-~HI-'1 that a member of the ND com­munity serving as a recruiter for

Saying goodbye to an era 
John Havlicek played his last NBA game yesterday. People told me it was an emotional event. Some fans were incensed that CBS cut away from the final three minutes of the game to begin coverage of the Masters. 
Yesterday, David Thompson scored 73 points to seemingly win the NBA scoring title. Yct, last night, George Gervin scored 63 to win the showdown by 8-hundreths of a point. 

Wasn't it funny that on a day when two players combined to scored 136 points, aU one heard about was Havlicek's finale. Now I'm not trying to belittle Havlicek(which I understand is like waving ithe hammer and sickle), but this day certainly says something about the present state of the NBA. 
The first question that popped into my mind was, "Why would CBS even bother to show this game?" After all, such sports greats as Willie Mays, Mickey Mantle, Hank Aaron, Johnny Unitas, Bart Starr and Bill Russell never had farewell games shown coast-to-coast. Although Havlicek was a great player, there were better, and there were players that meant more to their teams(Sorry Bostonians). Add to that fact that, on the last day of the season with the closest playoff races in recent history, CBS was showing a game between two teams with a combined total of 104 losses and I was stumped. 
But then I thought about the way the NBA has deteriorated in recent years. I'm sure papers across the country have written up the NBA for their "Obituary" file. A large number of sports fans don't care anymore. Where is the red, white and blue ball and the three-pointer? 
And then I realized why there was the hoopla surronding Hondo's goodbye. John Havlicek is unique. He stands alone as the last link to the NBA when it was interesting and exciting. When players required more ability than jumping and foul shooting, and when players weren't millionaires. When egos were sacrificed for the sake of winning and when each team was a team. 
Those days were the beginning of the NBA's successful years. Shortly. the league would expand from 10 to 18 teams and most arenas would fill frequently. Despite having one team exert total domination over the league, the NBA flourished and prospered. 
~ut with the nagging nemesis, the ABA, hanging tough in its persistent ha. le to unify professional basketball, the NBA slowed. Quickly, anyone over ·-6 was earning a six-figure contract. Team play and the fundan ·tals of the game were thrown away for exciting individual talent. 
What the. '~BA is learning now is that the sports fan knows more than owners givt. e m credit for. The novelty of Julius Erving is wearing thin, If the NBA hierarchy doesn't realize this, then I think the fans do. 
and  the  fan~  t1t  players  who  use  more  than  their  instincts  and  
God-given abilit}   basketball purists are returning to the time w hen  
they would rather  hack-door play than a slam dunk.  

That's why John Havlicek was given 22 farewell salutes and a 
coast-to-coast finale. John Havlicek represents everything the NBA used 
to be, and no longer is. John Havlicek represents what the fans want the 
NBA to return to. John Havlicek represents what the NBA should revert 
to in its best interests. 
All of Hondo's peers are gone. Oscar Robertson, Jerry West, Elgin 
Baylor, BiJJ Russell, Sam Jones, Bob Pettit, BiJJy Cunningham, Dave 
DeBusschere, Hal Greer and Willis Reed are names of people who are 
what John Havlicek now solely stands for -the true game of professional 
basketball. 
The attendance figures show that the present game is a mere facsimile 
of basketball. Portland, Philadelphia, San Antonio, Denver and Seattle 
are the only teams that regularly fill their arenas, and the Sixers, playing 
in a traditional basketball hotbed, only began selling seats when a guy 
named Erving qecided he'd like to play in Philly. 
Despite having good teams, New York, Washington, Cleveland, Milwaukee, Los Angeles and Golden State all have attendance problems. In New York, where the Knicks packed 20,000 fans into Madison Square Garden for every game a scant five years ago, the Knicks averaged 14,000 this year with a playoff team. 
And the financial pinch has set in. Why else would Kenny Charles, a three-year starter good enough to play on most NBA teams, find himself out on the street earlier this year with no takers. The answer is a $125,000 salary. How many teams will actively pursue Brian Taylor, one of the better guards in the league, who jumped Denver in January as a free agent? Taylor will find out how many owners want a guard for $250,000. 
The NBA owners will soon find out that the middle-class workingman will now longer shell out ten dollars a ticket to watch professional basketball. The reasons are unsure. Many sociologists and former NBA player StaP Lonve have written that an inherent racial discrimination is the underlying reasnn. This argument has merit as I discovered two summers ago trying to convince Long Islanders that a season ticket to the New York Nets games was a good but. Businessmen are very aware of the large racial imbalance in the sport (this year, 68 of the 242 NBA players are white, or 28 percent), 
So, at Boston Garden yesterday, the fans were not only saluting John Havlicek, but they were saluting a game that is gone. It is rare. that one person can outlast an era, but John Havlicek did. For that feat alone, he deserved the accolades he received. But, I'm sure the old NBA was part of those cheers, and maybe if enough people cheer, all the Howard Komives of yesterday will return.

"What I think we have to realize 
is that we have a different ballclub 
here. The players are younger, 
more closely knit, and they're 
fighting for positions. We've 
worked hard and grown very 
close," commented Pullano, who 
himself has worked toward such 
unity, and noticed a lack of it in 
years past. 
"Last year, the team was senior 
dominated," theorized Pullano, 
"and almost all of the players were 
secure in their positions. What's 
going to motivate a second 
semester senior in a situation like 
that?" 

"This year," Pullano continued, "We're developing our own ident­ity. our own character. We've developed our own wiiming ways and attitudes. We're a team, not just a collection of individuals." 
"We look at ourselves honest­ly." claims Pullano, "We are a steady ballclub, but when we win, we're going to have to outhustle our opponents, be more aggressive and play with more confidence --and that's the key factor. Confidence has to be shown on the Rick's father drops his cigarette ball field...you just can't play lip and smiles. service to it." Pullano is smiling again, too, as

A mediator between the team and the coach, Pullano sees a lot of Kelly. and Kelly puts much faith in his captain. After all, he certainly couldn't have found anyone with more talent or enthusiasm for the game of baseball.

related Pullano. "I know we will play well this year. and my biggest thrill is just trying to make that contribution. I take it personally." 
Pullano is the last one to leave the field. Kelly calls him over to 
the dugout for instructions for the 
next day. Pullano is all smiles, enjoying the win, and the task ahead of the team. The extra hours and worry arc just a part of the job. When he takes the "number one" off of his back. his captaincy doesn't go into the locker with it. To him it's a twenty-four hour job, a job that's constantly on his mind. 
And Rick Pullano wouldn't have it ary other way. 
Bookstore tourney to begin April 18 
Bookstore Basketball will begin next Tuesday, rather than this week, as previously announced. 
Schedules may be picked up by the team captains at Pangborn Hall, room 140, between 2 and 5 this Saturday and 7 and 12 this Sunday. 
"I think it's going to be very competitive this year," commented Tournament Commissioner Leo Latz, "Dave 'Batton's team has Willie Frye and Mike Miller, and they should he one of the favorites. Kelly Tripucka, Orlando Woolr .dgt: and Stan Wilcox all should have strong teams, also." 
"And then there's Bill Laim­beer's and Bruce Flower's teams," added Latz, "They should prove worthy competition as well." 
"I guess the campus has An Tostal fever." said Latz, "The spots for the tournament filled up extremely fast, and it looks to be an interesting event."
