one of the poorest election turn­out in Student Union history. 
The two most important candidates for Sophomore Presi­dertt were Steve Palucca, known intimately as "Pumpkin", and Mike Ruffer. Palu~.:ca ran on a slate with Rich Richea, Gary Little and Kevin Muse, and the entire ensem hie was directed by (lary Caruso, Campaign Manager (and part-time Stooge). Speaking of his campaign, Paluc~.:a recalls, "It started out as a practical joke; then it turned into an a hsurd joke; then it wasn't cvc1: a joke anymore and now, well l d~n't wanna even talk about it.'' 
Running on a ticket to abolish Class Government were Vlark Lawrence and John Hession. Other candidates included Mike M·~nez, .Jeff Lobosky and Bud Carpenter for President and Steve Mlinac, Rick Kuenster and 
Bill McCarthy for Veep.

Palucca beat Ruffer, his closest competitor, by 4 7 votes. All of Palucca's ticket rode to victory on Steve's X-large coattails ex­cept for his Vice Presidential candidate, Richea. John He:ssion was victoriaous there. 
But there was an apparent

were not enough. Also there had been a mix-up in the Class of '72. A box load of late votes, from where else but Flanner, turned a one vote victory into a one vote defeat for the Vice­Presidency. 
A major meeting was held in the basement of Breen-Phillips hall to correct the mishaps, and was wnducted by Senior Class President James D'Auora. It was decided to leave things as they were and declare the elections valid. Then Vice President for Student Affairs Father Charles L M cCarragher also felt that to avoid an unneeded hassle the elections should be left as official. 
Palucca contacted Hession and asked whether or not he wanted to remain in the govern-

ment as the V.P. Feeling that Hession would be hipocritical if he took the office, Palucca encouraged Hession to "abolish'' himself. But Hession felt that the matter needed more thought and he postponed his decision. The matter was never settled last year and over the summer Caruso, now the Executive Co-ordinator of the Class, had the letter heads printed up and exduded Hession's name. Mean­while Palucca was busy appoint­ing ;ther mem hers to his new regime. Loser Richea was named as Social Affairs Co-ordinator and loser Mike Ruffer was named as the Executive Secre­tary as well as the appointment of Caruso. Richea, also known to many as "Cretin", failed to retain his scholarship and is now 
attending  a college in Ohio.  As  
Caruso  says,  "He's  sort  of  
coordinating out there."  
This year Hession  finally  let  

Palucca know that he figured Father McCarragher had thrown him out and that he could not fulfill his responsibilities as vice president. 
So ends the terrible and sad story of Pumpkin and Cretin and America and du Lac and how class government maybe should have been abolished. Yes, it all started out as a practical joke ..

Funds requested by MECHA 
By Don Capshaw 
Last Thursday afternoon, 
an organization representing 
the Mexican-Amnican Student 
Movement of the Southwest 
went before the Finance Com­
mittee of the Notre Dame Stu­
dent Government for an appro­
priation of funds. 
MECliA, a Spanish acronym for the Mexican-American Stu­dent Movement and title of the organization, is comprised of approximately 25 students. Armando Alonzo, head of MECHA, went to the Finance Committee in an attempt to the $ I 025 appropriated for this minority movement. "I found there was a centain amount of interest in our movement," said Armando. "But the Committee said they would not be able to give me a definite answer for ~pprozimately a week." How­ever, Armando feels that the money will be granted in view of the fact that other minority groups have been successful in recent years. 
"We feel the Mexican-Ameri­
can has been neglected on cam­
pus and that it is time this was 
changed," Armando stated. He 
said that MECHA had a two-fold 
purpose: (I) To provide infor­
mation for Mexican-American 
students on campus ( 2) To help 
increase enrollment of the 
Mexican-American students in 
future years. 
"The main problem thus far," said Armando, "is to differen­tiate our needs from other minority groups on campus." He believes if MECHA can become a distinctive organization, the stu­dent body will become

The two week kidnap crisis brought declaration of all out war against the FLQ by Lime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau. He invoked extraordinary legisla­tion sanctioning sweeping police powers of search, seizure and arrest, and said "the guns pointed at the heads of these men have FLQ fingers on the triggers." 
Trudeau yesterday expressed the "shock and consternation that all Canadians must feel as they learn of the death of Pierre Laporte, who was so cowardly assassinated by a band of mur­derers." 
Armed with emergency powers-giving police the right to arrest without charge, hold without bail and search without warrant-the government rounded up more than 2SO suspected separatists sympathizers. The Emergency Act, suspending civil liberties, had never before been invoked in peacetime.

If appropriations come ihrough, MECHA will establish an office on campus for students intt{rested in working for this movement. Armando added that MECHA has employed the ser­vices of two advisors, Dr. Arthur Rubel and Dr. Julian Samona, experts in the fields of Anthro­pology and Sociology, respec­tively. He wished to thank these two men publicly for their t re men do us· contributions in getting the Mexican-American Student Movement on campus, off the ground. 
Fellows chosen 
The Rev. James T. Burtchaell, C.S.C., provost, and the Rev. Thomas E. Blantz, C.S.C., vice president for student affairs, have been formally elected Uni­versity of Notre Dame Fellows and trustees. Father Burtchaell's election as a fellow and trustee was ex-officio. Father Blantz was elected a fellow to fill out the term of the Rev. Charles I. McCarragher, C.S.C., former vice president of student affairs, whose resignation as a Fellow and a trustee was accepted with commendation. 
The 12 Fellows, divided equally between Jay persons and members of the Congregation of Holy Cross, have certain basic powers including those to elect trustees, to adopt and amend the statutes and bylaws of the University and to approve the transfer of a substantial portion of the University's physical pro­perties. All other powers of governance have been delegated by the Fellows to the board of trustees, which currently has a membership of 34 lay persons and seven Holy Cross priests.
