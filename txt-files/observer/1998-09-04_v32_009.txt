ROAD TO THE 
NOTRE DAME VS. MICHIGAN 

'88 CHAMPIONSHIP 
Ho's heroics send Irish off on the right foot 
By JOE CAVATO Associate Sports Editor 
Opening night. 
A primetime match-up against Michigan. The stage was set. The entire season possibly hinged on 
the outcome. Of course, no one knew that then. 
Least of all Reggie Ho. 
That game took place back on Sept. 10, 1988, and a walk-on place kicker played hero. I-Io set an Irish record with four field goals en route to a 19-17 win over Michigan, beginning the National Championship season of 1988. 
After the graduation of Notre Dame's seventh Heisman Trophy winner, Tim Brown, and a poor showing in the 1988 Cotton Bowl, the thriller pointed the pro­gram into the right direction, and announced that Notre Dame was back. 
When sophomore Ricky Watters did his best imitation of the departed Brown -a thrilling 81-yard punt return for a touch­down to open the scoring-the Irish did­n't look back. The win over No. 10 Michigan vaulted Notre Dame into the top 10 and began a 23-game winning streak, the longest in Irish history. 
Third year skipper Lou Holtz's team jumped out to a 13-0 second quarter lead behind Watters nifty running and two field goals from the five-foot-five, 135­pound Reggie Ho, but the future Big Ten and Rose Bowl champs proved their worth. 
Bo Schembechler's power running attack could only be kept out of the end­zone by Frank Starns, Chris Zorich, Jeff Alm, and linebacker Mike Stonebreaker who was all over the field with 19 tackles. 
The Wolverines got on the scoreboard in the second quarter and took advantage of a fumbled punt by Watters' on his own 
14. The teams switched ends to start the fourth quarter with the visitors on the better side of a 14-13 mark. 
Then the game was handed over to the little men, and the Irish had the best lit­tle man that day. The Wolverines had Mike Gillette, their all-time leading field goal. 
The hopes of the Irish faithful fell on the shoulders of a walk-on pre-med. major who joined the football team because he "didn't want to be a geek." Ho's only experience in kicking in college was with the Cavanaugh inter-hall foot­ball team. He did not try out until his senior year because he wanted to con­centrate on academics. 
"I thought I was going to flunk out of school," Ho said after the game. 
Ho nailed a 26-yard field goal and Gillette answered with a 49 yarder giving Ho and the '88 team a date with destiny. 
Quarterback Tony Rice engineered a classic Rice drive that brought the Irish to the Wolverine seven and a 26-yard field goal attempt with a little over a minute to play. 
While you won't find any one teaching young place-kickers Ho's unorthodox style, his consistency and work ethic is what put him in position to tie John Carney's record of four field goals in a game. 
"Reggie always makes those," Holtz said. "I told him that it was just like prac­tice and not to make it bigger than it real­ly was." 
"He (Holtz) said, 'Get out there and kick it.' It was daunting from" the standpoint that it was my first game. Which only added to the excitement," Ho said. "But I have the best holder in the world in Pete Graham and the best snapper in the world in Tim Grunhard and 280-pound guys on the line. Nobody was going to hit me, so I wasn't too nervous." 

He certainly wasn't, drilling one of the most important kicks in Notre Dame's illustrious history. 
"I think about it almost every day," Ho said. 
Ho's heroics did not end that class bat­tle in fall of '88 as Gillette and Michigan had one last chance. The Wolverines marched to the Irish 28-yard line and their hopes rested on Gillette's leg, which had been so reliable throughout his career. 
· Michigan's hopes faded off wide right and the Notre Dame student section erupted. 
"All I do is kick the ball, just like prac­tice," Ho said in 1988. "I wasn't responsi­ble for the win. The whole team was responsible." 
The kind of attitude that prevailed in those words spoken by Ho, sum up what the 1988 team was all about. Twenty-two of the 24 starters from the '88 squad were selected in the NFL draft which made competition for playing time fierce., but that did not upset team chem­istry, it enhanced it. 
"We had a lot of players who believed in Notre Dame and decided that they wanted to let the program be bigger than each of us," tri-captain Ned Bolcar recol­lected. 

"It was the most fun I've ever had play­ing football in my life," Michigan's Starns said about his senior campaign ten years ago. "I started playing when I was eight and stopped when I was 31. That was the greatest group of guys ever-players, · coaching staff, trainers, equipment peo­ple."

lNSlGHTS FROM 
THE WOLVERINE



IRISH EXCHANGE 
MAGAZINE FOR MICHIGAN SPORTS 
By JOHN BORTON 
EJiwr, Tht Wolvaint 
Not so very long ago, Notre Dame fans nxhibitod an inordinate amount of swag­gnr entoring their Loam's now quasi-annu­al matr.hups against Miehigan. Worse yet for U-M fans. the Irish arrogance appeared justified. 
Jintnring the 1991 game, Notre Dame had won four straight in the series, and many Irish fans viewPd Michigan as mere­ly another pretmulnr to the throne of eol­legn football's South Bond-based king. Suro, the Wolverines Jed the all-time series, they sneen~d -based almost whol­ly on an H-0 start from 1887 to 1908. 
Sinell tho modern-day resumption of the snriPs in 1978, th11 Irish had rung up seven wins against four losses, including the four consneutivn victories. U-M fans drew eold ~~omfort from the narrowness of thrne of tlw losses (19-17, 24-19 and 28-24), but ehmrly wern desperate for a win. 
Dnsmond Howard's diving TD reecption on a fourth-and-inches Elvis Grbae bomb -arguably the greatest touchdown eateh in U-M football history-turned the tide in the 1 991 thriller. Michigan's 24-14 win not only put a stop to the maddening Notre Damn win streak ovnr the Wolverines, it triggornd a 3-1-1 U-M advantage over the past live meetings. 
Tim WolV!lrinos' recent spate of success includos two straight intestine-twisters. Horny Hamilton's 42-yard. last-minute lintel goal provnd the game winner in Michigan's 26-24 victory in 1994, and the U-M dnfnnsn thriee blunted the Irish fol­lowing fourth-quarter Mil'higan turnovers in thn Wolverines' 21-14 triumph last year. 
Notrn Dame couldn't stop shaking down the blunders from on high in Bob Davie's Jirst season as head coach. Irish fans will staggor, rather than swagger, to their seats in the revamped 80,000-seat Notre Dame Stadium Sept. 5 due to vastly divergent 1997 seasons by the key eombatants. 
According to one South Bend-based writor, the feeling around the Golden Domn isn't all gloom and doom. In fact, some am quietly viewing Notre Dame in a similar position to that of Michigan prior to the 1997 season -coming on a series of sub-sensational years with a neophyte head coach under heavy scrutiny. 
You get the parallel. however much wishful thinking it might be on the part of the Irish. 
Michigan players, meanwhile, probably won't be either cocky of overly awed at the prospect of invading South Bend. Only one Wolverine on the 1998 roster -quarter­back Scott Dreisbach -has been to Notre Dame in a Michigan uniform, and his memories arn deliriously happy. 
Dmisbac:h made the traveling squad to South Bend his freshman season, although he didn't play. While his classmates ner­vously gathorcd around television sets it. That's why you come to Michigan." 
Sword added: "I haven't been inside that stadium. As a high school senior, as I signed that letter (of intent to Michigan), that's one of the things I thought of the most. It's taken me live years to go play at Notre Dame. I'm really looking forward to it. 
''I've heard about the stadium, the fans, Touchdown Jesus -I don't think any of those things are going to be factors in that game. The game is going to be decided on the field." 
The last sentiment gets full concurrence from Carr, who insists Michigan won't be cowed by any crowd. Although his Wolverines haven't stared down Touchdown Jesus in person. Carr's troops

Four years and numerous twists of for­tune later, Dreisbach and his classmate get to create a new memory. Few tried to downplay the importance of the opportu­nity. 
''I'm excited about it," enthused senior safety Marcus Ray. "I was in a dorm watching the 1994 game with Sam (Sword) and a bunch of other guys that got redshirted that year.

They don't know what defending exten­sive option football is like, providing the U­M coaching stall' a much more palpable concern. Wisconsin ran some option last year, experiencing more success than most teams against the nation's best defense. 
Carr also grumbled about his team's efforts against the option early in fall prac­tice. The anticipated Irish option, to be directed by new quarterback Jarious Jackson, was tough to simulate. Dreisbach played the role of Jackson in practice, but deciding what to expect and nailing down assignments could prove problematic. 
· "There are a lot of ways to run the option," Carr said. "There's the double

option, tho triple option -we're not suro which of those options they're going to foa­ture. Some of our adjustments an~ going to have to be made on game day. 
"We know their p11rsonnel, and we try to decide on a couple things they're probably going to feature. We'll work hard on those. lfwe guess right, we'rn faced with the task of defending it on tho field and stopping it. 
"If we get into that game and they'rn doing some things we havnn't anticipatPd, then you have to make adjustments on the field. That's always tough to do." 
By the same token he noted Michigan will throw some now wrinkles at the Irish. In the end, Carr predicted, the game will come down in the traditional fourth-quar­ter light for survival, with one team or the other making the huge plays to pull out a close win. 
Such was the case last year even though Michigan came into the contest heavily favored. Notre Dame put together a game­shortening, ball-control package, which would have engineer1)d an upset had it not boon for U-M's late defensive heroics. 
"They were 1-2, but it didn't mattor," Ray said. "Throw the records out the win­dow, Michigan vs. Notre Damn -you're going to come out and run, but we'rn got to be ready to stop it. 
"They're going to be fired up at home. and we're going into a hostile environ­

-ment. We're on the road for our first game, new quarterbaek, new defense. It's going to be a groat game." Before long, it eould have bneornn a f,rrcat Big Ten game, Carr joined sevnral eonfenmce coaches in speaking .anything but dismissively about the prospects of the Irish providing the Big Ten's 12th team. "It makes sense that Notrn Dame would want to join the Big Ten," Carr said. "If they come in, it's a good move for them. I think it would be a good move for tho Big Ten. ·If they do or if they don't, two hugn and fiercely proud alumni and fan bases will continue to think they hold the preeminent tradition in college football history.

THE EDGE 
Quarterbacks -Even 

Both Brady and Jackson present the Wolverines and Irish with unproven signal callers. Jackson has thrown twice as many passes (40), and was able to test the 
waters in each of the season's final six games, but has 
never faced a defense quite like Michigan's. 
Thomas and Williams pack a tough one-two punch 
for the Big Blue, but taking the pressure off Brady 
may be too much to handle. Denson is poised for a 
run at the Irish rushing record, while Levy and 
freshmen Fisher and Howard are waiting in the wings.

Offensive Line-UM 

Defensive Line-UM 

Injuries have taken a toll on the Irish, who will start a freshman to take the pressure off a recovering Bryant. 
Although the Wolverines lost their top pass rusher, 
experience abounds on the line for last year's top-ranked 
defensive unit. 

With three Butkus Award candidates, the Irish have plenty of talent, but Minor's recent ankle sprain may be a factor. The Maize and Blue are deep, led by Sword, whose 91 tackles in '97 led the team. 
Woodson's departure put a dent in the Wolverine defense, but it wasn't a one-man show that set an NCAA record with 8.8 yards allowed per reception. The Irish safeties have only improved with the addition of Driver, and Harper has been one of the biggest surprises of fall camp at corner. 
Kicking is the biggest question mark for NO, and in a tight game, is the most important. Smith is solid as usual, but the return game is unproven with the loss of Rossum. 

Carr is finally off the hot seat, and Davie has spent all summer on it. Until Davie can erase the memories with Ws, nothing will change. 
The Wolverines, after all, are the defending national co-champs.

By KATHLEEN LOPEZ Sports Editor 
The countdown to greatness has begun for Jarious Jackson. 
In fact, it began when former Notre Dame quarterback Ron Powlus walked ofT the field at the end of 1997 football season. 
Tomorrow, Jackson will fol­low in line with many greats. With a victo­ry over t h e 
Wolverines of Michigan, he could become 
the eighth straight quarterback at Notre 
Dame to win his first start. Jackson has always been a contributor but never the primary player. He has gone from the shadows to the spotlight and with that move he takes on a tremendous amount of pressure. Yet he shows no out­
ward signs of jitters. 
"He's unaffected by it [pressure]," Iavie said. "I promise you that. I'm just > anxious to watch Jarious play, as 
'm sure all of you are." 
"Jarious is the type of person that oves pressure situations," senior Bobby Brown said. "He just shines 
in those positions. That's just the type of guy he is." Coming face-to-face with the nation's top 
ranked defense is far from fun but he maintains that, 
despite all the hype, 
he will go about his standard warm-up, his usual pre-game rit­ual, (listening to 
music,) and all the other standard prac­tices. 
''I'm just going to let the adrenaline get me ready for the game," Jackson said about 
Saturday. 
"Jarious can handle pressure situations because he is a natur­al leader," fifth-year senior Malcolm Johnson said. "I am 
excited to play with him. I am looking for­ward to it." 
Jackson realizes that despite the fact that he is not a captain, he still plays a major 
leadership role. 
"I just go out there and try to lead by example," Jackson said. "You know I try by practicing hard, play­ing hard or whatever. I'm vocal at times in the huddle when I think we could do better than we are doing. Other than that they may look at me as a 
leader or they make look at me as someone that works hard." 
He did not enter the game of football with his eyes affixed on his current sta­tus. In fact, he started his career on the other side of the ball. Jackson got his start back in sev­enth grade as full­back and line­
backer. 
"Ninth grade, that's the first time I started playing quarterback," Jackson said. "And I have been playing quar­terback since then." 


The quarterback quickly attained numer­ous honors at Tupelo High School in Tupelo, Miss. In his senior year Bluechip Illustrated ranked him sixth best nationally among quar­terbacks and SuperPrep ranked him lOth. Jackson also found him­self a honorable mention pick by USA Today. 
Besides captaining the football team, he earned two varsity letters in track and another letter in basketball. 
Initially Notre Dame was not Jackson's top choice. Prior to his visit to Notre Dame, Tennessee appeared to be his number one pick. The visit is what sold him. 
"It was just different," The Observer/Brandon Candura Jackson said. "It felt like Jackson will finally get to showcase his leadership abilities as home when I first came ·he makes his first start this Saturday.

The Observer/Brandon Candura 
Josh Williams provides the anchor in a domi· nant Woverine defensive front. 
Coach Carr's 'big uglies' may be the 
strength of tho squad and Davie's main 
concern is the development of the defen­
sive line that gave up 184.5 yards rushing 
per game last year. That could mean a 
long day for the Irish. 
Lance Legree, Brad Williams and the 
others upfront have gotten bigger from 
Mickey Marotti's aggressive off-season 
weight program. 
Defensive coordinator GrBg Mattison 
has vowed that this year's unit will be bet­
ter. We'll find out tomorrow

The Observer/Brandon Candura The Irish will need defensive end Brad Williams to pick up his play this season. 
On the other side of the ball, the experi­enced offensive line of the Irish has their chance to shine. Rosenthal, Wisne and Co. could give their defensive counterparts a lift by sustaining drives. 
That task won't be easy against a Wolverine defense that finished seventh nationally last year against the run and returns intact. But the Irish have an added dimension with the option attack. 
Keep an eye on Michigan's sack leader from a year ago Josh Williams and tri­captain Mike Hosenthal. It'll be a doozy.

Can Davie's boys rekindle the past magic of Holtz? 

In 1988, his third season as coach, Lou Holtz brought Notre Dame to the top of the' national college football world. 
ALLISON KRILLA 
Associate Sports Editor 

They say that history repeats itself. Although that's probably an understatement in the sports world. 
Consider Lou Gehrig's Major League Baseball consec­utive games played mark -the record that would never be broken. Cal Ripken, the "Iron Man" did indeed bre-ak the "Iron Horse's" record in heroic fashion. And as Big Mac and Sammy Sosa chase Roger Maris' home run record, it's modern deja vu. 
The feeling is no different for Irish fans on this 10 year reunion for the Class of '88-yes. the undefeated national championship season. Not only does the Notre Dame-Michigan rivalry teem with tradition, but the '88 contest itself screams "remember me!" 
Third-year coach Lou Holtz led the 13th-ranked Irish into Notre Dame Stadium to face the No. 9 Wolverines with the usual lofty expectations firmly strapped to their backs and the bitter taste of a 35-10 Cotton Bowl loss still lingering in the mouths of Irish faithful. 
And that time Notre Dame emerged victorious in a 19-17 thriller that signaled the magic to come. 
Everything fell into place. 

Reggie I-Io's right foot was just strong enough, while Mike Gillette's was not. Ricky Watters was just elusive enough. And Notre Dame's defense staved off Bo Schembechler's crew to begin a dream season no one could forget. 
Now back to the task at hand-the 1998 squad and second-year skipper Bob Davie. A team with talent, desire, experience and question marks, heads into tomorrow's game with the usual lofty expectations firm­ly strapped to its back, in the wake of a 27-9 Independence Bowl defeat at the hands of LSU, and an off-season of courtroom drama fit for daytime TV. Not to mention that the Wolverines are the defending national co-champs. The odds appear to be stacked p~etty high against the Irish. 
Of course there's a song for just this occassion? 
... What though the odds be great or small 
Old Notre Dame will win over all ... 

What's that they say about history repeating itself?

OSU opens with mountain to climb 
No. 1 Buckeyes begin '98 campaign with test in Morgantown 
By TIM CASEY 
~pons Writer 
No. 1 Ohio State at No. 11 West Virginia 

Pro-season No. I ranked Ohio State does not havn to search far for their first pote~­tial roadblor.k as they take on an experi­enced West Virginia squad in Saturday's opener. For the first timn since 1980, Jo~n Coopnr's Buckeyes open the season with tho top spot. The two teams have not met since the 1987 season when the Buckeyes scorod 1 7 first quartnr points and held on for a 24-3 victory over the Mountaineers. 
Ohio State possnssns one of the most potent oll'ensiv~>. attacks. i~ the n~tion, led by arguably thn top rer.mvmg duo m college football. Doe Miller and David Boston. Boston had a trmnendous season last yea.r, making an OSU rneord 73 receptions. lie IS only 63 rneeptions and 7 toucl~do.wn.s sho~t of brnaking former standout Chns Carters earner marks. Miller is a senior spnedster who caught 58 passes in 1997 for .five touchdowns. Throwing the ball to the wide­outs this year is another familiar faye, Joe Gnrmam1, who split time last year With now departed Stanley Jackson. Gerl!lane l!n­ished thn yoar third in the nation m passm.g eflieinncy. Loading the charge on defenso IS the bost dnfensive player in college football, middlo linnbackor Andy Katzenmoyer. Last year's Butkus Award winner for the nation's top linebacker, Katzenmoyer h~s had an eventful ofT-season with academic troubles. On tho field, however, there's not a morn feared player in the country. 
Wnst Virginia looks to rnbound from an up and down '97 eam~aign which saw the Mountaineers start oil the season at 6-1, but won only one of thnir nex.t five games. The Big East's top team returns 15 starters and featurnd what many consider to be one of thn top fivn backs in the country, Amos Znreoue. Zereoue gained 1,589 yards last year as a sophomore and was third in the nation in yards per game. Quarterback Mare Bulger returns after starting all _12 games last year, and possesses a qmck rnlcase to get the ball to wide-outs Shawn Foreman and David Saunders. Saunders was sidelined all of last year to recover from knee surgery, while Foreman had a brnakout year with a Mountaineer .record 77 catehes. Three first-team all-Big East performers spearhead the defen~e, includ­ing nose !-,'Uard John Thornto~. hne~aeker Gary Stills and defensive back Nate lerry. 
This will be the toughest road game for the Buckeyes as they travel to Mo.rgantown. Both Michigan and Penn State will be trav­eling to Columbus, so if the Bueke~es ean pass this hurdle on Saturday, they WI~I have taken a big step to the Fiesta Bowl lor the national championship game.

No. 10 Tennessee at No. 17 Syracuse 
The post-Peyton Manning years at Tennessee start with a bang on Saturday as the Volunteers travel to the Carrier Dome to take on the explosive Orangemen and senior quarterback Donovan McN~bb. l:he offenses for both teams are potentially high scoring, while the inexperience on defense will lead to an interesting game. 
Tennessee, the defending SEC champi­ons looks to Tee Martin to replace the four­yea~ starter and last year's Heisman run­ner-up Manning. Martin showed flashes of brilliance last year, especially in the Orange Bowl against Nebraska where he l~d the Volunteers 80 yards in eight plays m the waning moments of the game. ~owever, he is very inexperienced and Will have ~o adjust to big-time college footbal~. He Will have plenty of weapons to work With, espe­cially at the skill positions, led by . sopho­more running back Jamal Lewis and returning receivers Peerless Price and Jeremaine Copeland. Lewis racked up an impressive 1,364 yar?s last yea~ as a fre~h­man, good for sixth m NCAA history.. P~Ice and Copeland both had solid seasons m 97. with Price averaging 15 yards a catch and Copeland recording 58 receptions. Linebacker Al Wilson is a Butkus Award candidate who is the leading returning tackler on the team. 
For the past four seasons, Syracuse oppo­nents have had nightmares trying to stop the Orangemen's all-purpose. quart.erback Donovan McNabb. The two-time Big East player of the year .combine~ exception~! speed with a professiOnal cahb~r-arm, evi­denced by his 2,488 yards passmg and 404 yards rushing in '97 along with 26 total touchdowns. Any good quarterback must have players to throw to and McNabb is no exception. Receivers Quinton Spotwood and Kevin Johnson will be heavily count~d on as will fullback Rob Konrad and tail­ba~k Kyle Mcintosh. The real question will be on defense where Syracuse needs to replace seven starters, including Tebucky Jones and Donovin Darius, who were NFL first-round picks. 
Both teams have tough schedules to begin their year. The Volunteers h~ve ~ext week off before taking on thmr nval Florida, against whom they are 2-6 in the '90s while the Orangemen travel to Ann Arb~r next week to battle defending national champion Michigan. 

No. 18 Washington at No. 8 Arizona State 
It is only the first game of the season for both teams, but the inside track for. the Pac-10 regular season title may .be decided in Saturday's game between Anzona State and Washington. Both teams are ranked high in the preseason because of .t~eir experience at the quarterback position. Washington's junior q':larterback. Brock Huard follows in a long hne of Huskies star · quarterbacks, including current NFL play­ers Warren Moon, Chris Chandler and Mark Brunell. Huard· passed for 2,140 yards and 23 touchdowns last year and expects to throw an average forty times a game, compared with only 24 attempts per game last year. Sophomore Ryan Ke~ly leads the Sun Devils again after postmg ASU's freshman records for completions, touchdowns and yards. He was named first team freshman All-American by the Sporting News. 
The Huskies must replaee 10 players drafted by the NFL last year and all the skill position players from last year graduated except for Huard. Sp~it end. ~a'Warren Hooker will be the mam recelVIng threat. Last year. Hooker, who is also the 1998 NCAA indoor champion in the 55 meters, only touched the ball eight times, but four of those were for touchdowns. Washington's defense will be anchored by a defensive line which averages 6-foot-6 and 305 pounds and also returns two lineback­ers and two defensive backs from a year ago. 
Besides Kealy, the Sun Devils return Heisman candidate J.R. Redmond, who has played tailback, wide receiv.er and defen­sive back while also returmng punts and kicks. Last year's Pac-1 0 lead~r in a~l pur­pose yardage will be a full-time tailback, where he has averaged 5.6 yards per carry in his career. Receiver Lenzie Jackson leads a core of four seniors who rank as one of the best in the country. Jackson caught 53 balls in '97 along with five touchdowns. First Team All-Pac-10 performer Mitchell Freedman spearheads the defense from his free safety position. 
Washington is very inexperienced on offense and will rely heavily on Huard to lead the charge. If Huard leads them past Arizona State and Nebraska on September 26, the 6-foot-5 lefty will certainly be the front-runner for the Heisman trophy.

Your first or 
last game day 
There is a certain feeling that hits you when you wake up on game day at Notre Dame. Although you are not among those who will take the field in battle this day, you still feel like your mis-Mike Revers sion is to crush the 
Asst. Systems Manager 
opponent. 
You awake early to 
the sound of the marching band playing the 
fight song, in a glorious blend of music and 
school spirit. When you walk to the mirror, 
you suit up in your uniform:"The Shirt." 
Outside, there is a strange calm about the 
campus. A layer of dew still blankets the 
grass, and the air carries a slight chill. Stop 
and take it all in, without missing any details. 
They will all fuel your excitement. 
Just as you survey all of your surroundings, 
the ever-present smell of grilled food catches 
your attention. It leads you to South Quad, 
where vendors galore serve up hot dogs, 
hamburgers, and steak sandwiches to cheer­
ing Irish fans. Many of them are alumni, 
inviting you to join them as they reminisce 
about their time here at ND. You see both 
new families and established ones, from 
older alumni in those infamous plaid pants to 
the toddlers in mini-cheerleader uniforms. 
On the way to yout seat, you peer out over 
the field as you step out of that little tunnel 
and into the stands. For many, it is a familiar 
trip, but for a few it is their first time. Either 
way, you still feel that tingle in your skin as 
your heart starts racing and your reactions 
heighten. Then you get that indescribable 
feeling in your chest that tells you: WE WILL 
WIN! 
You watch as the band marches out of the 
tunnel playing Hike Notre Dame, and you 
begin to cheer loudly. Then you see that the 
evil Michigan team is "welcomed" onto the 
field and you feel the pressure and anticipa­
tion as you await the coming of the Irish. Just 
as you are about to explode from the waiting, 
the team runs on the field led by the cheer­
leaders, Bob, and the giant ND flag. Most 
importantly though, they are led by your 
cheers and screams of support and confi­
dence. 
If you are a Freshman, this is the first game 
of many left to come. 
You dig that ticket book out of your pocket, 
and you lunge toward the gate with a smile 
from ear to ear, and a desire in your heart 
that gleams as bright as the gold and blue. As 
you make your way to your seat, you see 
other students, most of whom are wearing 
the same shirt you are. The moment truly 
highlights the unity of our student body. 
But if you are a Senior, this is the first of 
only a handful left. 
As you experience all of this, you begin to 
realize what it means to be a Notre Dame 
student. You also begin to understand what it 
means to belong to this "Notre Dame Family" 
that you keep hearing so much about. But 
most importantly, you learn how to be a fan. 
A real fan is someone who enjoys the game 
not just for football, but for everything else 
that is involved with it. 
You raise your hand over your head, and 
extend your index finger to the sky, partly in 
celebration of our team being No. 1 and part­
ly to intimidate the enemy. You circle your 
arm above your head, and chant 
OOOOOooooohhhhhh! until you feel as if 
your throat is going to explode. And you wait 
until the ball is sent aloft spinning through 
the air, to realize how much you love this 
day. For we will arise victorious, because WE 
ARE NO!

University of California faculty protest Proposition 209 

BERKELEY, Calif. 
UC professors, outraged at the pas­sage of Proposition 209 in 1996, are planning a systemwide walkout on Oct. 21 and 22, though university offi­cials said they are concentrating on outreach to remedy minority admis­sion decreases. 
More than 50 UC professors from Berkeley, Los Angeles, Santa Cruz, Davis, Santa Barbara and San Diego have signed a statement urging pro­fessors, students and staff members to "stop the resegregation of higher education" in support of the massive walkout. 
A preliminary list of those profes­sors supporting the walkout includes 15 from UC Berkeley. Included are Asian American studies Professor Ronald Takaki and Spanish and Portuguese Professor Gwen Kirkpatrick.

Yale freshman dies in fall from tower 
NEW HAVEN, Conn 
Timothy Dwight freshman Vladislav Voynikov fell to his 
death Tuesday night from the 11th floor of University 
Towers at 100 York St. Police are still investigating the 
incident, which the state medical examiner's office said 
did not involve foul play. Police officers said they do not 
yet know whether Voynikov fell from the balcony or inten­
tionally committed suicide. Voynikov was pronounced 
dead at the scene when medtcal officers arrived at 
approximately 10 p.m. The office of the state's chief med­
ical examiner estimated the actual time of death as 
approximately 8:20 p.m and said he fell from apartment 
llC. Police still do not know how Voynikov got into the 
apartment. Police responded to a call from University 
Towers residents at 10 p.m. On Wednesday a shoe 
remained wedged into the balcony on the 11th floor of the 
building, and residents reported seeing police detectives 
taking photographs of the shoe.

Top ranking raises doubts at Duke 
DURHAM, N.C. 
Mother Jones magazine may have recently named Duke 
University the top activist school in the nation, but admin­
istrators, campus leaders and even the activists them­
selves doubt the ranking's validity. "Overall, I don't know 
how activist people are, except about beer-on-points," 
said Trinity senior Ben Au, a member of Students Against 
Sweatshops, the only Duke organization cited by the mag­
azine for its work last year. Working with the administra­
tion, the group developed a code of conduct governing the 
manufacture of Duke apparel. "One does not think of 
Duke as being a particularly activist place," said Dean of 
the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and Dean of Trinity 
College William Chafe, who has chronicled activism in sev­
eral history books. As reported by Durham's Herald-Sun, 
one unnamed high-ranking administrator saw the ranking 
as almost comical. "I want to know what they're smoking 
out there at Mother Jones and can I have some," he said.

According to UC spokesperson Rick Malaspina, as far as the administra­tion is concerned, the walkout is a futile gesture because Proposition 209 ended affirmative action.

Student plans to sue after rape 
WASHINGTON, D.C. 

A GW student will file suit later this month against Boston University and three fraternities there, in connec­tion with an alleged rape at a rush party during her fresh­man year at BU. Jessica Smithers, who transferred to GW last fall, claims BU and the two fraternities where she drank alcohol earlier on the evening of the incident are partially responsible for the assault in October 1995. She also is suing the alleged rapist and his fraternity, Sigma Phi Epsilon. "I want schools to take responsibility and con­cern for their students," Smithers said. "Especially when they advertise the advantages of Greek life but don't moni­tor fraternities." The lawsuit comes after a year of settle­ment negotiations between Smithers and BU fell through. Originally, she sought $3 million, but BU officials claim she lowered that demand to $450,000. Smithers said BU offered her $50,000 if she agreed not to tell her story. Neither party would confirm the other's account. 
• UNIVERSITY OF PITISBURGH 
Professors ogranize Nabisco boycott 
PITTSBURGH, Penn. 

A group of professors hope to make Oreo cookies and Ritz crackers scarce on campus by asking the University to boycott Nabisco products in response to the company's plan to close the Pittsburgh plant. Mark Ginsburg, a pro­fessor in the international studies and education depart­ment and president of the United Faculty of the University of Pittsburgh, is leading an entourage of faculty who plan to bring this issue to a vote at the Faculty Assembly meet­ing on Sept. 8. The Nabisco plant, located on Penn Avenue in East Liberty, is scheduled to close on Nov. 20, despite the fact that 348 union workers of the Local 12 Bakery Workers union operate one of the most profitable and effi­cient factories in the nation, according to Ginsburg. "It may seem unimportant, but people tell me they remember playing baseball as a kid and smelling the pastries being made," Ginsburg said. "[The plant] has been a fixture in the community for 83 years." 
Malaspina said, adding that because of the walkout students will not be. able to attend class. "It is unfortunate that the walkout will adversely affect the studeots," he said. 
For the two-day walkout organizers have scheduled speeches and other activities that will vary from campus to campus, but can take the place of missed classes. 
ASUC Vice President Preston Taylor introduced a bill to the Senate last night which would sponsor the walk­out and pledge Senate support in assisting the organization of activities for UC Berkeley's protest. 
"Instead of the ASUC making it's token statement of support, I really want to help· make this walkout worthwhile by allocating funds, help­ing to plan teach-ins to educate stu­dents, staff, and faculty about the importance of affirmative action," Taylor said.

Geneva-bound Swissair flight crashes near Nova Scotia, kills 229

PEGGY'S COVE, Nova Scotia 
The 229 people aboard Swissair Flight 111 had time to prepare for the worst while the pilots struggled vainly to keep the smoking, groaning jetliner aloft long enough ror an emergency landing. 
Some passengers had donned their life vests during the several minutes before the MD-11 jumbo jet crashed and broke apart Wednesday night in choppy seas off Nova Scotia, Swissair ol'f'icials said Thursday. The plane, which carried 137 Americans, left a slick of jet fuel, floating luggage and human remains, but no survivors. 
"When you saw how small the pieces or rragments were, you could tell it must have been a pretty horrific crash," said Jim Buckley, skipper of a whaling boat that joined a makeshift flotilla that fruitlessly searched for peo­ple to rescue. 
Aboard the jet flown by one of the world's safest airlines were 14 crew members and 215 passengers. There were two infants, several United Nations employees and one of the fore­most leaders in the global fight against AIDS, Dr. Jonathan Mann. 
The Geneva-bound plane departed New York's Kennedy International Airport at 8:18 p.m. EDT Wednesday and crashed 100 minutes later. 
Sixteen minutes passed between the crew's first report of smoke in the cockpit, detected while flying at 33,000 feet, and the plane's disappearance rrom radar scopes at about 8,000 feet, according to Hoy Bears or the Canadian Transportation Safety Board. In that span, the pilot -Urs Zimmermann, 50

Swissair said the plane was seven to 10 minutes away when it plunged into waters about 150 feet deep. Canadian experts are leading the investigation into what caused the crash. The National Transportation Safety Board in Washington sent 10 experts to Canada and experts from Switzerland also were deployed. Canadian officials and the White !-louse said there was no indication the crash resulted from a terrorist act. The Canadians said their intelligence services were in contact with the FRI nonetheless. 
FBI Director Louis Freeh said his agents were examining the passenger list and working to ensure that key evi­dence was properly preserved.

Officer Commander John Ross of the Navy offered a possible explanation for military chil­dren's choice to attend ROTC programs. 
"[Those] from military fami­lies may want to follow in their parents' footsteps but don't want to go to an academy because they don't.think it's the true college experience," he said. 
"They're all coming for the money to some extent, because it's an expensive school," Ross continued. "This is a credible way to pay for it. It's an acade­mic scholarship, not a need­based scholarship, and it's a good way for a middle or even upper-income family to get a Notre Dame education without having to borrow $100,000." 
Army students on scholarship, which Ward estimates are on average all but five in a 30 member class, receive a level scholarship of $16,000 each and choose their major when they apply for the scholarship. The major can be changed, however, if the student has a good reason for the switch, Ward explained. 
The Navy provides only full scholarships with no require­ments for a particular major, according to Ross, and nearly all of the approximately 50 stu­dents receive one. 
Unlike the other two branch­es, many Air Force scholarships are designed to target specific, high-need degrees like engi­neering, physics, math, and for­eign languages, according to Popelka, who noted that the Air Force also offers some scholar­ships that are not major-specif­ic. 
About one half of the close to 45 Air Force ROTC students receive military money to fund their educations. All ROTC stu­dents also receive a $150 per month stipend by law, Popelka said. 
The majority of students who enroll in ROTC as freshmen will complete the program and receive their commissions, explained the officers. Ward noted that the Notre Dame ROTC program has, at 95 per­cent, the best retention rate of all Army ROTC programs in the nation. 
The Navy will lose seven to 10 members of each class for rea­sons such as lack of interest, the inability to meet academic

requirements and medical rea­mcommg freshmen each year. concerns. 


sons, according to Ross. Popelka said that the Air Force typically commissions at least 30 of the 45 students who originally enrolled, though he noted that the number varies from year to year. 
Once commissioned, ROTC graduates will be required to serve a period ranging from four to 10 years of duty. 
Navy graduates, who all receive active duty, commit to at least four years of service. If they receive training as nuclear engineers or pilots, the term of service increases to five and 10 years, respectively, due to addi­tional training costs. Many grad­uates who want to be pilots, however, do not mind the 10­year commitment because they will be flying for at least eight of those years, explained Ross. 
The Air Force also requires a 10-year commitment for pilots, who attend flight school for four years, and six years from navi­gators. 
"We put a lot of money into their training, so we require more back from them," said Popelka, who noted that approximately one third of Air Force ROTC graduates attend flight school. 
"We have a huge demand for pilots and navigators that won't abate for years to come." 
Ward estimates that 60 per­cent of officers commissioned through Army ROTC will remain in the military after their service commitment is completed. 
"I think their motives change over the years and after col­lege," said Ward. 
Ross offered a different opin­ion. 
"[Those that were] only in it for the college education to begin with always had a vision of doing something else, so they go."

men. 

"The first week was hard, but fun, and I knew it would be hard," said freshman Navy mid­shipman Dan Neville. "I learned a lot in one week, and it pre­pares you for a life in the mili­tary." 
A life in the military is just what some of these freshmen are considering when they enroll in the program. While ROTC participants who are on scholarship for four years are required to spend that length of time in the service after gradu­ation, many serve for longer than that. 
''I'm· thinking about [serving] for at least five years," said sophomore Army cadet Joe Kosek. "If I really like it, I'll keep on doipg it. The Army offers a lot of opportunities, which I'm looking forward to." 
Most participants share the opinion of senior midshipman Tim Reinbold when he says, "I have no idea [whether I'll con­tinue after four years.] It depends on a lot of things." 
The potential for a military career is not the only reason that ROTC draws so many Another major motivating fac­tor is the full scholarship which ROTC offers, with a $1,500 stipend included. 
"Bottom line, money was the initial issue. ROTC was a way I could pay for my undergradu­ate education," said Thompson, a 1998 graduate who is in his first year of service in the Navy. Thompson is currently at the Surface Warfare Officers School in Newport, R.I. He also noted the job security coming out of college as an attractive benefit. 
Others, however, are primari­ly compelled to join the pro­gram for other, more long-term 
"I grew up playing with G.I. Joes and watching Rambo movies. I loved it, and I decided then that I wanted to be in the military," Kosek said. "Now, serving my country is a big deal to me, and that's why I did it." 
Reinbold cited a similar rea­son; he sailed for many years growing up and fell in love with the idea of working on a nuclear submarine when he saw the movie "Hunt for the Red October." 
Some students enroll in ROTC in the hopes of getting a scholarship, as some are awarded for two or three years.

Crash

noises from an aireraft passing overhead, then a thundering crash. 
"The motors were still going, but it was the worst-sounding deep groan that I've ever heard," said Claudia Zinck-Gilroy. 
Dozens of fishing boats and coast guard ships hurried out to the crash site, about six miles off the coast of Peggy's Cove. The picturesque fishing village -popula­tion 60 -is popular with tourists for its pirate lore and much-photographed light­house, but the area also is known for shipwn~cks and other maritime tragedies. 
After the first few hours of the night­long search, the mood among boat crews turned grim when reports of survivors proved false. Instead, boat after boat radioed to a naval command vessel that more body bags were needed to cradle human remains scattered among aircraft debris over several square miles of the Atlantic. 
"It's real ugly," said Craig Sanford, operator of a whale-watching boat that was one of the first vessels on the scene. "You see Styrofoam lloating, chunks of wood, panels, the odd body here and there. It's not a nice scene." 
The first three dozen bodies recovered were taken to a temporary morgue at the Canadian Forces Base Shearwater, 30 miles to the east. 
Searchers said· they had located a chunk of the plane's fuselage believed to be intact on the ocean floor. Divers planned to search for the flight recorders, which could help determine the cause of the disaster. 
Swissair and its partner, Delta Airlines, were flying relatives from New York and Switzerland to Halifax. Nova Scotia offi­cials offered to provide 900 hotel rooms for the families, and pledged to protect their privacy as they faced the grim chore of identifying loved ones. 
Swissair said the passenger list would not be released until family members are notified. In addition to the 136 American passengers and an American crew mem­ber, it said 39 Swiss nationals and 30

Senator 
continued from page 1 
stop on what promises to be a semester-long whirlwind tour. Promoting his upcoming book and considering a bid for the presidency in 2000 will defmitely be part of the fall 1998 agenda, but Bradley wants to "interact with other elements of the Uhiversity community" at Notre Dame as well. 
"I am looking forward to the seminars more than the lectures because I will get to engage with [the students] in reference to each lecture. This will be, on some levels, an opportunity to have an intense experience and then have some time to think about that experience," Bradley said. 
The Princeton graduate brings with him nearly two decades of experience in the U.S. Senate, during which he has dealt with issues that also reach the University community. The pro­bationary status of the WomenOs Resource Center for displaying information on abortion touches on one of those issues. 
"I support freedom of choice for the woman. I respect those who have an opposing view because they have a strong moral conviction for their belief. I think we just agree to dis­agree," Bradley said. "But I think the University governs actions in the University. I think that peo­ple who come here will under­stand that it's a Catholic institu­tion. I'm not going to second guess the administration as for their religious convictions." 
He also supports "freedom of speech for all people," in response to the University's denial of a gay and lesbian group to officially meet on campus. 
"People who come here under­stand that it's a Catholic school. I have no reservations about being here regarding the University's policies," he said. 
The Catholic character of the University will also come into play with other plans Bradley has for his semester at Notre Dame. He has already been approached by various profes­sors to share in discussion regarding spiritual meaning in politics and will address the American spiritual movement in his lectures. 
"I can tell that there's a deeper spiritual concern here than, say, at Stanford or [the University of] Maryland," Bradley noted of the other institutions where he has taught. 
At Notre Dame, he plans to focus his lectures on the theme of "the new American narrative" as a way to revisit and study his­tory in a contemporary setting. 
"It's something I've been thinking about for the last 10 years. The story of this country needs to be made appropriate for the time. A lot of times, things seem like they come around and then go and that they're coming around again, especially in politics. That has to be studied and adjusted for the times, and I think I fit in as the person who's struggling to for­mulate it," Bradley said. 
"My goal is to show that we have it within our power to con­tinue to generate hope." 
As for questions regarding a possible bid for the presidency, Bradley said he will "have to decide before the end of the year." 
He claims that being at Notre Dame and the election in 2000 are not directly related, in trying to get neither the college stu­dent's nor the Catholic's vote. 
''I'd like to get in touch with the young people," he said. ''I'll give it a try." 
Leader 
continued from page! 

While Bradley praised the scientific and global advances made over the last century, he noted new areas of concern. He discussed the large number of .children now growing up in sin­gle parent homes and the inability of modern society to fill individuals' yearning for love and meaning. He also lamented today's increased voter apathy and questioned the audience on ways to improve that situation. 
"America is about stretching boundaries," Bradley said. "Waves of immigrants pushed boundaries [and] redefined our nationality." 
Bradley next turned to the need for races to work together and criticized present partisan politics. 
"Liberals have a government program for every problem ... They too often refuse to realize that hard work coun-ts," Bradley said. "Conservatives fail to realize that government can work for the common good. They rely only on individual acts of good will," he continued. 
Bradley emphasized the need for governance over govern­ment, saying that current vol­unteer efforts are insufficient because they do not compen­sate to the worker. 
Bradley then concluded his speech by presenting his idea of a new type of leadership, mod­eled after the hero archetype found in literature. 
"In the absence of crisis, the good leader encourages us to

be all we can be," Bradley said, describing the ideal leader. 
Comparing a leader to an orchestra conductor, Bradley said that a good leader helps various areas of society to fit together and blend harmo­niously. 
"The orchestra leader... lis­tens, connects people below anq focuses on the nation and its interests as a whole," Bradley said. 
The displeasure with which campus pro-life groups have greeted Bradley's visiting pro­fessorship resurfaced at the start of the lecture when pam­phlets condemning Bradley's pro-choice political record were distributed anonymously to visi­tors. 
Father Malloy addressed the need for an "open forum" in his introductory remarks.

Panel addresses use of planned violence 
By MAGGY TINUCCI 
News Writer 
The use of violence as a response to violence is a hot issue in academic, political and religious circles. Yesterday, in a panel discussion of Notre Dame professors entitled, "U.S. Bombing in Sudan and Afghanistan: An Antidote to Terrorism?" the debate contin­ued, focusing on the U.S. bomb­ing in Sudan and Afghanistan to combat terrorism. 
During the discussion, profes­sors from three departments formed an interdisciplinary panel. Each professor address1~d a separate question that high­lighted the irrationalitins of ter­rorism. 
Carolyn Nordstrom, assodatn professor of anthropology, summed up the collective opin­ion of the panel by defining ter­rorism as "the use of terror against a population." Each of the professors had their own opinions as to how, and if. this terror can be combated in the futuro. · 
Bombing will not reduce ter­rorism, said Alan Dowty, profes­sor of government. He based this conclusion on the problems in international polities and law, which ol'licially state that civil­ians cannot be the targets of vio­lence. 
Nordstrom contends that the strategy of war has changed in such a manner that the perenp­tion of civilians has shifted from qne of innoeence to one of aetive involvement, both in an indus­trial and guerrilla sense. 
"We've gottnn used to it and chang~)d the rules of the game," she said, nxplaining that this usn of violenee stems from the nend of military and politieal regimes to control those weaker than themselves. 
In her field work in Angola, Nordstrom saw violence stem­ming from thll desperation or tlw terrorists to change their place in life. 
"Aggrnssion comns from a lack of hopn," shn said, adding that once thn violent pattnrns of bnhavior have benn snt in motion. the hopns and dreams of the peoplll disapp1~ar, as dons tho hope for tlwir futums. 
In the case of Sudan. the justi­fication or u.s. action deponds solely on the evidcnee available, Dowty elairns. U.S. oflkials say that tho bombing was inlluencml by traces of a chemical that is only used in a deadly nerve gas. 
Dowty said that the key to overcoming terrorism in the futuro is the intelligence to dis­eover terrorists' plans before they ean bn acted upon. "This is 80 per cent of tho battle." Dowty explained. 
Hobert Fishman, an associate professor or sociology, pinpoints the terrorists work as paradoxi­cal. The perpntrators goal is to cause division insidn the govern­ment in the hopes of causing policy to be achieved in thnir favor. In the ease of a Dnrnoeratic administration, internal divisions emerge and cause politicians to move toward the right and toward unilateral military action. This is what the terrorists do not want.

Italian Cardinal Pio Laghi will preside at Saturday morn· ing's memorial Mass in St. P!lt.er's. 
Saturday night's television tribute will feature everyone from U.N. Secretary-General Kof'i Annan and Palestinian leader Vasser Arafat to British actor BPn Kingsley and Italian singers and cfllebritios. 
The pope will open the pro­gram with rt'marks on the woman known in hor time as a living saint. 
In October, John Paul quashed speculation that the church might oxpedito saint­hood for Mother Teresa. Rules signed by the pope himself in 1983 mandate a five-year wait after death before the process of canonization can begin. 
"I think it is necessary to fol­low the normal way," the Pope said at the time. 
Vatican spoke8man Joaquin Navarro-Valls said Thursday the pope's position is unchanged. despite growing calls from India -where nuns have begun collecting support­ing evidence of miracles ­
and elsnwlHlre for  an  exeep·  
tion.  
"lie  prefers  to  apply  to  

everyone the same rules," Navarro-Valls said, and offered solace for the wait. "Once the whole process begins, maybn tho whole thing will be very quick." 
Even those devoted to Mother TPresa are divided about sainthood, with some saying she wouldn't want the fuss. 

Bombing suspect claims he was coerced into confession 
Associated Press 
NEW YOHK 
The lawyer for a suspect in the U.S. Embassy bombing in Kenya says his client was kept awake for three days and nights and denied food by Pakistani investigators who coerced him into saying he had a role in last month's attack. 
Mohamed Sadeek OdPh, 33, was interrogated until he told Pakistani authorities that he helped plan the bombing and was part of an organization financed by Islamic militant Osama bin Laden. said his lawyer, .Jack Sachs. 
Authorities believe bin Laden orchestrated the attacks. 
"The interrogation procP­dures were almost like thn Inquisition," Sachs told Tlw Associated Press in an inter­view Thursday evening. "lin was kept under bright lights 
-., 
for three day8 and three nights with no sleep. 111~ had no food, no watnr for three days." 
Although Odeh was not phys­ically harnwd, Sachs said his dient was intimidated. 
"After that." said Sachs, "lw said whatnver they wanted him to say." 
No one could be readwd hy phone at tlw Consulate General of Pakistan in New York. which was elosed Jato Thursday. 
Odeh has told U.S. investiga­tors that hn had no role in the August 7 attacks of U.S. embassies in K1~nya and Tanzania which kiiiPd 25H 
pnople,  including  12  
Americans.  
Odeh, who  was  arrestod  as  

he tried to enter Pakistan with phony travel documPnts, faces chargns of murder. murder conspiracy and conspiracy to use wea pon8 of mass destruc­tion. 
Sachs said Odeh acknowl­edges mcmbnrship in a group called al Qaida. which U.S. officials hav11 said is part of bin Laden's terrorist 1wtwork. 
But Odoh told Sad18 that tlw organization is dnvotnd to "aiding follow Muslims, not killing Amerieans." 
"lie said it's against his rnli­gion to kill unarnwd civilians," said Sachs. 
Sachs said his client does not know Mohamed Hashed Daoud AI-Owhali. the~ other suspnct in the attack who is being detained in New York awaiting trial. Sachs said his client does not know who is responsibln for the bombings.

Congress seeks billions in e01ergency fariD assistance 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON 
Momentum is building in Congress to rush billions of dol­lars in emergency assistance to farmers before lawmakers leave town next month to cam­paign. 
"The question is no longer whether, but how we'll address this farm crisis," Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., said Thursday. 
The Republican-controlled Senate defeated a Democratic proposal in July to raise the government's commodity price supports. The move that would have cost taxpayers $1.5 bil­lion. 
But with grain prices falling and an election looming, sever­al GOP senators are working on a proposal to increase the gov­ernment's direct payments to farmers by $2 billion to as much as $5.6 billion. 
"In July, the price of corn was $2 (per bushel). Now it's proba­bly $1.65," said Sen. Charles Grassley. R-Iowa. "It's a crisis because the price has gone down more than anyone antici­pated." 
Growers already are due to get $5.5 billion in direct pay­ments for 1999. The "market transition" payments were guaranteed through 2002 under the 1996 "Freedom to Farm" law. 
President Clinton signed legis­lation last month to make those 1999 payments available in October, several months ahead of schedule. 
Democrats, meanwhile, say they will demand another vote on their proposal to sweeten the government's marketing loan program, which is used to support commodity prices. 

They expect to seek $1 billion more in assistance to farmers hurt by repeated crop failures; the Senate approved $500 mil­lion in such assistance in July. 
Democrats also are working on additional proposals to pro­vide further subsidies for farm­ers who store grain or cut their corn for silage. 
"The circumstances continue to worsen and the demand for action continues to grow," said Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, 0-S.D. 
Groups of farm-state senators have been meeting this week to plot strategy. The House returns from its August recess next week. 
Increasing price supports by lifting a cap on marketing loan rates would "do the most good in the fastest period of time," Daschle said. 
Corn growers would get about 30 cents a bushel more and wheat farmers an extra 60 
Some congressional Republicans no longer rule out the idea, and several GOP gov­ernors have endorsed it. 
But critics fear that raising the loan rates would encourage overproduction and worsen the grain glut that has been push­

cents. ing prices down.

Senate To Vote on Teen Abortion Bill 
Associdrcd Press 
WASIJINGTON 

Abortion retut·ns to the Senate ralendar next week, with lawmakers expod(ld to tiPbatP a bill making it a erimn to help a pregnant tecnager evade parental involvt1ment rllquir'!HnPnts by going to another state for an abortion. 
Tlw measure. sponsored by Sen. Spenenr Abraham, H­Mich., would make it a federal misdemeanor for anyone besides the girl's parent or legal guardian to take her for an abortion in a state without similar nHJUirements. 
Supporters say pnrnntal involvcmont laws in more than 30 states are too often dreurnventml. somPtimP.S with tragic results when a parent isn't around and eomplica­tions arise. Others have said it also would help protect girls from older men who take them to other states for an abortion to hide evidence o illegal sexual activity. 
Opponnnts contend thtl ITHH\· sure would force vulnerable teens to end unwanted preg­nancies without the aid, sup· port and comfort or an adult. Further, they say it would unfairly expose relatives and other adults who otTer help to fines and a year in jail. 
Supporters say they have the votes to pass the bill. which Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, H-Miss., has dAscribmi as "must-pass legis­lation." Senate Democrats, however, are expected to take procedural steps to stall the final vote. 
Abraham said the issue isn't about abortion, but the rights of' parents.

Earl batters Florida, kills three 
Associatl'd Press 
PANAMA CITY BEACH 
llurrieane Earl capsized fish­ing boats, spun ofT deadly tor­nadoes and dumped nearly two feet of rain on the Florida Panhandle before weakening Thursday over Georgia. At least threo pooplo were killed and onn was missing. 
The hurricano came ashore 
ncar this Gull' Coast community 
around I a.m. with 80 mph 
winds but was downgradod to a 
tropieal storm at midday, its 
winds dropping below 50 mph. 
Along the Gull' Coast, the hur­ricane swamped homes with its 11-foot storm surgo, nattoned trees and utility polos, lifted roofs ofT and knocked out power to tens of thousands of people in Florida and Alabama. Panama City got 23 inches of rain. 
"A couple of times I was pret­ty seared," conceded Tracey Packard, a TV meteorologist from Jacksonville. "It was intense." 
Ms. Packard rode out the storm with about 150 people on Florida's St. George Island who ignon~d an evacuation order and were cut off Wednesday night when water washed over the only bridge to the main­land. The bridge reopened around noon Thursday. 
A tornado ahead of the storm killed one person and left another missing on St. Helena Island in South Carolina. 
The storm also spun off twisters in Florida, Georgia and North Carolina. 
On the water, two fishing boats. the Can-Too and the Me­Too, flipped three miles off Panama City, tossing all six fishermen into 16-foot seas. Two of the men wer'e found clinging to an overturned boat, one was reseued hanging onto debris and a fourth was found in a life raft. 


The body of one fisherman washed up on the beach here and a second was found noat­ing in the Gulf of Mexico five miles away. 
Two other men whose sail­boat capsized ncar Shell Island swam about three-quart1~rs of a mile to Tyndall Air Force Base after a rescue boat was forced back by choppy water and high winds. 
One critical injury was reported, to a person who was body surfing west of Panama City during the storm. 
By early evening, the broken­up storm was centered on tho Georgia-South Carolina line, with scattered pownr outages and street flooding rnportnd. The remnants w11rn exp1~etml to drift into the Atlantic by way of North Carolina or Virginia this week1)nd. 
Flash flood watches wore in effect in North Carolina. 
"If we ean get rain in the rwxt few days, it will help the soy­beans," said Jim Eaton. who farms soybeans,wheat and corn. "The corn is gone, and pods of the soybeans are falling on the ground." 
Steve and Brnnda Baldwin and their daughter jumped into their bathtub wlwn they heard a tornado corning at their Citrus County mobile home about 75 miles north of Tampa. 
The roof tore off, leaving them protected only by a sheet of drywall. Their Rottweiler was flung into a mobile home. The dog wasn't seriously hurt.

• THE WISDOM TO KNOW THE DIFFERENCE 

Coed naked presidency? 
Photo: 
Oval Office, circa 1998 (Tommy Hilfiger 
Advertisement, September 1998). 
A long time ago, someone called the presidency "the symbol of American ideals." That's why I still can't believe what 60 percent of the American peo­ple have to say about the Clinton-Lewinsky sex scandal. ''I'm tired of it. Most people have a few skeletons in a closet. That man is just like every­body else, and I don't care about his personal life. It's all politics." America has bought into the "everybody's doing it" defense. Tragically, Bill Clinton has sunk his presidency, and he has taken

Ruiz 
most people do things 
-----========----~they're
ashamed of, the president's "improper relationship" with a then 21-year-old intern ought to be ignored, if not excused. Of course, there isn't a parent who would buy this argument from their teen-aged son who wants an earring or a tattoo, but in America, most people judge the president by a lower standard. The end result is irreparable damage to the Presidency as an institution. 
Sure, it's true-most people don't care about the president's sex life. Most people aren't prepared to punish the president for his creative use of the law. Most people don't want to be interrupted during their regularly scheduled program. Most people in America remind idealists like me that we don't live in Norman Hockwell paintings; idealists like me wonder if most people know who Norman Rockwell is. 
But the idea that America wants a president who is like most people is absurd. If that were true, we'd scrap the electoral system and hold a presi­dential lottery every four years. Besides, the last thing the president wants is to be treated as most people would be treated in similar situations. Consider the following: 
-Officers in the Armed Forces often see their careers destroyed by "personal character failures," despite otherwise exemplary military careers. In a recent article in the Washington Post, Senator Dan 

-Even in front of friendly crowds, the president 
is the subject of wisecracks and snickers. At a recent fund-raiser in the llamptons, a loyal backer summed up the evening with the president: "Everyone was careful not to wear a blue dress." His date added. "No one wore a. beret." -A familiar cry from the llollywood elite: "We didn't elect him Pope." No, instead we elected a liar and a serial phi­landerer. Most people would have lost their friends and their spouses by now. Most people in positions of authority who had sexual relations with a subordinate in the workplace would have lost their jobs as well. Sixty percent of America has a point, though. We don't need (dare I say, want) to know details of President Clinton's sex life. And the independent counsel's investiga­tion has not been without fault. In a per­fect world, TV's Judge Judy would have headed the investigation, and the case would have lasted no more than fifteen minutes, including commercials. But this is not a perfect world, and Judge Judy was not available. I don't mean to suggest that President Clinton ought to be impeached, or that he should resign. I merely regret that America has lost what little innocence it had left. I regret that the word "presi­dential" now precedes (allegedly in the words of Ms. Lewinsky) "kneepads," as well as "seal" and "address." And I regret that President Clinton has not had enough courage to say the words, ''I'm sorry." I guess thatfs the whole point of this column -to mourn the passing of the days when character and courage-mattered.

At the start of this year. wn should reflect on this readable Pastoral­lmcause you will not hear many good words about llurnanae Vitae on this campus, and because the contraceptive pill is the answer to that talk show question. "Paul VI," said Chaput, "cautioned against four problems": 
1) [Wiidespread use of contraception would lead to 'conjugal infidelity and the ... lowering of morality.' ... JT!he cultural revolution since 1968 ... would not have been possible ... without easy access to reliable contraception ... Paul VI was right." 
2) Through contraception, "man would lose rnspeet for woman [and) would consider her 'as a nwre instrument of enjoyment,' ... [Clontraception might be markett~d as libt~rating for women, but the rnal 'benelidarios' ... would be men. 1/umanae Vitae ... n~jeeted sexual exploitation of women years

"[T)he Church is against all contraception. The notion of "artificial" ... tends to confuse discussion by implying that the debate is about a mechanical intrusion into the body's organic system.

I know what you did last summer 
The question "What did you do over the summer?" often 
comes up in casual conversation around this time of year. For 
most of us, the answers range from construction to secretarial 
work to internships to just hanging around and watching car­
toons (at least for the most shiftless of us college types). 
And what did your friendly neighborhood columnist do dur­
ing the summer? I worked for my father, manufacturing 
Fiberglas ductwork for air conditioning systems and renovat­
ing rental properties • 
However, ifanyone were to ask what I did last year, I would 
tell them truthfully I was a floor host at Thee Dollhouse of 
Philadelphia, a gentlemen's cabaret, a.k.a a "nudie joint.'' 
What is a floor host? Quite simply, a combination of bouncer, salesman, pit boss and general all-around lackey. The phrase that most aptly describes our demeanor is ''an iron ftst in a velvet glove.'' Two of my brothers {ages 23 and 20) also worked there. While the younger one became a floor host like myself, the older was originally the "light and sound" man, thenbecame a part·time general manager. As the saying goes, it's best to keep rt in the family. 
IfI close my eyes, I can imagine the expressions of people silently processing this information. For some reason, I can see men silently cheering and women shaking their heads wonder­ing what kind ofpsychopaths write for The Pitt News. 
It's a common reaction. When I mention my former place of employment, people look at me in a whole new light. They can't imagine such a cultured, soft-spoken, erudite man of the world (cough, cough) working in a place where men shoved $20 bills into awomen's garter belts. 
But ldid. However, I did not work in a sex parlor that sold 
pornographic videos. maga.zlnes or "marital aids." Nor did I 
work in an establishment that had a ''back room." 
Also, none of the women performed any unnatural acts involving mammals or reptiles, nor did they wrestltl in Jell-0 or pasta as the movie "Striptease" would have the general public believe. (Though it was my esteemed honor to meet unnatural act Ron ''The Hedgehog" Jeremy when he stopped by for an personal appearance. Fringe benefits.) 
But the biggest misconception many people have is that most of the women who work in adult cabarets are "vapidly stupid." Jt has been my experience that the majority of women who are "exotic dancers" are intelligent and rational. Some of them use the money they make to fmance college degrees. 
With the amount some dancers take home in one night, they could pay for a year of college in a few months, with money left over for a car, rent, taxes, clothing and a stockpile of G­strings. 
It's not exactly the most progressive of pron~ssions, but you do get to be your own boss. And I mean that literally: All dancers that worked at Thee Dollhouse were legally indepen· dent contractors, which brings new meaning to the phrase "Let me see your W-2." The reading public may be wondering what, for the most part, does the inside of a gentlemen's cabaretJook like? 
Imagine taking a Barbie condominium play set and ripping off everything but the first floor. Then paint the inside black, and Une the room with strobe light.:;, a sound system, neon tub­ing and black lights. Install a small stage with a mirrored wall and a brass pole. and a bar with several miniature TVs playing ESPN. 
Throw in a few Barbies in thongs, several bustier-clad Skippers serving drinks, and about thirty Kens sitting at small club tables smiling their plastic smiles and drinking their plas­tic beers. 
Oh, and a few G.I.Joes in tuxedo shirts and vests watching the parking lot filled with Barbie Corvettes, making damn sure Ken doesn't get dnmk and unruly. That was my job. 
Now to the question on most minds: Yes. I have seen women's breasts. Many breasts. Breasts in all different shapes and sizes. If 1were a composer, I'd write music to go witl1 the following lyrics: "Big ones/Small ones/Roly-poly fake ones ... " 
For those with a Y chromosome who were employed by Thee Ooiihouse, work was not a source of (pardon the pun) constant titillation. I must admit that when I first started. watching naked women dance was interesting. But as time passed and job boredom set in, they all became noUtlng more than moving wallpaper -which is a good indication that men are not the slobbering wollhounds some paint them to be. 
In a final onalysis. it was the most interesting summ(~r job J ever had. The pay was all right, the fringe benefits were excel­lent (no wisecracks) and the staff parties were phenomenal. (Think open bar.) But in a high energy environment whore Aqua's "Barbie Girl" is being bla.<>ted into your ears while working lO·hour shifts 1mtil 3 a.m. just to get up a 7 the n~xt morning ... you get the picture. But it shu11 always have a fond place in my heart.

Reviving the Catholic social tradition at the University of Notre Dame 
The revival of the discussion of Catholic idimtity at Notre Dame has been taking place for almost a decade now. Notably absent from the conversation is any thoroughgoing attention to and retrieval of the faith's social tradition. With regard to the life of the faculty, the accent has been on hiring more persons who profess the faith; when it comes to students the focus is primarily on abortion and sexual issues ranging from homosexuality to contraception. As important as these matters are, they constitute far from the whole of Catholic identity. 
Ignorance of and rela­tive silence on the

Catholic social tradi­tion is _not unique to

Notre 

--------~============~-------Dame, a
point that both the pope and the American Catholic bishops have emphasized. John Paul II, in his apostolic let­ter, "Tertio mellennio adventiente" (As the Third Millennium Draws Near) insists, "It must be asked how many Christians really know and put into prac­tice the principles of the Church's social doctrine," suggesting that few do. In an effort to respond to the pope's recognition that few persons-even few Catholics -know and practice the social doctrine, the American bishops have recently released the document, "Sharing Catholic Social Teaching: Challenges and Directions." Here they point out that, "Catholic teaching is a central and essential element of our faith." They go on to observe that, despite that central place, "our social heritage is unknown by many Catholics. Sadly, our social doctrine is not shared or taught in a consistent and comprehensive way in too many of our schools." This lack is critical precisely because the "sharing of our social tradition is a defining measure of Catholic education and for­mation."Learning and living the social tradition is particularly crucial at NotreDame because its grad­uates move on to take positions of high-ranking leadership and considerable power that impact the lives of many persons in a broad spectrum of social spheres, including politics, law, business, education, the media, and the military. In the political sphere, these positions include or have included the National Security Advisor, the Secretary of the Interior, congressional leaders from Pennsylvania, New York, Indiana, and Kentucky, the Governor of Puerto Hico, and the President of Panama. In the legal sphere graduates have become, for instance, Judge of the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals, New Mexico, Attorney General of California, and Judge on the Minnesota Supreme Court. Notre Dame grad­uates in the business world have become Chairs, Presidents and/or CEOs of numerous companies, including Texaco, Motorola, Bank of America Illinois, Haggar Company, Leo Burnette Advertising Agency, Mobil Corporation, Dean Witter, and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. The influence of the University's graduates on higher education in the United States is evident in the fact that they serve or have served as the presidents of nine universities other than Notre Dame. Graduates have also taken positions of leadership in the media, including exec­utive producer of "Nightline," writer for The Tonight Show, Jim Lehrer Newshour political analyst, senior writer at Newsweek magazine, and nationally syndi­cated talks how host. Finally, graduates in the mili­tary have risen as high as the rank of general in the Army and Secretary of the Air Force. (Information on graduates is from the "Noted Alumni: Graduates of Distinction" listing from the University of Notre Dame Public Helations web page.) 
The questions which the Catholic social tradition brings to these graduates and to the University itself are these: For the graduates who are Catholic, are they entering into their professional lives as Catholics? And for those graduates who are not Catholic, are they entering into their professional lives influenced by a set of values consonant with those put forth by the University in which they spent such formati,ye years? To put the matter in terms appropriate to a Catholic University, do our gradu­ates understand and practice their professional life as a vocation? 
The social tradition, taken as a whole, is at once, 
a) a constellation of concepts and distinctions that gives articulation to a coherent yet variegated social theory-one that is as fully developed as any coun­terpart, secular or religious-and b) the concrete social activities, both formally organized and infor­mally inspired, of a community of people that seeks to practice what it believes. The constellation includes such concepts as solidarity, social justice, the common good, the just wage, human rights, the free economy, subsidiarity, and the option for the poor. Sources for the tradition go back as far as the Bible and develop even in the early church fathers. Medieval writings on topics such as usury and the origins and proper exercise of kingship bring an unprecedented level of detail to Christian analysis of the just society. Pope Leo XIII inaugurates Catholicism's effort to bring its social tradition to bear on industrial society in his 1891 encyclical, Rerum Novarum (The Condition of Labor). since then, popes have drawn upon Rerum Novarum and the social tradition to broaden and develop Leo's set of concerns in encyclicals often titled -as with Pius XI's 1931 Quadragesimo Anno ("After Forty Years"), Paul VI's 1971 Octogesima Adveniens ("The Eightieth Anniversary"), and John Paul JJ's 1991 Centesimus Annus ("On the Hundredth 

Anniversary") -in accordance with their reiation­ship to the earlier document. In doing so, the popes and the second Vatican Council have addressed issues ranging across all spheres of social life from the family to the state to the economy to the church. The U.S. bishops have made sophisticated applica­tion of these teachings to the circumstances of the United States. 
The University's own mission statement draws from core concepts of the Catholic social tradition when it states that, "the University seeks to cultivate in its students not only an appreciation for the great achievements of human beings but also a disciplined sensibility to the poverty, injustice and oppression that burden the lives of so many. The aim is to cre­ate a sense of human solidarity and concern for the common good that will bear fruit as learning becomes service to justice." The degree to which the University has succeeded in this matter is the ques­tion. It is an open question for other Catholic univer­sities as well. A recent study conducted by David O'Brien, the Loyola Professor of Catholic Studies at the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts, found that "almost but not all schools reporting offer courses which deal with Catholic social teaching." The study adds, however, "Despite these efforts, Catholic social teaching most likely remains a well-kept secret even on these cam­puses ... There are few programs which offer stu­dents the chance to pursue questions of social jus­tice in a systematic way." To help rectify this prob­lem at Notre Dame, this semester a committee is for­warding a proposal for an undergraduate concen­tration in the Catholic social tradition to the College Council. 
My hope is that this column can play a similar role. I will bring the concepts and principles of the social tradition to bear on the full range of issues confronting the three "publics" identified by theolo­gian David Tracy: the church, society, and the acad­emy (or as we prefer in the 46556 zip code, God, country, and Notre Dame). My sense is that doing so will help overcome the polarities that often develop in campus discussion on issues of import, polarities that foreclose rather than prompt genuine conversa­tion. I title this column "The Common Good," because of the Catholic tradition's conviction that all persons flourish in a truly well-ordered society. In John Paul JJ's words, the common good is "the good of all and of each individual , because we are all really responsible for all." 
In emphasizing the com­mon good, therefore, I will, among other things, identify points of contact and overlap between groups otherwise at odds in what some have called the "culture wars." This will not, I assure you , lead to positions that please all persons, and this for two reasons. First, the viability of many of the groups in the culture wars depends on their having opposition. Identifying common ground threatens their viability. Second, and more profound­ly, the Catholic social tradi­tion, taken as a whole, does not line up with either side of the animosities tout court. In other words, what is good may often be common to nei­ther of the belligerents in the culture wars. My sense is that many persons have tired of the overextended rhetoric that serves as the fodder for the culture war battles. My hope is that retrieving the lost language of the Catholic social tradition will provide a different mode of engage­ment. To this end, I will write some of my columns in con­versation with responses to earlier columns, whether those responses are through letters to The Observer or in e-mail to me. I welcome such responses. 
This mode of engagement 

will not eliminate disagree­ment and is not intended to do so. The great twenti­eth century theologian John Courtney Murray distin­guished between argument and confusion. The for­mer included some points of agreement such that whatever disagreements there may be become clari­fied in the exchange. "We hold certain truths; there­fore we can argue about them." Authentic argu­ment, in Murray's view, is an achievement. "[D]isagreement is not an easy thing to reach." Confusion, on the other hand, lacks and identified points of contact, such that even the points of con­tention are distorted and lost. "And when [the differ­ent views] clash, the issue of agreement or disagree­ment tends to become irrelevant . The immediate situation is simply one of confusion. One does not know what the other is talking about." My aim in introducing this column under the rubric of the com­mon good is to bring the Catholic social tradition to bear on the issues of the day in a manner that will avoid confusion by clarifying the points of disagree­ment, and, where the issues permit, the areas of agreement, because, "we are all really responsible for all." 
The views expressed in this column are those of the author, and not neccessarily those of The Observer.

C.S.C., was a strong advocate of a music department, .and former Irish coach Knute Rockne played the flute during his undergraudate days. The band provided fans with half­limn nntnrlainment during Notre Dame's first home football game against the University of Michigan in 1887 and has not missed a home game since. 
The marching band is most known for its half-time per­formanens during Notre Dame football games, but has also porformnd at numerous bowl games, basketball games. civi<~ function and parades across the nation. 
The Notre Dame Band first performed the "Notre Dame Victory March" in 1908. Notre Dame's Alma Mater, "Notre Damn, Our Mother," was composed by former band direc­tor Joseph Cassanta, and was first permormed during Knute Hockne's funeral service in 1931. 

The Notre Dame Irish Guard was added to the band in 1941J, at the request of then band director II. Lee llope. The uniform of the Irish Guard is patterned after the traditional Irish kilt. The ollieial Notre Dame plaid was adopted by the University in 1970. The green in the plaid signifies the Fighting Irish. the blue and gold signify the University of 
L___11!!!!~iL__j Notre Dame colors. the red signifies the Church and the Iloly Cross Fathers and the black to delineate the design. 
The band has grown since its inception more than 150 years ago, and now ineludes students from Saint Mary's College.

George Gipp, Notre Dame all-star player from 1916-1920 died suddenly at the age of 25 from a streptococcic throat infection. But before he died. he uttered the famous phrase that still lives on in the hearts of all Notre Dame football players: 
"I'VE GOT TO GO, ROCK. IT'S ALL RIGHT. I'M NOT AFRAID. SOME TIME, ROCK, WHEN THE TEAM IS UP AGAINST IT, WHEN THINGS ARE WRONG AND THE BREAKS ARE BEATING THE BOYS -TELL THEM TO GO IN THERE WITH ALL THEY'VE GOT AND WIN ONE JUST FOR THE GIPPER.

The Mascot 
o clear story exists to explain the Michigan nickname and mascot, the Wolverine, but several theories exist. 
-in I 944 coach Fielding H. Yost wrote in the Michigan Quarterly Review that the nickname evolved from fur trading that occured at Sault Ste. Marie for many years. Because most of the furs were wolverine pelts, the term Michigan wolverines became common, giving birth to the state nickname and eventually the university's nickname. 
-in I 952 Albert H. Marckwardt wrote in the Michigan Quarterly Review that the nickname came from the fierce, or wolverine~like, appetite of the French who settled in Michigan in the late I JOOS. 
-the final theory realtes to the border dispute between Michigan and Ohio in I 803. During the dispute, the Michigan natives may have labeled themselves wolverines or may have been labeled wolverines by the Ohioans.

"lin's definitely going to do it," But.dwr said. "lie donsn't have to do it against mn." 
M1:Gwirn hasn't do1w much against thn thrne Beds' startnrs. lie's 2-for-8 with a home run against Pete llarnisch. who'll start Friday night, but hasn't l'acnd him this year.

That's not to say McGwire won't brnak Maris' rncord of lJ 1 at home, and it might even happnn in front of' rival Sammy Sosa. 
t\l'tnr tho Cardinals are linished with thn Beds. St. Louis has a two-game snries against t.hn Cubs beginning Monday.

"Thnrn an~ days I'm not going to son murh to hit." McGwire said Wnd1wsday. "Tlwrn are days I might sen stuff lo hit that I might not hit. 
"When it's meant to bn dmw, if it's nwant to bn donn. it will bn clone. 
''I'm not going to change my lifo just b1~causn of what's going on. I try to go about things and have as normal a lil'n as possibiP." 
Too bad McGwirn can't play tho Marlins more often. La Bussa and Marlins managor .lim Lnyland are close friends, guaranteeing his slugger qual­ity at-bats. 
"Everybody is rooting for the Marlins to win the ganw," Leyland said after Mce;wire's two-homnr salvo Wt~dnesday night in a St. Louis 14-4 viet.ory. "Thny're also rooting for Md;wirn to hit a homo run." 
Nht cvnrybody, ol' course.

Gordon in search of victory '.Elway determined 
Associated Press 
DAHI.INGTON, S.C. 

.Jell' Gordon has an opportuni­ty to extend one of his NASCAH roeords, set another and pocket a $1 million bonus by winning the Southern 500. 
It eould be a profitable, tradi­tion-filled Sunday. But Gordon isn't saying much about that. In fact, with the New llampshire tiro 11ap still at the fore, he is dnfending his honor. 
"We want everybody to know -our fans, ciur sponsors-that wp're acting within the rules," c;ordon said Thursday at II om 1~stnad, Fla., w he rc the I1J!J9 Winston Cup sehndule was unveiled. 
Gordon had spent most of the week trying to avoid the spot­light after his tires and those of rumwr-up Mark Martin wnre impounded by NASCAH ollicials following Sunrlay's win at Loudon, N.ll.

the championship race, where he is seeking his third title in four years. 
With Martin only 67 points behind, Dale Jarrett still in long-range striking distance and 10 races remaining on the schedule, that's not a bad approach. 
"If we take our concentration ofT the race for the champi­onship, we'll lose it," Gordon said. "It would be great to win (the bonus) this weekend, but as long as we come away with a top live, I'll be happy." 
Ilappy with a loss? 
About the only thing that might accomplish is to quiet the rhetoric that began when Martin's ear owner, Jack Housh, questioned how Gordon could run faster last Sunday after a two-tire change than other con­tenders could after changing four. 
What followed was a con­frontation between Roush and Gordon's crew chief, Hay Evernham, who denied the team illegally soaked tires in a solution that would soften the rubber and provide better grip. Evernham precipitated the lin­ger-pointing and hand-waving argument by going to Housh's garage after the CMT 300. 
It ended with Roush saying, "Get out of here." 
Evernharn has refused to dis·­cuss tires this week. Gordon said Thursday that even he was amazed with a run that quickly took h irn from 19th place to fifth without benefit of a caution period. 
"Nobody paid that much attention to us early," he said. "What (the crew) did to my ear was just amazing, allowing me to run the way we did." 
lJuring a radio appearance earlier in the week, Gordon called for Housh to apologize. 
'The only disappointing thing to me is Jack Housh took away 
from our win," he said. "I lost a lot of respect for Jack. "I hope he'll apologize to our team. They don't deserve that." 
A Roush spokeswoman said she knew of no plans for Roush to apologize. 
NASCAR said its preliminary examination of the tires showed nothing illegal. The tires have been sent out for a more thor­ough analysis, and those results are nol expected to be known for another week. 
'Taking the tires ofT pit row is no different than us lifting the hood and making an inspec­tion," Mike Helton, NASCAH's vice president for competition, said. "The innuendoes that were going around led us to say we'd better take a hard look at it." 
Gordon said he was glad NASCAR impounded the tires. 
"If anyone is going out there cheating and getting away with things, I don't know how they could live with themselves after­ward," he said. "Ray and guys on our team have a conscience, and want to do it fair and square." 
Whatever way they do it, if they do it Sunday, new entries will have to be made in the record book. 
A victory would extend Gordon's run in the oldest NASCAR superspeedway race to four years, rewriting the record he set by winning last year. He also would have 10 victories this year, making him the only dri­ver in NASCAR's modern era to reach double ligures three years in a row. 
It would be his 30th victory over the past three seasons, matching the 1981-83 run of three-time Winston Cup cham­pion Darrell Waltrip. Gordon also would have 37 victories over four seasons, matching the mark shared by Waltrip and seven-time series champion Hichard Petty.

AssoCiated Press 
DENVER While the recent health problems of his wife have ,,.been an obvious distraction, +..John Elway said Thursday he 
has had no second thoughts about returning for a final season. 
Janet Elway, 37, had a portion of her colon removed at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn.. on Aug. 6, ~ausing her husband to miss the Denver Broncos' first ex~Witlon game and several day~ oftraining camp. She was admitted to 
1 Columbia Swedish Medical . <;en,ter in Englewood last Friday to be treated for com­plications from the surgery, and was released on 
.• :rhursday.
+ "She's doing better," Elway said Thursday, adding that he didn't know if Janet would attend the Broncos' regular-season opener Monday night at Mile High Stadium against the New England Patriots. 
/ Asked if it has been diffi­cult to focus on football in rE!cent weeks, the Broncos quarterback said, "That's always tough. I mean, when you have things going on on the other fronts that are more important than this, it's tough to focus on things that are less important." 
Elway finally won a Super Bowl last January, then, after a long period of self­analysis, announced on June t that he would return for a 16th season. Subsequently, his wife's medical condition worsened. 
''I've got no second thoughts," he said. "I'm real­ly looking forward to playing this year, and we're going to go from there. 
"You never like to see any­body get in th'is situation. But when It came along, It allowed me to be able to both play football and spend time with hl~r. It being In the preseason now, who knows what would have happened had it been during the regu­lar season? 
"But there's nothing that's going to come up that's going to question me playing another year. So hopefully we've answered that ques­tion enough." 
Season openers, hl~ said, never get tiring. 
"That's because opening day seems to be so impor­tant," he said. "You can really get behind the eight· ball in a hurry if you don't win the opener.

At 38, Elway said he is "mentally better off than I was when I was 28, but there are some things I can't do physically. I was saying yesterday that it would be nice if I could feel the way I feel right now the rest of the season. But I know it's downhill from here.··

Roberts ties course record 
Associated Press 
MILWAUKEE 

With a brace around his lower back. some adjustments in his swing and a blistering 28 on the front nine. Loren Hobnrts held a three-shot !Pad after the open­ing round of the Greater Milwaukee Open on Thursday. 
HP also landed in the record books, tying the tournament r!'rord for Brown Deer Park Golf Course of 9-under par f>2 set in I996 by Nolan Henke. 
"I was perfect for nine holes and t!H~n I hit every green. I just really had a birdiP putt on ewry single hole," Hoberts said aftor playing under bright blue skies and conditions so calm that the cackle of a !'light of Canadian geese occasionally echoed across the fairways. 
"I feel comfortablo hnrc," he 

said. "The golf course fits my 
game .... You don't have to 
stand up there and rip it on 
every hole. You can kind of play 
position." 
Hoberts, 43. won the tourna­

ment in 1996 and was second 
last year and in 1994. the year 
play moved to Brown Deer from 
Tuckaway Country Club. 
Jay Don Blake was in second 

Thursday with 6-under~par 65. 
"It helped to start with four 

birdies. I helps your confi­
denee," Blake said. "I enjoyed 
watehing the board." 
Among those at S-under par were Mark Calcavecchia, searching for his first Milwaukee victory in his 18th appearance. 
PGA champion Vijay Singh. who played in the threesome with Hoberts. was among a crowdml field of finishers at 67. 
Steve Stricker, the hom estate favorite from nearby Madison, shot a 68. three days after his first child. daughter Bobbie Jean, was born. 
With little sleep because of what he called the "miracle" and excitement of fatherhood, Stricker, 31, said he was "in a fog for awhile" Thursday. "even found myself yawning" and had to talk to himself to remind him he was playing in a golf tourna­
ment. 
He didn't arrive at Brown 
Deer until about two hours 
before teeing off and has prac­
ticed little on some new things 
he wanted to try, he said. 
"I feel like I kind of crammed 
for a test and really have not 
prepared all that well," Stricker 
said. "But I didn't really have to 
worry about how I was playing 
because of what has happened 
the last few days." 
Defending champ Scott Hoch 
shot a 70. 
Hoberts was atop the leader­
board all day, finishing the front 
nine at 7 -under. which included 
live birdies and an eagle at No. 
4 after hitting a 4-wood shot 3 
1/2 feet from the cup.

Grassy Hill 
(Between Grotto and St. Mary's Lake) 
&:oo pm -10 pm 
Roberts, ranked 70th on the PGA money list with $348,108, said he last shot a 28 in New Zealand in 1978 while playing on the Australian Tour. 
For a time, lloberts thought 59 was possible, but he missed an 8-footer for birdie at 16 and pitched 20 feet above the hole at 18 from "no man's land" about 18 yards in front of the green. Roberts barely missed the downhill birdie putt coming back. 
"My goal was to at least get 10-under par," he said. 
At the 16th hole, Roberts' caddie scolded some people with cameras as Roberts lined up his putt, but Roberts refused to make excuses for what he .called a poor putt. 
"Hey, world-class players 
don't let that kind of thing both­
er them. If I want to be one of 
those, I have to forget about it," 
he said. 
Hoberts' stellar play came 
despite wearing a back brace 
and getting daily treatments for 
the soreness, he said. 
"I haven't been playing that 
good since I came back in the 
end of May. I made a huge 
adjustment in my golf swing last 
week and it kind of paid off in 
my play my last three rounds," 
he said. "I just feel good about 
making a couple of particular 
changes that seem to be work­
ing."

•LPGA 
Pak preparing for Golf Championship 
Associated Press 
PORTlAND, Ore. 
Se Ri Pak slipped almost unnoticed onto the practice green at Columbia-Edgewater Country Club and began to practice putting. Only a small group of Asian reporters, who have shadowed her every move this season, waited nearby. 
The attention surrounding Pak's phenomenal rookie sea­son has waned a bit the past several weeks as the 20-year· old South Korean goes through her version of a late-season slump. 
She won the first of her two 
majors this season, the 
McDonald's LPGA 
Championship, in May, then 
made a bigger splash in early 
July when she won a 20~hold 
playoff to capture the u.s. 
Women's Open. Just days later, 
she fired a 10-under-par 61 in 
the Jamie Farr Kroger Classic 
and finished with a 23-under­
par 261, the· lowest 72~hole 
score in the 48-year history of 
the LPGA. 
But after winning the Giant Eagle LPGA Classic in Ohio July .26, her fourth victory of the season, Pak had a relatively quietAugust. She was 41st in 
the du Maurier Classic, 34th in the Women's British Open and lOth in the State Farm Hail 
Classic.  In  between,  she  
skipped  two  other  tourna­ 
ments.  

"One day I play really great, but another day I play really bad. That is golf," said Pak, preparing for the $600,000 Sareway LPGA Golf Championship that begins Friday. ''But I just thinking two years, three years later, that time I know many things about many golf courses, this country. everything. But this year is first time. Everything is new. 
"I win two majors. That was good start. Good feelings. I have some more confidence in myself now." 
Pak, who turns 21 on Sept. 28, also is trying to deal" with the media better, but admits interviews are a strain, and seems perplexed by questions comparing her to Tiger Woods. 
"Every week, wherever I go it's busy with interviews," she says. "[ have bad things and good things. I am not emotion­less person. (Some) people think I'm perfect, everything's great, there's nothing difficult, everything going easy. It's not that easy. though;"

Top seeds Hingis, Sampras advance to third round 
A.sociatcd Press 
NEW YOHK 

The roar of jets passing over tlw U.S. Open took on an omi­nous tone Thursday. Players e h as i n g (~ r a 11 d SIam g I ory struggled with a tragie crash that nnarly elaimnd one of their own. 
While top-seeded Pete Sampras and Martina llingis rnaehod tho third round, ton­nis was mostly an after­thought as players roflneted on tho dangers they face while flying around the globe. 
"That's eertainly one of your biggest fears, to say goodbye 

muttered to himself' in Croatian and banged his head on the court after missing points. 
But he also won a point with a spectacular shot between his legs with his back to the net. 
'IWAS VERY NERVOUS IN 
THE BEGINNING. IT WAS 
VERY STRANGE COMING 
FROM LAST NIGHT NOT HAV­
ING PLAYED AND HAVING TO 
PLAY THE NEXT DAY.' 
MARTINA H!NG!S 
Other men's winners includ­ed No. 3 Patrick Harter, No. 6 Greg Husedski, No. 7 Alex Corretja, No. 9 Karol Kucera and No. 12 Jonas Bjorkman. Hafter, the defending champi­on, lost just seven games in his straight-sets victory over Hernan Gumy. 
Hingis' match had been scheduled for Wednesday night, but was wiped out by torrential rain and strong wind. 
She was inconsistent in the first set, bringing back memo­ries of her loss to Majoli in the 
1997 Freneh Open final. 
That was the only Grand 
Slam title llingis failed to win 
last year. 
"I was very nervous in the 
beginning," Hingis said. "It 
was Vl~ry strange eorning from 
last night not having played 
and having to play tho next 
day." 

Majoli was the aggressor in to your loved ones and not return," said Andre Agassi, who also won a second-round match. "When you travel the world like we do, you're bound to have your share of travel diffieulties. But you pray to God you don't have to go through something like that." 
llingis moved one step elos­er to defending her title with a 7-6 (7-4), 6-0 victory over Iva Majoli a few hours after hearing about the crash of Swissair Flight 111 off the Canadian eoast, killing all 229 people aboard. 
Hingis, a national heroine in

Doors open at 7:00pm 
her homeland of Switzerland, said she knows many Swissair flight attendants. 
"It was terrible to hear it," llingis said. "It's the airplane I fly the most. When I heard I was like, 'No way. Swissair seems very safe.' It's terrible to know you don't have any ehance up there." 
Marc Hosset, the top Swiss male player, had been set to return to Geneva on Flight 111 Wednesday night after losing in the first round. Instead, he stayed an extra day to practice with players still in the tourney. 
"It was a strange feeling when you know you just real­ize that for just changing your mind you are still alive," he said. "I think I am a little afraid, when you realize you were close to dying." 
Sampras, seeking his fifth 
U.S. Open crown, had 23 aces while overcoming early slop­piness to reach the third round with a 7-6 (7-4), 2-6, 6­3, 6-3 win over Paul Goldstein. 
Sampras had 43 unforced errors in the first two sets and double faulted on set point to lose the second set, but settled down in the final two sets.

Agassi, seeded eighth, strug­

match before defeating 
Guillaume Haoux 6-3, 6-2, 6-7 
(6-8), 3-6, 6-1, finishing the 
match with his 1Oth ace. 
The night match featured

the first set, moving llingis from side to side and slam­ming groundstrokes past the defending champion. 
llingis sighed loudly in exas­peration as she netted a fore­hand late in the first set, and her soft second serve was pummeled by Majoli. 
But, just as the groen con­crete of Arthur Ashe Stadium seemed to be turning into the red elay of Boland Garros, a jet flew noisily over the court to return the New York feeling and llingis made it clear this would be no Paris replay. 
After needing 45 minutes to win the first set, Hingis swept through the second in 20 min­utes. 
Just like the fly she swatted away in her post-match news conference, I-lingis had little trouble with Majoli after the tiebreaker. 
"I loosened up and every­thing started to go in," Hingis said. "I was strong and I didn't let her back in the game."

Stewart's four hits helps Jays top Red Sox, 4-3 
Associated Press 
TORONTO 

Shannon Stewart drove in the winning run with his fourth hit of' tlw ganw, and the Toronto Blue Jays beat the Boston Heel Sox 4-3 Thursday night for their seventh straight win. 
In the opener of a four-game series, the Blue Jays managed to overcome Pedro Martinez and moved within a half-game of ovflrtaking Texas for second place in the AL wild-card race. With a sweep, the Blue Jays would move within five games of the Red Sox, the wild-card leader. 
Martinez gave up three runs and seven hits in seven innings, struck out 11 and walked three. 
With the score 3-all in the 11th, Dario Veras (0-1) walked Tony Fernandez leading off. Craig Grebeck's one-out grounder advanced the runnPr and Veras, called up from the minors earlier in the day, hit Alex Gonzalez in the back with a pitch. Stewart then singled to short center. making him 4-f'or­5. 
Boston had put runners at second and third with one out in the top half against Carlos Almanzar. but Hohflrt Person (3-0), also brought up from the minors before the game, struck out DarrenLewis and Chris Snopek. 
Toronto starter Woody Williams allowed two runs and eight hits in seven innings. 
Boston, which has lost five of 

eight, went ahead in the fifth on 
consecutive doubles by Mike 
Benjamin and Darren Lewis. 
Toronto went ahead in the sixth 
on a two-run single Vv 
Fernandez, but John Valentin's 
homer tied the score in the sev­
enth. 
Jose Canseco blooped an RBI 

single that gave the Blue Jays a 
3-2 lead in the seventh, but 
Mike Stanley's run-scoring sin­
gle tied the score in the eighth. 
Twins 5, Devil Rays 4 
The Minnesota Twins at last 

won a game they trailed after 
eight innings. And they went 
extra lengths to do it. 
Todd Walker doubled and 

scored on Terry Steinbach's 
single in the 12th inning 
Thursday, giving the Twins a 5­
4 win over the Tampa Bay Devil 
Rays. 
A season-low crowd of 7,072 

at the Metrodome saw the 
Twins rally twice late in the 
game. Minnesota made it 3-all 
with a run in the ninth, and 
Matt Lawton's two-out homer

in the 10th tied it at 4. 
The Twins had been 0­65 when losing after the eighth. 
"That was a long one," Lawton said. "It's always better after those long ones when you win. Good timely hitting. Key hits are the thing." 
Walker led off the 12th with his second double of the game. Steinbach grounded a one-out sin­gle to center field, and Walker scored just ahead of Handy Winn's throw. 
Eddie Guardado (3-1) retired all seven batters he faced for the win. Hick White (1-5), who came on in the bottom of the 11th, took the loss.

Diamondbacks 1, Pirates 0 

Brian Anderson pitched a three-hitter for his first career shutout and the Arizona Diamondbacks finished off a three-game sweep of one-run games, beating the Pittsburgh Pirates 1-0 Thursday. 
Arizona won its team-record sixth straight game. The Pirates lost their sixth in a row and are one loss away from being math­ematically eliminated from the NL Central race. 
Matt Williams' two-out single in the third inning drove in the only run the left-handed Anderson (11-12) needed to outpitch Francisco Cordova (12­12), who struck out 10 while allowing only four hits. 
Anderson didn't allow a run­ner past second base while striking out three and, as usual, walking none. He has walked only seven since June 13 and his average of 1.2 walks per nine innings is tied with the Mets' Rick Reed as the best in the NL. 
It was the third victory in a 
row for Anderson, Arizona's 
first pick in the expansion draft 
in November. The 
Diamondbacks' longest winning 
streak was four until they 
swept the Pittsburgh series by 
winning 4-3, 2-1 in 11 innings 
and 1-0. 

It was thn Diamondbacks' third series sweep -they won thren each from Cincinnati June I(>-I R and Colorado July 17-19 -and kept them on a pace to finish with one of the best records by an expansion team. 
With 56 vir.tories, Arizona has more first-year victories than the Mets, Padres, Expos and Blue Jays and are two games ahead of Colorado's pace dur­ing the Rockies' 6 7 -win season in 1993. The Diamondbacks must win seven more times to avoid losing 100 games. 
Anderson was dominating, limiting the slumping Pirates to only Adrian Brown's single in the fourth and Jason Kendall's one-out double in the seventh. Anderson toughened up after Kendall's hit, striking out Kevin Young, who is two RBis short of 100, and getting Jose Guillen to fly out. 
Brewers 7, Rockies :1 
Milwaukee pitcher Brad Woodall homered and pitched six strong innings, and Dave Nilsson hit a pair of two-run homers Thursday night in the Brewers' 7-3 victory over the Colorado Rockies. 
Woodall (7-8), who got his 
first victory against Colorado 
after two losses, struck out 
sevnn and allowed three runs on nine hils. 
John Thomson (R-10). who did not allow a hit until tlw fourth inning, gavn up six hits and five runs in six innings. 
Milwaukee broke a 2-2 tie with thren runs in the fifth on home runs by Woodall and Nilsson. 
Woodall's first career home run, a solo shot to right, put the Bn~wers up 3-2. Mark Loretta walked with two outs and Nilsson followed with his sec­ond two-run shot of the game, his fifth in seven games. 
Burnitz hit a two-run homer, his 32nd, in the eighth, to make it 7-3. 
Nilsson tied the game 2-2 in the fourth with a two-run homer. lie drove in Loretta, who led off the inning with the Brewers' first hit of the game, an infield single.

Lockout could cause NBA season to be cancelled 
Associated Press 
PHOENIX 

Jerry Colangelo won't make any predictions about whether the NBA season will start as scheduled. He does say the league's owners are together in their belief that the salary sys­tem for players must change. 
"I think the owners are prob­ably more unified than I've ever seen them," the long-time owner of the Phoenix Suns said in an interview Thursday. 
Colangelo. a member of the NBA's negotiating committee with the players, said he has seen the labor dispute coming since the death of players' union chinf Larry Fleisher in 
1989. 
"There was stability. We 

knew how tough he was and yet Larry knew there was a time and a place to make a deal," Colangelo said. "Unfortunately, Larry passed away and since that time there's been a lot of changeover and a lack of stabil­ity.... It has led to this kind of shaky situation." 
The current labor showdown, he said, "was almost unavoid­able." 
Colangelo, also the managing general partner of baseball's Arizona Diamondbacks, said he often hears people wonder whether the NBA has learned anything from the devastating impact the baseball strike had on that sport. 
"Obviously we know how big the stakes are," Colangelo said. "We are certainly aware of 
Stars give Hitchcock a contract extension 
Associated Press 
liNING, Texas 
The Dallas Stars announced a three-year contract exten­sion Thursday for coach Ken Hitchcock. who led the team to the Western Conference finals this year before losing to Stanley Cup winner Detroit in six games. 
"We are really happy to have Ken under contract for the next four seasons," Stars president Jim Lites said. "We feel he is one of the top coach­es in the NIIL who has brought great stability to our team. We look forward to him having a long career behind the bench." 
Terms of the agreement, which extends through the 2001-2002 season. were not disclosed. llitchcock had one year, reportedly at $400,000, remaining on his contract. 
Hitchcock. 46. was named coach of the Stars in January 1996. 
During his first full season, the team came from last place to win the Central Division, before suffering a crushing first-round 1997 playoff loss 
to the Edmonton Oilers in seven games. 
The Stars returned this sea­son to win the Presidents' Trophy with the best record in the regular season (49-22-11) and the best road record at 23-14-4. 
The Stars advanced to the Western Conference finals for the first time since the fran­chise left Minnesota. 
Hitchcock has a career coaching record of 112-71-24. 
He began his NHL career as an assistant with the Philadelphia Flyers from 1990-1993 and then became coach of the Kalamazoo Wings. the Stars' minor league affiliate. 
Hitchcock took the reins of the Stars from then-coach and general manager Bob Gainey in the middle of the 1995-96 season. 
Gainey left the bench to con­centrate on his front office duties. 
A native of Edmonton, Alberta, Hitchcock attended the University of Alberta and worked at a sporting goods store before embarking on his coaching career.

what's taken place in collective bargaining in every sport. But you have to deal with reality. You have to deal with your own situation." 
That situation, he said, is a system that allows player salaries to soar out of control as more and more teams teeter on the brink of losing money. 
"The pie should be big enough for owners to have a right to make a profit and for players to do extremely well," Colangelo said. "They are the highest paid professional ath­letes and they will continue to be regardless of the kind of agreement that is made. But a stabilization must take place. 
"That's in the best interest of the entire league, so that the have-nots have a chance, and so the players on the roster ­those who are role players and even lesser players -have a chance to make some money. not just the stars." 
Colangelo said he will meet with other owners next week to discuss the situation. The own­ers also are awaiting an arbi­trator's ruling on whether they are required to pay players under existing contracts even though the league has imposed a lockout. That ruling is several weeks away. 
"I make no predictions about where we're going," Colangelo said. 
The owners would like to eliminate the so-called Larry Bird exception, which allows teams to exceed the salary cap to retain their own free agents. But Colangelo said, "There's always room for compromisn." 
"All we're looking for is east certainty," he said. "You must have the opportunity to make a profit. have a partnership and offer stability to the league. which in effect is in the best interest of the players, and it doesn't matter to me how we get there."

Vaughn pacing West leaders 
Associated Press 
SAN DIEGO 
Greg Vaughn could become just the ninth player in National League history to hit 50 home runs, yet end up as a mere footnote to the great chase by Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa. 
That's OK with the resurgent San Diego Padres' slugger. From a distant third place with a career-high 47 homers, Vaughn is enjoying the show, just likn everyone else. 
"I think it's ·awesome," said Vaughn, who has as many homers as Seattle's Ken Griffey Jr. 
MeGwire has 59, just two short of Hoger Maris' 1961 l'l~corcl of 61. while Sosa has 56. 
"Doing what they're doing is 
incredible. And it couldn't hap­
pen to two better guys," 
Vaughn said. 
The Padres have said the 
same thing about Vaughn, who 
struggl<ld so badly last year but

four months of this season before hitting a slump. 
Vaughn can connect in bunches, and he's doing it again. He's shattered Ken Caminiti's club record of 40, set during a red-hot run in 1996 that earned the third baseman unanimous selection as NL MVP. 
Vaughn passed his own career-best of 41 set in 1996, when he split the season between Milwaukee and San Diego. He's on pace to hit 54, but he really doesn't care. 
"I want to win a World Series," Vaughn said. 
This much is for sure ­Vaughn could be baseball's top homer hitter still playing in October if Sosa's Cubs don't win the NL wild card spot. 
Any combination of nine Padres wins or San Francisco losses will give the Padres their second NL West title in three seasons. 
"Leaving spring training, I never sit down and say, 'lley, I want to hit 57 home runs,"'Vaughn said. "Not once 
did that cross my mind. What crossed my mind is, what can I do to help our tPam win our division, get to the playoffs and get to the World Series? 
"So far we havn a pretty good stop on thn first part. winning our division. That's a team thing, that's something that wn all wantnd to aecomplish together.' 
On Aug. 4, Vaughn hit his 39th homer to pull within six of McGwire and thrne of Sosa. Alrnady in a slump that would see his average drop 37 points, Vaughn wnnt 11 games without a homer, his longest drought of the season. 
Vaughn hit live in four games in mid-July. llis 46th and 47th camn Tuesday night ol'f New York's Hideo Nomo, giving him seven in a stretch of I 0 starts. 
"I just think it's his swing," batting coach Merv Hettenmund said. "lin went through that one stretch of about two weeks when he did not swing well. When he swings well, he's a threat every swing. lie's swinging well right now."

Ben Leard under constant pressure. Auburn, which suf­fered just its second loss in 19 non-conference games under coach Terry Bowden, posted just 179 total yards and was forced to play nearly the entire game on its half of the field. 
"The plan didn't work," Bowden said. "The plan was to establish the running game and not to force the quarterback to throw all the time. We have to establish some type of running game." 
"I can't say enough about our 
defense," said Virginia eoaeh 
George Welsh. "Our guys up 
front did a great job." 
Todd Braverman added a 
pair of short field goals and 
Thomas Jones capped a bal­
anced offensive attack with a 
two-yard scoring run late in 
the game. The win avenged 
Virginia's 28-17 loss to Auburn 
in its home opener last season. 
In a first half dominated by 
defense, the only touchdown 
came with 5:27 left in the sec­
ond quarter. Brooks rollnd 
right and found Kevin Coffey, 
who caught the short pass, 
turned and raced into the end 
zone to complete a 61-yard 
scoring play. 
The last timn the Tignrs opened a season with a shutout loss at home was 1927, when they dropped a 6-0 verdict to Stetson. Auburn has been shut out in two of its last three 
home  games,  falling  to  
Mississippi State, 20-0,  on  
November 1st, 1997.  

Jones finished with 21 car­ries for 100 yards while Brooks completed 16-of-28 passes for 220 yards. Cof'f'ey's touchdown reception, on which he took advantagn of' a poor angln by Auburn defnnsive back Brad Ware, was his only catch of' thn game. 
"I felt pretty good tonight," said Brooks. "We havn a lot of' work to do on offense, but our defp,nsn helped us a lot tonight." 
Leard. a sophomore who threw just two passns last sea­son, was 11-of-25 for 14(J yards and Clifton Hobinson led all receivers with four catehes for 86 yards. 
"Anytimn you lose a game, it's tough," said Leard. "I never expeetnd to lose my lirst gamn. There were a lot of missed passes, but that was my fault. All of the incompletions, I put on myself."

Bledsoe eyes win 
against Broncos 
Associated Press 
FOXBORO, Mass. 

It may take Drew Bledsoe a while to get completely com­fortable with the new wrin­kles in the New England Patriots passing game. 
He doesn't have that kind of time, not with Monday night's season opener against the Denver Broncos, who have beaten the Patriots in their last 10 meetings. 
"We welcome the chal­lenge," Bledsoe said Thursday. "If we can step up and beat the champion from last year in the first game of the year, it will be a big step for us." 
With running back Curtis Martin now with the New York Jets and his replace­ment, rookie Robert Edwards, getting over a groin injury, the Patriots' early fortunes may depend -as they have so often -on Bledsoe's per­formance. 
He-got better as the exhibi­tion season progressed, but new offensive coordinator Ernie Zampese's emphasis on timing patterns in which Bledsoe throws before a receiver turns toward him is still sinking in. 
"He's been very sharp for the last m.on th of camp," Patriots coach Pete Carroll said. "We stuttered at the start of it all, but he and Ernie have come together and are hitting it good right now." 
Bledsoe, who went to his third Pro Bowl last season, didn't throw a touchdown pass until the final exhibition game, although he completed 5-of-7 for 33 yards in last Saturday's 24-7 win over Philadelphia, New England's third in a row. 
He averaged just 4.9 yards per attempt in five exhibition games, but said that wasn't necessarily a sign of weak­ness; one or two long comple­tions would have made that more respectable. 
His most important· task would appear to be smoothing out his timing with receivers who, in past seasons, had a chance to look back at Bledsoe before the ball was released. 
"We didn't have timing pat­terns last year. Now the quar­terback has to get rid of the ball before we even make our break," wide receiver Vincent Brisby said. "In the past, we'd see the ball come out of the quarterback's hand. Now we won't see that." 
So, with so little time to adjust to the ball, Brisby and the other receivers better have their hands in the right spot when they turn around. 
And Bledsoe better put the ball where their hands are. 
"We're comfortable with it," Bledsoe said. "There are parts of the passing game, a couple of routes, that we'll continue to improve on over the next few years. But that's only about two routes." 
A decent running game would keep the defense from focusing on stopping the pass, but there's no guarantee the Patriots will have one. 
Second-year pro Sedrick Shaw, a flop last year, will share time at running back with Edwards on Monday night. 
"With new, young running backs, it is all up to the guys up front," Bledsoe said. "The linemen need to carry the running game as these guys learn the ropes." 
With Martin sidelined for the last five games last sea­son, including two in the play­offs, the offense faltered. 
Bledsoe, who lost a fumble on the Patriots last play of a 7-6 loss at Pittsburgh, said he's gotten over that emotion­al blow. 
"I haven't thought about it for a while," he said. "We're moving on. The past doesn't concern us." 
There should be concern about the future, with Bledsoe still adjusting and the running game in transition. 
"The offense took some time to get going" in the exhibition season, Carroll said. "We are somewhere in the middle of what we will become on offense." 
See Monday's Observer for cover­age of this week­end's NFL games.

This weekend. the Notre Dame volleyball team will get its first real taste of competition whnn it takes on its first ranked oppo­
mmt. 
The Fighting Irish will host the Georgia Bulldogs and Colorado Buffaloes in tlH1 Shamrock Invitational. Georgia just missed being in the top 25 in the AVCNUSA Today preseason poll, whilf1 Colorado was ranked 12th. 
Both teams are familiar to the Irish. Last year. Notre Dame won its match against Gllorgia in four games. but fell to Colorado in three straight games. 
The Irish playNl their first match of tlw season Tuesday, winning handily over Valparaiso. But they are not nxpecting victo­ry to come quitf1 so easily this weekend. 
"I think this weekend will be really good for us," said junior outside hitter Mandi Powell. "We need competition like Colorado now so that we'll improve our level of play and be ready when it comes time for things like the NCAA Tournament." 
Tonight's match will be against Georgia at 8 p.m. in the Joycp, Center. Georgia has five of its six starters returning from last sea­son, and the Bulldogs have an experienced coach in Jim lams, who posts a 218-89 record in nine seasons as Georgia's head coach. 
"They're a much more physi­cal team than Valparaiso," said Notre Dame head coach Debbie Brown. "Their middle hitters are very effective at hitting the slide, and their outside hitters hit hard and strong. We have to not let their hitters hit for a real high percentage." 



Colorado and Notre Dame will 
face off on Sunday at 2 p.m. in 
the Joyce Center. The two teams 
are evenly matched, with both 
being knocked out of the NCAA 
Tournament in the third round 
last season. 

Top returnees for· the Buffaloes include senior outside hitter Sarah Lodge and junior setter Kelly Campbell. The Irish will try to shut down Lodge, who is Colorado's main hitter, and put up a strong defense against Campbell's aggressive play. 
"They're even more experi­enced than Georgia," said Brown. "They run a balanced attack and have a very good and competitive setter." 
Last week. Colorado head coach Pii Aiu said about the match, "! don't think pre-season rankings mean a whole lot. We're two pretty similar teams playing each other. I think Debbie Brown is one of the best coaches in the nation. It's going to be a tough match." 
Notre Dame is aiming to mini­mize its errors in this wnekend's tournament. Brown will look to sophomore setter !)(mise Boylan and senior middle blocker Lindsay Treadwell to lead the attack this wnekend. Both play­ers had strong showings against Valparaiso Tuesday, and are among the most nxpnrienced players for Notre Dame. 
"We need to play our own game," said Tnladwell. "Sometimes we got caught up in playing our opponfmts' game when we should concentrate on our own side of the net. We have to force them to make errors and shake off their good plays. We know how they play and what to expect." 
Victories over Georgia and Colorado would be key confi­dence-boosters for the Irish heading .into a tough match next weekend against seventh-ranked Wisconsin.

teams until the addition of Penn State in 1990. 
With respect to the confer­ence, adding a twelfth team gives the Big Ten the ability to spit into two divisions and form a conference championship game. With teams like Ohio State, Michigan, Michigan State, Penn State and Notre Dame competing for one title, the profits and attention would be enormous. 
"I like the idea of having a playoff gamn at the end of the year," Northwestern coach Gary Barnett commented. "If Notre Dame were to come into the confnrence, it would absolutely establish us as the top conference in the country." 
Other benefits for the Irish are just as strong. In addition to the exposure that the Big Ten offers in football, the Irish teams currently represented in the Big East would also join the Big Ten. 
The University joined the Big East in 1995 in such sports as men's and women's soccer, men's and women's basketball, volleyball, softball and base­ball. Despite the membership, tiHl Irish remain independent in football. 
One of tlw more obvious rea­sons for the change is geo­graphical. The Big East confnr­ence represents 15 teams, yet none or thnm are as far west as Notre Dame. As a member of the Big East, Notre Dame plays most of its contests against tnams that are located further away than the midwestern schools that belong to the Big Ten. 
"If wn joined the Big Ten, we'd be driving to most games instead of flying," said women's soccer head coach Chris Petrucelli. "We'd save a lot of time, and costs on our budgets." 

The move would also align the Irish football team in a con­ference that eurrently has live of the top 25 teams in the nation, including No. 1 (Ohio State) and No. 5 {Michigan). A merger of the Big Ten and Notre Dame would bring tlw school's national constituency and the league's spotlight together to shine on the Irish. 
But perhaps the biggest question still unanswered deals with the television spotlight. Notre Dame and the NBC net­work have an existing contract 
'IFNOTRE DAME WERE 
TO COME INTO THE CON­
FERENCE, IT ABSOLUTELY 
WOULD ESTABLISH US AS THE 
TOP CONFERENCE IN THE 
COUNTRY.'

through the 2005 season, while ABC will broadcast Big Ten games through 2007. Rumors have flown that a conl'lict of broadcasting rights between 2005 and 2007 will be prob­lematic, but if precedent holds, then that won't be the ease ­the conference allowed Penn State to linish out its contract with CBS when it joined in 1990. 
The biggest concern comes from the national audience that tunes in to watch the Irish every football weekend. ABC, which broadcasts games regionally, would come into conflict with Notre Dame fans wanting to watch tlw Gold and Blue. 
The transition to a new con­ference isn't something new for the Irish. As one of the newest teams in the Big East. Notre Dame made the move from the Midwest Collegiate Conf(mmce (MCC) in 1995. 
"Our transition from the MCC to the Big East was easy," Petrue1~1li said. "lAndi we already play four or five of Ithe teams in tlHl Big Ten], so it wouldn't be an obstacle to us." 
With both sides working out a possible invitation to remodel both the league and Irish ath­letics, neither is rushing to make a decision. Either way, plans are expected to be final­ized by the end of the year. 
"My hopes are that by fall or this winter that something will come of it or something will not," said Delany. "Obviously, there arc mutual interests to explore. But I don't think we want to make an ongoing process out of it. Wn need to reach a conelusion." 
Officials from both the league and the university will have the decision on their minds this weekend, as will Michigan head coach Lloyd Carr: 
"I think it would be great if it was a Big Ten Conference game. We play them every year anyway, so we might as wPll count it in the schedule. In terms of the national rankings it certainly has a major impact." 
Notre Dame fans will have to wait and see if their team will have an impact on the field and in the eonl'enmees.

Irish have high hopes for '98 NO could be close 
By BRIAN KESSLER Assistant Sports Ediror 
The Notre Dame women's soccer team is looking to make a run for the title once again this season after making appearances in thfl semifinals of the NCAA championships the past four seasons. 
The second-ranked Irish are off to a quick start after blank­ing Ohio State in an exhibition game at Alumni Field and shutting out Michigan State on the road in the season opener. 
The Irish cruised to a 9-0 victory against the Buckeyes in the preseason, behind hat tricks by Jenny Streiffer and Anne Makinen. The Irish fol­
.,. lowed up that win with a 4-0 victory in East Lansing. The women are now set to open play against conference opponents West Virginia and Pittsburgh. "We weren't particularly happy with our play in the last game," sophomore Mentis Erikson said. "But we are excited to play and we're con­lident that we can pick up our game." Last year, the Irish boasted shutouts against both the Mountainers and the Panthflrs, winning those games on the road by scores of 3-0 and 5-0, respectively. This season, West Virginia comes to town with 
ready to perform. Of special importance to the team are the Big East contests, which will culminate in the Big East Tournament at the end of the season. 
"Big East teams mean a whole lot more," co-captain Matt Johnson said. "Winning there, especially in the Big East Championships, gives us an NCAA Championship berth." 
Notre Dame's Big East play gets underway this Saturday at Syracuse. The Orangemen also began their season with a non­Big East matchup last Tuesday. The similarities between the teams end there, as Lafayette scored a goal in each half of the contest to defeat the Orangemen at home, 2-0. 
Syracuse captains Michael Correll and Gabriel Gervais lead their squad at home against the Irish. Gervais, a junior forward, lead last year's team with 10 goals and five assists. Correll. a senior, tacked on two goals and three 
assists  last  season  for  
Syracuse.  
The  Irish will  count on  

Tuesday's top scorers to once again lead the way on the road. Senior Ben Bocklage net­ted two goals and an assist

conference has approached since expansion talks began last April. Still, reports eon­firm that the Irish and the Big Ten have already broken tlw icc, and arc deeper into nego­tiations than reported. 
And if Notre Damn is indfJed considering the decision, the conference's appr.al is undeni­able. Besides giving the Irish some new and tough tenms to play, the move would pit the Irish against an old. intense rival almost every week -like Miehigan, Penn State University, Northwestern University and Ohio State University, to name a few. 
The Big Ten Conference was established in 1896, with the University of Chicago, University of Illinois, Michigan, University of Minnesota, Northwestnrn, Purdue University, and the University of Wiseonsin serving as ehar­ter members. Indiana University and the University of Iowa joined the league in 1899 and Ohio StatB in 1912, bringing the tally to 10 t1~ams.

As Notre Dame and longtime rival Michigan take to the foot­ball field this Saturday, Notre Dame may be inching eloser to making such games a regulari­ty. 
Notre Dame has reportedly been involved in talks with the Big Ten Athletic Conference about the possibility of the Irish joining the conference as twelfth team. 
Athletic director Mike Wadsworth could not be reached for comment. but the University has denied having any intention of joining the Big Ten. But both the University and the Big Ten have not gone beyond stating that the two sides have "exchanged infor­mation." 
"There has been no invita­tion tendered (by the Big Ten) and no invitations asked for (by Notre Dame)," said Big Ten commissioner Jim Delany in early August at the league's annual Kickoff Luncheon. "We're just exchanging infor­mation. There has been noth­
