These jokes came as quite a surprise to me. Before moving into Saint Mary's, I did not know anyone who had ever attended. 
I did, however, know a few Notre Dame alums. In all of my discus­sions with them, Notre Dame's dis­taste for Saint Mary's girls never came up. 
They seemed just as proud as I was that I had chosen to attend a school like Saint Mary's. In case you haven't heard, Saint Mary's is number one in its category. This means that we have a reputation for being a great school as well. 
My college search ended when I visited Saint Mary's. No, I did not apply to Notre Dame and get rejected, therefore settling for Saint Mary's. I choose this school without any consideration for Notre Dame. All of us did not set­tle. 
I am confident that my education will prepare me in the best way possible to impact the world. Saint Mary's has a number of great pro­grams in which many Notre Dame students take part. 
Considering how wonderful Saint Mary's is on its own, I needed no extra persuasion. Therefore, Notre Dame had no bearing on my deci­sion to come to South Bend. This means that I am not looking for a husband, and my goal in life is not to get my M.R.S. degree. 
I am not spending my time scouring Notre Dame for boys-I don't want to steal them from you. It is also not my fault that we have a reputation, so please, when you hear I am from Saint Mary's, guys, keep your smirks to yourself, and girls, keep your dirty looks as well. I am just looking to get a great education from a superb women's college and have a good night every so often. I am not out to take anything from you. 
Although you may not be fond of me, I have respect for Notre Dame, its students and its traditions. I am thankful that I have the opportuni­ty to take part in all that your cam­pus has to offer, including The Observer and I love taking pictures so that everyone can see what is happening on my little campus across the street. 
I know many wonderful Notre Dame students, and I hope to know many more. So please, the next time my friends and I catch the "sluttle," oops I mean shuttle ­give us a chance. We are no differ­ent than you.

OTHO, Iowa -Hain, snow and sleet won't keep the mail from being deliv­ered. But mold? The post office in this small north­ern Iowa town has been closed since Dec. 8 after a black mold fungus called Stachybotrys was found in the building. 
Now, the town's 575 residents must travel eight miles to Fort Dodge to get their mail.

San Francisco may charge for grocery bags 
SAN FRANCISCO -San Francisco may become­the first city in the nation to charge shoppers for grocery bags. 
The city's Commission on the Environment is expected to ask the mayor and board of supervisors Tuesday to consider a 17­cent per bag charge on paper and plastic grocery 
bags. While the goal is reducing plastic bag pol­lution, paper was added so as not to discriminate. 
"The whole point is to encourage the elimination of waste, not to make people pay more for gro­ceries," said Mark Murray, executive direc­tor of Californians Against Waste. 
Environmentalists argue that plastic bags jam machinery, pollute water­ways and often end up in trees.

The largest campus effort was the Tsunami Helie!' Drivn, which a variety of eampus groups sponsored. The drive included collections in LaFortune, at athlntic events and in the dorms. It coneluded with a bene­fit buffet dinner of Asian food and silent auction of handcrafted goods from the Asian and African regions. 
Donny llanjaya-Putra, a Fisher Hall sophomore from Indonesia who was at Notre Dame when the tsunami hit, was a chid planner for the event. 
"It's so amazing to watch and experience how many people on this cam pus really care ­enough to come together in this event of solidari­ty," he said. 
llanjaya-Putra said he was motivated to help after enduring the painful experienen of watching the tsunami from afar.

resented," Barkes said. 

"The Philharmonic wanted some seats -they did not know how many people would be coming." Freshman Franciso Castillo said organizers seriously underestimated student demand and he was not hopeful about receiving a ticket. 
''I'm quite concerned.... It's unfair. The University should try to just do more than one performance." 
Barkes said students and other individuals picked in the lottery would be e-mailed about their status during the next couple days. During winter break, the PAC sent an e-mail explaining the lottery process in which each student chosen would be able to purchase a single ticket. 
Students in the lottery had mixed reactions to the lottery system. 
"At least we're getting a fair chance," said graduate student Belinda Byrne. "I would've preferred it if there had been two tickets [per winning lottery number]." 
Because this was one of the first high-profile events of its kind at the PAC, Barkes said it was difficult to anticipate student interest exactly but organizers expected it to be high. 
''I'm certainly pleased with the numbers of students that respond­ed," he said. 
This performance marks the first time the PAC has used a lottery for student tickets, Barkes said. 
"With the exception of very few events, students have been able to get into everything they've wanted to get into," he said. 
Although not particularly con­cerned about the lottery process, sophomore Margaret Auer said she intended to wait for the results and hoped to be chosen. 
"It's something I personally was really interested in," she said.

Forces capture 'lethal' al-Qaida leader 
Associated Press 

BAGHDAD, Iraq -Iraqi security forces have arrested the "most lethal" top lieutenant of al-Qaida's leader in Iraq -a man allegedly behind most of the car bombings in Baghdad since the U.S.-Ied inva­sion, including the 2003 assault on 
U.N. headquarters that killed 22 people, the prime minister's office said Monday. 
Sami Mohammed Ali Said al-Jaaf. also known as Abu Omar al-Kurdi, was arrested during a Jan. 15 raid in Baghdad, a government state­ment said Monday. Two other mili­tants linked to Jordanian-born Abu 
Musab al-Zarqawi's terror group also were arrested, authorities announced Monday. 
Al-Jaaf was "the most lethal of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi 's lieu­tenants," the statement said. 
Al-Zarqawi heads ai-Qaida in Iraq, the terror network's local affiliate. The group is behind many of the car bombings, beheadings, assassinations and other attacks driving the insurgency in Iraq. 
The suspect was linked to the August 2003 bombing of U.N. head­quarters in Baghdad, which killed the top U.N. envoy in Iraq, Sergio Vieira de Mello, and 21 others. The 
U.N. attack was "planned and 

directed by two others affiliated with Abu Omar," the statement said. 
Al-Jaaf was responsible for 32 car bombing attacks that killed hundreds of Iraqis, the statement said. Al-Jaaf "confessed to building approximately 75 percent of the car bombs used in attacks in Baghdad since March 2003," said Thaer al-Naqib, spokesman for interim Prime Minister Ayad Allawi. 
"Abu Omar al-Kurdi claims responsibility for some of the most ruthless attacks on Iraqi police forces and police stations," ai­Naqib said.

FCC rejects w-atchdog group's con1plaints 
Members counter 36 objections of indecency filed by parents against popular TV shows 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -Regulators rejected 36 complaints of inde­cency Monday against popular TV shows including "Friends" and "The Simpsons." 
The objections had been filed with the Federal Communications Commission by the Parents Television Council, a watchdog group that frequently complains about sex and violence on tele­vision. 
"In context, none of the seg­ments were patently offensive under contemporary commu­nity standards for the broad­cast medium, and thus not indecent," the agency said in a statement. The FCC also ruled "the material was not profane, in context." 
Three members of the five­member FCC approved the orders: Chairman Michael Powell and Kathleen Abernathy, both Republicans; and Democrat Jonathan 
Adelstein.  The  "In what  likely to be lis­

The council alleged in the 36 complaints that the programs which aired between Oct. 29, 2001, and Feb. 11, 2004 con­tained sexually explicit seg­ments or used indecent or pro­fane language that violated indecency standards. 
One complaint involved an episode of NBC's "Friends" that aired in May 2003. In it, a female character, her husband and the husband's ex-girl­friend talk about a fertility treatment at a medical office. 
A complaint over "The Simpsons," which airs on Fox, included a scene from a November 2003 episode in which students carried picket signs with the phrases "What would Jesus glue?" and "Don't cut off my pianissimo."

Supretne Court ends long battle 
Justices deny appeal, refuse to keep woman alive on life support 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON The Supreme Court refused on Monday to step in and keep a severely brain-damaged woman hooked to a feeding tube, all but ending a long­running right-to-die battle pit­ting her husband against her parents. 
It was the second time the Supreme Court dodged the politically charged case from Florida, where Hepublican Gov. Jeb Bush successfully lob­bied the Legislature to pass a law to keep 41-year-old Terri Schiavo on life support. 
The decision was criticized as "judicial homicide" by Mrs. Schiavo's father, Robert Schindler, but applauded by her husband, Michael Schiavo, who contends his wife never wanted to be kept alive artifi­cially. 
The court's action is very narrow, affecting only Schiavo. 
More broadly, sometime after returning from their win­ter break, the justices will consider the Bush administra­tion's request to block the nation's only law allowing doc­tors to help terminally ill patients die more quickly. Oregon voters passed that law in 1998, and more states could follow if justices find that the federal government cannot punish doctors who prescribed lethal doses of federally con­trolled drugs. 
Terri Schiavo was 26 when she suffered brain damage in 1990 after her heart tern­porarily stopped beating because of an eating disorder. 
Most of the legal wrangling in the case has involved whether she is in a persistent vegetative state with no chance of recovery and whether her husband has a conflict of interest because he lives with another woman and has two children with her. 
The legal battle. between Mrs. Schiavo's husband and parents began in 1993 and appeared to reach its climax in 2003 when Michael Schiavo won a court decision ordering that the feeding tube be removed. But it was reinserted six days later, after the Legislature passed "Terri's Law." 
The Florida Supreme Court ruled that the law was an unconstitutional effort to override

president of the United States. That was a very, very difficult and imposing fight. He was very relieved that the rule of law prevailed," Felos said. 
Mrs. Schiavo, who has lived in nursing homes, can breathe on her own but depends on a feeding tube to stay alive because she cannot swallow on her own. She left no writ­ten directive. Her parents con­tend their son-in-law is trying to rush her death so he can inherit her estate and be free to marry again. The Schindlers lost an emergency Supreme Court appeal in 2001. 
The case now goes hack to state Judge George Greer, who already has ruled the feeding tube can be removed. 
"While there are still legal

George Felos, the attorney for Michael Schiavo, said his client will have his wife's feed­ing tube removed as soon as pending appeals are over and a stay is lifted. 
"You've got to look at it from his perspective -he's a citi­zen living in Clearwater (Fla.) and up against the weight of the governor and Legislature of the state of Florida -a governor whose brother is American Center 
for Law and Justice chief counsel who rep­resented the Schindlers at the Supreme Court. 
The Schindlers were in Washington on Monday, par­ticipating in a right-to-life march organized as part of the 32nd anniversary of the Supreme Court's decision legalizing abortion. 
Ken Connor, one of-the lawyers who represented Bush at the high court, said: "The reality is that in Florida, con­victed capital felons receive more due process protection than Terri Schiavo has received in this case." 
broadcasts present a much closer call," he said. 
Powell announced last week he was leaving the FCC in March. Martin, who has been rumored to be among candi­dates to replace him as chair­man. did not comment Monday but said he would issue a statement at a later date. 
An FCC official said the 36 complaints were grouped together because they all dealt with the Parents Television Council, but the official did not comment about why com­plaints filed by the group over other shows were not includ­ed. 
Lara Mahaney. a spokes­woman for the council, said her group has complaints about dozens of other shows pending. 
"In what community in Ameriea are graphic terms for genitalia decent?" Mahaney said. "The commission's ruling Jackson's "wardrobe malfunc­tion" at last year's Super Bowl halftime show. 


The FCC received more than 1 million indecency complaints in 2004, most of them involv­ing the exposure of Jackson's breast during her perform­ance. Fines for indecent pro­gramming exceeded $7.7 mil­lion last year. a huge increase from the $48,000 imposed in 2000, the year before Powell became chairman. 
Powell has said the crack­down was in response to mounting complaints from consumers and Congress. 
Copps criticized Monday's rulings as "rather cursory decisions" that did not address the objections of viewers nor. those of skittish broadcasters worried about what may be too racy to air. lie singled out concern for a movie that aired on ABC in May 2003, "The Diary of Ellen Himbauer."

Despite long delays and Friday's bliz­zard, our small group managed to make it out to Washington for last week's Inauguration. It was great to be back out in Washington to see the spec­

Texans gettmg m the way of native Confessions of Washingtonians on a Campus the Metro, as well Conservative 
the glare of some lib­erals clinging to their "Kerry Edwards" buttons in some form of therapy. 
From my experiences of the city in our Washington Program, I could easily pick out the D.C. natives against the throngs of tourists. Sometimes I could not help but get mad myself as large groups of various fellow red state vot­ers clogged up the escalators and vio­lated many parts of what I learned to be the unwritten rules of east coast eti­quette. As I began to notice some trends in the behavior of the two groups, I began my own version of an informal social science study through observation. 
Despite all this, the throngs of red states had some very surprising and redeeming qualities that I didn't see in their D.C. counterparts. At many ran­dom times on the Metro, -some would say hello and start a conversation. They also felt very comfortable dress­ing in some of the tackiest souvenir sweatshirts and hats I have ever seen. All of these traits were very stereotypi­cally American, and in our grand tradi­tions of being the ever annoying tourists. 
With the exception of a few privi­leged donors, the people attending this inauguration were not a group of aloof billionaires. They were the kind of friendly Midwesterners and Southerners I have learned to love in my experiences of America. 
Collectively, they share in the pain of those who have unfortunately lost loved ones in Iraq. At many of the Inaugural Balls, Veterans were hon­ored for their service and given free invitations. Debunking yet another myth of Hepublicans, we did not cele­brate this inauguration aloof to the sacrHices that brave heroes have made. 
At the Indiana Ball, the so-called "evil corporations" sponsoring this event paid for veterans and their fami­lies to attend for free. The Toyota Corporation has even started a pro­gram under which employees called to Iraq for service will keep their full pay and benefits for the duration of their tour of duty. Although expensive, these parties were not the obscure elitist playgrounds liberals wish to depict them as, but places where service and volunteerism were celebrated. 
The efforts of the left to simplify our party to radical Christians and heart­less slaves to corporate interests are just not true. Republicans celebrating in Washington last week all shared somehow in the service of their coun­try. Indeed, there was some of the wealthy minority in attendance who could best help the party through gen­erous donations. Aside from that, many of us in attendance put many volunteer hours in on campaigns, worked phone banks and walked door to door to push for an agenda we believed in. 
Before I ramble on any longer, I should draw to the conclusion of my experiment in observation. What sets the red state voters apart from others'? l draw the difference as optimism in America itself. This optimism thanks God we are not standing idly by wait­ing for the terrorists to take the first move on us. It is an optimism that does not think itself above manifesting itself in tacky merchandise and cowboy hats to show pride in the greatest country on earth. It screams they are proud to be American and do not care about the opinions of the world community while doing what is right. It is an optimism that was foolish enough to believe over 200 years ago that 13 colonies could challenge the British Empire. 
That optimism and hope for the future is what has made the United States the superpower it is today. When the rest of the world turns their back on the hard road of doing what is unpopular, the United States will be there to roll up her sleeves and do what is necessary. The war in Iraq will not get any easier. but once again we will show the world the folly of the cowardice of those who hid behind the banner of the League of Nations before World War II, and hide as well today behind the United Nations in the face of terrorism and global weapons of mass destruction proliferation. 
I happened to turn on an IIBO docu­mentary after the Inauguration about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In it, Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu explained that, "The only true test of leadership is risking failure in the pur­suit of doing what you believe is right."

Status: Young peoplo strive for status by assodating thnmselves with people who have status and tlu1 values honored by those peo­ple. In eoHege, that moans intellectuals, dem­ocratic: politicians and entertainers. By com­mitting thornselvos to liberal values, youth sook to acquirn value. This is understand­ablo, hneausn without status, one doesn't havo any agtmey, and without agnncy, life has little moaning. 
Stability: Liberalism offers the young, oiTnndml by moral shadns of gray (the Iraq war, for exarnplo), a sturdy, simple frame­work for understanding the philosophical, soda! and twtm physical ordor of things. 
Snlr-esteem: What young adult doesn't like lwing told "good job" by approving authority ligurns? When those authority ligures are ovnrwhnlmingly liberal, the dearest route to positivn reinl'oreemnnt involves dev'eloping and nxpressing sensibilities that professors arn llattered with, as opposHd to challenged by. 
Sncurily: Being frivolously accused of nverything from racism to xenophobia by activist students is no way to spend four years of eollegn (especially when teaching assistants reel powerless about discouraging disruptive behavior). Disassociating from unpopular conservativn philosophy will shel­ter most students from this type of degrading treatment by their penrs. 
Legitimacy: Many students get their first taste of the adult world of polities through collnge. To new converts, no matter how small of a di!Ternnee they make, or even if tlwy negativnly affect America, participating in bohnm ian protests and echoing all tho philosophins society has deemed "progres­sive" produens a strong feeling that one is eontributing to the social good. 
Undiplomatic immunity: In the past, defin­ing grievances in liberal terms, no matter how exaggerated they were, allowed students a forum to exercise their most destructive drives with minimal repercussions. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, groups such as the Students for Democratic Society harassed professors and other students, burned books and took over buildings, fear­ing nothing more than an occasional expul­sion from conl'liet-phobic administrators (as for National Guard troops, that's another story). Liberals know this, whieh is why they romanticize the Vietnam War era. EvPn today, liberal acting out is often rewarded in the long run. Liberals know that Michael Moore is a liar and a propagandist, but they eeho his arguments and buy his movies any­way. 
Empathy: Liberalism offers a form of love contingent on the ability to portray one's self as a vietim of a callous American culture. Bocause it's neeessary to at least maintain the appearance of victimhood to become the focus of liberal kindness, liberalism encour­ages grievance-collecting or worse. 
In ease you haven't heard, llarvard University President Larry Summers suggest­ed during a eonferenee diserimination may not be keeping women from earning top posi­tions in the sciences at upseale universities. lie listed other possible rpasons for under­representation could be innate biological dif­ferences between men and women and that perhaps women haven't been willing to sacri­f'iee family for eareer as readily as men have. One alleged professional, biologist Nancy Hopkins, walked out of the eonferenee, explaining afterward she "would have either blacked out or thrown up" had she stayed. Liberals could have let her know it's a little pathetic to claim being offended can make one blaek out or throw up. Instead, liberals aceepted Hopkin's hyperbole and legitimized her pettiness, as well as the presumption that Summers couldn't have said the things he did in good faith. 
Blatant patronization may be low, but it still feels good to be on the receiving end of it. 
In contrast, universities only offer conser­vatives the distinction of not being part of the drooling mob and a lot or headaches. 
No wonder students are liberal.

'Closer' seduces with dark outlook on relationships 
By MARY SQUILLACE Scene Critic 
Trust. Honesty. Forgiveness. While these traits are generally closely associ­ated with love, they have no place in director Mike Nichol's ("The Graduate, "Angels in America") examination of relationships. In his film "Closer," love is not blind. It's naked and complicated and often wielded deviously. The film is an adaptation of Patrick Marber's hit play. Following its 1997 debut in London, the play received rave reviews and continued to garner awards when it opened in the United States. 
The cast consists of only four charac­ters and does not feature one central protagonist. Instead, the emphasis is placed on the characters' interactions with each other. 

ty. The film tracks the deeply entwined and overlapping characters through as they thrive, falter and ultimately fail in love. 
The story unfolds at a rapid, but steady pace. This way the film manages to address the taboo topics like sex and adultery without sensationalizing them. Additionally, to do justice to the intensity of Marber's screenplay, Nichol creates palpable tension and depth with deliber­ate and unique stylistic tactics. 
Asserting people typically remember only the beginnings and endings of rela­tionships, Nichol represents each rela­tionship only with its beginning or end­ing. In this way, he presents just enough information to keep his viewers informed, without overwhelming them with unnecessary details.

cast members rise to the occasion, and turn-out complex, compelling performances. 
For her role as Anna, Roberts sheds her toothy grin and typical charm, and instead relies on her ability to subtly con­vey guilt and deceit. Similarly, Law exhibits his range, as he takes on a role that is vastly different from his recent roles in "I Heart the Huckabees" and "Cold Mountain." Portman, a rising star in Hollywood, proves herself worthy of her recent Golden Globe with a focused and convincing performance. 
However, in spite of being the least rec­ognizable of the cast, the film's other Golden Globe recipient, Owen (who origi­nally played Dan in the London stage production) arguably delivers the film's best performance. At times his character teeters on the brink of self-destruction, and Owen appropriately adopts an air of raw desperation, gaining the audience's trust and sympathy. 
In other scenes, he changes his approach in order to capture Larry's cal­culating and vindictive side. Overall, Owen's seemingly effortless malleability effectively embodies the complexity of the character. The collective work of the cast lends itself to a powerful finished product. 
With "Closer," Nichols creates a seduc­tive starkness that tempts the viewer to fully engage him or herself, by making assumptions, evaluations and judgments. The nature of this tale is one that undoubtedly lingers long after the screening, as it presents a disconcerting but gripping commentary on relation­ships.

'Noise' fails in hackneyed attempt at success 
By MARK BEMENDERFER 
Scene Critic 
In many instances, Hollywood is a lot like a math course. For instance, Hollywood directors and writers often theorize, test and debate with their films. "White Noise" is one such exam­ple of Hollywood grasping at straws in an attempt to piece together a hit film. In "White Noise," director Geoffrey Sax and writer Niall Johnson show they have a firm grasp on hackneyed formu­las. 
"White Noise," under the combined might of Sax and Johnson, is another uninspired, formulaic piece of Hollywood designed to capitalize on the success of "The Ring," "The Sixth Sense" and most recently, "The Grudge." And 

Keaton, an actor probably most famous for his role in director Tim Burton's Batman movies, does a com­mendable job. Curiously absent from movies in recent years, he is one of the few saving graces within the movie. Keaton is well-suited for the part, hav­ing a knack at playing mentally­obsessed, slightly crazed individuals. He is one of the few actors in Hollywood that is almost always enjoyable to watch. 
Keaton does a decent job in his role, as do most of the principal actors. However, while they are given decent roles to fill, the actual story their char­acters inhabit feels very lacking at times. The last half hour of the movie is especially perplexing, as events just seem to happen for little to no reason. The movie definitely ends on a poor

the audience with an unexpected ending. And while the twist isn't quite as bad as the one in 'The Village," it still seems hurried and poorly done. The ending is the most important part of the movie, as it is the last thing viewers get to see. So while the first half of the movie was actually pretty good, the second half taints the entire movie. 
Some credit has to go to the writer though. Johnson has seen enough suc­cessful movies to attempt his own and follows their formulas pretty closely. Some of his plot points are fulfilling towards the end of the film. However, other situations that arise near the film's conclusion were not set up in the least, diminishing the ending. They feel simply tossed into the mix for shock value, which itself wasn't that great. 

The ending does make sense if you think of the films "White Noise" tries to emulate. When you look at the formulas of this film's predecessors, the ending becomes mandatory. 
In the case of "White Noise," the end­ing runs counter to what the movie had previously spent so much time setting up. But who wants to let little details like plot get in the way of proven formu­las?

No. 12 Tar Heels upset top-ranked Blue Devils 
After 12 straight losses to nemesis in ACC, UNC triumphs 56-51 
Associated Press 
CHAPEL HILL, N.C. -For a change, North Carolina made Duke look rattled, and not even a spectacular indi.vidual effort by Monique Currie was enough to save the top-ranked Blue Devils. 
Leah Metcalf had a pair of clutch baskets and Ivory Latta sealed it with two free throws in the final seconds, helping the 12th-ranked Tar Heels end nearly five years of misery in this Tobacco Road "We knew they . rivalry with a 56­

Conference) snapped a 12­game losing Sylvia Hatchell streak in the 
Duke coach 

series by limiting Duke (18-2, 4-1) to a season-low point total, which included only 13 in the first half. That was two more than the school record set against Maryland in the 1981 Atlantic Coast Conference tournament. 
The loss ended the nation's longest winning streak at 16 games, and it was the first win for the Tar Heels in 20 tries against a top-ranked team. 
"Their pressure really both­ered us, their traps," Duke coach Gail Goestenkors said. "We didn't do a good job adjusting. The tougher team won, and they played tough. They were the aggressor for the most part." 
Latta led North Carolina with 13 points, and Nikita Bell and La'Tangela Atkinson added 12 apiece. 
Currie, held to two points in the first half, scored 1 7 of her 24 in a 5 1/2-minute span down the stretch. She made two free throws with 1:42 left to cut the Tar Heels' lead to 53-51. 
Later, after Metcalf missed a 3-pointer, Duke's Alison Bales clanged two free throws off the rim that would have tied it, and Latta, the smallest player on the court at 5-foot-6, came up with the rebound. She con­

. verted both shots from the line to increase the margin to four, and the Blue Devils missed their final three shots. 
Atkinson added another free throw with 10 seconds left to account for the final score. 
"Beating the No. 1 team, and it's Duke?" Bell said. "It's a double victory for me. I'm real excited." 
Jessica Foley had 13 points for the Blue Devils, who hadn't lost to North Carolina since Feb. 27. 2000. Freshman point guard Wanisha Smith had a miserable night, missing all seven shots and finishing with eight turnovers. 
The Tar Heels took control from the start. In the first half, they held Duke to 5-for-30 shooting (17 percent) and without a basket for the final 
6:52 to take a 26-13 lead. The margin still was 15 points mid­way through the second half 
after Bell's steal and subsequent layup, but Currie was just getting started. 
"We knew they were going to go to Currie down the stretch," North Carolina coach Sylvia Hatchell said. "She's a great, great player." 
After a 3-point­
er by Foley cut North Carolina's lead to 10, Currie swished one of her own, added two free throws and a jumper before Metcalf's first big bas­ket, a 3-pointer, made it 46-38. 
Boston College 92, Providence 4 7 
Kathrin Ress scored 19 points and Brooke Queenan added 13 to lead No. 14 Boston College to a victory over Providence. 
Ress made eight of 11 shots and added five rebounds for the Eagles (14-2, 5-0 Big East). They forged a 42-1 7 halftime advantage with a 28-0 run that began after the Friars got a 3-point basket in the opening seconds. 
The Friars (1-16, 0-6 Big East) shot a dismal 29.2 per­cent in the first half, failing to score for a stretch of 12:50. 
Boston College built on its lead with a 17-9 spurt to open the second half. The Eagles enjoyed their largest lead of the night at 43 points late in the game. 
Shauna Snyder hit five of 10 3-point shots in pacing the Friars with 17 points. Jill Furstenburgh added 14 for the losers. 
Aja Parham added 12 points in just 13 minutes for the Eagles .

The Seminoles (18-2. 5-1 Atlantic Coast Conference), playing their third consecutive overtime game, forced the sec­ond extra session when LaQuinta Neely made a layup in the final second of the first to tie it at 72.

ILLINOIS -Illinois is No. 1 in The Associated Press college basketball poll for an eighth consecutive week, earning all but one first-place vote. That ballot was cast for the new No. 2 team: Duke. 
The Blue Devils (15-0) moved up two spots to second, replacing Kansas (14-1), which dropped to sixth following its 83-62 loss at Villanova on Saturday. The Jayhawks fell below No. 2 for the first time this season. 
The Illini (19-0) received all but one of the 72 first-place votes from the national media panel Monday. The last unanimous No. 1 was Duke. which did it nine times in a 10-week span in 2001-02. 
The Blue Devils have reached No. 1 for seven straight seasons. Should 
IN BRIEF 

NHL, players' association continue lockout discussions 
NEW YORK -The NHL and the players' association will resume talks this week in a bid to save the season -and they'll meet yet again without commissioner Gary Bettman or union head Bob Goodenow. 
"The league contacted our office to arrange for continued small-group discussions. We agreed to_ this request," players' association senior director Ted Saskin said Monday. 
The sides met twice last week with· out Bettman and Goodenow. Those meetings, over two days in Chicago and Toronto, were initiated by Vancouver Canucks center Trevor Linden, the NHLPA president. 
Linden, Saskin and outside counsel John McCambridge represented the players. NHL chief legal officer Bill Daly, Calgary Flames part-owner Harley Hotchkiss, and outside coun­sel Bob Batterman took part for the league. 
The sides had hoped to sit down in Duke unseat Illinois and extend that streak to eight. it would still be four behind UCLA's record that started in 1963. Duke received 1.704 points. 95 behind Illinois and 130 more than North Carolina, which jumped from sixth to third. 
Utah (16-3) was the lone newcomer to the poll this week, moving in at No. 25 and replacing Marquette, which lost two games last week. 
Illinois, which beat Iowa at home in overtime in its only game last week, will play at No. 18 Wisconsin on Tuesday night. The Badgers (13-3) have the nation's longest home win­ning streak at 38 games. That is one of six games involving two ranked teams this week. 
Syracuse moved from seventh to fourth. one spot in front of Wake Forest, which fell two places follow­ing its overtime loss at Florida State. 
secrecy. But word got out Monday that, just like last week. the same representatives from each side will meet in Toronto on Wednesday.Eagles lose Lewis to injury 
PHILADELPHIA The Philadelphia Eagles' thin receiving corps has lost another key member, and whether its star makes it back for the Super Bowl is still uncertain. 
Tight end Chad Lewis, who caught two touchdown passes in Philadelphia's 27-10 victory over Atlanta in the NFC championship game Sunday, will miss the Super Bowl with a foot injury. 
Meanwhile, All-Pro wide receiver Terrell Owens' status is uncertain. Owens has been sidelined with an ankle injury since Dec. 19. Eagles coach Andy Reid said Monday that Owens has made "great progress," and will try to run on the ankle this week. 
Lewis, a three-time Pro Bowl selection, will have surgery on Wednesday. He was hurt on his sec· 
Kansas was No. 1 in the preseason poll and the first Top 25 of the regu­lar season. then was No. 2 for nine straight weeks. 
Kentucky was seventh. while Boston College (16-0), the only other unbeaten in Division I beside Illinois and Duke, was eighth, up one place from last week. 
Oklahoma State, which lost at Texas early last week. dropped four spots to No. 9. Washington was 10th for the second straight week, the Huskies' first appearances in the Top Ten since December 1984. 
Arizona led the second 10 and was followed by Louisville, Oklahoma. Alabama, Michigan State, Texas, Gonzaga. Wisconsin, Connecticut and Pittsburgh. 
The last five ranked teams were Cincinnati. Georgia Tech. Iowa, Mississippi State and Utah. 
ond TO grab, a 2-yard catch that sealed the win. Pacers' Artest returns to 
practice court 

INDIANAPOLIS -Ron Artest prac­ticed with the Indiana Pacers on Monday for the first time in over two months since he was suspended for fighting with Detroit fans. 
Artest did not comment as he left the practice court at Conseco Fieldhouse, but teammates and coach Rick Carlisle said his presence gave the struggling Pacers a much­needed lift. 
"Having a guy like Ron in practice helps raises the level of practice in terms of intensity because he's one of the real warrior-type players we have in this league," Carlisle said. 
Commissioner David Stern sus­pended the All-Star for the remain­der of the season after he bolted into the stands at The Palace on Nov. 19 and exchanged punches with Pistons fans, who showered Artest and the rest of the Pacers with debris.

The loss endod a 41-match win strnak for the Irish, who couldn't gain back the ground lost on the epee. During the match, freshman Olympic Gold M1Hialist Marie! Zagunis lost her first match as a collegian, falling to Olympic b~<unnmtn Emily Jacobson. 
"They knew each other very well," B1~dnarski said of' the Team USA tnarnmatns. 
Bednarski was very pleasnd in Zagunis, who won her other 10 matches, for how she performed both with and without her sabre in hand. 
"Not only greatness makes somebody useful in a team. lntnraetion with friends land teammatosl made her first timo with the team so positive," he said. "She was able to keep group tognther by showing exam­ple for others despite being a freshman." 
Zitgunis eertainly performed well in the highlight match of' the duals, when the Irish faced the No. I Buckeyes, sweeping her thrcn bouts. Senior All-i\meriean foilists Alicia Krczalo and Andrea /\mont had strong showings, each winning their first two bouts against Ohio State and going 11­1 and 10-2 overall, respectively. 

The Irish were in a good posi­tion going into the end of the match, needing to win only one of' the last three bouts to win. llowever, Metta Thomson beat Ament and her twin, IIanna, del'nated Krezalo before Kaela Brendler beat senior epeeist Kerry Walton in the final bout. 
Despite thnir suecess the rest of the day, the men were beaten quiekly by Ohio State. The Buckeyes got the mateh-dinching 14th point while the Irish had only 3 points before cruising to the final 16-11 victory. The epneists again were impressive, posting a 6-3 mark inducting a 3­bout sweep by Adjemian, but the sabres and foilists both.struggled to 2-7 finishes in the match. 
While the leaders of' his team performed well, Bednarski was disappointed with the results of some of the down thn bench !{meers. 

"Our backup fencers were too nervous to control the situation," he said. 
After the Duals. Bednarski snes his teams' high ranking as both a strong starting point as well as something to improve on.

Astros closer Brad Lidge at the Feb. 10 event in the Joyce Center. 
"We're very fortunate to have two people of the stature of Brad Lidge and Roger Clemens eome to Notre Dame and help us kkkofl' our season," Mainieri said. 
The dinner will feature classic ballpark foods, such as hot dogs and nachos, to complement guest speakers and player intro­ductions. This year's banquet is sold out, with over 1,700 tickets going in just two weeks. The event sold out in six weeks last year. 
At the 2004 dinner, best-sell­ing author and baseball fan John Grisham gave a speech to the audience. Former Los Angeles Dodgers 
later. 
Lidge was the 1998 Big East Pitcher of the Year before being selected 17th overall by the Astros in the draft. He made his Major League debut in 2002, but only pitehed in six games that season. Lidge had an impressive 2003, going 6-3 with 
3.60 ERA, and he became one of the top relief' pitchers in base­ball midway through the 2004 season when Houston dealt then-closer Octavio Dote! to the Oakland Athletics -ultimately making Lidge the new closer. He didn't disappoint, saving 29 games and tallying a miniscule 
1.90 ERA. Lidge also broke the National League record for most strikeouts in a season by a relief pitcher with 157 in 94 2/3 innings of work. 
In the playoffs, Lidge com­pletely dominated the opposi­tion and was a major part of Houston's ride into the National League Championship Series against the St. Louis Cardinals. In 12 1/3 innings, Lidge allowed just one run and struck out 20 while walking only three. 
"I think Brad, in his own right, would have been a good enough headliner for us to get a great crowd and have a great evening. But to bring Roger Clemens in is something that's going to make the evening extra special," Mainieri said. 
Clemens, who recently signed a one-year, $18 million contract with Houston, is considered among the best pitchers ever to play the game. In his career, he has accumulated a remarkable number of awards and acco­lades. Clemens has 328 wins, a career ERA of just 3.18, 4,317 strikeouts and has pitched near­ly 4,500 innings during his 20­year career. At the age of 42 last season, Clemens went 18-4

Mainieri asked Lidge to return to Notre Dame, where the pitch­er hadn't been since 1998 and speak at the dinner, and the pitcher quickly accepted. Then Mainieri had an idea. 
"We [were I going to send a plane [to Houston] to pick up Lidge," Mainieri said. "So I started thinking wouldn't it be something if we could bring Hoger Clemens up too. I knew he was a big Notre Dame foot­ball fan because I've seen him on the sidelines a couple of times during my 10 years here." 
Mainieri contacted a Notre Dame graduate who lives in the Texas area and is a close friend of Clemens. Soon enough, Clemens was asked and accept-Bowl ring. 

"Yeah, I plan on cheering for the Patriots," McCarthy said. After the firing of coach Tyrone Willingham, a handful of Irish verbal commitments decided to re-open their col­lege searches. One of the more highly-touted prospects to do this, wide receiver David Nelson, officially brol\e his ties with Notre Dame as he verbal­ly committed to Florida on Sunday. 
"It's official, we're Florida Gators," Roy Nelson, David's father, said Sunday morning to Gatorcountry.com before a meeting with Florida coach Urban Meyer. 
Nelson had 141 catches for 2,720 yards and 32 touch­downs in his last two years of high school. He is 6-foot-6 and 198 lbs. and played in the Army All-American Bowl ear­lier this month. 
The loss of Nelson leaves the Irish with verbal commitments from only two wide receivers in D.J. Hord and David Grimes. Martin Frierson, a wide receiver from Columbia, 
S. C., had verbally committed to the Irish in mid-September. He then de-committed after the Willingham firing and is now headed to Georgia Tech.

MEN'S TRACK 
ND starts off season on right foot Saturday 
Numerous Irish shine in first home meet of 
2005indoorca~aign 
By JOHN EVERETT Sports Writer 
The men' track and field team's home opener proved to be a showcase for the many superb athletes on the Fighting Irish squad. Competing against runners f r o m Michigan State, Western Michigan, Loyola­Chicago and Hillsdale College, the 

Nurudeen
Irish showed signs of good things to come. 
The meet, a non-scoring event, was highlighted by the performance of senior Selim Nurudeen, certainly no stranger to the spotlight. Nurudeen took home first­place finishes in the 60-meter dash, the 200-meter dash and the 60-meter hurdles. Nurudeen and sophomore Tommie Lee combined to be a formidable 1-2 punch, as Lee finished right behind Nurudeen in the 60 and 200-meter dash­es. 
Several freshmen made impressive contributions in the meet, with Brett Adams win­ning the 800-meters in 1 minute, 54.19 seconds, just one-hundredth of a second in front of fellow freshman Jake Watson. Other stellar freshman performers included Robert Kueny, who won the 400-meter dash ih 50.13 and Austin Wecther, winner of the 500­meter dash in 1:04.62. 
Sophomore Kurt Benninger won the mile in a time of 
4:11.21. Afterward he was pleased both with his perform­ance and that of his team­mates. 
"It was a good first meet for the distance runners, and a good chance to see where we're at; also got to work on a few things race-wise," Benninger said. 
He was also optimistic for the indoor season. 
"It's shaping up pretty well," he said. "The Meyo Invitational is in two weeks. Our biggest home meet of the season before the Big East." 
Complementing the perform­ance if the Irish on the track were the noteworthy marks set by Notre Dame's field squad, which contributed four first­place finishes to the meet. Chip Roberts won the weight throw at 16.87m, and Chris Staron cleared 2.0lm to take the high jump. Justin Oppel won the pole vault at a height of 4.65m, and Michael Schubert was the victor of the shot put, with a throw of14.76m. 
The Irish will compete at home Saturday in the Notre Dame Invitational.

Slowly, but surely 
LaVere sheds brace, finds old form in last two Big East games 
By HEATHER VAN HOEGARDEN Sporrs Editor 

After arthroscopic knee sur­gery in December, Courtney LaVere is finally getting baek to her old form. 
"I have a lot more confi­dence," LaVere said after No. 6 
shooting. 
"I thought Courtney gave us a great lift off the bench," Irish coaeh Muffet McGraw said after that game. "She was real­ly ready to play." 
LaVere played without her brace for the first time Wednesday since her Dec. 30 return to action. She finished with her second double-double or the season, tallying 13 points and 10 rebounds. Ironically, her first double-dou­ble came in the game when she hurt her knee, Nov. 17, against 
Duke.

Sunday against Rutgers, the 6-foot-3 junior was a key contributor off the bench as well. She was good

Men top Columbia, women fall to OSU 
By ERIC RETTER Sports Writer 
Only one match into the new year, the Irish may already put their toughest regular-season opponent behind them. 
In a move that may pay big div­idends down the road, Notre Dame wasted no time before matching up against the best in the NCAA, squaring off against a tough field that included Columbia, ranked in the top-five in both the men's and women's polls, and No. 1 Ohio State. 
In this early season, the Irish, whose men's and women's teams are ranked No. 2 and No. 4 in their respective polls, have already tasted defeat. The women lost to both Columbia and Ohio State en route to a 2-2 over­all porformance, while the men topped all but the No. 1 Buckeyes at the event for a 3-1 record. 
Despite these early losses, Irish 
head coach Janusz Bednarski 
was not disappointed in his 
teams' performances. 
"I expected this," he said, "The beginning of the season is always hard, and first matches will be bumpy." 

While Bednarski anticipated a struggle to start the season, he did not predkt everything about the way the teams would exe-., cute. -A. 
"I did not expect the men's ' team would do better than the ; women, who are stronger I as an. all-around team]," Bednarsk: said. ./ 
The men defeated both host~ New York University and  Stanford by respective margins'· of 17-10 and 19-8, but the high-~ light of the duals for the men wa......_.. the 16-11 victory they took from Columbia. The charge was head-'· ed by the teams' epeeists, who ~.. won eight out or nine bouts ·-.., against the Lions on their way to compiling a team-best 30-6 com­bined record during the course of the duals. Two-time All­American senior epeeist Michal Soberiaj led all Irish men with a 1 0-1 overall record at the event, while sophomore Aaron
