"Because this is a campus setting where we share many things -space and facilities -you're just more prone to getting staph," she said. 
Staphylococcus aureus bac­teria are normally found on the skin or in the nose of about 1/3 of the population, according to the Mayo Clinic's Web site. 
"Not everybody gets sick from it," Brubaker said. 
The problem arises when the bacteria gets under the skin, either because of a break in the skin, dry skin or an abrasion. Then, an infection 
appears on the skin resem­bling a pimple or boil, she said. 
There are students at the University with staph infec­tions right now, Brubaker said, but they "have been instructed on what they're supposed to do." 
"The students who have those kinds of infections are told how to cover the wound and given strict instructions on how to act on campus so it's not spread," she said. 
The incidence of staph infec­tions at Notre Dame is not an "outbreak," Brubaker said, because there is no traceable 
common origin of the infec­
tions. 
''I'm not saying we're not a 
little worried when we see it, 
but we're good at treating it," 
she said. 
In order to treat the infec­
tions with an effective antibi­
otic, doctors must look for the 
source, Brubaker said. 
"Two students last year had 
infections related to the fact 
they hadn't washed their 
sheets ... you could get an 
infection in an open area just . by dirty laundry," she said. Living in shared spaces and

Professors discuss hiring 
Senators grapple with Catholic faculty report 
By MARCELA BERRIOS Associate News Editor 
A report from the Office of the Provost on the hiring of Catholic professors and the faculty's response to the docu­ment were at the center of the Faculty Senate meeting Wednesday. 
Senate chair Colin Jessop said after the meeting that the report -which was released last week by University Provost Thomas Burish ­addressed the steadily decreasing percentage of Catholics teaching at Notre Dame and the University's pos­sible actions to ensure a healthy supply of Catholic pro­fessors in the long run. 
And while he said the Senate will work to develop mecha­nisms to gauge the faculty's in­depth opinions on the report, Jessop, a physics professor, said there is already a broad sense of disquiet surrounding the idea of hiring with reli­gious affiliation in mind. 
"The University is worried about the decline in the per­centage of Catholic faculty members and the faculty members, in turn, are worried that in trying to rectify this sit­uation, the University will move away from hiring solely

Antibiotic-resistant strain afflicts students at Notre Dame; cases not suggestive of outbreak

A staph infection caused by the antibiotic-resistant "super­bug," known as MRSA. is a common problem on college campuses and serves as a reminder of the importance of hand-washing and personal hygiene, Assistant Director of Clinical Services Pat Brubaker said.

Welch speaks out against death penalty 
Father of Me Veigh victim visits campus 
By ASHLEY CHARNLEY News Writer 
Bud Welch, the father of one of the 168 people who died in the Oklahoma City bombing, spoke against the death penalty during Wednesday's Right to Life meeting in LaFortune. 
"Normal human beings do not feel good out of watching another human being's last breath," Welch said. He said Americans have a limited understanding of the death penalty and need to learn more. 
"Education, education, edu­cation," he said. During his talk, Welch 
focused on his struggle to for­give Timothy McVeigh, who bombed the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City on April 19, 1995. Welch's daughter, Julie, who worked at the Oklahoma City federal building, was among the people killed. 
Welch was devastated when his daughter died. He wanted to see McVeigh killed. 
"All of my life I opposed the death penalty. Now, I didn't even want them to have a trial." Welch said. He turned to alcohol to ease the pain.

Keep the rrtic 

a-way 
Don Shula. the famous NFL coach 

who led the 1972 Miami Dolphins to a 
perfect, undnfeated season (culminat­
ing in a Supor Bowl win) is thn win­
ningnst hnad coach in thn history of 
football. lie is a 
tremendous Pat Stynes 
coach, a font of 
football wisdom Sports Wire 
and, I am sure, a Editor 
nicn man. 
After his 

coaching career. hn opened a line of 
steakhouses and appeared on various 
comnwrcials, and was successful in 
each endeavor. 
However recently Coach Shula 

decided to throw opinion into the pub­
lic forum of sports journalism, com­
menting on the Patriots' run toward 
an undefeated season and their cam­
era-spying incident earlier this year. 
"The Spygate thing has diminished 

what thny've accomplished. You would 
hate to have that attached to your 
accomplishments. They've got it," 
Shula said. "Belichiek was lined 
$500,000, the team was fined $250,00 
and they lost a first-round draft 
choice. That tells you the seriousness 
or signilicance of what they found." 
I find Shula's opinion absolutely pre­

posterous, and it almost sounds like 
whining. 
i\s a native New Yorker, I can certain 

tell you that I hate Boston sports as 
much as the nnxt guy. llowevor, I have 
always believed you have to give credit 
where cn~dit is due. The Patriots are 
simply playing at a level beyond any­
one in tlw NFL this year, murdering 
mediocre opponents and knocking off 
good ones. 
Yet despite the fact that not only is stealing signals eommon in the NFL (the Patriots are just the 11rst to get caught), but it is clear when looking at the quality of the Jets and the Patriots that the signal-filming was not need­ed. 
"I guess you got the same thing as putting an asterisk by Barry Bonds' home run record," Shula continued. "I guess it will be noted that the Patriots wenl fined, and a No.1 draft choice was taken away during that year of aecomplishment." 
I won't even address the reference to Bonds, as it is so farfetched it is not even worth discussing. 
What got me thinking though, is the fact that the 1972 Miami Dolphins themselves are not necessarily unde­serving of an asterisk. 
For one, they played a 14 game reg­ular season -should we asterisk their team now? In looking at their sched­ule, according to NFL.com, the Dolphins did not beat a single playoff tnam, and the best record of a team they played was 8-6. So should we asterisk the 1972 season saying that their strength of schedule was so laughable the perfeet season was too nasy'? 
Let's get serious: stealing signals is common in every single sport, Belichick is no innovator when it comes to this. Also, the Patriots look like a varsity team playing the fresh­man B-squad most of the games this year. If they are able to run the table this year, the Patriots deserve the un­tarnished, un-asterisked record in Canton.

not practicing good hygiene make college students more susce1ptiblc to staph infections. Iloweve1r, out of thn 140 cases of students diagnosed with "wound infections'' since January, probably six are MHSA-related. Brubaker said. 
"The population of the col­lngf~ campus feels that they're invincible and they don't wash 
their hands enough." she said. 
Washing hands, wiping down shared equipment, cleaning linens with bleach and drying linens in a vnry hot dryer can prevent staph infections, she said. 
University workout facili­ties and locker rooms are 
"doing what they can, Brubaker said. 
"Our facilities, like the train­ing room at the Joyce Center, HecSports and the Rock, are all well aware of the increased incidences of MRSA. They have polieies about the cleaning of nquipment, the use of whirlpools, etc.," she said. 
The bacteria can live on inanimate surfaces for hours, shn said. but antibacterial wipes and cleaning can pre­vent infnetion. 
Shaving puts people at incnmsed risk for staph infec­tion, especially on skin folds, since the razor breaks the skin. 
One of the causes of MRSA is the overuse and misuse of antibiotics, which has caused germs to "become bolder and stronger." 
Because of this, it is difficult to treat the resistant infection. 
"Even if we had three cases in front of us, they might be on three different antibiotics," Brubaker said. 
"The only common thing is that penicillin will not work for

any of them," she said. 
The best ini­tial treatment for staph is a hot wet com­press to encour­age the infection to drain, Brubaker said. One should see a doctor if a pimple-like infection gets worse, or multi­ple areas become infect­ed. 
"You should not try to pinch it ~ that makes the infection go in further rather than get out," she said. 
CA-MRSA can be potentially fatal, but it is "rare that any­one in this age group would die from staph," Brubaker said. 
Most deaths related to the bacteria occur when people have weakened immune sys­tems or when the infection gets internalized in the bloodstream or joints.

Native An1erican singer perforn1s 
By KATIE STAAK 
News Writer 
In honor of Native American Heritage Month, the Saint Mary's Office of Multicultural Affairs sponsored singer-songwriter Michael Jacobs Wednesday night at Dalloway's, the cafe on campus. 
Jacobs, a Cherokee recording artist, shared not only his music but also his Native American her­itage with the audience. Hi<> per­formance filled Dalloway's, and few seats were left when the music began. 
Jacobs explained what each of his songs meant before he per­formed them. Many songs had stories that he shared along with the music. 
"I sing about life from an Native American perspective," he said. "But, also life in general, so it is accessible to everyone." 
He used his guitar and voice for the majority of the night. For one song, however, he used a Native American flute that he taught himself to play a few years ago. 
Office of Multicultural Affairs Director Larisa Olin Ortiz said Saint Mary's invited Jacobs to help celebrate the month. 
"It is important to say that this month is National American Indian Heritage Month," she said. "By organizing this type of pro­gram, educating the community, providing resources such as books, publications and documen­taries and sharing information about events taking place on and ofl' campus, we are recognizing the many contributions of American Indians and Alaskan Natives, something we should not only celebrate in November, but throughout the year." 

Ortiz and her office run a year­long cultural campaign to help inform and diversify the Saint Mary's campus. 
Wednesday was the second time Jacobs has performed at the College. He performed last year, again in celebration of Native American Heritage Month. 
"He knows how to connect with the audience by sharing his jour­ney to discover his American Indian roots with his passion for music," Ortiz said. 
Saint Mary's junior Mariam Eskander called Jacobs' perform­ance "amazing." 
"He wa<> so fresh," she said. 
Many girls applauded after each song and laughed at the jokes Jacobs told in between his music. 
"I loved his voice and his style," junior Andrea Ortiz said. 
Jacobs spoke about how he started his music career and what got him where he is today. 
''I've been playing since I've been a kid and I've always want­ed to do it," he said. 
Jacobs was in a rock band dur­ing the 1980s. He then retired, but in 2002 decided to get back into professional music by going solo. 
"I started pursuing my culture and writing songs about this," he said. These songs, which he wrote mainly for his friends, eventually became his first solo album. 
Jacobs said the purpose of his m~!c i<> "to humanize native peo­ple. 
"I want people to view them as real people, rather than have them demonized," he said.

Building, Welch realized he needed to move forward. 
"Julie not only opposed tho death penalty, she was active against it," Welch said. Three weeks after he stood in front of the Federal Building, Welch decided the death penalty was wrong. IIe started to speak out and tell Julie's story. 
As a teenager, Julie Wnleh was very interested in foreign languago. She traveled to Spain as an exchange student during her junior year of high school and .later got a scholarship to Marquette for her aehinvement in foreign language. She attended Marquotto and, dur­ing her sophomore year, went abroad again. Shn got her degree in Spanish and became a translator. 
When Welch saw Bill McVeigh, Timothy McVeigh's father, doing an interview on television shortly after the bombing occurred, he decided he wanted to meet him and tell him he did not blame Bill McVeigh for what his son had done. Three years later, he got his chance. 
Weleh visited Bill McVeigh in Buffalo, N.Y., in the house where Timothy was raised. While he was at the house, he also met Timothy's sister, Jennifer. The thrno of them sat at the dining room table and talked. 
After a couple hours, Wolch got up to leave. flo shook Bill MeVeigh's hand, and when he went to shake Jennifer's hand, she hugged him instead.

Space shuttle Discovery returns to Earth 
CAPE CANAVERAL -Discovery and its crew returned to Earth on Wednesday and concluded a 15-day space station build and repair mission that was among the most challenging -and heroic ­in shuttle hlstory. 
The space shuttle touched down on a crisp and bright t~tll afternoon after safely crossing the conti­nent in the first coast-to-coast re-entry since the Columbia disaster almost five years ago. 
The seven shuttle astronauts and three residents of the international space station teamed up dur­ing the docked mission to save a mangled solar wing. It was one of the most diflicult and danger­ous repairs ever attempted in orbit, but the future of the space station was riding on it and Scott Parazynski pulled it off in a single spacewalk.

CIIICAGO -Nearly two dozen illegal immi­grants were arn~sted Wednesday, accused of using lake security badges to work in critical areas of O'Hare International Airport, including the tar­mac, authorities said. 
The 23 illegal workers were employed by Ideal Statling Solutions Inc., whose corporate secretary and office manager also were arrested after an eight-month investigation that involved federal, state and Chicago authorities. 
The company contracted work for carriers including United Airlines, KLM and Qantas, said Elissa A. Brown, a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent.

Israel ready for deal with Palestine

Si111pson could face up to life in prison 
Associated Press 

LAS VEGAS -After being acquit­ted more than a decade ago in one of the most sensational murder cases in U.S. history, O.J. Simpson could be looking at hard time if convicted in a seemingly half­baked scheme to grab some sports memorabilia he claimed belonged to him. 
Whether prosecutors can make the charges stick remains to be seen. But if they can, the 60-year­old former football star will almost certainly go to prison. 
One charge alone -robbery with the use of a deadly weapon -car­ries a mandatory sentence of two to 15 years. Kidnapping could bring a life sentence with the possi­bility of parole. 
The defense and the public will get a preview of the prosecution's case beginning Thursday at a pre­liminary hearing where a judge will be asked to decide whether there is enough evidence to take the case to trial sometime next year. 
Simpson was arrested and accused along with five others of bursting into a Las Vegas hotel­casino room with guns Sept. 13 and stealing a trove of sports items from two memorabilia dealers. Prosecutors say at least one gun was drawn. 
Michael Shapiro, a New York defense lawyer who provided com­mentary during Simpson's 1995 acquittal in the slayings of his wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend Ronald Goldman, said the Las Vegas case "reminds me of the old Mad magazine cartoon 'Spy vs. Spy"' in its amateurishness -"if it weren't for the presence of a gun or guns." 
"That ups the ante," Shapiro said. "When guns come into play, bad things can happen." 
The case is likely to pivot on Simpson's contention that he didn't ask anyone to bring guns, that he didn't know anyone had guns, and that no guns were displayed.

The report had already expressed fears of "misunder­standings and damaging rumors both within the University and outside about any distinctive policy of recruiting Catholics in all departments because of their Catholicism."

Study reveals n1any hon1eless are veterans 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -Veterans make up one in four homeless people in the United States, though they are only 11 per­cent of the general adult popu­lation, according to a report to be released Thursday. 

And homelessness is not just a problem among middle-age and elderly veterans. Younger veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan are trickling into shelters and soup kitchens seeking services, treatment or help with finding a job. 
The Veterans Affairs Department has identified 1,500 homeless veterans from the current wars and says 400 of them have participated in its programs specifically targeting homelessness. 
The National Alliance to End Homelessness, a public educa­tion nonprofit, based the find­ings of its report on numbers from Veterans AfTairs and the Census Bureau. 2005 data esti­mated that 194,254 homeless people out of 744,313 on any given night were veterans. 
In comparison, the VA says that 20 years ago, the estimat­ed number of veterans who were homeless on any given night was 250,000. 
Some advocates say the early presence of veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan at shelters does not bode well for the future. It took roughly a decade for the lives of Vietnam veterans to unravel to the point that they started showing up among the homeless. Advocates worry that intense and repeated deployments leave newer veterans particu­larly vulnerable. 
"We're going to be having a tsunami of them eventually because the mental health toll from this war is enormous," said Daniel Tooth, director of veterans affairs for Lancaster County, Pa. 
While services to homeless veterans have improved in the past 20 years, advocates say more financial resources still are needed. With the spotlight on the plight of Iraq veterans, they hope more will b!~ done to prevent homelessness and pro­vide affordable housing to the younger veterans while there's a window of opportunity. 
"When the Vietnam War ended, that was part of the problem. The war was over, it was ofl' TV, nobody wanted to hear about it," said John Keaveney, a Vietnam veteran and a founder of New Directions in Los Angeles, which provide!) substance abuse help, job training and shelter to veterans. · 
"I think they'll be forgotten," Keaveney said of Iraq and Afghanistan veterans. "People get tired of it. It's not glitzy that these are young, honor­able, patriotic Americans. They'll just be veterans, and that happens al't.!~r every war."

IN BRIEF National debt hits $9 trillion for first time 
WASIIINGTON -The national debt has hit $9 trillion for the first time. 
The Treasury Department, which issues a daily accounting of the debt, said Wednesday that the debt subject to limit was at $9 trillion on Tuesday. It was $8.996 trillion on Monday. 
Last month, Congress passed and President Bush signed into law an increase in the gov­ernment's borrowing ceiling to $9.815 trillion. It was the fifth debt limit increase since Bush took office in January 2001. Those increases have totaled $3.865 trillion. 
The administration contends the rising debt reflects such factors as slow economic growth during the 2001 recession, the Sept. 11 attacks and the cost of lighting terrorism. 
Date rape drug found in children's toys 
WASIIINGTON -Millions of Chinese-made toys for children have been pulled from shelves in North America and Australia after scientists found they contain a chemical that converts into a powerful "date rape" drug when ingested. 
Two children in the U.S. and three in Australia were hospitalized after swallowing the beads. 
In the United States, the toy goes by the name Aqua Dots, a highly popular holiday toy distributed by Toronto-based Spin Master Toys. They are called Bindeez in Australia, when~ they were named toy of the year at an industry function earlier this year. 
It could not immediately be learned whether Aqua Dots beads are made in the same facto­ries as tlw Bindeez product. Both are sold by Australia-based Moose Enterprises. 
The toy beads are sold in general merchan­dise stores and over the Internet for use in arts and crafts projects. They can be arranged into designs and fused together when sprayed with water. 
Scientists say a chemical coating on the beads. when ingested, metabolizes into the so­called date rape drug gamma hydroxy butyrate. When eaten, the compound -made from common and easily available ingredients -can induce unconsciousness, seizures, drowsiness, coma and death.

Oil prices reach record high 
Traders worry whether supplies will meet demand for heating fuel in winter 
Associated Press 
VIENNA -Record oil prices edged closer to $100 a barrel Wednesday amid expectations of declining 
U.S. supplies. The weak dol­lar and OPEC's apparent reluctance to pump more crude into the market also boosted prices. 
Light, sweet crude for December delivery rose $1.05 to $97.75 a barrel by afternoon in Europe after earlier reaching a record $98.62 in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. 
The contract hit a high of $97.10 Tuesday before clos­ing at $96.70 a barrel. a record settlement 66 percent higher than the close on the first trading day of the year. 
That left crude prices within the range of inflation­adjusted highs set in early 1980. Depending on the how the adjustment is caleulated, $38 a barrel then would be worth $96 to $103 or more today. 
In London, Brent crude rose 86 cents to $94.12 a barrel on the ICE Futures exchange. A number of North Sea oil platforms were evacuated Tuesday ahead of expected severe weather, and BP PLC said it expects to shut production Thursday from its Valhall oil and gas field. 
Traders remain worried about whether supplies will be adequate to meet demand for heating fuel in the approaching Northern Hemisphere winter. News of an attack Monday on an oil pipeline in Yemen added to those concerns. 
"The oil market sentiment remains bullish ... there is an overall upward trend toward the $100 level," said Victor Shum, energy analyst with Purvin & Gertz in Singapore. "Meanwhile, we can expect extreme volatility where on the one hand some traders will take profit while others average, that crude oil will buy back positions." inventories fell by 1.6 million

General Motors reports $39 billion loss 
Associated Press 

DETROIT -General Motors Corp. posted a company record $39 billion loss Wednesday for the third quarter, as a charge involving unused tax credits brought an abrupt end to a string of three profitable quarters for the nation's largest autornaker. 
The loss was one of the biggest quarterly corporate deficits ever. GM's shares closed more than 6 per­cent lower. Standard & Poor's down­graded GM shares from hold to sell, and said GM's near-term outlook has worsened significantly in part due to reduced U.S. sales. 
GM attributed most of the third­quarter loss to a $38.6 billion non­cash charge related to accumulated deferred tax credits in the U.S., Canada and Germany. Accounting rules require companies to write down the value of such credits if they have scant prospects for a return to profitability in the near term. 
GM also reported a loss of $757 million from its 49 percent stake in GMAC Financial Services, due large­ly to losses at ResCap, GMAC's mort­gage arm. 
It was the second-worst quarterly net loss in U.S. corporate history, exceeded only by AOL Time Warner's $44.9 billion loss in the fourth quarter of 2002 when the value of the AOL operations was marked down, according to Howard Silverblatt, a senior index analyst for Standard & Poor's. 
GM Chairman and Chief Executive Rick Wagoner said the aceounting shift is not easy to explain but does­n't have a substantial impact on the business. 
"I would stress: No impact whatso­ever on our cash position, no impact on our ability to use the tax offsets in the future, and from my perspective, really no change whatsoever in our outlook or optimism about the future of getting the business turned around," he said. 

What might be considered more troubling for GM is continuing losses in its home market. North America, where it reported a net loss of $24 7 million without the charge for the latest quarter. That compares with a net loss of $667 million in the year­ago period. 
The company reported an overall loss of $1.6 billion, or $2.80 per share, excluding special items. Besides the accounting change, spe­cial items included a $3.5 billion after-tax gain on the $5.4 billion sale of Allison Transmission in August. 
The net loss contrasts with rival Toyota Motor Corp.'s announcement Wednesday that its profit for the fis­cal second quarter rose 11 percent to a company record $4 billion. Toyota and GM are vying for the title of world's largest autornaker by sales this year.

Do you know what these men have in common? United States presidents, who swear to protect and defend the Constitution, thought fit to give them unconditional pardons for their offens­es, circumventing this country's justice system through the use of a Constitutional relic which must be abolished. 
If you think that such unquestioned power as provided in the form of the pardon is more appropriate for a monarch than for a President who is supposed to be aecountable to the public, you are quite right. The pardon is a carry-over from the English monarchy, and the story .of its inclu­sion in our system of government is a testament to its egregiousness. 
At the Constitutional Convention in 171:'.7, the pardon's inclusion was one of the pet causes of Alexander Hamilton. Hamilton, though more famous for his finaneial wizardry as the first secretary of the treasury, and of course for being shot by Aaron Burr, was well known in his day as a supporter of a powerful federal gov­ernment. Many of his proposals at the Philadelphia Convention were inter­preted by his peers as supporting a sort of elected monarch, a charge which was levied against him in later years, sullying his reputation. The pardon is one of the few of Hamilton's ideas which was adopted. 

Hamilton defended plaeing the unchecked power of the pardon in the hands of the president in Federalist No. 74. His argument is more like a defense of kingly power in general than a specific reasoning in favor of the pardon. Hamilton states that the pardon is a necessary part of govern­ment to mitigate the occasional severi­ty of the law. Therefore, Hamilton focuses his argument on why it is not so bad that the power should be vest­ed in one person. According to Hamilton, the loeation of the power in a single person "would naturally inspire scrupulousness and caution" and that "the dread of being accused of ... connivance" would also make the president pause. 
Of course, American presidents have always been known for their fear of perceived "connivance." This fear per­fectly explains why Bill Clinton stead­fastly refused to grant a pardon to his half-brother, Huger, and why George 
W. Bush resisted pressure from his own vice president to force Scooter Libby to pay off his debt to society. Oops. 
President Bush can try to impress Americans by saying he deliberated at length over his choice to grant a reprieve to a man whose guilt is not even really contested, but it doesn't really matter how lung you consider a question if you still get the answer wrong. Libby's sentence was not com­muted in an attempt to show mercy on someone deserving of it, instead it was a political favor done to help the vice president's friend, and, unlike any other action the president may take, there is nothing anyone can do about it but complain. Congress is unable to review a pardon and the courts can not reverse it. As a second-term presi­dent, Bush no longer has to worry about the public turning him out of office, either. 
Hamilton's other argument in favor 
of the pardon power being in the pres­
ident's hands instnad of thn legislature 
is that, in cnrtain circumstances, it 
will be benellcial to aet quiekly, and 
the legislature might allow "the golden 
opportunity" to pass. Like his first 
argument, this is more of a defense of 
monarchical power in total than a 
defense of the pardon, as the same 
argument could bn applied universally, 
to every issue that can be raised. 
The Founders decided that the leg­
islative and judicial branches, as 
checks to the power of the president 
and to each other, were important 
enough to ovnrcome the dr:awbacks of 
delay and indeeision. Hamilton's dis­
agreement with this philosophy is evi­
dent in his writing, so it remains a 
mystery why the pardon power snuck 
through as really the only unchecked 
power of the presidnnt. 
Whether presidents have ever been as serupulous or cautious as llamilton nxpeeted them to be is a matter of debatn. What has bneome abundantly dear over the coursn of the last sevnr­al ad ministrations, of both partins, is that they no longer are. There an~ times when pardons are called for, certainly, but why not let the issue be debated, or at least, held in check by the othm branches of government'? At the vnry least, administration officials like Scooter Libby would have to think twice before committing a crime, unable to count on a favor from a friend in a high place.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR 

'The Dreaded Sign' shuts out study space 
We came to Notre Dame to get a solid, valuable education. In order to receive that education, we must do a considerable amount of studying and work. Fur us Walshies, and for most South, West, and God Quad residents, the Coleman Morse Lounge is an ideal workplace. Complete with pop­corn, soda, coffee, and a general aura of joy and happiness, CoMo makes the Library look like the bot­tom of St. Joe's Lake. Unfortunately, our happiness in in this oasis. of potential knowledge is constantly threatened by the Dreaded Sign. All too often, students who frequent the Coleman Morse Lounge are faced with these words: "x group has reserved this space for the next 72 hours ... at least." Okay, so we exag­gerated. but it sure feels like that to those of us who planned our entire day's work around the notion that we would have this space available to study in. 

You may argue, why not go to the library? Simple answer: No. Never. It's freezing. It was sleeting today. Didn't you see? You may argue, why not study in your room? Simple answer: Have you seen the size of our rooms? It's impossible. You may argue, why not study in LaFortune? Simple answer: If we wanted to study in a bar, we would. Unfortunately, we can't get our calculus problems done when there are three football games on TV and 67 people shouting about why Charlie Weis should or shouldn't be fired this week. 
There is only one solution to this dilemma. Destroy the signs and all that they entail. Really, with all the money this institution spends on equipped facilities, it isn't necessary that one of three common study spaces on campus be occupied five times a week. We niTer the following solutions: Either eliminate this prob­lem altogether, or meet us halfway. We know for a fact that there are more available classrooms on the upper lloors of CoMo than are actual­ly opened for use after hours. These elassrooms should be put to use. It all comes down to one very simple ques­tion: Does the Univnristy of Notre Dame want successful students? Or not? We think you know what to do.

'Sex' in the dorms 
Once on retreat, I asked my 70-year-old spiritual director, a Trappist monk, "When does your sex drive fmally calm down?" After a moment's pause, he answered, "As best I can tell, about a half-hour after you 
die." Father Lou 
So much for easy 

solutions. Growing DelFra into sexual maturity is a life-long journey, FaithPoint without many short­
cuts. 
Many, many students on our campus­male and female -are struggling with the role of pornography in their lives. It is not surprising. Take one ofyour deepest, most powerful, often seemingly insatiable human drives -your sex drive -and offer it instant, stimulating, no-strings­attached, anonymous, and often free grati­fication, especially at a time when, biologi­cally, you are at the peak ofyour sexual lives. Add to this the technological explo­sion of personal computer products. Throw in the general stress levels with being a student in a competitive environment. Given this set of conditions, what would really be surprising was ifpornography use on campus was somehow declining, which as you know, it is not. 
So, in the midst of this extraordinarily explosive set of circumstances, I want first to say thank you to the many students who have had the courage, and desire for wholeness, to bring this up, and to share their struggles, and to seek for mature ways to live out their sexual lives. Your wit­ness -even ifyou have not overcome this temptation but are still struggling with it ­is a light illuminating a dark, labyrinthine street. Though it is a confusing and some­times seemingly overwhelming road, it is one on which our God, who gave us this gift of sexuality, promises to walk closely with us -continually offering us true inti­macy and ways to live out our lives with integrity and true joy. 
Your struggles have illuminated for me some of the subtly harmful consequences ofrepeated pornography use-ones that seem barely apparent in any single moment of consumption, but begin to form corrosive patterns over time. I bring them up here in the hope that they may be help­ful to others. 
Pornography seems to tarnish the way its users relate tq other people, including peo­ple they really want to love. Because pornography is so immediately stimulating and does not require the interpersonal, longer-term effort that friendship requires, and also because pornography generally requires solitude and anonymity, many stu­dents have noticed in themselves a damp­ened desire to deepen friendships with oth­ers. This includes a decreased interest in deepening friendships with other people you actually find yourself attracted to -a fact that reveals how deviously isolating the practice of viewing pornography can be. Not surprisingly, students have also expressed concern that pornography seems to increase their tendency to view other people -again, perhaps most frus­tratingly, especially people to whom they are attracted-primarily as sexual objects. 
Pornography also, over time, leaves its users with an increased sense of loneliness and emptiness -the exact opposite of the fulfillment it promises. As intimate as the act of viewing pornography may feel in the moment-alone, another human being unveiled before you -your deepest self is not duped because no truly human rela­tionship is ever formed. It is all virtual. 
Perhaps one ofthe most tempting features ofpornography is that no follow-up with your "partner" is needed -a feature that seems extremely convenient at the time, but which actually frustrates our deep human desire for companionship. It proba­bly is also worth reminding ourselves -for the sake ofbreaking through the fantasy­that, as spontaneous as pornographic acts present themselves, in fact they are almost entirely calculated, non-spontaneous, deliberately filmed and edited products of a $2 billion a year industry that is interested in making money, not fulfilling any human need for relationship. In fact, the industry can hardly make money ifit actually suc­ceeds in fulfilling your companionship needs. Its increasing profits -and they are increasing at an amazing rate -are dependent on repeated use. 
Perhaps the most pernicious conse­quence that students have struggled with is that, over time, repeated pornography use threatens to tum sexuality into an enemy. Students who struggle with pornography frequently talk about their sexuality prima­rily as something they need to ove~come. In fact, it is the use ofpomography.they are so desperate to overcome, but often this slips into a general adversarial relationship with one's entire sexuality. This is squarely at odds with the life -including the sexual life-that God, who gifted us with our sex­uality, intends for us. We are not created to be enemies ofthe gifts which God has planted deep within us. As Jesus protec­tively describes the presence ofthe gift of the Spirit within him against those who believe he is possessed of an evil spirit, "A house divided against itself cannot stand." Father Ron Rolheiser, who offers a com­pelling, positive, and explicitly Christian understanding of sexuality in his book, "The Holy Longing," writes, "For a Christian, sex is something sacred. Hence, it can never be simply a casual, unimpor­tant, neutral thing. If its proper nature is respected, it builds the soul as a sacra­ment, and it brings God's physical touch to us. Conversely, though, ifits proper nature is not respected, it ... works at disintegrat­ing the soul." Each of God's gifts, including our sexuality, is given for the purpose of building our souls. 
Of the set of conditions that students have identified as helping to make pornog­raphy such a growing trend on college campuses-its accessibility, its anonymity, its power to stimulate -few are likely to change in the near future, and in fact will likely increase. Two, however, that remain in our control are anonymity and the mes­sages about sexuality that permeate our community. What courageous students have revealed is that honestly sharing their struggles with pornography with another person whom they trust -a priest, minis­ter, mentor, friend -is an incredibly pow­erful step towards breaking its hold. What a beautiful insight into the power of Christian community -characterized as it is by encouragement, forgiveness, healing, true freedom, true love, real relationship and, infusing it all, the compassion of Christ. He has entered totally into our humanity, in all its complexity, and promis­es to bring every part of us -including our sexuality -into intimate union with Him.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 


Burger King ignores slavery in their fields 
Do you eat tomatoes in the dining halls? Do you put ketchup on your fries? Would you still eat those toma­toes if you knew they were picked by people who may as well be (and some­times are) enslaved? 
In the fields of Florida right now, workers have to pick two tons of toma­1 toes in order to make $50, two and a half tons to make the minimum wage in Florida. This is something only possible during the peak seasons of picking, when competition for wages makes it possible to work only two to three days a week. Typically, workers make less than $40 per day, and rarely have a full work week. Injuries are also com­mon. As a result of this, farmworkers have to live with upwards of 10 people in a dingy trailer..because it rents for $300 -$500 per week (that's not a typo), and work in the fields for 10-12 hours per day. Actual cases of slavery are still being uncovered, with other cases still working through the courts. 
The Coalition of Immokalee Workers (CIW), formed in 1993 to fight these injustices, has been instrumental in achieving better wages and working conditions for farmworkers. In 2004, Taco Bell signed an agreement to pay ~ penny more per pound to workers, which increased wages for tomato pickers by 70 percent. That may seem like a lot, but it had been 30 years since farmworkers had received a raise. And last year, McDonalds signed on to a similar agreement. These cor­porations are the same ones that have asked for lower and lower costs for years, which were passed down to the workers. Unfortunately, these agree­ments represent only one to two per­cent of the industry. 
Currently, Burger King is refusing to sign the type of agreement that McDonalds and Taco Bell have. In response to this, and with the knowl­edge that the previous agreements only came after long, hard struggles, the CIW will be holding a protest Nov. 30 at Burger King's corporate headquarters in Miami, Fl. 
In support of this action, Notre Dame students have joined in this fight as well. On Oct. 31, wearing masks of the "King" that read, "Burger King Exploits Farmworkers," 16 students sat outside the Burger King in LaFortune, trying to raise awareness of these issues. 
Students who have further interest in these problems or would like to join our cause should direct their questions to MEChA (Movimiento Estudantil Chicano de Azthin), or are welcome to e-mail me at mgotsch@nd.edu. If nei­ther of those options appeal to you, I ask that you simply remember the peo­ple in the fields making it possible for you to have ketchup with those fries. 
All statistics about the daily life of farm workers came from the CSC's Migrant Experiences Seminar 2007, held in Immokalee, Fl., and from www.ciw-online.org.

On Tuesday night, a group of students gathered in the Coleman Morse Lounge for a celebration of the written word. Ten students whose works of poetry and prose had been selected by the Studnnt Union Board read their works aloud as a part of the Notre Dame Literary Festival Student Night. 
Audience members enjoyed a wide variety of offerings highlighting the literery talents of every class, from freshmen to graduate students. Meaghan McGinley kicked off the evening with two poems about a forgot­ten mirror and growing older and a humorous retelling of the Rapunzel fairy tale. David Karapetyan shifted to a slightly darker mood with four poems about subjects ranging from office life to a cynic's view of French townspeople, and Tanya Barrios shared her tributes to a friend and to her personal sanctu­ary. 
The serious mood continued with Sade Murphy's glimpses into a shat­tered relationship and the superficiality of Barbie, and lightened with Joe Eno's reworking of a Shakespearian sonnet, urge towards carpe diem, and a humor­ous ode to Keystone Light. Michael McDonald and Loren Higbee shared their stream-of-con­sciousness impres­

Freshman Lillian Civantos shared her poetic thoughts about the transition from high school to college, and Mychal Stanley closed the evening with a short story recounting the awkward first meeting of a girl and boy brought together by a burning building. 
Fortuitous beginnings 
The student event marked the begin­ning of this year's Notre Dame Literary Festival. which is celebrating its 41st year. Inspired by an event held at the University of Mississippi, the festival started in 1967 with Notre Dame stu­dent J. Richard Rossi as a series of films and lectures by literary scholars on the works and life of William Faulkner. Hossi passed the responsibili­ty of organizing the festival to sopho­more John Mroz. Mroz wanted to expand the festival into a major event featuring nationally known writers, but with only $2.72 in the festival bank account and meager support from the University, bringing these authors to Notre Dame seemed impossible. 
Salvation arrived at the hands of Father Charles Sheedy, then-dean of the College of Arts and Letters, who gave Mroz his first contact -Joseph Heller, author of "Catch 22," Sheedy began exchanging letters with him shortly after the book's publication and soon, Mroz found success -Heller agreed to attend the festival. Soon, other writers responded, and the program expanded to include Norman Mailer, Wright Morris, Halph Ellison, Granville Hicks, William F. Buckley Jr., Kurt Vonnegut, and Isaac Bashevis Singer. 

National exposure 
The festival stirred up enthusiasm at a national level, and international film critics even attended to view Norman Mailer's new film, "Beyond the Law." 
Jr.'s assassination and 

President Lyndon B. Johnson's announcement to forego re­election. The authors' lectures and the final symposium were flavored with commentary on the recent events. Yet the festival managed to be both a suit­able celebration of the authors' literary talents and a fitting commentary on world issues. 
The festival has continued in the spir­it of the original, with increasing inter­action between the authors and stu­
dents. Past authors include John Knowles, Gwendolyn Brooks, Chaim Potok, Tennessee Williams, Robert Fitzgerald, Tom Clancy and Nikki Giovanni. 
This year, the festival moves to November and expands into a month­long celebration of fiction, poetry, film and song. This year's featured authors are as diverse as their work. 

Patricia Smith 

Patricia Smith, a performance poet, playwright, biographer and children's author, will be holding a question-and­answer session at Montgomery Auditorium in LaFortune at 4 p.m. on Tuesday, Nov. 13, and a poetry slam at 8 p.m. on the same day.

Her books of poetry include "Close to Death" and "Teahouse of the Almighty," which was chosen for the 2005 National Poetry Series. Her works of fiction include "Africans in America," "Janna and the Kings" and "Mahina, the Mad Mad Moon." Smith also per­forms with her band, Bop Thunderous, and sings with the jazz group Paradigm Shift.

"The atmosphere here this year is incredible," said Marvin Williams, one of three Hawks to put up a double-double with 20 points and 12 n~bounds. "It real­ly giv~;s us a boost of confi­dence. 
Atlanta led throughout the second half, but the Suns were right there when Nash drove for a basket with 4:42 remaining. Williams responded by hitting back-to-baek jumpers when left open at the top of the key. 
"I guess it was my night," he said. 
Actually, several players came up huge. Smith sealed it in the linal 2 minutns, lighting hard on the offensive boards to get a couple of chances off Joe Johnson's missed jumper. The second one rolled in, and Smith was fouled by Grant Hill. 
The Atlanta forward let out a yell and slapped hands hard with Ade Law, then went to the line and linished off the three­point play that gave the Hawks a 99-89 lead with 1:47 remaining. 
"We feel good about our chances this year," Smith said. "This is the team (Phoenix) that everyone has winning the NBA title this year. To play the way we played against them shows we belong in this league." 
Ilorford grabbed 15 rebounds to lead four Atlanta players in double figures. Smith had 10 rebounds for a double-double and the Hawks finished with a 56-40 rebounding edge, leading to a 29-9 advantage in second­chance points. Josh Childress also had 10 rebounds to go along with 19 points. 
Nash scored 34 points, but Shawn Marion, with 20, was the only other significant offensive contributor. The Suns played their third straight game with­out Amare Stoudemire, who sat out because of a sore knee. 
"We ran into a team that's more athletic than we are," Nash said, a huge compliment to the Hawks. 
Celtlcs 119, Nuggets 93 
liard to believe, but Boston's newest Big Three thinks it can play even better.

AP 

Kevin Garnett added 23 points and 13 rebounds, and the Celtics shot 72 percent during an overpowering first half en route to a victory over the Denver Nuggets on Wednesday night. 
"We are just scratching the surface on what we can do," Pierce said. "We enjoy seeing the next player make a great play and no one cares who gets credit." 
Boston improved to 3-0 overall and has won both its home games by an average of 24 points. Ray Allen scored 22 points and is shooting 63 per­cent since joining the Celtics. 
"They (Garnett, Pierce and Allen) like each other," Celtics coach Doc Rivers said. "They've all decided that they don't need anything individually and it is all about what's best for the team." 
The Celtics barely broke a sweat in building a 77-38 half­time lead. Boston had multiple uncontested layups, dunks and an array of' dazzling passes, out­rebounded Denver 25-9 and dominated essentially every sta­tistic on the box score. 
Allen Iverson led the Nuggets with 22 points, but Carmelo Anthony was held to only 11 on 3-of-13 shooting. Denver dropped an emotional game on Tuesday in New York, 119-112, after blowing a double-digit lead in the fourth quarter and has lost three straight overall. 
"It's a game we never had a shot in," Iverson said. "They jumped right on us and we were never able to take care of busi­ness."

CLASSIFIEDS 
Iverson appeared to be the only Nuggets player fazed by the huge early deficit. After Eduardo Najera picked up a technical early in the second quarter with Denver trailing 50­25, Iverson barked to referee Scott Wall, "We're down 25, isn't that enough'?" 
Rivers returned for Boston after missing a game due to the death of his father. 
"Doc has been preaching to us about repetition," Garnett said. "We knew Denver could put up 150 points if they wanted to, but 
we want to be defensive team."  known  as a  
Sixers 94, BobcaThe Bobcats  ts 63 went  from  

unbeaten in the lirst two games to beaten badly in the next two. 
So much for the confidence and momentum built olT their perfect start. 
Andre Iguodala scored 19 points, Willie Green had 14 and the Philadelphia 76ers jumped on Charlottf~ early and never let up in a win Wednesday night. sending the Bobcats back to .500 after a brief undefeated streak. 
"It all fell apart," Bobcats coach Sam Vincent said. 
The Bobcats played without point guard Raymond Felton after he hurt his left knee a night earlier against Phoenix. Without the speedy Felton lead­ing Charlotte's up-tempo offense, the Bobcats flopped from the start. 
Charlotte's 2-0 start was the first time the fourth-year team had ever been two games above .500 at any point. But the Bobcats were blown out by 32 points against the Suns on Tuesday night and then narrow­ly avoided a record-low point total, needing one last jumper against the Sixers to surpass the 62 scored against Houston on Dec. 8, 2006. 
"We just have to forget about it," guard Derek Anderson said. "We've got to figure out a way to do things right." 
Matt Carroll scored 16 points and Emeka Okaf'or had 11 points and 11 rebounds, but the Bobcats had 29 turnovers. 
While Charlotte has the same record (2-2) as the Sixers, the attitude was much more upbeat in the home locker room. Pieked to linish near the bottom of the Eastern Conference, the Sixers have been competitive in all four games and want to be over .500 by the end of their four-game homestand, whieh ends Sunday. 
Philadelphia coaeh Maurice Cheeks has stressed the impor­tanee of making the most of a favorable schedule that has the Sixers playing 14 of their first 23 games at home . 
"It helps when you have a chance to have a game like that," Cheeks said. 
The Sixers blew open the game in the second quarter and built a 20-point lead in front of about 6,000 fans. Not that the nearly empty arena mattered much to Philly. 
"When I'm playing, I'm just focused on the court," forward Rodney Carney said. "It could be 20,000 people or 5,000. I'm just concerned about winning."

NFL 
Associated Press 
NASHVILLE, Tenn. ­NFL commissioner Roger Goodell told Titans corner­back Adam "Pacman" Jones in April to sit out the 2007 season. On Tuesday, the commissioner informed Jones he still hasn't changed his mind. 
Jones had met with the commissioner last week in New York, pleading for some leniency and an early return. But the cor­nerback whose biggest community service was buying wrestling tickets for Atlanta students to watch him at a pay-per­view event last month did­n't convince Goodell. 
The commissioner told 


AP Tennessee Titan's comerback Adam "Pacman" Jones, right, is interviewed prior to his pro wrestling debut on Aug. 12. Jones' one-year suspension for violating the NR:s personal conduct policy was upheld by NFL commissioner Roger Goodell on Tuesday. 
Goodell upholds Jones' year-long suspension 
Jones his suspension will last through this season, which would include the playoffs if the Titans (6-2) qualify. 
"He will be eligible to begin working out at the Titans' facility following the conclusion of the team's season," the league said in a statement late Tuesday afternoon. 
Attorney Worrick Robinson said Jones received a letter from the NFL notifying him of the commissioner's decision earlier Tuesday. They planned to talk further Tuesday night and a for­mal statement may follow Wednesday. 
"He is very disappoint­ed," Robinson said. "We're 
looking at different options." 
Goodell had promised Jones' case would be reviewed after Tennessee's 1Oth game of the season. He met with Jones last Friday -two days before the Titans' eighth game. 
But the Titans, who have replaced their best defen­sive player, had been expecting the suspension to stand. 
"As we have said all through this process, we understood the suspension was for a year and made preparations to move our team forward without Adam Jones," the team said in a statement. "We will continue to monitor his situation and will 
page 13 

address his future when he is reinstated by the com­missioner." 
Goodell originally sus­pended Jones in April for violating the league's per­sonal conduct policy. At the time, Jones had been arrested five times since the Titans drafted him with the sixth overall pick in the 2005 draft. 
The suspension followed a Las Vegas strip club fight Feb. 19 in which police accused Jones of inciting a fight inside that led to a triple shooting outside that left one man paralyzed. Jones was arrested on two felony counts of coercion in June after dropping an appeal of his NFL punish­ment. 
IN BRIEF Clemens signs with Astros as 

personal-services consultant 
ORLANDO, Fla.-Roger Clemens is ready to join the Houston Astros -as a consultant. 
In a sign that Clemens' pitching career could be over, his agent told the Astros on Wednesday that the seven-time Cy Young winner is set to start his personal-services contract with the team. 
"He's moving toward retirement and leaving open the possibility of playing," agent Randy Hendricks said. "As Roger has stated several times, he's failed at retirement repeatedly." 
Hendricks sent Astros owner Drayton McLane an e-mail informing him of the decision. This was the first time Hendricks formally told Houston that Clemens was ready to work ofT the field. 
It was not clear how Clemens would respond if the Yankees or Astros asked him to pitch next year. 

Angels' Matthews meets with 

MLB over HGH allegations 
NEW YORK -Los Angeles Angels outfielder Gary Matthews Jr. met with baseball officials Wednesday to discuss allegations that he received human growth hor­mone. 
Matthews was sent HGH in 2004 from a pharmacy being investigated for illegal distribution of perform­ance-enhancing drugs, The Times Union of Albany, N.Y., reported last winter. Matthews denied using HGH, which was not banned by baseball until 2005. 
Several other players implicated in receiving performance-enhancing drugs also have met with baseball officials. Baseball is trying to arrange an interview with Cleveland pitcher Paul Byrd, who said last month that he took HGH for a medical condition before it was banned. 
Bengals' Henry, recently

reinstated, in trouble again 
CINCINNATI -Receiver Chris Henry allegedly was involved in an altercation with a parking attendant on the eve of rejoining the Cincinnati Bengals from his eight-game suspen­sion. 
Henry practiced with the Bengals on Wednesday and will be eligible to play Sunday in Baltimore. Commissioner Roger Goodell sus­pended him for the first half of the season for repeatedly violating the NFL's conduct policy. 
The third-year receiver stayed out of trouble during the suspension and was allowed to practice with the team for the last two weeks. 
On Tuesday night, police in Newport, Ky., a suburb on the other side of the Ohio River within view of Paul Brown Stadium, were called to an entertainment district following a dispute over a parking fee.

Nevv clock rules 111ake games faster 
Associated Press 

Tho NCAA's rules changes have done what they wore expected to do to college foot­ball this season. 
More kickoffs are being returned, more plays are being run and more points are being scored. On a less positive note, more games are dragging on. 
The most sig­nilieant changes dealt with kick­offs and the doek. 
Kickoffs now takn plaec from the kicking team's 30 instead of the 
35. The idea was to eliminate some of the bor­ing touchbacks 

"It's been interesting to see the d{[ferent philosophies teams have taken in regard to the kickoff." 
Sylvester Croom Mississippi State coach 
and create more opportunities for exciting returns. 
Mission accomplished. 

Last season, there were about six kickofl's returned per game. That number is up to almost nine this season. There wem 42 kickoff return touch­downs last season in 1,506 major eollege football games, including bowl games. This season there have alrnady been 50 in 1,099 games. 
"I think it adds to the game," Virginia Tech coach Frank Beamer said Wednesday dur­ing a conference call. "With not as many balls kicked into the end zone, that becomes a play in the ballgame that's impor­tant." 
Less touchbacks have also given offenses better starting field position. 
"There's a big difference in starting at the 35 and starting at the 20," Beamer said. 
The move has forced teams without strong-leg kicknrs to use unorthodox kickoff tech­niques. 
"It's been interesting to see the different philosophies teams have taken in regard to the kickoff," Mississippi State coach Sylvester Croom said. 
Squib kicks that bounce down the field have becom1~ more popular. Otlwr tnams 
have resorted to short, high kicks that don't allow much chance of a return but rarely travel inside tho receiving team's 30. 
"I'm seeing morn blooper kicks this year than I have ever 
seen," Florida State coach Bobby Bowden said. "All those blooper kicks arn-not that exeiting." 
Teams with especially dan­gerous return men have been 
getting a stnady dose of bloops and squibs. 
"With the returners that I have, they don't kick it to them anymore, Arkansas coach Houston Nutt said. 
Arkansas run­ning back Felix Jones is averag­ing 31 yards per return with two 

"With not as many balls kicked into the end zone, that becomes a play in the ballgame that's important." 
Frank Beamer Virginia Tech coach 
touchdowns on 14 returns. The Razorbacks also will oceasion­ally use All-American Darrnn McFadden to return kicks. 
Nutt's overall opinion of the rule change seems to fall in line with most coaches. 
"I like it morn receiving. don't likn it when I'm kicking oil"," he said. 
The biggest eon1:nrn coaches had with the spot of kickoffs being moved back was the potential for more injuries because of the increasn in high-spend collision plays. 
The NCAA planned to moni­tor injuries on kickoffs and adjust the rule if necessary. Hon Courson, head trainer at (ieorgia and a nwmbnr of the National Athletic Trainers association, said the data will be studied at thn end of tho s1mson. 
The other major changes were to af'f'nct the lnngth of games. 
Last year, the NCAA impln­mnnted several rules to piek up the pace of games, which wore creeping toward an average of 3? hours to play. 
Tho solution was to keep the dock moving during a change of possession and to start the dock on kiekofl's when the ball 
was kicked instead of whm1 tho receiving team touched it. 
Those changes didn't go over well with coaches and ended up taking about 14 plays on aver­ago from each gamn, whieh led to a drop in scoring to about 48 points per 
game. 
Those rules wPnl repealed. 
"I think every rule change this season was in favor of the offense," Georgia coach Mark Hieht said.

Arenas has left knee drained again 
Coach expects guard to play at New Jersey 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -Even if Gilbert Arenas is having prob­lems with his left knee, Washington Wizards coach Eddie Jordan isn't quite ready to worry. 
Arenas' surgically repaired knee was drained for the second timf1 in three weeks Wednesday, forcing him to miss practice for a third consecutive day. Still, Jordan expects Arenas to play against New Jersey on Thursday night. 
"There's no red flags," Jordan said. "He just has to keep get­ting through his therapy, his rehab, and getting some rest when he can." 
Asked how long it might be until Arenas is 100 percent healthy, the coach said: "We don't know how long it's going to take. You know, Gil's pretty da~n good at "':?atever percent hf1 s at, anyway. 
Arenas said his knee felt stiff 

after Washington's last game, a 
94-82 loss to Orlando on 
Saturday that dropped the 
Wizards to 0-3. He hasn't prac­
ticnd sincf1. 
"It feels like a 5-pound weight is on it," Arenas said that night, adding he thought he might need to have fluid drained. His left knee also was drained of excess fluid Oct. 17. 
Arenas did not speak to reporters Wednesday, but he did refer to the knee on his blog. 
"I have to get my knee drained and get the fluid out so I can be ready for the next 15 days. I guess it's like a 15-day period after I drain my knee that I'm at 100 percent," the blog says. "There's no pain, it's just stiffness." 
Arenas spoke Saturday about tailing off in what was his first set of back-to-hack games since hurting his knee in April. 
"That's where I thought he wasn't his explosive self," Jordan said. "That's the only game." 
Arenas made his first three shots against Orlando, then went 2-for-12 the rest of the way. He shot 0-for-4 on 3-point­ers that night, making him 1­for-17 from beyond the arc this season. Arenas is shooting 33 percent overall. 
"''m just shooting really bad right now," his blog says, "but I'll get the mojo back in a minute." 
The Wizards began the season by playing three games in four nights, and they have another such stretch now: Thursday's game is followed by one at home against Denver on Friday, then a game at Atlanta on Sunday. 
Arenas went five days without playing in an exhibition game after his knee was drained last month. But Wizards captain Antawn Jamison said Arenas told him he'll be ready to play Thursday. 
"From my understanding, he said he was mentally ready and physically he felt good," Jamison said. "So we'll see tomorrow." 
Added teammate DeShawn Stevenson: "Gil's a gamer. He can sit out five games and come out and play the way he plays. ... He's going to be all right." 
The Wizards probably could use Arenas against the Nets. New Jersey won all four of the teams' meetings last season, with Nets point guard Jason Kidd averaging a double-double in those games. 
Plus, there's this: Washington is shooting an NBA-worst 35.4 percent so far -only one other team, the Chicago Bulls, is under 40 percent -and aver­aging only 91.7 points, a decrease of more than 12 points from last season's output.

McNabb: I'm not only one to blame 
Associated Press 
PHILADELPHIA -Donovan MeNabb doesn't miss blocks or run wrong routes, and he can't be held responsible for the defense allowing points. 
So the five-time Pro Bowl quarterback feels it's unfair to blame him for the Philadelphia Eagles' 3-5 start. 
'Tm definitely not the whole reason why we lost these games," McNabb said Wednesday. "Can I help? Yes, I can. But I'm not fully to blame for everything that goes on around here. I can help, but I'm not that main solution. I'm a piece of the puzzle, and when the puzzle's put together, then we'll have success." 
Just two days after coach Andy Reid left the door slight­ly open for a change at his position, McNabb seemed a bit defensive. 
"We all have to play well," he said. "We all have to do our jobs individually. If we all step up and do our job, then we wouldn't be sitting here right now (at 3-5). But I'm definitely not the single rea­son for what's going on right now." 
McNabb had a fumble and two interceptions in a 38-17 loss to Dallas on Sunday night, with two of those turnovers leading to 14 points in the first half. 
Asked Monday if McNabb would remain the starter for the rest of the season, barring injury, Reid said: "That's where I'm looking at things. Again, nothing is guaranteed. That's how I'm looking at it, yes." 
The fact Reid said it's not "guaranteed" was a departure from the coach's usual stance. Instead, the honest response suggests Reid would consider benching McNabb at some point, especially if Philadelphia was mathemati­cally eliminated. 
The Eagles are last in the NFC East and trail nine teams in the conference. With rookie Kevin Kolb expected to be McNabb's eventual successor, the future could come as early as next month. 
McNabb, of course, wouldn't support that decision. 
"No, that's my job," he said. "Why would I want to give up my job?" 
Less than one year removed from knee surgery for a torn ligament, McNabb clearly isn't the same player who led the 
Eagles to four consecutive NFC title games and one Super Bowl. 
However, his mobility is improving and his overall numbers this season are respectable. McNabb has a 
59.9 completion percentage, 2,044 yards passing, nine touchdowns, four intercep­tions and a passer rating of 86.3. 
''I'm not happy about the way I've played," McNabb said. "I have to do my job bet­ter, and everyone else has to, as well." 
Teammates rallied around McNabb, offering support and flatly dismissing any need for a switch. 
"Everything that goes wrong on this team is not Donovan's fault," running back Brian Westbrook said. "Everything from fumbles to interceptions to sacks, those are not all Donovan's fault, not totally. Because it's a team sport, one man can't make a football team.... I've seen Donovan do great things, and I know he still has that in him." 
Backup QB A.J. Feeley agreed. 
"He's getting better," Feeley said. "You make changes where there's problems. If you're going to make a corre­lation between the quarter­back play and the problems, I don't see it. I don't see a need for a change." 
The Eagles could use the final eight games to make a decision on McNabb for next season. McNabb is signed through 2013, but he certain­ly won't be around to collect the $52.4 million he's due to earn in the last four years of his contract. 
His base salary next year is $6.3 million and $9.2 million for 2009. If the team feels starting Kolb next year would­n't be a significant down­grade, McNabb could be used as trade bait. Or McNabb could be let go if the organi­zation decides to rebuild and let Kolb get on-the-job experi­ence. 
Despite the speculation, McNabb still thinks he'll end his career in Philadelphia. 
''I'm sure you probably won't write that, but I do," he said. "Everyone goes through ups and downs. All quarter­backs do. Brett Favre went through it; other quarterbacks have. This is a situation, if you continue to build, do you start over? It's not my deci­sion, but I expect to be here."

Gardner-Webb stuns Kentucky 
Gillispie loses to mid­major in second game 
Associated Press 

LEXINGTON, Ky. -Billy Gillispie's second game as Kentucky's eoach was one he'd rather forget -and Gardner­Webb will remember for a long time. 
Grayson Flittncr scored 22 points to help Gardner-Webb beat the No. 20 Wildcats H4-68 Wednesday night in the 2K Sports College I loops Classic. 
"You can't just. show up on the court and think you're going to beat somebody because you wear a certain jer­sey," said Gillispie, who turned 48 WndnPsday. "We didn't play like a huntnr tonight." 
Instead, the Wildcats were thn prey the entire game, falling behind 14-0 and never cutting the deficit undnr seven points. 
"A Jot of people will think this is a misprint, but I hope not," Gardner-Webb coach Hick Scruggs said. "I hope they get to see it and can enjoy it. It's going t~ take a few days to set­tle in." 
Kentucky, Division J's win­ningest program, hadn't lost a regular-season game to a mid­major since falling to Western Kentucky on Nov. 15, 20()1, in that season's opener. It lost to Alabama-Birmingham in 2004 in the first round of the NCM tournamnnt. 
Kentucky's last home loss to an unranknd nonconfernnce !'on was Dec. 3, 2005, against North Carolina. 
"It's embarrassing when you lose, especially when it happens at home," Kentucky forward 


Perry Stevenson said. "We've just got to keep working hard and make sure it doesn't hap­pml again." 
The tournament, benel'iting Coaches vs. Cancer, had been set up to send four top pro­grams -No. 3 Memphis, Connecticut, Oklahoma and Kentucky to Nnw York next wonk to play in the semifinals. 
However, instead of the Wildcats, Gardner-Webb, whieh finished 9-21 last season and tied for seventh in the Atlantic Sun Conference, will play the winner of Thursday night's gamn between Buffalo and Connecticut. 
"We had confidence," Gardner-Webb forward Thomas 
Sanders said. "We wanted to play four minutes at a time and go timeout to timeout and give ourselves a chanen to win in thn final minutns. We ondnd up not nnnding to do that, though." 
As it turnt)d out, the Wildcats IHwnr had control of this gamn, trailing 14-0 just 4 minutes in, missing its lirst li1ur shots and turning tht~ ball over four times during that span. 
Flittner hit a critical 3 mid­way through the lirst half that opened the Bulldogs' lead to 26-10. 

Kentueky cut tho dnl'ieit to seven loss than 3 minutes later on a long jurnpnr by Joe Crawford but would get no dos­er.

years, they have not simply bmm beating up on weak con­fenmce foes. Irish coach Handy Waldrum has frequently said that the Big East is much stronger than it was even five years ago. The conference boasts four top-25 teams. 
In the semifinals of the Big East tournament this Friday in Morgantown, W. Va, the Irish will take on Georgetown. In their first meeting with Georgntown, who upsni No. 24 Connecticut Sunday, the Irish beat the I loyas 3-0. 
If thn Irish are able to dis­patch Georgetown. they will play tho winner of tho other semifinal between No. 12 West Virginia and No. 23 Louisville. On Sept. 28, the Irish defeated Louisville 1-0 on the road. dnspite a hostile Cardinals crowd that Waldrum called one of the most intimidating in the country. 
If host West Virginia beats Louisville, it may prove to be the most difficult conference test the Irish face. The Mountaineers (14-4-1) have won their past five matches, including a 1-0 win over Villanova in the quarterfinals. 
Early in the season, the Irish defense might have had severe trouble against West Virginia. But the Notre Dame back line should be able avoid the mental mistakes that plagued it in its first few games together. Irish defenders Elise Weber, Julie Scheidler and Lauren Fowlkes, all newcomers to the squad, sufl'ered several difficult losses

during the first month of play but have grown into a dominant unit. The defense, which is led by junior Carrie Dew, has regis­tered seven shutouts in confer­ence play. 
In a possible final against West Virginia, there is also no reason to think that the Irish offense would be unable to pep­per the back of the net like it has the past month. The Mountaineers recently lost 2-0 to Connecticut and surrendered three goals in a win over Georgetown. 
The Irish attack is led by jun­ior Kerri Hanks, who recently became the third player in NCAA history to notch 50 goals and 50 assists before her senior year. 
And Bock should return to provide a potent threat in the air on Hanks' corner kicks and sophomore forward Michelle Weisenhofer's long throw-ins. Bock has 16 header goals in less than three seasons with the. Irish. When senior midfielder Amanda Cinalli is added to the offensive mix, the Irish can con­trol the tempo against anyone. 
So unless the Hoyas or Mountaineers can figure out something as difficult as finding a proverbial needle in a haystack, the Irish should cap­ture their 1Oth Big East crown during their 13 years in the league.

"They've done a great job of not just breaking tackles but creating vapor tackles. There are tacklers there, and they're just swinging at air." 
The Cardinals were a top 10 earlier this season, but their poor defense and sloppy play has made them one of the big­ger disappointments in the country. 
Still, a strong finish and lots of help could still get them back to the BCS for a second straight season. 
The way things have gone this season in the Big East, anything seems possible. 
"Hopefully they have a sad bus ride or plane flight home," Slaton said.
