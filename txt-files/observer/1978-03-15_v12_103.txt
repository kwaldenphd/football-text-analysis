Faculty votes for -'informality' 
by Dave Rumbach Senior Staff Reporter 
The Faculty Senate last night unanimously approved what one member called "a step in the right direction' 'towards informalizing teacher-student relationships. 
In response to an appearance by Mark Huard, a student member of the Campus Life Council, the Senate gave its Stu­dent Affairs Committee "blanket authority" to " do anything it deems helpful" to improve the present situation. 
Huard sought endorsement from the Senate for a proposed arrange­ment with the dining halls which would allow faculty members to eat lunch or dinner with students four times between April 1 and the end of the semester. Huard stressed getting students and teachers out of the "structured" classroom and establishing "an informal basis for friendship." 
Acting on a Nov. 3 request by the Senate, Prof. James Dougherty presented a joint committee pro­posal to "formalize" the group of faculty advisors used by the Pro­vost in making recommendations to University President Theodore Hesburgh concerning tenure and promotion decisions. 

The proposal, which would have specified the members of the 
"advisory council" to the Provost, was soundly defeated by the Senate in two separate votes. 
According to the proposed amendment, the advisory council to the Provost on matters of promo­tion and tenure would have been composed of the following: the deans of the various colleges, the Law School, and the Freshman Year of Studies; the Vice-President for Advanced Studies; the Asso­ciate Provost; and five tenured faculty members 
The proposal grew out of faculty concern with an amendment to the Academic Manual which specifies the advisors to the Provost only as "such . . . as he may choose." Formalizing--by specifying its make-up--would make the council' a meetings a matter of University record. 
Dougherty, chairman of the Senate Administration Committee, urged passage of the proposal before the appointment of an permanent Provost. "It is my feeling that now is the time to do it . . . to do it in another year would be a reflection on the personality of the Provost." Dougherty stated. 
Prof. John Lyon opposed the proposal because it would have created "another group which the tenure candidate must pass but without the accountability of the 
C.A.P. (Committee on Appoint­ments and Promotions)" 
One Senator criticized the pro­posal, stressing the importance of ''keeping the working frame of the Provost as uncluttered as pos­sible." "An effective Provost will take these freedoms anyway, and if he's a poor one, this will help neither him nor us," he stated. 
In other business, Katharina Blackstead, chairman of the Fa­culty Affairs Committe, announced that the proposal aimed at increas­ing job security for faculty mem­bers classified as "special profess­ionals" was currently being re­worked. Blackstead informed the Senate that the policy in question was being recon~idered by those special professionals within each department with "goals of remov­ing some of the vagueness while preserving the flexibility.''

Tentative agreement reached in coal talks 
Washington [AP] Bargainers for the United Mine Workers and the coal industry agreed yesterday on new contract terms that both sides hoped stubborn miners would ac­cept to end their 90-day old strike. 
UMW President Arnold Miller summoned his union's bargaining council to Washington, and a spokesman said the group was likely to vote tonight on the tentative agreement. 
"We think we have a package that would be very good for the union, very good for the country, and get our mines back to work and the country on its feet," said Nicholas T. Camicia, chief industry bargainer. 
"1 think we've got a good agreement," said Miller, although ·he declined to predict whether the union's rank and ftle membership would ratify the proposal. 
The union's ratification process normally takes about 10 days and Miller said he wouldn't rush the process. Under the union's consti­tution, if the bargaining council were to vote Wednesday, the earliest rank-and-file miners could vote would be Monday. 
The council rejected one tenta­tive proposal on Feb. 12, and the rebellious membership voted down a proposal sanctioned by the UMW leadership more than a week ago. 
Both sides are pinning their hopes on approval by the miners to avert the possibility of further federal intervention and to pre­serve industry-wide bargaining.

White House press secretary Jody Powell said President Jimmy Carter was "pleased and encour­aged" by the tentative agreement. 
Negotiators announced their deal as miners by the tens of thousands continued to ignore a federal back-to-work order. The Justice Department, meanwhile, continued to pursue a policy of non-confronta­tion in enforcing the order issued under the Taft-Hartley Act. 
Justice Department spokesman Mark Sheehan said the government still is scheduled to go to U.S. District Court in Washington on Friday to argue for an 80-Q.ay cooling off period under terms d the Taft-Hartley Act. 
But he said the Justice Depart­ment probably would agree to seek a 10-day extension of an existing restraining order if the UMW and coal operators agree to such a move. 
The White House said the 151 mines that were shut down last week are now open. Most of them are non-UMW mines, according to Powell. / 
Negotiators for the two sides in the long and bitter strike met for a littlemorethan three hours in a final session before agreeing to terms. 
It appeared that both sides made concessions, although the Bitumi­nous Coal Operators Association seemed to give more. 
Sources said that under the new proposal miners would still be required to pay a portion of their health care costs, but the sums would be far less than was called for under the contract miners rejected a week ago. 
Sources also said the industry gave up its long fight for at least limited contract controls on wildcat 
strikes  but  won  some  form  of

Dining haiii.D. machines removed 
by Aim Galefl Senior Staff Reporter 

According to Terry O'Leary, director of SAGA food services in the North Dining Hall, the compu­terized J.D. checking machines installed in the dining halls at the beginning of this semester "simply · are not capable of handling the type of work we give them, and will not be used in the future." O'Leary revealed that the machines will probably be repla~ed by a different type of computerized machine. 
The machines installed at Notre Dame were "somewhat experimen­tal," O'Leary said, in that they use a method of reading the computer­ized information on the card that has never been tried before. 
"At other universities where computerized systems are usea, they have experienced problems with frayed J.D.'s getting stuck in the machines because the cards have to be pushed through a slot past a stationary reader,'' he explained. 
The machines installed in the Notre Dame dining halls were designed to eliminate this problem. Thus, the computer reader used in the machines has a movable floa­ting head that is pulled across the inserted J.D. card by a motor. 
"The movable head has been effective in solving the problem of 
I.D.'s getting stuck, but unfortu­nately it cannot read the informa­tion and convey it to the computers well enough for our purposes,"· O'Leary stated. 
O'Leary said that a machine like the ones used by Marquette and other llLniversities has been shipped to NotJre Dame and is expected to arrive today or tomorrow. This machine will have a stationary rather than a movable head so that the I.D. card will have to be pushed through a slot by a checker in order for th(~ information on the black band of the card to be read. 
"The new machine will be tested in one of the dining halls this week, and if it works, we will hopefully have t~ight machines like it in­stalled by the time the students return from break," O'Leary sta­ted. He added that he has worked with the new type of machine before and has found it "much more reliable than the system presently installed here."

Thief stole for dying wife 

CLAYTON, MO. [AP] -Melvin Wagner, convicted of swindling his boss out of nearly 5100,000, says he did it to buy nice things for his wife because "I knew she was going to die, and I wanted the last two years of her life to be happy." 
Wagner, 58, who was convicted on Jan. 24 of operating a phony company to steal $97,000 from a soap products plant, said he began the operation after learning in 1973 that his wife, Lea, had terminal cancer. 
On Monday, St. Louis County Circuit Court Judge Jmaes reddy sentenced Wagner to eight years in prison but then reduced the sen­tence to five years' probation. 
''There was one reason for it and one reason only: His wife way dying,'' the judge said of the theft. "He had worked for the company for 37 years and was booest before his wife's illness. He stopped the theft after she died." 
Wagner said be spent most of the money on his wife, paying for vacations, a luxury automobile and other gifts. the couple had two grown children. 
Wagner, who was warehouse foreman at the soap pro6ucts plant, devised a complicated scheme in which he set up a dummy company, A&G PaJiet Co., that submitted low bids for wooden casings to the soap firm. 
By doctoring the paperwork, Wagner made it appear that the dummy company had gotten the contracts, and then filled the orders 
from the company's regular inven­
tory. 
Ruddy said that after Wagner's wife died, "It appears he was desirous of getting caught. He later raised the prices so the company would reject the bids. I guess that's when they got sus­picious." 
By the time he was caught, Wagner had spent the· entire sum, and wa~ paying the remaining debt on an $8,000 automobile he bought before his wife died. 
Wagner still faces legal action from the company's insurance representatives, who want to regain the stolen money. And the Internal Revenue Service says it wants tax paytnents on the money· Wagner was convicted of stealing_. 
But officials said a 40-year-old man died Monday when the three terrorists occupied the Drente provincial government complex in a wooded suburban park of this northern\ Dutch city. 
Three hostages were slightly 
wounded yesterday and another 
was badly wounded by the 
terrorists, who were arrested. a 
government spokesman said. An 
official said the gunmen carried 
"light arms.'' 

"They're free, they're free," a 
marine officer yelled into his radio 
as the marines secured the 
building. four stories of concrete 
and glass colored blue and gray. 

"I think we were all very lucky, especially the hostages," said a policeman. The released captives. shaken but smiling, were escorted to an emergency aid center set up at a skating rink nearby, prior to precautionary sessions with psy­chiatrists and reunion with their families. 
The marine unit. 100 strong in all. was the same one that stormed a train and a school near Assen last summer to end 20-day twin sieges by another band of Moluccan extremists and rescue more than 150 hostages. 
That terror incident turned many Dutchmen against the South Molucc:ans who came to live with their former colonial ~asters here when their homeland -also known as the Spice Islands -became part of independent Indonesia in 1949. 


Young militants among Hol­land's 40,000-strong Moluccan community have terrorized this country periodically for a decade, trying to prod the Dutch into intervening with Indonesia for South Moluccan independence. 
Indonesia also is a former Dutch colony, but the Dutch government says it can do nothing to aid the Molucc:an cause. 
In this case, the terrorists originally threatened to start killing their captives at 2 p.m. yesterday if the Dutch did not meet their demands: the release of 21 comrades jailed after the terror action last summer and one in 1975. a plane out of the country with some of the hostages, and a $13 million ransom. 
But Justice Minister Job de Ruiter. speaking to parliament in The Hague after the siege ended, said the gunmen early yesterday demanded two Moluccan com­munity leaders be sent in as go-betw·eens, and told the media­tors of a new deadline. ·

Thus, the com­pany purchased the reading end of the system from one manufacturer and the computer end from ano­ther, he said. 
"They tried to put together the best of both worlds, but one of the worlds, the reading end of the system, simply was not good enough," O'Leary stated. He add­ed, however, that the computer end of the present system "is very good and has worked well so far." 
O'Leary stressed that none of the machines have been paid for yet. "We don't have to pay for anything until we find a satisfactory sys­tem," he said. · 
O'Leary remarked that despite all the problems that have been encountered thus far in the installa­tion of a computerized system, he still believes that the system "will be a good investment in the long run since it will provide us with information valuable for planning and controlling food costs."

Powerful Portraits 
Photographs that transcend mere photo­journalism and enter into the realm of art; powerful portraits that document, and indeed, cry of immediacy, yet somehow imply an enduring aesthetic value--such is the nature of W. Eugene Smith's artistry, some of which is on display this month at the University Art Gallery. 
Gene Smith is, in the words of Popular Photography writer Arthur Goldsmith, "a Rome plow of photojournalism: a super bulldozer cutting swaths through the jungle of human complacency and indif­ference. He needs big themes." 
Finding big themes never posed much of a problem for Smith, who spanned the globe from the South Pacific to Pittsburgh to capture images that ranged from mercury poisoning to suffering and pollu­tion, in his unique and immortal style. 
"In the first two photos of the Univer­sity's display, one can clearly see the documentary style of the photojournal­ism," remarked museum curator Steve

The Impact of HHarlan ~ County, U.S.A." 
greg solman 

Spiro on Smith's World War Two photo­graphs depicting soldiers on Saipan," but as the series progresses chronologically, I think you can more easily see Smith's sensitivity to form and style, until, in his later work, the photographs almost become abstract in design--almost for the sake of design alone." 
"It is this balance of his social concern and his formal sensitivity to photography that makes Smith's work unique and very nice." 
The exhibition at the University Art Gallery, organized by the InternationalMmum of Photography at George Eastman f!:ouse, presents selections from photographic essays on Pittsburgh, Dr. Albert Schweitzer in the "Man of Mercy" series, migrant workers, Welsh miners and Japan. In each, Smith's incredible power to evoke emotion is evident, and even to the untrained eye, one immediately recog­nizes that Smith's work does indeed surpass the simple documentation of news events. 
susan grace 
whether he could afford to deny his children food in the name of the coal miners' cause. 
The lack of objectivity may, however, have been appropriate to the issue, at least for me. I tend to be completely secure in my life here, where the fulfillment of my basic needs is taken for granted, and I am left free to deal with the luxury of other kinds of problems. Perhaps it is appro­priate that I be overexposed to Harlan County for this two hour period, under the assumption that uDless my sympathies are greatly aroused, I will find it alltooeasy to forget that the problem exists, will neglect to examine and develop an opinion on the issue, and refuse to take responsibility for it. I must admit that I am a part of a system that does not allow for the effective expression of grievances, that perpetuates a state of living and working conditions that should be a national as well as personal cause for shame. 
In other words, I have to let the story the film told strike my conscience as well as my mind and my heart. My initial reaction to the film as I walked out onto the South Quad was to just not talk about it, to forget 
' ,it-an easy wasy to deal with it. But I should be,made to think about it, and to talk about it.' and to address its reality. "Harlan C\ounty U.S.A." strove to stimulate that :kind of a dialogue, and the fact that 2800 ~le here sat to see it attests to its succes:<>. Maybe now, before I complain ~nit the sacrifices I have to make to conserve the energy the coal miners produce, I'll remember why the ACC is closing early, and why the hot fudge machine in the Huddle is cold, and why our old illuminated golden dome now recedes into the dark of the night.

Last week, twenty-eighth1r .:lrect Notre Dame/Saint Mary's student~. faculty and administrators, waded over to the En­gineering building to watch the award winning documentary film, "Harlan Coun­ty U.S.A.". I was among them. The object of the film was to relate the histol'} and reality of the coal miners' struggle to attain the right to unionize and to lead safe and decent lives. I was a typically naive subject for its purpose. I was interested in the issue, but never had taken the initiative to explore it-unless, that is, one can call the addressing of a few casual questions to whomever happened to be sitting next to me at dinner an active concern for the issue. 
I went into the film in the state of ignorance, expecting to be presented with a sensational appeal to my sympathetic emotions. I was surprised. The movie appealed more to my mind than to my heart. The potential for a tear-jerker was there-the viewer was exposed to the wretched living and working conditions of the American coal miners and their families, to the filth, hunger, hazards and desperation of the people. Those problems lie at the core of the issue. Their existence evidences a deprivation of basic human rights that has, throughout the twentieth century, incited the coal miners to rise in protest. 
But for me, this was not the focal point of the film. It was directed at what happened-or did not happen-when thf! workers did stand up to demand action in response to their grievances. I was struck by the apparent futility of the demonstra­tions, by the length of time it took to make any kind of progress, and by the small m11gnitude of accomJ?lishments.to-sbow for 
months of fear and sacrifice during the 
strike. 

, I was struck by the immense personal 
and political obstacles working to thwart 
the miners' right to "strike. 

I was struck by the methods of protest the miners resorted to in order to create awareness and incite action-the same rnethods they have had to use for seventy years. over and over again, to be broken as a coalition over and over again. The most effective scene in the film for me showed a woman, who had been a hard, cold and strong figure in "the club", breaking down in tears while telling of the pain her family endured throughout its history in fighting the miners' rights. She was broken-her family had been broken by their power­lessness in a situation that left them ignorant of what rights they could claim for themselves, and of a method to effectively and peacefully claim them. 
I was struck, too, when I realized that I had to look again at the de~ee of objectivity the issue was being present.?.d in. It was not objective. The director was somewhat critical of the miners' decision to carry guns on the picket lines in protecting themselves from the scabs, but real attention was never given to the objects of their anger, the scabs themselves. There was one brief interview with a frightened strike breaker, but it didn't a.ttempt to bring to light the anguish those men must have been feeling in breaking the picket line. It didn't allow them to explain w.~1y they violated the strike, why they. -niight not have agreed with the strikers' Jbethods in violating other peoples' right§<; .:.bile claim­ing their own, in chastisifng a man for exercising his right to dc~de for himself

.-A---il> 
Of particular note are Smith's seven photographs from the "Pittsburgh" series of 1955-57, an essay on which Smith was supposed to have expended most of his energy. These photos depict urban blight. And, as in much of his other work, the images may sometimes seem repetitious in theme--an exploration in "depth rather than breadth." 
This has been a trademark of Smith's S~Jle. Goldsmith writes, "By the very nature of the subject, he is limited to a narrower spectrum of events and environ­ments, a claustrophobic nightmare, in effect...but their cumulative weight, and the impact of some individual images, is overpowering.'' 
Smith, who worked for Ufe and News­week during the span of his career, is probably best known for his series entitled "Minamata," after a fishing village in the south of Japan that was laid waste by mercury poisoning in 1971. The poisoning of Minamata Bay, which effected the fish and later the villagers, wks caused by the dumping of waste products into the bay by the Chisso Chemical Company. 
Smith's camera captured the torture of tke inflicted people, who lost their motor control, speech, consciousness and even­tually life to the so-called "ugly" disease. 
Nothing measures the power of an essay more clearly than the consequences that follow its publishing. It is therefore significant that the Chisso Company felt so threatened by Smith's power, that they hired strongharms' to beat Smith, perman-_ ently impairing his vision. 
"He grabbed me ana &~eked me m the crotch and cameras, then hit me in the stomach," recalled Smith. "Then they picked me up and dragged me out and slammed my head against the concrete." As Popalllr Photography noted in relating the story, such is not done to still a small voice, and Smith remains somewhat of a folkbero in Japan even to this day. 
Unfortunately, the Minamata series is 
not here on display, but parts of one of his 
Japan essays is present. This series, too, 
is sterling in composition. 
Smith's work is not completely domin­
ated by man's shady side. One brilliant 
example is "A Walk Through Paradise 
Garden," which is an amazing silhouette of 
two children, band in band, seemingly 
entering the'Garden of Eden. 
It was the first post-war picture Smith 
attempted, and seems a vivid visual 
representation of the author's war-cor­
respondence catharsis...an expression of 
the dawning of a new age. 
"According to a story about him," 
related Spiro, proudly noting that the 
picture has been recently purchased by the 
University Art Gallery, "Smith said, after 
be had taken the picture, that he would 
have quit photography had this particular 
picture not turned out the way he wanted it 
to." 

Many would argue that it couldn't have 
turned out much better. Smith obviously 
agreed, to a certain extent at least, and 
continued his work forever seeking small 
ethereal strength to, as he put it, "criticize 
and illluminate and give compassionate 
understanding." 
"I doubt that existence of any perfec­
tion," writes Smith, "Although I am for 
trying the rise to this and would take 
measure from such failure rather that from 
the convenience of a safe but mundane 
success.'' 

Explosions cause gas leak; lead to short evacuation

Last month, eight people -vere killed when a railroad tanl!~llf­derailed and ruptured in the Fll'­rida Panhandle, spewing chlorine gas across a highway. 
Steubenville Mayor William Crabbe ordered downtown streets cleared for fear the chlorine fumes would spread. He ordered all available police, fire and rescue personnel to the site of the blasts. 
Red Cross spokesman Terry Hosfelt, said the victims--many of them firemen--were overcome in the first hour after the explosion, 
which  occurred  shortly  before  
noon,  and many  just fell  in their  
places.  

"We lost 15 at a shot. It was just like somebody shot them," Hosfelt said. 
Hosfelt said the victims com­plained of breathing difficulties and nausea. 
He said authorities told him there was one major and several smaller explosions at the National Colloid Co. and the Famous Supply co., a heating company. 
National Colloid president Mi­chael J. Barber said he was not at the water chemical company when the blasts occurred. 
"Two girls working in the office said they heard a strong hissing noise and the wall came out," he said. 
He said the company is distri­butor for "hard"chemicals such as chlorine. 
Allen Franks, a spokeman for the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency, said that at the time of the explosion there were 20 cylinders of pure chlorine gas atNational Colloid, weighing 150 pounds each, along with 30,000 pounds ofHTH, which is a 70 percent chlorine mixture put in swimming pools, and unknown amounts of sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid and soda ash. 
~r4 die in Argentine prison riot 
EIUENOS AIRES* [AP] -Inmates at Argentina's largest prison attacked guards and set fire to bedding and furniture yesterday and police said 44 persons died and 30 were injured seriously before the riot was crushed.
