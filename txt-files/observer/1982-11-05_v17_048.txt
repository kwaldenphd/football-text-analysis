CHICAGO (AP) -Democratic challenger Adlai E. Stevenson pulled to within 171 votes of Republican Gov. James R. Thompson yesterday with more than. 3.5 million ballots counted and thousands still out in a race headed toward one of the closest finishes in Illinois history. 
The incumbent's margin -less than five one-thousandths of one percent -held after a nearly com­plete unofficial tally of returns from the Democratic stronghold of Chicago. 
But it appeared that even after the last votes were tabulated, the na­tion's only undecided race for governor might remain just that un­til the State Board of Elections cer· tifies the vote Nov. 22. 
Returns had yet to be reported from 15 precincts in the city, where five ballot boxes were turned in empty and 10 more were reported missing, officials said. They es­timated that 5,000 potential votes were involved. It was not certain when those totals woud be available. 
Results also were not expected until this morning for 106 suburban Cook County precincts, the county clerk's office said. The clerk would give no estimate of the number of ballots from those areas. Thompson had generally run ahead in the sub-
New parietals trial _periodbegins Monday 
By TONI RUTHERFORD 
StaffReporter 
Weekday parietals are "a really posltlve influence in terms of programs and activities at Saint Mary's," according to Sister Karol Jackowski, diretor of residence life and housing. 
Sunday, Nov. 7 is the beginning of the trial period for the new Saint Mary's parietals hours, which will be in effect until May. It is a large step for Saint Mary's to implement Sun­day and weeknight parietals. Weekend hours will remain the same, but the hours from 5 p.m. to 10 p.m. will be added from Sunday through Thursday. Jackowski feels that weekday parietals will prove less of a problem than weekend parietals. 
Students will work the desk to recieve the visitors' ID's until an evaluation of weekday traffic is made, probably at the end of the semester. Ifthe traffic is as low as ex· pected, the ID's may be handled at the front desk. If it is heavier, stu­dents can expect about double the hours they now work. 
"Given the way students live during the week, I don't anticipate much socializing," said Jackowski. She feels that the benefits ofthe new parietals will be the likelihood of

Pursuing subjects of interest was emphasized last night at the Career Development lecture as the bes~. way to-chose a major. A liberal artS education was encouraged because it allows students to try several dif­ferent fields. 
Sharon McKernan, who graduated from Saint Mary's in 1975 with a government degree and now works for Merrill Lynch in Washington 
D.C. as a stockbroker, spoke to stu­dents last night on career developm­ment. j 
She stressed that students should pursue subjects of interest because, as she explained, "too many people focus on one narrow road. The purpose of college is to broaden your knowledge. Once college is over, there is less time and it is more difficult to spend time finding a field ofinterest." 
She felt undergraduates should apply for summer jobs in their field of interest while still in school She also emphasized extracurricular ac­tivities and internships as ways of finding career goals. McKernan ex· plained to the students ho.w she started as an English major, traveled on the Innsbruck program with Notre Dame, switched majors to his­tory, and finally in her senior year decided to major in government. 
Throughout her lecture she stressed having confidence in one's ability and not becoming dis­couraged about job prospects for one's major. As she stated, "Your first job is usually out ofyour field of study." In her office, there are 52 ac· count executives, and out of these, five were not liberal arts majors. 
McKernan offered some advice on finding a job after college. "Job hun­ting after college is tough and you must be persistent." She said it would be beneficial to talk to people working in an area of interest and then she suggested interviewing just for the experience of interviewing. It took McKernan three to four we~ks of pavement pounding every day before landing her job at Merrill Lynch. Even then, she started as a sales representative and worked her way up. "There is nothing wrong with starting at the bottom," she says, "as long as it's not a dead end." The important things she em­phasized were not to get dis· couraged and to take risks. 
urbs, but it was not known exactly what areas the missing precincts covered. 
Rick Jasculca, a spokesman for Stevenson, said the challenger was not backing off a declaration of vic· tory made late Wednesday night by his candidate's campaign chairman, James Otis. 
"I see nothing that would cause me to waver from that," he said yes­terday. "All the numbers seem to be pointing to Stevenson as a winner." 
The mood was more guarded at Thompson headquarters, which would not predict the outcome of the race. 
"We're not going to say anything 
until we have a good idea o~ what's 
going on," said Da\·id Fields, a 
Thompson spokesman. "We're just 
going to be mum for awhile. We're 
not talking to anybody." 
David Gilbert, Thompson's pres5 secretary, had said late Wednesda} night he expected the governor would win an unprecedented third term by I 0,000 to 15,000 votes. 
With about 99 percent ofthe state precincts reported in unofficial returns, or 11,521 of the state's 11,642 polling places, Thompson had 1,786,632 votes to Stevenson's 1,786,461.

Mr. John OeCraene Locks Liquor World 2128 south Bend Avenue SOuth Bend, Indiana 46637 
Dear Messrs. Anderson and DeCraene: 
The University presumes that local retailers, for personal and professional reasons, share in our concern about alcohol abuse. We ask for your cooperation that the following policy might be effectively enforced: 
A. on campus 
\ 
No deliveries of beer--kegs, bottles or cans--wine or liquor to anyplace on campus, including the Green Field, except to legally licensed facilities of the University. We do make one or two exceptions to this when we approve ot the Senior Picnic, and the distributor is authorized to make delivery and to use his truck for dispensing on these occasions . 
8. Off Campus 
We have the impression that Indiana law authorizes a retailer to sell only one keq to a particular address. We have heard of instances in which retailers deliver five or six kegs to an off-campus address. Such deliveries directly result in large student parties in residential neighborhooc.ls and cause serious problems for the neighbors and for the police. 
We request you to make no deliveries of even one keg to a private residence. If a student wishes to purchase a keq for an off-campus party, he should purchase it at your place of business. 
I just returned from the Midwest Co~ference of Deans at the University of Illinois. Alcohol abuse was on the top of every­one • s problem list. The majority of these one hundred Deans said that alcohol abuse this year is the most serious they have 
experienced. You may also be aware that we have had a number of tragic accidents already this year as a result of alcohol abuse. For all these reasons, we are hoping for concern and cooperation on your part. 
. 
May we have your written conunents regarding the above issues. Thank you.

Two letters from Dean of Students James Roemer urging area retailers and dis· tributors to limit their deliveries of alcohol to students have been obtained by The Ob­seroer. 
In the letters, mailed in October, Roemer requested that the businesses stop the delivery of kegs to off-campus private residences. He referred to an Indiana state law limiting the sale of kegs to one per address. Roemer also cited the problems caused by large student parties for police and residents as reasons for the policy. 
Deliveries of all alcohol products to · campus locations are also banned. However, Roemer said that exceptions for licensed University facilities and approved events such as the Senior Picnic would be allowed. 
Enforcement of the policies was left up to the businesses. However, Roemer asked for replies and comments from the letter's recipients. 
In addition to King's Cellar and Locks Liq­uor World, the letters were sent to three lo­
cal  beer  distributors:  United  Bevera~s,  
Sunnyside  Beverages,  and  Michiana  
Beverages.  

Neither Roemer nor representatives for the businesses could be reached for a.om­ment. 
Student Body President Uoyd Burke said, "This isn't prohibition. The Safety ofthe stu­dents is his (Roemer's) main concern. I think he's trying to deal with a problem that's a very delicate situation." 
After hearing the contents of the letters, Off-Campus Commissioner Bill Colleran said he was "surprisedat how far theywent." ·

A record number of Americans drew un­
emplyment checks in mid-October, government figures showed yesterday, leading private economists to predict further deteriora· tion in an already tight job market. Statistics released by the Labor Department showed that more than 4.68 million people received unemployment checks in the week ending Oct. 16. The seasonally adjusted total was the highest since the unemployment compensa· tion program was enacted as a safety net for the jobless in the mid· 1930s. Officials with the department's Employment and Training Administration stressed that while the 4,687,000 figure was the big· hest ever, the situation is not as bad as it has been. They noted that the insured employment rate was 5.4 percent, which is below the 7 percent peak reached during the recession of 1975. Only insured workers draw benefits. -AP 
U.S. Marines armed with machine guns, rifles and pistols entered east Beirut for the first time yesterday, patrolling the Chris· tian militia heartland in jeeps and drawing a few cheers of"God bless America." The four-jeep convoy, with the Stars and Stripes fluttering from radio antennas, rolled out ofthe Marine base in predominantly Moslem west Beirut at 1:05 p.m. (6:05 a.m.) and headed to join 
French and Italian peacekeepers and Lebanese army troops in the east. The 14 Marines returned three hours later after completing their first mobile patrol since they arrived Sept. 29 following the massacre ofPalestinians in two west Beirut camps. The Marines said they encountered no problems in their two circuits of a corner of east Beirut. But they admitted being a little bewildered at their first real trip into the city. -AP 
ABrooklyn womanwho claimed that premenstrual stress caused her to beat her daughter has abandoned that defense strategy and pleaded guilty to a harassment charge. Shirley Santos, 25, originally charged with assault in the beating of the 4-year-old girl, Quadina, on Dec. 16, had argued that the charge should be dropped because stress from the approach of her menstrual period prompted the beating. But in an agreement with Brooklyn District Attorney Elizabeth Holtzman, Miss Santos dropped that argument Wednesday and pleaded guilty to the lesser charge ofharassment. ­

Christtnas tree growersin Cadillac, Michigan say they are cashing in on a bumper crop this year and business is so good that poachers are stealing a piece of the market. Commercial grower Darryl Rad said he already has buyers for all of the 400,000 trees he will harvest in the next couple of weeks and commented, "It's better than last year. There's no slack in demand." Growers say they are averaging S368 per acre of Christmas trees. But W~xford County sheriffs deputies say poachers are sneaking into fields to steal truckloads oftrees already cut and individually bundled. -AP

Charged with two counts ofgrand theft and two counts of possession ofstolen property were Steven D. Roy, 21, and Darryl L. Miller, 22, both of Fremont, and Larry G. Daugherty, of Santa Clara.

Just my imagination? 
As I remember, the day at the office had been spent in mad dashes from one last-minute responsibility to an· other. Everything had to be doneyesterday, and it had to be me who had to do it. 
And I was in a hurry to be elsewhere. The reality of 
responsibility weighed heavily on me as I scrambled to 
type the last report, complete the last phone call and 
assist one more customer. 
But at last the ordeal was over, and -my head still 
spinning (figuratively speaking, of course) -I made 
one more mad sprint, this time to my car. 
I don't remember dozing off or otherwise losing con· sciousness, but I do remember being jolted by the awareness that two other human figures occupied my car, and an eterrial ribbon of highway was disappearing in increments of haze beneath the wheels. I have a vague notion of the three of us ... but who were the other two traversing vast amounts of formless space with me? 
Out of this void, a tavern in Buffalo materialized. Friends I had h.ot seen in months (friends who are never seen outside Buffalo, which is how I know where I must have been) took shape before my eyes. 
The images are clearer here -bits of conversation float back from that smoky conference. The talk was typical. of that group, and I suppose of countless similar gatherings throughout our time: jobs were depressing, the economy was depressed, Irish football oc­cupied the press. 
One friend wanted out of his small-time newspaper job so that he could move on to the business of winning his Pulitzer Prize; another wanted out of his family's house after 27 years so that he could prove that he was grown up at last; somebody said something about wan· ting barbecued chicken wings. 
As that night faded into the next day, I recall being 
stirred gently by my mother's call to breakfast. This 
added further credence to my beliefthat I was indeed in 
Buffalo, as di.d the chicken wing bones I found in a pile 
on the table beside my bed. 
Breakfast must have been a doozy, because I had a 
vision ofNia.gara Falls, one ofthe Seven Wonders ofthe 
Neon World. I saw tourists and souvenirs and mag· 
nificent natural beauty, not to mention tons of water 
rushing stupidly over an eroding cliff. Mother was 
nearby, and so, too, were those two odd human figures 
from my car. 
Peering down into the mist beneath the ever-present Falls rainbow, t he torrent slowly transformed into the bustling newsroom of The Buffalo News. I talked to friends there, most wanting to know what I was doing now, or to tell me what they were doing now -now that the Buffalo Courier Express had folded, doubling their work. And a few of them, reminding me a bit of Death, Famine and Pestilence, wanted to know what was wrong with the Fighting Irish.

CARRYOUT DELIIIERY
THE FAMILY PIZZERIA 

I was starting to explain how things aren't always what they seem, but I found myself sitting in a Washing· ton, D.C. nightspot with my two shades, some old . friends, my sister, and a wonderful young lady my family had arranged for me to meet. 
Thinking that such arrangements only work out in dreams, I found myself more and more enchanted as time passed and most of the company faded into the background. I know the days must have changed be· cause I remember seeing missiles and planetary orbs at the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum, and trying to make sense ofthe mad spokes ofthe capital city's traffic wheel. 
Enchantment does not allow for the recognition of time's passage. 
New Jersey, however, has 
a way ofbreaking any trance, 
and I was jostled from my 
happiness by a wrong turn 
on the Garden State 
Parkway. Not wishing to be 
stranded in the Jersey 
countryside, I implored the 
two ghostly figures with me 
to direct me out of that 
Hades. 
We must have averted a 
catastrophe, because we 
were in the Meadowlands 
for the battle between a 
Catholic school and a 
military academy the next 
w afternoon. I remember 
r/fD~~JL· watching gold clash with 
~ /.....,.. gold in the gleaming sun· 
shine ofa beer-cloudy day. 
I vaguely remember thinking there was something strange about honoring a sportswriter at halftime, and then I remember reading a paper and thinking that was strange, too. The paper had one page devoted to ad· vertisements for abortion and uncontested divorce. It was horrible and I recall wanting very badly to get away. 
The two ghouls who had accompanied me were final· ly gone. Alone at last, I made a mad dash from my car to my apartment. I wanted to call a phone number that stuck in my mind to find out if any of what happened was real. 
A voice from what might have been a VISIOn answered, and I was overjoyed that my imagination had not entirely taken control. 
And yet I was frightened at the implications for my 
future and my sanity: I had returned from a world of 
glorious dreams and terrible nightmares -a world 
many of my friends casually believe is more real than 
that in which they struggle.

No solutions seen 
Officials see problem. in '84budget 
WASHINGTON (AP) -In the clear light of a post-election day, Reagan administration officials now concede the government faces a tidal wave ofred ink that could crest somewhere between S150 billion and S200 billion in fiscal 1984. 
Though loath to discuss it before Tuesday's verdict was in, these offi­cials, still requesting anonymity, ad­mit also that no solution is in sight. Budget Director David A. Stockman, limited by Reagan's insistence that only only non-defense cuts are ac­ceptable, was said to have told an aide that "I don't knot w what we are going to do." 
Stockman is perplexed, as well, by the president's refusal, at least for now, to consider higher taxes, sources say. 
But the president said, in the wake of election gains by House Democrats, that he would have to compromise with Congress, as he did last year in accepting tax in­creases and modest defense cuts forced on him by his fellow Republicans. How far he would go remained unclear. 
"We won't compromise on prin­ciples ofwhat we absolutely believe is essential to the recovery," Reagan said Wednesday. 
Treasury Secretary Donald T. Regan told reporters yesterday, "We have learned to compromise" with Democrats, but he said "I have a closed mind" to canceling next year's scheduled cut in income tax rates. 
If Reagan ·remains firm on the tax 
Loft violators warned 
By DAVID SARPHIE 
Assistant News Editor 
Notre Dame students found in 
violation ofloft-building regulations 
will have 10 days to comply with 
regulations before being fined, 
according to the Director ofStudent 
Housing. 
"We are trying to be a~ reasonable as possible in levying the tines," Father Michael Heppen said, "but the life-safety regulations must be followed." The fine for loft viola­tions is S75. 
Heppen authorized Jack Bland, Notre Dame's director of fire safety, to inspect the elevated beds in all dorms three weeks ago. Bland com­pleted the inspections over fall break. 
Bland's inspection concentrated on the rules outlined in the student guide, duLac, Heppen noted. These regulations require elevated beds to , be open on two sides, free from any fabric or drapery enclosures, and constructed away from any life­safety devices including fire. sprinklers. Also required is the in­stallation of a smoke alarm in any room containing an elevated bed. 
Heppen also reported that all stu­dents constructing elevated beds had signed forms at the beginning of the year agreeing to the "elevated bed policy" and the inspection by a University official. 
Heppen received a report ofviola­tions from Bland earlier this week but has yet to review the results. Af­ter totalling Bland's findings, he will relay names of violators to specific dorm rectors on Monday. 
Violators must make appropriate changes within 10 days from Mon-. day to avoid the S75 fine. Those not complying within that period will be fined through the Office of Student Accounts and required to remove the elevated beds. 
and defense issues, Stockman is left with the nearly ipossible task of closing the deficit gap with another foray against social and domestic programs, includingSocial Security. 
That route has its limits. Savings from changes in Social Security, the governmet's biggest domestic program, are unlikely to trim more than $10 billion to S15 billion at best from the 1984 deficit, accord­ing to administration officials. 
Even if Stockman could put a 
smaller deficit on paper relying sole­
ly on domestic cuts, the president is 
unlikely to get the budget through 
the new Congress. 
The · 97th Congress rejected 
Reagan's 1983 budget plan, which 
emphasized domestic spending 
cuts, and forced him to accept high­
er taxes and cuts in his record 
military budget in exchange for non­
defense spending eductions. Even 
with that, the red ink for fiscal 1983 
mav hit S150 billion, S39 billion 
mo~e than the record established in 
fiscal 1982, which ended a month 
ago.

and picking up 24 to 26 seats in the House. "tht> pro'<pecr nf ~nlvim• the bmlget-problem with non-defense spending cuts has worsened," one administration official said yester­day. 
Moreover, the deficit problem ex­tends beyond 1984. Without major policy changes, administration offi­cials see chronic deficits in future years, even if the economy im­
proves, because expected govern­ment revenues consistently fall short of expected government spending. 
The president has until mid­January to send Congress his budget plan. Progress has been delayed by a White House decision to postpone work on politically sensitive cuts un­til after the election. 
An unexpectedly strong economic recovery would help, be­cause expansion automatically produces higher revenues and less social-welfare spending. For each one percentage point drop in the un­employment rate, now 10. 1 percent, the deficit is narrowed by S25 bil­lion to S30 billion.

WNDUbuilding 
Social services get newcenter 
By SCOTI HARDEK 
News Staff 
The former WNDU building will be ready by january to house stu­dents involved with the Center for Experiential Learning and Volunteer Services. This is the timetable for the renovation of the former television studio building, hopes Father Don O'Neill, director of the Center for Experiential Learning. 
In the new building,both services will fall under the title ofThe Center for Social Concerns,although the in­dividual programs ofeach organiza­tion will continue as before. O'Neill hopes that interactions between 
faculty, students, and alumni 
concerning social ideas and con­
cerns can be increased and im­
proved by bringing the two very 
closely related organizations togeth­

A major asset of the new facility will be a large classroom with a capacity of I25 students which can be used for lectures and films followed by discussion in the same room or in the comfonable atmos­phere of a nearby lounge. A small kitchen will also be available to groups using the rooms.

more utilization of Saint Mary's programs. It is more reasonable to expect Notre n:~mc ~rudent~ to come for movies or lectures if they can discuss it later without return­ing to Notre Dame for a visiting place. 
Student opinion of the new parie­tals differs. Only about 10 percent \ 160-1 HO) of Saint Mary's students do nut want the change. 
((new parietals) will c.ause a lack of privacy that we'll have to adjust to.' 
Kelly Ryan was able to see both positive and negative aspects of the change. She feels that the new parie­tals are "good and necessary, but they will cause a lack of privacy that we'll have to adjust to. I feel it could promote friendships rather than the dating reltionships that exist now. However, I also feel that girls who don't want the change should have an available alternative." 
Lisa Fitt feels that it is a "definite step in the right direction. It will of­fer more freedom and an alternative to the migration to Notre Dame." 
Lisa Madlinger looks at this change from a long-range point of view. She felt that-allowing this ex­tension of parietals will inspire future allowances. "If parietals are extended to an almost 24-hour period or even to Notre Dame hours it could destroy the philosophy of a women's college." 
Other students have mentioned the lack of privacy and the inhibi­tions that will be imposed on the girls. Most students, however, anxiously await the results ofthis ex­periment.

Olaract:errsPoles 
ightfor freedom continues 
By TOM MOWLE 
News Staff 
The Poles will continue their struggle for a free society, even though it is unlikely that they will at­tain it, said Rett R. Ludwikowski, a Polish professor living in the United States, last night in his talk on the origins of the Solidarity labor union 
before  a  nearly-full  Galvin  Life  
Science Auditorium.  
Ludwikowski  cited  four  com­ 

ponents of the Polish character to support this thesis. First, he .'>aid that Poles are romantics, that they have a ··readiness to sanifice for some very important human \·alues -father­land, family. religion -even when there is no logical reason to do so." The ruling Communist Party tries to say that thb notion is a myth, even as they try to exploit that romanticism for their own goab. 
The Poles also are individuals, Ludwikowski said, who "love to speak, discuss, quarrel," and are strongly attatched to freedom ofdis­cussion. The policies ofcommunism run counter to this, as they promote one idea and permit the discussion of no others. 
"Poles," Ludwikowski said, "are left feeling that the Lack of democracy in Poland is the biggest lack in the country." He cited the history of democracy in Poland, which stretches in some form hack to the sixteenth century. In one of many anecdotes, Ludwikowski noted that the difference between WeMern democracies and Eastern "democracies" is that although some Western politicians are less competent than their Eastern couterparts, their opinions are balanced by others. Meanwhile, in the East, t\"Jc incompetent politicians are the ones making the decisions. Ludwikowski also noted that this

type of comparison quickly ended his lecturing in Poland. 
Finally, Ludwikowski said that Poles are even more strongly at­latched to Catholicism. When the Pope visited Poland in 1980, the people realized that they were united in their feelings, and this led to the forming ofSolidarity in August of that year. 
Ludwikowski said that the dissolu­tion of Solidarity proved that the government will not compn,mise. and noted, ·· hltervention i~ incon~ venic:nt for :\1oscow. hut .\losuJv, will not Lhoosc to lo~e Poland.·· 
Ludwikowski expre~sed his hehef that the gm ernment"s ";1hilit~ to manipui.Jte social attitude~ b 1oM t(Jrever. · The people haH-no con­fidenn· in am· party member~ He also ~aid that in the future, the mem~ ber~ of the Polish army will be the ones who knew the truth about Solidarity, and their reliability must he questioned. 
Ludwikowski cautioned that "the mistake of Solidarity leaders was mistaking economic impotence with military impotence." The United States must also recognize that at least in military matters, the Communists remain strong. 
Ludwikowski was disappointed in the response of the West to the im­position of martial law. saying that the American bankers hoped that their debts would be paid and did not care about the struggle of the people. He said that Americans and Poles have a common enemy in communism. 
Ludwikowski said that although he is for peace, "we must realize who is benefiting from detente." While he understands the Reagan Administration's rationale in continuing to sell grain to the Soviets while embargoing the natural gas pipeline, he says that the Soviets would be forced to spend even more money if they were forced to produce their own grain.

prruses deregulation 
ByJOHN BRESLIN 
News Staff 
The current national trend of deregulation in business was dis­cussed in a lecture last night in the Library Auditorium entitled "The Financial Service Industry and the Throes of Change" by the chairman and chiefexecutive officer ofMerrill Lynch and Co., Inc. 
Roger E. Birk, also director of the New York Stock Exchange and self described as a "rugged individualist capitalist," praised deregulation, since it promotes "great things like competition and low costs." 
Birk realizes, however, that total deregulation is an impossibility. "If you totally deregulate interest rates, the banking industry would lose 530 billion a year. Since the banks only make S20 billion a year, we would have a problem." 
The decline of American domina­tion on the international banklng scene worries Birk. Japanese banks have gained prestige internationally through intense studies of the failure~ and limitations of the American banking system. "If you don't think they (the Japanese) can compete, talk to the guys in Detroit," Birk quipped. 
Birk does not worry about the currently confused banking and securities scene, since "out ofconfu­sion com~s opportunity." He refused, however, to predict specific future economic highs and lows ever since a Chinese friend rewaled to him, " He who lives by the crystal ball soon will eat broken glass."

practice at tallying votes and reporting results. You'd think they'd have gotten it right by now. But that certainly didn't seem t9 be the case Tuesday night. 
There were some highlights, to be sure. CBS unveiled what were unquestionably the most sophisticated and informative electronic graphics ever used by a network news depart­ment. And while there was considerable flash, there was little of the often accompanying trash. 
CBS graphics showed viewers-in noun­certain terms -just what was happening, and where. The maps that elevated and changed the colors of states that voted either Republican or Democratic were -to say the least -amazing. 
But there were, by far, more lowlights over 
Criticism is something that none ofus really likes to hear. This is only natural since we feel that we are doing what is right, or best, in any given situation. It is not a comfortable feeling to have someone tell us that we are wrong or that they don't like what we are doing. 
Randy Fahs 
Friday Analysis 
Still, criticism is an essential and ines­capable part of life. As individuals we are fal­lible, yet we are required to take action, or refrain from it, on a wide variety ofissues and events. Criticism is important because it makes us think about what we are doing, but the role ofthe critic cannot be taken lightly. 
Most criticism is generated for one of two 
reasons: 
.. 
-·~ 
the curse ofthe evening. Here is just a sample: 
At 7:35, NBC cut to Ken Bodie in Rich­
mond, Virginia He was supposedly going to 
discuss that state's close Senate race with 
prominent black leaders. What viewers got 
was Bodie, sitting alone in a place called "The 
Flamingo Club." Apparently, he explained, it 
was ·too early to talk to black leaders ­
whatever that means. 
A quick check ofABC showed several black 
leaders gathered in a Washington studio. 
Didn't they know Bodie was waiting for them 
in the Flamingo Club? 
I was startled when I turned on ABC for the first time. Granted, they recently opened a multi-million dollar facility in Wa'ihington and wanted to show it off. But did it have to look like the opening sequence of"Star Wars?" The low ceilings made me feel like a giant space ship was passing just over the heads of Brinkley, Reynolds, Koppel, eta/. 
NBC went to the opposite extreme. If you watched their coverage for any length oftime, you expected to see Richard Dawson. The game-show scoreboard behind Tom Brokaw and Roger Mudd -who were sharing the same set for the first time ever, by the way ­was right out of "Family Feud." What a stark contrast to the futuristic graphics at CBS. 
And what an internal contrast as well. The 
NBC director made it a point to show off the 
fa<.·t that John Chancellor had a computer ter­
minal at his immediate disposal. If NBC is that 
technologically advanced, why did their main 
tally board look like it was salvaged from old 
Forbes Fkld? 
Be~ides graphics and poor, lonely Ken Bodie at the Flamingo Club, NBC had other problems. They brought john Deardourt~ a media con~ultant, on to talk about campaign commercials. He was full of intelligent com­ments like: "I can't comment on that, it's not my commercial." and "I've never been a fan of using trained animals in political ads." Thanks, 
John. And thank you, too, NBC. 
I fell asleep twice during ABC's coverage, despite the fact that I was trying hard to see all the control panels in the network's space­shuttle-cockpit set. Someone must have given Frank Reynolds strict instructions that emo­tional outbursts were absolutely forbidden, because he was nothing short of boring. In fact, I think he fell asleep twice himself. David Brinkley was disappointing. The man who, in 1980, explained the Reagan landslide quite simply by saying, "the people got fed up with

And Ted Koppel proved once again that he's the master of in-depth reporting. He explained the origin of the term "gerrymandering," then introduced a video tape that explained the origin of the word "gerrymandering." 
Overall, CBS provided the best coverage. 
Dan Rather was somewhat inconsistent. At 
times, he was on the edge of his seat with 
excitement -like when he reported that a 
heart-stopping race wa<> underway in the Ver­
mont Senate, hut showed a tally of 1524 votes 
to 1--lOO votes with one percent of the 
precincts reporting. Other times, like when 
he wa<> throwing the whole show over to Bill 
Moyers, Dan was laid-back, leaning way back 
in his swivel chair and crossing his legs. 
For those of us here, however, CBS may have made the largest blunder ofthe night. At about 8 p.m., the network projected Democrat Richard Bodine "a big winner" in the Indiana Congressional race. As it turned 
out, Republican John Hiler pulled off a nar­row, but expected, victory. 
Yes, CBS provided the best over-all coverage. But nobody provided good over-all coverage. 
that it is we who exhibit the critical thinking and the ability to take action which have become standards of Notre Dame's greatness and synonymous with Fr. Theodore Hes­burgh. 
One of the most cherished rights of being 
an American is the ability to speak freely. We 
must use it for the betterment of ourselves 
and all that exists. 
We need people to say that the football team's offense is boring, that parietals are an insult, that their is a lack a social space, that someday someone is going to be killed when one of O'Shaughnessy's doors swings into the hall and hits them, etc. 
In short, we need critics who question what exists, because right or wrong, it is criticism that helps to shape society and people so that they can become all that they are capable of being.

PITTSBURGH -It was five years ago ­Septt:mber 10, 1977, to be exact -that Notre Dame and Pitt last met at Pitt Stadium here. The day the Irish won on a lucky break. 
That lucky break. ofcourse, was to Panther quarterback Matt Cavanaugh's wrist, courtesy ofa Willie Fry sack. Fry, Ross Browner and Co. took it from there, pacing the Irish to a 19-9 victory in the first step up the ladder toward a national championship. 
Tomorrow, Notre Dame and Pitt resume tht:ir ht:ated rivalry for the first time since 1978. but the circumstances are, oh, so dif­ft:rt:nt. 
On the surface, it'll be just another in a nevt:r-ending series of battles between the Irish and No. 1, anotht:r chapter in the annals of ND football lort:. But for one man, there r;nay be even more at stake. 
Although his team currently stands at 5-1-1, Irish Coach Gerry Faust is at a crossroads. An upset tomorrow will propel Notrt: Dame back into tht: Top 20 and perhaps prepare them to receive a major bowl bid in two weeks. And, more importantly, a win, no matter by how much or how little, might chase away all ofthe critics that have hounded his slumping team the last few weeks. 
But a loss. especially an embarrassing one, may send the Irish reeling to anotht:r mediocre st:ason and, if you are to believe some rumors, may give Faust his walking papers. 
So that's the loalkd storyline oftomorrow's showdown. which b slated to hcgin at I :50 p.m. A record crowd of over 60,000 is ex­pected; Pitt officials were wise enough to add 4,000 temporary bleachers in each end zone, although it still wasn't nearly enough to ac­commodate the demand for tickets. 
"What we do on the football field the next four Saturdays will tell the tale of this team," says Faust. "No one will be able to judge this Notre Dame team until we see what happens the next few weeks. 
"We've got our work cut out for us. If we win three or four of these games (against Pitt. Penn State, Air Force and USC) we will have had a great season." 
Although it's been a rough three weeks for the Irish, at least they'll have some semblence of momentum going into the game. Last Satur­day in East Rutherford, N.J., quanerback Blair Kiel came out of his temporary slumber to throw for 220 yards in Notre Damt:'s 27-10 victory over a depleted Navy team -im­pressive, yes, but not nt:arly enough to bet tRe house on the Irish tomorrow. 
Remember that just two shon weeks ago, Notre Dame traveled to the Pacific Northwest and just barely tied perennial Bottom Ten favorite Oregon. Now, the Irish must go on the road to face the beM. 
After Washington's loss to Stanford last wt:ek, Pitt is the const:nsus No. 1 team in the country. But, strangely enough, Panther fans are not satisfil'd lkspite their team's 7-0 rt:cord and lofty position in tht: rankings. 
The target of the fans' wrath has been none other than supposed all-c:vt:rything quarter­back Dan Marino. who has heard t:nough boos this year to laM a lifetimt:.

The Irish Extra -Pitt 
t 
By LOUIE SOMOGYI 
Sports Writer 
Pro-scouts attending tomorrow's clash be­tween Notre Dame and Pittsburgh will find a veritable gold-mine of talent when surveying the prospects for next April's draft. 
Marino. Dawkins, Covert, and Pelusi are just some of the names on the Panther roster that are expected to go high in the early rounds of rhe draft. The Irish counter with their own ex­cellent senior group for the draft which in­dude the names Hunter, Zavagnin, Duerson and Thayer. 
Although the talents in all these senior ath­letes are immense, the two most eminent per­formers on the field tomorrow may be the two sophomore offensive tackles that start for their teams -Pittsburgh's Bill Fralic and Notre Dame's Larry Williams. 
The fact that both are starters in the of­fensive line -usually a senior dominated position -for major college teams is an astonishing feat itself. 
"First of all pass blocking in most high schools isn't taught that much because the rules are radically different there," explains Notre Dame offensive-line coachJim Higgens. "It takes a long time for all offensive lineman then to learn how·to effectively use his hands and arms in college. 
"There are also obviously the factors of strength and maturity that are needed in the line. They don't come in that strong here the first year, and they don't attain the necessary strength except after a few years of weight training and a good diet." 
The talents ofFralic and Williams, however, have never really been in doubt. 
The 6-5, 270-pound Fralic may very well be one of the most awesome forces in college football today. As a 17-year old high-school senior two years ago he was able to bench­press over 500-pounds (Twenty-four year old Larry Moriarty and 21-year old Tom Thayer bench 485 and 450 pounds respectively to hold top honors for the Irish). 
Yet, Fralic also possesses first-rate speed and agility for an offensive lineman. He has run

A Covert operation 
Pitt lineman came on fast to grab All-America honors 
PITTSBURGH -As Pitt's new offensive line 
coach, Joe Moore drooled every time he 
looked down the line. It was the spring of 
1980 and the Panthers were on the verge of 
having what many still consider their most 
talented team ever. 
Nowhere was there more talent than in Moore's line, which included future NFL start­ers Russ Grimm and Mark May. But it wasn't the men in the offensive line who attracted so much of Moore's attention that spring. It was someone in the defensive line. It was a second-string someone in the defensive line. 
Everytime Moore looked at the players op­posite hb own, he did not see starters Jerry Boyarsky, Bill Neill or Greg Meisner. He saw sophomort· Jimbo Covert. 
Joe Moore wantedJimbo Covert in his line, anJ he finally told head coach Jackie Sherrill so. 
"I said, 'what the hell, he's not playing over there. Let me look at him,"' says Moore, who now shares the titles of assistant head coach and offensive line coach under Foge Fazio. "I said to J imbo, 'Take a half hour and I'll let you know how good you'll be.' 
"After five minutes I said, 'You stay with us and you'll be an All-American.' It didn't take long." 
Hardly. Covert started at left tackle that season. By the next year, he was first-team All­American. Today, he could probably be called the best lineman in the country. 
Just don't use the word probably around joe Moore. 
"Up to this point as a senior, he's the best tackle I ever had at Pitt," says the coach who had May, the Outland Trophy winner and No. I NFL draft choice, ~t tackle two years ago. "I haven't seen anybody in the country even close to him." 
In fall camp, Moore refused to compare Covert, Pitt's prime candidate for the Outland Trophy this season, and May. "That," he said, "wouldn't be fair to Mark May." 
Moore might have reason to be slightly predjudiced in the matter. Dennis Brown does not. He's the defensive coordinator at West Virginia, one of Pitt's biggest rivals on the playing field and in the recruiting wars. After watching Covert perform against his defensive linemen in Pitt's 16-13 victory over the Mountaineers this season, Brown left duly impressed with the 6-S, 200-pound tackle. 
"He's probably the best offensive tackle we'll see all season, wthout any question," he says. "Jimbo's a good one. He's big, strong and he's got good feet. You can't ask any more of an offensive lineman. 
"When they decided to run the football. 
they went to Covert most of the time. When 
they wanted to get it done, they went toJimbo 
Covert. He's just a wonderful football player." 
He's the kind Teddy Roosevelt had in mind. 
Ifany football player can be said to walk softly 
and carry a big stick, it isJimbo Covert. "Most 
guys I know who acted tough, couldn't play 
football for a damn," says Moore. 
Covert is soft-spoken, but not quiet. He is an 
English literature major, a sensitive, intel­
ligent person who hails from the Beaver 
County town of Conway, where a secure job 
in the steel mill was once considered 
everyone's right if not their lot in life. Jimbo's 
father, his brother and both his sisters' hus­
bands worked in the steel mills of Beaver 
County. Only his father is still working.

a 4.9 40-yard dash, and had was the Pennsylva­nia high-school state runner-up in wrestling. Such abilities led him to be named the 1980 National "Male Athlete of the Year" by Dial (an award won by Hers<:he! Walker the year before), and to be cited by Parade magazine as being the top recruit for 19H I (an award bestowed to Walker in 1980 and to SMU's Eric Dickerson in 19-:r9 ). 
He proved his worthiness of the awarJ that year as he stepped right in as a starter for Pitt in his very first game -the first freshman to do ~o for the Panthers since Tony Dorsett in 19"7.3. In addition, he was brought in by the Panther defense for goal-line situations. 
"I don't think I've ever seen a freshman as good as Fralic," praised his then head-coach Jackie Sherill, "if he improves like everyone else. we may not ever see another player like that." 
Indeed, the current sophomore, who was 
an Honorable Mention All-American last year 
by the AP, has continued his improvement 
ar.d maturity so much, it has left his offensive 
coordinator,Joe Moore, in absolute awe. 
"I don't say anything to him but 'good joh,"' 
says Moore. "He's the only kid I've seen who 
can adjust in a game to things we pick out later 
in the films. Other guys just stick to what 
they're taught, no matter what." 
Notre Dame's Williams, though not quite as 
strong and naturally talented as Fralic, is a 
pretty amazing athlete in his own right. 
Like Fralic, Williams was also a consensus All-American in high school. Being named by some sources as the top-lineman in California, and being labled as a "franchise player" by Blue-Chip publications, the native from Santa Ana may actually have been second only to Fralic in regards to being the top prep· lineman in the country. 
The praises are something that Williams is 
somewhat indifferent towards. 
"My dad kept me pretty level-headed about 

all the honors l was receiving then," he 
chuckles. "He told me 'Now if you're going to 
start paying attention to all that stuff I'm going 
to beat you up."'

So far, Marino's stats have been rather mediocre -58 percent on his completions (Blair Kiel's percentage is 56, to show you how stats can be deceiving), but only 11 touchdown passes in seven games. 
His four favorite targets have been tailback 
Bryan Thomas ( 34 catches), flanker Dwight 
Collins ( 27 catches), split end Julius Dawkins 
( 19 catches) and the opposition ( 18 intercep­
tions). And therein lies the problem. 
Marino has thrown 64 career interceptions, 
41 ofwhich have come in the last season and a 
half. He has thrown four interceptions in each 
of two games this year (North Carolina and 
Illinois), and once threw five in a game as 
sophomore. 
But Marino, now a senior, has a strong arm 
and has thrown at least one touchdown pass in 
each of the last 19 games dating back to the 
1980 Gator Bowl. And, even more important­
ly, he's a winner. 
"Marino's as good as there is in the college 
ranks today," says Faust. "He's got all the 
ability in the world. Dawkins and Collins give 
them a couple of deep threats, and they've 
made great use ofThomas.

under control." 
Supreme is a good word to describe 
Marino's offensive line, flanked by bookend 
tackles jimbo Covert, a massive 279-pound 
all-American, and sophomore sensation Bill 
Fralic, who weighs only 270. 
But despite this protection that gives him 
ample _time to throw, Marino, who was 
supposed to be a shoo-in Heisman candidate 
when this season began, ranks no better than 
Outlook 
45th in the country this week in passing ef­ficiency. 
"Some people might be disappointed by Dan's statistics this season," says Pitt Coach Serafino "Foge" Fazio. ''I'm sure everyone would like to see him complete 30 passes for over 500 yards like one player (Boston Col­lege's Doug Flutie) did last weekend." 
"I wouldn't want to change anything about this season," says Marino. "We're 7-0 and moving in the right direction and that's impor­tant." 
Unlike other years, Pitt's perfect slate has come against rather formidable opposition ­North Carolina, Florida State, Illinois and West Virginia, all nationally ranked sometime this year, have fallen to the Panthers. 
So, the 564,000 question is this: Do the Irish_ have a chance tomorrow? Commom sense, and an examination of Notre Dame's perfor­mances this season, would indicate not. But considering the tradition factor. the fact that Notre Dame has beaten the No. 1 team so many times over the years, no one should count the Irish out. 
A key to Notre Dame's success tomorrow will be the taliback position, whomever is chosen to start. Senior tri-captain Phil Carter is listed as the starter. but freshman Allen Pinkett has been more impressive in practices in recent weeks. Pinkett gained 129 yards last week in his initial start against Navy and kept Carter, who had a slight thigh bruise but was more than healthy enough to play, on the bench. 
But it may all come down. in the end, to 
Notre Dame's ability to pull everything to­
gether, to block out all the outside diversions 
ofthe past two weeks, and play to their poten­
tial. 
A lucky break wouldn't hurt either.

Unlike Fralic, though, he worked out less with weights because of his versatile athletic abilities in such finesse and agile oriented sports as basketball (In which he was also named MVP for his school), and volleyball. 
Thus, when he first stepped onto the practice field at Notre Dame in the fall of 1981 at a svelte 225-pounds, it looked like he would be just another offensive lineman who would have to wait for his senior year before he would have the strength and maturity to start. 
"Something inside of me told me that if I wanted to be able to play sooner I better work real hard," says Williams. "The weight and running programs I was put on helped my !).trcngth and quickness greatly. Plus I did a lot of good eating over the summer (four square meals and snacks in-between)." 
Williams and his 6-6 frame returned at 2'5­pounds this fall, but he-was still able to retain his agility. The result was a sterling fall perfor­

When Pitt's offense was getting booed by the home tans this season, Co\'ert did not get angry. lie did wish he could introduce the jeering fans to those members of his family who are out of work. 
"Football should be fun," say~ the Freedom High School graduate. "If the fun gets away from you. there's no sense playing anymore. It ~houldn't be taken as a life or death situation. 
"I come from Beaver County, where people have three or four kids and no job. That's pressure." 
That is an attitude he shares with his roommate, Dan Marino. Even though con­sidered a leading candidate for the Outland Trophy. Covert lives in relative obscurity compared with Marino, the object of intense media pressure and many ofthe boos heard in Pitt Stadium this season. 
"Danny keeps everything in perspective," says Covert, a tlfth-year senior who was red· shirted in 1979 after shoulder surgery. "He's getting hate mail and all that. I think he takes it with a grain of salt. I think Danny knows that goes with the territory. When you're labeled a great player and a superstar. glory comes with criticism." f 
Glory for Covert would come wilh the Out­land Trophy, which is awarded to the best in­terior lineman in the country But he has other ideas about whht that word means. Glory, to Covert, mean!> Pitt going 12-0. It mean!> throwing a block to spring a teammate loose. 
"I try not to really even think about that," he says of the Outland. "There's a Jot of hype he­hind that. There's a big reputation behind that. If they vote me to win lhe Outland. it would be the greatest individual thrill ofmy life. But I just want to go 12·0.

Such an impressive performance led Head Offensive Line Coach Carl Selmer to state that Williams could potentially become one of Notre Dame's finer lineman in years to come. 
"That's pretty flattering," says Williams, "but I'm not going to stop working. People were pumping my ego in high school a lot too, but I had to face reality once I came here. I just want to keep working as hard as I can to keep improving." 
Higgens agrees with Selmer's assessment of Williams. "He has really been m~tering our system and wants to make it big very much," he says. "I think he can too. but it all depends on how much he wants t6 continue to be wil­ling to put out." 
If Williams and Fralic continue to put out

knows, and (guard) Rob Fada knows, and the rest of the linemen know. and Danny knows that l was part ofthat run. That's enough satis· faction for me." 
It's rare when his teammates aren't satisfied with the result~ of a Covert block. West Vir­ginia's Dennis Brown can attest to the quality ofhis run blocking. Statistics speak eloquently about his pass blocking. As a sophomore, Covert allowed one sack of the quarterback. Last year. he was beaten twice. This year, he's given up one sack. 
Fazio noted before the season that "he's 'the dominant force in our pa.ss protection" and Covert's performance in 1982 has strengthened the head coach's opinion about every area ofhis blocking asignments. 
"He's having an outstanding year," Fazio says. "His run blocking and pass blocking are outstanding. He's playing much more ag­gressively. He's gotten to the point where he's really driving them into the ground." 
Covert doesn't necessarily agree that he's become more aggressi\'e. Stronger, yes. 
"I think my leg strength has improved," he says. "I got into the weight room more. Alot of times after I'd drive a guy off he ball, I'd lose my footing. The improved strength has helped me keep my feet and sustain my block. I don't think I've become more aggressive. I just think my leg strength has compensated for that." 
"He is," say Moore, "stronger than most pro linemen now." ... 
By this time next year, Coyert will be one of them. He's considered a sure-fire first-round NFL draft pick. But like the Outland Trophy, a perfect season and a national championship, Covert's not ready to look down the road that , year. 
"There's an old cliche football coaches say," he says. ·'You take one game at a time. That's like life. You only take one day at a time. You don't get three wee.ks at a time."

everyday. Fortunately, she didn't come in with the idea that she was better than the others." 
"I don't think it would be right (to come in with a "star" attitude)," agrees Bauters. ''I do what I think is right, and eventually others may do it." 
Mary McLaughlin's important contributions to the team are best summed up by her actions before the Michigan State game early this year. 
The Irish were getting ready to go out on the court for their biggest game in the three years that vol­leyball has been a varsity sport here. The Spartans were a power in the Midwest and heavily favored. 
McLaughlin called her teammates together and gave them a little pep­talk. Her coaches say that her words inspired the team, giving them the confidence that they needed to win and pulling out the· desire for everyone to work for each other. Needless to say, the team pulled off a major upset. 
"She knows how to win," says An­derson. "She doesn't come from a program that is used to losing. It's good for our attitude. You have to know a lot about winning in order to win."

"Mary has come here with the at­
titude of contributing," adds 
Vanslager. "She doesn't have the at­
titude ofbeing a California star. She's 
very humble about coming from a 
powerhouse. Her winning attitude 
rubs offon the others." 
Indeed, she is used to winning. 
Her high school team won two state 
titles in the state where the best vol­
leyball is played. She was named to 
the California Federation All-League 
squad. 
"She has all the qualities ofa well­
tuned, well-coached player," says 
Anderson. "Her passing technique is 
out of this world. She came here 
more polished than anyone else be­
cause she's been playing since third 
or fourth grade in competitions." 
McLaughlin could have gone to 
just about any school in the country, 
but she chose Notre Dame even 
though it had a losing program and 
no national recognition as a good . 
volleyball school. These problems 
no longer exist. 
"Nmi:e Dame has such a great 
reputation," explains McLaughlin, 
"and the feeling that I got from it was 
~great that I knew it was the place to go." 
The Irish, ofcourse, are very hap­py that Bauters and McLaughlin decided to attt:nd the school. The confidence that they give to the other players and the great talent that they possess are major reasons for the team's emergence on the na­tional level as a force to be reckoned with.

NFLstrikereps split ; no quickend in sight 
NEW YORK (AP) -The chief negotiators for both sides in the Na­tional Football League players' strike conceded yesterday that they are still far apart in their efforts to end the 45-day-old walkout. 
For the second consecutive day the substantive issues were set aside while negotiators dealt with matters such as meal money, injury grievances and roster sizes. But both sides acknowledged that progress was slow.

"We are significantly apart," said jac\1: Donlan, the owners' chief negotiator. 
"There is a big gap between our position and theirs," said Ed Garvey, executive director of the NFL players Association. "The fundamen­tal issue still remains: the Manage­ment Council insists that we waive our right to negotiate wages. We're not going to do that. 
"The general counsel of the Na­tional Labor Relations Board says they are violating the law by insist­ing on that," Garvey added, "and therefore there is a tremendous dif­ference between our proposal and theirs. 
"Even if we reach agreement on· our figures, the average team profit would be very close to what (Commissioner) Pete Rozelle thought was fair, mainly about S3 million," Garvey said of the two sides' economic proposals. 
"That is absolutely, totally in rect, there is no money to be made by any club under the union's proposal," insisted Donlan. "As a matter of fact the clubs will lose money and we are not in business to do that." 
Donlan said the owners would reveal their financial offering for 1982, the first year oftheir proposed five-year contract, either today or tomorrow. Previously, the owners have said they are prepared to guarantee S1.313 billion for 1983­86. 
The union is seeking a three-year, 
ll1. 1-billion pact. 
Management spokesman Jim Mil­
ler, while refusing to estimate the 
differences in 1982, said yesterday 
the sides are S 1 30 million apart in 
1983 and S120 million apart in 
1984. 
Following reports of major con­
cessions by the union, Garvey was 
asked if it was prepared to make any 
more. Before he could reply, union 
president Gene Upshaw said, 
"None!"" 
Seven weekend~ of the 16-game regular season have been affected by the strike. NFL official!> say two weekends can be salvaged juggling the playoffschedule. eliminating the first wild-car<: round and the idle Sunday precedtng the Super Bowl. 
Union economist Michael Duberstein has projected that the average club will gross more than $2.5 million over the 19R2-84 -an average of I 0 percent return on revenues under the union's current proposal. 
"We arc not asking the clubs to go into hock in order to meet these demands," Garvey said. "\X'e are still saying that with the enormous television revenues that are coming in this year. they can well afford to pay more to the players and come close to sharing that money on a 50­SO basis...

' 'no useful purpose'' 
Rozelle refuses to enter talks r----------------~
I I
• 
NEW YORK (AP) -Commis­sioner Pete Rozelle said yesterday that he is receiving increasing pressure to enter the National Foot­ball League's stalemated strike negotiations but insisted it would "serve no useful purpose." 
"I have just written a letter to Burgess Owens (defensive back for the Los Angeles Raiders), one of the players who have visited me this week," Rozelle said. "He asked me to attend the negotiations as an ob­server. 
"I assured him that I would con­tinue to work with the Management Council and mediator Sam Kagel to overcome the present impasse but that, under the circumstances, my presence would be an intrusion." 
The commissioner said that 28 players, in four groups, had visited his office this week while talks were going on at the Summit Hotel four blocks away, the players all wishing to talk about their problems. 
"I listened and told them that I would pass their grievances on to the Management Council in the hope that both side~ will work toward the goal of settlement." he added. 
Not only player~ but newspaper, radio and TV critics have started beating the drum~ lor a Rozelle presence in the stalematc which al­ready has wiped out seven weekends ofgames. cost owners and plavers around ~2<; million weekly and now threatens the season. 
In sports, Rozelle has been hailed 
as the consummate league ex­
ecutive, bright. enterprising, suc­
ce~sf t ul in negotiating the most 
princelv TV contract in history, S2.1 
billion for tlve year~ . 
.The impression is that Rozelle's 
genius, it brought into play, could 
bring an immediate settkment. Such 
an idea fails to jibe with reality. 
"I talked with Ed Garvey (director 
of the NFL players Association) and 
Gene Upshaw (NFLPA president) in

Washington in September," Rozelle 
said. "I initiated the meeting. 
"Garvey said he would like to get me involved. I asked him, 'How do you mean involved?' He said as a rep­resentative of the owners -only. I told him Jack Donlan (management's chief negotiator) was speaking for the owners. 
"I don't feel I am commissioner just of the owners. When I helped negotiate that big TV contract, I wasn't doing it just for the owners. It was for the players and the whole game." 
Rozelle said, as a strong advocate of the players' rights, Garvey wouldn't accept him as an unbiased observer. 
Rozelle said his situation is largely similar to that of Bowie Kuhn, the ousted baseball commissioner who was roundly criticized for not get­ting involved in the players' strike last year when baseball parks were darkened for 59 days. 
Rozelle recalled that he had been able to exert some favorable in­fluence in labor-management situa­tions in 1970 and again in 1974 and 1975, but under vastly different cir­
cumstances.

Those nomads spend days and nights patrolling hallways, surveying lobbies, checking elevators, an ins­ulated sort ofexisrence. 
When this round of negotiations began, they were preoccupied with finding a personal, valuable, reliable source of information, someone who might reveal a mood, a nuance. 
The routine is familiar. The par­ticipants float rumors by providing deep-background information one day so they can stand in front of a lectern and denounce those same rumors. 
NEW YORK (AP)-There's a big city beyond the revolving door. For a while, you tend to forget that. 
Whether you're in Washington, D.C., or Cockeysville, Md., or mid­town Manhattan -or wherever the National Football League strike negotiations alight -you lose track of what the rest of the world is doing. 
The player representatives in at­tendance experience no such hardships. Almost since they arrived last Sunday, they've been going on field trips. 
They've visited NFL commis­sioner Pete Rozelle's opulent Park cameramen:As one wrote the names ofthe players he was photographing, he didn't recognize one of them. He asked another photographer. He didn't know, either. None of them did. 
So they asked a player. He didn't know, either. None ofthem did. 
The mystery man turn~d out to be just another big guy who got on the train. 
The print and electronic media people here have become a family of sorts. They even have given them­selves a name: the National Football League Strike Correspondents and

against Northern Michigan, I started to loosen up and had my best game." 
Tonight the Irish will try to break out of a three-game losing streak against Western Michigan. "We real­ly don't know a lot about Western Michigan," says Smith. "NCAA rules prevent hockey coaches from scout­ing opponents; as a result, we try to determine what our opposition will be like by the coach's philosophy and what players he has. 
"Western will really be an un­known quantity because they've got a new coach and we really don't know what his philosophy will be. He had training under North Dakota, the 'rock 'em-sock 'em,' and at Bowling Green, which is more finesse, so it will be hard to tell what philosophy he will develop. 
"This week we've made a lot of changes," continues Smith. "With three of the four lines changed and with our injuries at defense, we'll be on the shaky side with the injury to Tony Bonadio (shoulder separa­tion), and· Sean Regan. Hopefully Steve Ely will be ready for the game. 
John Keating and Tadd Tuomie will hopefully be ready by Monday."

The Notre Dame field hockey team was defeated by Michigan State in its last game of~he season. The Spartans edged the Irish 1-0 in a game marred by bitter cold and poor field conditions. 
Notre Dame appeared to be in control at halftime, despite the 0-0 score. The Irish controlled play for the majority of the first half ;ptd outshot M.S.U. by a large margin. However, the Spartan goalie made several excellent saves and Notre Dame was unable to get on the scoreboard. 
Michigan State's lone goal came at the five minute mark ofthe second half. The Spartans attempted a penalty shot which N.D. goclie Debbie Rohl appeared to save. However, she dropped her stick on the play, resulting in an automatic goal for State. 
The Irish never quit during the game and actually dominated throughout the entire second half. Unfortunately, they failed tCJ capitalize on 18 shots on goal.
