Right to Life marking Roe ruling with events 
By NANCY FENOCKETTI 
News Writer 
While members of the Notre Dame/ Saint Mary's College Right to Life (ND/SMC RTL) or­ganization spent the actual an­niversary of Roe vs. Wade protesting in Washington, a week later they are marking the decision to legalize abortion with a series of events aimed at South Bend and its college communities. 
Sponsored by ND/SMC RTL, Campus Ministry, the Children of Mary, and the Knights of the Immaculata, the two-day schedule focuses on the image of Our Lady of Guadalupe. Many pro-lifers have chosen this particular portrayal of Mary as a pregnant young Na­tive American woman to sym­bolize their cause, according to Bill Keen, co-president of ND/SMC RTL. 
Seen in this way, she js both, "the patroness of the unborn and the pro-life movement," Keen said. The sequence begins with a mass in the Sacred Heart Basilica tonight at 5:15p.m. 
"The special intentions will be ·offered up not only to wel­come Our Lady but also for an increase of respect for all hu­man life. It will be a joyous oc­casion even though it is com­memorating something that is not," Keen said. Following the mass, there will be veneration of the Missionary Image until 7 p.m. 
Then, at 7:30 p.m., Daniel Lynch, attorney and pro-life activist from Alburg Springs, New York, will speak on "The Missionary Image of Our Lady of Guadalupe" in the Hesburgh Library auditorium. Lynch is the national guardian of the image, a 4 by 6 foot picture of a statue of Mary.

Reich, Foley discuss layoffs, economic stimulus 
WASHINGTON (AP) -Labor Secretary Robert Reich said to­day the Clinton administration likely will seek to extend jobless benefits, saying the latest wave of corporate layoffs shows the "employment picture is still very bad." 
Reich said he was somewhat surprised by announcement of large cutbacks this week at Boeing and Sears but suggested some big companies "have used the recession to do what they should have been doing all along." 
"I don't want to second-guess the management of a particular company . . . but it seems to me cutbacks of a very large scale signal a management failure," he said during an interview on NBC's "Today" show. 
In any respect, the cutbacks are yet another indication that even though "we technically are coming out of recession, the employment picture is still very bad," Reich added. 


Reich said the administration had not yet made a final deci­sion on the details of a short­term economic stimulus pack­age, but insisted that "we are going to do whatever it takes" to create jobs. 
He said that whether it is $15 billion to $20 billion -or $20 billion to $25 billion -in new spending "it's likely there will be a stimulus package and an extension of unemployment benefits." 
House Speaker Tom Foley, meanwhile, said contemplation of a rather modest stimulus package -there once was talk of something on the order of $60 billion -is "a reaction to the fact that we have a very heavy deficit." 
"The fact that the employment picture is still not rebounding fast enough is the reason

Trains are halted near crash site after a broken cable is discovered 
GARY, Ind. (AP) -·Trains were halted this week near the bridge where seven people died in last week's commuter train crash when the signal system detected a broken cable, a railroad official said Wednesday. 
It was the 11th time in four months that the system had picked up a problem and flashed a stop light -its proper. function in such situations. 
"When it senses a problem, it goes to red," said Northern Indiana Commuter Transportation District spokesman John Parsons. "T~at's what the signal is designed to do."

News Writer 
Saint Mary's College contin­ues its election week events with a debate between the tickets Mary Beth Wilkin­son/Lynn O'Donnell and Melissa Whelan/Melissa Peters tonight. 
The debate was planned to help the students make a more informed decision in their choices for leadership in 1993­94 by giving them an opportu­nity to meet and question the candidates,. 
The format for the debate will include a two-minute opening statement by both presidential candidates, followed by a ten to fifteen question session alter­nating between the tickets, and finally an open floor for ques­tioning. 
Wilkinson and O'Donnell hope to initiate a comprehensive recycling program, further the development of Dalloway's and increase student-alumni links with lectures and interviews, they said recently. 
Whelan and Peters plan to in­crease the role of student gov­ernment in student life, im­prove intellectual and social in­teractions between faculty and the student body, and encour­age a stronger relationship between Saint Mary's, Notre Dame and Holy Cross through "movies and speakers and cul­tural events," according to their platform papers. 
The debate for the Saint Mary's College Student Body officers will be at 7 p.m. in Haggar Parlor. The election will be held on February 1, in the dining hall. 
WNDU-16 clair:ns new evidence bus driver sped 
Observer staff report 
One year after a United Limo bus accident which took the lives of two Notre Dame women swimmers, WNDU-16 claimed Wednesday night to have new evidence that the driver of the bus was speeding at upwards of 55 mph -evidence which, if true, would contradict a St. Joseph County grand jury de­cision not to prosecute him. 
During an 11 p.m. broadcast Wednesday, WNDU claimed to have obtained a copy of the of­ficial federal investigation into the accident which killed freshmen swimmers Margaret "Meghan" Beeler and Colleen

It was the same light that engineer David Riordan said he saw drop from a clear signal to stop as he neared it on the morning of Jan. 18. Seconds later the train was struck by a westbound train, killing seven passengers and injuring more than 60 others. 
Federal investigators say their work so far has uncovered no signal problems on the day of the crash. 
The "home" signal locked on red shortly after 6 p.m. Monday, telling eastbound train No. 19 to stop, Parsons said. The engineer spotted the red light about a half-mile away and was able to stop well before the sig­nal, which is 473 feet from the bridge. 
Riordan told federal in­vestigators the light changed when he was about two car lengths from it. His train

JPW gives us better view of our parents

Hearing  that  song,  in  Asst. Viewpoint  
which Chapin laments the  Editor  

difficulty of father/son ________ relationships, and hearing my friends who are ·uniors talking about and planning for the upcoming JPW events got me thinking. 
There are certain moments in our lives in which our relationships with our parents take a turn; a moment where we realize that the delicate balance between giving and taking responsibility has changed. Growing up, going to college, moving out, visiting one's parents as an adult and other 'milestones' all contain moments where our relationship with our parents is redefined. The moment could be a conversation. the opening of a gift, a special letter or anything else. 
For me, a car ride during JPW was such a moment. 
I remember all of the planning and prepara­tion for this big weekend: the worries we all had about how the weekend would go (how our parents might act in front of everyone else's parents, for example), the process of nailing down the precise schedule of events and other logistical matters. 
When the weekend arrived, these concerns faded upon recognition of the fact that JPW was not about scheduling details or "who's going to sit with whom" or "Dad, just please don't tell that story again!" 
No, JPW was and is about the most important relationships in our lives to date. Behind the surface worrins and the flurry of campus events, JPW can be a far more personal experience. It is a weekend which recognizes our parents' importance in our lives; a weekend where we ean say "Thanks, Mom and Dad, for helping us make it this far." 
For me, there was also a 'Chapin-esque' moment. On my way home Sunday, after dropping my parents off at their hotel, I realized that I had not thanked them for coming. Then, in weakness, I thought to myself, "Well, they sort of had to come, right? So it's really no big deal that I didn't thank them. right?" 
Right. Not a big deal. 

Except for the fact that no. they didn't really have to come, and that they did deserve a "Thank you." They had come all the way out here because I had wanted them to. They came to recognize me and my accomplishments, to meet my friends, and to learn more about my life here. They did not come for their own satisfaction, nor were they obligated to come, but I had just convinced myself that they had had to come. 
I realized then that it was no longer acceptable for me to just expect my parents to support me, attend events, drive me to little league, pay for piano lessons, praise my accomplishments and so forth. Not that it was ever acceptable for me to expect them to, but it was during this car ride that this point was driven home to me. 
They did indeed deserve a "thank you," and not just for attending JPW. I called the hotel when I got to my room.

Several senators asked the head of the upper house, in which Benetton has a seat, to pronounce whether the "absence of good taste is compatible with the sense of decorum and dignity" of an elected representative.

Clinton: Policy on gays will include code of conduct on sexual behavior 
WASHINGTON (AP) -Presi­dent Clinton, intent on revers­ing the military's ban on homo­sexuals despite intense opposi­tion, will include in his policy a "strict code of conduct" gov­erning sexual behavior of all troops, the White House said today. 
As opponents of Clinton's pol­icy lit up switchboards at the White House and on Capitol Hill, the administration geared up its lobbying effort, sending Defense Secretary Les Aspin to lobby members of Congress. Clinton himself called one pow­erful opponent, Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn of Georgia. 
In a speech on the Senate floor this afternoon, Nunn reit­erated the need for extensive hearings on the issue and his opposition to lifting the ban, but did not repeat his previous criticisms of Clinton's handling of the issue. 
"It's in everyone's interest to see if we can resolve this issue through consensus rather than confrontation," Nunn said. "There's always time for con­frontation later if it cannot be solved by consensus, but per­haps it can." 
Nunn remained steadfast in his belief that any change in

the policy is the shared re­sponsibility of the executive branch and Congress. He pre­sented a series of provocative questions that must be an­swered before any action is taken, including whether sepa­rate living quarters or any changes in law on sodomy would be needed. 
"I urge that the White House, the president and all his advisers, including the secre­tary of defense, think through these questions very carefully before they take any kind of action that could be perceived as final," he said. 
"It's not simply the right of homosexuals at stake. It's also the right of all those men and women who serve in the mili­tary."

Clinton spokesman George Stephanopoulos said Clinton planned to detail his policy Thursday. The announcement had been scheduled today, but Clinton wanted at least one more day to lobby and consult lawmakers. 
The president refused to an­swer reporters' questions on issue of gays in the military at a picture-taking session with members of Congress, insisting that the meeting was to focus solely on the economy. 
Asked if the controversy was distracting him from being able to develop his economic pro­gram, Clinton snapped: "No, it's distracting you. It's not dis­tracting me." 
Democrats on the Senate Armed Services Committee were meeting with Clinton at the White House this evening. Aspin held a breakfast meeting with top members of the con­gressional military and defense appropriations committees. 
The spokesman acknowledged the White House was receiving "a fair amount" of phone calls opposing Clinton's position, but said the new president was undaunted by the outcry.

Tax increase may be needed to cut deficit 
WASHINGTON (AP) ­President Clinton said today he's unsure he can meet his goal of cutting the deficit by $145 billion without raising taxes, but should have an answer when he outlines his plan to Congress next month. 
"I've not made any deci· sions yet" on whether to in­clude a tax on energy con­sumption as part of the plan. Clinton said. Such a tax had been mentioned as a strong possibility by Treasury Sec­retary Uoyd Bentsen. 
"I'm going to give a speech to the joint session Feb. 17 and I'm going to lay out my program then," Clinton said at a picture-taking session as .he met with chairmen of congressional budget, appropriations and tax­writing committees. 
"This is the first opportunity l've had to meet with the eco­nomic leadership. of the Congress," Clinton said at the beginning of the Oval Office meeting. 
Asked if he could meet a goal of cutting the deficit in four years by $145 billion without increasing taxes, Clinton said: "I don't know the answer to that. We're working on it." 
During the campaign, Clin­ton vowed to cut the deficit in half in four years. But since he made that pledge last winter, the deficit increased to an estimated record $327 
billion., Clinton earlier this month 
Family leave law seems on fast track toward approval 
WASHINGTON (AP) -Fam­ily leave legislation moved for­ward on its fast track Wednes­day as Democrats on the House Labor Committee beat back more than a dozen attempts by the GOP to amend it. 
The panel approved the bill, 29-13, after a lengthy debate in which Republicans repeatedly offered proposed changes, only to have them all rejected on mostly party line votes. 
Republicans complained that Democrats were steamrolling over discussion about reason­able changes to the bill, which would give workers up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave to care for a newborn or a sick rela­tive. Companies with less than 50 workers would be exempt. 
"The Clinton administration said it wants to work together -that process was not evident

modified the promise, saying he didn't expect he could halve the deficit but still hoped to be able to trim itby about $145 billion-roughly half of what the deficit was last January. 
The president was asked if the controversy over his plan to lift the ban on homo­sexuals in the military was distracting him from focusing on the economy. "No, it's distracting you. It's not distracting me," he said. 
Earlier, White House spokesman George Stephanopoulos said that Clinton was working on the economic plan "every day" and some advisers were "working around the clock" to get it ready for Clinton's Feb. 17th speech to a joint session ofCongress. 
Clinton's decision to push his proposal to lift the ban on homosexuals in the military before submitting his eco­nomic plan does not signal lack of engagement on the economic measure, Stephanopoulos 'said. 
"He will continue to work on it, and we'll have a solid announcement on the 17th,,. Stephanopoulos said. "The president is going about the business at hand with the economy.... We're committed to passing a strong economic package." 
Stephanopoulos said Clinton anticipates "a spring filled with action on the economy and health care." 
in this hearing," Rep. Randy "Duke" Cunningham, R-Calif., said after the hearing. 
The GOP amendments ranged from one tightening language about the circum­stances under which aworker could take unpaid time off to one giving businesses more time to comply. Democrats said the changes weren't needed. 
Rep. William Ford, D-Mich., scolded Republicans when they asked for roll call votes rather than letting them go down by voice vote. 
"We've got to finish this bill today. You may not like it but I'll be here with Democrats if that's all we have left at mid­night. This bill's going forward -today," Ford said. 
House Speaker Thomas Fo­ley, D-Wash., plans to put the bill on the House floor at the middle of next week. 
A similar Senate version is likely to come up later this week or early next week, although some Republicans in that chamber have threatened to sidetrack it with an amend-· ment on gays in the military. 
''I'm hopeful that the head­line grabbers don't try to get in the spotlight by using this bill," said Rep. Pat Williams, D­Mont., as Democrats cried foul over the rumored GOP revolt. 
Democratic supporters of the family leave bill and President Clinton want it passed quickly to prove that things can get done in Washington now that one party controls both the White House and Congress.

LA tense as second trial of police nears 
LOS ANGELES (AP) -Police want to buy more riot gear, the mayor plans to send peace­makers door to door, and peo­ple in South Central are warn­ing of trouble as the federal trial of four policemen in the Rodney King beating draws near. 
"Anybody who tells you what is going to happen is simply guessing," said Deputy Mayor Mark Fabiani. "The mood is very tense. We're preparing for the worst, but hoping for the best." 
Jury selection begins Wednesday in the trial of four white officers who were cap­tured on videotape beating King, a black motorist, after a car chase in 1991. 
The officers were acquitted of assault in state court in April, touching off three days of riots in mostly black South Central Los Angeles. The violence left 53 people dead and 10,000 businesses destroyed. Damage was put at $1 billion. 
The riots produced another videotaped beating and another trial with explosive implica­tions: News helicopters cap­tured the beating of Reginald Denny, a white truck driver who was dragged from his rig by a mob in the opening mo­ments of the riots. 
Four black men have been charged in the attack. The trial of three of the men starts March 15 and could overlap the King case. 
"There is great fear about the outcome of these trials," Fabiani said. "People in the African-American community are fearful that justice may again be denied, especially in the federal trial." 
Mayor Bradley is organizing a "Neighbor-to-N ei ghb or" program, in which hundreds of volunteers will visit housing projects, schools and shopping centers to urge calm during the trials. Volunteers are being re­cruited. 
The Police Commission, at the request Police Chief Willie Williams, voted last week to ask the City Council for $1 million to spend on riot equipment, in­cluding rubber bullets, tear-gas bombs and police vans. The request is pending. 
Williams, a soft-spoken black man and police reformer, suc­ceeded Daryl Gates, who was forced out over the King con­troversy. 
This week, people near the intersection of Florence and Normandie avenues -where Denny was attacked -said there could be more violence. 
"People are saying they want justice. If there's no justice this time, there won't be no peace," said Lee Haylock, standing in his employer's auto parts store.

Tampa man opens fire in office cafe; kills 3, wounds 2 before killing himself 
TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -A man wearing a business suit .r:eport­edly shouted "This is what you all get for firing me!" and opened fire in an office building cafe during lunchtime Wednesday, killing thr-ee people and wounding two. The man later was found dead in a nearby park, an apparent sui­cide. 
The gunman, Paul Calden, 33, was a former employee of Fireman's Fund Insurance Co.'s local office, said Steve Cole, spokesman for the Tampa Police Department. "It was not a matter of him going into the cafeteria and just 
spraying in every direction," Cole said. "It appears he tar­geted people at one or two ta­hies, people he may have known, people he may have worked with." 
A Firemen's Fund spokesman wouldn't say whether the victims were employees. 
Police initially believed Calden might still be in the 12-story building after the shootings, and they made a room-by-room sweep as workers stayed inside their offices. But hours later 
Calden was found dead in a rental car in a park in nearby Clearwater. Police said he apparently shot himself. 
Abraham Reid, whose wife was in the cafeteria when the shooting broke out, said she called him afterward and quoted the gunman as saying: "This is what you all get for fir­ing me!" 
Later, Sarah Reid, 33, said the man was an arm's length away from her when the shooting started in the Island Center office building's first-floor cafe. 
"It's totally unbelievable. I just thank God he spared my life," she said. She said he "just shot all these people around this one table. 
"It sounded like a firecracker and I thought it was a joke. I just looked up and all of a sud­den I saw the man just shoot­ing. Then everybody started screaming and we all just got up and knocked over the table and tried to run.'' 
The cafeteria, a 20-table lunch spot, had some 25 diners during the lunchtime shooting.

agents were snared in a U.S. Customs sting aimed at uncov­ering lawmen who allegedly ripped off drug dealers and laundered the money, authori­ties said Wednesday. 
It was believed to be the largest number of federal agents ever arrested at one time, said Leonard Freedman, regional internal affairs direc­tor for Customs. 
One FBI and three Customs agents were charged with stealing and laundering $200,000, he said. 
"We're not going to tolerate any of these characters working in law enforcement," Freedman said. "These are anom~es who stole and laundered money.'' 
He said it was possible more 
charges could be expanded after search warrants were served. 
One Customs agent in Miami, Orlando White, 42, was the original target of the 18-month investigation, Freedman said. 
Customs internal affairs had received information White was "dirty," said Freedman, who refused to elaborate. 
Freedman said the investi­gation of White led to the other agents -the FBI's Louis Reveiz, 27, brother of NFL place kicker Fuad Reveiz of the Minnesota Vikings, and Cus­toms agents Alcides Licona, 4 7, of Miami, and Ricardo Laurel, 3 7, of Houston.

The four agents have been charged with theft of govern­ment property and money laundering so far, said Freed­man. 
The sting began in August 1991 when White was ap­proached by a Customs infor­mant with a plan to rip off $80,000 to $100,000 from a fictitious "black guy-career criminal," according to a fed-era! affidavit. 
White was reluctant, at first, but eventually went to the hotel room of the supposed trafficker and stole $82,000 agents had planted there, the affidavit said. Unknown to him, Customs videotaped the burglary. White allegedly kept $30,000 of the cash, said the affidavit.

Freighter carrying fuel stops its perilous drift 
WILMINGTON, N.C. (AP) ­The crew of a storm-tossed freighter with nearly 400,000 gallons of fuel lowered its an­chors today, apparently stop­ping its perilous, daylong drift toward the shoals, the Coast Guard said. 
The 600-foot Lyra broke loose from a tug offshore Tuesday morning as the container ship was being towed from Baltimore to New Orleans. No crew members were aboard for the trip. 
A Marine helicopter dropped captain Debbie Dempsey, her chief mate and two engineers onto the deck in 20-foot seas in mid-afternoon. 
They were unable to get generators working to drop the anchors and instead manually lowered them around 12:30 a.m., Coast Guard Lt. Cmdr. Larry Hammond said. 
"The anchors are holding," he said. "We'll wait until daylight and as seas diminish, they're going to try to put a tow line on it." 
The ship had drifted south­west about 13 miles to within 17 miles of Frying Pan Shoals, an area of shallow water off Cape Fear, the Coast Guard said. 
The wind was blowing south at 40 to 50 mph, and oil-spill teams were sent in from New Jersey and Alabama for a "worst-case scenari9, like it goes aground and all the oil spills out," said Coast Guard Petty Officer Wayne Weeks. 
The ship had no cargo but about 380,000 gallons of fuel, most of it heavy oil, the Coast Guard said. 
The vessel's owners, Lykes Unes of New Orleans, "are very, very optimistic" that a wreck can be averted, spokesman Ardley Hanemann said. 

Bacteria in· hamburger sicken scores, kill one 
SEATTLE (AP) -It's one of the worst nightmares a parent can have. 
Deadly bacteria infiltrates hamburger. Undercooking at a popular fast-food chain fails to kill the bacteria. Scores of people get sick and one child dies. 
Thousands of others wait with dread through an incu­bation period as long as a week and a half after con­sumption to see if they will develop the disease. For most, that period ended only Wednesday. 
The illness is called hemolytic uremic syndrome. It was traced to Jack in the Box outlets in Washington, Idaho, Nevada and possibly California. It has produced symptoms ranging from bloody diarrhea and intense abdominal pain to stroke-like bleeding in the brain and irreversible damage to intestines and kidneys. 
"To think that something like this can come from hamburger meat," said Dean Forbes of Children's Hospital, where most of the most severely ill youngsters have been treated. "It's a nightmare for the parents." 
As many as 40,000 burgers were sold from potentially contaminated shipments, company and health officials said. 
As of Wednesday, Forbes said, 18 patients in the hos­pital were being treated for infection by the coliform bac­teria E. coli 0157:H7, including 10 on kidney dialysis and one in critical condition. That is just one strain of the common 
E. coli bacteria. 
Aundrea Dolan, 2 1/2, re­gained her health fairly quickly. Her sister, Mary, almost 4, recovered from a stroke and returned home Friday. 
En route to a follow-up blood test, Aundrea saw a Jack in the Box and wanted to stop, recalled her father, Joseph Dolan of Kent.

Former colleagues predict Hillary Clinton will be 'idealistic,' 'pragmatic' in new post 
LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) ­Hillary Rodham Clinton will be "idealistic and pragmatic" as she heads a presidential task force tackling the health care system, say those who recall her tenure as Arkansas' top education reformer. 
In that post a decade ago, they say, she did not "pull rank" as Gov. Bill Clinton's wife­appointee but won consensus on sweeping changes that forced the hiring of thousands of new teachers and the merging of dozens of districts. 
Teacher competency tests and a tax increase accompanied the reforms. 
"She listened, she analyzed, she was extremely effective," said Walter Turnbow, who served on the Arkansas Educa­tion Standards Com.mittee, which Mrs. Clinton chaired in 1983. 
"The standards for Arkansas public schools were the lowest or among the lowest," recalled another committee member, Cora McHenry, who credited Mrs. Clinton with bringing order out of the chaos of com­peting reform ideas. "Since 1983, it's really an amazing change." 
"She was a tireless worker," added Don Roberts, then head of the state Education Depart­ment and now superintendent

Croatian clashes frustrate mediators 
SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herze­govina (AP) -Serbs unleashed their heaviest artillery bom­bardment of Sarajevo in weeks Wednesday as fighting also raged in neighboring Croatia, jeopardizing peace efforts for the whole region. 
The clashes across Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina have frustrated peace mediators and increased concerns that ethnic warfare would spread deeper into the Balkans. A U.N. state­ment hinted that peacekeepers could be withdrawn from Croa­tia if the battles persist. 
More than 27,000 people have been killed in the two former republics since fighting broke out in June 1991. A year­long truce was broken last week in Croatia. 
In the Bosnian capital, radio stations appealed for people to stay off the streets. But by sun­down, hospital and morgue of­ficials reported at least 17 peo­ple, including two children, had died and 77 were wounded. 
Three of the victims were killed when a 120mm mortar shell slammed into a crowd waiting for a bus on Sarajevo's main east-west road. 
Heavy fighting also was re­ported around the besieged city's western suburbs and the airport as the U.N. High Com­missioner for Refugees, Sadako Ogata, made a one-day visit. 
Ogata accused Croat militias in central Bosnia of blocking relief convoys, endangering hundreds of thousands of peo­ple dependent on aid. She said the renewed fighting in Croatia was unleashing a new wave of refugees. 
Ethnic Serb militias in Croatia counterattacked in an attempt to dent Croatian military gains close to the Serbs' nerve center, Knin. Croatian forces had launched attacks on Friday, endangering a year-old U.N. peace agreement that ended Croatia's civil war in which 10,000 people died.

Yugoslavian farmers violate U.N. sanctions 
BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -Farmers in Yugoslavia's eastern regions have abandoned their fields to join a small army of smugglers who are violating a U.N. embargo with panache. 
A flotilla of six barges car­rying crude oil from the Ukraine reached Yugoslav waters late Tuesday after its captain told Romanian and Bulgarian port authorities he would blow up the cargo if they stopped him. 
The U.N. sanctions were imposed last May to punish Belgrade leaders -particu­larly Slobodan Milosevic, the hard-line president of Serbia -for inciting the war in neighboring Bosnia-Herze­govina. 
Western expectations that the sanctions would bring Yugoslavia to its knees have gone unfulfilled, in part be­cause the effects have been hidden by reams of newly printed money and govern­ment, bans on firing workers. 
Those policies could eventually yield economic collapse -and Milosevic's downfall. 
But in the short term, his political standing has grown amid the anger and frustration of many Serbs who feel they are unfairly treated by the West. His popular image has been enhanced by the relative ineffectiveness of the embargo. 
"How can you feel anything but disdain for the embargo after a stunt like that?~' said one Belgrade smuggler, who identified himself only as Prle, referring to Tuesday's incident. 
International inspectors "are a bother, but they leave the borders unattended every night to get their eight hours of beauty sleep, and each weekend they go off for their well-deserved rest," he added. 
"Who Killed Donald Duck?" screamed the headlines in Belgrade newspapers, which at the same time accused the United States of "cultural imperialism." 
Deported Palestinians offered phones on eve of court ruling 

JERUSALEM (AP) -On the eve of a critical supreme court ruling, Israel offered Wednes­day to give the deported Pales­tinians in Lebanon cellular telephones so they can consult their lawyers on their appeals.

process was not compromised by the expulsions. 
The seven-justice supreme court panel is expected to rule Thursday on the legality of the deportations, the Justice Min­istry said. 
A key question before the court is the hurried way in which 415 men were expelled Dec. 17 from the occupied terri­tories. Civil rights attorneys have argued that the deportees were denied their right to due process because they were not given a chance to appeal. 
If the court rules against the deportations, the government appears to have no choice but to repatriate the Palestinians from their tent camp in Le­banon, effectively ending the crisis and heading off possible 
U.N. penalties. 

Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin told Israel television "the government will carry out Supreme Court decisions." 
Israeli newspapers have re­ported that some Cabinet min­isters, dismayed at the way the affair has boomeranged against Israel in world opinion, are hoping the court will rule the deportations were illegal, thus giving Israel a face-saving way out. 
U.S. envoy: 

U.N. too slow taking control in Somalia 
MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP)­
U.S. special envoy Robert Oakley accused the United Na­tions on Wednesday of "dragging its feet" on taking over military command in So­malia from the United States. 
He said the United States and other nations were pressing 
U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali to name a re­spected independent mediator to help Somalia's warring fac­tions on the road to peace. 
"There's a quiet, collective push to get Mr. Boutros-Ghali to do for Somalia what he seems to be comfortable with in Bosnia," said Oakley. 
Boutros-Ghali appointed former U.S. Secretary of State Cyrus Vance last August to seek a negotiated settlement to the war in Bosnia. Vance is work­ing alongside Lord Owen, a former British foreign secre­tary who is the European Community mediator. 
"It doesn't have to be Vance and Owen, but someone of in­dependent stature," Oakley said in an interview. "It would make the United Nations a lot stronger ... and it would fit very nicely with the idea of having a military commander flying the 
U.N. flag." 

The United Nations has had two special envoys to Somalia, a post currently held by Ismat Kittani, an Iraqi. It was not clear whether Oakley meant to imply criticism of Kittani. 
Oakley, a former U.S. am­bassador to Somalia, was brought out of retirement by former President Bush to help oversee operation Restore Hope, launched to feed Soma­lia's starving. 
Many relief officials also be­lieve a commanding interna­tional figure is crucial to bring­ing a lasting peace to Somalia. An independent mediator would also help allay fears among many Somalis of an­other U.N. takeover of their country, which was a U.N. trusteeship from 1950 to 1960. 
"I am all for it because I be­lieve it's too big a job for the quality of U.N. personnel that are here," said Mike McDon­agh, field director for the Irish relief agency Concern.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Student disappointed by drama class 
Dear Editor: 
I recently completed a class entitled "Modern Drama," and while the professor who taught this class gave excellent and invigorating lectures, my dis­appointment was so great I feel compelled to address the editor. 
This disappointment started the first day of class upon pe­rusal of the syllabus, for while the class's title appears to be relatively straightforward there was a large disparity between the expected and the actual subject matter. The class's material consisted of twenty­seven plays all written by white males. I'd like to suggest that any class that calls itself "Modern Drama" and doesn't include a single play by a woman or minority is based on an oxymoronic premise. 
For most of recorded history, knowledge of literature written by white males has been con­sidered the only knowledge worth having. Things written by any other group have been ignored, devalued, and pushed into the realm of the unaccept­able, partly because these works were produced from a cultural framework that the intellectuals didn't understand and hence found devoid of meaning, and partly because· the meaning of oppression was all too clear and so was sup­pressed by the dominant cul­ture. 
This ceased to be true in the 1960s which issued in the sec­ond wave of feminism and al­lowed for the writings of women and different ethnic groups to be read and appreci­ated. 
The traditional white male canon began to be restructured according to society's changing awareness. This task of re­structuring the canon, says philosopher Elizabeth Minnich, "is comparable to Copernicus shattering our geo-centricity and the change is as funda­mental, as dangerous, and as exciting." 
Mary Ellen Capeck of the Na­tional Council for Research on Women calls it "one of the most significant revolutions that has taken place in the history of knowledge over the last couple of hundred years." Strangely, this revolution seems to have passed right by many of my classes at this University. 
I am aware, in lodging this complaint, that many of the classes I have taken are survey classes, and as such presuppose the need for exclusions. No class can be a complete and full analysis of modern drama or anything else. 
Further, I do in no way wish to suggest that all of the mem­bers of the traditional canon usually studied be abandoned in favor of a curriculum that in­cludes no white males whatso­ever, or that white males should be ignored as "punishment" for centuries of dominance. 
The crux of my argument is more· modest; I merely would like to point out that of the many classes at this University that make a pretense of making a "representative survey" of literature, history, art, or anything else, the fact that 53 percent of the population is consistently not represented speaks of a gross neglect. It must be ameliorated. 
Professors ·at such a presti­gious University must, I am sure, be aware of the afore­mentioned revolution that has rediscovered and legitimized the work of women and minori­ties. The Gender Studies Con­centration might suggest to a modern drama class the inclu­sion of Susan Glaspell or African American Mary Burrill. 
The challenge goes out to professors to rediscover the lost history of their fields and incorporate it in their class ma­terial. This task is arduous and perhaps underappreciated by the University, but without ac­cepting this challenge profes­sors are failing their responsi­bility to their students and en­gendering a false sense of his­tory. 
Daily Notre Dame influences the mind's of its students in a myriad of subtle ways. It is time for the professors from the "old school" to reassess what kind of influence they are having. Only then can classes like "Modern Drama" hope to live up to their names.

'Hillary' headline shows subtle sexism 
Dear Editor: 
I found Tuesday's Observer (Jan. 26, 1993) guilty of subtle sexism. 
A headline called Mrs. Clinton by only her first name (page 5, "Hillary in charge of health care"). The Associated Press text which followed addressed the first lady as "Hillary Rod­ham Clinton" and "Mrs. Clin­ton." The Observer headline editor should have done the same. 
Other news headlines in that issue which mention a person by name use surnames: "Brokaw to speak ... Clinton tells military ... Packwood ... " It was "Brokaw, Clinton," and "Packwood," not "Tom, Bill," or "Bobby P." But Mrs. Clinton got, simply, "Hillary." 
I assume the oversight was unintentional. Nevertheless, it is sexist to speak of a man by his title or surname but speak of a woman -even though we know who this woman is -by only her first name. (The pop star Madonna is an exception, of course.) 
The point is subtle. Sexism usually is. Please be more careful.

Neighborhood Council thanks Grace Hall 
Dear Editor: 
It is with thankful hearts that we publicly acknowledge the generous gift of over $1,500 which members of Grace Hall have contributed to us from their Annual Run. They have fulfilled this project for the past several years and we are most grateful. 
The contribution comes at a time when the need seems to be the greatest and the pocket is emptying at a more rapid rate. 
Thanks, too, to all the stu­dents of Saint Mary's and Notre Dame who give of their time and talents to our school chil­dren in the Neighborhood Help Study Program. We are sure we speak for the children as well as for the Council when we send all involved a big THANK YOU!!

How can I consider those topics When I can't even deal with My own existence or the end of yours? You were an incredible woman, full of goodness And we should celebrate your life Instead we mourn that you are gone 
But gone where, to a better place? Full of white robed angels, singing praise to God? Or just into the earth, lying in a wooden box Next to your beloved husband

American Edition 
Notre Dame professor enhances classroom lectures with self-edited books 

By BEVIN KOVALIK 
Accent Writer 

What could be more benefidal than a professor who supplements some of his dass lectures with books he has edited himself'? Thomas Schlereth, a Notre Dame Ameriean studies profossor has reeently co-edited a volunHl entitled, "American II cline Life, 1880-1 930," which he eompleted in Dec. 1992. 
This volume, published by the University of Tennessee Press, examines the struetural evolution of the Ameriean home and the way in whieh these transformations affected the behaviors of the people in the changing times surrounding the turn of tlw twentieth century, Schlereth said. 
For example, one seetion of the book describes how "electric eircuits and indoor plumbing along with the expansion of the parlor into the living room, as we TheObserver/SeanFarnan presently refer to it, Notre Dame American Studies professor Thomas Schlereth recently co-edited a volume entitled,'American 
altered American Home Life, 1880-1930,' which he uses in his class. 
domestic life," said Sch~er_eth. . . . . 
His mvolvement m editmg this volume snowballed back in 1988 after Schlereth lectured at a conference on the "Residence of t~e A.mcrican Home" SJ;lonsc~red by MeFaddm-vyard House, a histone house museum m Beaumont, Texas. "When The University of Tennessee Press saw the program, they asked if f would help evolve my lectures into a book," he said. 
From his confer~~ce _lecture on.the emergence of electnc1ty m. the Amencan home sprung an opportumty to ereate a book. According to Schlereth, after the contacts from tho publishing company were made, the rest was smooth sailing. "The process eonsisted of following up with Tennessee Press and then turning the authors' lectures into chapters of a book," he said. 
Years of practice have made Schlereth a pro in compiling and editing books because "American Home Life" stemmed from another volume entitled "Victorian America, "which he edited in 1985 as part of a series for Harper and Row. 
A worthwhile hobby like this one allows Sehlereth to transfer his knowledge of the changing Ameriean eulture to the elassroom. He uses both volumes to enhance his class lectures for Ameriean Studies 250, "American Thought and Culture." The class explores and historically analyzes the transformations in everyday life from 1870-1920, Schlereth said. 
"My !American studies] class explores a spectrum of human experiences common in the everyday life of the working middle-class people living at the turn of the twentieth century," Schlon")th added. 
Perhaps on a roll or maybe just doing what he considers an enjoyable task which eomplements his teaehing at ND. Sehlereth already has plans undorway for yet another new book. "I will most likely call it, 'The High Art of Common Life,"' he shared, "beeause it will analyze paintings of everyday experiences and discuss understanding Ameriean culture through paintings." 
"f am interested in exploring the reasons why artists are interested in depieting men and women in shops and the workplace during the 19th and 20th century," he said. 
Schlereth is certainly keeping himself occupied these days, but "I am doing what I enjoy doing," he added. 




Art for artists' sake 
Art professors display work at 

Faculty Art Show 
By CHRIS HATTY 
Accent Writer 
Imagine a work of art that allows its viewer to more than simply look at it. Imagine a creation that can be Pxperienced with the full range of the human senses. The Annual Faculty Art Show, starting at the end of this week, will heighten the senses and bring art to life. 
The Environmental Wall, created by William Gorlaski and Ann Marie Conrado, is a featured piece. This work consists of eight thematic tiles that are meant to represent functional aspects of nature. These aspects are light, heat, coolness, odor, humidity, purification, and sound. 
The show features the recent works of various faculty members. Some of the works exhibited in the show will be, stereo photography by Dick Stevens, work in fabric by Barbara Peterson, and digital prints created by John Sherman. 
The show will also feature the work of some of the newer Sally Brogden has an exhibit featuring her work with clay, and the cold-rolled steel and bronze sculpture of Jeffery Adams will also be on display. 

In addition to these newcomers, the Faculty Art Show will feature the work of two professors who have returned from leaves of absence. An exhibit in charcoal by James Flanigan, C.S.C. will be displayed and four oil paintings on canvas by Douglas Kinsey will be shown as well. Other faculty artists whose work will be shown inelude Catherine Poole, Kevin Fermi, Richard Gray, Austin Collins, Jean A. Dibble, and Paul Down. 
According to Lucille Brodie, staff executive at the Snite, the Faculty Art Show is a tradition that began 26 years ago. William Kremer, chairman of the Art Department, states that, "the faculty exhibition will be the focal point for a departmental symposium that will show individual artists, art historians, and designers an opportunity to talk about their current work and special interests." 
in various mediums sueh as drawing, painting, design, printmaking, sculpture, photography, and fiber. The art show allows "the Notre Dame art students and eommunity an opportunity to view the latest work of Notre Dame faculty artists and designers." states Kremer. 
The annual shows, Kremer says, allow the faculty to see the current work of their colleagues. In addition, they provide a chance for long-time aficionados of the Snite Gallery to see how the talent of Notre Dame's faculty is eurrently manifesting itsnlf. 
The Faeulty Art Show will be on display from January 31 to April 4 in the O'Shaughnessy Galleries, West. While classes are in session, the Snite Museum is open from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Tuesday through Saturday; Sunday from 1 p.m. until 4 p.m.; and Thursday from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. Admission is free, and the public is encouraged to see, as Brodie says, "the range, diversity, and vitality of faculty artists' 

faculty in the art department. The show will display works ereativity."

Ayear in revue 
Keenan Revue offers ahumorous look at the past year's events 
By MATT FOLEY 
Accent Writer 
It's late January on the Notre Dame campus, and that brings about the yearly sighting of the Keenan Revue. So put away your books, quit complaining about South Bend weather, and catch the spirit by seeing the show. 
If you are in the mood to laugh and laugh heartily (not to mPntion being lucky enough to get trckets), head on over to Saint Mary's O'Laughlin Auditorium and enjoy. 
Since this is a review of the Revue, here are some highlights of the show. The performance kicks off with an upbeat Elvis rendition and never slows down. Before the close of the first half, the Keenan players satirize everything from the unbelievable Dining Hall Security to our own Infirmary. 
In one scene. two announcers call a game between the stars of the Old and New Testament. One of the most memorable lines from this skit is: "Mary nails Jesus on a crossing pattern." 
For the sake of fairness to the masses of the unfortunate who will miss this piece of campus entertainment, a description of one skit will be denoted. 
We all remember the movie shot on campus last semester . -you know. the one with the security guards that would

Accent Writer 
What do you say to someone who has just told you that "''m going to be dead soon?" 
This is but one of the problems facing the characters in "Eastern Standard," the most recent production by the Lewis Hall Players. 
The speaker of the line above is Peter Kidde (Gregg Winkiel), who is informing his sister Phoebe (Stephenie Calmeyn) that he is dying of AIDS. which he has contracted through promiscuous homosexual sex. 
Phoebe has problems of her own, torn between her sleazy, manipulative ex-boyfriend and Stephen Wheeler (Scott Haugh), the insecure, dissatisfied architect whom she also loves. Then there is Stephen's artist friend Drew Paley (Charles Clarke). who is hopelessly in love with Peter. 
All of these troubled characters meet when they are verbally assaulted by a homeless woman, May Logan (Sonia Miller), in the restaurant where they are dining. 
For the next two hours we see these characters, along 
with Ellen (Alison McGarry), the waitress in the restaurant, come together as they attempt to resolve their problems. 
"Eastern Standard" is a contemporary comedy by Richard Greenberg, first performed on Broadway in 1988. It is the third play performed.by the Lewis Hall Players in as many years. 
As with the Players' two previous productions, all proceeds from "Eastern Standard" will go to charity. This year, the Players have chosen to give the money to an AIDS awareness and education project sponsored by the Saint Joseph County Health Center. 
Valerie Soledad, the Lewis Hall sophomore producer of "Eastern Standard," explains why the Players chose this charity. She states, "The play covers a lot of contemporary issues, notably AIDS ...we thought we'd stick with the themes of the play." 
Rehearsals for the play began after the October break. Until the Christmas break, the Players practiced five days a week for two hours a day. After break, the schedule became even more intense, with rehearsals seven days a week for three hours a day. 
The hard work has paid off. "Eastern Standard" is an intelligent, engaging play which will also make you laugh. Much of this laughter will come after Clarke delivers his lines; making the sarcastic, flippant Drew shine within the solid, talented cast. You will find yourself waiting for his withering remarks whenever another character finishes speaking. 
Much of the entertainment comes from the play itself. Wit flows from many of the lines. For instance, in describing how conservative his mother is, Peter says that there "isn't a revolution in history that wouldn't have failed to execute her." Or when Drew describes the buttoned-down, Wall Street financier Phoebe to Stephen, he says, "She looks like she breakfasts on ticker tape." 
So if you would like to see a play that is intelligent, witty, and filled with good acting, "Eastern Standard" is for you. It begins tonight at Washington Hall and will continue through Sunday, January 31. All times are at 8:10 p.m., except for Sunday, which shows at 3:10 p.m. 

pathetic skills make themselves apparent when tested against real football players, but he survives. 
Moving on to the famous game scene which took place during halftime of the Boston College game, Keenan sets the stage with appropriate slow motion and music similar to that of "Chariots of Fire." Fruity finally gets sent in when Lou determines that no serious damage can occur, and then proceeds to wave to his mother and accidentally run into the quarterback. 
This is just one example of the many entertaining and amusing skits, but the whole performance is just packed with outstanding humor. Of particular mention are: the Battle of the Ross Twins, some incredible choreography in a parody of the SYR situation, a few potshots at the administration and the Irish Guard, as well as Dr. Jack Kevorkian in the Infirmary and a Laundry scene. 
Another memorable performance took place in the second act. Here, a lone piano player appears to entertain the audience with a montage of Billy Joel hits, changing the words to satirize a member of the administration. This act alone is worth the trip over to Saint Mary's to get a glimpse of the Keenan Revue. Don't miss it. 
The Keenan Revue will be held Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights at 7 p.m.

Van Excel exits dog house, helps No. 6 Cincinatti past Xavier, 87-67 
CINCINNATI (AP) -All Nick Van Exel could do for the first 7 1/2 minutes Wednesday night was wring a towel in his hands and squirm in his chair. 
Chastened by his second dis­ciplinary benching this month, Van Exel made up for lost time. He scored 15 points and pol­ished off a decisive first-half run that helped No. 6 Cineinnati beat Xavier 78-67. 

Coach Bob Huggins kept Van Exel, the Bearcats' leading scorer and playmaker, on the bench for reasons neither would divulge. Huggins has been unhappy with Van Exel's effort at times. 
Van· Exel didn't lik-e his courtside seat. 
"I was a little nervous sitting on the bench," he said. "I was nervous when I got in. Then I got a feel for the game." 
Van Exel hit a pair of 3-point­ers, including a 30-footer at the first-half buzzer, to complete a 16-2 run that put Cincinnati (14-1) in line for its 11th straight win. 
It was a familiar script for Xavier (12-3), which has lost its last three against its crosstown rival. The Musketeers lack UC's bench strength, and simply wear down as the game wears on. 

Van Exel was fresh when UC started to pull away -he'd played less than 10 minutes because of his second benching in two weeks. Huggins also sat Van Exel down for much of a nine-point victory over Cleve­land State on Jan. 13 because of poor effort. 
Van Exel provided UC's best moments of the first half, fin­ishing the run that put the Bearcats ahead to stay 38-31 at the half. 
"Van Exel has to be one of the best guards in the country," Xavier coach Pete Gillen said.

CAMPUS MINISTRY 
CONSIDERATIONS 
The Northeast Neighborhood Revisited 
Over the last year and a half, this space has been used, among other things, to call for the leprechaun logo to put down his fighting fists, to challenge off campus students to sit down together more often for meals, and to proclaim the stupidity of getting your best friend totally wasted on his or her twenty,first birthday. Evidence would seem to indicate that none of these most excellent suggestions has yet had a very big impact on the standard operating procedures around here. 
A September '91 column, titled "Our Lady of Sorrows", imagined that the Blessed Mother up on the Dome was saddened as she looked down Notre Dame Avenue and saw the apparent deterioration of the Northeast neighborhood. At the time, violence seemed to be escalating in the area, students were breaking leases to move away from the danger, and the Notre Dame Apartments had taken on a particularly unsavory reputation. Long time residents felt themselves under siege and the reputation of the neighborhood was in jeopardy. 
As it turned out, the Blessed Mother was not the only one from the Administration Building who was concerned about the situation. The Officers of the University were searching for a way to respond to the changing environment. Representatives from the offices of Community Relations, Business Affairs, Security, and the Center for Social Concerns met and began struggling with the complicated issues. A variety of meetings were held with representatives from the Northeast Neighborhood Association and with local residents, and with the mayor's office, the police, and other concerned parties. 
For years the main complaints of the neighbors in the area had concerned the boorish behavior of drunken students, with their loud parties and windblown plastic beer cups. Now the concerns were drive,by shootings and plummeting property values. The University was properly anxious to be involved in the concerns of its neighbors and at the same time wanted to protect the quality of its own front door. 
Fordham, Marquette, Yale , the list of fine private universities surrounded by ravaged neighborhoods is a long one. Notre Dame was not interested in joining the list. 
From all the meetings and all the consultations, a strategy evolved and decisions were. made. Notre Dame, the City of South Bend, Neighborhood Housing Services, and the St. Joseph Medical Center combined to hire an outside consultant to make recommendations and engage in the process of community organizing throughout the neighborhood. Large numbers of local residents, including Notre Dame off campus students, were gathered at Perley School on Eddy Street to voice their concerns and begin to work together towards solutions. That process goes on. 
Notre Dame put a good amount of money behind a local investor, and the Notre Dame Apartments and the adjoining parcels of land between South Bend Avenue, Notre Dame Avenue, and Corby Street were purchased. In the last months the Apartments have been renovated, new sidewalks and landscaping have been added, and the triangle is being prepared as a sight for local governmental services. Advertisements and articles are appearing in The Observer these days, trying to induce Notre Dame students to return to the area. Security has seemed to improve, and the police are supposed to be more present. 
I hope this initiative succeeds. There are so many benefits for everyone involved if this cooperation continues. The relationship of 'town and gown' is sometimes difficult, but in this case, it has a chance to really bring blessings to all concerned. Thanks you's are in order for all those who have worked so hard to bring us this far. 
If things can get back to where they were· in the more peaceful days of some years ago, and students return to share in the life of the Notre Dame Avenue neighborhood, eventually there might even be enough good will left over to figure out what to do about the windblown plastic beer cups.

Woman says she was offfered Rose still a gamblin' man? 
MIAMI (AP) -Pete Rose says he hasn't resumed

money for silence in Tyson case gambling. He doesn't say he's 
INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -A former beauty pageant contes­tant whom Mike Tyson was convicted of raping denied Wednesday that she sought to profit from the case, saying she had ample opportunity to ac­cept money for her silence. 
"The fact is they offered me the money to drop the charges," Desiree Washington said in a television interview. 
"If I was after money all along, I could have taken the money when the ministers came, took me from my from my (exam) finals and everything and offered me all that money," she said. A Baptist minister has been accused of perjuring himself when he denied offering Washington and her family $1 million. 
Tyson, a former heavyweight boxing champion, was con­victed a year ago of raping the Coventry, H.l., woman in July 1991. At the time, Washington was a participant in the Miss Black America Pageant in Indi­anapolis. Tyson was sentenced to six years in the Indiana Youth Center. 
An appeal of his case goes before the Indiana Court of Ap­peals on Feb. 15. 
"It is noteworthy that she has now elected to give a television interview in Indianapolis where the appeal is pending," Tyson's Boston-based attorney, Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz, said in response to the interview.

-Dershowitz has criticized Washington for allegedly with­holding the fact that she had hired an attorney to negotiate rights to her story, and has ac­cused her of trying to profit from the case. Some members of Tyson's jury would have voted to acquit him had they known Washing­ton was shopping her story 
SCOTTSDALE. Ariz. (AP) ­Having beaten alcohol through consistent denial, John Daly wants to make consistency a hallmark of his game. 
"I hope I'll get more consis­tent. I'm sure I should," the 26­year-old golfer said Tuesday. "I guess if you work hard at something, you're going to get it right," 
Daly will make what he calls "my comeback" here Thursday in the Phoenix Open, getting a late start after 3 1/2 weeks in an alcohol-rehabilitation clinic. 
The tour's longest hitter for two straight years, Daly has been accused of sacrificing ac­curacy for the excitement of crushing the ball. For example, while finishing first in driving distance last year (283.4 yards), he was 162nd in fairway accuracy and 77th in hitting greens in regulation. 
However, Daly said he be­lieves his victory in the B.C. Open last fall shows that his short game has progressed. 
"There were a lot of tourna­ments where I'd just go in and not even practice, just go out and tee it up, and sometimes I'd do well and sometimes I wouldn't, so I'm really more focused on somewhat of a 
-
schedule to go by and just work on my game a lot more than last year," Daly said. 
Daly won the tournament's Long Drive Contest with a 315­yard blast. His first drive in the two-ball event was 311 yards. 
''I'm hitting the driver real well," he said. "My long irons aren't where I'd like them to be, and of course you always lose 
,, ~ 

i 
quit, either. 
But he says he's concerned with the impression people get, and he says it's unfair to give the impression he's hanging around the tracks gambling at the same time he's seeking reinstatement to baseball. 
"I do no illegal gambling." Rose said Wednesday in a telephone interview from his home in Boca Raton. Fla. "I'd be lying if I told you I didn't (gamble), because I went to the Kentucky Derby with the governor of Kentucky on his train last year." 
The former Cincinnati Reds player and manager and ca­reer hits leaders was perma­nently barred from baseball in 1989 for gambling. He said he has no plans to apply for rein­statement now, especially be­cause there isn't a commis­sioner. 
Baseball's got plenty of other things to worry about." Rose said. "I don't want to prepare a letter asking for reinstatement and then have it sit on the back burner." 
around, Dershowitz said. Washington has denied hiring an attorney for that purpose. 
In June, Washington filed a civil lawsuit against Tyson seek­ing unspecified damages for assault, battery, false impris­onment and intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress. 
Washington's comments came during interviews in Boston and Hhode Island with WTHR-TV of Indianapolis. The series of reports continued Wednesday. 
Washington did not name the source of the alleged bribe during the interview. 
The Rev. T.J. Jemison of Ba­ton Rouge, La., faces a federal perjury charge. Prosecutors contend Jemison -the head of the National Baptist Convention U.S.A., the nation's largest black religious group -denied offering the $1 million while testifying during a fraud trial unrelated to the Tyson case. 
Jemison, who has pleaded innocent, was scheduled to go in trial Wednesday, but his case was postponed until May 3. 
Rose took issue with a Cincinnati Post story which he said gives the wrong impres­sion about his current activities. He said he hadn't read· the story, but has seen headlines that said he was seeking reinstatement to baseball at the same time he has resumed gambling. 
Rose said he thought the story created the impression he was gambling all the time and actively seeking reinstatement. He told The Post that he went to the Kentucky Derby last year, but he does not go to the track regularly. 
But he noted that he wouldn't go to the Derby just to watch the horses. "I can go to the farm to watch the horses," he said. 
The newspaper also said he planned to apply for reinstate­ment "in the very near fu­ture." 
Mark Tomasik, sports editor of the Cincinnati Post, said Wednesday that the Post story was accurate. 
"We have Pete's interview on tape and we have reviewed the tape several times," Tomasik said.

After the two free throws, Perry's desperate shot at the buzzer never had a chance, giving the Pacers a 3-0 record against the Sixers this season. 
Reggie Miller scored 19 points and George McCloud 17 for the Pacers, who didn't have a turnover in the second half after trailing by 16 at halftime. 
Hersey Hawkins had the first triple-double of his four-year career with 28 points, 13 re­bounds and 10 assists for Philadelphia. 
Hornets 117, Kings 107 
Rookie Alonzo Mourning scored all of his 23 points in the second half, keeping Charlotte in control against Sacramento. 
The Hornets also got 21 points from Johnny Newman, 19 from Dell Curry and 17 points and 15 rebounds from Larry Johnson to even their home record at 9­9 and their overall mark to 19­19. 
The Kings, losers of seven of nine games, were led by Lionel Simmons with 26 points and Mitch Richmond with 23.

L. A. Raiders at crossroads; AI Davis just wants to win 
EL SEGUNDO, Calif. (AP) ­lie's accomplished more than most in the world of sports could possibly imagine. Yet, at age 63, AI Davis wants more. lie wants to just win again, baby. 
And he believes he will. 
Davis' beloved Los Angeles Haiders didn't win this past season, going 7-9 and missing the playoffs for the first time since 1989. And that wasn't all. It was a turmoil-filled four months for owner and team. 
Following his induction into the NFL Hall of Fame last summer, it should have been a pleasant fall. 
It wasn't. 
"I accept it," Davis said Tuesday in an interview at his ollice. "It's like (former Haiders coach) John Madden said: 'One of the great things about working for AI Davis is he always gets the blame.' 
"I just finished 30 years here. If they want to blame me for the last 30 years, I'll take it." 
In 1963, Davis took over an Oakland franchise that had won only nine of 42 games in the 

first three years of the 
American Football League. 
Since then, the Haiders have a 
285-146-11 regular-season 
record, they're the only team to 
play in Super Bowls in the 
1960s, 1970s and 1980s, and 
they've won three of pro foot­
ball's biggest games, most re­
cently nine years ago. An AFC 
team hasn't won since. 
"I want to win. The flame that 
burns brightest in me will 
always be the will to win," 
Davis said. "I want to fight 
back. The will to win is there. 
Why? I don't know. I want to _play in the Super Bowl again. 
::when you dominate in every 
decade, the expectations 
worldwide are so great, every­
one expects us to win every 
year and win big. And when we 
don't, boy, oh, boy. 
"We lost the first four games 
this year and we were being hit 
from all sides. There were two 
key games and we just couldn't 
break through -the Dallas 
game and the San Diego game 
down there." 
After losing their first four 
games, the Haiders won three

straight, including a 20-3 vic­tory over the AFC champion Buffalo Bills. Two weeks after beating the Bills, they lost to Dallas 28-13 after leading 13-7 in the third quarter. 
On. Nov. 29, the Haiders lost at San Diego 27-3 to all but eliminate them from playoff contention. That was officially taken care of 15 days later when they lost at Miami 20-7. 
It was at halftime of the Mi­ami game, on a Monday night, that veteran running back Marcus Allen, in a taped inter­view, claimed Davis ordered his playing time reduced to keep Allen out of the Hall of Fame. 
In a nationally_televised in­terview on Jan. 10, Davis said what Allen did and said were "blatant lies" and that Allen "sneakedly and in a cheap-shot way brought (Raiders coach) Art Shell into it. ... It forced Art to call him a liar, and (this from) someone who was a distraction and a cancer to our football team." 
Davis said he stood on those comments Tuesday. 
"It's not an issue any more," 

Davis said. "I think over time, 
the true story will come out. It's 
over. My thing is the Haiders 
winning. I'm not interested in a 
brush fire over here. I'm not 
looking to win these battles. 
That's not what drives me." 
Davis spoke more openly on 
several other issues. 
He smiled when asked about 
people who say he coaches the 
Raiders, not Shell. 
"They said it about John 
Madden, they said it about Tom 
Flores, and I guess they say it 
now," Davis said. "But I don't. 
I've gone through this every 
decade. They're totally wrong. 
There's no way any outsider 
could coach the team. It's just 
ludicrous. 
''I'm involved. I make sug­gestions from time to time, ob­viously. If I were coaching the team, I would tell you. I make · suggestions on the game plans. Sometimes they don't listen to 
me." 
With a laugh, he said, "The 
only times I've coached is in 
those three Super Bowl wins." 
About his team's quarterback 
situation, Davis said, "It's pretty obvious we're uncertain at quarterback. We thought we had it in 1990 (when Jay Schroeder played fulltime and the Haiders went 12-4). We had Bo (Jackson) with us and he took a lot of pressure off the quarterback. 
"It's unsettled. We hope to address it. Jay is maligned un­fairly. He's never going to sat­isfy them (the fans). Maybe it's best that he migrate (through free agency)." 
Todd Marinovich was elevated to first-string status over Schroeder after two games and started seven games before be­ing benched in favor of Schroeder. 
Marinovich finished his sec­ond NFL season as the third­stringer, behind Schroeder and 37-year-old Vince Evans, who led the Haiders to a season­ending victory over the Wash­ington Redskins. 
"Does he have a future'? We'll see if he has a future," Davis said of Marinovich. "If he's stable, he has a future. lie has qualities to be an excellent quarterback. 

Familiar faces in Women's Australia 
MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) -Monica, Steffi, Gabriela and Arantxa. They've become such fixtures at the Grand Slam semifinals that any tennis fan knows them by their first names. 
They took 12 of the 16 semi­final spots at the four Grand Slam events last year, and they will be facing off again Thurs­day at the Australian Open, where they're the top four seeds. 
Monica Seles, the top seed and defending champion, will put her 19-match Australian winning streak on the line against third-seeded Gabriela Sabatini of Argentina, while No. 2 Steffi Graf of Germany tries to use her forehand power to beat speedy Arantxa Sanchez Vicario of Spain. the fourth seed. 
All four had tough times in their quarterfinal matches Tuesday. 
The graceful Sabatini had to fight off three match points to down 10th-seeded Mary Pierce of France in a three-set match that lasted nearly three hours and didn't end until 1:45 a.m. 
A hoarse Sabatini called her comeback one of the best of he~: career. But while Pierce cer­tainly had sting in her shots,

Sabatini knows that Seles' two­fisted blasts and ability to con­centrate will be even tougher. 
''I'm really looking forward to this match," Sabatini said. "I feel I'm ready to play against Monica. I'm going to have to be pretty aggressive and just try to fight each point because that's how she plays." 
Seles leads 8-3 in their head­to-head meetings and has won the last three, although she needed three sets in one match and a tiebreaker in another. 
The Yugoslav-born Florida resident surpassed $7 million in career earnings with her three­set victory over unseeded Julie Halard of France in the quarterfinals, a match that showed an attacking style can pressure Seles.

Bol's agent, Frank Catapano, said the 7 -foot-7 native of the Sudan and his wife have regu­larly contributed sizable por­tions of his salary to his home­land for famine relief. 
"Knowing Manute and his wife, it wouldn't surprise me if a good bit of (the winnings) is earmarked for a similar pur­pose," he said. 
Bol, who will make $1.65 million this season with the 76ers, didn't share his wife's luck. He was ejected in the first quarter of Tuesday night's game at New York for throwing a punch at the Knicks' Anthony Mason. 

Crowley shot three-for-nine as the Belles' defense kept the score to 30-33, at the half. 
Most of the second-half turned into a nightmare. The Belles were held scoreless for the first six minutes. That's when Coach Wood pulled all his starters out and subbed in his bench. 
"I was sick and tired. Nothing offensively was happening and defense played sloppy," said Wood. 
With the score hanging at 30-41 Albion, the Saint Mary's bench came in and broke the dry spell. Freshman Kristen Ross stepped up by scoring two and following up by sinking a trey. 
"He (Coach Wood) made his point. It was a wake-up call," said Crowley. 
The last seven minutes, the Belles owntld the court. Liz Vernasco hit two free throws and then Taubenheim stole the ball sinking her basket. With 
4:07 left on the clock, Verna.sco tied the score, 54-54. 
From there on in, the lead changed hands five times. But it would be no Hollywood end­ing for the Belles. 
With four seconds left, Albion got in the last basket on an inbounds pass. Vernasco took one last shot at the basket but could only find the rim. 
"We came back and had them against the ropes but we couldn't knock them down," said Crowley.

Big Ten Basketball should go far in NCAA Tourney 
Move over. National Football 
Conference. 

Now there's an even more dominant 
conference in the realm of athletics-Big 
Ten basketball. 

As in the NFC Championship, the 
team with the strength to endure such 
a rigorous Big Ten schedule, game-in 
game-out, and win the conference 
championship, has the inside track on 
the NCAA tournament Championship 
this year. 

In the Midwest hoops harvest this 
season, the Big Ten is reaping an 
abundant crop of recognition. 
COrrently. four of the "Elite Eleven" 
stand in the nation's top-25, 
highlighted by last year's Final Four 
participants Indiana and Michigan. 

Indiana (pardon my Hoosier bias) has 
to be the favorite. This season, five 
teams have had short-termed 
ownership of the dangerous pole­
position. Among them, the Hoosiers 
(17 -2) now stand just one spot below 
No. 1 Kansas. 

Love him or hate him, Bobby Knight 
knows how to teach, to discipline and 
to motivate more than anybody in 
college basketball; these qualities 
breed championships. 

The General's veteran team will be 
more prepared this time around, with 
All-American Calbert Cheaney 
providing leadership and an 
unstoppable scoring force. Also, look 
for key contributions down the stretch 
from "diaper dandy" Brian Evans and 
dutch-shooter Todd Leary. 

The "Fab Five" of Michigan showed 
plenty of poise in last year's tourney. 
But Webber and Co. fell victim to the 
Hoosiers' biggest weakness-their front 
line of Alan Henderson and Matt Nover. 
Look for Webber and/or Jalen Rose to 
lose focus in the tournament and 
decide to jump to the NBA, ASAP. 

A tragic car accident robbed No. 11 
Iowa of a key contributor in forward 
Chris Street. But perhaps it will lend 
them inspiration, an intangible that 
could separate the Hawkeyes from 
ot_her talent-wealthy teams in the 
conference. Giant center Acie Earl 
reminds some of the Shaq, and will 
ddinitely carry Iowa farther than 
O'Neil did LSU last year. at least to the 
Sweet-16. 

Purdue eoach Gene Keady has things 
brewing in West LaFayette, thanks to 
newcomer Glenn Hobinson. Indiana's 
Mr. Basketball two yBars rBmoved, 
Hobinson has shown no ill effects of the 
yBar of repast. carrying this one-man 
team at No. 14. Missing transfer Travis 
Trice, Keady needs to lind a quick point 
guard to run the team, along with some 
consistent play big-bodies Kenny 
Williams and lan Stanback.

Missouri dumps 

COLUMBIA, Mo. {AP) -Mark Atkins came off the bench to score 17 points and key a second-half rally as Missouri defeated cold-shooting Notre Dame 73­57 Wednesday night.

Notre Dame took an early 10-4 lead before Atkins scored seven points in a 13-1 Missouri run that put the Tigers ahead 17-11 with 9:20 to go.

Women hoops hopes to bounce back vs. Evansville 
By JASON KELLY Sports Writer 
In college basketball, there is no time to dwell on a tough loss. Another game, another opportunity is right around the corner. 
That's the situation the Notre Dame women's basketball team faces tonight. After a 71-55 loss to DePaul on Monday, the Irish had to rebound quickly for tonight's Midwestern Collegiate Conference game at Evansville. 
The Irish played ten minutes of brilliant basketball to erase a big DePaul lead in the second half on Monday. But they faltered down the stretch and the Blue Demons handed them a stinging defeat. 
"The second half run (against DePaul) gave us some confidence," Irish coach Muffet McGraw said. "If we put it to­gether for 40 minutes we can beat anyone." 


They will need 40 minutes of good play to knock off MCC rival Evansville. The Purple Aces are 12-4 overall and 5-2 in the conference, just one game behind Notre Dame. 
Evansville sophomore Tricia Deffendoll gave the Irish fits last season. Notre Dame easily won both contests, but the 5'7" guard averaged 16 points against the Irish. 
Senior Christy Greis, a daunting presence inside at 6'4", is the MCC's rebounding and blocked-shots leader. averaging 13.1 boards per game and turning away 2.5 shots. 
Junior guard Amy Lefever balances Greis' outside attack with a 44-percent clip from behind the three-point line to lead the MCC. 
"They are a very balanced team," McGraw said. "They have some big people inside and they shoot the three

Letitia Bowen, Notre Dame's main inside threat. is hobbled with a bruised foot and senior guard Coquese Washington is nursing a knee problem. Both are expected to play, but they haven't been able to practice in recent days. 
The Irish won't have any time to rest after the Evansville game. MCC leader Butler. who lost by only six to No. 25 Kentucky. awaits on Saturday. 
The Bulldogs boast MCC player-of-the­week Julie VonDielingen, who averaged 28 points per game last week, and pulled down 8.5 rebounds in wins over Xavier and Dayton. 
"Butler is another team with great balance," McGraw explained. "It is difficult to play down there and they will be ready for us."
