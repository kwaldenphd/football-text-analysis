Miss Tracey. 
Miss Tracey questioned whether Sr. Alma and the Board were looking for a specific person to fit into the spot. In considering the repercussions of the appointment for SMC Miss Tracey had a number of'ques­tions. "We must know if this person is in agreement with stu­dent policies. Why was she selected without student or faculty consultation? What is her stand toward coeducation? Will she actively support it?" 
Miss Tracey contended that all those questions should have been answered before Dr. Cannon was hired. 
Fr. Raymond Runde, a mem­ber of the student affairs com­mittee, of which Dr. Cannon will be a vital part, claimed that her 
appointment was "a unilateral
....~~ 
decision without consulting the committee, students or faculty." He speculated that this could be the end of the community tri­partite government at St. Mary's. Denying the charge that the plan undermines community government, Sr. Alma stated "If there's anybody who has tried to uphold community government, I have. The idea originated with Student suggestions and concern which indicated that they felt the need for such a top adminis­trator who'll have the last word 
on student affairs."  
Although  she  would  not

president's  responsibilities  she  

revealed that the new 'vice­president will see "that the office is staffed adequately and effectively" relieving the dean of students of "exasperating administrative tasks such as spending hours trying to find nurses to staff the infirmary." 
Sister Alma based her actions on a mandate from the Board of Trustees October 10 1970 which stated, "to study ;eriously the need of increasing the various counseling services of the college, if possible, supplement the academic counseling before the second semester.'' 
She reported that as a result of a report by the Educational Policy Committee, the Board

In response to resident's re­quests, outside doors to Alumi Hall will be locked twenty-four

Director of security Arthur Pears said, "The doors were re­quested by Alumni residents in the fall afttri the1 stabbing inci­dent at Alumni.

He added that "The $1000 door system was financed by the university. It should be working by tomor­row." 

Alumni Hall rector, Father Mulcahy, said, "There would be few exceptions to the twenty­four hour locked door rule. On football and other major week­ends when there will be a large number of visitors, the doors will be opened." 
Mulcahy further commented that "A one dollar deposit for the cards will be required of each resident. This money will be kept to go toward financing new cards for the following year." 
"Visitors to A.Jumni Hall can enter the lobby but will have to call the resident that they are visiting to come down and let them in," Mulcahy said. He added that "In case of a party, one of the residents will have to be at the door with his card to let the guests in."

Page 4 THE OBSERVER Friday, January 29, 1971 
Complete text of Park-Mayhew Report 
St. Mary's 'college and the University of Notre Dame have existed side by side for over one hundred and twenty-five years, based in the same religious and cultural traditions, emphasizing the same educational values and reinforcing each other as they respectively provided educa­tion for young Catholic women and young Catholic men. Throughout that period, while there were always examples of irritations, mutual aloofness and some­times invidious judgements of the other institution, the relationships have been close, friendships between the Sisters of the Holy Cross and the Priests of the Holy Cross warm and mutually respect­ing. 
Generations of St. Mary's graduates married Notre Dame graduates, thus stregnthening alumni regard for the two institutions. In some respects the two institutions could simply perpetuate their 
parallel development. However, there are powerful forces operating today to sug­gest the need for changed relationships. 
Colleges and universities do not exist in a vacuum but rather are affected by broad changes and movements in the society and the national educational com­munity within which they exist. Current­ly, American higher education is experi­encing the most radical changes in its three hundred year history; and several of these have particular significance for the relationships between two colleges whose borders are only a mile and a half apart. First, there is the fact that as higher education has become more complex and expensive, autonomous single-campus in­stitutions have proven inadequate to meet the needs of ever-increasing enrollment of constantly expanding heterogeneity. Thus publicly controlled higher education has created state-wide coordinating commis­sions and committees, supra-institutional boards of control and full state-wide systems of higher education governed by a single board of trustees. Privately con­trolled institutions of higher education have found it necessary to engage in many different forms of cooperation, coordination, and even merger. Thus the Great Lakes College Association or the Associated Colleges of the Midwest have banded together to provide enriched edu­cational opportunities and some econo­
mies of operation such as coordinated purchasing. Private institutions in Mis­souri have formed cooperative alliances with the publicly supported University of Missouri for mutual benefits. Case Insti­tute and Western Reserve University have actually merged to strengthen the educa­tional and research efforts of each. In part, these newer arrangements have been established to meet financial or organiza­tional problems; but to an even greater degree they have been set up to provide an enriched program of study for more sophisticated entering students whose needs were increasingly beyond the edu­cational resourses of a single institution. 
Coordination among institutions has been fostered too by the fact that since the end of World War II profound changes in the relationships between the sexes have developed resulting in the gradual elimination of collegiate institu­tions which are limited to one sex. Co-education has become the rule for even bastions of single-sex education like Princeton, Yale and Vassar. While a few institutions intend to persist in traditional styles of single-sex education, a close analysis of them reveals that each exists in a community where there are opportu­nities to students of one sex to relate socially and academically with students of the opposite sex in a nearby institu­tion. For example, Stephens College in Columbia, Missouri, can probably remain a women's institution becauseof the close proximity to the University of Missouri, and of the opportunities both institutions provide for students to attend classes and social events on the other campus. Especi­ally significant has been a fundamental change with regard to appropriate roles and car::ers for women and.the concomit­ant ed uca tiona! experiences required which sometimes exceed the capabilities of smaller institutions. 
The full significance of these changes has been made stridently apparent to colleges anduniversities in the decade of the 60's through the influence of student opinion and the emergence of student power. Indeed, it was student opinion which led Princeton University to open its doors to women just as student discon­tent has brought many institutions to review century-old grading practices, de­partmental hegemony over courses and living styles of students on campuses, in 
residence halls, and in fraternities and sororities. St. Mary's College and the University of Notre Dame cannot remain aloof from the effects of these develop­
ments. 

Apart from this national trend, how­ever, the two institutions themselves re­veal conditions which warrant a reexami­nation of relationships. It has long been apparent that St. Mary's College and the University of Notre Dame are the two most distinguished Catholic institutions of their type in the United States. Father Andrew Greeley once remarked: "As Notre Dame goes, so very likely will go all of Catholic higher education in this coun­try." If national developments have been correctly assessed, then these two institu­tions, by studying and making changes in their relationships now, have the opportu­nity to become a model for other pairs and groups of colleges and universities which are subject to the same national pressures. By undertaking a reexamina­tion of their mutual responsibilities, No­tre Dame and St. Mary's will continue to provide leadership for all Catholic higher 
education. 

Quite aside from the opportunity to 
influence national developments the insti­
tutions need to examine their relation­
ships in order to avoid duplications of 
services and of effort which neither can 
afford at a time of increasing costs and 
restriction of funds. Some of these ser­
vices, such as admissions, development 
and registration, could be made even 
more effective by coordination. There are 
a !soduplications in course offerings 
which, if removed by cooperative plan­
ning, could result in redeployment of 
faculty time, thereby substantially en­
riching programs offered to students. In 
addition, both St. Mary's college and the 
University of Notre Dame have particular 
ec!H~:~tional strengths and uniqueness 
which, if shared, could benefit the young 
people of eacn campus. The students 
would also profit from a clearer aware­
ness on the part of the institutions of the 
desire of contemporary youth to meet 
freely in social and academic settings with 
young people of the opposite sex. On 
both the University of Notre Dame cam­
pus and at St. Mary's College there is 
currently strong pressure for arrange-· 
ments to facilitate this interaction. These 
pressures are great enough, though vary­
ing somewhat in intensity from one cam­
pus to the other, to assume safely that 
some changes will certainly occur. A 
thoughtful response would seem prefer­
able to precipitous action by either one 
or both of the institutions. It would be, 
for example, unfortunate indeed if the 
University felt compelled to take unilater­
al action and become a co-educational 
institution, thus entering into direct com­
petition with St. Mary's. 

An important and pervasive force for 
change arises too from the fact that both institutions have begun cooperation and coordination of some activities with vary­ing degrees of success in the outcome. Understandably these first attempts have produced some friction and some awk­wardness which might of course escalate and force resolution by precipitous means. Bringing about cooperation even between departments of academic men and women can be such a laborious undertaking that in frustration some par­ticipants may decide to stop the effort on the basis that anything is better than this 
excessive concern for trivia. 
At a time when all of private higher 
education in America is in jeopardy as it 
competes with expanded capacity in the 
public sector. There can be real question whether the University of Notre Dame and St. Mary's College can remain viable in they follow completely independent courses. Should the University of Notre Dame and St. Mary's College each be­come co-educational institutions, they would be thrown into competitiOn for the same students and the same sources of funds, which would leave one or the other considerable weaker. If the two mounted independent development pro­grams, there is reason to expect donor reticence on the ground that supporting two independent agencies sharing the same traditions, values, and even loca­tions is really misuse of scarce resources. It seems obvious that a liberal arts college such as St. Mary's College needs the resources of a University to provide the education its sophisticated students re­quire; but it is also true that a profession­alized university emphsizinggraduate training, research and preparation for the professions, needs the humanizing in­fluence of a liberal arts college. 
While such argument is persuasive, there are forces and factors operating in the opposite direction, suggesting caution in establishing closer relationships be­tween the two institutions. First among these is the possibility that the differing emphases of an undergraduate college and a university stressing and professional work might be incompatible -incompa­tible with respect to staffing, course offerings and financing, and even overall 
intellectual style. This would be parti­cularly manifest if an attempt were made to fuse a department of St. Mary's Col­lege which stresses liberalizing values, with a department at the lhiversity of Notre Dame stressing professional values. A manifestatioa of this potential incom­patibility is the danger that a smaller institution drawing closer to a larger would lose a valued identity created over a long history. St. Mary's Cbllege has made a distinctive and recognized contribution to the education of Catholic women and it guards its heritage tenaciously and with reason. 

A second factor is related to external support of the two institutions. As they have developed indigenously, they have developed loyal alumni and friends of each institution. There is danger that this loyalty might be endangered if the two institutions were joined more closely. Similarly, since the two institutions re­flect the educational interests of sup­porting religious Orders, there is the possibility that closer relationships could jeopardize that interest. It is at least conceivable that should St. Mary's Col­lege become associated with the Univer­sity of Notre Dame in some organic way, the congregation of the Sisters of the Holy Cross might turn its interests, atten­tion and support to other activities of the Order, thus denying such things as finan­cial security and contributed services of the Sisters to the College and the same phenomenon might happen on the other campus. 
Then, too, there are a number of real and perhaps valid fears peculiar to each campus. There is the fear on the part of some of the University of Notre Dame 
faculty that closer relationships would serve to weaken the thrust for academic excellence which has characterized the history of Notre Dame in the last fifteen ' years. There is fear on the part of some of the faculty at St. Mary's College that a closer relationship with Notre Dame would endanger the sense of community and tranquillity characteristic of ST. Miry's College, which has been such a potent force in the education of young women in the past. There is fear on the part of St. Mary's faculty that alliance with professionalized faculties from Notre Dame would distort the human­izing and liberalizing focus of its curri­culum. And there is fear on the part of some faculty members at the University of Notre Dame that differing depart­mental emphases are so pronounced that any sort of fusion would distort and 
dissipate educational energies. There is also a kind og generalized fear that growing together in perilous times might actually weaken both. And especially on the campus of St. Mary's College, there is the genuine fear that coming together would be detrimental personally and pro­fessionally to many staff and faculty members. 
In addition, there are the myriad pro~ cesses and bureaucratic differences that could prove to be obstacles in closer relationships. Each institution has its own set of regulations regarding student con­
duct and they differ. Each institution provides advising and counseling with students in different ways, and bringing them together would certainly prove vex­atious. Then, too, the respective physical plants were created to serve quite indigen­ous needs. Closer cooperation would imply exploiting physical capacity of both campuses; but the very differences in kind and quality of space would make such exploitation most difficult. This last point can be well illustrated by the 
differing needs for space of the Arts Departments of the two campuses. 
Especially during the past several years the two institutions as we have noted have cooperated extensively in a number of areas. Some assessment of those efforts might be instructive at this point. The coordinating committee, with represen­tatives from the two institutions, and chaired by Father Sheedy seems to have performed well in general and to have accomplished a great deal in facilitating cooperative activities and generating a climate conducive to working together. While some criticism has been leveled at the committee on the grounds that it spent unnecessary time in detail, the fact that it did facilitate departments meeting, it did study potentialities for cooopera­tion it did expand the cooperative ex­char{ge program, and it did bring into existence such things as joint listin~s ot courses, comparable course numbering and the like, is impressive evidence. Fur­
ther, as the more intensive study of cooperative possibilities in setting tne tone and direction of that inquiry and proved a valid testing device for ideas as they 
emerged. 
Generally, there seems to be a much 
more open atmosphere regarding coopera­
tion between the two institutions than in 
times past despite the fears referred to 
before. BoardsofTrustees,alumni 
groups, students, faculty and administra­
tors, who but a few years earlier would 
have been resistant to the idea of close 
relationships between the two institu­
tions, seem to have changed their minds 
and appear quite ready to examine next 
steps. With only a few exceptions, the 
most frequently expressed opinion was 
that the two institutions could never 
return to their previous isolation and that 
the only viable direction for movement 
was toward close and closer relationships 
and greater and greater cooperation. Even 
within departments having individuals an­
tagonistic to the idea of more unity of 
effort, there was acceptance of the fact 
that closer relationships seemed inevitable 
and that after momentary disfunctions 
they could be accomodated. 
Given the differences between the two institutions and the human reluctances and bureaucratic complexities as barriers to an effective program of academic exchange, the results of the cooperative exchange program have been impressive. The figures for the academic year 1970-71 suggest that the cooperative ex­change program is functioning well under relatively free market conditions. Thus, we are informed that over 700 girls are taking over 1400 courses at Notre Dame and slightly over 700 Notre Dame stu­dents are taking slightly over 1400 courses on the 3:. Mary's campus. It is expected that if the curricula at the two institutions are made even more flexible, these numbers will increase slightly and there will be more students presenting themselves to the other campus to take their major work. It is true that personal

animos1ties and departmental differences have caused irritation, thus requiring a heavy load of courses in the students' major to be taken at the native campus. A completely free flow of students back and forth has thus been prevented. From time to time advising appears to have been chauvinistic by urging students away from courses on the other campus which were competitive with those offered lo­cally. Further, reaching the position where most courses were eligible for student enrollment from the other cam­pus was arrived at reluctantly and only after considerable effort on the part of the coordinating committee. The fact, however, is that decisions were made and the activity is well along toward becom­ing institutionalized. 
The record of departments joining to­gether and functioning as units is spotty. In Education and in Speech and Drama the results seem impressive, with the combined faculties reflecting a high esprit de corps and a clear willingness to share 
resources and to combine for appropriate emphases. Several, however, have not either wished to or been able to function as a unity for a variety of reasons. The departments of History and Music are simply illustrative, although several de­partments reflecting a desire to cooperate also point up fundamental educational differences. The Art Department at Notre Dame, for example, sees one style for itself, whereas the Art Department at St. Mary's perceives a different mission. 
Given the inately threatening character of an inquiry which could affect the destinies of two institutions, and their personnel, the amount of overt anta­gonism and resistance to change seems to have been quite modest. There are people on each campus who don't like their counterparts on the other. There are instances of lack of professional regard and there seems to have been a normal amount of picayune behavior and fault­finding; but virtually so one seems so violently opposed to change as to wish to jeopardize the entire inquiry. A much more frequently encountered pheno­menon was the belief that greater co­operation was desirable and that it was feasible ~but that nothing would or could be done about the matter in the absence of pressure from above or from outside the particular unit. Testimony was re­ceived from a number of departments or organizations that after some initial joint conversations nothing much had hap­pened or, indeed, seemed likely to hap­pen until a general policy directive from the central administrations of the two institutions were issued. One joint meet­ing of two departments in the same field, held in October, 1970, was the first time that the two departments had come together in the memory of those present. 
Student leaders on the two campuses seemed well disposed to work together for the mutual benefits of both. Some of their plans and studies reflected not only great co operation but considerable sophistication as welL Limited public opinion polling, as well as impressions from interviews, suggest that the two student bodies would welcome much closer relationships in the future. There probably is a slight difference in emphasis in this judgment at Notre Dame and on the St. Mary's campus. The Notre Dame men seem much more concerned with having a larger proportion of women on the Notre Dame campus than was true of the women's institution with respect to men on its campus. 
Some bureaucratic vexations exist, of course. St. Mary's girls feel slighted when they are denied equal access to recre­ational facilities on the Notre Dame campus and Notre Dame officials in some. offices feel that the University is carrying a disproportionately heavy financial bur­den in such cooperative ventures as joint registration. Differences in food services on the two campuses have produced some feelings of irritation; and differences in student personnel policies have generated occasional feelings of frustration, irrita­tion and threat. 
At the administrative level, while there 
were obvious individual differences, the 
experiences of the past several years have 
suggested still further cooperation and

5. 
To this end he should be charged to study departmental relationships, to sug­gest reasonable ways of cooperation to examine budgetary support and to take unresolved controversy directly to the Presidents of the two institutions for solution. 

6. 
He should have the power to exa­mine such innovative educational con­cepts as the experimental college, and after consultation with the committees of the two institutions recommended to the two Presidents and Board of Trustees, that such an educational experiment or others come into existence for a limited number of semesters subject to later evaluation of the faculties as to its place in the regular offerings of the institutions. 


Using such critieria as efficiency of operation, the needs of the two cam­puses, rights of individual faculty mem­bers or staff, and contributions to the long-term cooperation of the two institu­tions, the Coordinator should devote con­siderable attention to following adminis­trative matters: 
1. 
The registrar's offices and the admis­sions staffs of the two institutions should become single units operating with a unified budget contributed proportion­ately by the two institutions and possible making use of a branch office. A branch office should be maintained on each campus but the central location for each function should be placed where most convenient and efficient. Personnel from each campus should always be represent­ed in the joint operation, and the coordi­nator should have power to approve all changes in personnel within the joint budget. For such offices, as for others, selection of personnel should be deter­mined by years of service and by capacity to insure that the interests of both institutions are thoroughly safeguarded. 

2. 
Psychological services and counsel­ing should also be created as a single entity with the location of the two probably on the Notre Dame campus but with a branch office at St. Mary's College, in charge of a person holding a joint appointment in St. Mary's and Notre Dame. 

3. 
When the University of Notre Dame completes its contracted-for expanded computer capacity, computer services for both institutions should be combined. This may require several years to accom­plish because of contractual obligations of St. Mary's College to St. Joseph's Hospital; but in the long run it would appear wise to bring these together. 

4. 
For a time, since the University of Notre Dame provided its own food ser­vices and St. Mary's College contracts with Saga Food Services, these may have to function separately. However, the Co­ordinator should try, in one way or another, to bring prices so into line that students from one institution can eat at the other simply by using a meal card issued by his or her native institution. 

5. 
Since the heads of the two security forces seem to work well together, their future cooperation could be_ assumed in developing a joint plan which would make the security forces into one organi­zation. 

6. 
It seems imperative that the two Development offices should have the clo­sest possible relationship so that all devel­opment campaigns could be devised to strengthen the finances of both institu­tions. 

7. 
For a time, a joint committee, per­haps of students and administrators, on Student Personnel seems desirable, which would be able to coordinate activities but still maintain essential differences consis­tent with the traditions on the two campuses. 

8. 
Similarly, the religious life on the two campuses might at the beginning best be the concern of a joint committee rather than a fused or integrated campus ministry. 

9. 
The Coordinator would also want to bring about unification of catalogs, publi­cations and other forms of public com­munication which seem appropriate. 


A major part of the efforts of the coordinator will be to effect appropriate arrangements between academic depart­ments for the curriculum. As a general rule, departments from the two institu­

Abortion arguements rebuted 
(Continued from Page 1) 
that era pointed out the opposi­tion to abortion and contracep­tion. St. Thomas and St. Augus­tine called abortion homocide and the Early Church prohibited abortion in a "very absolute 
sen~;e." 
It was in the 1900's that the Church decided that the fetus had a soul and they returned to the absolutism of the early Church. Pius IX decreed that any abortion caused excom­munication and this was re­
affirmed by Pius XII and 
Vatican II. 

"The point I'm trying to make is that the Church has been consistent in condemning abortion, it is just that the application has been restudied and re-evaluated," he remarked, The application has always varied, but the consistency has remained." 
Prof. Rice closed the session with the legal ramifications of abortion. 
"Presently, the trend in law is towards recognizing the child in the womb as a human being," Rice said. "In California, 97% of the abortions are performed under the mental health clause. This is a sham. This is taking a life for a lesser concern or for convenience. It's killing for convenience. Innocent life is given the benefit of the doubt. You can't ki\1 the child until you're sure without a doubt that he is not a child or not alive." 
Rice then compared the abortion movement to the Nazi extermination of the Jews. 
"This is the basic principle underlying the Nazi extermina­tions. We are moving into an era of compulsory abortion and compulsory killing. If you don't believe me, you're kidding yourself. We've just gotta stop it. If you can kill a child for being too young or too deformed, you can kill someone for being too old, too poor, too stupid, too black, too radical. You know three years from now, you'll be reading about some old terminally ill man screaming to the doctor to kill him, to relieve his misery. Yes, that's where we're headed," he stated. 
After explaining the four methods of abortion, Rice began speaking of the ties between abortion and welfare. "It's very difficult to get people excited 
::~bout  abortion  because  too  
many  deep  inside  themselves  
think  that  abortion  is  the  

solution to the problems of welfare and poverty in this country, but they're not. It's still murder," he commented.

tions should merge with the clear expect­ation however that some departments, beca~se of pec~liar circumstances or per­sonnel will not move to the unified organization immediately. 
As departments join together, specific provisions for safeguarding rights of facul­ty members in each institution should be insured. As a general rule, joint depart­ments should be represented by faculty from each institution, proportionate to the undergraduate enrollment in the sub­jects normally taught under the auspices of that department. This proportion is suggested as a possible model which may prove inadequate when tested empirical­ly; but there should be some such general principal which will insure that neither institution gain an untoward numerical domination in a joint department. For fields in joint departments not combin­ing, each institution must be insured the right to maintain an adequate indigenous program. Thus there could be for exam­ple a combined Biology Department which would offer some things in com­mon but which would also offer distinct­ly different biological science programs 
on the two campuses. Both combined and 
discrete departments should also be en­
couraged by the coordinator to create 
new experimental programs which could 
be utilized by the students in both Notre 
Dame and St. Mary's. Whether specific 
departments are merged eventually or 
not we recommend that each department 
sho~ld invite a member of the corres­
ponding department in the other institu­
tion to be a voting member of the 
department as soon as possible. 
The coordinator will need to spend 
considerable effort to monitor program 
development, staffing policy, and the 
like for both joint and discrete depart­
me~ts, with the clear understanding that 
he may use his access to the Presidents to 
resolve controversy. 
The success or failure of joining St. 
Mary's Cbllege to the University of Notre 
Dame ultimately will depend on the 
goodwill, the mutual respect, .and the 
shared values of men and women on the 
two campuses. However, that agreement 
can be powerfully reinforced by a num­
ber of stipulations, agreements, and self­
denials which are suggested here for 
action by appropriate authorities: 
1. 
As a general rule, faculty and staff at each of the two institutions should have their statuses preserved once the union of their activities has been accomplished. This means that tenure will be recognized as well as service leading toward tenure. Also, as a general rule, salary, tenure provisions and the like should become comparable, with one major exception: faculty members who concentrate their efforts as undergraduate teachers should not be expected to compare for tenure or salary purposes with professors who con­duct research and direct graduate stu­dents as well as teaching undergraduates. Here a pluralistic reward system may be required for a time . 

2. 
St. Mary's now employs a propor­tion of men on its faculty. We urge on Notre Dame that women be appointed to that faculty with a view to providing at both institutions a group of distinguished women professors. 

3. 
Academic degrees will be awarded by the institutions in which students matriculate. Thus a student who matricu­lates at St. Mary's would receive a degree in the name of St. Mary's College in the University of Notre Dame, which would be signed by the President of Notre Dame. However, students would be enti­tled to take majors offered by either institution, though obligated to complete the degree requirements of the institution in which they matriculate. Thus a student at St. Mary's following the course of study prescribed by the University of Notre Dame for a degree in Architecture, could receive a Bachelor's degree in Ar­chitecture from St. Mary's College in Notre Dame. Similarly, a Notre Dame student concentrating in Elementary Edu­

Just one week ago this desk produced a column commenting on the progress of the Notre Dame basketball squad up to that point. Some felt that the criticism of the Irish was deserved and possibly not really as cutting as it could have been. Others disagreed. They felt that ND was playing as well as could be expected given all of the circumstances present (e.g., schedule, long vacation, etc.). 
Since then a few things have changed. ND whipped "the nation's best" by a decisive margin and then they resembled champions themselves when they blew a respectable MSU quintet off the floor in the second half Tuesday night at the Convo. 
That brings Notre Dame to its present situation. The record is an impressive (though not perfect, by any means) 10-4. The Irish must travel to Chicago Stadium tomorrow night for a match-up with one of the strongest teams in the Big Ten. The Irish have had a history of poor showings in the Windy City (e.g., Illinois two years ago, Northwestern this past December), but this is certainly not a game where a letdown can occur. If the Irish can get by the Illini they will have a full week away from the grind to nurse any minor aches and to unwind a little from the pressure of the past week. 
A victory here is a key factor in determining if or where the Irish could get an NCAA Tournament bid. Say ND whips Illinois and the Illini go on to have a successful season in the Big Ten. Now the NCAA selection committee would have to think twice before bumping the Irish to the Midwest Regional rather than permitting them to remain in the Mideast. 
Johnny Dee would probably say that this is a lot of conclusion jumping, that his team may hit a sour streak and only win half of their remaining games, that Notre Dame may not even get a bid. 
This writer just can't see that happening. Of the remaining II games after Saturday, only five could truly be considered tough. These are Creighton, Villanova, Fordham, St. John's and Dayton. A twenty-win season (the Irish must take 10 of 12) should almost guarantee a bid to the national tourney. An undefeated finish from this point would put ND on the road to Houston via Columbus. 
Before thinking of Houston, Columbus or even Villanova in The Palestra everyone should turn their attention to Chitown tomorrow night. This is a game of increasingly large proportions. The Irish are aware of this. The last few times they were aware that a game had great importance the results were devastating. A similar performance in Chicago will do nothing to hurt Notre Dame's chances for post-season activity.

Flood wonts to be free 
NEW YORK (UPI) -The U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals teserved decision on baseball's reserve clause Wednesday after arguments over Curt Flood's suit to overturn the clause were heard for 90 minutes. 
Presiding Judge Sterrs R. Wat­erman, sitting with judges Leon­ard P. Moore and Wilfred Fein­berg, listened to arguments by both sides and then announced: "We will reserve a decision on the reserve clause." 
The three judges were listen­ing to an appeal of the decision handed down Sept. 12 by judge Irving Ben Cooper in favor of baseball. 
Flood, who is represented by former U.S. Supreme Court Jus­tice and Ambassador to the United Nations Arthur Gold­berg, began the suit shortly after he was traded by the S. Louis Cardinals to the Philadelphia Phillies in late 1969. Flood asked Baseball Commissioner Bowie Kuhn to be released from the provisions of the reserve clause so he could negotiate with other clubs but permission was denied. 
Flood, who sat out the 1970 season, has since been traded to the Washington Senators and has signed a contract estimated at $110,000 to play with them in 1971. Both sides agreed Wednes­day that Flood's decision to play this year will not prejudice his case in the appeal of Cooper'~
