Saint Mary's to perform its own 1 Monologues' 
Students, faculty create alternative play

In tlw spirit or Eve Ensler's award-winning and contro­vnrsial play The Vagina Monologuns, membors or the Saint Mary's eommunity will join together in presenting tho SMC Monologuos Saturday at 7 p.m. and Sunday at 2 p.m. in Carroll Auditorium. The Campus Allianee for Rape Elimination (CAHE), along with Feminists United and the Sexual Identity and Diversity CoLT, is sponsoring this innovative evont in an effort to spread awarnnoss regarding the issuo of violence against women, CAHE president (;inger Franeis said. 
Francis, a junior, wanted to bring tho message behind Ensler's Monologues "closer to home." 
"We wanted to bring the production home to hear our community and see how women feel on this campus," she said. "It helps show that violence against women is not only real in our world, but it's happening around us. This is real in our eommunity." 
The community, however, has not always been so recep­tive. In previous years Saint Mary's has joined thousands of other organizations to take part in the annual V-day cele­bration. When an official per­formance of The Vagina Monologues in 2000 caused an overwhelmingly negative response from not only the immediate campus communi­ty but also such groups as the Board or Trustees, Parents' Council and alumnae, the stu­dents took it underground by hosting unofficial readings

count to be more than 300,000. 
Yet the origin of the situation is not l()(~ated with any spcd!ic eth­nic group, but with the Sahara Desert, which began to encroach on Northern Darfur, making water scarcer and increasing inherent tensions between ethni­cally Arab nomadic herders and African farmers. 
As precious resources became harder to lind, camel-and horse­riding Arab marauders began to raid African farming communi­ties, stealing crops and cattle, according to the international watchdog organization Human Hights Watch. Despite com­plaints to political leaders, the black African Darfurians felt the Arab-dominated Khartoum gov­ernment was deaf to their con­cerns. 
According to Hobert Dowd, C.S.C., a political science prof(Js­sor and Africa specialist, ten­sions gradually became height­ened as "black African groups in the Darfur region began to feel that they were being discrimi­nated against and neglected by the government in Khartoum." 
Some of these African Darfurians formed self-defense groups in the 1990s to defend against the Arab bandits, which gradually formed into two largn rnbel groups. 
"These movements began to attack government installations in the arna," Dowd said. 
The groups' ultimate aim was to end the economic marginal­ization of African Sudanese and to gain some Afriean self-govnr­nam~e in Darfur. Not surprisingly. the Sudanese govnrnmnnt grow anxious at the hostility or tlwse groups and in 2003, an armed conflict began between thmn and government forces.

INSIDE COLUMN 

A bittersweet day 
Today my term of the best student job at Notre Dame comes to an end. 
Many students do not have the same definition as me -working at lea..<;t 30 hours every week, giving up a lot of your social life and put­ting everything else second to your job. 
It's hard to explain to people when you talk about leaving the office as the sun rises, breakfast cooks in South Dining Hall or your 
L__:M:___a_t__..tL..-L-oz_a_r___, roommate awakens while you crawl into bed. 
But ask the per-Editor in Chief son taking over for me, and she'll agree. Ask the Editors in Chief from the past 38 years, and you'll get the same thing. 
There's something about this job that makes it all worth it. 
Racking my brain for the past couple of weeks to figure what it is, I've come to a conclusion. 
It's the people down here in the base­ment of South Dining Hall with me. 
I'll always remember the way the staff came together for the Notre Dame presi­dential change, a U.S. Presidential elec­tion and Notre Dame football coaching change. 
The way the news and sports staffs sucked it up to turn what could have been three stories into eight-page special sections. 
Three events that resulted in leaving the office past 5 a.m. after a 15-hour day. Three events worth every minute of that hard work. 
Three events that couldn't have been covered so well without my hard-work­ing staff. 
I'm not just paying lip service by say­ing that. 
I can honestly say without them, espe­cially Meghanne and Joe, the coverage of those events wouldn't have been as good. We couldn't have gone as in-depth or as broad with our stories covering those monumental events. 
But it's not the professional relation­ships that make thi'i place what it is, it's the personal ones. When you work from 7 p.m. to 3 a.m. with people, and do it all over again the next day, a bond develops. 
A bond that certainly won't be forgot­ten just because my name's not under­neath Editor in Chief anymore or because my four years underneath the Golden Dome have run out. 
So now I have two months to be a col­lege student. It starts on Thursday with a drive to Miami for a weeklong cruise in the Caribbean. 
It'll continue through the end of the semester with watching baseball· at the Eck and on my dish, frequenting the local watering holes during the week and maybe studying. (Okay, let's be hon­est, I'm a second semester senior). 
Finally it'll end with a Senior Week to remember and hopefully a picture-per­fect graduation weekend. 
Thanks Notre Dame, it's been one hell of a ride. And if you didn't like me, I at least did one thing right. The crossword was in the paper every day.

Blind man who bit dog charged 

EDINBURGH, Scotland ­A blind man who allegedly bit his guide dog has been charged with animal cruel­ty. 
David Todd is accused of sinking his teeth into the animal's head in a busy street, Scottish police said Thursday. 
A police spokesman said: "Any attack on a defense­less animal, particularly one trained to help people, is appalling." 
An eyewitness reported seeing the 34-year-old bite the dog and kick it repeat­edly at a shopping mall on Feb. 8, a spokeswoman for Lothian and Borders Police said. 
Officers arrested the sus­pect on Feb. 10 and charged him with animal cruelty and breach of the peace, the spokeswoman said. 
Police took the Labrador/retriever mix into protective care and handed it to the Guide Dogs for the Blind Association.

New ID system set for fall'05 
Special to the Observer 
In response to student requests, and prompted by eoneern about identity theft in higher edueation, Notre Dame will diseontinue using student Soeial Security num­bers (SSNs) as primary iden­tifiers as of .June of this year. 
SSNs will bo replaced by a now identifier, ealled "ndiD," whieh will be view­ablo online by students beginning with registration for the summer 2005 ses­sion. 
"The University is timing this important ehange with the implementation of new administrative software," University Registrar llarold Pace said. "The transition from SSNs to new ndiDs should be relatively pain­
less." 

Paee noted that, in most cases, the easy-to-remember NetiDs (used in eonjunetion with a seeret password to log onto the Notre Dame network) eould be used in lieu of nd!Ds when prompt­ed for a unique identifier by one of Notre Dame's online services. 
The ndiDs will appear on elass rosters and other internal student lists pro­d ueed by tho OITice of the Hegistrar during the sum­mer and fall sessions ol' 2005. 
Soeial Seeurity numbers still will be colleeted as part of the admission and finan­eial aid process, but will only be used to meet specific linaneial business needs and will no longer be used as a primary identifier or appear 
on printed lists within the University. 
Current students can determine their ndiD by viewing the numbor on the baek of their ID eard. abov1~ the bar code.

ment was also attempting to quell another, even longer-stand­ing uprising in Southern Sudan, they lacked the resources to fully engage on both fronts and accordingly hired and armed a large Arab militia force to com­bat the Darfurian rebel groups. These militias are known by Darfurians as Janjaweed -liter­ally, "those who attack on horse­back." 
Although the Sudanese gov­ernment has consistently main­tained that both its own soldiers and the Janjaweed militias have used exdusively to combat rebel troops, both the Janjaweed and the official Sudanese armed forces have specifically targeted black Darfurian civilians. sys­tematically destroying hundreds of villages, according to Human Rights Watch. Often, the Sudanese air force has attacked villages with bombs or machine guns, after which a joint force of Janjaweed and the Sudanese army kill the remaining Darfurians and raze the village. Moreover, Sudanese soldiers and Janjaweed militias have carried out a systematic campaign of rape throughout Darfur as part their ethnic cleansing. The ulti­mate goal of this killing and rape has been to eradicate the poten­tial population pool for the rebel groups that oppose the oppres­sive Khartoum government, Dowd said. 
"What we find happening in Darfur amounts to a final solu­tion in the eyes of the govern­ment in Khartoum," Dowd said. "The final solution is the elimi­nation of black Africans in the region." 
This final solution has been in large part effective, leaving hun­dreds of thousands dead and decimating Darfur's adult male population. Many of the women ity with suffering Darfurians and left behind without homes and to protest the atrocities taking husbands have borne children of place there.

Saint Mary's is the first stop on Dessables' American speaking tour of schools and churches. The College established a con­tact with Dessables when the justice education pro­gram held a Haiti immer­sion course during Fall Break 2003. Dessables said he felt very honored to receive the invitation to speak on campus. 
"The future of humanity lies in the hands of women," Dessables said. "I am very supportive of what women can do for a new real world." 
Dessables' visit is spon­sored by the Center for Women's InterCultural Leadership, Sisters of Nefertiti, Justice Education Program, InterCultural Studies Program, the department of religious studies, Anthropology Club, Residence Hall Association, Peacemakers and the NO Haiti Program. 
Justice education program director Jan Pilarski views the visit as a wonderful way to expose students to a cul­ture of people who have great hope and leadership despite the pain and strug­gle of their country. 
"Haiti is a place of real learning -it is a good way to live," she said. "They have a deep connection to spiritual life and a sophisti­cated understanding of world politics in relation to their daily lives." 
Haiti Awareness Week is another attempt to intro­duce students to other kinds of black history. With an inl1ux of Haitians coming to America, it is vital to under­stand their African and American roots, Pilarski said. 
Notre Dame will hold a public lecture at the Snite Museum on today at 3 p.m. about the vodou art exhibit on display. 
"Just looking at the art is not enough -you have to understand it too," Dessables said.

Bush challenges Russian leader 
Associated Press 

B HATISLAVA, Slovakia Struggling to repair troubled rela­tions, President Bush prodded Vladimir Putin on Thursday about Moscow's retreat from democracy but the Russian leader bluntly rejected the criticism and insisted there was no backsliding. 
"Strong countries are built by developing strong democracies," Bush said he told Putin. "I think Vladimir heard me loud and clear." 
"Hussia has made its choice in favor of democracy," the Russian leader replied. 
Confronting criticism that he is quashing dissent and consolidat­ing power, Putin said Russia chose democracy 14 years ago and "there can be no return to what we used to have before." 
Four years after Bush said he had gotten a sense of Putin's soul and found him trustworthy, the two leaders talked for 2 1/2 hours at a hilltop castle in hopes of eas­ing mounting distrust between Moscow and Washington. Bush said he had not changed his opin­ion of Putin and wanted to remain friends. 
"This is the kind of fellow who, when he says 'Yes,' he means yes, and when he says 'No,' he means no," Bush said. 
Yet Bush challengfld Putin about his government's bohavior, saying that democracies refloet a coun­try's customs and culture but must have "a rule of law and protection of minorities, a free press and a viable political opposition." lin said he talked with Putin about his "concerns about Hussia's commit­ment in fulfilling these universal principles"and about Putin's restrictions on the press. 
''I'm not the minister of propa­ganda," Putin said, standing alongside Bush at a news confer­ence.

With hopes of reuniting stu­dents and administration, this year's SMC Monologues will share nearly 30 readings sub­mitted anonymously by stu­dents, faeulty, staff and Sisters of the Holy Cross. So far, the responses are promis­ing, Francis said. 
"We were floored with the amount of responses," she said. "We have administration behind us and have heard nothing but positive feed­back." 
Students are not the only ones looking forward to the weekend. Catherine Pittman, associate professor of psy­chology and faeulty advisor to CAHE, said she is proud to be a part of this event. 
"I believe that the SMC Monologues are one of the most important events I have been involved with a:t Saint Mary's," she said. "It provides an opportunity for students to refleet on their experiences in nne of the most personal and sensitive realms of their lives: their sexuality." 
Other faculty members echoed Pittman's enthusiasm. 
Women's studies coordina­tor Astrid Henry gave the Monologues a full endorse­ment. 
"I enthusiastically support the SMC Monologues and their performances this week­end," said llenry. "Women telling their stories about their bodies and their sexuali­ties is the central mission of The Vagina Monologues, and I think the SMC Monologues eontinues that tradition while taking it in a new direction." 
With the first production only a day away, anticipation is mounting among both par­ticipants and the community as a whole. 
''I'm just really excited about how much more appli­cable this is to the Saint Mary's and Notre Dame com­munity," said junior partici­pant Marisa Sandahl. "I hope,

Young cellular phone users difficult to track 
Growing population poses problem for pollsters 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -They're mainly young, single and urban. They move frequently, usually renting rather than owning their homes. Pollsters call them "cell phone only" because they don't own traditional phones. 
As this hard-to-track popula­tion grows, so does the problem of accurately incorporating them into polling and scientific surveys that seek to measure everything from health and business practices to political attitudes. 
For now, the problem is most pressing in areas of research where the attitudes of young adults are sought, like surveys of radio listener preferences. 
Paul Lavrakas, a public opin­ion researcher at Nielsen Media Research, organized a meeting in New York City this month where pollsters and others involved in survey research dis­cussed ways to address the cell­phone-only issue. One major aim is to learn how to deal with this population before the next presidential election. 
"What the industry doesn't know how to do is how to statis­tically balance those reached by cell phones with those reached on land lines," said Lavrakas. 
The cell-phone-only popula­tion is growing fast. In 2001, it comprised about a half-percent of the population. Now it's esti­mated at 7 percent. Among people age 15 to 24, almost one in five have only cell phones, according to Clyde Tucker, a researcher at the Bureau of Labor Statistics. 
The industry has to deal with the cell phone issue while it's still manageable or it will be doing that research work when cell phones have become a problem for surveys -"and that's not a good practice," said Mike Brick, a statistician at Westat, which handles scientific surveys for the federal govern­ment. 
The cell-phone-only issue is just the latest challenge facing survey researchers. People have shown less willingness to talk to survey researchers, especially on the phone. Many polls are conducted on the tele­phone, the fastest and most effi­cient way to do a survey. But some surveys are done face to face. 
Raj Naik, a 26-year-old employee of a software compa­ny who lives in Rosslyn, Va., is a good example of the "cell phone only" crowd. 
l-Ie got rid of the traditional phone because most of the calls he received "were calls I didn't want to take." Naik said he wouldn't mind getting calls from survey researchers "if those calls aren't costing me anything, but as soon as some­one calls me on my cell phone, it's costing me something." 
That's part of the problem for pollsters: Cell phone users don't expect to get survey calls. When they do, many are uncoopera­tive. 
"People say, 'Do you know you're calling me on my cell phone?'" said Charlotte Steeb, a Georgia State researcher who has done experimental cell phone surveys. "Some people mentioned the privacy issue, saying, 'How did you get my number? I only give it out to family and friends.' Some just hang up immediately." 
Rob Stuart, a 23-year-old per­sonal trainer in Washington, said he doesn't see a need for a land line. 
"I might get one if I had a family or someone else living with me or if I was working out of my house," he said. 
Leading up to the 2004 presi­dential election there was con­cern polling would suffer because of difficulties reaching cell phone users. Surveyors accommodated for this by giv­ing extra weight to young adults, and the phone polls turned out to be generally accu­rate. 
'The industry dodged a bullet this time," said Scott Keeter of the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press.

Drugs tnay reduce AIDS cases 
New combination could prevent mother-child transmissions 
Associated Press 

BOSTON -Scientists fighting the ravages of AIDS in the Third World have shown con­vincingly that a short and rela­tively inexpensive combination of HIV drugs could reduce mother-to-baby transmission rates in Africa far more effec­tively than the single pill now used. 
But the cost of the drug com­binations could still be prohibi­tive in some of the most impov­erished parts of the world. 
Scientists have long been searching for an alternative to the AIDS drug now widely used in the Third World, nevirapine. Nevirapine is cheap and highly effective at preventing babies from contracting the AIDS virus from their mothers. But up to two-thirds of women become resistant to the drug. 
The drug combinations appear to have an extremely low rate of resistance, and offer a relatively inexpensive and easy-to-take alternative for many women. 
"This is very promising for low-income countries," said one of the researchers, Dr. Francois Dabis of Victor Segalen University in Bordeaux, France. 
However, the drug combina­tion would likely cost more than double the usual $8 for a single dose of nevirapine for mother and newborn. As it is now, some countries cannot even afford nevirapine. 
"It's important not to be rap­idly overoptimistic," said Dr. Mary Fowler, a U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention specialist in mother-to-baby HIV transmission. 'The trans­lation from trials to programs is incredibly challenging." 
The findings were presented in Boston on Thursday at the 12th Annual Retrovirus Conference, the world's chief scientific meeting on AIDS. 
In impoverished lands, nevi­rapine is widely given in single doses to infected pregnant women in labor and then to their newborns. 
In the United States, the com­plete three-drug HIV cocktail has cut mother-to-baby trans­mission rates to around 2 per­cent. But patients in the United States are given longer treat­ments, and drugs that are far more effective and expensive than those tested in Africa. 
The African studies -one in the Ivory Coast, one in Botswana -reduced rates at four to six weeks after birth to about 5 percent, the lowest ever recorded in Africa. Nevirapine in single doses typi­cally reduces that rate from around 35 percent to 12 per­cent. 
In the Ivory Coast study, French and African-based researchers used single-dose nevirapine in 329 women, but coupled it with two other com­mon AIDS drugs: AZT and 3TC, sold collectively as Combivir. The Combivir was given to the mothers during pregnancy and for three days after birth. The newborns were also given sin­gle-dose nevirapine and AZT. 
At 6 weeks of age, fewer than 5 percent of the newborns were infected. Drug resistance was also extraordinarily low in the mothers. Only 1 percent became resistant to nevirapine, and just 8 percent to 3TC. 
In the Botswana study of 1,179 births, mothers were given multi-week AZT alone, and in combination with single­dose nevirapine. 
The World Health Organization is expected to consider broadening its guide­lines soon in light of research on such new regimens. Its rec­ommendations now include single-dose nevirapine and an AZT-nevirapine regimen. 
"For a minimum additional cost, we may get many bene­fits,'' said Dr. James Mcintyre, an AIDS researcher in South Africa. 
However, several re­searchers cautioned that sin­gle-dose nevirapine will still be needed in many places. 
"It is essential to preserve single-dose nevirapine as an option when more complex regimens are unavailable," said Mark Isaac, vice president of policy at the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation in Washington. 
A separate arm of the Botswana study also gave a boost to advocates of breast feeding for HIV-infected women. Some babies were breast-fed and treated with AZT for six months, while oth­ers were given formula. More of the first group contracted HIV, as expected, since the virus can be passed through breast milk. However, the two groups had almost identical rates of HIV-free survival after 18 months. 
Doctors have long known that the AIDS virus can be transmitted through breast milk. But many are reluctant to discourage breast-feeding in the Third World, since formula feeding has been linked in the past to more baby illnesses and deaths from a variety of caus­es.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR 

I was intrigued to see that Wednesday World Trade Center structural engineer Leslie Robertson spoke on campm; and briefly addressed the World Trade Center collapses. However, I was extremely disappointed to find yet another vague and confusing explanation from him regarding the collapses. This comes on the heels of news that only nearly half of the Sept. 11 victims' remains have been identified due to insufficient DNA evidence. 
There is a growing concern among the general population that the explanation of what happened to the towers on Sept. 11 is glaringly insufficient. The shock of images of the towers collaps­ing is f:,>Tadually being replaced by skepticism about how this event could have happened. For example, how could lire pro­duced by jet fuel inside of the planes get hot enough to melt the steel inside the towers? Kevin Ryan, a site manager for a division of Underwriters Laboratories (the product compliance and testing company that certified the steel used in the World Trade Centers) was recently fired for voicing his concerns that while "experts" told us that the towers collapsed due to steel melting at 2000 degrees Fahrenheit, the World Trade Center steel was ASTM E119 certified, meaning it withstood temperatures of 2000 degrees Fahrenheit for several hours in testing. Evidence sug­gests that the weak and quick-burning fires in the World Trade Center only exposed the steel to 500 degrees Fahrenheit. If you are an endorser of FEMA's "Truss Theory," take into considera­tion that the report left out the presence of cross trusses, and the fact that the tower's inner cores were not stacked but a collection of columns. The core structure of the towers is ineonsistcnt with the "zipper theory" which purports to explain the rapid demise of

the towers. Observational evidence that shows concrete {notably already turned to dust before hitting the ground) fell at the same speed as the actual building is even more disturbing, taking into account that this implies that the towers encountered an inexpli­cable absence of resistance as they collapsed straight down, along the path of most resistance. 
This brings me back to the recent news story of the unidentifi­able remains of victims. A New York City firefighter put it best when he said, "You sifi through two 11 0-story office buildings, and you don't fmd a chair, you don't lind a desk, you don't find anything." Is this consistent with a collapse brought on by the force of a plane hitting the towers? Why do we still get the story that Building Seven was leveled because of internal !ires when so many other buildings have withstood more intense fires for so long? These few small observations are really just the tip of a massive iceberg being discovered by a surprisingly large part of the population genuinely confused and genuinely angry about the lack of legitimate inquiry into what really happened on Sept. 11. There is a movement occurring that is larger than a few cheesy flash videos. What I've quickly noted above in no way represents the main or even best arguments against the ollicial explanation. I'd encourage anyone curious to check out www.911truth.org.

Comments
Bush. Europn is eon­vinend that as best allins or worst nnnmies, Bush will not make serious nff'orts to ineludn thorn during his SIH:ond tnrm. 
On Monday in Brussels, a seemingly insignilkant series of small incidents spokn volunws on what type of arm's­length inclusivmwss Bush plans for 1\uropiHtns. As was usual during last yPar's Anwriean campaign appear­ances, tlw White llousn dietated the visual mnssagns plaeed on the stage hackd rops, thn visual insignias on the podiums as well as tlw stage place­mont of podiums, c·hairs and !'lags. Bush set a tone that the U.S. was the eight-hundrnd pound nlnphant in the room and had no intention of' chang­ing. 
In anotlwr effort to avoid difficult questions during tho president's so­callnd campaign town hall meetings last year, thn White House wont to the extrnnw niTort to hand-pick tho entire audinneo l'or Bush's major speeel1. It was anothnr sign that the next l'our ynars will not change mueh. Europeans loudly heard that while Bush speaks of improving relation­ships abroad, he will absolutnly not participate with those whom he most needs to engage, namely his policy opponents. 
Most importantly, though, to better control the content and message thai appeared in the United States, the White House insisted on two separate press ol'ferings during Bush's photo opportunity opposite French President Chirac -the first for foreign press, followed by a session for American reporters. To further manipulate the subliminal visual message for the American audience, the White llouse dared to alter the stage between press sessions. 
Initially, the stage held a blue and white backdrop with the words "Belgium Brussels" centered behind . two chairs. Four llags adorned the stage. Two llags sat at each side of the backdrop about two feet apart behind eaeh president so that both l'lags, one French and one American flag, appeared over the shoulder behind each president in television dose-up shots. During the first foreign press session, European broadcasts and the CNN European web site dearly showed a French flag behind Bush. 
However, at the following American session, White House staff moved the French !lag behind Bush so that it was almost totally obscured in the framed dose-up head shots broadcast in the United States The blatant reposition­ing made the French flag's white and red portions appear to be just another stripe within the American flag. Thn White House successfully portrayed "God Bless America and its freedom 
fries" back homo. 
Diplomacy is a vital element of world and American security. Yet Bush's handlers have successfully por­trayed "Old Europe" as weak and out of step. This president continues to play to the testosterone element of American society by stubbornly refus­ing to mend harsh feelings and admit that Europe has value in the world. What harm would it have been for our president to proudly display a French and American l'lag behind him as a visual reassurance to the world that he truly does want harmony with our traditional allies? 
While most Americans accept Bush's three changing nxeuses for invading Iraq -"weapons of mass destruc­tion," "better to l'ight there than here" and "Saddam was bad and Iraq is bet­ter off now" -Europeans do not hold the same Texas definition of diploma­cy. They wonder why, for example, the United States does not simply invade Cuba, just 90 miles from our coast, because "Castro is bad and Cuba would be better off." 
Europeans know that Americans give their president a pass because of the World Trade Center attacks, yet French papers proelaimed that they were all Americans as well after the attack. They are upset that this week's visit exuded a tone that Europe should get over it, that Bush would do it again without them again if he so desires. Diplomacy Texas style is root­ed in the 2000 Amnrican eleetion. 
Like it or not, Bush took his 5:17-votn win in Florida as a mandate to govnrn without looking back. While sonw say the margin was only one vote, cour­tesy of the Supreme Court, the l'aet remains that Bush's handlers havn charged forward as though they had a Nixon or Heagan landslide. Although Bush barely garnnred 52 percent of the vote in 2004 with only one morn state in his win column, his handlnrs march at thoir usual znal. 
It is ironic that most of Bush's agen­da may not have succeeded if' not for our sense of' fear and rnvenge emanat­ing from the attacks of Sept. 11. Americans have given Bush a blank cheek to fight terror, even in a benign Iraq over radical Iran or Syria. Europeans know that despite Bush's claim that dil'f'ernneos regarding Iraq should be left in the past, they know Bush will proceed with or without them. That is the type of' diplomacy Europe may cope with for now, but will continue to doubt.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR 
Darfur a call to action 
Aftnr attending the Darfur symposium on Wednesday I was appalled by the atroei­tins that are being committed on a daily basis in Sudan. But what really angered me was tlw continued inaction on the part of the United States and the rest of the inter­national community on this issue. President Bush spoke in his Inaugural Address about spnHtding frnedom and liberty throughout the world. 
If ever there was a time to give these words some concrete meaning, the time is now. The pnople of Darfur are becoming the victims of a systematic campaign of dis­plaennwnt, rape and murder by the Janjaweed militias that are supported by the Sudanese government. President Bush should be praised for labeling the atrocities in the Sudan as genocide, but because we refuse to act to put any kind of force bnhind our rhetoric, the genocide continues. 
i\s a rnsult of the continued inaction on the part of our government and the inter­national community, we arn allowing 10,000 Darfurians to be killfld on a monthly basis. In this day and age after we have witnessed the horrors of Armenia, the 
EDITORIAL CARTOON 
Holocaust and Rwanda, atrocities like this should be unacceptable. Despitn the hor­rific events that have already occurred, there is still an opportunity for Amerkans to raise ourselves to the challenge and bring a peaceful settlement to the situation in the Sudan. 
We must all speak out as Americans, as Catholics, as supporters of f'nledom and justice, as Republicans and as Democrats, as people of good will; we must speak with one voice and demand aetion on behalf of the Da.rfurians who are in dire need of our assistance.

The 2005 Oscar race has been one of the closest in recent history. At first it seemed 'The Aviator" was the clear front-runner. Since then, the tables have turned somewhat, as the dark horse candidate "Million Dollar Baby" has started to overpower the Miramax machine. I've gone back and forth several times in several cat-Brian Doxtader 
egories despite going 37 for 39 ________ last year, where nearly all of the Scene Columnist 
winners were foregone conclu­sions. Expect this to be one of the most exciting and hotly debated Academy Awards in recent history Best Picture 
What will win: "The Aviator" 

Why it will win: Martin Scorsese's grand biopie of mogul Howard Hughes may not be the obvious fron­trunner, but it will still likely win the Oscar for a vari­ety of reasons. It won the Best Picture (Drama) Golden Globe and leads the Oscar pack with 11 nominations, which is often a good sign. No Scorsese film has ever been named Best Picture (this includes such past revered nominees as "Taxi Driver" and "Raging Bull"), so the Academy will take that into consideration. Finally, it has the overpowering Miramax machine 
behind it, which is both a good thing and a bad thing, since it tends to smother Academy voters. It's possi­ble that "Million Dollar Baby" will overcome its dark horse status and win over Oscar voters, but the last time that a true dark horse won was back in 1981, when the Oscar went to "Chariots of Fire." As for "Sideways," it's started to fall out of favor, with A.O. Scott from The New York Times declaring it the most overrated film of the year. 
What should win: "Million Dollar Baby" 
Why it should win: This was a really, really difticult call. On one hand, three of the five best picture nomi­nees are phenomenal films ("Million Dollar Baby," "Sideways," 'The Aviator"). On the other, none are quite so affecting and emo­tionally charged as "Million Dollar Baby." Eastwood has crafted a remarkable film that is nearly on par with his previous Best Picture winner, "Unforgiven." This 
is probably the best picture of the nominees. 
Best Director Who will win: Clint Eastwood ("Million Dollar Baby") Why he will win: In 1976, Martin Scorsese failed to 
receive a nomination for 'Taxi Driver," his first Best Picture nominee. The Oscar that year went to John G. Avildsen, who won for "Rocky," written by first-time actor-turned-writer Sylvester Stallone. In 1980, Martin Seorsese received a nomination for "Raging Bull" and lost to first-time actor-turned-director Robert Redford for "Ordinary People." In 1990, Martin Scorsese received a nomination for "Goodfellas" and lost to first-time actor-turned-director Kevin Costner for "Dances with Wolves." It would only be fitting if Scorsese loses this year to actor-turned-director Clint Eastwood (who has previously won the directing award for "Unforgiven"). This is not to detract from the considerable talents of Eastwood, who directed "Million Dollar Baby" with a rare power and under­statement almost completely missing in contemporary Hollywood. Besides which, the Academy tends to favor directors who work well with actors, and Eastwood evoked powerful performances from not only Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman, but also delivered remarkably himself. 
Who should win: Martin Scorsese ("The Aviator") 
Why he should win: No Scorsese film has ever won the Best Picture Oscar. This includes such venerable American classics as 'Taxi Driver," "Raging Bull" and "Goodfellas," all of which lost to inferior films. The director has proven his mettle time and time again and continues to make solid movies to this day, even after his film school brat contemporaries (Lucas, Coppola, DePalma) have dipped into substandard film­making. This could and should be his year, and the Academy may try to reconcile retrospective injustice by awarding Scorsese the long-deserved Best Director award. Although his work on 'The Aviator" is slightly more craftsman-like than in previous films, he remains a technical master and manages to bring an indelibility to "The Aviator," as he has with nearly all of his previous work. Best Actor 



Who will win: Jamie Foxx ("Ray") 
Why he will win: If there is one thing the Academy loves more than actors playing real-life historical fig­ures, it's actors playing characters with disabilities. Jamie Foxx has the best of both worlds here -not only does he play Ray Charles impeccably (down to the iate great singer's quirks and blindness), but he also inhabits that Oscar-loved category of the comedic actor breaking into serious roles (Tom Hanks in "Philadelphia," Robin Williams in "Good Will Hunting"). Beyond even that, Foxx has been nominat­ed in both the Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor award for two different roles (only the second actor to ever do so, after /\1 Pacino's 1992 double-nomination for "Scent of a Woman" and "Glengarry Glen Ross," respectively). Additionally, the surprise nomination of Ray in the Best Picture category will help bring more attention to Foxx's performance. This race is all but over. 
Who should win: Leonardo DiCaprio ("The Aviator") 
Why he should win: This was a surprise nomina­tion, but a welcome one. DiCaprio doesn't look a thing like Howard Hughes, but he, like Jamie Foxx, gets to play a real-life figure with a disability. DiCaprio wisely concentrates on thn roguish freewheeling spirit that made Hughes sueh a fascinating person. lie is also a good actor, which he has proven in a variety of roles, from "What's Eating Gilbert Grape?" (for which he received a nomination) to "Catch Me If You Can." lie may have finally overcome his "pretty boy" status, as Johnny Depp and Brad Pitt had to do, by carefully choosing roles. His performance in "The Aviator" finally solidifies the arrival of a new DiCaprio ­DiCaprio the actor rather than DiCaprio the teen idol. While he will likely eventually win an award (as Johnny Depp will no doubt eventually win), it may come too late, as that notorious sympathy award rewarding actors for superior previous work (AI Pacino for "Scent of a Woman," Paul Newman for 'The Color of Money," John Wayne for "True Grit"). Instead of going through all that trouble later, why not give him the award now, when he truly deserves it? Best Actress 
Who will win: Hilary Swank ("Million Dollar Baby") 
Why she will win: Swank returns five years after her first Oscar win (for "Boys Don't Cry') with a true knockout performance. If there's one thing that Eastwood knows how to do, it's direct actors. Gene Hackman won the Oscar for "Unforgiven," Tim Robbins and Sean Penn both won Oscars for "Mystic River." But it's Swank herself who modulates her per­formance into one that is multi-layered and surprising -demonstrating a dramatic mettle the Academy will certainly notice. Plus, there is a certain irony here ­the last time she was nominated was five years ago, when she beat Annette Bening (for American Beauty) in a two-horse race. Bening received a nomination this year for Being Julia, her first nomination since American Beauty. 
Who should win: Kate Winslet (Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind) 
Why she should win: Eternal Sunshine may be the most woefully under-appreciated film of the year, but the Academy wasn't foolish enough to bypass Winslet's pitch-perfect performance. In the nine years since her first nomination (for Ang Lee's Sense and Sensibility), she has consistently proven her dramatic worth. That being said, this is hands-down her best performance. Winslet inhabits Clementine beautifully, balancing quirkiness with sensitivity and a touch of graceful pathos. While she likely won't win this year, it really is a shame, because her portrayal may be the most memorable performance of the year. Best Supporting Actor 
Who will win: Thomas Haden Church (Sideways) 
Why he will win: This is a really tough field to call. All of these actors gave solid performances and no sin­gle actor sticks out. That being said, Giamatti's Best

Who should win: Charlie Kaufman, Miehnl Gondry, and Pinrrn Bismuth 0\tnrnal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind) 
Why they should win: This is tho best screenplay of' tho ynar -it is witty, funny, sad, romantic and emo­tional without bning overly sentimental. The screen­play is a truo triumph in ingenuity and the sort of postmodern romancn story that tnnds to polarizn its audioneo. The best scroenplay award has somehow oludod Kaufman. whose previous work (Being John Malkovkh, i\daptation) was some of the best, most dnvnr stuff written since Pulp Fiction. While this sneenplay enrtainly has a chance of winning, i\1:admny votors first have to overlook Tho i\viator as wt~ll as Htnrnal Sunshine's own gnneral quirkiness. This is a w~nuine, beautifully written sercnnplay. Best Adapted Screenplay 
Who will win: Alexander Payne and Jim Taylor (Sidowaysl 
Why they will win: One of the best-reviewed films of the ymtr succeeded on two main elnments: thn per­formances and the script. Payne's road-trip/buddy­movie transcends its origins preeisely because tho script is so well written. The Aeademy will not over­look this film, especially if it fails to win the Best Picture -the Bnst Screonplay award will be some­thing of a runner-up prize for Sideways. 
Who should win: Rkhard Linklater, Ethan Hawke, Julie Dolpy and Kim Krizan (Before Sunset) 
Why they should win: This is a bnautif'ully written film (by the diroetor and the two stars from charaeters croatnd by Linklater and Kim Krizan) and one of the best screenplays of the year. As a philosophically tinged examination of' love and relationships, Bnfore Sunset is the kind of sensitively written, minimalist film that draws the viewer into the lives of' its charac­tnrs. Thn dialogue flows easily betwoen the two ehar­aeters as a kind of naturalistie duet that forms a framework into whieh tho bigger themes of the film are woven. It is likely it won't boat Sideways, but it probably dnserves to -Linklator, Hawke and Delpy havo written a wondorful script. 
Oscar Oversights 

It was innvitablo that thoro would bo some oversight in tho nominations, as happnns every year. This yoar's nominations are even more glaring than usual, as entirn films were completely (or nnarly eompletely) ovnr­looknd. Some notable sins of omission: 
+Eternal Sunshine of tho Spotloss Mind was over­looked in sovcral cate­gories, including Bnst Pieture. Best Dirnetor (Miehnl Gondry) and Best i\etor (Jim Carrny, who still has never r·nenived an Oscar nomination). 
+The Passion of the Christ and Farenheit 9/11, both strongly ideological and controversial films, rncnivnd no major nomina­tions. Michael Moore's lob­bying for a Best Picture nomination (and thus sacri­ficing Best. Documentary eligibility) baekfin~d. while Mel Gibson's general disin­terest in the Oscars (he's already won Best Picture and Best Director for Braveheart) and llollywood's nogative recep­tion to the lilm likely hurt its chances. 
+Paul Giamatti, once thought to be a possible frontrunner in the Best i\ctor raeo, was not even nominated for Sideways. 
+Julie Delpy was woel'ully overlooked for her per­formance in Before Sunset. 
+The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou, Wes Anderson's quirky film starring Bill Murray, failed to receive any nominations. 
+The Motorcyele Diaries did not receive a Best Foreign Language Film nomination. +Mark Wahlberg. was overlooked f'or his quirky role in I Heart lluckabecs. 
+Zach Brall"s debut Garden State (whieh he wrote, directed and starred in) received no nominations. The most notable oversight was in the Best Original Scrnenplay eategory. 
+Liam Neeson was not nominated for Kinsey. +.Jude Law rnceived no nominations, despite acting in six films this year. 
+Kill Bill Volume 2 received no nominations, possi­bly duo to the confusion over the film's split into two parts, one released in 2003 and one released in early 2004. This film had potential to be nominated in sev­eral categories, induding Best Picture, Best Director (Quentin Tarantino), Best Actress (Uma Thurman), Bnst i\ctor (David Carradine) and Best Original Screenplay (Quentin Tarantino).

Chicago's Iguchi adjusting to the major leagues 
Associated Press 

TUCSON, Ariz. -Tadahito Iguchi's body clock is a bit out of whack, so when he hit a home run on his second day of spring training, it was a rather remark­able accomplishment. 
Yeah, sure it was just batting practice, but he's still trying to shake off jet lag after arriving at the Chicago White Sox spring camp two days ago. 
"Not bad for 3 o'clock in the morning," White Sox general manager Ken Williams said Thursday. 
"Yesterday was a little strange. l didn't sleep well," Iguchi said through an inter­preter. 
Iguchi's homer off veteran reliever Cliff Politte will surely be big news back home where there is a 15-hour time differ­ence. 
!lis every move is being moni­tored by about two dozen Japanese journalists and cam­eramen. Every ground ball he tields in practice is charted. He has his own news conference in a yard next to the complex. 
His presence caused a much bigger stir than a year when ago when Japanese saves leader Shingo Takatsu joined the White Sox. 
Iguchi, signed to play second base, will make $2.3 million this year and $2.4 million in 2006. Chicago has a $3.25 million option for 2007 with a $250,000 buyout. 
Now he's working to adjust to just about everything. He had visited the United States about 10 times previously, including a trip to the 1996 Olympics where Japan won the silver medal in baseball. 
"Coming straight to the big leagues from Japan is different. I grew up in this game and went through every level," White Sox manager Ozzie Guillen said. 
"Today it is tougher. I don't think it's because of the lan­guage and the culture, but because they are in the spotlight right away," he said. "When you come from Japan and come straight to the big league level, you have something to prove. l think Shingo last year did a tremendous job and I'm expect­ing the same with Iguchi." 
Iguchi, 30, batted .333 with 24 homers and 89 RBls last season. He's won two stolen base titles, three Gold Glove awards and been an All-Star four times. 
In his eight-year Japanese career with the Fukuoka Daiei Hawks, Iguchi hit 149 homers and stole 159 bases to go with a .271 average. 
"Fortunate," he said of his homer off Politte. "Not really surprising, but I'm not a home run hitter. I just need to get hits." 
Takatsu struggled in spring training a year ago (6.75 ERA) but finally got untracked and then took the closer's job in mid­June. 
He was 6-4 with a 2.31 EHA in 19 saves and became such a popular figure at U.S. Cellular Field that the White Sox started playing a gong over the public address system when he was called into a game. 
Iguchi, expected to dislodge Willie Harris at second base, noted that major league pitching seems to have more movement than he's used to.

Palmeiro may sue Canseco for steroid use accusations 
Associated Press 

FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. ­The Baltimore Orioles' Rafael Palmeiro is leaving open the pos­sibility of filing a lawsuit against Jose Canseco, who said he intro­duced the first baseman to steroids in 1992 when both play­ers were with the Texas Hangers. 
Canseco cited Palmeiro as a steroid user in his new book. In an interview on the CBS television show "60 Minutes," Canseco said he injected the drug into Palmeiro. 
Palmeiro issued a statement last month in which he denied he ever used steroids, and he emphatically backed up that assertion Thursday after his first practice of spring training. Palmeiro also said he's consid­ered hiring the law frrm of Orioles owner Peter Angelos to take legal action against Canseco. 
"The one thing I can say is I have the best law firm and the best lawyer standing in the wings in Peter Angelos," he said. "I have options available for me. He stands behind me and he's ready. I will look at all my options and I'll decide." 
Palmeiro, 40, ranks among the greatest hitters in baseball histo­ry. The four-time All-Star has 551 career homers, 2,922 hits and a .289 batting average. 
He would prefer to focus on preparing for his 20th big league season, but the topic kept swing­ing back to steroids during an impromptu interview session in the Baltimore dugout at Fort Lauderdale Stadium. 
"I can't worry about those things. Along the way, there's always going to be someone say­ing something about you, whether it's true or not. You just go on," Palmeiro said. "My job right now is to get ready for baseball. My mind has to be here." 
Orioles manager Lee Mazzilli told Palmeiro that he has the full support of the team. 
"It's totally unfair because it's always hearsay," Mazzilli said. "I think in this country you're inno­cent until proven guilty. They don't have to defend themselves. If you feel good about yourself, you shouldn't worry about what people say." 
Palmeiro is at a loss in trying to fibrure out why Canseco chose to include him as one of several players that used steroids. 
"He and I grew up playing ball together in the Miami area, but we never did anything together other than play on the same team," Palmeiro said. "We went our separate ways after high school and I never saw him again until he was in the big leagues and I was in the minors. He and I have never been close friends or anything. We were teammates, but that's about it."

NCAA BASKETBALL 

Anderson leads Michigan St. past Wisconsin 
Associated Press 

EAST LANSING. Mich.-Alan Anderson got choked up -and it had nothing to do with earn­ing a spot in Michigan State's record books. 
Anderson didn't miss and scored a career-high 28 to lead the 1Oth-ranked Spartans to a 77-64 win over No. 20 Wisconsin on Thursday. 
He was 10-of-1 0 from the field and 7 -of-7 from the line, becoming the fourth Michigan State player to take at least 10 shots without missing. 
But the senior forward paused and stammered as he spoke after the game because the Spartans snapped a 12­game losing streak against ranked opponents and a six­game skid against Wisconsin. 
"It was our last chance against those guys," Anderson said. "This one was big, man. They took our home-winning streak from us. They took a couple of championships, too. That's why we were so emotion-
a.!" 

The Spartans (20-4, 11-2 Big Ten) have won 10 of 11 since losing to the Badgers on Jan. 16, winning their last nine by double digits. 
Those lopsided victories didn't quiet their critics because of the streak against ranked oppo­nents since the regional finals of the 2003 NCAA tournament. 
"I don't think I could be hap­pier for our players," Michigan State coach Tom lzzo said. "This has been hard o,n them. It wasn't like they conquered the world, but we beat a good team soundly." 
Wisconsin's Alando Tucker had 18 points, Mike Wilkinson scored 16 points and reserve Zach Morley added 11. 
The Badgers (17 -7, 8-5) have lost three of five, allowing Indiana to pull into a 
third-place tie in "/ don't think I comfortable." the Big Ten stand­Marquette (18-9,

ings. 6-8) had trouble
for our players."
"We don't like to finding shots with-say tl happens at out Diener run­Wisconsin, but Tom lzzo ning the show. they outworked Cincinnati is No. 2
Spartan coach 
us," Tucker said. 

The Spartans beat Wisconsin for the first time since Feb. 27, 2001 -thanks to Anderson. 
Anderson, whose previous career high was 18 points, scored 11 straight points early 
--in the first half. His one-man spurt gave Michigan State an 11-point lead, which it main­tained easily. "He did a great job of pene­trating and taking care of busi­ness around the basket," Wisconsin coach Bo Ryan said. "You name it, he did it." Anderson matched a field­goal percentage mark at Michigan State with three other players. Ron Charles made all 12 of his shots in a game in 1980 while Carlton Valentine ('86) and Bob Chapman ('77) both went 11-for-11. "I don't think I missed a shot in warmups," Anderson said. "I said, 'Man, this feels good."' Paul Davis had 13 points and 11 rebounds for the Spartans while Shannon Brown and Maurice Ager each had 11. Anderson gave the Spartans a big cushion by himself a couple minutes into the game. He scored all Michigan State's points during an 11-2 run, which gave the Spartans a 15-4 
lead with 13:53 left in the first half. "He got hot early and hit all the big shots," Tucker said. 
Michigan State led by as much as 14 before halftime and didn't let the Badgers get closer than eight after Anderson's scoring barrage. Anderson scored 15 points in the first half to help Michigan State take a 33-25lead. 
It didn't take long for the Spartans to earn a comfortable lead again. Offensive rebounds led to seven of their first eight points in the second half, giving them a 41-27 lead with 17:55 left. 
"Those [offensive rebounds] reminded me a little bit of our teams in the past," Izzo said. "Those are backbreakers." The Badgers didn't pull within single digits again until there was just over a minute left. No.24 Cincinnati 80 Marquette 68 
With Marquette missing its best player, all No. 24 Cincinnati had to do was let its two formidable power forwards take over the game. 
Eric Hicks and Jason Maxiell were up to it again. 
Hicks scored 17 points and Maxiell added 14 on Thursday, leading the Bearcats to a win in Marquette's first game without leading scorer Travis Diener, lost for the season with a bro­ken hand. 
Cincinnati (21-6, 9-4 Conference USA) got up by 28 points in the second half before coasting, one of the Bearcats' worst habits. Marquette hit some late 3s, cutting the lead to seven points in the final minute against Cincinnati's reserves. 
"We get passive," coach Bob Huggins said. "We come out and play really, really hard, then get a lead and get passive. We get comfort­able, and it's hard to play this game 
in the nation in 
forcing opponents 
to miss, holding them to 36.8 percent _ exactly what Marquette shot. 
Diener, one of the nation's top point guards, led the conference in scoring (19. 7 points per game) and assists (7 per game) when he broke his hand Tuesday during practice. He had surgery and will miss the rest of his senior season. 
Steve Novak led Marquette with 25 points, going 7-of-12 from behind the 3-point arc. Sophomore guard Dameon Mason took Diener's spot in the lineup and had 17. 
Diener was upbeat and smil­ing as he walked around the court during pregame warmups, slapping hands with teammates as they stretched on the floor. Huggins spotted Diener, walked over to him, shook his hand and warmly wrapped an arm around his shoulders. 
Huggins said something that made both of them laugh, then pumped his hand again before walking away to attend to his team. 
Then, the Golden Eagles found out just how much they're going to miss Diener. 
Marquette had won three of its last five games, showing signs of stabilizing. Without Diener, the Golden Eagles looked lost on offense. They couldn't get into a flow without the school's career 3-point leader on the floor. 
"When they called plays, I know a lot of people weren't in the right spots," Hicks said. "There was confusion at times. I could tell they missed not hav­ing Diener out there." 
Coach Tom Crean called a 30­second timeout after Cincinnati surged ahead 13-4 in the open­ing minutes. Diener walked pensively around the perimeter of the huddle, and a fan in the Cincinnati student section held up a sign that read: "No Diener No Chance." 
Crean thought his team missed Diener's leadership at the outset. 
"Probably, but that's not an excuse," Crean said. "We've got to learn to deal with it. We fig­ured it out in the second half." 
Cincinnati got open 3s over Marquette's zone, packed in to try to contain Maxiell and Hicks. Nick Williams made three of his first four shots from behind the arc, putting the 
Bearcats  in  control  early.  
Williams  finished  with  16  
points.  

Freshman walk-on guard Ryan Patzwald made a three and a jumper during an eight­point spurt, and Hicks made a turnaround jumper and three­point play that put the Bearcats up 38-21 at halftime. 
Marquette had only two assists in the first half, under­scoring how much it missed Diener. 
Hicks and Maxiell scored Cincinnati's first 10 points in the second half.

Lauren Connelly unleashes a serve during Notre Dame's 4-3 loss to North Carolina Feb. 20 at the Eck Tennis Pavillion. 
By ANN LOUGHERY Sports Writer 
Tlw No. 20 Irish an1 looking lo rndnnm thmnsnlves after two hoarthn1aking lossns to No. 5 llukn and No. I) North Carolina. 
Notre Dame (4-4) nearly pullnd off n pair of upsnts last wnekend. winning tho doubles points and holding early advan­t.agos hut ultimatdy falling 4-3 to both tnams. This weekend, eoaeh .Jay Louderback hopns tlw rnsults will bn just the oppo­sitn as the Irish take on No. 13 Toxas (6-0) on Saturday and No. 57 Iowa (4-2) on Sunday. 
"Last wenknnd, we just had trouhln linishing our matehes," l.oudorbaek said. "We can't let thnrn gnt into third sots like we 
did against Duke and North Carolina. This weekend is another opportunity for us to compete against a top team." 
Texas looks to be the most challenging opponent the Irish will face this weekend. Last year, Texas defeated Notre Dame 5-2, winning two of the throe doubles matches and four of the singles ma:tehes. The team returns many of its top players, ineluding No. 80 Kendra Strohm and the No. 26 doubles duo of Katie Buckert and Strohm. 
Freshman Courtney Zauft, ranked 97th in the nation. also joined the already impressive lineup. 
This year's match looks to be equally tough. Texas remains undefeated 
this season at 6-0 with a confer­ence record of 4-0. Last week­end. Texas took on Nebraska and Oklahoma State in a double header. The Longhorns were flawless in their matches, upending both teams 7-0. 
The llawkeyes look to be a tough chore as wnll. Although Notre Dame won last year 6-1, Iowa has fortified its roster since then, boasting rankings in both singlns and doubles. llillary Mintz is ranked at No. 78 singles and also at No. 59 doubles with teammatn Meg Haeette. 
Mintz and Hacntte each played an integral role in the team's 7-0 victories over Marquette and Bowling Groen last weekend. Louderback expects tho team will be just as competitive this weekend. 
"They kind of had a slow start. but they've boon playing real well in the last few meets," Louderback said. "They're very talented just like all of the teams on our schedule. We don't really have any off meets." 
Louderback added their rigor­ous and demanding schedule is what will propel them to a strong finish towards the end of the season when they face espe­dally tough competition in the NCM championships. 
"We've already got a solid doubles team," Louderbaek said. "And now we're focusing on singles. I think the more chances our kids have compet­ing this season, the stronger our singles will beeome." 
The Irish will take the courts against Texas on Saturday at 12 
p.m. and against Iowa on Sunday at 9 a.m.

FENCING 

Fencers pointing to national meet 
By ERIC RETTER Sports Writer 

Consider this wnnkend's event a transition t.ournanient. Notr11 Dame, who is No. 2 in tho women's poll and No. 4 in the men's, will play host to the Midwest Fencing Conf'nrenee Championships. Tho tourna­ment, though a postseason event, has no relnvanee to tho NCAA lim.Lis or regionals, the latter of which are next wonk­end. 
"It's our fi~st tryout for NCAAs. but tlw ConfernncH !tournament! is not the place to qualify," head eoaeh Janusz Bednarski said. 
With that in mind, the Irish are still approaching the event with the same goal as always -winning. 
"It's a prestigious event, and we want to be champion," Bednarski said. 
The Irish men will be led by senior epeeist Michal Sobieraj, who is still hunting for his lirst NCAA title. Sobieraj currently owns the men's single season record for wins, with 65 this year. 
"He's one of the most talent­ed fencers on our team," Bednarski said. 
The women will be led by their two defending NCAA champions, sophomore sabre Valerie Providenza and defend­ing three-time foil champion Alicja Kryczalo. Freshman Marie! Zagunis, the 2004 Olympic gold medalist, has also had a stmng snason and looks to continuo that suecnss this wnokend. 
The tournamnnt. marks Notn~ Danw's rnturn to action aftnr a two wonk layofl'. In that timn, tho tc~am has spnnt practicn time focusing on fundamentals and tndmique. 
"Wn havn rnturnnd to prae­tic.n to improvn tactical nln­ments that they lost. during t.hn bouting season," Bednarski said. 
Bodnarski was happy that his tmun got sonw time to prnparo itsnlf' for the f'inal push for a championship that begins in part this w11eknnd. 
"The two wooks wore very lwlpf'ul for us," he said, "they gave us pntdieo bef'orn rogion­als." 
Before tho off' stretch, the Irish had compnted for four eonseeutivo woPkonds in dual meeL<; where they saw at least onn top-1 0 tnam, ineluding No. 1 Ohio State in consecutive weekends. Perhaps thn most important part of this week­end's event is that they will onee again f'aen Ohio State bofore the NCAA tournament begins. 
"We have the opportunity to fence against tlw strongest team in our region before regionals," Bndnarski said. "It's the end of the season, and we nend to eheek how we stand on both sides !men's and women's!."

NBA 


Associated Press 

The weakest division in the NBA suddenly looks a little stronger, with Antoine Walker back on the Celtics and Chris Webber in Philadelphia. 
The NBA trade deadline came and went Thursday with a total of 11 deals involving 35 players being agreed to in the final 24 hours before the cutoff. 
Baron Davis was traded from New Orleans to Golden State for Speedy Claxton and Dale Davis, Keith Van Horn went from Milwaukee to Dallas for Calvin Booth and Alan Henderson, and Houston acquired several veterans to add to the league's old­est roster. 
Walker went to Boston in a four-player trade, with Gary Payton, Michael Stewart, Tom Gugliotta and a No. 1 pick going to Atlanta. 
Rodney Rogers and injured forward Jamal Mashburn were dealt from New Orleans to Philadelphia for Glenn Robinson, who has not played this season. It was the second trade in a span of less than 24 hours by 76ers general manager Billy King, who pulled off a blockbuster Wednesday night by acquiring Webber from the Sacramento Kings for forwards Corliss Williamson, Brian Skinner and Kenny Thomas. 
In other deals: 

+ 
San Antonio acquired center Nazr Mohammed and guard Jamison Brewer from New York for forward Malik Rose and two future No. 1 draft picks 

+ 
Cleveland acquired guard Jiri Welsch from Boston for a future No. 1 pick. 

+ 
New York acquired for­ward Maurice Taylor from Houston for guard Moochie Norris, forward Vin Baker and a second­round draft pick. 

+ 
Houston got guard Mike 


James and center Zendon Hamilton from Milwaukee for guard Reece Gaines and two future second­round picks. 
+ 
Golden State sent center Euduardo Najera to Denver, guard Luis Flores and a No. 1 pick to Denver for forward Nikoloz Tskitishvili and guard Rodney White. 

+ 
Charlotte dealt veteran Steve Smith to Miami for forward Malik Allen. 


Webber was on the tele­phone with former Michigan teammate Jalen Rose when Webber received a call from Kings coach Rick Adelman to inform him of the trade. 
IN BRIEF 
Woods coasts in match 
play championship 
CARLSBAD, Calif. -Two-time defending champion Tiger Woods won his 13th consecutive match at the rain-soaked Match Play Championship on Thursday. 
Woods coasted to a 4-and-3 victory over Nick Price, as nine of the top 10 seeds advanced to the second round. 
Top-seeded Vijay Singh beat Shingo Katayama 4 and 3, Phil Mickelson led by as many as four holes before dispatching short-hitting Loren Roberts 3 and 1, and Retief Goosen went the distance with Stephen Leaney, winning 1-up. 
Fifth-seeded Mike Weir was the only loser among the top 10, falling to Kirk Triplett 1-up. 
Sergio Garcia, the No. 6 seed, easi­ly beat Alex Cejka 4 and 2, but the remaining top 10 needed at least 18 holes to win. Seventh-ranked Padraig Harrington edged Jeff Maggert 1-up, and No. 9 Davis Love III beat Chris Riley by the same score. 
Cubs,Sosa,atodds 
MESA, Nev.-Chicago Cubs man· ager Dusty Baker and some of his players are disputing some com­ments Sammy Sosa made when he reported to the Baltimore Orioles' camp. 
At a news conference Wednesday, Sosa was asked about comments by Cubs players who said he and the team were better off following the Feb. 2 trade. Sosa apparently inter­preted that as the Cubs saying they didn't need him anymore. 
"They lie," Sosa was quoted as saying in several newspapers. The Cubs insisted Thursday that's not what they said or meant. 
"Did I say that?" asked Cubs pitch­er Kerry Wood. "I never did say it, so apparently somebody else lies. Not him. I'm not talking about him. I never said we were better without Sammy. I said I think both teams got better in the offseason not because we got rid of Sammy but because of some other moves we made. I don't have to justify myself. The comments I made, none of them were directed at Sammy. I did nothing but wish Sammy the best of luck, and I'll con­tinue to wish Sammy the best of luck." 
Gagne sprains ligament VERO BEACH, Fla. -Los Angeles Dodgers closer Eric Gagne sprained a ligament in his left knee Thursday during the team's first full-squad workout of spring training, and will undergo an MRI exam. 
Gagne didn't seem particularly concerned, but trainer Stan Johnston said the 29-year-old right-hander probably will have his activity limited for about a week. Johnston said the injury needs about six weeks to fully heal. 
"Any time you hurt something, it's usually going to take that long," Johnston said. "We want to do a pre­cautionary MRI to see what the dam­age is. It was hard to examine him because he was apprehensive at times."

ND WOMEN'S TRACK 

Irish runners to rest this vveekend 
By RYAN KIEFER Spons Writer 

Tlw Notre Dame women's track team will enjoy a well dnservod byo this wnokend. just six days ai'Wr finishing second at tlw Big East Indoor <:ham pi(mships. 
Tho Irish wnrc~ scheduled to travel to Boston to compete in tho USATF Championships, a national eham pionship-ealiber ovent f'naturing several prol'es­sional athletes. Instead. Notre Dame has chosen to keep all their athletes horne to rest. Coach Tim Connelly explained the Iogie behind the decision. 
"The girls competed real hard last week. The competition was intense, and it was a very long week -we left Wednesday night and didn't get back until Monday morning," Connelly said. "Arter a week like that. we rwed some time oJT to get every­one rested for NCAA's and let people catch up on work." 
CHUY BENITEZ/The Observer 

Connelly was pleased with his team's performance last week at the conference meet. Knowing that Pittsburgh was the prohibitive favorite, th'e Irish carne closer to the Panthers than Connelly figured they would. Junior Stephanie Madia's performance drew spe­cial recognition from Connelly. 
"She IMadial ran a great meet, running second in the mile and the 3,000, and run­ning strong in two relays," he said. "To run four races at that level was incredible." 
The only negative Connelly drew from the Big East meet was junior All-American Molly lluddle's foot injury. Huddle, running in her llrst meet of the season because of a foot injury she sustained in cross country, suffered an injury on a different bone in her foot. The injury is blamed on running before the previous ailment was healed, Connelly said, lamenting the decision to run Huddle last weekend. 
"It simply wasn't worth it," he said. "This will be a longer recovery period because we will be sure not to rush her back from this injury." 
The Irish will run next in the Alex Wilson Invitational at Lortus Center starting a week from today, which will be the final meet before the NCAA championships. 
"We'll bo running kids that are close to provisional times, and other athletes who have provisional times, but will be looking to move up in the rank­ings to assure themselves a spot in tho small but competitive NCAA field," he said.

MEN'S TENNIS 
Cavaliers pose challenge for Irish 

By RAMA GOTTUMUKKALA Sports Writer 
When facing the No.2 team in the nation on the road, any extra edge is always welcome. Luckily for the Notre Dame men's tennis team, Irish coach Bobby Bayliss knows the lay of the land on this road trip. 
No. 24 Notre Dame (10-2) will head to Richmond, Va. and take on No. 2 Virginia (8-1) on Sunday. Originally scheduled in Charlottesville, the match has been moved to the Country Club of Virginia -where Bayliss, who hails from Richmond, worked as the assistant tennis pro while in graduate school. 
"It's a big challenge but it's a great opportunity," Bayliss said. "It's going to be fun to play in front of a vocal and knowledge­able crowd at the Country Club. There're a great number of UVA alums who live in Richmond as well as some Notre Dame alums, so I think we'll have a good following." 
Notre Dame is coming off a 4­3 road victory against Michigan State last Tuesday that came down to the wire. On a four­match winning steak, the Irish will face a difficult test against a powerful Cavalier squad. 
"Their lineup is loaded from top to bottom," Bayliss said. "For example, their No. 6 play­er, Darrin Cohen, is ranked No. 36 in the United States among all college players. That gives you an idea of their depth. Their No. 1 player is ranked No. 7 in the nation. Straight on down, they have a very loaded lineup." 
Although the Irish have stayed close to home this spring, playing only two match­es on the road, Notre Dame is undefeated on the road thus far. Their last victory against Michigan State allowed the team to test its mettle in a pres­sure situation on the road. Although the team dropped the doubles point, they bounced back and pulled out the win. That experience should prove valuable this Sunday. 
"I think that anytime you're in a close match -like the one at Michigan State -and you're fortunate enough to win it, you grow a little into your confi­dence to handle tough situa­tions," Bayliss said. "I think that's going to benefit us as the year goes on." 
Virginia is coming off a domi­nant week of competition at the USTAIITA National Team Indoor Championship. Entering the competition as the No. 9 seed, the Cavaliers defeated three top-1 0 opponents to reach the final -No. 7 Stanford, No. 2 UCLA and No. 6 Mississippi. 
Although the Irish dropped their only match against a top­10 team this year-No. 9 Duke -they'll get another shot this weekend. 
"It's a big challenge but it's a great opportunity," Bayliss said. "We've had the best success lower in the lineup and I think any team we play -on paper -that's where we have the greatest chance of success. I think we have chances to do well but we're going to have to be pretty focused. 
We h.ave to play our best match of the year to have a chance to win."

MEN'S lACROSSE 
Penn State packs sharp bite 
By BOBBY GRIFFIN Sports Writer 
The Irish will kick off their 2005 season this Sunday when they visit Penn State, taking a No. 11 preseason ranking into University Park. 
The Irish, who have high expectations coming into the sea­son, don't expect their first game to be easy. Penn State and Notre Dame have played a series of close games in the past. 
"We expect a great game because ifyou look at the history of this game, it's usually a one or two goal [contest]," Irish coach Kevin Corrigan said. 
This year should be no differ­ent. Penn State will present Notre Dame with a tough game, as the Nittany Lions are ranked No. 18 in the country in the pre­season poll. 
Corrigan stressed the strengths of Penn State, focusing on the Nittany Lions' midfield and tran­sition game as key strengths that the Irish need to focus on. 
"They are very strong in the midfield, they got a lot of good midfielders, and they cause you a lot of problems there," Corrigan said. "That's something that we're going be concerned about, just keeping them out of the transition." 
Corrigan acknowledged the importance of executing in all facets of the game. For the open­ing game of the season, getting in rhythm is crucial. 
"It's the first game of the year and you can't get too caught up in your opponent," Corrigan said. "We don't like to do it at anytime, but we certainly want to make sure that for the first game of the year were concentrating on our own execution." 
Notre Dame has a lot of talent on their team coming into the season opener. 
The Irish are coming off an impressive 2004 season, when they finished 7-5 overall with a No. 12 overall ranking. 
In addition, the Irish retain six starters and 17 monogram win­ners from last year's team. 
While all of that looks good on paper, coach Corrigan does not feel that rankings matter much at this point.

ND tries to boil water at Purdue 
By MIKE TENNANT Sports Writer 

Several Irish swimmers will head to Purdue this weekend for the Boiler-Make-It Invitational. 
The meet is primarily an end-of the-year hurrah for a number of younger swimmers, head coach Bailey Weathers said. 
"For kids that didn't get to go to Big East, this is kind of their big meet," Weathers said. 
But the meet could also serve as a stepping stone for two swimmers in particular. Sophomore Jessica Stephens and freshman Caroline Johnson will both participate this weekend with the hopes of posting better times before the NCAA Championships approach March 17-19. 
"We're trying to see if we can improve their times in terms of getting them to the NCAA's," Weathers said. "We think they need to be a little faster." 
Both swimmers have already posted NCAA "B" cuts, meaning they will be consid­ered for the NCAA's, but only the faster "A" cuts are guar­anteed spots in the champi­onships. 
Stephens posted "B" cuts in the 200-yard individual med­ley and the 200 breaststroke, while Johnson posted "B" cuts in the 50-yard freestyle, the 100 backstroke and the 100 freestyle. 
Both swimmers had good 
meets  last  week  in  East  
Meadow,  N.Y.,  and  were  
named All-Big East.  

Stephens won the 200 back­stroke and was a member of the title-winning 400 medley relay team. Johnson did not take any individual titles, but was a member of all four of the Irish championship relay teams. She was the first or second swimmer in the 400­yard medley and the 200, 400 and 800-yard freestyle relay teams. The 800-yard freestyle team even set a school record last week. 
Also swimming in the meet will be a number of younger swimmers who did not get a chance to compete in East Meadow. 
Raine Paulson-Andrews, a freshman, is a member of the national swim team in her native Jamaica. 
She participated in the Pan American Games and achieved All-America status in the 50-yard freestyle as well as in the 200-and 400-yard freestyle relays. 
Sophomore Krissy Archer was a co-recipient of the Beeler-Hipp Award, presented to an outstanding freshmen in honor of Meghan Beeler and Colleen Hip, both of whom were killed their freshman year. Archer is primarily a sprint-freestyle swimmer. 
The meet will contain most­ly Big Ten schools.

Irish hit the road for opener against Ohio 
By MATT PUGLISI Spons Wrirer 
Finally, a chancn to wash out that. hittnr tastn. 
i\ftPr rattling ofT a program­record ton straight wins to kick ofT its 2004 campaign, Notre l>anw droppnd fivn of its last snvnn contnsts, including a first round NC;\;\ tournamnnt heart­lm~aknr to Northwnstnrn that saw the Irish squander loads of' 4-0 and 7-:{ in an nvnntual I 0-8 loss. 
Whiln plnasnd with a season that saw tlm Irish risn to No. 2 in l.lw national polls, the early exit loft mach Tracy Coyne and com­pany fooling thny could have achinvml oven morn. 
"Tiw NC;\;\ game Iagainst Northwostnrnl -we worn win­ning and thiHl madn some eostly mistakes at tlw nnd," Coyne said. "It was a great season. We felt proud of a lot of our aeeomplish­nwnts, hut l think we felt a little bit of dissatisfaction with our nnding." 
But aftnr setting Notre Damn rncords in goals (206) and point.'> 
(297) last year, the Irish may be hard pressed to replicate the ofl'nnse that fadlitatnd last sea­son's success. 
Gone are the squad's top three and li1ur of il'> top five seorers ­first loam All-i\meriean Meredith Simon, third tnarn All-American Abby Owen, Launm Fischnr and Kasson Delano -from a year ago. Together, thn five accounted liu· 128 of 206 (62 pnrecnt) Irish goals, with Simon's 46 tallies con­tributing to a Notre Dame single snason rneord 74 points. 
With a number of new faees on oll"nnsn this year, Coynn plans to alt1~r tlw team's approach to eom­plmmmt thn current squad's tal­nnl'>. 
"i\ny time you bring in new pnopln Inn ofl'nns(~l. you're going 
to .havn ..a ,dill'ernn~ lo2k t.o yo~r oflnnsn, Coyne smd. We ro tm­\oring some of our plays and things like that to what tho strcmgths of this team are." 
The dif'fnrnnl approach has worked well thus far, as thn Irish wrapped up a 3-0 prnsnason with a pair of victories last Saturday and Sunday over Dartmouth and Boston University, respectively. After taking care of Tnam Canada Feb. I l. the Irish knocked oil' the Big Gronn 7-6 in fi'igid Hanover, Nil before making the short trip to Boston, where Notre Dame topped the Black Bears 13-10 the following af'ternoon. 
"We played outside, and it was 25 degroes, and we played back to back Saturday and Sunday," Coyne said. "We had a lot of adversity we had to overcome, so l was pretty happy lwith the msultsl. 
"l think lthe prnsnasonl pointnd out things that arn going well and things that need to be improved. It accomplished what you want llhn preseason to aceomplishl­what you want to get out of it." 
Arter eight months, Notre Dame can take the first step in erasing the displeasure of last snason's abrupt finish when it travels to Athens, Ohio to open the 2005 season against Ohio University on Sunday afternoon at 1 p.m. 
The Irish beat the Bobcats, 13­8, last April at Moose Krause Stadium in their most recnnt meeting. 
"Last year they gave us a mally good game," Coyne said. "I think we've been a team on their schedule that they're looking to beat so we know that we have to go into that game ready to play an opponent that is going to give us a tough challenge." 
Part of that challenge wilt be shutting down Canadian national team member Dana Dobbie. 
"Dana is very good," Coyne said. "She's a tatt and dominating attacker, but they graduated a lot of players, so I think that they're going to be a ditlerent team, also. 
"We're going into it slightly blind, but we didn't know much about Dartmouth or Boston University, either, so I think we can go into the game and adjust accordingly as the game goes on."

Final three games crucial 
Irish reach last few tests with the ball, future in their court 
By PAT LEONARD A~sociare Sports Editor 

With three games to play in the regalar season, Notre Dame (16-8, 8-6 Big East) has its rate in its own hands. 
The Irish will finish their sehedule with three home games at the Joyce Center, a court that has been friendly to say the least to head coach Mike Brey and company this season. 
"llaving our home crowd at our back is a big advantage for us," Irish guard Colin Falls said. "We've been play­ing a lot better at home than we have on the road this year." 
Falls makes a slight under­statement. Notre Dame is 12­2 at home, losing only to DePaul and Syracuse, and 4-6 away from the JACC. 
"Since the Syracuse loss, obviously our biggest wins for our NCAA tournament resume have been on this court," Brey said. 
As of Monday, Notre Dame had played more games against teams in the top 50 of the Ratings Percentage Index (HPI) -than any team in the country with 11. After a March 5 date with Pittsburgh, that number should inernas1~ to 12. 
The HPI is a system that ranks programs in a somn­what similar mannHr to that of the college football BCS. 
"Whatever they throw us in the postseason, be it tho Big East tournament braek1~t and hopefully the NCAA tourna­ment, no one can look at nw and say, 'Boy, that's a tough draw,"' Bn~y said. "We've already had a tough draw." 
The tough draw dealt to Brey's squad called for seven road games in a I 0-gamn stretch, ending with an 88-74 loss to Connecticut Saturday. 
"£t's been nice that we've been able to get some I'nst after that segment," Brey said. 
But the loss to the Huskies highlighted for the Irish coach Notre Dame's number one concern heading down the stretch. 
"The one thing we need the lbig guys] to do consistnntly the rest of the regular season and in the postseason is rebound the basketball," Brey said. "They've got to rebound the basketball consistently no matter if they're scoring or they're not." 
Center Torin Francis, for­ward Dennis Latimore and center/forward Hick Cornett combined for only nine boards as Connecticut out­rebounded the Irish 43-26. 
Notre Dame grabbed more rebounds than l'rovidonce (45-:~2) in a road win last Saturday but was out­rnbounded, 30-23, in a Feb. I 6 vietory against c;eorgntown.

Dear Notre Dame Students, 
This Friday, February 25, and Saturday, February 26, the University will host nearly 600 members of The Edward Frederick Sarin Society. Made up of alumni, parents, and friends, this generous crowd gathers biennially for "A Weekend of Recognition", an effort on our part to say thank you for all that they do for you and Notre Dame. The group is responsible, for example, for funding $2.2 million annually in expendable scholarships and supporting endowed professorships and capital improvements. Their generosity has touched every aspect of Notre Dame life. 
The group is so large (this is good news) that they will use North Dining Hall for Saturday meals. This means your dining options will be limited (this is bad news). 
In particular, on Saturday, 2/26/05, the North Dining Hall will be closed all day -no meals will be served. As a result, those who normally eat in the North Dinin& Hall are asked to use South Dinin& Hall for Saturday lunch and dinner. 
On behalf of the Sarin Society, please accept our sincere gratitude for your cooperation and join with us in welcoming these benefactors to campus. Special thanks too, to all the students participating in the weekend --the event simply would not occur without you.

The two, along with guard Megan Duffy, serve as the team's tri-captains and have been the voice of the Irish in 2004-05. Batteast said she and Borton set a goal before their senior cam­paign and they plan on attaining it. 
"Right now we're the class of '05 and we are really, really try­ing to leave this program how we found it -after a national eham pionship," Batteast said. "We're trying to go to the Final Four, and we've taken care of business so far so well see how it goes." 
Notre Dame has been impres­sive in nearly every game, knocking off seven top 25 oppo­mmts and avoiding any bad loss­es. If the Irish finish the season strong, they will be in a good position for a No. 2 or No. 3 seed when the NCAA Tournament bracket comes out.

Weis said each assistant coach is assigned an area of the country and that is how the jun­iors will be split up. The group then will have lunch and attend the men's basketball game. 
Weis sees the game as an opportunity for both the men's basketball team and Irish fans. 
"I happen to be a big fan of other sports," he said. ''I'm not selfish. I don't look at this as just an opportunity for football. I'm looking as this as we can kill two birds with one stone on Sunday. Our basketball team's on the bubble, and really for this game against UCLA, we need to win the game. So you would hope the student body

"[Bulger] is a great, great shooter," McGraw said. "We have a lot of concerns about our ability to guard her. She's play­ing really well." 
A hot West Virginia team will not be the only challenge Notre Dame faces Saturday, especially for Batteast and Borton. 
The team's only seniors must deal with the emotions of play­ing in front of the Irish faithful for one final game. 
"I got a little emotional the second-to-last game when they made the announcement that the last game was coming," Batteast said. "So I hopn I'll be

Borton agreed. 
"I think its been the best sea­son so far during my four years," she said. "I've really enjoyed all my teammates and I think we have a great atmos­phere here with the team chem­istry.... It's going to be a little emotional, I'm guessing because I've had so many good memories here."

team would like the help of the student body because it makes a difference when they're into the game. 
"I get a residual effect of this. When I'm sitting there, I get 80 juniors from across the Midwest, and this is their first live impression of Notre Dame." 
Weis said this is the first step to improving recruiting, after Notre Dame has finished out­side the top 10 the past two years.

and Trubee lead an experi­enced rotation. 
While Dayton might be an oft­forgotten northern team around the nation, Mainieri realizPs his ball club faces some stiff compe­tition. 
"We're expecting some really great competition down there. Dayton is one of those programs from the Midwest that maybe doesn't have a national reputa­tion, but their kids are very hard-nosed players. They play good baseball." 
"We play teams from the Mid­American Conference on a regu­lar basis during the middle of the week, and every time we play those teams we have dog­lights. Dayton is not in the Mid­American Conference, but they're like one of those teams." 
Mainieri believes the Irish need to be hard-nosed them­selves. 
"If we get some base runners, we're going to put our runners on campus." 
Weis said this is just one of a few Junior Days that will hap­pen this spring, all of which are important to recruiting for next season. He reiterated that the campus plays an important role. 
"You win and lose recruits a lot of time based on what kids on campus actually say when they're there," Weis said. "I never want anyone to mislead someone, but there was more than one time this year when a kid was out somewhere and someone would say 'don't come here.' When they say that, those guys are saying, 'hold it -their own students are saying don't come here.'" 
in motion and try to put a lot of pressure on the other team. That's our game, and whether it's against Texas A&M, Dayton or anybody else, we're going to play the game the way that we play it." 
After Thursday surgery for a hand injury suffered in last weekend's opening game, junior DH Matt Bransfield is out for at least the next couple of weeks. 
Shortstop Greg Lopez, still recovering from a hamstring injury that limited him solely to a defensive role last Sunday, should be ready to go come Saturday. 
"(His hamstring] is still a little bit tender," Mainieri said. "He'll be ready to play. We're just not sure how much." 
A team of great depth, the Irish turn to junior outfielder Alex Nettey, sophomore DH Danny Dressman and junior util­ity man Eddie Smith for major contributions. 
"Certainly Alex Nettey and Danny Dressman are going to get a signifieant amount of play­ing time this weekend, especially with Bransfield being out, and, the 80-some juniors. 
''I'm trying to make Sunday as a day when you go into the place and it's electric," he said. "What I do know is in the sell­ing of Notre Dame, truly pitch­ing Notre Dame, it's got to be a group effort. There's plenty of people that love the place, but they might not be the people that they're listening to. So what I'm trying to do is that the student body has to realize, that just as the football team is an extension of them, they're an extension of the football team when it comes to recruiting." 
Contact Heather Van Hoegarden at hvanhoeg@nd.edu 
then of course Eddie Smith being in this position of filling in for any of our infielders. Depending on what we do with Greg Lopez, how his hamstring is healing, it's quite possible that Smith could get another start," Mainieri said. 
Nettey, who leads the team with a .571 batting average in seven at-bats and owns a perfect

lie and Dressman combined for clutch hits, while Smith turned key double plays at shortstop. Whatever the nine­man combination might be, there are certainly no easy outs in the Irish lineup and no drop oils in the Irish defense. 
"I think it's the sign of a good team when you ean count on a lot of different players and that you use your entire roster. We just need everybody ready to go in there, so that when we eall on them, everybody can count on them doing the job." Mainieri said.

ND hosting uJunior Day" 
Top prospects arrive for recruiting event slated for Sunday 
By HEATHER 
VAN HOEGARDEN 
Sports Editor 
Less than a month removed from Signing Day, new head coach Charlie Weis and his coaching staff are recruiting hard for the class of 2010. 
Approximately 80 juniors will be on campus Sunday for a Junior Day, Weis said Wednesday. The players will meet with the coaching staff and attend the men's basket­ball game against UCLA at 2 

p.m. in the Joyce Center. 
"It's a pretty large number," Mike Frank of irisheyes.com said. "For something like this, it's a pretty good-sized group of guys." 
The key juniors will be cor­nerback Phillip Strozier out of Kansas City, Mo., and local product A.J. Edds, Frank said. Notre Dame will also be recruiting three quarterbacks -Demetrius Jones out of Chicago, Zach Frazer of Pennsylvania and Jason Burke, all of whom will be here Sunday. 
The high school juniors, hail­ing mostly from the Midwest, have to pay their own way to visit Notre Dame but were invited by the Irish coaching staff, Weis said. Frank said Sunday is a key part of the recruiting process. 
"I think it's important, but probably more important is for some of these kids to get a chance to meet coach Weis

Batteast, Borton to be honored 
By JOE HETTLER Sports Writer 
What started four years ago with six, ends Saturday with just two. 
Jacqueline Batteast and Teresa Borton, the only two remaining players from the 2005 recruiting class, play their final game at the Joyce Center this weekend against West Virginia at 2 p.m. when the No. 10 Irish (23-4, 11-3 Big East) face the Mountaineers (16-9, 7­7). 
Batteast and Borton will be honored before Notre Dame's conference matchup on Senior Day. The pair has seen its class dwindle from six to two after Allison Bustamante, Kelsey Wicks, Katy Flecky and Jill Krause all left the Irish pro­gram. 

"I thought it was pretty cool that six of us came in, and I would be always thinking about how Senior Night would be with people coming out and how long it would take," Batteast said. "But now, it'll be pretty quick." 
But for Irish coach Muffet McGraw, what the 2005 class lacks in numbers they make up with performance and leader­ship. 
"You can tell from the success of our team how good our lead­ership has been this year," McGraw said of Borton and Batteast. 
Batteast, an All-American last season, has continued to lead the Irish on both ends of the floor this year. She aver­ages 17.7 points and 6.6 rebounds per game and passed Alicia Ratay for fourth on the all-time scoring list with 20 points against Georgetown on Feb. 12. 
Borton has battled through injuries to help Notre Dame· in numerous ways. She is third on the team with an 8.6 scoring

Tea111 to face Dayton at HoHoKa111 Park 
By TOM DORWART Sports Writer 

Despite a week of midterms looming, the No. 20 Irish baseball team is revved up for its weekend trip to Arizona. The Irish (3-1) face the Dayton Flyers (3-2) in a three-game series -and not just in any old ballpark. 
The teams square off at HoHoKam Park, the spring train­ing home of the Chicago Cubs, in front of Cubs General Manager Jim Hendry and a handful of scouts. 
"How can you not be excited to play in a major league ballpark?" coach Paul Mainieri said. ''I'm sure the players are going to be excited to go out there and do their best." 
The series gets underway Saturday with a 2 p.m. game, which pits Notre Dame ace Tom Thornton (0-0) against Dayton right-hander Craig Stammen (1­1). At 5:30 p.m., sophomore Jess. Stewart (1-0) will take the mound for the Irish in the second nine­inning game of the day. Flyers' ace Luke Trubee (2-0), who has already tallied a team-leading 13 strikeouts and two wins, will try to continue his early-season dom­inance. To top off the weekend, Irish sophomore Jeff Samardzija (1-0) gets the call for a noon Sunday game. 
. Thornton is coming off a solid five-inning outing last weekend in the first game against Central Florida. Stewart allowed an unearned run in the second bat­tle against UCF and nabbed the win. Samardzija picked up his victory against Florida A&M. He pitched five strong innings and allowed an earned run in the third. For the Flyers, Stammen
