StaffReporter 
Less than half of Saint Mary's stu­dents believe there is a healthy, open attitude towards discussing such issues as pregnancy, birth con­trol, rape, intercourse, homosexuality and venereal disease, according to a survey given to stu­dents last year. 
One-fourth of the students believe they have been abused by someone who touched them in ways which made them feel uncom­fortable, the survey indicated. 
The information gathered from this survey, which 62 percent of Saint Mary's students responded to, wiU be used to design educational programs, said Mary Feeley, director of Campus Ministry. 
The survey also indicated that as few as 30 percent ofSaint Mary's stu­dents believe they have enough in­formation and can ask questions about physical problems, physical concerns and birth control, while less than half of the students feel confident of talking about their bodies. 
A comparison between freshmen and seniors revealed that the seniors were generally much less open with regard to the issues covered in the survey than were the freshmen. 
A recurring theme found in the. survey, said Feeley, is that students feel most at ease around other Saint Mary's students when discussing such topics. 
"We are happy that there is that support system present," said Feeley. 
Before the end of this semester, the recently-formed Sexuality Education Council will have begun an education program for sexuality, she said. 
The program's purpose will be to help each individual better under~ stand and appreciate her sexuality, she said. 
To protect students' privacy, ex­act results of the survey were not released, Feeley said.

Associated Press 
ROME · A grenade exploded last night at an outdoor cafe crowded with tourists on the fashionable Via Veneto, wounding approximately 40 people, police reported. 
Officers at the scene said two grenades were thrown, and ap­parently were aimed at a specific table among the outdoor patrons of the Cafe de Paris, but one did not ex­plode. 
Police at Rome's central headquarters said a few of the 
The Italian news agency AGI quoted police as saying the grenades were hurled from either a motor­cvcle or an automobile passing aiong the winding. hilly street that draws tourists to its shops and cafes. 
Approximately 20 people were admitted to Polyclinic Hospital, ac­cording to another I tal ian news agency, ANSA. It said most ofthe vic­tims were American, Argentine, Ger­man and English tourists. ANSA said at least five people were reported in serious condition, but several were treated at the hospital and released.

"I think Sting is a bigger draw than

The Turner concert did not sell 
out, but instead sold approximately 
7,000 tickets in her ACC appearance 
onSept. 1. 

Reminding the senate that the Stu­
dent Activities Board is not in the 
business of making money, Badin

said "We shouldn't have to worry 
about splitting our profits. 

"If we have to split profits with 
someone I will be happy to. If·we 
have to split losses ~ith someone I 
will be even more happy to," she 
said. 

Senator John Ginty questioned the need for Schwaab. "Why not just take the risk and cut her out? You could probably sell the thing out," he said. 
Sting sold out his l~t five shoW5 in New York, Mileti said. 
In other senate business, a resolu· tion was passed that confirmed the senate's desire to put a student on the Board of Trustees. Student Body President Bill Healy said there is a possibility of putting a student on the board, but added that the proposal was placed before the board in the early 1970s and had failed. 
Healy also asked the student body to give their support to the parents of injured Howard Hall freshman Kevin Hurley. Healy urged students to stop by Memorial Hospital of South Bend and give Hurley their support. 
The senate also voted to install Roberts Rules of Order, a guide to parliamentary procedure, to govern its meetings. 
"If students have questions about what was discussed at the meeting, they can talk to any stu­dent government representative or to Sister Karol)ackowski," said Kollman. 
Followingjackowski's talk, the closed section of the meeting ended and the regular agenda was discussed. 
An unusually large group of candidates for the Freshmen Ad­visory Council are preparing for the coming elections, she said. 
"There are 3 7 freshmen run­ning," said Kollman. "It is impor­tant that freshmen vote Wednesday in Haggar and that they bring their IDs," she said.

"A top priority in this country must be tracking down the money-makers and prosecuting them from here to kingdom come.

Asked about civil libertarians' objections to censorship, she said, "The Ten Com­mandments are a form of censorship. The laws of our land -all the things that encourage us to behave like human beings -are forms of censorship." Fonda called on those who influence society to erad­icate pornography.

Everyone Welcome

Senior StaffReporter 
Although Saint Mary's security is 
continuing its effor_t to increase 
campus safety, the proposed im­
plementation ofa security phone on 
Saint Mary's main drive was recently 
rejected, said Robert Foldesi, direc­
tor ofadministrative services. 
Foldesi said the proposal was 
brought to his attention by Anne 
Marie Kollman, Saint Mary's student 
body president. 
Foldesi, however, shied away from the phone installation proposal. "Many students supported the idea of a phone, but we are con­cerned ofits misuse," explained Fol­desi. 
"Officers may be taken away from their duties and emergencies if stu­dents misuse it," he added. 
Foldesi questioned if there was a real need for the phone. "There is a mobile officer on campus from 6 
p.m. 
to 12 a.m. on weeknights and 6 

p.m. 
to 2 a.m. on weekends," he said, adding, "The lighting is excellent on the walkway." Foldesi also said the installation of a phone may be a needless expense because a new security booth may be built there next year. 


He said the signage committee is considering building a permanent brick structure at the intersection of the main drive and Madaleva Drive. 
Richard Clebek, director of Saint Mary's security, said the final deci­sion on the construction of a new security building will be made jointly by the Sisters of the Holy Cross and the College administra­tion. 
They are still in the midst of choosing an exact location, he said. They also need to approve an ar­chitectural layout and plan for the building's utilization, he said. 
Clebek said the building could be 
staffed with dispatchers 24 hours a 
day or just staffed during the early 
morning hours of 6 p.m. to 12 a.m. 
on weekdays and 6 p.m. to 2 a.m. on 
weekends. 
"This building (the present 
security station) would remain and 
function as a report place for of­
ficers," Clebek said. 
Clebek stated that construction 
may begin next year. He and Foldesi 
said that the security building is the 
fourth of the proposals to be under­
taken by the signage co_mmittee. 
Regarding the May assault of a Saint Mary's student on the road bet­ween Saint Mary's and Notre Dame, Foldesi said there was no attempt to hush rumors ofthe incident. 
"When a sexual assault takes 
place, it is to be reported to Public 
Relations. They are directed to in­
form The Observer and local 
newspapers. They are also to inform 
the public ofany danger." 
Added Foldesi, "There is no need 
to hide anything." 
Clebek cited a campus-wide letter sent to all students from Sister Karol Jackowski, dean of Student Affairs, informingSaint Mary's women ofthe dangers of walking alone, as a security precaution which has been taken. i 
I

Clebek said he will soon be sen­ding letters to students informing I 
, J

them of the escort service available at Notre Dame and Saint Mary's. In this letter, he also will advise stu­dents to travel in groups and not to walk or jog alone. 
"(From) October 6th to the 12th, we will put on a series ofsafety semi­nars in residence halls in conjunc­tion with the residence life staffs to make girls aware that they are their own best protection," he said. 
Clebek said students also will be informed on measures they can take to protect themselves. 
Citiag other security provisions to be taken, Clebek continued, "Security will periodically produce pamphlets on self-defense and protecting their property. Hope­fully, some of that will make stu­dents aware ofnot only the danger at Saint Mary's and Notte Dame, but also neighboring communities as well." 
ND/SMC crosswalk studied 
By ANN KALTENBACH 
SeniorStaffReporter 
Recognizing the safety problem at the crosswalk on U.S. 31-33 North between Saint Mary's and Notte Dame, Richard Clebek, director of Saint Mary's security, recently re­quested a traffic and safety improve­ment study to be done by the Indiana State Highway Department. 
Clebek, in a letter dated August 7th, petitioned John Isenbarger, director ofHighways for the Indiana State Highway Department, to inves­tigate the dangerous area. 
and Douglas Road along U.S. 31-33 North. 
The first request involved placing a strobe light on the traffic signal to warn motorists of pedestrian traffic. The second called for the installa­tion ofpedesttian crossing signs. 
The third recommendation in­volved extending the delay between light cycles to ensure that north and south-bound traffic is stopped, thereby allowing motorists exiting the campus to do so safely. The fourth proposed extending the light­ing at least 100 feet further north and south of the toll road entrance 


Big Red Q Quickprint Center is changing its name to Express Press of Indiana, Incorporated effective May 6th 1985 
Our franchise agreement with Big Red Q Quickprint has come to an end, and we determined that our customers could be best served by becoming an in­dependent Quickprinter. This decision was made because we have developed into a larger company than a typical franchised Quickprinter, with more diver­sified printing, typesetting, and high speed copying skills. We now possess in­house the talent to provide everything the franchise did formerly-without the extra financial bu~den of the franchise royalty payments. Needless to say, this will help us maintain our keen competitive edge well into the future. 
During the past year, in addition to completing our new facility here in South Bend, we have opened a second location in Michigan City, Indiana, upgraded our typesetting equipment to Compugraphic's newest, finest state of the art equipment, added a new printing press that allows us to print 2 colors on the sheet at once, and have just installed a high speed copier that will copy one or both sides of the sheet, collate simultaneously and do it very rapidly, allowing us to extend some very special prices for your multi-original, short run copying, booklet, manual, or legal brief. 
So when you see the new Express Press sign, and hear us answer the phone "Express Press" remember we are moving ahead in Quickprinting even further. 
We appreciate your business and look forward to serving you better in the future.

Planes strike Angola while unrest continues in S. Africa 
A880Clated Press 
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa · Troops and warplanes swept into southern Angola yesterday to strike South-West African guerrillas the military said were planning attacks on towns and military bases in the territory. 
Meanwhile, racial unrest per· !jisted in South Africa as hundreds of high school students in Johannes­burg's huge black township of Soweto went on a rampage because of rumors that black leader Nelson Mandela had died in jail. Mandela's wife said the rumors were false. 
Angola's Marxist government was informed of the strike against guer­rillas of the South-West Africa People's Organization and warned

services Catholic Social Services, Women's Care Center, Planned Parenthood and Birthline have to of­fer. 
In the section titled "Other Sexual Issues," instances of possible sexual harrassment were listed, and stu· dents were asked to state their opinions. The majority said they thought men whistling at women was offensive, as was being called "honey." 
A majority of students also said a stranger putting his arm on them was offensive. 
"This gives a baseline from which we know how students feel and how to address the issue of sexual har­rassment," Feeley said. 
A majority of students also said sexual harrassment does not occur at Saint Mary's, socially or in the clas­sroom. Sixty percent indicated that sexual harrassment does not occur frequently on the Notre Dame campus. 
Feeley stated that she was pleased with the students' response to the questions concerning the formation of a Sexuality Education Council on " campus. A majority said they would attend a course on human sexuality and liked the idea ofattending a one­hour program in the residence halls. The Sexuality Education Council will design a program b'ased on the results of the survey. Before the end ofthe semester, the council hopes to

"One follow-up can lead to anot­her ... Hopefully it (the strike) will be over within a week," Lt. Gen. Ian Gleason, the army chief ofstaff, said last night on the government· contolled television. 
Witnesses at Grootfontein, I 57 
miles south of Angola and South 
Africa's main Namibian air base, said 
air force Mirage jets took off at 
various times during the day. 

Viljoen said reconnaissance and intelligence-gathering operations established that guerrillas planned long-range bombardments of military bases and attacks on big towns and residential areas in the nonhero part of the disputed ter­ritory. 
SWAPO has not been known to have long-range artillery in its battle for Namibia, which South Africa governs under a League of Nations mandate abrogated by the U.N. General Assemby in 1966. 
Gleason said troops· were pursu­ing the guerrillas' 8th Battalion, 
which he estimated at 400 to 800 
men and said was "well-dispersed" 
in southern Angola. He said it was 
the unit that was to have made the 
attacks. 
After the last crossborder strike early in July, Viljoen said his forces killed S 7 guerrillas and lost one man in a two-day operation. The July strike was the first since South Africa completed a negotiated withdrawal of its forces, a year late, from sout­hern Angola. 
SWAPO guerrillas have fought a 19-year guerrilla war for Namibia that has killed nearly l0,000 guerril­las and 566 South African troops, by South Africa's official count. 
The white-minority government has ignored U.N. demands for a cease-fire and independence for the terr'itory. About l million people 

live in Namibia, 90 percent of them 
black or of mixed race. 
In Soweto, students streamed from Orlando High School and stoned vehicles in response to the rumors about Mandela, witnesses reported. Three armored vehicles moved up to the school, firing tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse the students. 
Bus services ceased in most parts of Soweto by early evening after youths in two other districts, Or­lando West and Dube, stoned buses and set fire to a delivery truck. A post-nightfall police communique ,. said several vehicles were destroyed and soldiers firing birdshot wounded one youth.

go to each residence hall so that they can discuss the survey, its results and the programs to be offered, Feeley said. 
The council also hopes to build programs around the different areas in the survey, she said. These programs would include both in-hall and campus-wide speakers. 
The council wants to find a space on campus for a Women's Resource Center. This center would have material for all issues concerning women, and a trained staff of faculty and students, Feeley said. 
"I think this survey began a more open atmosphere on campus. It sort of gave students permission to dis­cuss issues concerning their sexuality and their ability to make decisions concerning themselves," she said. 
"I'm glad to find that the students, faculty and administration are taking things seriously," Feeley said, ad­ding, "I feel very positively about the survey and the Sexuality Education Council." 
~i~~~_()__l_._ll__t__________________ru-es-da~y-,Sept-em_b_er-17_,_19-85--p-ag_e_s Education on birth control has not been problem 
It is singularly appropriate that Bill Krais' Viewpoint (Sept. I 0) advocating birth control should have appeared on the same page with John O'Callaghan's letter bemoaning the lack of a Catholic viewpoint at Notre Dame. Clearly Krais' piece is meant to challenge the Church's teaching on birth control. What dis­tinguishes his piece is the lack of understand­ing of the reasons why the Church teaches that contraception is wrong. 
Janet Smith 
guest column 
Krais speaks compassionately about the dif­ficulties of those facing unwanted preg­nancies, especially the young and unmarried. He offers strictly utilitarian or consequen­tialist solutions to this problem; he argues that the best solution, the most workable solution, the utilitarian solution, to this problem is to educate the public about birth control. He believes that if more young people knew about contraception, there would be fewer unwanted pregnancies. 
I wonder ifKrais has consulted the available literature on the question of the connection between the use of contraception and un­wanted pregnancies. I recommend to him Kristan Luker's book, "Taking Chances: Abor­tion and the Decision Not to Contracept." Luker (who is both pro-contraception and pro-abortion, and thus without a bias against contraception) has discovered that 80 per­cent of the women who seek abortion are ex­perienced with contraceptives. That is, they have used contraception carelessly or 
Petty complaints do not solve bad situations 
Dear Editor: 
The Viewpoint article of Monday, Sept. 9, concerning the depressing aspects of life at Notre Dame showed an attitude toward-, Notre Dame and the South Bend area which believe is becoming too prevalent among stu­dents. During my three plus years of study here I have read too many articles and heard too many comments criticizing the social life, the Administration's decisions regarding the grass and the Indiana weather. If this place is so lousy, why did all these cynics decide to come in the first place? There must be some redeeming quality to attract these people to the University of Notre Dame, located in 
Doonesbury 

stopped using contraception. 
Luker tells us that most of the reasons have 
to do with the ambiguous status of the 
relationships in which the women are in­
volved; many of these women "half­
accidentally" and "half-purposely" get 
pregnant in order to determine how much 
their partners do in fact care for them. Her 
studies also show that young teenagers par­
ticularly have a resistance to using contracep­
tion; they do not like to have a self-image of 
themselves as one who is "ready to have sex." 
Nor does Krais give any indication that he is aware of the abortifacient capacities of the most popular forms ofcontraception. Many, if not most, forms of the pill do not work by stopping ovulation, but work after conception has occurred; that is, they are not con­traceptive, but are abortive; they work by ren­dering the uterine wall hostile to the fertilized egg. The IUD works only by causing early­term abortions. 
I mention all this to suggest to Krais that his utilitarian solution to unwanted pregnancies may in fact bring about the opposite result he seeks and that one ofthe results ofwidespread use of contraception is more abortions, more deaths of unborn children · abortions which the women don't even know they are having. 
I wonder how well Krais knows the women, and often girls, behind the statistics of un­wanted pregnancies. Very few are uneducated about birth control. I have heard the sad tales ofmany ofthese young women and can testify that what they need is not more access to birth control but loving friends and greater love and respect for themselves; some ofthem think the only way they can be loved is by having sex. 
Yes, the availability of the pill does make it hard for these young women to say no. As I have suggested, it is particularly hard for them to say no, since many of them come from broken or troubled homes, and thus feel unloved. They hope to find love in sexual relationships, but regularly find themselves exploited and rejected. Few ofthem are really happy in relationships involving sex. To the question, "Has having sex improved your relationship with your boyfriend?" teenagers regularly answer in the negative. 
Contraception will not help these young women with their problems, it will only help them prolong their problems. What they need to learn about is what makes for good relation­ships, how to plan for the goals they hope to achieve in life, and how to say no to the ex­ploitive relationships they have been involved in. This kind of education, this kind of loving concern is much more time consuming. much more personally demanding, than simply giving them more contraception. 
Still, it is not right to conduct this argument only on utilitarian or consequentialist grounds; such arguments generally are faulty since nearly any act, nor matter how vicious can be justified from this perspective (racism, obliteration bombing). Yet, those were the grounds chosen by Krais, and I wished to show him that · those indeed are shaky grounds. 
The Church's arguments are based on the Christian view of the dignity of the human person. Krais is writing a column for a newspaper serving a Catholic campus, yet he seems to have little acquaintance with Church teaching on this matter. If he has read the teachings of the Church on this subject, it would serve him and his readers well if he would address the arguments presented against contraception. Many who have strong

atter the administration institutes its new al­cohol policy. Hasn't anyone noticed that over the last couple months two, and possibly three, of the four most popular student drink· ing establishments have been forced to close by the police? Hasn't anyone noticed the con­voys of up to eight police cars that drive arou~d shutting down our off-campus parties? 
I know of at least six parties in the last few days which were halted by these law enforce­ment officials who use numerous vehicles and excessive manpower for up to an hour to con­trol us wild, insane, almost savage college stu­dents. Then after being forced to leave the party and go home, we find our houses broken into and it takes the cops 4S minutes to get there. Slightly twisted priorities, huh? What happened to the old warnings by one officer that we are all used to?

views on the morality of contraception have 
never read, pondered, or prayed over the 
Church's teaching on these matters. 
PopeJohn Paul II reiterates this teaching at nearly every opportunity and has given several lecture series explaining why the use of contraception is wrong. His arguments focus on hu!Jlan dignity and the type of be­havior which is worthy of the human person; he speaks about the demands oflove and what truly constitutes the union which lovers desire; he argues that sex which is not open to procreation is not unitive. 
The two purposes of sex truly are in­separable. He argues that couples certainly may choose to limit their family size, but that natural methods must be used, methods which enhance our virtue rather than in­crease our dependence on chemicals and mechanical devices. 
The Pope's argument is complex and sop­histicated -not served wdl by quick summary or by quick rejection. Many Catholics deny that they have an obligation to accept the Church's teachings on faith and morals. But surely all Catholics and, for that matter, all honest and open-minded people wishing to come to terms with the issue ofcontraception should read carefully the documents of the Church conveying this teaching. Those who read "Humanae Vitae," Pope John Paul II's "Love and Responsibility," "Familiaris Con­sortio," and his lecture series, "Reflections on Humanae Vitae," will find that the argument is subtle and strong and worthy of more than a quick dismissal on consequentialist grounds. 
janet E. Smith is an assistant professor in the Program of Liberal Studies and is the chainnan of the board of the Women's Care Center. 
This activity is new and I don't think it's any. coincidence that it occurs right after the· declaration of the glorious alcohol policy. 
, They take away our on-campus social life, so we move off, and then they somehow pressure South Bend into eliminating our so­cial activities off-campus too. What's going on? 
How long before South Bend is proclaimed a dry city? I'm glad I don't have to put up with this much longer. In the meantime, take The Observer's advice and give them a jingle down at the police station before your next party. Let'em know just what you're up to. That way, they can keep a nice close eye on you and your friends and we'll all be safe from any possible corruption.

ike the leaves turning golden 
brown and the air becoming 
cool, there are several events that 
signify the end ofsummer and the 
beginning ofautumn. Heralded 
from high and low, each sign 
promises great things for us. 
Unfortunately, some ofthem 
don't fufill these high expectations. 
Yes, it's the fall season oftelevi­sion, when the three networks go toe to toe to get us to spend our precious evening hours watching them. An avalanche ofnew series, movie premieres, mini-series, and specials will try to gain our atten­tion and win the coveted Neilsen ratin~ title. 
As for sports, ABC will cover the World Series, with NBC showing the League Championships. NBC has the rights to Super Bowl XXI from the Superdome in New Or­leans. College football will be on all three networks as the football avalanche continues. CBS will cover the "Road to Dallas" and the finals ofthe NCAA basketball champion­ships. ABC's "Wide World of Sports" will celebrate its silver anniversary this season. 
Who will win the ratings war? We'll find out officially nextJune, but I have my own prediction. ABC will still remain in third, not able to

make up the ground between it and the other two networks. The battle will be between NBC and CBS, and it will be a close one decided by tenths ofa rating point. "Miami Vice" will overpower "Falcon Crest." "Amazing Stories!" will be the big hit ofthe new season and we'll see a decline in the popularity of the prime time soaps. 
Who will win the 1985 fall season? NBC. 
Now remember, these are just early season predictions. The final judgments will come when I see these shows this fall. The choice will be yours also. You can watch one ofthe new shows, or you can change the channel. That's the easiest decision ofall.

N 
BC used to be known as the 
loser network, but not 
anymore. The network's fortunes 
turned surprisingly good in the last 
St:ason. 
The Thursday night lineup of "The Cosby Show," "Family Ties," "Cheers," and "Night Court" was practically unbeatable in the ratings. The acclaimed "Miami Vice," combining rock music, sharp editing, fantastic sets and color schemes, excellent acting, and superb scripts, shot into the Top 10 over the summer and earned 1 5 Emmy nominations. 
It is with this base that NBC will begin its assault on CBS for the top spot in television. Six series debut on NBC this fall season. 
 
"The Golden Girls" could well be called "Miami Nice" by NBC. Four older women, played by Bea Arthur, Betty White, Rue McClanahan, and Estelle Getty, occupy a house in southern Florida. Can a sitcom turn "old" into golden laughs? Consider­ing that the creator is Susan Harris, the lady behind "Soap" and "Benson," it might just do that. 

 
What would be your reaction if you heard that NBC gave a certain producerI director a contract to produce 44 episodes ofa series without fear ofbeing cancelled? The network has gone mad, right? Wrong, considering said producer 



is one Steven Spielberg and the series is "Amazing Stories!" Most of the information on this half-hour anthology series is hush-hush until it premieres Sept. 29. What is known is who some ofthe directors of the episodes are -names like Clint Eastwood, Martin Scorcese, Brian DePalma, and Timothy Hut­ton. Spielberg will be the executive producer and has written most of the scripts. IfSpielberg can translate his magic from the big screen to the small screen, "Amazing Stories!" may be just that. 
NBC 

 
The Master of Horror, Alfred Hitchcock, is coming to NBC as "Alfred Hitchcock Presents" returns to television. The half-hour show, following "Amazing Stories!" will present new or updated versions of the tales ofmystery that were shown during the series' first run from 1955 to 1965. The introduc­tions to the episodes, featuring Hitchcock, will be transformed from black and white to color by a new computer process. 

 
Robert Blake as a ghetto priest?! Yes, you heard right. Blake plays Father Noah "Hardstep" Rivers in 



"Hell Town," a place where problems are numerous, yet the intrepid priest tries to solve them 
all through prayer and a little street 
savvy. 
 
Prime time's newest heroes are an odd lot on "Misfits ofScience." One can turn objects to ice. Anot­her can shoot bolts ofelectricity. Mental power helps another to move objects, and the last ofthe group can shrink from his 7'4" height to the size ofa Ken doll. Needless to say, these four make for an interesting crime-fighting team. 

 
"227" is the address ofa Was­hington, D.C. tenement where Marla Gibbs and her family live. As usual, Gibbs and her sharp tongue will provide most ofthe laughs for this series. 

 
On the movie scene, NBC will premiere "Annie," the Broadway musical brought to the silver screen. 1982's "An Officer and a Gentleman" also premieres this season, and the big laughs will come from th.e Eddie Murphy hit "48 Hrs." As for mini-series, Maxi­millian Schell will star in the nine hour "Peter the Great." George C. Scott will headline "Mussolini: The Untold Story." 


With this lineup, NBC hopes to permanently shed its "loser" image and display what really beautiful peacock feathers it has.

F
OR ABC, last season was a ratings disaster as it finished a distant third behind rejuvenated NBC and CBS. ABC's only certified hit was the supersoap "Dynasty." Hoping to spring back to life this season, ABC unveils eight new series, the most ofany network.  The "Hollywood Beat" is turffor two undercover cops who depend on an assortment of"interesting" friends to nab the bad guys who invade their turf. Most outstanding of these friends is ex-L.A. Raider John Matuszak, who plays a gay restaurant owner. Telling gay jokes around him may prove to be very detrimental to one's health. 
 
Robert Wagner returns to TV as a suave insurance investigator in "lime Street." The locales promise to be exotic, the crimes dastardly, and the women beautiful. Veteran actor Lew Ayres also appears as Wagner's father. 

 
Using ordinary objects to get out of extraordinary trouble is the trademark of"MacGyver." Richard Dean Anderson plays this scientific Indiana jones who is more likely to use a paper clip than a bullwhip when facing up to the bad guys. 


 After striking out in late-night television, Alan Thicke takes his -shot at making it in prime time on the comedy "Growing Pains." He plays a sitcom father with a typical sitcom family. It will need a lot more than that to succeed, scheduled against the powerful "A-Team." 
ABC 
 
The struggle between a family of mobsters and a family ofhonest cops is the central story of"Our Family Honor." One subplot in­volves the mobster's son falling in love with the policeman's daughter, who is also a rookie cop. Eli Wal­lach is cast, quite naturally, as the patriarch of the mobster family. 

 
"The Insiders" are not cops, but magazine writers who go under­cover to dig up the real big stories. One ofthem is a dead ringer for Prince and some of the production techniques look as if they have been taken from a certain NBC series set in a certain city in Florida. 

 
It is a rule ofTV thumb that hit series spawn spinoffs, and 


"Dynasty" is no exception as it 
gives birth to "Dynasty II: The 

Colbys." The cast is filled with big 
names like Charlton Heston and 
Barbara Stanwyck, and the clothes 
and settings promise to be as 

glamorous as "Dynasty." Still, one 
thing bothers me. How did Pamela 
Sue Martin transform into Emma 
Samms? 

 
Private detectives usually don't quote authors such as Wordsworth, but "Spenser: For Hire" does. He's also a gourmet cook and tough in the clinch. Robert Urich, last seen on "Vegas," stars in the role made popular by a series ofbooks by Robert B. Parker. 

 
ABC has lined up some notable movies for premiere on its network. "The Right Stuff" heads the list, a stunning tale ofthe beginnings of our space program. "Tootsie" and "Mr. Mom" offer Dustin Hoffman and Michael Keaton in these two notable comedies. For high ad­veftture, there is "Blue Thunder " Ambitious projects are in the works for ABC's miniseries. The two Civil War novels ofJohnJakes, "North and South" and "Love and War," will make for 24 hours ofprogramming .this season. 


Jay Acovone (left) and Jack Scalia star as a pair oftough cops on the new ABC show. 
C 
BS finished the 1984 
season on the top ofthe Niel­
sen race, but had to fight offup-and­
comer NBC to do so. CBS will look 
to retain that lofty position by 
debuting six new series oftheir 
own. 

 
"Hometown" premiered last month to very good reviews. The show presents the lives and loves of seven friends who met in the '60s, and who are now coping with the problems of the '80s. It does sound a lot like the plot of"The Big Chill," but it has the potential to try material that wasn't touched in the movie. 

 
See ifthis premise sounds familiar: middle class black parents cope with the problems ofraising their children. "The Cosby Show"? No, it's "Charlie and Company." Flip Wilson plays the Bill Cosby role in this show. 

 
Ifyou can have an adventure anthology series, why not have a comedy anthology? That is just the idea behind "George Burns Com­


edy Week." Ifthe genius ofGeorge Burns can be utilized properly, this show could be the surprise hit of the season. 
 Turning a hit movie into a weekly series can be tricky business. It can work well or it can bomb. CBS is hoping that it can turn the Richard Pryor/Gene Wilder hit movie "Stir Crazy" into a hit series. Two un­knowns, Joe Guzaldo and Larry Riely, will try to fill the shoes of Wilder and Pryor. Good luck. guys. 
CBS 
 Being harassed by a tnurderous maniac? Why not just open the newspaper to find the advertise­ment for "The Equalizer"? The Equalizer, played by Edward Wood­ward, is a former operative ofthe CIA who has decided to offer his dubious services to the public. 
 
The phrase, "You are now enter­ing 'lbe Twilight Zone'," will be heard once more on CBS as they resurrect the series that has gained cult status in syndication. The stories will be new, and will be performed by a different cast each week. 

 
CBS is letting loose a deluge of theatrical movie premieres for this season. At the top of the list is "Sophie's Choice" and "lbe Big Chill." As for comedy, there will be "The Man with Two Brains," "Risky Business," "National Lampoon's Vacation," and "Airplane II: The Sequel." For adventure buffii there is "High Road to China" and "Blade Runner." "All the Right Moves" and "Rocky III" also premiere on the network. As for major mini-series, CBS has none in the wings. 


Well, there you have it, the com­plete TV preview for the upcoming fall season. Some shows look very promising, and some others look promising to be cancelled within a few weeks. \l'e shall see.

New coach leads ND tennis team 
ByJOHN COYLE 
Sports Writer 
Notre Dame's new women's ten­
nis coach, Michelle Gelfman, seems 
to be fitting in very well on the 
Notre Dame campus. The young 
coach has got her team off to a good 
start as it begins a very challenging 
fall season. 
The energetic Gelfman already has an impressive list ofaccomplish­ments to her name, though she has been coaching for only seven years. Her career record as a head coach stands at 226-79. 
An excellent player herself, Gelfman attended Northeast Mis­souri State University, where she played four years of varsity tennis. After graduation, she played on the Penn Circuit, as she began work on her masters degree at Indiana Uni­versity. She continued to play as a professional during the summer for a total of eight years after becoming a head coach. 
The coaching career of the 31­year-old started at Valpraiso Univer­sity, where she coached the men's and women's teams for three years. Two of the three years there, her team went to the National Cham­pionships and finished in the top 12 of the then small college section of NCAA Division I. 
After taking a year off because of an illness in her family, the spirited coach moved on to Beloit College, where she turned the program 
around and finished first and second 
in the division in her two years. 
Finally, she went to Western Il­linois University and rebuilt the program. She guided the men's team to a third-place finish in the Division I finals and gave the women's team a strongfoundation on which to build. 
Gelfman works to get the most out of her players but believes strongly that academics should never be sacrificed because oftennis time. Therefore, her practices are in­tense and difficult, but not lengthy. 
A great emphasis is placed on the value of every workout by the new head coach. The best players are pitted against each other in practice under game conditions so, hope­fully, they will be prepared for whatever comes tbeir way in actual matches. On some teams, this strong level of competiveness in practice might cause problems but Gelfman said she feels that there will be no bruised egos on the Irish squad be­cause the players get along so well. 
"I try to make the practices short but hard," she explains. "The actual matches are much easier if I make the practices as challenging as pos­sible. Even though tennis is an in­dividual sport, I treat the team as a whole. We practice together and we train together. They are a closely knit group and they all root for each other." 
Gelfman said she tries to correct the technical defeciencies that have gone unnoticed before. The Irish

coach tries to refine the games ofher 
team members and to make them 
whole players. 

Gelfman also is aware of the fact 
that beside being a coach, she also is 
a role model for her team. She said 
she is careful of her attitudes and 
mannerisms on and offthe court and 
l

believes that her behavior should be 
beyond reproach. j
"I stress the importance of the j 
girls conducting themselves well at 
all times," she said. "I hope they will 
j

carry what they learn in tennis ­
competiveness, discipline, fair play ­
into later life." 

The enthusiastic coach is confi­
l

dent that the Irish can do well on the 
Division I level. She does not expect 
~ 

as many wins this year as there have 
l ~ ~ ~ been in the past for the Irish because 
~ 

they will be meeting more good 
teams. 

Despite the fact that the team 
provides only two scholarships, 
which are split among all of the 
players, Gelfman said she feels that 
the academic quality of Notre Dame 
can attract top players. The coach 
said she hopes to rebuild the 
program and have the Irish in the 
top 1 5 in the nation within the next 
three years. 

DePaul is the next stop for the 
Notre Dame women's tennis team. 
Gelfman said she will use the 
matches today in Chicago as a war­
mup for later in the week. when the 
Irish will be facing several tough 
teams. 

Crew team to begin Sept. 28 
TOMYOON 
Club Corner 

 ROWING CLUB: The Notre Dame Rowing Club will begin ilS fall season of regattas ~th ilS first race on September 28 at Des Moines, Iowa. The regatta will be sponsored by 'the Des Moines Rowing Club and will involve mostly club teams. 
Last year when Notre Dame en­tered the race, the Irish came away with one of their boats getting the fastest time. If they can repeat this feat, the participants will be awarded a silver cup. 
During the fall season, the meets consist of three-to three-and-a-half­mile races in which each boat races against the clock. In the meelS, the club uses four men's boats and one women's boat. Each boat has eight rowers and one coxswain. 
After their regatta in Des Moines, 
the Irish will journey north of the 
United States border to compete in a 
regatta in Petersburough, Canada on 
October 5. Notre Dame is the only 
United States team entered in that 
race. 

"This year is our largest men's team ever," said Chris Nye, the crew club's coach. "In fact, it is three times larger than before. We have a lot ofgood people on the team, and, with eight returning varsity men, the novice men who are now on the team are really pushing the others to become better. 
"This year our attitude has some­what changed in that this year we want to row to win. I am real excited about this year because with John Younger making the National team last year, hopefully the other good rowers will put forth the dedication to make the National team." 
 CLUB SCORES: When the Notre Dame Water Polo team traveled to the University of Michigan last weekend, it came away with an ex­citing overtime win. Steve Coffey scored the winning goal, which made the final score I 7-16. The club's next meet is in Lousiville in two weeks.

"His punting certainly was a 

\ bright spot for our team," says Mal Moore, the Irish assistant head coach who works with the special teams. "It was mighty impressive. As

But Moore was not the only one to bestow praise on the walk-on, who does not receive a scholarship for playing football.

' 
Associated Press 
\ 
\ I PITfSBURGH -The government yesterday rested its case against 
l 
~ 
Curtis Strong, a Philadelphia caterer charged with dealing cocaine to major league baseball players, after . dropping two of the 16 counts against him. \ U.S. attorney J. Alan johnson said 
\ ~':-two counts were dropped be­cause ofa lack oftestimony concern­ing those charges. johnson called seven current or former major 
; 

\ leaguers as witnesses during the prosecution's presentation of its case. 
Defense attorney Adam 0. Renfroe Jr. said that Pittsburgh Pirates Manager Chuck Tanner, former Pirates team captain Willie Stargell and · St. Louis Cardinals pitcher joaquin Andujar would be the first witnesses called today when the defense opens its case. 
Tanner, who has said he was un­aware of the allegedly widespread use of cocaine on his team several years ago, will be the leadoffwitness, Renfroe said. 
In another courtroom on the same floor, jury selection began yes­terday in the federal trial of Robert "Rav" McCue, 38, of Pittsburgh, former controller at the Easter Seal Society ofAllegheny County. McCue also is accused of dealing drugs to major league players. 
Strong, 39, is accused ofdistribut­ing cocaine to players on 14 dates that the Pirates played home games from 1980 to 198.4. The seven cur­rent or former players testified that they purchased the drug from Strong in several National League cities, although Strong is on trial only for those offenses alleged to have occurred in Pittsburgh.

According to Akers, the Belles showed improvement at the contest in Bloomington. 
"We're moving the ball much bet· ter, and we seem to be getting stronger," Akers said. "We saw a definite improvement in our defense, but we still have a long way to go." 
The Belles travel to Kalamazoo, Mich., tomorrow to face the Kalamazoo College women's soccer team in a game scheduled for 4:30 p.m. 

Akers commented on the Belles' ) chances to win the game. 
"Kalamazoo is an aggressive, fast team to play, and it's going to take our best effort." he said.

he does not like to wear the football clothing he is issued, so he gives it all to his twin. 
Sorensen says he plays best when 

Dan Sorensen 

members ofhis family are watching. 
"I want to please my mom and dad most, and I want to leave the field knowing I have contributed," says the Irish punter. "I hope my family will make it to a game this season." 
Dave Sorensen says he will be at the Nov. 2 Navy game, although the whole family will watch every game on television. 
When Sorensen is not out on the football field, he follows his favorite baseball team, the Minnesota Twins. 
"I love baseball," he says. "I must have over 500,000 baseball cards. I used to advertise in sports magazines to trade and buy them." 
Not just an athlete, Sorensen is a member of the Dean's Honor List as an accounting major in the College ofBusiness. 
Despite all the work and frustra­tion he's been through, Sorensen in­sists he would do it all over again in a minute. 
"I never really thought about quit­ting because.! felt so fortunate just to be out there playing for Notre Dame." 
Whoever said dreams don't come true? Certainly not those two fresh­men from Dillon who slept in their jerseys.
