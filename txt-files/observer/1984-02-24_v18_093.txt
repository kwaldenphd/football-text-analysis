Student disturbances cause policy change at Bendix Woods park 
By MARY HEILMANN 
News Staff 
A series ofdisturbances at Bendix 
Woods involving Notre Dame and 
Saint Mary's students have neces­
sitated several changes in the park's 
policy toward student groups, 
according to Nancy MacCartney, su­
perintendent of recreation for St. Joseph County Parks. 
Non-faculty supervised groups will now be charged an extra Sl 0 per hour for a uniformed county police officer to be in attendance. 
Thl· change in policy occurred as a result ola Fe h. 4 incident involving students and park employees. According to MacCartney, the be­havior of students on the Student Union-sponsored trip "reached the point of violence and total dis­respect for the park staff and other park patrons. Alcohol appeared to he the catalyst on this evening and other evenings that students have disrupted the normal park opera­tion." 
The disturbance began when park employees tried to restrain students at the top of the tubing hill until the run was clear. Christopher Nye, director of the Bendix Woods Ski Patrol, reported in a letter to Dean of Students James Roemer that "three park employees had physically sta· tioned themselves in the center of the tube run to keep people from going too soon. Agroup offive or six students formed a line about ten feet back and then the group ran over the attendants, who were fortunately not injured." 
Other students ignored orders prohibiting tubing on the ski slopes. When park employees tried to stop them, the students attempted to knock them over by sliding down on the tubes. Several employees, including Mark Mowery, the park's Winter Program Director, sustained minor injuries. 

"I was informed that at one point 
in the evening, a student also 
punched a tube hill attendant in the 
face several times and then ran to 
avoid apprehension. Had Mr. 
Mowery or myselfbeen present, that 
student would have gone to jail for 
assault," Nyc wrote to Roemer. 

In a return letter, Roemer assured 
Nyc that the administration regrets 
the incidents which, according to 
MacCartney, have been occurring 
throughout the season. 

."We will cooperate with you and 
all park personnel . . . and we 
apologise for the serious discour­
tesies ofour students," Roemer said. 
He maintained, however, that the 
issue lies with Bendix Woods ad­
ministrators and the Student Union 
Social Commission, which has been 
asked to pay for damages, including 
broken eyeglasses and torn clothing. 
Asked what action the Student 
Union plans to take, Laurene 
Powers, director of the Social Com­
mission, replied, "Right now, I'm not 
sure what we're going to do. When I 
left Bendix Woods, they had told me 
that everything was fine. Chances 
are that not all the employees were 
down from the slope yet." 

"it's not an isolated incident there have been problems like this for a while. I guess they felt that the Student Union is a key group at Notre Dame and a good place to S'~art to address the issue. I really regret that it happened and was very surprised," said Powers. 
MacCartney said that she hopes 
the preventative measures will be 
temporary, adding that "when 
respect for the rules and personnel 
is evident, this extra precaution will 
not be necessary. It's very unfor­
tunate that a dozen or so students 
out ofsuch a large group caused the · problems which will now affect 
everyone."

Investigation fails to discover how Reagan obtained Carter papers 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -The Justice Department said yesterday it had been unable to discover in an eight· month investigation how Ronald Reagan's presidential campaign ob­tained former President Jimmy Car­ter's briefing papers in 1980, but said it "uncovered no credible evidence that--the transfer violated any criminal law." 
The department also said it had found no evidence of "any plan or conspiracy by Reagan election offi­cials to obtain the Carter briefing materials or any other confidential, internal Carter documents." 
The department concluded there were no government documents among the briefing materials and that the Reagan camp never had the 
final version of Carter's briefing 
materials for his crucial Oct. 28, 
1980 debate with Reagan. 
But FBI agents reviewing thousands of documents in the files ofReagan campaign officials did find .other documents "identified as in­ternal documents of the Carter White House or the Carter cam· 
paign." 
But the FBI found no evidence of 
theft or criminal misappropriation 
of these documents. "In most in­
stances the material tin question had 
been widely disseminated to the 
press or others and were obtained 
through wholly proper channels," 
the department said. 
In other cases, it was impossible to determine how these documents were obtained "due to the professed

Chileans speak out on oppression 
By BARBARA HARDIN 
News Staff 
"Imagine, tomorrow, not being able to say what you want as a student or teacher," said Professor Jaime Bellalta, a native of Chile, of the oppression in his country. 
Bellalta, an architecture professor at Notre Dame, spoke along with another Chilean, Isabel Donoso of Santiago, at a Human Rights lecture last night at Saint Mary's. 
The Human Right's lecture series was developed by the Saint Mary's Justice Education Depart· ment. According to Esmee Bel­lalta, coordinator of the department, the lectures are designed to inform teachers and students of the current condi­tions in oppressed countries. 
Donoso, the coordinator of a human rights group in Chile, said that presently the people ofChile 
are under the rule of a dictator who has taken away the rights they once had under democracy. When the Chileans partake in their non-violent protest of ban­ging pots and pans together in the streets, said Donoso, many are detained by the police, some tortured and some killed. 
According to Donoso, "30 per­cent of the people in Chile receive a salary of $20 a month, and 30 percent are un­employed." Families live togeth· er in one house and "most Chileans don't know what it's like to sleep in a bed alone," said Donoso. 
Donoso said the Catholic Church has taken an active role in aiding the "oppressed, repressed people of Chile." She explained that lawyers gather with communities to explain their legal rights. prisoners are visited, health problems are dealt with, and an awareness of the suffering that occurs is spread through literature and word of mouth. 
Bellalta agreed that the Chilean conditions are "totally inhuman. . ..any type of parlia­ment or Congress has been eliminated." Presently, the only type of decision-making party is chosen directly by the govern­ment. 
Bellalta said Chile is definitely a Catholic country, as 85 to 95 percent of the Chileans are Cath· olic. He said the government has not been able to break up or take control of the Catholic church, though they have made many ef. forts to do so. Bellalta, like Donoso, spoke of the Church's part of those in possession of the documents," the department said.

In neither these documents nor in the briefing materials was there any classified informtion, the depart· ment said. 
The department said the I.BI inter­viewed more than 220 people, including President Reagan and high officials of both camapigns. About 
I,000 boxes of documents, audio and video tapes were reviewed by the I.BI including videotapes of the Reagan debate preparations. Laboratory examinations were con­ducted on some documents, the department said. 
But spokesman Tom DeCair said no polygraph examinations were given, because the investigation never reached that stage. "We closed it down when we determined there was no credible evidence of a crime," he said.

Student fashion experts, spec­tators, and critics will have a chance to preview the latest in summer ap­parel, at a benefit fashion show to be held by the sophomore class the week after spring break. Proceeds for the show will be donated to the Special Olympics. 
Brian Welsey, public relations chairman for the show, said "this is the first time that anything like this has been done. We would like; to have a big turnout to make this event successful." 
Financial success is likely since most of the materials are being donated, said Welsey. "Hudson's, Milady Shop, The Limited, Rich Man, Gilbert's, Redwood and Ross, Brown's Sporting Goods and L.S. Ayres are all donating the use of some of their fashions. There will be Merle Norman's is even donating the makeup for the models. We will be charging two dollars per person, so we hope to raise between $300 and S400 from the event." 
Welsey credited Fashion Show Chairman Jenny Stepan with the idea for the event. "Jenny said she had been involved in fundraisers of this type before and they were quite successful. The rest of the advisory council liked the idea and decided to support the event." 
The council chose "Quest for Gold" as the theme because of the show's beneficiary, the summer Spe­cial Olympics. 
The models for the show, accord­ing to Welsey, are Kathy Murdock, Carolyn Hagan, Susan Curry, Chris Degraff, Anne DuCharme, Terry Kirschman,Julie Dunn,Jeanie Poole, Kevin Moser, Jim Rudser, Mike Roberts andJohn Coyne. 
The exact date and location of th( show have not yet been decided.

Negotiators from the White House and 
Congress resumed tl!lks yesterday on reducing federal budget deficits with no agreement in sight, but plenty of partisan bickering over what to do and who is to blame for the red ink. Meanwhile, the tax-writing committees in the House and Senate began work on their own deficit-reduction packages. In his nationally broadcast news conference Wednesday night, President Reagan -who called for the talks to find a SI00 billion "down payment" on eliminating deficits -urged the bargainers to "get down to business." The presi­dent also said he does not favor tax increases or military spending reductions as a method of trimming deficits, projected at Sl80.4 billion in the fiscal I9HS budget Reagan submitted to Congress ear­lier this month. -AP

Confused about next year's alcohol policy? 
That's not surprising; after all, the alcohol committee has not released any information about what they are considering for next year, nor have they released the information they have collected about Notre Dame drinking habits. 
All this year, the Alcohol Committee has been gather· ing information to determine the extent ofthe "alcohol problem" on campus and a possible solution to it. While the members of the committee claim that the informa­tion they've gathered is very convincing, they will not release it to the students. 
l, for one, am tired ofhearing "You mean you don't think there's any alcoholproblem on campus!?" as the committee members' response when the extent of the problem is questioned. The existence of students on this campus who have a drinking problem is not in ques­tion. There arc. Rather, the question is whether or not

Reports have circulated several times that the Alcohol Committee had already decided what to do, that the Board of Trustees had approved the decision, and that the report would he made public later that day. As far as anyone on the committee will admit, none of the reports are true. 
At the risk of fueling speculation, hut with the hope that this will limit the rumors, here are some of the changes that the committee may recomnwnd. T.~~re will he some kind of change from the present status quo. And the campus will probably not go completely dry. 
Viable options they may he considering include enforcing the state drinking age of 2 I; banning all hall

After the extent of the problem is determined, the possible responses must be weighed.

Chairman Beth Lavezzorio and her committee have planned a full schedule of events for the weekend, including Saturday's Sports Festivity Day, in which sophomores and their parents can participate in tennis, racquetball, running, or aerobic dance at Angela from 9 a.m. to noon. The Faculty Open House will also be held in Angela from 12:30 p.m.-2:30 p.m. 
The Class Mass for sophomores and their parents will be celebrated at 4 p.m. in the Church ofLoretto. 
Saturday evening there will be a dinner dance at the Century Center. Cocktails will begin at 6 p.m., followed by welcomes from Lavez­zorio and College President John Duggan. Dinner and dancing will last from 8 p.m. to midnight. 
Sunday morning, a Class Brunch, held in the Saint Mary's cafeteria from 9:30-10:30, will close the fes­tivities. 
Lavezzorio said sophomores and their parents are responding to this year's weekend with great en­thusiasm. She estimated that over 900 people will attend the dinner d:mce, which means that over half the class will be participating with their parents. 
Most of the parents will travel to Saint Mary's from parts of the Mid­west and the eastern seaboard, al­though some will make the trip from Hawaii, Texas, and California. 
Lavezzorio is anticipating a suc­cessful weekend and is pleased with the efforts of her co-workers. "Considering the amount of time and work we've put in, I think it'll run smoothly. It should be a memorable occasion for everyone," said Lavezzorio.

Shultz worried policy in Lebanon could harm US interests in Mideast 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -Secretary of 
State George P. Shultz was described 
yesterday as worried that the failure 
of U.S. policy in Lt'"banon could 
c;mst· considt:"rable harm to 
American interests throughout the 
Middle East, and busy developing a 
stratt·gy to rt:asst-rt U.S. influence in 
tht· region. 
One key Shultz aide said he was 
willing to accept the blame for that 
failure -ifsomeone has to take the 
blame -even though President 
Reagan declared that Shultz "has not 
failed" in Lebanon. 
But this official said the Lebanon 
situation "is infinitdy more compli· 
cated than that" and that "all along 
the way, there have been only 
limited options we could take." 
This aide and othn senior State 
Departmt:"nt officials spoke of 
Shultz's views on Lebanon and the 
Middle East only on the condition 
they not bt· idt·ntifkd. 
Events in Lebanon have li.u~led 
speculation that Shultz might not 
stay at the State Department beyond 
this year. 
At his news confcrt.ncc Wedncs· 
day night, the president dismissed as 
"disgraceful" a [>uggestion by Rep. 
Bill Alexander of Arkansas, the 
deputy Democratic llousc leader, 
that Shultz should resign. 
Reagan said Shultz was not to hlame for events in Lebanon, and declared he would not accept his resignation ifShultz submitted one. 
Aides to Shultz said he won't resign now but they arc uncertain about his plans if Reagan is re­elected. Shultz has not signaled his intentions, even to his closest ad· visers, one l>fthem said. 
The ncar-collapse of the llS.­hacked government of President Amin Gemaycl has been a "personal disappointment" to Shultz, one offi· dal said, adding that Shultz is more concerned about broader issues in the Middle East. 
"lie thinks the stakes arc much greater than pcopk generally ap· predate," said the aide, adding that the question now hdng asked is, "Forget Lebanon, how will it play out in Jordan?" 
Shultz is described as particularly worrinl that Amnican cn·dibility might be eroded throughout the

Middle East, with events in Lebanon undermining the confidence of moderate Arab nations in Washing· ton's abiliry to follow through on its commitments. 
One official said Shultz's concern centers on Gemaycl's plan to abrogate the May 17, 1983, troop withdrawal agreement which Shultz helped nt:"gotiate between Lebanon and Israel. Shultz, he said, is worried "over the impact of the failure of a negotiation, a negotiation that was a success, and is now a victim" of the unravelingofU.S. policy in Lebanon. 
Shultz is said to believe that abrogation of the agreement would make a solution that much more dif­ficult to achieve in Lebanon. 
Although it is unclear whether Shultz will stay as secretary of state in any second Reagan term, several high officials at the department have made plans to quit this year.

Freshman engineers face impossible schedule 
It's never been so little fun to be a freshman engineer than it is in 1984 at Notre Dame. In the name of saving the country from scientific illiteracy, blue-ribbon panelists -calling themselves educators -have con­vinced the nation that American schools sure don't build 'em like they used to, that Johnny will never be able to read, write or run a computer quite like Ivan, his 
eastern counterpart. 
Here at Notre Dame, the College of Engineering has responded to this pressure with a tougher, more com­prehensive curriculum effective for this year's fresh­men. While the intention to beef-up the curriculum is admirable, freshmen engineers who are serious about their work are finding themselves overworked, over­tested, overquizzed and sleepy. 
First-semester grades for freshmen engineers took a 
nose dive compared to other years, one rector said, and 
58 students (out of561) had dropped out ofthe college 
by February -three times as many as this time last year. 
The freshman engineer is treated to two semesters each of physics, calculus and chemistry. Chemistry lab is taken second semester, and an introductory engineer­ing course is taken during one ofthe semesters. In addi­tion, two semesters are required in English composition and in physical education. Only one class is reserved for a history or social science. 
That adds up to 34 credit hours, one more than the old curriculum. On paper, however, the numbers are deceiving. Physics, an addition to freshman year that replaced a social science elective, had once been reserved for sophomore year when students are better able to handle the calculus involved. It was a four-credit class with weekly tutorials; now it is somehow con­sidered a 3.5-credit course even though the tutorial has expanded to a full-blown lab. 
With the new curriculum, freshmen indicating an in­terest in engineering are pushed head first into the technical world. For some freshmen, it has been a nightmare. Calculus requires daily homework and three semester exams; chemistry includes weekly quizzes; physics has four tests and weekly quizzes; physics lab requires six lab reports; Engineering Concepts requires weekly homework, quizzes, three tests and computer projects that keep freshmen in the computer lab at all hours ofthe day. There are books to read and papers to write in the composition courses, and as as fmal blow, attendance in physical education is mandatory even though the class is worth no credit. . .,.. 
Things -won't get any easier when these freshmen become upperclassmen. Physics was tossed into fresh­man year to make room for more requirements in the engineering curriculum. On the average, the five engineering departments now require six more credit hours with civil and chemical engineering hit the hard­est. In many cases, engineering students will take six technical courses in the same semester, up to 18.5 credits during some semesters. 
It's time to say enough is enough. In the race to make engineers know more about engineering, electives in the liberal arts and business have been forgotten. En­gineers are allowed two free electives in all their four years here. One can certainly question whether en­gineers -especially freshmen -will have the time or energy to meet the new requirements. But more fun­damental, one has to wonder where Notre Dame's pledge to liberal education has gone. 
We sympathize with the College of Engineering's yearning to make the curriculum more demanding and comprehensive. The battery ofchanges, such as requir­ing aerospace engineers to take Heat Transfer or adding one more semester each of organic and physical chemistry to the load ofchemical engineers, together add up to one way of making the Notre Dame engineer more competitive in industry. 
But before jumping on the bandwagon of cramming more into a curriculum than can fit into four years, it must be remembered that engineering is more than just crunching equations and staying up past 2 a.m. The Notre Dame engineer has always been competitive be­cause of the special dimension of education subtly of­fered here. 
We are afraid the new curriculum will keep engineers too busy to realize that.

Alcohol ban cannot solve problem 
It is called the Committee on the Respon­sible Use of Alcohol. Its name may sound harmless, but this organization is presently debating changes in policy which could dramatically alter Notre Dame life. Ifthis does 
'RandyFahs 
Friday analysis 
indeed become a dry campus, there will be many repercussions and it may not even make a dent in the·.alcohol abuse problem. In some instances, campus prohibition may actually exacerbate the situation. 
The thing·! find most appalling is that the committee fS"'debating under a veil ofsecrecy. At the first lecture in the Accent Series, the committee chairman, Father William Beauc­hamp, wouldn't even allow an open forum for discussion. He arrogantly replied that there would be "at least a question period, I don't know if we'll give answers or not." 
America prides itself on being a nation which encourages frank and open exchanges between the government and the governed. The University's leadership prefers to ignore these time honored practices. The Ad­ministration continues to make campus policy in the secrecy of their ivory tower (or should I say Golden Domed Cloister?). 
It is irrese9J!.Slbl£J.o make such decisions without a deepstuOy of the problem. Such a study should involve campus surveys to find the nature of the alcohol problem, its extent, and what might be done to curb its ill effects without spawning new and unwanted conse­
quences. 
The people conducting and analyzing this study should come from a cross section ofad­ministrators, faculty members and students. In addition, this panel should be heavily laden with people trained in addressing alcohol­related problems. 
The mere fact that someone is an ad­ministrator, a student body president, or a priest, does not make them qualified to be an expert on problems of alcohol abuse. Also, one wonders what this committee is trying to hide behind their wall ofsecrecy. 
It wouldn't surprise me a bit ifthe commit­tee came to a decision and sprung it on the campus at a time when students would be unable to respond effectively. Notre Dame does not like public outcry or demonstrations against official University policy. 
The decision probably will be made public 
immediately prior to break or exam week. At 
these times the students would be paralyzed 
by other concerns and unable to mount a 
unified an!;~, credib!c;,p~;~st. """'­
The time for action is now, not after a deci­sion has been reached. While debate is still going on, the minds ofthe people on the com­mittee can be swayed, but after a public state­ment has been released, the policy will become frozen in the minds ofthe administra­
tion and change will become nearly impos­
sible. 
Our student leadership is partially 
paralyzed with Brian Callaghan being given a 
gag rule by the committee. His co;optation is 
not his own fault. It is better that he be in on 
the meetings to communicate his personal 
views as a student, than to have no student 
representative at all. 
We need a unified voice and I suggest that it 
come from the residence halls by way of Hall 
Presidents' Council. This group can coor­
dinate and articulate what the student want. 
To ease the problem of alcohol abuse we need a three-pronged approach: 1 ) There has to be an i'ncreased awareness of alcohol and the effects of its abuse. 2) Encourage the responsible use ofalcohol in social settings. 3) Identify and help those people who have alcohol-related problems. A dry campus will accomplish none ofthese things.

21 campus 
DearEditor: 
Presently I am shocked over the rumor that 
the University of Notre Dame is going to 
become a 21 campus. I grieve for the ND/SMC 
students, who are likely to be killed or serious­
ly injured because ofthis decision. 
Surely the committee does not expect stu­
dent s under 21 years of age to sit in their 
rooms on a Saturday night sipping soda and 
watching the ever-stimulatingDukes ofHaz­
zard. 
In making their decision they were ob­
viously concerned with both the alcoholic 
and the abusive drinker. However, with the new policy, I sincerely believe that the num­ber of these will not diminish. Instead of , confining themselves to their dorm and room,

these people will climb into their cars and take to the streets, creating a far more dan­gerous situation for a far greater number of people, including the innocent. 
The University may become indirectly the butchers of its own ND family. I regret that I cannot offer any solution to the alcohol abuse problem, however, I know that a 21 campus is a step in the wrong direction. 
I know that next year I will certainly join the mobs of students heading off-campus to get to the social life. (Which is not, contrary to the committee's conception of student social life, synonymous with excessive drinking.) 
All I can say is that I hope to God that it will not be my parents who are awakened at 4:30 in the morning by a phone call informing 
them  that  their son  has been  killed by  a  
drunken motorist.

Letters to a Lonely God The Christian soldier  
by Rev. Robert Griffin features columnist  
During Vit-tnam, I did my share ofprotesting, beating the drum for pt.·ace, passing out roses at Mass. I was supporting young people whose anger with the war was greater than my own. I was also a campus minister answerahle to ROTC <:adets who had consciences too. Ididn't want them to feel rejected hecause oftheir opinions ofa controversial war. Stt.·ve, who had lost a hrother in Vietnam, belonged to Army ROTC in the yetrs after the war. lie loved to write articles defending the "just war" theory, the idea of the "Christian soldier." and the ap­propriateness of having ROTC at Notrt· Dame; unfortunately, he did it badly, hn:aust.· he was a long-winded hore. I hated being lectured on how an oftlcer looks after tht.· welfare of his men. A twenty-year old has no right to he so pompous. Steve, after a tour ofduty in Korea, left the army, convinced that wht.·n war came. we would lose to the Russians. Latcly, in reading, I've run across ideas that remind mt.· ofSteve. I'm ready with the topics fi>r a convnsation with Steve, ifhe lets me get in a word nlgt.·wisc. World War I. which killed I 7 million people, dividt.·d the world in­to "hdi>re" and "after," converting the spiritual landscape into Eliot's Wastcland. At the Battle of the Somme, the British walked upright toward the (;erman line, each man carrying 66 pounds of t'quipmt.·nt. Tht· tnemy cut tht·m down with machine guns. A Ger­man eye witness said: "Th~: British cam<..' walking, as though they wne going to the theater. We ft.· It they were mad." It was simply a massacrt.·. The hattie was costly in illusions too. The cream ofBritish manhood was shattered in less than six hours. A foot soldier said: "From that moment all my religion died." Faulkner, accepting the Nohl'l Prizt.·, said: "Man must teach him­self that the basest ofall things is to be afraid; and, teaching himself that, forget it fi>rt.·ver, leaving no room in his workshop for anything hut the old verities ofthe heart: love, honor, pity, pride, compassion, sanifice..." Freeman Dyson, writing in last week's "New Yorker." notes: pacifist movements flourished after WWI; disarmament programs enjoyed wide support. The fear ofa repetition ofWWI was almost universal. But, human beings are not willing to let their lives be ruled Vt.'f)' long by fear. Pride, anger, and impatience are stronger passions than fear. Adeep force in the human spirit drives us to fight for our freedom and hang the consequences. Even the fear of nuclear holocaust is not strong enough to prevail against this force. Ifwe want to save the world from nuclear war, we must begin win­ning over the soldiers. It is not enough to organize scientists, physicians, clergymen, or even mothers. We need to persuade the soldiers in all countrit.'s that they cannot fight decently with nuclear wt·apons. The elimination of nukes must be presented as a response to the demands ofmilitary honor and selfrespt·ct. not fear. Ifsoldiers <.:an be turned against nuckar weapons, then civilians and politicians will be ahk to campaign ti>r disarmament without being considered cowardly or unpatriotic. Warriors have a tradition of marching into battk to defend the honor of the tribt·. Pacitlsm is another tradition with a long, honorahle history. The Quakers, allowing no authority to eome be­twet·n tht· conscience and (;od. refuse to bear arms. The great adlievt·ment of the Quakers was tht· abolition ofslavery. It was not the work of Quakers alone, hut th~: earlkst agitators wer1: mostly Quakt·rs. A recently puhlisht·d book tells the story ofa French village that d10se the path of nonviolent resistance against Hitler. A German major, who happt.·nnl to he a Catholic, spared the village, afterwards saying: "This kind ofresistance had nothing to do with violence, no­thing to do with anything we could destroy with violence." You die for your hdids. apparently uselessly, but your death reaches out and touches your enemies. so that they ht·gin to hchave like human ht'ings. Some of your t'nt·mies arc convcrtt·tl into friends. Finally t·vcn the most hardened ofvour enemies are persuaded to stop their killing. It happt·nt·tllikt· th;;t, once upon a time in a French village. c;t·orgt· Bernard Shaw put tht· question at the tnd of his play "Saint Joan": "0 (iod that madst this beautiful earth, when will it he ready to rcn·ivt· Thy saints~ How long, 0 Lord. how long?" Ifwe have to tight wars anti muster armies, Iwould preferofficers who had the advantages ofa Christian education. I always agreed with Steve that ROTC rightfully belongs at Notre Dame.

receptions held in their honor. The 
entire University community is 
invited to these events. This year's 
guests will join such hallowed 
names as Norman Mailer, Kurt Von­

Plimpton. There is no admission 
charge at any of the events. 
As the name may signifY, the Soph­omore Literary Festival is organizt.'d entirely by sophomores. Planning begins almost a year in advance. The students contact the authors, set up transportation, accommodations, meals and receptions; they are responsible for the whole show. This year, the planningcommittee is composed ofa core ofeight sopho­mores, who direct approximatt:ly 30 other students in planning the fes­tival. 
Christine Harrington and Patrick Manson typifY the enthusiasm on the committee. One of Harrington and Manson's goals for the 1984 festival is to make the show more accessible to the student body at large. 
"We're having the receptions on 
campus in the halls this year. In the 
past they were held off-campus. This 
way, students will be encouraged to 
attend," Harrington said. 
"We would like to play up the idea 
of the 'festival,' with plenty ofexcit­
ment and spirit," added Manson.

Heather O'Shea, chairwoman ofthe 
planning committee, will oversee 
special publicity projects aimed at 
gaining a greater awareness ofthe 
event among students. 
" The basic drawing classes of 
Professors Moira Geoffion and Dale 
Mainer were especially helpful to·us. 
We can't wait to reveal their work," 
Harrington reported. 
Now in its seventeenth year, the festival began in I967 as the result one sophomore's interest in William Faulkner. The student organized faculty presentations on Faulkner that year. The next year, actual literary tlgures were invited to share their works, and each year since then, the Festival has grown in size and sophistication. Ifthe enthusiasm and dedicaton ofthe sophomore planning committee is any in­dicaton, this year's festival should be one ofthe best yet. 
A host of new ideas and presenta­tions have been added to the schedule. Saturday, March 3, for ex­ample, will feature students reading from their own works, chosen through a campus-wide contest in

success during the second halfofthe season, adding 7.3 points per game. 
Leading Marquette's attack from the backcourt is 6-6 sophomore Ker­ry Trotter. Trotter, who also sees some playing t time as a forward, is the team's second-leading scorer, with an 11.4 average. He also has helped out the Warriors from the line, hitting 74 percent of his free throws. 
Trotter's mate at the guard posi­tion is Mandy Johnson. The six·foot junior, who is not related to Dwayne, has added 8.3 points per 
game to the Warriors' scoring. 
The first players off the bench for Marquette probably will be 6-5 Ter­ry Reason ( 6. 7 ppg), who plays both guard and forward, and 6-8 front­line player Vic Lazzaretti ( 5.2 ppg). 
The Irish probably will match up to the Warriors with what has become the regular starting lineup since the loss of Kempton and JoJo Buchanan to injuries. That lineup has Jim Dolan and Donald Royal at the forward positions, Ken Barlow at center, and joe Howard and Tom Sluby in tpe backcourt. 
Sluby, the senior captain who will be playillg his last regular·season horQe gan\e tomorrow, is scoring at a clip of t7.5 points per game.

Today and tomorrow 


Wrestlers at NCAA Regionals 
Other Irish players to watch are subs joseph Price., Scott Hicks, and Cecil Rucker. Phelps says that he will be counting on good games from these bench players tomorrow. 
"Hicks and Price have got to be factors," the Notre Dame coach says, "especially ifMarquette zones us." 
Phelps says that his injury-plagued team is finally beginning to play well with the healthy players available. 
"We're just playing with nine guys," Phelps says, "so we don't wor­ry about Kempton or Buchanan anymore. They (the players) are starting to believe in themselves. They're playing their roles and doing the things they can do. 
"It's our last home game," Phelps continues. "Obviously, we want to play well -especially the seniors, Rucker and Sluby." 
Phelps adds a plea to the students to help make tommorow's game a good one for the Irish. The Notre Dame coach asks that all of the fans refrain from throwing anything onto the court during the game. 
"Please don't throw anything on the court," Phelps asks. "Someone could get hurt, we could get a technical, and we should show more class." 
Tomorrow's game very well could be one of those games in which anything can happen, but one thing is almost certain -it will be exciting.

Sports Writer 
With the regular season over, the Notre Dame wrestling team will compete at the NCAA Regionals in Terre Haute today and Saturday. The top three finishers in each weight class plus four wild cards will ad­vance to the NCAA Finals March 8­10 in NewJersey. 
The Irish are pinning their hopes on captain Phil Baty, Mark Fisher, John Krug, and Mike Golic to make the Nationals. 
But, the Irish compete in the West Region, which contains top wres­tling schools like Arizona State and Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo. It is often tougher to make it to the-Nationals than it is to do well at the Nationals. 
Irish coach Tihamer Toth-Fejel is going into the meet cool, calm, and collected. 
"I like not to have expectations," says Toth-Fejel. "If you don't win, then you're disappointed. Ifyou do, then it's no big deal. I don't like to put pressure on my guys." 
Fisher, a senior, will hold Notre Dame's hopes at 126. Once again, Fisher will have to deal with rival Tom Pecora of Marquette. Fisher beat Pecora last weekend, 8-4, in a tri-meet at the ACC to give Fisher a 2-1 career mark against his Mar­quette foe. The win should seed Fis­her ahead of Pecora, which would give him an advantage to m~e Na­tionals. 

"If he doesn't get hurt and wrestles hard," says Toth-Fejel of Fisher, "he should do well." 
A lack of adequate practice time because of late afternoon classes could hinder Fisher's performance. 
"He's been missing out on a lot of drilling," Toth-Fejel says. "That's bad because then he can't work on his mistakes." 
Krug has just come off an im­pressive win against Purdue last weekend. The 167-pound sopho­more has been a mainstay for the Irish all year long, and, after a good week ofpractice, he should do well. 
"This week he has looked really skilled," praised Toth-Fejel. "If he doesn't worry about anything and 
just  wrestles,  something  good  
should happen."  
Heavyweight  Mike  Golic  is  a  

strong contender to make the Finals after being seeded second in last 
year's meet as a sophomore. However, he couldn't compete last year because of a concussion. This year the heavyweight divison con­tains many of the same wrestlers as last year, so Golic's chances look even better. 
"He's healthy," says Toth-Fejel. "But, he needs to set up better. I also wish that he would have wrestled more matches this year." 
Golic has only ·wrestled twelve times this year, so fatigue could be a factor. 
Baty would have an excellent shot at Nationals if it weren't for a knee injury. The knee kept him out oflast weekend's tri-meet, and he couldn't practice Wednesday. For this reason, he is a big question mark for the Irish. 
Toth-Fejel is going to have the trainers at Indiana State do a special wrap on Baty's knee that will allow him to wrestle. If he can't wrestle, though, senior Matt Brown will take his place at I 77. 
Toth-Fejel will have a surprise for the other schools at the meet: Scott Biasetti. The 142-pound freshman probably won't get to the Finals, but he should create some noise.

Excels in two sports 

Golie a winner in wrestling also 
ByJOE BRUNETII 
Sports Writer 
The two-sport athlete is a rare 
<-·ommodity in college athletics. The 
high level of competition makes it 
difficult for an athlc:te to excel in one 
sport, let alone two. But, junior Mike 
Golic has excelled both on the foot­
hall t1eld and the wrestling mat. 
Often athlc:tes excel at two sports 
in high school. hut arc unable to 
compete in both at the college level. 
That hasn't stopped Golie. 
"When I came here, Coach Faust 
said that if I wanted to wrestle, I 
could," says Golic. ''I'm happy I did 
because of how well it tics in with 
ti)()thall." 
Golic likes the way that foohall 
and wrestling complement each 
other. 
"Wrestling and football are like 
one," Gulic says. "But I think that 
wrc:stling hc:lps football more than 
!()()tball helps wrestling." 
"Wrestling hc:lps your endurance, 
quickness, foot speed, balance, and 
lc:vcrage. There are a number of 
things that you can do on the mat 
which you can incorporate on the 
fic:ld in a one-on-one situation." 
Although he says he likes footb all 
more, Golic admits that he really en­
joys wrestling. 
"I love it a nd Iwant to do it for as 
long as I can," says the Dillon Hall 
junior. "I like the one-on-one com­
petition with another person. In 
foot hall if you make a mistake it may 
go unnoticed, but in wrestling it's 
you against another guy. You either 
win or lose because of something 
you do." 
Golic's interest in wrestling started by watching his brother Bob wrestle. Bob both wrestled and played football for Notre Dame, and he now plays football for the Cleveland Browns in the NFL. 
"My brother Bobby started me in 
grade school," says the Irish 
heavyweight. "Then I started watch­
ing him in high school. I started 
watching him when I was in the 
dghth grade just to see if I'd like it, 
and it turned out that I loved it." 
As a high school wn:stler, Golic 
posted an incredible 7 4-14 record at 
St. Joseph lligh School in Willowick, 
Ohio. He also placed third in the 
state wrestling tournament. 
After being recruited by such top 
football schools as Penn State, lJCLA, 
Alabama, and USC, Notre Dame 
remained hi!> first choice. 
"I was exposed to it through Bob­
by and Greg (a brother who also plays football for Notre Dame)," says Golic. "I came here to watch Bohhy and Grq~ (play football). They in· troduccd me to people here, and I · really liked the people and the 
school." 
Golic didn't wrestle: his freshman 
year at Notre Dame so that he could 
take some time off after football. 
Wrestling for his first time on the 
college levella.~t year, Gollc posted a 
shining 24-2-1 mark for the Irish a.~ 
tht· lone Notre Dame heavyweight. 
"I rt·ally had no idea what to ex­
pc.:ct in college wrestling," com­
ments Golic. "Even after watching 
Bobby I still didn't know what to ex­
pect. I wasn't sure what was going to 
happen." 
Golic opened his collegiate career 
last year against Valparaiso. Not only 
did he win his match, but Golic 
broke the school record for the fas­
test pin with a pin just 14 seconds 
into the match. The old record of 19 
seconds had been set in the 1971·72 
season by Mike Fanning. 
"Bobby helps my moves,'! Golic 
says. "Greg gets my head going and 
gets me a little mean. Before the 
match (against Valparaiso), Greg got 
me going real good. I used a move 
Booby taught me, and the guy just 
fell right. It was a lot ofluck, too." 
Golic's size, 6-5 and 250-pounds, 
provide him with an advantage on 
the mat. It also complements his 
unique style. 
"I think being taller is an ad­vantage because it allows you to use your leverage a little better," says Golic. "I like to shoot, and most heavyweights aren't used to that. So I try to usc shooting and quickness in my style instead of going upper body and using strength on these guys." 
This year Golic has only wrestled in twelve matcht·s because of a shoulder injury from football and the Liberty Bowl. But he has been su­perb when he has wrestled, posting an 8-0 record in dual meets and a I I· I mark overall. I-I is one loss came in the National Catholic Collegiate Tournament. 
"The one loss is something not to be happy about," says Golic. "Losing just doesn't sit well with me because of the way I was brought up. My father taught me that when you do something you do it to be the best at it. When you lose, you fail some­where." 
Having only wrestled twelve matches this year has hurt Golic's conditioning, and his performance at Regionals this weekend may be hampered by fatigue. 
"I have to try and get through them (the Regionals ), and not make myself get tired, if that's possible," Golic says. "It's a mind game now. I'm not in the shape I should be in, so the mental aspects are going to come into it now." 

Last year Golie was seeded second 
at the Regionals, but he could not 
compete because ofa concussion he 
suffered only a few days before the 

meet. He would like to make it to the 
Nationals, but, in order to do that, he 
must finish in the top three in the 
heavyweight division. 
"I'm going for that (Nationals)," says Golic. "That's the goal I'm set· ting for myself. I have a positive at­titude that I'll do well and go to Nationals." 
Golic's attitude on burn-out, a problem that most athletes suffer from, is unique. 
"Sometimes I get worn-out, but then I try to realize that I'm not here for that long·of a time," comments Golie. "Four years is a shot in the dark compared to the rest of your life, so I'm trying to do as much as I can before I graduate. 
Golic would like a football career in the future, but he is not counting on it, as indicated by his st~rious ap­proach to academics. 
"If the opportunity comes up to keep playing football, I'd like to do that," says the management major. "If not, I'll usc the degree I'll get from here and find a job in the busi­ness world." 

"Academics is always first," Golic says. "You have to put time into it academically. That's always been something my father's reminded me about."

Women close at home 
Tomorrow night's women's basketball game between Notre Damt and Xavier will he the last opportunity to see Mary DiStanis­lao's team in action in the ACC this season. The Irish, who will t1nish the season with four consecutive road games, must pick up a win 
over tht· Musketeers ofCoach Laurie Massa if they hope to have any chance of t1nishing over .SOO for the season. They presently have a I 0-I .3 record. 
The gamt" will also mark the tina! ACC performance for co-captain Theresa Mullins and Jenny Klauke. The two St"niors were members of DiStanislao's t1rst team at Notre Dame, and Klauke also has the daim of being the first woman to receive an athletic grant-in-aid to attend Notre Dame. 
As far as Xavier is concerned, the Irish must stop the Musketeers' high-scoring front line ofJo Ann Osterkamp, Judy Smith, and Stacey Land. The trio is combining for an averagt' ofalmost 4 3 points and 16 rebounds a game. Osterkamp leads the scoring with her 16.8 averagt', while Smith is Massa's leading rebounder, pulling down more than eight rebounds a game. 
Tht' Xavier hackcourt is filled by seniors Chris Hart and Ann Clarke, with freshman Shannon Sowers coming offthe bench. Hart's specialty is passing to her teammates inside (five assists per game), hut she is also the biggest offensive threat ofthe three as she averages about seven points a game. 
the Warriors dropped one in overtime to Xavier by 14 points to halt a four-game winning stn:ak. 
Notre Dame coach Digger Phelps says that Marquette's loss last night is not indicative of what the War­riors arc able to do. 
"Marquette is a very unpredict­
able basketball team," Phelps says. 
"They can heat Louisville, then turn 
around and lose to Xavier. I think 
you'll sec the team that beat Louis­
ville here Saturday." 

Phelps said yesterday that the 
Xavier loss may even help the War­
riors. 

"That (loss) is only going to in­spire them coming in here,'" he said. "They'll play with a lot oft'motion." 
In addition to that emotion, tht' Warriors have a large stort' of talent. Coach Rick Majerus has three players with scoring avt"rages in the double digits and a couple ofothers who are not far behind. 
The Warriors' leading scorer is forward Dwayne "DJ" Johnson. The 6-6 junior is averaging 14.1 points per game on S3 percent shooting from the floor. In addition, Johnson pulls down an average of 6. 7 rebounds per game for Marquette. 
Joining Johnson on the front line is 6-7 forward Marc Marotta. Marot­ta, a two-time Academic All­American, has been cotributing an average of 10 points and 6.5 rebounds in each Marquette outing. 
Rounding out the big men is the biggest ofthe Warriors. At 6-10, 245­pounds, center Tom Copa resembles Notre Dame's injured "rock" in the middle, Tim Kempton. Copa, who is only a freshman, has been instrumental in Marquette's

t> II office these days. In fact, Phelps is probably more r laxt"d than ht' as been in a good while. Maybt' he has cllowcd after 1.3 years at Notre Dame, but he also r alizcs that he has no control over the team's two jor problems -injuries and awful foul shooting. He

The team seemed to me apart at the worst times, usually at the foul line. ally, over the semester break, Sluby took over as the rson to turn to when the team needed a basket, and Howard came off the bench to act as a spark plug. 
cr losing to Washington at the foul line, the team t( >k off, with the win over Maryland showing the Irish a their best. 

After tht' Maryland game, a tournament hid looked e a good bet. But that quickly changed when mpton, JoJo Buchanan, and Dolan all became hhlt"d with injuries. Kempton's injury was the most d maging, however. He may not have the best hands in t c world, but, as Phelps said after the DePaul game, he is the "rock" of the team. His incredibly physical pl~y u 
dcr the basket was making rt'hounding easier for yers like Dolan and Ken Barlow. He would take two 
ponents out of t"ach play and was the major reason t Notre Dame had one of the highest rebounding rgins in the country. With Kt"mpton's 6-9, 240-pound body out of the li eup, the Irish have been unable to play the tough, physical game that had carried them to the 14-5 record. Quickly, all the momentum that the team had gained was lost. Notre Dame is now a team of lean front-line players trying to play the same type of game that it played with a bulkier front line. As the second halfofthe DeP.iul game showed, the Irish do not have the ability to dominate the boards anymore -at least not against a decent team. 
With such problems like injuries and poor foul shoot­
ing, it would be easy just to say that it wasn't Notre 
Dame's year. But you still can't help but wonder what 
the team could have done with a more rapid style of 
play. After all, most of the current players seem better 
suited for a quick transition game. Sluby, Cecil Rucker, 
and Howard all came from the run-and-gun high school 
leagues around Washington, D.C. Scott Hicks, Donald 
Royal, and Barlow also arc used to a quick pace. Even 
Dolan, who is not known for his speed and agility, could 
fit in because he is an excellent passer for a big man. 
If there is one major criticism of Phelps, it is that he 
takes players out of their style of play and makes them 
play the slower, defense-oriented game which is Notre 
Dame's trademark. If the team was winning consistent­
ly, nobody would complain, hut this year will be the 
third in a row that the team doesn't go to the NCAA 
Tournament. 
This is not to say that a faster pace would produce any Jetter success, but, at this point of the season, it might 11ot hurt to see what would happen. Notre Dame un­doubtedly will be offered a spot in the NIT even if it finishes 16-12. Chances arc that the Irish will even get to play a round or two at home, especially since the student body will be here for the first round. And, with speedster Dave Rivers expected to play a major role next St"ason, it appears that the Irish arc destined to speed things up in the upcoming years. 
After these last three seasons, it can't hurt to try.

By ED DOMANSKY 
Sports Writer 
When the Notre Dame hockey team takes the icc tonight and Satur­day at the ACC for its non-league series with the University of Michigan-Dearborn, it will mark the final regular-season homcstand for 1983-84. 
Only the Central States Collegiate Hockey League playoffs remain. But this series will have special meaning for the Notre Dame players as they welcome their mothers and fathers for the traditional "Parent's Weekend," which honors the parents for the support and guidance they have provided over the years. Both the players and their parents will be introduced in a rt"d­carpct ceremony prior to Saturday's contest. 
Notre Dame seniors Tony Bonadio, Joe Bowie, Mike Metzler, and Adam Parsons will be making their last appearances in regular­season action. Head manager Mike Keenan also will be recognized for his services to the team. 
Both games begin at 7:30p.m. 
The Irish come into the series with a 21-3-1 record. The Wolves arc 16-18. Both teams are trying to get back on the winning track. Notre Dame is coming off a pair of losses, 6-5 and 6-4, at the hands ofAlabama­Huntsville, while Dearborn was crushed by Central Collegiate Hock­ey Association power Bowling Green by scores of 11-3 and 10-2. 
"They arc definitely one of the better teams we face," says Irish head coach Lefty Smith. "Based on our loss ofkey people to injuries and ineligibility, I think we go in as the underdog this time." 
The two teams last met over Thanksgiving in Dearborn, and Notre Dame swept the Wolves by scores of 6-4 and 4-3. Tim Reilly scored two goals in the Friday en­counter and co-captain Brent Chap­
man added the hat trick on Saturday 
to pace the Irish attack. 
Since November, Dearborn has 
faced stiffcompetition from many of 
the CCHA teams. Notre Dame, on 
the other hand, has had little trouble 
breezing through its CSCHL 
schedule and in knocking off varsity 
opponent Lake Forest three out of 
four times. 
"Playing the whole year at the club lt'vcl hasn't really challenged us,'' says Notre Dame sophomore Gary Becker. "Playing against teams with abilities less than your own can bring your own skills down. Huntsville caught us a little off guard, so it will be a real test to sec if we can bring out the talent we had earlier in the season. We'll really he up for (Dearborn)." 
Seven of Dearborn's 18 losses have been by one goal, a good in­dication that it is capable ofplaying a fast, aggressive style ofhockey. 
"We will have to play a lot closer checking game," says Tom Part'nt. "We'll also have to take advantage of all our scoring opportunities." 
As far as Notre Dame scoring is concerned, Chapman continues to lead tht' team with 25 goals and 35 assists. His lincmate, Parsons, is next with 26 goals and 31 assists. Bob Thebeau is third with 42 points on 16 goals and 26 assists. 
Missing from the Irish lineup be­cause of injuries will be Steve Whitmore, who is still nursing a thigh contusion suffered at Pt"nn State, Ht" may be ready next wt'ekcnd for the <"SCfiL playoffs. Dcfenscman Rob Ricci re-dislocated his right shoulder last weekend and will be out for the rest of the season. 
Tim Lukenda will start in tht' Notre Dame goal tonight. Ht" has a I 1-.3 rt"cord and a 3.20 goals against avcragt'. Smith has yt't to name a starter for tomorrow.
