Saturday mornings 
Logan Center wrorkers care, give 
by Maty Fran Callahan Senior StaffReporter 
Every Saturday morning, some students get up early to get knots out of shoelaces, run after stray basketballs, sing songs, glue, color, fill balloons and play catch. They are volunteers at Logan Center, a facility operated for the retard­ed "kids," as the volunteers say. 
Logan ''kids'' range in age from 2-57 and are just as diverse in their mental abilities. 
Marcy. a 20-year-old kid who prides herself on selling 131 boxes of Girl Scout cookies outside the stadium on a foot­ball weekend, strolled about the Logan gym telling jokes to any volunteer who would lend an ear. "What's green and flies? Super Pickle," she jokes. ''I'll worry the day she stops telling jokes," volunteer Jane Trusela exclaimed. ''That's just Marcy,''. another volunteer added. 
Then there is Jenny. She is an institutionalized autistic (mentally deficient and totaly withdrawn) four-year-old con­fined to a wheelchair who required seven months of train­ing to grasp a spoon and lift it from table to mouth. 
Damian Doland, Logan vol­unteer, accounted for the kids' diversity. According to Doland, some live with their families and come to Logan only on Saturdays. More severe cases attend Logan School during the week while the profoundly re­tarded individuals are institu­tionalized at a nearby hospital.

The CLC will undoubtedly pass a new University party proposal at their next meeting, according to Bill Roche, Stu­dent Body president. 
Th<f CLC has been unable to pass the proposal at the past two meetings because they lack­ed.a quorum. "The CLC has a high quorum requirement,'' Roche said. "If five out of twenty members miss the meet­ing, we don't have a quorum. We technically have enough members present to discuss issues. Fifteen members have been present at the past two meetings. The problem isn't as bad as it's believed to be.'' 
Frank Guilfoyle, Student Gov­ernment liason of the CLC, agree that the quorum problem is not a serious one. "One of the reasons we lacked a quorum at the past two meetings is that two or three rectors went on retreat. They sent in alter­nates, but the alternates can't 
· officially vote and therefore don't count for a quorum. There is also a teach and a couple of recors who have not been attending the meetings.:·

jaded Cllmrades, $50 million in ransom, worldwide publication of a manifesto and safe conduct out of the country. 
A high-ranking government source said· Saturday that the government was prepared to offer the guerrillas safe conduct out of the country. 
The Bogota newspaper Fi Tempo reported yesterday that two M-19 members are in Panama to discuss the Panama­nian government's offer to grant political asylum to the guerrillas. 
Justice Minister Hugo Escobar Sierra, speaking on the national radio network before yesterday's negotiations began, said that ''The government will be very prudent, very careful, in order to rescue the hostages alive." 
But the van was parked within range of guerrilla sharp­shooters 10side the embassy and government soldiers sta­tioned around the corner from 
George Bush, campaigning in Massac;husetts.n{u. ,tha~ •stqte's presidential primary Tuesday. 
Despite Ford's hint of de­ciding by April 1 whether to enter the race, Bush pre­dicted that Ford would not make a move for the nomi­nation unless and until a dead­lock developed at the party's national convention in Detroit next July.

the cul-de-sac leading to the embassy building. 
The guerrillas are believed armed with grenades, rifles, ami machine guns. The 
sl)ldiers are carrying M-1 rifles of World War II vintage and tear gas launchers. 
The government identified its negotiators as two depruty 

t~Jrcign ministers, Retired Col. 
Rcmiro Zambrano and Camilo 
Jimcnez. The guerrillas were represented by a woman mem­ber of the M-19 guerrilla move­ment and Mexican ambassador Ricardo Galan, one of the dqJiomats being held.

ized should the nnk be dosed. 
"South Bend residents and 

Notre Dame alumni pledged 
funds for the ACC for five 
years," Hesslin~ said. "We 
feel that hockey ts a necessary 
sport here. Representatives of 
organizations from Elkhart and 
Granger have come to me with 
petitions in support of the 
team.·· 
There was overall dis­appointment in the administra­tion for delaying the decision on hockey scholarships until May 2 since most letters of intent from other university hockey teams must be signed by mid-April. 
One :-,pecrator added that the delayed decision puts added pressure on the ream. "They go out and win games, not knowing whether they will be able to play next year.'' . 
According to Roche, the new policy takes .existing rules and updates and clarifies them. ''There are no major changes in the policy, only improve­ments," Roche said. · 
One point in the proposal allows halls to receive exemp­tions from existing guidelines. "Parties such as the Pop Farley party are not accounted for in th~/resent guidelines," Roche sa1 . 
The proposal also suspends the time requirement for party rooms. 
''The biggest change in the present policy is regarding 
private room parties,',-Roche said. "We don't see why there should be a limit to the number of guests allowed at a private room party, as long as the fire 
laws are obeyed.'' 
According to Fr. Van Wolvear, Vice President for Student Af­fairs, a compromise is possible in the issue of private room parties. 
The next meeting of the CLC will be next Monday. If the proposal is passed, it will \be presented to Van Volvlear, who will decide whether to accept or reject it and return it with his decision in two weeks.

comments Dear Ediiur: As on~ who is an avid follower Of Notre Dame, not only of srvrtS but more impor­tantly o the excellence rhe University stands for and hope­fully instills in the students I'd like to make a few comment~ on the ''seeming'' controversy over the lack of scholarships for some sports. First, some of the rather "personal" attacks that have been made at Father Joyce are ~ot only_ unfair, but totally trresponstble. Anyone the least bit familiar with his record ar the University know the welfare uf the student body is always his major priority. Secondly, a lot of the concern seems to be over money, as well it should be. But at the same time it appears not nearly enough attention has been gi­ven to directives of HEW and Title IX, and as a city council­man, I can assure you federal directives that never seem to be ;>Ublicized can make a total mess out of the most sensible of things. My concern is for the Uni­veristy and what is best for the ma'or,tiy of t_h~ student bc:td~,  Madonna }. Chnstensen Fr.Hesburgh is smiling Dear Editor: Fr.. Hesburg~ is smiling. Why IS he smilmg? Well, his dream is coming true. Fr. Hesburgh's vision of making Notre Dame the great bastion of Catholic education is close at hand. Some time ago he placed control ofthe school in the hands of lay trustees. Then came co-education. And now he has his $160 million. The second f~nd drive is coming. The new wmg to the engineering build­ing has been completed at great cost. Construction is now underway for an addition to Nieuwland. New dorms are going up. Your brothers and sisters are no longer getting in with ease; the requirements for admission become more strin­gent with each passing year. Soon Notre Dame will be able to rub noses wjth the Ivy League. But the spirit of this institu-· tion must not be sacrificed in the process. It seems that Fr. ~esburgh has been blinded by  Shuttleunreliable Dear Editor: I am writing about the shuttle service bet\yeen Saint Mary's and Notre Dame. Recently I was enrolled in a course at Saint Mary's, but I was forced to drop it because I could not get to class on time_ Riding the shuttle was very frustrating for me. I found that one day I would be a few minutes late for class, and the next day I would be twenty minutes late. There was no consistency in the departures from the Library Circle and the arrivals at Saint Mary's. The reason for lack of consistency was that some bus drivers made longer stops than others. One driver would wait two minutes at the circle, while another would Stop 5-15 minutes. To help alleviate the pro­blem, I suggest that bus drivers follow the schedule strictly. Also, I believe waiting times at the Library and Mairi Circles should be short and the same length. If these points were followed, it would allow com­muting students to get to classes closer to starting times.  ral~t•ntn~ by pnce, Kennedy is that the Soviets respect advocat mg gasoline rationing st rcngth, bL!l he also realizes hy coupon...

Letters 
John Barth 

Putnam and Sons 
16.95 
areview by Mark E. Rust 
Having stvpped <lf at this point in your daily perusal of The Ob­server long enough to read this sentence, you no doubt have a purpose in mind. Either you rea­lize John Barth will be with us on campus next week and, being .somewhat unfamiliar with his work, 
you seek fresh, relevent information, 
or you know Mr. Barth's worK 
and are wondering what great in­
sights we can bring to bear on his 
latest offering, Letters. I have 
neither. This purports to be, how­
ever, a book review, and I am 
fully aware that one needs neither 
relevant information nor great in­
sights to be a critic --the prece­
dents are numerolls. Letters is 
not about anything; the only plot 
line is the one you invent for 
yourself as you read the marvel­
ous letter collection of which this 
book is composed. The traditional 
first • and second levels of meaning 
(or its rough equivalent), therefore, 
do not exist. And be assured, 
dear reader, this is one literary 
work which will never appear on 
any list of "required high school 
novels." 

Letters is fun to read. The in­div;dual letters are, as a rule, much more coherent than other absurdist works, and even if one is not familiar with the origins of the characters one may still appreciate their stories and their view of them­selves. There are no hidden "mean­ings" but there are plenty of hidden pathways, connecting one character with another, one generation with the next, and one event in his­wry with re-definitions of other e­vents. The book is, as Mr. Barth puts it, "an old rime epistolary novel by seven fictitious drolls and d~eamers each of which imagines himself actual.'' Simply that. If, at the end of the book, you im­agine them actual, so much the better: Mr. Barth has succeeded in creating life rather than re­creating, and that, it seems to me, is what makes him an artist. 
To talk about Letters one needs to talk about both Mr. Barth and absurdlst fiction. The book is an "epistolary" novel --one composed of letters --and the characters 
~ho write the letters have stepped 
nght out of Mr. Barth's previous 
fictions or relate directly to one of 
those characters. Readers of Lost 
in the Funhouse remember Ambrose 
Mensch, as well as Peter and 
Magda, and they appear in Am­
brose's letters. Todd Andrews, 
from The Floating Opera, gets lots 
of space, as does the Mack fam­
ily in general. Mensch has grown 
older and less inhibited (mercifully), 
taking on an older, learned lover. 
Finally: a real mensch! And the 
Macks --ah, the Macks --ex­
pand now from the original nucleus 
of Jane and Harrison to include 
son Drew, a sixties radical (what 
else) and daughter Jeannie, a B­
movie actress who qualifies for 
glitterati status, apparently by vir­
tue of her father's wealth. 
In Letters, Barth may do what he does best: create his own world, fill it to the brim with brilliant characterizations, even re-writes his­tory, a task he assigns one of his mo~t enigmatic characters. In cap­tunng the stream of his character's consciousness --a thing facilitated by the letter framework --Barth endows his book with the texture or a world very different than the realist's. Joyce uses the stream of consciousness technique to bring us boiled cabbage and Catholicism: Barth uses it to create a funhouse. Mr .. Barth is James Joyce with a grm. 
Proceeding from one literary bla pheme to the next, I v.:ould also compare this fictitious collection to the Canterbury Tales. Both rely first and foremost on the depth and breadth of their characters, both use an ancient framework to bring the reader their charac­ters' tales, and both are blessedly bawdy. One can easily imagine Messrs. Barth and Chaucer guz­zling pints of ale and chuckling 
over the imagined political opinions 
and sexual shortcomings of which­
ever poor schmuck happens to be 
within eyesight. That this image 
creates a splendid anachronism 
would please Mr. Barth all the more, 
g!ven his penchant for rewriting 
history. 
This book is best read a letter at a time. It is long --761 pages --and tedious at points, particularly if one is as unfamiliar with the historical allusions as this writer. You will know those points when you arrive there: they seem like some brilliantly conceived in­side joke, the punch line of which depends on some invisible foot­note. If you have ever taken a high school literature course you will more easily note the fun Mr. Barth has with literary academia. (It should be noted that one of Mr. Barth's characters has --once and for all with the aid of a com­puter --composed the schematic diagram for the rise and fall of marrative action.) And, if nothing else, you will enjoy the sexual adventures of Ambrose and Lady Amherst, which are, to say the least, extensive. 
Whatever this book "means", a­bove and beyond all of this, is totally above my head if it ex­ists at all. Mr. Barth has cre­ated a story from seemingly un­connected letters, but it is a story which works only on a plane of timeless reflecting mirrors, connect­ing the past with the future and bending and distorting the present. But, of course, the past is the future, and the present is bent and distorted, is it not?? After looking at the world through the eyes of Mr. Barth, pa~e after page, seven hundred, sixty-one times, you will know only that he is a serious artist and a fine entertainer. That is enough.

WHO recommends: ''There should be no sales rromotion including promotiona advertis­ing to the public of products to be used as breast-milk substi­tutes or bottlefed supplements and feeding bottles." 
Nestle interprets: ''Advertis­ing of an educational nature, which is regarded as beneficial by the state, is allowed. This would include educational and informative posters.'' 
WHO recommends: "Adver­tising or promotional distribu­tion of free samples of breast­milk substitute through health service channels should not be allowed. Artificial feeding should not be openly demon­strated in health facilities.'' 
Nestle interprets: ''Further­more, we would agree to a more selective delivery of samples to the clinics and hope that WHO and UNICEF would instigate precise set rules about this within international code.'' 
WHO recommends: "No per­sonnel paid by companies pro­ducing or selling breast-milk substitute should be allowed to work in the health care system in order to avoid the nsk of conflict of interest.'' 
Nestle interprets: "Each indi­vidual state must decide if it wants to call on people who are employed by the baby food industry, to help imyart infor­mation which wil benefit mothers. To prohibit such individuals from working is unjust because the state does not have at its disposal the

According to WHO, the Nestle Corporation has not met any of the boycott's demands. While they have suspended their mass media advertising, they have not in any way discontinued their direct consumer promo­tion of the products. 
A recent Nestle's newsletter stated that it wholeheartedly supports the final statement presented to them by WHO. ''Our operations are and will be from now on totally consistent with those recommf'ndations," 
said David Guerrant, chairman 
and president of the Nestle 
Company Inc., White Plains, 
N.Y. 

"Nestle intends to move 
forward in every possible way . to continued to play a construc­tive role in the battle against infant malnutrition in the 
world,'' Guerrnat added. 

That Nestle might ''move 
forward in every possible way'' 
is exactly what WHO fears. 

WHO Director General, Dr. 
Halfdan Mahler, stated, 
'Nestle is using their distorted 
interpretations of the recom­
mendations to justify precisely 
pu-.lhJVL'l' as he took blows that 
w_,uld have felled most boxers.

Saturday was a different night, and it appeared for a while that the capacity crowd of 4,287 would expenence a 
different outcome. But Min­nesota came from two goals

The Irish were then forced to play the first 1:59 of the extra period one man short. The Gophers did not waste the power play opportunity as Aaron Broten, freshman bro­ther of Olympian Neal, scored his second goal of the evening j~:~st 57 _:;econds into the over­time.

''Poulin is a key member of our team. When we lose him, it hw.rts us a great deal,'' were the sentiments of Smith after the game, when asked whether Poulin's absence helped contri­bute to the final score. "We just play with too much emotion and not enough thought."

After Poulin's exit, Brown­schidle picked up his second unassisted goal, as a centeriQg pass for the corner caught a defenseman's jersey and caromed into the net. But after that goal the game was all Minnesota's. 
Harrer added two more quick goals to pick up his hat trick and add on to his scoring record sending the game into over­time. 
IRISH ITEMS : Next week­end's games against Michigan, are in effect, one big game. The winner of the series is determined by the two game goal total. The team with the most go:; I advances while the other team is done for the season. 
The Irish wtll not return to the ACC for a game unless there are several major upsets in the playoffs. Notre Dame finishes the regular season with a 13-14-1 WHCA mark and 17-17-1 overall

dropping both games ot the final regular season series ver­sus Minnesota, 3·2 on Friday evening and 8-7 in overtime on Sat,urday. Consequently, the Irish, who stand fifth 111 the final league standings, will travel to Ann Arbor, Mich., for a two game playoff series with Michigan. 
The Wolverines concluded their regular season with a split with Michigan State and finish· ed in fourth place. The Irish won one game and tied another during their last visit to Ann Arbor two weeks ago with both contests decided in nail-biting overtime finishes. 
''Looking on the bright side, maybe it's better we play on the road," said a dejected Irish coach, Lefty Smith, after Sarur· day's loss. "We seem to play better on the road.'' 
Smith was obviously referring to Notre Dame's fine WCHA road record of8-5·1, as opposed to a dismal 5·9 mark in the 
ACC. The highlight of Friday's 3-2 decision was the brilliant play of Gopher goalie Paul Butters. The freshman from Rochester, Minn., turned away a whopping 52 Irish shots. This, combmed with Notre Daml unpro­ductive power play output, was everything Minnesota needed. The Gophers collected eight penalties in the game, but the 
Irish could convert on just one of their opportunities. 
The lone Notre Dame power play goal came off the ~tick of center Tom Michalek with as­sists going to Jeff Brownschidle and Dave Poulin. Butters was partially screened on the play, and Michalek managed to find the lower right hand corner of the net. The score, coming at 
4:56 of the final period, pulled the Irish to within one goal, 3-2. 
But they could not hit the net again in the remaining fifteen minutes of the game.

At 3:58 of the final stanza, right winger Tim Harrer scored to increase Minnesota's lead to 3-1. For Harrer, it was his 42nd goal of the season, breaking the WHCA single-season scoring record set buy Michigan State's Tom Ross during the I 975· 76 
season. 

Michalek's goal pulled the Irish within one once again, but Butters turned away 17 third period shots to secure the Gopher victory.
