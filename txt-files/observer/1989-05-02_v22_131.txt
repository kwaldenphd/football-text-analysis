WORLD BRIEFS

is everyone's concern 
pute with the United States and Britain. Foreign Minister Hans­
Dietrich Genscher was quoted as saying West Germany's argu­ment must have "special weight" because it is the alliance's front line, and a war with such battlefield-range weapons would be fought on its territory. Both the United States and Britain say the negotiations proposed by Chancellor Helmut Kohl might endanger Western security. 
NATIONAL BRIEFS 
The space shuttle Atlantis has been rescheduled for launch by NASA for Thursday afternoon after technicians working around the clock did a "bang-up job" in replacing two faulty fuel system parts. The space agency said that they were optimistic about the launch and gave the signal to start a new countdown Tuesday morning. 
"Bloom County" will be discontiued on Aug. 6, and its creator, Berke Breathed, will begin a new, Sunday-only strip the next month, according to an announcement from the Washington Post Writers Group. Breathed was quoted as saying that "A good comic strip is no more eternal than a ripe melon." Breathed has reportedly been considering discontinuing the comic strip for over a year. 
Thousands of youngsters nationwide went silent Monday when a $7 million science project whisked them to the bottom of the Mediterranean Sea, live and in color. Television screens showed them the satellite-relayed view of a camera-equipped submersible robot being towed over the ocean floor. It was the first of two weeks of live broadcasts to an expected 250,000 stu­dents at 13 museums from British Columbia to Florida. The project suffered a temporary setback last week when the 7-foot­long robot Jason, a newer version of the camera-carrying sub­mersible that explored the sunken ocean liner Titanic, sank among the ruins of an ancient Roman trading ship off the coast of Italy. The project sponsors include Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, Turner Broadcasting System Inc., the National Geo­graphic Society and Electronic Data Systems. 
New gas taxes maybe implemented by the Bush administration despite Bush's "read my lips" pledge against new taxes. The administration is considering higher gasoline taxes for 1991 as part of a possible trade for concessions such as a lower capital 
gains tax, officials said Monday. Bush, however, told the annual meeting of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce that "I mean to live by what I've said: no new taxes." 
INDIANA BRIEFS 
The other day, an incident occured which 
caused me to reexamine exactly why I am 
working at The Observer. 
A professor of mine, in the middle of his lec­
ture to our class, launched into a five minute 
diatribe against The Observer. He lambasted 
our coverage of news events on campus, claim­
ing that The Observer failed to incite students' 
anger over a speaker who is coming to campus 
in the fall. 
It was improper for that professor to waste 
five minutes of our class time expounding on 
his personal views of The Observer. His lec­
tures, in the past, had been interesting and in­
formative; he did not need to try to spice them 
up with a little sensationalism. 
However, this incident raised a larger ques­
tion of attitudes towards campus media sources 
on the Notre Dame and Saint Mary's campuses. 
Another event which highlights the problem 
that exists was the event of WVFI's going off 
the air in the past weeks. Even people at The 
Observer who supposedly are well-informed of 
campus events, much less the average ND stu­
dent, for the most part failed to notice this oc­
curance. 
Campus media at Notre Dame is viewed in 
a poor light by the general community (if it is 
viewed1istened to at all). This is not a phenom­
enon restricted solely to The Observer and 
WVFI; Common Sense, Scholastic, and the 
other student-run media sources are the con­
stant subjects of abuse. 
There are two possible causes of this abuse. 
First, the media sources on campus may just 
be genuinely bad. Second, the media sources 
themselves may be alright; it just may be the 
attitudes of the community members which 
need to be changed. 
If the first cause is true, it is partially the 
fault of those currently in charge of campus 
media, including myself. However, it is also partially the responsibility of those complaining to do something about it. 
With a few exceptions, campus media at Notre Dame and Saint Mary's is entirely student-run. The Observer, for example, has no advisor or professors guiding us ; the only adult who works for or with The Observer is our office manager. This sets us apart from most other school newspapers, who have full-time advisors or faculty members guiding them. As far as I 
OF INTEREST 

'It is entirely up to students to correct their media, if they feel it is lacking in quality or accuracy.' 
Matt Gallagher Executive News Editor 
------------------­
know, other media at Notre Dame also runs with little-to-no direction from non-students (although there are exceptions). 
Thus, it is entirely up to students to correct their media, if they feel it is lacking in quality or accuracy. Almost all campus media sources provide a forum such as The Observer's P.O. Box Qfor such feedback, an outlet which is also available to faculty and staff. Of course, the ideal way for a student who has a complaint regarding a campus media outlet to vent that complaint would be for them to join that media organization and work on fixing it. 
If the second cause for complaints is true, namely poor attitudes on the part of members of the community, it falls on the media to work on correcting those attitudes. The Observer is not the New York Tim~s; we do not pretend to be. Scholastic is not Newsweek; WVFI is not U93. Students haven't the resources or skill to approach that level of journalism. 
However, we do try to do what we do as well as we can. One thing relied upon by the media is feedback from its viewers1"eaders1isteners. A classroom or the dining hall is an inappro­priate forum for complaints about campus media. Not only is it not the function of those environments, but such feedback does not often reach those who can make changes for the bet­ter. It only happened that there were a large number of Observer employees in the class I mention above; if there were not, that profes­sor's valid opinions (however inappropriate the timing) would have never reached the attention of those who can implement changes.

A triple suicide was committed by three young men in North Judson Saturday. Their bodies were found in a Starke County pole barn Saturday. A memorial service was held Monday at Winamac High School for the young men found dead in an ap­parent suicide pact. Autopsies conducted Sunday revealed they died of asphyxiation from carbon monoxide poisoning, according to Coroner Douglas O'Donnell. Derek W. Gilman, 18; Christian 
J. Blameuser, 19; and Douglas R. Frinkle, 20, had tucked suicide notes under the windshield wiper of a car left running in the barn, O'Donnell said.

Student Senate approves Student Activity Fee budget 
By JEFF SWANSON 
Staff Reporter 
The Student Senate approved the Student Activity Fee Budget for the 1989-1990 school year Monday evening. 
The total budget is $410,000, with $149,125 going towards al­locations, $171,425 to the Stu­dent Union Board, and $89,450 for Student Government. 
$63,625 of allocations will go to clubs and organizations. Also included under the alloca­tions heading are the budgets for each class and the Hall Presidents' Council. 
Student Body Treasurer Guy Weismantel said, "There should be no financial trouble next year." He said that there should be a substantial amount of money left over from last year's budget which will be set aside in a carry-over contin­gency fund in the General Ac­counting Office. 
The fund exists for any un­planned events which may re­quire funding, he said. "Ifclubs have a situation in which they need to appeal for more money, the contingency fund may be used," Weismantel said. 
In other business, District 4 Senator Sigi Loya said that the "beautification" of the Mod Quad will take place during the summer. Loy a said that he would. appreciate any sugges­tions that he could pass on to the maintenance department. 
In the process Loya said that the volleyball sand court may be relocated. "The administra­tion does not like residence areas to be used for recrea­tional purposes," he said. 
The senators also announced 
a tentative schedule for a 
shuttle from .the airport and the

Warsaw Solidarity leader Zbig­niew Bujak told the crowd, re­ferring to recent reforms that resulted in Solidarity's legalization and opposition par­ticipation in elections. 
Warsaw's main events were peaceful, but violent clashes were reported in the cities of Wroclaw and Gdansk when militant Solidarity splinter groups held demonstrations in those cities, dissident sources said. Street fighting in Gdansk lasted several hours. 
In the Philippines, police swung truncheons and frred tear gas to break up crowds marching to the U.S. embassy in Manila after a rally in which union leaders threatened a nationwide strike to press for a higher minimum wage. 
Riot police in South Korea frred tear gas in a battle with about 5,000 striking workers in Masan and nearby Changwon after protesters tried to stage a May Day rally, police said. About 200 workers were ar­rested. 
Police said about 6,600 people were arrested in Seoul when police blocked a rally Sunday 
part government protests that broke out during the official May Day parade in Prague. One protester was arrested as he carried a poster of Gorbac­hev, whose reforms go further than those desired by Czechos­lovakia's leaders. 
An additional 18 were ar­rested during rallies in the city of Brno, said activist Anna Sabatova. 
BBC reporter Misha Glenny said he was punched in the face and held for five hours as he photographed an arrest in Prague. Britain's Foreign Of­fice said it would protest to Czechoslovakia. 
In the Soviet Union, an ac­tivist in the Soviet Republic of Armenia said residents in the capital, Yerevan, defied a ban and held a large, peaceful ral­ly. 
May Day celebrations were banned in the Yerevan and Tbilisi, capital of Soviet Geor­gia, because of recent pro­independence unrest in both cities and the devastating earthquake in Armenia.

Kerby in that a union may not be the best solution to the prob­lem of faculty input. "There can be no union," said Gad-el­Hak, "but there should be a greater voice for the senate, so that it has more influence." 
"If it comes to a vote and the union is voted down, that means that the solution is un­acceptable, and there is a bet­ter solution to the problem," said Gad-el-Hak. 
"Perhaps the final answer is in between the union and the present state of the senate," suggested Gad-el-Hak. He said that a group composed like the Faculty Senate, but with the powers of the Academic Coun­cil, might be the best answer.

EDITORIAL 
Students' voices ring out in China 
The protests by more than 150,000 university stu­dents in Beijing, China, have finally drawn the atten­tion of Chinese government officials, who Saturday offered to formally discuss the demonstrators' demands for democracy and greater freedom. 
Adamant about democratic reform, freedom of the press, increased education funding and an end to gov­ernment corruption, the students refused the offer of dialogue. 
To its credit, the Chinese government has permitted the demonstrations to continue and on Saturday generously authorized official media to report the protests, after ignoring the demonstrations for a week. 
But now that China's officials have agreed to hear them out, the students should voice their complaints in formal dialogue. It may be constructive and even produce change. 
The demonstrations have so far been peaceful and well-organized, but the large gathering of angry stu­dents is getting growing support from workers. No doubt Chinese officials are worried the crowd may turn violent. 
Student organizers could allay these fears by sitting down to talk with government officials. Rational dis­cussion of the students' concerns could lead to political and economic progress, perhaps even dismantle the nation's communist system. 
The impact of even limited democracy in China would be enormous, considering more than one billion people live there, next to the world's largest commu­nist power--the Soviet Union. 
One can only guess at the effect a democratic China would have on its communist neighbor. Perhaps one day both nations will accept democracy and make the world's people a unified plurality. 
Chinese students are fighting for rights most stu­dents in the United States take for granted. The demonstrators obviously feel democracy is worth fighting for, maybe enough to die for it. The marchers have made their point in numbers, but they should use the opportunity to put it on paper.

Tuition increase could exclude many from NO 
Dear Editor: 
When my mother called the other night, she asked me if I knew that the university is raising our tuition again. I said "Yes, someone I know just recently wrote a letter to The Observer objecting to the in­crease" (The Observer, April 5). 
Later that night, my mind kept coming back to the subject of the tuition increase. Why didn't the administration reply to the student's letter? Why weren't his questions an­swered? Is it fair for the Uni­
· versity to raise our already enormous tuition further? I have come to the conclusion that raising our tuition will not only hurt the students but it will also eventually hurt the Uni­versity. We will reach the point where no one can afford to at­tend this school. Present stu­dents are already being forced to leave because they can't pay, and prospective students are choosing less expensive and often lesser-acclaimed schools simply because of the price. This situation deprives a large number of students from outstanding educational and social opportunities as well as depriving the University of its most valuable resource, namely top quality students. I state that many students won't be able to afford tuition. Who are these people? The list· 
is extensive. To begin with, to pay a little more. Is that many middle class students what they want? What hap­don't qualify for scholarships. pened to "cultural diversity?"

NO's noted Glee Club gets vocal 
Time and commitment are instrumental to these performers 
LAURA MATTHIAS 
accent writer 
rom JPW Weekend to con­F certs in Europe, the Notre Dame Glee Club has made their voice heard. The club is comprised of all Notre Dame men, and is directed by Carl Starn, who is in his eighth year with the club. 
When asked about the tal­ent of the group, Starn responded that every year he fears the loss of the senior voices from the club, but every year he finds himself wrong. "I didn't think it was possible," Starn said, "but it's gotten better every year." 
Starn demands a lot of dedication in return for his confidence in the voices of his 65-member Glee Club. For one credit and a tuxedo, Glee Club members rehearse five hours every week, and per­form a large number of con­certs at Notre Dame and on the road. About five of the campus performances and most of the road perfor­mances are formal and com­mand black ties. In addition, there are between 15 and 30 informal concerts during the year for clubs, university or­ganizations, and just for fun. 
Touring makes up the larg­est time commitment for members of the Glee Club. This year Starn and his club

n my last article from Ireland, I made some com­ments that received mixed reactions. Many people said that the tone of my article was too negative. Upon reading it over, it became clear to me how that impres­sion could have been evoked. Well, I feel it essential to cor­rect all false impressions. 
All the facts of the previous article still remain the same. My attitude, however, has changed drastically. 
The most crucial and absolutely best part of the Irish culture is, of course, the people. 
Yes, I still have to walk a mile to school. What I didn't mention previously was the scenery I get to see everyday: beautiful pastures with horses, ancient castles, and, if the timing is right, a glorious sunset. 
Yes, I am still occasionally cold. But what I didn't dis­cover was if given enough time, the cold is hardly noticed. It merely becomes a way of life. 
I've discovered that long, hot baths are relaxing.

Phones are an impersonal mode of communication. It is much better to take an enjoy­able walk and visit friends in person. 
I've also discovered that homework isn't as occasional as I had once thought or hoped. But opportunities for creative genious are available with almost every assign­ment. 
The most crucial and ab­solutely best part of the Irish culture is, of course, the people. There is no genuine kindness in the world like that of the Irish. My room­mate, Tracey Pinter, and I hitchhiked to Galway one weekend. Every person who gave us a lift had a piece of advice to offer and we were always wished the best of luck. The last person who picked us up insisted that we stay in his house for the en­tire weekend and we were even treated to free meals in the restaurant he owns. This is a perfect example of the people-loving Irish.

Although the glee club club's most important tours is traditionally noted for its will be their three-week tour rendition of the alma mater of Western Europe next year. and the Notre Dame fight This tour requires the best voices and the most rigorous practice, as it only takes place every third summer. 
Although Glee Club is con­sidered to be an extracur­ricular activity, the members take their music very serious­ly, as one music major, Rob Meffe, explained. He agrees that "club" is considered to be a "good time singing," but also insists that "we are rep­resentative of Notre Dame." As a serious musician, Meffe also sings in the chorale, writes his own music (remember "Simon"?), and pursues choral conducting as his concentration. He is one of Starn's "crazies," the guys who dedicate their time to two choruses, which demand both long rehearsals and yearly tours. 
Sophomore Barry McFar­lande said that, despite the time commitment, he loves Glee Club, and tours with the club yearly. He explained that the members of the club are "really close because of the time we spend together." They even have their own SYR and formal. 
For those students who have yet to hear the Glee Club perform, their next con­cert is May 20th at Stepan Center. The time and talent of the club, and their direc­tor, will make for very enjoy­able evening.

such a great competitor, I knew talents of Pesavento. Mter bat­here, I think I would have gone really well right now," said 
That's something you develop when you come from a family like the Pesaventos. Pat and his twin brother were the last of five Pesavento children to star in the traditionally pow­erful Joliet Catholic athletic de­partment. He was one of three Pesavento brothers to quarter­back the high school football team. Dan Pesavento led the Hilltoppers to one of four con­secutive state football titles before lettering in baseball for four years at the College of St. Francis. Mike Pesavento earned four letters at North Carolina State and entered the Los Angeles Dodgers organiza­tion. 
"Joliet Catholic is like a Notre Dame at the high school level with a lot of tradition in athletics," said Jack Schimanski, Pesavento's high school baseball coach. "He and there was a great future for him in baseball." 
It didn't take long for Notre Dame baseball coach Pat Murphy to realize Pesavento's competitive nature. 
"He said it to me the first day, 'Coach, I'm just sick of losing,' " recalled Murphy, in reference to their first meeting after Murphy took the job in 1987. "He definitely stood out, just the way he handled himself on an athletic field. His com­petitive nature stood out very easily. He was willing to win and tired of losing." 
Pesavento had to endure a lot of losing before Murphy replaced Larry Gallo as coach. While the starting shortstop certainly was producing for the Irish, batting .366 his first year and .339 the second, Notre Dame only managed a com­bined record of 37-57. 
ting in the number-two spot un­der Gallo, he became Notre Dame's leadoff batter. 
Pesavento responded to his new role by setting school records for walks (46), stolen bases (38) and runs (81) in a season. He has 41 walks, 26 stolen bases and 58 runs so far this season, with a .488 on-base percentage. 
"My first two years here, I stole some bases, but I wasn't given the green light like I am now," said Pesavento. "We didn't run a lot. I thought we should have used our speed more. We were just sitting around waiting for things to happen." 
Murphy's aggressive style produced a 39-22 record last season. Those results contrib­uted to Pesavento's decision to turn down a professional offer from the Toronto Blue Jays, (to the pros) for sure," said Pesavento, who also was drafted by the Boston Red Sox in June 1987. "It's just that the style of baseball we play now is so much more fun. 
"I was nine hours short (of graduation). That was someth­ing I really came here to do. I thought there was no reason I wouldn't get drafted higher if I'd just had a consistent year." 
For a while, it looked like he may not have a season compa­rable to his last two. Pesavento started the year 0-for-Texas, going hitless in Notre Dame's season-opening five-game tour of the Lone Star State. Only a couple of weeks ago, his average was down at .304. 
Pesavento has made a com­plete recovery since then, in­creasing his average to .366, batting 9-of-13 last weekend to extend his hitting streak to 10 Pesavento. "I'm hitting the ball to the left side of the field between short and third. If I'm hitting the ball there, I'm hit­ting well. I'm starting to bunt well too." 
It's that kind of determina­tion to improve that has Murphy liking Pesavento's chances in the pros. 
"He's an underrated (prospect)," said Murphy. "He's a guy who will make the adjustments at every level. He may never be the guy who hits .350 in the minors, but who makes all the plays, bats .270 
every  year  and  is  a  good  
baserunner.  He's  a  clutch  
player."  

Notre Dame may have lost a quarterback in Pat Pesavento, but Irish fans couldn't be hap­pier with the results.

The Oakland A's, winner of 104 regular-season games and beneficiary of one of the most potent batting lineups in the past decade, were picked by many so-called experts to sweep the Dodgers in the World Series. 
Idealistic prognosticators granted the Dodgers a fifth game because, well, sluggers Jose Canseco and ~ark ~cGwire were due to have an off-day sooner or later. 
Still, the Dodgers won the World Series in five games thanks to a few guys named Hatcher, Hershiser and Gib­son, only to find themselves picked no higher than third or

Notre Dame made great strides this season in the quest to gain national prominence in women's tennis. Gelfman lauded the freshman on the squad, citing the incredible im­porvement they made over the fourth in most baseball annuals prior to this season. 
Notre Dame, because it lacked a legitimate Heisman candidate, found itself in the unlikely position of underdog heading into football games against ~iami, USC and West Virginia last fall. 
Although the Irish were highly ranked in both polls, the national papers were inun­dated with doubters. Quarter­backs and Heisman contenders Steve Walsh, Rodney Peete and ~ajor Harris were built up to be invincible, while Notre Dame's own Tony Rice out­played all but Walsh in head­to-head matchups. 
But nobody came through in the clutch like defensive end Frank Starns. The fifth-year senior and converted fullback made a name for himself in the big games, something which no doubt made him more attrac­tive to NFL scouts. 
Remember the NCAA tourn­ament? Everybody knew that Arizona, Duke, Oklahoma, Georgetown or Illinois would run away from the field. They had proven themselves over the course of a 30-game schedule and certainly would continue their dominance in the tournament. 
So how did ~ichigan and Seton Hall find their way into the championship game? 
Granted, Seton Hall was a Top-20 mainstay throughout the regular season, but its well of tournament experience was disturbingly dry. Perhaps the

Philadelphia takes 1st game 
Associated Press 
MONTREAL--Ken Wregget continued his sensational relief goaltending as the Philadel­phia Flyers handed Patrick Roy his first home loss of the year, taking Game 1 of the Wales Conference final from the Montreal Canadiens 3-1 Monday night. 
The Flyers, coming off their worst regular season since 1971-72--they were fourth in the Patrick Division at 36-36-8; Montreal was 53-18-9, tops in the Adams--were a decided un­derdog entering the best-of­seven series. But they played a superb positional game, got a short-handed goal from Der-

rick Smith in the first period, another in the third period from Ilkka Sinisalo and the clinching score by Rick Tocchet after Montreal's only goal. 
That made Roy a loser here for the first time since Boston eliminated Montreal from the second round of last year's playoffs. Roy was 35-0-4 at the Forum since that defeat. He 
also  had  won  his  five  
postseason  appearances  this  
spring.  

But he has never beaten the Flyers and couldn't this time as he was outshined by Wreg­get, the Flyers' backup goaltender since being ac­quired from Toronto in March. Wregget replaced injured Ron Hextall and beat Pittsburgh 4-1 in the seventh game of the Patrick Division finals. With Hextall still out with knee liga­ment damage, Wregget came through again, stopping 24 shots. 
Smith scored on a breakaway at 13:45 of the opening period. With teammate Scott Mellanby penalized, Smith picked up a loose puck after Montreal defenseman Chris Chelios mis­handled a pass at the point. Smith went in on a breakaway, faked right, making Roy com­mit, then easily beat the goalie to the left. 
Dave Poulin set up the second Philadelphia goal when he took the puck from Larry Robinson and hit Sinisalo breaking over the Montreal line. Sinisalo's weak shot trickled under Roy for his first goal of the playoffs.

The Irish will open up the homestand today with two games against one of the toug­hest teams in the area, DePaul. Last week, in the Windy City Classic Tournament, DePaul crushed Notre Dame by a score of 9-1. Head coach Brian Boulac is hopeful that the his team can make a better effort against the Demons this time. 
"Hopefully we can redeem ourselves and play with better intensity," the coach said. "They're an established softball team, one of the strongest in the Midwest, and this will give us a chance to gage how far we've come this season." 
The doubleheader will begin at 4:00 on the Notre Dame softball field behind the Eck Pavilion. 
The Irish will be going into the two games with plenty of momentum after sweeping two doubleheaders from Marquette and St. Mary's over the weekend. On Saturday, the team travelled to Milwaukee and beat the Warriors of Mar­quette by scores of 10-0 and 11­8. 
In the first game, Missy Linn started for Notre Dame and al­lowed only three hits in a five inning game cut short due to the ten run rule. Linn struck out eight and walked two to record the victory.

The hitting stars in the second game for the Irish were Rachel Crossen, who was 2-for­4 and drove in two runs and Kathy Vernetti was 2-for-3 and scored twice. 
Notre Dame continued on the winning track with two vic­tories over the Belles of St. Mary's on Sunday. The Irish took the first game by a score of 11-0. St. Mary's pitcher Kim Benjamin gave up eleven hits and six walks in five innings. Her counterpart on the Notre Dame team, Mooney, pitched a two-hitter for her second vic­tory in as many days.

Tennis team ends season, awaits possible NCAA invite 
By CHRIS COONEY Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame women's tennis team ended its season on a positive note last Saturday with an impressive 6-3 victory over Toledo. The win capped a successful year in which the 16­6 Irish progressed miles in their quest for a nationally con­tending program. 
The Irish won the match in the singles, taking all six from the Rockets. Head Coach Mic­hele Gelfman then used a new doubles line-up to give some of her non-regulars a chance to play. 
In the singles, CeCe Cahill, Tracy Barton and Tyler Mus­leh all won impressively, drop­ping only five games between the three of them. A seventh singles match was added to the meet. Resa Kelly dominated that contest, winning 6-0, 6-1. 
Kickoff Classic tickets available through mail 
Special to The Observer 
Student tickets are avail­able for the 1989 Kick Off Classic to be played in the Meadowlands on August 31, 1989. 
Since registration is Au­gust 28, it will not be possible to hold a student ticket dis­tribution on campus in the fall. The only opportunity to buy tickets will be in the summer mailing to all par­ents. 
An application for four tickets will be mailed to all parents, which will be the only chance for students and parents to purchase tickets. 
Sporting events full of unpredictabilities 
The nature of sports is such that it lends itself to massive publicity onslaughts, both positive and negative, so that it is not to be ignored at any cost.

Frank Pastor 
Assistant Sports Editor 
Athletes are prematurely built up as larger-than-life fig­ures, prototypes which the younger generation would do well to model itself after. However, these same athletes often fail to live up to their press clippings in big games, clearing the way for new media darlings. 
What is it about big games that leads otherwise unknown athletes into the spotlight and banishes "superstars" to obscurity? 
The past eight months are chock-full of surprises, of tri­umphs and travails, of underdogs upsetting odds-on favorites on the playing fields, in the arenas and in the newspapers. 
How many times in the past year has a title game, match or series been decided by the exploits of a little-known player who, for all intents and purposes, had no business playing such a big role in such an important contest? 
And by the same token, how many times have highly­publicized stars performed at their worst when it meant the most to their teams? 
From October's World Series to Sunday's Bookstore final, the team that wasn't supposed to win somehow did. 
see SPORTS I page 8 
Tickets are $25 each and the application must be returned to the Notre Dame Ticket Office by June 20. 
Student ticket distribution for all home games will be held Tuesday, Sept. 5 through Friday, Sept. 8. More information on season tickets will be available in the fall. 
A limited supply of tickets will be available for both the Michigan and Purdue away games, and 500 tickets are reserved for the 1989 student trip to Florida for the Miami game. Details about those tickets and trip will be avail­able at a later date. 
In the other three matches the Rockets challenged Katie Clark and Ann and Cathy Brad­shaw, but Notre Dame came away with the victories. 
"We were a little shakey at first, but overall I thought everyone played well," said Gelfman. "They gave us more trouble than I anticipated, but we got the victory. Numbers one and two were no contest at all." 
The doubles roster had a little more trouble which Gelfman attributed mainly to inexperience. The Irish used all new doubles combinations, giving Res a Kelly, Anne Marie Dega and Maura Weidner a chance to compete. 
"They were disappointed with the way they played,'' said Gelfman. "But we had a num­ber three pair playing number one when they had never played together. Some of the others don't travel with us or usually don't play doubles." 
Now Notre Dame must wait until May 5th to find out if the season will continue with an NCAA bid. Gelfman feels their record, up from a 12-14 showing last year, should earn the Irish a spot. The fourth year coach realizes, however, that the decision is out of Notre Dame's hands and now the team's per­formance will have to speak for itself. 
"We had an outstanding season," remarked Gelfman, "beating people we had lost to before. Considering that at any given time three of our top six players were out, I think we did a good job of filling the gaps." 
Gelfman added that injuries hurt the Irish in the doubles line-up especially with many players constantly changing

Pesavento is hot orospect
Senior shortstop passed up pro offers to play for Irish 
By STEVE MEGARGEE Associate Sports Editor 
Pat Pesavento arrived at Notre Dame hoping eventually to become the starting quarterback on the football team. 
Things didn't work out there, so he has settled for becoming perhaps the best shortstop in Notre Dame baseball history. 
The 6-3 senior has scored 100 more runs, rapped out 42 more hits and stolen 46 more bases than any other player to wear a Notre Dame uniform. He also has turned down two offers in the professional draft to stay with the Irish. 
"I didn't want to come here on a scholarship and not contribute to a sport," said Pesavento. "With baseball, I feel like I have contributed and have given something back to Notre Dame." 
Pesavento, who captained the baseball team at Joliet (Ill.) Catholic High School, decided to concentrate fully on football at Notre Dame. He fell victim to the same circumstances that affect almost any underclass Irish football player, going from a starring role in high school to a postion on the sidelines in college. 
"It was the first time I experienced not being out there playing on a consistent basis...or even just playing," said the Lockport, Ill., res­ident. "I think of myself as a competitor, and I didn't feel myself competing as much as I'd like to." 
When Lou Holtz replaced Gerry Faust as Irish football coach, Pesavento decided to switch sports and end his two-year sabbatical from baseball. 
"I kind of saw the writing on the wall," said Pesavento. "Coach Holtz came in with an option-type offense, and I'd never run the option 
It was the first pitch of the game for Snyder, who had been playing rightfield. He had just -relieved starting pitcher Scott Spruitenburg, who had loaded 
the bases with no outs. 
Dan Peltier led off the ninth 
with -a walk, and James Sass 
singled him to second. Frank 
Jacobs walked to load the 
bases, and Snyder relieved 
Spruitenburg. Snyder's first 
pitch was in the dirt. 
Mike Coffey got the win to improve his MCC-leading record to 7-0, pitching four shutout innings. Coffey allowed just one hit and no walks while he struck out two. 
Pat Pesavento continued his hot hitting, going 3-for-4 and raising his hitting streak to 11 consecutive games. Pat Eilers also added three hits for the Irish. 
The Irish pounded out 13 hits to Valparaiso's eight, but Notre Dame left 13 men on base. 
Due to the length of the game, the second game of the doubleheader could not be played because of ensuing darkness.

in high school. It was time to be honest with 
myself and with the people around me. 
"I really thank Coach Holtz for his under­
standing in the whole thing because he really 
was supportive of me and said 'if that's what 
you want to do, go for it,' " continued 
Pesavento, who also thanked assistant athletic 
director Brian Boulac for easing his transition 
to the baseball team. "I still can't believe I said 
that to Coach Holtz, that I was switching over 
to baseball...I must have a lot of guts."
