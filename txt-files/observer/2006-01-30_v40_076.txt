INSIDE COLUMN 
Good cause, bad name 
Willi Fafuer Jenkins' speech on academic freedom earlier this monfu, it seems like 1he annual "Vagina Monologues" Monfu debates have begun a little early this year. 
So before all1hat fun ge1s into full swing, I'd justlike to say this: This year, let's remember 
Chris Khorey 
one 1hing-1he bat­tered women. Every year we go Sports1hrough this and every 
Writer 
year 1he radical femi­nists fight 1he staunch conservatives and every year everyone ge1s caught up in 1heir side and people completely forget about1hose who need help. 
That said, I'm going to give a list ofsuggestions to bo1h sides of1hings to keep in mind while this monfu runs i1s course. 
To 1he feminis1s: 
Remember who you're fighting for. Women who have been attacked need shelter and coun­seling, among oilier 1hings. These causes need money, and this campus is willing to give, as you have already seen in past years I'm sure. However, when, for whatever reason, you put up a controversial front, people are less inclined to give. 
Remember who 1he enemy is: The enemy is not Fafuer Jenkins and it's most certainly not1he guys you see walking to class every day. The average man is not a rapist or spousal abuser, so don't treat him like one by lecturing him. Odds are he realizes violence against women is a problem and he would help out ifhe didn't feel like he was being accused ofsome1hing. 
Your enemies are 1he sociopaths who are so out-of-control1hat 1hey take no qualms in hitting 1heir wives or raping a woman off 1he street. The answer to this problem is not "awareness." Rapists and spousal abusers are unlikely to see what color t-shirt you're wearing. They are more likely to respond to extra police and more well-lit sidewalks. 
Remember what1he ''Vagina Monologues" is. It is a play, and a vulgar one at1hat. Ifyou want to put it on, fine. But don't claim 1hat people who are offended by or not particularly interested in it are unenlightened or not interested in 1he plight ofbattered women. The "Monologues" may include stories ofbattered women, but1hat does not mean 1hat people have to like 1hem to be sympathetic to 1hat cause. 
And to 1he conservatives: 
Remember who you're fighting for. Battered women need support and 1he organizations 1hat help 1hem need money and help. Protesting 1he ''Vagina Monologues" does not achieve this goal and only makes 1hose involved look intolerant and prudish. Raising money for battered women, possibly through Cafuolic charities, works wifu 1he feminis1s while helping out a good cause. 
Remember who 1he enemy is: The enemy is not your liberal professor in a red shirt on Valentine's Day or 1he girls performing 1he "Monologues". The enemy, as I said before, is 1he sociop~ths 1hat would do such horrible 1hings to women. Again, this is an opportunity to work wifu 1he feminis1s by encouraging Safe WaJks!Rides, better lit sidewalks and fast reac­tions by aufuorities. 
Finally, remember what1he ''Vagina Monologues" is. Itis a play, and a vulgar one at 1hat. But some people want to put it on and1hat is 1heir right. Ifyou don't 1hink you'd enjoy it, don't go see it. University sponsorship in light of Notre Dame's Cafuolic identity is a different mat­ter, for ano1her column and anofuer day, but whatever form 1he "Monologues" take, 1hey are what1hey are, and 1hat is someone's idea of what would make an entertaining performance. 
So, wifu all 1hat in mind, let 1he games begin, and let's see ifwe can't help out some victims of violent crimes in 1he process.

ing. Throughout the 1990s, Vatican officials began creat­
t ing and revising a document that would address the role and responsibility of Catholic universities around the world. Throughout that decade, the issue swirled around Notre Dame's campus, as students and faculty clashed about Notre Dame's future direction and national identity. 
In a two-part series in the Viewpoint section of The Observer in April of 1991, law professor Charles Rice criti­cized the University for being too concerned with political correctness. 
"In the fall of 1989, Notre Dame sponsored a public showing of a blasphemy of Christ. in the film, 'The Last Temptation of Christ,' he wrote. "That event remains crucial in the history of Notre Dame. The University decided there that the First and Second Commandments were superceded by the authority of the secular establishment." 
Rice wrote that such spon­sorship was a result of the "Land 0' Lakes" statement, which he called "an institu­tional renunciation of the duty to affirm religious truth."

spanned two full-size pages. David Lutz wrote he feared Notre Dame might become "merely one more secular uni­versity" and that "there should be no hesitation on the part of its leaders to state that ... the teaching of the Roman Catholic Church will not be compromised on the Notre Dame campus and that anyone not interested in teaching at a Catholic university should teach elsewhere."

that "restrictions on academic freedom are restrictions on the pursuit of truth"-a belief expressed by many in the Notre Dame community since Jenkins' addresses. 
The debate on academic freedom quieted somewhat until the 2000s -when two highly controversial and publi­cized events made their debuts on campus. 
"The Vagina Monologues" debuted in 2002, the Queer Film Festival in 2004. As the most recent additions to Notre Dame's decades-long debate on academic freedom, both events entered the campus conversation amid a flurry of fervent support and equally loud dissent. 
The strong reactions to the events have come from within the University and from far beyond its campus boundaries. Though University President Emeritus Father Edward "Monk" Malloy permitted both controversial events with little public comment, Jenkins has exerted a new leadership style -one he said last week he hopes will result in a formal policy on academic freedom and Catholic character.

then return to the Saint Mary's English department as a fac­ulty member. Not long after, however, he was contacted by a search consultant working with Wabash College to replace outgoing president Andrew Ford. 
After submitting an applica­tion and letters of recommen­dation, White went through three rounds of interviews. The first, which took place in early December in a hotel in Indianapolis, included meet­ings with and answering questions from the 16 mem­hers of the presidential search committee. On Jan. 6 three committee representa­tives visited White and his family in their home. Then, as one of three finalists, White traveled to Crawfordsville to visit the campus and meet with trustee members, facul­ty, students and alumni from Jan. 11-13. 
White said he found Wabash students to possess many of the same character­istics as Saint Mary's stu­dents. 
"Aside from the very big difference of the student bod­ies ... they have many simi­larities," White said. "[Wabash students] are very committed to the college, they are committed to the possibil­ity of their college, they are excited to be at Wabash." 
The students were interest­ed in the presidential search process, White said, noting that the student newspaper The Bachelor provided detailed coverage of each of the candidates. He was ulti­mately endorsed by one of the paper's opinion writers. 
"I have always been a big champion of student leader­ship p.ere at Saint Mary's and I think the stu­dents recog­
to. 
The small size of Wabash was attractive to the academ­ic, who has committed him­self to educating in a liberal arts setting. 
"Saint Mary's is the biggest college I have ever worked at," White said. "I've always wanted to be at a small col­lege where I could be close to students, and where the col­lege would be a community of learning, aqd where there could be a close connection between what is going on inside the classroom and what is going on outside the

Chaos erupts at Hussein trial 
Defense team argues for trial to move out ofthe country to less hostile environment 
Associated Press 

BAGIIDAD -Saddam llussnin's trial turned chaotic: shortly after rc1suming Sunday, with one defendant dragged out of court and tho dnl'onso tnam walking out in protest. The former Iraqi leader was then ns1:orted from the room minutes aftnr shout­ing "down with America!" 
Seeking to assert light control, tho nnw chief judge Haoul' Abdef­Hahman pressed ahead with tho procnndings evnn after tho oponing drama, !waring three prosecution witnesses before adjourn­ing tlw trial al'ter 4 1/2 hours. 
Abdei-Hahman said the trial will continue Wednesday or Thursday, depending on the date of tiHl Islamic now year, which is set according to 
thn  sighting  of  a  new  
moon.  
Abdnl-Hahman  was  

installed as ehinf judge after his prndecessor resigned amid complaints he was not doing enough to rein in Saddam's fre­quent courtroom out­bursts. 
Defonsn lawyers said the stormy session showed the trial was not fair -a vital concern in a nation that is trying to reconcile its Sunni Arab minority, which dominated Iraq undnr Saddam, and the Shiite Muslim majority that now controls the government. 
Former U.S. Attorney General Hamsey Clark. who is part of Saddam's defense team but did not attend Sunday's snssion, denounced the court as "lawless" and repeated r.alls for it to bo moved out of Iraq. 
"Now the court is seated without the defendants' counsel of' choice. This is wrong. They have the right to their own counsel and for that counsel to hear and question testimony madn against the defen­dants," Clark said, speak-

ing from New York. 

Saddam and his seven co-dHfendants are r.harged in the deaths of about 140 Shiite Muslims following an assassination attempt against the former Iraqi leader in the Shiite town of Dujail in 1982. The defen­dants could face death by hanging if convicted. 
Sunday's proeeedings, the l'irst in over a month, disintegrated almost immediately into shouting and insults. 
First, eo-defendant Barzan Ibrahim, who is Saddam's half-brothor and former intolfignnce chief. was dragged out of the room by guards after he stood and called the court 
"the daught11r of' a whore." Saddam shouted "down with traitors" and "down with America!" 
Thnn Abdef-Hahrnan, a Kurd, threw out a defense attorney for arguing with him. The rest of' the defense team stormnd out in protest as thf1 judge shouted after them, "Any lawynr who walks out will not bn allowed back into this courtroom." 
Abdol-Hahman appointed four new defense lawyers. But Saddam stood to rnjeet them and demand to loave the courtroom, holding a copy or the Quran and other papers under his arm. 
"You do not leave, I allow you to lnavn when I want to," Abdei-Hahman said. 
"For 35 years, I adminis­lnrnd your rights," Saddam replied, referring to his timn in powor. 
"I am the judge and you are thn defnndant." Abdef­Hahman rnsponded. Two guards pushed Saddam back into his chair, bnforn lhny wc\re ordored to flmd the ousted ruler from tho room. 
Two othor defondants also rojnctnd their nnw lawyers and wnrn allowed to h1avn. 
The procnodings then resumed with the four remaining dnfendants ­and none of' thnir original lawyers.

KATOWICE -Heseuers said they did not expm:t to lind any more survivors or bodies Sunday under the twisted wrec:k­age of an exhibition hall in southnrn Poland that collapsed during a radng pigeon show, killing at least f>fl poopfn and injuring 160. 
Hnscue crews usnd hand tools lilr 20 hours in bitterly eold temperatures to carve through the sheet metal and snarlf1d poles of' the eoflapsed building so as not to risk harming any potential survivors. 
But Katowiee fire chief Kazimierz Krzowski said Sunday that large machinery was being called in to lnar down the rost of thn building. 
"There is a low possibility that people are stiff trapped undnr lhnrn," Krzowski said after surveying the site. "The parL<> or the strueturn that are not lying on the hrrmmd are a lhrnat."

Ark. mother accused of stnothering 3 children 
Associated Press 

DE QUEEN, Ark.-A mother accused of smothering her three young children left notes that officials say could help determine what led to the killings, and her priest said Sunday that she had expressed "tremendous remorse." 
Paula Eleazar Mendez, 43, was in a county jail Sunday after being hospitalized for swallowing a toxic substance. 
She had collapsed as officers arrived at her southwestern Arkansas home Saturday morning in response to a tele­phone call from the children's father in New York. Inside the home, the officers found the bodies of the children, ages 6 to 8, lying side by side on a bed, said Chris Brackett, an investigator with the Sevier County Sheriff's Office. 
"I do not believe there is any dispute as to who killed these three children, and therefore who will be charged," prose­cutor Tom Cooper said. "However, we have not deter­mined at this time the particu­lar homicide charge or pun­ishment we will be seeking." 
De Queen Police Chief Richard McKinley said investi­gators needed a translator to read the notes that were writ­ten in Spanish. 
A family priest who visited Mendez in a hospital Saturday night described a woman experiencing profound sorrow. 
"She has tremendous remorse. She is deeply sorry," the Rev. Salvador Marquez­Munoz said Sunday before entering St. Barbara Catholic Church for Mass. "She asked for. our prayers and forgive­ness because she is realizing how much she has hurt the community, as well." 
He identified the children as 8-year-old Elvis and 6-year­old twins, Samanta and her brother Samuel. 
Autopsies were planned to determine whether the chil­dren had been poisoned or smothered, as their mother told police, Cooper said. The children's faces were not cov­ered when police found them. 
Cooper said an emergency room doctor told him Mendez had not ingested enough of the toxic substance to kill herself. Her arraignment was expected Monday, McKinley said. 
A neighbor said Mendez was distraught because her hus­band wanted a divorce, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reported for Monday editions. 
"She was depressed," Javier Garcia said through an inter­preter, explaining that she wept often for several weeks after learning the news during a trip to New York City. 
In the house's yard Sunday was a 7-foot-wide pile of burned papers. A page in a religion book bore the words "vamos a celebrar" -Spanish for "let's celebrate." A child's handwriting was scrawled in blue ink across some papers, and there were charred letters from a labor union in New York City. 
The priest said Mendez, who moved to the United States from Mexico 10 years ago, had lived in New York until last summer, when she moved with her children to De Queen. 
70 Canadian llliners trapped underground 
Associated Press 

ESTERHAZY, Saskatchewan ­Fire broke out Sunday in a mine in central Canada, forcing some 70 miners trapped underground to retreat to emergency refuge rooms stocked with oxygen and supplies, a mine official said. 
Late Sunday, a rescue team reached one of the rooms, made sure everyone was safe, then closed them back inside until the air inside the mine could be cleared of toxic gases, said Marshall Hamilton, a spokesman for Mosaic Company, the Minneapolis-based firm that operates the potash mine. 
"In those refuge stations, they can seal themselves off and there's oxygen, food and water," Hamilton told CBC Radio. "And they can stay in there for at least 36 hours." 
Hamilton said the fire broke out around 3 a.m. nearly a mile underground in the province of Saskatchewan. The miners reported smoke and quickly headed for the safe refuge rooms. 
Hamilton said company offi­cials could not establish a radio link with 30 of the miners but a team was able to enter one of the refuge rooms late Sunday and talk to the workers. 
"I won't kid you, there was a lot of relief in that," Hamilton said. 
He said the rescue team took a roll call of all the miners, ehecked their health and then helped them seal up the room again before leaving. 
Hamilton said they believed they had found the source of the smoke and were working on extinguishing the frre. He said the mine would be cleared of smoke and toxic gas before miners were evacuated, adding "we'd rather do this safely than quickly." 
"We'll go get them when we're absolutely confident that the fire is out and the smoke and the toxic gases that are associated with fires have left our opera­tions and the air is safe for them to breathe," he said. "They're safe where they are, they're safe in there for many, many hours, potentially even days." 
He said that some of the min­ers' families had gathered at the mine. 
"They're a little bit tired. They're a little bit anxious. They have confidence that we're going to safely bring them up," he said. "Nevertheless, they'd like to see them sooner rather than later." 
Potash is a pinkish-grey miner­al used in the production of agri­cultural fertilizer. 
The mine, which was Saskatchewan's frrst potash oper­ation when it opened in 1962, is located near Esterhazy, about 130 miles northeast of Regina.

increasing the risk of becoming a victim of sexual assault, Hemmerlein said. Women who have had several drinks can lose their inhibitions and also their judgment. 
The level of intoxication can also be detrimental to piecing together the facts of an incident and subsequently building a case, Hemmerlein said. If a victim is so drunk she cannot remember the name of the person she was with or where the assault took place it can be difficult for prosecutors to pursue her attacker. 
"It is not a pleasant situa­tion to sit with a victim and family and to tell them there is little that we can do when the real desire is to go after someone like that and lock them up for a long time," 
occur when someone decides they want control." 
A woman who has been the victim of a sexual assault needs to be examined at a hospital so that physical evi­dence, such as DNA, can be collected and used to prose­cute the assailant. Cotter said. 
"If you are assaulted ... you go to the hospital," Cotter said. "Don't wait until two days later. You can decide later on if you want to coop­erate, you can decide later on if you want to pursue it. We need that evidence now." 
Rape victims are often embarrassed to discuss inci­dents in detail, Cotter said, especially if they feel they might somehow be at fault. Women sometimes hesitate to say whether they went home 
with their assailant or whether they permitted him to kiss them prior to the rape. 
It is crucial that a victim tell investigators exactly what happened leading up to the assault, Cotter said, so they know the whole story and the victim can keep her credibility in the eyes of the jurists. 
Sgt. Bill Kraus of the South Bend Police Department warned the audience about the dangers of drinking and driving and showed images of two vehicles that had been involved in alcohol-related incidents. One was that of a Saint Mary's student who struck and killed a man dur­ing a Notre Dame football game weekend. The other was a vehicle that burst into flames after rolling over ­killing its 18-and 19-year-old female occupants. 
"One of the hardest things is to knock on that door and tell somebody you're not coming home," Kraus said. "I don't want to do it, I have done it too many times. I know I am going to have to do it again before the year is over." 
At the end of the event Holens, who said she herself was a victim of sexual assault at 14, encouraged students to turn to the resources avail­able on campus in case of a sexual assault. She explained why it is important for vic­tims to notify campus securi­ty and local officials. 
"It is something other peo­ple need to know," Rolens said. "If it was a date rape type of situation, if it lwas] someone from here in town, there is going to be someone else who is going to be a vic­tim."

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 



Ad suggests false association 
I write in response to an advertisement on page 9 of The Observer on Friday, Jan. 27. Earlier last week I was invited by phone to speak at a dinner/panel on race and terrorism this upeoming Wednesday. As I enjoy speaking about terrorism and with students, I readily agreed and was promised a follow up e-mail with details on how to foeus my remarks. This e-mail never arrived. Today, whatever group is sponsoring the talk placed an ad in The Observer equating Sept. 11 and its "pre­sumed" leader with the Iraq War and President George W. Bush. Indeed, Bush comes out looking about 10 times worse given the body counts provided. 
As my name is also in the ad, the ad may be taken by some or many that this comparison is one that I would make and one I believe in. 
I write to tell the Notre Dame community that I would not make such a comparison, and that I do not believe that comparison holds in almost any dimension. While I lament and mouri1 anyone's violent death and welcome debates about public policy, in my view the educational benefit of this comparison comes from dissecting and debunking it. But as I appear to be linked to the argument this ad is trying to make, I am dismayed and insulted by this ad. 
I call for a public apology by whoever placed this ad. I critique the professionalism of any group that would place a surprise ad with such injurious implications to my reputation and that would not clearly identify themselves in such a politically charged ad. Moreover, I urge The Observer to not accept essentially anonymous political ads in the future. 
Although I have been blindsided and insult­ed, I will not flinch or boycott. I look forward to debating and critiquing this ad and its implications on Wednesday. 
Dan Lindley Assistant Professor department of political science Jan. 27 

Interrace Forum to discuss terrorism 
The February Interrace Forum sponsored by Multicultural Student Programs and Services titled Terrorism: Then and Now .is addressing the perspective on domestic ter­rorist acts inflicted by supremacist groups such as the KKK and Arian Nation. Pro­nationalist groups like the Black Panthers have been labeled as such because of their tactics. Hence the discussion Wednesday will broaden the definition of terrorism to include those implemented by American cit­izens toward other Americans based on eth­nic, racial and religious differences. 
The Feb. 27 advertisement in no way reflects the beliefs of Professor Daniel Lindley nor the Office of Multicultural Student Programs and Services. An apology was extended for this reason and for those who may have been offended by the cutting edge approach.

New approaches for feminists 
I feel that those who are ardently in support of the "Vagina Monologues" are making an egregious error when it comes to their approach of dealing with Father John Jenkins. It seems that they have chosen the "Vagina Monologues" as the sole medium in which the abolition of violence against women is to be advanced. It appears that they believe that if the "Vagina Monologues" are banned, that this is tantamount to banning the advancement of such a worthy cause. Even feminists question the goals of the "Vagina Monologues." Pro-sex feminist Betty Dodson, author of "Our Bodies, Ourselves," saw the play as having a negative and restrictive view of sexuality and an anti-male bias. She called the play a blast of hatred at men and heterosexuality. If the play is so contentious, why not explore other mediums that will allow them to gain the public's attention? 
Furthermore, why not turn all of the attention now focused on the "Vagina Monologues" into something that will benefit their cause? There's a saying in marketing, "Any publicity is good pub­licity." If Jenkins does decide to scale back the event, why not set up a conference on violence against women? If Jenkins decides to eut off their ability to collect funds, why not set up a dinner to ben­efit the victims of domestic violence instead? Judging from the pub­lic outcry, I'm sure these events would be well attended. 
One thing cannot be denied: those who are strong supporters are passionate about their cause. I hope that this passion will not be wasted debating whether the "Vagina Monologues" should be allowed the full support of University facilities. II' Jenkins does decide to scale back the event, I hope that their passion can be redirected into other mediums that will achieve the abolition of violence against women and the betterment of our society. 
Chris Weinacht sophomore Carroll Hall Jan. 25 

Academic freedom or 
conservative.~~Catholicism? 
I am appalled by Father John Jenkins' speeches concerning the scope of academic freedom. Hearing him speak of limiting this indispensable right makes me worry about the direction in which this institution is headed. 
Allowing a dialogue to occur doesn't mean the University endorses what is contained within the discourse and materials presented to spark it. If a professor assigns his/her students to read a speech given by Adolf Hitler to inspire discussion, does this mean that the University or the professor is endorsing the content of the speech? I think it is obvious that the answer to that question is an emphatic "No." The same allowance should apply to the "Vagina Monologues" and the Queer Film Festival, especially since they both promote acceptance and diversity, as opposed to Hitler's hate-filled words. 
Why is Jenkins so afraid of these topics being discussed? Does he not think that the foundation of this University is strong enough to deal with differing opinions? In order for an individual's values to develop, he/she must be exposed to and seriously consider all that is available. In Amish communities, the elders send young adults into the world for one year to experience all that it holds. They are then given the choice to return or remain a part of outside society. The elders embrace the idea that questioning leads to the strength­ening and expansion of one's beliefs. No justice is done for faith when those who have it are blind as to why they believe what they do. 
The most vital question remains. Is the primary goal of Notre Dame to promote, among its students, the freedom to learn and develop an identity, or is the chief objective a surreptitious indoctri­nation of conservative Catholicism under the guise of allowing aca­demic freedom? This requires serious discernment by University administrators. Even Du Lac states, "The intellectual interchange essential to a university requires, and is enriched by, the presence and voices of diverse scholars and students. The University is com­mitted to constructive and critical engagement with the whole of human culture." 
I couldn't have said it better myself.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 

More than just the heterosexual male point ofview 
Through thn hetnrosexual main gaze, I lnarnml about my snxuality at Notre Damn. With tho help of one male profes­sor, I learrwd how it feels to be sexually harassnd. With tho hnlp of' many male students, I came to understand that pic­turns of' nudn girls in dorm rooms would bn a nmlity I would havn to aecept. 
It is accnptabln for the heterosexual mall~ to nxpross his own sexuality on campus and f'or him to gaze at, harass and mock wonwn's and homosnxuals' snxwtlitins. With thn prohibition of' tho "Vagina Monologuns" and tho Quenr l;ilm Fnstival, tho nnw prnsident is Pxpliritly saying that womnn and homo­snxuals should not bn abln to nxprnss tlwir own snxualitins on eampus. Thnir vokns, thnir gazns and thnir introspne­tions into tlwir own snxual identiltes must rnmain quintml, and lnrt to the het­'~rosl~xual main gazn. 
l.nt's bn critical of tho "Catholic val­uns" the nnw prnsidnnt is advoeating: tlwy arn "Catholic views" as defined f'rom a lwt1~rosnxual male point of view. This point of' vinw targnts those who are dill'nront f'rom it: it targots non-males and non-hetnrosexuals. These happen to lw lwtnrosnxual women and homosexual wornnn and men. 
l.ikn I mentioned above, I was sexually harasstHI by a professor at Notre Dame. I complained, and a couple of years latnr, diseovered that the male coun­selor had not filed my complaint as a "f'ormal" one. Two years after my ind­dent, the same professor harassed another student. The student com­plainnd and yet, the professor remains at the sdwol. My senior year, I partici­patnil in tho "Vagina Monologues" and startnd hearing my own voice again; it was very mnpowering. When the presi­dent is spnaking of "Catholic values," he is spnaking of' the disempowerment of womnn and homosexuals to speak about thoir minds and bodies, about their entirn selves as eomplete human beings. 
Lot's explore the interpretative powers of this nnw leader at Notre Dame. If Mother Theresa, instead of Father John .Jenkins. had posed a talk to the Notre Dame campus about "Catholic values," do you think she would have focused on quieting the snxual voices of non-het­nrosexual and non-male students? Or do you think that her "Catholic values" would have induded the voices of the entire community, exploring a dialogue botween our minds and bodies, between our thoughts and emotions? 
Mother Theresa wrote, "I pray that you will understand the words of Jesus, 'Love one another as I have loved you.' Ask yourself, 'llow has he loved me? Do I really love others in the same way?'" 
When we discuss and define "Catholic values," let's not forget that a religious priest is interpreting the community's values. My oxample of Mother Theresa and Father Jenkins illustrates this divide in Catholicism: We can interpret "Catholic values" to reflect the inclusive values of social justice theology or the nxelusive values of a doctrinal faith. Do we want to draw on those public lig­ures, like Jesus, Mother Theresa, Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr., who embraced all those around them, or on those ligures who have sought to exdude womnn, blacks and homosexu­als' voices from any possible publie dia­logue? 
Lflt's question our identity. Do we, the Notre Dame community, want to base our values on the tradition of social jus­tice theology, or are we embracing the doctrines of the Vatican? It is this same Vatican that excludes women and gays from the priesthood. These priests are those who create religious doctrine and interpret our "Catholic values" while purposefully excluding women and homosexuals from this process. Yet, it is this doctrine and these values that Jenkins draws on. How can these doc­trines bind me if, as a woman, I am not represented in this governing body of priests? How can women and homosex­uals empower these priests, like Jenkins, to interpret "Catholic values" when these same priests are not even allowing women and homosexuals to help define the "Catholic values?" By requesting the exclusion of women's and homosexuals' sexual voices from Notre Dame's campus, Jenkins is seeking a gag order without representation. Perhaps another Boston Tea Party is in order. 
OK, line, Father Jenkins, I see the bright side. At least you're offering aca­demic freedom for those just like you: Those who perform as heterosexual . males in the public sphere, and who do not challenge the heterosexual male Vatican's interpretation of the biblical text and Catholic tradition. 
Maribel Morey alumnus class of 2003 Jan. 27 

One concern of President John Jenkins about the "Vagina Monologues" at Notre Dame is, he tells us, the "appearance of endorsement" of some of the values he and others lind in the play. As he said, "The repeated performance of the play and the publidty surrounding it suggest that the University endorses certain themes in the play, or at least finds them compatible with its values." As Jenkins clarified in his talk. the University does endorse some values he linds in the play but does not endorse others. This seems to be mov­ing Jenkins toward the conclusion that he must not allow tire event on campus in any way that permits heavy adver­tising. 
I o!Ter the following alternative. If there is indeed confusion about what values from the play the University does and does not endorse, Jenkins and others authorized to spnak oLlicial­ly for the University can speak out forcefully about these issues. Jenkins did this in his talk when pledging that the University stands against, for example., violence against women but also stands against views of sexual freedom divorced from Catholic moral teaehing. Surely high profile state­ments from the president such as these, reported widely in both eampus and South Bend media, can combat the mistaken "appearance of endorse­ment." If needed, reminders of what values the University officially endors­es and rejects can be provided, for example, during the week of the play. This educational step would contribute to a healthy dialogue about Catholic values, alternative perspectives, and the role of Notre Dame in a pluralistic society. Adding the voice of Notre Dame to these diseussions seems preferable to both the limitations on academic freedom hinted at by Jenkins and the silence on these matters from Father Edward Malloy (which appar­ently Jenkins believes allowed the mis­taken "appearance of endorsement" to continue). 
I fear, however, that other remarks from Jenkins show that he has broader objections to the understanding of aca­demic freedom at the heart of higher ~ducation today. These deeper misun­derstandings of Academic Freedom displayed by Jenkins are, I predict, what will eventually lead to serious conflict on campus. I offer two exam-
pies of what appear to be thesn deeper 
misunderstandings. 
The first emerges most dearly in his distinction between academic frnndom for individual faeulty and aeadnmie f'rendom for departrnnnts. In addition to displaying an apparent hu:k of f'amiliarity with tho centrality of collab­orative work in many academic disci­plines, Jenkins apparnntly fails to rnal­ize that nxactly the sarnn principles of dissociation arc in play in both of those eases. Nnither individual faculty nor individual dnpartmnnts arn gnnnrally authoriznd to spnak on bnhalf' of t.hn University. DnpartrnnnL-;, just likn indi­vidual faculty, c.annot and thnrnf'orn do not speak f'or the University in, n.g., hosting spnaknrs, workshops or otlwr activities unless explicitly grantnd pm·­mission to do so. Whnrn then~ is a lack of clarity, involved partins have a duty to explicitly note that they do not spnak on behalf of the University. And if' in some cases there is any improper "appearance of endorsnment" that Jenkins believes damages the University in any way, darifying state­ments of' the kind suggnstod above are entirely appropriate. It is amazing to me that Jenkins showed no familiarity with these central eomponents of aea­demic freedom in his talk. 
The second, deeper misunderstand­ing is this. Jenkins seems to think that the view that his judgment as presi­dent ultimately grounds proper inquiry by groups of faculty on campus is com­patible with the recognition of the . need for "vigorous defense" and recog­nition of the "saered value" of <u:adem­ic freedom. These views are not com­patible. Within the well defined limits of mutual dissociation, it is individual faculty and groups of faculty who are trusted to pursue and disseminate knowledge as we son lit, subjeet only to dismissal on grounds specilind in our contracts. These principles are clearly articulated in foundational higher educational documents and endorsed almost unanimously in American higher education. If in the end Jenkins abandons these eommit­ments, he is not vigorously defending academic freedom, he is abandoning it. 
Fritz Warfield A~sociatc Professor dcpanmem of philosophy Jan. 25 

Open dialogue won't make University any less Catholic 
c;rowth dons not mire tradition; it 1mhances it. A-; a Notrn Damn alumnus, I have seen Notrn Damn evolvn over the years, none of which has made the univer­sity any loss Catholic. I am encouraged by tho growing number of students and faeul­ty who rnalizo that fear of change is what driv1~s some at Notre Damn to censor hon­nst diseoursn, just bncausn they are not use to talking about "dillkult issues." This tear must and nm bn overcome. 
NotrP I >arne has ehangnd for the bntter. Though enrtain issues at Notre Dame have traditionally had a limited forum for dia­logun, induding gay right-; and the exploitation of women, the University has eome a lohg way in giving voiee· to the underrepresented. The annual Queer Film Fostival and "Vagina Monologues" have started conversations about what it means to be gay and Catholic and what it means to bH a woman who embraces her sexuali­ty. These forums, in all their artistic diversi­ty, f(>ster conversation about the larger societal questions of human right<>, diversi­ty, and morality-isn't that precisnly what a Catholie university environment should f(>ster'? With open and free forums in which to discuss complex issues and diverse view­point<>, students will have a more authentic educational experience, making them increasingly prepared for the real world. 
I am proud of Father John Jenkins' deci­sion to host an open forum with faeulty and students to discuss academic freedom in a Catholic university environment.

'THE OFFICE': AN AMERICAN PERSPECTIVE 
By TAE ANDREWS Scene Writer 

Britain and America may share a com­mon language, but they have very dif­ferent senses of humor. NBC's decision to remake the BBC's show "The Office" for American audiences has caused a great debate about which type of humor is better and, ultimately, which version of the show is funnier. 
For those interested in some quirky British humor (think exceedingly, dry wit, usually followed by vigorous golf clapping, a round of tea sipping, and hearty cries of, "Cheerio!"), the DVD box set of the first two seasons of the British version is clearly the way to go. However, for people whose preferred adjective for their comedy is "hilarious," the American version of the show is the better option. 
The basic premise here is much akin to the relationship between the Magna Carta and the United States Constitution: the Americans have taken a good idea and made it their own. Airing on Thursdays at 9:30 p.m. on NBC, "The Office" is an uproarious take· on the exceedingly banal minutiae of cubicle life in the corporate sector. 
Front man Steve Carel!, the star of last year's "The 40-Year-Old Virgin," plays egomaniacal boss Michael Scott. Employing both over-the-top narcissism and self-delusions of grandeur, Carell manages to convey just how pathetic Scott's life is and how he leans so heavi­lyon his surrogate "family." Carell won a 2006 Golden Globe award for Best Actor in a Television Comedy for his performance in "The Office." 
Surrounding Michael Scott is a cast of tremendously funny characters, includ­ing Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson), the resident office brainiac with aspirations of corporate domination. Especially amusing are Dwight's various schemes at corporate collusion aimed at better· ing his own position within the ranks of Dunder-Mifflin. 
Jenna Fischer plays Pam Beesly, the deadpan secretary who spends much of her time humoring her boss' various ridiculous antics. In between receiving calls, Pam often conspires with sales rep Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) to come up with new and entertaining ways to tor­ture Dwight. 
One of the show's consistent themes is Pam and Jim's forbidden romance. This match is prevented by Pam's engage­ment to the markedly insensitive Roy, an archetypal man's man who works in the company warehouse. Rounding out the crew is Ryan Howard (B.J. Novak), the office "temp" who, despite the transitive nature of his profession, has somehow managed to stick around well into the show's second season. 
Some highlights from the first season include: 
+"Diversity Day," an episode in which a diversity educator is brought in after Michael does an ill-advised rendition of a Chris Rock standup routine. However, after displaying extreme ignorance, Michael decides to hold his own version of "diversity day" and educate his coworkers. 
+Unwilling to make cuts in benefits himself, Michael de~egates responsibility f0r downgrading health care packages'<> 
· for Dunder-Mifflin employees to Dwight, IJ.' in the episode "Health Care." Dwight, relishing his newfound power, proceeds to makes slashes beyond what is neces­sary "for the good of the company." +In "Hot Girl." a corporate saleswom­an stops by the office peddling pocket­books, and Michael (in addition to the entire male staff) is instantly smitten with her. After noticing her resemblance to Pam, Michael proceeds to remark, "You're like the new and improved Pam. Pam 6.0." The show's brilliance lies in the often-absurd interaction between Michael and his employees. Filmed as a documen­tary, Steve Carell is perfectly ridiculous as the regional manager of Dunder­Mifflin's Scranton branch. Well-written and smart -after its first season, the show was nominated for three Writer's Guild of America Awards -Steve Carel! makes it well worth the time to head in to "The Office." ----------------­Contact Tae Andrews at tandrewl@nd.edu

NBC's hit comedy 11 The Office" 
'THE OFFICE' AND BEYOND: CORPORATE HUMOR 
By MOLLY GRIFFIN A.sistant Sn·ne Editor 
Working in an oiTiee is hard, but, ironically, tho work itself is often the nasiost part of the job. The invented lingo, forced fraternization with co­workers, incompetent bosses and irwnmsing hurnaueradns, havn madn eorporat1~ eulturn thn hardest part of' many jobs. Naturally, these nlaborate­ly eonstructod and often illogical busi­rwss realms have bocome a major soureo of eomie matnrial. 
Tho comie strip, "Dilbert," which was syndicatod in 19S9, was an early foray into parodying oflico culturn in Anwriea. The comic focuses on l>illwrt, an engineer. and his daily strugglos in an office world dominated hy nr hi c~~~ s an d i neo m p e t e n c e . "Dillwrt" makns fun of' everything from duoless bosses to labyrinthine bureaucracies and laughs at how ran~ly rPal work seems to be reward­od at big companies. 
In 200 I, the strip appearod in ovor 
; 2,000 nllwspapers In 50 countries and was translatnd into over 19 lan­guages, rnvnaling the universality of ofl'il:o culturn around the world. Dilhnrt's crnator, Scott Adams, was inspirml to start the strip whiln work­ing at l'aeilic Bell in various engineer­ing groups. TIH~ comic nmHrged from his doodling, and the characters took on attributes of his co-work11rs and bosses. 
The comic created many spin-off's, induding a number of' best-selling books, calendars, apparel and even an ill-l'atnd IIJIJIJ cartoon featuring the voie1~s of Daniel Stern and Chris Elliot. 
A dassie example of poking fun at lifo in the business world is the film "OITiee Space." Tho movie parodies every aspnet of ol'lke culture, indud­
ing the commute, the paper work, the annoyances of micro-management and the annoying behavior of co­worker!>. 
At the center of the !'ilm is Peter Gibbons !Hon Livingston), who under­goes hypnosis and completely stops caring about his job. This, ironically, makes him more valuable to the com­pany. After his friends are fired, though, they conspire to exploit the company's inner bureaucracy and to steal from it. 
The film was written and directed by Mike Judge, who is well known for his animated series "Beavis and Butt­head" and "King of the Hill." The film didn't enjoy immediate success at the box-office, but has slowly become a cult hit on IWD. 
The movie managed to nail many of tho most frustrating aspects of corpo­rate life, but its popularity might actu­ally stem from the fact that it allows its characters to live out the fantasies of' many office workers, ineluding telling their bosses exactly how they feel and destroying oflice equipment . with a baseball bat. 
The British television show "The Offiee" revealed that making fun of "corporate America" was not limited in any way to America. The show is essentially a fake documentary about daily life in a small British paper com­pany in the industrial town of Slough. At its heart is David Brent (Rieky Gervais), a horrible boss made worse by the fact that he thinks that he's the smartest, funniest boss ever. 
While the show watches him make a fool of himself in a variety of ways, it also reveals how his staff copes not only with an incompetent boss but also with the inanities of daily life in the office. 
"The Office" is, at times, a painful show to watch. It is rife with lengthy, 
Graphic by GRAHAM EBETSCHfThe Observer 
awkward pauses, horribly uncomfort­able moments and people saying instantly regrettable things. This high level of discomfort, though, makes the show all the more real and allows it to show the true pain that life among the cubicles can be. 
The cult success of the British ver­sion of "The Office" made it natural fodder for an American remake. The NBC version rrioves the show from Slough to Scranton and swaps Hieky Gervais' David Brent for Steve Carrell's Michael Scott. 
The American version of "The Office" began with episodes that were remakes of the British version, but after that it began to take its own tra­jectory. The show is eloser to American corporate culture than the British version, but the awkward nature of the show remains. · 
Initially, audiences· weren't very moved by the American remake of "The Office." Between die-hard fans of the British version and people who didn't "get" the concept of the show, it had a ·hard time winning over viewers. The show got a boost when its star, Stlwe Carrell, best known for his work on "The Daily Show" and in support­ing roles in films like "Bruce Almighty," had a huge hit with the film "The 40-Year-Old Virgin." It has since moved to a new time slot and has slowly accrued a wider audience and greater popularity. 
Parodies of office culture run the gamut from comics to movies to tele­vision shows, and while they havo their differences, they're united in that they show how work can be hor­rible. Fortunately, they've found ways to make us laugh -and cringe -at life in the corporate world.

MELBOUHNE, Australia -Always in control on the court, Hoger Federer was overcome with emotion while accepting his Australian Open trophy from one of the few people he's still trying to match. 
The top-ranked Federer full'illed overwhelming expectations by beating unlikely finalist Marcos Baghdatis 5-7. 7-5, 6-0, 6-2 in Sunday's limtl to elaim his seventh Grand Slam title and third in sueeession. 
lie tnarfully nmbraced tennis great Hod Laver while receiving his trophy. 
Laver twice swept thn Grand Slams, a feat Federer will try to emulate this season -if he finally can win a Fn-mch Open. 
Federer wept and was stuck for words at the award presentation. 
"I was so happy," he said. "Then I had to go up on stage and speak. This is really too much for me sometimes. It's just a dream come true evp,ry lime I win a Grand Slam. 
"I ean't block it out-I'm also just human." 
Federer maintained his perfect record in seven major l'inals. And, at 24, he's halfway toward Pete Sampras' all-time record of 14 Grand Slam titles. Sampras also was 24 when he won his seventh. 

Federer, who is the first since Sampras to win thrne conseeutive majors, said he was unusually nervous as an overwhelming favorite against the 54th-ranked Cypriot, a former junior world ehampion. 
"The whole faet of being such a huge favorite. And if I lose, a huge upset sinee I don't know when," Federer said. "The whole thing was building up and waiting all day for the night session­that is nerve-rac:king on top of it. It was really tough for me mnntally." 
An 11-gamn winning streak from 5-5 in tlw snc:­ond set eased Federer's nerves and took the mateh away from Baghdatis, who said his problems startt~d when he began to think a huge upset was within reach.

IN BRIEF 
Piazza inks one-year deal 
with Padres 
SAN DIEGO -All-Star eatcher Mike Piazza agreed Sunday to a $2 million, one-year contract with the San Diego Padres, giving the defending NL West champions a marquee player they think ean still contribute. 
Piazza, 37, had bmm intemsted in signing a free-agent deal with an AL team to become it designated hitter. Instead, he'll stay in the NL and return to the West Coast for the first time since the Los Angelos Dodgers traded him to Florida in 1998. 
The 12-timo All-Star holds tho major league roeord for most can~er home runs by a catcher (374). He has 397 homers overall, and is a earner .311 hitter. 
The deal is expneted to be announe11d on Monday. Piazza gets a $1.25 million salary this year, and the contract includes a mutual option for 2007 at $8 million with a $750,000 buyout. He can earn an additional $750,000 this year in pnrformanee

Tiger starts year with bang 
After taking a break, Woods returns to win the Buick Invitational 
Associated Press 
SAN DIEGO -A new deeade for Tiger Woods brought back some familiar images. 
Stalking the 18th green at Torrey Pines, he sized up the 8 feet of grass between his ball and the cup, a putt he simply had to make to get into a play­ofT Sunday. Then came that pounding of the fist when it dropped for birdie, matching the longest putt he made all weekend. 
And when the Buick Invitational ended somberly, there was Woods holding another trophy. 
Heturning from the longest self-imposed break or his career, the 30-year-old Woods began his 1Oth full season on the PGA Tour with duteh shots down the stretch and two pars in a playoll' to outlast two-time Masters champion Jose Maria Olazabal and Australian rookie Nathan Green. 
Woods' only n~gret was how it nnded. Olazabal playnd a splendid 


bunker shot on the par-3 16th to 4 feet, but missed the par putt on the second playoll' hole. Woods closed his eyes and briefly bowed his head, bring­ing back another familiar scene. 
llis last PGA Tour win was the American Express Championship !'our months ago at !larding Park, where John Daly missed a 3-foot. par putt on the second extra hole. 
"You don't ever take pleasun~ out seeing your friends do that," Woods said. "I would have felt !ired up if I made the putt in the playo!l' for birdie on 18 and ended it right there, but not when a friend of mine miss­es a short one." 
Still, Woods could not have asked for a better start to a new season. 
Improving his playoll' record to 12-1 worldwide, Woods bncame the lirst four-time win­ner of the Buick Invitational and won in his season debut for the fourth time in 10 y1~ars. 
"You either win or lose right here and now," he said of his birdie for an even-par 72. "Either you get it done or you don't. Over my career. I've donn a prntty good job of it." 
So ended a dynamic after­noon along the blurt's or the Pacilk Ocean. where a dozen playors had a share of the lead at onn point and eight players shared the lead with six holes to play. 
Olazabal was the first to rnach 10-undnr 27X with a two-putt birdie on the 1Rth for a 69. Green, who made two crucial par saves in only his seeond PGA Tour event, holnd a n1~rvy ?-footer for birdie for a 72. 
Woods nevnr expected a chance, not after three-putting three times and getting fooled by the speed of tho groens on a South Course where he has played since he was 12. 
But in 10 years and 47 carenr victories, he doesn't miss many putts with so much on thn line. 
"I shouldn't have even bnen in the playoff," Woods said, surprised that none of the otlwr 11 players atop the leaderboard ran orr with a string of birdies. "Of all the things that happened today, I kept saying, 'At least you havn a chance.' I llippnd it around, turnnd it into a positive situa­tion. It folt good coming oil' the putter and found its way to the bottom." 
Woods has won lilltr times on four courses -Torrey Pines, Augusta National, Firestone and Bay I!ill. 
Green did all he could to pull of an improbable victory. 
The 30-year-old Aussie, who once worked in his parents' crematm·ium, built a two-shot lead by holing a 77 -yard wedge on the par-5 I 3th for eagle. Then, he held on f'or dnar life by making t.wo clutch par savns, and the birdin on tlw 18th holn. But hn didn't last. long.

Tean1 don1inates, shuts out both Ohio State and Xavier 
By DAN TAPETILLO 
Sports Wri£er 
The No. 22 Irish (2-0) had lit­tle trouble securing victories in their doubleheader against Ohio State (2-1) and Xavier (1-1) Saturday. 
Notre Dame shut out both opponents with 7-0 victories and took all 30 sets against its regional foes. 
"We didn't lose many games and were really eflicient on the court," freshman Kelcy Tefft said. "We didn't make it as long of a day." 
Against the Buckeyes in dou­bles, the No. 1 doubles team of junior twins Christian and Catrina Thompson were lirst ofT the court with an 8-1 victory over Ohio State's Caitlin O'Keefe and Julie Blackmore. 
"The Thompsons are extremely humble, and their work ethic sets the pace and tone for the rest of us," fresh­man Katie Potts said. 
The duo was followed off the court by the No. 35-ranked pair of sophomore Brook Buck and Tefft with an 8-2 win over Angela Diastina and Sonia Huzimovsky. 

The final pairing of No. 45 seniors Kiki Stastny and captain Lauren Connelly defeated Ohio State's Ciara Finucane and Kristin Messmer 8-5. 
"Our doubles team as a whole are amongst the top in the country," Potts said. "[Coach] Jay [Louderback! said it should be a rare occasion if we lose a doubles point." 
Tefft agreed. 
"Our team has the best dou­bles in the nation with all three teams ranked," she said. 
The motivation and strength of the doubles matches appeared to carry over into sin­gles, and the Irish took all six matches over Ohio State. 
Playing at No. 1 for the Irish, No. 24 Catrina Thompson defeated O'Keefe 6-2, 6-3, fol­lowed by her sister No. 44 Christian Thompson in a 6-2, 6­1 win over DiPastina at No. 2. Nos. 3 and 5, Buck and Stastny, continued the trend by topping Huzimovsky 6-2, 6-1 and Messmer 6-2, 6-3, respectively. 
In their dual-match debuts in singles, No. 4 Tefft and No. 6 Potts claimed victories over Blackmore and Finucane, respectively. 
"Everyone came out and played so well, and [the other teamsJ didn't give us much of a problem," Tefft said. 
In their second match against Xavier, the Irish only lost 11 games in singles against the Musketeers -the fewest by the Irish since Jan. 30, 1999 against Kansas State. 
Key matches came from Stastny -the only Irish player to compete in singles and dou­bles in both matches, who defeated Xavier's Kara Courtney 6-2, 6-2 at No. 3, ­Connelly -her 6-0, 6-0 deci­sion over Annie Diedalis secured the victory for the Irish -and senior Kelly Nelson. Nelson defeated Sarah Pots 6-3, 6-3 in her dual match debut in singles. 
The Irish return to the court to face No. 24 Wake Forest on Feb. 11, followed by No. 11 UNC on Feb. 12. 
"We are hoping to get a win against [UNCI and that will really help our confidence [as the season progresses]." Tefft

Hernandez sank three free throws with two-tenths of a second left in regulation to send the game into overtime and hit four morn in the extra period. lifting Stanford to a thrilling 76-67 victory over No. 10 Washington on Sunday night. 
"When you're trying to shoot, the best thing to do is not think about what you have to do," Hernandez said. "I've

The Cardinal (10-7, 6-3 Pac­
10) won their third straight to extend their home winning streak to eight games. It was their 13th straight win over the Huskies at Maples Pavilion, where students charged the court after the final buzzer sounded. 
"I don't think it crossed my mind we were going to lose that game," said Huskies leading scorer Brandon Roy, who finished with 25 points. ''I'm still kicking myself. For the first time in basketball, I fee I sorry for myself." 
Hernandez finished with 15 points and four assists after sitting the final 12:16 of the first half in foul trouble, and Matt Haryasz posted his fifth straight 20-point game with 24 points and 10 rebounds. 
He also made a gutsy pass to Hernandez in one crazy final minute of regulation. 
Hoy spun through the lane for the go-ahead basket with 
1:01 left in regulation, then came up with a big defensive play when he intercepted a bad pass by Mitch Johnson with 3 seconds left. Hoy con­verted two free throws with 
2.1 seconds remaining, but Stanford had a final chance. 
''I'm always confident as long as there's time on the clock," Stanford coach Trent Johnson said. "It always helps having a guy who can step up to the free throw line in that situation and keep his compo­sure."

Irish lose to Virginia, top Willian1 and Mary 

-
By KATE GALES Associate Spons Editor 
It was an up-and-down weekend for the Lrish, who dropped a heartbreaking 4-3 match to No. 1 Virginia on Friday but rebounded for a 7-0 win over William and Mary Sunday. ­
"We were right there to beat Virginia," senior Eric Langenkamp said. "We were up 3-2 with our two most clutch players [Stephen Bass and Sheeva Parbhu I still on the courts ... we just came up a litile short." 
The Irish have a big week­end coming up, with matches against North Carolina and Duke preceding a Tuesday match against Illinois. 
"I don't want to put too much importance on any one match," coach Bobby Bayliss said. "The season is a marathon, not a sprint ... but we need to be at our best." 
Virginia 4, Notre Dame 3 
The Irish and Cavaliers went down to the wire in a hotly­contested match at the Country Club of Virginia. The Irish struggled with a new lineup in doubles, as Ryan Keckley and Barry King fell No. 35 Somdev Devvarman and Trent Huey in the No. 1 doubles match. Although Bass and Langenkamp had won 8-3 at No. 3 doubles, Brett Helgeson and Sheeva Parbhu lost the No. 2 match 8-5 to give the doubles point to the Cavaliers. 
"Our level was as high as I've seen it from this team in a number of years," -Bayliss said. 
In singles, Keckley won 6-2, 6-4 at No. 5, but captain Patrick Buchanan fell 6-3, 6-1 at No. 6. The Irish reeled off two more victories to go up 3­2 with the top two singles matches on the court. At No. 4, Brett Helgeson topped Huey, who holds the No. 6 national ranking in singles play, with a 6-7,6-1,6-1 score. 
"Brett Helgeson looked as strong as we've seen any of our players play," Bayliss said. 
At third singles, King won 6­3, 6-7, 6-1 over Rylan Hizza. 
"Rizza is a tough out," asso­ciate head coach Todd Doebler said. "IThe match] showed how well Barry's improved." 
However, the Irish couldn't maintain the lead, as Parbhu fell 6-2, 3-6, 6-4 in the third set to tie the match at 3-3. Devvarman's win over Bass was the decisive point for Virginia. 
"[Notre Dame] didn't lose ­Virginia took it from them," Bayliss said. "We didn't have enough weapons to hurt them at the end." 
Notre Dame 7 William and Mary 0 
The Irish rebounded against a difficult Tribe team to post a dominant 7-0 victory to close out the weekend. 
''I'm pleased with the results today," Bayliss said. 
The Irish swept the doubles point, starting with an 8-3 win from Bass and Langenkamp at­third doubles. Keckley and King clinched the point with an 8-1 win ·at No. 1, and Helgeson and Parbhu complet­ed the sweep at No. 2 with an 8-6 victory. 
The Tribe was known to have strong doubles, and the dominant showing there was a coup for the Irish. 
In singles, Keckley was first off the courts with a 6-1, 6-3 win at No. 5. Parbhu followed with a 6-2, 6-0 win at No. 2. King clinched the match at third singles with a 6-4, 6-2 victory. 
"I think Stephen Bass showed a lot of poise after los­ing his second set," Bayliss said. "Ryan was all over [his opponent Dominic] Pagon ­he beat the ball to the net, it looked like sometimes." 
Helgeson posted another win at No. 4 with a 7-5, 6-2 win, and Bass won 6-4, 3-6, 6-3 at No.1. 
"Brett had such a big win the other night ... [but] he pulled himself together pretty well," Bayliss said. 
Langenkamp had a difficult match at No. 6 but pulled out a 4-6, 6-3, 6-4 win at the hard-fought position.

Team sweeps Invitational 
By DAN MURPHY Sports Writer 
In the last meet at Rolfs Aquatic Center this year, the Irish took care of business against four quality opponents, including No. 22 Penn State. The meet was scored as four separate dual meet competi­tions and Notre Dame swept. the other schools. 
The 4-0 performance leaves the team 10-2 overall for the second straight year. Penn State came the closest to upset-. ting the Irish (197-173), but Missouri, Louisville and Oakland all held their own in the water. 
"It was a very competitive weekend for us; the meet was not won until the next-to-last event," Irish coach Tim Welsh said. 
The 100-yard butterfly was the event that sealed it for Notre Dame -the Irish grabbed two of the top five spots to pull aw&y for good. 

Junior Ted Brown came in third and Patrick Heffernan was right behind in fourth in his last race at Rolfs. 
"It was a really significant and meaningful meet for the seniors who wanted to go out in a good way," Heffernan said. "We were glad to be able to rise to the level of our competi­tion and come out on top." 
This group of seniors, 10 in total, were the first swimmers to receive full scholarship sup­port from the university. 
As a group, they hav-e faced ofT against 61 difl'erent colleges and universities in three differ­ent countries. They leave behind them a long list of bro­ken records and program firsts, including a national rank and an invite to the Dallas Morning News Classic. 
"If you just look at what this senior class has done, you can see they were a big part of our improvement and they always will be," Welsh said. 
One of the biggest aecolades the Irish have achieved in the past four years is winning last year's Big East Championship -a feat they will try to dupli­cate in two weeks. 
With its regular season com­pleted, Notre Dame now goes into what is called a resting period. The team will spend the next couple of weeks men­tally preparing to defend its title. This means that instead of intense fitness training, prac­tices will be much more focused on attention to detail. 
Expectations remain high for the conclusion of the season, and after beating a strong Penn State squad, the Irish feel they have the ability to put up a solid performance after·the two-week resting period comes to a close. 
"This weekend's. hard test was good for us, we know we have the talent, we just have to swim as well as we can and let the rest take care of itself," Welsh said.

Squad svveeps Notre Dan1e Duals 
· By DAN TAPETILLO Sports Writer 
The No. 1 Irish women swept 
the field this weekend at the 
Notre Dame Duals as they fin­
ished 8-0 in the tournament and 
improved to 18-1 on the season. 
The most impressive showings 
for Notre Dame were its 19-8 
win over Duke and 18-9 victories 
over No. 7 Northwestern and 
Wayne State. 
Despite their No. 1 ranking, 
the dominance the Irish dis­
played over the field came as a 
slight surprise to coach Janusz 
Bednarski. 
"We have a new team and our 
ranking [is based off the] impres­
sion of the past and the champi­
onship that we won last year-

not changes in the roster," r-------------------------....,
Bednarski said. "We have big changes because we lost super­stars [whol were national cham­pions. So the new team has a much harder task." 
Epeeist Amy Orlando and sabreist Ashley Serrette helped the Irish to power their way past competition. 
Orlando topped two-time NCAA epee champion Anna Garina of Wayne State in a 5-4 overtime bout and Serrette recorded wins over All-American lbtihaj Muhammad of Duke 5-4 and Annie Massart 5-3. 
"[Serrette] was doing a beauti­ful job," Bednarski said. "She needs a little more experience, but she was bouting above expectations." 
However, despite the success Serrette found against Duke, she felt several of the calls were questionable during the competi­tion. 
"The director didn't call tim­ing, attack preps and just based it all off the lights," Serrette said, regarding the way the bout was scored. "And you can't do that. So [our teaml had to adjust." 
The women's foilists also need­ed to readjust their approach against the competition. 

"A couple of teams were a lit­tle rocky like Lawrence and Duke," foilist Adi Nott said. "But we held together pretty well." 
Nott fmished the weekend with double-digit wins in addition to foilist Emilie Prot's impressive showing throughout the week­end. 
Bednarski said the No. 2 men's team also performed higher than previously expected by defeating The men defeated No. 10 Duke 22-5 and Wayne State 22-5. 
The squad dropped less than 30 bouts over the weekend in improving its record to 18-1. 
"They show ambition, skill, and cooperation," he said. "They show a lot of potential. [Especially] the men's epee team, [which was] winning bouts against opponents who [were] rnally ranked higher and lhadl a very good style:'' 
The standouts in the men's competition came from epeeists Greg Howard (9-0) and fresh­man Karol Kostka (1 0-1 ). Both finished with wins over defend­ing NCAA runner-up Marek Petraszek. 
"Greg Howard was one of the heroes on the men's side," Bednarski said. 
Three other epeeists finished with double-digit wins -juniors Patrick Gettings (15-1 ), Jesse Laeuchli (14-1) and Aaron Adjemian (10-1). 
"!We arel a strong team with ability to achieve strong results," Bednarski said.

On the other side of the ice, Ohio State goalie Dave Caruso matched Brown savn for save, holding the Irish to just one goal, which came on a power play Saturday. 
"Ohio State's one of the top defensive teams in the country," Jackson said. "Part of that's Caruso, of course, but we out­chaneed them Friday night and couldn't score." 
Ohio State took Friday's matchup, shutting out the Irish and earning its seventh straight win in the series, a streak that dated back to Nov. 2003. Caruso made 28 saves, allowing few rebounds and stilling a Notre Dame attack that had scored at least two goals in each of its last seven games. 
"We were going to the net well, but Caruso didn't give up any rebounds," Jackson said. "Even if you go to the net well, if there arc no rebounds it doesn't matter." 
Buckeye right wing Mathieu Beaudoin scored the game's only goal at 14:28 of the second period when he blasted a shot past Brown from the right face­ofT circle.

Leaning back in his locker room seat after the losses, Irish guard Chris Quinn looks almost as con­fused answering questions as he does confident on the court. Brey sounds like a broken record mak­ing the same comments game after game. 
This begs an important question. How can a team that has suffered so many tough losses continue to press on in a season that is slip­ping away faster than an Allen Ray drive to the basket? 
Notre Dame talks about staying focused, continuing to put itself in situations where it can win games and "claw" its way to the Big East tournament. 
But let's look at it realistically. 

29 seconds to play, despite Carter's fouling out the play before on a reach-in at Foye (18 points, four assists), who made both free throws. 
Quinn responded by firing and missing a deep 3-pointer from the top of the key with time remain­ing on the shot clock. Wildcats guard Mike Nardi {5-of-11 from three, 22 points) contested the shot, and Villanova rebounded and rushed upcourt, finding guard Allan Ray for the lay up and the foul. 
Ray, who led all players in scor­ing with 23 points on 9-of-16 shooting, converted the free throw, putting the Wildcats up two. Quinn drove by Nardi on the ensuing possession and dished to Francis from under the basket to 
Notre Dame needed this one. Brey and the Irish players can say what they want about each game mean­ing the same thing, but a win over 'Nova would have been big. It would have given Notre Dame a win over a top-1 0 opponent in the middle of a difficult conference stretch. 
A victory over the Wildcats would have provided the neces­sary spark heading into Morgantown. If Notre Dame thought Villanova shot a lot of 3s, just wait until West VIrginia opens its own clinic Wednesday. The Mountaineers have taken 519 3­point attempts this season, com­pared to 349 for their opponents. 
It doesn't get easier from there. The Irish play road games against Louisville, Seton Hall, Connecticut and Providence. They are home against Rutgers, South Florida, Marquette and DePaul. 
attention, and Lowry elevated toward the miss for the tip and the win. 
"It'd be harder if we were get­ting blown out by 20 points," Carter said afterwards, "because we [would bel wondering if we're not good enough ... [But] every game, we compete." 
Irish shooting guard Colin Falls, who had made 49.1 percent of his 57 three-point attempts in the past five games, attempted only two shots Saturday against the quick, guard-heavy Wildcats. Notre Dame still managed to go into halftime down only one point, 35-34, by out-rebounding (21-to­
15) and out-shooting {48 percent­to-41 percent) Villanova. 
But Foye, Nardi and Ray would combine to score 63 of Villanova's 
A murderers' row of NCAA pow­erhouses? Not necessarily. But aside from South Florida and DePaul, each team has a better league record than Notre Dame. And as the Irish have already learned this season, every team in the Big East is tough, anyway {DePaul defeated the Irish 73-67 on Jan. 7). 
Notre Dame needs the confi­dence and respect that can only come with a big victory. Beating Villanova would have given Notre Dame a certain mental edge in its remaining games: It would have shown a team that truly believes in itself that they can win the close one. 
And it could have saved Notre Dame's season. 
But instead, the Irish need to continue to figure out how to change the script -a script that if not yet written in pen, gets closer and Ray in the first half. 

"Foye and Ray are pros," Brey said. "Some of it's not just ­when you're playing a team like Villanova -us not [getting the job done]." 
Notre Dame won the tap to begin the game, but neither team scored until Carter made 1-of-2 free throws with 17:00 remain­ing. Francis scored on a pass from Carter next to send the Irish up 3-0, but Ray responded with a 3-pointer to tie the game going into the first timeout. 
From there, Villanova recov­ered temporarily from an early shooting slump, making 3-of-6 to go up 11-9 with 11:56 remaining. Notre Dame then went on a 5-0 run and gained momentum on a Quinn-to-Carter alley-oop that 
with each devastating loss. 
Brey said Saturday his team needs to create its own luck. But in order for a team to create its own luck, it needs to shoot better than 6 7 percent from the free throw line. It needs to box out and elimi­nate second-chance points. It needs to quit making dumb fouls in key situations. 
Maybe a little bit of improve­ment in these areas will begin to rectify the situation. Maybe instead of a 6-foot-1 guard getting a game­winning tip against the Irish, a Notre Dame player will have one of his own. 
The Irish insist it isn't over. And given the makeup of the Big East, they might be right. Six teams have two wins or fewer as of Sunday morning. Another four teams have three wins. 
Notre Dame has a shot to make the statement in Morgantown it 
But the Wildcats made 8-of-16 three-pointers in the first half and held the lead, coming out in the second half on a 24-8 run that fmished with Cunningham's bas­ket. 
"That's how fragile the basket­ball game is," Brey said. "It's been a tough hump for us to get over, a tough hump ... If we can be in game situations and have a chance most of the rest of the year, that's probably all we can ask right now." 
Notre Dame is scheduled to play West Virginia (15-4, 6-0; ranked No. 9/13 at week's end) in Morgantown, W.Va. on Wednesday at 7 p.m.

failed to make at home against Georgetown and Villanova. A vic­tory would put the Irish right back in the mix and show everyone this is not a team destined for disap­pointment. But first Notre Dame needs to make it happen. 
So don't be surprised to see a similar look on Brey's face when Notre Dame tips off against West VIrginia. Sure, Brey said at the season's outset that he anticipated difficulty in reaching the Big East tournament, never mind the NCAA tournament. But with that said, a certain sense of panic must be starting to creep into Brey's mind. 
One that not even a slight smile can conceal.

HOCKEY 
Irish, Buckeyes split 
pair of 1-0 contests 
NO goaltender Brown allows just one score in two weekend gantes 
By CHRIS KHOREY Sports Writer 
One week after being pulled in a 4-3 come-from-behind win over Northern Michigan, Notre Dame goalie Dave Brown got his redemption against Ohio State. 
The junior allowed just one goal over two games as the Irish and Buckeyes split a two-game set, each winning 1-0 at Value City Arena in Columbus, Ohio Friday and Saturday. 
"David reacted pretty well to being pulled at Northern," Notre Dame coach Jell' Jackson said. "He played more [this weeki like he had been playing for the past six or seven weeks." 
Brown was pulled against the Wildcats after allowing three goals in the first period and a half. He was replaced by fresh­man Jordan Pearce, who held Northern Michigan scoreless and allowed the Irish to erase a two-goal deficit. Jackson said the move was intended to be a wake up call for his entire team, not just Brown. 
"It got him back on track, but pulling him was more for the rest of the team than for him," he said. "Dave carne back with good focus and obviously played well this weekend." 
Against the Buckeyes, Brown returned to his old form that has produced six career shutouts, tying him with Morgan Cey for the all-time Notre Dame lead. He made 21 saves Friday and added another 24 Saturday.

ND WOMEN'S BASKETBALL 



Team falls in overtime, 68-64 
By ERIC RETTER Sports Writer 
If head coach Muffet McGraw's reaction was any indication, Saturday's loss to South Florida may prove to be the model of how Notre Dame's season has gone: pre-game opti­mism quieted by major struggles, topped by a valiant late-game effort that just wasn't quite enough. 
"We just frickin' beat ourselves," said McGraw, who was visibly shaken after the game. "It's frus­trating." 

The Irish, who carne into the game eager to bounce back from a 69-43 loss at Hutgers on Tuesday, fell behind quickly, allowing guard Shantia Grace to make PHIL nuL<OLovw

MEN'S BASKETBALL 
Another day, another heartbreak 
NO loses to Villanova on tip-in with 1. 7 seconds remaining 
By PAT LEONARD SportS Writer 
It happened again. 

Villanova sophomore guard Kyle Lowry tipped in a Handy Foye miss with 1. 7 seconds remaining Saturday night, hand­ing Notre Dame a 72-70 loss at the Joyce Center. It was the sec­ond straighV loss in which the Irish recovered from a sizeable deficit, only to come up short as the clock wound down. 
Wildcats forward Dante Cunningham's layup gave his team a 59-42 lead with 10:42 remaining. The Irish (10-8, 1-6 Big East) crawled back from the 17 -point deficit, making 16-of-19 free throws down the stretch. 
But just like Tuesday's 85-82 loss to Georgetown -Notre Dame trailed by 15 late in the f'irst half of that game -the Irish could not linish, allowing a 6-foot-1, 190-pound sophomore to invade the lane and steal one for the Wildcats (15-2, 6-1; No. 6 at week's end).

Irish try to remain positive after string of frustrating defeats 
Irish coach Mike Brey had a very peculiar look on his face during the opening tip of Saturday's game against Vlilanova. Leaned forward with 
his eyebrows slightly raised, Brey was smil­ing. 
But it could­n't have been a confident grin, coming in with a two­game losing streak against the No. 6 team 
Associate

Sports Editor in the country. 
It was more 
likely one of anxiety. It's at that point for the Irish, who dropped to 1-6 in the Big East Saturday. Not even their head coach seems to know what is going to happen once the game begins. 
The 72-70 loss to Villanova should help Brey understand that Notre Dame's games have played out according to the same unfor­tunate script all season. Play flat and fall behind, come back unex­pectedly and lose a heartbreaker at the end.

TRACK AND fiELD 

Benninger runs n1ile in under4 
By JORDAN BELTZ Sports Writer 
There is a popular saying that records only exist so that they can later be bro­ken. After Friday's Notre Dame Invitational, junior Kurt Benninger is an avid believer of that motto. 
The All.-American Benninger ran a sub-four minute mile for the second time in his careeer, becom­ing the first runner in the 116-year history of the Notre Dame track and field pro­gram to do so. Benninger completed the circuit with a time of 3:58.77, which is the second fastest time in the nation this year, second only to Iona's Hichard Kiplagat. Benninger was less than a second off the Notre Dame record, Luke Watson's 
3:57:83 set in 2002 at the Meyo Invitational. 
"Kurt was especially moti­vated tonight," Irish coach Joe Piane said. "He ran with a purpose tonight, and we're really happy with the way
