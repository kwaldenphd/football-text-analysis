Cainpus celebrates coed Week 
By JASON McFARLEY. 
News Writer 
Events ranging from a screening of "The Godfather" to a campus kickball tournament will be part of a weeklong student government­organized celebration of the 30th anniversary of co-education at Notre Dame. 
Events begin Sunday with a charity run to benefit breast can­cer and end Oct. 13 with a Mass at the Basilica of the Sacred Heart and an ice cream social in the din­ing halls. 
"We really want to recognize this important anniversary, and we want students to talk about it and participate in the events," said Student Body President Libby Bishop. 
Organizers wanted the week to be a balance of fun and serious events, said Katy Hall, chairman of the gender division of Bishop's office. 
Chandra Johnson, assistant to University President Father Edward Malloy. will give a lecture on gender relations Monday. On Wednesday, Bishop will moderate a panel WPdnrsday that includes students, faculty and administra­tors who were on campus in 1972, when Notre Damp first admitted women as undergraduates. 
The week also includes a kick­ball compntitinn between quads on Tuesday and a Thursday show­ing on North Quad of "The Godfather," the 1972 Best Picture Oscar winnrr.

Scientists unlock inosquito gene 
. Results affect malaria research 
By ANDREW THAGARD News Writer 
A sequence of 260 million let­ters, consisting of only A, T, C and G specifically arranged ­that's what Notre Daine's Center for Tropical Disease Research and Training Director Frank Collins and his fellow researchers have to show for over two years of work. 
This sequence, however, isn't a random assortment of letters. It represents the genome of Anopheles gambiae, the primary mosquito species responsible for transmitting the malaria parasite to humans. It is the second insect genome to be sequenced ever. 

Collins and a team of researchers, including scientists at Celera Genomics presented their fimlings earlier this week at a Washington D.C. press confer­ence sponsored by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), the organiza­tion that provided the bulk of the funding for this endeavor, and in a series of articles featured in the journal "Science." 
Getting started 
Sequencing the mosquito genome involved a combination of preliminary research, laborato­ry work, computerized sequenc­ing machines and gene place­ment. 
According to Collins, researchers raised a laboratory population of genetically similar insects, ground them up, extract­ed and amplified the DNA and usPd maclrines housed in Celera to do the actual sequencing using human derived algorithms. 
"I would say it [the sequencing process} is really tedious," said Nora Besansky, Associate Professor of Biology and fellow researcher at the Center. "It's what you do with it [the genome} afterward that's fascinating. Just determining the order of four nucleotides isn't very interesting; in fact it's mind-bogglingly bor­ing. It's deciphering the code and figuring out what it means that's that's going to take years." 


The machines, however, do "shotgun" sequencing, printing out sequences of DNA segments in the .order that they're processed. It · was up to researchers like Maureen Hillenmeyer, a 2002 Notre Dame graduate and assistant to Collins at the Center, to ,put the sequences together using bioin­formatics, a computational tech­nique. 
"Our lab was involved in assembling 50 to 100 scaffolds in tho right order," she said. 

In fact, the result,; presented by Collins and other researchers are just a rough draft of the mosqui­to's genornP. Scientists have to analyze and present the informa­tion in a computerized database complete with interpretative information before it can be truly used by the scientific community. 
"[The genome] has got gaps and interpretations of what are supposed to be genes based on SQftware, not on biological experi­mentation," Collins said. "There's going to be a continuing effort ... of 'fulish.i.ng' and some additional experiments to validate the data." 
been a massive collaborative effort between scientists and lab­oratories around the world and when the genome is presented in database format it will be avail­able to anyone interested in doing additional research. 
Assessing the implications 
The mapping of. I.he mosquito's genome, according to Besansky, completes the genome sequenc­ing of organisms involved in the malaria cycle. The disease, prominent in sub-Saharan Africa. is caused by the parasite Plasmodium falciparum which first resides in mosquito and then human host'l. 
Scientists recently sequenced the human genome and researchers presented the 23 mil­lion base pair sequence of the malaria parasite at a press con­ference this week. 
"This is a big milestone," Besansky said. "We've sequenced the genome. All of these bits of data were integrated to give a product that is biologically real. It will enable us to locate g~:nes of interest that affoct specific biolog­ical phenomena." 
Coach wants sea 



of green 
By ANDREW SOUKUP News Writer 
When Notre Dame beat Michigan three weeks ago, Irish head coach Tyrone Willingham donned a green shirt to 
match the Kelly green "Return to Glory" shirts. · 
Now, he's calling for Irish fans to follow 

his lead Willlngham 
and turn N o t r e Dame Stadium into a "Sea of Green" for Saturday's game 
against Stanford. 
"Our fans should buy into making our stadiums some­thing special," he said Wednesday. "When we have 80,000 of them ... unifying around our colors and buy­ing into the spirit and the enthusiasm and participating

that special environment and that's what we want this place to be, to be that special environment." 
To help Willingham's vision turn into a reality, Irish offi­
cials printed 70,000 green placards -similar to the flags printed to commemo­rate Sept. 11 last year -and plan to distribute them Saturday at the Stadium gates. School officials are also calling on fans to wear green clothes to the game. 
The idea to create a single unified color inside Notre Dame Stadium started bouncing through adminis­trators' minds last year. After The Shirt committee selected a Kelly green design and the Irish jumped out to a quick start, Willingham felt it was a good time to make a

Give education majors respect. 
When people hear education major, they instantly think it is a blow off easy major. However, secondary and middle school education majors do not receive the credit they deserve. 
Think about it, 
not only do these pre-service teach­ers carry a full course load in their major. but they also spend their time in class­es devoted to learning teaching

tomorrow and how to keep a classroom under control. 

As if this weren't enough, these pre­service teachers also spend numerous hours in a high school or middle school classroom putting all the things that they have learned together while actually teat.bing students and learning from experienced cooperat­ing teachers. 
While this all seems clean cut and possibly just time consuming, let me assure you it is also a challenge to live up to the standards that the Saint Mary's education department places on their students. For instance, when the pre-service teacher is expected to teach it cannot be a lecture, even though that is what we are all used to. But rather a "hands on, minds on" activity that provides a big idea for the students to strive to achieve. What does this mean for the pre-service teacher? A lot of planning and tweak­ing of unique unit plans to ensure the students are receiving all they can possibly get out of an individual unit. 
Now when I'm talking unit. I'm not talking about a day-by-day lesson plan. I'm talking about what activities the students will be working on for several weeks. and what is the ulti­mate assignment to test the students of their understanding without using a traditional test. For the pre-service teacher, this entails reading all the material prior to assigning it, working out the activities, figuring out a way to grab the student's attention and keep it for the length of the unit and keep the students in order and deal­ing with behavioral problems, all the while completing their own class work for their major. 
For example, if pre-service teachers are in their content classroom twice a week chances are they are also plan­ning lessons and grading papers at least twice a week as well and going to school activities and getting their foot in the door attending professional developments. For pre-service teach­ers who also work this becomes quite a balancing act for them to deal with. Therefore, when someone says he's an education major, think twice before making the "coloring is easy" cracks about the major, it's all not like that.

The University's top student life official praised a student govern­ment report 1.0 the Board of Trustees Thursday, saying trustees and administrators were "almost entirely in agreement with" student leaders' plan to improve campus housing. 
But timing and money will

Shots fired at U.N. headquarters: 
A Korean-American protesting against the North Korean government emptied a seven-shot pistol in fr,ont of U.N. headquarters Thursday, hitting several offices but injuring no one, authorities said. The gunman was identified as Steve Kim, 57, a natural­ized U.S. citizen. He's married with two sons, works for the U.S. postal service and lives in Des Plaines, Ill. FBI spokesman Jim Margolin said Kim was prob­ably born in Korea. 
Nigeria urges U.N. on arms deal: 
Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo urged U.N. members Sunday to seek a legally binding agree­ment to curb trafficking in small arms, which he said worsens many conflicts in Africa. The United Nations has passed an action plan calling on gov­ernments to require manufacturers to mark such weapons and keep records so illegally trafficked arms could be traced.

Bush declares La. a disaster area: 
President Bush on Thursday declared a disaster in Louisiana, acting just hours after a downgraded but still powerful Hurricane Lili bit the state's coast. The declaration makes people in the affected areas eligi­ble for federal financial aid, which can include disas­ter housing and low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses. Bush last week designated about a dozen counties in the state as disaster areas in the wake of Tropical Storm Isidore. 


Jeb Bush angers gay rights groups: 
Florida Gov. Jeb Bush told a delegation of law­makers that he had "some juicy detail" about the sexual orientation of a missing Miami girl's care­takers. During a meeting Wednesday, Bush implied that the two women, who had just been charged with fraud stemming from the investiga tion into Rilya Wilson's disappearance, were les­bians. 
8 youths charged in mob beating: 
One boy said he does not attend school because his mother does not know where to send him. Another was arrested for burglary before he was 10. His father is dead and, at 14, he's a father himself. A third in the mob of boys accused of beating a man to death with broomsticks, shovels and poles said he took part because he didn't want anyone calling him scared. It was still unclear Thursday how many boys were in custody overall, or why they beat Young so brutally. 

NYC schools chief announces reforms: 
The city will begin an effort to reform its 1,100 public schools with a $3.75 million analysis of the system, Chancellor Joel Klein announced Thursday. "The simple, universally acknowledged fact is that our schools are not doing the job they must and should do for our kids," said Klein, the former Justice Department lawyer chosen by Mayor Michael Bloomberg in July to head the school system.

The anniversary of co-education holds special meaning for Bishop, Notre Dame's second female stu­dent body president. Both her par­ents are 1977 alumni. the second four-year co-ed class to graduate from Notre Dame.

McDonald's experiences troubles 
Changing tastes have knocked McDonald's Corp. off the fast track and some industry analysts are wondering whether changes at the top aren't necessary to get the company moving again. 
The fast food industry is struggling to adjust to changing consumer tastes and McDonald's has drawn the most attention. 
Since Jack Greenberg took over as chief executive in 1998 the market capitalization of the world's largest fast-food company has dropped from $42.5 billion to $23.2 billion. 
"For shareholders I hope that they make some changes," said Allan Hickok, restaurant analyst for U.S. Bancorp's Piper Jaffray unit. 
"You've given this team long enough .... The company would benefit from some new blood and fresh ideas." 
And a recent Merrill Lynch note on McDonald's asserted that "more investors are calling for a management shake-up," though there is no evidence of one happening. 
Texas farmers blast water treaty 
It's the time of year when growers take their ledger books to the bank, negotiat­ing loan terms on how many acres of crop or grove they plan to tend in early spring. 
But with irrigation in question, some are staying home. 
During prolonged drought, the grid of irrigation canals crisscrossing the tip of Texas depends on water that comes from Rio Grande tributaries far away in Mexico. 
A U .S.-Mexico water sharing treaty negotiated in 1944 secured that water, until recently. 
On Wednesday, another of the treaty's five-year accounting cycles ended with Mexico about 450 billion gallons in arrears, and the Rio Grande as low as ever. 
Farmers here blame Mexico for over­planting and now hoard_ing the water. They blame the U.S. government for fail ing to enforce the treaty. 
NYSE chairman regrets Stewart's resignation

Associated Press 

NEW YORK 
Martha Stewart, dogged by questions about her role in the ImClone Systems Inc. insider trad­ing scandal, has resigned from the New York Stock Exchange's board of direc­tors. 
The decorating entre­preneur announced her departure Thursday, a day after an assistant to her stockbroker agreed to help 
prosecutors investigating 
Stewart's sale of lmClone stock before the pharma­ceutical company's shares plunged. 
"I did not want the media attention currently surrounding me to distract from the important work of the NYSE and thus felt it was appropriate to resign," Stewart said in a statement after she sent her resignation letter to Dick Grasso, the NYSE's chairman and chief execu­tive. 
Grasso said the board would miss "Ms. Stewart's counsel and insight," and said her departure was her own.

New claims for jobless benefits 
A.socia.ted Press 
New claims for jobless benefits rose last week, highlighting the difficulties workers and companies are facing as the economy struggles to return to full health. 
For the work week ending Sept. 28, new applications for unemployment insurance climbed by a seasonally adjusted 5,000 to 417,000, the Labor Department reported Thursday. The increase was slightly larger than ana­lysts were predicting and followed a drop of 18,000 in the prior week. 
For six weeks straight, new claims for unemployment benefits have been above the 400,000 mark, a level asso­ciated with a stagnant job market. 

"The claims data thus point to a marked deterioration in job conditions in late summer but the deterioration so far is not cascading as it would do in a recession," said Maury Harris, chief economist at UBS Warburg. 
Separately, the Commerce Department reported that orders to 
U.S. factories were flat in August, after jumping by 4.4 percent in July. While the performance was better than the decline in orders forecast by analysts, a more forward-looking report released this week suggested that manufacturing is stalling. 
A third report Thursday showed activity in the service sector grew at a faster than expected pace in September. providing a dose of good news for the economy. 
The Institute for Supply Management said its nonmanufactur­ing index, which mostly includes busi­nesses in the service sector, rose to 
53.9 in September from 50.9 in August. Analysts were expecting a reading of 52. A reading higher than 50 signifies growth; a reading under 50 indicates a contraction. 
"The solid bounce ... provides some hope that the economy really is not turning south," said economist Joel NaroiT of Naroff Economic Advisors. 
Nonetheless, the overall labor pic­ture looks weak.

The Parents Council was 
founded in 1966 to bridge the 
gap between the students, 
parents and the college. The 
mission of the council is to 
serve the college and other 
parents of students by provid­
ing communication between 
the two. 
"They are an advisory board that represents the rest of the pa.rents." Susan Dampeer, Assistant to the President, explained. 
The council consists of par­ents who have students in all classes, differing occupations and geographic diversity. This year there arc several alumni and trustees on the council. 
Gathering twice a year the group meets to discuss the needs of the student body. Council members are able to keep other parents informed by providing a website that is specifically for parents of the college. 
Members of the council offer further financial support to the college. Over the years the council has raised money to fund programs, student scholarships, the Trumper Computer Center and the Dalloway coffee house.

Anthropologist explains NGOs' role in Bangladesh 
By JOE TROMBELLO 
News Writer 
Rockefeller VISiting Fellow and anthropologist Lamia Karim pre­sented research gathered during her fieldwork in Bangladesh Thursday at a lecture for International Studies. 
Her talk "The 'Surrogate' 
Capitalist: Women-Targeted Programs and the Emergence of New Technologies of Control in Bangladesh," is part of the Kroc Center's lecture series on reli­gion, conflict, and peace building. She focused on the role that non­governmental organizations (NGOs) have played in the social and economic lives of poor Bangladeshi women. 
"[NGOs] has resulted in the reproduction of usury in rural society," Karim said, "and women have emerged as a new class of small moneylenders. The poorer the borrower, the lower is her ability to invest money pro­ductively." 
The NGOs present in Bangladesh are large and corpo­rate, having millions of clients and tens of thousands of employ­ees. These organizations clain1 to promote the empowerment of women as investors and econom­ic providers, but Karim showed how the system's structure instead fosters to further control and subjugate women. Most women are ordered by their hus­bands to participate in the NGOs microlending program; they have no control over the matter, Karim said. 
"It LNGOs] has reallv become a business -in the 1990s, more and more NGOs have moved away from providing social ser­vices to providing microcredit lending," she said. 
The system of microlending works as the World Bank lends money to these non-governmen­tal organizations in Bangladesh at extremely low interest rates. The NGOs then lend money to groups of poor Bangladeshi woman at proposed interest rates of 16 percent. 
However. due to hidden fees and obligations, the interest rates climb to about 50 percent, a practice Karim called loanshark­ing. 
Those women organize them­selves into groups and are then expected to lend the money to their established network of rela­tions and kin. When a single woman is unable to pay her loan back on time, the NGO withholds new loans from all the women. 
Karim said that while in Bangladesh, she witnessed women selling the pot of rice they needed to feed their children so that they could pay back the NGOs the following morning. 
"Everyone from the fieldworker to the management director of the NGO knows what is going on," Karim said. "There is no desire to raise the issue because they have a very good [economic] system in place." 
Further complicating matters is the system of social violence and public shaming that punish women who default on their loans. If a woman is unable to 
pay back her loan, the matter is turned over to the woman's hus­band and hor kin, who often break apart the family's house simply to take and sell the build­ing materials so that the NGO can recover its money. Pubic shame, verbal abuse, forced selling, and repossession are all common tac­tics that these NGOs capitalize on. "What is particularly interest­
ing is that we have kin members doing it [tearing apart the family home]. The NGOs have inserted themselves to make the commu­nity internalize these codes of violence," Karim said. 
The NGOs have also recently launched police cases against defaulting members -these women, branded as criminals, dishonor both themselves and their husband and his lineage, and it is often very difficult for a woman to come back to her hus­band's home after such public shaming, Karim said. 
"Women embody men's honor and reassure the NGOs of secur­ing their investments," she said. 
Karim proposed a dual-fold system to improve the situation of poor Bangladeshi women. She said that the NGOs should make contracts with indMdual women as opposed to enforcing group contracts and should also find and train women to provide them with skills so that they could do something with they money they have been lent. 
"[We have a] total brutalization of human beings -using shame as a means of social control. Poor women have become pawns of the political agendas of NGOs,"

Fisher men pledge to sit for Betsy as dorm celebrates 50th 
. Celebration of dorm's 50 years benefits child 
By C. SPENCER BEGGS News Writer 
This weekend, the 180 resi­dents of Fisher Hall plan to show how the dorm's presence on campus since 1952 can make a difference for one fami­ly. 
The 50-year-old residence hall will commemorate its gold­en anniversary by presenting "50's at Fisher," a benefit event for the familv of Adam Greenwood, a second-year law student at Notre Dame. 
Greenwood's daughter Betsy, just over one year old, was diagnosed with a brain tumor last May. "50's at Fisher" will raise money to help alleviate the cost of treating Betsy's con­dition. 
"50's at Fisher" was original­ly scheduled to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Fisher Hall, but organizers decided to make the event a benefit for the Greenwood family when they were informed about the situa­tion. 
"We had been planning on celebrating our 50 years as a dorm and, basically, we wanted to put on an event for campus. But, when we heard about the situation there was a plea for dorms to help raise money and we thought, 'Why not combine the two?' lt's a perfect opportu­nity," Fisher assistant rector Tony Desapio said. "The administration and facilities have been really supportive." 
The fundraiser, which revolves around the number "50," will feature a 50-hour roof-sit, where 11 members of the hall staff -including the rector and both priests-in-resi­dence, Father Richard Warner and Father Tim Scully -will take turns sitting on the roof of the dorm for 50 straight hours, rain or shine. At least two members of hall staff will occupy space on the roof at any given time. 
The University has pledged to donate $50 to the Greenwood family on behalf of each dorm that has 50 resi­dents visit tho benefit. Members of the Student Bar Association of the Notre Dame Law School also recently teamed up last month to raise money for Betsey by sponsor­ing the Dean Links Hoop Classic. 
Fisher also will hold a silent auction for a Time Magazine with U2's Bono on the cover autographed by the Irish band's lead singer. Other prizes throughout the evening include autographed copies of one of former head football coach Lou Holtz's books. 
The dorm will have live music from The Kinky Boot Beasts. kicking off with their SO-song pop medley, and have refresh­ments available. Fisher resi­dents will also perform Fisher's "Feats of Strength," including eating 50 raw eggs and a 50­lap tricycle race.

Scientists suspend gene therapy studies 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON 

Scientists have suspended studies of the first gene therapy ever to work -a treatment that appears to cure a rare immune disorder called "bub­ble boy disease" -as they scramble to tell whether the therapy gave a French toddler a leukemia-like side effect. 
It's unclear if the gene thera­py actually caused the boy's ill­ness, although there are clues that a virus used in the treat­ment may be to blame. No other children given gene ther­apy for the disease -severe combined immunodeficiency, or SCID -have shown such a side effect. 
The French boy's gene thera­py, performed in October 1999, was successful, giving him a strong immune system. But in late summer, doctors discov­ered his body had far overpro­duced a type of white blood cell, a disorder they call leukemia­like. Now 3, he is responding well to chemotherapy, scientists said Thursday. 
France and the United States suspended further studies of gene therapy for SCID while they evaluate what happened and notify parents of previous gene therapy recipients of the possible risk. 
Advisers to the Food and Drug Administration will con­sult with French scientists and meet next Thursday to debate

what steps are needed before the U.S. studies could resume, said Dr. Phil Noguchi, FDA's director of gene therapy. 
The highly publicized moves were unusual -in studies of regular drugs, many people typically become ill before research is put on hold or gen­erates public debate. But gene therapy has been a publicly charged topic since the 1999 death of 18-year-old Jesse Gelsinger, who was given a dif­ferent type of gene therapy for another disease. Many scien­tists now believe that openly discussing potential risks as they're discovered is important to educate people about the new technology. 
SCID gene therapy "has been a spectacularly successful endeavor up to this point," said Savio Woo of the American Society of Gene Therapy. If it truly poses a risk of leukemia, "then we have discovered a new enemy. Once we know the enemy, then the experts in the field will...be able to come up with strategies of how to deal with it." 
SCID is a very rare inherited disease, occurring in about 1 in 75,000 births, in which patients' bodies don't make cer­tain proteins crucial to develop­ing disease-fighting immune cells. Without treatment they die very young. The best-known victim was David, Houston's famous "bubble boy" who lived in a germ-proof enclosure until his death at age 12 in 1984. 




Researchers test anthrax vaccine 
Associated Press 
vVASHINGTON 
The government has created a new, genetically engineered anthrax vaccine that promises to cut in half the six shots now needed for protection, and chose a pair of biotechnology companies to begin testing it. 
The contracts, awarded Thursday for $22.5 million, will allow California-based VaxGen Inc. and Britain's Avccia to test the experimental vaccine on people to see if it is safe and, if so, to see if it provides protec­tion against the deadly bacte­ria. 
Federal authorities hope that together. the two companies will pave the way toward Food and Drug Administration approval for the vaccine. Eventually. the government wants 25 million doses manu­
factured and  added  to  the  
National  Pharmac eut ical  
Stockpile.  

VaxGen said it plans to begin testing for safety by mid-2003 and finish by the end of next year. 
The current anthrax vaccine works well, experts say, but it requires six shots over 18 months plus an annual booster and it causes certain side effects. Last spring, a scientific advisory panel endorsed the existing shots, but recommend­ed development of the next generation of vaccine, one that would require fewer shots and cause fewer side effects. 
The search for a replacement took on new urgency after last fall's anthrax attacks, discov­ered a year ago Friday when health officials announced that a Florida man had mysteriously contracted the disease. Later, as more cases emerged, investi­gators learned that the spores were being spread through the mail. 

"There is an urgent need to devise more effective measures to protect U.S. citizens from the harmful effects of anthrax spores used as instruments of terror," Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy Thompson said in a statement Thursday announcing his agency's grants. 
Federal scientists working at the Army's lab at Ft. Detrick, Md., have already developed the science behind the promis ing new vaccine. There arc three proteins that make anthrax deadly, and all must work in concert to cause infec­tion. The experimental vaccine engineers one of them, called protective antigen, which stim­ulates the body's immune sys­tem so that it can recognize and fight anthrax should the person actually be infected later. 
The private companies must now try and translate this tech­nology into a practical vaccine. They must create samples for testing, then test the vaccine on a few people to see if it is safe. If these so-called Phase I trials work, the vaccine would be tested on larger groups of peo­ple to ensure it protects against infection -steps vital for FDA to ultimately approve its sale. 
On Thursday's news, VaxGen stock-rose 13 percent, or $1.17 per share, to close at $10.17 in trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market. Avecia is privately held. 
The existing vaccine, manu­factured by BioPort of Lansing, Mich., also uses the protective antigen, but the protein was not genetically modified using today's modern techniques, said Robert Myers, BioPort's executive vice president. He added that his company's vac­cine may also be effective when delivered in two or three doses, testing that is now under way. 
The current vaccine is not now offered to civilians who have not been exposed to anthrax. It is, however, routine­ly used by the Pentagon. 
All existing vaccine was under control of the Defense Department until this summer, when HHS and the Pentagon agreed to split the stockpile and each take half. 
It's not clear if the vaccine could protect when adminis­tered after exposure to anthrax. Still, federal health workers offered it to congressional staffers and postal workers who were exposed during last fall's attacks in hopes it might offer greater protection than antibi­otics alone. Only about 100 peo­ple opted to receive it, though. 
That's partly because the gov­ernment gave no recommenda­tion about the vaccine, leaving it up to each person to decide whether to get the shots. That caused a lot of confusion, some­thing officials said Thursday they are trying to avoid as they plan to eventually offer a vac­cine against another potential bioterror agent -smallpox.

For evening, any of this stuff goes, depending on how daring you want to be. The excellent black silk tuxedo jacket could be worn as shown -over noth­ing but legs -and a dangling pair of rhinestone necklaces for the hips. Or you could match it with one of the fancy skirts or pants. 
Or, for the real comic-strip look, another of the show's themes, you could don a ser­pentine black cat woman look with wing effects and sequined skirt. 
At Torrente, things were calmer and charming. Designer Rose Mett gave youthful pep to her collection, with plenty of white and beige safari-style clothes. Neat, slim trouser suits or outfits with low belts and some bare midriffs, are surely looks for next spring. 
White leather hot pants and bras with a leather short coat would be swell for St. Tropez in the spring. 
For those who love romance, Mett shows plenty of silky and sequined outfits in the most del­icate baby pinks and blues.

The proposed plan to build new dorms on campus that include suite and/or apartment style amenities and to renovate other dorms to also include those features reflects a positive step in student-administration relations. The students are reaching out and the administration needs to do the same.

showed that 80 percent of students who were either living or planning to live off campus would move back or stay if they were offered more acceptable housing options. 
The Board of Trustees needs to seriously consider the Office of the Student Body President's plan. But whether or not they accept it, they need to make changes to the current system of on-campus housing. As the University has developed, its hous­ing system has been left behind. It's time for Notre Dame to give students a campus on which they want to live by offering a choice of on campus housing styles. ending the single-sex only dorm system and abolishing parietals. 
Time and again. the students have called for these changes and time and again they have been denied. But now the Board ofTrustees is faced with an option: make changes or watch Notre Dame's campus atmosphere continue to deteriorate.

VIEWPOINT 
Friday, October 4, 2002 page 17 
Where's the class? 
Watching the Michigan game a few weeks back, it became apparent to all of us just what "Lack of class" was. We watched the definition of low class as a Michigan player overtly attempted to injure Carlyle Holiday. But talk­
John Litle 

ing about classless­ness and Michigan is a redundancy in 
Frankly

terms. And 
Obnoxious·

Michigan State makes Michigan look like the Charisse Leroux School of Etiquette for girls, But enough about football, I want to talk about the low class that I see on this campus -the lack of common human courtesy that we endure every day. 
Topping the list of classless members of the Notre Dame community is the Notre Dame Security Police. Oh wow. attacking the agency that both knows me and my car by name and sight ­yes. Let's redefine low class. On Sept. 11, between about 4 and 7 p.m.. can any of you remember where you were? For almost everyone on campus the answer is, "At the Sept. 11 Mass in front of the Reflecting Pool." 
But if you were a Notre Dame securi­ty officer, your answer would be, "Walking through D2 handing out $50 no decal tickets like candy, since I 
knew lots of people from off campus 
would probably be parking there to get 
to the Mass.'' 
Am I saying that the NDSP doesn't have the right to ticket people during perhaps the three most sensitive hours . on the most sensitive day of the year? 
Of course not. I'm just saying it shows a 
complete and total lack of class. 
Though outdone by the NDSP, Father 
Mark Poorman strives for low class 
excellence. Father Poorman, it seems, 
thought that it wasn't enough to ticket 
38-year olds last year for tailgating ... 
no, no, no. There is far more to come 
from this generous contributor to our 
low class administration. Poorman 
decided that he'd make all the students 
think of him as generous by allowing 
student tailgates -in a roped off 20­
by-20 yard pen the absolute farthest 
distance from campus he could possibly 
find. And he named it "Blue Field 
South." 
So. on top of his undeniable total lack 
of regard for student input, and his 
unbelievable ability to treat students -like children as he did last year. he has now chosen to be offensively demean­ing with his "student playpen" out back of Blue Field. Try again, Father Poorman; you've come up once more as straight no class. 

Oh, I can go on. In fact, I think I will. Striding hard not to be outdone are the stadium ushers. Words cannot express the abject hatred I feel for these power-tripping, rent-a-cop wannabes, or at least for the one in charge of their new ID checking policy. Why is it nec­essary that I wait 10 mjnutes in a line to get into my section? Becattse some over-eager authoritarian megalomania­cal jerk in charge of the ushers decided that.all tickets and IDs must be checked to let people into the student section. 
Well let me tell you tliis. It's not working, Hans. First, you're just anger­ing students by creating this attempt at keeping their guests out of the student section. Notre Dame students don't care if other student's guests come in our section. We've all had guests. and we are more than willing to allow oth­ers to bring theirs (assuming they don't puke on us). We have class. We are generous and giving. To whomever is in charge of the ushers, if you really have to get out all that pent up angst or something, go beat up schoolchildren or smash mailboxes. Stop interfering with my game. Low, low class. 
Lastly, circling back to my favorite clown and yours, Father Poorman, we come to last week's SYRs, if you can call them that. Sure they got mixed reviews; I read that article. Father Poorman and Father Doyle liked them; everyone else didn't. But that's fine. I love being forcibly exiled from my home for six hours a night so I can go to a dance. Sounds like a sacrifice you'd love to make. What, Father Poorman, would you say if I told you that every time you go to Mass, you have to wait six hours to go back home? I'm sure you'd put your time to use by finding some students to terror­ize, but still it'd be quite an inconve­nience. Thanks anyway for getting stu­dent input on the policy change. Classless. 
One more thing -let me catch you before you start writing your Viewpoint letter. You're probably going to say that this column was low class, and that I exemplify everything I complain about. Fair enough, I'll take the blame. Someone needed to say it.

War pigs, aristocrats and reality TV: Our only choices for 2004

The FX network, Fox TV's red-headed stepchild, has 
plans for a 2004 television series called "American

pete for the presidency of the United States. 
No, really. 
Actually, I'm starting to think it might be a good 
idea; in fact, I may even end up voting for the TV win­
ner. God knows that, albeit commercial, this system 
has at least as much merit as our current one, which, 
although it is known as "democracy," more resembles 
the aristocracy of royalty. 
Think about it. George W. Bush is the son of a for­
n1er president who was the vice president of yet anoth­
er president. That's Reagan, for those of you keeping 
track (and who would, anymore?), which means our 
current president is part of a royal family that began 
its reign in 1980. 
Sure, there was a Democrat somewhere in there, but 
that's a whole different bloodline. After Clinton-Gore, 
there was almost Gore, and now another Clinton is 
likely licking her chops in anticipation of the throne. If 
she indeed is elected, we could be in the middle of a 
36-year stretch that really only includes two adminis 
trations. 
So what is the result of our royalty? We have a presi­

"Outlined against a blue, gray October sky the Four Horsemen rode again. In dramatic lore they are known as famine, pestilence, destruction and death. Th1csc are only aliases. Their real names are: Stuhldreher, Miller, Crowley and Layden." 
These words have become a symbol and legacy to Notre Dame students, as we recall four great men of our past. Four men who are now known as the most fabled quartet in college history; four men who returned glory to the Notre Dame Football Stadium. 
Their presence surrounds us and we can feel their power within the stadi­um, but do we really know much else about the Great Four Horsemen truly arc?

MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL 
Cardinals slip by Schilling, take 2-0 lead 
Associated Press 
PHOENIX 

They battered Randy Johnson and eased past Curt Schilling. The St. Louis Cardinals headed home needing one victory to fin­ish off the World Series champi­ons Arizona Diamondbacks. 
But an injury to Scott Rolen dampened the Cardinals' 2-1 tri­umph over the Diamondbacks. 
Miguel Cairo's ninth-inning single off reliever Mike Koplove drove in Edgar Renteria with the go-ahead run for the Cardinals, who swept the first two games of the best-of-five series. 
"A split would have been good for us," said Chuck Finley, who blanked Arizona for 6 1/3 innings. "Obviously, coming out of here 2-0 looks very, very good. This is what we dreamed of doing," 
Rolen left after he was clipped in the left side by pinch-runner Alex Cintron while scooping up a grounder in the seventh inning. X-rays were negative, and the preliminary diagnosis was a sprained shoulder. Further tests were scheduled for Friday in St. Louis. 
"I do think that his continuing to play for sure in this series is very questionable," manager Tony La Russa: said. "We'll have our fingers crossed through tomorrow, but I think there's a chance he might have played his last game (this year)." 
The Diamondbacks, who had trailed 1-0 since the third inning on J.D. Drew's two-out horner off Schilling, tied it with an unearned run in the eighth. 
Quinton McCracken doubled over the outstretched glove of the right fielder Drew to score Greg Colbrunn, who had reached on a fielding error by Albert Pujols -Rolen's replace­ment at third. 
With the late Darryl Kile's widow Flynn again in the stands, as she was for the opener Tuesday night, the inspired Cardinals moved within a victory of returning to the National League Championship Series for the second time in three sea­sons. 
''They're the world champions and will keep fighting until the end," the Cardinals' Fernando Vina said, "but it will be a nice flight back to St. Louis." 
After enduring the death of Kile and longtime broadcaster Jack Buck during the season, St. Louis can complete the first­round sweep with a victory at Busch Stadium on Saturday. Miguel Batista pitches for the Diamondbacks against Andy Benes. 
Finley, two months shy of his 40th birthday, held Arizona to four hits innings before leaving with a muscle cramp in his pitching hand. 
Acquired from Cleveland on July 19, Finley went 7-4 with the Cardinals. The left-hander had been 0-2 in the postseason com­ing in, losing twice to Seattle in the first round last year. 
"You can't give him enough credit," La Russa said. "The first couple of innings, he made great pitches, then he pitched even better. He showed up so big for us." 
The Cardinals pelted Johnson for 10 hits in a 12-2 rout Tuesday night. Schilling, who had struggled in his last seven starts, proved a much tougher challenge. He scattered seven hits, struck out seven and walked one. 
·"Sometimes you do your job and still get beat," he said. 
Even the 2-2 pitch that Drew hit into the left-field seats was a good one. 
"That was not your typical hanging home run pitch," Diamondbacks manager Bob 


Brenly said. "It was a fastball down around the knees." Catcher Damian Miller called it "a perfect pitch." 
"It was down and away, maybe off the plate a little bit and below the knees," Miller said. "It probably wasn't even a strike, but J.D. 's a pretty good hitter." 
Drew had one of two three-run homers off Schilling last week in Arizona's 6-1 defeat in St. Louis, but struck out in his first at-bat. 
"That pitch was one I had used to get him out several times," Schilling said. 
A year ago, Schilling beat the Cardinals 1-0 in his first division series start. In Game 5, Drew's eighth-inning homer off Schilling tied the score 1-1, but Arizona advanced on Tony Womack's run-scoring single in the ninth. 
Schilling, 27-3 in the regular season, escaped a jam in the seventh inning. 
Mike Matheny singled with one out, then was forced at second on Finley's sacrifice attempt. That brought up Vina, who was hit in the leg near the strike zone while attempting to bunt. Vina got into a heated argument with plate umpire Bill Miller, who ordered the runner back to first, and Vina singled on the next pitch, putting runners at the corners. Schilling walked Drew on four pitches, loading the bases, then struck out Jim Edmonds to the cheers of the capacity crowd. 
Renteria, the hero of Game 7 for Florida in the 1997 World Series and persistent trouble­maker against Arizona, led off the ninth with a single, then was sacrificed to secol'J.d. 
Cairo, who had entered during a double-switch an inning earli­er, singled up the middle. 
'Tm blessed right now," Cairo said. 'Tm in the best organiza­tion in baseball. They have been treating me so well. To get that base hit makes it much better. What a beautiful day today for me." 
Jason lsringhausen pitched a perfect ninth for the save. Vina was 4-for-5, making him 7-for­11 in the series.

MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL 
Braves even series -with Giants 
Associated Press 
ATIANTA Kevin Millwood is back, and :;o are the Atlanta Braves. 
Millwood allowed only three hits in six innings and the Braves evened their NL Division Series with San Francisco at one game apiece, beating the Giants 7-3. 
Filling in for Greg Maddux, Millwood earned his first post­season win since 1999 with a strong performance, which neatly summed up his recovery from two poor seasons. 
"I was real fired up," he said. "I knew this was a big game for us. We definitely didn't want to go to San Francisco down two games. That was probably as excited or pumped as I've been all year." 
Millwood, who threw only 72 pitches, was replaced by a pinch-hitter shortly after he hit the ground on a fielding play at first base. The Braves ini­tially said he wasn't hurt, but Millwood conceded his groin was sore. 
"It's nothing that would real­ly affect anything," he said. "I don't think it would bother me for a Game 5." 
Barry Bonds went l-for-4, hitting a massive, meaningless homer off John Smoltz in the ninth. It was only the second postseason homer for Bonds,

the other coming off Atlanta's Tom Glavine in the 1992 NL Championship Series. 
"I was able to have the luxu­ry of messing with Barry," Smoltz said. "In that situation, he couldn't hurt me." 
The Braves wasted no time bouncing back from an 8-5 loss in Game l. Chipper Jones had an RBI single in the first, and Atlanta went ahead for good when Javy Lopez and Vinny Castilla led off the sec­ond with back-to-back homers off Kirk Rueter. 
Mark DeRosa, making his first postseason start, doubled his first time up and came in to score on Rafael Furcal's bloop single, capping a three­run second. 
DeRosa drove in two runs of his own in the fourth, slicing a triple into the right-field cor­ner. He trotted home to make it 6-1 on Benito Santiago's passed ball, the All-Star catch­er's second defensive miscue of the series. 
Rueter lasted only three-plus innings, allowing seven hits and six earned runs. In his two previous postseason appear­ances, he gave up one earned run in 11 1/3 innings. 
"Kirk got some balls up," Giants manager Dusty Baker said. "His ball was not sinking as much as usual. He was throwing about 77, 78 {mph], which is almost too hard for the ball to sink." 
Chicken 

Charbroiled 
Millwood's only major mis­takes wound up in the seats. 
J.T. Snow hit an opposite-field homer in the second, and Rich Aurilia went deep in the sixth. Santiago had the other hit off Millwood, a leadoff single in the fifth. 
The Atlanta starter threw just 18 balls, struck out seven and walked none. His most trying play came in the sixth, when first baseman Julio Franco let a grounder by Kenny Lofton skip off his glove. Franco recovered and flipped to Millwood, who stretched far enough to get Lofton before tumbling to the dirt. 
On the very next pitch, Aurilia homered into the left­field seats. Jeff Kent grounded out to end the inning, and Millwood was done for the night with the Braves holding a five-run cushion. 
"He was so fired up he just about wore himself out," man­ager Bobby Cox said. "He was absolutely done after the last out he got." 
Millwood was originally scheduled to pitch Game 3, but the Braves moved him up because they were worried about a blister on Maddux's pitching hand. 
That turned out to be a huge break for Atlanta, which avoided falling behind 0-2 in the best-of-5 series before it shifted to San Francisco.

Crouch thinking about return as QB 
Associated Press 
LINCOLN. Neb. 
Heisman Trophy winner Eric Crouch, who quit the St. Louis Rams three weeks ago, said he would consider returning to professional football if he can play quarterback. 
The Rams drafted the for­m er Nebraska quarterback last spring as a wide receiver. 
"If I play again I'd definitely say it would be as a quarter­back," Crouch said. "My whole life I've been a quarterback. I've molded myself that way. 
"My best football is when the ball's in my hands and I have some control over what hap­pens." 
Crouch left the Rams after playing in only one preseason game and seeing no regular­season action. Crouch said his decision was based primarily on lingering injuries, not because he was turned into a wide receiver. 
Crouch, 23, said he has a serious thigh bruise and other nagging problems, including wear and tear on an ankle that will require surgery next week. 
"I need to get away from it a little bit to get my health back," he said. "It's going to

be a goal of mine to get back in shape." 
Crouch was the starting quarterback for three years at Nebraska. He said his body didn't respond well to practic­ing a new position in the NFL. 
"The way I was playing wasn't up to the standard I thought I could play," he said. "It was just too hard to contin­ue the way I was feeling." 
Crouch said he has no time­line for a return to profession­al football, but he said it will only be after he is healthy. 
He said the odds of a return 
are 50-50.  
And  if he never  played  
again?  
''I'd  be  OK  with  that,"  

Crouch said. 
Crouch, drafted in the third round in April, quit the sport only nine months after playing in his last college game. The Cornhuskers lost that game against Miami in the Rose Bowl for the national champi­onship 37-14. 
The Huskers have struggled since Crouch left, falling to 3-2 and dropping out of the Top 25 for the first time since 1981. The team practiced on the field at Memorial Stadium as Crouch answered questions from reporters for more than 30 minutes.

PGA TOUR 

Duval returns to old form by firing a 64 
Associated Pre11 
WILLIAMSBURG, Va. 
With his passion for golf renewed by his Ryder Cup expe­rience and his game in a better state than it has been for some time, David Duval once again made Kingsmill Golf Club look easy. 
Duval shot a 7-under 64 -his best round of the season -and shared a two-stroke lead after the first round of the Michelob Championship. 
"Out there playing last week at the Ryder Cup and today, I felt like me," Duval said. The intense competition against Europe, he said, restored "some passion that I found I had been missing for quite some time." 
Hidemichi Tanaka, at 5-foot-6 and 132 pounds likely the smallest player in the field, birdied three of the last four holes for a 64. He missed a right-to-left, 11-foot birdie putt on the par-4 18th. 
"I was thinking if I put this in, I will be on top of it and I knew I would come to the interview room and I was wondering what I would speak about in here, that pressure," Tanaka said through a translator. 
Tanaka, who has been in 28 PGA events this year as a rook­ie, had eight birdies and one bogey -the par-4 10th -and said bouncing back right away with a birdie at the par-4 11th kept him going. 
Duval tried building on his experience in England, where he posted a 1-1-1 record for the 
U.S. team in its defeat against Europe and felt like he played well. 
With his back feeling better, a nagging shoulder injury finally healed and his game coming around, Duval is planning to play in three or four events the rest of the year -and antici­pating doing great things.

Mets continue to lose as $2 m.illion is stolen 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK 
Even with their baseball sea­son over, the New York Mets' losing streak continues. 
A trusted ex-team employee, three of his co-workers and two other suspects surrendered for allegedly stealing $2 million from the team between 1994 and 2000, Queens District Attorney Richard A. Brown announced. 
Former Mets executive Russell Richardson, 46, of Hempstead, was identified as the reputed ringleader of the group. Richardson, who spent 17 years with the club, used his insider's position to illegally make $600,000, Brown said. 
"There was a series of schemes involving bribes, kick­backs and other illegal pay­ment," Brown said. The money was taken from Sterling Doubleday Enterprises, the Mets' parent company, through five separate scams, the prose­cutor said. 
It was the latest in a series of

The Mets, after an internal audit turned up irregularities, turned the case over to the dis­vices, faces up to 25 years in prison for alleged grand larce­ny, falsifying business records and other crimes. 
Co-defendant Haim Shaked, 47, of Brooklyn, a vendor who did business with the Mets, faced the same possible sen­tence as Richardson. 
According to Brown, the scams operated in a variety of ways. The simplest involved overbillling the Mets, like charging $50 for a $25 box of copy paper. The most complex involved the creation of a phony company that collected $350,000 for nonexistent com­puter and telephone equipment. 
"It's alleged the Mets were ripped off to the tune of $2 mil­lion over 6 years," Brown said.

Bobby Bowden 'whips' Tommy and Clemson 
Associated Press 
TALLAHASSEE, Fla. 
Bobby Bowden defeated his son one more time, and he said this time it hurt to do it. 
"I had to win the stinking game and I had to whip him to do it," Bowden said after No. 11 Florida State beat son Tommy's Clemson Tigers 48-31. "It's not fun when you whip your son. [But] I didn't tell him to get into coaching." 
The 72-year-old Bowden has won 328 games, including four straight over his 48-year-old son. The 328 wins are two fewer than all time-leader Joe Paterno of Penn State. 
The Seminoles (5-1, 4-0 Atlantic Coast Conference) showed little confi­dence in their passing game and benched sophomore quarterback Chris

And their schedule gets tougher with No. 1 Miami next on Oct. 12. 
"From what I see, it's Miami and the rest of the world," Bowden said. "We're not at that level yet." 
But he was glad to bounce back from last week's 26-20 defeat at Louisville. 
"Clemson is playing with a lot of con­fidence and enthusiasm," Bobby Bowden said. "They scared us." 
Greg Jones ran for three touchdowns, breaking eight tackles on the final one, and set up a fourth with a long run that helped the Seminoles take a 28-24 half­time lead. 
"I was just wanted to play good against the home team," said Jones, 


who is from South Carolina and visited many of his former high school acquaintances in the Clemson locker room after the game. 
"I don't know how many tackles I broke." Jones said. "I was just trying to make it look good." 
The Seminoles took advantage of poor special teams play by Clemson (3-2, 1­
1) to take the lead at halftime. They took control behind Jones and a punish­ing running game in the second half. 
Jones, who gained 160 yards last year at Clemson, finished with 165 yards on 22 carries to give the Seminoles their 11th straight win over Clemson since they joined the ACC in 1992. 
Florida State's go-ahead touchdown was set up by Jones' 64-yard run on Florida State's first play after Clemson took its last lead, 24-21, on Willie Simmons' second touchdown pass of the half. 

Jones. a 240-pound junior, scored on runs of 20, 1 and 21 yards. His second TD gave Florida State a 35-24 lead mid­way through the third quarter.

Gophers defeat struggling Illini 
Associated Press 
MINNEAPOLIS 

With a short week to prepare, Minnesota rebounded nicely from a poor showing in its Big Ten opener. 
Defending conference cham­pion Illinois continued to strug­gle. 
Terry Jackson II rushed for a career-high 159 yards and Thomas Tapeh added 113 yards and a touchdown to lead the Golden Gophers past the Fighting Illini 31-10. 
After the offense sputtered in a 28-15 loss to Purdue last week, Minnesota was much bet­ter. 
"I'm pleased," coach Glen Mason said. "We did fairly well." 
Illinois coach Ron Turner obviously wasn't able to be as positive. 
"We need some success ­we've got to fight through it," Turner said. "We're frustrated -we've got to keep fighting and turn this thing around." 
Asad Abdul-Khaliq was 15­for-27 for 144 yards, throwing one touchdown pass and an interception. He also ran for a touchdown. 
"We had something to prove," Abdul-Khaliq said. "We flopped last week. myself especially. So we came out with more focus this week and made plays." 
Abdul-Khaliq. who sprained his right ankle against Purdue, suffered a leg cramp in the fourth quarter and watched on crutches from the sideline, but he said he would be all right. 
Brandon Lloyd caught five passes for 139 yards for the Fighting Illini (1-5, 0-2), who replaced quarterback Jon Bcutjer late in the third quarter with Dustin Ward. 
Turner didn't know who would start in the next game, Oct. 26 against Indiana. 
"It's a tough situation," he said. "Every mistake is magni­fied." 
The Illini had switched from Ward to Beutjer for the home opener against Arkansas State, their lone victory, after the offense scored just two touch­downs in losses to Southern Mississippi and Missouri. 
A sign that, again, it wasn't Illinois' night: Ward hit Lloyd for a 49-yard pass on his first drive to the Minnesota 8, but fullback Carey Davis fumbled on the next play and the Gophers recovered. 
Beutjer was 14-for-29 for 165 yards and a touchdown. He fumbled three times, losing one. 
"We're beating ourselves," Beutjer said. "We're making too many mistakes and that'll kill you. We know what we're capa­ble of -we've just got to think positive." 
The Gophers, who surpassed last season's victory total of four, were missing defensive captain Mike Lehan, their best defensive back, to a deep thigh bruise against the conference's top passing offense. 

The Illini punted on their first six possessions (five in the first quarter) and the offense didn't score until Walter Young's 16­yard touchdown reception mid­way through the second quar­ter. 
Beutjer's pass on the 2-point conversion attempt was tipped, but Young snagged it and got one foot in the end zone before he fell out of bounds to tie the game at 10. 
Eugene Wilson intercepted Abdul-Khaliq on the next pos­session, the Illini's first pick of the season after 185 pass attempts by their opponents. But after driving Illinois 7 3 yards in 10 plays to the Minnesota 2, Beutjer fumbled as he was sacked by Bradley Vance. 
Mike Losli fell on the ball for the Gophers with 2: 10 left before halftime. 
"Lucky," Vance said. "I saw a pulling guard come across, so I knew it wasn't a run. I just went to the quarterback."

Coughlin gets shrink for Jaguars 
Associated Press 
JACKSONVILLE, Fla. 

Tom Coughlin wants the Jacksonville Jaguars to get in touch with their inner football player. 
Never known as a real touchy-feely guy, Coughlin has hired a sports psychologist to help his players absorb the long grind of a difficult foot­ball season. 
Sports psychologists aren't a totally unheard-of notion ­some golf and tennis players have one or two on call at all times. 
But this sport? This team? This coach? "It's surprising, because Tom is a little old-school," 
~ quarterback Mark Brunell 
~ said. Coughlin said he hired psy­chologists Chad Bohling and Trevor Moawad from IMG Academies in Bradenton because he heard they've had a positive impact on other athletes. The Jaguars arc the only NFL team Bohling and Moawad work with. 
"There can be some real progress made, particularly if you have a young team and a team you'd like to get started in the right phase," Coughlin said. 
Coughlin said the Jaguars psychologists have spoken to the team in a group setting a handful of times. Individual players can schedule time with the psychologists, as well. 
Fred Taylor is among those taking biggest advantage of the service. 
"I thought I was fine," he said. "I didn't think I needed a shrink. I'm not a nut case. But I told them, I'll do it any way. If it's free, it's me." 
Actually, Taylor had some experience with this kind of thing when he played at Florida, where he did a lot of visualization exercises before 
games. 
The fifth-year pro. who has struggled to stay healthy through his short career, said this might have helped him get through last season's long ordeal with a groin injury. 
"You get rid of everything negative, and just try to get your focus on something that's positive," Taylor said. 
Through a series of videos and lectures, Coughlin wants the psychologists to help play­ers set individual and team goals, then teach them how to achieve them. 
The coach, not always known for being deft in his relationships with players. said it's all part of trying to deal with a young team. 
"I just think it's an impor­

tant thing for our football 
team, and probably for all 
young people, to be able to 
deal with all the things that go 
on around the professional 
athlete today," Coughlin said. 
Does the coach ever go in 

for any one-on-one with the psychologist? 
-

"For myself, no," he said. "A psychiatrist, but not a psy­
chologist."

The Irish graduated freestyle/butterfly specialist Carrie Nixon, backstroker and freestyler Kelly Hecking, breast­stroker Allison Lloyd and diver Heather Mattingly. However, the team returns 23 swimmers and divers to the team and five NCAA Championships qualifiers. 
Last season, junior butterfliers Lisa Garcia and Lisa D'Olier qualified for the NCAA Championships in both the 100 and 200 events after placing second and third, respectively, in the 100 at the BIG EAST Championships. 
Sophomore Brooke Taylor will add depth to the event, and per­haps the biggest addition to the roster is Singapore Olympian Christel Bouvron. Bouvron par­ticipated in the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games in the 100 and 200 fly. She enters her Notre Dame career with the fastest incoming time ever posted by a freshman and could challenge Nixon's record of 54.07 before the end of the season. 
Led by All-American Marie Labosky, as well as Garcia, D'Olier, senior Amy Deger and sophomore Kelli Barton, the Irish look to be extremely com­petitive and deep in both the 200 and 400 individual medley races. 
Senior Heidi Hendrick, Danielle Hulick and sophomore Katie Eckholt look to replace Nixon in the 50-yard freestyle. 

A weakness the past few sea­sons, the Irish addressed the middle distances this season. Sophomore Sarah Alwen will 
'move from backstroke to the 200 and 500 freestyle, while freshmen Bouvron, Courtney Campbell, Mary Steffan and Kalei Walker make the Irish even deeper. Notre Dame will have to make up for the loss of Mattingly, who became the first diving All­American in Irish history and qualified for the NCAA meet three times in her career. Junior Meghan Perry-Eaton has returned to full strength after missing the 2001 season with an injury. In the distance races, NCAA qualifier Barton will lead the Irish. She will be helped by seniors Nicole Kohrt, Christina Jackson, Katie Cavadini and Sara Cerreta. Also, Deger, Cavadini and Hendrick will pro­vide leadership as they were all voted captains by their team­mates for the 2002-03 season. The mens team lost eight from the 2001-02 roster including Notre Dame recordholders David Horak and Johnathan Pierce, but Welsh welcomes back 20 men from last year, as well as nine talented freshmen.

Teddy is the fastest returning 1,000 freestyler on the roster and has the third-fastest 500 time on the team. Freshmen Patrick Davis, Heffernan and O'Berry should also contribute immediately in the distance races, as well as senior Michael Flanagan, sophomore Matt Bertke, who has the fastest returning time in the 1,650, and junior Matt Obringer, who has the quickest returning 500 free time. 
In the sprint freestyle events, the Irish should be improved, but will be very young. Krakowski returns with the fastest times from last season swimming a 21.05 in the 50 free and a 46.14 in the 100. Drew Pittman, Adam Cahill, Travis Kline and Obringer will also be back, but freshmen Tim Randolph, Doug Bauman, Chris Barnes could see a lot of early season action.

WOMENS INTERHALL FOOTBALL 

Walsh qualifies for playoffs with 7-0 victory 
ByJUSTIN SHUVER and PAT LEONARD 
Sports Writers 
The Wild Women of Walsh were true to their name as they celebrated on the sideline after defeating Pasquerilla West 7-0 in Thursday's interhall football action. 
They had good reason to be excited. The Wild Women will continue on to the playoffs, The Purple Weasels will not. 
"All of our touchdowns this year have been important," Walsh captain Alison Troy said. "It was a great play." 
The "great play" occurred late in the fourth quarter after Walsh started a drive with good field position on the PW 28-yard line. 
Three runs gave Walsh a first down on the PW 20-yard line, and the Wild Women were finally able to break the scoreless tie. 
On second down, the Wild Women ran a 20-yard reverse to running back Katie Hesmond that drew almost the entire Purple Weasels defense to the right side. as Hesmond was able to rumble down the left sideline untouched for the touchdown. 
Facing a heavy pass rush. quarterback Carrie Campbell was able to complete a pass to Claire Hadley for the point after the touchdown, giving Walsh a 7­0 lead. 
The Purple Weasels were unable to score on their answer­ing drive, and were unable to stop the clock from running out as the Wild Women rushed onto the field to celebrate their play­off-clinchjng v1dn. 
"This was definitely a strong defensive game," Troy said. "But our offense has been steadily improving in the past few games as well." 
One positive Armstrong and the Purple Weasels can take solace in is the fact that several receivers had excellent days catching the ball by taking advantage of at least three tips by Wild Women defensive backs. 
"We've got some athletic girls and they're just sacrificing their body and going up to make that catch," Armstrong said. 
His team's best chance to score came near the end of the second half, when the Purple Weasels drove from the PW 21-yard line to the Walsh 3-yard line before turning the ball over on downs. 
"We should have scored on that two-minute drive," Armstrong said. "The game should've been ours!' 
Welsh 18, Badin 0 
Lauren "L-Train" Hoeck tossed three touchdown passes, two of them to senior wide receiver and captain Vanessa Lichon. as the Welsh Family Whirlwinds beat the Badin Bullfrogs 18-0 at Stepan fields on Thursday night. 
Badin entered the contest with a 3-1 record, coming off a 26-6 win over Pasquerilla East The Whirlwinds smothered the Bullfrogs' offense and threw the ball at will in their shutout victo­ry. A loss early in the season to Breen-Phrnips shocked the defending champion Whirlwinds.

Now. however, they see them­selves as back on track. 
"BP played a zone and con­fused us a bit," Hoeck said. "But now we practice against man-to­man and zone defenses. We're ready for everything teams throw at us." 
Hoeck was ready Thursday. She tossed 30-yard and 40-yard touchdown passes to Llchon and another 18-yard touchdown, col­lecting 153 yards in the air. The option also worked well for the Welsh offense. 
"It's such a different atmos­phere [around the team since the Breen Phillips loss]," said Hoeck. "It's fun to play again." 
Badin crossed midfield only once the entire game on a long pass to the Whirlwinds' 20-yard line, only to be intercepted the next play. 
"We couldn't get the first downs tonight," captain Courtney Giel said. "Our defense played great, but we had a few miscal­culations there as well. We lost. of course. hut we're not out of it. We're looking forward to our game next Thursday. ___ .. 
The Welsh Family coaches are all business and are pleased with the team's rebound from the pre­vious loss. 
"We started the season well then hit some rough spots. There was a little bit of team discord," coach Joe Blaney said. "But we've practiced hard and now we're back to where we should be."

Belles get pair of victories 
By CHRIS FEDERICO Sporrs Editor 
After dropping a competitive match to MIAA leader Alma last weekend, the Saint Mary's volleyball team enjoyed a week of non-conference competition this week. 

The Belles rolled through Manchester College in straight sets Tuesday night 31-29, 30­21 and 30-22. 
The Belles used some domi­nating serves from outside hit­ter Alison Shevik to pull ahead of Manchester in the first game. 
"Alison was a key player for us in that first game." Saint Mary's coach Julie Schroeder­Biek said. "She went back to the line to serve with us down 20-27 and single-handedly turned it around. She served seven points in a row and was very aggressive to give us that victory." 
Shevik finished the match with eight kills for the Belles. Freshman Heidi Superczynski paced the squad in kills with 
12. She committed no errors and had a season-high .632 hitting percentage. 
Sophomore setter Bridget Wakaruk had 11 assists and four aces for Saint Mary's. 
Thursday night, the Belles swept an overmatched Tri­State University squad 30-24, 30-20, 30-26. The victory marks the second time this season the Belles have beaten Tri-State, the first time coming in Saint Mary's second match of the season in the Alma College Tournament. 
"We saw Tri-State once this year in the Alma tournament and beat them then as well," Shroeder-Biek said. "They have gone through a lot of transition in the last two years with three coaching changes, so their pro­gram is not the strongest right now." 
Superczynski again paced the Belles in kills with eight. Wakaruk contributed 15 assists, 10 digs and had four aces for her second consecutive match. Shevik led the team in

really difficult game for us on Sunday." 
Injuries have decimated the Irish since the beginning of this season and this weekend is no different. The midfield 
will be a major question mark 
heading into this weekend. 
Starting midfielder Ashley 
Dryer will not play again this 
weekend due to an ankle she 
suffered two weeks ago 
against Rutgers. Starting mid­
fielders Randi Scheller and 
Katie Thorlakson did not 
practice this week either and 
their status remains uncertain 
The Irish did receive a bit of 
good news when forward 
Melissa Tancredi and 
Gunnarsdottir returned to 
practice on Wednesday. 
Waldrum is hopeful that both 
players will see action this 
weekend. The Notre Dame 
defense will still be without 
Pruzinsky, who has seen 
action in only one game this 
year. Her future availability 
for the rest of the season 
remains highly doubtful. 
"Every team has its injuries," Notre Dame forward Amy Warner said. "Ours might be worse than others, but we cannot use that as an excuse. At this level. you can't expect to have the same ten or eleven players healthy for each game. You need at least fifteen or sixteen to be a good team. 
"We have to turn around 
our season this weekend. We 
don't have a lot of time left."

MENS SOCCER 

Solid play, no results not enough to satisfy Irish 
By JOE HETTLER Associate Sports Ediror 
The No. 16 Notre Dame mens soccer team played well on the road last weekend but didn't win either of its games. They don't want that happening again this weekend when they face Pittsburgh and Akron. 
Coach Bobby Clark's team looks to improve their Big East record on Friday before travel­ing to Ohio to face the Zips in a non-conference game on Sunday. 
"Last week we played really well, they were probably two of our better games but we didn't get the results we wanted," mid­fielder Justin Detter said. "We're just catching some bad luck right now, but that's ok." 
The Irish hope to turn that luck around by taking advantage of their home game against the Panthers. 
"Our big philosophy is no one comes in our house and out-

me. They want what's in the best interests for me and they know what's right." 
Earlier in the week, Willingham said the Irish wouldn't have a definitive timetable on reaching a decision. When asked Thursday if he had works us," Detter said. "So we have to work hard against Pittsburgh because they're big, they're strong and they start all seniors. I think if we just go out and play our game and out work them then we'll be fine." 
One of the positives that came from last weekend's games was the confidence the Irish received from playing well against two for the best teams in the country. 
"My freshman year [the team was] like 'We're going to pack the box and just hope we maybe get a breakaway or something,' " Detter said. "But now it's like we go into these places and we expect to win. I think we just know that we're there now and just progress that last step and win big games when the chance is there." 
Notre Dame has only beaten Pittsburgh one time in their seven previous meetings. That lone victory was a 3-0 Irish shutout in 1996 at Alumni field. The Irish have never beaten Akron. losing six games and tying two others. But the two teams have not met since 1989. 

The Irish offense is led by Erich Braun's six goals and Detter's four. Defensively, goalie Chris Sawyer has been solid in the box allowing only 1.12 goals per game. 
The major disadvantage for Notre Dame may be the amount of games they have played lately. Playing two games over the weekend, especially on the road wears players and coaches down. 
"It's starting to get a little old, but that's one thing coa:ch Clark talks about," Detter said. "He always refers to the Premier league overseas, they play so many games that your bench players are going to have to step up every once in a while. It's getting harder but coach Clark is really big on preparing us." 
The Pittsburgh game begins at 
7:30 p.m. at Alumni Field.

a possible starter in mind, Willingham quickly responded. 
"I knew someone would ask me that," he said, "and I knew I wouldn't answer that." 
If Holiday is unable to play, Dillingham will make his first college start just two weeks after he threw a 60-yard game-win­ning touchdown pass against Michigan State. Offensive coordi­nator Bill Diedrick said Notre Dame's preparation won't change for Saturday even though he's not sure who will start. 

Earlier in the week. Diedrick suggested the Irish would make a preliminary decision on Holiday's status after Thursday's practice. But Thursday, the offensive coordinator said the decision might not be made until the Irish return to the locker room after warm-ups Saturday. 
"I think the thing you always look at along the line of those endless lists ... is what's best for the team, what is best for Carlyle. what is the best for everybody," Diedrick said. "There are a lot of factors that will go into it and have already gone into it." 
Right now, the Irish are bal­ancing starting Holiday -the clear-cut starter if he is healthy ­against the idea that a big hit could knock him out for the rest of the season. On the flip side, Dillingham has played only 20 minutes of college football. Additionally. the Irish haven't decided if Holiday would take over if Dillingham can't move the ball. 
The only thing the Irish know for certain is that they know nothing.

ND CROSS COUNTRY 

Squads face difficult fields

By JOE LINDSLEY 
Sports Writer 
Until now, the Notre Dame mens and womens cross coun­try teams have been dominant in both of this season's races on the Burke Memorial Golf Course. 
Today, though. as the Irish runners host the Notre Dame Invitational, both squads are setting their sights on second, not first place.

powerhouse Stanford Cardinal is flying in for a little racing on the links. 
"We just want to compete well and see how we compare to Stanford," sophomore Todd Mobley said. "We'd like to get second at least, and see what happens from there." 
"I want to go out and compete really, really well and if we get second in the race, I'll be real happy," added Irish womens coach Tim Connelly. "Ifwe go in and compete as well as we can, that's what I'm looking for. We're not focusing on

to No. 2 as possible," Stanford, the freshman Tim third-ranked Todd Mobley Moore said. Notre Dame Irish runner 'Tm basically 
womens team will take on No. 18 Wisconsin, No. 27 Indiana and a variety of other teams ranging from talented Washington to top-ranked Division III squads. 
Although the competitive level will be raised in today's race compared to the previous two, the Irish will still try to employ their strategy of running in packs. 
Two weeks ago, against less formidable competition at the National Catholic Championships, Connelly had his runners stick together at the front of the field during the entire race. The approach to the Notre Dame Invitational will be similar, although implementing of the strategy will be altered because of the caliber of teams present. 
"The race plan will be the same," Connelly said. "We have to look for each other early and find each other and race togeth­er. We're not going to say, 'Okay all nine of you go out and be together every step of the way.' We have certain groups that we'll try to get to be with each other." 
Connelly has also been impressed with how the fresh­men on his team are adapting to collegiate running. 
"Most of those freshmen didn't have people on their [high school] team[s] to race with them," he said. "It's a whole new thing learning to race and train. They're doing a really great job." 
The freshmen on the mens squad have also seemingly made the transition to collegiate cross country well, despite the added challenge of having to increase their race distance from the high school stan­
going to try to 

let the older guys do the work for me and try to reap the benefits by sitting on their shoulders for most of the race, and run as hard as I can." 
Moore, who trained with Mobley when they were both in high school, won last year's Foot Locker National Championships -the nation's premier high school cross coun­try race. 
With freshman talent like 

·Moore on board, the 23rd­ranked Irish are confident they can handle all of Friday's com­petition, except for Stanford, the number one team in the nation. Mobley, Notre Dame's fastest runner, is expecting to see a challenge on the individual level too. 
"It's my first tough individual competition," he said. 
Mobley will be pitted against such top runners as Stanford's Don Sage, who, like Mobley, achieved All-America status last year. 
Although the Burke Memorial will be filled with some intense racing this weekend, Notre Dame has even more challeng­ing days ahead. 
"It's the first important meet 

on the schedule," Mobley said. "It's still nothing compared to the later meets."

ND VOLLEYBALL 
Lineup change may be in cards for Irish 
ByMATTLOZAR 
Spores Writer 
Despite starting Big East 
action with two wins Jast week­
end, Notre Dame volleyball 
coach Debbie Brown was not 
satisfied with her team's pass­
ing. This week in practice, 
Brown has been experimenting 
with a lineup change to get the 
Irish's passing to be more con­
sistent and improve the team's 
defense. 
Traveling to Hutgers and 
Seton Hall this weekend, Brown 
may put outside hitters Meg 
Henican or Jessica Kinder at 
the libero position. If Jessica 
Kinder, who usuallv starts at 
outside hitter, is used at libero, 
then Henican will take her 
place in the starting lineup. 
After surviving a scare from 
Connecticut last Friday and get­
ting an ugly win last Sunday 
against St. John's, Brown needs 
to get her team performing bet­
ter with every Big East team 
gunning for the three-time 
defending regular season con­
ference champ. 
"We don't prepare any differ­
ently for conference road 
matches than non-conferences 
road matches," Brown said. 
"But, I think the one thing that 
when we go into conference 
play is that in the conference 
we are definitely the team they 
want to knock off with us being 
the defending champions. 
"l think there is more of an 
intensity from the other teams 
to beat us. I think sometimes 
that might be more in confer­
ence than in non-conference 
matches." 
The Irish (11-3, 2-0 in the Big 
East) look to continue a num­
ber of streaks on this week­
end's road trip. They have 
never lost to Seton Hall in 
seven previous matches and 
Rutgers in nine previous 
matches. Notre Dame's current 
Big East regular season win­
ning streak is at 36. 
Despite neither the Red Storm nor the Pirates playing a Big East match this season, Brown is not worried about being surprised by this week­end's opponents. 
"Both of the teams haven't 
changed a lot from last year," 
she said. "We are really famil­
iar with their tendencies." 
Rutgers (11-4, 0-0) finished second in the Big East last year but was swept by Notre Dame at the Joyce Center. The Scarlet Knights are currently first in the Big East in opponents hit­ting percentage and have the conference's leader in kills in outside hitter Shayla Bush. 
"Shayla Bush is Rutgers' best player and was their go to play­er last year," Brown said. "She is a very good outside hitter and is good all-around. A focus for us is to stop her." 
.. The Pirates (8-10, 0-0) were 6-6 in the Big East last year and were also swept by the Irish at the Joyce Center. They have lost three in a row and four of their last six matches. Setter Shawn McDonald is third in the Big East in assists. 
"Seton Hall has Kari Belin 
who has been playing well and 
their setter has done a good job 
keeping their offense bal­
anced," Brown said. "We feel 
pretty good about what they 
are going to do and feel better than we did last weekend going against UConn and St. John's." 
Notre Dame plays Rutgers on Saturday and travels to Seton Hall on Sunday. 
Notes: 
. 
With their impressive block­ing performance last weekend, including 22.5 team blocks against St. John's, the Irish are currently the top blocking team in the country with a 3.82 blocks per game average. Middle blocker Lauren Brewster's 1.58 blocks per game average ranks her sev­enth nationaJ!y. 

. 
In the Big East conference. the Irish are third in hitting percentage, fourth in assists, third in opponents' hitting per­centage and third in kills.

No time better than now 
. Irish face pair of must-win games against Pittsburgh and West Virginia 
By JOE LICANDRO Sports Writer 
The phrase "must-win
"' 
game" is an overused expres­sion in sports. For the Notre Dame womens soccer team, there is no better way to describe this weekend games with its back against the wall after two home losses last weekend. 
On Friday, Notre Dame plays Pittsburgh and on Sunday they travel to West Virginia in two critical Big East matchups. 
The Irish are reeling right now after suffering two heart­breaking, one-goal losses last weekend against Villanova and Georgetown. Even worse, Notre Dame fell to fourth place in the Mid-Atlantic Division of the Big East Conference, putting their hopes for an unprecedented eighth straight Big East title in jeopardy. With an overall record of 6-4 and a divisional record of 2-2, the Irish des­perately need to win this weekend to stay in the race for a berth in the Big East 
SMC GOLF 
post-season tournament. 
"This is a must-win for us. We've discussed the impor­tance of this weekend as much as you could possibly discuss it," Notre Dame coach Randy Waldrum said. "We've had a really good week of practice, but we've had good weeks of practice before. The focus has been there. We're pleased, but it is not enough to do it just in practice. We have to do it on thfl tield." 
Pittsburgh historically has finished at the bottom of the Mid-Atlantic Division. This year is no different as the Panthers are winless in tlrn division (0-4) and own an overall record of just 3-8. They have had some close contests with Notre Dame in recent years. The Irish only defeated the Panthers 1-0 the last time Pittsburgh visited Notre Dame during 'the 2000 season. Given the lrish's two upset losses last weekend Notre Dame is not treating any opponent lightly. 
"They came here two years ago and almost beat us. I don't think we'll come into this game worrying about records. We can't afford to take anyone lightly," Waldrum said. "Last weekend, Villanova and Georgetown beat us for the

Belles soar into tourney 
By CHRIS FEDERICO Sports Editor 
The Saint Mary's golf team proved its dominance in the MIAA during the regular sea­son, winning two of three MIAA Jamborees and the Baldwin-Wallace Yellow Jacket Invitational along the way. 
Now it's time for the Belles to make their mark in the MIAA Conference Tournament this weekend on the Zolner Golf Course at Tri­State University. 
The Belles have been on a roll in recent weeks of com­petition, winning their last three tournaments. Two weeks ago, Saint Mary's set the school n~cord for team strokes in a tournament at 
..,. 
338, and then shattered it the followed weekend, shooting a 325 to capture the MIAA Jamboree hosted by Hope College. 
Freshman Meg Mattia fin­ished in second one shot behind the medallist with a 
78. Three other Belles ­sophomores Julia Adams and Stefanie Simmerman and junior Llz Hanlon -finished in the top 10 to help Saint Mary's to the victory. 
"We've been playing very well this fall," Hanlon said. "Julia Adams has been play­ing very well for us, and Meg [Mattia] is definitely coming around, and she's really com­ing on right now. I think it's important that we're all play­ing at the right time." 
The Belles will have the advantage of being familiar with the Zolner Course, as the upperclassmen played it in competition in last spring. 
"We were able to play the course last spring, so that could be a big advantage for us," Hanlon said. 
The Belles have shown continued improvement in play through the season. In their last five tournaments, they have finished second twice and have three victo­ries. 
The victories and top fin ishes should provide some momentum heading into the conference tournament. 
"We're all playing for the same goal right now," Hanlon said. "That is to win the conference tournament."

FOOTBALL 
Holiday's fate will be game-time decision 
By ANDREW SOUKUP Sports Writer 
Carlyle Holiday says he's ready to play Saturday. But his coaches aren't quite convinced yet, saying they'd be willing to wait until just before kickoff Saturday before· deciding whether to start Holiday or backup Pat Dillingham. 
"We'll wait right up until the last moment," Irish head coach Tyrone Willingham said. "Carlyle has pro­gressed very well, and we'll make a decision on game day." 
Speaking to reporters for the first time this week, Holiday said his left shoulder is still a little tender but doesn't significanUy affcct his throwing. He practiced in shoulder pads every day this week, but hasn't done any full contact drills since injuring his shoulder against Michigan State two weeks ago and doesn't know if his non-throwing arm could sustain a hard hit. 
Perhaps the clearest sign about Holiday's health came in the inter­view room after practice. The Irish quarterback normally gestures with both hands when he talks, but rarely moved his injured arm Thursday afternoon. 
"I think that the coaches and the doctors should make the decision," said Holiday, who did not elaborate on the specific nature of his injury. "I always want to play, I'm a com­petitor and I want to be in there to support my team and help win ball­games, but I realize that's, not up to

'Walk-on' hopes to lose his tide 
Nobody else got a label in front of their name a couple weeks ago. 
Arnaz Battle wasn't called "former quarter­
back" 
when he dartPd 
yards 
for a 
touch­down against Mich­igan State two ,-.·eeks ago. Tyrone 
· Willingham wasn't called "f'ormi>r Stanford head coach." Kevin White wasn't called an athl1itic director formerly praying for a good season. Yet virtually every single article about the Michigan State game had "former walk-on" right before Pat Dillingham's name. Three Saturdays ago. Dillingham was a backup. Two Saturdays ago, he was a hero. And he can't shake the walk-on label, no matter how hard he tries·. His story is the stuff of legends, but only because he is a walk-on. Rudy played 27 seconds in garbage time and got a movie named after him. Dillingham quarterbacked the Irish during a 30 sec-

ond game-winning: touch­
down drive and got asked if he felt like Rudy. 
No disrespect toward Notre Dame's most famous walk-on, hut Dillingham ain't no Rudy. He's a poised, confident football playP-r who handles the media crunch just as well as -hf1 faced a Michigan State pass rush. 
At the beginning of the season, before the media crunch :mrrounded him. when he was thrilled to work as Carlyle Holiday's backup in practice, coach­es told Dillingham he would see some playing time against Maryland. At the time, Dillingham was just happy to get a chance to get in a game. 
"I hope l don't do any­thing to make the students mad," Dillingham said in an empty interview room. 
Heck, Dillingham would have been happy if stu­dents had known his name. The PA announcer at Giants Stadium didn't -he announced the back­up corncrback with a defensive back sidelirn~d with an arm injury. 
That's the life of a quar­terback who rose up the depth chart thanks to a war of attrition that knocked out two of the top three scholarship quarter­backs and cleared the way for the son of an orthope­dic surgeon to take snaps with Notre Dame's offense. 
That's the life of a quar­terback who had so much confidence in himself that didn't receive a single Division I-A scholarship and still walked onto Notre Dame's team think­ing he was a Division I cal­iber player. 
Even l\'otre Dame's media guide refers to Dillingliam as an unknown. 
All the "unknown" did was dump a. pass off' to Battle who raced in for the game-winning touchdown lwo weeks ago. 
And in an instant, the backup, not the receiver, becanrn a celebrity. 
Suddenly, people stoµped asking Dillingham a.bout his comrnction to Tyrone Willingham' s eldest daughter -the two went to the same high school and were casual friends -and began ask­ing him whether he could run the Irish offense. 
Willingham praises Dillingham as a bright quarterback, as someone who has a solid under­standing of Notre Dame's complicated offense. Veteran offensive linemen talk about how the team already rallies behind Dillingham even though they don't know which quarterback will start. 
If Holiday is unable to play, the Irish aren't exactly in horrible shape. In the four games Holiday has played this year, he's completed a meager 44 percent of his passes. By contrast, last season, when everyone lambasted the ineffective Notre Dame offense. lloliday completed a little more than half his passes. Even if Holiday starts, one hard hit could send Dillingham back into the game. 

l'iow, with Holiday's sta­tus in doubt, the weight of Notrn Dame's undefoated season is resting on the shoulders of a quarter­back who hadn't started a game since high school. Dillingham's fat.her, who works as an orthopedic surgeon for Stanford, couldn't have picked a betuir away game to work. 
But if f)i!Jingham gets into the game, Dad may not recognize the player his son has become. There won't. be any clipboard holding. There won't be any self-confidence issues. There won't be any wor­ries about whether Dillingham can run the Irish offense. 
Don't call Dillingham a walk-on. Call him a foot­ball player. Since he threw himself into the spotlight two weeks ago, that's what he has become.

The game they all circled 
Irish coach Tyrone Willingham takes on his former Stanford players 
By ANDREW SOUKUP 
Sports W ricer 
Normally. hell has a better chance of freezing over before Tyrone Willingham admits a football game is anything more than a football game. 
Yet tho lrish head coach shocked the world Tuesdav by saying Saturday's game will be a little more difficult for him to coach. 
Willingham knows every single player 
Willingham met Greem, who desperately needed a rac­quetball partner early in the morning. The two talked often, and when Green got the Stanford coaching job, he offered Willingham a spot on his staff as running backs coach. 
Three years later, Willingham followed Green again, this time to Minnf'sota tu coach the Vik.ings. And after Bill Walsh left Stanford, Cardinal athletic director Ted Leland called WiHingham and

Willingham and his assistants will be coach­ing many of the players they recruited and men­tored. In three of Notre Dame's first four games, Willingham's team has found a way to win. The last Irish coach to begin his career 4-0 was Ara Parseghian.  Holiday has been less than spectacular. but he has, nonetheless, led the Irish to a 4-0 record. If he can't play, Dillingham will have to be ready. Dillingham took the bulk of snaps in practic~ and led the Irish on a game-winning drive over Michigan State two week ago.  Notre Dame has nearly doubled its opponenl<; this season in rushing yardage per game. The offensive line has been opening up some solid holes for Grant and Powers-Neal. Both runners are averaging 4.3 yards per carry. Holiday always presents a threat to run out of the pocket.  Notre Dame only aver­ages 157 yards a game passing -less than its running output. Holiday has completed just 44.6 percent of his passes, while Dillingham has thrown only six passes all season. They have only two interceptions in 89 attempts, however.  

Teevens had some rough years in his last head coaching role at Tulane. He brought the Fun 'n' Gun that he learned under Steve Spurrier at Florida to Stanford along with eight new offensive coaches. His overall head coaching record is 51-7 8­2.  The freshman Kyle Matter has been more efficient in his three games, but Lewis is the starter. Lewis has thrown five interceptions and three touchdowns in two games, and has a 48.8 completion percentage ..  Stanford has held its opponents to under 100 rushings yards a game this season. Middle linebacker Jake Covault leads the team in tack­les with 16 through three games. The team has eight players with 10 or more tackles.  Last week Arizona State quarterback Andrew Walter threw for five touchdowns and 421 yards against the Cardinal defense in his first start. Stanford has allowed 286 passing yards per game to its opponents.

Setta has looked more and more human in recent weeks, missing five of 12 field goal attempts. Hildbold missed some punts two weeks ago with an opportunity to pin the Spartans deep. Duff, Battle and Walton are always dangerous returning kicks. 
Stanford kicker Michael Sgroi is 3-for-3 on field goal attempts, with two over 40 yards. Eric Johnson averages a solid 
40.2 yards per punt. Stanford averages only 
13.9 yards per kick return, but 12.5 yards on punts.

Even if Holiday is unable to play, the Irish offense will put points on the board against the Stanford team that allowed 65 points to Arfzona State last week. The defense needs to key in on the Cardinal rushing game, which leads the Pac-10 in rush yards per game. Look for tho Irish to easily beat Willingham's former team.

Defensive line puts squeeze on opponents 
By JOE HETTLER Asociate Spom Editor 
Darrell Campbell knew Notre Dame's defense was missing something last season. 
Now he knows what it was. 
"[Pressuring the quartcrbackJ is the difference between the defense of last year and the de_len~e of this )'.ear," \aITipbeli said. T.ast year 1t wasn t neces­sarily four down linemen trying to get pressure on the quarter­baek, we had multiple linemen, outside bar.kers, corners com­ing .up and blitzing from oppo­site sides. This year we went back to that 4-3 mentality, old­style, hit them in the face, get up the field and take care of our gaps and just playing NotrP Dame defense. That's been the No. 1 thing, getting back there and doing some damage to the quarterback." 
Getting to the quarterback with only a four-man rush allows the Irish defense to havc an extra man in the secondary or in the middle of the field, which puts less pressurn on the defensive backs and lineback­ers. 
Defensive lineman coach Greg Mattison believes the front four of Campbell, Cedric Hilliard, Kyle Budinscak and Ryan Roberts have successfully pres­sured opposing quarterbacks for several reasons. 
"We've got some speed finally on the edges to be able to rush the edges, but that's only good if you have a push up the middle," Mattison said. "That's what (Campbell] and [Hilliard) both have understood and now are starting to get a great push up there, and that's why we're get­ting pressure from the outside more." 
In order to stop the pass, Notre Dame's lineman must first stop the other team's run­ning game. 
"The first thing you always have to do is stop the run," Mattison said. "If we don't stop the run, then it'll be a long day beca.usfl they'll bfl able to throw or run on us. So we've got to be able to stop the run, then get them in a true passing situation. Then it's_ time for us to put it in our advantage, because now we know what they're doing, and we have to be able to beat somebody one-on-one." 
All four starting llirnmen have made key plays in Notre Dame's first four victories this season. As a unit against Maryland, thev combined for four tackles for· a loss, including a sack. Hilliard recorded two sacks, blocked a field goal and forced a fumble against Michigan, while Hoberts had two sacks and sh tackles versus Michigan State. The line has lrnlped make Notre Dame's defense rank sixth among Division I teams in rushing yards allowed, holding opponents to 76. 75 yards per game. The Irish are also ranked 14th in the country in total defense, yielding only 276.50 yards per game. 
Mattison still sees room for improvement despite the line's success 
"[The defensive linemen] have a lot of pride and they know that they haven't played close to

Johnson hopes to use size against Irish corners 
By CHRIS FEDERICO 
Sports Editor 
If you had to build the perfect wide receiver, what attributes would you give him? 
You'd probably give him speed to get past defensive backs, good hands to grab anything thrown in his direc­tion, jumping ability to go up for long balls, size to stay above the shorter defenders and strength to break off cornerbacks' checks at the line. 
You're probably thinking Notre Dame already covered this guy two weeks ago against Michigan State's Charles Rogers. 
Hopefully. the Irish defensive backs got some good experience against Rogers: because there will be more of the same Saturday against Stanford wide receiver Tevo Johnson. 
"It seems Like ~verv team has those receivers," Irish defensive coordinator Kent Baer said. "He's big, strong, I know the familv and I know the ath­lete. He's a tremendous football play­er. What makes him so good is his strength. And he's gong to be tough to handle. He's going to come in here and play his best football game." 
The 6-foot-7, 240-pound sophomore is Stanford's leading receiver with 16 catches for 245 vards and four touch­downs. · 
Rogers -who goes 6-foot-4 and 205 pounds -gave Notre Dame cor­nerbacks Shane Walton and Vontez Uuff troubles two weeks ago, grabbing seven receptions for 175 yards and two touchdowns over the shorter Irish cornerbacks. 
Johnson adds three inches and 35 pounds to Rogers' measurements. 
"l think if you look at the typical defensive back, they are under 6 feet and 200 pounds, but then you get guys that are my size and can run the same speed, it's so helpful," Johnson said. "If you want to make a tough pass it's very helpful. Football is all about mismatches, and that c-an be one of the keys in the game." 
But Johnson isn't just a tight end playing further down the line of scrimmage. He is also an accom­plished basketball player -he's a two-sport athlete at Stanford, playing for the Cardinal basketball team as well -and he can go up for jump balls like a center grabbing a rebound. 
"What I think Teyo brings that the other guys don't bring is a body that's probably unmatched," Irish head coach Tyrone Willingham said. "When you put a 245-pound body on a guy that's 200, you've got a difference­maker there, and he knows how to do that with his basketball experience of how to just leverage his body into position to make plays.... I think they do a great job of just putting him in position for jump balls just to have an opportunity to do that, because he does it so well." 
Duff and Walton !mid Rogers rela­tivel.ty quiet for three quarters two weeks ago, but when the Spartan wide receiver got single coverage, he caused trouble for the Irish. 
Johnson knows how Lalented the Irish defensive backs are, but he will be looking for that opportunity to use his height as an advantage and make the game-breaking play. 
"It's going to be physkal out on the perimeter," Johnson said. "[Duff and Walton] are both very good athletes. They can cover well and cover the deep ball well. We're just going to try to go out there and do what we do. If l can just be one-on-one· and physical with their defensive backs, I think it will be good for me."
