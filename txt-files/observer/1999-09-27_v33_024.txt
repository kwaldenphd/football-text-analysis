Robert H.aywoood, sympo­sium organizer and assistant professor of art history, gave a critique of art critic Sister Wendy Beckett and her approach toward modern art. Haywood pointed out that while the "spiritual nourish­ment" Beckett found in art such as that of Marc Rothko was important, her focus on art reflecting a Catholic stance excluded or trivialized the works of homosexual and feminist artists and their roles in defining modern art. 
'There is too much content [in these worksj that could motivate the viewer to politi­cal action or ecstasy as opposed to spirituality," he said.

MULTICULTURAL 
University dedicates 

new center 
By MAUREEN SMITHE

Friday marked the official opening of the new lntercultural Center on Lim second floor of LaFortune. 
Due to the 
combined efforts or the Office of Multicultural. Student Affairs (OMSAl and the Office of Intrnational 


s t u cl e n t Fitzgibbon Affairs, the Center will "provide a safe environment for all students from the time he or she arrives on campus till the time he or she leaves," OMSA director Iris Outlaw said. "This intercultural center is in the heart of the world. This center ... knows no national borders," said Maureen Fitzgibbon, director of International Student Affairs. The opening ceremony included a blessing and prayer service with Father Mark Poorman. Among the many attendants at the ceremony were multi­cultural alumni who returned to campus for the weekend. "Our minority alumni boards are here this weekend," said Mirella Riley, staff advisor to La Alianza. Patricia Geiger and Stephen Tsuchiyama, both Asian alum­ni from th.e Class of 1983, returned to campus and said they surprised by the growth of minority populations and pleased about the new center. Geiger recalled "seven or eight" Asians on campus when she was a student. "The studrrnt population has changd quite a bit, but it is much more diversified," said Tsuchiyama. "Isn't this llntercultural Center] wonderful'? It has· really brought us up to a major university. I wish we had ttys," said Geiger. The 24-hour space was made possible with funds from Student Affairs, contributions Geiger said "show that the Univerity is taking us serious­ly."

Free People Read Freely 
What do "Catcher in the Rye," ''The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn," "A Wrinkle in Time," "I Know VVhy tl1e Caged Bird Sings," "Lord ofilie Flies," ''Slaughterhouse Five," "One Hundred Years ofSolitude" and "Little Red Riding Hood" have in common'? 
They're all among the United States' 50 must-fre­quently banned books ofthe 1990s. 
Welcome to Banned Books Week 1999 -"Free People Read Freely." Sponsored by a wide variety ofgroups ­including ilie American Librarv Association. the American Booksellers A'isociatiou and the American Society of Journalists and Authors -Banned Book Week runs Sept. 25 through Oct. 2 and celebrates our right as Americans to read 'hithout censorship. 
It may seem silly in thls day and age to fight book bans. After all, nobody's burning books in the slreet. The Comstock Laws -which prohibit "obscene materials" in the U.S. mail and effective­ly banned such books as "The Canterbury Tales" and Boccaccio's "Decarneron" -are now unen­forced, although they remain, for the most part. on the books. Such Internet merchants as ama­zon.com and bn.com make it possible to acquire almost any book imaginable. 
Besides, those who attempt to ban books usually have the best of intentions -they want to protect others (usually children) from infonnation, lan­guage or ideas they consider inappropriate. 
But as John Stuart Mill. a far more-eloquent spokesman than I, said in "On Llbcrty": "Ifall mankind mun.is oue, were of one opinion, and only one person were of the contrary opinion, mankind would be no more justified in silencing that one person, than he, ifhe had the power, would be justified in silencing mankind .... If the opinion [of' the one man] is right, they are deprived ofthe opportunity of exchanging error for truth:' if wrong, they lose, what is almost as great a benefit, tl1e clearer perception and livelier in1pression of truth, produced by its collision with error." 
Censorship is the tool of the weak. the cowardly and the afraid. Those who hold the truth should have no fear ofseeing it challenged. Censorship does not protect a community but indeed makes it more vulnerable, unable to defend its beliefs, unwilling to expose itself to foreign ideas. Such a community becomes far more bigoted through its own actions than it ever could by reading ilie "n­word" in "Huck Finn." 
We do ourselves and our children no service by denying access to ideas we dislike. Refusing to allow young adults to read "I Know Why tl1e Caged Bird Sings" because it features descriptions of the author's sexual abuse as a child V1ill not make sexual abuse go away. It 'hill merely rob our teenagers oftools and viewpoin.ls they could use to face sexual abuse and keep them from entering a mature discussion in the home or school. 
"Leave ofGrass" was considered obscene. "Little Red Riding Hood" involves a minor transporting alcohol (this is the true reason it was banned in some California school districts in 1989). "Of Mice and Men" has offensive language. The Declaration oflndependence was treason_ Yet can we imagine our cultural landscape without these works? Should they be censored merely because some find them offensive? Banned because some dis­agree'? Kept out ofour hands because some find them immoral'?

Lecture: In·dian politics adapts to religious war 
By KRISTEN FITZPATRICK 
News Wrirer 
The Kellogg Institute hosted a conference this weekend cover­ing topics on the political and economic situations in India, including child labor and educa­tion, ethnicity and politics, and nationalism. 
Pratap Mehta of Harvard University reller,t.ed on tho e!Tect of diversity among the Indian people and their democracy in a discussion "The Civilizational 
Framework  of  Indian  
Democracy".  
Mehta  commented  on  the  

widespread accommodation of the differences in the political system. 
"There are conflicts among religious groups, and India tries 
to accommodate all groups through the sharing or powor among political groups in the countrv," Mehta said. 
Mehta also cornmonted on the fact that nationalism is an anom­aly in India because of the dilfer­e nces among the country's groups. 
"Politics is more about ritual than anything flise," he said. 
The conference, "India and the Politics of Developing Countries" was held in honor of political sci­entist Myron Weiner who wrote 13 books and edited countless others on Indian politics. He is credited with opening the under­standing of Indian politics is the United States and with being an expert on child labor in develop­ing lands. Participants took ideas from Weiner and expanded and critiqued his ideas.

Alcohol intake 01ay affect sleep patterns 
Associated Press 
NEW ORLEANS 
Too little sleep can slow you down as much as too many drinks. 
That's the conclusion of a Stanford University study of people with mild to' moderate sleep apnea: people whose breathing stops sevr,ral or even dozens ol' times an hour, interrupting their sleep with­out their knowlmlge. 
About 12 million Americans havA the problem but fewer than 2 million of them have been diagnosed, according tu the American Sleep Apnea Association's Web site. The undiagnosed figure may be as high as 25 million, according to Stanford's Sleep Disorders Clinic and Hesnarch Center. 
People known to have apnea did as poorly on a test of reaction time ·as pnople who were too drunk to drive a bus or truck in California, said Dr. Nrdson Powell of the Stanford center. 
On three of seven measure­ments, they did worse than people too drunk to drive at all in California and other states where the legal test is a blood alcohol content of .08 percent. 
Powell said he wanted to underscore the dangers of driving while sleepy, whether or not it's because of apnea. 
"How many times have you or anybody you've known been nodding off at the wheel, or said, 'Gee, I've got to roll the window down or turn the music louder"?" he said. "I'd bet every driver, at one time or another has dri­ven too tired. We know it's wrong but we still do it." 
Powell presented his study Sunday at the annual conven­tion American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and !\eek Surgery Foundation, Inc. 
"This is a wonderful study," said Dr. Regina Walker, an associate professor of oto­laryngology at Loyola University in Chicago. "lt is an extremely well-thought­out, well-controlled, prospec­tive study that is looking at something I think is of great

significance." 
The study looked at 80 vol­unteers and 113 people with apnea. The volunteers' aver­age age was 29; 56 pr,rcent were women. In contrast, 81 percent of' the apnea patients were men, and their aVfirage age was 47. 
However, statistical analy­sis ruled out age and gender as reasons for the difforence, Powell said. 
All of the people took a 10­minute test of' reaction spec,d, pushing a button to turn off a randomly set light. After four tests to get thr.ir baseline reaction time, the comparison group started drinking 80­proof' alcohol. 
They were tested three more times as thPy b1pt drinking. Their blood alcohol count averaged .05 pflrcent at the first retest, .08 1rnrcont at the second and .08:-3 at the third. 
It's illegal in California and several other states for any­one with a blood-alcohol con­tent of more than .04 percent to drive a bus or truck, and .08 is considered legal proof of driving drunk in 16 states. 
In addition to simple reac­tion times, analysts looked at six mathematical permuta­tions, such as the means of the 10 fastest and of the 1 O slowest times. 
The apnea patients, whose breath stopped about 29 times an hour while they were asleep, did worse on all seven measurements than the drinkers did on their first re­test, and worse on three of them than those who were legally drunk.

Hichard Mever, Assistant Professor or" Modern and Contemporary Art at University of Southern California, emphasized the contradictions of censoring art. 
"It is a complicated kind of circle that censorship sets around the objects it's trying to suppress." he said. 
Meyer cited the cancellation of the late Robert Mapplethrope's show at the Corcoran Gallery in Washington, D.C .. in 1989 as an example of how censoring art increases its circulation and public appeal. · 
Meyer discussed how sup­porters of Mappelthorpe's provocative work showed their disgust for the cancellation by projocting tlH\ images on the outsidf; of the gallery the night before the show was supposed to open. 
"This was a key episode in the political reclamation of Mapplethorpe's work," he said. 
Meyer also said that oppo­nents of l\1applethrope's work, like Jesse Helms and the Christian Coalition, con­tributed to its recirculation when they distributed repro­ductions or dr,tailed desc:rip­tions of those images to their followers.

EAST TIMOR 
Associated Press 
DILi 
l'ro-Indonesia militia­men should prrncef'ully roturn to East Timor and lwlp rnbuild tho province, Maj. (ien. Peter Cosgrove, the commander of' a peacekeeping force, said Sunday, as he prepared to 
take  control  of'  the  
province  ·  from  the  
Indonesian army.  

The transfer of authority in East Timor conrns with the earlinr than expected withdrawal of most or the 20,000 Indonesian troops in tlrn territory. Only about 1,500 lndonnsian soldiers 
w.ill be left by Tuesday. 
Cosgrove also called for an accelerated deployment or the second half of tho 7,500-strong force, amid persistent reports that the militias are massing out-
Quayle to abandon presidential race 
side the capital to attack the peacekeepers. 
"We would welcome militia to come along back into the political debate, to come back in unarmed," Cosgrove told Australian television 
The militias, backed by Indonesian troops, launched a terror cam­paign in the province after residents voted nearly 4­to-1 in favor of indepen­dence in a U.N.-sponsored referendum on Aug. 30. 
The Australian-led peacekeeping force arrived in East Timor on Sept. 21 to stop the vio­lence and maintain order unlil a U.N. force arrives in November to shepherd the territory through the transition to indepen­dence. 
Just across the border in the province of West Timor, militiamen bran­
dishing rifles and machetes vowed Sunday to fight for the province. 
An Indonesian reporter, who interviewed militia members in West Timor. told The Associated Press that they were awaiting 
the  order  retake  the  
province and  were  pre-.  
pared to attack.  

East Timorese remain fearful, despite the peace­keepers' presence. 
!'The militias are still out there. They are gone now but they might come back. Everyone is afraid," said Paulino Pinto, a Dili resi­dent who lost everything when a mob set fire to his home. 
The peacekeeping mis­sion faces other daunting challenges. The first reconnaissance flights have shown that the province of 800,000 is nearly deserted, with up to 
end, after consulting with his wife, Marilyn, and cam­
paign  manager  Kyle  
McSlarrow.  
The  braintrust deter­ 

mined that Quayle could not raise enough money to com­pete deep into the primary season, even if he fared well in New Hampshire, the first-in-the-nation primary state. 
Bush, the two-term Texas governor, has raised more than $50 million -five times that of his nearest challenger. Quayle has b1ien running a debt since early in the campaign. 
Rep. John Kasich of Ohio, former Tennessee Gov.

Lamar /\lexander and Sen. Bob Smith of New llampshire dropped out of the GOP primary contest earlier this year. 
Kasich endorsed Bush. Alexander, like Quayle, -cited Bush's fund-raising prowess as a rnason for leaving. Smith is consider­ing a third-party bid. 
The former vice president is not expoctnd to cnd9rse a candidacy Monday. 
Quayle's announcement comes as the remaining campaigns prepare to file their October finance state­ments that will disclose how well their fund-raising operations are dt>ing.

WASIIINGTON 
Former Vice President Dan Quaylfl has decided to drop out of the Hepublican presiden­tial race. a f t e r deter­mining 
1 that lw c a n · l compete w i t h G e o r g e Quayle 
Bush's fund-raising juggernaut, The Associated Press l1mrnod Sunday. 
Quayle will announce his intentions al a news confer­ence Monday in Phoenix, Ariz., said asenior cam­paign official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
llis departure winnows the GOP field to eight major Hepublican candidates, and will increase speculation about the finance and politi­cal health of the remaining contenders. 
Conservative commenta­tor Pat Buchanan is on the brink of bolting the GOP to seek the Reform Party nom­ination. 
The Quayle official said the former vice president decided to quit this week­

75 percent of its buildings and homes demolished. 
"If we don't manage to get food and medical sup­plies to those in the hills and, security permitting, enable them to move back to the towns by the time the rainy season comes in a few weeks, we could be in even deeper trouble," Hoss Mountain, the U.N. humanitarian coordinator for East Timor, said on his return from one flight. 
Security concerns have hampered road convoys, forcing aid workers to use air drops that officials admit are hit-and-miss. 
A UNICEF plane left Sunday carrying baby food and tents to refugees in West Timor, but the Indonesian military blocked foreign aid work­ers from ensuring the sup­plies reach their destina­tion.

Contrary to the opinions of too many people on this campus, the most impor­tant issue at Notre Da.mc is not the cur­rent record of our football team, or the job status of its head coach. I love lhe football team as much as anyone, but we have to think big picture. (That

Questionable
than the 
Freedoms
Linebacker.) 
Charles Hice 's column on Friday mentioned something that could affect not just C.oach Davie or the football team, but every person involved with this university and. indeed, on the entire planet. 
Rice criticized the University for what he feels is a 20-year trend of sacrificing its moral fiber for secular prestige. He used the example of many secularly prestigious institutions of higher learn­ing offering courses on animal rights. Now, "animal rights" sounds like a harmless issue. /\Iler all, who could possibly be against animals? But the sort of "animal rights" Hice articulates about is pure lunacy. 
Rice discusses a statement from 
Ingrid Newkirk of People for the Ethical 
Treatment of Animals that asserts that 
Americans eating chicken is somehow a 
larger atrocity than the wholesale 
slaughter of the Holocaust: "Six million 
people died in concentration camps, 
but six billion broiler chickens will die 
this year in slaughterhouses." PETA 
also plans to picket McDonald's begin­
ning Oct. 16. Among their complaints 
are that chickens raised for food at 
Mickey D's should have better trans­
portation because "every year, millions 
suffer broken bones and millions more die from the heat or cold." Heaven for­bid chickens should suffer or die before thev're killed and bP-come chicken salad. 
Now, let me be logical. WE'RE TALK­ING ABOUT CIIICKENS! Rven if there arc six billion chickens, they're still chickens! When the chickens complain, J'II listen. It could be entirely possible that the cure for AIDS or cancer died in a gas chamber at Auschwitz or one of the other llolocaust hells. The most six billion chickens could ever account for is about 60 billion Chicken Mc1\Juggets. Anyone who could possibly equate the two acts has a severe case of mixed-up priorities. 
Or worse. 
Rice also details the insane philoso­phy of Peter Singer, who is now a chair of bioethics at Princeton. In Singer's twisted world, apes, bears, cats, possi­bly chickens, chimps, dogs, dolphins, pigs, seals and whales arc all on a level with humans because they are rational and sentient br,ings. Does anyone else see a fundamental dichotomy here'? 
If not, lr,t's use a small sample: My dog and myself. In the last two weeks, I have studied the philosophies of Rene Descartes, David Hume and Sir Francis Bacon. Over that same period of time, my dog tried to bite the mailman. Recently, I have tried to control my weight by eating and drinking healthy foods. My dog likes to eat newspapers and drink out of the toilet bowl. I READ and WRITE. \1y dog poops on the car­pet. lntcllcctual winner: me. The mnre fact that I can determine it proves it. 
Bui Singer's not through yet. Those species listed are not only on a level with humans, but newborn and unborn babies are not. Perhaps Singer's actual­ly on to something here. If I get home and discover that my dog left a little present on the 11oor again and I decide that the proper punishment is sticking scissors in his neck, opening them, stuffing the business end of a Shop-Vac in the space I've crnated, and then sucking his brains out, it's called cruel­ty, and I'll spend the next few years of' my life avoiding a different kind of' ani­mal in an orange jumpsuit. But if' I arranged to do the same thing to an unborn baby, it's called a woman's right to choose, and I'll spend $300. 
There's a reason why I bring all of' this up. lngrid I\ewkirk, PETA, and Singer, whether they intend to or not, have delegated some humans to sec­ond-class citizens. The rest or us are not far behind. In fact, Newkirk already thinks so by stating that the deaths of six billion chickens outweigh the dnaths of six million humans. 
Charles Rice uses examples such as these to illustrate the wrong path for Notre Dame to take towards prestige in the academic community. I think ho has it backwards. 
We need to think big picture. What path are we as humanity taking when people who believe that "killing, say, a chimpanzee, is worse than the killing of a gravely defective human who is not a person"? That's something to think about while you eat a sausag!1 and boo Bob Davie on Saturday. 
Mike Marchand is a junior ojj:cam­pus English major who never poops on the carpet ... well. except for that one time. His column appears euery other Monday and his e-mail address is Marchand.3@nd.edu. 
The views expressed in this column are those of the author and not ,wces­sarily those ofThe Observer.

ND needs to hear silent screams of eating disorders 
Tlwy alfocl IJC'twnm1 liv<' and IO million fomalcs and 01rn mil­lion mal1is. They ravagn tlw livPs of 7 1wrcnnl of America's unc!Prgrnduatn population. Tim mortality ratn of one of these dnmons.is tH1ar 20 pnrcent, tho highest of any menial disorder. And tlw University of Our Lady is shutting its ()al"S to the silent screams emanating from the victims' mouths. 
These tormentors am eating disordnrs and tlrny prey on col­Inge studnnls. Tlrn college ,~lmosph1m1 is highly c<inducive to liwsn illnnssns. Stud,mts at this point in their livns struggle with gaining acccptance from p111H"s, living away from home, and trying to lmLp over tlrn chasm b1itwmm adolescence and adulthood. Most victims of eating disorders are in the age range of' 14-25 and are typically achkv<>mtn t-orit1ntated, afllu­cnt, typri-/\ personalities. llmwstly. do you know anyone under thn llimw who lits that desrription·,

percPnt of the student body, 
hav<i nowhere to turn. As men­
tioned ahove, anorexia has the 
highest mortality rate among 
mnntal disorders; how many students have died from poor timn management? 
Maybe the University is not entirely to blame for the insuffi­cient resources for those suffer­ing with eating disorders. Victims often do not realize the seriousness of their altered eat­ing habits or are not able to admit their problem. Our soci­ety has a faulty perception of eating disorders. Anorexics are not nrnrdy I.he skinny girls who nat a piece of lettuce for dinner. Bulimia is not about vomiting and purging. They have nothing to do with food. They arc about guilt, insecurity, fear and becoming reconciled with the past and hopeful about the futurn. They have to do with getting up every morning and looking into the mirror and ulti­mately accepting what is star­ing back at you. 
The frightening rea-lity about eating disorders is that they arc rooted in the brain and then take their toll on the body. Thpy have all the troubling psy­dwlngind elements of a mental disordor. plus the detrimental physical offects of other illness­os. 
Curing these discasns must lrngin with tho victims admitting the problem, and this can only be accomplished when they are familiar with the disordm·. Hncovery can not happen alone. By providing educational infor­mation and stronger, support­ivn programs, the University can lrnlp students to gain back thnir bodies, minds and lives. 
But bol'orn Lhis can happen, th11 victims must regain their voices.

Administration's logic on ad ban inconsistent 
LPt me see ii' I havn this straight ... 
The Observer may not accept ads from Gay and Lesbian Alumni of ND/SMC bf1causll GAL/\ is an organization that works against the teachings of the Catholic Church. The adminis­tration has also said that it feels that GALA is associat­

your l~fe. 
would also imply comlon­ing rn.ND/SMC. 
rrankly. the administration is a little para­noid about the pcrnrnating influence of GLND/SMC. Thrne years ago, it denied College Democrats a permit to demonstrate on the grounds that it was fronting for GLND/SMC. Now GALA, an entirely separate organization, is be.ing banned from University publications on th<> grounds that it is a front for GLND/SMC. It is certainly an inconsistent argument to state that they are the same organization because many current and former members of GLND/SMC are also members of GALA. 
Many members of the Lyons Hall Volleyball Team are also members of the Lyons Hall Football Team, and they are definitnly different organizations. It is further inconsistent to state that they are the same because they have the 
same general goals 
-to support gay people. The volley­ball team and my football team both exist to give us a chance to run around and play sports, but again, this does not make them the same thing. The University is making ridiculous and · unsubstantiated assumptions in its advertising ban of GALA. 
GALA as a group supports the gay and lesbian alumni of Notre Dame. I don't think there are too many Notre Dame graduates who are in the dark as to the Catholic and University teachings on homo­sexuality. The Church does allow for some spirit of inclusion; it doesn't have any real prob­lem with celibate, God-fearing gay people. GALA knows what it has to work with and it knows what kinds of bones the Univel'sity is going to throw at it. GALA and its offi­cers will point out in a heartbeat that their organization has newer said any­thing contrary to 
.___
Catholic doctrine. 
Tho advertising ban is jumping the gun; it would make just as much sense to ban a restaurant from campus media advertising on the grounds that it may one day turn out to be fronting a brothel. 
If we're going to ban someone from advertis­ing on campus because they espouse beliefs contrary to or in conflict with those of the Catholic Church, we'rn going to see some big changes in the kinds of ads The Observer runs. 
Take the full-page Elton John ads that have been running recently. Talk about someone who goes against the teachings of the Catholic Church! Elton could be an honorary member of take too much control or the Universitv. In a nut­shell. he is not power­

Church infringes on their educational free­dom they pitch a fit. 
Furthermore, the administration is against the Church imposing a broad doctrine from above bent on control­ling the University but levies the same kind of doctrine on The Observer. So not only are they being inconsis­tent in their heeding of Catholic teachings, they are also being entirely hypocritical. 
Thus, if the University must' condemn GAi.A's advertising, it cannot do so without destroying itself logically and putting itself in an extremely precarious

Ads from the Notre Danw United Muslim Association, a group whose members sham a common bond of non-Christianity and non­Catholicism, are cheerfnlly permitted. The College Republicans, who support the death penalty in a manner inconsistent. with tlrn respect-for-life teachings of the Church, are allowed to advertise. 
Ditto for College Democrats and their less­than-Catholic support ol" abortion issues. 
The omcers of the University arc being inconsistent in other re~pects. They arc saying that in the case of the sexual orientation non­discrimination clause. they must do as the Church directs. /\nd the Church is clear that engaging in homosexual activity is wrong. 
The Spirit of Inclusion says, "The rich her­itage of the Catholic faith informs and-trans­forms our search for truth." In other words, the administration is claiming to be a power­less, non-autonomous group in the face of the teachings or the Catholic Church. 
Nonsense!

Gender relations make for fruitful discussions a Scene attempts to unearth the mysteries of 



By ELLEN ANDERSON 
Scmc \X'mer 
Three wise men once claimed to want girls ­yeah. all they really wanted was girls. "Girls: To do the dishes, to clean up my room, to do the laundrv and in the bathroom ... Girls." Perhaps these men, coJIActively known as the Beastie Boys, arn not to bP considered the tell-all experts on the suqject of women. but their spunky 1987 hit "Girls" does leave worn.en wondering about one thing: What is it that guys are all about'? 
· The c·onrept of the gender gap is in no way a recent revelation; the differences between the sexes have existed and always will. There seems to have been a resurgence of hard-core machis­mo in the past few years, however, and its preva­lence in the mainstream is overwhelming. Evidence of an overtly misogynistic mentality surrounds women in all forms. perhaps most­blatantly in the current musical industry. 
For all it's worth, there is a great deal of tal­
ented male artists currently enjoying success in 
our sorietv. Artists like Korn, Limp Bizkit and 
Gravity Kills are unquestionably some of' the 
most skilled performers in their trade, yet they 
endorse a definitively "machista" attitude. In the 
introduction to "All in the Family," lead Korn 
singer Jonathan Davis and Fred Durst of Bizkit 
collectively trade proclamations such as, "My 
d*** is bigger than yours." and "You look like 
one of those little dancers in a Hanson video, 
f"'** ..* ho." 
Bizkit's latest effort, the wildly popular 
"Significant Other," introduces us to the conrept 
of gratuitously "doing it all for the nookie." 
While on tour in support of their 
''Perversion" album, Jeff Scheel of Gravity 
Kills introduced his song "Guilty" with 
the riveting declaration, "Welcome to 
the Gravity Kills Whorehouse. Are 
you sick f'"*"* ready to put out?" 
Gone are the days of out-and-out 
censorship. which previously 
prevented lyrics such as these 
from being publicly present­
ed. 
Furthermore, the musical scene is in no way the only one being shaken up by the new societal norms. I well remember a time when a kinder, gentler World Wrestling Federation existed; when the focus of the troupe concentrated mdre on the outrageous antics of the lovable Hulkster and the flam­boyant Macho Man, H.ai1dy Savage. The First Lady of Wrestling, l\Iiss Elizabeth. dressed mod­estly, yet elegantly, and was adored by men and admired bv women. 
Today,· however, the WWF and its prime competi­tion, the World Championship Wrestling, push the statutes of good taste. The \VWF boasts a scantilv-clad hoartbrcakcr known as Sable, as well as her darker counterpart. the overly-muscular Chvna. The crowd is pumped up by their hero. Road Dogg, a particularly unsavory character who invites the pre­domina~tly-drunkcn audience to joi11 him in prodaiming his raunchy motto, "Suck it!" The depths to which this industry has sunk are appalling, but they seem to be working. Televised professional v\Testling is seeing its highest ratings ever. capitalizing on the exploitation of women and, apparently, giving guys what they want. 
Granted, television does not always offer a clear reflection of reality. But if the sport of pro wrnstling has tapped into the contemporary mainstream, what docs that say about the men of the new millennium'! Can the mentality or males really be rondensed into a love of half-dressed women, beer and blood? 
Clearly, the only way through which an accu­rato pPrspoctive ol' males could leasibly be com­piled was for a few of my girlfriends and I to "become male" lor a while. This task included doing things that boys typically enjoy: scoping out the bar scene, hanging out in the dorms and kicking root 011 the couch with a little televised enll~rtainment providod by the mogul of all things trashy. the FX station. 
After a quick survey of the Thursday-night bar­life. a co-collaborator and I decided that down­town would probably show the most promise for the night and for our mission. Clearly, we made the right choice, as we entered a popular bar to find it swarming with boys of all types, ranging from studenl'i to locals. Placing oursPlves square­ly in the middlr) of the dance lloor, we surveyed the activity around us and l'ound three~ distinct prototypes: a) singln sex groups dancing amongst themselves; bl couples focused entirely on earh other; and c) outsiders trying to infiltrate into larger groups -w~nnrally into those in group 
"a." 
Being in group "a" ourselves, we were con­t fl Il t

RYDER Cup 
Leonard's putt completes incredible comeback 
Associated Press 
BROOKLINE, Mass. 
All Ben Crenshaw asked his Ryder Cup team to do was believe. and the Americans responded with a charge that was simply unbelievable. 
With a birdie pult that was as long as Americn's chances, Justin Leonard took dead aim and finished off the greatest comeback in Rvder Cup history, assuring the 17-inch gold chal­ice a home on U.S. soil for the first time since 1993. 
Victory came on the 17th green, across the street from where rrancis Ouimet lived when he won the 1913 U.S. Open and made golf popular in the United States. This triumph made hAroes out of a U.S. team that pushed aside the dispute over money and won something that proved to he far more valuable. 
"I never stopped believing," a choked-up Crenshaw said after a 14 1/2-13 1/2 victory. ''I'm stunned. This is so indescrib­able." 
Leonard's 45-foot birdie putt unleashed a torrent of emotion that had been building throughout an electric day at The Country Club, where fans cheered every American victory and every missed putt by the Europeans. 
Although one match was still on the course, the putt, fol­lowed by Jose Maria Olazabal's miss, guaranteed the Americans 14 1/2 points, the amount they needed to win, but an amount few believed they would get. 
'This was history being made today, and we all wanted to be a part of that," said Hal Sutton, the rock-solid star of the U.S. team who contributed 3 1/2 points. "This is the greatest moment in golf right now." 
Despite a 10-6 deficit going into the final round, despite the fact no team has ever come back from more than two points on the last day, Crenshaw refused to give in. 
'Tm a big believer in fate," he warned Saturday night, wagging his finger with a wink. 
Believe it1 
Those were fitting words from Crenshaw, who won the 1995 Masters after the death of his longtime teacher Harvey Penick. At the time, he said he felt it was Penick's spirit guid­ing him along. 
In much the same way, Crenshaw willed his team to victory on this course, which has a long history of U.S. victo­ries. 
"It's all because of Ben Crenshaw," Davis Love Ill said. "He fired us up, made us believe we could do it." 
The Ameri.cans overwhelmed Europe in the first six matches, closing all of lhem out before the 17th hole. Even David Duval, who refern~d to the Hyder Cup as an exhibition, sho..,rnd how much it meant by rf>peatedly shaking his lists and cupping his hand to his ear, asking the gallery !"or even mon~ noise -maybe too much noise. 
The Europeans round it excessive, and took exception to the player celebration af'ter Leonard's putt because Olazabal still had a 2:i-foot birdie putt to tie the match and keep alive Europe's fading hop<'s. 
"It's about the most disgust­ing thing I've ever seen," said assistant captain Sam 
Torrance. "This is not sour grapes. The whole American team, and spectators ran right across the green over Olly's line. He still has a putt to tie the hole. We could still take the Hyder Cup home. It was dis­gusting." 
No comeback, however, was as symbolic as Leonard's. He had.never won a Ryder Cup match, and looked as if he had no chance against Olazabal when he trailed by four holes with sevon to play. 
Leonard won the next four holes to square the match. the last one a ~5-footer on the 15th that gave the Americans anoth­er chance when Mark ()'Meara faltered. 
The cup was clinched on No. 17 when Leonard's 45-l"oot birdie putt banged into the back of the cup and dropped. 
Olazabal birdied the 18th to halve the match, but by then the American celebration was well under way. Leonard led the U.S. team in spraying champagnf' around the 18th green where the Stars and Stripes was waving. 
The Americans wound up winning 8 1/2 points out of 12 singles matches, its biggest margin since 1979. The Americans won by a rout that vear but this was different. They· needed every point, every putt. 
Europe, which looked so d-0minant in building what appeared to be an insurmount­able lead, ran out of gas. Jesper Parnevik and Sergio Garcia, 3­0-1 while paired the first two days, were beaten back by David Duval and Jim Furvk. 
It was the first time ail week the 19-year-old Spaniard, the youngest player in Ryder Cup history, couldn't muster a smile. 
Crenshaw hammered home his belief in fate during an emotional team meeting Saturday night in which every player spoke passionately ­even Duval. 
"J told them to go out and kill 'em." Duval said. He did his part, winning six of the first eight holes against Parnevik in a 5 and 4 victory. 
Sutton, rock-solid all week. was holding back tears after he crushed Darren Clarke. 
"My only comments last night were if we do down, let's go down with all our oars in the water," Sutton said. 
They pulled with all their might, tugging against history in waters thickened by pres­sure unlike any other in golf, perhaps in all of sport. 
It was the seventh consecu­tive Ryder Cup that was decid­ed by no more tha.n two points, dating to thn 1985 matches that signaled the switch over to European dominance. 
So close was this TTydor Cup that no team match ended before the 17th hole. the first time that has happened si11c(1 1969. SinglP-s. as usual. was anothP-r matter. 
Tlin Americans ha.vi> won tlw singles m11tches a.II but f"ivP times in Ryder Cup history. and all but twice since 1957. 
The roars that rorkcd Tlw Country Club, from Sutton's first birdie on the second holP of the Sficond matrh to Leonard's clinching birdie putt in the afternoon, carried the Americans to their stunning charge. 
"I 1rnver knew how good it feels to win the Hyder Cup," Tiger Woods said. 
The atmosphere was electric. 
The gallery was a dozen deep around tees and green, not an inch of space along any fairway under brilliant blue conditions. 
All of a sudden, the Americans lookfld as though they had nothing to lose. Muscles tightened on every European face, tho players cel­ebrating with charged-up emo­tion instead of the childlike joy they exuded the first two days. 
"An amazing experience," Tom Lehman said. 
Duval, Sutton, Lehman. Love, Woods and Phil Mickelson led a ferocious charge that made Crenshaw's lineup look like a brilliant move. Ile sent out his best players in lhe first six matches, hopeful they all would get out of the blocks quickly and set up that chain reaction of momentum he had been des­perately searching for all week. 
Did it ever work. 
Lehman. who has never lost a singles match in the Ryder Cup, never missed a green in his 3 and 2 victory over Lee Westwood. 
Sutton never blinkfld when Darren Clarke chipped in for birdie on the first hole. He looked over at his wife and winked, hit to 20 feet on No. 2 and sank the birdie putt, the first of three straight holes he won in a 4 and 2 victory. 
Jarmo Sandelin, Jean Van de Velde and Andrew Coltart made their Hyder Cup debut under the most intense pres­sure. European captain Mark James did a nice job hiding Europe's weakness for two days. but they failed to survive their baptism by fire. 
Mickelson, Love and Woods set them down in order without so much as working up a sweat. Only Woods had some­thing that resembled a strug-gle. He didn't take a lead until question. Montgomerie, the seventh hole, but buried Olazabal and British Open Coltart with a 40-foot chip-in champion Paul Lawrie had con­on the next hole. trol of their matches, and

By KATIE McVOY Sports Writer 
The Saint Mary's volleyball 
team improved its conference 
record to 3-0, defeating Alma 
College 3-1 and Adrian College 
3-0 during u doubleheader on 
Saturday. 
The Belles began the after­
noon by facing the Scots. Alma 
came into th11 game with a non­
league record of 5-5. S1,1.int 
Mary's took the first two games. 
The Belles kept the energy . high and the motivation rolling. 
"We talked well," said senior 
Agnes Bill. "We picked each 
other up and were very encour­
aging and motivational.·· 
"I think we played very well," 
junior Victoira Butcko said. 
"When we have the sPrve. we're 
really strong." 
The Belles Jost strength in the 
third game, falling to the Scots 
15-1. 
"We boat ourselves during the 
third game," head coach Randa 
Shields said. "rt wasn't anything 
the other team did." 
However, the home team 
came back to win the t'ounh 
game. 15-7. 
One of the keys to Saint 
Mary's winning games was' 
their defense. As a team, the 
Belles had 47 digs. 
"They're scrappy," Alma head 
coach Penny Allen-Cook said. 
Want to 
"They played defense very well. They hit Vfiry nicely down the line, which hurt us a lot. I think that's what reallv stood out." 
Senior Jayne ·ozboH led tlrn Belles in victory. During the match against Alma she had five kills, one double block and two solo blocks. 
"Javne came out and took the leade;·ship ·role," Shields said. The entire team contributed to the victory. 
Bill had 19 digs for the ganrn and 17 kills. Sophomore Suzanne Martin continued as the Belles setter and one of their hest servers with 37 assists and three aces. 
Victoria Butcko and Angie Mnyer backed up the solid Belles' defense with 15 and 13 digs, respectively. Mary Rodovirh had two aces for the game. 
"We won because everyone gave what we needed to win," Shields said. 
Following the first victory. Saint Mary's shifted focus to its second match. Adrian College,_ another MIAA team. was an important game for the Belles. Not only was it a conference game, but it would show how. well the Belles could keep their focus and concentration. 
Shields refused to be content with their first win, and imme­diately looked to the second game and a victory there. 
"This next game is an impor­tant one," Shields said. "We'll see if we can keep focus and play consistently even though we're tirrd." 
The team led off its first game against Adrian College 18-6) with six unanswered points. Thev went on to win the first gam"e 15-11, then took the sec­ond game 15-7. 
During tho third game, Saint Mary's used its 9-1 advantage to give their starters a rest. The _substitutions performed .. superbly, with the homo team eventually winning l 5-13. 
Hoth teams were evenly 
· matched. They played long vol­leys and had to work very hard to score points, but it was the Belles' defense that stood out a.nd ulimtately led to the victory. "They played very good defense and hit out of the back row very well," Adrian head coach Mike Watkins said. Meyer led the defense with help from Butcko. Meyer had 13 digs for the game. Butcko had eight digs tor the game, two of' which cam!~ at crucial moments. In the second game, Butcko's dig prevented a side out which allows the Belles to win the game on the next serve. Nihill led with 16 kills, Bill had 15 and Ozbolt had 11. Martin had 58 assists for the game.

Bills 26, Eagles 10 
Looking to smooth their sput0 tering offense and plug the gap­ing holes in their defense, the winless Philadelphia Eagles accomplished neither in a loss to the Buffalo Bills. 
Steve Christie kicked four first-half field goals, Doug Flutie threw a 15-yard touchdown pass to Jay Riemersma and Antowain Smith capped the scoring with a 4-yard run late in the third quarter for the Bills, who had 377 yards to 169 for Philadelphia and posted their first shutout since 1992. 
Pederson, playing with a bruised throwing shoulder, completed 14 of 26 passes for 137 yards wilh no interceptions. But two sacks resulted in lost fumbles. Pederson was replaced by Donovan McNabb with 11 :43 to play. He also had limited suc­cess (6-of-11, 34 yards). 
Chiefs 31, Lions 21 
Anyone from the Detroit Lions trying to talk Barry Sanders out of retirement should hide this game film from him. 
Detroit's patchwork offensive line spent much of the day get­ting whipped by Kansas City's defense as the Chiefs seized a 24-7 lead en route to a victory that kept the Lions from their first 3-0 start since 1980. 
The Lions (2-l) appeared to miss their superstar running back, who unexpectedly retired at the beginning of training camp, for the first time. 
In their first six possessions. the Lions were sacked three times, had a pass batted down, were penalized twice and punt­ed five times. The Detroit offense onlv seemed to come to life on a f1~w big plays that led to their lhree TDs, including one with only 2:11 to play. 
Elvis Grbac threw two touch­down passes as the Chiefs (2-1 ), who were down to lheir third­team halfback throughout the second half, won their second in a row and got TDs from four different players. 
Bucs 13, Broncos 10 
Tampa Bay's defense lived up to its ranking as the stingiest in tlrn NFL, prPying on Brian Griese's inexperience in the closing minutes to hold off the winless defending Super Bowl champions for a victory over the Denver Broncos. 
The Bucs defense once again saved the day for an offense that's had problems scoring. 
Denver became the first defending Super Bowl champi­Qn to begin a season with three straight losses in a non-strike year. The New York Giants started 0-5 in 1987 following a Super Bowl championship sea­son, but three of those losses were with replacement players. 
But no reigning champs have ever dug themselves out of a deeper hole to successfully defend their title. 
Davis failed to gain 100 yards for the third straight game. picking up 53 on 19 carries. and Griese failed to lead the Broncos to a first down on two possessions in the final 4:08. 
The Bucs (2-1) intercepted Elway's successor once. setting up one of Martin Gramatica's two field goals, and the Denver quarterback was sacked twice on the last two drives. 
Panthers 23, Vikings 20 
Favre led the Green Bay Packers to another thrilling comeback win, hitting Corey Bradford with a 23-yard touch­down pass with 12 seconds left and giving the Packers a victory over the Minnesota Vikings. 
Bradford's catch capped a 77­yard, 104-second drive led by Favre. who beat the Oakland Raiders in Week 1 with a simi­lar last-ditch march. It was Favre's 12th fourth-quarter comeback and the 15th game­winning drive of his career. 
Favre's final pass came on a. fourt!J-and-J play, and Green Bay had no timeouts remaining. Favre said he didn't call a play but simply took the snap and threw toward Bradford, who bumped Jimmy Hitchcock at the line of scrimmage and ran on a. full sprint toward the end zone. 
Raiders 24, Bears 17 
An underachiever in New York and a reject in Miami, Tyrone Wheatley fits quite nice ly on ·an Oakland Raiders team that takes pride in its history of resurrecting castoffs. 
Wheatley scored on an 8-yard run with 6:45 remaining and tho Raiders overcame five lost fumblfis to defeat the penalty­ridden Chicago Hears.

The Belles' cross-country team ran to eighth place Saturday in their first all-league meet. 
Calvin College, last season's national champions, won the MIAA Jamboree, with Hope College and Albion College fol­lowing in second and third place. 
The meet provided Saint Mary's with its first look at the entire league. 
"This was our first chance to run against other MIM teams. so now we know where we stand in the conference," junior Genevieve Yavello said. 
Yavello finished 52nd in the meet with a time of 21 :03. This was one place behind Melissa

Irish place 12th in Fossum Invite 
Special to The Observer 
The Notre Dame women's golf team concluded play Sunday at the annual Michigan State Mary Fossum Invitational, slipping from eighth to a 12th-place finish· ing following final-round action at the par-72, 5, 780­yard Forest Akers West Golf Course. 
Notre Dame stood in a three-Miller. Saint Mary's highest fin­isher who had a time of 21:05. 
The Belles went into Saturday's race without two of their top runners, senior Melissa Goss and sophomore Bridget Nugent. 
Goss has been suffering from shin-splints all season and was unable to run. 
Miller said that although the Belles' final place in the meet ·was disappointing, their individ­
ual times are improving. 
"Everybody's personal goals 
have bc,en met," she said. "It just 
looked like all the other teams 
have improved a lot too." 
Winning the race was Jenny Ernst from Hope College. She ilnished with a time of 18:25. 
Calvin College's runners took 
second thruough sixth places to 
clincq their victory. The last 
way tie for eighth after Saturday's opening round 
(321) and completed the sus­pended second round on Sunday morning with a dissa­pointing total of 3.33 in the play-six, count-four format. The Irish then closed with a 325 in Sunday's third and [foal round for a 979 tournam1rnt total, just four strokes behind Illinois in the 18-team event. 
Irish junior Shane Smith cooled off after an opening 
place finisher crossed the finish line within 12 seconds of Erinn 
Boot, their highest finisher. 
As has been common this sea­son, Saint Mary's runners fin­ished very close to one another as well. The final three runners scoring for the Belles, Krista Hildebrand, Catherine Ward, and Megan Tenney, finished 64th, 77th and 80th, respective­ly. 
The Bf'lles do not face league teams until the championships at the end of the season. Until then, they hope to improve their times overall and think this will make a big difference. 
"Basically, one runner would have mad a big difference [Saturday]," Miller said. "We're right there. Basically, we're just going to try to improve our times."

Notre Dame sophomore Kristin McMurtrie again played three consistent rounds, tying for 47th with a 244 total (82-80-82). Juniors Danielle Villarosa (84-82-85) and Mary Klein each finished at 251, with Klein bouncing back from a pair of 87s to close with a 77.

In Sunday's matchup, the Gaels of Saint Mary's capital­ized on a home-field advan· tage and upended the Irish 2-0. 
Coming away with only their second victory in nine games, the Gaels scored twice late in the second half for the win. 
Despite outshooting the Gaels 13-7, the Irish failed to capitalize on any opportuni­ties.

WOMEN'S SOCCER 
Irish pick up two conference wins over weekend 

By MIKE CONNOLLY Associate Spores Editor 
The Notre Dame women's soccer team left New Jersey on Sunday with a 6-2 record and its third Big East wins of the season. 
The Irish trip to tho Garden State yielded a 4-2 win over Seton Hall on Friday and a 4-0 shut out of' Rutgers on Sunday. 
The Irish got goals from four dif­forcnt play{'rs in the victory over the Pirates. Senior All-American Jen Grubb opened the scoring for Notrn Dame in the 14th minute. After junior All-Americau Anne Makinen was fouled bv the Pirates just outside the box, Grubb lined up for a free kick. 
The captain fired the ball into the net from 22 yards out for her sec­ond goal of the season. Grubb's previous goal had also come off a free kick. 
The Irish struck again the in 19th minute. Jr,nny Streiffer picked up her first point of the weekend when she dribbled through the Pirate midfield and dropped a pass to senior forward Jenny Heft. 
Heft collected the pass and fired the ball into the lower right corner of the net for her third goal of the year to give the Irish a 2-0 lead. 
Streiffer got another assist in the 51st minute. Streiffer won the ball along the right sideline and crossed the ball to junior \1eolis Erikson. Erikson flipped over backwards and bicycle kicked the ball into the net for her second goal of the sea­son. 
Following Erikson's goal. Seton Hall battled back. In the 54th minute, preseason Big East offen­sive player of the year Kelly Smith took a Dana Sheffer pass behind the Irish defense and scored from just inside the box. 

Ten minutes later the Pirates scored again to cut the Irish lead to a single goal. Smith hit Frauke Dittel with a pass 18 yards from the goal that Diitel converted into Seton Hall's second goal of the game. 
For the final 27 minutes, the Irish defense shut down the Pirate attack. While allowing just two shuts in the remainder of the half. Notre Dame's defense also set up the final goal of the game. 
Freshman defender Vanessa Pruzinsky cleared the ball to fellow freshman Nancy Mikacenic in the 74th minute. Mikacenic lofted a pass to Anne Makinen who volleyed the ball into the net from 15 yards away. 
Makinen picked up her second goal of the year in her first game back with tlrn Irish after training with the Finnish National team. Her involvement with the national team caused her to miss the last four Notre Dame games. 
Makinen got another goal for the Irish on Sunday in their 4-0 defeat of the Scarlet Knights. Freshman Ashley Dryer and Streiffer assisted on Makinen's game winner in the 16th minute. Makinen dribbled through two defenders and fired a shot that beat goalkeeper Angel lladaway. 
Grubb added her second free kick goal of the weekend in the 34th minute to give the Irish a 2-0 lead. The Irish added another goal four minutes later when Streifl'er was fouled in the box by Uchenna Bright. Streiff'er converted the penalty kicked into her fifth goal of the year. · 
In the 53rd minute, Erikson scored her third goal of the year. She took a pass from Streiffer and dribbled through the box before shooting from five yards out to close the Irish scoring on the day.
