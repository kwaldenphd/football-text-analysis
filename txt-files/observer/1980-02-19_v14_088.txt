US, Iran 
agree to probe 
(AP) -The United States and 
Iran Ira:ve accepted the mem­
bership of a commission to 
investigate the former shah and 
the panel will go to Tehran in a 
few days, the United Nations 
announced yesterday, but there 
was no word on how or when 
this might bring release of the 
hostages held in the U.S. 
Embassy there. , 
A spokesman for the Moslem 
militants at the embassy told 
th~ Japanese newspaper Yomi­
un there was "no need for the 
U.N. to investigate the crimes of the former shah.'' He said ''Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and the Iranian people are still demanding the extradition of the shah and the return of his assets" before the hostages will be released. · 
''The United Nations' efforts t? break the impasse by appoin­ung a five-member commission to probe Iran's grievances is a 
U.S. plot being perpetrated through U.N. Secretary-Gener­al Kurt Waldheim," the mili­t~nt was quo~ed as saying in a drspatch momtored in Tokyo. 
In Washington, State Depart­ment officials said the diploma­tic plan for release was "on track,'' but with no firm time­ta?le. The .officials, speaking pnvately, satd the United States probably will not be certain about the freeing of the hostages ''until we see the whites of their eyes.''
~aldheim was quoted by a Vtenna newspaper as saying the hostages would be released "in the course of the commis­
sion's work. Otherwise one would not have received the agreement of the two sides." Acc~rdin~. to Die P_resse's today s edmon, Waldhetm said the commission's report would 
be handed over to him and he would forward it to the U.N. Security Council for whatever action it saw fit. . 
The commission to investigate Iranian grievances has been considered one of the steps that would lead to release of the approximately 50 Americans who have been held hostage at the occupied embassy in Teh­ran since Nov. 4. 
U.N. spokesman Rudolf Staj­duhar, who announced U.S. 
ac~eptance. of the members ?n _ Fnday.. satd a, Tehr~n offict~l has gtven Waldhetm Iran s acceptance by. telephon~ from Teh~~n. He satd Waldhetm was awamng telexed confirmation before officially announcing the pan~l m~mbers' names. 
.st~Jduhar told reporters the 
nmmg of the hostages' release as part of a package deal had not been finalized, but the commission's guidelines had been completed.

University officials reached a decision this weekend on the fate of the 40 scholarships temporarily withheld from six non-revenue producing sports, but according to executive committee members of the Board of Trustees, the decision will not be revealed until 
later this week. It was n.ot immediately clear last night why the announcement of t~e . dect.sJOn was delayed. According to James Murphy, vtce-prestdent f<?r Pubhc Relations and Development, the anl?oun~ement .wdl not be made until Fr. Theodore Hesburgh, Umversuy Prestdent, an~ Fr. EdmundJoyce, e?'ecurive vice-presi­dent, return from Flonda where the meetmg was held this 
weekend. 
The two are expected back Thursday. 
"All I can say at this point is that the whole subject of Title IX and athletics was discussed,', Murphy said. ''A statement is being prepared now and it will not be released until they return." 
T~e statem~nt, when released, may address the concerns of 30 varsity captams and student leaders who sent the executive committee~ letter asking them to consider seriously their action in the context of Notre Dame's leadership in sports. 
The letter asked the board to consider the value of minor sports "by more than their financial profitability," and pointed out that No.tre J?ame ."has long b~~n considered an enlightened sort of umversny whtch bases pohCJes on rationale more complex than the 
norm.'' 

A number of other topics were discussed at the executive meeting, according to .Murph~, including a reportgiven by Fr. John Van Wolvlear, vtce-prestdent for Student Affairs, on the recently conducted alcohol survey which claimed that Notre Dame students drink at a rate higher that the national norm. Murphy declined to elaborate further on Van Wolvlear's report or the board's reaction to it. 
The withholding ofthe 40 scholarships is just one dimension in a co~plet~ re.apprat~al of the status of minor sports promised by the Umverstty m a mtd-January statement released by the Athletic Department. 
Apparently, much of the reappraisal has been inspired by fears of Tttle IX, an act of the department of Health, Education, and Wel~are which prohibits discrimination in the form of sports fundmg based on sex. In a Grace Hall speech last Wednesday, Hesburgh denounced the regulation as "stupid" and observed 
that "they (HEW's female lawyers) don't have a clue what athletic administration is about.''

WINAMAC, Ind. (AP) -A Ford Motor Co. executive who said he was responsible for de­signing the 1973 Pinto testified yesterday that the ~ar was safe and wa!'\ involved in no more fatal fire crashes/ than other subcompacts. 
Ford is on trial charged with1 reckless homicide in the August 1978 burning death of three young women in a 1973 Pinto that exploded when hit from be­hind on a northern Indiana highway. 
The state contends that Ford recklessly designed the Pinto, knowing the fuel tank was sub­j~ct to explode in rear-end colli­sions, but sold the cars anyway without makin~ repairs or warning the public. 
The trial, now in its seventh week, is expected to continue at least into early March with de­fense testimony and prose­

Ford executive defends Pinto design 
cution rebuttal. fatal accidents. A traffic death researcher who Harold C. MacDonald, now MacDonald defended his deci­gave lectures to Ford engineers Ford's vice president of engine­sion to place the Pinto's fuel testified earlier Monday that he 
ering and research, said he was in charge of development when the Pinto was designed. 
MacDonald read from a fed­eral 9tudy which he said showed that in 1975 and 1976, 
1.9 percent of the nation's cars were Pintos, and 1.0 percent of the fatal accidents involving fire occurred in a Pinto. ,, ''These figures mean Pintos were having the same number offatal accidents with fire as all other cars -no better and no worse,'' MacDonaldisaid. 
He told the Pulaski Circuit Court jury that the Pinto met all/roposed federal standards an Ford's own standard for withstanding a 20MPH rear­end collision by a 4,000 pound moving vehicle without leaking more than one ounce of fuel on impact and one ounce after­ward. 
The 1973 Pinto's fuel system integrity also was ''fully equal to other subcompacts of that time," MacDonald said. 
He said , U.S. and Canadian government statistics also "suggested the Pinto was about equal to other cars of the time" in the number of fiery tank behmd the axle, a location the state has argued made the Pintomore dangerous. 
He said his father burned to death in 1932 when his car, which had the fuel tank over the axle, ran into a tree. 
"Because of that I feel the gas tank should be as far from the engine as possible," he said. 
Under cross examination, Pro­secutor Michael A. Cosentino pointed out that MacDonald received a yearly salary of $195,000 from Ford, was given a $200,000 bonus in 1978, and owns 13,000 to 14,000 shares of Ford stock. 
Cosentino told reporters he still believes former Ford Pres­ident Lee A. Iacocca -not MacDonald -was responsible for the design of the Pinto, and he said he will recall previous prosecution witnesses in an effort to prove that. Iacocca now is chairman of Chrysler Corp. 
Ford attorney James F. Neal said, "Big companies are made up of people like Mr. MacDo­nald -good, decent people, people doing the best they can tn a difficult world." . 

never discussed the danger of fire because "fires are extreme­ly rare as injury-causing accidents.'' 
Donald F. Huelke, a Univer­sity of Michigan anatomy pro­fessor, said he served as a con­sultant to Ford from 1964-73, giving about 10 lectures a year to the automaker's engineers. 
The lectures were designed "to show the people at Ford what was happenin~ in the real world,'' Huelke satd. But he added that none of the lectures concerned fire deaths or fire in rear-impact collisions. 
However, Huelke acknowledg­ed that of 3,500 accidents he has reconstructed, only two in­volved deaths by fire. 
Huelke said he has served as a consultant to the National High­way Traffic Safety Administra­tion. 
That agency had promrted Ford in Jtine 1978 to recal 1. 5 million Pintos and Mercury Bobcats made between 1971 and 1976 after government crash tests showed the fuel tanks leaked large amounts of fuel in moderate-speed rear­end collisions.

PRINCETON, N ,J. -A new service to help graduate schools examine the effectiveness of their doctoral programs is being offered jointly by the Graduate 
Record  Examinations  Board  
and  the  Council  of Graduate  
Schools.  

The Graduate Program Self­Assessment (GPSA) service uses questionnaires to gather judgments about a doctoral program from faculty members, students and alumni. Designed to serve as part of a school's overall evaluation effort, it pro­vides information in 12 areas, including curriculum, quality of teaching, student commitment and motivation, and faculty work environment. 
Questionnaires consist . of about 60 statements concermng characteristics of the program, with agree-disagree or poor-to·, 
excellent ratings as response 
options. 
In addition to making judg­
ments about a standard set of 
statements concerning each 
graduate/rogram, respondents 
are aske to indicate their own 
personal characteristics, train­
ing and experience, and report 
recent academic or professional 
achievements. They are also 
asked to answer up to 10 
questions prepared by the de­
partment itself to inquire about 
specific local concerns and pro­
gram elements. 
No names are requested on 
the questionnaires, and all in­
formation is confidential. · Questionnaires used in the 
GPSA service have been adapt­
ed from similar questionnaires 
developed in the mid-1970s by 
Educational Testing Service 
(ETS) in cooperation with com­mittees of graduate deans and faculty members. -Those sur­veys were used by ETS to study quality ofdoctoral education for the Council of Graduate Schools under a grant from the National Science Foundation. 

For additional information, write to Graduate Program Self­Assessment Service, Box 2878, Educational Testing Service, Princeton, N.). 08541; or call (609) 921~9000, ext. 2072.

The Observer On feminist issues 
Group sponsors information 
by Maryellen Bradley 
The Notre Dame Women's Reading Group will sponsor support gt uups of six to ten women to inform women of feminist issues that affect them within the University. These rrconsciousness-raising''groups will deal with the spectal psych­ological and social problems that Notre Dame women face, according to Renee Leuchten, a senior American Studies maJor. 
She organized the Women's Reading Group last November to discuss arttcles, books, and films concerning women. 
''I think women at Notre Dame need a women's group," stated Leuchten, '"but they don't rea­lize it. They don't know when they are being descriminated against.'' 
Saint Mary's sponsors assertiveness workshops 
by Mal}' Leavitt St.iORepurter 
Saint Mary's Counseling and C:.nt:-er Development Center is sponsoring t h rce separ~te wurkshops in the upcomtng weeks dealing with assertive­ness training, life planning and human pllt<.:ntial. 
l'he Assertiveness Training workshop will be held once a wed for five weeks from 6-8 
p.m. beginning Fe-b. 20. The sessions will include lectures and c:xercises which will teach students how to assert them­sl'ivc:s. Each week, students will set "assertiveness goals" for themselves which they will try to reach in their daily lives. Ton\' Campbell and Mary The­is, As:-.istant Directors of the center will conduct the work­shop. 
On Feb. 20 and 27, a Life Planning Workshop will meet from 8-l):.)O p.m. in Regina S1>uth Lounge. The aim of this workslwp is to help students integrate the varied fragments of their lives. Such questions as ''I low will my majorrelate to my lifestyle?" and "How do I work towards my goals?" will be discussed with students. Theis and Mary Ann O'Don­nell, the director of Regina Hall, will direct this workshop. 
Beginning Feb. 27, a Human Potential Workshop will meet every Wednesday for_ eight weeks trom 3:30-5:30 p.m. The workshop will teach students to build on their strengths rather than their weaknesses. Accord­ing to the directors, focusing on one· s strenghts will raise a

The group organized a Wo­men's Night at the Nazz, which approximately 40 women atten­ded. Leucthen expressed her disappointment over the turn­out; saying "I thought all the feminist.s of Notre Dame would come, but they didn't." 
· This caused Leuchten to ques­tion the viability of a feminist group on campus. She said she considers the group to be an "ad hoc" organization. 
The group members consider themselve:> "watch dogs" of the University's policy on such interests as admissions require­ments, housing conditions, and the Title IX issue. Luechten said she formed the group because she believed that the administration showed little concern for women's needs and rights.

change attitudes about drink­ing-related problems and ways of dealing with them,'' Pelli­grini said. "We hope to get more rectors to (nvolve their RA_'s: in our RA prevention' tratntng program. 
The prevention training pro· gram for RA's will take place this spring. The program is intended to help enable RA's to recognize the symptoms of problem drinkers among stu­dents. ''The training program is not campus-wide," Pelligrini said. "We hope to expand the program to mclude all the dorms. We'll get a feel for the response on Wednesday.'' 
The Psychological Services Department also hopes to get students involved in the educa­tion program. "We feel that the drinking problem at Notre Dame is a campus-wide pro­blem," Pelligrim said. "The alcohol survey results suggest· that more questions need to be asked as to how serious the drinking problem here is .. The administration is becoming in­creasingly concerned over drinking-related problems on campus. Unless students get involved in the education pro­gram, in addition to the rectors and RA's, the program will fail." 
''The new education program will target next year's Fresh­men," Pwlligrini said. Plans are being discussed with Fresh-MacNutt met four years ago in Jerusalem.

"We're trying to discover what ~he conrribu_rion of college expenence at Notre Dame is on a student's drinking patterns,'' Pelligrini said.

With 66runners Women trackste~s begin first season· 
Kelly Sullivan Sports Writer 

Some ingenuity and a little effort were all it took for a handful of runners to form a competitive women's track club at Notre Dame. A notice in the Obsrrver urging participation in the club drew numerous responses from women wishing to compete and prompted soph­omore Joe Costic co volunteer his services as coach. 
''I was going to run for the men's track team but I ruined my knee in interhall football," explained the New Jersey na­tive. "I still wanted to be involved in sports, so I volun­teered to coach the club." Costic is receiving assistance from a few students in his section at St. Ed's HaH who have offered to help out with the field events. 
Some 60 runners, including 6 
from St. Mary's, ha-ve signed 
up for the squad which works 
out regularly at the ACC.. 
Inexperience will pose prob­
lems for Costic's club, com­
posed mainly of freshmen and 
sophomores. "Some of the 
girls aren't even sure what 
events they'd like to run," the 
coach added. 
Tl;e track team participated 
in its first meet on February 1, 
competing at Western Michi­
gan against 9 other schools. 
The Insh finished in 6th place. 
However, Notre Dame's coach 
was quick to point out that 7 of 
those 9 teams were scholarship 
funded squads with a varsity 
status. ''The meet showed that 
we're not yet ready to compete 
against varsity teams. The 
schools running clubs like ours 
_ 

we  beat  handily,  so  we're  
someplace  in  between  right  
now.''  .  

The Irish showed promtse with the performance of some talented individuals. Freshman Kathy Jones took a ?th place in the long jump, while distance runner Kathy Merra and the relay team of Jackie. Bollas, Bernie Bolass, Mary Rtce, and Mary O'Connor finished 6th in the 5000 meter and mile relay, respectively. 
For the Western Michigan meet, the Notre Dame athletiC department granted special dis­pensation to allow the St. Mary's women to compete on Notre Dame's team; in the future, however, the Belles will run for SMC. Costic will look, for sophomore Annette Isom to 
. do well. in the 2000 meter and 2 mile races, and has high hopes for sophomore Barb Jacob in the 1000 meter run. Jacob, a Maryland native, was the high school state champion in that event. · 
Nine meets are posted on Notre Dame's schedule· this year, 6 of which will be run during the -outdoor season that begins in late March. The Irish also' plan to host their own Notre Dame invitational which tentatively includ~s Purdue, Machester, and Hillsdale col­leges. "It would be nice if we could beat all the teams there," offered Costic, "but we won't get any better for the cham­pionships in May if we always run ~gainst people we can beat.

The 6-5 sentor from Indtanapolts, who had a disc removed Dec. 27 and missed 15 games and eight weeks of play, returned to the H?osier lin up and scored 18 points to lead the way to a 66-55 vtctory at I?wa. He also scored 24 points in a 67-54 triumph over Mmnesota. IN addition Woodson was a perfect 10-for-10 from the free throw li~e in the two games and had eight rebounds and eight assists.

followed with 121.93. .

Dan Christensen. DiSabato pushed his career win total over the century mark to 101, while setting a new team standard for tournament wins in a season with 15 match vic:tories, bet­tering his own sophon10re mark of 14. 
The senior freestyler also shat­tered his record of 19 near falls in a season with a new mark of 
30. He is one viet-ry shy of tying his own record for most victories in a season, 29, set in 1977-78. 
The curtain will go down on DiSabato's last scheduled per­formance tomorrow when the Irish travel to Purdue for an afternoon dual meet. But the encores are sure to keep coming when the NCAA tournament begins at the end of this month.
