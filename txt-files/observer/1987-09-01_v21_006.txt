WASHINGTON-A top Soviet arms control official today of­fered for the first time to ac­cept a U.S. proposal for moni­toring nuclear tests, and even offered to let the United States 
explode its own bomb in the So­viet Union to calibrate monitor­ing equipment. 
The chief U.S. negotiator to arms control talks in Geneva, 
Kampelman, immedi­ately said the offer was worth pursuing.

Chervov said his statment could include adoption of the Cortex test monitoring system which earlier had been pro­posed by the U.S. side. The sys­tem involves placing a detec­tion device in a hole bored near the site of an atomic explosion. 
Kampelman said it was the first time he had heard a Soviet official make such an offer. "This to me was a new thought, and I have to check that out," Kampelmann told reporters after the luncheon. "We'll look at it."

SMC Board plans activities 
By MIMI TUOHY Staff Reporter 
Activities Night, National Banned Books Week and a record album commemorat­ing 100 years of Notre Dame football were just some of the topics discussed at the Saint Mary's Programming Board meeting Monday night in Haggar College Cen­ter. 
Smith Hashagen, vice president for student affairs, announced that Activities Night is scheduled for tonight in Angela Athletic Facility from 8 to 10 p.m. Various extracurricular clubs and teams will be represented, as well as cer­tain other organizations from the South Bend area. 
"Project Head Start, Big 
TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 1, 1987 
Brother!Big Sister of South Bend, and many other local groups will be participating. I'm looking forward to a great student turnout," said Hashagen. 
The Programming Board unanimously approved the showing of Francois Truf­faut's film "Farenheit 451" during National Banned Books Week, September 20­26. 
"This is a perfect film be­cause it deals with the bur­ning of books. Combined with National Constitution Week, September 13-19, we will all be reminded of how free we really are," said Georgeanna Rosenbush, as­sistant director of student activities. 
In other business, "100 Years," a record album commemorating the tOOth anniversary of Notre Dame football, was played for the board members. 
Paula Abowd, a Notre Dame junior whose family wrote and produced the single, explained that the song is being endorsed by the Notre Datne Alumni As­sociation and each copy will cost $4.00. 
"Since only two Notre Dame dorms <Walsh and Saint Ed's) are selling them, I am sure that an organiza­tion on the Saint Mary's campus will also be inter­ested in participating. Hope­fully, this will be a great fundraiser for the Notre Dame-Saint Mary's commu­nity," said Hashagen. 
Hut the academy, the West Point of the Philippines, im­posed a news blackout and cadets could not be reached for confirmation that this was the case. 
The statement accused Aquino of treason and vowed the revolt would continue "un­til political conditions shall have been stabilized and a clean and honest presidential election shall have been held." 
boats attacked the 24,349-ton container ship Jebel Ali off the United Arab Emirates coast near the Strait of Hormuz. 
The owners, the Kuwait­based United Arab Shipping Co., said the ship was bound for Dubai when attacked "by a speedboat firing rockets and machine guns." 
The 32-man crew and two wives who were aboard were unhurt and the ship reached Dubai for repairs, the company said. 
It was the first such incident attributed to Iranian forces since Iraq resumed air attacks on Iranian targets in the gulf Saturday, ending a 45-day lull. 
Tehran has said Kuwaiti ships and any U.S. warship es­corts would not be exempt from its retaliation against Iraq's weekend resumption of air raids. 
Iraqi jets, in their longest ranging missions in months, ranged 600 miles to the Strait of Hormuz to strike near Iran's Larak island oil terminal.

Dole, Ortega debate 
U.S. involvement 
Associated Press 
MANAGUA, Nicaragua-A public meeting Monday be­tween Senate Republican leader Bob Dole and President Daniel Ortega turned into a tense debate over U.S. and So­viet involvment in Nicaragua. 
The Kansas senator, on a two-day fact-finding trip to Central America, at one point called the nearly hour-long dis­cussion a "propaganda rally." 
Afterward, he told repoters, "Let me indicate we were dis­enchanted. We were quite dis­appointed that what we hoped might be a serious meeting turned into a circus." 
During the public session, which was broadcast live over the government's Voice of Nicaragua radio station, Dole urged Ortega to agree to three­way negotiations among the Sandinista government, the Reagan administration and the Nicaraguan Contra rebels to bring about a cease-fire. The

Student Senate approves name change 
By GREG LUCAS Senior Staff Reporter 
In its first meeting of the school year Monday night, the Student Senate voted unani­mously to approve the Student Activities Board's decision to change its name to the Student Union Board. 
In order to become official, the name change also has to be approved by the Hall Presi­dents' Council, said Laurie Bink, student body vice presi­dent. 
According to Janel Blount, board manager, the decision to change the organization's name was made to allay con­fusion between the student board and the Office of Student Activities, an arm of the ad­ministration. 
Blount also said that by in­corporating the "Union" into its name, the Notre Dame board assures itself easier communications with other outside organizations. 
In other business, the senate gave its overwhelming support to an idea presented by junior John Raphael to hold a Rosary 

Devotion in the Grotto on Octo­ber 7. 
Negotiators agreed to leave the question of the voting age, now 20, until new election laws are written. The opposition wants to lower the age to 18. 
Chun, an army general when he gained power in 1980, is to leave office in February after a seven-year term. Rob, also a former general, aided Chun in his rise to power.

South Korea negotiates democratic revisions 
Associated Press 
SEOUL, South Korea-Gov­
ernment and opposition 
negotiators broke a deadlock 
Monday by agreeing on con­
stitutional revisions that will 
provide direct presidential 
elections and other democratic 
reforms. 
Labor turmoil continued, 
with about 700 strikes for 
higher pay, better working con­
ditions and free unions still un­
resolved. 
Spokesmen for the governing 
Democratic Justice Party and 
main opposition Reunification 
Democratic Party said rewrit­
ing of the charter was expected 
to begin Tuesday. 
"I am delighted," said Roh 
Tae-woo, head of the govern­
ment party and its candidate 
to succeed President Chun Doo­
hwan next February. 
Optimism about the 
breakthrough was clouded by 
opposition leader Kim Young­
sam's refusal to meet with Rob 
on Monday because of the po­
litical prisoners issue. 
Kim canceled the meeting 
hours before it was to begin. 
He accused the government of 
rounding up more political 
prisoners and said a new crack­
down might be under way. 
Kim says about 330 political 
prisoners still are being held 
and demands that they be 
freed. He also wants civil rights 
restored to those opponents of 
the government still black­
listed for political activities. 
"We are concerned that the 
government has launched a 
major suppression of moderate 
elements in the opposition," 
Kim told reporters. 
Police broke up anti­
government demonstrations in 
Seoul and other cities last 
Friday. It was the worst politi­
cal violence since weeks of 
protest that led to Chun's ac­
ceptance June 30 of opposition 
demands for reform.

Military communiques from Baghdad said Iraqi jets hit two Iranian ships Sunday night and Monday morning. 
The London-based Lloyds Shipping Intelligence Unit con­firmed only that the 113,788-ton tanker Shoush, owned by the state-run Iranian National Tanker Co., was hit Sunday. 
The ship's engine room was set ablaze, but there was no fur­ther word on damage or injur­ies, shipping sources said. 
The sources spoke on condi­tion of not being identified. 
In dispatches monitored in 
Cyprus, the Baghdad govern­
ment's official Iraq News 
Agency quoted a military 
spokesman as saying Iraq will 
continue striking Iran's oil ter­
minals and other vital targets.

American life relies upon Constitution 
After a summer of anniversaries, the most important one was largely over­looked. One wonders, in a pause that refreshes, how much overkill does it take to convince people that Elvis Pres­ley died ten years ago. Whether his ghost, his grave, or Elvis himself can speak to middle-aged women remains a mystery, but so much print is wasted on seeking the truth in such matters, that naive foreigners would assume Elvis Presley and Marilyn Monroe greeted Columbus in the West Indies. 

Ken Kollman 
guest column 
The truth is that 200 years ago our Constitution was made to stand above the rituals of human law. Its status as the most profound and important docu­ment in recent world history is un­diminished by time, and the ability to withstand a history of rapid change and discovery testifies to our Constitution's brilliant design. With this in mind, this 

summer's glaring lack of media atten­tion to its anniversary is disturbing. 
What is disappointing is the collective lack of will to devote popular attention to the most important American an­niversary of the decade. The 40th an­niversary of the end of World War 11 stirred debate about the ethics of nu­clear weapons, the 100th birthday of the Statue of Liberty extended the dialogue over immigration laws, and every year the anniversary of the 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision magnifies the contro­versy of abortion. Why have the an­niversaries of the deaths of Elvis Pres­ley and Marilyn Monroe grabbed more attention this summer than our Consti­tution? 
It's not apparent where the blame rests. Certainly Iranamok grabbed away many headlines. But Elvis and Marilyn? In fairness, both Time and Newsweek had inspiring cover stories, and journals like Smithsonian ran bril­liant articles about the history of the Constitutional Convention. The fever for information, though, never caught on, especially in television and the daily

Cruising back to school in the family truckster, I found myself paging through my hometown newspaper, The Plain Dealer. My eye fell upon a review of the latest album by John Cougar Mel­lencamp. I don't remember exactly what it said, but I do recall the article as being quite negative. Now, I am not a JCM fan by any means, but I had heard his new song, and I thought it was pretty good. I did not really think much of it at the time, since I find it difficult to agree with most music reviewers.

guest column 

However, on my second day back on campus, I had a similar experience. While reading the Scholastic during one of the gourmet meals served in South Dining Hall, my eye fell on another music review. As I skimmed over the article, I noticed this particular critic berating U2, The Cult, and the Suburbs­-three groups which I thought were pretty good. Was I really that off in my musical taste? Or could the problem lie in the critics and their reviews? 
I do not know any music critics per­sonally, so what I say about them is only what I can surmise from what they write. The usual attitude in these reviews is that if I play in a band or if I listen to groups that no one else does, then I am an authority in critiqing music. The complexity of music and the huge variety of styles makes this logic absurd. It would be the same as saying that since I have painted a pic­ture, I therefore have the ability to cri­tique a painting by Salvador Dali. Even within the scope of rock music today, so many styles exist that it would take years to accumulate enough experience to be able to judge today's music. 
Just as in any art form, music draws heavily on subjectivity. No one knows how I will react to a certain song, or how that song will affect me. For ex­ample, my father and I will never see eye to eye on a song like Pink Floyd's "Comfortably Numb." However, that does not take away from the song itself. Although we disagree, he will under­stand my attraction to the song because of my experiences with and my expo­sure to that type of music; in the same way, I will understand his aversion to it. 
Another complaint I have with music critics is their despise for anything popular. The logic seems to follow that the more popular a band, the less talent they have. Admittedly, the shifting pop scene holds few budding Mozarts. Yet, when a Peter Gabriel or Paul Simon print media. 
Two opportunities for improvement were lost this summer. First, popular attention on the Constitutional Conven­tion itself could have improved Amer­ican cultural history. James Madison, rightly called the father of the Consti­tution, barely holds a place in collective memory. Deserving of glory like the names of Jefferson, Washington, Adams, Franklin, Madison and Hamil­ton get little space in our history. If one goal of history is accuracy, then the achievements of the men who forged compromises at the Convention deserve attention and fame. 
Second, there was an opportunity to imporve the Constitution itself. America needs a spirit of rejuvenation that only a new president can bring, b11t attention on the Constitution could have focused on possible amendments. Not one presidential candidate has seriously proposed a constitutional amendment, or even better, a new con­stitutional convention that might help solve some deep problems in America. 
In light of a status quo where the un­derclass grows every day, where race 
and class divisions scar our population; 
where international commitments ex­
tend far beyond our economic power; 
where our foreign policy process is muddled and uncertain; where crime rates continue to soar far above other Western nations; and where budget deficits threaten our economy with fu­ture inflation and depression -can't we use the Constitution to improve life in America? 
Proper attention to the anniversary of the Constitution could stir Americans to support a better constitution through a wider knowledge of our country's his­tory and by making the Constitution work for us. A new constitutional con­vention is in order because the docu­ment itself can be improved, as well as life in America, which must be im­proved. 
A good, readable book on the Consti­tution is welcome on the best seller list. Instead, books on Elvis, Marilyn, Vanna and Ollie ....

remain amenable 
skyrockets to the top of the charts, the critics find themselves in a bit of a bind. Should they depart from the usual music critic mentality, and actually praise something which is popular? Or do they give in and denounce old favorites as having given in to the pop music scene? This problem might be eliminated if these critics broke out of their esoteric shells and actually did what they are supposed to do-listen to the music. 
Even after listening, these critics have to remember that this is their opinion that they are giving, not the official dogma. I do not wish to offend any music critics; I merely want to remind them that they are not the only ones who listen to music. and that maybe, just maybe, they might find a good song on the radio once in a while.

Redbirds run streak to six 
Associated Press 
ST. LOUIS-John Tudor pitched eight shutout innings as St. Louis beat the Cincinnati Reds 4-0 Monday night for the Cardinals' sixth straight vic­tory. 
The Reds, third in the Na­tional League West, have dropped nine of their last 10 games. 
Tudor, 5-2, allowed five hits, walked one and struck out four in his seventh start since com­ing off the disabled list. Todd Worrell got the final three outs for the first-place Cardinals, al­lowing one hit. 
Willie McGee extended his hitting streak to 12 games in leading the Cardinals' offense with a single, double and two runs batted in. 
Pirates 7, Braves 3 
PITTSBURGH -Mike Dunne pitched a six-hitter and rookie Jose Lind hit a two-run triple as Pittsburgh beat the Atlanta Braves 7-3 Monday night for 
the Pirates' seventh straight 
victory. 

Dunne, 9-5, allowed an un­
earned run in the third and 
gave up Ozzie Virgil's 24th 
homer, a two-run shot, in the 
seventh.

Sandberg's first-inning home 
run established a single-season 
Chicago record for homers and 
the Cubs defeated Houston 4-3

Astros to their season-high 
sixth straight loss. 
Sandberg's home run, his 
15th, gave the Cubs 183 for the

making forward from Califor­nia. Together last season McCourt and Morris combined for 23 goals and 16 assists. 
McCourt's reputation has 
spread ever since he cracked 
the top 10 for individual scoring 
in the nation last season. Heavy 
marking and cheap fouls may 
be in the future for McCourt, 
but he doesn't believe the other 
teams will change their strat­
egy that much . 

"It doesn't mean they weren't looki11g for me in the past," said McCourt. "I'd get fouled all the time. But having .Randy up there makes things a lot easier, because if they key on me, he'll take them to the 
hole."

Grace is hoping that McCourt will be a goal-a-game player this season. But McCourt isn't pressuring himself to score every game this season -just certain games. 
"I'll especially try hard against teams I didn't score against last season, like Mic­h,igan State and Bowling Green," said McCourt. "I had lots of opportunities, but I kept hitting the posts and crossbars. 
"Last year I wanted to do the goal-a-game thing, but a lot of games when we were winning big I would slack off and not get a goal. I want to try harder and keep pushing in those games." 
Junior Pat Murphy (three goals, two assists) provides ex­tra speed and quickness on the front line. And two freshmen, Danny Stebbins of Milwaukee and Rob LaMear of St. Louis, should also see playing time immediately. Grace is espe­cially high on Stebbins, who was recruited by several soc­cer powers, including Indiana. 
"Danny Stebbins is going to be a very, very fine college player," said Grace. 
The midfield positions have the most depth on the team. Re­turning are senior Paul Gluck­ow, juniors Joe Sternberg and Kurt Roemer and sophomore Rolfe Behrje. Gluckow is cur­rently out of action with a knee injury, but is expected to begin practicing soon. Roemer returns to the Irish after mis­sing last season for academic reasons. 
Grace has a number of players that can also fill in at the midfield position. Guignon has also been playing midfield, moving up from the stopper po­sition. "Johnny will be going between double stopper and midfield, depending on the game situation," said Grace. "He reads the game very well." 
Freshman Steve LaVigne of St. Louis also is in the same position as Guignon, targeted for either stopper or midfield . 
The defense has experience, but positions are not finalized. Senior captain Steve Lowney will start the season at

ural position is wingback. Whe­ther Lowney will play wingback depends on the prog­ress of freshman sweeper Mike Drury of Westfield, N.J. 
Juniors Dan Gordon and Tom Pernsteiner and sophomore Dave Augustyn will all see ac­tion at the wingback position, as will freshman Paul LaVigne, the twin brother of Steve. 
Likewise things are not set 
at the keeper position. Sopho­more Dan Lyons has emerged as the starter, but senior Tim Hartigan has played well ever 
since coming back from a knee injury this week and will see action in the Loyola contest. 
"The key is the defense,"
said Guignon. "Everyone is set up front and the halves all have two years experience. But Tim Hartigan and Dan Lyons have both been playing well, Har­tigan especially ever since he came back from the injury. I couldn't believe how well he's played. He's so quick, he's an animal out there." 
With the large number of players comes the problem of playing time. Some players will be on the bench, but Grace usually begins the season by getting in as many players as possible. 
"I always sub a lot anyway," said Grace. "We have to find the best combinations that we have.

Bobinski says the longest lines at Notre Dame are not for football but for graduation tick­ets. 
"It's ·big time at graduation when you have to get someth­ing for the parents. Football lines are shorter, but they wait longer." 
Some juniors began lining up Monday morning, a practice Bobinski would like to dis­courage. 
"It can cause some confusion with all the seniors plus some juniors waiting around," he said. "It can't make that much of a difference -there really isn't a bad seat in the whole stadium." 
Because the order of seats sold goes up the rows rather than across, Bobinski says the first junior in line will not nec­essarily get the closest seats to the field. 
The Class of '89 gets their chance to squeeze as close to the fifty-yard as possible Tues­day. Although the lines are already forming, once again Gate 10 will not open until 1:30 p.m.
