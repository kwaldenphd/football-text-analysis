Prominent journalists speak on campus 
"60 Minutes" anchor Mike Wallace visits ND 
By SH ElLA FLYNN 
News Writer 
Known for his abrasive interview­ing style. "60 Minutes" anchor Mike Wallace found himself on the other side of tough questioning Wednesday at Notre Dame. 
While participltt­

ing in an intervillW and question-and­answer session iri McKenna llall. Wallace was asked about controversial comments he made at a 1987 ethical panel discussion. 

When faced with a Wallace hypothetical situa­tion in which an American war reporter could choose to follow a story or warn U.S. troops of danger, Wallace disagreed with another pan­elist and said journalists had no higher duty ·other than to report. 
"You're a reporter. Granted you're an American." he told Jennings. ''I'm a little bit at a loss to understand why, because you're an American, you would not have covered that story" 
"You don't have a higher duty. No. No. You're a reporter!" 
But Wallace expressed a very dif­ferent view Wednesday when asked if his views on the hypothetical situ­ation had since changed. 
"Yes," Wallace said. "I made the wrong quick reaction." 
Wallace participated in an inter­view with American Studies profes­sor Hobert Schmuhl and answered questions from the audience. And the theme of journalistic responsibil­ity ~ not just in wartime situations, but in politics and society, in general -figured prominently in the ses­sion.

A former Saint Mary's stu­dent who accused former Notre Dame football player Clifford Jefferson of rape will be able to pursue her federal lawsuit against both Notre Dame and Saint Mary's, the South Bend Tribune reported. 
The woman, who was a freshman at the time of the March 2001 incident, seeks damages due to the two schools' alleged misconduct. She maintains Jefferson raped her in his car outside her dorm as she slipped in and out of consciousness after returning intoxicated with Jefferson from a South Bend bar. 
The South Bend Tribune reported she claims the school is liable for the circumstances contributing to her being raped and the failure to discipline Jefferson, who graduated in 2001. 
Both Notre Dame spokesman Matt Storin and Saint Mary's spokeswoman Melanie McDonald declined to comment on the lawsuit.

Prominent New York Times foreign corre­spondent Anthony DePalma shared his career experiences, encouraged journalistic honesty and emphasized the advantages of a broad liberal arts education as compo­nents of a lecture he delivered at Notre Dame Wednesday night. 
Addressing a room filled with political sci­ence, history and American studies majors, DePalma stressed that undergraduate preparation for a career in journalism does not necessarily need to center around a major in journalism or communications. Rather, he said that prominent editors are far more interested in a reporter's inquisi­tive abilities and writing instinct than a course load stacked with journalism classes. 
"You can put it in the bank that those doing the hiring are looking for a deep, inherent curiosity -an interest in what people do, why they do it and how the world works," DePalma said. "On top of that, jour­nalists need endurance. They need to be curious not only about today, but about tomorrow, next year and the year after that." 
DePalma urged prospective journalists to develop such qualities with a wide curricu­lum that includes a language specialty, par­alleling his own entrance into the field. While he graduated from Seton Hall University with a "dreaded degree in com­munications," he said he chose the program over English because its more flexible requirements allowed him to take more electives.

Conununity Relations office 111oves downtown 
By MATT SMEDBERG 
News Writer 

Notre Dame's Office of Community Relations is moving to a new location today, with a ribbon-cutting ceremony to be presided over by South Bend mayor Stephen Luecke and University President Father Edward Malloy. The office's new home will be at 217 S. Michigan St., in a building downtown leased from Memorial Hospital. 
Sharing the space will be two other Notre Dame ventures: the South Bend Downtown Design Center, run by the School of Architecture, and the Crossroads Gallery, an art gallery run by the Snite Museum, the Department of Art and the Institute for Latino Studies. 
The Office of Community 
Relations is headed by Jackie Rucker, who was hired last April. The purpose of the office is to be a bridge between the University and the greater South Bend Community. 

Hucker, who grew up in South Bend, admits that relations between the University and the community have been "less than stellar" in the past. Things began to change with the foundation of the Center for Social Concerns in 1983, she said, as well as the ini­tiative by Father Jim Hoemer to create a University-sponsored Christmas in April program. The same program still exists under the name Rebuilding Together. Hoemer was director of the Office of Community Relations until he retired last year.

Hype up Halloween 
What a great time of year! The leaves are changing colors as fast as the "die-hard" alumni make fire Ty websites to show their support for our team. The temperature is dropping more

ethic, and we all 

know what that Photographer 
means ... 
Halloween! 

This festive fall holiday is generally known for dressing up in ridiculous costumes and wreaking havoc on the neigh­borhood with your friends while raking in bags of free candy. . Evenings are filled with young chil­.dren flocking to random doorbells in eager anticipation of their yearly payoff. Then the nights bring out the teens with their shaving cream and eggs ready to ambush the next group of friends they see. However it is obvious that these activities seem to have been lost in the shuf­fle here at Notre Dame. 
Entranced by midterms, group projects and other forms of time­consuming studies, the majority of the student body finds it impossible to squeeze in a full day of mischief and shenanigans. This year is dif­ferent from my other years at Notre Dame since Halloween does­n't conveniently fall the day before a huge test or important presenta­tion. Rather, it falls on a Friday for the first time since 1997. 
We all need to take this rare opportunity to dress up like com­plete idiots and have some fun. Go to a haunted house, carve a pump­kin, do something to take a break. This is the perfect chance to escape the ever-present pressures of your classes for a day or two and stop being so uptight and boring. 
Everyone needs to do themselves a favor and squeeze into a wild costume your friends always said you would never wear. And by wild costume I don't mean being a cow­boy. I'm talking a 6-foot-5 225­pound guy wearing a mini tennis skirt and an exact replica top of a Florida State cheerleader. 
For the ladies I'm suggesting, against my better judgment I might add, that you steer away from the overdone Catholic schoolgirl or devil in favor of a more original costume like a Russian girl scout who just got done skiing the Swiss Alps and desperately wants to dance with a stuffed monkey. 
Smile. Laugh. Be crazy. Go against your anal-retentive instincts and let go of all your cares for just a bit and let loose, dance, party. Basically, be the little kid buried deep inside you know you want to be for just this one night.

Man Charged for Having Snake In Freezer 
RUTLAND, Vt. -A man picked up a dead rat­tlesnake he found on the side of a road and stuck it in his freezer to keep as a souvenir. Now, he finds himself in court. 
Timothy Duprey pleaded innocent Monday in Vermont District Court to possession of a species pro­tected under the state's Endangered Species Act. 
"Most people aren't even aware we have them in Vermont," said Game Warden Robert Sterling. "They're not on the federal Endangered Species Act, but they are protected under the Vermont Endangered Species Act." 

.Sterling said an anony­mous caller reported that Duprey had the snake. The rattler was found in the freezer of Duprey's home in August, according to court records. 
He was issued a criminal citation and appeared in court Monday.

Filipino Princess discusses Muslim. culture 

By LAURA VILIM 
News Writer 

In an attempt to help educate students and faculty about the lives and cultures of Muslims, the University hosted a lecture Wednesday by Filipino Princess Emraida Kiram entitled "Being a Muslim in Christian Philippines." 
Kiram, who was born in the predominately Muslim region of Mindanao to Sultan Kiram and Sultana Bai Labi Laila Kiram, focused her talk on the hostile relations between Muslims and Christians. She also highlighted the way these relations have dic­tated political and economic change within her country for centuries. 
The estimated 3.5 million peo­ple -less than five percent of the Filipino population -who are Muslims in the Philippines are concentrated largely in the southern regions of Mindanao and Sulu. Although there are far

more Christians than Muslims in the Philippines, several powerful Muslim separatist groups have been founded to protest the treatment of their people by the overwhelmingly Christian-led military and government. 
Kiram began her lecture with a n account of her childhood, a time she remembers as one that was relatively peaceful between Christian and Muslims. She com­mented on the case with which she lived in both the Christian and Muslim world by taking on a Christian name in school while practicing her Muslim beliefs at home. 
As time progressed and Kiram continued to seek higher educa­tion, she increasingly became aware of the stereotypes and insults thrown at her religion by the Christian majority. Although she had obtained a law degree and was enrolled in a journalism program in Manila, she was out­cast by Muslims and Christians alike. 
"People thought that to be educated meant to be Christianized," Kiram said. "It was in Manila that I realized the stereotypes against Muslims." 
In addition, Muslim women were encouraged to focus on marriage, not education, for it was dishonorable for Muslim men to marry someone smarter than they were. Thus, Kiram recalled that by her early 20s, she knew that she was being oppressed but failed to under­stand the reasons why her reli­gion was being attacked. 
Because Kiram could not start a career or continue her educa­tion due to the strife in the Philippines, she moved to Madrid just as the Muslim Separatist Movement was gain­ing momentum in her home country. During the middle of the 1970s, Muslim rebels waged violence against the Philippine military and the Marcos govern­ment. resulting in the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Muslims and the displacement of more than a million others. Under intense pressure from the Moros National liberation Front (MNLF) and other rebel groups, Marcos made some concessions to the Muslim Filipinos, which put a brief end the widespread fighting. 
Currently, Kiram and her fel­low Filipino Muslims arc still fighting for political and eco­nomic autonomy from the Philippine nation. They arc ask­ing to be given back their com­munally owned ancestral land that was taken from them and redistributed by Christians. 
"It is very dillicult to imagine a time when the government will sit down and talk with us," Kiram said. 
Until this time comes and Muslims begin to feel a sense of independence from what they view as the harsh rule of the entirely Christian Filipino cabi­net, discord between these two groups will continue to escalate. 
As a way of promoting knowl­edge of the Muslim-Christian conflict in the Philippines, Kiram has worked for the past 27 years at the University of Wisconsin­Milwaukee, is the chair of the Wisconsin Chapter of the National Federation of Filipino­American Associations, and serves as president of the Wisconsin Chapter of the Filipino-American National Historical Society.

munity leaders to make the University's influence in the community a positive one. She is on the board planning the development of the Northeast Neighborhood adjacent to cam­pus. 
"Residents have come to me," Rucker said, "to tell me how much they appreciated the way the University built the houses on Notre Dame Avenue. One woman told me that it looks just the way she remembers it from when she was a little 
girl." 
Much of Community Relations' work is in conjunc­tion with Downtown South Bend, a local nonprofit organi­zation which is dedicated, according to their mission statement, to restoring local economy and fostering a "vibrant Downtown ... for a better quality of life in South Bend." 
DTSB also works with the South Bend Downtown Design Center. or Urban Studio, whose new home is the second floor of the building that houses the Community Relations offices. The Studio consists of 15 advanced architecture students under the direction of John Stamper, associate chair of the School of Architecture. The stu­dents -fifth-year students in the fall semester, fourth-years in the spring -work on designs for buildings or renova­tions that would affect and ben­efit the local community. 
The students' task this semester is to design a new building for the Studebaker National Museum, whose previ­ous home was declared struc­turally unsound and unsafe several years ago. The new site is attached to the Northern Indiana Center for History on Chapin Street in South Bend. 

Though the ceremonial open­ing of the center takes place on Thursday morning. the stu­dents are already moved in and hard at work finishing their designs. 
Student designs will be sub­mitted to Rebecca Bonham, director of the museum, and local. architects. Stamper said that, for this reason, it's very likely that when the fmal word is spoken, elements from these students' designs will probably figure in it. 
But having their work actual­ly built is not the real purpose of the Urban Studio. It is "so that students can get real­world experiences," said Kara Kelly, the Architecture School's director of communications. "The nice thing is that we have no agenda. The students work with community leaders and developers, and can emphasize the good of the community in their design process." 
The third University entity that calls the former storefront home is the Crossroads Gallery, which is a joint venture of the Art Department, the Snite Gallery and the Institute for Latino Studies. The gallery will showcase the work of local artists and occasional Latino exhibitions. The gallery opens with a showing of the work of Latina painter Carmen Lomas Garza. an Arizona artist whose work speaks of the Chicano experience in America. 
South Bend residents have responded positively to the new office. "Having the Office in an accessible, downtown location is more than symbolic," Rucker said. "It gives us an opportunity to be on their turf, and for that they know that we are serious about being a real part of the community."

In San Diego County, the state's largest fire claimed another victim when a fire­fighting crew was over­come by names. killing one and injuring three. It marked the first firefighter death since the series of blazes began last week and brought the total number of dead to 18. 
The hot, dry Santa Ana winds from the desert that had been whipping the fires into raging infernos eased, only to give way to stiff breezes off the ocean that pushed the names up the canyon walls around evacuated resort towns like Lake Arrowhead and Big Bear, east of Los Angeles. 
By early afternoon, homes were burning in the mountain community of CedarPines Park. 
"There's fire on so many fronts, it's not even man­ageable at this point," said Chris Cade, a fire preven­tion technician with the 
U.S. Forest Service. as he watched a pillar of smoke he estimated at 9,000 feet rise into a hazy sky thick with ash. "I am at a loss what you can do about it." 
The fires have burned more than 620,000 acres and destroyed 1,800 homes. More than 12,000 firefighters and support crew were fighting what Gov. Gray Davis said may be the worst and costliest disaster California has ever faced. He estimated the cost at $2 billion so far. 

The fires, which began last week, burned in a bro­ken arc across Southern California, from Ventura County east to Los Angeles County and the San Bernardino Mountains and south to eastern San Diego County. 
On Southern California's other major front, about 100 fire engines encircled the historic mining town of Julian in the mountains of eastern San Diego County, hoping to save the popular weekend getaway commu­nity renowned for its vine­yards and apple orchards. 
However, some two dozen engines and water tenders that were headed to Julian were forced to turn back when flames swept over a highway. And as the winds picked up, floating embers sparked spot fires near the town of 3,500, forcing some crews to retreat. 
South of Julian, about 90 percent of the homes had been destroyed in Cuyamaca, a lakeside town of about 160 residents. Charred cows lay by the side of the road and hous­es were reduced to little more than stone entry­ways. 
"Everything's kind of happening all at once. These fires are trying real­ly hard to tie in with each other," said Bill Bourbeau, a forest safety officer. "It's tremendous." 
San Diego County fire officials feared a 233,000­acre fire and the 50,000­acre blaze would merge into a huge. single blaze that would make it nearly impossible to keep it from reaching Julian. 
Officials in San Diego County -where most of the deaths took place ­predicted the death toll would rise after investiga­tors began scouring devas· tated neighborhoods. 
A crew of U.S. Forest Service Hot Shots outside Julian was given an omi­nous warning by their team leader: If they came across any human remains, they were to cor­don off the area until a medical examiner could get in. 
"If we find somebody in the brush who took off running or whatever," Capt. Fred Brewster told' his 19-member team. "Who knows what you're going to find up there? It's a giant mess." 
In the San Bernardinos, the cool. moist ocean breezes confounded fire­lighters. just as the desert winds did over the week­end. Heavy winds kept air­craft grounded in the area, and winds gusting to 60 mph pushed flames up from the mountain slopes into the dense forest. The breezes were moving at a rate of quarter mile per minute. 
"They turned around with the wind and the fuel and basically overran us," San Bernardino County Fire Division Chief Mike Conrad said. 

COLOMBIA 


Air force chief warns drug pilots 
Associated Press 
BOGOTA -Colombia's new air force commander said Wednesday he would not hesitate to order suspect­ed drug flights shot down if they are tracked by U.S. and Colombian authorities and ignore warnings to land. 
President Bush in August author­ized the resumption of drug surveil­lance flights over Colombia. suspend­ed 2 1/2 years ago after a U.S. mis­sionary plane was mistakenly shot down over Peru. 
Under new guidelines, the com­mander of the Colombian air force must give the order to shoot down a suspicious plane if it has ignored radio warnings and warning shots from Colombian warplanes. 
"I will give the order for them to shoot it down," Gen. Edgar Lesmez said in an exclusive interview with The Associated Press. 
"These procedures are estab­lished," Lesmez said, adding that the pilots of drug flights "are violating the sovereignty of the country, com­mitting a crime and violating norms that are laid out in Colombian air manuals." 
Lesmez said he has not been called on to order the shoot-down of a drug flight in mid-air since the U.S. flights resumed, but has ordered several aircraft destroyed after they landed at clandestine airstrips in Colombia. 
In a m·emo released in August, Bush said he had determined that the surveillance flights are necessary and can be done without undue risk to civilian air traffic in Colombia. 
The United States immediately halted its participation in the inter­diction program flights after a Peruvian fighter jet acting on U.S. intelligence shot down the mission· ary plane in April 2001, killing American Veronica Bowers and her daughter, Charity. Investigators said procedural errors. language prob· lems and inadequate Peruvian air control caused the mistake.

I said, 'Are you related to that guy?' She said, 'That's my dad,"' Nishnic recalled. "That guy" was John Demjanjuk, the Ohio mechanic accused of being a Nazi death camp guard so sadistic that he was nicknamed Ivan the Terrible. The encounter led to marriage and launched Nishnic on a 20 year odyssey to clear his father­in-law's name. Through that time, he has learned to write legal briefs, donned a bullet proof vest on an airplane because of death threats and comforted Demjanjuk in an Israeli prison 
cell as gallows were being built outside. 
Nishnic's mission is far from over. Israel's Supreme Court cleared Demjanjuk of the Ivan the Terrible accusation in 1993, but the U.S. government has accused him of serving as a guard at other Nazi camps and stripped him of his U.S. citizen­ship last year. 
Nishnic, 48, sees the two decades he has devoted to defending his 83-year-old father­in-law as something he had to do. 
"I don't believe God will ever give you more than you can handle," he said. 
Nishnic has traveled to Russia, Ukraine, Australia, western Europe and elsewhere in his quest to clear Demjanjuk's name. He has helped raise money for legal fees, investigat­ed leads and been Demjanjuk's public voice.

U.S. extends Halliburton contract 
WASHINGTON -Vice President Dick Cheney's former company will retain a no-bid contraet in Iraq longer than expected, the Bush administration said Wednesday. blaming sabotage of oil facilities for delays in replace­ment contracts. 
Halliburton's contract, worth $1.59 billion so far. will be extended until December or January while the government receives and evaluates revised bids for replacement work that could total $2 billion. 
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which administers the oil industry rehabilitation, already has received competitive bids for replacement contracts, and hoped to announce the winners this month. 

Judge tosses suits against Merrill 
NEW YOHK -A federal judge tossed out eight lawsuits Wednesday that sought to hold Merrill Lynch & Co. responsible for investor losses during the Internet stock bubble. 
'The burst of the bubble and the attendant market chaos are not chargeable" to the banking giant, U.S. District Judge Milton Pollack wrote. He found no evidence Merrill Lynch had intended to defraud its investors, and he said the stock market was well aware of conflicts by analysts and potential rating problems while the Internet stocks were declining. 
"We are pleased with the judge's ruling today." Merrill spokesman Mark Herr said.

Stocks rise on earnings news 
AT&T-BellSouth merger uncertain; Boeing shares soar as profits beat estimates 
Associated Press 

NEW YORK -Wall

Crude futures tumble on NYMEX 
Associated Press 

NEW YORK -Crude oil futures fell 2 percent Wednesday, to a level not seen since September, following release of mostly bearish weekly gov­ernment and industry petroleum inventory reports. 
Analysts and traders cited a spate of refinery problems Tuesday and strong demand for November-deliv­ery gasoline futures in New York as factors preventing crude and heating oil prices from falling more sharply. 
However, that support might be shallow. 
Market participants pointed out that the November products contracts on the New York Mercantile Exchange expire at the end of trading Friday and added that December gasoline futures did not hold their value as well as November did. 
November gasoline futures settled 

0.12 cent higher at 83.13 cents a gal­lon after touching a high of 85.50 cents. The December contract settled 
0.91 cent at 80.29 cents a gallon after hitting an intraday high of 83.25 cents. 
Peter Beutel, an analyst with Cameron Hanover, said he expected to see more across-the-board selling because of the inventory data. The reports showed crude stocks, distil­late stocks -which include heating oil -imports and refinery runs all growing for the past week. 
"When they all rise in the same week, it's hard to get bullish," Beutel said. "That to me is a pretty bearish combination here at the end of October." 
The reports showed gasoline stocks sharply lower. 
Light, sweet December crude oil futures settled 65 cents lower at $28.91 a barrel after touching a low of $28.80. Prices have not been below $29 since near the end of September. 
On London's International Petroleum Exchange, December Brent blend crude oil futures settled 60 cents lower at $27.44 a barrel after touching a low of $27.41. 
"This is something of a nervous market here," Beutel said. "It drifts around under its own steam, and then all of a sudden it decides to move violently one way or another."

DePalma made it back to New York and was able to participate in the Times' subsequent cover­age of the attacks, an experience which he said was an example of the cyclical nature of journalism.

However, DePalma cautioned new reporters eager to break into the field against the impulse to sacrifice some of their integrity in the process. Citing the example of ex-New York Times reporter Jayson Blair, DePafma said that "as a journalist, you have to be very careful about your reputa­tion -one serious misstep can bring it all down." 
He closed with advice about persistence and payoff. 
"Journalism requires sustain­ing effort over a period of time and sustaining it in a different way from other professions. In journalism it's tough slogging all the way through," he said. 
"You won't be rewarded with a big salary or a big office. But you will be rewarded with the oppor­tunities to ask questions and to jump in and out of people's lives in an infinite variety of settings."

Networks prepare for sweeps 
AS>ocitcd Press 
NEW YOH K -If Honald Beagan, Jessica Lynch, Elizabeth Smart, Britney Spnars and Andy GrilTith can't save the television networks this season, maybe nothing can. 
The November "sweeps" get under way Thursday, offering the major broadcast networks ·a chance to start again. The season opening felt like a false start. 
ABC, CBS, NBC, the WB and UPN -live of the six biggest networks -have lost audience this season compared to 2002 and, what is more important, lost the younger viewers that advertisers crave. The one gainer is Pox, due entirely to a stellar baseball postseason. 
"The November sweeps can't get here a minute too soon, given the lackluster perform­ance of much of the networks' programming this season," said Ed Martin, programmin,g editor for The Myers Heport, a media economy newsletter. "Nothing has caught on and the only hope now is some ter­rilic sweeps programming to turn the lights back on and get people interested in televi­sion." 
Sweeps are the industry name for the three separate months during the season when ratings are monitored closely to set local advertising rates. Networks concentrate much of their best program­ming in these months. 
Because nobody has started strongly, it's one of the most important sweeps in years, said Steve Sternberg, an ana­lyst for the media buying lirm Magna Global USA. 
"It's hard to ligure out what's going on when you have the World Series and baseball postseason going so well com­bined with the fact that there's been nothing major coming out of the networks to get your attention," he said. 
CBS, like NBC probably hurt the most by baseball's strength, is cutting the highest profile over the next month. 
The network's four-hour miniseries, "The Reagans," set for Nov. 16 a.nd 18, already has fans of the former president nervous about how he will be portrayed. A conservative group has called for an adver­tiser boycott. 
It doesn't help that actor James Brolin [outspoken liber­al Barbra Streisand's husband] is cast as Honald Heagan. 
In further nostalgic appeals, CBS airs a three-hour 75th anniversary special on Sunday and welcome Andy Griffith, Ron Howard, Don Knotts and Jim Nabors back to Mayberry for a reunion special Nov. 11. A similar reunion for Carol Burnett stunned the industry with its high ratings in November 2001. 
CBS and NBC engage in one of the most unusual, and per­haps destructive, ratings bat­tles on Nov. 9 when they pres­ent television movies about kidnap victim Smart (CBS) and former POW Lynch (NBC) at exactly the same time. 

It's one of Sternberg's pet peeves: networks program­ming as much to hurt rivals as to build audiences for them­selves. 
Besides the Lynch movie and music specials with Justin Timberlake and Shania Twain on Thanksgiving week, NBC is relatively stunt-free. Instead, 
·the network hopes to draw viewers with its original pro­gramming, with twists like Bob Newhart on "ER." 
NBC has suffered this season 
· because some old reliables, like "Priends," have lost popu­larity. Although "Frasier" has rebounded in quality, if not in ratings, Martin said many of the critics he's talked to across the country are surprised at how the quality of writing has slipped for many returning shows on all networks. "People are scratching their heads," he said. "What's with all this dead air?" _After methodically boosting its appeal among younger viewers, traditionally older­skewing CBS has been hurt more than any other network by a puzzling viewership decline among young people, particularly men. Networks have grumbled that it's the fault of the messenger, Nielsen Media Research. Sternberg suggests they look in the mirror instead. Few of the new programs appeal to young men, he said.

British Conservatives oust party leader 
Associated Press 
LONDON -Lawmakers in Britain's opposition Conservative Party ousted leader lain Duncan Smith in a no-confidence vote Wednesday, and party officials began to unite around a possible succes­sor in hopes of averting a frac­tious leadership battle. 
Former Cabinet minister Michael Howard emerged as a favorite to replace Smith when another possible contender, for­mer party chairman David Davis, said he would not seek the leadership and would sup­port Howard. 
The party's trade spokesman, Tim Yeo, also considered a likely candidate, also urged Howard to run as did other party officials. 
Whoever becomes the Tory leader would likely be the main opponent to Prime Minister Tony Blair of the Labor Party in the next national election. 
Howard, 62, is a respected veteran lawmaker who served as home secretary, Britain's top law enforcement official, under former Prime Minister John Major. When he held the post, from 1993 to 1997. crime dropped 15 percent. 
Howard, a Welsh-born son of a Romanian Jewish immigrant, believes strongly in the free market and private enterprise and is wary of closer British involvement in the European Union. 
He has not announced that he will stand as a possible succes­sor to Smith, but several party officials have urged him to run and expect him to announce his candidacy on Thursday. 
Party officials are eager to avoid a protracted, bloody lead­ership battle like those that have paralyzed the Tories in the past. The party has been riven by factionalism since the end of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's 11-year rule. 
"I have ... decided to stand aside from this contest in favor of Michael Howard, whom I believe will be well placed to unify the party and win the next election," Davis said. ''I'm doing this in the hope that we can unite around one candidate." 
Lawmakers voted 90-75 against Duncan Smith, who failed to unite the once-mighty party in his two years at its helm. 
"The parliamentary party has spoken ... and I will stand down as leader when a successor has finally been chosen," Duncan Smith said in a brief statement. "I will give that leader my absolute loyalty and support whoever it is." 
Besides Howard, others cited as possible leadership con­tenders include the party's deputy leader Michael Ancram and chairman Theresa May. 
Sir Michael Spicer, the Conservative official who announced the outcome, said nominations for leadership can­didates would be accepted until Nov. 6, with the first round of voting Nov. 11. 

Conservative lawmakers will hold a series of ballots, each time knocking out the candidate with the fewest votes. The final two contenders will then face off in a nationwide ballot of party members, after campaigning across the country. 
Duncan Smith was elected party leader in 2001, after the Tories suffered a second crush­ing election defeat at the hands of Blair's Labor Party. 
Duncan Smith surprised many by leading the traditionalist Tories in a moderate direction. 
He appointed the party's first female chairman, supported a Tory lawmaker who disclosed he was gay, and sought to make the party more inclusive by attracting more women, ethnic minorities and young people. 
He also managed to gloss over the party's divisions on Britain's involvement in the European Union, and forged ahead with new policies on improving pub­lic services. 
But Duncan Smith failed to inspire discipline and loyalty, and many lawmakers sniped about his lack of charisma. Regarded as a stilted and wood­en speaker, he rarely fared well against Blair in their weekly showdowns in the House of Commons. Howard is reputedly the only man on the Conservative front bench that the prime minister respects as an orator. 

Solar flare causes potent particle storm 
Associated Press 

DENVER -The most pow­erful geomagnetic storm possi­ble walloped the Earth early Wednesday. knocking out some airline communications but apparently causing no large power outages or other major problems. 
The storm, the most disrup­tive to hit Earth since 1989, was unleashed by the fourth­most powerful solar flare ever seen, NASA said. 
The gigantic cloud of highly charged particles hurled from the sun posed a threat to elec­tric utilities, high frequency radio communications, satel­lite navigation systems and television broadcasts. Continued turbulence on the sun remains a concern for the next week, space forecasters say. 
The biggest immediate effect was the blackout of high-fre­quency voice-radio communi­cations for planes flying far northern routes. 
But airliners in an emer­gency could still communicate through VHF contact with another aircraft or military monitoring station, said Louis Garneau, a spokesman for the company that handles Canada's civil aviation naviga­tion service. 
British controllers were keeping trans-Atlantic jets on more southerly routes than usual to avoid the problem. 
The particle storm, measur­ing 13 times larger than Earth, was rated a G5, the highest intensity on scientists' scale of space weather. Space observers have measured G5 storms five times· in the past 15 years, but few of them have hit Earth so directly. 
It whipped through the solar system at about 5 million mph, taking just 19 hours to travel the 93 million miles from the sun to envelop the planet. Federal scientists said it col­lided with Earth's magnetic field at 1:13 a.m. EST on Wednesday, about 12 hours earlier than predicted. 
Last week, a weaker solar flare erupted on the sun's sur­face, but scientists said the particle cloud from that event largely spared the planet. 
Such storms pose no direct threat to people on the ground because the Earth's thick atmosphere deflects and absorbs incoming charged particles. But the storm may produce colorful auroras in the northern night sky visible as far south as El Paso, Texas, beginning late Wednesday. 
The last time a G5 storm hit Earth was in 1989, which damaged the power grid and caused electrical blackouts in the Canadian province of Quebec.

Indiana hotneless tnan receives allllost $2,000 
Associated Press 
COLUMBUS, Ind. -A home­less man who turned in an envelope stuffed with nearly $2,000 in cash will receive the money because no one came forward to claim it. 
Dana Hughes, who described himself as a drifter from Virginia, was walking through Columbus on Oct. 17 when he found the $1,956 in a bank envelope on the sidewalk out­side the Bartholomew County treasurer's office. 
Bather than walking away with the money, he went inside and gave it to Treasurer Vernon Jewell. 
The treasurer had set a Tuesday deadline for someone to come forward prepared to provide an accurate description of the money and the envelope in which it was found. 
Jewell said two people had tried to claim it, but both were rejected because of inaccurate information. 
Hughes was at his sister's home in Dell, Okla., on Thesday when he was told that the money belonged to him. 
"I never dreamed no one would claim that money," he told The Republic newspaper for a story Wednesday. 
Hughes said he started Oct. 17 with only 25 cents in his pockets, but never thought about keeping the envelope of cash. 
"I was scared," he said. "I was afraid of what people might do if they saw somebody like me carrying around all that money. I also figured it might belong to some little old lady who needed it a lot more than I did." 
He ended the day boarding a bus to Oklahoma thanks to an Edinburgh coupie and Jewell, who saw him as an honest man. 
"He was dressed pretty shab­bily, but he didn't want anything for turning in the money," Jewell said. 
Hughes said he would use some of the cash to pay back the money for bus fare he was given by Charles Goff. owner of the Grandma Metz II restaurant in Edinburgh, and Goff's fiancee Paula Hancock. 
Hughes said Hancock opened the door of the diner and invited him to come in to warm up. He cleaned windows in exchange for breakfast and a bag of sand­wiches for his trip. 
"I can't wait to see those peo­ple because of all they did for me," Hughes said. 
He was walking around downtown Columbus while waiting for a bus when he found the money. 
"I was in tears after talking to him," Hancock said. "I just knew in my heart that he was real and there was no way he could be a fake." 
Hughes has gained plenty of attention in the city some 40 miles south of Indianapolis even though he was only there for a few hours. 
"Everywhere I go, people are talking about him," Jewell said. "It's like his honesty has restored faith in humanity. I was contacted by one fellow who wanted his address in Oklahoma so he could send him money, regardless of whether he was given the cash he had found." 


Congress boosts firefighting funds 
Legislators allot $2.9 billion to fight, prevent forest fires 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -With California's forests in flames, Congress gave fresh attention Wednesday to a plan that would allow more tree cutting on federal land 
nod to a compromise bill aimed at red.ucing future fire risks by allowing for expanded thinning of timber in 20 million acres of feder­al forests. Supporters of the bill said it would reduce the amount of underbrush and small trees that can turn a forest into a tinderbox.

"We could see widespread heavy logging of mature trees even in pristine road-less areas," Sen. Tom Harkin. D-Iowa, com­plained.

"This legislation is not a logging bill. This legislation would allow the brush to be cleared out and provide the first statutory protection of old growth forests and large trees," said Sen. Dianne Feinstein. D-Calif. 
The legislation calls for $760 million a year for for­est thinning activities with half of the money ear­marked for forests near developed areas. Some sen­ators said more money -as much as 70 percent ­should be funneled to forests near where people live because wildfires in such areas pose the greatest threat.

A different side of Father Poorman 

LETTER TO THE EDITOR 
Debating the 'Catholic vote' 
Let me address Peter Quaranta's charge, in his Oct. 29 col­umn, that pro-life Catholics who vote Republican do so on utili­tarian grounds. Although the fact that millions of innocent American children have been killed in the womb provides a compelling incentive to oppose abortion, there are many non­utilitarian reasons to vote Republican. 
Respecting the life of all human beings, especially the unborn. is the cornerstone of what it means to be pro-life. If you accept the Catholic premise that human personhood begins at concep­tion, then abortion must rank amongst the most heinous of crimes against humanity. It is the murder of the most defense­less and innocent people in our society. The Church's teaching on this issue is very clear. Human life must be respected and protected absolutely from the moment of conception. 
An intellectually honest Catholic should also carefully consid­er his or her position on the death penalty. However, the Church concedes, that "the traditional teaching of the Church does not exclude recourse to the death penalty, if this is the only possible way of effectively defending human life" (Cathechism, 2267). Reasonable people can disagree about whether capital punishment can be justified in modern society. However, one must acknowledge that the potential evil of killing a criminal convicted of the most brutal crimes pales in comparison to the egregiousness of murdering innocent per­sons through abortion. A good Catholic prays for an end to both of these practices. But, given the choice between two evils, cap­ital punishment is by far the lesser. 
Quaranta is right in encouraging Catholics to support candi­dates who consistently uphold Christian teaching. In the mean­time, we should not throw our vote away on obscure third­party candidates who have no chance of winning. Instead, we should vote for candidates who will promote, however imper­fectly, the culture of life. our vote may not mean the difference between heaven and hell, but it is certainly a matter of life and death.

Times
to bridge the dispari­ty between personal and public percep­tions of our vice president of student affairs. 
Poorman was studying English at the University of Illinois when he felt the call to the priesthood. He enrolled in Notre Dame's Masters of Divinity Program and appreciated the tremendous people of the Congregation of the Holy Cross and its integration of the intellectual and spiritual life. He has been a resident assistant and assistant rector but has many great mem­ories, in particular from his time as the rector of Dillon Hall. He later earned a Ph.D in Christian Ethics from the Graduate Theological Union at Berkeley and returned to Notre Dame to hold vari­ous teaching and advisory positions. He gladly accepted University President Father Edward Malloy's invitation in 1999 to be vice president of student affairs. 
Poorman works with 27 rectors and 10 directors overseeing departments such as Campus Ministry. Health Services, Campus Security and Career Services. He calls administration "the art of the possi­ble." One must wade through numerous constraints to discern the best decisions. His work involves less controversy than many may think. In reality, he is thankful that he can work with the students, which he considers "an incredible privilege." 
He thoroughly enjoys teaching and praises his students as bright, motivated, value-oriented individuals. Students recip­rocate his praise through high, online pro­fessor ratings. Poorman also treasures performing alumni marriages and bap­tisms, which he said he does more than all the campus priests. 
He also cherishes the residential life. Alumni usually ask each other two ques­
tions -when they graduated and what dorm they lived in: "I love that," Poorman says. He esteems Notre Dame's unabashed and pervasive Catholic charac­ter. In particular, he values working with the "outstanding, extremely dedicated, professional, student-oriented and serv­ice-driven" rectors and department direc­tors. 
He also has high aspirations for stu­dents. "I want people here to catch fire intellectually," he said. He doesn't want students to be too content just hanging out and letting opportunities pass by during their short time here. He wants alumni 
to be Catholic leaders in their student life and was a popular various fields who have a guy. He has kept in contact keen sense of responsibil­with a few of the girl­ity for people who are friends he had as a stu­less privileged. In par­dent, even baptizing ticular, he would like some of their chil­more students to dren. enlist in the fields of Janice noted scholarship. While Poorman's personal many do pursue kindness in family professional train­life. She is a single ing, he wants more mother who has two students to pursue daughters adopted advanced education from China. Uncle Mark with Ph.D. aspirations. visits her daughters every 
Poorman's many respon­week to play with them. He sibilities have not precluded organized a trip to the Notre 
numerous personal encounters. While living in Grace Hall, he had to tell a fresh­man that his father had died after an acci­dent on the way home from Freshmen Orientation. He invited the RA and fresh­men in his section to get away from the move-in mayhem and come together at the Morris Inn. The guys dropped what they were doing and stayed up until 6 
a.m. to mourn with the student. 
Notre Dame life has also had its gags, mostly from Poorman's 4A section in Keough Hall. I ventured up to 4A to see what they really thought of their neigh­borly administrator and was led to two guys working in the Keough kitchen who live near him. When Poorman would come home after a long day, they'd run out, greet him like an old friend, then pro­ceed to rampage in his room. 
They'd jump around, eat his cookies and pretend to make important phone calls to Father Theodore Hesburgh: "Yeah, Ted, how you doing?" Poorman would kindly entertain them before bidding them good night. Sometimes guys in 4A could con­vince him to get "Reeked" with them at Reekers. They would want to live in no other section without Poorman. 
4A had good reports of this administra­tor. I wondered if it could all be true. I called his sister, Janice Poorman. who works in the Masters of Divinity Program. I asked about Poorman before his min­istry. "He was considered a heartthrob," she says. They called him Father What-A­Waste. Some girls were very sorry that he 
joined the priesthood. He was active in 
Dame Fire Department for their day care and put each kid in the flre engine. Janice wants students to see Poorman as a very kind family man who genuinely keeps others interests at heart. 
While some students may disagree for valid reasons, Poorman and many of the administrators act with special regard for the students. They model a lifestyle that integrates intellectual, spiritual and pro­fessional living. But most importantly, they maintain personal relationships that show the heart and soul that is leading the University under Mary's watchful eye.

Questioning assumptions about Catholics 
GUEST COLUMN 
Focus on commibnent in gay marriage issue 
The debate.about homosexual marriage is one that has been going on for years and one which will probably continue to be debated for many more. Even once the Supreme Court makes its inevitable ruling sometime in the future, the debate Richard is not likely to end. 
Friedman 

Right now, what needs to be done is to be sure that peo­Guest ple know the cur­Columnist 
rent research 
results and about research that is not from biased sources. 
One interesting thing about many argu­ments against homosexual marriage are their heavy usage of statements released from the Vatican. While recognizing the importance of these statements to Catholics, a large part of what this country was founded on was a separation of church and state. Obviously there is going to be a large overlap between morals expressed by the Church and the laws pre­sented by our government, but at the same time we as a country cannot resort to mak­ing laws based on what one religion might say in regards to a certain issue. This is exactly the issue that the Supreme Court faced when it struck down sodomy laws earlier this year. 
Looking at other points, it can be seen that they are similarly flawed. To begin, the possibility of adoption all but destroys any argument that marriage is about rais­ing children and helping build our future and therefore homosexuals are naturally excluded. Large numbers of children in the United States and overseas are waiting to be adopted by loving parents and to deny them this possibility based on old, faulty research is simply wrong. 
To say that good parenting requires two parents of opposite sexes would mean that we would also have to question and then deny single parent households the right to raise children. It would also be going against much of the current research that has repeatedly shown that if a child is able to establish secure attachments with his parents and is reared in a loving and sup­portive environment, he will develop in a normal and healthy manner, regardless of the sex of the people providing that warmth to him. 
I would also like to try to provide some insight into the research often pre­sented from the National Association for Research and Therapy of Homosexuals. While on the surface NARTH may seem like a legiti­mate organization, further investigation shows that they describe themselves as "a non-profit, educa­tional organization dedi­cated to affirming a com­plementary, male-female model of gender and sexual­ity." Not exactly an t,mbiased source. 

More research reveals that in NARTH is a tiny organization that in 1997 had a board of six officers and few other advanced degree members. The American Psychological Association, however, has over 121,000 members and is considered to be the world's leading organization on psychiatric issues. NARTH and other simi­lar organizations have been leading the fight against homosexual marriages and adoption for the past few years while organizations such as the APA have been in favor of both. 
A final question is why the focus of much of the debate on homosexual marriage centers on sexual activity; not the love, legal benefits, medical decision powers or public and private expression of a long­term commitment to each other that mar­riage also provides. When I hear that a male and a female have gotten married those are the things about which I think ­never is it immediately about how or if they are having sex and what the possible outcomes of that may be. 
Along these same lines comes the point raised about promiscuity amongst homo­sexuals. To fully understand the statistics 
they presented, we need to look at both sides and recognize that in the '90s there was one divorce for every two mar­
riages. That's not exactly a great success rate for heterosexuals either, 
especially considering that that was with all the benefits of mar­riage and the losses attributed with legal divorce. "Gay unions" generally have none of these 
things, so it is not sur­prising they end much easier. It is also ques­tionable what those stud­ies considered a steady homosexual relationship as that is much harder to define 

without having the standard socie­ty-understood terms that heterosexuals enjoy. 
Overall, the case against legal gay mar­riage is built on rather shaky grounds. t goes against the idea of separation of church and state as well as itself trying to specifically target a group of citizens and deny them several rights allowed to others. The often repeated defenses for such a stance fall apart when recent, unbiased research is considered and when people realize that allowing two males to marry does not affect a male and a female mar­riage in any way. As long as there is love and commitment in both cases, both are following the same ideals and neither in any way harms the other.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR 
Diversity 
matters 
In regards to Matt Bramanti's Oct. 28 column, "Diversity doesn't matter," he states the following: "''m a white guy. Knowing that, what can you figure out about me?" What I can figure out about you is this: you have never been discrimi­nated against. Neither have I. However, the idea behind the affir­mative action law was that it pro­tects people from the closed-mind­ed racism that existed in the United States at the time the law was writ­ten. Here's a shocker, bigotry still exists, and it will continue to exist. 
This is a sad fact to be sure. One would think that in this enlightened period in human history we could move beyond such intolerance. But we have not. The common com­plaint is that affirmative action puts less qualified people into a job sim­ply because of the fact that they possess minority status. The truth of the matter is that affirmative action protects all workers, white and black. 
What happens when a factory manager hires a white man who is less qualified than a black man competing for the same job simply because he is white? In such a case, affirmative action protects everyone working at the factory. In conclusion, instead of speaking of how neutral diversity is, try looking at the matter from someone else's 
perspective ­ a little empathy goes  
a long way.

political organisms that want to win, do not waste their time with to these people. If we followed Quaranto's suggestion, Catholics would, in terms of their political power, commit mass suicide. 
Following this, Quaranto suggests that we should present a uniquely Catholic candidate that follows Church teaching and doctrine. There are a couple of problems here. The Church does not have an author­itative teaching or doctorine on many political issues other than abortion. We are a very large body that encompasses numerous religious traditions and a wide range of political thought. For Quaranto, though, this may not matter, as the phrase, "Church 
that Catholics would try to destroy the boundaries between church and state. Quaranto would play into their hands. 
Quaranto fails to acknowledge the reality that other groups exist in society besides Catholics. In politics, it is necessary to build coalitions between these diverse groups and to compromise. Thus, Catholics are destined to disagree with some element or another of a candidate's platform. In a society of hundreds of millions of people, no candidate will be perfectly acceptable to each person. Our group is no different. 
Quaranto mistakes this necessary compromise for utilitarianism. But when we do not completely agree with either party, don't we have to assess the rela­tive benefits and drawbacks of each candidate? Using language associated with concerns of "utility" does not automatically make us utilitarians. 
Quaranto confuses a type of political philosophy with a natural cost-benefit analysis that is necessary to almost every choice we make. 
I do not even know how to respond to Quaranto's claim that "Republicans remain committed generally to an anti-life agenda on other issues." This seems completely devoid of any attempt to even understand why Republicans hold the positions that they do, let alone any reasoned analysis of political issues. I doubt Republicans would call themselves anti-life. Probably most Democrats wouldn't use that label either. It seems perfectly appropriate, though, for a far-left Catholic demagogue to say something like this. 
Finally, for all his talk of faithfulness to Catholicism, Quaranto manages to betray his faith by arrogating for himself the power of God. And though my mind is incapable of fathoming the Lord's divine wisdom, I surely hope that He will not condemn us for one day at the polls. "Judge not, lest you be judged," seems a lesson that was lost on Quaranto. 
I suggest that before Quaranto write another of his columns condemning the rest of campus for not join­ing campus activities like Peace Calition, Pax Christi or the Progressive Social Alliance, he spend some time trying to dislodge the wooden beam from his eye.

Glee Club returns hom_e 
The internationally-enjoyed singing group has its fall concert 
this weekend at Washington Hall 
By JON RETARTHA Assisranr Scene Ediror 
The weather may be getting colder. but the Notre Dame Glee Club is just getting warmed up for its Fall Concert weekend. This group of about sixty male perform­ers has already taken the South by storm, spending fall break touring Georgia, Tennessee, South Carolina, Illinois and Pennsylvania, and now they are gearing up for their return to South Bend on Thursday and Friday. 
The Glee Club has a rich tradition in music at the University, spanning eighty­eight years and 2,000 participants. The group is particularly known for its close­knit membership, with many members choosing to live together both on and off campus. The Glee Club also has a very strong Alumni club, as was seen earlier in the football season as dozens returned to sing on the field during the annual Glee Club Alumni Weekend. 
Known as "the musical ambassadors of Notre Dame," these young men tour the country and the world while also dedicating their time to developing and strengthening their talents while not performing. This dedication stems from a shared love for music, as is seen in the variety of different performances they put on each year, with audiences from four to 4,000. They have four premier performances each year -one in the fall, one for Christmas, one in the spring and one for Commencement. Some of their smaller performances include events on home football weekends and at freshman orientation activities. Their attire also mirrors their performances, ranging from polo shirts and khakis to bow ties and tails. 
The men of the Notre Dame Glee Club tour many parts of the country, includ­ing many Southern states, New England and the Midwest. They tour twice a year and hit anywhere from seven to ten engagements in a tour. In addition to the American tours, they travel abroad every two years. Their most recent tour, in the summer of 2003, included book­ings in Italy, Austria, the Czech Republic, Germany, Switzerland, France, Spain and Ireland. The 2001 tour traveled through Bangkok, Singapore, Shanghai, Beijing, Hong Kong and Taipei. They have also toured the Middle East as well. 

Before all this jet setting and fame can materialize, however, a prospective member must go through the audition process. Many of the members are quick to point out, though, that the audition is not the spotlight on a dark, empty stage that many would imagine. Nor are the judging members Simon Cowell impersonators. Most auditions are held in the fall, at the beginning of the year, but some may be held at mid­year if the numbers warrant it. The audition process is very informal, and all male members of the Notre Dame community are welcome to try out, regardless of experience. As their club Web site points out, "singing in the shower is documentable singing experi­ence!" The audition itself does not even require prepared music, but is rather a chance for the director, Dan Stowe, to simply get a feeling for the ability of the applicant in regards to matching a pitch or holding a tune. The ability to read music is not required. The second aspect of the audition process is an interview with several glee club members. 
The Glee Club has a repertoire rich in Notre Dame Tradition. Some of the songs that make their way frequently into per-formances include the "Victory March," the "Alma Mater," "Hike Notre Dame," "Irish Backs," "On Down the Line" and "Notre Dame We Hail Thee." They also specialize in many Irish classics, such as "My Wild Irish Rose," "Loch Lomond," "Danny Boy" and "Clancy Lowered the Boom." Several spiritual tunes are favorites of the Glee Club as well, includ­ing "Got a Mind to Do Right" and "Swing Down Chariot." 

All of these years of performing these classic songs have given birth to an extensive recording career for the Notre Dame Glee Club. Their latest release, In Dulci Jubilo, exhibits many of the Christmas tunes performed in during the holiday season by the club. Their album Under the Dome mirrors their fall and spring performances, with mixtures of classical songs and Notre Dame Traditions. Shake Down the Thunder is the collection of Notre Dame Fight songs performed by the Glee Club. Finally, Music from the Basilica highlights many Renaissance pieces performed in Glee Club concerts. 
Much of the broadening of the club's collection of music is attributed to Stowe, who is entering his tenth year at Notre Dame. After doing graduate work at the University of Southern California and Cornell University, he went on to conduct the U.C. Davis Chorus, Chamber Singers and Early Music Ensemble, as well as the Cornell University Chorale. He also serves as the Notre Dame Orchestra conductor. 
The Glee Club is ready to embark on another exciting year of concerts at Notre Dame. With music that everyone will enjoy, this Halloween weekend is the perfect time to experience one of Notre Dame's unique treasures. Performances are Thursday and Friday at 8 p.m. in Washington Hall. Tickets may be pur­chased at the door or at the LaFortune box office. The Thursday performance is free of charge, and the Friday perform­ance is $3.00.

Under this agree­ment, U.S. Cellular will sponsor "NDPresents: LIVE at the Morris." The series will celebrate music and the arts through three performances -The Suzanne Farrell Ballet, La Boheme and Cirque Eloize, taking place· at the Morris Performing Arts Center throughout the coming months. 
"This series at the Morris is a fine example of how public/private sponsor­ships with South Bend and Notre Dame ean benefit the entire community," said South Bend Mayor Stephen Luecke. "It is my great pleasure to welcome U.S. Cellular to South Bend and thank them for their significant commitment to our community." 
"We greatly appreciate U.S. Cellular's support of this program that benefits students and residents alike," said John Haynes, Judd and Mary Lou Leighton director of performing arts for Notre Dame and executive director of the Marie P. DeBartolo Center for the Performing Arts. "We look forward to enhancing our relationship with U.S. Cellular in the future as the university expands its involvement in the perform­ing arts." 
On Monday, U.S. Cellular, which will offer wireless service to northern Indiana starting Nov. 1, presented Notre Dame with a check for $15,000 to co­sponsor the new series. 
"On behalf of Notre Dame, we know that this is the beginning of a long rela­tionship with U.S. Cellular that benefits both the residents of the South Bend area as well as Notre Dame students," Haynes said. 
Tuesday night, the first of the three events took place at the Morris Performing Arts Center -The Suzanne Farrell Ballet. It was a beautiful event with amazing and talented dancers. They lit up the stage with elaborate cos­tumes and graceful, poetic movements throughout the four-part ballet. The men and women of the company include principal dancers Jennifer Fournier, Chan lion Gob, Natalia Magnicaballi, Peter Boal and Runqiao Du. 
They danced "Divertimento No. 15" by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, the "Pas de Deux" from Swan Lake by Peter Ilyich Tchaikovsky, "Tempo di Valse" from The Nutcracker by Tchaikovsky and "Serenade" by Tchaikovsky. 
In 1993 and 1994, in order to fulfill a mission to enhance the arts education of America's young people, the Education Department of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts offered two series of ballet master classes for students from metropolitan Washington and Baltimore with the leg­endary Suzanne Farrell. 
This series provided intermediate to advanced-level ballet students the opportunity to study with one of the greatest ballerinas of the 20th century. Due to the uniqueness of Farrell's place in the ballet world and the quality of her teaching, the Kennedy Center enlarged the program to a national level in 1995. This intensive three-week pro­gram, Exploring Ballet with Suzanne Farrell, takes place each summer and has just finished its 11th session. 
In the fall of 1999, Farrell took cues from the masters of ballet with whom she danced, admired and inspired to present The John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts special production for the Millennium Season, Suzanne Farrell Stages the Masters of 20th Century Ballet. The works of George Balanchine, Jerome Robbins and Maurice Bejart took on a new life with Farrell and the grace of the company she selected for a five-week east-coast tour. 
In the fall of 2000, The Suzanne Farrell Ballet, now a full-fledged compa­ny and an ongoing project of the Kennedy Center, made its debut during the Kennedy Center's Balanchine Celebration performing "Divertimento No. 15."

tion of 'Divertimento No. 15' was rapt, lyric, gloriously unified in tone and filled with moments in which dancers were at thrilling risk, reaching beyond their capabilities they're certain of to become more than they or we dreamed they might be," Tobi Tobias of New York Magazine said. 
The company again performed in early 2001 at Seven Days of Opening Nights at Florida State University where, at the beginning of the 2000 academic year, Farrell accepted a tenured professorship in the Dance Department. 
That exclusive engagement included the company premiere of Balanchine's Variations for Orchestra. Prior to a northeast tour, The Suzanne Farrell Ballet opened the Kennedy Center's bal­let season in the fall of 2001 with nearly two weeks of performances in the Eisenhower Theatre -featuring no less than six company premieres. The com­pany was again seen at the Kennedy Center in the fall of 2002, performing, among other works, company premieres of Balanchine's "Chaconne," "Raymonda Variations" and "Who Cares?" as well as A Farewell to Music with Canadian cho­reographer Anthony Morgan. 
Following this extensive fall 2003 US tour that will, for the first time, take them to the West Coast, the company will open the Kennedy Center's 2003­2004 ballet season with a full week of performances in the Eisenhower Theater.

NBA 
Anthony has 12 points in Nuggets victory 
Associated Press "Despite the fact that it was contributions. I can't think of basket with 1:41 to go and Jeff up to a torrid final 12 minutes ugly offensively," Nuggets coach anybody that dido 't really con­Foster made a free throw with when the Jazz hit 13 of 16 shots. 
-
DENVER -Even after picking up two fouls less than two min­utes into the game and being hounded by one of the NBA's best defenders, Carmelo Anthony showed he belonged. 
Anthony had 12 points and seven rebounds in his NBA debut, helping lead the Denver Nuggets to an 80-72 win over the San Antonio Spurs on Wednesday night. 
"When people look at us, they are going to notice that we won our first game," said Anthony, who was limited to 4-for-15 shooting by Bruce Bowen. "They aren't going to look at how many points I had . .I don't care if I only average four points. I will be happy if we win. 
"I was a little anxious in the first half. I picked up the early fouls. In the second half I kept my composure and we won the game." 
Anthony, the third overall pick in the draft after leading Syracuse to the NCAA champi­onship as a. freshman, sustained a small cut near his right eye, courtesy of Bowen. 
"I think he wanted to make a statement, like, 'Hey, this isn't easy.' I don't know what he got me with. He's a top defender in the league, and I think I did a decent job." 
Bowen said Anthony "is a very talented player. I think as he gets older in this game he will settle down more and will be able to do things that other guys do that become Hall of Famers. 
"I thought he was a good play­er in college. I never thought him coming into the NBA would require a drastic step." 
Andre Miller added 16 points, Earl Boykins 13 and Nene 12 for the Nuggets, who overcame poor shooting to knock off the defend­ing NBA champions. 
Denver shot 29 percent from the field, compared to 27 percent for the Spurs. 
Tim Duncan had 17 points on 7-of-22 shooting and 21 rebounds for San Antonio, which opened its season Tuesday night with an 83-82 win over Phoenix. 
Jeff Bzdelik said, "it was a great win in front of a great crowd against a great opponent." 
Spurs coach Gregg Popovich was most concerned about his point-guard situation. Tony Parker and Shane Heal are injured, and Anthony Carter was able to play only 10 minutes because of patella tendinitis in his left knee. 
"It stiffened up on him," Popovich said. "It was bad enough in the first half where he was dragging his leg and couldn't move it. 
"We didn't have any point guards after that. We'll have to bring somebody in to make sure we have somebody there when our next game comes. We can't depend on Carter's knee right now." 
Celtlcs 98, Heat 75 
The Boston Celtics were better without Antoine Walker than Miami was without Lamar Odom. 
Paul Pierce scored 23 points and Boston made up for the absence of its longtime leader by placing six scorers in double fig­ure, opening the season with a victory over the Heat. 
Playing without Walker, who was traded nine days before the opener, the Celtics got 15 points apiece from Vin Baker and Eric Williams, 12 each from Mike James and Raef LaFrentz and 10 from Tony Battie. 
"You saw the emergence of a lot of guys," said Pierce, who played 35 minutes and was the only Celtic to play more than 28. "There are a number of guys who are going to be able to showcase their talents." 
Eddie Jones had 22 points and eight rebounds for-Miami, which was missing Odom. The center­piece of the Heat's offseason overhaul, Odom sprained his right ankle in the season opener on Tuesday, which Miami also lost.. 
"We knew they were banged up. We knew they were on a back-to-hack game, so we tried to do everything we could to take their legs out of it," Celtics coach Jim O'Brien said. "A lot of nice tribute." 

In recent years, Pierce and Walker have accounted for a big­ger share of their team's points than any other NBA duo except Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant. But Walker was dealt to Dallas along with Tony Delk for LaFrentz, Jiri Welsch and a first­round draft pick. 
The theory behind the trade was that subtracting Walker's sometimes dominating presence will get the others more involved in the game. 
"The ball is moving a lot better. They don't have one guy control­ling the ball," said Bimbo Coles, who finished last season with Boston and started this one with the Heat. 
"I see the trade benefiting the Celtics. Not taking anything away from Antoine, but there will now be more scoring for the other guys on the team." 
LaFrentz didn't start, but he played 28 minutes and added five rebounds and three blocked shots. 
But the most pleasant surprise for the Celtics was Baker, who left the team in the middle of last season to check into an alcohol rehab center. He started and scored the first Celtics basket of the season, getting the ball beneath the hoop and muscling past Brian Grant for a layup. 
Pacers 89, Pistons 87 
Rick Carlisle refused to gloat after be,ating the team that fired him. 
Jermaine O'Neal had 22 points and 15 rebounds as the Indiana Pacers held on for an victory over the Detroit Pistons, who got rid of Carlisle after two success­ful seasons. 
"It's not about me and it never will be," Carlisle said. "It's about this group of players, who played at a high level and with a lot of passion to earn this win against a good team." 
In the season opener for both clubs, Indiana led by 10 midway through the fourth quarter before a 13-2 run put Detroit ahead 87-86 with two minutes left. O'Neal scored a go-ahead 14.8 seconds remaining. 
Detroit's Chauncey Billups missed an 18-footer with 4.8 sec­onds left, and Mehmet Okur failed on a hurried 3-pointer just before the buzzer. 
Carlisle helped the Pistons win 100 regular-season games, two division titles and three playoff series the past two years, but it wasn't enough to save his job. 
"He didn't really talk much about it, but we knew in the back of his mind he really wanted to win this one," O'Neal said. 
Hall of Fame coach Larry Brown, who spent the past six seasons in Philadelphia, replaced Carlisle, who advanced past Brown and the 76ers in the sec­ond round of the playoffs. Carlisle succeeded fired coach lsiah Thomas in July after almost deciding to be a television ana­lyst this season. 
Carlisle was given a rousing ovation when he was introduced, and he responded with a wave to the fans at The Palace. He was expressionless as his eyes fol­lowed last season's Central Division banner raised to the rafters. 
Jazz 99, Trail Blazers 92 

The rebuilding Utah Jazz appear to have a good founda­tion so far. 
Playing a season opener with neither John Stockton or Karl Malone in the starting lineup for the first time in 17 years, the Jazz rallied from a 13-point third quarter deficit and beat the Portland Trail Blazers 99-92 Wednesday night. 
"We haven't done nothing yet. We've got 81 more to go. But we're going to surprise some people -like we did with those guys tonight," said Carlos Arroyo, who had 18 points and 13 assists in his second career start. 
Arroyo has the unenviable task of replacing Stockton, the NBA career leader for assists and steals who retired last summer. If Arroyo was uncomfortable tak­ing over for an icon, it didn't show. 
He calmly got the offense in sync in the third quarter, leading 
-"To tell you the truth, I wasn't nervous," said Arroyo, who was 7 -for-13 from the field. "I think this game let us know where we are at right now and let people know we're capable of winning some games." 
First-round draft pick Sasha Pavlovic made his first four shots and scored 16 in his NBA debut. Raja Bell, who signed with Utah as a free agent this summer. also had 16 points, including a 3­pointer that tied it and the go­ahead basket for a lead the Jazz never gave up. 
Tlmberwolves 95, Bucks 89 
Though many will be focused this season on Minnesota's new players, Kevin Garnett can never be ignored. 
Garnett had 25 points, 21 rebounds and six assists as the Timberwolves hung on to beat the Milwaukee Bucks 95-89 Wednesday night in the opener for two teams sporting a much different look. 
"I was definitely hyped," Garnett said. "The talent is there." 
Newcomers Sam Cassell (18 points). Latrell Sprewell (15 points) and Michael Olowokandi (11 points, nine rebounds) helped Garnett, as did holdover reserve Gary Trent (14 points). 
"That's what Spree and I are supposed to do, take the pres­sure off Kevin on both ends of the floor," Cassell said. 
Michael Redd and Desmond Mason each had 16 points for Milwaukee, playing its first game under rookie coach Terry Porter -hired to replace George Karl. 
The young Bucks trailed by 17 points late in the first half. but they climbed back in the third quarter to trim the lead to five. Toni Kukoc found Redd for a wide-open dunk at the buzzer to pull Milwaukee to 71-66. 
"You don't get nothing for fighting back," Mason said. 
The Bucks, who trailed the whole game, cut it to 87-85 on former Timberwolves forward Joe Smith's tip-in with 1:13 remaining after Garnett missed a jumper.

OLYMPICS 
IOC revievvs legality of rectroactive drug tests 
Associated Press 
LONDON -The IOC is look­ing into whether drug tests at the 2002 Salt Lake City Olympics can be rechecked for the recently discovered steroid TIIG, lOC medical director Patrick Schamasch said Wednesday. 
Lawyers for the International Olympic Committee arc study­ing the legality of retroactive tnsting of frozen urine samples taken to Los Angeles from the temporary Olympic drug-testing laboratory at the University of Utah's Hesearch Park. 
"Thn samples exist. Now we have to look into all the juridi­cal issues," Schamasch said in a tlllephone intervinw from IOC hnadquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland. 
"We are reviewing all these different issues, of course. Once we have all the information on the potential legal issues, my proposal will be to ask our president !Jacques Hogge!. and hn will decide." 
The IOC also is asking scien­tists if the frozen 19-month-old samples are viable. 
"We want to be sure that the quality of the sample is still good in order not to face any legal issue with a potential degradation," he said. "It's a very sensitive issue. 
Dr. Don Catlin, who heads the Olympic drug-testing laboratory at UCLA, where 200 to 300 samples from the 2002 Winter Games are stored, said in a telephone interview Wednesday that retesting is still possible for TIIG, a previously undetectable drug. 
The World Anti-Doping Agency has urged retesting of all stored samples worldwide. International track and field officials plan to retest 400 sam­ples from the world champi­onships in Paris in August. 
"Everybody around that has old samples is interested to know whether they could or should retest them for THG," Catlin said Wednesday. "There are a number of legal issues. They want to know if' the sam­ples arc stored under chain of custody. There arc a myriad of issues that arise." 
The JOC's doping rules only require drug testers to keep backup samples of positive tests for 90 days, while backups of negative tests must be kept for 30 days. 
Catlin's lab has samples from as far back as the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics, and retested them last year for testosterone levels. Such testing is done more to determine the stability of such samples over time. 

NFL 
Tuiasosopo to start for Raiders 
Associated Press 
ALAMEDA, Calif. Marques Tuiasosopo will start at quarterback for the Oakland Haiders on Sunday at Detroit in place of injured Hich Gannon. 
Gannon, the reigning NFL MVP, was listed as doubtful Wednesday with a shoulder injury. The Raiders still haven't said how severely the 37-year-old Gannon is hurt. 
Gannon was injured in the Raiders' 17-10 loss to Kansas City on Oct. 20 and hasn't thrown a pass since. 
The 24-year-old Tuiasosopo nearly rallied the Haidcrs (2­
5) to a comeback wiri against the Chief's, but fell just short when Tim Brown was tackled on the 1-yard line as time expired. Tuiasosopo was 16­for-28 for 224 yards after replacing Gannon. 
Tuiasosopo, a seldom-used backup in his third pro sea­
son after a stellar college career at Washington, has had extra time taking snaps with the first-team offense because the Haiders had their bye last week. 
"''m just fired up to be able to contribute to the team a little bit more and help us win a ballgamc," he said. ''I'm just going out there to try to have some fun and try to win. It's been a while. We need to get back on a win streak." 
MLB 
Maddux, Millwood file for free agency 
-
Associated Press 
NEW YOHK -Greg Maddux and Kevin Millwood, team­mates with the Atlanta Braves from 1997-2002, head the list of 16 players who filed for free agency Wednesday. 
Maddux's filing could signify the end of his 1 0-ycar relation­ship with the Braves. The 37­year-old righthander has been the anchor of a rotation that has helped produce an unprecedented 12 straight division titles. 
Maddux and the Braves 
nearly parted ways last winter before agreeing on a one-year, $14.75 million contract. 
While Maddux is expected to be among the most sought after frontline starters. the jury remains out on Millwood, who put together an erratic 2003 campaign for the Philadelphia Phillies. The 28­year-old righthander was 14­12 with a 4.01 ERA and threw a no-hitter on April 27. But he also failed to produce down the stretch for a team desper­ately needing an ace. 
Millwood made $9.9 million in 2003 and was hoping to 
land a big, multi-year con­tract. 
Other starting pitchers filing Wednesday were Pat llcntgen of the Baltimore Orioles, Kenny Hogers of the Minnesota Twins and Pedro Astacio of the New York Mets. 
Seattle Mariners All-Star closer Shigctoshi Hasegawa also filed. Coming oil' the best season ol' his career, Ilascgawa offers teams the llexibility of being able to set up or close. 
Wednesday's filings brought to 149 the numbers or players who have opted for free agency.

IN BRIEF 

Lemieux becomes sixth to 
reach I, 700 points 
PITTSBUHGH -Just like always. it was Mario Lemieux who got the rebuilding Pittsburgh Penguins going -this time. with his history-making 1.700th point. As usual, it was the other team that had the big finish. 
Lemieux became the sixth player in NIIL history with 1,700 points with an assist that started a four­goal run by Pittsburgh, but the New York Islanders scored twice in the third period for a 4-4 tic Wednesday night. 
"I thought we were going to win the way we played tho lirst two peri­ods," said Lemieux, who scored in his seventh straight game. "It's dis­appointing." 
Not necessarily to the Islanders, who are 9-1-1-3 in their last 14 games against Pittsburgh. 
"It's bad the way we played in !Pittsburgh's two-goal) second peri­od." Islanders goalie Garth Snow said. "But in the hole two goals in the third period and to come back and salvage a point, it's good." 
With the Islanders up 2-0 late in the first. Lemieux took Konstantin Koltsov's pass along the right wing boards, slipped the puck between the legs of defenseman Janne Niinimaa, then made a backhanded pass to the slot to Dick Tarnstrom for his second gqal of the season. 
"It's nice to get it out of the way," Lemieux said. "Sometimes when you're going for a milestone, you try to do too much." 
Lemieux joins Wayne Gretzky (2,857), Gordie llowc (1,850). Mark Messier (1,847), Marcel Dionne (1,771) and Carolina Hurricanes captain Hon Francis (1.760s) on the 1,700-point list. Only Gretzky reached the mark faster than Lemieux. 
Lemieux's exceptional play not only halted what was threatening to become another Islanders' rout of Pittsburgh, it was the first of the Penguins' four straight goals -a 
veritable flurry for a team that scored only four goals in its previous three games. Tho Penguins lost to the Islanders 7-2 Saturday night and are winless in four games (0·2-2).

NBA 

Bryant says he'll get along with Shaq 

API 

Shaqullle O'Neal and Kobe Bryant sit by each other In the Lakers opening game win over the Mavericks. Both players said they will get along and focus on a championship this season. 
Associated Press 
LOS ANGELES -Kobe Bryant insists he and Shaquille O'Neal will get along this season and do whatever it takes to help the Los Angeles Lakers win another NBA championship. 
Coach Phil Jackson fined Bryant an undisclosed amount for publicly criticizing O'Neal. and the team met for 20 minutes Tuesday to discuss the feud that has developed between the two players. 
"We don't see this as insur­mountable at all," Jackson said before the Lakers opened the season with a 109-93 victory over the Dallas Mavericks. 
"It's like a family feud," guard Gary Payton said. "You have it for an hour and it's over." 
Bryant was not in uniform Tuesday night after he said he didn't think his surgically repaired knee was strong enough to withstand the rigors of a 48-minute game. The Lakers had expected him to play until hearing otherwise Monday on ESPN. · 
Bryant said he hopes to return Saturday night in Phoenix. 
Bryant castigated O'Neal dur­ing a telephone interview with ESPN, calling him "childlike," "unprofessional," "selfiSh," "fat" and "jealous." He also accused the 7-footer of overstating the severity of his foot injury last season when he reported to training camp overweight. 
Bryant's comments came a day after O'Neal said the Lakers were "my team," adding that Bryant needed to be more of a team player -an observation based on two exhibition games. 
"We're cooL We talked this 
morning. He said what he said, I 
said what I said. We put it behind 
us," Bryant said after the Lakers' 
victory. "Shaq and I are going to 
move on, be teammates and help 
this team to a fourth title." 
Asked if he wanted to clarify 
his comments to ESPN, Bryant 
replied, "I don't have anything to 
clarify. I'm past it." 
O'Neal blamed the media for 
starting the controversy. 
"We don't really have issues," 
he told TNT after the game. 
"[Bryant) said something that 
was misconstrued and I said 
something that was miscon­
strued and we talked about it. 
Right now, we are going to play. 
We are just trying to win." 

One member of the Lakers said Tuesday morning's meeting last­ed about 20 minutes, with O'Neal and Bryant addressing the team but not each other. The only other player to speak was Karl Malone, the player said. 
"What we tried to do was not to overkill the situation," guard Derek Fisher said. "We all know it's there, we're aware of it, it's not necessarily going to go away just today, so we addressed it." 
At practice Monday, Jackson ordered the team not to discuss the dustup with .reporters. He fined Bryant for defying that order by talking to ESPN later that day. 
"We had an agreement, the agreement was broken," Jackson said. "We were really disappoint­ed." 
Bryant appeared on the court with about 15 seconds left in the third quarter after icing his knee and doing weight work. He was greeted by a loud ovation from the sellout crowd at Staples Center. They chanted "Kobe! Kobe!" and he raised his right hand in acknowledgment. 
One fan held up a homemade sign that read 'Can't we all just get along' with Bryant's and O'Neal's jersey numbers on it. 
Bryant sat next to O'Neal on the bench. O'Neal appeared to talk to Bryant while covering his mouth with his hand. Bryant responded without looking at O'Neal. 
Bryant described their conver­sation as "just clowning around, just silly stuff. I'm kind of a comedian sometimes." 
The conflict between O'Neal and Bryant has been simmering throughout their seven seasons together, but their public pot­shots have never been as person­al as the most recent ones. 
"All that's going on is not charted territory for us," Jackson said. "There's a lot involved in what's going on here." 
Adding to the tension for the team is the publicity brought by a sexual assault charge against Bryant. 
Bryant lashed out publicly after Jackson declined to get in the middle of the fight. 
BOXING 

De La Hoya decides he wants a rematch 
Associated Press 

NEW YORK -Oscar De La Hoya has changed his mind. 
Before fighting Sugar Shane Mosley last month, De La Hoya said he would retire if he lost. When Mosley beat him for the second time, lift­ing the WBA and WBC 154­pound titles, De La lloya said he wasn't interested in a third fight. 
Six weeks after losing the disputed decision, De La Hoya promised Wednesday to get back in the ring one more time with Mosley. 
"I'm definitely going to fight again, that's for sure," he said. "I will box again. There 
will definitely be ''I'm definitely tell the story, a rematch with tell it right and

into the unani­mous decision. He has since backed away from that. 
"I had a lot of response from fans who said, 'You were cheated. How can this happen?"' De La Hoya said. "A decision is a decision. They can be wrong at times. People make mistakes. Nobody's perfect. 
"I landed over 150 more punches and didn't get the decision. The public knows who really won. As long as the public knows who really won, that's all that matters." 
De La Hoya made the com­ments Wednesday during a news conference to introduce him as an Olympic boxing commentator for Telemundo Sports, the Spanish language network owned by NBC. He will also contribute to NBC's coverage of the Athens Games. 
Telemundo plans more than 130 hours of program­ming from Athens, the first 
exclusively non-English lan­guage Olympic broadcast in 
U.S. television history. It will be part of 806 1/2 hours of coverage from Athens. nearly double the 441 1/2 hours of NBC's coverage from Sydney in 2000. 
Broadcasting is a new experience for De La Iloy a, a five-time champion who recorded a pop music CD that was nominated for a Grammy in 2000 and formed his own boxing promotion company, Golden Boy Promotions. in 2001. 
"The strategy is to be hon­est with the viewer," he said. "You cannot cheat them. You have to be honest. That's

"I always wanted to go back to the Olympics as a spectator," he said. "Never in my wildest dreams did I think I would go as a com­mentator. It hits home. It touches my heart. This is a huge honor and I appreciate the opportunity." 
De La Hoya said he is con­centrating on his promotional company and wants to use it as a vehicle to change box­ing. 
"It takes time," he said. "To be able to correct a bad deci­sion, I think we need that. I feel I can make a difference and take care of boxers. There is so much room to make the sport a better one. It can be a sport organized like the NBA or major league baseball. It's a mission I have, to make a difference, especially for fighters."

The quarterback flatly rejected any suggestion he's delaying his comeback because the Falcons' season already appears hopeless. lie said the team's record is irrel­evant. but he's got to protect his future. 
"The opponents don't care about you," Vick said. "I have to care about me. This is my livelihood. I want to play for a long time."

In the past two weeks, Vick has spoken with McNabb, who acknowledged he wasn't 100 percent when he retumed for the playoffs last season. "lie emphasized to me not to rush it," Vick said. 
Vick tried to play with a severely sprained ankle dur­ing his sophomore year at Virginia Tech, but could bare­ly run. Never again. 
"If I go out and try to play at 80 percent, I'm not going to play like I want to play," Vick said. "I know what that feel­ing is like. I don't want to feel it again."

Mother Teresa 
A Lesson Most Definitely Learned 
by Keara Coughlin Intern, Office of Campus Ministry 
When I was a kid, being 'cool' was never that appealing to me ... but being strong, being tough-that meant EVERYTHING. I wanted to win every footrace, be the champion of every athletic event ... and no matter what happened, I never wanted to reveal pain or weakness. 
Irony, I have learned, seems to be the vehicle of choice for God as He teaches me (and the rest of the world) the most important lessons. In 1946, a tiny and unassuming young woman whose body suffered from the damage caused by tuberculosis began to follow a path that would bring unexpected hope and inspiration to this 'modern' world diseased with despair. It was then that Agnus Gonxha Bojaxhiu, known to her fellow sisters of Loretto as 'Teresa' heard a "call within a call" which demanded of her a com­plete surrender to God. "And when this happens," she said, "the only thing to do is to say 'yes.'" 
Mother Teresa spent the last fifty years of her life working not to realize great aspira­tions of transforming the world, but rather to live with a dedication to holiness -a holiness she was 
Mother Teresa will forever remind us that it is
certain was available to 
not important that we do 'great things,' but 
everyone. It was a holiness attained rather 'little things with great love.' She herself through follow­
was a little thing with great love. 
ing a "simple path." Silence, prayer, faith, love, service, and peace: these were her steps on the simple path to holiness. This meant loving Christ and doing so in the poorest of the poor by becoming one of them -sharing with them their suffering, washing their feet, tending to their wounds, caring for their sick and dying. 
Simplicity? Poverty? But I wanted to be strong -not weak and poor. I wanted to do amazing things that would impress everyone, not 'simple' things that nobody noticed. How "great" and "effective" could a person be if he or she doesn't fight for something? 
Enter The Cross: the moment when God himself became weak and broken. And in this brokenness, He healed the world. And with Mother Teresa's life, He again reminds this modern world of true efficacy. In her meekness, in her poverty, and in her simplic­ity, she did change the world. She very simply yet very deeply loved Christ: seeing His face in every beggar, every orphan, every leper. Last week, the whole Church praised God for the gift of this woman's life to the world, and by proclaiming her "Blessed," recognized the power of her actions during her life and her intercessions for us now. In the ceremony attended by hundreds of thousands, Pope John Paul II reminded us that her life was "a testimony to the dignity and the privilege of humble service." 
Mother Teresa will forever remind us that it is not important that we do 'great things,' but rather 'little things with great love.' She herself was a little thing with great love. Now that is strength ... that is everything.

to the Irish for the fifth straight year, as they hit -.008 on the match, largely due to the dominating Irish blockers, who finished with 16.5 team blocks to the Hedbirds' five. 
"I think we were confident [coming into today's game]." coach Deb Brown said. "I think that we feel like we knew that if we played well. we were capable of winning in three [games]." 
Brewster led the Irish with her impressive .524 hitting percentage, as she had 11 kills in 21 attempts with no errors. She ended game three, and the match, with her strong serving (17 points on the match). Meanwhile. Kelbley hit a strong .444 with her 11 kills. Jessica Kinder also added nine kills to round out the offense. 
However, this was after a horrendous first game. in which the Irish ended with a .044 hitting percentage. 
"I just think that our set location wasn't as good as it could have been and it got much better in games two and three," Brown said. 
The Irish didn't come to play in game one, making it easy on the Redbirds, as the Irish made mistakes on their side of the net. However. Illinois State didn't do much better, as they hit a meager ­.130 in the first game. 
"1 think it was more unforced errors than any­thing," Brown said. "But it was certainly uncharacteristic of this team and not the way 
we  wanted  to  start  game  
one."  
Game  two  saw  the  Irish  

begin to play their game. as setter Kristen Kinder led her offense to a stellar .531 hit­ting percentage. The Irish closed the match hitting a respectable .333 in game three. Kinder finished with 29 assists on the match to go along with her 12 digs. 
"I was pretty pleased with game two. and game three I thought we could have played better," Brown said. 
Defensively, Meg llenican once again led the Irish, a) the libero registered 17 digs. 
In the end, the Irish got the job done, as they increased their win streak to 11 games. and they look forward to Syracuse on Sunday, when they resume Big East play. 
"I don't want to sound like the coach who's never pleased. but we need to be better," Brown said. "We are preparing to play at a higher level -to play in the NCAA tournament. What we're look­ing for is more consistent play from the beginning to the end of the match."

Irish picked third in Big East conference 
Special to The Observer 
NEW YOHK. N.Y. -The Connecticut Huskies have been picked to win the 2003-04 BIG EAST regular season title by a vote of the league's head coaches. The Huskies received 13 first-place votes. 

Coaches did not place their own teams on their preseason ballots. It is the first time a team has been chosen unani­mously to win a regular sea­son crown since UConn received all possible votes in ~98-99. 
The BIG EAST is returning to one division this season. Last year, Connecticut was co­champion with Boston College in the East Division with 10-6 records. Connecticut finished the season 23-10 and advanced to the Sweet 16 round of the NCAA Tournament. 
The Huskies will be building around forward-center Emeka Okafor, the BIG EAST Preseason Player of the Year. and guard Ben Gordon, a pre­season first team All-BIG EAST Selection. UConn can also boast the Preseason Bookie of the Year, freshman forward Charlie Villanueva. 
Syracuse, the 2003 NCAA champion, is picked a solid second with Notre Dame third. Pittsburgh edged Providence for fourth place. 
Notre Dame and Pittsburgh were Sweet 1u teams last sea­son. Providence returns most of its key players from an 18­14 squad. 
The firth-place projection for the Friars matches their high­est preseason ranking in BIG EAST history.

Loss could help Irish for playoffs 
Over and over in sports sports fans have seen just how difficult it is for any team to go undefeated in a season. Rarely even do championship teams escape their sea­Andy Troeger

Sports Writer 
the best teams win­ning every game is often an unrealistic goal. 
Notre Dame's women's soc­cer team made it one game short of achieving that goal before running out of time against Michigan. 
With a No. 2 ranking, this begs the question about how the loss will affect the Irish come the postseason. 
With the loss coming out of the Big East schedule, the Irish still remain the favorites to win their eighth Big East Championship in nine years, especially if normal standouts Mary Boland and Melissa Tancredi return Sunday from nagging ankle injuries. If the Irish are able to get through the Big East, they still likely will get one of the top four seeds in the NCAA Tournament, meaning they would likely get to host as many as four games. In short, this loss itself could have very little impact on Notre Dame's upcoming postseason stand­ing. 
So the next question is, how does this Irish team regroup for their game Sunday against Miami? There are a few rea­sons to think that this loss could help the team's mentali­ty heading into the postseason. 
First, the Michigan game was a classic "trap game" for the Irish, who had only one game in between ending their dominating run through the conference and beginning the postseason on Sunday. Expect the Irish intensity to rise come Sunday. 
Second, the loss to Michigan was a wake-up call for a team that had so thoroughly domi­nated its last few opponents it was primed for a physical team like the Wolverines to catch them off guard. The Irish had scored 27 unan­swered goals in a row before Wednesday's loss. Don't count on them being caught off­guard again. 
Finally, the Irish now can head into the Big East not hav­ing to worry about how many teams they have shut out or how many games in a row they have won. Those types of statistical distractions are out of the picture with this loss, and it allows the Irish a chance to refocus on their two primary goals -winning the Big East Championship and winning the national champi­onship. 
And while the goal of an undefeated season was lost to Michigan, those other two goals are very much still in the picture.

Cey returns to net after missing first six games 
Irish look to avoid letdown at home 
By JUSTIN SCHUVER

lie's back. 
After missing the first five games of the season recovering from ofT-season knee surgery, junior goaltender Morgan Cey will return to action this Thursday and Friday as the Irish take on Nebraska-Omaha at the Joyce Center. 
Irish head coach Dave Poulin has made it perfectly clear that Ccy remains the No. 1 goaltender on the team, despite the recent play of freshman David Brown. 
"Morgan is going to play !Thursday) night and then we'll go from there," he said. "He's healthy and going to win the game." 
The Irish went 3-2-0 (2-2-0 in the CCII/\) in Ccy's absence, to a large part due to the play of Brown. who pitched back-to­hack shutouts in Notre Dame's two most recent wins, including an upset victory over then-No. 1 Boston College. 
But it is hard to keep a talented player like Ccy off the icc. Since arriving with the Irish in the 2000 season and making the CCI lA all-rookie team as an hon­orable mention, the Canadian native has been Notre Dame's workhorse in net. 
Over his first two seasons with the Irish, Ccy appeared in 71 out of 79 possible games and collect­ed a .912 save percentage and a 
2.80 goals-against average. He is on pace to easily beat the Irish career goaltending r.ecords in each category (Tony Zasowski's .892 and Forrest Karr's 2.92, respectively). 
Cey and the rest of the Irish will have to avoid a letdown against Nebraska-Omaha (0-3-1, 0-1-1) after knocking off the No. 1 team in the country on the road last weekend. Poulin does­n't believe his team will underes­timate the Mavericks. 
"I think I worry about us," he said. "You always respect your opponent, but I think rather than think about who's coming in here we're going to worry about what's happening with Notre Dame. 
"There's no such thing as a let­down in this league. There can't be, every team is too competitive and too good." 
The Irish held their home opener Oct. 17, and lost by a score of 5-3 to Bowling Green despite outshooting the Falcons 59-25. 
"It's interesting because that might have been our best game of the year," Poulin said. "We created lots of chances, but just didn't finish them. 
"We want to play that kind of game again, but we want to have a better final score." 
In addition to solid goaltending, a key component of Notre Dame's start to the season has been a penalty kill that is ranked frrst in the CCHA with a 92 per­cent success rate. On the power play, howev~r. the team has struggled -scoring just three goals with the man-advantage for a 10.5 percent success rate. 

"Special teams play is a huge part of college hockey," Poulin said. "I think the power play has created chances but just hasn't scored. We're pretty close, I think. 
"We have to get our power play going, though, there's no ques­tion. In each game there's a criti­cal turning point where a power play goal can really help swing the momentum in your favor." 
The Mavericks' last game was a 2-2 tie on the road against Western Michigan Oct. 18, the first game in which Nebraska­Omaha has earned a point this season. 
Offensively, freshman forward Scott Parse leads the team with five points (three goals, two assists) and is followed by senior forward Andrew Wong with four points, all assists. 
Senior Brian Haaland has been average in net so far this year, collecting a .893 save percentage and a 2.71 goals against average. 
Nebraska-Omaha split a two­game series with the Irish last year, with each team collecting a 5-3 win. The teams have met 13 times in the all-time series, with the Mavericks holding a 7-5-1 edge over the Irish. 
Faceoff for each game is scheduled for 7:35p.m.

FOOTBALL 
Mattison was aware of Campbell's injury 

Willingham, Baer did not realize tackle hurt himself in game 
By ANDREW SOUKUP 
Sports Wrirer 
All the conversation about Darrell Campbell's unex­plained absences is baffling to Notre Dame coaches. 
After Notre Dame's 27-25 loss to Boston College Saturday, both head coach Tyrone Willingham and defensive coordinator Kent Baer said they didn't know Campbell was out of the game in the second half. 
At his Tuesday press con­ference, Willingham said that it's not uncommon for the head coach or the defensive coordinator to know if a play­er is in or out because posi­tion coaches are often responsible for rotating play­ers in and out. 
"Sometimes I am not aware of some of the specific per­sonnel," he said. 
Campbell left Saturday's game because he said he lost feeling in his arm, defensive line coach Greg Mattison said. He is probable fpr this weekend's game, according to Willingham. 
"In my 30 years of coach­ing, I have never, when a defensive lineman has told me he couldn't play, gone running to the head coach or defensive coordinator," Mattison said. "And I might say that when I was a defen­sive coordinator, if a guy would have come up to me and said, 'My nose guard can't play,' I would have looked at him like he had two heads and said, 'Put in the next guy who can."' 
In the hands of the enemy 
A copy of the Notre Dame playbook is in Tallahasse, Fla. 
Or that's what Matt Root, a 

tight end who transferred 
from Notre Dame to Florida 
State in the spring, said, 
according to a story in the 
Tallahasse Democrat. 
"I got all the playbooks," 

the Florida native boasted. 
But Root said that Seminole coaches have teased him about turning them over, they haven't formally asked him for the playbooks. Instead, he said he has been queried about players and tendencies. 




That's all he'll be able to do to help beat his former team. Root is unable to play against the Irish because he must sit out for one year as mandated by NCAA regulations. Booker's return 
On signing day two years ago, Notre Dame head coach Tyrone Willingham believed his first Irish recruiting class would contain running back Lorenzo Booker, who planned to announce his decision on an evening ESPN telecast. 
But on national television, Booker stiffed the Irish and donned a Florida State hat. He said he's never once regretted his decision and looks forward to playing against the Irish Saturday. 
"I just want to go up there and win that game," Booker told the Tallahassee Democrat. "Because walking off that field there, if we win that game, I'd be feeling real good -letting all of you guys know, 'Yeah, I made the right choice."' 
What tipped the balance, Booker said, was the fact that he couldn't see himself play­ing for Willingham. 
"You can't be yourself," he said. "I felt whenever I was going to be around him, I would have to put on some kind of act."

Oklahoma or Miami lose and the Seminoles don't lose the rest of the way. 
They'll be lead by Bobby Bowden who, with a 48-24 vic­tory against Wake Forest Saturday, became the all-time winningest coach in Division I­A college football history. 
Saturday's game will be the second time in three weeks that the Irish will face a Top 10 opponent. USC blew out Notre Dame 45-14 Oct. 18. 
"We're lucky that our sched­ule at this time of the year gives us this opportunity that we have against one of the top four, three, five teams in the country, depending on what particular poll you are looking at," Willingham said. "We ha~e

got a great football team com­ing in here that gives us an opportunity to be the spoiler." 
Notre Dame thrived in that role a year ago, when players claimed they weren't getting enough national respect a year after a losing season. The 2002 campaign culminated in Tallahassee, when the Irish humiliated Florida State 34-24 to reach 8-0 on the season. Notre Dame seemed on its way up and Florida State, fighting to find a quarterback and its identity, was heading out of control. 
Now, the situation is com­pletely different. 
Behind quarterback Chris Rix, who reconciled with his teammates over the offseason and now directs a potent offense, the Seminoles are a Miami loss away from control­ling their own destiny. The Irish, 2-5, are trying to band­age a wound that seems to be re-opened week after week. 
Still, Willingham is encour­aged by Notre Dame's 18-point rally last week. Trailing 24-6, the Irish took a one-point lead with less than five minutes remaining, only to watch the Eagles win with a last-second field goal. 
And because the Irish haven't given up this season, according to Willingham, the ITish head coach believes his team has a chance at winning this weekend. 
"We can knock off Florida State," he said. "We have got to play consistent. We have got to execute. 
"We can't have lulls because Florida State, from what I have seen this year, doesn't have lulls. They go pretty hard the entire football game."
