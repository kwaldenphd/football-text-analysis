Arms control progress stalls as leaders dispute Star Wars 
Associated Press 
REYKJAVIK, Iceland-Presi­dent Reagan and Mikhail Gor­bachev, reportedly on the verge of an agreement to destroy all their offensive nu­clear weapons over the next 
I 0 years, ended their summit in · disappointment Sunday over a dispute concerning the testing of American "Star Wars" technology. 
The hangup Involved the Soviets' insistence that re­search on the anti-missile sys­tem be confined to laboratory work. Reagan declared, "This we could not and will not do," 
Gorbachev said that he made "very serious, unprece­dented concessions and ac­cepted compromises that are unprecedented." But he said there was a "rupture" over 
U.S. Insistence on being al­lowed to test space weapons outside the laboratory. "Who was going to accept that?" he said. "It would have taken a madman to accept that." 
The Iceland impasse was so complete that the leaders did not set a date for a third su­perpower meeting. and the fu­ture of arms control talks was left in doubt. 
Gorbachev told reporters "the Americans came to this meeting empty handed," and top Soviet official Georgi Ar­batov described the summit here as "the dead end to which they (the Americans) have driven the whole issue ofarms control." 
Secretary of State George Shultz said the two sides had verbally agreed to slash long­range missile and bomber aresenals in half in five years and completely by 1996. In addition, they were prepared to eliminate all but 100 medium-range missiles on each side -including all those deployed in Europe -during the first five-year phase and the balance of those in 1996 as well, Shultz said. 

"A tremendous amount of headway was made," he told a news conference here, "but in the end we couldn't make it." 
The problem: U.S. insis­tence on proceeding with test­ing of the Strategic Defense Initiative ("Star Wars") with the idea of using it a decade from now as an "insurance policy" to prevent any enemy from launching a successful nu­clear strike, Shultz said. 
Reagan was greeted at Andrews Air Force Base by his wife, Nancy. The two embraced and kissed several times before boarding a helicopter for the ride to­gether back to the White House.

Clarke Memorial Fountain to be dedicated at Friday mass 
Special to the Observer 
Notre Dame's memorial foun­tain honoring alumni war dead will be dedicated with a Mass at 4 p.m. Friday, Oct. 17. 
The Clarke Memorial Fountain, named after the Chicago couple who provided the principal fun­ding. was built to commemorate the estimated 500 Notre Dame alumni who died In World War II, Korea, and Vietnam. Another memorial on campus com­memorates World War I alumni dead. 
University President Father Theodore Hesburgh will be prin­cipal celebrant of the Mass, which will be said at the site. The Notre Dame band and Chapel Choir will participate, as well as contingents from the Army, Navy, and Air Force Reserve Of­ficer Training Corps detach­ments on campus. 
Representatives from area vet­era·ns' and military groups have also been invited to join faculty, staff, and students in the obser­vance. The homily will be preached by Monsignor Francis Sampson, assistant to the pres­ident for military affairs at the University. Sampson is a retired major general who served as the Army's chief of chaplains from 1967 to 1971. 
The major benefaction for the memorial came from the late Mrs. John Clarke in memory of her husband, a member of the Advisory Council for the College of BusinessAdministration at the University until his death in 
198.3. Mrs. Clarke, a former offi­cer in the Army Nurse Corps, died in September 1985. A 1964 Notre Dame alumnus, ·Tholl)as Shuff of Lake Forest, III., gave the initial gift in 198.3 that al­lowed planning of the memorial to begin. 
Design of the memorial was done by Notre Dame architecture alumni John Burgee and Philip Johnson. Cole Associates of South Bend assisted them. 
The fountain's four arches, reminiscent of England's Stonehenge, consist of sand-· colored limestone columns and caps. Each of the columns Is 20 feet high, five feet square and weighs 20 tons. The columns are capped by four 10-foot lime­stone pieces. Within each arch Is a fountain. In the center of the pool, which forms the base of the memorial, Is a 4-foot brown granite sphere. Three of the stone caps bear inscriptions identifying the wars In which Notre Dame alumni have served and died within the past forty-five years. A fourth bears the Latin Inscription "Pro Patria et Pace," which means "For our country and peace." 
Following the Mass, Father Hesburgh will bless the memorial, and remarks will be made by Lieutenant General Win­field Scott, Jr., superintendent of the u.s. Air Force Academy In Colorado. Scott graduated from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point In 1950 and subsequently received a master's degree In In­ternational law and relations from the catholic University of America In Washington, D.C. He was appointed to his current post in June 198.3. 
The dedicatory plaque, written by. Father Hesburgh, ends with these words, "This is our prayer: that all living Notre Dame men and women dedicate themselves to the service oftheir country and 
world peace."

to pass too quickly, especially when we're having fun. But what is Time? 
Time is so difficult to grasp, science doesn't even define it. Man can't define it, but yet he measures it. Time is a medium with which we live and work. 
We all know there are countless things that can be done in time. The problem is there never seems to be enough of it. How often have we wished for more time to finish a problem on an exam or more time to turn in a paper or just more time to relax? It seems we simply can't get enough time to do either what we want or have to do. 
Since this is the case, our job is to make the best use of the time we have. The hard part, of course, Is doing just that. Whenever I look at the schedule of things I have to do for a class, I can't avoid thinking "How am I going to get all this done?" Once I realize I have to finish a book (or two), complete homework assignments for four different classes, study for an upcoming exam, and call home all within the period of one weekend, I really get nervous. I ask myself, "Where are you going to start?" Then It occurs to me the best place to begin is at the beginning. It's usually quite helpful to remember the proverb, "Ajourney of a thousand miles begins with a single step." 
Of course, the sooner that journey is begun, the sooner It can be finished. My mother always reminded me of this when I tended to put things off. If we allow ourselves to, we can get into the dangerous habit of putting things off until later. A classic statement of laziness Is "''m going to stop procrastinating, starting tomorrow." Some­times, tomorrow never comes. English humorist 
G.K. Chesterfield said: "Know the true value of time; snatch, seize and enjoy every moment of it. No idleness; no laziness; no procrastination ­never put off till tomorrow what you can do today." We should take this advice seriously. It can only help us In the long run. 
As freshmen at Notre Dame, we were advised to e'1ioy our years here because they pass too quickly. Alas, It is too true. I discovered this after graduating from high school. Remembering the words of my principal, "Get involved and enjoy It while you're here. By the time you're a senior you'll wonder where it went," I was astonished to learn how right he was. Others have told me, "College Is something you only do once-do well but enjoy it." Nobody said It was going to be easy to do both, but we should certainly try.

Time is a curious thing. We never really possess it, but we can do an infinite number of things with it. Time can be spent. bought. used, and even killed. This is a serious sin. Swiss theologian John Lavater said: "The great rule of moral conduct, next to God, Is to respect time." The worst thing anyone can do is to do nothing. Sins of omission are equally as culpable as sins of commission. 
We must remember that we are mortal beings. It's a fact of life we will someday die. But if we make use of our time on earth we can carry our­selves Into eternity. 
Let's also remember that we can't stop time. "Time drags inexorably onward," my senior En­glish teacher often said. There is virtually no limit to what we can learn, here at Notre Dame and throughout life. But the greatest thing we can learn, greater than any mathematical formula or scientific concept, greater than any Jaw of eco­nomics or literary masterpiece, is how to use time.

Three weeks before an Ameri­can election day, Reagan will want to convince voters, mem­bers of Congress and allies that Star Wars is worth the worldwide chill that could spread from remote Iceland. The Soviets presumedly hoped to take ad­vantage of the pre-election mood to spur Reagan toward an agree­ment. 
The first challenge could come from Democratic-controlled House of Representatives, which last week backed down from a vote freezing funds for Star Wars research and calling for America to join a Soviet moratorium on nuclear weapons testing. 
The next challenge will come not to Reagan himself, but to the narrow Repi,Jbllcan majority In the Senate, a margin that has been key to the administration's military and foreign policy. 
Soviet officials have made clear that they are prepared to walt for the next president to pursue their own vision of arms control.

Dear Notre Dame Community: 
In the October 1Oth issue of the Observer an advertisement was run on page six advertising the "Taste of Nations" event. The artwork and layout for this ad was submitted by Adworks to the Observer. It has been brought to my attention that the ad contained an offensive symbol, which resembles a swastika sign, on it. I agree that the containing of the swastika-like flag was both distasteful and unprofessional and was in no way condoned by the executive management of Adworks. The mistake took place in the lower levels of our organization without our knowledge of it. It is no less still my responsibility as its Executive Vice President, and in charge of operations, to see to it that all work done has been approved before going out. This work, however, did not gain that approval. The parties involved have been reprimanded and are being dealt with internally. However, the mistake has been made and I sincerely apologize for it. Steps will be taken to insure that all of the organizations listed as sponsors will be disassociated with the responsibility of this mistake. assure you that it will not happen again. I hope that this event will not have a lasting effect on the reputation of our organization as a whole. 
Sincerely yours,

Associated Press 
REYKJAVIK. Iceland-President Reagan will be attempting in a planned television address Mon­day night to convince the world that Soviet intransigence is at fault for the summit stalemate in Iceland and that his Star Wars program is worth the price of stalled arms reductions. 
To protect his Strategic Defense Initiative, as Star Wars is formally known, Reagan ap­parently declined an agreement under which the superpowers would sharply reduce nuclear weapons over a 1 0-year period. 
Star Wars, as his program is commonly known, did not exist as an arms control issue before Reagan unveiled it in March 198.3 as a plan to use exotic weapons to knock out incoming strategic missiles. 
But it emerged from the sum­
mit as the central issue in East­
West relations, the issue the 
Soviets say is blocking accord in 
all fronts. 
Reagan said that "While both 
sides seek reduction in the num­
ber of nuclear missiles and war­
heads threatening the world, the 
Soviet Union insisted that we 
sign an agreement that would 
deny to me and to future presi­
dents for 10 years the right to 
But, the president said, "there remained at the end of our talks one area of disagreement ... The Soviet Union Insisted that we sign an agreement that would deny to me and to future presi­dents for 10 years the right to develop, test and deploy a defense against nuclear missiles for the people of the free world." 
Shultz told reporters, "The two leaders just decided they were not able to agree. At that point, the two leaders, being unable to agree, acljourned." 
Asked whether there would be another summit meeting be­tween Reagan and Oorbachev, Arbatov said, "If the Americans do not change their position on this basic issue, I am afraid not." 
Shultz said the leaders had nearly agreed on ways "to deal effectively with intermediate range missiles," and had made progress toward an agreement on limiting underground nuclear tests, but that the potential agreements failed to materialize because all the parts were Interr­elated. 
"It became more and more clear that the Soviet Union's ob­jective was effectively to kill off the SDI program, and to do so by seeking a change in the ABM treaty that would so constrain . . . that research would not be able to proceed forcefully," he said. 
"The president . . . simply would not turn away from the basic Interest of the United States' allies In the free world by abandoning this." 
He said Reagan had been prepared to agree to a 1 0-year period of nonwithdrawal from the Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty, during which "the United States was prepared to do . . . testing ... permitted by theABM treaty." 
Shultz said the Soviets insisted on "a change In the ABM (anti­ballistic missile) treaty . . . that would confine research and test­ing and development to the lab­oratory." 
He added: "there's nothing In the ABM treaty about that so this would definitely be a change. They described It as a strengthening," butAmerican of­ficials found It unacceptable.

LaRouche records seized in raid 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -Federal inves­tigators, with more than two truckloads of seized records to sort through, are focusing on obstruction ofjustice charges as they try to unravel political ex­tremist Lyndon LaRouche's net­work of organizations. 
After nearly two years of inves­tigating what U.S. attorney Henry Hudson called "an organiza­tional policy of fraud and bilking," the government last week raided LaRouche's Virginia headquarters and indicted several of his inner circle mem­bers, his fund-raisers and as­sorted corporations and commit­tees. 
The government provided a broad look at its case last week In persuading a federal magistrate to hold without bond two top LaRouche lieutenants facing obstructon charges. 
That evidence touched LaRouche himself, who has not

"The problems inside are very serious," added Marcos Efren Zavlnana Guadarrama ofMexico. "There are areas where people could be trapped and still be alive, but we cannot know until we reach them." 
On Saturday, 21 people were pulled alive from the rubble of the five-story Ruben Darla down­town office building, and three women were rescued from the been charged but who prosecutors contend "dominates and controls" an organization charged with conspiracy to obstruct justice. 
It also shed light on what is one of the most bizarre political organizations ever-whose mem­bers, according to the FBI, make late-night harassing telephone calls to opponents and thought they could get CIA help to "spike" a federal fraud Investigation of them. 
LaRouche is a frequent fringe candidate for president who espouses a complex conspiracy view of the world that defies ideological labels, lumping the Queen of England, Soviet leaders and prominent Americans as co-conspirators and drug dealers. 
Ten of his followers and five of his organizations were in­dicted in Boston on charges of fraud, in a scheme in which $1 million was allegedly bilked in unauthorized credit card 
wreckage of an annex of the presidential palace on the city's southern outskirts. 
Silva carranza said that three of the survivors, two children and a woman, were found buried un­der 90 feet of rubble on what had been the third floor of the Ruben Daria building. 
"We heard them," said John carroll, 33, a member of the Miami, Fla., Metro Fire-Rescue Department, who helped super­vise the slow, exacting rescue ef­fort at the Ruben Daria Building. 

"That's the way it always is," carroll said. "We listen for the voices and start digging toward them, and sooner or later we can get to them, we can touch them, we can reassure them, we can comfort them a little bit and keep them from losing it mentally until we can get them out."

Mother Teresa's plane runs into crowd, kills 5 
Associated Press 

DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania ­Mother Teresa said her visit to Tanzania was partly to blame for the deaths of five people, killed when her plane plowed into a crowd of well-wishers. But she decided Sunday to complete her trip. 
A plane carrying the Nobel Peace Prize winner, a second passenger and the pilot veered into the crowd in an aborted takeoff Saturday. A nun, two boys and two men were killed and two nuns were slightly in­jured. 
No one on the twin-engine Ces­sna 402 was hurt. The cause of the accident is still under inves­tigation. Church officials quoted the pilot, a Norwegian identified as Rolf Klemesten, as saying the plane moved to the right sud­denly as it gained speed. 
The accident occurred at the remote Hombolo missionary center in central Tanzania, about 200 miles west of Dares Salaam. 
After viewing the mutilated bodies of victims ata morgue in nearby Dodoma, a shaken Mot­her Teresa said, "My coming is behind this accident." 
She boarded a private plane for Tabora on Sunday after visit­ing the two injured nuns. 
Church officials said Mother Teresa would attend a ceremony Monday in Tabora where seven Missionary of Charity sisters are to take their first vows. 
She is scheduled to leave Tan­zania Wednesday.

Hesburgh invites all to monument dedication 
Dear Editor: 
I write to invite the Notre Dame com­munity to the dedication of the Clarke Memorial Fountain October 17. We will celebrate a Mass for Notre Dame war dead at 4 p.m. at the Fountain site. 
What does the Clarke Memorial Foun­tain memorialize? War? No. In the spirit of upcoming All Souls' Day, it memorializes almost 500 Notre Dame men who made the supreme sacrifice for their country. 
All of these young men, like all of those here at Notre Dame, had their whole lives ahead of them. When their country called, they answered. In the agony of war, far from home and country, their lives ended. And so, at long last, we remember them here at Notre Dame where they all had great days and high hopes, as you do. 
The memorial was designed by two of the greatest living American architects, John Burgee, a Notre Dame architecture alumnus, and Philip Johnson. They donated their services as an act of homage to these young men. 
Atop three of the four twin columns are named the wars in which these men died: World War II, Korea and Vietnam. On the fourth-is a prayer and an invitation: Pro Patria et Pace. It is an invitation to each of us to serve our country, and a prayer that we may do it in the cause of peace. 
We probably will not be asked to give our lives for our country and peace as these young men did. Rather, we must live and work for peace in our times, no easy task in a nuclear age. But the memorial stands and beckons. And it constantly asks a question: What have you done for peace in our time? 
Blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the Children of God. Let's call it the Peace Memorial.

Right to Life president corrects mistaken date 
Dear Editor: 
The Notre Dame-Saint Mary's Right to Life Group would like to apologize to any who may have expected to attend the Respect Life Mass and Dinner this past weekend. We had hoped to com­memorate Respect Life Sunday with this event, but we were advised to reschedule because of a time conflict with the Ala­bama game. We had also understood that 
Doonesbury 
the Mass would be cancelled the evening 
of the 4th because of the game, if we 
rescheduled. The Mass, though, was held 
and was well attended; we hope those 
who were expecting a Respect Life Mass 
and Dinner willjoin us at the rescheduled 
time. This will be Saturday, Dec. 6. We 
had put out publicity announcing the new 
date, but our efforts were bedeviled; last 
Friday's Observer still announced the 
original date. 
So we apologize to anyone who might have been inconvenienced. We will be holding the Mass with Bishop d'Arcy, and the dinner with Professor Douglas Kmiec, Assistant Deputy Attorney General as our speaker on Saturday Dec: 6. Tickets must be purchased in advance and will be avail­able in the dining hall from Nov. 24-28. We hope to see you there!

Crude 'mess-ages' have no place at university 
Dear Editor: 
Concerning free speech and righteous restraint topics recently featured in Ob­server reports and correspondence, con­sider the following local vignette: today a balding young man preceded me down the sidewalk past Declo and O'Shaughnessy Halls and on into the En­gineering Building where his elevator key took him from sight. This person obvi­ously felt not only free, but proud and clever, to communicate a crudely offen­sive message displayed on the back of his jacket in letters large enough for a kindergarten child to read: Liquor In The Front --Poker In The Rear. 
Now this is not the first postadoleScent male here on "Our Lady's campus" to strut his homophonic stuff with this quaint tavern motto, attached or sten­cilled onto his clothing like some sartorial tattoo. But it is the last time I will accept the communique without comment. For the tainted and impovershed sexual im­agination expressing itself under the veil of such dim wit can only partially conceal the immodest anxieties and confused ag­gression burdening the male shoulders needing to thus proclaim in public the "silent scream" that is their true text. 
But the appropriate response to such verbal polluters -who are obviously free to wander this pastoral campus -is not that of censorship. Nor need any feminists, secular humanists. fundamen­talists, liberals or conservatives forgather to burn such textually offensive sub­stitutes for the cultural script of a dying giant. That script is, in fact being sub­jected daily to increasingly skilled critique from all quarters. 

What is needed here, as in every com­munity that holds freedom of expression to be a fundamental condition for the col­lective, perfective enterprise, is a loud and clear, full exercise of free speech by a maximum number of respondents. 
Trained for the exercise from pre­school days, it is .time for us to begin pointing out "What's Wrong With This Pic­ture" to the confused disseminators of such mess-ages. Gag orders -even when on is gagging on a so-called gag -are always a noxious prescription in a univer­sity community. The healthy as well as the ill are always made worse by this pseudo-remedy that cures nothing, and no one.

New Yorker responds to Mets accusations 
Dear Editor: 
I knew where the article was going when 
I read how he berated the Notre Dame 
football team. There are times when 
people just go too far. Such was the case 
with Marty Strasen's article on Oct. 7 en­
titled, "Baseball playoffs encourage 'hot­
dog' antics." Never before in my life have 
I felt so compelled to respond to a column 
than I did to his. 
After I blew up upon reading the article, 
I tried to figure out why The Observer 
would print such an article in the first 
place. I eventually attributed it to dead­
lines and a lack of a real column to run 
in its place. Then I returned to the article 
itself. I had to believe him when he wrote 
that he didn't know the playoffs started 
that day (Oct. 7), and I was surprised he 
even knew who was playing being as he 
didn't know anything else. 
As you may have surmised, I am a Mets 
fan. I've lived in New YorkaH my life and 
I go to Mets games whenever possible. 
In all my years of going to Shea Stadium, 
I have never once seen a wino anywhere 
on or near Stadium grounds (which, by 
the way, are cleaned before and after each 
game). And, contrary to Strasen's beliefs, 
scalpers are not specific to Shea Stadium. 
They are, in fact, present at every stadium 
in the country including our own stadium 
at any home football game. 
Now, I have nothing personal against 
the Cubs or Bears or any Chicago team, 
Garry Trudeau 
but. ..if any fan should know about losing, it's a Cub fan. And until recent years, Mets fans have had to suffer through each season as do Cub fans pres­ently. Now that the Mets have broken their losing doldrums-what's a "high-five" after a homerun? We, as Mets fans, have been waiting long enoughlitwas the Cubs' turn in '84. It's now finally our turn to bask in the spotlight. Spoiled? Hardly. Relief? Definitely. 
The Houston incident has been blown out ofproportion also. It certainly showed poor taste to refer to Mets player Tim Teufel as "Jailbird no. 1." He then called Mets fans "spoiled" for booing this same player who has not performed all year. It is a part of the game when the fans ex­press their opinions about players during the game though I'm not condoning it. Again, Shea isn't the only place where this occurs. When it comes to "hot­dogging," Walter Payton's struts Into the end zone come to mind. 
Players such as Gary Carter and Lenny Dykstra are not "hot-dogging" as he called it but rather showing their intensity -something he's obviously not familiar with. He is also basing his article on the actions of a few. At one Mets game I at­tended, an opposing fan destroyed a seat in frustration after his team lost yet no fan "ran him out of town" as Strasen would have you believe. I recently saw the Mets win their 1OOth victory In Chicago. The actions of the fans there didn't exactly approach sainthood either. Now don't get me wrong, some of my best friends are Cub fans. I, at least had the sensibility to realize that the fans I saw weren't representative of Cub fans everywhere. 
It's Incredible to believe that he thinks the only place in the world where the fans are friendly is in Chicago. It's also hard to believe that an assistant sports editor could use his column to express his per­sonal opinion about which he shows a lack of knowledge.

I want to retire at forty. I want to throw up a lot. I can't believe I really want to be like that. It's all so selfish and cold. It reeks of snobbery and irresponsibility. Oh, well. I always have my other dreams.

AIESEC gets down to business 
KIM YURATOVAC features writer 

Promoting "international un­derstanding, cooperation and in­terdependence" are the goals of the AIESEC organization. AIESEC is the French acronym for the In­ternational Association of Stu­dents in Economics and Com­merce. The international student-run organization spon­sors traineeship programs in which recent college graduates are able to work in another country for six weeks to eighteen months in fields such as account­ing, finance, computer science and other business-related areas. 
AIESEC was founded interna­tionally in 1948, nationally in 1958 and at Notre Dame in 1964. More than 440 universities in 62 countries are involved. Cur­rently, there are 25 members in the Notre Dame-Saint Mary's chapter. Notre Dame AIESEC Predldent Michelle Curtin said that members meet bi-weekly and attend a regional conference once a semester with students from the other 20 schools In the central conference. Curtin adds that the "reglonals are a lot of fun. They involve training ses­sions, informative speakers as well as an opportunity to meet both students from the U.S. and foreign countries who work towards AIESEC's goals." 
This weekend, members will travel to Indianapolis to attend a conference sponsored by Purdue University. Tricia O'Connell, a member of AIESEC's finance committee, says the regionais are a good way "to meet people from other organizations and im­prove our organization here." O'Connell, an accounting major, believes that her involvement with AIESEC will help in her career. 
Presently, there is one Saint Mary's graduate working in the Netherlands and a former Notre Dame student working in Finland through AIESEC's program. There are also two Europeans working in South Bend. Philippe Bodson, of Brussels, Belgium, majored in accounting at the Uni­versity of Brussels. He arrived last December and is doing an internship with the Crowe-Chisek accounting firm until the end of January. Bodson said that he en­joys working with the audits of commercial clients. After his in­ternship, he will return to Bel­gium and serve in the army. 
Andrew Dzuryk. of Poland, develops marketing information for the Mastic Corporation. Dzuryk graduated from the Uni­versity of Gdansk with a major in foreign trade. He is working on his masters studies in computer science. Dzuryk says that he likes South Bend because he "prefers 
· nature to skyscrapers." Steve Boulet, head of the Reception Committee of AIESEC, says that his committee is responsible for finding housing and transporta­tion for the trainees and making sure they integrate with the local AIESEC club. According to Boulet, "AIESEC tries to solicit companies in the area for two things. First, they encourage them to take a trainee. They pick the specifications, level of train­ing, education and country. At an international conference, the descriptions are matched with the trainee applications." 
Coming AIESEC activities In­clude the Purdue conference and a fundralser selling Notre Dame binoculars at home football games.

Reggae band Ipso Facto 
visits Mitchell's tonight 
Special to The Observer 
Next week Notre Dame and Saint Mary's seniors may be sunning themselves in Jamaica, but tonight Jamaica comes to South Bend when the reggae band Ipso Facto performs at Mitchell's Indiana Club. 
In August, the Minneapolis-based Ipso Facto was the onlyAmerican reggae band invited to play before an international audience at the annual Reggae Sunsplash music festival in Montego Bay, Jamaica. The eight-piece, multi-racial band plays solid reggae bass and drum rhythms, combined with pop, rock and rhythm and blues arrange­ments. 
Ipso Facto is one of the rare reggae bands to have a female drummer. The band was formed in 1983 by the talented McFarlane family featuring sister Julitta on drums, brother Wain singing lead vocals, JuJu on bass and brother Micah as manager. They play original reggae tunes (ipso facto is Latin for actual fact) and well chosen cover songs. Ipso Facto's unique sound is apparent by the diverse range of musical groups they've performed with. They've toured the southeast coast with UB40; opened several times for Steel Pulse; opened for the Kinks, the Clash, Burning Spear, Black Uhuru and Third World. 
The mayor of Minneapolis proclaimed September 1 "Ipso Facto Day" in that city in honor of the band's triumphant return from representing America at the 1986 Reggae Sunsplash in Jamaica. Ipso Facto has already won 10 Minnesota Music Awards, including the title for "Best Ethnic Group." In 1984 and 1985, the band won the Black Musicians Award for "Best Reggae Group." 
Beginning in October, Ipso Facto will be seen on national television singing the rocMeggae song "No Cocaine" in an MTV public service spot, part of a national campaign against cocaine abuse. 
This fall, Ipso Facto will be on a tri-state tour, playing in Chicago, South Bend, Kalamazoo and other cities. Tickets for the South Bend performance can be purchased for $7 at Mitchell's tonight. 
Ipso Facto's music can be heard on WVPE-FM 88 each Saturday night between 10 p.m. and midnight on the station's "88 Reggae Street" program.

Record -setter 
Scott baffles Mets to even up series 

Associated Press 
NEW YORK· Mike Scott pitched a three-hitter in a record-setting performance, beating the New York Mets 3-I last night as the Houston Astros evened the Na­tional League playoffs at two vic­tories apiece. 
Alan Ashby, given a second chance when his foul popup wasn't caught hit a two-run homer and Dickie Than added a solo shot, accounting for all the runs off Mets left-hander Sid Fer­nandez. 
Scott, who beat the Mets I-0 in Game I, became the first pitcher in either league to pitch two complete games in a playoff series. 
Scott won Game I with a five­hitter, equalling a playoff record with I4 strikeouts. While he was less overpowering this time out, returning on three-days rest after throwing 125 pitches in Game I, he was no less effective. He did not give up a hit until Ray Knight's two-out single in the fifth inning, while walking none and striking out five. 
That gave Scott I9 strikeouts, most ever in a league playoff. Dave Stieb had I8 strikeouts for Toronto in last year's American League playoffs against Kansas City. 
The lone run off Scott came in the eighth when pinch-hitter Danny Heep drove in Mookie Wil­son with a sacrifice fly. 
Rookie left-hander Jim Des­haies, I 2-5 during the season, will face the Mets' Dwight Gooden, who lost Game I despite giving upjust one run in seven innings, as the two sides try to break the second tie of the playoffs in Game 5 tonight. There was a forecast for a chance of rain for the game. 
Astros Manager Hal Lanier wrestled with the decision whe­ther to bring Scott back on three­days rest, although he had a 5·3 record in games earlier this season that he had started with­out the normal four days off. But the gamble paid off as Scott had his split-fingered fastball working to perfection. 
The Astros scored two of their runs in the second inning, an in­ning prolonged when the Mets failed to catch a popup in foul territory by Ashby before he hit his home run. 
Glenn Davis started the inning­that-might-not-have-been for Houston when he lofted a soft single into center field to lead off the second. 
Fernandez, making his first postseason appearance on his 24th birthday, then struck out Kevin Bass and Jose Cruz. He had a 3·I count on Ashby when the catcher hit a high popup toward the seats in shallow left field. 
Ray Knight backpedalled from his third base position with a decent chance of catching the ball for the third out of the in­ning. Instead, shortstop Rafael Santana, out of position to make the play himself, called Knight off at the last second, and the ball fell untouched, one row into some VIP boxes constructed es­pecially for the playoffs. Ashby fouled off one pitch, then hit the next one into the visiting bullpen in left field for a 2·0 Houston lead. 
Ashby had just seven home 
runs during the season. 

The Astros got their third run 
in the fifth innin~ when Than 
homered to left with one out. 
Than, who hadjust three regular­
season homers, hit an 0-I pitch 
from Fernandez. 

Fernandez was lifted for a 
pinch hitter after six Innings, 
giving up three runs onjust three 
hits, but two of them were the 
homers. 

Wilson led off the Mets eighth 
with an Infield hit behind second 
base. Heep drove him home 
with a fly ball to medium-deep 
center field.

The Red Sox blew a chance to go ahead In the I Oth when Bar· rett, who had bunted Into a for­ceout, took third on Dave Stapleton's one-out single.

Field hockey team beats Alma, 4-1 

By MARGOT MACHECA Sports Writer 

The Notre Dame field hockey team battled the elements as well as Alma College yesterday, but the torrential downpour could not keep the Irish from tallying their third win in a row. 
Despite the sloppy conditions, Notre Dame emerged with a 4-1 victory over its visiting oppo­nents to improve its season record to 4-5. 
The Irish scored first on a goal by senior co-captain Meg McGlinn at 12:05 into the opening period. Because the turf was slower than usual, however, there was no more scoring until the second half. 
Fourteen minutes into the second period, though, Notre Dame's all-time scoring leader Corrine DiGiacomo tallied the first of her two goals to increase 
her team's lead. DIGiacomo's 
shot came on an assist from junior back Janet Budnick. 
Alma knocked In a score with 
ten minutes to go in the match 
to cut the Irish margin, but Notre 
Dame goalie M.J. Beetel had six 
saves to hold the visitors to that 
lone goal. 

Sophomore Caroline Berezny and DiGiacomo finished the scoring with a goal apiece in the closing minutes of the game. 
Notre Dame head coach Jill Lindenfeld was pleased with the play of her young Irish team that has been improving steadily with every game. 
"We played a very controlled, not flashy, game with very good passing," she noted. "With back­ward passes and feeding to our forwards, we controlled the whole game." 
Since no one player stood out 
in the match for the Irish, Lin­
denfeld stressed the importance 
of playing together. 

"We played a team-game today with everybody contributing," she noted. 
On a more disappointing note, junior co-captain Mary Wagner suffered a broken nose during the match and could miss the rest of the season. Wagner's loss may effect the Irish in their up­coming date against Michigan State Wednesday, but Lindenfeld feels that her team is ready for the challenge of a Big Ten schol­arship team. 
"Although we are not the favorites, I think the girls are ready for the match in order to test themselves against some very good players," said Linden­feld. 

Mistakes

terception dashed Notre Dame's hopes of victory. 
It didn't appear that the Irish would even need a comeback In this one. 
With 2:5.3 left, the Irish had a 9-7 lead and the ball. Two short runs and one incomplete pass later, the Irish were faced with a fourth down and the punting unit came out. Pitt figured to get decent field position but it got a Jot more. 
Matt Bradley, one of a pack of Panthers that broke through the Irish line, tipped Dan Sorensen's punt, which turned out to be a one-yarder, giving Pittsburgh the ball at the Irish .34-yard line and giving Notre Dame fans that here-we-go-again feeling. 
The reason for the tipped punt was a total mystery to Notre Dame head coach Lou Holtz. 
"I was really disappointed with the blocked punt," he said. "I didn't think that would happen and I can't tell you why or how." 
Sorensen was not surprised by the pressure, but he was surprised at the result. 
"We knew they were going to bring ten men," he said. "I thought ! got the kick off quick enough, but I suppose I should've gotten it off quicker." 

Pitt head coach Mike Gottfried said he was confident that his team would get to the kick. 
"We don't worry about the dangers of blocking a punt, we just went out and said 'We're going after it,"' he said. "We said, 'We're going out to take it off his foot,' and that's what happened." 
That also happened to enable Pitt to kick a field goal and take a 10-9 lead. 
Notre Dame began its final march on its own 24 with 1: 1 7 left and it looked like this would be the drive that would break the drought. A .31-yard pass to Milt Jackson got things started, and when a swing pass to Anthony Johnson went for 22 yards, the Irish had a first down at Pitt's 2.3­yard line. 
Here's where the ghosts of the past mistakes and bad luck got the best of Notre Dame again. 
On the first-down play, the Irish were called for illegal pro­cedure. Both Steve Beuerlein and Holtz disagreed with the ref­eree's call. 
"It was on them. When I said, 'set' one of their guys made con­tact with our guard," Beuerlein said. "When Tom Rehder, our left

tackle, saw that, he just stood up. They made contact first so it should have been on them." 
"I don't know what happened on that penalty. It looked like their boy made contact and then (Rehder) moved," Holtz said. 
The penalty had more far­reaching consequences than simply the loss of five yards. It shaped the strategy of the Irish drive, as a pass to Johnson fell Incomplete and two runs by the freshman failed to get a first down. 
"We played for the field goal after the penalty because we didn't want to turn the ball over," Holtz said. 
The field goal that the Irish set up was a .38-yard attempt by John Carney that was wide right. Everything seemed right mo­ments before the attempt. 
"I walked over and said 'How do you feel and what do you think?'," Holtz explained. "He looked very confident and said, 'Hey, we got It coach."' 
And everything seemed right with the kick from the point of view of Sorenson, who was hold­ing for carney. 
"It looked really close to me," he said. "I thought it could have 
gone either way. From my angle 
it looked like it went right over 
the top of the goalpost." 
Everything that looked so right, like it would be so different than other times, ended up to be just another chapter in what Is a continuing series of "could haves" and "almosts" that are undoubtably trying Notre Dame's patience. 
. "I've been here for four years now," Beuerlein said. "I don't know what the percentages are but whenever we have a chance to win at the end, it seems to go against us quite a bit."

ND falls to 1-4 as Pitt rallies to 10-9 upset win 
Defense can't bail out Irish 
By MARTY STRASEN Assistant Sports Editor 

No matter how hard the defense tried to patch things up Saturday, Notre Dame's offense and special teams just could not seem to get along. 
The Pittsburgh Panthers, meanwhile, simply enjoyed watching the Irish struggle, and then came roaring back with a second-half surge to pull out a 10-9 upset victory at Notre Dame Stadium. 
"It was an exceptionally depressing loss for our football players," said Notre Dame head coach Lou Holtz, who could only look on as a last-minute field-goal at­tempt by John Carney sailed wide to lower the squad's 1986 record to 1-4. "I give Pitt a lot of credit. We knew they'd play tough defensively." 
In the first half, the Irish special teams and defense combined to put the offense In great field position, pinning Pittsburgh deep in Its own end on a number of oc­casions. Notre Dame was only able to manage two carney field goals, however, from .35 and 48 yards in the second quar­ter, to take a 6-0 halftime lead into the locker room. 
"I told our kids at halftime," said Pan­thers head coach Mike Gottfried, "that to be down only six points, we were still In the ballgame. We had a field goal blocked Pittsburgh quarterback John Congemi fires a pass over Notre ourselves (by Irish tackle Mike Griffin),Dame defenders Cedric figaro (48) an~ Jeff Aim (90) in Sat­and we had a lot of dropped passes.
