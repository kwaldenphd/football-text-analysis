selected by the individual departments will provide advise on majors, departmental requirements and career op­portunities to both the general counsellors and students. 
Dr. Hofman noted that five of the six regular counsellors ara new. He also pointed out tha the office hired young men to fill these positions. "We don't expect them to know everything, and when they need information outside of their own frames of reference they are instructed to call the appropriate depart­mental advisor." 
The regular counselling staff consists of :Dr. Mark Bamanek and Mr. Paul Jones, science; Dr. Niel Schilmoeller, engineering; Fr. Thomas Seidel, business; Dr. Darly Glick, arts and letters, and Mr. Dwight Murphy, black students (by request). 
The diagnostic and guidance testing, scheduled for 2:00 Monday in the Athletic and Convocation Center, has been re­designed and expanded to include three types of tests : 
-Achievement tests on academic subjects -Interests tests --Personality inventories 
Dr. Hofman noted that since the allotted time for testing was not based on the test battery currently planned, the session will be cramped. Students are urged to arrive early. 
The other three units of the freshman office include Academic programs, special projects and the development of a learning resources center. Dr. Hofman will oversee these units himself. Assistant Dean Robert Glennen will direct the coun­selling program. Peter Grande, also an assistant dean, will oversee the "systems unit" 
which  includes  the  testing  
program.  
Concerning  the  palnned  

merger with SMC's freshman year office, Dr. Hofman noted the 
(continued on page 2} 
On the question of credit hours toward graduation, Mrs. Doherty stated that "if anything there will be a slight reduction in required hours." The upper classmen are 
required to have 128 hours in order to graduate. The freshmen load will be reduced because of the new science requirements for BA majors and the coordination of SMC-ND courses. Freshmen will take a normal course load of 15 hours except those going overseas. Those in the Rome and other programs abroad will be required to take more language credits than regular BA majors. 
The question of diplomas for the incoming freshmen has also been settled. "Saint Mary's College will appear on with the University of Notre Dame on all diplomas received by the new freshmen. 
With the merger of depart­ments effective this September, freshmen will now be under the chairmen of their major department at Notre Dame. Former SMC chairmen are now associate department heads 


New York--Contending that his visa had been revoked while he was flying here from Ireland, the United States Government argued before a hearing officer that Joe Cahill should not be allowed to remain in this country. Cahill, the leader of the militant "provisional" wing of the I.R.A. was ordered held in a guarded dormitory until the hearing resumes next Tuesday. 
London-In a further British move to keep the pound sterling from floating too high against the dollar, British officials lowered the maximum interest rate in their country from 6 per cent to 5 per cent. The lower rate, it is hoped, will ward off further in­flows of speculative dollars and slow the depreciation of the dollar. 
Berlin-The formal signing of the Big Four Agreement on Berlin was delayed at least 24 hours by difficulties in matching the English-German and Russian-German versions of the Treaty's text. 
Washington--South Vietnam's military leaders are "less than unanimous" in supporting President Nguyen Van Thieu's decision to go ahead with the presidential election even though he has no opponent, the nation's intelligence services told President Nixon. Although most generals pledged their support at a secret meeting with Thieu last week, the services said, some were "noncommitial."

similar anti-social behavior which were brought before them." 
"We are convinced," Stephan's letter stated "that precise guidelines must be established for the disciplinary boards, that sanctions should be clear and unequivocal for the offenses committed, and that their ap­plication must be swift once the facts supporting the charge have been found." 
The Trustees called on the 
S.L.C. to submit to them, at their Oct. 22 meeting, appropriate sanctions for the violations of university rules and regulations. 
If the SLC does not act by Oct. 22, the Trustees, working with the administration, would set ap­propriate sanctions, according to the letter. 

Student Body President John Barkett admitted that not all halls have a functioning judical system. He said that in some halls they purposely weren't called because members felt punitive punishment wouldn't work. He cited Morrissey Hall, during the time he was hall president, as an example. 
Barkett added that some halls regard judical boards as jokes. 
He disagreed with the idea of setting specific sanctions for violations of university rules saying, "It doesn't seem to be reasonable treatment to force a board to take this action in this case because it is specificed, some sort of guidelines might be possible in a general sense." 
"I think that the positions of rector and resident assistants is even a more unenviable one than they have been in the past. I'm hoping they will show the prudence and discretion fitting to the reality of the situation," the SBP stated, in response to the Trustees position. 
The Trustees stated that regarding "the preservation of a good academic atmosphere and the maintenance of high standards of Christian life across the campus,""When student self­discipline proves inadequate, however, Rectors and Resident Assistants, as senior members of this University community, must accept this responsibility themselves."

IRA bombs injure 39 people 1n Ulster 
Belfast, Northern Ireland, Sept. 2 -Six bombs exploded in downtown Belfast today within minutes of one another, injuring 39 persons and wrecking the ruling Unionist Party headquarters. 
It was the first time that the terrorist Irish .. Republican Army had hit such crowded areas in a daylight attack. Officials feared that today's bombings could mark the beginning of a new phase of activity against civilians. 
In only one caase was there a telephoned warning but by the time the anonymous call was received two bombs had exploded in a multistory parking garage, wrecking scores of cars and causing a fire. 
Six persons were injured when the first bomb exploded outside the front door of the Unionist Party headquarters, devestating the ground floor offices. A bomb planted there two weeks ago had failed to explode, and in March all the building's windows were blown out by a bomb . 
There were no politicians in the building at the time of the blast, although the building is usually frequented by Stormont cabinet ministers. 
Three minutes later the othzr three bombs exploded in quick succession, driving panic­stricken office workers from a recently-ilpened office building near the city hall. 
The injured, mostly suffering from shock and cuts from flying glass, were taken to two city hospitals. Only one man, who had

been trapped in his car at the bombed garage, was hospitalized. 
The explosions occurred just as office workers were beginnmg their lunch break, and activity in the center of the city halted as ambulances and fire engines converged on the bombed buildings. 
For the rest of the day store' and offices here received many hoax bomb warnings by telephone. Police believe the purpose of the calls was to throw the city into a state of panic. 
But as well as confusion there was anger on the streets. Trade union leaders at the Belfast shipyards, where most of the 10,000 woirkers are protestants, pleaded with thz men not to march in protest against what they assert are inadequate security precautions. 
British soldiers patrolled the city's streets in armored cars, but security at key buildings is minimal during thz day because the I.R.A. has usually struck at night. 
Prime Minister Brian 'Faulkner in a statement said the bombings were "the action of subhuman animals". He called on people to show their deter­mination not to submit to terrorism by joining one of the part-time security forces. The blasts are assumed to be the work of the provisional I.R.A., which had claimed responsibility for most of the recent bombinhs, including the daylight attack on the offices of the Northern Ireland Electricity Board a week ago which killed a man and in­jured 35 persons, many of them young girls who were disfigured for life.
