Ulster Catholics to stage march 
by Bernard Weinraub ((') 1!172 New York Times 
Belfast, Northern Ireland, Feb. 3 --Northern 
Ireland civil rights leaders today announced plans 
for a massive march this Sunday, one week after 13 
Homan Catholic men were killed by British soldiers 
during a protest demonstration in Londonderry. 
The march, which would be illegal, will take place 
in the town of Newry, bordering the Irish Republic. 
Prime Minister Heath of Britain made a dramatic appeal today to Prime Minister Lynch of the Irish Hepublic as well as to Roman Catholic church leaders in Ireland and England to use their in­fluence to have the march called off. 
At the same time, the British army's joint security committee in Northern Ireland, made up of senior officers and Protestant.political figures in the area, announced that firm measures would be taken against the demonstrators. All marches have been banned in Northern Ireland by Prime Minister f<'aulkner. 
Heath's unusual move in sending letters to Lynch as well as Cardinal Conway, the primate of all Ireland, and Cardinal Heenan, leader of the Catholic Church in England and Wales, underlined the fears of new violence in the explosive mood that now engulfs Northern Ireland. 
Today, at a crowded news conference in a Belfast Hotel, four young catholic leaders -all under 30 ­announced the details of what they said would be a silent march. 
"This is a nonviolent civil rights march," said Kevin Boyle, a former Queens University student here who has meticulously studied accounts of the Hev. Dr. Martin Luther King's march in Selma, Alabama, in 1965. "We are not searching for a confrontation with the army. It will be a peaceful 
<'erective demonstration unless, that is, the British government intends to use its army to conduct a massacre of peaceful demonstrators." He added: 
"It's typical of Tory attitudes that Mr. Heath addressed his remarks to Cardinal Conway and Cardinal Heenan. Our demands are not sectarian. They are civil rights demands, affecting everyone."

Freshman class sponsors dance Saturday night 
This Saturday night, February 5, the Freshman Class will sponsor a dance to be held on the second floor of the LaFortune Center from 8:00 to 11:00 pm. 
The band "Chapped Lips" will be featured. There will be $1.00 admission. Since the event will be limited to Notre Dame and St. Mary's freshmen, ID's must be presented. 
The dance is not primarily a fund raising event but is being held, according to Freshman Class Vice President Susan Schneider, as an "activity for the class." She added that more such events are being planned for the future. 
CRC outlines funding plans 
The Community Relations Commission of Student Govern­ment has announced plans to raise funds for the Youth Ad­vocacy Program of South Bend . The Commission will have a booth at the Mardi Gras carnival to sell Budweiser Tiffany Glasses filled with 48 hour scented Willwrick Candles with all profits from the sales going to Youth Advocacy. 
Dave Lah, Community Relations Commissioner, ex­plained that Youth Advocacy is a model action agency of the Youth Development and Delinquency Prevention Administration of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, and is under the direction of the Urban and Welfare, and is under the direction of the Urban Coalition and the Youth Coalition of St. Joseph's County. 
It consists of five major components to foster youth development and combat juvenile delinquency: 
I) Street Academy -A joint effort with the National Urban League to provide educational training in a flexible atmosphere for sixty school drop-outs over the age of sixteen. The relationship between delinquency and drop-out status has been well docurrrented; this segment of the program attempts to alleviate this problem by offering con­structive alternatives to juvenile crime. 
2lField Service Workers -To effect institutional change and make institutions more responsive to the needs of youth as perceived by youth via the Youth Coalition, six liaison workers have been placed with the South Bend Community School Corporation, South Bend Recreation Commission, Family and Children's Center, City­Country Government, Model Cities, and Youth Coalition (administrative assistant.) 

3) Counseling Center -A facility open from 9:00 a.m. to 
10:00 p.m., the Counseling Center employs a highly experienced staff to provide counseling and testing and vocational advice to walk-ins or referrals from community agencies. In-depth individual, family, and group counseling is being provided for youth referred from juvenile probation. 
4) Community Service Workers -Ten street youth attend youth functions arjd ride school buses in an attempt to prevent distur­pances and vandalism. 
Legal Assistant-A lawyer and two legal interns defend youth interests through class action suits and are in the process of developing a law curriculum for all levels of school students. 
Lah explained that in addition to these major components, Youth Advocacy and Youth Coalition anve initiated several projects to develop youth leadership and prevent juvenile crime. Among them include a

From the Editor's Desk 
Scorn when Scorn is Due 
Newton knew what he was talking about when he claimed that for every action there is an equal reaction. There was plenty of evidence to attest to the truth of tha ttheory in the letters pages of the Observer last week and this. It seems that an editorial ripping Sr. Alma, Acting President of St. Mary's upset a lot of people--particularly those who work for or with her. 
Their outrage is hardly a phenomena. Each institution has its share of official or unofficial apologists who are more than ready to sit down and crank out a protest to something that offends their sensibilities. That these protests should condemn the act in language remarkably similar to that used in the original, blasphemous, editorial is always a source of ironic amusement. So's the condescending remarks received from high administrators about how the editorial writer should learn the "facts of life''. 
Editorials cannot and should not be meekly worded or mealy mouthed when they are discussing a person or situation with whom they disagree. By doing so the writer cheats everyone--the readers, the people being attacked and himself. No one, after reading the monstrosity, can sure if the writer thinks the subject of his opprobrium is important enough to get excited about, or whether it is simply a piece written to fill up space. The person, or persons criticized reach the same conclusions--something they did offended the writer, but not that offending because the criticism was couched in the fawning platitudes that abound in American editorial writing. 
The editorial that doesn't take a strong stand, the editorial that doesn't state clearly and concisely the writer's feelings on the matter at hand isn't worth a damn. It is a meaningless ineffectual bit of boobery that could have, and probably was cranked out by a third rate hack, a hack similar to those who occupy the editorial chairs of most newspapers. 
An editorial can't take the safe middle ground, it can't compromise with reality and it can't vacillate. If a person needs to be ripped, and ripped badly, then so be it. If an institution deserves scorn and villifica tion then so be it. 
There is a place, occassionally, for editorials that praise someone or some thing. The type of editorials that radiate sunny optimism, cheer­fulness and happiness, should be aired from time to time. 
There isn't much place for these editorials when supposedly intelligent clerics are spitting venom at each other over a merger of two institutions, or when the word is out that a committee formed to search for a university Vice President will seek a yes man to placate the ego of another top official. 
Good things can and do happen at Notre Dame, but so do ugly things. They are the things that hurt Notre Dame and this paper intends to pursue them and heap scorn on them, whenever it can.

The Second Editorial-------­
Give Shelter 
Deborah Kerr 

There is a semblance of order in this community. There is the nr>arly predictable AC-DC decision-making gymnastics concerning issues of merger, co-education, dis-merger, co-ed dorms, merger. There are nine o'clock classes which will be attended providing the previous night's constellations were properly arranged in the heavens. There are papers which will be written, phone calls that will get made, books that eventually will be read. There is gambling to be done, there are friends who will meet for a drink, there are dates to be made, a few deadlines unfortunately looming. All is as it should be, the clock keeps ticking, "God's in his heaven and all's well on the earth." 
But in the midst of this order there runs a rampant clown with a tragic mask. He hardly entertains and rarely brings mirth. The community needs to be aware of him and needs to protect itself against him. 
It is a generally accepted fact that the St. Mary's-Notre Dame 
campus is a shelter from many of the colder facts of life. The women 
walk freely between dorms and classroom buildings at any hour, 
naively unescorted. The fact that this is a small, rather isolated area 
brings a small degree of security in this practice. It is the time for 
these women to consider incidents occurring on this campus and to act 
then with their own safety and best interests in mind. 
The hours kept by the average student are decidedly different than 
those kept by people outside the community. Coming in at 3:30 AM is 
hardly unusual, nor is it unusual for a woman, having her car at her 
disposal, to come in alone. It would not be very unusual for her to meet 
a young man while walking from the parking lot to the dorm and 
perhaps exchange a few words with him. The innocence of this ends, 
however, when the young man chooses to expose himself to her. 
The intrigue of the anonymous phone call begins with freshman year 
and continues, with decreasing frequency, through senior year. It has 
happened, on occasion that friendships have developed from the phone 
game. Perhaps one caller will call several times, giving an im­
pression of responsibility and good will. The game ends when a coed 
decides to meet the caller. He may ask her to come to the entrance 
alcove of the SMC Coffee Shop with him. When she refuses he forces 
her to come, abuses her, then exposes himself to her. Not a pleasant 
game after all. 
The merger, as most members of the community know, occurred 
years ago. Visitation, with or without official sanction, is common 
practice on the campus. It is less common, but still a practice, that 
men visit in women's dormitories. This can be brought about by 
merely opening a back door or window after hours. 
At a nearby, midwestern university such practice brought one more 
visitor than was expected. A coed, anticipating a visit from her 
boyfriend, propped open the back door to her dorm. While it was open, 
a man walked in and raped the coed's roommate in her room. 
Considering recent incidents, including at least three rapes on 
campus, this can hardly be dismissed with "It won't happen here." 
The security force cannot be everywhere at all times. The com­
munity must cooperate for the good of its members. If such openness 
and back-door hospitality is to continue as it has in the past, perhaps it 
is time to institute 24-hour open dorms for the safety of sister and 
brother students. 
During the recent fire in McCandless hall, not a serious yet a prime 
example, one brave young man chose to remain hidden in the dorm 
during the evacuation and subsequent fire-fighting procedures. This 
Promethean spirit evidently feared not the consequence of the fire 
which may have been more serious than suspected due to confusion in 
procedures concerning its extinction. 
With the inauguration of open dorms and the free use of only one 
entrance there would be no need for the fire escapes of Holy Cross, the

The honorable Potter Stewart, justice of the United States Supreme Court, will be one of the presiding jurists in the 22nd annual Moot Court competition at Notre Dame's Law School Saturday, February 5. The public is invited to the 8:30p.m. program in the Memorial Library auditiorium. 
According to Professor Peter Thornton of the Law School, the student directed competition will be actually "a mock appellate argument of the Calley case. The national case this year involves habeas corpus for a soldier convicted in the military-justice system and imprisoned for crimes in Viet Nam." 
The four top students of the Law School participants will prepare cases for both sides of the My Lai incident and present them to the jury. "The students will be judged purely on presentation and oral arguments," commented Thornton. "The ultimate ob­jective is to pick the top man." 
The two contestants with the highest scores will receive the Dean's Award. established in 1950 by former Dean Clarence Manion. First place prize will be $150 while $100 will go to the second-place finisher. Com­petition for the 1972 Moot Court began in the fall of 1970 with 30 participants. 
Third year law students par­ticipating in the finals of the Moot Court include Joseph R. McFadden, Jr., John H. Suminski, Dennis M. Tushla and Thomas L. Bodnar. McFadden, Suminski, and Tushla represented Notre Dame in the preliminary National com­petition in Chicago. Bodnar placed number one in the London competition in England last year. 
Joining Justice Stewart on the jury panel will be Judge Shirley Hufstedler of the United States Court of Appeals in Los Angeles and Justice Roger DeBruler of the Supreme Court of Indiana. 
Officers of the court are Paul L. Binder, Thomas P. Dovidio, Berry G. O'Connell, Kernan F. Cunningham, and Mark E. Morley.

They planned activities also including a dance, freshman movie night, and a concert trip. 
Except for the dance, scheduled this Friday in LaFortune, dates for other ac­tivities are uncertain. Yates indicated dates for other events will probably be spaced evenly throughout the semester. 
A newsletter for the freshman class will be circulated in dorms every week, according to Yates. The first one, printed this week, asserted that its purpose is "to keep the class informed about class activities."

An estimated forty colleges and universities are expected to participate in the 20th annual National Debate Tournament sponsored by the University at the Center for Continuing Education Friday through Sunday. Each school will enter one to three teams of varsity debaters in the competition for trophies and award certificates. 
Well known debate teams planning to attend include Dartmouth College, Nor­thwestern University, the University of Michigan, the

University of Wisconsin, Purdue, Duquesne, and Stonehill College of Massachusetts. 
The topic for debate this year is "Resolved: That greater controls should be imposed on the gathering and utilization of in­formation about U.S. citizens by government agencies." Each school will participate in eight rounds of debate on Friday af­ternoon and Saturday. Elimination rounds for the top sixteen teams will commence at 
10:30 Sunday morning and the final round is scheduled for 4:00 pm in the CCE auditorium. 
The public is invited to attend. Anyone interested in serving as a timekeeper for any of the rounds should come to the CCE on Friday or Saturday.

dining, which stated that "All Co-Ex dining tickets for ND students eating at SMC will remain at the Student Union Office." Caruso's release further said that he had not discussed the decision with the hall presidents, because "the hall presidents council has no jurisdiction over his program." 
However, since the Council is now in charge of distribution, Causo's office is no longer in existence. 
Under the new plan, the council plans to distribute 50 tickets apiece to two halls on a daily basis. In the past, 100 tickets had been given to one hall daily, but it was felt that 50 was a better number because, as Ellis said, "more tickets will be used on a given evening." 
The Observer plans to print in advance those halls which will be receiving meal tickets and their respective dates.
