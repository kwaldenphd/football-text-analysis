Judge limits gam.e parking 
By ANDREW THAGARD k<istant News Ediwr 
The St. Joseph Circuit Court issued an injunction Tuesday against eight residents of Wooded Estates, prohibiting them from charging fans to park vehicles on their property during Notre Dame home foot­ball games. 
According to the injunction, such behavior qualifies as com­mercial activity on residential property, violating Section 21-8 of the city code. along with sec­lion 21-99 that mandates sur­facing requirements for parked cars. The decision to park vehi­cles, according to some resi­dents of Wooded Estates, also constituted a safety issue. 
"We focused on this neigh­borhood in particular because Ithe residents] thought the quality of life and property val­ues were decreasing," said Ann-Carol Nash, assistant city attorney. "They were also con­cerned about safety." 
According to Nash. the city began an aggressive campaign two years ago to educate resi­dents that it was against the law to charge fans to park on their lawns. Neighbors of some

Training schedule conflicts result in termination

During resident assistant orientation, Sorin Hall lost half its HA staff due to conflicts the HAs had with their training schedule. 
Doug Pope and BJ Craig both had academic-related commitments which would have forced them to miss part of their multiple-day orientation. Craig and Pope both said they had signed contracts that stat­ed they were committed to attending all of the train­ing sessions.

University prioritizes diversity 
By SHEILA FLYNN 
News Writer 
Notre Dame, often criticized for its mostly-white student body, is a vocal supporter of affirmative action and would like to reach an ethnic minority population of' 25 percent within the next few years, said assistant provost for admissions Dan Saracino. 
"Our ollicial stance is wc'rn 100 percent supportive of' aflirmative action," Saracino said. 
The University has been extremely vocal about its support for affirmative action within the last year. during which the University of Michigan's admis­sions process was challenged in court for adding a significant number of points in the admis­sions process to students solely because they were ethnic minori­ties. Notre Dame signed a friend­of-the-court brief with about 37 other universities in support of Michigan's policies. 
"Even if there wasn't, however. affrrmative action as an executive order that was established in 1964, we would still be totally committed to affirmative action, whatever you would call it," Saracino said. 
"We are 100 percent in favor of diversity in the broad sense. whether it's ethnic. socioeconom­ic, geographic -all of those types of diversity. 
"Our commitment is to try to bring to this campus the brightest and the most diverse student body that we can." 
Saracino said the University does not compromise admissions standards for percentages and diversity. He said about 80 per­cent of applicants are fully equipped to handle Notre Dame academically, and the admitted students-ethnic minorities. ath­letes. legacies included -arc chosen from that qualified per­centage. 
"Look at the figures this year," he said. "We have the most diverse class in our history; at the same time, we have the most academically talented class in our history." 
He said, however. that Notre Dame undeniably gives special consideration to specific groups of applicants, and the University does not apologize for it. 
The children of alumni, for example, comprise 23 percent of' Notre Dame's student body. Saracino said admissions coun­selors give legacy applicants an extra "nudge" in the admissions process, but only if they are equally qualified with the other applicants. Such a family tradi­tion, he said, ensures the continu­ation of the Notre Dame family atmosphere. and also keeps the University's tinances stable.

Deja vu 
Just when you didn't think it could get any worse, it did. 
I'm referring, of course, to the lot­tery for Michigan football tickets that took place Wednesday at Recker's. 
Some of you may remember I tried in vain to acquire tickets to the Florida State game through the University last year. For those who don't, I 


rounded up And Th rd 
friends' ID cards rew aga and collected as many lottery tick­Assistant ets as possible for News Editor the chance to see the Irish play in Tallahassee, Fla. Unfortunately, I was among the 
several thousand Notre Dame, Saint Mary's and Holy Cross students who entered the lottery for the 150 tick­ets and didn't win. I also pulled an all-nighter in the basement of LaFortune in a vain attempt to get my hands on two of the half dozen unclaimed tickets several days later. 
I made it inside Florida State's Doak Campbell Stadium to see the Irish defeat the 'Noles last year, but I got in on a Florida State student ticket. 
I was annoyed last year by the small number of tickets available to students. Notre Dame receives sev­eral thousand tickets to football away games. The fact that they offer a measly 150 to students, the heart and soul of the Irish's fan base, just didn't seem right. 
This year, I'm still upset at the number of tickets that the University provides for students. What makes me even madder, however, is the system used for distributing this grossly inadequate amount. 
I waited for over an hour in a line that stretched outside of Recker's and wrapped around to Dillon Hall to move 15 feet. Shortly before 5 p.m., a representative came by to announce that Indiana State gam­bling laws mandated that the lottery end exactly three hours after it started. My friend and I checked out our position in line and realized we didn't have a prayer. 
Our fellow line mates told us that the Student Union Board-sponsored lottery was staffed by three people and was capable of processing one request at a time. As a newspaper reporter, I'd like to have verified this but the mob scene inside the Hospitality Room precluded me from getting close. I'll have to take their word for it. 
To have only three people staffing a line made up of hundreds of stu­dents, desperate to see one of the most hyped games of the season, is ridiculous. I can accept students' access to tickets being limited; I realize alumni and friends of the University are entitled to see a Notre Dame football game too. 
But please, don't waste our time with an inefficient lottery distribu­tion system. If the University can't guarantee those interested a ticket, they should at least give them a chance in the lottery.

Dutch find Baboon noses 

AMSTERDAM -Around 2,000 baboon noses were found packed in an aban­doned suitcase at Amsterdam airport when they started to stink, offi­cials said Wednesday. 
Dutch customs police made the gruesome discov­ery last week and turned the case over to the Agriculture Ministry's Inspection Service. 
Baboons are protected under international law. 
"We assume these ani­mals were killed, and we have to prevent something like this from happening again," spokesman Louis Steens said. He said the noses had been destroyed. 
The noses -around 66 pounds worth -were en route from Lagos, Nigeria, to the United States and are believed to have been meant to be eaten or used in tradi­tional medicine by immi­grants. Sportscar doubles as boat 
LONDON -Britain's newest sports car took a test drive Wednesday, zooming back and forth across the waters of the Thames River in pure James Bond style. 

The Aquada can hit speeds of 100 miles an hour on land -and once it hits water, the wheels retract into the wheel arch, jets kick in, and the car is sud­denly a boat. 
Once waterborne it can reach speeds of 30 miles per hour, according to Gibbs Technologies, the British firm that designed it. 
With a sticker price of about $235,000, the con­vertible has no doors in order to avoid leaks.

By MAUREEN REYNOLDS 
Associate News Editor 
The Student Senate met at its first meeting of the year Wednesday to discuss the primary issues they will be dealing with this year. 
Student body pr.esident Pat Hallahan spoke briefly to the Senate. outlining a few important issues. 
Hallahan told senators about the joint examination of the Student Union that will be taking place with the Executive Cabinet. He said that three separate commit­tees composed of members from both bodies will be looking into the Student Student Government and the student body as to how the University handled the rape allegations against the four former football players. 
"We do need to look at this and address it," Hallahan said. 
Speaking of the intent of the Student Government to make the Student Union a better-run organization, Hallahan continued, "It is only fair that if we're going to be bettering ourselves. that [the University] better [itself]."

SMC launches new e-mail interface 
By NATALE KACHUREK 
News Writer 
Saint Mary's will utilize a new e-mail interface called Aegis this fall. The switch will be made to better accommodate the level of e-mail traffic at the college and will offer many new and useful features to help facilitate com­munication and organization for the Saint Mary's community, according to an announcement made Tuesday. 
Most first-year students were introduced to Aegis last week in the mandatory Information Technology workshops and are already using the new system. 
Many returning students, how­ever, have doubts about making the switch. Already comfortable with the current interface and frustrated at the need to transfer address books, many say they do not see the need for change. 
Despite these doubts, Keith Fowlkes, director of Information Technology, claims that the tran­sition will be easy and the bene­fits will be worthwhile. 
"I promised the students last year that we would have a better e-mail interface," Fowlkes said. "That's why we upgraded the IMP interface. I wanted to keep my promise to the students." 
The Aegis interface will be faster, more intuitive and will have a more attractive look, Fowlkes said. It will offer advanced junk mail blocking capabilities for both students and faculty and the ability to easily share e-mail folders between users. 
There are also new corporate and personal address book interfaces. new "vacation mes­sage" options and the ability to easily change passwords. Fowlkes said. Aegis is fully com­patible with Netscape Mail, Outlook and Eudora email sys­tems. 
According to Fowlkes, one of the most innovative features of Aegis is its calendaring function. Users can create multiple calen­dars that can be integrated with e-mail to send reminders of upcoming events. Users will also have the option to share calen­dars for group organization or to keep them private for personal use. Information stored in Aegis calendars syncs seamlessly with Palm and Windows CE PDA's using free software available online. 
"I think they are going to love it," Fowlkes said. "The features and speed of this system are going to bring a whole new world of community to our cam­pus. It is our new 'e-community' and it will help us integrate. communicate and collaborate. I'm very excited about it." 
The deadline for students to switch to Aegis is Nov. 30. All address books and saved mail must also be transferred over by this date.

Saint Mary's College reconstructs CWIL

"In contributing financially, that helps keep the tuition lower than it would normally be, which then provides financial aid for those students, many of whom are minority, who cannot afford the place," Saracino said. "It's a very symbiotic relation­ship." 
Saracino said that, for as long as universities have existed, so have preferential admissions processes -for those who could pay, before financial aid; for athletes; for legacies; for the children of faculty and staff and other groups.

U.S. commander in Iraq on Wednesday symbolical­ly marked the transfer of control over the south­central part of the country to an international force led by Poland, hailing the handover as a sign of the international community's commitment to Iraq. 
In Baghdad, the interim Governing Council swore in members of the newly appointed 25-mcmber Cabinet that will begin taking over many of the day-to-day duties of gov­erning the country from the U.S.-led Coalition Provisional Authority. 
While military control was ceremoniously passed to the Poles, the handover of the holy city of Najaf was delayed at least two weeks after the car bomb­ing Friday outside the Imam Ali shrine that killed between 85 and 125 peo­ple, including leading Shiite cleric, Ayatollah Mohammed Baqir al­Hakim.

Elderly targeted with investment scam 
WASIIINGTON -Often living on fixed incomes and sometimes desperate about money, older investors arc being targeted with complex investment scams promising huge returns as the stock market churns and health care costs climb, state securities regulators say. 
The North American Securities Administrators Association is alerting seniors to the dangers of investment fraud and urging them to take control of their finances. The group, which represents state and provincial securities regulators in the United States, Canada and Mexico, was announcing Thursday new investor education programs and a senior investor resource center on its Web site. 
The regulators "are deeply concerned that a pnrfect storm for investment fraud is brewing and our nation's 35 million seniors are most at risk," said Christine Bruenn. the group's presi­dent, who also is Maine's securities administra­tor. "To a senior living on a fixed income, no amount or money lost is too small and could mean the dill'crence between a secure and dig­nified retirement or a life of uncertainty and despair."

OKLAHOMA CITY ­Former WorldCorn chief executive Bernie Ebbers is free on $50,000 bail as his attorneys and prosecutors debate the legal merit of charges that he violated Oklahoma securities laws.

Recall candidates, tninus Sch-warzenegger, hold first debate 
Bustamente justifies funding from Indian tribe 
Arnold skips debate, gets 
Associated Press 

WALNUT CREEK, Calif. -In the first debate of California's recall election, candidates vying to oust Gov. Gray Davis attacked front-runner Cruz Bustamante for accepting Indian casino money and connected actor Arnold Schwarzenegger to an adviser's unpopular remarks on property taxes. 
The skirmish came after a relaxed Gov. Gray Davis told a separate forum with reporters and voters that the recall effort had been an awakening and that he would fight to keep his job and repair the state's problems. 
Bustamante, the Democratic lieutenant governor who leads the most recent poll, was criti­cized for taking advantage of a loophole in campaign finance law that allowed a tribe to pledge $2 million to his financial­ly struggling campaign. 
Columnist Arianna Huffington, an independent, said Bustamante had made a mock­ery of campaign finance laws, which allowed him to circumvent new contribution limits by accepting the bulk of the money in an old campaign account. 
"This is nothing but legalized bribery," Huffington said. "Tell me how you really feel," Bustamante replied. 
He went on to say that he has been a longtime supporter of tribes and was proud of the sup­port he had received. 
Five candidates participated in the debate: Bustamante, Candidates qualified for the Huffington, state Sen.

Bustamante also said the pop­ular tax initiative should be retooled for commercial proper­ty, but Republicans McClintock and Ueberroth -who were in lockstep on a number of issues -said they would not touch the tax formula.

"It's like the Oakland Raiders saying to Tampa Bay, 'We know you beat us, but we want to play the Super Bowl again,"' Davis said. 

egged at speech at university 
Associated Press 

LONG BEACH, Calif. ­Arnold Schwarzenegger was a no-show at the initial debate of California's recall election Wednesday and delivered what was billed as his first major campaign speech, getting pelted with an egg as he waded through a crowd at a college campus. 
Unfazed when the egg hit his left shoulder, the action hero peeled off his coat and went ahead with a 15-minute speech in which he asserted that he is running for gover­nor to give something back to a state responsible for his success. 
"You have such a fantastic life, Arnold, you make mil­lions of dollars to do movies and all those kinds of things, why do you want to do this?" Schwarzenegger asked rhetorically. 
"And you know something, because everything that I've gotten -my career, my money, my family -every­thing that I've gotten and achieved is because of California," he said to cheers at California State University, Long Beach. 
Schwarzenegger said he wasn't bothered by the egging. "This guy owes me bacon now," he joked later. "I mean there's no two ways about it because, I mean, you can't just havP. eggs without bacon. But this is all part of. you know, the free speech." 
Several opponents from La Raza Student Association heckled Schwarzenegger at the speech for his past sup­port of Proposition 187, which sought to deny services to illegal immigrants. They held a sign saying "Hasta Ia vista Latinos," but supporters drowned out the hecklers with chants of "Arnold. Arnold. Arnold." 
Schwarzenegger's address came hours before the debate that featured five other can­didates in the race to recall Democratic Gov. Gray Davis. who was given 30 minutes at the outset to make his case. Schwarzenegger. a Republican, did not attend and has agreed to participate in only one debate, on Sept. 24. 
Political observers say Schwarzenegger's absence in the first debate could hurt him. 
"He's going to get beaten up for a while" for skipping the debate, said GOP strategist Allan Hoffenblum. "It's not that he's not going to debate, but he's going to do it at his own time."

Annan urges U.S. to accept treaty banning w-eapons testing 
A..sociated Press 
VIENNA-U.N. Secretary­General Kofi Annan and other diplomats appealed to the United States and other holdout nations Wednesday to ratify an international treaty banning nuclear weapons tests, saying the agreement would help the world achieve peace. 
The Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty is considered a critical clement in stopping the spread of nuclear weapons. since a testing ban makes developing such arms almost impossible. 
"The entry into force of [the treaty] would be a victory for the cause of peace," Annan said in prepared remarks. "It cannot come too soon." 
A dozen countries -includ­ing the United States -have declined to ratify the measure. 
U.S. 
senators who voted against the treaty in 1999 argued that ratifying it would've threatened national security by closing off 

U.S. 
options to test. 


President Bush, who also opposed the treaty, has pledged to continue long-standing U.S. policy not to conduct nuclear tests. However, the administra­tion is considering developing smaller-scale nuclear weapons. 
The Clinton administration led negotiations to convert a testing moratorium into a per­manent treaty in 1996, only to have the Senate reject it three years later. 
The Bush administration did not send a representative to

Wednesday's opening session of a conference on the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. 
"I believe it's clear that from the direction of the Bush administration, they would be happy for the [test ban treaty] to go away," said Rose Gottemoeller. a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. 
"The question is: Can they take the political heat for killing the treaty, with everything else they have on their platter?" 

The U.S. position jeopardizes the treaty itself. As one of 44 countries with nuclear power or research facilities listed in an annex to the treaty, the Americans must ratify the docu­ment or it will not take effect. 
The other holdouts are China, Colombia, Congo, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Iran, Israel, North Korea, Pakistan and Vietnam. 
The meeting came at a time of worldwide concern over North Korea and Iran. 
Amtrak w-ill receive $1.35 billion subsidy 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -Amtrak would get $1.35 billion in fed­eral subsidies next year under a bill approved Wednesday by a Senate subcommittee that gives the railroad more money than President Bush wants but less than Amtrak officials have said they need. 
The cash-strapped carrier has said $1.8 billion is neces­sary to retain existing levels of service, but critics want Amtrak to first drop money­losing lines and make other changes. Bush proposed only $900 million, the same amount included in a bill the House plans to consider this week, so Amtrak officials expressed relief at the Senate figure. 

"Amtrak is encouraged" by the Senate bill and will "look to Congress to provide an ade­quate level to fulfill our needs," said Amtrak spokesman Clifford Black. 
The bill would defer repay­ment, for an additional year, of a $100 million federal loan Amtrak received last summer. 
Separately, the Hepublican­led Senate rejected Democratic efforts to boost spending for disabled stu­dents, schools near military bases and llispanic youngsters as it worked slowly through a bill providing $137.6 billion for schools, health and labor programs for the budget year beginning Oct. 1.

an "ill-advised prosecution." 
The charge had outraged 
DEA officials. who said the vet­
eran agent acted in self­
defense last year while strug­
gling with a dangerous suspect. 
The suspect, Egbert Dewgard, 
was carrying more than six 
pounds of cocaine before he 
was killed. authorities said. 
The agent, Jude Tanella, 
"demonstrated restraint. sound 
judgment and courage in the 
proper exercise of his sworn 
duty to protect the public," U.S. 
District Judge Nicholas 
Garaufis wrote in his decision. 
District Attorney Charles 
Hynes said he was "surprised 
at the gratuitous nature" of the 
ruling, and planned to appeal. 
Garaufis had previously ruled the case should be heard in federal court. There -unlike state court -the agent's lawyers were allowed to argue he was immune from criminal charges because the shooting was the result of his federal duties. 
Prosecutors countered that deadly force was "inappropri­ate" because Dewgard was a suspect in a nonviolent crime, unarmed and trying to flee when he was shot May 1, 2002. 
Garaufis said the prosecu­tors' case was a "fanciful jour­ney" based on "remarkable assertions."

Anti-abortion activist executed for tnurder 
Associated Press 

STARKE. Fla. -Paul Hill, a former minister who said he murdered an abortion doctor and his bodyguard to save the lives of unborn babies, was executed Wednesday by injec­tion. He was the first person put to death in the United States for anti-abortion vio­lence. 
Hill, 49, was condemned for the July 29, 1994, shooting deaths of Dr. John Bayard Britton and his bodyguard, retired Air Force Lt. Col. James Herman Barrett, and the wounding of Barrett's wife out­side the Ladies Center in Pensacola. 
As he has since the slaying, Hill showed no remorse and urged abortion foes to use whatever means to protect the unborn. 
"If you believe abortion is a lethal force, you should oppose the force and do what you have to do to stop it," Hili said as laid strapped to a gurney in the execution chamber. "May God help you to protect the unborn as you would want to be pro­tected." 
Hill was pronounced dead at 
6:08 p.m., Gov. Jeb Bush's office said. 
Death penalty opponents and others had urged Bush to halt the execution, some of them warning Hill's death would make him a martyr and unleash more violence against abortion clinics. The governor said he would not be "bullied" into stopping the execution. 
Florida abortion clinics and police were on heightened alert for reprisals. Several officials connected to the case received threatening letters last week, accompanied by rif1e bullets. 
"Paul Hill is a dangerous psy­chopath," said Marti McKenzie, spokeswoman for Dr. James S. Pendergraft, who runs clinics in Orlando, Ocala, Tampa and Fort Lauderdale. 
Outside Florida State Prison, extra law enforcement officers, explosives-sniffing dogs and undercover officers were in place to prevent protests from getting out of hand. About 50 abortion and death penalty foes quickly left following the execu­tion as rain fell and lighting struck near the prison. 
Hill, a former Presbyterian minister, had final visits with family members and his reli­gious adviser stayed with him until just before the execution. 
Since losing his automatic appeals, Hill has not fought his execution and insisted up to the day before his death that he would be forgiven by God for killing to save the unborn. 
"I expect a great reward in heaven," he said in an inter­view Tuesday, during which he was cheerful, often smiling. "I am looking forward to glory." 
Fringe elements of the anti­abortion movement that con­done clinic violence have invit­ed attacks on Web sites that proclaim Hill as a martyr. Members of the mainstream anti-abortion movement have denounced the calls for vio­lence. 
Most abortion clinics in Florida reached by The Associated Press on Wednesday declined comment. 
Court prevents FCC rule application 
Federal appeals court rejects allowing monopolization of media 
Associated Press 
PHILADELPHIA -A federal appeals court Wednesday issued an emergency stay delaying new Federal Communications Commission rules that would allow a single company to own newspapers and broadcast outlets in the same city. 
The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said the community­radio advocates who sued would suffer irreparable harm if the new rules were allowed to go into effect as scheduled Thursday. 
The new media ownership rules, which the FCC approved in June on a party-line, 3-2 vote, also would allow a single company to own TV stations reaching 45 percent of the nation's viewers.

court by the Prometheus Radio Project, a Philadelphia-based coalition of media access groups that campaigns for greater radio access and helps groups seeking to establish low-power radio stations. 
"Given the magnitude of this matter and the public's interest in reaching the proper resolu­tion, a stay is warranted pend­ing thorough and efficient judi­cial review," a three-judge panel of the appeals court wrote in its brief opinion. The judges did not comment on the merits of the complaint. 
An attorney for the Prometheus Project, Samuel L. Spear, praised the decision. He said his clients believe their ability to broadcast will be hurt by the growth of media con­glomerates. 
The FCC decision "just allows the big media companies to

Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., who, along with Mississippi Republican Trent Lott has been leading a group of senators trying to undo all the FCC changes, said the court's ruling "will give a boost to our efforts." 
"The ruling recognizes what I hope most of the Senate rec­ognizes: These rules are inap­propriate," Dorgan said in an interview. 
Blair Levin, a former FCC official who is an analyst with the Legg Mason investment firm, said the stay probably will have little immediate impact because congressi9.nal opposition to the looser owner­ship rules led media compa­nies to put most of their plans on hold. 
The ownership rules also face other challenges. 
The National Association of Broadcasters wants fewer restrictions on media owner­ship. The influential industry group filed an appeal last month to block changes to how radio markets are defined and overturn rules that still prevent TV station mergers in some smaller markets. 
Critics of easing ownership restrictions had asked the FCC to suspend the rules while the agency studied their impact on communities. FCC Chairman Michael Powell, one of the three Republicans who backed the new rules, had said that although the commission is examining ways to promote local programming, that issue should be addressed separately from the ownership rules.

just remember the laughter. 
If. when I first decided to try stand­up comedy, I had any idea how many times I would be asked in future years what prompted me to do it, I would have kept a detailed record of my mental state. In fact, as my first performance approached, the image of the stage expanded to fill my men­tal horizon; I could think of nothing after the show. For several weeks afterwards I could think about noth­ing before it. 
I simply have no recollection at all of what was going through my mind when I signed up to perform at Oxford's Burton Taylor Theatre. But I have no problem remembering why I got on stage the next time, and every time after that. 
Like nicotine, the laughter of st1·angers is addictive from the first taste. Except that you don't so much taste the crowd's laughter as feel it, just as the bass shakes your whole body when you stand near the speak­ers at a rock concert. 
Richard Lewis once called stand-up a legal drug, but that is only half right. There is no real skill involved in getting high from drugs. You just inhale, inject, swallow or snort and then wait for the effects to take you. All it takes is money and a certain degree of indifference 'towards your future health. Stand-up isn't like that. 
You have to make the audience laugh, and that requires talent, and even for the most talented comedian there are no guarantees. 
Professional comedians will report that sometimes a joke that has reli­ably induced mass hysteria in audi­ences around the country for months will one day simply, inexplicably, fail to get a response. Suddenly, the comedian is on stage, feeling alone, abject, alone, humiliated and so very, very alone. We've all had the dream in which we arrive at high school only to discover that we are naked. This experience is worse and come­dians have a name for it. We call it "death." 
So, why take the risk? It's hard to explain the feeling you get when your 

routine goes well. In "It's the possibility of "Are you any good," 
trying to explain, one failure, the possibility an inquiry which faces the danger of puts me in the awk­
that things could go

go right."
sports. But I'll take the risk: it's the possi­bility of failure, the possibility that things could go wrong at any moment, that makes it so exhilarat­ing when they go right. Besides, in extreme sports you can only die once. 
But for me, and I suspect for most comedians, what really makes the stage irresistable is the wonderful feeling of connection that comes from discovering, again and again, that the things you find funny other people find funny too. That's why the account of what motivates comedians that I like best of all is the one given by Bill Hicks in an interview shortly before his death: "I thought the whole point of it was to make you feel unalone." I don't know whether when Hicks said "you" he was talking about the comedian or the audience. I like that it could have been either one. 

Sometimes strangers approach me after a show to tell me that they enjoyed the performance. I've always been thrilled by this, except after one gig in New Jersey when someone said to me "Hey man. that was great, your accent makes you really funny." I had worked hard on my routine, not my accent, and I couldn't help thinking that his compliment was somewhat diluted by the fact that there are approximately 60 million other people to whom it could equal­ly apply. 
When people find out that I do stand-up, they often have questions 
about it. By far the 
most common is 

gant or masochis­tic. I usually get out of the dilemma by feigning a seizure. 
I am telling you all this as an in vi­tation. This semester I will be host­ing. along with Michael Bradt. a series of stand-up shows at the new Legends club. We have some experi­enced performers lined up for the shows, but I will also be running workshops for anyone who would like to perform but has never done it before. If that's you, let me know.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Be grateful for food 
In rnspons1~ to Kamaria Porter's Sept. 2 column "An Unhappy Day for Labor," I want to emphasize her mention of the dining hall as a crucial plan~ to practice social justice. Whenever I work on thn South Dining 1!all dish line, I am ashamed of the slwor quantity of food WI) throw away. Good fortune and pros­p!~rity shouldn't be flaunted so vulgarly. parlictllarly at a univer­sity that is eonrwclPd by the universal Church to the universal poor.

Maylw WP rolled our eyes when our mothers nagged us to cl('an our plates, but it is definitely an insult to the starving to art like the crazed. happily vomiting banquetnrs of the crum­bling Homan Empire instead of inoll'ensive people eating dinner. UnfortunatPiy. this does not exaggerate our extravagance­come cheek it out sometime. 
In addition to being basically a taunt to the undernourished, wasting food is an affront, subtly but truly, to a whole slew of otlwr pnoph~. Food doesn't materialize magically. Well-loved land is alt1~red, farmers struggle, animals die, laborers sweat in finlds and factories to prod ucc commodities for a noble purpose and that purpose is not to keep the dumpster people in busi­rwss. They want to feed us; that's their vocation, so let's eat. 
It isn't ol'ten that we can make a radical difference without paining oursPlvns. Additional steps are simple too, such as par­ticipating in Wednesday Lunch Fast to benefit the hungry. And ewn if that isn't a concern at this Catholic university, we should lislPn to our deeply sufl'ering wallets. Less food wasted means Food Services buys less which means less increase in room and board. Amen to that. right'!

Questioning ticket distribution 
As a self-proclaimed Notre Dame super fan, I considered it my duty to try and get tickets to the Michigan game. After striking out with friends that go to Michigan, I was pretty happy when I learned Tuesday night that there would be a ticket lottery Wednesday afternoon. I thought that this was short notice, but that I'd definitely be in line. 
After reading the Wednesday edition of The Observer. I became somewhat confused. An ad said that the 
only at Reekers. 
So I got in line behind South Dining llall right at 3 p.rn. Now one of the new twtsts on this year's ticket lottery was that a per­son could carry as many !D's as they wanted; as opposed to evuy other event that I can remem­ber at Notre Dame where a person could only carry two to six ms. 
So throughom this afternoon, dozens of people would jllst walk up to the line, give their lD to a friend, and leave despite the fact that hundreds of us had been waiting there for hours. Around 5 p.m. one of the workers came outside to notify us that the lottery would be shutting its doors at 
6:07 p.m. due to NCAA rules stating that a ticket lottery can only last for 3 hours. 
Since I was standing about 3 feet from the door into Hecker's, I figured that I could make it 3 feet in an hour. So the minutes slowly ticked away and it was suddenly 6 p.m. All of a sudden, we started hearing from people ahead of us in line that the doors wouldn't be shutting at 6:07, the actual lottery would be shutting down. We figured this had to be a misunderstanding. 
But sure enough, 6:07 rolled around and as I

I'm sure that Toby's years of study and research has led him to his findings and beliefs on such topics. 
Darryl Worley asks if we've forgotten bin Laden. Worley's pro-war anthem attempts to remind w; about 9-11 (which is not wholly bad) and alludes to a connection between the al Qaeda attacks on our country and the potential lor Iraq to attack us.

Maybe one of his good repub­lican buddies (pro-Bush, pro-war, anti-reality) told Darryl. with some assuredness, that Iraq and the a! Qaeda were connected and a preemp­tive strike should be enacted before they (Iraq) get a chance to bomb us. 
Any semi-educated person who believes in doing re!>earch from sources other than CNN, Fox NBws -the biggest joke in "media" -or their local paper might be led a little closer to the truth. 
For example, one might only look at the state­ment bin Laden made about Hussein's religious practices. Bin Laden said Hussein was a bad Muslim. That's about the equivalent ofsaying, "I hate Baptists!" here in Oklahoma. 
What kind of reaction would a public figure garner from such a statement andhow would the followers of said targeted person or group respond to the person who had said such things? 
Well, it is highly doubtful that any of them would be good buddies and plotanother coun­try's demise. 
Granted, this is only one example though many others exist. 
I'm not suggesting that freedom of speech be suspended. I'm saying that if someone (especially celebrities) is going to say something potentially politically inflaming, they should at least be well­informed.

Consider Sean Penn's faux-political ramblings. lie's generally too high to even know what day of the week it is. How can anyone take him serious­ly? 
How about the Dixie Chicks? Where do they get off saying that they are embarrassed (though they really might be) that the president of our country is from Texas without showing some sort of backup? They presented no reason to hold the convictions that they do. 
Unless a band or any other celebrity has some form of political background, they should keep quiet lest they influence the equally stupid ofour society.

I could let some of these things slide if this was a "first come, first serve" ticket giveaway. Last week I missed out on Purdue tickets because I didn't get to the line at 6 a.m. like my buddies did.

Putting a humble man on a pedestal 
Rich Mullins' new biography shares a life dedicated to sharing his gift of music and his love ofan awesome God 
By BECCA SAUNDERS 
Scene Writer 

Rich Mullins is a name that most know and nearly everyone recognizes as famil­iar. Whether heard in passing conversa­tion, on the radio or at church, the name Rich Mullins is one that is heard all over the country, even all over the world. 
Rich Mullins is known for many things, but above all he is known for his work as a contemporary Christian singer and songwriter. In his biography, Rich Mullins, His Life and Legacy: An Arrow Pointing to Heaven, by James Bryan Smith, a long-time friend of Mullins, the life of Rich Mullins is laid out in an hon­est and sincere narrative. Mullins is known for his immensely popular songs (including "Awesome God," "The Love of God," "That Where I Am, There You May Also Be"), but this guide on Mullins' life aids in viewing the deeper and touching person that Rich Mullins truly was in his entirety. 
James Bryan Smith, a good friend whom Rich rented a room and lived with for over two years, is credited for pen­ning this book. Smith's writing is mediocre at best. The story of Rich Mullins is more than enough to make the novel flow fluidly; the most difficult parts of the novel to get through are Smith's often excessively long commentaries. Smith makes it clear throughout the book that, above all things, Mullins was a humble man who was the first to pro­claim himself a sinner. As such, the per­sistent reverent and admiring tone that Smith utilizes to describe Mullins is almost inappropriate for the biography. From the true stories of Rich's life and the many quotations from him through­out the book, it becomes apparent that, in reality, Mullins probably would not have wished for this book to be written about him in such a manner. Above all else, Mullins was humble, and Smith's style of writing in this biography places Mullins up on a very high pedestal, the very place that Mullins would have likely wished to avoid. That being said, it is important to point out the difficult task it would be to write a book about the life and views of Rich Mullins without him ending up on a pedestal in the reader's mind by the completion of the biography. 
Although the actual writing of the biography is lacking, the book itself is extremely engaging. The book basically tracks the life of Rich Mullins beginning with his childhood in Virginia and Indiana and ending with his death in a tragic car accident in 1997. The novel is biographical, but also is very much a Christian-based reading as it shares many of Mullins' Christian philosophies and opinions throughout the novel. Rich was ecumenical in the highest sense of the word. While growing up Protestant, he loved going to church. At one time, he almost became Catholic, but decided against it in an attempt to remain truly ecumenical and focus sincerely on Jesus. Mullins was famous for "burning peo­
ples' sacred cows" 
when he would per­
form and various dif­
ferent types of church­
es. 
As a child, Mullins 
was a bit of an outcast, 
and after failed 
attempts at athleti­
cism, he accepted his 
gift of music. He began 
performing in church­
es and for small gath­
. erings and eventually 
began a band called 
Zion, of which he was 
one of the four mem­
bers. Mullins weht 
through many phases 
in his life and eventu­
ally moved to an 
Indian reservation in 
the Southwest where 
he began a group 
called the Kid 
Brothers of St. Frank. 
·This group was based 
on many of the teach­
ings of St. Francis, 
whom Mullins was a 
great admirer of and 
very interested in. 
Mullins and the other 
members of the Kid 
3rothers dedicated 
their lives to service 
and praye~ 
Throughout the book, 
Mullins' life journey is 
depicted and accom­
panied by entertain­
ing stories of the truly redemptive life of Rich Mullins. He always felt that he was not worthy of the awesome love that God provided him with, and that he, like everyone else, was a sinner. The beauty of Rich Mullins was that he embraced his sin­fulness and then turned and gave it all back to God. He never claimed to have any of the answers; he simply pointed people directly toward God as their answer, remaining, as clichr as it may ne, a true "arrow pointing towards heaven." 
This biography does not fit neatly into any one subject matter; it covers so many of the aspects of an ordinary man's life who did extraordinary things with his God-given tal­ents. The story of Mullins is inspiring even at its lowest points. Mullins was a man, not a myth, and he never hoped or wanted to be known as anything more than simply a man. He had an incredible way of re111ly being able to break down the character of Jesus as human, just as Mullins was and we all are humans. The human aspect of Jesus is one that many people, when they begin to really focus on it, aren't very c'omfortable with. This view of Jesus fas­cinated Mullins, inspiring him and work­ing through him to all of the people he touched through his example and life. Whether people think "Awesome God" is the greatest or the most annoying con­temporary Christian song in existence, this book should be read. It is interest­ing, inspiring and, at times, hilarious. Mullins was many things in his life. Above all else, he was a messenger for a power he never felt worthy to serve, and by living as such, showed many people, and continues to show many people today, the correct way to direct your life: up.

Faber's racy idea of Sugar 
Michel Faber writes a scandalous novel from the viewpoint of a Victorian London "working girl" called Sugar. 
By MOlLY GRIFFIN 
Scene Wrirer 
After a long school year consisting of what seems like endless reading, most students throw in the literary towel over the summer and try to forget that thny exist (a similar policy is held with regard to du Lac). Though it is an understandable situation, students can miss out on reading books which might not appear on a school assigned reading list and whose literary merit is somewhat on the sketchy side. 
Contrary to popular opinion, not every novel read during the summer or outside of the classroom has to be by Danielle Steele or John Grisham in order to be scandalously good. 
The Crimson Petal and the White, by Michel Faber, is well-written enough to avoid being insulting or childish and still deals with subject matter capable of making Jackie Collins blust-.. 
The book chronicles the rise of a prostitute in Victorian London from the scum of the gutter to the fringes of respectability, but this doesn't mean that it skimps on the good parts. With the right blend of scandal, atmosphere and character, this book will bring back your desire to read just when your textbooks had made you question the merits of being literate. 
When the protagonist of a book is named Sugar, you can feel fairly cer­tain that it. won't show up on one of your academic reading lists or in a Core discussion this semester. 
Faber quickly squashes the stereo­typical view of Victorian London as a realm composed entirely of eloquent gentlemen and socially graceful women in his book. Whores with few inhibitions and the lecherous men who keep them in business dominate the landscape of the novel, and this pic­turesque backdrop sets the scene for the story of Sugar, the quintessential "hooker with a heart of gold," whu certainly is no Julia Hoberts. 
Sugar is an author who has devoted her life to composing a novel about the realities of prostitution and the evils of men, in which her protagonist perpetrates acts of violence against the very men who have caused her life so much pain. ller writing allows her an outlet for her emotions without interfering with her ability to earn her livelihood, but, like most diaries or pieces of writing that cling to closely to the truth, it eventually gets her into trouble. 
The grim reality of life on the street, not only for prostitutes but other des­titute individuals as well, contrasts with the fa«;ade of beauty that the extreme upper echelon of wealth resides in. Sugar's ability to survive 
and adapt in both the slums and the mansions makes her an extremely interesting char­acter that would have made Darwin proud. The con­trasts between grim redlity and constructed fanta­sy, as well as between chastity and unabashed sexuality, makes the novel difficult to predict and even harder to put down. 
Sugar's rise from the oppres­sion of living in the gutter to the different but equally repressive arena of respectability begins when she meets a sexually and economically frustrated busi­nessman named William Hackham. The only reason William is in line to take over his family's perfume company results from the fact that his older brother. IIenry, passed on the opportunity to spend time fur-thering his spiritual life. 


On top of his economic woes, William Hackham's wife, Agnes, is mentally unsound and begins to lose her ability to hide it from polite socie­ty. (Agnes' outbursts of insane impro­priety are just as interesting as any of Sugar's "business" activities.) 
Sugar begins her assent above the other girls in her profession because of her uncanny knack for industrial business, as well as her proficiency in business of other kinds. William slow­ly comes to depend on Sugar as an advisor, confidante and lover, but she grows wary of her loss of independ­ence and street sense that results from her love of William and his luxu­rious lifestyle. 
Sugar eventually gains more r6spectability as she becomes the gov­erness to the Rackham's daughter, Sophie, but her meteoric rise up the social ladder comes to an abrupt halt as she finds herself emotionally entan­gled with all three members of the 
... 

Rackham family and must make a choice about where her loyalties lie. 
The Crimson Petal and the White provides interesting insight into the lives of prostitutes and their reasons for joining such a stigmatized profes­sion. It also permits insight into tan­gled web of deciphering between sex and love. The difl"iculties in eradicat­­ing prostitution are explored, and with that, it looks at human culture's fasci­nation with prostitutes. 
The book may not always paint a pretty picture, but it is a deeply absorbing story with enough scandal and intrigue to keep one reading until the last page has been turned. It's a fairly hefty tome but worth the time required to read it. Don't let required reading stamp out your desire to enjoy other books, especially trashy, scan­dalous novels about prostitutes in the back allies of history.

I experienced it and so did the Men of Zahm 
by Fr. Richard Warner, c.s.c. Director, Campus Ministry 

Last Satul'day, seven young men pronounced their perperual vows as Holy Cross religiou,,, and <m Sunday, 
thev were ordai.ned as deacons. lt1 fewer rhan six monrh.~, these new deacons will be ordained 3$ Holv Cros~ 
pri~sts. 1\s I participated in rhe M3$ses celebrating their final profe~ion and ordination 3$ deacons, I 
amid nor help but think about them and their commitment, and about rhe simation our Catholic ChuKh in the 
United States h;~s been experiencing for the past e.ighteen months. 

A relativ-ely few r u:nber of bishops and priests have caused grave scandal because of engaging in se.xuai 
misconduct with minors, often years ago, bur which is only coming to light now. Many Catholic pcopk remain 
tirm in rheir faith be.:a~.~-~e ir is so well grounded and probably bemuse the priests they have known have se.rved 
them fJirhfull}~ But I real~ that there are other faithful believers who are scandalized, and probably hJve 
ditanced themselves from rhe Church. 

The primary pers,,ns who suffer moH from ~ual abuse are the victims themselves. But there are other 
significant ronsequences for all of us as well. 

We have many wonderful bishops and priests in our mum:ry, and numerous lay people who serve our 
Church generously and well. Millions uf fairh-flllcd beli~vers perform acts of charity and love thar are known to 
God alone. 

Our bishops have always been a voice tor developing, promoting and upholding publicly. mor-.t! positions 
which are ofi:e-!, ar odds with a process of~eculari:zatio11 which erodes our basic core values as a people. Some 
ex.ampb include their documents on war and peace, and on economic justice in the 1980's, their letter on 
homosexuality entitled '1\ll Our Children," and their opposition of welfare reform thar would lc:we too m;my 
poor people . .:specially single mmhers, without possibilities for a decem life. Today some bishops are hounded bv 
neg;ltil'e anide.1 in the press. Others appear to be so consumed with the scandal and its consequences that their 
voice has been muted at a critical moment in our historv. 

A~ a result, there has been le.ss guidance than our co~nrry needs with regard ro the new concept of a preemp· 
rive war, such as the one we are waging in Iraq and Afghanistan. At a time when the family structure is w1dc:r 
extr-aordinary stress, and same sex unions are all but equated to the sacrament of matrimony from a legal 
perspect:ive, our Church's guidance is absent. When citizens' rights deeply imbedded in our civic tr-Jdition and 
laws are under e:nreme pressure, no mor-o~l voice is raised to question the legal appropriateness of indefmite 
detention without ~·[urges being filed or combatant rights respected. A new ethnic profiling of people is under­
way, who often only thre-o~tenus because they look more like our enemies than they do like us, without a call t(>r 
l~girimate evenhandedness. And as a dehate rJges about how our senior citizens can receive the health care that 
they need and deserve, a moral and ethical perspective is nor part of the national deb;lte. 
We love our faith, our Church and the Christian Community we form at Notre Dame. I be!ic:ve we 
acknowledge our need for the Church's guidance so thar we can live our lives in conformity to rhe Gospd. We 
understand how many currents in our .~ocic:ty and culture are misguided, and will lead us uway from what we 
believe and profess as people of fJ.ith. 

We know that the Cadw!ic Church i.~ a major provider ofsocial services in our munrry and will be for years to rome. The Carbolic Church has always been and is today a leader in the moral education of young p~ople cl1mugh the Catholic School system, and is often best prepared to provide hope for inner-city youd1. Notre D,1me's Alliance for Catholic Education is rhe leading voice in tbis area. Through Caritas and Catholic Relief Se!·vi<:cs, the Catholic Church pmVide.s scores of milliom of dollars tor rhe needy poor in every coun uy; food, healrh care, housing, education. 
These aspects about the Church and its presence in our counrry and in the world are r~rdy mcutioned in the rhousands of column inches in important newspapers which have besmirched our Church daily and each one of u.~, visiting the sins of the few on the many. 
lr is Je.m~ Christ: who hrings hope and happiness and life to us and to all people. He assures us that no evil will ultimately prevail againsr rhe Church ti.Junded on the apostles, despite the weakne..~s and sinfulnes. of his disciples, tor He is with us. The Church in our counrry today needs dis<:iple.l who will scand up for whar rhory­believe and who will act 011 dl(~it beliefs. 
Wirhin tbis comexc, seven young men pronounced rheir fmal vow.~ as Holy Cross religious on SarLJrday. lt was a very special moment. In years p3$t, when people pronow1ced their vows, rhere was always em.hu.,iastic :l.pplause. On Saturday, it w;~s truly overwhelming. The applause, including a standing ov-ation for these men. lasted fm a long time. If you doubt this, ask one of the t'i\'0 hundred young men from Zahm who were chcre to celebrate with their rector,Dan Parrish, who Wil$ professing fmal vows. 'W'11ac happened at rhe Basilica Sarurday was a11 enormous acr of faith, and an important 01nd uplifting moment for all of us: for the Catholic Church, for Holy Cross and for Notre Dame. · 
Seven young men said "yes.'' They committed themselves to a life of apostolic servia:: for you, for me: and for all the people their lives will much for decades to come. 
Our Church today cannot aftord to lose one single vocation to religious life or to the priesthood beG!usc of the ..::risi;;. A vocation is not a concept. It is a c.UI to a faith-filled, energetic, idealisric young man or woman who wants to follow Jesus without reserve. Iftbi.!i is you, discern the call well. If you are called to be a rdigiou.1, become a re!igiou.~. If you are called to be a priest, become a priest. 
Our Church today cannot afford to lose one lay man or one lay woman who can serv.:-in the multiple ministries available to all the haprir,ed., whether through participation in rdigious education or the ministries surrounding the Eucharist or any other leadership opportunity. If this is you, discern rbe call well and do it. 
You ;md I have to redoubt~ our efforts ro live our lives according ro the Gospd and the life of Jesus Christ... to draw stren.gd1 from one another as we celebrate Eucharist together; to be people of the Beatitudes in the way we live; to continually seek to root sin out of out lives and to seek sacr-o~mental reconciliation wh.:n we sin. Many things in our life are beyond our control. Buc a firm decision about how we speak and act as a result ofour faith in Jesus is our decision al<me.

"I don't plan on talking going into this game. I plan on play­ing," Favre said. 
Aside from their postgame spat in D1~ccmber. the two have 1wvnr spoken to each other off tlw lkld. 
"''vn n1wer had the chance," llovan explained. "lie's been to Pro Bowls and I haven't. So, maybn one year I'll be able to s1~n him out there. But. the only tinw we get to talk is on the linld." 
And it's usually more H-rated than this. 
Favre said he considers Hovan 
among the best defenders in the 
NFL. 
"You have to account for a guy like Chris. Warren [Sapp]. I Brian I Urlacher, Derrick Brooks and so on," Favre said. "Now. for me. personally, I don't go up against !Iovan. But Dur oll'ensive linemen know it's a huge chal­lenge for them. lie's not the only player on their team. But he is a relentless player who never quits." 
Despitn all the happy talk this week, fresh in the minds of play­ers from both teams is the side­line scuffle that erupted last year when Darren Sharper needlessly returned a game-end­ing interception toward the end zone. zigzagging his way down­lield instead of falling down. 
Afterward, while Favre and Hovan were getting into it in the south end zone, several players were scufl1ing ncar the Vikings' bench in a brawl that resulted in six players being fined a total of $40,000. 
Given the bad blood. many faps arc wondering if Hound 2 between Favre and Hovan is coming Sunday. 
"We're going over to play a football game," Vikings coach Mike Tice said. "''m not Don King. We're not going over to have a boxing match." 
Favre, who has started 190 consecutive games. said he's not worried about taking a cheap shot from Hovan. 
"I would seriously doubt that he would ever go after someone intentionally," Favre said.

Two matches of 108 played at rainy U.S. Open

Associated Press 
women finish fourth-round night and four that never even Sugiyama was leading where we're going to play." 
NEW YORK-Here's an indi­cation of how desperate every­one is for tennis at the rain­soaked U.S. Open: The smat­tering of fans on hand for Lindsay Davenport's quarterfi­nal against Paola Suarez applauded the prematch coin toss. 
Alas, when the warmup fin­ished, the court was too wet, and the players walked off. 
They never got a chance to hit a shot, and by the evening, that was the case in all but two of Wednesday's 108 scheduled matches. 
Top-ranked Kim Clijsters took a 3-0 lead over No. 5 Amelie Mauresmo in their quarterfinal before it was stopped because of bad weath­er. Mauresmo had 10 unforced errors -one for each minute they played. 
Eventually, that match was postponed until Thursday along with all others except two fourth-round encounters organizers hoped to sneak in if the weather cleared: No. 4 Andy Roddick against Xavier Matisse, and No. 8 Rainer Schuettler against No. 12 Sjeng Schalken. Roddick and Matisse started playing on Arthur Ashe Stadium at about 9:15p.m. 
"This is a rolling calendar at this point, which is changing by the hour," said Arlen Kantarian, the U.S. Tennis Association's chief executive for professional tennis. "We continue to make our best effort to complete this tourna­ment on time. We are deter­mined to make the best of a very difficult situation." 
If Thursday is a washout, the men's final could be played next Monday, Kantarian said. The last time that happened at the U.S. Open was 1987; Goran Ivanisevic beat Patrick Rafter on a Monday to win the 2001 title at Wimbledon. 
A total of three matches were completed Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday. 
"It hurts everyone. It hurts the players, it hurts the fans, it hurts the TV network, it hurts the sport," TV analyst John McEnroe said. 
The rain kept coming Wednesday night, with more in the forecast. The likelihood of finishing the event by Sunday grew slimmer, and Kantarian, tournament referee Brian Earley and other officials met with representatives of the ATP Tour, WTA Tour and TV broad­casters for 2 1/2 hours. 
They drew up a tentative cal­endar to complete the tourna­ment by Sunday, adding a night session Friday. The schedule matches Thursday afternoon, then play a quarterfinal Thursday night. And some men would have to play four match­es in four days. 
"If they actually played four matches in four days, in the fourth or even the third one, it would be impossible for them to be at their best," McEnroe said after trying to entertain the paying customers by hitting balls into the seats at Arthur Ashe Stadium. 
The Clijsters-Mauresmo match was supposed to start at 11 a.m., but they didn't hit a ball in anger until nearly three hours later. 
At the changeover after the third game, with a light mist falling, Earley came out to check the court. He and the chair umpire slid their feet along the white lines to see how slippery it was, while Mauresmo draped a towel over her shoulders, and Clijsters donned a jacket to try to stay warm. 
"It's almost completely stopped," Earley said to the chair umpire, holding his palms up to check for rain­drops. "Do you feel it? I feel just the tiniest mist." 
Then, a few minutes later, Earley said to both players: "If you go back to the locker room, can I get you fairly quickly? You can go into my office if you like. How quickly can you get out here? 1\vo minutes? Three minutes?'' 
Mauresmo and Clijsters both nodded, gathered their things and left the court, serenaded by boos, whistles and jeers from the few thousand fans on hand. 
At least they made it onto a court -and already are in the quarterfinals. 
So, too, is Andre Agassi, the only man with a spot in the final eight secured, because his match against Taylor Dent ended Tuesday night when Dent quit with a leg injury. Otherwise, there were three men's fourth-round matches started. 
The women still have two fourth-round matches to be completed: two-time major champion Mary Pierce vs. No. 7 Anastasia Myskina, and No. 15 Ai Sugiyama vs. No. 29 Francesca Schiavone. Those matches began Monday night, continued Tuesday night, were scheduled to resume Wednesday, but at 6:30 p.m., 

Schiavone 7-6 (5), 5-4, and Myskina was ahead of Pierce 7-6 (2), 2-0 when they were sent home Tuesday. 
"If the score is 2-all, or at the beginning of the match. it shouldn't be that frustrating. But it's at the end of the set, so it's hard to keep your concen­tration," Sugiyama said Wednesday. 
"We have no voice, of course 
Pierce was among the play­ers who took advantage of the three indoor practice courts that the U.S. Tennis Association made available Wednesday morning. 
Until then, those courts were being used for SmashZone, where fans can measure how fast they serve or play the role of sports broadcaster by calling action from a match on tape.

NBA 
Arrest vvarrant charged Bryant vvith false iinprisoninent 
Associated Press 
DENVIm -Authorities look­ing to arrest NHA star Kobe Bryant on a sexual assault charge also wanted to charge him with false imprisonment. aecording to a copy of the arrest warrant uns1~aled Wednesday. 
Thn handful of documents rellmsed by a judge eontain few details but provide a glimpse into how authorities put togeth­er th1dr case. 
Separately, a state judge rnjeewd a newspaper's request to release recordings of 911 calls made from the home of Bryant's accuser. saying they are "intensely personal" and could subject the woman to ''harassment and abuse." 
Bryant was charged with a single count of felony sexual assault alleging he raped an 1~rnployne at a Colorado resort where he was a guest June 30. 
Th1~ Los Angelos Lakers' guard has said the two had con­smlsual sex. An Oct. 9 prelimi­nary hearing will determine whether the case will go to trial. 
Whiln Bryant was only charged with sexual assault, the .July 3 arrest warrant said there was "probabl11 cause" Bryant was also guilty or false impris­onment. a misdemeanor pun­ishable by up to a year in jail. 
The· decision to charge Bryant with only the sexual assault count was made by Eagle County District Attorney Mark llurlberL He has not explained why he pressed only one charge. 
The prosecutor probably chose to drop that charge to avoid the risk of a conviction on false imprisonment rather than the more serious assault charge, Denver criminal defense attorney Dan Recht said. 
"The jury won't know it's a class 2 misdemeanor and won't even know it's a misdemeanor. False imprisonment has a seri­ous ring to it," Hecht said. 
Conviction on the sexual assault charge could bring a sentence of four years to life in prison or 20 years to life on pro­bation. 
There was no immediate response Wednesday to calls seeking comment from Bryant's attorneys, the district attorney and the Eagle County sheriff's ol'lice. 
Authorities have not said what allegedly happened in Bryant's. hotel suite. 
Meanwhile, the Vail Daily had asked local police for records about emergency responses to the woman's home for 12 months starting last July. The records include unspecified requests for medical help and a report of the alleged sexual assault. 
In denying the newspaper's request. District Judge Hichard llart said he agreed with police and a psychologist who filed an aflidavit at the woman's request that releasing the records would harm her and jeopardize her and her family's safety. 
The woman "has already experienced harassment, threats and abuse." Hart wrote. "The subject matter of the records is intensely personal and disclosure would likely present an unfair perception of the alleged victim, subjecting her to further harassment and abuse." 
Also unsealed Wednesday was Judge Russell G;anger's order allowing Bryant to leave Colorado on July 4 about a half­hour after he surrendered to authorities. 
Earlier this week. media organizations filed notice that they will appeal Judge Frederick Gannett's order to withhold from the public most of the detailed court records in the case. Prosecutors have said they will not appeal the order. Bryant's attorneys have not indicated their plans. 


Kobe Bryant and attorney Pamela Mackay attend an arraign­ment hearing at the Eagle County Justice Center.

AMERICAN LEAGUE 
Ortiz sends Boston to win with walk-off home run 
Associated Press 
CHICAGO -David Ortiz homered in back-to-hack at­bats Wednesday night, includ­ing a solo shot in the lOth inning to give rhe Boston Red Sox a 5-4 victory over the Chicago White Sox. 
Ortiz finished with four RB!s, matching his career and sea­son highs. Manny Ramirez went 2-for-4 with a run scored in his first game back in the lineup after being benched. 
The victory put Boston three games behind the AL East­leading Yankees, who lost to Toronto on Wednesday. The two teams have a three-game series in New York this week­end. The Red Sox also pulled even with Seattle in the wild­card race. 
Jose Valentin hit a solo homer, but it wasn't enough to keep the White Sox from drop­ping into a tie with Minnesota for the AL Central lead. Chicago has lost four of its last six. 
Ortiz hit a two-run homer off of Scott Sullivan in the eighth, giving Boston a 4-3 lead. Valentin quickly tied it again with a leadoff homer in the bottom of the eighth. 
Ortiz came up again in the 1Oth, and this time. he gave Boston the lead for good with a solo shot to left off of Tom Gordon (6-6). 
Toronto 4, New York 3 
Josh Phelps hit a two-run homer and Eric Hinske hit a go-ahead sacrifice fly in the seventh inning as the Toronto Blue Jays rallied from a three­run deficit to beat the New York Yankees. 
Phelps hit a two-run homer in the fourth off Mike Mussina in the fourth that cut New York's lead to 3-2. Phelps has homered in four of his last five games. 
Bobby Kielty hit a tying sac­rifice fly in the sixth. After Vernon Wells singled off Antonio Osuna (2-5) in the sev­enth, Myers doubled off Gabe White. Phelps was intentional­ly walked and Hinske hit his sacrifice fly. 
Jason Kershner (1-3) pitched two innings for his first major league win, and Aquilino Lopez got the last out for his eighth save in 10 chances. 
New York's AL·East lead was cut to three games over sec­ond-place Boston. 
Greg Myers went 3-for-4 for the Blue Jays, who have won the first two games of the three-game series. 
·Jason Giambi ended the longest hitless stretch of his career at 25 at-bats when he his 36th homer in the fourth off Kelvim Escobar. One uatter later, Jorge Posada hit his 27th homer for a 3-0 lead. 
Aaron Boone had doubled in the third and scored on Karim Garcia's RBI single. 
Mussina hit two batters and gave up a single that loaded the bases in the fifth, but Carlos Delgado struck out. Toronto loaded the bases again in the sixth before Kielty hit his sacrifice fly. 
Minnesota 6, Anaheim 5 
The throw was there. All Bengie Molina had to do was tag Dustan Mohr. 
But with a shove of his shoulder, Mohr broke two bones above Molina's left wrist and sent the ball rolling away as two runs scored. The Minnesota Twins escaped Wednesday with a critical win over the Anaheim Angels. 
Talk about bang-bang plays. And Molina was charged with one tough error. 
"We've seen how Bengie stays in there tough on those plays," said closer Troy Percival, who allowed Stewart's hit. "It just didn't work out this time. He had the ball, and I think (Mohr) just got him at a really bad angle." 
Molina, who didn't speak to reporters, needed help getting dressed in the clubhouse after the game. 
Mohr said Molina had the plate covered. 
"He's a pretty big guy. I was trying to hit him hard enough for the ball to come out," Mohr said. "It's unfortunate that he was injured." 
Minnesota, the defending AL Central champion, moved into a tie with Chicago for the divi­sion lead, one game ahead of Kansas City. It's the first time the Twins have held a share of

the lead since after games of June 30, when they led by a half-game. 
Percival (0-5), who hadn't given up an earned run in his previous 37 innings against the Twins, walked Justin Morneau with two outs and Mohr pinch ran. 
Stewart followed with a hard shot down the left-field line, his third hit of the game. Garrett Anderson's throw home beat Mohr, but the colli­sion knocked the ball loose. Stewart, who never stopped running, came around as the ball rolled down the first-base line. 
Baltimore 9, Oakland 0 
On a night in which several streaks ended, almost nothing went right for the Oakland Athletics. 
Rodrigo Lopez pitched a seven-hitter, and the Baltimore Orioles battered Tim Hudson on Wednesday in a victory that snapped the Athletics' tO­game winning streak. 
"I hope we got it all out of our system," A's manager Ken Macha said. "We've been play­ing great ball, and we played a poor game tonight." 
Oakland committed a sea­son-high five errors, and Hudson (14-5) was pulled after allowing five runs and eight hits in three innings -his shortest stint of the year. 
"It was just one of those nights, man: Bad," Hudson said. 
The right-hander had won seven straight decisions and five starts in a row. It was the first time in 18 starts that he failed to pitch at least six innings. 
"You don't see Tim Hudson on the mound without his good stuff very often, and tonight was one of those nights," Baltimore manager Mike Hargrove said. "When he did throw a good pitch, we hit it." 
Detroit 6, Cleveland 5 (11 
Innings) 
Shane Halter and Carlos Pena both thought they were going to end up as the goats of yet another loss for the Detroit Tigers. · 
Instead, they were the stars. 
Pena struck out in his first three at-bats before hitting a go-ahead homer in the eighth inning, while Halter made a defensive mistake to let the Cleveland Indians tie the game, then hit a game-winning home run in the 11th. 
"We were both having rough nights, but we were able to make big plays," Pena said. "I don't care what our record might be -we're going to enjoy nights like tonight." 
Halter homered off Jose Santiago (1-2) on the second pitch of the inning, making a winner of Jamie Walker (4-3), who got the final two outs in the top of the inning. Detroit improved to 2-11 in extra innings. 
"I was at the plate thinking that, if we lost, it was going to be my fault," Halter said. "Instead. I hit a walk-off homer, which is something you dream about. I don't think I've ever hit one before, not at any level." 

Tampa Bay 7, Seattle 0 
Doug Waecnter celebrated his mother's birthday in grand fashion. 
Waechter became the first Tampa Bay pitcher to throw a shutout in his first major league start, leading the Devil Rays over the Seattle Mariners Wednesday night with a two­hitter. 
The 22-year old right-hander allowed singles to Hey Sanchez in the third inning and Dan Wilson in the sixth. He struck out seven and walked two, stopping Seattle's four-game winning streak. 
Kansas City 3, Texas 1 
Rookie Jimmy Gobbie pitched seven solid innings as the Kansas City Royals snapped a four-game losing streak with a victory over the Texas Rangers on Wednesday night. 
Mike Sweeney, Joe Randa and Carlos Beltran each had RBis in a three-run fourth to help the Royals move within one game of both Chicago and Minnesota for the AL Central lead. 
Gobble (3-3) allowed one run and four hits, struck out six and walked two after being called up from Triple-A Omaha on Tuesday to join the expand­ed roster. He had five starts for the Royals in August, winning his first two before struggling. 
Curtis Leskanic gave up one hit in a scoreless eighth, and Mike MacDougal got the final three outs for his 27th save in 35 chances as Kansas City sal­vaged the finale of the three­game series. The Royals had won the first six games against the Rangers before this series. 
Rangers starter John Thomson (12-12), seeking his sixth victory in seven deci­sions, gave up three runs and four hits in seven innings. He struck out eight and walked one.

NBA 

Rick Carlisle signs four-year deal with Pacers 
Associated Press 

INDIANAPOLIS -A week ago, Rick Carlisle was content to spend the upcoming NBA season in a television studio. 
On Wednesday, he jumped back into coaching. 
Carlisle ended a week of specu­lation by signing a four-year con­tract with the Indiana Pacers, the same team that bypassed him in favor of Isiah Thomas three years ago. 
Carlisle was the only person new Pacers president Larry Bird considered for the job. 
"I was probably two or three days from taking ESPN's offer before Larry called me with this opportunity," he said. 
Carlisle didn't hesitate to give Bird an answer. The only snag was contract negotiations. 
Bird, Carlisle and Pacers CEO Donnie Walsh all declined com­ment on how much the deal was worth. 
But Bird indicated Carlisle agreed to a contract worth less than the going rate for an experi­enced NBA coach, at least initial­ly, because the Pacers still owe Thomas $5 million for this sea­son. Thomas was fired Aug. 27. 
The Detroit Pistons owe Carlisle $2 million after firing him in June. 
"It would never have happened if he didn't help us out in a big way," Bird said. 
Carlisle replaces Thomas, who was 131-115 in three seasons. The Pacers reached the playoffs all three years under Thomas, a Hall of Farner who spent his entire 13-year playing career with the Pistons, but also had three straight first-round playoff exits. 
Wednesday's news conference announcing the hiring of Bird's longtime friend, former team­mate in Boston and former assis­tant with the Pacers was in stark contrast to the one in July when Bird was introduced as team president and he and Thomas walked off the stage glaring at each other. 
Instead, Carlisle and Bird joked, shook hands and seemed to enjoy sharing the spotlight. 
"Donnie wanted me to go to charm school and Larry wanted me to go to a Dale Carnegie course," Carlisle joked. "I told him I'd gone to a Dale Carnegie course in lOth grade. He didn't believe me." 
Carlisle turned the 45-minute session into his version of the Oscars, thanking everyone from his former players in Detroit to the Pistons front office to ESPN executives to the ·Pacers owners and front office. 
He spent two seasons in 
Detroit, winning the NBA's 2001­02 coach of the year award, and leading the Pistons last season to their first Eastern Conference finals since 1991. 
While his 100-64 record and postseason success weren't enough to keep him employed in Detroit, Carlisle's track record and relationship with Bird were enough to win him the Pacers job. 
"I like this roster very much," Carlisle said. "I had opportunities to get involved again, but I declined. This was a job, that when it came up, you had to take it." 
"He's very serious about his work, and I think he'll do a fine job," Bird said of Carlisle. "I expect no problems at all." 
Carlisle's first task with the Pacers will be patching up a rela­tionship with All-Star forward Jermaine O'Neal, the team's leading scorer and rebounder who in July signed a seven-year contract to stay in Indiana. 
Last week, O'Neal said he would not have resigned if he knew Thomas would not return. 
"I had a very nice conversation with Jermaine Saturday,". Carlisle said. "I told Jermaine, I understood what Isiah Thomas meant to him as a coach, mentor and friend and I told him in no way would I try to replace that." 


New Pacers head coach Rick Carlisle and team president Larry Bird answer questions at a press conference Wednesday.

Associated Press 
ORCHARD PARK, N.Y.­Lawyer Milloy agreed to sign with the Buffalo Bills on Wednesday, a day after being cut by the New England Patriots. 
The move adds more drama to an already ­intriguing season-opener the Bills host the Patriots on Sunday. Besides Milloy, Buffalo quarterback Drew Bledsoe was a star in New England. 
Milloy significantly upgrades a young Buffalo defensive backfield and could provide insight into the Patriots' plans as the Bills prepare for New 
Milloy was expected to join the team for his first practice on Thursday. 
Coach Gregg Williams said he would have to first speak with Milloy before determining whether he would be ready to play Sunday. 
Milloy was released by the Patriots for salary-cap reasons on Tuesday. The move created a stir, in part because Milloy was a team leader and had started 106 consecutive games in his seven NFL seasons. 
Adding the bonus to his $4.4 million salary for this season, Milloy was to count $5.25 million against New 

The Bills, projected to have $4 million of room under the cap, were one of a handful of team that had made offers to sign the player. 
Terms of Milloy's new deal were not immediately available. 
Milloy led the Patriots in tackles in 2001, when New England won the Super Bowl, and recorded 100 or more tackles five times. Last year he had no sacks. no forced fumbles and no interceptions. His 91 tack­les were the fewest he'd tallied since becoming a full-time starter. 
He's the latest addition to that was bolstered last spring by the additions of linebackers Takeo Spikes and Jeff Posey and tackle Sam Adams. Together, they improve a unit that gave up 25 points a game, and managed a league-low 19 turnovers and 31 sacks. 
Buffalo's current starters at safety are Coy Wire, who's coming off an encouraging rookie season, and Pierson Prioleau, a four-year veteran who was a first-time starter last season. Neither recorded an interception last year. 
Bills president Tom Donahoe denied specula­tion that Milloy might have 

IN BRIEF 
Holmes si~ns extension with Chiefs 
KANSAS CITY, Mo. -Running back Priest Holmes, who has led the NFL in yards from scrimmage the 
past two seasons, agreed to a four­year contract extension with the Kansas City Chiefs on Wednesday. 
Holmes had indicated he might not play in the season opener on Sunday if a new deal was not worked out. 
When asked if he would now be paid as the best running back in foot­ball, Holmes smiled and said, "Let's just say that I am a happy man." 
He had been scheduled to make a base salary of about $2.5 million in each of the three years remaining on his contract -unquestionably below market value for a player who had 4,440 yards from scrimmage the past two seasons and was selected the NFL's most valuable offensive player for 2002. 
He missed the last two games of last season with a hip injury that required surgery in February. But general manager Carl Peterson said Wednesday he was satisfied the hip had fully healed. 
Molina to mess the rest of the seaon MINNEAPOLIS -Anaheim catcher Bengie Molina broke two bones above his left wrist in the game-end­ing play of Wednesday's 5-4 loss to Minnesota and will miss the rest of the season. With Anaheim leading 5-4, Shannon Stewart hit a hard shot down the left-field line. Garrett Anderson's throw home beat pinch­runner Dustan Mohr, but Mohr low­ered his shoulder and collided with Molina's glove, knocking the ball loose. Molina, whose wrist snapped back on the play, was on the ground for several moments before teammates helped him to his feet. X-rays revealed the a broken radius and 

ulna above his left wrist. 
Ramirez returns to lineup for Red Sox CHICAGO -Manny Hamirez is back where he's supposed to be, bat­ting cleanup for the Boston Hed Sox. A day after manager Grady Little benched his slugger in a thinly veiled punishment for his recent antics. Ramirez was back in Boston's lineup Wednesday night. "I just want to make a statement that Manny Hamirez is back in the lineup tonight in left field, and he's back out there because we feel like that's the best chance we've got to win tonight," Little said before Boston's game against the Chicago White Sox. "That's the way we're going to approach every single game the rest of the way." Little claimed he wasn't punishing his slugger by benching him Tuesday. but the message was clear.

seemed natural for her to play for the Irish. 
"Notre Dame is a legacy in my family," said Carpenter, who had two cousins, an uncle, and a brother that graduated from Notre Dame. "I basically was one of those kids who grew up with ND, and I've wanted to go here ever since I could walk and talk." 
She played sparingly early in her Notre Dame career, seeing action in 10 games as a fresh­man before playing in two-thirds of the team's games as a sopho­more. She recorded one goal each year while playing primari­ly as a midfielder. 
"We found out about Kim through one of our summer camps," said Waldrum. "We really liked her after getting to know her that week. We thought it would take some time for her to develop, but she's been a con­stant for the team even when she didn't play a lot of minutes." 
Carpenter saw her role increase dramatically as a junior as she played in all 21 games, including 20 starts at a multitude of different positions in the defense and midfield. This was due partly to her versatility and to the rash of injuries sustained by other members of the squad. From that point, she became a very consistent contributor for the Irish. 
That developmental period has helped Carpenter become a team leader as a senior. Even as many of the injured players have returned, she has remained a fixture in the starting lineup through the first two games of the season. She also scored her first goal of the season in the season opening 9-1 win over Hartford. 
"I know I'm not the most tal­ented kid on the team and I know I never will be, but every day I step on the field ready to give 110 percent. I try to set a good example for our young kids by showing them that talent will only get them so far," said Carpenter. "It's heart and guts that will pull them all the way through, and eventually allow them to win championships." 
"She's always positive," said Waldrum, "and has really evolved into a leader. She's like a third captain for us. She can reach young players because she had to be patient and put her time in. She's become a phenom­enal asset, someone that we really could not do without." 
"Notre Dame soccer for me has been a dream come true," said Carpenter. "I always grew up saying to myself, 'I'm going to play soccer for the Irish,' but I never actually thought it would or could come true. I just reached out for my dream with all the passion and heart that I have. and somehow I got it. I consider myself blessed to be where I am, and for that reason, I will never take for granted the time that I spend in the Irish jer­sey."

Belles drop close match to Albion 
By JUSTIN SCHUVER 
Spores Writer 
The Belles put themselves in a position to win, but just didn't have enough to get it done this time. 
Saint Mary's narrowly lost on the road to conference rival Albion in a five-game match Wednesday, 30-22, 25-30, 30­17, 22-30. 5-15. 
The Belles (0-2. 0-1 MIAA) came into the match with two players unable to play ­Michelle Turley was out with a foot injury and Anne Cusack had strep throat. 
A third player, Alison Shevik, played only the back row as she tried to overcome a minor ankle injury. 

Coach Julie Schroeder-Biek was impressed with her team's poise and determination to work through the adversity. 
"We had a lot of obstacles. to overcome that night," she said. "You name it -injuries, trans­portation problems ... but I was very happy with how the girls played as a team." 
Freshman outside hitter Kristen Playko had a phenome­nal individual performance, col­lecting 25 kills, the most on either team. She led the Belles' leader in digs with 17 and con­tributed three service aces. 
Middle hitter Elise Rupright led the team in blocks (four), and also added eight kills, three service aces and 14 digs. Libera Michelle Gary was second on the team with 15 digs, followed

Schroeder-Biek was pleased by what has been a theme so far for this year's Belles ­sharing the digs as a team ­and was equally pleased with how the team achieved several goals for the game. 
"One of our goals against Albion was to raise our attack percentage," she said. The Belles had an attack percentage of .128. "I can definitely tell looking at the numbers that we really improved in that depart­ment. It was a big improve­ment."

Starting rotation 
Four tight ends could play Saturday 
By JOE HETTLER Sports Editor 
Gary Godsey likely won't play Saturday against Washington State because of a knee injury, but the Irish have plenty of players ready to step in his place at the tight end position. 
Jared Clark and Billy Palmer will start against the Cougars, while Anthony Fasano and Marcus Freeman are also likely to see playing time. 
"You'll probably see a rotation of all four of those guys," Irish offensive coordinator Bill Diedrick said. "We're going to try and keep those guys fresh and rotate them in." 
Godsey, who had 16 receptions last season, has seen limited practice since injuring his knee. Godsey's possible absence allows other tight ends a chance to play. 
"You're always concerned when you have an injury to a returning starter," Diedrick said. "But that also gives the next guy a great opportunity to step up and make some plays." 
Clark caught seven passes last season for 104 yards and played exceptionally well in the spring game, grabbing 2 passes for 47 yards and a two-point conversion. 
Diedrick said Clark has shown steady improvement since the spring practices. 
"His progress has been very satisfactory," Diedrick said. "He's improved a great deal with his blocking skills and he's been catch­ing the ball very consistently. " 
Clark. who converted from quarterback during the 2002 spring practices, has worked hard to become a solid tight end for Notre Dame. 

pretty incredible," Clark said. "You look at the young guys and remember how hard it was for you when you were young. I haven't made it yet. I'm still a long ways a way. but I think I'm getting there." 
Palmer should be opposite Clark and played in just over 81 minutes of football as well as making 97 special team appearances last season. He also caught one pass for four yards. This season, Palmer will step into a bigger role within the offense. 
''I'm just trying to go out there and get bet­ter every day in all aspects." Palmer said. ''I'm looking forward to Saturday and just getting on the field." 
The other two tight ends in the rotation will be guys that have yet to step on the field for a single college down. 
Fasano was a first team all-state New Jersey selection as a senior, grabbing 78 passes for 1,460 yards and 23 touchdowns as a senior. He has improved his route running and blocking abilities throughout spring and fall practice. 
Freeman was a two-time all state selection from Minnesota and had 16 catches for 400 yards as a senior. At 6-foot-4, 242 pounds, Freeman gives the Irish another big body at the position. 
Diedrick is somewhat concerned with the inexperience of Fasano and Freeman but said that will all change after the first few plays Saturday. 
"There is a concern [about their lack of experience]. but that won't last very long because after that first step they become vet­erans," Diedrick said. 
The Irish lost their top tight end recruit when freshman Greg Olsen trasnferred from the team last week.

Belles set school record with win 
By ERIK POWERS Sports Writer 
Saint Mary's extended its season-opening winning streak with a 2-1 victory over Taylor University. The Belles became the frrst team in school history to open a season with three consecutive wins. 
Saint Mary's scored both of their goals in the first half. Junior Jen Concannon scored her fourth goal of the season to open the game's scoring. Sophomore defender Shannon Culbertson and senior forward Wendy Irvin both were credited with assists. Concannon added her fifth goal of the season later in the half off of an assist by junior midfielder Katie Noble. 
Taylor's only goal came early in the second half on a 32 yard free kick from straight away. Coach Peter Haring was pleased with his team's effort. 
"We're 3-0 right now," Haring said. "It's a great start. We're playing really well with our new concepts." 
Freshman Laura Heline con­tinued her strong play in goal. Heline had 14 saves behind a stellar defense. 
The Belles accomplished their goal of cutting down the number of opponents' corner kicks. Saint Mary's allowed 14 corner kicks in its first game versus the State University of New York Rockport over the

Her heart beats for the sport 
By ANDY TROEGER Sports Writer 
With all of the negative press surrounding scandals and other problems in college ath­letics, it is comforting to find examples of athletes that play sports for all of the right rea­sons. Notre Dame's women's soccer team has a model of that kind of athlete, namely sen­ior midfielder and defender Kim Carpenter.
