WASHINGTON President Reagan, saying he was "a bit wiser" after two failed attempts to put a hardline conservative on the Su­preme Court, picked federal appeals judge Anthony Ken­nedy for the bench Wednes­day and dropped his par­tisan attacks against the Democratic-run Senate. 
Reagan said Kennedy, 51, has earned a reputation as "a courageous, tough but fair jurist" in his 12 years on the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco. 
"He's popular with col­leagues of all political per­suasions," Reagan said. "And I know that he seems to be popular with many senators of varying political persuasions as well."

Mindful of the problems he's had for more than four months in trying to fill the court opening, Reagan said he would not actually submit Kennedy's nomination until completion of a full-field FBI background check, which could take weeks.

In Brief 
SylvesterStallone,filming''Ramboiii''intheisraeli resort town of Elat, reportedly fled his hotel room Sunday night when security guards told him machine-gun fire had broken out nearby and he was in danger. But police and army spokesmen said there was no gunbattle in the area. Stallone's head security officer, Tony Maffatone, disputed the Israeli statements, saying he witnessed a four-minute battle in which hundreds of rounds of machine-gun fire were exchanged. "There is no question about it. This was a real battle with heavy machine-gun fire," Maffatone said. "The Israeli story is completely implausible." ­

No humming allowed at NO football games 
With the advent of the last home football game of the season this Friday, I think that we shoul~ get athfe~ thinhgs cleared upf.tShe~iors11wm 
experience e1r 1ast ome game o e1r co ege careers. 
As usual, emotion and nostalgia will run ram­pant at the tailgaters and in the senior section. And wherever there is emotion and nostalgia at Notre Dame, there is the urge to sing our inspiring school songs. This, however, presents a problem. 
After almost four years, I now realize that I am one of the only fools who actually knows all of the words to the three main school songs. As an incoming freshman, I thought knowing the Victory March, Notre Dame Our Mother and the Hike Song were prerequisites for admission to the football games. 
To the contrary, opening one's ears at the football game will prove that most people begin to sing the chorus of the fight song well before it's time to break in with the familiar words. And if I did not know any better, I would think that the alma mater consisted of a bunch of melodic mumbles followed by an overwhelming "Looove thee Noootre Dame! ! " 
In the interest of all those who would like to get the words of these songs right once in their careers, I will give up the rest of my column to words of Notre Dame's school songs. Good luck, good times and good singing. 
Notre Dame VIctory March 
Rally sons of Notre Dame; Sing her glory and sound her fame, Raise her Gold and Blue And cheer with voices true; Rah, rah for Notre Dame 
(This is the part people miss-KB) We will fight in ev-ry game, Strong of hear and true to her name We will ne'er forget her And will cheer her ever Loyal to Notre Dame. 
Chorus 
Cheer, cheer for old Notre Dame, Wake up the echoes cheering her name, Send a volley cheer on high, Shake down the thunder from the sky. What though the odds be great or small. Old Notre Dame will win over all, While her loyal sons are marching Onward to victory.

Network fasts for divestment 
By ERIC M. BERGAMO Senior Staff Reporter 
Members of the Notre Dame Anti-Apartheid Network are "making some kind of sacrifice" by fasting this week before the meeting of the Board of Trustees, said Greg Magetti, head of the Anti-Apartheid Net­work. 
Fity-five people have signed up to fast for some period or miss a meal, Magetti noted. Those who have signed up in­clude undergraduates, graduate students and faculty. 
Three graduate students are abstaining completely from food during the week, he said. 
Curtis Brock has been on a diet of juices since Monday, while Carol Stewart and Cris Toffolo have only had water, Magetti said. Brock had to eat some rice on Tuesday because he was becoming ill from the fast. 
The fasters are staying in the LaFortune lobby during the day, he said. 
The fast will end at 12: 15 p.m. Friday during a vigil outside the Center for Continuing Edu­cation. 
The Board will decide on divesting from corporations doing business in South Africa this Friday at the CCE. 
Magetti said he doesn't feel the fast will influence the deci­sion of the Board of Trustees. 
"We're trying not to think of it in those terms because that's not why you should fast," he 
said.  "You shouldn't fast  to  
force  someone  to do someth­ 
ing."  There are a number of  

reasons for the fast, Magetti said. 
"First of all it is to share in a little way in the suffering," he said. "Secondly --and this is one reason why it's good to have other people join into the fast--it is to get as many people as possible to really think and to look deeper at what is going on in South Africa. 
"One thing we would like (the Trustees) to know," he added, "is that it affects us how they decide on this, that we take it seriously." 
Magetti noted that he came to Notre Dame because of the reputation for peace and jus­tice. 
"We (the Network) feel kind of a responsibility to make our University the best that it can be," Magetti said. 
Magetti originally felt the Board might divest because "they were waiting specifically to hear what (Rev. Leon) Sul­livan was going to say," but now feels the Board won't take action. 
Sullivan is the author of the Sullivan Principles, the guidelines regarding invest­ment in South Africa followed by many U.S. businesses and institutions, including Notre Dame. In May, Sullivan called for complete divestment from South African businesses because apartheid had not diminished. Magetti said he has heard comments from several people, including a Bel­gian journalist who inter­viewed Father Oliver Wil­liams, a member of the Board's investment committee, that it seemed the University would continue to invest. 
People who have written to University President Father Edward Malloy, Magetti noted, have received answers that "people of goodwill can dis­agree on the best means to end apartheid."

Junior Bob Challenger said the task force is collecting views and opinions on coeduca­tional housing from faculty, alumni and students. 
Firth said each member of 

the task force is involved in col­
lecting information from a va­
riety of groups with input on 
the issues of residentiality. 
The 15-member task force 

was appointed last spring by 
Father David Tyson, vice pres­
ident for student affairs, to 
study six areas of residen­
tiality, a press release stated. 
The issues to be examined in­
clude: 
--the quality, sufficiency and variety of living facilities for undergraduate and graduate students; 
--the criteria for selection 

and evaluation of residence 
hall staffs; 
the structural and 

programmatic support avail­
able to hall staffs; 
-the standard of conduct for 

student residents; 
--the provision of services to meet the social, religious, cul­tural, volunteer and personal needs of resident students; 
--the relationship between residential life and the aca­demic mission of the Univer­sity. 
A survey on residentiality is­sues will be distributed to a sample of the student body next week to gauge student reac­tion, Challenger said. 
"Students will be able to voice their oplDlons on coeducational housing," be said. "The survey is important. It will be a very valuable tool to our report." 
Challenger said the task force is providing Father Mal­loy with information in order to identify key residentiality is­sues. 
"The purpose of the survey is not so much to suggest changes as to look closer at cer­tain issues,'' Challenger said. "Based on our report, (Malloy) will decide on what to investi­gate. Our report may have a direct bearing on his decision.''

During a 35-minute meeting phy at the University of Kansas, spoke at the second session, "The Ethical Issues." 
DeGeorge said that the ethi­cal climate of the firms on Wall Street is the ethical responsi­bility of top management. "If that climate has deteriorated it is their responsibility to come up with a solution, not the busi­ness schools or the govern­ment," he said. In the absence of such internal self-policing, he said, it is the right of the public to look elsewhere for remedies for what it perceives as harm to society. 
DeGeorge suggested a restructuring of the investment system. "If the roots of the abuses are personal greed, the system would be better off if arbitrageurs were well-paid for their work by their firms, but precluded from trading for themselves as one of the condi­tions of their employment," he said. 
Some radical suggestions to 
the ethical problems facing the 
market were posed by Father 
Drew Christiansen, professor 
of Christian ethics at Notre 
Dame. Christiansen said that 
we must find a strategy to 
make unproductive greed un­
profitable. Business success 
must be tied to providing a ser­
vice to the public, he said. 
Christiansen said that we 
also need to recruit older, more 
experienced people to the mar­
ket to serve more creatively in 
that area rather than to worry 
primarily about returns on in­
vestments, as many new, 
freshly educated graduates do. 
"Pat Cooke wanted us to bring specific recommendations to the senate at the next meeting." 
Woody said SUB would bring before the senate their inter­pretations of the constitution. He said they will also present their views on the violations of the constitution. 
SUB is upset with Jaeger's presentation of the violations at the senate meeting, according to Woody. He said, "Jaeger had never come to anyone on the board (SUB) and presented the violations he saw" before the meeting.

Associated Press 
WASHINGTON Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega declared Wednesday his gov­ernment is fully committed to complying with the Central America peace agreement and he renewed his offer to hold peace talks with the United States. 
"Nicaragua is ready to com­ply 100 percent with the agree­ment," Ortega declared in a dramatic hour-long appearance before the General Assembly of the Organization of American States during his first visit to Washington in eight years. Ortega wore a con­servative gray suit instead of his usual outfit for public ap­pearances --combat fatigues. 
He thus disputed President Reagan's charge before the same audience on Monday that Nicaragua is "nowhere near" meeting its obligations. 
An overflow crowd filled the 
main meeting room at OAS 
headquarters. 
In the standing-room-only crowd were all six members of the Contra leadership; they lis­tened intently as Ortega spoke. Mterward, one of the most vet­eran Contra leaders, Adolfo Calero, called Ortega's speech "lengthy, boring and without real substance." 
Ortega's call for a direct dialogue with the United States was rejected immediately by the U.S. ambassador to the OAS, Richard McCormack, who said that Reagan had laid out strict conditions for re­opening diplomatic contacts with Sandinista officials. 
Ortega said that although Nicaragua has taken a number of steps to meet its commit­ments under the regional peace agreement he signed last Au­gust, the United States has un­dercut the accord by sending weapons and other equipment on 140 resupply flights to the country's Contra rebels since then. 
He said the weapons include ground-to-air missiles which are threatening domestic and international air traffic in Nicaragua. U.S. spy flights also have continued, he said. 
The peace agreement was signed by Nicaragua and four Central American neighbors -­Guatemala, El Salvador, Hon­duras and Costa Rica.

said. 
HPC members said Goldrick told them that the University usually does cover minor damage charges, but because this was such a large amount, the University didn't want to set a precedent by paying the bill. 
HPC members said Goldrick told them that students definitely would have to pay the damages, so the administra­tion wanted to have the stu­dents involved in the decision about how the damages would be assessed. 
Some HPC members ex­pressed concern that a prece­dent might be set in which the student body as a whole could be assessed damages for the actions of only some students. 
The HPC said University of­ficials collected ID cards from 16 or 17 students during the food fight. Each has already paid a fine to the University, Coene said. But these are disciplinary fines, and this money will not be applied to the $1,400 of da­mages, she said.

Society suffers from a love of words 
While filling out applications for graduate schools, I ran across someth­ing interesting in the directions for completing the application. In the sec­tion for writing a personal statement the admissions board of this particular university advises the applicant that "brevity is the soul of wit." 
Brian Broderick 
sincerely yours 
My first reaction was one of disdain. Here I am filling out a tedious, time­consuming application for graduate school and I learn that "brevity is the soul of wit?" These people have just asked me for everything but my shoe size and now I am asked to be brief in my personal statement. Okay, so hypocrisy extends beyond the world of 
Drunk driving hurts everyone 

Dear Editor: 
Picture your best friend. Remember all the things you've done together and all the great times you've had. Remem­ber the parties, the football games, days playing basketball and nights at the bars. Remember the long talks; the things you told him that you couldn't tell anyone else. Remember the times when you were depressed, angry or sad and he was there for you. Remember all the times you were just glad he was around. 
Now imagine walking home from one of those great times and watching as your best friend is killed by a swerving car. Imagine your devastation when you realize that your best friend has been taken from you by the senseless actions of a drunk driver. Imagine your best friend gone forever. No more great times, no more long talks, no more times together. Only memories and a lot of "what-ifs." Now picture the other side. Imagine being at a party or the bars and it's time to go home. Im­agine that you've had a couple of beers but think you're o.k. to drive. Maybe the rest of the carload has been drink­ing too and you're their only way home. 
Doonesbury 
Notre Dame. This comes as no surprise to most of us. 
Then I looked at the quote more closely and realized that nothing in our world is very brief and that wit is sorely lacking in any type of communication. Evidence for this observation is appar­ent by simply examining our very own campus publications. 
Take for example the self-indulgent, moralistic drivel put out by the pseudo­intellectuals on this campus known as "Common Sense." Not only does this publication give new meanings to the word tedious, but its lack of wit is only compensated by its ability to induce narcosis. (I am sure Ann Pettifer will admire my choice of vocabulary in describing her tiresome rag, my only regret is not commenting on the female genitalia aspects of Vatican II. I know that would really peak her interests). Mercifully this publication is thrust upon us only once a month. 
Scholastic's attempts at wit have been few and far between. Not only are they long and witless, but the magazine itself lacks any soul. When a maga­zine's sole attempt at humor consists of a comic strip from the juvenile Matt Groenig, then we have a definite prob­lem in defining the terms. 
What is really disappointing about Scholastic is that it takes itself and its "investigative journalism" so serious­ly. Do these people really think they are proving anything? Obviously the people behind the current "Student Sur­vey" are responsible for the path taken by Scholastic. 
I would be remiss to exclude our own precious Observer which brings to us weekly a mindspill from a certain cleric who takes tedious and long writing one step too far into the realm of the absurd. And, of course, we are 
Imagine driving along, talking about the great time you've just had, and seeing the person in the road too late. Try to imagine the utter horror you would feel knowing that you have just hit and killed someone, someone's best friend. 
For the ten of us, the scene we describe requires no imagination. It happened. On December 6, 1986, last year, our best friend Mike Cogswell was killed when someone, who on that particular night had too much to drink, got behind the wheel and didn't see Mike in time. In an instant our best friend was gone. 
It's hard to express in words the feelings of shock, devastation and grief that accompanied the first few hours after the accident. In the days that fol­lowed we tried to deal with our sense of loss as we consoled each other, our friends and Mike's family. Traveling to his home at Syracuse, participating in the funeral and burying Mike will al­ways live with us as the most difficult thing we've ever done. The week was a nightmare. 
Returning home to ND we all began to think about the accident. We heard good things about the driver, what a nice guy he was. We realized that it could have been any of us driving that car. That all of us have at one time or another, driven having had a few

Nothing is really brief anymore. Anywhere from philosophy class to Presidential elections, we are stuck in a malaise of long-winded, unamusing events in our daily lives. If brevity is really the soul of wit, then our country is suffering through a very somber era. Can anything be done or said in a clever, succinct fashion? My experi­ences here on this campus and obser­vations of the outside world have shown to me a general lack of wit or clarity in today's society. The Bard must be turning in his grave.

series of hallways Into the theater. Anthony then directed his guests to take four empty seats in the eighth row. 
On stage a plump woman in a black sequined dress was singing a piece written by lr· ving Berlin. The younger mem­bers of Murphy's group soon recognized her as Rosemary Clooney, the lady in the paper towel commercials. ("Extra value is what you get. when you buy Coronet.") Older audi­ence members remembered her as Bing Crosby's co-star In the fllm classic "White Christmas." 
During the Intermission which followed Clooney's per­formance, a theater manager approached Murphy's group and demanded to see their tickets. Somehow she found out that the four hadn't paid the $27.50 admission charge; the woman made it clear that they'd either have to pay or leave the theater, regardless of whether Hope had invited them. 
But Mark Anthony had other plans, he directed the group backstage. "You don't have to have a ticket." Anthony an­nounced as he set up four chairs In the stage wings, "You can stay right here." 
"Backstage we can have whoever the hell we want." he continued, apparently undis­turbed by the white collars and black suits worn by two 0f his guests. 
"Really?" Father Murphy asked, unfazed. "God damn right," Anthony returned, looking rather proud of him­self. 
"Two minutes, gentleman," called out the stage manager, as he paced backstage. Murphy's group listened to the orchestra tune up. They were so close to the musicians that they could read the notes on the sheet music. Someone brought them Dixie cups fllled with water. 
And then they met him. The show business legend came backstage and looked rather quizzically at the pair of priests and two students sitting in the wings. 
Murphy took the initiative and shook Hope's hand, reminding the comedian of their prior meetings. The other members of the group followed his lead and quickly mumbled Introductions. 
The meeting couldn't have lasted more than a few minutes before the curtain went up and Hope walked on stage. During his performance Hope danced and sang with an agility that belied his 84 years. 
And then there were the jokes. Hope hit everything from Reagan to religion to his age: 
"Are you a Jehovah's wit­ness? Hell no, I didn't even see the accident." 
"My wife's really Catholic. She thinks Oral Roberts is a den­tist." 
"When I get up In the mor­ning, I don't feel my age. In fact. I don't feel anything until noon and then I take a nap." 
After the performance, Murphy and his companions met with Hope again and took some pictures. A stage hand told the comedian that Sammy Davis, Jr. had called the theater just a few minutes before the show ended. Then, as Hope's four visitors were about to ask for a group photo, Rosemary Clooney glided backstage. 
Murphy and his friends watched the pair of screen legends go upstairs to Hope's dressing room. Although the four didn't get as many pic­tures as they would have liked, it was still an unforgettable evening. Exiting through the stage door, they left the theater--thanking Bob for the memories. 

'Right to Know': 
Should public officials' past activities be held against them? 
Compiled by Cara Anthony and Kathryn Ellis Photos by Zoltan Ury "Smoking marijuana wouldn't necessarily affect how one would be as a Supreme Court justice. Ginsburg lied about other things, though, like how many cases he tried for the country. It's sad for the people involved that these things are found out, but It's bet­ter In the long run for our country." 
Kate Murray Junior 



"A prospective candidate's past matters more when It reflects di­rectly back on the job he would do. In Bork's case, his past had a lot do with how we think he would function as a justice." 
Dennis Hughes 
Senior 
"If a candidate made a mistake before he was a public figure, It shouldn't be held against him, but If It happened during his career, as In the case ofGary Hart, he should have known that It would be detrimental to his career." 
Mimi Suba Freshman 



"People tend to blow small things out of proportion. Everyone can make a mistake once In a while but If they did It on a constant basis and they knew It was wrong, the mistake should be made public." 
Joe Watson Sophomore 
"You elect a candidate for who he Is today, not for who he was yes­terday. 1 think people want to know about a candidate's past so theycan criticize him and feel like good citizens." Dan Beaton · Freshman 



"I think the press Is going a little too far now. Time has a lot to do with it. If questionable behavior happened a long time ago, then 'it's not Important, but If It hap­pened recently It's worth bringing out Into the open." 
Becky Besser Sophomore 
"Well, 1 think in the case of the judges, what's at stake Is their past record as judges, not their past record as college students. Everyone has something they don't want other people to know." 
John Uhran Sophomore 



"I think the press Is carrying It too far because what the can­didate did In the past Is Irrelevant to what's going on now and In the future. The media didn't handle It well-they blew It way out of proportion." 
Stephanie Burke 
Junior

Aggressive freshman 
Sports Briefs
Andre Jones makes his mark 
By PETE SKIKO Sports Writer 
The Irish score. The crowd goes wild, but settles down during the ensuing timeout. The Notre Dame kickoff team trots onto the field, except for number seven, who prances out, waving his arms wildly, in­citing the crowd to come alive and rally behind the Irish. 
Thousands of fans thumb through their Notre Dame pro­grams. Seven? Who's number seven? 
If freshman Andre Jones has his way, future fans won't have to flip through their programs or look way down in the depth chart for his number. He's hoping that his number will be firmly implanted in their memories from his play on defense and special teams. 
Jones, Maryland's defensive player of the year last year, is both optimistic and realistic re­garding his ability to contrib­ute now and in the future. 
"We've got great linebackers this year," says Jones, an out­side linebacker by trade. "and I realize that I might not be as strong this year as the guys who have been here a while. But I'm hoping to start at out­side linebacker next year and work towards all-American as an upperclassman." Jones has been an absolute headhunter on the kickoff team this year, backing up his pre­kickoff exuberance with results -ten solo tackles and three assists, most of them rather convincing. He has been practical in going about getting playing time. 
"I don't go nuts before the kickoff to get my name known," says Jones, the 6-4, 220-pound Hyattsville, Md. na­tive. "It's just something I've always done. The crowd was really down after Boston Col­lege got off to the start they did. When it was 25-12, I didn't want our home field advantage to slip away. So when we scored, I tried to pump the crowd up a little bit. You can't believe how psyched it makes the guys on defense when they know the crowd is behind them. 
"I figure that if I can make an impression right away on special teams, I'll be able to 
Clemens wins Cy Young 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK Roger Clemens of the Boston Red Sox became the first American League pitcher in more than a decade to win two straight Cy Young awards, capturing the 1987 trophy Wednesday despite a spring training holdout and 4-6 start. Now, he says he can aim for the record books. 
"It's an individual award. It gives me something to shoot for, something that no one has done before, win a third time in a row," Clemens said at a Houston news conference. "I beat the jinx. Now, I guess I have to do it again." 
Clemens, who lives in Katy, Texas, had 256 strikeouts in 281 2-3 iimings this year. He received 21 of 28 first-place votes and 124 points in balloting by a panel of Baseball Writers Association of America mem­bers. 
Jimmy Key of Toronto, 17-8 with a league-leading earned­run average of 2.76, had four first-place votes and 64 points to finish a distant second. Dave Stewart of Oakland, at 20-13 the only other 20-game winner in the AL, was third with two first­place votes 32 points.

Members of the team seem to 
know that Jones has the poten~

bit. 
"I've had no problems with the guys on the team," says Jones. "Everybody's been great --trying to help you out when they can.

He's intense, a hitter, and really consistent. <Free safety) Brandy Wells, too. They're a couple of good guys to study."

Soccer 
There is one wOrd to describe 
the role of soccer in the MCC­
-confusing. 
Conference members 
Evansville and St. Louis are 
the two soccer powers in the 
region, but there is no guaran­
tee Notre Dame will face either 
team next season. 
Soccer officials are still 
debating what format to use in 
scheduling league competition. 
Many coaches do not want to 
tie up six of their allotted 21 
matches with league games, so 
some favor splitting the league 
into two divisions, with the 
Irish, Aces and Billikens all 
having to play each other. 
A post-season tournament is also held, but coaches such as 

Sports writers are asked to attend a meeting tonight at 7 p.m. in the Observer office to sign up for winter sports. -The Observer 
CBS Sports will hold a seminar on sports broadcasting today at 3:15p.m. at the LaFortune Little Theatre. The seminar will feature Michael Burks, the coordinating producer for college football for CBS, color commentator Pat Haden, a director, an assistant producer and a pro­duction associate. CBS holds the weekly "CBS Sports on Campus" seminars at the home sites of games the net­works televises each week. -The Observer 
Ice time sign-ups will be held today at 1 p.m. in the JACC. Teams may sign up for a maximum of one hour per week. Cost is $50 per hour. Questions should be directed to Tom Carroll at 5227. -The Observer 
The women's soccer team will have its first indoor game today at 8 p.m. Meet at the Library circle at 7:30

The men's basketball team will play an intrasquad scrimmage game Saturday at 11:30 a.m., prior to the NO­Alabama football game. -The Observer 
Keith Tower, a 6-11, 228-pound center from Coraopolis, Pa., became the second basketball player to sign a letter of intent to attend Notre Dame next fall. Elmer Bennett, a 6-1 guard from Houston, Tx., committed to the Irish early last month. -The Observer 
Irish head coach Dennis Grace do not want to play the same team more than once any season. Starting in 1989, 
however,  the  tournament  
champion  is  supposed  to  
receive  an  automatic  NCAA  

Tournament bid. So there is talk of not having any regular season league games. 
In that case there would be no guarantee that Notre Dame would face Evansville and St. Louis, and as the Irish found out this season, not having ranked teams on your schedule can hurt your tournament bid chances. 
Swimming 
Both the men's and women's swimming teams probably will join the MCC this season, but it is not definite. 
If the two teams do join this year, Notre Dame's participa­tion will mean competing in the

MCC championship swim meet. Tennis 
It remains uncertain as to whether the men's tennis team will join the MCC this spring or in the spring of 1989. Notre Dame has a schedule conflict on the date of this spring's MCC tournament. 
"When we were there two years ago, it was a Notre Dame-Evansville battle for first, and both were very close," said Tim Welsh, the coach of Notre Dame's men's and women's teams. 
The women's tennis team won the North Star Conference every year it was a member, and the Irish figure to have similar success in the MCC. In the North Star, the Irish had to play dual matches with confer­ence opposition in the fall, but in the MCC the Irish only will have to compete in the MCC tournament. 
Volleyball 

The volleyball team will leave the North Star after this season, but will not join the MCC for two more years. 
"For the next two years, we'll basically be an indepen­dent," said Irish volleyball coach Art Lambert. "We'll see in two years what the situation is with the MCC. This is no real benefit to us."

IT'S OUR POLICY.-­
By BRIAN O'GARA Assistant Sports Editor 
Cool and calm in the locker room. Excited in the tunnel. And downright dangerous on the football field. 
That's a brief definition of freshman tailback Ricky Wat­ters, whose membership in Notre Dames· 'Pony-Express' backfield has given Irish fans a lot to cheer about and even more to look forward to. 
The rookie has run for 261 yards and two touchdowns on 58 carries, the third-best rush­ing numbers on a team whose offense revolves around the running game. 
Next Saturday when the Irish travel to Penn State to face the defending national champions, it will be a homecoming of sorts for the Harrisburg, Pa., native. 
Like so many top high school players, Watters was inun­dated with scholarship offers to several top schools, including the Nittany Lions. But Watters and his family were particu­larly impressed with the sin­cerity of Head Coach Lou Holtz. 
"He comes to your house," says Watters, "and he gives you that little smile and wink, he makes you feel so relaxed around him. As if he was saying, 'I have plans for you in the future.' And you tend to believe everything he says. I don't really know what it is. My Mom and Dad just loved him from the beginning. After he came to visit it was all 'Holtz, Holtz, Holtz.' "

Holtz counters with similiar wishbone in the Irish offensive praise, citing the rapid im­attack, Watters has been able provement of his young back. to take his quickness and drive 
"The improvement Ricky has made since being here has been fantastic," says Holtz. "The biggest way he has im­proved is that he has better body lean and falls forward, whereas before Ricky just tried to beat every tackler." 
Thanks to Holtz' use of several runners in his attack, Watters has seen minutes on the field and on the sideline. 
"No matter who you put in, we're all going to do our job," says the freshman. "I like the way Coach Holtz gets us in there and gets our feet wet, to see what college football is all about. Coaches generally don't like to play freshmen, so I'm happy just getting time." 
Humble thoughts for a guy named to USA Today's first­team All-America squad last fall. But when one thinks of the company he is keeping these days, it easy to see why. 
"You just have to marvel at a person like Tim Brown," says Watters. "You watch him play and see the things he can do, and yet he is so humble. Tim Brown, as good as he is, he's blocking for me. I'm a fresh­
man.  He's just such  a  great  
competitor.  
"Mark  Green  is the  same  

way," adds Watters. "They are just competative people. They don't run around and say 'I'm gonna kick your butt.' They just do it." 
With the emergence of the to the outside off the pitch with impressive results. 

"I love it (the option)," says Watters. "I like to go to the out­side right now. Next year I'd like to get up to about 205 so I can be effective inside. Now when I get inside and through a hole, I look for something else, like another hole, instead of making things happen myself." 
Though he may be hesitant 

squirting through the middle of the line, Watters is not shy about the thrill of playing Notre Dame football. 
"You come outside the locker room," says Watters, "and you hear the band and the crowd saying 'Here come the Irish.' And you're thinking, 'That's right, here we come.' Whatever the team, it doesn't matter who is out there--Miami, Alabama, Michigan, whoever --here we come. 
"When teams come in here, I don't think they expect to beat us. They want to win, but I know they see the gold helmets and it strikes fear in their hearts. When we walk out and look at them, you just feel so strong. I know our stadium has to do that to them, because it gets me so pumped up when I play there." 
And when Watters takes the option pitch and jukes by oppo­nents, you just know he's not the only one in the stadium who's pumped up.

top three individuals advanc­ing to the NCAA champion­ships. 
The Irish are coming off a disappointing second-place finish in the North Star Confer­ence Meet two weeks ago, a meet marked by inconsistent performances. DePaul placed three runners ahead of Notre Dame's top runner, a fact that led Ryan to begin looking for a frontrunner to emerge and compete for individual honors. 
Junior co-captain Theresa Rice will be Ryan's best bet to challenge the leaders. Rice emerged as one of the top run­ners in the district early in the season, but tapered off toward the end of the campaign, finish­ing 15th at the Indiana Inter­collegiates and eighth at the North Star. Rice finished 98th last year at the districts. 

Challenging Rice for the top spot will be senior co-captain Julia Merkel. Merkel was ninth at the Indiana Intercollegiates and lOth at the North Star. She finished 51st in last year's meet. Junior Terry Kibelstis will compete for the second week in a row after being sidelined for seven weeks with a stress fracture. Kibelstis returned to the squad in grand style last weekend with a ninth­place finish at the North Star and will be near 100 percent this week. 
Joining the top three runners will be senior Kathleen Leh­man, sophomore Linda Filar and freshman Jenny Ledrick. Lehman has been consistent at the fourth and fifth spots, while Ledrick has been a pleasant surprise that gives Ryan hope for a bright future. Filar battles Lehman for the final point-scoring position.

strong competition for the Irish this weekend. Loyola recorded an early-season victory against the Irish, capturing the Na­tional Catholic Title, a meet in which the Irish finished second. Indiana scored a naore recent win over the Irish, edging them by a meager 10 points, enroute to the Indiana Intercollegiate from sopho~o~e Mike O'Connor, JUmor Ron Markezich and senior captain Dan Garrett. Markezich and O'Connor were among the top five to cross the line in the In­diana Intercollegiate Meet, while Garrett broke the tape in the dual meet against USC. 

The Irish hopes will also lie heavily on the shoulders of the Irish fourth and fifth finishers.

Three teams out of 40 will be selected out of this weekend's NCAA District IV Men's Cross Country Meet to compete in the NCAA Championships in Char­lottesville, Va. The road is a rocky one, but Notre Dame hopes to pull out a great performance. 
For the Irish, the path to the finale must go by way of Bowling Green, site of the District IV this Saturday. And while 40 teams vie for the three invites, the presence of two squads who are among the top 10 in the nation, third­ranked Wisconsin and number seven, Illinois, reduces the magic number to 
one. 

Head Coach Joe Piane, now in his 13th year, feels that the Irish are competing in the 'most difficult district in the country to qualify.'

Both the men's and women's cross country teams will see district 
action this weekend. Greg Andres and Greg Guffey have the related see MEN, page 13 stories. 

MCC to have varied effects on Notre Dame 
By STEVE MEGARGEE Sports Writer 
The University of Notre Dame announced last month that it would rejoin the Midwes­tern Collegiate Conference on a full-time basis. 
Other schools in the MCC in­clude Butler, Dayton, Detroit, Evansville, Loyola, St. Louis and Xavier. 
Notre Dame will have six men's sports --baseball, cross country, golf, soccer, swim­ming and tennis --competing in the conference. Women's teams participating in the MCC include basketball, cross country, swimming, tennis and volleyball. 
From 1982 to 1986, Notre Dame had served as a part­time member of the MCC, but had left to become an indepen­dent Women's teams are cur­rently participating in the North Star Conference, a con­ference which the Irish will be leaving next year for the MCC. 
From here, things start get­ting confusing. Different teams will be entering the conference at different times. The confer­ence membership also figures to help some teams, such as baseball and possibly soccer, while providing no apparent benefit to others. 
Baseball 
If Notre Dame wins the MCC post-season tournament this spring, the Irish would receive an automatic berth to an NCAA Regional. Winners of these six­team regionals advance to the College World Series. 
Of course, that's easier said than done. In games with con­ference teams last year, the Irish lost single games to But­ler and Detroit, dropped two of three to St. Louis and split two games with Xavier. 
"I think the conference is strong for baseball," said Irish head coach Pat Murphy. "It's not like the Big Ten or Big Eight, but it's strong in its own right Detroit, Xavier and Evansville have very good baseball teams." 
Basketball 
The men's basketball team will continue to compete as an independent, and the women's team will play its final season in the North Star Conference this year. 
In the 1988-1989 season, the women's basketball team will join the MCC. First-year Irish coach Muffet McGraw figures the MCC will be similar to the North Star competition. 
"I think they're similar, both have strong teams at the top," said McGraw. "Dayton, Detroit, Loyola and Notre Dame will be the top four teams. I think we can win it" 

McGraw hopes an MCC title will provide an automatic berth to the NCAA tournament by the 1988-89 season. Right now, nei­ther the MCC or North Star champion earns an automatic bid. 
McGraw said that the chances of this occurring would improve greatly if the NCAA tournament expands to 48 teams. 
Cross Country 
The men's and women's cross country teams' participa­tion in the MCC, beginning next fall, will consist of one MCC meet during the fall. 
Men's coach Joe Piane ex­pects to see his main competi­tion in the conference coming from Loyola. 
"When we were in the MCC for four years before, we won the cross country three times, but Loyola has vastly im­proved, and beat us earlier this 
Brown only one not sure of Heisman winner 
Tim Brown's name is already on the Heisman Trophy. 
All the Notre Dame flanker has to do now is make sure Alabama, Penn State and Miami don't erase it. And for Brown's name to be erased, the senior probably would have to fall on his face every-time he touches the ball. Or maybe run backwards a few times. 
Not likely. In fact, it's pretty safe to say that the nation will see a few more defenders falling on their faces and running backwards when Brown touches the ball in these next three weeks. 
According to a poll of about 15 percent of the Heisman voters conducted last week by USA Today, Brown would win by a landslide if the vote took place this afternoon. Brown garnered 80 first-place votes out of 147 surveyed, and a total of 317 points. Florida tailback Emmitt Smith was second with 85 points, and Syracuse quarterback Don McPherson received 82 points. 
This means Brown is faced with a problem some thousands of college football players would love to be faced with. Now he has to think about it -some­thing he's been trying not to do all year. 
"I really didn't think about it until last spring, when I was on the cover of some magazines," Brown said Wednesday. "People were telling me I was going to be the No. 1 candidate. Hearing things like that makes you think about what you're doing. 
"Even to be considered for a trophy like that is an honor for me ... It's nice to know that people consider me to be ahead." 
Brown's performance against Boston College this past Saturday put some distance between him and the other Heisman candidates. 
The Dallas native picked up a career high 294 all-purpose yards in Notre Dame's 32-25 victory over the Eagles, which boosted the squad's record under second-year Head Coach Lou Holtz to 7-1.

Brown acknowledges that the race for the Heis­man isn't over yet, but says he senses that his efforts are finally paying off. 
"It's about time," Brown said, when asked about his personal achievements and the team's success this season. "I've paid my dues. I work hard and I try to be the best at what I'm doing, and it's starting to pay off for me and the team.

The women's cross country team will attempt to put a rollercoaster season of injuries and late-season inconsis­tencies behind it Saturday at the NCAA District IV meet in Bowling Green. 
With the full squad healthy and en­joying the benefits of a week of rest, the Irish are in a good position to im­prove on last year's 20th-place finish. Coach Dan Ryan, though, cautions about the certainty of the improved finish. 
"Our goal during the season has been to finish in the top 10 at districts," Ryan said. "But I will be happy with any im­provement over last year's 20th-place finish. The field of runners at this year's district meet is much stronger than last year's field." 
A total of 38 teams will compete in the meet with the top two teams and

year," said Piane. "Loyola's very good, occasionally Detroit has a good runner or two and Butler has a runner or two. 
Golf 

Entering the MCC this spring, Notre Dame will com­pete in an MCC championship, and will be eligible for the all­conference teams and the Coach of the Year award. 
Notre Dame has no actual MCC regular-season competi­tion, but the Irish will face the majority of the MCC teams in various tournaments through­out the spring. 
"We've faced almost every one of these teams before, and they're getting better. It will be a very worthwhile conference for us," said Irish golf coach Noel O'Sullivan.

more games to play, and anything can happen." But don't count on it. 
The games coaches play. 
Holtz expressed concern at his weekly press con­ference over whether the Irish will be able to run the ball effectively against the Crimson Tide on Saturday. 
"If there's one thing they're going to do," Holtz said, "it's shut off the run. LSU, I felt, was one of the finest offensive football teams and Alabama shut them off completely." 
Next up, Alabama coach Bill Curry. 
Curry, in his media teleconference held Wednes­day afternoon, expressed concern over whether his defense will be able to stop the powerful Notre Dame ground attack. 
"LSU did run well on us," Curry said of the game Alabama won by a 22-10 score. "You know they (the Irish) are going to use their strength to come out and hammer on us." 
So who do you believe? 
They both have legitimate concerns. 
Alabama ran circles around the Irish last year in the Tide's 28-10 whipping of Notre Dame, and the
