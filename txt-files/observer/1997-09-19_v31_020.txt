Six years ago, Sara Haber got a proposition she just could not refuse. 
Members of South Bend's Hispanic community approached Haber about cre­ating a family-oriented pro­
gram, one aimed at facilitating the cultural transition for 

incoming minority families. 
Initially, Haber envisioned an organization helping Hispanic families learn basic "survival" English. However, as discussions progressed and

By ALLISON KOENIG Saint Mary's News Editor 
The Saint Mary's College Alumnae Board is on campus this weekend for one of its two meetings this year. Eighteen women sit on the board that represents Saint Mary's 18,000 alumnae. -Each member serves two con­secutive three-year terms. While on the board, each member must reside on two committees which focus on such projects as facilitating relationships between the alumnae and stu­dents and between the alumnae and faculty. 
"One must indicate a willing­ness to be on the board,.. said Ann Korb '54, who is in her

"Manners are how to treat peo­ple. Etiquette is knowing how to treat people," said Saint Mary's Alumnae Board member Carrie Mueller, in her opening comments at the third annual "Grace Under Pressure: Your Guide to Professional Etiquette." 
The cocktail party/information session, which was held last night in Haggar Parlor, is directed toward junior and senior women who will shortly be entering the professional world. The evening is sponsored by the Alumnae Board, who is in town this weekend for one of its semi-annual meetings. 
"It's so good to see so many alumnae involved. They genuinely want to help us in the profession­al world," senior Cicely Campo said. 
Mueller began the evening with a brief instruction on how to make a solid first impression from personal appearance to a firm handshake. 
Muller was followed by Kevin Kirwan, director of dining ser­vices. who addressed several 
silverware to use, how to decide what to order, what to wear and 
how to  arrive at a  business din­ 
ner.  
"I do  not pretend to  be Miss  

Manners," he joked. "Most of this stuff you all have learned from your mom, dad or grandma." 
Nevertheless, a little bit of review does not hurt, he said. Kirwan instructed students that whenever in doubt of what is proper, they should follow the example of the rest of the crowd. "Be yourself. Use common sense," he concluded. 
The group was then ushered into the Chameleon Room, where board members performed light skits to demonstrate the proper approach to leaving voice mail messages, calling alumnae for networking purposes and follow­ing-up calls on resumes or inter­views. 
For the final segment of the evening, a representative from the retail store Talbot's briefed the students on how to purchase

Disease Center's survey shows decline in AIDS deaths 
ATlANTA 
New cases of AIDS in the United States fell 6 percent last year, the first drop since the epidemic began in the early 1980s, and the government credits powerful new drugs. 
The same period also showed a drop in AIDS deaths, a trend reported by the government earlier this year. 
Deaths from the disease fell 23 percent, from an estimated 50,140 in 1995 to about 38,780 in 1996, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Thursday. 
In 1996, an estimated 56,730 people were diagnosed with

Travolta attacks censorship 
WASHINGTON 

The subject was serious -religious persecution -but girlish giggles echo­ing in a Capitol hearing room Thursday signaled that some serious star wattage also was under careful review: John Travolta. ''I'm, like, 'Oh, geez, it's him,"' said 16-year-old Shauna Pond of South Jordan, Utah, as she and her youth group studying 


leadership at the Capitol peeked in to watch Travolta testify. "He's a hotty." But the actor was directing all of his heat and anger at Germany, accusing its government of harassing and discriminating against his fellow practi­tioners of Scientology, a religion with many big-name members. Travolta, who starred in "Phenomenon" last year, said two leading political parties in Germany called for a boycott of the film. They also told moviegoers to stay away from Scientologist Tom Cruise's film, "Mission Impossible." "We can chuckle about it because in the overall scheme of things these boycotts did no great harm," Travolta told lawmakers, reading from a script. "However, the mere attempt by politicians to censor art because of the artist's religious affiliation sends chills down my spine." 
Teamsters plead guilty to charges 
NEW YORK 

Three key players in a scheme to funnel illegal contri­butions to Teamsters President Ron Carey's re-election campaign pleaded guilty in federal court Thursday and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors. Two of them, in separate court appearances, implicated the Democratic National Committee, the Clinton-Gore campaign and the AFL-CIO in the scheme. Martin Davis, a Washington political consultant, and Jere Nash, Carey's former cam­paign manager, each pleaded guilty to conspiring to fun­nel union funds through political groups into Carey's re­election bid against James P. Hoffa. Michael Ansara, the owner of a Massachusetts telemark-eting firm that did business with the Teamsters, pled guilty to creating a shell company that helped Davis and Nash carry out one of their schemes. Nash and Davis were expected to be interviewed by a court-appointed officer who will deter­mine next month whether.Carey will be disqualified from a rerun election for union president. Ansara was already providing information to the election.

Major accounting firms to merge 
NEW YORK 
Coopers & Lybrand is merging with Price Waterhouse to create the world's biggest accounting company, reducing the industry's Big Six to the Big Five. The deal, announced Thursday, is the industry's first rcshuffiing since the 1980s, when there was once a Big Eight. Financial terms and the name of the new company were not disclosed, and the merger is subject to final approval from the partners at the two firms. The new company would surpass Andersen Worldwide as the biggest in the industry. With more than $13 billion in annual fees com­bined, the two firms have about 135,000 employees worldwide, including more than 8,500 partners. Industry watchers said the combination will help the two firms achieve the kind of growth they need to compete more effectively with their bigger competitors. Based on 1996 revenues, Price is No. 6, Coopers No. 5. With expecta­tions of growth, no job cuts are planned, said Jan Butler, a spokeswoman for Price Waterhouse. The merger comes at a time when accounting firms are battling to increase consulting revenue as the growth of their audit­ing and tax businesses lags. The two companies said that consulting would be a strong focus of the merged firm and that they also hope to attract clients by having a big­ger global presence. 
Child support laws to be reformed 
WASIIINGTON 
With billions of dollars in child support uncollected each year. new legislation is aimed at prodding the states into doing a better job of tracking down dead­beats. The bill, expected to sail through the House, would create a method for dividing up federal money to aid child-support collection programs, basing payments on various aspects of the process. "The old incentive sys­tem for child-support enforcement just doesn't cut it," said Donna Shalala, the Health and Human Services sec­retary, as she endorsed the legislation this week. "It doesn't base rewards on results." Meanwhile, about a dozen states continue to worry about losing all their child-support money after they miss an Oct. 1 deadline to computerize their collection systems. Under the cur­rent system, Washington rewards states based on how much money they collect. The House plan, approved by a subcommittee Thursday, bases payments on how many newborns have paternity established and how many child-support court orders are established. 
said. 
The CDC said powerful drugs such as protease inhibitors are apparently pre­ve·nting infection with the AIDS virus from progressing to full-blown AIDS, especially in patients who start taking the medication early. 
"We are seeing for the first time in this epidemic a sub­stantial decline in AIDS inci­dence," said Patricia Fleming, the CDC chief of HIV/AIDS reporting and analysis. "That's very good news." 
Some figures remain trou­bling: AIDS cases diagnosed in 1996 rose 19 percent among heterosexual black

parking for the additional fans worked well for the first week­end (Sept. 6), with more than enough parking spaces avail­able, " Johnson said. 
"Traffic, however, moved con­siderably slower than we had hoped, and we will continue to work with area law enforcement agencies to improve it. Still, fans should plan to allow extra travel time to and from the sta­dium," he said. 
Notre Dame has added a new entrance on Pendle Road to the 6,000-space general parking area on Juniper Road north of campus. 
The Juniper Road entrance to this parking also has been widened to accommodate more lanes of traffic. 
Since parking on the south side of campus is limited, 
Johnson said fans are urged to use the parking areas at Juniper and Pendle and at Holy Cross College and St. Joseph's High School on U.S. 33 immediately west of the University.

"We realized these families might want open discussions about what they were feeling, as well as health care, nutri­tional information, computer training and basic encourage­ment," she said. "There is so much we can do to help, it was a matter of getting all the ideas together." 
In January 1992, El Buen Veeino, "The Good Neighbor," was born. Today, the organiza­tion employs over 100 volun­teers; more than 35 of them are students from Notre Dame, Saint Mary's and other local schools.

"This is such a hands-on vol­unteer job," she said. "I work with the kids, and what we do is totally up to me and how cre­ative I can be." 
Wilkinson spends a good deal of time helping the children with homework, giving them what she terms the "one-on­one" attention they might not get at school. 
"We also do a book log with them -they read a book and keep a journal about it," she said. "We reinforce things that they learn in school. It's great working with them." 
Haber's organization also offers another program called EDUTHA, a word compiled from the Spanish verbs for "work" and "educate." With EDUTHA, volunteers go to a family's home in a group of three.

"One person talks to the adults, helping them learn English -that's EDUTRA's focus," Haber said. "One per­son works with school-age chil­dren, and the third spends time with the youngest children." 
She stresses that EDUTRA, as well as El Buen Vecino's other offerings, centers around the preservation of the family by teaching it to survive in a for­eign culture. · 
"We want to help them be economically and socially self­sufficient, " Haber said. "It's truly a support system." 
Despite the community's demand for a program like El Buen Vecino, it remained with­out funding for the first two years of its operation, Haber said, forcing her to work with­out a salary. 
In 1994, the Indianapolis Department of Commerce 
agreed to review El Buen Vecino and its programs to determine whether it merited funding. 
"Our prayers were answered, and on April 1, we opened our doors as a funded organiza­tion," Haber said. "That's when we really felt we could get going on our ideas." 
Now, the group is seeking additional funding from the city of South Bend -but Haber will not be the one doing the asking. 
"The children are drafting a proposal for a new program called Minority Educational Training Assistance," she said. "The ideas are theirs, and we decided to let them handle the presentation. We're proud of what they've come up with." 
Through META, high school teenagers would be provided with scholarship information and computer training. In addi: tion, volunteers would coach them about job interviews, cul­minating in videotaped mock­interviews to critique the teens' progress. 
"MET A isn't just encouraging them to continue education, it's showing them the value of edu­cation," Haber said. "But even now, by working on its develop­ment, the children are learning so much responsibility." 
Among Haber's most cher­ished, and rewarding moments at El Buen Vecino are the times when "alumni" return and par­ticipate in the organization from the other side. 
"It is proof that what we're doing works when these people come back as role models for the community," Haber said. "The way everyone -volunteers and participants -have come together through El Buen Vecino makes me so proud."

Inn offers new amenities, more space this season 

By MELANIE GARMAN 
Sainr Mary's Assistant News Editor 
Whether it be business or pleasure, The Inn at Saint Mary's has been accommodating Saint Mary's and Notre Dame students, parents and alumni since its opening in 1992. 
The inn, which is owned by The Holiday Corporation and the Sisters of the Holy Cross, is centrally located on the campus of Saint Mary's, adjacent to the Notre Dame campus, and only minutes from both the airport and downtown South Bend. 
Along with its convenient location, the inn is also known for its many luxurious and accom­modating features. There are 150 rooms and suites with 16 different floorplans designed to meet the various needs required by the travel­ing public. 
"We specialize in service," said general man­ager Louis Christian. "Not only do the rooms supply coffee makers, ironing boards, hair dri­ers, microwaves and refrigerators, we also provide complimentary continental breakfasts,

The Inn at Saint Mary's is also committed to the corporate business traveler by offering a 24-hour business center with complimentary fax machine, computer and printer. All of the business suites carry two-line phones, modem ports and free access to the interview room. 
In 1996, the inn underwent an expansion which added 30 new rooms, a state of the art exercise facility, whirlpool and sauna.

guest, George Nelson. According to director of sales Kim Allsop, the high demand for rooms makes meeting the needs of the Saint Mary's and Notre Dame communities difficult. "What we try to do for parents is give them a chance to 
book in advance by using a lottery system," said Allsop. 
"If parents stay with us for orientation weekend, we then offer them a room for sophomore parents weekend, and the same is true for each occasion." "Usually the people we see at graduation time, we've seen for four years." said Christian. "I also think the location between the two campuses brings back the college ambiance for some of the parents and makes them remember their college days." Front office manager Michelle Fean, is a graduate of Saint Mary's who worked at the inn during all four of her college years .

The board members reside all over the 'tountry, which is an intentional reflection of the current Saint Mary's stu­dent population. 
The board members are also staggered according to their year of graduation, resulting in a unit who repre­sents all SMC graduates, instead of just one particular age group. 
The Alumnae Board also works during the year in strong collaboration with the Oifice of Admissions. 
The admissions staff, who is constantly traveling to various high schools across the coun­try, cannot reach every desired location. 
Alumnae Board members have beep known to attend college fairs in their areas as representatives of Saint Mary's.

SMC's SURV aims to be a 'source of hope' 
By MICHELLE S. PRIMEAU News Writer 
Nestled away in the landing between the second and third floors of the Haggar College Center, the Spes Unica Resource and Volunteer office (SUHV) of Saint Mary's College is reaching out to make a name for itself. SURV works to con­nect students, faculty, and cam­pus organizations to service agencies in the South Bend area. 
SURV fulfills a role previously addressed by Notre Dame's Center for Social Concerns. Through it, members of the SMC community can find oppor­tunities that are tailored and true to the motto "Spes Unica" -one hope. 
"We want to be a source of hope to those we serve, those who need," Sister Linda Kors director of SURV, stated. 
"We're trying to make this a 
focus on campus so people 
make service a natural part of 
their lives." 
Kors, who was hired this past year, contaeted every SMC stu­dent by letter during the sum­mer or within the first weeks of the semester. The office is not only looking for involvement, but input as well. Along with student workers sophomore Katie Cousino and junior Elizabeth Krick, Kors is compil­ing a book of volunteer opportu­nities based on student inter­ests. 
SURV has access to opportu­nities ranging from tutoring children to assisting those with disabilities. The office is also developing a program to have student liaisons with each agency in the South Bend area to be on a service board.

Turner donates money to U.N. 


The Associated Press 
NEW YORK 

Media mogul Ted Turner pledged $1 billion Thursday to create a new foundation to benefit United Nations causes, such as helping refugees, fight~ ing disease and cleaning up land mines. 
Turner said his net worth was $2.2 billion as of Jan. 1, but had since grown to $3.2 billion. He said he would donate $1 00 million of Time Warner stock every year for the next 10 years to the new foundation that will work· with various U.N. committees. 
Turner said he was about to be named to Forbes maga~ zine's list of the top zs· richest Americans, "and l'm going to push myself down the list." 
Turner made the announce~ ment at a Manhattan hotel while receiving the Global Leadership Award from the United Nations Association of the United States ofAmerica. A nonprofit organization which

"We haven't pried ... no

Three thousand miles away, students at this prestigious uni­versity began to catch some of the excitement surrounding the Clintons' arrival -complete with motorcade, press corps and Secret Service agents. 
Reporters and photographers hustled about the sprawling campus to make last-minute arrangements to cover the start of Chelsea's freshman year. 
Scores of students also were busy Thursday, helping to set up chairs in Stanford's main quad for a welcoming ceremo­ny. Some, despite the waves of people with notebooks and cameras, were pleased that Chelsea, 17, had chosen Stanford. 
"I think it's great that she's coming here," said sophomore Jan Chong. 
Chelsea will move into her dorm on Friday and meet her roommate, selected by the uni­versity. She and her parents planned to attend the welcom­ing ceremony. 
Their goodbyes promised to be emotional, but quick. Like most freshman parents;· the Clinton planned to spend just one day moving their daughter into her new dorm room. Then, the president would move on to

"He's going to have to get on with his life," said McCurry. And Chelsea is "going to have to get on with her's. Pretty sim­ple." 
She'll have four more days of orientation before classes start on Wednesday. 
Under cloudless late summer skies Thursday, maintenance crews tidied landscaping, swept streets, touched up paint and delivered food· to the dining halls. 
Journalists also have been at Stanford for days, figuring out how to cover the first family's activities despite stringent restrictions. Virtually all orien­tation activities at the private university are off limits to the media. 
The Clintons don't want the presence of reporters to inter­fere with other families' last hours with their children -or their own with Chelsea. 
"They want to be typical par­ents," said Marsha Berry, a spokeswoman for Mrs. Clinton. 
And Chelsea -by all accounts an unaffected young woman who doesn't seek spe­cial treatment -wants to be a typical student. That's exactly how Stanford students intend to treat her.

Peace talk plans look dim 
By ROBERT REID Associated Press Writer 
NEWYOHK 
Prospects for a peace confer­ence for the Korean Peninsula appear dim because North Korea refuses to budge on its demand that the talks address the withdrawal of U.S. troops from South Korea. 
Diplomatic sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the North Koreans appeared to be stonewalling in hopes of winning promises of more food aid from the United States and South Korea. 
Negotiators from the United States, China, South Korea and North Korea were to meet again today at Columbia University to discuss the last obstacle to the conference ­whether the issue of U.S. troops would be on the agen­da. 
The conference would try to replace the 1953 armistice that ended fighting in the Korean War with a more per­manent security arrangement, such as a peace treaty. 
During preparatory talks last month, all four delegations agreed to send their foreign ministers to Geneva within 60 days of completing prelimi­nary negotiations. 
To do that, all four also must agree on the conference agen­da. The United States, South Korea and China are willing to keep the agenda general, without a specific reference to 
the status of U.S. troops. 
But the North Koreans insist that the participants agree in advance that they will discuss the removal of the 37,000­strong U.S. force stationed in South Korea. 
North Korea also wants a separate peace treaty with the United States, excluding South Korea. 
After a monthlong break, the delegations resumed their dis­cussions Thursday at Columbia University. But well­informed sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the North Koreans repeated their demand for a specific agenda. 
Thursday's talks adjourned after only 2 1/2 hours with no progress, the sources said. As the delegations left the build­ing, they passed about 40 Korean students holding ban­ners in Korean and English reading "End the Korean War Now." 
Unless the North Koreans soften their demand, the cur­rent round of preliminary talks will break up with noth­ing more than an agreement to try again later. 
South Korea's Yonhap News Agency quoted an unnamed South Korean official as saying the North's position seemed to have hardened since the August talks. 
North Korea long has sought a peace agreement with Washington to replace the armistice in hopes of removing American troops from the South. 
Last year, President Clinton and South Korean President Kim Young Sam offered the four-power formula, leading to months of on-again, off-again negotiations with the North on the details of the proposed conference.

It is difficult to describe a~d communicate all ofthe thoughts and emotions running through me as I write this. I Love You, and I Love Luke and I(aty, but I don'tfeel these terms completely. reflect what you and the family mean to me. My love for you is encircled with a driving 
sense ofdevotion and strengthened by the happiness, joy, and laughter you bring to my life. You havegiven to me things I had never imagined possible, and reminded me what life is meant to be about. The day I met you I knew that my life would be changing in very different ways, because I knew that you weregoing to be a part ofmy life and I a part ofyoursfor a long time to come. This initial sense oflove, understanding, devotion, happiness, joy and laugh­ter hasgrown exponentially with each day thatpasses. I believe a bet­ter way to express these feelings is to say YOU ARE MY WORLD! I know we were meant to be together and I am positive that I was meant to be a part ofyour life and that we were meant to share our lives togeth­er. A greatphilosopher once said it was actions, not words, that b-rought 

about meaning and understanding. It is imperative that you understand what all ofthese abstract emotions and thoughts mean to me and;·ust how deeply I believe them. However, words alone can notfully accomplish this goal; instead action must be taken. Hence, it is Friday night at 8:30pm and I am behind you at this moment on bended knee asking. ..

ND/SMC stereotypes: 
It's time to face them 
In the five days since The Observer published a letter by Notre 
Dame sophomores Catherine Syner and Stacey Fuller, letters 
have poured in-a few in support ofSyner and Fuller, most in 
condemnation. As anyone can see, these women have obviously 
hit a nerve within the Notre Dame and Saint Mary's communi­
ties. 

In voicing their opinion. however misguided, these two young 
women have voiced the opinions of a number ofstudents on the 
Notre Dame campus -hopefully a minority -and this fact 
cannot be' ignored. They have also brought to the surface the 
tensions which exist between students on both sides of U.S. 33 
because of stereotypes. , · 
"Saint Mary's girls are dumb and pretty." "Notre Dame girls 
are ugly and fat." These images are introduced from the first 
days of freshman orientation when open·minded and impres· 
sionable freshmen come to both campuses with few precon­
ceived ideas of their nQW home and their new neighbors. Within 
the first few overwhelming weeks, however, stereotypes are 
introduced which establish an immediate barrier between the 
women of both schools. 

With nothing to break the ice and few non-social interactions 
between the two schools, these early stereotypes continue 
through the years and arc passed on from class to class. It is 
only as students from both schools get to know each other 
through classes, activities or service that these stereotypes are 
proven wrong. Bad experiences at dorm parties, Bridget's or, 
sadly enough. even football games are not going to break 
stereotypes; they will only reinforce this prejudiced thinking. 
Searching tor the blame in this situation will not resolve the 
tensions which have created it. Svner and Fuller are not to 
blame -they are in fad victims as much as the Saint Mary's 
women they criticize. Each are victims of stereotypes taught to 
them by their "knowledgeable" peers from the origins of their 
college career. Syner and Fuller may never get to know any of 
the wonderful women of Saint Mary's as the result of this con· 
tinued stereotype -and it will be their loss. 
It is the responsibility of students onboth sides of the road to 
respect one another and to avoid making these unbased-and 
frankly immature-conclusions about one another. 
The letter brought to light the tensions which exist. The ques­
tion now remains: What can be done to prevent these stereo­
types from being passed to future generations of Notre Dame 
and Saint Mary's students? \.Ye encourage all students, and par­
ticularly both student governments. to work toward an answer. 
The Observer will be featuring a series of articles next week which will focus on the origin ofstereotypes between the schools and the history ofNotre Dame and Saint Mary's as a collective community. 
• lETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Saint Mary's Invites Friendship 
Today we stand together as a proud community of women. Today we celebrate Saint Mary's College -a women's college with a 153-year tradition of excellence and integrity rooted in a strong sense of spirituality. The history behind our college, the caliber of academics. the choice to remain an all­women's institution, and the inexplicable female unity that exists are what we have set out to cham­pion. 
We at Saint Mary's understand and willingly acknowledge that Notre Dame is an integral part of our college experience, but ultimately we are women of Saint Mary's. 
Notre Dame, Saint Mary's, and Holy Cross are separate and unique communities, each with our own identity. However. we create another entity, separate and unique in its own right-the HCCIND/SMC community. For over 150 years the men and women of this community have helped each other to grow academically, socially, and spiritually. This is something of which we should all be proud. 
Today we offer a formal invitation to the students of Notre Dame and Holy Cross to walk down our avenue, laugh in our halls, and study in our classrooms. We invite you to enjoy all that our campus has to offer. Ultimately. we offer you a friendship between equals.

Notre Dame Student Recounts Wake Experience 
LONDON 

For the past week and a half, I, along with the other individuals studying in London for the semester, have witnessed first hand the effects surrounding the death of Princess Diana. It has certainly been a unique experi­ence. As you all kno"· and probably watched on TV, the funeral was held just two weeks ago. A few of us decid­ed that in order to participate fully in the funeral service we would have to camp out Friday night. I was given the responsibility of going first to get a good spot. That spot was right in front of Westminster Abbey, and I claimed 
Josh Gerloff 

our territory around noon on Friday-approximately 24 hours before the service was to begin. As it turned out, my buddies never found me. This is an account of my night alone (actually, surrounded by hundreds of thou­sands of people) on the streets of London. 
1 p.m. Friday: After "fighting" my way through an already enormous crowd. I have finally found a spot right in front ofWestminster Abbey. I am about three people back, but a police officer assured me that this wouldn't be a problem. Time to start my wait, only 22 hours until the funeral. 
3 p.m.: After reading for about half an hour, I started meeting the people around me. There is a group of four older ladies (I'm guessing they're in their early 50s) to my right. One is from Wales and the others from Ireland. Another lady directly behind me and of the same age is from England; she was on her way to visit her daughter-in-law when she decided that she wanted and needed to be here instead. All she has is a back­pack. Then, to my left, are Ash and Michelle. Michelle is 25 and teaches at a local college. Ash, also 25, is a musi­cian; he is the lead singer for a techno group called Fresh. Supposedly they are getting fairly big. After just 
finishing another album and filming their first video, they are getting ready to start a tour of Europe. Ash says the group has spoken numerous times with a producer in the U.S., so some gigs in the States are a definite pos­sibility. Ash and Michelle have also come extremely pre­pared. Along with a big comfortable bed spread, they brought rain gear, tons of food, a CD player, water and Gatorade, and a "shrine" (candles) for when it gets dark. I, on other other hand, brought no food, drink, or music. It might be a long night. 
8:45p.m.: The day has certainly proved to be interest­ing. I don't know why I didn't prepare better for it, but it has rained on and ofT all day. Basically it is a pain and extremely uncomfortable. Ash, Michelle, and I have shared quite a few laughs but plenty more expletives. I am amazed at how friendly everyone has been. All day people have been so generous to us "campers." Various people throughout the day and well into the night have provided drinks (coffee and water), food (snack, sand­wiches, fried rice), and plastic bags (to keep dry). I should have written at 6 p.m. because the Queen addressed the nation. I was totally shocked by the reac­tion of the people around me. Almost everyone ·shook their heads in disgust, clearly believing it was a poor waste of radio space. Everyone (nearly all British) thought she sounded fake and thought her speech was way too short and forced. I knew the monarchy had severely dropped in public opinion, but I didn't realize it was this bad. The amount of media here is incredible. There is a constant flow of interviewers seeking infor­mation from us. Ash has been interviewed by quite a few; he stands out in the crowd. He has "good" stuff for them because he was in Paris the weekend Diana died. In fact, the Friday of the weekend she passed away, he was trapped in the tunnel in which Diana died. Ash said that it was a horrible place to die -it was extremely dirty and smelled awful. 

9:30p.m.: Word had been passed along that at exactly 9 p.m. (according to Big Ben) we would all sing "Amazing Grace." Sure enough, right after the clock 
stopped chiming, we all started singing. The first verse was fairly strong, but as expected, the volume decreased as the verses continued. After the first verse, Ash and I had to resort to humming. People are beginning to crash. Many of the older people are already asleep. My big back-pack is a pillow for Michelle and me. If it doesn't rain, we should be okay. Ash and I contemplated a trip to the wine shop, but decided against it. We were at a funeral -not to mention we had to be up early to hold our positions. Big Ben is so beautiful at night. Spotlighted just like the Dome back at school, it can be seen for quite some distance. It is like a giant eye watch­ing over the city. We campers really have formed a tight group. Most have found sleeping to be impossible at this time, so many small circles have opened up with fantas­tic candle displays in the middle. There are many laughs and even a few bottles of wine -anything to help get through the night on this hard cobblestone. 
10:30 p.m.: Ash just played me some of his music. I'm not the biggest fan of techno, but Fresh was pretty good. Ash tells me they just signed with Sony Records and are currently working on setting up a concert with the Spice Girls. We got to talking about writing music, and he told me he's currently working on a ballad called "Didn't Get a Chance to Say Goodbye." He started it because he had a 21-year-old cousin die recently, but now he's really into it because of Diana. Ash loved her dearly. Most peo­ple arc here to take pictures to be able to say later that they were here, but not Ash. He brought no camera and frowns every time he sees one go ofT. I le is here solely to · mourn and pay respects. 
11:15 p.m.: I just slept for about 30 minutes. I woke up for two reasons: 1) I'm cold and need a blanket (the temperature will eventually get as low as 38°) and 2) all hell broke loose when this guy just walked over every­one and started standing at tlw front. Ew~ryonc who had been waiting for many hours was extremely upset and was letting the guy know it. Well, Mkhelle had finally had enough. She went over to the guy and told him it was absolutely disgusting what he was doing. Everyone applauded her! 
1:30 a.m. Saturday: Michelle to the rescue once again. I slept again for a little while only to be woken up by extremely loud singing. There was this group behind me who was fairly drunk. They were all pretty young ­none older than 30. Talk about poor taste: instead of bellowing songs like "Amazing Grace," two of the drunk­er guys were sloppily screaming Irish drinking songs. People were definitely getting upset. finally, this brave little red headed woman calmly approached them and asked, "Why are you here?" This stopped the singing. but not the talking. One of the guys called her a bitch and the other called her the "skinny, red-haired les­bian." Interesting. Enter Michelle. She got up to go to the bathroom, and on the way back, ealmly stated her famous words, "You disgust me." It was classic, and the guys didn't say much more. 
2:30 a.m.: People are really starting to get edgy. Everyone thought they were going to move the barriers in front of us, so people started getting up and packing their belongings. They were very premature; a police officer had told us earlier that the barriers wouldn't be moved until 5 a.m. People arc really starting to get short with one another. Various brave souls have tried to calm the crowd down, attempting to remind people of why we're here, but it's not working. The people in the back are now feeling the need to start pushing forward. Nine hours before the funeral, everyone is quietly and secret­ly fighting for position. 
3a.m.: I fell asleep only to wake up and find that everyone from the back has moved..f?rward and is now in front of me. Ten feet from the barrier is packed with 
standing people-most of whom have been here for only a few hours. The police are completely useless; they are doing absolutely nothing. Ash advised us to just stay where we were. We have ample street space to lie down and possibly get some sleep. lie assures us that there's no way they can stand for 10 straight hours. So we stayed put. Well, unfortunately, that crowd did remain standing for the next 10 hours. Tempers remained high. We witnessed a 70-year-old woman get beat up by peo­ple who thought she was trying to cut when really she just wanted to get out. Paramedics had to lift her out, and an ambulance took her away. For all the hours I had spent waiting, I found myself 10 people back from the front. I couldn't see any of the dignitaries entering the Abbey, and I only caught a glimpse of the proces­sion. However, if I had it all to do over again, I would. When we noticed that the coffin would pass before our spot, everyone quietly waited. As soon as the collin was in front of us, people -men and women alike -began sobbing hysterically. The tears never stopped, heighten­ing during Elton John's tribute. Everyone was united in common loss. Mter witnessing such an event, I later reflected on my new friends, Ash and Michelle, and on actively experiencing quite possibly the biggest event of my lifetime. It was definitely 24 hours that I will never forget, and ones that I will be able to share for years to come. 

Canonize Mother Teresa, Remember Diana 
LONDON 
As a member of the fall 1997 London program, I have had the opportunity to witness history in the making. The week, from the death of Diana, Princess of 
Jessica Fries 
Wales, to her funeral, has been an unfor­gettable one. Yet this last week has also proved to be a painful reminder of soci­ety's basic tenet-it's not what you do but who you are that counts. 

The sudden and tragic death of Princess Diana came as a shock to us all. While I had never paid that much atten­tion to the English monarchy before, she had been a constant in the culture that surrounded and shaped my childhood. Now she was suddenly gone. The situa­tion seemed surreal. I visited Kensington Palace. I watched the flowers pour in, and I grew accustomed to seeing her face everywhere. Through her death, Diana became a greater part of my life than ever before. 
Friday brought another shock -the death of Mother Teresa. Although the media did not devote much attention to the story. I believed that the void occurred because of the approaching funeraL Yet two days after the solemn occasion, flowers and visitors continued to pour into London. crowding Kensington, King James, and Buckingham palaces. Diana still occupies the first 21 pages of The Times. Mother Teresa received two articles, the first of which appeared on page 14 and reported that Hindu officials were questioning her acceptance of money and portrayal of Calcutta. Is this the remembrance that befits such a wise, caring woman? 
Yes, Diana was an incredible woman, caring, compassionate, and full of life. She represented what many woman would like themselves to be, as well as a new type of English monarchy. Yet many of the traits lauded by her mourners were found in Mother Teresa as well. While she lacked the glamour and royal connec­tions of the princess, here was a woman who worked to remove the stigmas of lep­rosy and India's caste system. Here was a woman who lived a truly Christian life. 
Yet these memories seem to have gotten lost in a sea of royalty, beauty, and youth. 
I find it ironic that while Earl Spencer felt the need to implore mourners not to canonize his sister, there are those that argue vehemently about the possible can­onization of Mother Teresa. It is frustrat­ing that our society continues to value youth, glamour, and beauty to the point that such a holy and loving life could be so easily lost and overlooked. While the death of both these women is a great loss to our world, care should be taken to remember each as they were. 
Princess Diana should be praised and mourned. But it only seems just that Mother Teresa should be praised and mourned in at least an equivalent man­ner. These woman gave their lives to us; we are called to preserve their memories accordingly.

• NOTRE DAME lONDON PROGRAM MOURNS DEATH OF DIANA 
Shedding Tears for a Fallen Princess 
LONDON 
As students studying in the London prograin for the fall semester, we experienced the death of a true humanitarian and a lady loved whole­heartedly by her country. With the shocking and tragic passing of Diana, Princess of Wales, we watched respectfully as Britain fell into a deep state of despair and grief over their

tremendous loss. The flats in which we live stand a mere 10 minute walk from her London home of Kensington Palace. 
We observed first hand the over­whelming release of emotion as the nation realized the tragedy that had ocurred in Paris. The entire country seemed to just stop, shocked over the princess' untimely and violent death. 
Many of us went to Kensington 
• CAPITOl COMMENTS 
Palace that Sunday and saw the grow­ing flower barrier surrounding the palace. The constant stream of silent mourners venturing out to pay their respects with flowers touched those of us who went to take part and observe. Never in my life have I seen such a pure expression of pain and sorrow. In .the same instant they inspired me to feel some of their deep pain but also to understand how beautiful and fond their memories were of her. 
By the day after the funeral, flowers, personal memoirs and notes of sorrow had spread a full 40 yards out from the front gates of the palace. When volunteers finally began the process of collecting the tributes spread around the city early this morning, over 10,000 tons of flowers had been deliv­ered in remembrance of Diana within the London area. 
Throughout the week preceding the funeral all media attention focused on the upcoming procession and the ser­vice in Westminster Abbey. Government agencies worked furiously to prepare London for the expected influx of people. Early figures estimat­ed anywhere between two and six mil­lion people would turn out for the event. Meanwhile, the royal family rightfully retreated to a remote estate to personally mourn the loss. Prince William and Prince Harry, Diana and Prince Charles's sons, remained hid­den from the cameras, as did most of the family. The whole world seemed to sense the pain felt by the boys at the sudden loss of their mother. This, more than any other factor, brought people to tears and moved the nation to support them in their grief. 
As the weekend approached, most students at the London campus of Notre Dame made plans to participate in the funeral. Many gathered in groups to watch the proceedings on television while others woke in the early morning hours Saturday to find a spot along the processional rout. Seven of us left at 3:30 a.m. to venture across Hyde Park to find our position. Upon reaching the processional routs, we put out an American flag to take our place as representatives of our nation in the mourning. We then wait­ed, along with thousands of others, until the carriage bearing her casket came into view. Slowly and solemnly, guided by six horses and the famous Welsh Guard, the cortege moved along toward the Abbey. As she passed, not a sound was heard except for the clop­ping of the horse's hooves carrying 
her onward. 
After the procession, we headed back to view the funeral by television at our flats. Many of us showed the exhaustion of a short night's sleep but in the final stages of the procession and throughout the service nobody batted an eye. Midway through the funeral I walked upstairs to drop off my backpack from our night in the park. As I walked through our door, I happened to hear Elton John's tribute Candle in the Wind playing from the loudspeakers just down the street in Hyde Park. 
I peered out of the window and noticed that no cars traveled the street in front ·of our building and the usually packed Bayswater Road stood empty. I looked upon the street below and saw several taxi drivers sitting in their cars with the engines off. One driver parked along the nearby tree lined median, obviously listening to his radio, sat weeping alone in his 
car. 
I then fully realized just how much this nation loved Diana and for a moment I joined him, and much of London, in shedding a tear for their fallen princess. 

Church, ND Must Embrace Political Correctness 
Catholics are well aware of the internal eonllicts regarding the role of women in the Church. Notre Dame "community" members have had as much exposure regarding discrimination and inclusion issues on campus the last few years. It has become absurd that the leadership of both the Catholic Church and the Notre Dame administration refuse to abandon what 
some perceive as "good ole boy" rhetoric in a modern time when respect for individ­uals should be more of a priority. 
One of the easiest steps the Church 
Gary Caruso 
could take to show that everyone is equal in the eyes of' its all-male leadership, is to b(~comc politically correct in one prayer. How hard is it to delete one word and change "... for us men, and for our salva­tion ..." to simply," for us?" The revision or an antiquated phrase could speak vol­umes to women throughout the Church. It is the type of subtle reassurance that women look for as the first step from the Church leadership. 
Notre Dame, on the other hand, has two tasks ahead of it regarding its "exclusive" rhetoric. First, and a quite easy effort, is to change the fight song by one word to show the University's modern-age commitment to women. We should sing, "While our loyal ONES go marching onward to victo­
ry., Are we so steeped in tradition that we 
cannot adapt the fight song by one word to be sung in the."modified" House that Hockne built? The one-word change roars 
louder than 21,000 new spectators can cheer on Saturday. 
The second chore is one the current Notre Dame administration is unwilling to embrace because they are attempting to hide behind the skirt of the Church. Their initial denial or the existence of gays and lesbians on eampus 10 years ago has evolved into the exclusion of them from campus facilities to now a "Spirit of Inclusion." There is no denying that this "spirit" is not a holy spirit. That fact is cer­tain. 
No. this spirit is simply one remedy cur­rently being attempted to hide behind the community's perceived Church values and mission rather than provide resources and facilities to students who administrators believe may give the University a bad pub­lic image. I would expect Jerry Falwell's Moral Majority to use such narrow-mind­ed and discriminatory logic. It falls in line with the skewed premise that sex educa­tion in high school actually promotes sexu­al activity. 
Notre Dame tries to convey the image of being the most Catholic university in the United States. After all, Georgetown is Jesuit, which everyone knows really is not truly Catholic. However, Georgetown has two things Notre Dame does not ... a good remedy to this conflict between church values and gay students, and better lawyers who wrote their policy. 
Gay and lesbian students sued Georgetown for recognition along with the right to use facilities and resources. They won half of their suit, "access to the bene­fits" which were received by other organi­zations, such as the use of university facili­ties, the ability to apply for funding, office space, etc. This access is open to any group that has an open membership. a constitution and docs not duplicate anoth­er group's purpose. 
Georgetown groups are not eligible if their purpose or activities are unlawful or in violation of university policy, endanger safety, threaten or disrupt or obstruct uni­versity functions, or foster hatred or intol­erance of others. Groups are not eligible if their activities are political action in nature or "are inconsistent with accept­able conduct at an American university committed to the Roman Catholic moral tradition." 
The benefits offered to groups are advice and counsel from staff, a mailbox and use of the university's mail system, use of computers and typewriters in the student activities offices and inclusion in the student activities fair. They may apply for labels, office space, use of university vehicles, use of indoor and outdoor facili­ties, fundraising projects, liquor licenses, support for events scheduled ofT campus and for inclusion in other university boards. 
Georgetown has a rather unique approach to the standards it requires its student organizations to uphold with respect to others. It's web page clearly specifies the university's standards. It begins, "f{espect for every person is at the core of Georgetown's Catholic, Jesuit iden­tity. In a university it is particularly neces­sary that this respect encompass diversity and difference of opinion. A student orga­nization may be held accountable for actions that violate the dignity of another member of the university community." 
In listing action specifically prohibited, Georgetown focuses on four areas: dis­crimination, hazing, interfering with another group's freedom of expression, and disruption. Regarding discrimination, The chauvinistic "moral majority types" kept saying that the constitution already guaranteed equality. Why add speciallan­guage? 
I would turn that argument around. Why not include more specific language so that we have no misunderstandings? What harm can the language do? That language 
it simply defines discrimination as "any act certainly would only help interpret that distinguishes or excludes an individ-instances and would not hinder anyone ual on any criterion other than indi-----~ else. Yet the fact remains that, 
vidual merit." (Notre Dame could use this as an exam-pie.} 
Disruption is defined as "activity that endan­gers or imminently threatens to endan­ger the safety of any member of the community or of any of the community's facilities." Hazing is "any ritual of mem­bership that demeans, humiliates, injures, or weakens a student or oth­erwise inter­feres with the pursuit of an education by a student." 
Georgetown elevates its dis­crimination policy 
a step higher as well. The university prohibits any student group "that fosters hatred or intolerance of others because of their race, nationality, gender, or sexual preference, or are inconsistent with acceptable conduct at an American uni­versity committed to the Roman Catholic moral tradition." 
How can an American university prohib­it discrimination based on sexual prefer­ence as well as promnte conduct commit­ted to a Homan Catholic moral tradition? Georgetown can and Notre Dame cannot. Is this a "Jesuit thing" or a matter of step­ping into a modern age and prohibiting discrimination on every level? 
When one group is not protected, all might as well not be protected. This issue reminds me of the Equal Rights Amendment proposed in the late 1970s. 
today, after the ERA was defeated for lack of support, women are still lower paid and discriminated against. The same is true for those with sexual preference alternative lifestyles. Notre Dame's 
attempt to sit on the fence and maintain some 
"super Catholic" image is sim­
ply stubborn and tiring. Until ND acts like other uni­versities with 
"Roman 
Catholic moral traditions," they will at the 
minimum imply an acceptance of discrimination. 
, Now that the ND football team has a defeat under its belt, 
1 
how many sports-crazed potential stu­dents will turn from one 
Catholic university still struggling to identify its dis­
crimination policy, for another uni­versity whose role in accepting everyone is clear and concise? I am glad that I do not face such a choice, knowing the history of both Georgetown and Notre Dame.

Fishers return to Wisconsin after 4 7-year hiatus 
By ROBERT IMRIE Associated Press 
WAUSAU, Wise. 
It picks off inattentive cats, sometimes snatching them right ofT back porches. It sneaks qui­etly into trees, stalking birds as big as hawks, killing them in their nests with lightning-swift bites, eating everything but the feathers. 
The slender, weasel-like fish­er-wiped out in Wisconsin by the 1930s by hunters trading its luxurious pelt -has been successfully reintroduced into the state's wilds. 
Perhaps too successfully. 
Brought back to the state as natural predators against men­acing porcupines, the fishers are too tough and strong to have any predators of their own. Its prime enemy is still the trapper. 

"I have no real problem with fishers being in the state. It is the number of fishers," ecolo­gist and hawk researcher Tom Erdmann said. "A few are cute. At what point do they no longer become cute?" 
An estimated 11.000 fishers roam the northern half of the state, some 1,800 more than the "management goal," said John Olson of the state Department of Natural Resources. The animals were slowly reintroduced beginning in 1956. 
"When the fisher starts tak­ing the prized house cat, the cat on the back porch. that is what we are concerned about. We have to address that," he said. 
The state might open a sepa­rate hunting season for fishers if the problems continue and hopes more of the animals are trapped this year. In 1996. trappers killed 1,362 fishers during the two-month season in November and December. 
Wisconsin has about 3,000 trappers who pay $21 for li­censes. Two-thirds of the fish­ers are caught in body-gripping traps that kill the animals with a sharp, quick blow or evPntu ally suffocate them. Leg-hold traps also are allowed. 
Fishers are limited to the forested regions of the northern United States and Canada. Besides Wisconsin, significant populations are found in Minnesota, Michigan's Upper Peninsula, upstate New York and the New England region. Smaller populations are found in Idaho, Montana. Oregon, Washington and California. 
With a pointed face, rounded ears and short legs. an adult male fisher weighs 9 to 10 pounds and is a slender 40 inches long. Its tail accounts for about a third of the length. 
The valuable furbearer -top pelts can fetch as much as $450 -is immeasurably stronger and quicker than a cat and can climb like a squirrel. Among its 38 teeth are six incisors. It kills most prey with a neck bite and may hold the animal by wrap­ping itself around it. 
In 1995 and 1996, there were 53 complaints about fishers to the Agriculture Department's Wildlife Services office in Rhinelander, including 23 regarding attacks on pets. 

Carol Johnson of Green Bay saw what a fisher can do. One killed a 2-month-old cat, "turned it inside out," in a shed at her home, she said. 
"All that was left was the paws and the skin. It was scary," she said. 
Erdmann knows fishers raid nests of woodland raptors and suspects they may also attack ground-nesting songbirds and grouse. That didn't happen 10 years ago, the ecologist said. 
"Every year, I will find dead birds and I will find nests that fail -30 to 45 percent annual­ly," he said. "Most of those fail­ures can most likely be attrib­uted to fishers."

Marlins waltzing into NL playoffs 
By STEVEN WINE Associated Press Writer 
MIAMI The pennant race might become a waltz for the Florida Marlins. 
The Marlins reduced their magie number for clinching a playoff berth to five Thursday, beating the Philadelphia Phillies 8-2: 
"\Ne've got our own destiny in our hands," said Kevin Brown, who won his sixth consecutive decision. "It's like coming around the home stretch in horse racing. You can see the finish line." 
Florida is 5 1/2 games ahead of NL West co-leaders San Francisco and Los Angeles in the wild-card race, and six games behind Atlanta in the NL East. 
The Marlins could clinch the first playoff berth in franchise history as early as Sunday. They play the Mets at home this weekend. 
"Everybody is excited, including me," manager Jim Leyland said. "But we're got to stay on an even keel. We've got to win some games ye.t " 
Brown (15-8) allowed nine hits and two runs, one earned, in R 1-3 innings. He is unbeaten since July 27 with an ERA of 1.62, including a three-hitter against San Francisco last Friday. 
"My history has been pretty good in September," Brown said. "Hopefully I'll have a chance to have a history in October." 
Against Philadelphia, Brown sin­gled, scored a run, made two nice defensive plays and overcame a slow start on the mound. The right­hander allowed just two hits from the third inning through the eighth. 
"He has nasty stuff," Phillies manager Terry Francona said. "He knows where it's going, and that makes it even nastier. When he's on his game, his ball is darting all over the place." 
Devon White and Jim Eiscnreich each had a two-run single in Florida's five-run second inning. White also doubled home a run in the eighth for the Marlins, who had 15 hits. 
Mike Grace (3-2) had by far his worst outing in five starts this sea­son, allowing seven hits and six runs in two innings as the Phillies lost for the eighth time in 11 games. 
"I just didn't have it," Grace said. "They have some hitters who can make you pay for your mistakes." 
Grace's ERA rose from 2.17 to 
3.77. lie pitched eight scoreless innings in his only other appear­ance against Florida last year. 
This time, half of the Marlins' reg­ulars were missing from the start­ing lineup. 
Third baseman Bobby Bonilla, who received a cortisone shot in his wrist Wednesday, sat out the game but is expected to rejoin the lineup Friday. Right fielder Gary Sheffield, sidelined by back stiffness, might also return Friday. 
"We got some guys some rest and got a win," said Cliff Floyd, who drove in two runs. "You've got to be thankful for that."

Yankees drop ball against Tigers, aim for wild card 
By TOM WITHERS 
Associared Press Writer 
NEW YORK 
The Tigers spoiled whatever little celebration the Yankees had planned. 
Damion Easley's two-run sin­gle in the 11th inning prevented New York from clinching a third straight postseason berth Thursday night as Detroit beat the Yankees 9-7. 
New York could have locked up a playoff spot with a win because Anaheim lost to Oakland 7-3. As it is, the Yankees are assured of at least a tie for a postseason slot. 
Joe Borowski (0-1). making his first appearance since being claimed off waivers this week from Atlanta, walked the bases loaded in the 11th and Easley bounced his single through the left side with two outs_ 
Todd Jones (4-3) pitched 1 2­3 innings of relief for the win. Dan Miceli got three outs for his third save. 
Bernie Williams homered for New York, which trails first­place Baltimore by five games in the AL East. 
The Yankees, who will likely win the wild card, had their winning streak stopped at five games. 
The Yankees nearly rallied to win it in the bottom of the ninth but Scott Pose was thrown out at the plate. 

Phil Nevin homered for the Tigers, who beat New York for just the second time in nine games this season. 
Hideki Irabu pitched two innings of one-hit relief with four strikeouts and was poised to pick up the win when the Tigers tied it 7-7 in the top of the ninth with a run off closer Mariano Rivera. 
Hivera has blown nine saves this year. 
New York scored an un­earned run in the eighth to take a 7-6 lead when the Tigers committed two errors.

Indians close in on playoff berth, White Sox use rout to keep pace 

ByRON LESKO 
Associared Press 
MINNEAPOLIS 

Orel Hershiser rebounded from his worst outing of the year, giving up three hits in 7 1-3 innings Thursday night as the Cleveland Indians moved a season-best 14 games over .500 with a 4-1 win over the Minnesota Twins. 
The win cut Cleveland's magic number for clinching the AL Central to six. 
Hershiser, who lasted only three innings in a loss at Chicago on Saturday, retired 21 of 23 batters after allowing Chuck Knoblaueh's leadoff sin­gle in the first. 
The Indians got an unearned run ln the sixth off Bob Tewksbury (6-13) and added two in the seventh on Pat Borders' HBI single and Bip Hoberts' sacrifice fly. Marquis Grissom's third hit, an HBI sin­gle in the ninth, accounted for Cleveland's final run. 
It was Cleveland's fifth straight win over Minnesota, which has lost five straight games and is just three losses away from the second-most losses in team history. The Twins have lost 12 of 16 overall and now have the lowest win­ning percentage in the majors (.404). 
Tewksbury allowed eight hits in seven innings, striking out five with no walks. 
White Sox 9, Royals 2 
Doug Drabek took a no-hitter into the sixth inning and Robin Ventura hit his 150th career homer as the Chicago White Sox routed the Kansas City Hoyals 9-2 on Thursday night. 

Drabek (11-11) didn't allow a hit until Roderick Myers looped a single to right leading off the sixth. 
Drabek lost his shutout bid in the seventh on Jay Bell's 21st homer. 
Chicago added a run in the third on Mario Valdez's RBI single, and Ventura's two-run homer made it 5-0 in the fifth. The 387 -foot drive to left center was his sixth of the season. 
Chicago scored four runs in the eighth. Martinez had an RBI triple, Ventura and Mike Cameron drew bases-loaded walks, and Jorge Fabregas added a sacrifice fly. Bell com­pleted the scoring in the eighth with an RBI single. 
Pittsley allowed 10 hits and five runs in six innings.

Ohio State aims to avoid mistakes against Arizona 
By RUSTY MILLER 
Associated Press 
COLUMBUS. Ohio 
Arizona and ninth-ranked Ohio State both have the un­easy feeling that their game Saturday is a prelude to big­ger battles ahead. 
The Buckeyes (2-0) arc fa­vored by 17 1/2 points over Arizona (1-1) in a battle of teams that have mixed flashes of greatness with moments of ineptitude. 
Along the way against UAB, the Wildcats lost backup quar­terback Brady Batten to a bro­ken collarbone. 
That will put additional pressure on sophomore starter Keith Smith, who is hitting 46 percent of his passes after completing 61 percent a year ago. 
He faces untold risks against a hard-hitting Ohio State defense that is allowing 4.1 yards per pass and 3. 3 per rush. 
Arizona's "Desert Swarm" defense has everything going for it that Ohio State's does, plus a catchy nickname. The

Wildcats are surrendering 57 yards on the ground and 139 through the air per game. 
If they turn things around against Ohio State, it will be the defense which does it. 
"Early indications on us are not positive. but I refuse to go by that," Tomey said. "I believe in this team and I think that the kids still believe in us. After two games, we haven't played up to our capa­bilities, unless I really under­estimated them." 
Mistakes have haunted Ohio State. The Buckeyes have seven fumbles in their two vic­tories, with one touchdown and a defensive interception called back by penalties. 
"That's most definitely a concern," said Dee Miller, Ohio State's leading receiver with nine catches. "Hopefully this week we can relax a little more. Right now, we have to realize we can't have these type of mistakes going in against Arizona because they're a much better football team than we've faced the first two weeks." 
Sophomores Michael Wiley and David Boston have been the offensive stars, with Wiley averaging 9.6 yards per rush and scoring three touchdowns and Boston catching eight passes, two of them for scores.

Total realignment unlikely, but 5 may switch leagues 
By RONALD BLUM 
Associa[ed Press 
ATlANTA 

Admitting that radical re­alignment was "very, very, very unlikely," acting commissioner Bud Selig postponed a vote Thursday but predicted more than five teams would switch leagues next season. 
After owners met f<lr 2 112 hours, Selig said they had extended their deadline for a decision from Sept. 30 to Oct. 15. Realignment committee chair­man John Harrington said about a half dozen plans were under consideration. 
Proponents of realignment 
. 
appear set on switching Anaheim, Oakland and Seattle to the National League and moving Florida and Montreal to the American. Some also would like to move Houston and possibly Arizona to the AL in exchange for Kansas City and possibly Milwaukee. 
"We have a difficult job in front of us," Atlanta Braves president Stan Kasten said, "because we have 30 teams, which means we have 30 differ­ent histories, 30 different sets of circumstances, 30 different needs. And it's very difficult, probably impossible, to perfectly harmonize all 30 of the different sets of needs. No plan is per-feet." 
San Francisco Giants owner Peter Magowan, the chief obsta­cle to the five-team plan, has threatened to sue if owners attempt to move Oakland into the NL, not wanting his rival to share what he feels is the Giants' exclusive right to play NL games in the Bay area. 
Selig said the players' as­sociation had been repeatedly informed of the debate. Union head Donald Fehr, speaking in New York, said it was too soon to draw a conclusion. 
"There is a fundamental ques­tion of eliminating the American League presence on the West Coast," Fehr said. 
Some of the teams who would have switched leagues as part of a total geographic realignment don't want to move if only a few teams are changing leagues. 
Selig said owners would meet again "very soon" but wouldn't put a timetable on it. He said a special meeting during the post­season was possible, but in recent years owners have not met during October, preferring to keep fans' focus on the field. A telephone meeting remains a possibility, as does another extension of the deadline. 
League offices usually give teams the schedule for the fol­lowing season in July. Last year, the schedule was delayed until November because of the debate on a new labor contract, 


In the other major business at the meetings, owners approved guidelines for allowing teams to sell public shares. 
However, teams will not be allowed to put the majority of their stock in the marketplace, and voting rights of public shares will be restricted. 
As for realignment, the debate began in January after the 1998 expansion teams were assigned to leagues, Arizona to the NL and Tampa Bay to the AL. None of the AL Central teams wanted to move to the AL West, and the issue was left unresolved. 
Dozens of plans have been pre­sented since, most involving a 16-team NL of four divisions and a 14-team AL of three divisions. 
Two 15-team leagues, the

winner, Gipp led Notre Dame in rushing and passing from 1918 to 1920. The Irish compiled a 27-2-3 record during the Gipp's playing days, outscoring their opponents 506 to 97. 
Two weeks before his death on Dec. 14, 1920, Gipp was selected as Notre Dame's first All­American, engraving his name forever in the Irish record books. 
Rockne waited eight years to broadcast Gipp's dying wish to the Notre Dame football team, the famous "win just one for the Gipper" speech that led the team to a 12-6 victory against an unbeat­en Army squad on Nov. 10, 1928.

Olympic netters-turned-coaches reunite for inaugural tournament 
Special to The Observer 
The University of Notre Dame women's volleyball team will be hosting a sperial event today and tomorrow. 
The first annual Tournament of Champions will bn held at the Joyce Center arena and will reunite four current head coaches -Debbie Landreth Brown of Notre Dame. Sue Woodstra of California, Laurie Flachmeier Corbelli of Texas A&M, and Laurel Brassey Iversen of New Mexico -who were teammates on the 1980 
U.S. Olympic volleyball team that did not participate due to the U.S. boycott. 
The tournament is to be held every other year. rotating among the four schools. 
The 1980 U.S. Olympic team was expected to challenge Russia and Japan for the gold medal, with China and Cuba also expected to be in the medal mix. China and Japan also did not compete in 1980 due to their respective boy­cotts. The USSR claimed the gold. East Germany took the silver, and Bulgaria won the bronze. 
Six members of the 1980 Olympic team have received "all-time great" designation from USA Volleyball, the high­est honor accorded by the organization, among them Brown. Wooustra, and Brassey Iversen.

Champions will feature two other noteworthy former U.S. Olympians: Elaina Oden and Jeff Stork. 
Oden is in her first season as an assistant coach with the Notre Dame women's volley­ball team, after playing on the 1992 and 1996 U.S. Olympic teams. The 1992 team won the bronze medal in Barcelona. 
Stork served as setter for the 
U.S. men's volleyball team in the 1988. 1992, and 1996 Olympics, leading the U.S. to a gold-.meal finish in Seoul in 1988 and a bronze in 1992. 
The 1980 Olympic team started Debbie Green as set­ter, Patty Dowdell and Terry Place as middle blockers, Flo Hyman and Woodstra as left­side hitters, and Brown as right-side hitter. 
The reserves for the team included Brassey Iversen for the setter, Flachmeier Cor belli in the middle and on the left side, Rita Crockett on the left side, and Diane McCormick French in the middle. 
French will also attend the tournament. Her husband Frank is a Notre Dame gradu­ate who currently works for Hewlett Packard.

were very solid technical play­ers -that's how we trained as a team and I think you'll see that a lot in how we coach our teams," Brown said. 
"The four of us never really were in competition for a posi­tion, although Sue moved to the right side for the 1984 Olympics. Laurel was a setter and great defensive player. Laurie was a great blocker, and Sue was a Vl~ry good pass­er and a great hitter off the block," she said of her team­mates. 
"For some people, the people that they are closest to are their friends from high school or college," Brown continued. "For me, it's my teammates from the national team. It's unfortunate that we are spread across the country but it's a good thing we are in the same profession and can see one another because of that. We obviously spent a lot of time together, and that devel­oped some strong bonds and special relationships. 
"I've wanted to do a tourna­ment like this for a while and we all have talked about it," Brown said. "Finally, I just decided to pick a date and make it happen."

The players are looking to the leadership of the co-cap­tains Johnson and senior Ryan Turner to get them going in the right direction in the Big East. 

''I've been trying to lead the team by Pxample." Johnson said. "I go out and give 100 percent on every play hoping that it will set a standard which the guys will follow." 
It will be the second road game in a row for the Irish, who are 1-0-2 away from Alumni Field this year. 
Notre Dame hopes that this will be a stepping stone to future success in the Big East 
conference.

That is pre­cisely why I offer Q-and-A in my columns and why I have a Dear Euge­nia section on my Web site. I've been hying to educate people for years by showing them how this subject really works.

The tragic death and storied life of George Gipp, one of the greatest all-around college football players in history, remain engraved in the minds of Notre Dame fans and alum­ni. 
Preserving that memory for a new generation of aspiring ath­letes, the Laurium Commercial club constructed a 15-foot Lake Superior stone fountain within the confines of a triangular park in Gipp's hometown of Laurium, Mich., in 1935, 15 years after his death. Rocks from local mines and the shores of Lake Superior formed the monument adorned by a bronze plaque inscribed "George Gipp-All-American," followed by 1895-1920, the dates of Gipp's birth and death. In the 62 years since its con­struction, the George Gipp Memorial has been battered by the weather, and is now in des­

perate need of repair. 
The Notre Dame Clubs of Michigan have joined with the Village of Laurium to sponsor the restoration of the memori­al. Plans include: replacing the Lake Superior stone, repairing the internal fountain and park sprinkler system, constructing story boards detailing the achievements of Gipp and other 
famous Notre Dame athletes linked to the Laurium and Calumet, installing brick walk­ways, lighting fixtures and flower beds to improve the park's appearance. Finally, funds are necessary for a re­dedication ceremony and year­ly maintenance. 
"We wanted to preserve George Gipp's memory for his accomplishments as a Notre Dame man and Notre Dame athlete," said MBA student Dan Skendzel, a member of the Notre Dame Club of Northern Michigan, a driving force behind the project. 
Although best known for his heroic performances on the gridiron, including two touch­down passes in a 33-7 win over Northwestern while battling strep throat and pneumonia. George Gipp was a true base­ball talent. 
After dropping out of Calumut High School in 1913, Gipp played semipro baseball before joining three friends traveling to South Bend in 1916. Since a high school diplo­ma was unnecessary to enter college, Gipp accepted a base­ball scholarship to Notre Dame, but bngan and ended his colle­giate career on the diamond after one game. · 
Head Notre Dame football coach Knute Rockne recruited Gipp after seeing him punt the football in street clothes with some friends.

defense in the nation as far as forced turnovers are concerned. Both Powlus and Denson have had key turnovers in both games, and can't afford to cough up the ball to the Spartans. They won't get it back without seven points attached to it. 
The Irish are still having prob­lems coming up with a big play threat, therefore, limiting their offensive potential and tending to fall into predictability. There will be a lot of outside pressure on offensive coordinator Jim Colletto after last week's loss to his for­mer team Purdue, so tomorrow's 
offensive performance will be as much an indication of his perfor­mance as the unit as a whole. 
Still, Davie remains confident with Colletta's and does not expect to make any drastic changes in the offensive scheme. 
"If you look at us on offense from an X and 0 standpoint, we're doing things at a high level," Davie said. "There were a lot of good things against Georgia Tech. There were a lot of good things against Purdue. Our prob­lem has come in breakdowns of our own creation." 
If the Irish are able to correct problems within their own hud­dle, they should be able to at least match the numbers the

Sure-footed Hunter Smith adds needed 
consistency to Irish 
ByJOECAVATO 
Assistant Sports Editor 
It is one of the most under­rated plays in football, and if it is done well, it goes relatively unnoticed. But if it is done poorly, it sticks out like a sore thumb and could potentially cost the team the game. 
Hunter Smith, like most of his kicks, has gone unnoticed, which is usually an excellent sign for a punter. 
Irish fans rarely have to worry about the punt because on fourth and 10 from their own 20, they know that Smith is capable of getting the team out of trouble and giving the 
defense some breathing room. 
The junior is quietly having another outstanding season in what has become an impres­sive career. After an inconsis­tent freshman campaign in which he averaged 36 yards per kick, Smith settled in and established himself as one of the best in college football, averaging better than 43 yards per boot in 1996. That was good for 25th in the country and was the fifth best season ever by a punter wearing the Blue and Gold. 

"My freshman year was shaky," Smith commented. "I was thrown into it and just getting experience and getting comfortable has been the dif­ference." 
"It has a lot to do with matu­rity, and he's right on track to have another great year," spe­cial teams coach Kirk Doll said. "He just needs to keep working like he has each year. With his work ethic and atti­tude, I think he can do that, and I think he has a great future ahead of him." 
Smith has been able to help the Irish play the all important game of field position which can become critical to the out­
come of any contest. 
"Whenever you can get the ball inside the 20, the odds of a team scoring should be some­thing like one in 20," Doll said. "That's a great opportunity he's provided for us. It really helps the defense. and if you can get a couple of three and outs, then it totally turns around the field position game." 
"Our coaches have always said that the punt is the most important play in football," Smith said. "I think that's probably true because field position is so important these days." 


The most important aspect of a kicker is consistency. Smith has always performed at prac­tice and now he is performing like that on gameday. 
"This year, I feel like I'm going to be great," Smith said. "I feel like I'm going to do it in games just like in practice, and I've always been pretty good at practice." 
"He's been unbelievable," fellow kicker Jim Sanson praised. "To be honest, I think he's the best punter in the country. He's real consistent; I haven't seen anybody that con­sistent. He can pooch it and can boom it deep, and he real­ly never does anything wrong out there." 
Something else that goes unnoticed about Smith, is that he is probably one of the best pure athletes on the Irish squad. Sanson explained how his athletic prowess can be an asset for a kicker. 
"If there's a bad snap, you know he's going to have a chance of getting it off or run­ning with it or even throwing it. It's like having a quarter­back, running back, and receiver out there kicking it." 
Smith was a jack of all trades back home in Sherman. Tex. where he played wide receiver, quarterback, tight end, kicker. and punter. He was actually recruited as a receiver and quarterback out of high school, {lnd his punting capabilities were not what recruiters. 
He was an aerial and rush­ing threat his senior campaign, quarterbacking his Sherman high school squad to Class 4A State quarterfinals his senior year. Smith completed 50 per­cent of his passes for 975 yards and 13 touchdowns while rushing for 600 yards and eight touchdowns. 
The previous year, Smith earned all-state honors, set­ting a career receiving mark with 1,215 yards, including 229 yards in one game against state champions Lewisville. Smith was also an all-star with the round ball and was a track star, high jumping to heights up to 6-feet, 10 inches to earn third place in the Lone Star State. 
Corning in as a freshman, Smith was excited to get the chance to play, but he still misses not being in on every play. 
"I feel like I could play some­thing else here and coming in my first year and playing was neat. Since then. there's a part of me that wants to go out there and run around, catch the ball, throw the ball, and hit people. I guess that's the little kid in me." 
"He really understands the game and is not just a pure specialist," Doll said. "We've used him on our scout team as a quarterback, but he is just too valuable to us for him to play other positions." 
Smith realizes this and has come to accept his role on the squad. 
smart, and punting has become such a science, I really need to concentrate on that. I can help the team best as a punter." 
Another aspect of 'Hunter the Punter' that is unique to him is his personality and the importance of religion in his life. 
"He's a real religious guy, and he's also a real funny guy," Sanson said. "He keeps you on your toes, and we joke around all the time. He knows where his faith and values are, and he keeps it in order. He's a great guy to have on your side. Every time we go out there for a kick, he tells me every single time that 'It's in God's hands.' And that is something that helps out. He's always on your side and never throws the blame on anyone, and he's always positive towards everything." 
In fact, Smith's decision to attend Notre Dame and punt as opposed to perhaps see more playing time at another program was driven by his faith. 
"When I came here for my visit, I wasn't real impressed with where it was and it was so different from where I'm from. I was so uncomfort­able," Smith said. "It may sound weird to some people, but I felt called to come here. It was something I needed to do rather than what I wanted to do, and I've had no regrets." 
That decision is also some­thing his teammates, coaches, and classmates have never and

• IRISH INSIGHT 

Michigan State game kicks off renewed rivalries 

though last week provided a bit­er twist to an all-too-familiar ivalry for the Notre Dame foot­ball team -it was the first time the Irish have lost to Purdue since 1985 ­the next three weeks promise to bring the rebirth of some sorely missed rival­ries in the history of Irish football. 
When Michigan State comes to South Bend tomorrow, it will be more than just an extremely important game for both teams. It will be the first meeting of the Irish and the Spartans since 1994, when the Irish pulled off a nailbiting 21-20 victory. It is a rivalry that ESPN describes as "underrated" and Betsy Baker that Irish head coach -Associate Sports Editor 

Bob Davie said is a "natural rivalry from a geography standpoint, from a tradition standpoint, and from a personal standpoint," as the two coaching staffs are closely related. 
Although the Irish own the series 41­18, including an eight-game winning streak, the Spartans are the third most successful team in all-time victories against the Irish, trailing only Southern Cal and Purdue. It is the first time since 1985 that the Irish will enter a contest against the Spartans unranked, and for only the sixth time in the 60-game his­tory, Michigan State will be the only ranked team. 
On a more individual level, Irish quar­terback Ron Powlus went 10-for-30 against the Spartans in '94, including four interceptions, and will no doubt be looking to improve upon his career record against the Spartans. 

I '. With 47,681 alumni requests for tick­ets, tomorrow's game is the second­highest requested game in Notre Dame history, second only to Oct. 18's Southern Cal game. Regardless of the statistics, however, 

tomorrow's renewal of the Michigan State rivalry looks to serve a far more important purpose than adding to histo­ry. The Irish are in desperate need of a rebound from last Saturday's loss and the added emotional intensity of a res­urrected rivalry might help give the Irish the edge in this one. 
There are two factors working against the Irish in this equation, however. First of all, the problems with the Irish right now, as Davie has admitted numerous times, go far beyond a ques­tion of emotions. Davie was quick to emphasize in his press conference this week that he does not want to take the focus off of the game of football. He doesn't want to bring in any outside influences to distract the team from the original game plan. However, there has appeared an emotional edge in the last two games the Irish have played, and not in favor of the Blue and Gold. 

Second, the renewal of the rivalry could also work to the advantage of the Spartans. They have the opportunity to begin their season 3-0 for the first time since 1979, and this, combined with a need for vengeance for the '94 loss, could give them incentive to do so. 
Either way, Saturday's game, in addi­tion to next week's game at Michigan and the Oct. 4 game at Stanford will bring the return of familiar foes and add a much-needed vitality to a waver­ing Irish spirit.

SEC battles headline super Saturday 


Huskers look to defend Big 12 pride 
By BRIAN REINTHALER Assistant Sports Editor 
No.4 Tennessee at No. 3 Florida 
Forget what anybody else 
tells you. This game is the rea­
son why Peyton Manning is the 
quarterback for the Tennessee 
Volunteers and not the New 
York Jets this season. This 
contest should not make or 
break Manning's Heisman 
hopes, as it did a year ago, but 
the award will be on its way to 
Peyton's trophy case if he can 
turn in an MVP performance. 
As is typical of college football 
teams in Florida, Spurrier's 
troops have already guaranteed 
a win, but they did not stop 
there. Just guaranteeing a win 
without making a personal 
attack would be out of charac­
ter for the Gators. They decid­
ed to challenge Tennessee's 
golden boy by saying that he 
was overrated. As if Peyton 
needed any more incentive. 
In the end, however, there is 
nothing wrung with talk, as 
long as you back it up. Florida 
has averaged over 42 points 
per game in their last four 
meetings with the Vols. Under 
Spurrier, the Gators have lost 
only one SEC game in "the 
Swamp" and have won 21 con­
secutive conference games 
overall. 

1997 opponents have run up a grand total of -5 yards.
