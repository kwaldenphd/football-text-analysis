NewNDPMS 
Notre Dame's new Professor of Mili­tary Science and head of the Army ROTC 
detachment  is Col.  John  J. Lavin. Col.  
Lavin  replaces Col.  John Stephens who  
has just completed  a  four  year tour of  

duty at Notre Dame and retired from the 
Army after thirty years of service. 
Col. Lavin comes to Notre Dame from his last assignment as Deputy Chief of the logistics division at NATO headquarters in Izmir, Turkey. He is a career officer (a product of ROTC) in his 29th year of service. A graduate of Western Maryland College, he was commissioned as a 2nd Lieutenant in 1938. During World War Two, Col. Lavin was attached to a sepa­rate armor battalion of the fifth corps of the First Army. He saw action at Utah Beach, the Seigfried Line, Heurtegen For­est. He served in Luxembourg, Belgium, Germany, and was with the first American troops to enter Paris. After the War he remained in Germany and from there went to Greece as an advisor to Greek forces fighting communist guerilas. 
According to the Colonel, there will be no change in Army ROTC policy here at Notre Dame. The office will be open to anyone who wished to find out about the Army ROTC program. 
Col. Lavin predicts that "the draft situ­ation will remain the same for several years at least. In that case it seems likely that all college graduates will have to serve in the Army or some comparable program. They might as well serve where they're needed as officers. You just cannot take a boy out of high school, let him serve as a private for a year, send him to officer can­didate school, and expect him to make the quality decisions that a college graduate is capable of making." 
When asked his opinion on the Vietnam war, the new Professor of Military Science said, "I think that if one studies the over­all plans and rationale of the Communists, he will conclude that we will have to face 
situations like this for some time to come, if not in Vietnam then somewhere else. The Communists seem to understand only one thing, it is the only thing that will make them stop-force."

Officials riticize Changes In Student Gov't. Finances 
By GUY DESAPIO 
Last year's Student Union President Michael Browning and this year's President Rick Rembusch voiced concern yesterday over the financial policies of Student Government and over the procedtres Student Body President Richard Rossie used to remove the signature of Vice­President for Student Affairs, Rev. Charles McCarragher's name from Student Govern­ment checks. 
"I disagree with the action," Rem busch said of the removal of McCarragher's name from the checks., "because my under­standing of the Student Government con­stitution. According to my understanding of the constitution the Student Body Pre­sident does not have the power to remove Father McCarragher's name. . .with the information I have now, I am adamant that Father McCarragher's signature be returned to the checks. 
Mike Browning said that the move was probably made in the hope that "it would give the students more power to operate effectively. It doesn't give Student Government anything more meaningful. In fact, it might hurt them." 
Both Rembusch and Browning's state­
ments were made as a result of Rossie's 
announcement to the Student Senate two 
weeks ago that he had Father McCarra­
gher's name removed from Student Gov­
ernment checks as a first step in imple­
menting a General Assembly bill which 
stated that Student Government be made 
financially autonomous. Rossie said at 
that time that the move was also being 
made as a matter of convenience. It 
would not be necessary now to look for 
Father McCarragher to get every check approved and signed. Presently only Ros­sie and Student Government Treasurer Dick Roderick sign Student Government checks. 
Rembusch and Browning contend that Rossie did not follow the proper proce­dure in making the move and that the move is imprudent at the time. Rembusch quotes the Financial Fiscal Policy Bill of Student Government which was passed by last year's Senate. The bill specifically states that Father McCarragher must sign all checks. It also states that the "scope of authority" of the Student Union Treasur­er includes that his consultation is re­quired of any allocation...or other mat­ter affecting the financial status of Stu­dent Government." 
Rembusch said that Roderick was not asked about the matter and if Rossie had asked he would have found out that Rod­erick was against the move. Rembusch said that Rossie also failed to consult the Student Union Financial Committee, 
Browning, last year's SBP President Chris Murphy, last year's treasurer Tom Gound­rey, or himself. If he had, Rembusch said, he would have found out that every­one was opposed to the move. 
Rembusch cited a number of reasons why Father McCarragher's name should 
remain  on  the checks. His prime reasons  
were  that  if Student  Government  were  
overdrawn  on  their  account  the  bank  

would back it up if McCarragher signed the checks. "With Father McCarraJtiler's signature, Student Government is a legal entity within the University. Without it," Rem busch said, "we are not." Rembusch thought that with the Uni­versity's backing, somebody' in Student 

Government would be responsible for any 
debt that Student Government incurred. 
"I am very concerned," Rembusch said, "about students being burdened with all the responsibility for all the money that the Union handles." 
Browning said that as far as he was _oncerned "the move doesn't mean any­thing." Rossie basic argument was that Father McCarragher could stop Student ·Government from spending money for a certain project by refusing to sign the check. Browning said that Father McCarragher could stop a check now if he wanted to by just calling the bank president and asking him to stop payment. Browning said that Student Govern­ment had never had trouble with Father McCarragher over authorization of checks. In regard to Rossie's argument that it was more convenient without having to get Father's signature Browning said that he thought Rossie and Roderick would be out of town more than McCarragher would. Since "it doesn't make any difference," Browning thinks that Father McCarragher's signature should be retained for "the protection." "If we are independent than we are responsible for all our debts." He thinks people with whom the Student Union was dealing would "wonder if they could count on it." "If the Univer­sity is not financally responsible," Brown­ing said, "the Student Union could have trouble getting credit." As it is, Browning said, if Student Government needed the money Father McCarragher could pick up the phone and "the bank would give credit." 

Riehle To Meet Demonstrators 
By JOEL CONNELLY 
A group of 25 students arrested in an NAACP sit-in in South Bend last Mon. will meet this morning with Rev. James 
L. Riehle, CSC, Dean of Students. The purpose of the meeting, as defined by Senior Brian McTigue, will be to request that Father Riehle retract a statement allegedly made to WSND last week that 
those  arrested  would  be  liable  to disci­ 
. plinary  action  by the Un iversit y if con­ 
victed.  

Arrangements for the meeting were made Fri. afternoon when a group of more than 20 of those arrested came to Riehle's office at about 2:00 in the af­ternoon. As the group led by McTigue pushed into the office, Riehle denied them entrance and requested the arrested protesters make an appointment to see him. Spokesman McTigue countered with a demand for retraction of the WSND statement to which the Dean of Students replied "You're accusing me ot making a statement I didn't make. You can make an appointment and we can talk about this. Right now I've got an appointment at the Arts & Letters office." 
McTigue and the group refused to leave immediately, and argued with Riehle for more than I 5 minutes. Riehle main­tained that the Student Manual perscribes that any student arrested and convicted of a civil offense is liable to disciplinary action. Regarding the 25 arrested in the NAACP protest, The Dean of Students commented "All I can do is say what's in the manual. I don't know what will be done." 
The group expressed dissatisfaction with the responses of the Dean of Stu­dents. Pressing Riehle on point of the Manual, McTigue contended "We don't agree with the Student ManuaL We agree with the NSA statement that 'Institu­tional authority should never be used merely to duplicate the function of gener­al laws." 
McTigue then charged that the Univer­sity is taking "a negative status quo ·stand" on the race problems in South Bend. He stated "Our sit-in should have been direct at the University. What the University is doing is taking a negative status quo stand. The status quo in South 
Bend is white supremacy and second class 
citizenship for its black community." 
As the meeting continued, McTigue 
read the full NSA statement on civil 
arrests in cases such as civil rights. The 
statement contends that "Acts of students may upon occasion result in violation of laws. In such cases, institution officials should be prepared to apprise students of sources of legal counsel and may offer other assistance. Students who violate the law may incur penalties perscribed by civil authority, but institutional author­ity should never be used merely to dupli­cate the function of general laws." 

Answering McTigue's argument that the NSA directive ought to be the basis of University policy, Riehle stated "You received the Student Manual when you came here. By coming here you agreed to live by that manual." McTigue replied "The reason many of us are here today, Father, is to change what it says in that manual." 
After twenty minutes of sometimes heated argument the group agreed to Riehle's suggestion of the appointment for today. 
CCP l.etfer Attacks ROTC 
In a statement released yesterday the Campus Coalition for Peace asked the Administration to "withdraw both its active and tacit support of ROTC and that Father Hesburgh begin this with­drawal of support by refusing to conduct a Presidential Review in this or any other year." 
Issued by Seniors Michael Ryan and William Reishman the CCP statement charges that the "Administration is re­sponsible for perpetuating the Vietnam War by allowing ROTC to remain a part of Notre Dame." 

The statement further contends that "because the military institution is in­extricably linked to the war in Vietnam, and because the military institution must function to dehumanize individuals in order to achieve its inhuman goals, we are firmly dedicated to removing ROTC from the Notre Dame community." 
The CCP letter asks for concerned students and faculty to gather at the flag pole on the main quad at 2:30 p.m. tomorrow and to march together to the Presidential Review at 3: IS.

FROM THE HALLS OF PROTOZOA 
This column, normally a treasure house of twinkly quips and slapdash japery, has now been appearing in your campus newspaper for fourteen years, and if I have le3:rned one thing in these fourteen long years, it is not to try to be funny in the last column of the semester. With final exams looming obscenely close, you don't want jokes; you want help. 
So today, foregoing levity, I give you a quick cram course in the subject you are all flunking. I refer, of course, to biology. 
Biology is divided into several phylla, or classes. First is the protozoa, or one-celled animal. Protozoa can be taught simple things like bringing in the newspaper, but when shopping for pets it is best to look for animals with at least two cells, or even four if your yard has a fence around it. 

Another popular class of animals is the periphera-a 
shadowy category that borders often on the vegetable. 
Take, for example, the sponge. The sponge is definitely an 
animal. The wash-cloth, on the other hand, is definitely not. 
Next we come to the arthropoda, or insects. Most people 
find insects unattractive, but actually there is exquisite 
beauty in the insect world if you trouble to look. Take, for 
instance, the lovely insect poems of William Cullen 
Sigafoos-Tumbling Along with the Tumbling Tumblebug 
and Fly Gently, Sweet Aphid and Gnats My Mother 
Caught Me. Mr. Sigafoos, alas, has been inactive since the 
invention of DDT. 

Our next category is the mollusca-lobsters, shrimp, and 
the like. Lobsters are generally found under rocky projec­
tions on the ocean bottom. Shrimps are generally found in 
a circle around a small bowl containing cocktail sauce. 
Personna Super Stainless Steel Blades are generally 
found at any counter where Personna Super Stainless 
Steel Blades are sold. 

I mention Personna Blades because the makers of Per­
sonna Blades pay me to write this column, and they are 
inclined to get edgy if I neglect to mention their product. 
Some get double edgy and some single, for Personna 
Blades come both in double edge style and Injector style. 
Mind you, it is no burden for me to mention Personna, 
for it is a blade that shaves quickly and cleanly, slickly and 
keenly, scratchlessly and matchlessly. It is a distinct pleas­
ure to shave with Personna Blades and to write about 
them but sometimes, I confess, I find it difficult to work 
the commercial into a column. Some years ago, for ex­
ample, I had the devil's own time working a Personna plug 
into a column about Alexander the Great. The way I finally 
managed it was to have Alexander say to the Oracle at 
Delphi, "Oracle, I have tasted all the world's pleasures, 
yet I am not content. Somehow I know there is a joy I have 
missed." To which the Oracle replied, "Yes, Alexander, 
there is such a joy-namely Personna Blades-but, alas for 
you, they will not be invented for another 2500 years." 
Whereupon Alexander fell into such a fit of weeping that 
Zeus finally took pity and turned him into a hydrant ... 
Well sir, there is no question I sold a lot of Personnas with 
this ingenious commercial, but the gang down at the 
American Academy of Arts and Letters gave me a mighty 
good razzing, you may be sure. 

But I digress. Back to biology and the most advanced 
phyllum of all-the chordata, or vertebrates. There are 
two kinds of vertebrates: those with vertical backbones 
and those with horizontal. Generally it is easy to tell them 
apart. A fish, for instance, has a horizontal backbone, and 
a man has a vertical backbone. But what if you run into 
a fish that swims upright or a man who never gets out of 
the sack? How do you tell them apart? Science struggled 
with this sticky question for years before Sigafoos of 
M.I.T. came up with his brilliant solution: offer the crea­ture a pack of Personna Blades. If it is a fish, it will refuse. If it is homo sapiens, it will accept-and the more sapient, the quicker. 
And now you know biology. And now, for the fourteenth time, aloha.

ENOU&H SCOUR_GING LH'S START Til£ C.RUCiFIX(ON f 
Joel eonnelly,.............. 
were bills concerning the abolishment of the ROTC program at Notre Dame, the prohibition of the University from accepting secret government contracts, the abolishment of the position of college Senators, the establishment of college governments, and the proposed raise in the student activities fee. 
The startling fact that makes Thursday's meeting even more tragic is that it was not the first time that the Senate has lacked a quorum. Thursday was the sixth time in its last seven meetings that the Senate has lacked a quorum. Most of the bills that were to be considered Thursday night have been on the Senate's agenda for its last eight meetings. 
It is time for something to be done. Many of the Senators have been absent from as many as six to eight meetings, while the limit for unexcused absences is two. It is too late to do anything about those Senators now. It is too late to remove them from office and replace them with responsible legislators. However, something can be done to insure that they do their job for the remainder of the year. 
Tonight the Senate will meet again -or attempt to. It will consider the Student Government budget for the summer, the bills that it failed to consider last week, and the bill asking for the ten dollar raise in the Student Activities fee. We urge every Senator 
to attend tonight's meeting. With the advances made toward self-government at Notre Dame in the past few years the role of the Senate has become extremely important. Senators must become more concerned about their office if self-government is to work at Notre Dame. If the Senate 
finds itself without a quorum again tonight -it could just be the last time the Senate meets. Student government might be forced to look someplace else for a responsible representative body. It might find one, or self-government just might die tonight -along 
with the Senate. 
Rule Number Eight 
University Rule Number Eight is most explicit. Conveniently found on page two of The Student Manual, it states that "Any student who has been publicly arrested is subject to disciplinary action by the Dean of Students." 
No one seems to be able to explain exactly why the University should pass its own judgement and impose its own punishment upon a student charged by civil authorities. 
The University cannot ignore violations of existing laws on its campus, but if the University is to enforce civil statutes and punish their off campus violation, then let the school's officials wear South Bend or Indiana State police uniforms or carry FBI identification. 
If a student violates any state law and is convicted, he will face society's punishment. Disciplinarians who add Notre Dame's punishment to any civil penalty incurred do more to bring embar­rassment to this University than any civil disobedience by Notre Dame students. 
It is our hope that the twenty-five Notre Dame students arrested in last Monday's sit-in will face no Administration reprisals. However Rule Number Eight is still in black and white in the Student Manual. It stands as an unnecessary intrusion of the University into a student's life and a duplication of civil authority. Not enforcing this rule against the twenty-five students involved in the sit-in last week is not enough. The rule still remains in the Manual for use at a more Administratively convenient time. 
It would seem that there are enough University rules and campus rules and regulations and directives for the Administration to impose and enforce and enough campus violations to punish that the Administration need not compete with the South Bend police for punishment of student violations of civil laws.

About ten days ago, I sat m the back of the Student Center Am­p~thea.tre listening to Dean of Students Fr. Riehle speak on the directive on demonstrations. In the appearance, Riehle spoke can­didly of his lack of rapport with certain elements of the student body and his inability to adequately communicate with students. His talk was revealing in the sense that it pointed out in part a pro­blem of communication and action which exists at Notre Dame. 
Fr. Riehle himself has in my dealings with him been exceedingly pleasant and quite open to opinion differing from his own. In fact, he has made a conscious effort to obtain a broad spectrum of stu­dent views. The same can be said for Fr. McCarragher, who in spite of one's differences with him is a pretty great person to talk with. Even Fr. Hesburgh in the late hours of the evening is quite open to those who wish to approach him. 
However, the simple act of listening is not enough. It is here that the Administration has this year made a most significant error. The student viewpoint has been met with tolerance. Communication has been established to the extent that Fr. McCarragher and Rich Rossie talk almost daily. Everything is pleasant, except perhaps for some Riehle-radical and Riehle-Rossie discussion. The essential pant, though, is that little has been accomplished. 
Two years ago student government lay down in a major series of discussions with Fr. McCarragher and, with considerable application of pressure, obtained abolition of curfew. It would seem, however, that that was one of the few times ever around here where negotia­tion between equals took place. Of course there have been isolated 1 cases, the most notable being the student who spoke three hours with Fr. Hesburgh during the suspension controversy of last month. For the most part, though, we have been met by open ears but closed minds. · Now for years at this place the students clamored to be heard. Now, however, the tolerance of Fr. Hesburgh and the wise advice of Fr. McCarragher do not suffice. Neither is it adequate for Fr. Riehle to seek out student opinion but then not respond to it when deci­sions are being made or directives drawn up. Student resentment has grown over this, with Riehle becoming the unfortunate public victim. Clearly the Administration must realize that an open ear policy will merely keep the lid on, not prevent the pressure from building. 
More serious even than the resentment against the Administra­tion is the credibility gap which has arisen. I know this is an old expression, but it has a great deal of validity here at the moment. This has been a year of great expectations and great letdowns. From the verbal point of view, much has been done. In the General As­sembly and in the Student Senate the student voice has been heard. Again and again people have conferred. Many have logically expect­ed action after each meeting. Their hopes, however, have been dashed. There is an open contradiction for all to see between what is said and what has been done. 
Thus far the year has brought but two significant changes ­Senior cars and student management of the student center (one must admit, though, that this latter change has been a source of the juciest of quotes and the most vicious of hate mail). With the toler­ance of the Administration and apparent opennes.s to even the most radical of proposals must more was expected. Disappointment and frustration have led to resentment and distrust. The Administration to alleviate this must be ready not simply to listen, but to act.

In America's Political Capital
JOEL CONNELLY
By Indianapolis is a city which rather gaudily stresses its Americanism. The center of the city is dotted with monu­ments to soldien, sailort, wus, and so on. The newspapers are parochial and conser­vative, having as their notion of the world the state of Indiana and the small portion of Illinois occupied by the Tribune Tower in Chicago. Ho·.vever,. Indianapolis is also a city with another side in the form of a dyn~t­mic young mayor who is a former Rhodes Scholar.While beautiful homes dot U.S. 31 comTng into the cily, there exist sprawling Negro areas but a few blocks away. Many in the population tend to be young and reasonably sophisticated rather than old and Hoosier. Over the past three weeks, lndianlt­poli h.. become not only the capital of the slate of Indiana but the polilicJI capilal of lhe country. Within a block in downtown Indy are located the head­quaners of the rhree contenders in the Indiana Primary. Each center of activity has its own personality, ils own spiril. Branigan Headquarters ·mixes folksy hospitality with hard politics. Although the. aging conservative Democraltc GoY.. ernor of Indiana spends long houn of every day decrying the spending or his opponents. he still is applying corsider· 
able muscle through a patronage army which runs into the thousands. Branigan poaten and buttons can be eatily spotted in most every courthouse of the st'ate. This is Branigan's strength. The man's appeal is to the traditional. Indiana. In this context, there are slogans such as "Put Indiana Firsl.. and ''Make hidiana Count." Presumably you can do this through allowing the Governor lo conlrol the state's delegation in Chicago. Brant­gan also subtly relys on hate Kennedy sentiment, of which there is considerable in Indiana. There are no Wallace.style denunciations, only a harping on the fmancial issue. However. with the talk at headquarters. it is clear what the Brant­gan people think of.,.the juniOr Senator from New York. 
Kennedy headquarten i5 .anything but folksy. There appears to be a super-efficiency of operation, with no haclu standing around. Most of the operatives here are young. There is a businesslike quality about everything, and also an intensity which matches that· of the Senator. However nobody is treated rudely or shoYCd aside. Everything is ·done with a grace ,of dignity.  
Kennedy is not waging the old-style campaign of butto'ns, sashes, and bumper stickers. All traditional instruments, even literature, are at a minimum. Clearly there is a concentration on two aspects of campaigning-· the canvass and the ITWI media. Volunteers are plentiful and each is given a task. 
The McCarthy Headquarters, which was my home for six days, is ln the old and burned out Claypool Hotel. Abraham Lincoln once spoke from its steps and il looks as though they haven't been cleaned 
since. The headquarters is spacious and none too organized. The McCarthy oper­at ion ls one of those where everything gets done, but not in the organized German Army-style fashion. Presiding over this organized chaos are a set of .exceedingly talented ameteurs. The percentage of New York attorneys is high. as are the number of people you might expect to ~ec at the Israel bond dinner. 
The McCarthy staff started out crude and inexperienced, However, after five primaries it knows how to operate. Again. as with Kennedy but even rnoreso, there is emphasis on canvassing and television. The main task is to get the Senator known. and every resource known to man is being applied to put Clean '"Gene berore the ft'lfers. 
Notre Dame 'scontribution to the Clay-pool operation is consi4,er:~ble. In the forefront of ihe talented amateurs is Notre Dame's Dr. James Bogle. Bogle, founder of Hoosiers for a Democntic Alternative, performs along with Curtis Gans of the national staff as campaign manaser. Dow·n the hall from· Bogle's office is state youth headquarters, where the massive Student canvass is directed from. Here one fmds Mary Perrone, foN mer Sl. Mary's Academic Commissioner· and state McCarthy youth director. 
How is Indianapolis taking the car& paign and the fact that Hoosierville just could select the next President of the· United States? Branigan's headquarlers is clearly the most popular wilh the very elderly.since it offers a folksy atmosphere not to mention dime hotdop. McCarthy has attracted support from Indianapolis's sizeable suburbs with a GOP crossover expected. However. Ken11edy, as reported in Newsweek l~st week, seems to have the most sizable portion of the vote. 
Institutional Indianapolis seems to back Branigan. The newspapers have put the governor on the front page every Way and have treated Kennedy in the manner that the Peking Review treats Khruschev. The state employees and politicians are faith­fully backin& the Governor who has &iven chem chairs to warm. However. all and all, even as the tempo reaches its climax, the city remains curiously detached towards 
it all.

seeing lhat '"we are now embark· ed on that coune··, the Bishop said he had decided to speak more generally on lhe whole principle of war. 
Ue began by citing gospel passages where Christ had un­equivocally called his followers to roles as peacemakers. '"The Christian in the world is always in a field of tension between his \'alues.as a follower of Chrisl and his' values as a realiSI in human society.

However, we don '1 acknow­ledge what We know as true. "Uke children we play at inter­mediate war.

Our martiallechnology has indeed brought us back to the teachings of Christ. with "the realization that warfare ...cannot setlle lhe ult1mate qucslions which" divide mankind." 
The Auxilary ·Bishop of Sl.

on to discuss the recent efforts of

GRID SCRAMBLE FRANTIC 
With only five practices re­maining, the scramble for posi­tions is becoming frantic among ND footballers. Personnel at many positions is uncertain six days before Saturday's Blue and Gold in tersquad game. 
Even veteran observers in the press box had to admit the situation was confusing Saturday 
as  the  starters  defeated  the  re­ 
serves  43-22  in  a  game-t ype  
scrimmage.  

On the offensive line, Jim Seymour and Jim Winegardner are fixtures at ends. Charles Ken­nedy appears to have won the left tackle job created when Jim Reilly moved to guard. Ken­nedy will play oppostie co-cap­tain George Kunz. 
Reilly was out with a bad ank­le Saturday, so freshman Larry 
DiNardo, sophomore Ed Tuck and I967 starter Tom McKinley handled the chores at guard. Once Reilly returns, the real battle will be between DiNardo and McKinely for the other pos­ition. 
The center job was locked in Tim Monty's hands until he was injured early in the first quarter. Mike Holtzapfel replaced him. 
Coley O'Brien quarterbacked the first unit because Terry Hanratty is still nursing a pulled hamstring. Jeff Zimmerman's groin injury kept him out of action and moved Ron Dushney into the starting backfield. Bob Gladieux has nailed down a half­back job and will run opposite Ed Ziegler or Frank Criniti. Ziegler has the inside track. 
On defense, freshman Bob Neidert has moved into a ter­minal post with Bob Keucher­berg. Pat Mudron, another frosh, currently is beating out Eric Norri for a tackle slot alongside 
Mike McCoy. 
Linebacking jobs may be o­pen up until the day of the opening game next fall. Bob Olson and Tony Capers seem secure, but the other two back­ers will come from a group which includes Tim Kelly, Jim Wright, Larry Schumacher, John Lavin and Jim Merletti. Kelly and Wright, both frosh, were front runners Saturday. Merletti hob­lied twice in the top of the ship Fund.
