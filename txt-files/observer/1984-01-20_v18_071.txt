Taxpayers in Indiana who fail to report interest. dividend~ and patronage dividends received after Ike. 31, 1983 may be subject to 20 percent withholding. According to the Internal Ht·wnut· Service, "backup withholding" is the ncw requircmcnt t·nat·ted by Congress whkh directs financial institutions to deduct .20 percent of intt:rest and dividend payments due certain in­dividual~. The .20 percent withholding can be triggcred on intcrcst and dividends bv four situations. One situation is when payees refuse to providt· thl'i.r correct taxpayer identification number (usually their social ~ecuritv number) to banks, brokers and other payers who arc required t;, tile intiJrmation returns. Withholding can also be startt·d if the taxpayer identification number provided to the IRS is incorrect. A third situation that can trigger withholding is whcn people have been identified as failing to include all reportable inrer­est. dividends and patronage dividends on their tax returns. The last situation that triggers withholding is when a payee fails to certifY undn pt·naltit·s of perjury. that he or sht· is not subject to backup withholding. -The Obsener

Notre Dame women struggle within the status quo 
As the class of'H7 marches into their second semester 
of college, future members of the class of '88 anxiously 
await thick letters from Notre Dame. 
Seventy percent of those receiving letters of accep· 
tance will be men; only 30 percent will be women. 
An administration-imposed ceiling on women's ad­
missions allots -;oo places in the class of'88 to women and I 2<;0 spots to men. As one might guess, this makes it more difficult for women to gain entrance to the Uni­versity. 
But contrary to some rumors, the average Notre Dame women is not considerably more qualified for college than her male counterpart. According to Pat Leonardo, assistant director of admissions, there is al­most no disparity between the average SAT scores of successful male candidates and successful female can­didates. The average woman admitted will be in the top 3-4 percent of her high school class, while thc average man will he in the top "i-8 percent ofhis class. 
Because nearly twice as many men as women apply in a typical year, compcti­tion for women's admisssion is not as fierce as the 70:30 expansion ofcurrent buildings. 

Even if undergraduate enrollment remains un­changed, a change in the male/female ratio will cause housing difficulties. 
The most obvious solution is to convert one of the men's dorms into a women's dorm. But according to Sister Miriam Jones, assistant provost, this was tried in the t1rst years of coeducation with less than promising results. "The men felt they were being replaced in thdr dorms as well as in the classroom," she said. 
Another possible solution 
is to encourage more pc<~ple 
to move off campus, but the 
ratio would suggest. Still, the admissions process is "more competitive for girls and we can he a little more selective," said Leonardo. 
If the ceiling on women's admissions were eliminated Leonardo estimates the male/female ratio would shift approximately 8 pcr­cent. 
Federal law states that schools must admit students on quality alone, without 
regard to sex. Private 
schools, however, arc ex­
cmpted from this law. 
Therefore, there is no legal inequity inherent in the currcnt limit on woman's admissions. Still, it seems only fair that women be given the same opportunity for ad­mission as men. 
Unfortunately, lifting the ceiling on women's admis­sion is a bit more complicatcd than changing the addresses on a few thick envelopes. In order for more women to he admitted, either the total number of un­dergraduates must increase or the number of men ad-· mitted decrease. Both of these options lead to problems. 
The PACE report, compiled hy the provost last year to give suggestions for improving the Notre Dame com­munity, recommends undergraduate enrollment be maintained at 7,500. Considering the present lack of classroom space and crowding in the dining halls, dorms, and other facilities, an increase in under­graduate enrollment is out of the question without an

annual spring hysteria over a threatened housing lot~ery renders this solution i~lef­fective. 
A third possibility is to construct another dorm. If the present demand for housing continues, a new dorm would cut down on cramped conditions in the halls and allow for greater flexibility in admissions. Un­fortunately, new dorms cost money. 
The effect of a shift in 
Notre Dame admissiom 
policy on Saint Miry's must 
also he considered. AI 
though few students apply to both schools, it is possible that an increase in women's admissions at the llniver­sty would induce more women to apply to both schools. 
What is more likely is that a considerable increase in the number of women at Notre Dame would have a negative effect on Saint Mary's social life. "We don't 
want to make Saint Mary's an island. They now are welcome here. We don't want this to change," said Jones. 
The PACE report recommends that "during the academic year of I983/84, the University reevaluate 
the matter of the proportion ot men to women on the undergraduate level ..." According to Jones, no such project is underway.

Associated Press 
INDIANAPOLIS -Public Service Indiana's abandonment of the Marble Hill nuclear plant "was a tremendous impact" for the coal in­dustry, United Mine Workers presi· dent Richard L Trumka said yesterday. 
Trumka said the Marble Hill case 
proves what miners have been 
saying for years, namely, that 
nuclear power can't compete with 
coal-fired plants. 
"We can build in Indiana a coal-
SENIORS 
fired power plant with every en­
vironmental control available 10 it 
and will burn coal cleanly for ahout 
sI billion," he said. 
By contrast, the pricetag for 
Marble Hill was in excess of 57 bil­
lion by the company's own es­
timates, he said. 
"Economically, nuclear power ,cannot compete with coal," the miner-la·wyer told reporters. 
Trumka. the leader of the 
2'i0,000-member union. came to In­
diana to visit with state legislators

Trumka was scheduled to meet with Orr Thursday afternoon and he anticipated a congenial session witp the Republican governor. 
The union opposes a hill pending

12 million-ton reduction in sulfur dioxide emissions. a move which Trumka said would cost the jobs of 60,000 miners and 180,000 jobs in mining support industries.

Student Affairs pizza solution shows promise 
Three cheers for the Office of Student 

Affairs. 
After threatening to outlaw pizza and otht-r non-pat·kaged foods from dorm sales, the office decided to hack off. 
Perhaps student outrage: from a usually dormant campus madt: Father John Van Wolvkar change his mind. Perhaps he .md the llniversity wen: tired of the: publicity. Or mayllt.' he never really in­tt·mkd to fi1rhid pizza salt:s in the first place. 
Whatever the case, food sales were 
shut down during finals wec:k -when 
students had other things on their minds 
and after The Obsen1er had stopped 
publishing. Since: then ahout half have 
reopened aftt:r passing a second inspec­
tion. 

lnstt:ad of ending food sales, Student Affairs has decided to give the managt:rs another chance. Michac:l McCauslin, a specialist in tht: University's Environmen­tal Health and Safety department, has 
drawn up a set of guiddines for all food sales operators. 
McCauslin sounds optimistic about the future and apologt:tic about the past. He nott:s that these are tht: first guiddines issut:d to food saks managers, and that he: didn't think "this prohlem had been recognized as a problem" prt:viously. 
Already having st:en marked improvt:­ments, McCauslin says ht: is "more than willing" to help food sales managers with any problems concerning health and 
safety. Such talk is encouraging, especial­ly after the many threats the University has hurled at Notre Dame students this year. 
The action of Student Affairs is good news in January, but it would have been great news in early December. Let's hope the University shows the same com­mon sense and openness is resolving stu­dent concerns in the future.

So we talked. I c:xplaim·d to him that most rll'wspapt-r" adhl·n· to the gl·rmanl·nes" rule. And sinlT it is not really germanl· -nll'rdy inllTl'"ting -that Terry Lynn (;ootlman is white it mostly wt·nt llllllll'nlionl·d. We arl· now ;u "'Hlll' mitlpoinl. pa.'t whl·n· race gets mentioned in some pejorative or tlefinitiw sense -a~ if it is all you nc:etl to know about a pl·rson -and not quite to where il can be mc:ntionc:tl at all. As for tc:kvision, it had no need to comment. It mc:rdy nc:c:tletl to show. 
Nc:vc:rthdc:ss, the fact remains that Terry Lynn Goodman hc:camc: the Invisible: Woman of the entire (;ootlman episode. Both among hlacks anti whites, her race was a topic ofcon· vc:rsation. After all, illlc:rracial marriages are hardly commonplace. 
For whites, they go to the core of race prc:jutlicc:, miscegenation and all ofthat. It was not too long ago. after all, that a hlack man could be lynched li1r merely winking at a white woman. 
As for hlacks, they arc not indifferent to in­ll·rmarriagc: either. My caller toltl me that the hlacks on his staff were furious at Goodman for marrying a white woman. And a hlack woman friend said she had heard the same thing, coupled with denunciations of Mrs. 6oodman as "white trash." Lots of hlack women fed there is shortage enough of c:ligihk hlack men without some of them marrying out of their race. 
When it comes to tlc:nial ofthc ohvious, the Goodman saga was a tour de force. It is ap· parent that race, like sex in the Victorian era, has hecome the great unmentionable. Lots of people notice it, hut few want to puhlicly come 10 grips with it, pretending that not mc:lllioning it shows utopian ·enlightenmnt and merely mentioning it shows prejudice. 
But the subject is not without interest. not without consc:qucnce. Anti the way Mrs. Goodman was handlcd is illustrative of the way the whole issue of race was treated when it came to the Goodman saga. Although some mentioned race as a way of criticizing Jesse Jackson (Would he have tlone the samc for a white?), few paused to cc:kbratt: the occasion for tht: samt: reason. 
To start with Goodman himself, he is a second gcnt:ration military officer -until rc:cc:mly, an unheard of phenomenon for blacks. Not only that, hut he is an officer in the Navy, the branch of the service that tradition­ally was the most hostile to hlacks. 
But Goodman is only half the story. Tht: otht:r half is, ofcourse, Jackson. llt:rt: is somt:­thing new under the sun -a mt:aningful hlack presitlentialcandidatc:. llntiltht: Voting Rights Act, Jackson would have been a mt:re 
) 

curiosity. Blacks were largely unregistt:red, few could vote, anti no black candidate could have hatl any chance of either gaining the nomination or, at lcast, influencing the con­vention. 
The point is that race was a theme in the c:ntirt: Goodman c:pisotlc:, and tht: failure to ac­knowletlgt: the obvious was an epic exercise in historic amnesia But when it came to Mrs. Goodman, the failure was more per~onal. Ignoring her ract: once she ht:rsdf chose to surfdct: tentlt:tl to dt:prive her of her in· dividuality. 
She remained an abstraction and if, as some said, the doqut:nce and poise of Goodman's part:nts showed hlacks to advantage, then the refusal to tleal with her failed to do the same for ht:r. 
Instead, sht: was shrouded in mystery, as if there was somt·thing shameful ht:re. She wa~ made an t:xotic when she is merely a woman. The Goodman epiSlJtlt: proves two things: When it comes to race, we havt: come a long way. And when it comes to race, wt: still ha~ a long way to go.

The young professional 
Death in the ND family 
by Rev. Robert Griffin 
features columnist 

I.Je is one o fthe YoungUurban .l .lProfessionals whom Time magazine calls Yuppies. He lives in a townhouse, which he can't afford, with a youngwoman who shares ex­penses. He claims that he is in love with the young woman so that everyone will treat the two of them as though they were married. A living arrangement ofconvr,:nience does not a marriage make, in my opinion; whatever the depths of caring, they don't love each other enough to take the vows, binding themselves to fidelity forever. It's none ofmy business iithey share bed ~d board, as long as they don't insist to me that their cohabitation is as sincere as marriage. The young man reminds me of the Hemingway character who thought it was romantic to have a mistress instead ofa w'ife. It takes patience to refrain from telling him he is immature. At . dinner, it feels like I'm seeing a case study from the Yuppie Handbook. 
We dine at an ethnic restaurant so that he can eatsushi. Sushi tastes to me like the part ofthe fish that the chefshould throw out. It may be brain food for young professionals, but I'm too old to pretend that it isn't bad. "lfyou know sushi like I know sushi," I say as a joke, when he notices that I am not eating. 
He has a favorite waitress. I too have preferred waitresses at places like the University Club. Having a preferred waitress at age thirty is like having a mistress with whom loyalty means everything. We weren't allowed to see a menu until Madame Butterfly was free to serve 
I( 
Movies 
us. We couldn't order a drink until Madame Butterfly had time to bring it. On a busy night, we could have starved to death because Madame Butterfly's attention was necessary to hisbon appetit. It cost us an extra hour, insisting on Madame Butterfly, because she had other customers who were more important. Itwas his ego trip, not mine, so he left the tip. At New York restaurants, you pay the price ifyou want them to remember your name. 
I'm not being fair to him. He wanted to be impressive, so there were intimate little wines he swore by, and grape-leave quiches, and ex­pensive cigarettes free ofsaltpeter, which is an anti-aphrodisiac he says, handmade by Sherman the tobac­
conist on Fifth Avenue. He is making it in New York as a successful Yuppie. He has horror stories to tell and battle scars to show. The skir­mishes and victories seem larger than life. 
I keep looking behind his excite· 
ment at making it, for his signs ofsin­
cerity. I hear him talking down to 
me, and his glibness is annoying. I 
want him to be simpler in his life­
style. I hope I am not jealous ofa 
young professional who keeps 
trying to convince me he's having a 
ball. 
An Irish Yuppie has this gift ofgab, which is often poetry until he tries to live up to it. Young Yuppies grow into old Yuppies, when they become shabby and sad, like phonies, be­cause they've kidded themselves too long. One is old enough at thirty to turn authentic. One is old enough to laugh at himself, or be laughed at by his friends, as a stereotype which is not funny. Yuppiness doesn't have to be terminal as a character flaw. 

The young man said, "We have gotten a cat." Ofcourse. A townehouse is not a home without a cat. Just Molly and me, and Tabby makes three. A cat is not as much ofa commitment as a dog would be; no couple evergave hostages to fortune by adopting a cat. A cat is a survivor ifyou give up the lease, as expend­able as a live-in girlfriend. It's the creature that people who are busy or selfish would choose: you never have to take a cat for a walk or an airing. It's the pet that suits the flexibility of modern arrangements ofconvenience: a cat doesn't get confused when one ofthe partners leave. 
I hated hearing that they had got­ten a cat. t sounded to me like a substitute for the nuisance of children. 
I like both him and her. I would prefer to see each one ofthem making it separately as Yuppies, living in separate apartments; ar­guing (ifyou will forgive the pun) from ditlerent premises, until they are ready for a consecrated toget­h:rness; but it's none ofmy business. They want me to praise and admire them as a wonderful team, but they make me sad Sushi and handmade cigarettes and Madame Butterfly don't impress me, but like their own families, I play the game hiding the truth. 
I don't have the courage to declare that keeping a cat is the waste ofa townhouse. Why should Young Urban Professionals listen to me?

ne can't ecscape the positive conversation concerning the past year's holiday film releases, a selection offilms that helped give the movie industry some dignity in a year they'd probably like to forget. While "Yentl" and "Silkwood" were popular crowd pleasers,John Lith­gow's "Terms of Endearment" stands out as the finest ofthe holiday ftlms. 
"Terms ofEndearment" stars Shir­ley Mac Laine as a middle aged widow, Debra Winger as Mac Laine's newly married daughter, Jack Nic­holson, an ex-astronaut and Mac Laine's neighbor.and Jeff Daniels as Winger's husband. "Terms" catalogues the progression ofa relationship between a mother and a daughter, from the daughter's younger years to her sudden and shocking death. 
Debra Winger, in a role that's quite a change from "An Officer and a Gentleman," plays a newlywed and mother of three trying to make the best ofan overabundance of problems. Emma (Winger) comes into contlict with her mother who disapproves ofher new husband. She also has trouble with her hus· hand. that becomes unfaithful all too st>on, and two bothersome sons. 
Shirley Mac Laine is Aurora, a mot­her that has to deal with the parting ofher daughter from home, a new man in her life, and the advent t ofher new title, "grandmother." 
Jeff Daniels (Flap) must decide between a better job in a new state and his wife's desire to remain in Texas. 
The film's title is perfect, in that all its' characters must come to terms with the decisions and changes in their lives. What makes "Terms of Endearment" so unique is its' ability to fine tune into reality. "Terms" takes the ordinary and makes it spe­cial, without any special effects or flashy photo&liilphy. We become part ofthe H<Tfton family as they en­counter situations in their lives that we've encountered or are yet to 
face. 
Ifa film rejects special effects and unusual story lines, then it must draw upon other resources to make it work. In other words, the charac· ters must become thespecial effects in this type offilm. It is with great success that the characters do carry the weight in "Terms." Winger's Em­ma is finely crafted from the way she wears her hair to the way she walks. Emma is so enjoyable because she is so sincere. She really works hard to make her marriage work and make things better for herself. Emma is neither very beautiful or very intel­ligent, just an person making the best ofwhat she has. 
Shirley Mac Laine is a somewhat 
eccentric character. Sheappears as if 
she knows it all' ~i{J' Hlls ~t:dt.ifall, 
and refuses to compromise her stan­
dards. Jack Nicholson is an ex· 
astronaut who is determined to 

Ifany criticism can be made ofthe film, it may be that it tries too hard to be emotional at times. The film has been criticized for being too melodramatic and too obvious about what it tries to do. Overall, though, the film is sincere and any melodrama that may appear in the 
film's slow beginningfades out in its' progression. "Terms ofEndear­ment" is receiving a lot ofattention in a year when it doesn't have much competition to worry about. "Terms" is listed as the top film on

S
hortly before 5 p.m. on Thursday, Dec. 29, I got a call from St . 
Joseph Medical Center with news that oneofourfreshmen was in 
serious condition in cardiac care. Calls like that come occasionally, 
but this time Iwas doubly shocked, for I knew Ken Furuhashi and his 
family for nearly seven years. 
Within 15 minutes I was at the hospital and met his shocked and confused parents. Yu and Mitsu, waiting outside the unit while Ken was being wired to various life-sustaining devices inside. 
That night our vigil began at his bedside: 40 hours ofprayer, spoken and silent, that God would deliver him from suffering andre­store him to health. In a briefsign ofhope that night, a nurse told us that he requested to watch the liberty Bowl on his bedside T.V., but his heart was too unstable and his consciousness too brief 
Ken still recognized us that night, uncomfortable as hewas. Later, when his dad told him that we had indeed won the Uberty Bowl, he feebly raised his right arm in a victory salute. That was about his last gesture, a last sign ofrecognition as he lapsed into a coma early Friday morning. 
Compassionate doctors and nurses shared our anxiety and tried their best to understand and treat his mysterious ailment. Nothing seemed to work. Bottles ofsaline and dextrose, pumped full of strong medicines -nothing changed the inevitable downward spiral ofKen's declining heart. 
Many others came and kept vigil with us during those long hours -colleagues from the business school, priests ofHoly Cross, deans and faculty, all praying and hoping -a procession ofthe Notre Dame family. 
The procession continued in the days following Ken's death, gathering with his family, keeping vigil over his coffin in the Lady Chapel ofSacred Heart Church, and carrying him to rest in Cedar Grove Cemetary at the entrance to the campus. 
It was a procession ofsad faces ofmothers and fathers, wondering how they would deal with the death ofa child oftheir own. Some, indeed had undergone similar tragic experiences, and wept again, openly, as they saw another family in sorrow and disbelief 
Those who knew Ken understood better the great loss for his fami­ly. He was a good son and brother and friend And eighteen years of life is so short. Ken lived it with such enthusiasm and grace, such joy and high ideals. 
In his own quiet way he grew up quickly, loving those around him 
and making great plans to extend his loving service to all God's 
people. He loved Notre Dame and all he experienced here. His mind 
and body were developing well. His spirit was deepening in faith, 
hope, and love. 
Ken began very early to learn all .he could learn. He was an excel­
lent student, full ofwonder and curiosity. Through his studiesoflan­
guage and science he found great inspiration to go further and 
further into the mysteries ofGod's creation. 
The beauties oftwo cultures tantalized him and so much did he 
look forward to spending next year in Tokyo to further explore his 
OV\'I1Japanese roots. Music and art flourished in his family and he so 
enjoyed the companyofthese gifts in himselfand those close to him. 
Through all those eighteen years he found endless ways to 
demonstrate his love for his parents and sister, his friends and class­
mates. His quiet strength and goodness gave much hope to all ofus. 
Ken and all ofus looked forward to so many more years of 
friendship and love and service together here on earth. Now we are 
faced with the reality that those plans are changed forever. 
Ken was baptized in Sacred Heart Church 18 years ago, an act of 
faith on the part ofhis parents. When we brought him back to that 
church for burial a few weeks ago, we tried to call forth a similarly 
strong faith -faith in God's love. Only God can tum our sadness at 
parting into joy for Ken's new life in God's kingdom. 
Many ofus only come to realize it in tragedy -but it is neverthe­
less always true: We are the Notre Dame family. How often have we 
rejoiced in this place, celebrating our common life and adventures 
as we learn about God's universe and strengthen our resolve to bet­
ter serve his people throughout the world. 
How often, too, have we shared our saddest moments as a family. 
We come together in joy and sorrow, in sickness and in health, in life 
and in death. We believe in the Lord's presence in our lives and we 
look to him for salvation from suffering and sin and death. 
We truly are God's children, members ofone family. Notre Dame 
helps us immensely to stay together as a family. When we finally 
come into that kingdom oflight and peace we shall know what it is 
like. Ken now has tha knowledge. We stay behind a while longer, 
waitingand hopingfor ourown share in God'sgood time. When that 
time comes we too shall see God as he is. That we believe. 
Lord, help our unbelief.

Go after 22nd consecutive winning season 
Men fencers open with two wins 
By MICHAELJ. CHMIEL 
Sports Writer 
Veteran coach Mike DeCicco 
believes that his Notre Dame men's 
fencing team is an epee man away 
from being an outstanding team as 
the Irish begin their 1984 season 
with a record of 2-0. 
After losing three all-Americans to graduation, the Irish are looking for­ward to a 22nd consecutive winning season. 
"I believe that we have the talent 
to notch a fourth straight 20-win 
season," explained DeCicco. 
This year's team boasts extremely 
competitive sabre and foil groups 
along with a young and determined 
epee squad. 
The foil squad, lead by sophomore Mike VanderVelden, who posted a 34-20 mark a year ago, finished second in individual competition in the United States Fencing Associa­tion (USFA) Collegiate Open held last weekend in Chicago. The Irish, 
who beat MIT, 5-l, and Penn, ';-3, lost to Columbia, 3-5, in the final round. 
Van der Velden, who finished fourth in the foil at the Great Lakes Championships last year, won the gold medal for individual foilers at 

Mike VanderVelden 
the USFA Open to go along with his 
4-1 season, which includes a 3-0 
record against Pennsylvania on jan. 
11. 
In the number two starting posi­tion is freshman Charles Higgs­Coulthard, who had an outstanding preseason according to DeCicco. Higgs-Coulthard's season record is at 6-2 with an impressive 4-0 mark against Cornell Tuesday. 
Senior Chris Grady, captain ofthe foil squad, will provide experience and stability throughout the season as he came into the year with a 30-22 career record. Grady, who has "earned" a starting position, has won matches against Pennsylvania and Cornell this year. 
Satisfied but confident of im­provement with a team mark of 31­17 against Corqell, Grady sees Van der Velden as truly impressive and "outstanding" thus far in the foil. 
Perhaps the strongest of the three squads this year is the sabre squad. Lead by junior captain Mike Janis, 
Mike Janis 
fourth place finish in the Great Lakes 
Tournament), has posted a S-0 
record this year. 
"Janis has been our number-one 
sabre man for two years," comments 
DeCicco, "and I believe he will con­
tinue to improve." 
To go along with his unbeaten 
record, Janis achieved a fourth place 
finish in the USFA Open. Finishing 
fifth was sophomore Don johnson. 
Johnson, who has notched a 5-2 
record this far into the season, was a 
remarkable 4-0 against Cornell as he 
fenced with a severe case of 
pneumonia. Johnson, who was ad­
mitted to the infirmary after that 
match, will probably miss the 
matches in Evanston this weekend. 
Also on the injured list is sopho­
more John Edwards, 1-0, who was 
last year's MVP in the sabre as a 
freshman, when he went 41-10. 
Picking up the slack is sophomore 
Tony Consoli, who has established 
an impressive 5-2 record thus far. 
Despite the injuries,Janis is happy with the performance of this squad and looks forward to good fortune for the Irish now and in the future. 
This year's epee squad is an ex­tremely young group lead by junior captain Andy Quaroni. The Irish, who lost three premier epeeist to graduation in Ola Harstrom, Rich Daly, and Jan Tivenius, will look to Quaroni to solidify this young squad and give them his experience. 
DeCicco believes that Quaroni, who has a 63-14 lifetime record and is undefeated thus far at S-0, has the skills to become Notre Dame's next national champion. 
Quaroni, who won the gold medal in the individual epee competition at the USFA Open, led his team to a fifth place finish in that tournament and an 11-5 trouncing of Cornell. 
Sophomore Brian St. Clair, in the number two position on the squad, finished sixth in the USFA Open and was 2-0 against Cornell. Freshman John Haugh, who also placed near the top in the open, went iLO against Cornell, also. 
Quaroni, who has been impressed the Irish sabre squad captured first place in the USFA Open by downing Penn State, S-4, last Saturday. 
janis, who has a 7';-21 career record ( 40-11 last year along with a with the efforts of this young squad which is primarily made up of un­derclassmen. credited Mike DeCic­co Jr. with the tlccisivc victory to clinch the Cornell match, which boosted the epee squad's record to 

1-1. 
Quaroni is confident of improve­ment throughout this year and com­mented, "We're ready for Northwestern (an opponent of the Irish over the weekend)." 
Overall, coach DeCicco, with his career record at 414-39, is optimis­tic about this year's team. 
"We have always prided ourselves in having outstanding depth," com­mented DeCicco. "This year will be no different. This squad has a lot of potential but we will have to wait 
until March to find out how we have developed." 

Andy Quaroni 
In March, the Irish will be opposed by stiff competition in the Great Lakes Championships on March 3 at Notre Dame and in the NCAA Championships March 20-21 at Princeton. They will be trying to match and surpass their 23-2 record last year and second place finish in the NCAA Championships. 

Mike DeCicco 
In the end, Notre Dame likely will be in the hunt for their third national :hampionship. 
First, however, the Irish must face Northwestern, Michigan State, and 'Minnesota this weekend in Evanston.

Although this was not a pro circuit

match, McEnroe fell flat on his back 
after pretending to collide with a 
hall boy. Ill: also very excitedly questioned calls of the umpire on several occasions, to the enjoyment of the crowd. 
When asked about his controver­sial behavior on the court.
