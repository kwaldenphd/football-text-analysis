Resburgh berates U.S. civil rights commission in address 
Associated Press 
NEW ORLEANS-Father 
Theodore Hesburgh, president of 
the University of Notre Dame and a 
former chairman of the U.S. Com­
mission on Civil Rights, says the 
commission today is a mere shadow 
of its powerful self in the 1960's. 
Hesburgh, 68, was appointed to the commission in 1957 and remov­ed in 1972. During those years, Congress passed landmark civil rights legislation that the commis­sion recommended. 
"We changed the face of America with those bills," Hesburgh said Monday. "I disagree with what the present commission has ac­complished, which is nil. We used to study things and report our fin­dings and conclusions. Now they're making findings and conclusions without studying anything." 
Hesburgh was in New Orleans to appear before the Notre Dame Club and to speak at Holy Cross School and St. Augustine High School. 

He said that the civil rights com­mission should be dismantled until a study can be made of procedures that might further civil rights. 
"I don't expect that during the Reagan administration," he said. ''The commission has been gutted, there's no leadership or the kind of integrity it should have." 
Hesburgh told his audience at the predominantly black St. Augustine High School that they must con­tinue the drive that was begun dur­ing the civil rights movement, when leaders such as the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. "walked-in and prayed-in and say-in and swung-in and got laws passed." 
As a result of their work"the number of black elected officials in this country has gone from six to more than 6,000. . . . People 10 years ago would have said this isn't hapening. It is happening and the country is moving forward," he said. 
Education is vital to that progress, Hesburgh said. 
"When you get a good education and you're willing to work," he said, ''you're bound to get a good job and some money to manuever with. Then you'll be able to move up to a better home and better education for your children." 
Hes.burgh, Notre Dame's presi­dent since 1952, is retiring next year. New Orleans was his last stop on his final presidential swing around the country to the Univer­sity's alumni clubs.

In Brief 
More money was raised by Notre Dame in 1984-85 than by any other university in Indiana, according to a survey con­ducted by the Council for Financial Aid to Education, which showed Notre Dame received more than $33.8 million from alum­ni, corporations and other individuals. Indiana University received about $31.9 million; Purdue, $18.1 million; Valparaiso, $5.9 million; and DePauw, $5.6 million. The survey showed Harvard University received the most financial donations of any university in the country with more than $145.6 million. -AP 
Dinosaur extinction occured gradually over millions of years, says Notre Dame geologist Keith Rigby Jr. Based on fossils he found last year in Montana, his theory will be published in the May 2 issue of Science, the weekly journal of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. According to Rigby, the dinosaur and pollen fossils indicate that the dinosaurs started to die off about 72 million years ago, some seven million years before an asteroid shower supposedly struck Earth and wiped out the dinosaur population." -The Observer 
Dry Rush is the word for next September at the University of Pittsburgh. The Intrafraternity Council oppo~ed the imposition of the alcohol-free rush, but the school's administration held firm. The administration presented statistics showing that, over the last five rushes, more people were attending fraternity parties, but fewer were signing up to join. Thus, they argued, the wet rushes don't work. -The Observer

"There is no question there will be a sizable dilution, there's tremendous mixing in the at­mosphere," said Kenneth Mossman, who directs Georgetown University Medical Center's pro­gram in radiation science in Washington, D.C. 
Charlie Porter, director of the Eastern Environmental Radiation Facility in Montgomery, Ala., said fallout detection stations in all 50 states will deliver data to his agen­cy, an arm of the federal En­vironmental Protection Agency. 
"We're calling all the station · operators and instructing them to begin taking daily samples," Porter said. Normally, readings are taken every three days. 
Porter said the EPA does not believe the cloud would be dangerous. But he said there is no way to be sure without knowing the scope of the Soviet accident. 
Gardner met with officials from the state's health, environment and emergency agencies to review steps the state could take in the event ab­normally high radiation levels reach the Northwest.

NorthWestern U.S. states prepare for Soviet fallout's weekend arrival 
Associated Press 
OLYMPIA, Wash. -Gov. Booth Gardner met with health of­ficials and radiation monitoring was stepped up yesterday as Washington state prepared for the weekend arrival of fallout from the Soviet nuclear accident. 
Experts said radioactivity from the power plant disaster, expected to appear over the northwestern United States as early as Saturday, would probably pose no health threat in the United States, nor in the Soviet Union outside the im­mediate area of the power want disaster. 
"In time it will get here, there's no question about that," said John Wallace, chairman of the Universi­ty of Washington Department of Atmospheric Science. "It could be any time, probably three or four days would be the minimum, and in any event it probably wouldn't take more than a week." 
Wallace said that by then, the radiation would be widely dispersed and "the differences between what we get here and what they'd experience in New York a day or so later wouldn't be that great."

tinuous monitoring of the situa­tion," said Gardner press aide Jim Kneeland. 
Filters on radiation monitors at the capital in Olympia, at Spokane and at the Hanford nuclear reserva­tion in eastern Washington were ordered changed daily instead of the usual once a week, officials said. 
Mossman said the type of radia­tion detected in the United States and elsewhere could provide clues as to the nature and scope of the Soviet accident. 
The Soviet Union said the acci~ dent had damaged an atomic reac­tor at the Chernobyl power plant in the Ukraine. Radiation as much as 10 times above normal was record­ed north of Stockholm, Sweden, and this included iodine and cesium compounds -both products of nuclear fission which would be pro­duced in uranium reactor fuel. 
Mossman and another expert, Richard Reba, who heads the divi­sion of nuclear medicine at George Washington University Medical Center, said the health risks to Soviet citizens might not be great even in a nearby population center such as Kiev, about I00 miles from the accident site. 
only 30 people were in attendance at this party, Scanlon said. 
According to Scanlon, approx­imately 12 policement arrived at his house at 11:15 p.m. Saturday, again taking pictures. "Everyone was on the porch or inside when the police came, (then) everyone ran," he said. 
"fhey barged into the house and searched the basement and the upstairs," Scanlon said. He added that one officer struck a student in the back with a flashlight and some students were "grabbed off the por­ch, no questions asked." 
Scanlon said he was fined $500 for exceeding the legal noise limit by 23 decibals. 
The office of South Bend Mayor Roger Parent announced that the mayor, a police department representative and the city attorney had scheduled a press conference in front of the Corby Street house this morning. The press conference was called to discuss the large parties held by students in the northeast neighborhood last weekend. 
Several students were arrested at the parties, mostly on charges of public intoxication. Their names could not be confirmed last night.

Indianapolis' pick was followed by the first surprise. St. Louis, which wanted Hand, took line.backer Anthony Bell of Michigan State. He had been pro­jected as a second-or third­rounder. 
Then came a pair of 300-pound offensive tackles Jim Dom­browski of Virginai, by New Orleans, and Brian Jozwiak of West Virginia, by Kansas City. 
Philadelphia took Byars, Cincin­nati took Washington linebacker Joe Kelly and the Detroit Lions grabbed Chuck Long of Iowa, the second quarterback of the first round.

By GLORIA ELEUTERI 
Sports Writer 
The Saint Mary's softball team, now 15-14, split its final two games against Notre Dame. The Belles fell 5-4 in the first game but bounc­ed back in the second game to win in five innings by a score of 11-1. 
The Belles led off the scoring in the third inning when Diane Schroder walked and scored on Mary Malina's base hit. 
In the fourth, the Irish tied the score when Jane Weldon walked and scored on an error. 
The fifth inning brought a total of five runs for Notre Dame. Mia Faust sigled and moved around the bases on a hit by Lynn Boyle. Weldon walked. Tammy Goodwin singled, and Barb Mooney added a single to drive in Boyle. On a single by Lynn McDermott, Weldon and Goodwin were driven home. 

The Belles began their rally when Schroeder reached first on an error. 
Trish Tierney singled to move Schroeder to second. Both vase runners advanced to second and third ona delayed steal. Amy Cuti singled to drive in Schroeder and Teirney scored next on an error. 
Katy Boldt's single drove in Cuti to close th gap to 5-4, but the Belles came up short as they dropped the opening game. 
The winning pitcher for the Irish was Barb Mooney. 
The bats were cracking early for the Belles in the second game, as Boldt led off the hitting with a single. Lorri White got to first on a fielders choice. Julie McNish tripl­ed to bring in Boldt and White. Next, Jeanette O'Neill reached first on am error which also allo"'ing McMish to score. 
Laura Danch and Cuti were driven home on a triple by Mary Malina. She was able to score on a Notre Dame error. 
These runs put the Belles in the lead, 7-0. Tierney reached base on an error and Malina sent her home on a single in the bottom of the fourth. Notre Dame's lone run came in the top of the fifth when Mooney singl­ed and scored on a sacrifice fly by Faust. 
The Belles were able to close the game early when they scored their ninth, lOth and 11th runs. Boldt score on a walk by Danch, McNish scored on a single by Kris Pantelleria and O'Neill scored on Tierney's single.

Dorsey, who joins the Giants Thursday, will be reunited with former Notre Dame tight end Mark Bavaro, New York's fourth-round choice last season, and is looking forward to that as well as showing the Giants what he can do on the field. 
"I'm not going to try and emulate any of their players," said Dorsey. "I've got my own style of football. I'm going to just try and fit in. "I am happy about joining Mark. We were close when he was here." 
But while Dorsey's first reaction

was one of surprise, Pinkett's initail reaction was one of relief. 
"I wasn't disappointed at all," said Pinkett about being selected in the third round. "It was a big relief. I just thank Houston for giving me the opportunity to play profes­sional football." 
But there was also an element of surprise for the native of Sterling, Va. The Oilers were unable to reach Pinkett before they made their an­nouncement official on cable televi­sion. 
"I found out on ESPN just like everyone else," he said. "I guess Houston didn't have my phone number so they weren't able to get in touch with me first." 
Pinkett is a three-time all-America slection who finished eighth in the Heisman Trophy voting as a senior in 1985 and 16th as a sophomore in 1983. He sur­passed Vegas Ferguson's record for all-time rushing yardage at Notre Dame, finishing with a total of 4,131 yards in his four-year career. He is also the all-time leading scorer in Irish history with 320 points. 
While some still question the im­pact Pinkett can make in the NFL with his 5-9, 181-pound frame, the senior looks forward to proving his critics wrong on a young Houston team.

Hail to the 1986 Chuckie award winners 
Hello again, everybody. 
Don King calls it an "extravaganza." David Letterman says it is a "fethtival." Stars from across the campus have turned out in droves for the 3rd. . . and the final. . . Chuckie awards. 
Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today to honor the best that Notre Dame athletics has had to offer us this year. So, without further ado, may I have the envelopes, please. 
OutstandinR Male Athlete. 
The nominees, in alphabetical order are. 
Jerry Durso, wrestling-The freshman 134-pounder from West Millington, N.J. was named to the first team of Amateur Wrestling News' all-freshman squad. He set an Irish record for most wins by a freshman and tied the record for most wins in a season. 
John McNelils, Rob Nobles, Jim Tyler, and Jef Van Wie, track-This quartet finished thired in the NCAA 
two-mile relay and earned all-American status. At one time, they held the record for the fastest indoor two-mile relay. 
Yehuda Kovacs, fencing-This freshman made the ad­justment to life at Notre Dame very well, thank you. Kovacs finished second in the NCAA foil competition and was a major factor in Notre Dame's national cham­pionship season. 
Allen Pinkett, football-What a brilliant career for this great running back. He gained 1100 yards last season to become Notre Dame's all-time leading rusher. It's just too bad he never got the chance to play in a major bowl. 
David Rivers, basketball-Another exciting year for the Irish point guard, as he led the team back to the NCAA tournament. The team leader in scoring and assists will be back next year. 
And the winner is . . .Allen Pinkett. After four years, he deserves a lot more than a Chuckie, but it's the best we cando. 
Outstanding Female Athlete 
Andrea Bonny, swimming-A sophomore from Colum-


Chuck Freeby 
Irish Items 
bus, Ohio, she became the first Irish diver to qualify for the NCAA tournament. She also excelled in the classroom, posting a 3.94 grade point while majoring in biology. 
Patti Gallagher, field hockey-The senior goalie set a school record, collecting 225 saves for the Irish. She was one of the keys to Notre Dame's successful12-8-2 record this year. 
Trena Keys, basketball-Find an all-time list in any category for women's basketball and she's on it. The six­foot senior from Marion, Ind. became the team's all­time leading scorer and led Notre Dame to its first season tournament. 
Molly Sullivan, fencing-The words "NCAA champion" say it all. She earned All-America honors last year, but managed to go all_ the way to the top in only her sophomore season. 
And the winner is ...Just could not break the tie here. The Chuckie goes to Trena Keys and Molly Sullivan. Team of the Year .. 
Basketball, men's-Okay, forget for just a moment about the Little Rock game. Think about games like Syracuse and Marquette. Think about the excitement that was generated _at the ACC. It was a memorable season, and one that deserves recognition. 
Basketball, women's-The best season in the team's Division I history. Mary Di's squad rolled to the cham­pionship of the North Star Conference and finished third in the Women's NIT. 
Fencing, men's and women's-Mike DeCicco and Co. br­ing home the first national championship since the fencers won in 1978. Meanwhile, first-year coach Yves Auriol led the women's squad to a runner-up finish. That 
kind of one-two punch makes this decision easy. 
The winner is . . . The Notre Dame fencing teams. 
Coach of the Year . . . 
Mike DeCicco, fencing-In his 25 years at Notre Dame, 
DeCicco has put together a phenomenal .923 winning 
percentage, He is third among all Irish coaches in career 
wins and only Rockne and Leahy have won more na­
tional championships. 
Tom Fallon, men's tennis-In his 30th year of coaching 
the Irish netters, Fallon was honored as "Coach of the 
Year" in the Midwestern Collegiate Conference this spr­
ing. He needs only three wins to pass Jake Kline and 
become the winningest coach in Notre Dame history. 
And the winner is ...Mike DeCicco. 
Finally, some of the best lines of the year: 
Lou Holtz -"I'm concerned with our pass rush. Last year, either the quarterback got the pass off or the quarter ended." 
Larry Gallo, baseball coach-"We're just in a slump right 
now. It's like we're bobbing for apples without any 
teeth." 

Lefty Smith, hockey coach-"He skates well, but it's all in one place." 
Eddie White, assistant sports information director on 
his Bookstore opener-"I'm just glad we didn't play a 
team with a hyphen in its name." 
Joseph Price, on teammate Tim Kempton-"When he would lose the ball, you'd see all those hands go up in the air. He scored more touchdowns than Allen Pinkett." 
And last and certainly least. .. 
Chuck Freeby, sports writer -"Thank you" to all the copy editors and layout people who try and make me look good, to the people who gave me information for the column, and most importantly, to all of you who have read the column. Although it's usually not worth the newsprint it is printed on, I hope you have enjoyed the column anyway. 
"Goodbye (again and for the last time), everybody."
