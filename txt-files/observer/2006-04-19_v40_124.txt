ND ranked high for Hispanic students 
By KAREN LANGLEY 
Associate News Editor 
A premier Hispanic American magazine ranked Notre Dame No. 13 on its 2006 listing of the "Top 25 Colleges for Latinos" 
the fourth time the University has achieved a berth on the rankings since their debut in 1999. 
Hispanic Magazine's March issue featured the ranking, which is based upon each school's academic excellence, student-to-faculty ratio, per­centages of Hispanic faculty and students, cultural pta­grams and availability of finan­cial aid, among other factors. 
University President Father 

SMCgives honorary diplo111as 
Philanthropist, judges top list of recipients 
By KELLY MEEHAN 
Saint Mary's Editor 
Longtime philanthropist MaryAnn Mathile and renowned judges Denise Cote and Ann Claire Williams comprise the 2006 recipient pool of Saint Mary's honorary degrees, which will be awarded during the College's May 20 commencement ceremony. 
Executive Assistant to the President Susan Dampeer said the recipients are a "great group of amazing women" who serve as examples for what she hopes Saint Mary's students can become. 
"Not only have each of these women reached a pinnacle of perfecting their careers, they are really committed to serve and understand the needs of our pop­ulation," Dampeer said. 
Mathile, a generous philanthro­pist from Dayton, Ohio, has focused her efforts on the Mathile Family Foundation, which was established in 1989 to give hope and change in the lives of needy children and families. Today the Foundation benefits Mercy Manor, Womanline and Catholic Social Services of the Miami Valley. 
Dampeer said Mathile -who specializes in hands-on volunteer work offered up to God -is an "extraordinarily generous woman who has a deep love for the College." Mathile's admiration for the College grew from her daugh­ter's positive experiences while attending Saint Mary's, Dampeer said.

John J enkiri.s noted Notre 
Dame's strong appeal to 
Hispanics in his .Oct. 11 
address to the faculty. Jenkins 
said that compared to other top 
20 universities, Notre Dame 
has had better-than-average 
growth in Hispanic faculty and 
student body. 
Assistant Provost for 
Admissions Dan Saracino said 
such growth is promising, but 
in itself insufficient. 
"[Growth) should be excel­lent," he said. "And we're not there yet. Notre Dame, as an outstanding Catholic university, ·should be a great place for Hispanic scholars and students whose faith is important to 
them." 
Hispanic students currently 
comprise nine percent of the undergraduate student body, and Saracino said the Office of Admissions hopes 11 percent of the incoming freshman class will be Hispanic. The recent admissions decisions resulted in the acceptance of 443 of the 1,199 Hispanic applicants, he said. 
The Office of Admissions employs counselors to work specifically with underrepre­sented ethnic minority stu­dents, including Hispanic, African-American, Asian­American and Native American students. Saracino noted the special need to improve recruitment of African­American, Asian-American and Native American students. 

"I believe we can still be suc­cessful in recruiting [these stu­dents]," he said. "We just need to work harder." 
Notre Dame's Catholic affilia­tion gives Hispanics a "natural affinity" to the University, Saracino said. He added that though fewer African­American and Asian-American families are specifically Catholic, Notre Dame can still reach out to the religious nature of many of these fami­lies. 
Saracino said Notre Dame's appeal to Hispanic applicants . has increased significantly over the past 10 years. He noted the increasing number of

Braun named leprechaun

News Writer 

As the Notre Dame community antici­pates this weekend's Blue-Gold game, junior Kevin Braun has special reason to get pumped. Braun was selected as the newest Gold squad leprechaun April 7 and will appear on the Irish sidelines next season. 
Those students setting sites on carrying the luck of the Irish to athletic teams must endure a rigorous try-out process. Clinics began March 28, and after trim­ming the original field of 11, six lep­rechaun prospects performed in front of judges April 7. 
Judges ranged from head cheerleading coach, Jonette Minton, to representativ.es from the athletic directors office, academ­

CLAP vvill hold fofUlll to discuss living wage 
By MARY KATE MALONE 
News Editor 

As part of their ongoing pursuit of a living wage for campus workers, members of the Campus Labor Action Project (CLAP) will hold a forum tonight to discuss the economic benefits of increas­ing the hourly pay for work­ers on campus. 
The forum, at 8 p.m. in the Montgomery Room of LaFortune, will feature eco~ nomics professor Teresa Ghilarducci, who will speak on the economic feasibility of the University paying its employees a living wage -a practice Harvard, Georgetown and Stanford have already started. 
"[The forum] will focus on how [the living wage] makes economic sense, both for workers and for employers 
and how economic research backs up the need for a living wage especially here at Notre Dame," CLAP lead organizer Kamaria Porter said Tuesday. 
Porter said members of CLAP and perhaps campus workers themselves will also speak at the forum. 
"Our goal is to gain some more support and continue to persuade the University to consider adjusting the living wage," she said. 
On March 8, CLAP members delivered an 11-page report to top University administra­tors that called for Notre Dame to implement a $12.10 hourly wage for workers. The report also asked for the cre­ation of a joint task force ­made up of campus workers, students, administrators and possibly alumni -that would examine the issue from all

"His career at Notre Dame demonstrates the importance of the visual arts to complete a liberal arts education," Doordan said. "Hobert Leader is an excellent example of how a particular area [of study) like the arts con­tributes to the larger goal or mission of the University." 
While Leader taught various art studio classes at the University, Flanigan said his most memorable course was Art Traditions, an introduc­tion to world art that enrolled more than 300 students in each section. 
And Leader taught not one, but two sections per semester. 

"It was his charisma and abilities as a lecturer that drove that course," art histo­ry professor Charles Rosenberg said. "He took on an enormous amount of work. He had no graduate assis­tants, he graded every exam himself ...

units, Turtle Creek community manager Tammie Schmuhl said. Other interior changes detailed on the apartment complex's Web site included the remodeling of cabinets in the units, and the addition of new carpeting and fresh coats of paint in common area hall­ways. There will also be many . exterior modifications ranging from painting the buildings, replacing exterior doors, changing the signage throughout the complex, land­scaping improvement and new grills and picnic tables around the pool area. 
Schmuhl said the changes are part of a long-term plan created by AIMCO University Communities after the compa­ny purchased the property in 2004. 
"Remodeling is something we do whenever we purchase a property, basically to make it a better place to live," she said. 
Renovations at Turtle Creek began last year with costs totaling $580,000, and will be continued throughout 2006, Schmuhl said. She said the total cost of revamping the complex will be $1,164,000 when the work is completed. However, the cost of redoing Turtle Creek will not affect rental rates for next year, she said, because the rates have already been set. 
"We're just trying to improve the property," she said, "At this point we want to make it the best it can be for everyone that lives here." 
Due to its close proximity to Notre Dame's. campus, Turtle Creek has traditionally been a popular option for off-campus living among students. Schmuhl said she "certainly hopes" students continue to consider Turtle Creek "the best place in South Bend to live" after the renovations are completed, due to its close­ness to campus and the vari­ous amenities the complex offers its tenants, she said. 
"Students deserve the best of everything and that's what they're going to get," she said. 
Since many of the residents at Turtle Creek are students, the complex has become known for having a strong social life -a factor that attracts some students to Turtle Creek while causing others to avoid it. 
Saint Mary's junior Meggie Wehmer said she considered living at Turtle Creek because it has a reputation for being "a fun place to live where there is always something going on socially." However, she said after taking into account various options she chose to rent a house with several of her girlfriends. 
"I decided to live in a house because I wanted something that would be more quiet," she said. "It gives me the chance to live with my friends in a house, who knows when and if I will get to do that again."

Tourist bus plunges off cliff, 57 dead 
VERACRUZ, Mexico -An overcrowded bus speeding home from a religious festival veered off a highway emergency ramp and crashed through a metal barrier, plunging more than 650 feet into a ravine. Fifty-seven people were killed, including a 13-year-old boy. 
Just three people survived Monday's plunge from the highway, considered one of the 15 most dangerous in Mexico. Two were in criti­cal condition and one, an 8-year-old girl, was stable, according to Sanatorio Escudero, the hospital in Orizaba where the injured were taken. 
Ranulfo Marquez, deputy director of civil pro­tection for Veracruz state, said the girl was conscious but had sun·ered multiple fractures. 
The bus, equipped to hold 46 passengers, was carrying 60, some of whom were stand­ing. 
Clashes break out in Sunni district 
BAGHDAD. Iraq -Clashes persisted for a second day Tuesday in a Sunni district of Baghdad between Iraqi forces and what appeared to be local militiamen who feared that Shiite death squads had infil­trated the community. 
U.S. and Iraqi troops sealed off streets to the Azamiyah district, and residents reported the area appeared quiet after clerics broadcast appeals for calm over loudspeakers from the main Sunni mosque. At least 13 people died in the two days of fighting, Iraqi officials said. 
There were conflicting reports about what triggered the clashes, which under­scored the rising tensions between Shiite and Sunni Muslim communities that threaten to plunge Iraq into civil war.

One of those released was Patrick Alan Selepak, who is now charged with killing three people after he was wrongly freed. 
Corrections Department Director Patricia Caruso told the Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday that systemic and individual errors led to the releases. 
NYC transit union accepts contract 
NEW YORK -Bus and subway workers who shut down the nation's largest transit system with a three-day strike in December voted Tuesday to accept the same contract they had previously reject­ed. 
Of 20,593 votes cast, 14,716 were in favor of the contract, said Roger Toussaint, president of the Transport Workers Union Local 100. 
Toussaint urged the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to accept the union's decision, though the MTA has said it wouldn't have to accept any new vote. 
The union narrowly rejected the same contract in January, and the dispute between the 33,000-member union and MTA went into binding arbitration with a state labor board in March.

Family, school district settle lawsuit 
MISHAWAKA, Ind. -A family that sued the city's school district alleging that a former teacher had inappropriately touched their then­12-year-old daughter has settled the lawsuit for $131,675 to be paid over the next 12 years. 
The girl told authorities that former Liberty Elementary teacher Mark Gardner molested her while she was at his house and during a school field trip in 2004. A St. Joseph Superior Court jury acquitted Gardner last week of two counts of child molesting. 
Duke lacrosse players arrested 
Finnerty and Seligmann face rape and kidnap charges; posted $400,000 bails 
Associated Press 
DURHAM, N.C. -Two Duke University lacrosse players were arrested early Tuesday on charges of rap­ing and kidnapping a strip­per hired to dance at an off­campus party, and the dis­trict attorney said he hopes to charge a third person soon. 
The indictments, unsealed Tuesday, did not indicate what led the grand jury Monday to indict Reade Seligmann, 20, and Collin Finnerty, 19. District Attorney Mike Nifong would not discuss the evidence. 
"It had been my hope to charge all three of the assailants at the same time, but the evidence available to me at this moment does not permit that," Nifong said. "Investigation into the identi­ty of the third assailant will continue in the hope that he can also be identified with certainty." 
Seligmann posted a $400,000 bond shortly after his arrest, and his attorney waived his court appear­ance. 
Finnerty, who posted the same amount later Tuesday, made a brief appearance in Superior Court wearing a jacket and tie. The next court appearance for both players was set for May 15.

Notre Dame's success in recruiting underrepresented minorities has also grown as a result of the University's 19<JH decision to meet 100 percent of students' finan­cial aid, Saracino said. 
"If a student is outstanding enough to gain admission ­no matter what thnir race, ethnidty or soeio-econornic background -wn can make it happen," he said.

ic services, student activities, alumni and a former lep­rechaun. 
Each prospective leprechaun performed a sequence he designed to open the first foot­ball pep rally this fall. Candidates also acted out game situations and participated in mock media interviews. As a test of physical fitness, each hopeful also had to perform a number of traditional game push-ups -and according to Minton, not all made it. 
"This year they had to do 50, and some collapsed before fin­ishing," she said. 
The final test is a 15-minute individual interview, in which judges look to see "if the candi­date has the right heart to be the person who represents Notre Dame," Minton said. 
The leprechaun was named Notre Dame's official mascot in 1965. Before the reign of the leprechaun, a series of Irish terrier dogs nicknamed Clashmore Mike served as mascots after Knute Rockne was first presented one in 1930. 
While the dogs presided over some of Notre Dame football's days of glory, the live version of today's Fighting Irish mascot "brandishes a shillelagh and aggressively leads cheers and interacts with the crowd, sup­posedly bringing magical pow­ers and good luck to the Notre Dame team," according to the university's official athletic site. 
The candidate with the high­est number of points becomes the Gold squad leprechaun ­the familiar face at football and men's basketball games. But the second highest scorer earns the position of Blue squad leprechaun, who is responsible for cheering on women's basketball, soccer and volleyball. 
This year's Gold squad lep­rechaun is Braun, a computer scienee major residing in Dillon Hall. A Landisville, Penn. native and natural redhead standing 5-foot-9, Braun has dreamed of 'brandishing the shillelagh' since freshman year. 
"Though I've followed ND sports since I was a young boy, I've wanted to be the lep­rechaun since freshman year, when Dillon guys sitting near me in the stadium recommend­ed it," Braun said. "I've always had a penchant for going nuts during football games." 
As for this fall, Braun plans to eontinue Notre Dame tradi­tions while introducing his own twists. 
"I hope to bring baek Irish dominance inside Notre Dame Stadium, and will ineorporate the eheers and enthusiasm from past lepreehauns, while trying to add my own wrinkles and get the 'Here come the Irish' cheer echoing through the Stadium again," Braun said. 
As the end of his mock pep rally try-out segment, Braun started up the 'Here Come the Irish' chant and planted the Notre Dame flag in the center of the pit. 
He said he plans to plant the flag as the cheerleaders run out of the tunnel at the home opening Penn State game. 
Braun has been auditioning all year long, according to Minton, as he has led the Blue cheerleading squad since the fall. As for what set him apart from the competition, Minton said, "his experience helped a lot, but also his electric enthu­siasm for Notre Dame. He comes out there with this pres­ence, he knows how to teaeh people to respond, and I think he'll be awesome." 
She's also confident in his 
game voice. 

"He's also terrific on the microphone -he did a great job with that at women's bas­ketball games," Minton said. ''I've seen him candid at pep rallies, and he just picks right up." 
Equally enthused about Braun is new Blue squad lep­rechaun, Juan Muldoon. 
"Kevin Braun is an awesome guy and he has helped me learn the ropes every step of the way," Muldoon said. 
A current freshman from Siegfried Hall, Muldoon hails from Mexico City. Muldoon said support from friends and fami­ly has been crucial to his achievement. While his room­mate helped Muldoon lift weights to ensure he could squeeze in the 50th push-up, Muldoon's family offered encouragement. 
"Of eourse now they are all very excited to see the very first Mexican leprechaun don the green cap and rally the Irish on." Muldoon said. 
Measuring "a solid five feet flat (plus an inch on a good day)," as he puts it, and pos­sessing "the lucky beard and the enthusiasm of the truest leprechaun you'II ever see." Muldoon promises his heart to be Irish "through and through." 
An Irish heart is a character­istic both new leprechauns claim to possess and one that the job requires. And while being the mascot places a number of demands on an already full-time student, Braun said he feels the rewards are much greater than the costs. 
"I cannot wait to be the face of Notre Dame next year, and get chills thinking about run­ning out of the tunnel in front of 80,000 this fall," he said.

IN BRIEF 
Hfth lbird first quarter profits decline 
CINCINNATI -Fifth Third Bancorp said Tuesday that first-quarter earnings declined 10 percent from a year ago, mainly because of a decline in net interest income. 
Earnings were $363 million, or 65 cents a share, in the quarter ended March 31 compared with $405 million, or 72 cents a share, a year ago. Revenue was $1.34 billion, compared with $1.37 billion in the first quarter of 2005. 
Analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial expect­ed the company to earn 64 cents per share, on rev­enue of $1.35 billion. 
Fifth Third's interest income fell 5 percent in the quarter from $759 million to $718 million. 
Fifth Third has assets of $105 billion and oper­ates more than 1,100 branches in Ohio, Kentucky, Indiana, Michigan, Illinois, Florida, Tennessee, West Virginia, Pennsylvania and Missouri. 
Banks tend to benefit when short-term rates are low and long-term rates are high. But the yield curve, which maps interest rates from short-to longer-term, has been flat or inverted over past months. 

Johnson & Johnson earnings increase 
TRENTON, N.J. -Johnson & Johnson's first­quarter profit jumped 17 percent, mainly due to a big termination fee from its failed attempt to acquire heart-device maker Guidant Corp., while revenue was hurt by generic competition from some former blockbuster drugs. 
The world's most diversified health products maker on Tuesday reported net income grew to $3.31 billion, or $1.10 per share, from $2.84 bil­lion, or 94 cents per share, a year ago. 
The results included a termination fee, worth $622 million, or 12 cents per share, paid by Indianapolis-based Guidant after it accepted Boston Scientific Corp.'s takeover bid instead of J&J's earli­er in the quarter. Johnson & Johnson's results also included a 3-cent charge for stock options given to employees, an expense corporations must begin reporting this quarter. A year ago, J&J's stock options also amounted to 3 cents per share. 
Excluding those charges and a 1 cent-per-share charge for acquisitions, Johnson & Johnson's income would have been $2.97 billion, or 99 cents per share, for the latest quarter. That beat by a penny the consensus forecast of analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial. 

Oil prices settle at record high 
Market hits $71 per barrel despite OPEC forecast of weakening global demand 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON Oil prices settled at a new high above $71 a barrel Tuesday as supply threats around the world overshadowed a new report from OPEC forecast­ing weakening global demand. 
There was no fresh cata­lyst for Tuesday's buying, but analysts said the market psy­chology would likely remain bullish until there is some resolution to a variety of geopolitical uncertainties, particularly the West's nuclear dispute with Iran and output disruptions in Nigeria. 
Global Insight oil analyst Kevin Lindemer said the slowing consumption growth and swelling inventories of crude oil in the United States would typically help pull down prices, but "all of that is getting swamped right now by Iran and Nigeria." 
Light, sweet crude for May delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange rose as high as $71.60 a barrel, sur­passing the previous intraday record of $70.85 set Aug. 30. Oil settled at $71.35, an increase of 95 cents from Monday's record closing price.

It's the first child for Holmes, 
27. Cruise, 43, has an adopted daughter and son from his mar­riage to Nieole Kidman. 
Details surrounding the birth, which was planned under the tenets of the Church of Scientology as a silent procedure, weren't diselosed. 
Scientologists believe words spoken during times of pain are recorded by the "reactive mind" and can potentially eause prob­lems for mother and baby later in life. 
A spokesman from the Church of Scientology International declined comment and referred inquiries to Cruise's publicist. 

Ironically, Suri was born the same day as Brooke Shields' newborn daughter, Grier Hammond 1-Ienchy. 
Shields and Cruise had a public spat last year after he criticized the actress for taking antidepres­sants following the birth of her first child. 
Appearing on the "Today" show, Cruise said there was no sueh thing as chemical imbal­ances that need to be corrected with drugs, and that depression could be treated with exereise and vitamins.

Passport changes lllade

WASHINGTON -The Bush administration said Tuesday it still plans to require passports from all foreigners entering the United States by the end of next year, despite calls for a delay by some Republicans worried about strained relations with Canada. 
At issue is a 2004 law, being phased in over three years, to tighten U.S. borders against sus­
pected terror­ists and other criminals. But critics on both sides of the nation's north­ern border fear the passport requirement will hamper commerce and tourism between Canada and the

work with the law as it currently exists," Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff said after a meeting with Canadian Public Safety Minister Stockwell Day. "I think it's a deadline we can meet." 
Asked whether the U.S. would be ready with new technology and staffing demands to handle the stricter inspections by Dec. 31, 2007, Chertoff said: "It seems to me way premature to raise the flag of defeat when I think we have ample precedent and ample ability to meet the deadline." 
But some border-state Republicans, including Sen. Norm Coleman of Minnesota, question whether the Homeland Security Department will have the neces­sary tools in time. Some have called for delaying the program for up to 18 months. 
Day stopped short of critici~ing the program, but said Canada was watching to see whether the 
U.S. will be ready. 
"We want to evaluate what they're doing," Day, standing next to Chertoff, told U.S. and Canadian reporters in Washington. "Obviously I raised concerns, some of the same ques­tions that you raised, in terms of: Is it feasible? Those are concerns of interest, those are concerns

Day said his country is not con­sidering similar cards for Canadian citizens, and would con­tinue to require identification such as a driver's license and birth certificate for northbound border crossers.

Germany decides to open records 
Holocaust survivors, relatives hope previously sealed archives will reveal fate ofloved ones 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON After decades of holding back, Germany took a major step Tuesday toward opening Nazi records on 17 million Jews, slave laborers and other lloloeaust victims to historians and relatives long anxious for conelusivn information about thnir fate. 
Germany pledged to work with the Unitnd States to ensure the opening of the archives, which are housed in the German town Bad Arolsen. Eleven nations oversee the 30 million to 50 million documents and are to meet in Luxembourg next month to consider amend­ing a 1955 treaty that has, niTnctively, limitnd access and eopying. 
"Wn still have negotiations to do," the American spneial envoy for Ilolocaust issues, Edward B. O'Donnell, said in an interview. "Our goal is to reach an agrne­ment as soon as possible." 

Approval in Luxembourg would require agreement by all 11 countries. The parliaments of several of the countries would have to give their approval, as well. 
At a news conference Tuesday at the U.S. Holocaust Museum, German Justice Minister Brigitte Zypries said her country would work with the United States on opening the archives. Until now, Germany has resisted, citing privacy concerns. 
In Jerusalem, Holocaust spe­cialist Shlomo Aharonson, a his­torian at Hebrew University, said, "They have shown good will but that doesn't mean the problem has been solved." 
Aharonson said the archives are supposed to contain all the names of' those who died in World War II, both Jews and non-Jews. 
The announcement by Zypries culminated a 20-year 
effort by the Holocaust Museum, the United States, France, Poland and some other countries to pry the archives open. 
Negotiations intensified in the past four or five years and took on even greater momentum in the past two years, said Arthur Berger, spokesman for the museum. 
In a meeting Tuesday with museum director Sarah Bloomfield, Zypries said Germany had changed its posi­tion and would immediately seek revision of the accord gov­erning the archives. The process should take no more than six months, the minister said. 
Opening the archives would enable many survivors and families of victims of the Nazis to find out with more certainty than ever before what hap­pened to their relatives. 
"We are losing the survivors, and anti-Semitism is on the rise so this move could not be more timely," Bloomfield said in an interview. 

She said the move was "something of moral and histor­ical importance in a critical time." 
"Overall, it makes it possible to learn a lot more about the fate of individuals and to learn a lot more about the llolocaust itself-concentration camps, deportations, slave-enforced labor and displaced persons," Paul Shapiro, director of the museum's center for advanced Holocaust studies, said in a sep­arate interview. 
Spealting in German, Zypries said, "We now agree to open the data in Bad Arolsen in Germany. We now assume the data will be safeguarded by those countries that copy the material and use it, and now that we have made this decision we want to move forward." Iter remarks were translated into English for reporters.

Man kills 
3 vvo111en 
G.unman concludes rampage with suicide 
Associated Press 

ST. LOUIS -A man killed the 
mother of his child Tuesday, 
then went to the catering com­
pany where he once worked 
and fatally shot two women 
and himself, police said. 

One other woman was shot 
at Finninger's Catering Service 
and was in stable condition, 
police said. 

Among the dead was an 
owner of the company, but her 
elderly husband and business 
partner may have been saved 
by a quick-thinking employee 
who hid him in a walk-in cool­
er as the rampage unfolded. 
Police said Ilerbnrt Chalmers 
Jr. killed 53-year-old Sylvia 
Ilaynes at her apartment 
Tuesday morning. llours later, 
he was overheard bragging 
about plans to kill his boss, 
then went to the catering com­
pany. 

Chalmers and Ilaynes had a child together, but the state of their relationship was unclear Tuesday, police said. 
One of the women killed was 79-year-old Cleo Finninger, who ran the company with. her husband, Charles, said Susan Akscin, the woman's niece. The other was their adult daughter, 44-year-old Christine Politte, who oversaw payroll, authori­ties said. The company is on the northwest edge of St. Louis and employs about 50 people. 
Both women were shot in a garage area, police said. The shooter killed himself in the parking lot. 
Police and co-workers described Chalmers as a dis­gruntled former employee. Some workers said that he may have been angered after being told his wages would be gar­nisheed for child support, and that he may have been fired after failing to show up for work a day earlier. 
Employee Colette Meissner said she was in the kitchen when she heard shots and the gunman screaming the names of people he intended to kill. 
He shouted "Charlie," refer­ring to Charles Finninger, Meissner said. The elderly owner was in a wheelchair, and Meissner pushed him into a walk-in cooler. 
They huddled with another employee and listened as Chalmers kept shooting, Meissner said. 
"I shut the door and we all stood in there and prayed," she said. "We were scared to death." 
The employees who were killed were fleeing with other workers out the back of the shop, police said. 
Chalmers was overheard in a Wal-Mart store bragging that he planned to shoot his boss, Brown said. Wal-Mart employ­ees told police. 
Shots were being fired at the catering company as police arrived about 1:30 p.m., Brown said. Chalmers was using a semiautomatic handgun, authorities said. 
Employee Dawn Flowers, still wearing her red apron, cried as she recalled seeing Chalmers enter through a rear door carrying a duffel bag and a coat over his arm. She believed the coat was hiding the gun.

NEPAL 
Nepalis oppose King 
Demonstrators protest in favor ofdemocracy 
Associated Press 
KATMANDU -With defiance of royal rule spreading, security forces fatally shot a fifth protest­er Monday while King Gyanendra searched for a way out of a crisis that has plunged the Himalayan land into its worst turmoil since he seized absolute power 14 months ago. 
Twelve days of often-bloody pro-democracy protests and a general strike have emptied Nepal's highways, leaving cities short of fresh food and fuel. At one Katmandu hotel, the dinner menu was scribbled on a pink post-it note. 
A convoy guarded by arlllored army vehicles headed toward the capital Tuesday with salt, fruits and vegetables, cooking fuel and gasoline -the first batch of supplies and passengers to head for Katmandu in nearly two weeks. 
Protesters tried to stop the convoy on Monday but soldiers opened fire, wounding at least five. 
A statement issued by the Hoyal Nepalese Army said the soldiers were compelled to open fire as the mob tried to set fuel tankers on fire and attacked people in the convoy. 
Thousands of protesters ram­paged on Katmandu's outskirts Monday, blocking roads with burning barricades and hurling bricks at police. Officers responded with tear gas, rubber bullets and baton charges. 
"We will hang Gyanendra over flames -the king will burn!" Arjun Prasad, 22, declared as he stood near a flaming pile of tires. 
In Nijgadh, 75 miles south of Katmandu, thousands of people were marching through town when security forces opened ftre with live ammunition, killing one protester and wounding five, a local official said. The death was the fifth caused by security forces in recent days. 
The five wounded protesters were hospitalized with serious injuries, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to reporters. 
Since the opposition campaign began April 6, daily protests have hit nearly every city and town in this I Iindu kingdom. 
Ordinary Nepalis have joined the rallies alongside the usual cast of students and political activists. Lawyers, doctors and even the disabled have organ­ized their own demonstrations. 
The king appeared to be seri­ously considering relinquishing at least some of the power he seized when he closed parlia­ment in February 2005 -a move he said was needed to restore order and crush a com­munist insurgency that has killed nearly 13,000 people over the past decade. 
A palace official said Gyanendra met on Monday with two former prime ministers ­Krishna Prasad Bhattarai and 
Suraya Bahadur Thapa  - to  
explore  the  possibility  of  
appointing a prime minister.  

The official agreed to discuss the meeting only if he was not identified.

Judge rules on consent 
Doctors not required to report underage sex 
Associated Press 

WICHITA, Kan. -In a victo­ry for an abortion rights group, a federal judge ruled Tuesday that abortion clinic doctors and other profession­als are not required under Kansas law to report under­age sex between consenting youths. 
The ruling by U.S. District Judge J. Thomas Marten was a setback for Kansas Attorney 
General Phil! Kline,  an  abor­ 
tion foe.  
Kline  contended  a  1982  

Kansas law requiring doctors, teachers and others to alert the state and law enforcement about potential child abuse covers consensual sex between minors. He argued that the law applies to abor­tion clinics, and later extend­ed that to other health profes­sionals and t1~achers. 
The Center for Heproductive Hights challenged that inter­protation in court, and the judge sided with the organiza­tion. Kline said he had not decided whether to appeal. 
"It's not unexpected," Kline said. "It's what we've been predicting." 
Marten ruled that a plain reading of the Kansas law gives health care providers discretion to determine whether there is reason to suspect a child has been injured as a result of sexual abuse. 
The attorney general's office had contended the law required mandatory reporting because sex is inherently harmful to underage children. In Kansas, the age of consent is 16. 
Health professionals must be able to work in confidence to appropriately treat young patients, the judge wrote. 
"This case certainly is not about promoting sexual promiscuity among underage persons," he wrote. "Each and every witness testified that underage sex should be dis­couraged. No witness suggest­ed that sexual intercourse under the age of 12 should not be reported." 
The law "recognizes that sexual activity among under­age persons occurs, and that any such activity that injures the minor will be reported," the judge wrote. 
Simon Heller, attorney for the Center for Heproductive Hights, called the ruling an important victory for young people. 
"It is the first ruling recog­nizing the United States Constitution gives protection -constitutional protection ­to the informational privacy rights of young people in health care," Heller said. 
The center sued in 2003 on behalf of a group of obstetri­cians and gynecologists, nurs­es, psychologists, social work­ers, a family practice doctor, and a sex education teacher. Named as defendants were Kline and Sedgwick County prosecutor Nola Foulston, as representative of all county and district attorneys in Kansas. 
Foulston had no comment Tuesday, a spokeswoman said.

Palestinian official forced to cancel visit 
Associated Press 
AMMAN -Jordan accused Hamas activists of smuggling missiles and other weapons into the kingdom and said Tuesday it was canceling a planned visit of the Palestinian foreign minister -the second diplomatic snub for the Hamas-led government in a week. 
Palestinian Foreign Minister Mahmoud Zahar's visit to Jordan, which was planned for Wednesday, had been "put off until further notice," a Jordanian government spokesman said. 
On Friday, Zahar went to Cairo, but Egyptian Foreign Minister Ahmed Aboul Gheit said he was too busy for a meeting. 
The Jordanian spokesman, Nasser Judeh, told The Associated Press that "missiles, explosives and automatic weapons were seized in the last couple of days." Hamas activists had managed to smuggle "such dangerous weapons into the country" and store them, he said. 
He would not say whether the activists had been arrested. 
Osama Hamadan, a spokesman for Hamas, declined to comment on Judeh's remarks, saying late Tuesday he had not seen the 
Jordanian statement. 

In a separate statement to the official Petra news agency, Judeh said Jordanian security services had observed Hamas activists "exploring several vital (potential) targets" in the capital, Amman, and other cities. He did not elaborate. 
State television quoted Judeh as saying the discovery of the arms cache proved that "Hamas is using two languages in dealing with Jordan." 
Jordan, which signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994, maintains a tough line on mili­tants and once expelled the current leader of Hamas, Khaled Mashaal, for his activi­ties. 
Jordan and Egypt have called on Hamas to accept the Arab peace plan, which entails full recognition of Israel in exchange for full withdrawal from territory captured in the 1967 and 1973 Arab-Israeli wars. 
Hamas refuses to recognize Israel. 
Hamas officials have been flying around the Middle East to ask for aid, although it was not immediately clear whether that was the purpose of Wednesday's trip. Hamas is hoping for help to compensate for the U.S. and European Union's decisions to cut off funds to the Palestinian Authority because of the mili­tant group's refusal to renounce violence and recog­nize Israel.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Open letter to the University community 
Dear faculty colleagues, staff and stu­dents: 
The recent "closing statement" of our President Father John Jenkins has elicit­ed an impressive number of positive responses on campus, and that must seem reassuring in many quarters of the University. But I am bound to confess that both the statement itself, and the early responses that welcomed it, left me feeling uncertain and unclear about our commitment to a future as a Catholic university. As Chair of the Department of Theology, though speaking only in my own person and making no claim to rep­resent the distinguished faculty of that department whom I both love and admire, I feel! have the responsibility to register a minority report. I am not now speaking about the particular decision regarding "The Vagina Monologues." Rather, I am concerned with the rhetoric about the Catholic university in which the decision was framed and which is now becoming settled convention in articulating the character of our Catholic identity. 
For increasingly there is a missing conversation partner. The statement of our President barely mentions the Church. If the Church is ever mentioned in the responses I have read so far, it is in the gratitude expressed that we have not attempted to "appease" the Church or the Church hierarchy, or else in the (unintentionally) patronizing allusion to those who care about the University's relationship to the Church as implicitly conceiving the University along the lines of a seminary. It is as though the mere mention of a relationship with the Church has become so alien to our ways of thinking and so offensive to our quest for a disembodied "excellence" that it is has become impolite to mention it at all. The President's statement repeatedly refers to "the Catholic intellectual tradi­tion," a phrase that in itself is unobjec­tionable but which has now become almost a circumlocution used to avoid mentioning what seems unfashionable and almosfunthinkable to mention, namely, the Church. 
But Ex Corde Ecclesiae, which the President's statement cites, speaks of a relationship not in the first place between the Catholic university and the Catholic intellectual tradition, but between the Catholic university and the Church. And, whether we recognize it or not, this relationship to the Church -to the real, incarnate Body of Christ, the Church as it is with all its blemishes and not the abstract, idealized Church in our minds -is the lifeblood and only guar­antee of our identity as a Catholic uni­versity. There is no Catholic identity apart from affiliation with the Church. Appeal to "the Catholic intellectual tradi­tion" apart from some explicit relation­ship to the Church risks reducing the tradition itself to an abstraction. And again, I do not mean an imaginary Church we some­times might wish existed, but the 
"Without a sense ofthe University's 
concrete, visible intellectually rig­communion of close relationship with, and orous seminary "hierarchic and programs,
accountability to, the Church, 

charismatic including our
the unique and precious

gifts," "at once own). This is to holy and always intellectual fabric that we have invite and to cul­in need of purifi­tivate an intellec­
woven here ... can never in

cation," in which tual tradition 
the long run be sustained." 

"each bishop that is not must be a direct connection between the statements of the bishop and particular policies of the University, but neither has the bishop ever said that, not even in this case, and in any event the main point, again, is that his views and those of the magisterium in general have come to seem unworthy even of mention as possibly and in some small way determi­native of our identity. 
The President's statement, as a way of going forward, seems to ratify our unspoken declaration of independence from the Church, to permit it as the "default" mode of operation, and to invite the reduction of any model of the universitywhich entails any explicit relationship to the magisterium of the 
Church as a 
"seminary" 
model (pace all 
represents his own church and all of [the bishops] together with the Pope represent the whole Church ... " (Lumen Gentium 1.4,8; 3.23). 
Now, no one would deny that the rela­tionship between University and Church is not a challenging relationship with many attendant difficulties. And there is certainly room for argument about what are the specific, appropriate forms and shapes that the University's relationship with the Church should take. But this relationship, which necessarily involves some measure of accountability, should never be dismissed as an irrelevance, and that is what is increasingly happen­ing at our University, ifour President's statement, the debate that shaped it and the responses it elicited so far, are any indication. The local bishop's statements in the present case are not even men­tioned, and bringing them up almost seems like an offense in polite intellectu­al company. I am not saying that there moored to any 
ecclesial commu­nity or authority that could have a claim on defining that intellectual tradition. It is to invite and to cultivate an intellectu­al tradition in which "Catholic" is not normed by accountability to any incar­nate, historical body but only to the dis­incarnate, a-historical church of the mind. 
The ancient Gnostic heresy developed an elitist intellectual tradition which eschewed connection to the "fleshly" church of the bishop and devalued or spiritualized the sacraments. Are we in danger of developing a gnosticized ver­sion of the "Catholic intellectual tradi­tion," one which floats free of any norming connection and so free of any concrete claim to Catholic identity? Are we -meaning all of us, and not just the President, for this is not just his problem -disowning the problem, rather than facing it honestly as a prob­lem, as a project, as a challenge, as a struggle and yes, as a commitment? There is no commitment if it is not explicitly stated. 
These concerns may be more evident to a Theology department chair than to others, because it is beyond dispute that no one cares much about theology apart from the believing community, the Church, and that without a concrete accountability to the Church theologians would eventually be out of a job! But everyone who is honestly invested in Catholic identity, in a genuine Catholic intellectual tradition, in the special intellectual witness that is demanded of a Catholic university, should feel some caution, and even some regret, at the absence of any explicit commitment to accountability to the Church reflected in the President's statement, and in the early positive responses it received. Without a sense of the University's close relationship with, and accountability to, the Church, the unique and precious intellectual fabric that we have woven here and which many, including many who are not Catholic, have come to value precisely because of its special character and witness, can never in the long run be sustained. 
I would ask that anyone who has come to value the uniqueness of our intellec­tual culture here at Notre Dame consid­er carefully what I have written, and not discount it immediately as just another instance of the standard boilerplate of extremist pressure groups that unfortu­nately exist within the Catholic Church today. This is not the time to indulge in the luxury of discounting by labeling. For this, I thank the reader in advance. I am sure that as a university communi­ty we can rise to this occasion. I am also sure that we have no other choice if we want to preserve some distinctiveness as an intellectual culture. 
Thanks for your consideration of these matters. Sincerely, 
John C. Cavadini Associate Professor and Chair Department ofTheology Director, Institute for Church Life Aprill4 
Immigration and America's mistake 
The United States has made a mistake. This mistake has made life very difficult for some of those around us, and has even cost some people their lives. Thankfully, there is something we can do about it. 
The mistake is in our immigration system. More specifically, it is that as the demand for labor in this country grew, the government didn't raise the quotas of visas issued. However, visas or no visas, if there are jobs, the people will come -and they did. Restaurants, landscapers, farm owners and many more all hired · them for the low-wage jobs. As many have noticed, gov­ernment ollicials have made no significant efforts to crack down on these employers. These oficials must have realized that the employers, and our nation, need­ed the immigrants' labor. Now, there are roughly 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the United States. 
It is not the American citizens who suffer in this situa­tion. "Undocumented !immigrants] add at least $22 bil­lion. in total. to the economy each year" ("and legalizing their status would increase that amount"). (www.lulac.org) Furthermore, we can see that it has not harmed job opportunities in our country: "during the period of high immigration in the 1990's, real wages actually increased across all income levels, including those of the poorest 20 pereent of American households, while the national unemployment rate fell below four percent (www.pfaw.org)." While some Americans fear that these immigrants are a drain on our social servic­es, the facts would suggest otherwise. Undocumented immigrants are ineligible for many public federal assis­tance programs and "all immigrants, regardless of sta­tus, will pay on average $80,000 per capita more in taxes than they use in government services over their lifetime (www.americas.org)." Though many Americans are unaware of this, undocumented immigrants do pay income, sales, gas and property taxes. Perhaps some taxes on migrant workers, whose earnings may go unrecorded, cannot be enforced, but of course, this would change with legal status. Most undocumented workers though, receive paychecks like everyone else and, like everyone else, they get money taken out for Social Security, but it is money that they will never col­lect on. Because of this, the Social Security system has gotten "approximately $420 billion from the earnings of immigrants who are not in a position to claim benefits" (as of 2004, www.immigrantsolidarity.org). 
Though Americans do not suffer in this situation the undocumented immigrants certainly do. They have a much more difficult life because of their immigration status. Families are separated. Fathers who come alone to work in the U.S. will often not see their wives and children for two or three years. Similarly, families who have come here together, or people who have started families once they have arrived here, will not go back to visit their families. They do not want to risk bringing their children (or themselves) across the border any more than they have to. Grandparents do not see their grandchildren; adults have a tough decision to make if they want to visit a dying relative back home. And, though most people make it safely across our border, many have also died trying. According to CBS News, "upwards of 1,000 a year are dying" trying to cross the border. Those who do arrive here find themselves in a country where they lack basic rights. It is a situation of taxation without representation and at times, intimida­tion. 
Sadly, this situation is the best option for many people. Jobs in the native countries of many are scarce and very low-paying. These undocumented immigrants chose to come to our country even though it's risky and our country would not grant them any rights. True, they did not have to come. It was a choice. But what we have to ask ourselves is -do we feel like continuing to deny these people their rights? Do we want to be a country that takes advantage of people whenever possible? 
Also, we shouldn't forget that the people who are here without documents are already part of our country. Our children go to school together; we go to the same church. We see people who don't have documents everyday, in passing or while they arc working. Sure, we could support legislation that makes these people's lives more difficult, but why? 
If our government passes legislation that allows undocumented immigrants to get visas, this country will be fixing its mistakes. Some people though, would pr!:J­fer that we show the world that we stand by our laws ­be they just or unjust. Some think that we should punish the weakest members of our society for breaking a law that our own government has ignored. 
I would prefer to be part of a country that can admit its mistakes, fix them, and move on. Please, support leg­islation that helps the immigrants who don't have docu­ments.

SCENE FEATURE 

1 Scary Movie 4' lacks humor, originality 
By BRIAN DOXTADER and ERIN 
MCGINN 
Scene Critics 
"Scary Movie 4," billed as the "fourth and linal lilm in the trilogy" is one sequel too many. Directed by David Zucker ("Airplane!" and "The Naked Gun"), the movie seems have potential. but the mate­rial is toi> thin and the humor too broad and tasteless for it to emerge as a parody classic like its original predecessor. 
Tom Cruise himself borders so close to parody that hn snes too easy a target, though Craig Bierko's measured perform­ancn adeptly swings between the over­serious, 'Born on the Fourth of July' Cruise of movies and the insane, love-sick Scientologist Cruise of mallifl~. 
Anna Faris remains the anchor of the series, playing up the "dumb blonde" stereotype so prevalent in horror films (here spooling Sarah Michelle Gellar in "The Grudge"), though it seems less appropriate as the film starts to get away from pure horror. 
The chief inspiration for "Scary Movie 4" is a pair of hit films, "War of Worlds"

and "The Grudge," but is also draws from the likes of 'The VIllage" and "Saw." Non­horror films like "Brokeback Mountain" and "Million Dollar Baby" make cameo appearances, which demonstrates just how different the "Scary Movie" series has become since il'i original incarnation. 
Parody is edgy, scandalous and reveal­ing at its best. The problem with "Scary Movie 4" is that the material it parodies is in of itself laughable. In other cases, it aims for broad, un-clever retreads -a scene that mimics "Brokeback Mountain" is so tiredly unoriginal that it is almost an insult to the audience. 
Elsewhere, a pre-credits sequence involving Shaq and Dr. Phil, though one of the film's funnier moments, is essentially a throwaway. 
An important question that "Scary Movie 4" raises is this: is scatological humor funny anymore? Was it ever? Why do filmmakers feel the need for poo and fart jokes over thirty years after "Blazing Saddles?" A scene in which a blind Carmen Electra mistakes a courthouse for a bathroom is not only gross, but also lasts way too long. 
Like SNL skits that run out of steam before they stumble to their conclusions, "Scary Movie 4" is so bizarrely paced (funny sequences seem too short, unfunny sequences last too long) that it at times feels longer than its brief 83 minutes. 
The franchise has strayed so far from its original premise that it is grasping for ideas. While the broad social humor works, it seems inappropriate in a film entitled "Scary Movie 4." The first "Scary Movie" worked because it drew on the entire horror genre (though mostly the slasher sub-genre). By now, "Scary Movie" has more installments than "Scream" and nearly as many as "Halloween." This is a problem. 
In a strangely paradoxical way, "Scary Movie 4" is at its best and worst when it adheres to real life rather than horror films. Terrorists, Bush's reaction to 9/11 and the United Nations all get parodied with mixed results. 
Leslie Nielson serves absolutely no pur­pose, and his scenes could have easily been cut, though the filmmakers probably needed him to stretch the material into feature length. 
Which leads to the most important ques­tion: if the filmmakers are so desperate for material, does "Scary Movie 4" deserve to be a feature-length? Though sporadically funny, the film nevffl"' treally 

'Slevin' struggles through identity crisis 
By ERIN MCGINN Scene Critic 
There is a dear problem with a movie that has to explain its allusions, especial­ly when the movie tries to be smarter than the average flick. "Lucky Number Slevin" falls into this category -it is an intelligent movie painfully dumbed-down so that everyone is able to understand and follow along. 
"Lucky Number Slevin" is about a case of mistaken identity. Slevin (Josh llartnett), suffering from a series of bad breaks, heads to his friend's apartment only to lind his friend gone and a line of serious debt-collectors close on his path. Slevin is taken to the Boss (Morgan Freeman) and then to the Habbi (Sir Ben Kingsley), two rival mob bosses who con­veniently live in apartment buildings aeross the 
The plot is nothing to get excited over -it speaks more of the familiar than the fresh. The case of mistaken identity has been around forever, and the movie is reminiscent of one of this theme's most famous examples -Alfred Hitchcock's "North by Northwest" starring Cary Grant. Hartnett compares his character to that of Grant's, just in case the audi­ence missed that "Slevin" is unoriginal. 
The film certainly tries to be smart and, in the hands of a more capable and experienced writer, it could have been. Instead every bright moment of clever­ness is dimmed by its subdued examples and over-explanations. Unfortunately for "Lucky Number Slevin" other movies, such as "The Usual Suspects," were far more successful about pulling the wool over the eyes of the audience.

Coming to his aid is Lindsey (Lucy Liu) who lives in the apartment across from where Slevin is staying.

question is how the characters will get to that point. 
The characters are what make this movie worthwhile and the true joy of "Slevin" is indeed the performances of the actors. They clearly had fun making the film, and the audience has just as much fun watching them. 
Hartnett proves that he is a capable actor and can handle himself well with talented film veterans. Liu was also given the opportunity to relax and have fun, gets going. Like the other "Scary Movie" films, the fourth installment is episodic, with little emphasis on plot. 
"Scary Movie 4" is not a bad film per se, but parody tends to succeed based on the strength of the original material. This is what made the first "Scary Movie" so effectively funny. 
While it's admirable that the filmmakers realized these limitations and tried to branch out, audiences will wish they had­n't gone for the obvious targets. Still, they made the easy but oddly appropriate choice by going with Tom Cruise's melt­down -after all, his appearance on Oprah was undoubtedly the scariest thing to come along in the past half decade.

and it is refreshing to see her in a role where she isn't the killer ("Kill Bill") or scantily-clad ("Charlie's Angels"). Bruce Willis is in fine form, as are the other supporting characters of Freeman and Kingsley. It is unfortunate that they couldn't have had more time on-screen to really show off their skills. 
The lesser-known supporting charac­ters act impressively as well -one of the best performances in the film is that of Mykelti Williamson, best known as Bubba from "Forrest Gump," as one of the Boss' bodyguards. 
Unfortunately for the excellent cast, they didn't have the complexity of plot to live up to their skills. While enjoyable to watch, it is not the experience that it could have been. Watching "Lucky Number Slevin" is like reading the illus­trated classic edition of a great novel. The audience is left wishing that they had seen the real version of the film ­instead of the abridged and watered­down version.

PLAY REVIEW 
'Matt and Ben' sweetly satirical taste of fame 
SCENE fEATURE 
Affleck and Damon prove to be unlikely movie duo 
Hollywood stars Matt Damon, left, and Ben Affleck are friends as well as co-worke~ and have conspired on such items as "Good Will Hunting'' and "Project Greenllght." 
By SEAN SWEANY 
Assistant Scene Editor 
Matt Damon and Ben Affleck. The two names go together like Laurel and Hardy or Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson. The two Hollywood mega stars have enjoyed fame and fortune in their brief movie careers ever since their break­out performances in "Good Will Hunting." 
The story of their seemingly overnight transformation from obscure actors to stardom is the epitome of the Hollywood success story. 
Matt and Ben were good friends throughout childhood as they played little league and took drama classes together. Both had a penchant for act­ing and ventured to Hollywood to attempt a career in show business. Their early careers featured small roles in movies and television, but this satisfied neither of the aspiring leading men. 
The trouble the two encountered landing big roles led them to write an independent screenplay so that they would have complete control over their project. Their script was first pur­chased by the film company Castle Rock, but the studio would not give Matt and Ben the control they desired. Director Kevin Smith -a friend who cast Matt and Ben in his independent comedy "Chasing Amy" -delivered their script to the head of the studio Miramax, which immediately bought the film and gave the two their desired control. 
The screenplay, entitled "Good Will Hunting," told the story of a young man (Damon) from Boston who was prodi­gious in mathematics but had trouble 
in relationships with other people and 
himself. Damon's character must strug­
gle with himself and his relationships 
so that he can open up to others and 
also realize his gift and its true poten­
tial. 

In 1997, "Good Will Hunting" made it 
to the big screen and grossed $225 mil­
lion worldwide, making it the highest 
grossing Miramax picture until 
"Chicago" in 2002. 
Critics loved the film not only for the 
writing, but also because of the superb 
acting from Damon, Affleck and sup­
porting actors including Robin Williams 
and Stellan Skarsgard ("Amistad"). 
"Good Will Hunting" won two Academy 
Awards -Best Supporting Actor 
(Robin Williams) and Best Original 
Screenplay. 
After their success with "Good Will Hunting," Matt and Ben immediately · became two of the most well known ·· actors in Hollywood. 
They acted together in several more 
films, including "Dogma," "Jay and 
Silent Bob Strike Back" and "Jersey 
Girl." Beyond this, however, the acting 
careers of the friends began to take dif­
ferent paths. 
Affleck chose roles in big budget 
blockbusters such as "Armageddon," 
"Pearl Harbor" and "Daredevil." 
Damon, on the other hand, picked proj­
ects based on the director and made 
movies such as "Rounders," "The 
Talented Mr. Ripley," "All The Pretty 
Horses" and "Syriana." 
While Damon made his share of big 
budget movies like "Ocean's Eleven" 
and "The Bourne Identity," these still 
tended to be more serious films than 
Affleck's. 
Although their careers diverged, the 
two remain good friends and still work

Running last week at the DPAC's Philbin Theater. "Matt and Ben" was a sweetly satiric one-act romp into the fictional private lives of its two famous protagonists when they happened upon "Good Will Hunting" -or rather, when "Will Hunting" happened upon them. 
The play opened with Ben Affleck (Nathaniel Grams) and Matt Damon (Carly Vandewalle) in Ben's apartment, as Ben painstakingly attempts to adapt 
J.D. Salinger's "Catcher in the Rye" for the screen, line by literal line. The ban­tering relationship set up by Grams and Vandewalle here lent the play a fun, deeply felt camaraderie between the two that never let up, despite an erratic and hysterical fight scene, as well as visits from both Gwyneth Paltrow and Salinger himself (por­trayed by Grams and Vandewalle, respectively). 
Both the play's action and sense of humor were jumpstarted by one unlikely event. After fighting with each other and the audience, Matt and Ben are shocked when a stuffed manila envelope, containing a certain verbose but inspired script, falls from the sky, out of the hands of fate and into Ben's apartment. 
What the two do with the work, and how it impacts their lives in the imme­diate and later future, were the issues at the center of "Matt and Ben," and proved to be the basts-~df" a great evening of theater. 
The set of "Matt and Ben" was per­fect for a Bostonian comedy, giving the impression of a Southie apartment with Fenway Park posters and an angular design that emphasized the action onstage. Littered with food wrappers, laundry, and a faded old couch, set designer Steve Hoeplinger's set aptly fit its owners. The yellowish lighting also lent the apartment a more dingy, lived­in feel. 
Along with this feel was the music chosen as an introduction to the play. Queen and the Killers greeted the ears of audience members and each song was interestingly bracketed by quotes from "Good Will Hunting," lending the audience a better sense of the work and characters in question. 
Using both dialogue and direct address to the audience, Grams and Vandewalle were able to use the play's humor and their own talents to connect "Matt and Ben" with the crowd. 
The challenge for the actors, then, was in portraying a real-life friendship between two of Hollywood's best­known celebrities, while still being both true to the work and to their own interpretations. 
"I think that with such a public fig­ure, it's impossible to not take the actu­al person into account," Grams said. For him, watching the characters' films helped him understand them, an effort reflected in his and Vanderwalle's endearingly solid performances. 
"I think we as an audience praise their friendship in real life," Grams

said. "And are captivated by their work that much more because we know there's that real element there." 
In the end, it's through that lens of good friends that "Matt and Ben" is best seen, and for all of the play's zany comedy and tough discourse between its leads, it remains a work about the power of that bond in spite of every­thing else. 
"I think if we can learn anything from 'Matt & Ben,"' director Cameron Rains said. "it is that true friendship cannot be forged over coffee or a cell phone conversation, but over a lifetime." 
To Rains, "Matt and Ben" offers the example of Affleck and Damon in light of more than just comedic fun. 
"Can it be written off as fluff come­dy? No," Rains said. '"Matt & Ben' reminds us of what a blessing a good friend can be and warns us to the dan­gers of taking such a gift for granted."

on projects together. One of their latest efforts is "Project Greenlight" -a con­test through which aspiring screenwrit­ers can submit their work with the hopes of making it into a full-length movie. 
The entire process of selecting and creating the movie would air on televi­sion before the final film premiered in theaters. This endeavor has led to two films -"Stolen Summer" and "The Battle of Shaker Heights" -both of which received respectable amounts of critical acclaim. 
Through "Project Greenlight," Matt Damon and Ben Affleck are able to help other aspiring screenwriters par­ticipate in the dream and success they enjoyed from "Good Will Hunting." Their remarkable story demonstrates the reward of perseverance and deter­mination in the typically cutthroat world of Hollywood. 
A story like theirs will serve as inspi­ration to many young dreamers who hope to make it big on the silver screen.

Art is fickle like that. There's a huge dillerence between admir­ing something and actually liking it. And you know what? Nobody ever said you have to. As a film student, I've been obligated to see countless classic films ­some are amazing, most are good, a few are ... well, a few of them aro pretty painful. I can admire the craftsmanship. I can be in awe of the production val­ues. I can marvel at the cine­matography and the technique and I can absolutllly hate the lilm. 
For me, it's Michelangelo Antonioni's 'TAvventura," a gor­geously crafted, groundbreaking treatise on post-war Italy ... and truly one of the most boring films I have ever seen. Seriously, I don't think "L'Avventura" could be any duller. Sure, it's a social eomment on the empty, syco­phantic existence of the upper class, but the fact that Antonioni hit the nail on the head means two and half' hours of what feels like nothing happening.

The thing is, we're not obligated to like nvnry single picture that crit­i<~s or tlw like have deenwd a rnastPrpi<l<~e. And fllally, no film is sacmd. There are many people of varying degrees of film knowl­mlgn {professors. critics, sdwl­ars. makers, students, etc.) who absolutely detest "Citizen Kane" though they feel obligated to claim they love the AFI's Greatest Film of All Time.

A couple of others that were mentioned: 
Taxi Driver 
Not really a bad film, but its impact has dimmed considerably in the 30 years since its release. A truly great film is both timely and timeless. "Taxi Driver" is certainly timely and works as a snapshot of its era, but doesn't work as well out of that context. Plus, it takes a long time for the plot to get going, which means it feels plodding in places. 

Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans 
Yeah yeah, Murnau's master­piece, the pinnacle of the silent picture, blah blah. Does nobody ever seem to notice that the pro­tagonist (cleverly named 'The Man") is completely insane? He frrst tries to kill his wife (cleverly named "The Wife") then decides to take her on a trip into town. Along the way, he feels the need to threaten people and generally act ... well, crazy. For all its tech­nical merits, the story is too problematic to work as well as it should. 
So the next time someone asks you if you like "Citizen Kane," don't be afraid to tell the truth. If you don't like a film, you don't like it and that's your right. Besides, if everyone agreed on everything all the time, what fun would the cinema be?

DPAC SPOTLIGHT 



Fear still abounds in 'Jaws' 
By MARTY SCHROEDER Scene Writer 
The bane of beach towns everywhere, "Jaws" hit screens in 197 5 and set a new paradigm for American cinema. People fled beaches in droves and packed into theaters to see this thriller from Steven Spielberg. As part of the "PAC 100". it will invade the DPAC Saturday. 
This film revolves around the small beach community of Amity Island and the new police chief, Martin Brody (Roy Scheider). After a girl is mysteriously slaughtered during a late night swim, the entire town is in a furor. The mayor, thinking of revenue· derived from summer tourists, goes against the advice of the police chief and keeps the beaches open after this brutal death. After a few more incidents, Brody, the Oceanographic Institute shark expert Matt Hooper {Richard Dreyfuss) and the burly, boorish captain of the Orca known only as Quint (Robert Shaw) set out to slay the beast terrorizing the island. 
The acting in "Jaws" is solid, but not great. However, the three men on the boat form an easily sympathized camaraderie. In a notable scene, they share stories about their scars. The cap­tain tells an old war story involving sharks which gen­erates a hatred for the Great White in question. If, while beholding this film, one finds no hatred, he surely would find fear. Like many before, viewers may not be able to go to a beach ever again. 
On the technical end of the film, cinematographer Bill Butler provides beautiful shots. The choice of camera 
angles adds an ambiance of disquiet that, although sub­tle, provides the proper framework through which to tell this story. A now famous retrograde zoom provides the perfect example of character­ization through the camera that set the standard for this particular type of camera work. 
Aside from the traditional parts of film, the special effects were like nothing that had ever been seen before. The animatronic shark, affectionately dubbed "Bruce" by the crew, effec­tively provided an element of terror. Although it may look dated today, "Bruce" has withstood the test of time. Provided belief is suspended on the part of the audience, 
this  shark still  creates  a  
"beach-phobia"  amongst  
moviegoers.  

Before 1975, the summer 
blockbuster was not the prime focus of studio execu­tives. Because of "Jaws" they now think of nothing else. The popularity of this film in the summer of '7 5 proved that if a studio has one breakout hit, it could stay in business. Now, studios will focus on a few films they think will be hits and yield an enormous sum in profits. They could lose money on every film that they release throughout the year but as long as they have that one blockbuster, they will stay in the black. Whether you love or hate the man, Spielberg changed the industry with this classic. 
This technical skill dis­played in this film along with its influence on the American film industry marks this film as a standard in what American movies would become. The special effects look ahead to the seminal effects of "Star Wars" that would take the world by storm in 1977. If one likes beaches, this may not be the film for you. However, since this is merely cinema and based on no factual shark attacks, terrified enjoyment is in order for some summer fun in the theater.

"Jaw~" is based on the story of a trio of friends who are plagued by a killer shark. Starring Roy Sche1der as Police Chief Martin Brody, the film is one of Steven Spielberg's early greats.

Associated Press 
SAN FRANCISCO -The head athletic trainer for the San Francisco Giants was told to appear before a federal grand jury inves­tigating whether Barry Bonds lied about his con­nection to the BALCO steroids scandal, a news­paper reported. 
Stan Conte, who is not related to Bay Area Laboratory Co-Operative owner Victor Conte, was subpoenaed to appear in a San Francisco federal courtroom April 2 7, the San Francisco Chronicle reported Tuesday, citing three anonymous sources familiar with the investiga­tion. 

Conte is scheduled to appear before the grand jury on the same day as Bonds' orthopedic sur­geon, Dr. Arthur Ting. The grand jury subpoenaed Ting's medical records related to Bonds a year ago, the Chronicle report­ed. 
The panel has been hearing testimony for more than a month about whether the outfielder lied to a separate grand jury in December 2003 about his connection to BALCO. 
Bonds addressed the lat­est probe publicly for the first time Tuesday on his television show, "Bonds on Bonds." 
IN BRIEF 
Reds place Griffey on l!Hiay
disabled list 
CINCINNATI -Ken Griffey Jr. said Tuesday that he agreed to go on the 15-day disabled list to let his leg heal fully and to help the Cincinnati Reds with a roster predicament. 
The team wanted to put the 36­year-old outfielder on the disabled list Monday night after a medical test found an inflamed tendon behind his right knee. Griffey had missed five games at that point. 
Griffey went along even though he should be ready to play before he's eligible to return in 10 days. The move gave the Reds an opening to activate catcher Jason LaRue off the disabled list. 
LaRue, who had knee surgery dur­ing spring training, was activated and rejoined the team on Tuesday. 
"Certain things work good for the player and good for the team," Griffey said Tuesday, after a long bat­ting practice session. 

"I knew I was still being investigated, but I didn't know that was particularly coming," he said. 
Bonds added that he would not repeat what he told the BALCO grand jury more than two years ago, saying he still stands by those comments. 
"I said what I said in the grand jury testimony," he said. "That's what I stated and that's what I will live by for the rest of my life." 
Bonds was one of a string of elite athletes called as witnesses in the steroids conspiracy case. They were granted partial immunity, protected from prosecution as long as they testified truthfully. 
According to excerpts of the testimony previously reported by the Chronicle, Bonds testified that he used a clear substance and a cream given to him by a trainer who later pleaded guilty in a steroid-distribu­tion ring, but said he didn't know they were steroids. 
Bonds said Greg Anderson, his personal trainer, told him the sub­stances he used were the nutritional supplement flaxseed oil and a rubbing balm for arthritis. 
The substances Bonds described were similar to ones known as "the clear" and "the cream," two steroids at the center of the BALCO scandal. 

Morrison close to declaring
for draft 

SPOKANE -Gonzaga forward Adam Morrison is expected to forgo his senior year and declar·e for the NBA draft, according to numerous media reports. 
Morrison, a first-team All-America and the nation's leading scorer, has not commented on the reports, but has scheduled a press conference at Gonzaga for Wednesday afternoon. 
His mother would not say if Morrison was turning pro. 
"No comment," Wanda Morrison told The Associated Press on Tuesday. 
Spokane television stations KREM and KXLY and FoxSports.com report­ed Monday night that Morrison had decided to turn pro. All cited unnamed sources. The Spokesman­Review and The Seattle Times both reported in Tuesday's editions that he would leave, also citing unnamed sources. 
Kings commence firing in 
wake of missing playoffs 
EL SEGUNDO -President and gen­eral manager Dave Taylor was among those dismissed by the Los Angeles Kings on Tuesday during a major housecleaning. 
The moves came after the Kings stumbled down the stretch of the sea­son and failed to make the playoffs for the third consecutive year. 
The entire coaching staff, including interim head coach John Torchetti, will not have their contracts renewed. But Torchetti, who took over when Andy Murray was fired last month, was told he can interview for the job when the new president and GM is named. 
Kevin Gilmore, assistant GM, and Bill O'Flaherty, director of player person­nel, also were relieved of their duties. 
Even Tim Leiweke said he is stepping aside as CEO to allow the incoming presidenVGM to have full control of the hockey operations, although Leiweke will remain the team's governor.

SMC GOLF 
Belles prepare to host at Blackthorn 
By BECKY DORNER 
Sporrs Writer 

Fresh off a third-place finish at the Illinois Wesleyan Spring Fling, Saint Mary's looks to con­tinue its success at the SMC/Bethel Invitational today at Blackthorn Golf Club in South Bend. 
The familiar surroundings may add to the team's already boosted confidence from the Bolles' past solid performances. 
At Illinois Wesleyan, MIAA league MVP Megan Mattia once again led the way for the Belles by finishing seventh overall with a 162. Freshman Alex Sei had her best round under coach Mark Hamilton, shooting a 76 on day two that helped her to record a two-day total of 166 to finish tied for 13th. In addition to Mattia's 82 and Sei's 76 in second-round play, the Belles were also bolstered by solid scores of 82 from Katie O'Brien and an 84 by captain Meredith Fantom. Combined, the Belles fell only one stroke shy of a tie for second place with William Woods University. 
The amount of par fives, as well as par threes at Blackthorn should offer a lot of birdie opportunities for the Belles, which may be just what they need. 
"[The team needs to] tighten things up and be a little more precise around the greens in order to challenge the top three teams in the country," Hamilton said. "That will be our focus for the next couple of weeks." 

The pressure created by a course dominated by extremes -both par five and three ­should accentuate the short game that the Belles have been concentrating on lately. 
Saint Mary's is still in position for the NCAA tournament as the top two teams in each region earn a spot.

Amram earns seventh shutout in 6-0 series finale, allows three hits 
By DEIRDRE KRASULA 
Sports Writer 

Saint Mary's gained its ninth conference win as the team swept Tri-State 6-5 and 6-0. Freshman Kristin Amram cap­tured her seventh shutout of the season, allowing only three hits in the second game. Junior shortstop Sarah Meisle knocked in two home runs, going 3-for-4 in the first game. 
Tri-State jumped to an early 3-0 lead after the second inning in the opener. Shortstop Rainbow Bednarski scored and first baseman Ashley Kostelnik garnered an RBI double to give the Thunder the 2-0 lead. In the top of the second, right fielder Kara Graham drove in a run to bring the score to 3-0. 
The Belles answered Tri­State's call in the bottom of the third when Meisle hit a three­run homer to tie the contest. Tri-State and Saint Mary's then went run for run, bringing the score to 5-5 and sending the game into extra innings. 
"Throughout the season our main goal is to never give up," 
...
Amram said. "We proved just that-we didn't quit." 
Freshman right fielder Calli Davison ended the game, send­ing Amram home off a fielder's choice. 
The Belles carried their momentum into the second matchup, shutting out Tri-State 6-0. 
"From the moment we came back [in the first game] the momentum never died down between games," Amram said. 
Meisle opened the scoring in the top of the second when she blasted her second homer of the day to give the Belles their first run. Center fielder Laura Reline followed with a sacrifice fly to give Saint Mary's the 2-0 lead. 
Meisle continued to dominate from behind the plate as she drove in another run in the top of the third. Bridget Grall and Martha Smid followed with RBis in the top of the fourth to give the Belles a 5-0 lead. Freshman catcher Ashley Fusaro secured the Belles' lead as she homered in the top of the fifth to put Saint Mary's up 6-0. 
Amram ensured the Belles win as she struck out eight from the mound and allowed only three hits. 
Saint Mary's will play at Albion today at 3:30 p.m. in Albion, Mich.

American records fall atMt. SAC 
Huddle sets national 
mark in 5,000 meters 
for 2006 with 15:40.41 .~ -------------------------­By CHRIS HINE Sporrs Writer 
Notre Dame's Easter break was anything but restful, as the Irish sent athletes to two meets, resulting in their 17th Mideast regional qualification and the setting of both national and sehool records. 
At the Mt. San Antonio College Relays in Walnut, Calif., senior All-American Molly Huddle finished third in the 5,000 meter run with a time of 15:40.41, posting the top time in the country this year and fourth best in school history. 
Senior All-American Stephanie Madia plaeed sixth in the race -good enough for the third-best American time this year. Huddle and Madia raced against collegiate and profes­sional sprinters from all parts of the globe in the event. China's Yuan Jin claimed !lrst with a time only two seeonds faster than Huddle, while Mexico's Dulee Rodriguez crossed the finish line in sec­ond, beating Huddle by a half­second. 
At the · Pomona-Pitzer Invitational in Claremont, Calif., junior sprinter Okeehi Ogbuokiri qualified for the Mideast Regional meet by win­ning the 400-meter dash in 
54.47 seconds. Ogboukiri, jun­ior Maryann Erigha, sopho­more Dominique Manning and sophomore Brienne Davis took first in the 4 x 100 meter relay. 
Senior Laura Huarte and freshman Mary Saxer broke school records at Mt. San Antonio. Huarte broke her own record in the javelin with a sec­ond place finish of 154 feet, 2 inches, besting her former high mark by seven feet. Saxer tied Jaime Volkmer's school record in the pole vault with a leap of 12 feet, 9.5 inch{ls, good enough to win the Olymipic development division. 
Senior sprinter Ryan Postel competed in both meets, win­ning the 400-meter dash in 
47.34 seconds at Pomona, while claiming third in the same event with a time of 47.27 seconds at Mt. San Antonio. 
Senior Mideast qualifier Stacey Cowan tied for first at Pomona, in a rain-abbreviated high jump, clearing 5 feet, 5 inches.

Green jerseys not enough to give No. 1 seed red scare 
Laumann and Co. clobber Bolsheviks; Godspeed John Glenn falls to earth; Rule #76 makes no excuses, plays like a champion 
By GREG ARBOGAST, CHRIS 
HINE and TIM DOUGHERTY 
Sports Writers 
With a crowd of almost 150 people cheering them on, the Bolsheviks converted a late field goal but ultimately fell to No. 1 seed U Got a Bad Draw 21-3 Tuesday. 
The Bolsheviks reached into Notre Dame coach Charlie Weis' bag of tricks for inspiration, as they pulled off their blue Keenan shirts to reveal green jerseys they were wearing underneath. 
"To be honest, we were really intimidated when we saw the green jerseys," said U Got a Bad Draw captain Brady Quinn, reminiscent of the Irish football team's Oct. 15 game against 
usc. 
Ultimately, the boost the green jerseys gave to the Bolsheviks was not enough to make up for the talent disparity between the two teams. U Got a Bad Draw scored 10 consecu­tive points to open the game before Kevin Baker finally hit a jumper from three-point range to give the Bolsheviks their first point of the night. 
You Got a Bad Draw was able to get inside consistently with Chris Devitt and Eric Laumann, who accounted for 14 of the team's 21 points. When they weren't scoring down low, U Got a Bad Draw was usually attempt.ing alley-oops, a,nd on~ highlight moment came when Chinedum Ndukwe found Quinn for a backdoor slam. 
Quinn's alley-oop was one of the only times that the crowd cheered for U Got a Bad Draw. The largely pro-Bolshevik crowd erupted for every Bolshevik basket and heckled U Got a Bad Draw throughout the game. 
"We did our best to block the crowd out," Quinn said. "We ignored the comments, especial­ly to David Fitzgerald. He's good at ignoring being heckled." 
One of the lone bright moments for the Bolsheviks came on their second basket when Baker found himself with a one-on-one fast break oppor­tunity. Baker spun away from Quinn and hit a fall-away jumper as the crowd went wild. 
"I saw a one-on-one opportu­nity, and I clearly had the ath­letic advantage so I went for it," said Baker. 
B-3 Ballerzz 21, Asparageese 10 
The all-freshmen Fishermen of the B-3 Ballerzz, led by an infuriated Arthur Sherry on the defensive end, and red-hot Ben Whiting and Andy "soft-serve" Whalen on the offensive side, defeated Asparageese 21-10 at McGlinn courts Tuesday. 
The Ballerzz used their air­tight 2-3 defense to keep Asparageese on the perimeter and force them into making bad passes. 
"This may have been a loss, but I think we set a record for turnovers in a Bookstore game," Asparageese senior Joe Blatt sajd. 
Sherry, who played as if somebody shot his dog, occu­pied the middle of the 2-3 zone, forcing out anybody who dared enter the paint. 
Whalen had five points, despite a bloody face, and even won a quarter on a bet from a heckler in the crowd, who thought the big man could not nail a jumper. Asparageese then went to a box-and-one on Whalen to try and shut down the Ballerzz, but Ben Whiting stepped up with five second-half points, finishing with seven. 
Sean Reen added a pair of buckets, including the game winner, with the crowd chanting his name. 
"All those times I practiced in my driveway dreaming of the day I would get to win a Bookstore game with the crowd chanting my name finally came true," he said. 
But even if Reen had missed the shot, the Ballerz probably still would have won. 
In addition to the desire to win a Bookstore game, the Ballerz drew inspiration from another source. 
"We tried to get [one of our R.A's) Nathan Origer to shut up," Whalen said. 
Origer was on the sidelines with the Fisher crowd rooting on the Ballerzz, yelling out insults such as "You dribble so much you don't need a bib," that did not make sense and were not found funny by the crowds or players. 
"The rest of the guys were motivating," the Ballerzz' Brian Blacker said. "Nate was not."

Glenn at McGlinn Courts Tuesday. 
The Equators used a 2-1-2 zone in the first half to keep Glenners out of the paint while Belatti dashed and dished his way through the Glenn defense to hit his big men, senior Chris "Jesus Freak" Bachner" (eight points) and senior Mike "Big Papa" Scully, (four points) down low to jump out to a 7-0 lead. 
"Our deadly shooting, quick feet and high-tempo style of play carried us," Bachner said. The Equators turned up the heat with man-to-man action in the second half, keeping Glenn at bay while they sealed the deal. 
"We played tough enough for the ladies, but not tough enough to scare them away," Bachner said. 
Belatti had similar gender­biased sentiments. 
"We played man-to-man in the second half because some­times men have to be men," Belatti said. 
Tom "Jolly Rancher" Scrace led Glenn with four points. 
"Shout out to Tom and his beard," Neander-Dan Fanuele said. "He carried us today. 
Despite a failed attempt by some Glenn members to dis­tract the Equators by wearing revealing, spandex shorts, Glenn still felt a sense of accomplishment. 
"McGlinn courts are a little sexier now that we have played here," Ryan "Big Baby" Downie said. 
Rule #76 21, 1021 We Got Robbed 6 
In outdoor games where precarious conditions can change in a moment, Bookstore veterans can attest that it's harder to win when a team falls behind early ­especially 15-0. 1021 We Got Robbed suffered that fate and failed to surmount a threat to Rule #76 despite matching them 6-6 on the game's final 12 points. 
The bigger, stronger, faster Rule #76 swarmed 1021 with pressure defense, forcing turnovers and converting transition points en route to their 15-0 charge. 
"We pushed the ball, got a lot of fast breaks and easy steals," Rule #76er Jay Dolezal said. 
Like Willis Reed and the Knicks in Game 7 of the 1970 NBA Finals, Rule #76 was inspired by the gutsy play of Dolezal, who suffered a flesh wound early on when he tum­bled to the pavement after a drive to the basket. Thanks to the alertness of tournament commissioners/amateur medics and a textbook tape job to his hand, Dolezal's resilience embodied Rule #76's "No excuses, play like a champion" motto as he went on to score six points, includ­ing four after his injury. 
"I got some good medical attention," he explained. 
Brandon Beck scored Rule #76's first two baskets en route to a game-high seven points. 
1021er Vik Deendyal was happy with his team's overall tournament performance, but he said his squad was out­manned from the start of Tuesday's game. 
"We played well the first game because the size matchup was closer," he said. "This game was unfair -they were just so much bigger."

Irish could struggle to make tournament after dropping two league games in Colorado trip 

By TrM DOUGHERTY Sports Writer 
Playing in the middle of the mountainous Colorado terrain, Notre l>amo sutlernd iL'i rockiest stretch of tlw year this weekend. The Irish (7-4, 1-2 GWLL) dropped two eritieal eonference games with an H-5 defeat at Denver Friday and 9-H loss to Air Force in Colorado Springs Sunday, dropping from No.9 to No. 19 in the USIIA Coaches Poll. 

The losses dethroned the Irish from their first place tie for the league lead to fourth in the standings behind Denver, Air Foree and Ohio State, who are all tied with a 2-0 GWLL record. 
Friday's matchup against Denver, who rose from No. 18 to No. 15 after the win, amounted to a battle of unanswered streaks, as the Pioneers' fifth­highest scoring offense in the nation sprung ahead to a 3-0 lead at the end of the first quar­ter with two goals from sopho­more midfielder Miehael Goltra. 
"They come after you," Irish coach Kevin Corrigan said. "You can't not have them come after you. You know they are coming." 
Notre Dame exploited Denver's aggressiveness in the second quarter, storming ahead for three consecutive second quarter goals, led by freshman attack­man Ryan Hoffs team-high two goals that began the game-tying rally. The Irish made it four straight scores three minutes into the second half when Drew Peters scored his second goal of the season on a pass from senior point-leader, attackman Brian 1-Iubsehmann, to take their only lead of the game 4-3 before Denver's Ryan Zordani tied the game at four as both teams start­ed the fourth quarter.

Notre Dame center fielder Alex Nettey rounded third base with his arms in the air and was surrounded by a mob of green 
jerseys as he stepped on home plate Saturday in a series-ending victory over St. John's. 
The Irish senior had just pulled a 


first pitch, Nettey split-finger fastball from Hed Storm pitcher Hieh Armento over the left field fence for a walk-ofT, two-run homer in the bottom of the ninth inning. The 7-5 win capped ofT a three-game sweep of' St. John's-including 9-2 and 13-7 wins during a Thursday doubleheader at Frank Eck Stadium. 
An H-2 win Tuesday over Toledo stretched Notre Dame's win streak to 18 games -tied for both the longest in Notre Dame history and college base­ball this season with Mississippi
