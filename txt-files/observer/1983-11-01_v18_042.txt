Hesburgh rejects Observer plan for third ptarty accountability 
ByJEFF HARRINGTON 
Assistant News Editor 
University President Flther Theodore Hcsburgh has rejected an Observer proposal to control its own budget and reinforced the lin iver­sity's demand that Tbe Obsen1er join the Notre Dame budget program by 

Jan. I. 
Editor-in-chief David Dziedzic said The Observer will not consent to going on Notre Dame's Unit Budget Control System despite the 
· llniversity's contention that it will cut off approximately S70,000 in NO student fees, if the paper does not comply. 
In a letter last Thursday to Dzied­zic, Hcsburgh said he under:>tood the need for The Observer to have editorial independence "to the ex­tent you arc free, except in the ·~vent that you do something outrageous. I believe the action of the administra­tion in granting operational editorial independence to The Observet· over the past decade is there for eve1-yone to see." 
Dziedzic said that the key objec­tion to the University proposal hinges on editorial freedom. "The (unit budget) system would Sl~vere­ly curtail The Observer's indepen-. dence. It would allow the University to dictate how much monty we could spend and for what pt.rpose we could spend it." 
"If we can't work on projects we see as important to work on, then we are hindered editorially," he S<cid, ad­ding that "even the implication that (The Observer's) finances are being run by someone else is a sever·~ blow to the paper's integrity." 
Deeming the dispute between the newspaper and the administration a 

An editorial 
"tempest in a teapot, a crisis without an issue," Hesburgh said that both sides agree about both editorial freedom and the need for the paper to have financial accountability. 
He added, however, that all or­ganizations within the University are required to be financially ac­countable for their actions and that The Observer is no exception. "We're all accountable but we have freedom ofoperation within that ac­countability. It's a natural principle: 
we are using other people's money 
and have to be accountable for it." 
Hesburgh said he is willing to "put 
it in writing" that the University will 
not interfere with editorial content 
ofthe paper, except in the event ofa 
"preposterous" or "outrageous" ac­
tion by the paper. He said he would 
agree "to have a third party judge if 
something is preposterous." 
Dziedzic maintained that an agreement in writing would not be sufficient. "I in no way doubt the sin­cerity of Father Hesburgh. I believe they are dedicated to the idea of an editorially free paper," he said. "But, I'm worried about their successors who might see an editorial about University investments or some­thing else they don't like, and sec pulling finances as a way ofresolving the oroblem." 
"If the University has the money, who's to stop tJtem from breaking (the written agreement)? In the past, the University has never forced The Obsen1er into doing anything. If it had our money it could force us into doing many things." 
"The one thing (the newspaper) 
won't compromise on .. .is third 
party accountability," Dziedzic said. 
The University's demand to 
assume ultimate financial control of The Observer's finances comes in the wake of a University-conducted audit last summer which revealed a $7,000 deficit from last year's Ob­server operation and several cases of financial mismanagement by mem­bers of the '82-'83 Observer general 
board. 
Dziedzic said that he was "very 
disappointed and surprised" that 
Hesburgh did not consider the Ob­
server counter-proposal in his letter 
nor did he contact him to discuss the 
matter. "The letter was extremely 
vague. ( Hesburgh) does not even 
say why he doesn't agree with our 
proposal." 
Dziedzic said he wrote to Hes­
burgh personally to discuss the mat­
ter "and all I got back was a letter 
saying he's referring me to someone 
else." 
In his letter, Hesburgh proposed 
that Dziedzic meet with Executive 
Assistant to the President David 
Tyson and Student Body President 
Brian Callaghan to work out a com­
promise. 
Hesburgh said he wanted Callag­
han to be present "since we're 
talking about student money .. .it's 
reasonable that the students' top 
representative should at least know 
what's going on." 
Dziedzic said he has always been 
willing to discuss the matter with 
Callaghan, but he added that 
"ultimately, it is something which 
has to be worked out between the 
University and The Observer"

Nr. David J. Dziedzic The Observer Notre Dame, Indiana 
Dear David: 
I have had your letter discussed by the committee with which you met oricjnAlly to discuss the same matter. Personnlly, I believe this is a tempest in a teapot, a crisis without an issue. ~at you want is very simple: editorial independence to the extent that you are free, t'xcept in the event that you do something outrageous. On this point, there is no need for discussion. I believe the action of the administration in r;rantine operational editoriAl independence to The Observer over the past decade is there for everyone to see. F.ven when I was personally attacked outrnr;eousl.y and unfairly a feH times, I never did anything about it. 
The second point is accountability for the money you spend, much of which we collect and (Jive you to spend. There is no room for nec:otiation on this principle and you yourself adJllit it. The only problem is to discuss the way of doing it most appropriately and most effectively nnd with the least cost, since this money should not be spent foolishly. I believe a simple mcth0cl which is bindinc on all of us here at the University, includinr. me, should be aereeable t~ you and your staff. However this is settled, it would seem to r.te that it should he under a system currently in operation that eives before-the-expendi.ture accountability, not simply a look-bark at expenditures nfter the horse is ·out of the barn. I have nt:!ver felt that havinr; two sic:natures on the checks I sign is an obstacle to my freedom, only a protection for those whose money is beinr. spent. 
I have ashed father Dnve TysoD, m,y ~ecuti.ve Assistant, 
t.o meet with you and worl·. out these two points. Apparently, we are both acreed on el'!dl point. The only probler.l l s for you to accept some r<:>alisti c r.1eans Cor achieving your end or the barc:ain, a~ WP. are prepared to do as rer,ards curs. 
All best wishes. 

P.S.: I would also request that the Student Body President, Brian Calla(;han, be present at the meeting with you and Father Tyson. 

Tyson said he hoped to reach an L----------------------------.J understanding by accepting parts of the Observer proposal.

No1tre Dame and The Observer: mutual mistrust 
The University believes it can control The Observer's finances without endangering ·:he paper's editorial indepen­dence. The administration sees the two as separate issues. 
llnfortunately, The Observer has no way of testing the ad­ministration's theory, short ofjoining the Unit Budget Control System. Once committed to the system, The Observer would need University approval to break away. 
In short, the University asks us to trust .them. Like the Trojans, The Observer fears tile administration even when bt:aring gifts. 
Why trust administrators who offered a choice and, when The Obsen1er chose contrary to the University's will, told the paper that it never really had a choice in the first place? 
Why trust a president who openly declared at a meeting of the Notre Dame Club of Buffalo last spring The Observer was "written by juveniles for juveniles," according to two inde­pendent sources at the meeting of nearly 500? How impartial can such a man be when considering the paper's financial future? 
Why trust administrators who, in the summer of 1975, con­fiscated copies ofThe Observer so visiting alumni wouldn't be offended by criticism of the University, and by an advertise­ment? 
Why trust administrators who try to form a faculty board of advisers behind The Observer'~ back -at the same time they ponder the paper's financial future? 
Why trust administrators who, in their communications, constantly surround their financial judgments with comments on the paper's editorial policies? Witness today's letter to the editor from Dr. James McDonr,ell. 
In fact, FatherJohn Van Wolvlear has complained in at least two official letters about Obsl'1-ver editorial decisions. In an Oct. 10 letter to Saint Mary's Dean of Students Sister Karol Jackowski, he says, "I have consistently pointed out that they have an inordinate amount ofspace allocated to national news and sports whkh come from wire services, and neglect a lot of campus issues and happenings" 
In a Sept. 2 letter to Editor-in-Chief David Dziedzic, Van Wolvlear responscd to the paper's rejection ofthe University offer with a letter that deals primarily with editorial concerns. In that letter, Van Wolvlear first scolds the paper for not joining the budget system. The body ofthe letter criticizes the number ofadvertisements in the previous issue and a story on the death ofthe president ofan Evansville paper. He contends that biographies on Kitty Arnold, Dr. Pat Utz, or Dean Loux "would be ofmore interest to the University community," and that the paper "gave more ink to the death of(the Evansville 
president) than ...the students and priests who died during the summer." The last paragraph ends by criticizing The Ob­server's accounting. 
The Observer welcomes criticism. But the ease with which some administrators condemn first, the paper's finances, and in the next breath, editorial content, makes one wonder how separate the issues arc in their minds. 
Why trust a administration which has everything to gain, and has given The Observer every reason to suspect its motives? 
Hesburgh and the administration pride themselves on their ability to take "outrageous and unfair" criticism. The Observer wonders whether the administration has vented this frustra­tion in the secretive and closed-minded way they've dealt with the paper this year. 
Father Hesburgh, in criticizing the paper's position as a "tempest in a teapot, a crisis without an issue" ignores the issue. The Observer understands the University's position, but disagrees that financial ae<;ountability should be guaranteed "before the expenditure." 
Suppose The Observer had reason to believe that Notre Dame was violating recruiting standards. If the paper needed money to investigate, what recourse would it have if the Uni­versity, looking out for its own image, refused to authorize such funds? 
Though the paper's financial and editorial independence might seem distinct in theory, it is impossible to separate the two in practice. Ifthe University chose not to sign checks, the paper would be powerless. Allowing the University to control the paper's budget is like letting the White House hold the purse-strings of the Washington Post. 
So The Observer faces a Catch-22. In rejecting University­collected funds, the paper would be changed drastically. If the paper were to accept budget control from the administration, it would recognize implicitly the l :niversity's authority to keep the paper on-campus and to say "no" to any financial decisions based on editorial policy. 
Since the administration docs not trust The Obsen'er's past financial accountability, and The Obsen,er does not trust the University to control the paper's budget, a third-party solution seems not only convenient, but essential. A conflict of inter­ests arises when either party has absolute control. 
The Obsen1er is "the independent student newspaper serv­ing Notre Dame and Saint Mary's." It is a newspaper first, a student organization afterward. 
As elitist as it may sound, the newspaper is different from every other student organization on campus. One of its most important duties is to offer a daily and university-wide chal­lenge to the administration's words and actions. Regardless of past success or failure in this role, allowing the University to determine which advertisements will appear, who is eligible to work for the paper, and what the overall climate will be, is a step in the wrong direction. 
In 1977, then vice president for student affairs, BrotherJust Paczcsny, informed The Observer that the Officers of Univer­sity had decided that the paper should control all of its money: "To encourage more independent planning of their resources, The Observer should be responsible for its payroll. Therefore, the University will turn over to The Observer the net sum available for that year's operation at the beginning of the school year and The Observer will be responsible for meeting its own payroll and expenses outside of the Univer­sity payroll system." 

Why have administrators changed their minds? Do they want to punish The Observer' If this is their intent, and if the paper were to concede to the system, what would they do the next time The Observer ruffled their fcatbcr.s?  , , . , ...

The Administration's ultimatum to The Obserzer ­

The intricacies of this t:niversity decision may have been lost on the average student in the days before fall break. With mid-terms. the Trojans and Cap'n Crunch 
to deal with, many students had little time to do more than skim the newspaper. 
Talk of five digit fees, deficits and financial mis­management arc now whirling around in the heads of most students. Technical jargon concerning interest­free loans, net deficits, double-entry bookkeeping and solicitation of documented sealed bids is lost on the average student. 
Since this is S70,000 worth ofstudent fees being dis­cussed, the students have.: a

fidence in the ability of students. Because it has never 
been attempted docs not mean that this administration 
should not be given the chance. 
An interest-free $1,000 loan to the paper's systems manager is not an indication that The Obsen1er makes a regular practice of issuing personal loans to its employees. The Obsener isn't in the savings and loan business. The loan helped to finance a car which served 
during business hours as an official Obsener vehicle for the news and advertising departments. This is some­thing the University audit report failed to detail.

Faust recruits 
/Jearliditor: 

A .\jwrtinx Ne11s issut· of Sept. 19!-l.) tells us that <ierry Faust is t1nding recruiting increasingly di!lkult. I k argut·s that part of this stems from the closeness of the Notre Dame department of education in the early ·-ros. Since that happennl thne are not enough Notre I>a me graduates teaching in the secondary sd10ols pushing tht"ir stmknts to play li>othall !(>r Notre Dame. !-'or such a series of logkal blunders to be made hy one is amazing -especially when that man is the second most visible memht·r of our pres­
tigious liberal arts school. Let us look at his errors: ! . He complains how. hard it has been to recruit, yet almost every major independent sports publications say that Notre Dame has had outstanding recruiting years since Faust came to the University. 
2. Our esteemed coa~;h assumes that high school teachers jump up and down, rant and rave, and practically hold a gun to the heads of football players to force them to go to their alma-mater. This may happen from time-to­time, hut a lot less frequently than he seems to think. Dear reader, how many teachers ever told you their alma-mater? .). Notre Dame's department of education closed down only a little over 10 years ago. This may seem to be a long time, hut it is relatively short as far as teachers arc con­cerned. Because of declining enrollments in tht· past I 0 years, a great majority ofthe teach­ers in the public schools have taught for 1'5 or more years. 
4. Many private school teachers never at­tended a school of education, thus Notre Dame's lack ofone is irrelevant in these cases. '5. But of course, the clincher. Notre Dame graduates 2'5 or more persons liscensed to tt·ach (and even more Saint Mary's students) thanks to the fine and well-respected joint program with Saint Mary's. So guess what? There arc indeed teachers out there -I am only one of many. So is this why Notre Dame lost to Michigan State and Miami? Mary[) doesn't make these kinds ofexcuses!

An Tostal audit 
Dear Editor: 

Your front page today will no doubt carry a tragic story regarding the theft of AnTostal funds. The person responsible came forward, confessed, and will he punished in accord­ance with University regulations. To repeat all the details is not necessary. 
From the beginning, I promised full dis­closure of the story to The Observer. I even mentioned to one reporter and to the editor that all facts would he released, except for one situation. In the event that a University dis­ciplinary action were necessary, confiden­tiality ofname and specific punishment would bt· withheld. Making restitution is nor punish­ment: it is a question of morality ar.d justice.

In fact, I had more meetings with Jay Reidy, the Chai.rman, than l had with any previous AnTostal chairman. The deficit, as explained in today's story. was not due to poor management, laxity, or a carefree, spendthrift attitude. The overall AnTostal event was enormously successful with the highest participation rate I have seen at Notre Dame. New events, such as the big picnic at Stepan, the noon-time concerts, the major act on Saturday, were well attended. 
The failure ofAnTostal came about because · of human fuilure. An all too human person on this campus was tempted and fell. Yes, I was let down, the AnTostal committee was let down, the Student Government was let down, the entire student body was let down by this person who made a serious mistake and misused student funds. 

What happened is an example ofwhat can happen in a student-run organiza­tion when dual or triple signatures are not re­quired for all disbursements. It is also an example ofhow funds can he misused when a faculty or administrative person's signature is not required. 
Fortunately, this person had come forward and contt:ssed and is repaying the money. Most importantly, this person needs to put a life back together. I submit that this case should be closed. We do not need to furthur execute this person on the pages of this 
newspaper or over WSND-AM.

this one coming in the third quarter. 
Green, under a heavy rush by Mike 
Gann, threw a desperation pass that 
was tipped by Jon Autry. Naylor 
grabbed the tipped pass and 
returned it to the USC 42. 
It took just five rushing plays for Notre Dame to go up by a 24-0 mar­gin. After Pinkett picked up nine yards on the first play, fullback Mark Brooks plowed for gains ofeight and nine yards up the middle. Pinkett then romped for seven and II yards on the next two plays, the latter run giving him his third touchdown of the afternoon. 
USC's lone score of the day came on a 36 yard pass interference call against Pat Ballage that set up Mic­hael Harper's one-yard touchdown run (this time he had possession of the ball). 
A 39-yard field goal by Johnston rounded out the scoring. 
While Pinkett and his mates on the offensive line grabbed most of the attention, it was the play of the Notre Dame defense that impressed USC Head Coach Ted Tollner the most. 
"Believe it or not, our defense played as well as well as it has all season," said Tollner. 
"We weren't sure that we could move the ball on the ground," con­tinued Toliner. "If we could have, it would have been a close game." 
The Trojans managed to pick up 
only I09 yards in 38 rushing at­
tempts against the Irish defensive 
unit. 

Although his interference penalty did set up the one Trojan score, cor­nerback Pat Ballage played an espe­cially outstanding game, as his nine tackles led the team. Time and time again he came up from his corner position to stop the vaunted USC "student body right/left" sweeps. 
The passing game for USC wasn't much better as it was limited to just II4 yards -almost one-hundred yards below its season average. 
Notre Dame may not have come out in its usual blue, but it did create some very blue feelings on the USC  sideline this afternoon.

McCallum blasted three yards into

Navy had two more chances to cut into Notre Dame's 21-12 lead, hut the Notre Dame defense simply put too much pressure on the gritty, hut outmanned, Navy team. McCal­lum and fullback Bryan Caraveo had respectable rushing days, but they were amazed with Notre Dame's ability not to give up the big play. 
"Their defensive secondary and linebackers really pursue the ball well," said McCallum, whose 92 yards in 24 carries was almost 70 yards short of his pre-game nation leading rushing average. "I couldn't go anywhere with them around," la­mented McCallum.

Coming off an injury, fullback Smith was another bright spot, as he gained 6<; yards in II carries while providing his usual outstanding blocking. 
Defensively, Mike Golic and Mike Kovaleski led the team with twelve tackles apiece. Golic, Mike Gann, and Eric Dorsey each had two quar­terback sacks, and Kovaleski chipped in on another one. 
"It wasn't a pretty game execution-wise," summarized Faust, "but it was an excellent game as far as hitting goes."

been ill with heart disease, 
pancreati..: disea.~e and various other 
ailments for about one year. 
Halas, born Feb. 2, 1895, was pioneer and patriarch of the Nation­al Football Legue. He was the last survivor of a group of men who founded and organized professional football in a Canton, Ohio, 
automobile agency in 1920. 
He played, he coached, he sold tickets and in tht: early days before tht: great media floods, ht: even wrote stories of the games and went to various newspapers to have results of the games printed. 
llai;L~ was around when the players passed hats throughout the stands to collect money and he was around when sponsors wt:rt: paying hundreds and thousands of dollars for a commercial minute on televi­sion. 
Despite the game's popularity today, it was a long and great struggle in the t:arly years. There were times Halas pa t id his players with lOlls and later, in tht: throes of the Great Deprt:ssion in the 1930s, llala.~ had to borrow $5,000 from the late sportsman Charles Ilidwill to kt:ep the Bears afloat. 
Aftt:r graduating from the Univer­sity of Illinois and a stint in the Navy during World War I, Halas briefly played right field for the New York Yankees until he broke a hip sliding into third base with a triple. 
The following year, Halas went to work for the A.E. Staley Co., in Decatur, Ill., "to learn the starch business" and became the firm's ath­letic director. 
Halas organized the Decatur Staleys football team and was in line for a promotion in the glucose department of the starchworks when the 1921 depression hit. The company couldn't underwrite the team any longer so "Mr. Staley gave me $5,000 to move the team to 
Chicago and call them the Staleys for one year." 
Hala.~ movt:d the team to Wrigley Field and the following year adopted the name of the Chicago Bears. Despite financial difficulties, Halas managed to hold onto the team. He was instrumental in changing the rules to step up scoring and modernized the game but it wasn't

their margin as Moseley missed field until 1925 that the game began "catching on." 
Then came the great maneuver. Halas eventually enticed Red Grange, the Galloping Ghost from Il­linois, to turn professional after negotiating a $100,000 deal with 
C.C. (Cash & Carry) Pyle, probably pro football's first noteworthy agent. 
On Thanksgiving Day in 1925, Grange made his professional debut and the Bears packed Wrigley Field with a crowd of36,000. 
"Ifthere had been room, we could have put in another 30,000," said Halas. "We went to New York and drew 65,000 the day after the Army­Navy game drew 60,000." It was the beginning Qf a coast-to-coast tour in which the Bears played 16 games from Nov. 26 through Jan. 31, inter­rupted by a two-week rest. 
Halas had turned pro football into a big time sport. 


Is this retirement? 

Borg continues to beat the best 
Associated Press 
BLOOMINGTON, Minn. -Bjorn 
Borg is retired from professional 
tennis, right? 
Then why is he still heating some 
of the best players in the world? 
Sunday night it was hard-serving 
Roscoe Tanner whom Borg defeated 
7-6, 7-6, to win the Merrill Lynch 
Tennis Cup in an exhibition at the 
Met Center. 
But Borg insists he is retired from competitive tennis forever. 
''I'm happy with the way I'm doing everything," the Swedish player said. "I play maybe five hours a week now, instead of 25. I like to stay in shape, but you have to work hard to train, and I like to do other things besides just tennis." 
Borg added, "I have no health problems or injuries ... I've always been lucky, but I've just decided to retire. The decision was hard to make, but now that I've made it, it's not tough anymore." 
Still, since his retirement in january, Borg has played exhibitions and a few tournaments because of prior commitments. And among those he's defeated in the last 10 months are Jimmy Connors, Ivan Lend! and john McEnroe. 
"Bjorn's game you can judge on the big points," Tanner said after losing the tie-breakers 7-3, 7-5.
