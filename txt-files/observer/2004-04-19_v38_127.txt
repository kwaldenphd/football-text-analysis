The LaFortune Ballroom was transformed into a hair salon Sunday afternoon as members of the Notre Dame community said goodbye to their hair for Locks of Love and Shaved Heads Against Cancer. 
Locks of Love makes wigs for financially disadvantaged children with long-term med­ical hair loss. People can donate 10 or more inches of their hair to be used for the wigs; shorter lengths can also be donated to help to offset costs of the program. Junior Lindsay Schirack said she wanted to coordinate an on­campus event for donations to Locks of Love and asked the Class of 2005 to sponsor it. 
Schirack said she was quite pleased with the turnout of 
136 participants, who donated a total of 1,411 inches of hair,. just under 118 feet. 
"I thought 20 [people com­ing] would be successful," she said. "But there were 20 peo­ple lined up before noon. It's absolutely overwhelming." 
Stylists from Atria 2 salon straightened, cut and pack­aged ponytails as a line wrapped around the ballroom. Participants were then given a card to come back to the salon to get a free styling. 
Donators had various rea­sons for giving up their long hair. But nearly everyone agreed they were donating because the hair goes to those in need. 
"It's just a really good cause," freshman Meredith Laux said. "I have a lot of hair and there are little kids who don't have any."

Despite the warm weather, the Christmas spirit prevailed for around 800 Notre Dame and Saint Mary's students who volunteered to do home improvement in a low-income neighborhood for the service project Christmas in April/Rebuilding Together Saturday. 
"It turned out to be a great day," said Darrell Paulsen, the faculty adviser for Christmas in ApriVRebuilding Together. "We had more students than we expected." 
According to Paulsen, a major probllml in the past has been students not showing up for the 7 a.m. departure time. Although the 900 students who signed up was down from pre­vious years. the percentage of students who signed up and actually participated was much higher. 
"We needed 650 [students to fill the sites]," Paulsen said. "We had 900 sign up, and we had 800 show up so that was very, very good. · 
"The weather couldn't have hurt either," he said. 
Paulsen also noted that groups such as the Notre Dame Fire Department and various athletic teams participated in the event. Of the 800 students, around 100 were from Saint Mary's, and faculty and staff members also worked on-site. 
Additionally, Notre Dame Food Services donated meals for the volunteers. 
"By all accounts it was a very successful day," Paulsen said. 
Pub owner cites video evidence 
Tape shows police pushing patrons into bar before raid 
By CLAIRE HEININGER News Editor 
Videotape evidence of patrons being forced into The Library Irish Pub during a police raid early Friday morn­ing may mean lesser penalties for the bar but will not change patrons' citations or punish­ments, police confirmed. 

Lt. Greg Deitchley, spokesman for the District 1 office of the Indiana State Excise Police. said the video would have no bearing on the approximately 27 citations issued to 17 minors, as those tickets were confirmed based on evidence police compiled as patrons exited the scene. 
Pub owner Chuck Hammons, however, said he will submit the video -used to track all patrons' presentation of iden­tification -to his attorneys to support his claim that several of the minors were actually pushed inside by police before his employees could verify their proof of legal age. 
Hammons "may have a defense" based on that evi­dence, Deitchley said, but maintained that excise police were not at fault. 
Since The Library's premises start where the sidewalk meets the front door -lead­ing to a vestibule where patrons wait before showing 
I. D. -excise police deter­mined that all patrons in the waiting area would be includ­ed in the sweep. Deitchley said that police will present a case report explaining these

On April 3, skilled laborers such as carpenters and electri­cians did preliminary work on the houses. The students and other volunteers provided unskilled labor such as paint­ing, repairing windows, work­ing on flooring and yard work. 
"The things we did were kind of like extreme home makeover goes South Bend style," said Sara Woolf, a fresh­man who participated in the project for the first time. "All the volunteers worked on dif­ferent jobs. At our house we did a lot of painting, yard work and built the family a sand­box."

Ne-w leprechauns chosen fro111 field of 17 applicants 
By AMANDA MICHAELS 
News Writer 
As the era of Leprechaun Mike comes to an end, the famous green suit has been passed into the hands of a new owner -Leprechaun Eddie. 
Keenan sophomore Edward Lerum was chosen Saturday night as the new Gold squad Leprechaun mascot, who per­forms at the football and men's basketball games, among other events. 
"I feel extremely excited, I don't think I understand yet about the commitment and everything that goes along with being the Leprechaun ­it just hasn't sunk it. But it's a great opportunity," said Lerum, who has wanted to be Leprechaun since his friends suggested it during their freshman year of high school. 
Dillon sophomore Kyle Chamberlin will serve as the Blue squad Leprechaun at soccer, volleyball and women's basketball games and various community events. 
The selection process start­ed months ago with a series of eight different clinics designed to prepare Leprechaun candidates for the rigors of auditions and beyond. Not all clinics were mandatory, as some trained students for the possibility of joining the cheerleading squad if they were not chosen as mascot, and applicants were not evaluated during this time. 
Seventeen candidates stayed for the audition process -a number that wa~

INSIDE CoLUMN 


The bust 
l think that deep down it is the dream of every college student who has turned 21 to be in a bar when it gets busted. Not to see people get in trouble, of course, but just to see what exactly what goes down without fear of getting into trouble. 
Thursday night, I and many other students got to experience this as Finnegan's (okay The Library) got busted for the sec­ond time in a year. The music stopped and people started saying they thought the bar was getting bust­ed. I figured that it was impossible ­I thought Excise would be more likely to bust a bar with more underage stu­dents (like a certain Finnegan's neigh­bor on Wednesday nights). 
But as police officers began to swarm through the bar and there were numerous announcements that no one could hear, the reality of the evening began to set in. And it was cool. For about five minutes. 
But then there is everything else associated with the bar bust that has to be dealt with, like the excruciating process of getting out of a busted bar. This involved a 45-minute wait before an officer from the Indiana State Police reviewed my two forms of identifica­tion and asked me several questions to prove my identity. My roommate even got asked what his sign was. 
And then there was process of notify­ing my friends here at The Observer that the bar was being busted and that they needed to send a reporter and a photographer. 
Contrary to popular belief, The Observer is not tipped off before a bar is busted (and many staffers have the Boat Club citations to prove it). Instead, there is a network of carefully placed informants in bars across South Bend every night, waiting for a bar bust. After all, us retired top staff members still have an important role to play in this newsgathering organization. 
But the editor working Thursday night thought that my bust report was a test of his gullibility and didn't believe me. It took repeated calls and getting another Observer staffer at the bar to call him before he agreed to send a reporter. 
But there are some benefits -or at least interesting things that happen when you are in a bar that busted. I ran into some familiar faces at Excise Police. One officer who busted the tail­gate party I was attending at Purdue and busted the tailgate party I was at for the Florida State here at Notre Dame was in attendance at the Finnegan's bust. Apparently he finds the busts in Gary more fun because they involve "dope." 
So after this third encounter with Excise, I think I can pretty much pick out any member of the Michigan City division and forewarn minors of their presence. And I have a cool story to tell my kids some days down the road to warn them about' the dangers of underage drinking. Wink, wink.

Ford upset by ad showing decapitation 
DEARBORN, Mich. ­Ford Motor Co. is upset by the release of an Internet advertisement that depicts the decapitation of a com­puter-animated cat by a power moonroof hatch, saying it didn't authorize the clip. 
The ad for the Sportka, a hatchback sold in Europe, shows the realistic-looking orange cat climbing on top of the car and poking its head into the open moon­roof, The Detroit News reported Sunday. The hatch slides closed, the cat struggles briefly and its headless body slides to the ground. 
Ford says the clip was conceived without its approval by ad agency Ogilvy & Mather as part of a "viral marketing" cam­paign for the Sportka. "Viral marketing," a type of e-mail marketing, is the electronic version of word of mouth, usually inviting recipients to forward an e­mail to others. Pet food fire destroys office 
LIBERTY. N.C. -Bags of decomposing pet food apparently spontaneously combusted, causing a fire that destroyed the office of an animal rescue group last weekend, investigators said. 
Water had apparently leaked into bags of stock­piled dog and cat food at the Happy Hills Animal Foundation, causing the food to begin rotting, fire inspector Wendell Whatley said. The decomposition process generated heat that could not escape from the stacked bags. 
Investigators said some bags lower in the stacks had burned from the inside out, suggesting sponta­neous combustion.

NDPI students attend air show 

Courtesy of Notre Dame Pilot Initiative Senior Bryce Harward and a classmate from the Notre Dame Pilot Initiative look at a single engine Cessna training aircraft at an alrshow for the Initiative at the South Bend Regional 
Airport Thursday. 
By MATI BRAMANTI Senior SraffWrirer 

After months in the class­room, student aviators from the Notre Dame Pilot Initiative were treated to an air show all their own Thursday. Held on the tarmac at the South Bend Regional Airport, the event brought 11 aircraft and their pilots to the field. 
The Initiative is the parent organization that hosts a course entitled "Introduction to Principles of Flight," num­bered AS398. 
The three-credit course is open to all students and pre­pares them -many of whom 
are pursuing a private pilot's license to enter primary flight training. 
The concept behind the flight course has a 30­year history at the University, but due to liabili­ty concerns, had been on hiatus for many years. The course was resurrected in fall 2003, and has taught 90 young aviators in two semesters. 
While the course is taught

in a classroom, a great deal of the real learning happens at the airport, said instructor and licensed pilot Jeff Newcamp, a senior aerospace engineering major. 
"It was a unique opportunity for students to gain exposure to general aviation aircraft," Newcamp said. "The air show is the first opportunity for the students to sit in the cockpit." 
Clad in yellow T-shirts bear­ing the slogan "Fly Like a Champion Today," the 50 stu­dents spent Thursday's class time chatting with pilots and looking at airplanes. 
While the course's content focuses on the theory and knowledge underlying pow­ered flight, the annual air show provides some hands-on education on actual aircraft. While safely on the ground, students sat in cockpits and gained familiarity with aircraft controls and instrumentation. 
Instructor Joe Friel, a senior electrical engineering major, said the show provides experi­ences that cannot be replicat­ed in the classroom. 

"It gives the students time to look at the flight instruments and understand what it is like to be [the] pilot in command," Friel said. 
Support for the air show ­as well as the number of air­craft on display -has grown since the inception of the course last fall. 
Special guests included WNDU pilot Rich Voigt and his Bell nanger helicopter ­known to Michiana residents as "NewsChopper 16." 
In addition, Family Viqeo provided a twin-engine Cessna 
Citation business jet. Bob Dunn, a professional spe­cialist in the College of Engineering, had his powered para­chute on display, and members of the Wings Flying Club brought two single-engine Cessna training aircraft. Rounding out the list of aircraft were a Piper Saratoga, Piper Archer, Mooney Mite, F35 Bonanza and a Bell 222 medical 

airlift helicopter. 
Sophomore Rob Schrimpf said the show complemented the course's formal work and gave many students an inti­mate look at general aviation. 
''I'm not sure students in the class have been close to light airplanes before," Schrimpf said. "The air show was the best class of the semester." 
By May, the course's stu­dents will be qualified to take the FAA written exam, the first step in becoming a pri­vate pilot. 
Newcamp said Notre Dame is no stranger to aeronautical training. 
"These students are continu­ing a rich tradition of aviation at Notre Dame," Newcamp said. "[It] stems back to the early days of [Father] Albert Zahm and his glider experi­ments atop LaFortune. "

Spring Day on Campus draws 130 prospectives

News Writer 
Saint Mary's annual Spring Day on Campus brought 130 prospective students and their families to the College Sunday. 
The event is geared toward high school juniors, or those students who are just begin­ning their college search, and is designed to familiarize stu­dents with the College. This year's event attracted mostly juniors, and a few sopho­mores, who came from 11 dif­ferent states including Florida and Texas. 
It was the largest turnout for the event in the past several years. as only 92 attended last year, 120 in 2002 and 100 in 2001, admissions counselor Kate Coulston said. 
The event kicked off at 9:30 
a.m. with an opening prayer service and formal welcome. The families then attended forums regarding the general admissions process, require­ments for acceptance into the College and financial planning. 
The prospective students were invited to attend a stu­dent panel discussion to have an opportunity to get some of

In the afternoon, the stu­dents and their families were taken on an extensive tour of the campus. having an oppor­tunity to see residence halls and academic buildings. At the conclusion of the tour every­one was invited to a compli­mentar.y lunch in the dining hall. 
Spring Day on Campus con­cluded in the Angela Athletic Facility where prospective stu­dents had the opportunity to meet with professors, adminis­tration and faculty to discuss their academic interests and goals. They also had a chance to speak with coaches about varsity athletics and represen­tatives from campus clubs and organizations. 
This is the 23rd year that Saint Mary's has conducted the Spring Day on Campus event.

"If we can help any woman in following her life in the way of Christ, that would be our desire," Frieders said. 
Those women who are strictly discerning a religious life can visit the sisters to decide what paths they poten­tially can take within the dif­ferent religious communities. 
"Those women who are not looking for a religious voca­tion can come and share their dreams and goals for a more fulfilling life in Christ," said Sr. Gladys Marie.

"As a non-Catholic, it's very lovely," said visitor Helen Rudolph. 
"You don't even have to be a religious to come here," said Betty Strantz, another open house visitor. 
Giving the center a new face now allows the sisters to "pro­vide a place for someone to see what [the sister's] life is like," Frieders said. 
Mary's Solitude is simply a place where a woman, through journaling, prayer, reflection and retreat can explore the religious life or whatever career or vocation God may be calling her to.

Over two years ago, a meta­morphosis began on the Saint Mary's campus as Holy Cross Sisters worked to transform the Mary's Solitude retreat center into a place of discern­ment for· women. 
Nestled behind the convent at Mary's Solitude, there is a long cement porch that over­looks a cluster of trees and a beautiful sunset. 
"Look at that sunset. I love this porch,"

Sudan war displaces 50,000 
NAIROBI, Kenya -At least 50,000 people have fled their homes in recent weeks because of militia attacks and fighting between Sudanese government and rebel forces in southern Sudan, the United Nations said Sunday. 
The clashes between the government forces and the Sudan People's Liberation Army rebels occurred despite a cease fire between the warring parties, which are involved in talks to end the country's 21-year civil war. 
The cease-fire, signed in October 2002, is supposed to remain in force as long as talks continue. But there were no immediate indi­cations that the fighting would derail the negotiations.

A group of 21 American correctional offi­cers, along with two Turks and an Austrian officer, were leaving the detention center after a day of training in northern Kosovo on Saturday when they came under fire from at least one member of a group of Jordanians on guard at the prison, said Neeraj Singh, a

That won't happen, several residents said, , until Sjodin's killer is brought to justice. 
"It kind of brought some closure, but it rekindled a little fire under it," said Chris Melberg, 22, who graduated from high school here with Sjodin. Melberg said anger at Alfonso Rodriguez Jr., the man charged with kidnapping Sjodin, is fueling the fire.

Bremer says Iraq security not ready 
Administration questions future presence of U.S. troops in Iraq after June 30 
Associated Press 
BAGHDAD, Iraq -Iraqi security forces will not be ready to protect the country against insurgents by the June 30 handover of power, the top U.S. administrator said Sunday -an assess­ment aimed at defending the continued heavy pres­ence of U.S. troops here even after an Iraqi govern­ment takes over. 
The unusually blunt com­ments from L. Paul Bremer came amid a weekend of new fighting that pushed the death toll for U.S. troops in April to 99, already the record for a single-month in Iraq and approaching the number killed during the invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein last year. 
The military had always planned to remain after June 30, when the U.S. is to handover sovereignty to Iraq. In recent months coali­tion officials acknowledged the transfer of security will be significantly slower than hoped because Iraqi forces were not prepared. 
But Bremer said the fight­ing across the country this month exposed the depth of the problems inside the security forces.

cut down to nine last Monday. The nine remaining were sub­jected to a panel judging of their performance in various situations, including opening a football pep rally, appearing at an event and being questioned on numerous subjects by a media personality. 
"Auditions were extremely competitive ... I felt mine went pretty well, but you could hear the crowd reaction for all the other candidates, and they were great for everyone," said Lerum. 
The top five scores were 
brought in for a one-on-one interview to see, as cheerlead­ing coach Janette Minton said, "which one [had] the right heart." Lerum said the inter­views were relaxed and cov­ered topics such as social and family life. 
The winners were announced that night, so those who were not selected had the opportunity to attend cheer­leading try-outs the next day. 
"We choose someone that has a magnetic charisma, that would be able to communicate without words; someone gen­uine and honest, with a high level of integrity," Minton said. "A lot of people might want to be Leprechaun for self-notori­ety, instead of doing it to build spirit for the teams." 
Lerum said that he plans to keep in contact with current Gold squad Leprechaun Michael Macaluso for advice, and will spend the summer thinking up ideas for the fall's pep rallies and football games. 
Though there are no physi­cal requirements -not even gender -Minton said she did encourage the Leprechauns to try to grow a beard. 
"I already have a beard," Lerum said. ''I'm about 5-foot­6, and though I'm blond, my facial hair is actually red, strangely enough. I'm Irish, so I guess I have that look."

year, including Microsoft's. The company may not make any surprise announcements, but investors are looking to it to find ways to increase its profits since the next ver­sion of its Windows operat­ing system isn't due until 2006. 
With almost $53 billion in cash and short term invest­ments, Microsoft could go acquisition hunting, though its wrangling with regula­tors makes anything beyond a strategic niche purchase unlikely. It also could share more of its wealth with investors, either with a one­time special dividend or by raising its payout on an annual basis. 
Now that it has dealt with a series of legal issues in the United States and abroad, the company may be willing to do just that, though probably not next week, Rudy said. 
It recently settled patent and antitrust suits with Sun-Microsystems Inc., InterTrust Technologies and AT&T Corp., and last year it put to rest claims by Time Warner Inc. involving Netscape Communications. And most of the uncertainty surrounding its European Union antitrust case was dispelled last month, when EU regulators ruled against it, ordering sanctions and a big fine. Microsoft is appealing the decision. 
Even without something to jog the stock in the near future, Microsoft's stock is likely to rise ahead of the much-anticipated launch of the new version of Windows. But that doesn't seem to be inspiring buyers now. 
"Everyone believes the stock is stuck in neutral. That really seems to be the expectation, and that's real­ly not the case," said Rudy, noting that the company produced steady growth throughout the recent downturn.

Air America Radio's signal was pulled Wednesday from two stations in both cities by MultiCultural Radio Broadcasting Inc. fol­lowing a disagreement over payments. 
Air America said Thursday it had obtained a temporary restraining order against Multicultural "forcing them to put us back on the air." The order, which was filed in New York where Multicultural is based, does not apply to Los Angeles, however. 
Air America chairman Evan Cohen said the company had not asked the court to act in Los Angeles, and was pursuing other options there, including finding a new "more respon­sible and mature" business partner. 
Efforts to contact MultiCultural for com­ment were not successful.

DENVER -A federal jury acquit­
ted two former Qwest executives 
Friday of improperly booking nearly 
$34 million in revenue and then 
lying to auditors and the FBI about 
it. The jury issued a partial acquit­
tal for a third executive and dead­
locked in the case against a fourth. 
The men were charged with fraud and conspiracy in a $100 million deal in 2001 to link Arizona schools to the Internet. Prosecutors said the four conspired to declare the rev­enue before the purchases were made and then lied to accountants and investigators. 
After nearly two weeks of deliber­ations, thy jury cleared John Walker and Bryan Treadway of all charges. 

Grant Graham, a former chief financial officer at Qwest, was acquitted of three charges and a mistrial was declared when the jury failed to agree on eight remaining charges. The jury could agree on any of the 11 charges against Thomas Hall, a former senior vice president. 
Assistant U.S. Attorney William Leone said a decision on whether to retry the case would be made with­in two weeks. 
"They lumped me in," Walker said after the verdict. "The FBI and U.S. Attorney's Office never spoke to me before they indicted me." 
A lawyer for Treadway, who declined comment, said his client was grateful to the jury for exoner­ating him. 
"We've said all along these charges were baseless," said the lawyer, Stephen Cowen. 
It was the first criminal trial stemming from investigations that prompted former the Qwest chief executive Joseph Nacchio to quit in 2002 and ultimately led the Denver­based telecommunications giant to remove $2.5 billion in revenue from its books. 
Qwest provides telephone services in 14 states in the West and Midwest.

understand the 
importance of 
sleep. 
"Generally, the people I 
know, we don't see sleep as 
that important compared to 
what school and the curricu­
lum have to offer," said 
Marcel Yang, a Duke fresh­
man from Chapel Hill. 
Lack of sleep among college 
students is an old problem, 
but one that appears to be 
getting worse, according to 
some national surveys. 
College students sleep an 
average of six to seven hours 
a night, down from seven to 
seven and a half in the 1980s. 
Last month, the University of 
Michigan held a national con­
ference on sleep, stress, 
depression and college stu­
dents. Sleep deprivation can 
hurt academic performance 
and increase stress levels. 
James Clack, Duke's direc­
tor of counseling and psycho­
logical services, said the lat­
est research shows that col­
lege-age people should be 
getting nine hours of sleep a 
night. 
"They begin to get into a pattern of sleeping four to five hours," he said. "They really think it doesn't bother them, but that really isn't the case." 
Duke wants students to consider adequate sleep a part of overall wellness. One idea is to do individual health assessments for each student and set goals for good nutri­tion, exercise and plenty of shuteye. 
"They're coming in to see us, and they're ragged," said Ryan Lombardi, assistant dean of students. "We get e­mails and calls in the middle of the night at ungodly hours." 
Those schedules have even affected Duke's class times. Students have shunned 8 
a.m. classes to the point that many departments stopped offering them. When campus planners looked over the schedule, they realized that, over the years, most classes had been squeezed into the hours between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. 
"That suits many students just fine," said Judith Ruderman, vice provost. "But we couldn't exist like that." 
Duke was running out of classroom space, and stu­dents were beginning to com­plain about the availability of courses. So administrators worked out a new schedule for the fall, spreading classes more evenly throughout the day and week. 
The result: no more 8 a.m. classes, but plenty starting at 
8:30 a.m. That will still be a shock to some students who have never had 
advice to sleep­walking stu­dents? Take an afternoon nap.

Three astronauts blast off for space station 
Associated Press 
BAIKONUR -A Russian rock­
et roared into space Monday 
carrying an American, a Russian 
and a Dutch man to the interna­
tional space station on the third 
manned mission since the halt of 
the U.S. shuttle program. 
American Michael Fincke, Russian Gennady Padalka and Andre Kuipers of the Netherlands, representing the European Space Agency, were to spend two days. en route to the ISS aboard the Soyuz TMA-4 spacecraft. The Russian-built capsule is the only means to get to the orbital outpost since the suspension of U.S. space shuttle flights following the February 2003 Columbia disaster. 
"Our Russian partners are picking up the ball," Fincke, 37. said. "It's very symbolic what we can do when people all over the world work together." 
Just before boarding the spacecraft, the trio paused to wave farewell to relatives.. space officials and others who had traveled to the desolate Baikonur cosmodrome, in the steppes of Kazakhstan. Padalka held up two fingers in a victory sign, Fincke gave a thumbs-up and Kuipers brandished a clenched fist.

space officials watched the crew on a monitor from Russian Mission. Control outside Moscow. The three astronauts waved and blew kisses from inside the cap­sule before blasting off. They shook hands after the spacecraft entered orbit approximately nine minutes after the 7:19a.m. 
(11:19 p.m. EDT Sunday) lift-off, having shed its boosters along the way. 
Applause rippled through Mission Control as the space­craft reached orbit and its solar panels unfolded. 
Padalka and Fincke, who were initially trained to fly on a U.S. shuttle, will spend 183 days on the space station. Kuipers will return after nine days with the station's current crew, U.S. astronaut Michael Foale and Russian cosmonaut Alexander Kaleri, who have been in orbit since October. 
The mission fulfills a lifelong dream for Fincke, a Pittsburgh native who as a child donned cardboard wings and made his siblings play Star Trek. 
"He always knew that he would fly," Fincke's father Edward said before the launch. ''I'm so happy. I want to cry." 
Fincke became the only one of his four brothers to follow their father's path and join the U.S. Air Force.

SPAIN 

~eader orders troops home 
Associated Press 

MADHID -Spain's prime 
minister on Sunday ordered 
Spanish troops pulled out of 
Iraq as soon as possible, ful­
filling a campaign pledge to a 
nation recovering from terror­
ist bombings that al-Qaida 
militants said were reprisal 
for Spain's support of the war. 
Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero issued the abrupt recall just hours after his gov­ernment was sworn in, saying there was no sign the United States would meet his demand for United Nations control of the postwar occupation -his ultimatum for keeping troops there. 
Zapatero's Socialist party won the March 14 general election amid allegations that outgoing Prime Miqister Jose Maria Aznar, by backing the war in Iraq, had provoked dommuter-train terrorist bombings that killed 191 peo­ple three days before the vote. 
Though Zapatero had prom­ised to remove Spanish troops, his immediate action was a bombshell, and a set­back for the United States as Spain's new foreign minister prepared to travel to Washington to discuss the dis­pute. 
The Bush administration has been eager to maintain an international veneer on the increasingly besieged coali­tion force in Iraq, which is dominated by its 130,000 American troops. 
In a five-minute address at the Moncloa Palace, Zapatero 
said he had ordered Defense 
Minister Jose Bono to "do 
what is necessary for the 
Spanish troops stationed in 
Iraq to return home in the 
shortest time possible." 
He cited his campaign 
pledge to bring the 1,300 
troops in Iraq home by June 
30, when their mandate 
expires, if the United Nations 

failed to take political and 
military control. 
"With the information we 

have, and which we have 
gathered over the past few 
weeks, it is not foreseeable 
that the United Nations will 
adopt a resolution" that satis­
fies Spain's terms by its dead­
line, Zapatero said. 
The latest polls show 72 percent of Spaniards want the troops withdrawn. 
The gov~rnment did not say when it would start removing its forces. but officials in Cairo said Egyptian Foreign Minister Ahmed Maher was told by his Spanish counter­part, Miguel Angel Moratinos, that Spain would pull out of Iraq in 15 days. The officials spoke on condition pf anonymity. 
Egypt's foreign ministry later backtracked from that in a statement, however, saying the Spanish leader said "the date will be announced in Iraq and has not yet been fixed." 
In Washington, U.S. officials said Zapatero's announce­ment was not a surprise. 
"We knew from the recent Spanish election that it was the new prime minister's intention to withdraw Spanish 
troops from the coalition in 
Iraq," said a White House 
spokesman, Ken Lisaius. "We 
will work with our coalition 
partners in Iraq and the 
Spanish government and 
expect they will implement 
their decision in a coordinat­
ed, responsible anO. orderly 
manner." 

Mariano Rajoy, who ran 
against Zapatero in the elec­
tion after Aznar decided not 
to seek another term, said the 
decision made Spain "much 
more vulnerable and weak in 
the face of terrorism in the 
face of terrorism." 

Zapatero has "thrown in the 
towel" rather than try to 
exhaust all possibilities of get­
ting a U.N. resolution to meet 
his demands, Rajoy said. 

But many other politicians praised Zapatero, including Jose Antonio Labordeta, a congressman from a small party based in Aragon in the northeast. 
"What Zapatero did is keep his word, which is rare in this country. For the first time, we have come across a politician who keeps his word," Labordeta told the news agency Efe. 
Bono, the defense secretary. is reported· to have met secretly in Washington with Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld on April 5. 
Moratinos, the foreign sec­retary, said he will travel Tuesday to Washington to dis­cuss Spain's plans with Secretary of State Colin Powell and National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice.

TODAY'S STAFF 
The April 16 editorial in this paper went to curious lengths to defend the administration on the issue of Taco Bell contracts and Fair Trade coffee. It likewise made a special effort to condemn the aggressiveness of the Progressive Roque Strew Student Alliance's tactics. The edito­rial presented a Straight, thoroughly flawed No Chaser and misleading take on both past history and present progress. 
I'll attempt here. by examining the claims and contradictions of the edi­torial, to add a sense of balance. First, to sum up why the PSA is cam­paigning-although many of you already know-I'll briefly relate the issues. A major tomato supplier to Taco Bell pays pickers starvation wages, unchanged since 1978. Taco Bell's advertising contract with Notre Dame athletics expires this semt)Stcr; the PSA wants the business relation­ship between Notre Dame and Taco Bell concluded, with a public state­ment affirming this. Fair Trade cof­fee is the other issue. The PSI\ would like to see Fair Trade coffee in the dining halls, assuring just wages to coffee growers in developing coun­tries. 
This two-pronged campaign has been a long one, with only fitful cooperation from the administration. Calling the "dialogue" between the administration and the PSI\ "produc­tive" is one of the editorial's mysteri­ous presuppositions. By what meas­ure was it productive? For example, let's turn to Claire Heininger's article in Thursday's Observer. Heininger reports that PSA members have met with Carol Kaesebicr since last fall. A letter went to Taco Bell on March 5. This succinctly illustrates tht~ com­mitment of the administration. Father Peter Jarret claims that it's merely "out of fairness and pru-

We've played the Mexican Aprill6 dence" that the administration won't likely make a statement any time soon, until hearing both sides. Why did it take months simply to get this minor letter out? Also, the editorial notes that a follow-up call was made. Guess why. Yes, because of the walk­in. Heininger reported this, too. This is the sum of the productiveness lauded by the editorial. 
Besides, the administration's dedi­cation to "fairness and prudence" is dubious. The PSA's meetings with Kaesebier ineludcd the presentation of a damning array of materials, including articles by the New Yorker and National Geographic on modern human slavery, detailing the working conditions of Immokalee tomato pick­ers. In December, the Hobert F. Kennedy Memorial Center for Human Hights urged Kacsebier to cancel Notre Dame's Taco Bell contract. The injustice is well-documented and unambiguous. 
It was ambitious, trying to mold Martin Luther King, Jr.'s quote­"Justice too long delayed is justice denied" -into an awkward, fatherly dictum. The editorial valiantly con­cluded with the quaint "Justice forced may disrupt justice forthcom­ing." I can't make heads or tails of this. It looks nice though, if you squint your eyes. Is it saying that "forcing" justice deserves reproach? More so than allowing injustice to endure? How something that hasn't yet arrived can be disrupted is beyond me. Ditto even for how justice can "disrupt" justice. Is there some innovative multi-tiered conception or justice hidden here? 
What the editorial is trying too hard to say, I'm guessing, is basically this: justice is on its way, so don't rush it. It urges patience. Looking deeper, it's really saying this: the administration will act when it deems it fiscally (not morally) prudent to do so-or when·'it fears its sterling image will be tarnished. They decide when "forthcoming" is; they can stall and forestall at their leisure. Humbly contending with the "slow-moving" 
Kafkaesque process is the dissident's 
proper task, suggests the editorial, while justice is hindered indefinitely. Justice has to wait its turn, appar­ently. 
Civil disobedience, the concept itself. seems totally alien to the writ­ers of the editorial. This explains in part the editorial's sheer incoher­ence. While mentioning civil disobe­dience at the beginning, the crux of their point is that we need to meekly acquiesce, that students who don't serenely accept the system's.indefi­nite delay of justice arc in the wrong. The PS/\'s "confrontational approach" follows only after the exhaustion of other approaches, after progress slowed to standstill. The "willingness to address students' concerns" was displayed in response to the PS/\'s tactics. Civil disobedience isn't as inC!Tcctivc at Notre Dame as the edi­torial believes. 
As well-intentioned as the editorial was, it only erected another obstacle in front of the PS/\'s campaign for justice. It did so by twisting and veil­ing the facts. It portrayed a fake dichotomy: the irrational dissidents versus the rational administration. But the most cursory glance over the history of the PSA's campaign reveals that immense patience was exercised only to go wholly unrewarded. Justice was trapped in a labyrinth of bureaucracy. Delays followed delays into dead ends. The PSI\ and the hunger strikers want only to speed justice out of the maze-and civil disobedience is helping.

Amendment 
The First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution states unequivocally the position of our forefathers regarding mat­ters of speech: "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; 
or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the govern­ment for a redress of grievances." 
Recently, the Federal Communications Commission levied almost $500,000 in "proposed forfei­ture" against Clear Channel Communications for ··indecent" broad­casts of Howati:l Stern's crude but popu­lar syndicated radio show. 
Josh Kaufman 
The News 
Record 

According to MTV.com, the FCC received a complaint from 
a listener in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., about several comments 
that were made on the show. The FCC ruled that there were 
three "indecency violations" committed during the broadcast 
in question and proceeded to fine Clear Channel $27,500 for 
each violation in each of the six markets the show aired. 
That adds up to a whopping $495,000 for a single broad­
cast. 
As a result, Clear Channel decided to permanently end its 
relationship with Stern and has pulled all broadcasts from 
the -airwaves, losing millions of dollars in revenue. 
"Mr. Stern's show has created a great liability for us and other broadcasters who air it," said John Hogan, president and CEO of Clear Channel Radio. "The Congress and the FCC are even beginning to look at revoking station licenses. That's a risk we're just not willing to take," 
Let's step back and think about this for a moment in its full context. Stern pushes the envelope of good taste and intends the content of his show to offend the listener. 
He succeeds in shocking someone, who calls up the gov­ernment. A regulatory agency, acting as sole judge, jury and executioner, labels Stern's show "indecent" and fines it out of existence. 
The proper question to ask in this case is: Indecent by what standard? 
What makes something indecent? Who gets to decide what is decent and what is not? If people's definitions of decency differ, how do you decide which has the greater validity? Is it possible to define decency in any objective way? 
No, it is not. 
Decency is in the eye of the beholder, as the concept relates to material that either corresponds to or offends that individual's sense of propriety. 
Any attempt to arbitrarily restrict what an individual can legally say smacks of totalitarianism, not a free society. 
Here is my honest appraisal of Stern's show: It is disgust­ing, crude, annoying, uneducated and oftentimes downright nasty. That is why I am glad I live in a society in which I am not forced to listen to him, and neither is anyone else. 
If you find Stern's material offensive, exercise your free­dom not to listen. The last time I checked, it was still possi­ble to change the station on a radio. 
It is intolerable to allow a bureaucrat to arbitrarily deter­mine what the remainder of the population can and cannot legally say (or listen to) by force of law. 
Aren't the airwaves public property? That's the probl~a1. As long as the gov~rnment controls the airwaves, under the alibi that it is for "the public good," we'll continue to have the same issue. 
To put the issue in perspective: What if the government retained legal control of the printing presses and burned every book that it found to be "indecent?" 
It's the same principal applied to a different medium. For reference, consider Nazi Germany and the burning of "degenerate" books by Jewish authors. 
In the words of Supreme Court Justice William 0. Douglas, "Restriction of free thought and free speech is the most dan­gerous of all subversions. It is the one un-American act that could most easily defeat us." 
Stern, no matter how lewd or disgusting his conversations, should not be silenced. 
Regardless of your personal opinion of his work, curtailing Stern's freedom of speech, and the freedom of others to lis­ten, damages us all.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR Formulate political opinions based on reality 
I am writing in response to Heather Phillips' April 16 letter. 
I am a member of the Class of 2000, writing from Chicago, where I have consistently been able to look beyond the liberal spin in the past year to formulate political opinions based on real­ity, not animus, spite and one man's career aspi­rations. 
It's laudable that Ms. Philips has decided to re­enter the political debate. In the last presidential election, barely over 50 percent of registered vot­ers participated. The apathy towards exercising this most fundamental right is simply abhorrent. 
Yet, with the right to vote comes responsibility -a term most often loosely affiliated with the liberal agenda. By this I mean a responsibility to weigh both sides of the argument, to cut through the left-leaning media spin and to take responsi­bility for the consequences of your vote. To accept the "ads on the Metro" or the agenda-laden mus­ings of MoveOn.org at face value is doing your­self, and the country as a whole, a grave diser­vice. 
If the Leninites at MoveOn.org really had the altruistic goals of rengaging the disenchanted many in the political process, they would be bet­ter served not to force those same people to choose one side over the other. Furthermore, if their intent was to create a more open, involved democratic process, they would be loathe to dis­regard Clinton's impeachment as a "waste of our nation's focus." You can label Bush a liar and call for his censure, but Clinton gets a pass? That's one for inclusion. 
And, for the record, the real "man of the peo­ple," John Kerry (estimated worth: $500 million) and his Democratic party have raised $100 mil­lion to this point. 
That's a lot of bake sales.

Commend, don't mock, the hunger strike 

I was appalled the other day when I was walking down South Quad and saw a "We love Taco Bell" sign hanging from a dorm window. This attempt at a joke is not funny; it is actually quite offensive. 
Not only does it show ignorance and uncaring for poor workers who suffer to produce products we buy, but it also is a slap in the face of our fellow stu­dents who are taking a stand against social injustices through protesting and hunger strikes. We should be proud of them, because on a campus that does not embrace much activism they are willing to work to have their demands heard. 
Whether or not you agree with their cause or motive, we ought to commend them for their devo­tion to it. A hunger strike is a serious thing and should not be turned into the joke of campus. Thank you to those students who are brave enough to take a stand and force the rest of us to come face to face with important issues outside our narrow world.

God. Country. Rock 'n' Roll? 
New revenues revitalize the music scene both on and off campus 
By C. SPENCER BEGGS Senior StaffWriter 
Notre Dame rocks ... at least it used to. Believe it or not, the Dome used to be a hotspot for some of the biggest music acts in the country when the JACC was still considered a large perform­ance venue and campus bands used to routinely play concerts on and off campus. While Notre Dame still pulls in an occasional big-name act, there. has been a remarkable decline in the stu­dent music scene. But a number of campus music enthusiasts see a silver lining with emerging venues and new talent. . 
WVFI Station Manager Emily Ear~man said that the campus music scene has struggled with a lack of appropriate venues and band name recognition in the past few years. 
"When I first got here there were these flagship bands, Umphrey's McGee had just grad­uated; now there're not really any big flagship Notre Dame bands. There are a couple bigger names but nothing that has been really consistent over the years," Earthman said. 
Other setbacks have included the Student Union Board's dis­continuation of NAZZ, the annual battle of the bands, after Station One was awarded the top prize in 2002. SUB Manager sopho­more Jimmy Flaherty said that the festival had run a deficit for three years before it was can­celed when SUB reviewed its budget and decided that it was too expensive to support. SUB's idea was to try to incorporate student bands into other pro­gramming. In addition, Flaherty proposed that interest in student bands would increase if Student Government brought more big­name acts to campus. 
"I think a lot of it has to do with stirring up interest in music on campus. In a year when we don't have any big concerts, the music scene is kind of dead," Flaherty said. "I think across the board you look at ND compared to other schools and we don't have big-name concerts, so I think Student Government needs to work with the Board of Trustees to develop a bank account or an endowment to bankroll bigger concerts." 
But a growing number of on­and off-campus venues for stu­dent bands have provided stu­dent bands with more venues. Earthman hopes that the grow­ing presence of Legends, the all­age campus club, pub and restaurant, will provide aspiring musicians with a good base to get momentum for their bands. 
"Legends is a really nice place to play; from the band standpoint I've heard a lot of really positive things about the sound equip­ment and space. From the stu­dent standpoint I think that word definitely gets around and they have a really good venue to play at that's [accessible] to students," Earthman said. 
Venues for student bands have been opening off campus as well. The State has featured campus band Station One and Club 23 has st?rted featuring a student band every Friday night at its apropos-named "Friday Night Bands at Club 23." 
Senior Adel Hanash, who works as a bouncer at Club 23, started the concert series after one of his roommates, a member of the campus band Kitsch, com­plained of the lack of off-campus venues. 
"Right now it seems that bands tend to play at parties and a cou­ple other venues around campus, but once there's a venue dedicat­ed to college music, it will help the music scene grow off-campus too," Hanash said. 
Even though Friday Night Bands got started late in the year, Hanash said that there had been a lot of enthusiasm for the series and has drawn large crowds to the diminutive Club 23 each week. 
"Club 23 is a really interesting music venue -it's pretty small, there's no stage but it's very inti­mate," Hanash said. "It's a lot of fun because the bands are right there." 

Hanash was initially concerned that the series wouldn't be suc­cessful because of the 21-year­old age limit on going to see a band play in a bar, but said that has not been the case because it features bands made up of most­ly upperclassmen like Station One, The Royal They and Kitsch, which tend to draw an older crowd. 
Senior Lawrence Santiago, lead singer of Station One, said that the campus music scene was beginning to be rekindled by bands that are starting to active­ly lead the way. 
''I'd say it's revitalizing. There's been an absence of quality bands and they're starting to resurface again," Santiago said. 
Santiago thinks that the music scene at Notre Dame will improve if bands work together to find new venues and help each other get gigs. Station One plays regularly on-and off-campus, though Santiago and his band mates remember when they began as freshmen playing for free at Higher Grounds. The band now gets paid for its per­formances at Club 23 and The State. Santiago said he hopes that Station One and other more established bands can help new talent emerge. 
"It take a solid band to step off­campus and promote themselves and open doors," Santiago said. "It also takes some unification among the bands to help each other and help promote the music scene." 
Earthman said that bands should make an effort to pro­mote themselves through cam­pus media to get the word out and to not get discouraged. 
"We've had great bands come out of Notre Dame -Chisel and Ted Leo, Sweep the Leg Johnny -and we have had great music in years past," Earthman said. "I think we can again in the future if people don't give up."

The triumphc Notre Darr 
The Student Union Boar a week-long schedule 
By PATRICK VASSEL 
Scene Wri[er 

Finals are approaching. Teachers have conspired to hit the student body with papers and projects all at the same time. Everything seems to be happening as part of a giant plan to stress you out. Wouldn't it be great if there were just a week of free events designed to reduce stress and let everyone just get out and have some fun? That's the question Notre Dame students decided to answer in 1967 with AnTostal, a tradition this year's Student Union Board is hoping to restore to its former glory. 
anTostal, which is Gaelic for "the festival," was a spring extravaganza that ran strong for thirty years before declining in the late 1990s. Other campus events of this time of year, such as the Fisher Regatta and the Bookstore Basketball finals, histori­cally took place as part of AnTostal week. Essentially a series of concerts, contests and events, many of which were out doors, defined anTostal dur­ing its most popular years. 
A glance through past yearbooks reveals the importance of the event to the student body with big name bands coming through, mud wrestling on 
the quads and free giveaways 
.throughout the week. New Student Union Board manager Jimmy Flaherty is excited about the week's events and hopes this year will solidi­fy the tradition for years to come. 
"It's a way to lift the stress on the student body, a last hurrah for the seniors, and hopefully it will get everyone pumped about the events we're planning for next year," Flaherty said. 
Officially beginning Sunday with a trip to Chicago for a Cubs game, anTostal features events every day of the week. On Tuesday, "The Daily Show" regular Mo Rocca will be speaking in DeBartolo 101. His smart and hilarious commentary on politics and current events is sure to be a great time. 
If students are unsure of what AnTostal is all about, Wednesday is sure to clear up their confusion. With free laundry in LaFortune, free pizza delivered to classes, tie-dying shirts on South Quad, free Boracho Burrito, a special concert featuring Zane Williams, and a quarter dog eating contest at the Huddle, Wednesday is just an average day during AnTostal week; but an outstanding day for the student body. 
Free pizza delivery continues on Thursday, which most students recognize as AcoustiCafe night. AnTostal AcoustiCafe is even better, though, featuring the best of Notre Dame's live per­formers at Legends, followed by a concert with one of the hottest new singer/song­writers in the country, Ari Hest. Hest is a native of New York and has toured col­lege campuses and small venues for the last sever­al years while writing songs and sharing stages with acts such as Maroon 5, Jason 
Mraz and O.A.R. 
"All the per­forming and tour­ing fits me. "I want to sing and play for people every night," Hest says on his Web site. 
llest, who recently signed with Columbia Records, is soon to release albums nationwide. Thursday is a great chance to see an amazing

Dude, where's my scene? 
The University of Texas is in Austin; so is Emo's. 
Lawrence has the University of Kansas and The 
Bottleneck. Both the University of Georgia and the 40 
Watt Club are in Athens, GA. And South Bend has 
Notre Dame and, well, we have a few houses where 
indie rock bands play. Sometimes. 
There must be something more to it, Cole Smith yes? South Bend wasn't just passed.by when the powers-that-be assigned clubs to the country's best college 
Scene Writer 
towns, was it? 
Maybe that's the first part of the problem--we don't live in a college town. We live in South Bend, Ind. College towns have bookstores and literary festivals. They have jazz clubs and theatres that show indie films. They have culture; we have the College Football Hall of Fame. 
College towns are peculiar organisms. The space between those two words forms a definite a barrier as the imaginary fence that seems to surround our cam­pus. This fence exists in neither Iowa City nor Berkeley. In Columbia, Miss., a small sign marks the corner of campus at the University of Missouri, but few notice it. There, campus breathes in the city with every green light. Streets don't dead-end as they approach the class­room buildings; letters arrive in campus mailboxes with the same zip code as the vintage shop two blocks down. Students are encouraged to be a part of the community, not merely to serve it for two hours on Saturday after­noons like some do here, as admirable as this work is, and their community is encouraged to participate in campus life. It's incredible, really. 
Things are different at Notre Dame. There's no place like it. In the latter parts of the 19th-century, students weren't allowed to leave campus without permission. South Bend, Notre Dame's urban sibling, must have been considered a dangerous place of crime. We're so much more sophisticated now -at least we respect our big brother's bars. 
No, something's still missing-there must be more to our lacking music scene than our absent college town. Something else must be the real key. Something like our taste in music. 
Notre Dame kids don't want to listen to indie rock. Seriously, it's not our fault. It's just not our style. We have dorm parties and laptop playlists varying from Dave Matthews to Outkast, and nothing in-between. We have football, and we run in our spare time. We dress like catalog models. And we don't embrace anything lo­
fi. 

Since we don't like it, we don't expect to hear it. Since artistic expression isn't central to campus life-once I heard someone call Notre Dame a 'jock school'-we sacrifice our expectations of student art. In a MINDSET (http://www.nd.edu/-mindset) feature on campus cover­band Bebop & Rocksteady, Paul Steinle writes "artistic vision is not a prerogative -Radiohead, they are not ­but hey, [Notre Dame] isn't N.Y.U." And he's absolutely right. However, this begs the inevitable 'why not?' Why are our expectations higher for students at New York University than Notre Dame -if these expectations may, and should, be seen as a central reason to our lacking creativity? Students here are arguably as tal­ented as our counterparts on the east coast. Is it simply because they've performed more, and flat out better, in the past? Probably -but that's our fault, not theirs. 
Its going to start when a few more music lovers not only perpetuate, but extend current events. We have empty garages on Bulla Road; we have The Mondays and Station One; we have kids that flat out love the music; and we've had one before. Ted Leo did it in the early nineties. If the name sounds familiar it's because he's a member of the class of 1993 -and was featured in both Rolling Stone and Spin last year. A handful of WVFI-sponsored compilations from the mid-nineties are hiding on a shelf at the station, waiting for someone to remember how brilliant music used to be at Notre Dame, to remember how people used to notice. The scene is still waiting out there for us, we just have to decide we want it. 
So start with college radio (http://wvfi.nd.edu). Start with campus bands (http://www.nd.edu/-mindset) and Legends shows (http://www.legendsofnotredame.org). Pay attention the next time a band picks up at a house party. So maybe South Bend isn't Austin or Lawrence or Iowa City-maybe we don't have their music scenes. But nobody is saying we can't.

Yankees earn first win against Red Sox since World Series 
Associated Prc;ss 
BOSTON -The New York Yankees turned themselves around -except for Alex Hodriguez and Jose Contreras. 
Derek Jeter went 2-for-4 with two walks and an RBI single in the six-run third inning, leading the Yankees to a 7-3 victory over the Red Sox. It was New York's first win against its archrival since turning Boston back just five outs from the World Series. 
"We got a good win today," said Rodriguez, who walked twice but was 0-for-4 on the day, dropping to 0-for-12 in the series and .156 on the year. "I'm going to be there offensively, there's no question in my mind. But it feels good to contribute in some other way." 
Contreras was spotted a six­run lead in the third, but Boston

It's going to be a great senior week so don't forget to sign up! 

Pineiro (1-1) allowed two runs, six hits and four walks in 6 2-3 innings and struck out five, a strong recovery after he was roughed up in his first two starts after signing a $14.5 mil­lion. three-year contract.. 
"You get rewarded for what you've done and for what you'll hopefully do, so that's in the past," said Pineiro, a 16-game winner last year. "I don't worry about contracts. I just want to be myself, be aggressive." 
Pitching coach Bryan Price cautioned against expecting Pineiro to turn into an ace because he signed a new deal. 
"It says we really like this guy. We really think he can do a super job," Price said. "But you can't always attach the dollar figure with the performance. He's still a young guy. He's going to have periods of greatness and times of struggle." 
Pineiro blew a 4-0 lead by allowing a pair of two-run homers in a no-decision at Anaheim last week and gave up eight runs in an April 7 loss to the Angels. The Mariners never worried, though, about their No. 2 starter. 
Twins 8, Royals 3 
When Minnesota lost Torii Hunter and Joe Mauer to InJUries, manager Ron Gardenhire asked his players to come together as team. 
They have responded with five straight victories. 
Jacque Jones had two dou· bles, a triple and four RBis, and the Twins beat the Kansas City Royals 8-3 Sunday to complete a three-game sweep. 
"Nothing surprises me in this clubhouse, these guys can play," Gardenhire said. "They're into it, pulling for each other and we're· having some fun out there." 
"We just want to keep putting pressure on the other team," Jones said. 
Lew Ford, playing in place of Hunter, made three great plays in center field while driving in his seventh run in five games. 
"You know its contagious and when some people are hitting good others follow," Ford said. ''I'm just doing whatever they need me to do." 
Minnesota's unselfish team play extended beyond the field. In the pregame ceremonies, Hunter gave his 2003 Gold Glove award to Jerry White, thanking the first-base coach for helping him throughout his major league career. 
Indians 9, Tigers 7 ,. 
Matt Lawton got Cleveland off to a good start and David Riske finally finished off a win. 
Lawton hit two homers, scored four runs and drove in four, and Riske earned the Indians' first save this season in a win over the Detroit Tigers. 
Cleveland's bullpen entered last in the AL with a 6.69 ERA, three blown saves and 58 hits allowed in 40 1-3 innings. 
"Riske was fantastic and 'Law' had a great day," Indians man· ager Eric Wedge said. "That's the David Riske we know." 
Carlos Guillen homered and had four RBls for Detroit, which lost center fielder Alex Sanchez to a strained left groin in the seventh inning. 
Sanchez barely made it to sec­ond on an RBI double -hop­ping the final 40 feet on his right leg and falling on the base. He was helped to his feet by trainers, who assisted him to the dugout. 
' . 
scored twice in the bottom half and knocked him out after 2 1-3 innings, the shortest of his 11 major league starts. With Paul Quantrill (1-0) pitching, Rodriguez threw out Manny Ramirez on a close play at the plate and Travis Lee made a diving stop on Jason Varitek's grounder, throwing back to the pitcher to barely beat the run­ner to first base. 
"That probably decided the 
0 

game," Boston's Kevin Millar said. 
Mariners 4, Rangers 2 
Joel Pineiro knew he would regain command of his curve­ball, and that victories would follow. 
Raul Ibanez hit a two-run homer, Bret Boone and Scott Spiezio added solo shots, and the Seattle Mariners beat the Texas Rangers for their first series victory this season.

Cink wins MCI Heritage 
Associated Press 
HILTON HEAD ISLAND, S.C. -Stewart Cink wants people to remember his nine-stroke comeback and gutty victory in five playoff holes at the MCI Heritage, not whether he broke a rule on his most criti­cal shot. 
"What I was afraid of is somehow I win this tourna­ment and there may be ques­tion marks about it or an asterisk," he said. "And if that's the case, I'm really sorry." 
Cink birdied No. 16 Sunday
K ( ! to beat Ted Purdy after knock­ing a shot from a waste bunker about 6 feet from the hole. . Television viewers called in saying Cink broke a rule by removing loose stones and impediments before his clutch bunker shot and PGA officials watched about 10 replays of the shot with Cink before rul­ing it legal. Cink and Purdy had asked PGA Tour tournament director Slugger White at the tee what he could clean up around his ball. TV cameras showed Cink crouched down picking up debris around his ball, and what looked like a line visible in the crushed shell surface. Then Cink struck a mar­velous shot into the sun that set up a birdie putt. After Purdy made par, Cink rolled in it for first victory since he won his tournament 
in 2000. 
Cink raised his putter in tri­umph, was given the tartan winner's coat and posed smil­ing. with his trophy. Then the drama began. 
"I didn't see a sand line," White said. "It looked like what he removed he was legally able to." 
"I knew I had done nothing wrong," Cink said. 
Purdy didn't see Cink's set up. Even if he did, he certain­ly didn't want his first PGA Tour win handed to him on a technicality. 
"I didn't bring it up," Purdy said. "But it was some shot." 
Cink and Purdy shook hands as White explained the ruling, finally ending a long tourna­ment day. 
"Honestly, it was a little stressful because you play and you win and you play great and you're proud and then all of a sudden you've got some­thing you need to address," Cink said. "So I'm not quite as happy as I was." 
Cink had six birdies and an eagle to catch Purdy at 10­under 274. Purdy started the round with a four shot lead, but struggled to a 2-over 73. 
Ernie Els shot a 69 to finish in a tie for third at 8-under, his same score of a week ago when he lost by a stroke to Phil Mickelson at the Masters. 
Cink's winning birdie came after he and Purdy matched pars for four holes. It also was the second-biggest comeback 
on the PGA Tour since Paul 
Lawrie rallied from 10 strokes 
down to win the 1999 British 
Open. 
It was the third career victo­
ry for a player remembered 
most before now for missing 
an 18-inch putt at the U.S. 
Open in 2001 that would've 
gotten him into a playoff. 
"I've worked really hard on 
my game. I've been through 
some really tough stuff," Cink 
said. "And mentally, I've been 
to the bottom of the barrel and 
back." 
Cink was so far back he teed 
off nearly two hours before 
Purdy, the 54-hole leader bid­
ding for his first PGA win. 
Then again, Cink's got a 
knack for charging late at 
Harbour Town Golf Links. In 
2000, Cink trailed Els by five 
shots here before a closing 65 
got him the victory. 
"I've been around here long 
enough to know that rarely 
does it finish that way," Cink 
said. 
Purdy had a chance to win in regulation with a birdie putt inside of 10 feet on No. 18, but he slipped it left to lead to the ..tournament's third playoff in 
four years. 
"That was the easiest putt 
you can have, pretty straight 
putt," he said. "And I guess I 
was a little jumpy and I pulled 
it." 
Purdy also missed a 15-foot 
try on the first extra hole that 
would have given him a victo­
ry.

Jenkins claims Blue Angels Classic title 
Associated Press 

MILTON, Fla. -As six Navy jets roared overhead in tight for­mation, Tom Jenkins' latest Champions Tour victory didn't seem as important to him. 
"It's hard not to think about the military and all the men and woman that are serving our country r:i.ght now," he said. "Here we are playing a little golf tournament. It gets you to think about that, and how much we all should appreciate they're fighting for our freedoms." 
Jenkins' victory in the Blue Angels Classic was his frrst on the over-50 circuit this year and the fifth of his career. He fmished five strokes ahead of Rodger Davis with an 7-under 63 fmal round. 
The eighth winner in as many tour events this year, Jenkins fin­ished with a 14-under 196. Davis was at 201 while Gil Morgan, Jim Ahern and Wayne Levi tied for third another stroke back at 202. 
The Blue Angels precision fly­ing team, based at nearby Pensacola Naval Air Station, made two passes over the Moors Golf Club. 
Jenkins' winnings include a tro­phy depicting a Blue Angels jet, $225,000 in prize money and an invitation to ride in the back seat of the one of the team's F/A-18 Hornets in February. 
"Oh man, I tell you what, I hope I can muster up enough courage," Jenkins said. "That will be a thrill of a lifetime." 
Morgan was the second-round leader and started the day a stroke ahead of Jenkins, who immediately caught up with a birdie on the par-4, 406-yard frrst hole. Morgan bogeyed the next hole to cede a one-stroke lead to Jenkins, who made par. 
Jenkins never gave up the lead. He birdied four of the next seven holes while Morgan continued to shoot par. Only a bogey on the par-4, 426-yard 6th hole marred Jenkins' surge. He took a four­stroke lead over Morgan going into the back nine.

Associated Press 
MIAMI -Thanks to rookie Dwyane Wade's he~:oics, the Miami Heat started the playoffs the same way they ended the regular season: by winning. 
Wade sank a 7-foot jumper with 1.3 seconds left, and the Heat stayed hot by beating the New Orleans Hornets 81-79 in Game 1 of their Eastern Conference series. 

The Heat earned their first playoff berth in three years with a 17-4 finish, and they closed strong against the Hornets after some shaky moments in the fourth quarter. 
New Orleans trailed 77-65 midway through the period, but rallied to tie the game on P.J. Brown's jumper with 54 seconds left. 

Miami's third consecutive turnover gave the Hornets a chance to take the lead, but Lamar Odom stymied J?aron Davis on a drive, leading to a shot clock violation with 11 sec­onds to go. 
Following a timeout, Wade went to work from the point. He drove past Davis into the lane, then threw up a shot over 6-foot­11 Jamaal Magloire that put the Heat ahead. 
Caron Butler tipped the Hornets' ensuing inbounds pass to seal the win. Game 2 in the best-of-seven series will be Wednesday in Miami, where the Heat have 13 wins in a row. 
The opener drew a Miami playoff-record crowd of 20,102, with most fans clad in black. The Heat made the mood festive

'' 
rather than funereal, even though they missed 14 consecu­tive shots in the second quarter to fall behind by 10 points, then struggled again down the stretch. 
The Heat cranked up their fast break in the second half to take the lead, and managed to match the bigger Hornets in rebounds with 51. Defense helped too, with Miami limiting All-Star cen­ter Magloire to 14 points on 5­for-14 shooting. 
Wade had 21 points· and five assists. Odom. a five-year veter­an making his postseason debut, added 17 points and 11 rebounds. 
Pistons 108, Bucks 82 
Detroit's defense completely shut down the Milwaukee Bucks. 

,? 
Richard Hamilton scored 21 points and the Pistons set a team playoff record with 14 steals in a victory over the Bucks in Game 1 of their first-round series. 
"This is fun," Hamilton said. One of the best defenses in NBA history stopped the highest 
scoring team in the Eastern Conference. 
Detroit gave up just 84.3 points a game this year, the third-low­est scoring average since the NBA began using a shot clock during the 1954-55 season. It set a league record by holding 11 opponents -including five straight -under 70 points, and 36 in a row to less than 100. 
"I'm real pleased with the way we played," Pistons coach Larry Brown said after leading his NBA-record seventh team into the playoffs. "We rebounded the ball, we shared the ball and we forced them to turn the ball over, which gives us a chance for some easy baskets. We had a lot of guys playing great basketball." 
The Bucks, who averaged 98 points a game, also ranked fourth in the league in scoring. They played four close regular­season games against Detroit, losing three of them. 
But they didn't play Detroit with Rasheed Wallace, who has made the Pistons' stingy defense suffocating since being acquired Feb. 19 in a three-team trade. The Pistons won 20 of 24 games before the playoffs. 
Detroit forced 25 turnovers ­turning them into 28 points ­and had eight blocks. The con­stant defensive pressure had the Bucks scrambling just to get their shots ofT. 
When the Pistons led 68-51 midway through the third, they had more points off turnovers 
(10) than Milwaukee had points (eight) in the quarter. 
"The game was all about our turnovers and the points we gave them ofT turnovers," Milwaukee coach Terry Porter said. 
Game 2 in the best-of-seven series is Wednes':iay in Detroit. 
Desmond Mason led the Bucks with 16 points. Their leading scorer, Michael Redd, scored just 11 points -nearly 11 below his average -and went more than 18 minutes without scoring in the second and third quarters. Joe Smith set a career playoff high with 11 rebounds, and scored six points. 
"We were rushing things, try­ing to get the lead down and they took advantage by doing a lot of trapping," Redd said. "We didn't handle it and we've got to find an adjustment for the next game." 
Detroit didn't excel on defense alone. 
Rasheed Wallace had 17 points, 10 rebounds and three blocks, Ben Wallace had 17 points, 14 rebounds, and Tayshaun Prince added 14 points, 11 rebounds and four blocks. 

"When you have three guys with double-doubles, and two of them are Ben and Rasheed, who can cover the paint like that, you know you have a chance to dic­tate the game," Prince said. Kings 116, Mavericks 105 
After several tough practices and a few emotional speeches. from their leaders. the Sacramento Kings opened the playoffs with a rush of energy ­enough to outrun and outscore the Dallas Mavericks. 
Peja Stojakovic scored 28 points and Chris Webber added 26 points and 12 rebounds, pro­pelling the Kings to a victory in the O'pener of their first-round playoff series. 
Shaking ofT the uncertainty of a late-season collapse that cost them the Pacific Division title, the Kings were flying from the opening ti.p. They made a fran­chise-record 11 of 21 3-pointers, including five by Stojakovic to tie Sacramento's individual playoff best. 
The Kings also claim they've got a new focus on defense and inside play -though it wasn't obvious until the fourth quarter, when not even Dirk Nowitzki could keep 'Dallas close in a fit­ting start for a series between the NBA's two highest-scoring teams. 
"Playing them, I can imagine how defensively tough it is to play us," Webber said. "We don't panic as much as I think the out­side panics. We just kept it together and played all four quarters the same way." 
Webber addressed his team­mates during practice Saturday, saying the Kings were out of time to reverse their late-season

Associated Press 
HOUSTON Even Tommy Haas is surprised by how well his comeback from shoulder surgery is going. 
Haas beat Andy Roddick 6-3. 6-4 at the U.S. Clay Court Championship on Sunday for his first title in more than two years. 
Haas was once ranked as high as No. 2, but he missed all of last season while recovering from the surgery. The German hadn't been in a final since 2002 and last won a tournament at Stuttgart in October 2001. 
He was the steadier 

player from the start, ending the reigning U.S. Open champion's 12­match winning streak. 
"It means a lot to win my first clay court title but obviously it means a lot more to me to after my injuries to come back and win a title again," Haas said. "To be honest, I did­n't expect to win a tour­nament this quick but all you can do is prepare for each tournament and do your best and see what's possible." 
Roddick dropped to 18­2 at Westside Tennis Club -he was the runner-up to Andre Agassi in this tournament last year ­and 32-6 overall this sea­son. He was trying for his third title of 2004. 
"The shoulder feels pretty good which is important, I just hope it keeps up this well," Haas said. 
Haas plans to play Monte Carlo on Tuesday while Roddick headed for his home in Austin, three­hours away. Roddick is expected to skip Monte Carlo to rest up after a heavy playing schedule. 
Haas, who started his comeback from rotator cuff surgery in February, improved to 4-0 against Roddick and took a big step toward regaining his status among elite tennis players. 
"Personally, I wish he'd go away, because I don't have a very good record against him," Roddick said. "But the people seem to love you, so wel­come back." 
Haas broke Roddick in the fourth game of the match and rode that to a first-set victory when Roddick's forehand sailed wide. 
Roddick was upset by a line call in the fourth game of the second set when Haas held. He was still complaining after the next game, when Haas broke his serve.

Irish on the brink of success 
By ERIC RETTER 
Sports Writer 
In their quest to secure the program's first NCAA tourna­ment berth, the Irish remain defmitively on the bubble. 
In what was supposed to be a make or break tournament this weekend at the Lady Boilermaker Invitational,_ the Irish neither gained nor lost ground. The two major compo­nents that influence teams' chances for securing NCAA bids are tournament placement (head-to head competition) and average score per round. The Irish definitely beat some good teams on their way to finishing seventh out of a very strong field of 12, but unusually high scores will hurt their scoring average, 
"It's really tough to say how we did [with regards to procuring an NCAA bid]," Irish coach Debby King said. "We beat some good teams, but because of high winds, scores were high. I think the two probably canceled each other out." 
The Irish were in ninth place Saturday after shooting first-day rounds of 314 and 321. However, a strong Sunday per­formance in which the Irish were one of only three teams to shoot below a 320, with an overall 319, helped propel the Irish two spots ahead to finish in seventh place with a 90-over-par 954. 
"I was definitely pleased with our Sunday performance, espe­cially after a disappointing sec­ond round," King said. 
In what is becoming routine, freshman Noriko Nakazaki led the Irish in scoring, shooting rounds of 75, 81 and 79 to finish tied for 18th with a 235. Junior Karen Lotta fmished 27th with a score of 238 after shooting a 76 and two consecutive 81s. 
Senior co-captain Rebecca Rogers came in third for the Irish and tied for 31st place overall, shooting rounds of 83, 80, and 80 to close out the weekend with a 243, a season-low score. Rogers, who struggled through­out the fall season, has played in both of the Irish's last two tour­naments and has earned the praise of her coach. 
"It's nice to see her peak at the right time, and I'm just so happy for her," King said. 
Katie Brophy made up for a rough Saturday, where she shot rounds of 87 and 83, by shooting a third round 79, tying Nakazaki for the low round Sunday and finishing with an overall 249. Sophomore Sarah Bassett and senior co-captain Shannon Byrne rounded out the Irish lineup this weekend. Bassett shot rounds of 85, 79 and 87 to finish with a 251, and Byrne shot a 252 with rounds of 80, 85 and 87.

game, the 

Belles fought hard, led by Libby 
Wilhelmy, who tossed four solid 
innings for Saint Mary's, giving 
up one run on five hits. She also 
struck out five but did not fac­
tor in the decision. 
Kate Sajewich took the loss 

for the Belles, giving up a lead­
off double in the sixth, followed 
by a single later in the inning 
that allowed the go ahead run 
to score. 
Bridget Grall went 1-for-3 for 

the Belles with an RBI. Erin 
Sullivan was 1-for-3 at the plate 
with a run scored. 
The second game of 

Saturday's doubleheader was 
more offensively oriented, as 
Olivet Nazarene exploded for 
five runs in the first inning and 
never looked back. Olivet added 
two more in the second and 
three in the third and fourth, 
putting the Belles in a 13-1 
deficit heading into the fifth 
inning. 
Saint Mary's finally showed 

signs of life in the fifth, scoring 
five runs on five hits, but it 
proved too little too late. 
Sullivan went 2-for-3 in the 

game, with a run and an RBI. 
Katrina Tebbe was 1-for-3 with 
two RBI's for the Belles. 
Grall started for the Belles, 

only lasting one full inning 
before being pulled before the 
start of the second. She allowed 
five runs on five hits and 
walked three batters. 
Pitching for the second time in two days, Sajewich had trou­ble solving Olivet Nazarene as well, giving up eight runs on seven hits in three innings, although only two of the runs were earned. 
Things weren't much better defensively, either, as the Belles committed four errors in the game. 
After dropping the first game Sunday to Saint Xavier 4-1, the Belles battled back in the sec­ond with a 2-1 win in eight innings. 
Jean Downes led off the eighth with a double and advanced to third on a Laura Heline groundout. Angie Ellison then singled, driving in Downes. The Belles then retired Saint Xavier in order in the bottom of the eighth, secur­ing the win. 
Winning the last conference games are absolutely impera­tive for the Belles to advance to the MIAA tournament. The top four teams make it, and the Belles currently sit tied for fourth with Albion at 7-5.

agrees. 
''I'm hoping that Quentin will take the leadership role and run with it and be that kind of player on and off the football field," Wilks said. 
Burrell hasn't participated in all the drills his secondary teammates have this spring because of off-season shoulder surgery. Burrell is still recover­ing from the surgery and is expected to be 100 percent by the fall. For now, he does indi­viduals drills in practice and works with the team trainer when the Irish do group drills. 
Burrell is likely the leading candidate to try and replace the loss of graduating seniors Vontez Duff and Glenn Earl. While Notre Dame has talented players at the defensive back positions, the team is still rela­tively inexperienced. 
"I think it's hard to truly make up for experience because experience needs to be made up with experience," Wilks said. "Those guys need to be able to get more reps and practice at different things so they can get the looks and recognition they need." 
Besides Burrell, Preston Jackson and Dwight Ellick return to Irish secondary after significant playing time in 2003. Those three, along with a crowd of younger players will be fighting for starting positions and playing time in the fall. Jackson saw action in every Irish game and had 24 tackles and one interception, while Ellick participated in 10 games and had 21 tackles. 
Wilks said two players in par­ticular -rising sophomore Tom Zbikowski and rising senior Carlos Campbell -have stood out in the spring. 

"Without a doubt Zbikowski has definitely impressed me," · Wilks said. "He's stepped up and he's leading by example. 
"You look at some of the older guys like Carlos Campbell ­he's definitely standing out. He's being vocal and making plays and doing the things he should be doing heading into his final year." 
After playing on offense last season, Chinedum Ndukwe and Isaiah Gardner switched posi­tions for a chance at more play­ing time. Ndukwe said the change has been a challenge, but he's adjusting more each day. 
"It's going well. Right now I'm just trying to get all the mental stuff down and just trying to adjust on the fly," he said. ''I'm really just learning by experi­ence now." 
Despite the inexperience and new faces in the secondary, Wilks said the group is playing well and coming together as a unit thus far in spring practice. 
"We're improving each and every day," Wilks said. "I don't think anyone has separated themselves enough to say they're a true starter. Guys are still playing hard and still com­peting, which in the long run will make everyone better."

improved team in the confer­ence. They were as scrappy as they could be. Don't be misled by Saturday's scores -we had to play hard. They wouldn't go away, [it was] a battle. 
"To get three wins was a real accomplishment." 
Mainieri switched his starting rotation and threw lefty Tom Thornton in Saturday's opener and Chris Niese} in the night­cap. To his surprise, Niese! pitched better than Thornton, who was roughed up for seven runs, four earned, in his 4 1/3 innings of work. 
But Thornton (5-1) kept his team in it until the offense could just explode to earn the win. 
In the fifth, the Irish scored seven and tacked on six more in the sixth inning. All nine Irish starters collected at least one hit and scored at least one run while eight of the starters drove in at least one run. 
Niesel battled throughout his eight innings of work allowing 11 hits but yielding no walks to improve to 5-0. 
"I thought Chris [Niesel] pitched better than Tom [Thornton]." Mainieri said. "Tom had a tough time, leaving pitches up in the strike zone. That was a tough game, we won big, but we were down 7­4. 
"Chris pitched courageously, and he gave up 11 hits. He really competed hard, and it wasn't exactly the way we would map it out since it didn't work out for Tom Thornton going six or seven." 
The Irish fell behind early again, down 2-0 heading into the third. Then, designated hit­ter Matt Bransfield hit his first of two two-run home runs in the game. 
Notre Dame's offense woke up in the fourth, scoring five runs and breaking the game open for Niesel. The Irish tacked on two more in the fifth behind Bransfield's other home run. 
Bransfield finished Saturday with seven RBis, and the Irish batted around four times on the day. 
On Sunday, Mainieri sent right-hander Grant Johnson to the hill. but the junior could only go three innings -not because of shoulder problems, which Johnson has been recov­ering from, but because of Johnson battling a stomach virus. 
Mainieri then inserted fresh­man Jeff Samardzija, who joined the team late Saturday night after practicing with the football team Saturday after­noon. 
Samardzija did what he's been doing all year -shut down the opposition. The freshman went 4 2/3 innings in relief and kept the Irish in the game long enough for the offense to wake up. 
"Jeff was tremendous today. It was so badly needed," Mainieri said. "Grant wasn't feeling well, but he battled through three innings. Jeff pitched into the eighth and that was a big thing for us." 
The Hoyas were ahead 5-4 going into the seventh, but the Irish offense scored five in the bottom of the inning -on only one hit -to build a 9-5 lead. That one hit came from Zach Sisko -a grand slam with two outs. Sisko was in the game at second base in place of senior Steve Sollmann, who broke his jaw against Villanova April 3. 
Samardzija improved to 2-1 with the victory and closer Ryan Doherty recorded four outs to pick up his sixth save. 
All three days the Irish had to battle a scrappy home Georgetown team, but the Irish did enough each time to pick up the win and stay tied for the Big East lead. 
"It was a great total team effort," Mainieri said. "When one guy didn't do well, one guy would pick up the slack. 
"That's what great teams do."

continued as a bright spot, pac­ing the Irish with a pair of goals and an assist on the afternoon. 
Both midfielder Meghan Murphy and attack Jackie Bowers recorded a goal and an assist, while attack Mary McGrath picked up a pair of goals, defender Kassen Delano tallied two assists and midfield­er/attack Crysti Foote netted a goal to round out the Irish scor­
-ing. The contest began on a rather ominous note for Notre Dame. Attack Anouk Peters drew first blood for the Hoyas with 
22:46 left on a free position shot and not five minutes later, the lead had grown to 3-0 in favor of Georgetown. 
Foote put the Irish on the board with 11 minutes remain­ing in the half, kicking off a streak of four consecutive goals for the Irish. 
Murphy, Bowers and Simon, respectively, followed suit to give the Irish their first lead of the game. ~ 
The Hoyas fired back, knot­ting the score at 4-4 as Gloria Lozano found the back of the net with only three seconds left in the half. 
"We were [upset] about [the late goal], but I don't think it hurt the momentum, because we were down, 3-0," Coyne said. "I was happy with how we were playing at that point. We went in tied, but we were feeling very confident." 
Georgetown jumped back in front not two minutes into the second half, yet once again the Irish responded. 
After Simon provided the equalizer a little less than eight minutes into the half, Murphy tallied the first of her two goals with 20:45 remaining, and the Irish were temporarily back on top, 6-5. 
Unfortunately for Notre Dame, it was mostly Georgetown from that point, at least on the scorecard. 
The Hoyas tied the score a minute and a half later, before registering each of the next two goals, leaving the Irish trailing, 8-6, with 7:27 left. 
Murphy managed to bring the Irish within one, 8-7, at the 
5:11 mark, but Notre Dame couldn't scratch across the tying goal. 
Peters dashed any last-ditch comeback aspirations, netting her second goal of the after­noon nine seconds before the final whistle. 
"It's a good wake-up call in a way," Coyne said. "We wanted to win the Big East, and we're very disappointed about that. I think the chances [of winning Big East] are severely dimin­ished now. 
"We're still going to focus on winning the rest of our games, and preparing for the NCAA tournament." 
The Irish take the field again Tuesday when they journey to Evanston, Ill., to challenge No. 11 Northwestern.

"After the Loyola loss, every­one realized the predicament we were in," Polk said. "It was our Colorado trip that gave us the 'pick-me-up' we needed because it has set the tone for the most recent games." 
Since the Air Force contest, the Irish have built an early lead in each match, and Sunday was not any different. 
Howell opened the contest with an unassisted goal at 1 :08 into the match. The Irish got out to a 2-0 lead, but this advantage was quickly erased as Fairfield scored three times within three minutes to take their only lead of the game. 
Notre Dame went on to score five of the next seven goals with 6:45 remaining in the first half to make the score 7-5. The Irish then took control of the match holding Fairfield was scoreless for 25:42 and scoring eight consecutive goals for their biggest lead of the game 15-5. 
Fairfield managed to score two of the last three goals of the game that resulted in a 16­7 victory for the Irish. 
This is the fourth straight game Notre Dame has scored 12 or more goals. The Irish are currently first in the GWLL and third in the nation for scoring. 
In the win, Notre Dame was without its entire starting mid­field. Nonetheless, a strong performance was given by Polk, who finished with two goals and one assist for the Polk said. "In addition to being second game in a row. a great ball handler, he is one

No 5. Georgetown serves No.2 Notre Dame its 1st loss of the season in 9-7 victory

All good things must come to an end. 
After a school record 14 con­secutive wins, including a 10-0 start that propelled the Irish to No. 2 in the most recent Intercollegiate Women's Lacrosse Coaches Association (IWLCA) and Inside Lacrosse Magazine polls, Notre Dame was unable to protect an early 6-5 seco"nd half lead as No. 5 Georgetown rallied to post four of the game's last five goals en route to 9-7 victory over the Irish. 
Notre Dame (10-1, 3-1 in Big East) fell to 0-5 all-time against the Hoyas (9-2, 5-0 in Big East). 
"We had our chances, we just didn't capitalize on them, but we're goin-g to use [the game] as inspiration," Irish coach Tracy Coyne said. "If there was anybody that doubted that we were a top-five team, I think we put those critics to rest, It was clearly a very evenly played game, and one of those types of games where if you do a couple things differently, you could have come out on the winning side of it."

MEN'S lACROSSE 
Howell proves Irish scoring force in win 

By DAN TAPETILLO 
Sports Writer 
In his final home game at Moose Krause Stadium, senior Matt Howell turned in the best performance of his career Sunday. 
Howell finished with five goals and three assists for a total of eight points as the Irish went on to defeat Fairfield 16­7. 
Howell finished one point short of the school record of nine in one game, which has been done eight times. Howell was also one short of the six­goal record of most goals scored in a home game. 
"Although he is a great play­er, one of the most notable qualities about him is how much of a leader he is on the field," Irish midfielder Lucius Polk said. 
Howell's leadership has proven to be beneficial for the team as No. 14 Notre Dame has rebounded from a slow start earlier this season. 
After beginning 1-4, Notre Dame is currently on a five­game winning streak, the longest since 2001 when the Irish won a school-record of nine.

Burrell leads defensive backs 
By JOE HETTLER 
Sports Writer 

. Quentin Burrell knows people question the ability of Notre Dame's secondary heading into the 2004 season. 
Burrell has an answer for those critics. "The secondary is not going to be a question mark-trust me," he said. 
Burrell is the most experienced defensive back returning to the Irish this season. He played in all 12 games in 2003 and led the team with four interceptions. 
With the experience from his junior season, Burrell said he knows he'll be looked upon even more this season. 
"Me being a senior, I have to lead by exam­ple," Burrell said. "So I have to try and get the young guys to follow me, which means I have to be perfect in everything I do."
