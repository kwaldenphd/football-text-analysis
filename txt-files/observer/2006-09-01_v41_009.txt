Police arrest suspect 
Man in custody for Turtle Creek incident 
By MADDIE HANNA News Writer 
Police arrested a Mishawaka 
man Wednesday in connection 
with the alleged assault at 
Turtle Creek Apartments Aug. 
23. 
Bruce Smith, 24, was arrest­ed Wednesday night on "pre­liminary charges" relating to the incident in which a female Notre Dame junior, 21, was held at knifepoint in her Turtle Creek apartment, South Bend Police Captain John Williams said Thursday. 
Williams said he could not specify how Smith was found and arrested -"I didn't look into all that" -or what charges were made. 
"The [St. Joseph County] prosecutors will decide what he will be formally charged with," Williams said. 
When asked if he knew this was the man who broke into the apartment and assaulted the student, Williams said, "No, I don't." 
After the arrest, Smith was taken to the St. Joseph County Jail, Williams said. 
At about 7:30 p.m. on Aug. 23, a man who claimed to be a cable company employee allegedly entered the student's apartment and said he needed to check the student's cable.

ment spooky. I call it my home. 

This year I am living in the base­m-ent of my dorm, the result of an unfortunately low lottery number during room picks. The first, second, and third floors filled quickly last year, so I resigned myself to living in what is widely regarded as Pangborn's least desirable room location. 
During an introductory exercise on the first day of Spanish class, a class­mate asked me what dorm I am in and what floor I live on. 
"Cero," I replied, since I have not spoken a word of Spanish all summer and could not remember how to say basement. 
"The basement," I said in English after he looked at me with a con­fused expression. Immediately a look of what can only be described as pity registered on his face. 
"They have rooms down there?" he asked incredulously. 
Rooms and much, much more. After only two weeks living in the basement, I am officially converted to a willing basement dweller. Climbing stairs to go to my room has become a thing of the past. The easy access to the laundry, the printer and the close proximity of my friends, the "Basewoment," is marred only by the occasional blaring of the back door alarm when a fellow Phox breaks parietals or forgets, as I myself have in the past, the door alarm is always turned on at midnight. 
This basement life is not new to me. Over the summer, I moved from the second floor bedroom I had Jived in for six years to another room in the basement of my home. 
My extensive basement dwelling experience allows me to identify cer­tain pluses to lower level living. The temperature is cooler, it's easier to move in and move out and there is a slight feeling of detachment from the other floors that can easily be mis­construed as living on your own. 
Now, from my dorm room I can walk right outside and do homework in the sun at a picnic table in the courtyard. My DeBartolo commute is about two minutes shorter. And without a couple flights of stairs to lug my laundry basket up and down, I think I can get through the whole year without breaking it like I did last year. 
When room picks start at the end of the year, even if I have a high lot­tery pick, I think I will choose to live in the basement again. 
So, to my Spanish friend, don't worry about my living situation. I may barely be above ground, but I still enjoy windows, plumbing, elec­tricity and a room identical to every other room in the dorm. 
If you need me, I'll be in the s6tano.

College expands handicap access 
Ramp to be added to Le Mans west entrance 
By LIZ HARTER News Writer 
Students returning to Saint Mary's campus this fall noticed a new addition to one of the oldest residential build­ings. 
A handicapped ramp is being installed on the west entrance of Le Mans, a build­ing that houses not only stu­dents but also many of the College's administrative offices, the Department of Residence Life and the coun­seling center. 
Bill Hambling, director of Facilities at Saint Mary's, said while there is a handicapped ramp to the south of the one being built, the new ramp will provide an entrance to the basement. 
"This new ramp will pro­vide a more convenient entrance [and] exit to [and] from Le Mans to the center courtyard area," Hambling said. 
The new ramp was designed to fit in with the architecture of the building so as to be aesthetic while serv­ing its purpose, he said. 
While the existing ramp was believed adequate and served its purpose, students 
found it to be in an awkward place and poorly marked. 
"I had no idea that there were any ramps or anything [in Le Mans], there was noth­ing to indicate it," said Kellie Anderson, a sophomore who lived in Le Mans her fresh­man year. 
The new ramp, Hambling said, is "strategically placed to make it more readily visi­ble and available to use." 
The other residential build­ings on campus are not being updated, Hambling said. Regina Hall and McCandless Hall are considered to be very accessible to handicapped students, he said. Holy Cross Hall also has a handicapped entrance to the north of the building near the Security Office, next to the Post Office. 
When asked why the con­struction was taking place now, Hambling responded that it was not a matter of neglect, but rather of finding the funds for the project. 
"[College President] Carol [Ann] Mooney and her leader­ship team are always con­cerned about accessibility issues and safety of our entire campus family," he said.

House guards memories of past 
Riedinger used for student practicum 
By KIM ABEEL News Writer 
A mystery for many students and source of fond memories for many alumnae, the Riedinger House stands as a remembrance of things past on Saint Mary's Campus. 
Though no longer used for its original purpose, the house was built in 1939 for use for the student practicum required of all seniors major­ing in domestic science, according to Barb Henry of the SMC Alumnae Relations Office. 
Four students were assigned to live together in the house, along with a live-in supervisor, for a period of nine weeks, Henry said. While there, the students learned advanced home management skills by practicing efficient budget management, planning and preparing meals, shopping, cleaning, sewing and guest hosting and entertaining. 
While defunct by the mid­1960s, the College's domestic science programs were con­sidered rather advanced for the time, and students with concentrations in dietetics or nutrition were required to take several rigorous courses in biology and chemistry in addition to fulfilling laboratory requirements. 
The program's courses and laboratory sessions were con­ducted in what is now Holy Cross Residence Hall. The cost of the construction of the Hiedinger practicum house was $21,272, a large portion of which was donated by the Adaline Crowley Riedinger family. Riedinger, Class of 1864, was the first alumna to send her daughter, Mary Adalaide Riedin-ger, Class of 1889, to Saint Mary's. 
After an unexpected increase in expenses, however, plans for the house were changed to 7/8 scale. This reduction in size is noticeable primarily in the lowered ceil­ings, especially upon entering the powder room off the main foyer. 
The house was furnished in Early-American style, and the bedrooms contained Georgian­period style furniture. Much of the original furniture remains today. The kitchen was consid­ered state-of-the-art at the time of its construction and even included a dishwasher. There were three bedrooms­two for the students and one spacious room with a fireplace for the supervisor. 
The bathroom was also unique for the time and was designed in such a way that all four students could use it simultaneously, yet with rela­tive privacy. One area of the bathroom housed a tub, show­er and sink; another area, a toilet and a sink; the third area, properly called a "dental lavatory," contained two sinks and a full mirror. 

The basement ·originally served as a state-of-the-art laundry facility, containing an electric wringer-washer and an automatic in-wall steam, dry and press unit. 
After the domestic science program ended, Riedinger House was occupied in 1968 by Msgr. John McGrath. The house underwent a major ren­ovation in the mid -1970s, and has been suitably maintained since. Much of the original furniture remains and has been reupholstered through­out the years. 
Maintaining nearly all of its charm, the house still bears the original copper scalloped gutters, original casement windows and blue toile adorned dining room with original Hitchcock dining chairs. The house also con­tains one of Mother Madeleva's personal bookcas­es, a silver tea service former­ly of the Sisters of the Holy Cross and an original painting of Norman Laliberte. artist and former art instructor at the College from 1960 to 1965. 
Today. the Riedinger House is used by official guests of the College, Alumnae or Trustee Board members or for faculty functions. The rich memorial gardens surrounding the House are open for public use. The House is not available for rent for alumnae weddings or reunions.

Students like junior Caity Schneeman, who visited the New Orleans region twice in the last year, have become key players in the creation of this project. 
"The whole area is in dire need of helping hands, but here is one of those cases where people don't really understands how bad things are until they see for them­selves," she said. 
As chair of the task force, Schneeman is already organiz­ing another trip to New Orleans during fall break, where students will be gutting and rebuilding homes. 
About 80 people are signed up to travel to Louisiana in October. 
One of them is sophomore Luis Crespo, who said it would be his second time helping out in New Orleans. 
"The sheer amount of destruction down there struck me, and I really encourage anybody who has the opportu­nity to go to do it," he said. 
The Alliance for Catholic Education has also been work­ing relentlessly all year to help with the reconstruction of the city's education system. 
Students working as teach­ers in the ACE program saw their schools in Biloxi, Mississippi, destroyed by the waters. 
While they were forced to evacuate the region, most of the ACE participants returned in less than one week to help coordinate the initial rescue and relief efforts, said John Staud, director of Pastoral Formation and Administration for ACE. 
"ACE raised over $150,000 last fall, which was sent to the schools to support the rebuilding and the continued education of students whose families lost almost every­thing," he said. 
Other ACE participants in the Baton Rouge area wel­comed the storm's refugees, offering daytime and nighttime school sessions to accommo­date the region's newly-dou­bled population, Staud said. 
One year after the storm first hit, some people still haven't returned to their old homes ­if those homes even remain. 
"Being there. was depressing at first; the city is not function­al," Deva said of her New Orleans experience. "There are no children playing in the street, and half of the busi­nesses are closed, and every­where there are wrecked houses.... 
"The local people, though, are absolutely inspiring." 
Deva said she and her fellow Notre Dame volunteers met the owner of every house they deared, in an effort to connect the work they were doing to real faces and real people. 
"We were taught to treat the house as if it were the owner itself." Deva said. 
Completing one house took approximately three days, and while she thinks she may have worked on more than one hun­dred homes, Deva stressed the many more houses still in need of work and volunteers. 
"The people down there don't need prayers," she said. "They need people to come help with the clean-up. There is just so mueh work that needs to get done."

The British were seeking a little Yankee ingenuity because their system for financing higher educa­tion is on the cusp of change. Historically, fewer than 40 percent of Britain's secondary schools graduates continue onto college. But the lucky minority who do enroll face relatively small tuitions-the equivalent of about $2200. 
In 2004, the British Parliament passed new legislation intended to make higher education accessible to more students. To underwrite the cost of that expansion, tuitions would increase. Students entering their first year this fall will pay nearly the equivalent of about $6,000.

broad opportunity to attend college in the U.S. is a significant national asset. 
"The U.S. can offer a chance for further education beyond high school virtually for anyone who want.c; to pursue it," he says. "They can do it, and do it with support if they need it." 
"The variety of opportunities is another major strength: Two-year, four-year, public, private, big, small, urban, suburban, religiously affiliated," he says, ticking off the options. "We are recognized around the world as the best."

Rocket attack kills 4 7 in Baghdad 
BAGHDAD -A barrage of coordinated bomb and rocket attacks on eastern Baghdad neighborhoods killed at least 47 people and wounded more than 200 within half an hour on Thursday, police and hospital officials said. 
The latest spasm of violence -which includ­ed explosives planted in apartments, car bombs and several rocket and mortar attacks on mainly Shiite neighborhoods in the capital -came even as Prime Minister Nouri al­Maliki said Iraqi forces should have control over most of the country by year's end. 
The Baghdad bombings brought the day's death toll across the country to at least 68. 
Attackers rented apartments and shops in buildings a few days ago and planted explo­sives in them, detonating them by remote con­trol almost simultaneously Thursday evening, said Maj. Gen. Jihad Liaabi, director of the Interior Ministry's counterterrorism unit. 
Israel turns over small border area 
JERUSALEM -The Israeli army turned over a small border area in south Lebanon to Lebanese and foreign troops Thursday, a symbolic move paving the way for U.N. peacekeepers to go into the volatile area.

Israel sent up to 30,000 soldiers into Lebanon during the 34-day war, and when the fighting ended they occupied a zone extending about 10 miles north from the border.

Manned spaceship in the works 
Associated Press 

WASHINGTON NASA on Thursday gave a multibillion dollar contract to build a manned lunar spaceship to Lockheed Martin Corp., the aerospace leader that usually builds unmanned rockets. 
The last time NASA awarded a manned spaceship contract to Lockheed Martin of Bethesda, Md., was in 1996 for a spaceplane that was supposed to replace the space shuttle. NASA spent $912 million and the ship, called X-33, never got built because of technical problems. 
The nation's space agency chose Lockheed Martin, the biggest gov­ernment aerospace and defense contractor, to build the Orion crew exploration vehicle, which is once again supposed to replace the space shuttle fleet, t&ke astronauts to the moon and perhaps on to Mars. 
The only other competitors for the contract was a team made up of Northrop Grumman Corp., the world's largest shipbuilder and third-largest military contractor, and Boeing Co. 
In picking Lockheed Martin for Orion, described by NASA's chief as "Apollo on steroids," NASA bypassed Apollo throwbacks Northrop Grumman of Los Angeles and its chief subcontractor Boeing of Chicago. An early version of Northrop Grumman built the Apollo lunar lander. Companies bought by Boeing built the Apollo, Gemini, and Mercury capsules, Skylab and the space shuttle. 

"NASA decided to do something different and go with a company that has not been in manned space before, sort of spreading the ~ealth and making sure they've got two contractors that know the manned space business," said aerospace industry analyst Paul Nisbet, presi­dent of JSA Research.

IN BRIEF 
Silver futures surge to 3-month high 
NEW YORK-Silver futures surged to their highest level in three months Thursday, as analysts cited good investment demand a day after the amount of metal held by an exchange-traded fund climbed above 100 million ounces. 
Gold followed, helped by both silver and a sharp gain in copper, analysts said. Continuing tension over Iran's nuclear pro­gram was another factor underpinning pre­cious metals. 
On the New York Mercantile Exchange, December silver settled 36 cents stronger at $13.03 a troy ounce. The contract peaked earlier in the day at $13.08 an ounce, which was its strongest level since May 31. 
December gold futures added $8.10 to close at $634.20 an ounce, after hitting a one-month high of $635 an ounce. 
Copper turned in a strong performance, as the market discounted news that striking workers at Chilean mine Escondida had come to a provisional settlement, which threatens to end a 25-day strike. 
Judge halts sale of generic Plavix 
NEW YOHK -A federal judge blocked sales of a generic version of blood thinner Plavix Thursday while he considers the mer­its of a claim that a Canadian pharmaceuti­cal company improperly entered the market. 
U.S. District Judge Sidney H. Stein issued his written ruling Thursday after a two-day hearing in which Sanofi-Aventis and its partner Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. insisted that the Canadian company, Apotex Inc., must be forced to stop selling its product. Stein denied demands by Bristol-Myers and Sanofi-Aventis that Apotex be forced to withdraw from the market the generic prod­uct it had already sold. -
Apotex had argued that a patent protecting sales of Plavix from competitors was no longer valid and that it was in the public interest to permit sales of its generic version of the drug because lower prices mean even more people can use a lifesaving drug. 
The Ontario-based Apotex began selling its product Aug. 8 after negotiations between the three companies failed to settle the dis­pute. 
Consumer spending increases 
Strong start to back-to-school shopping season boosts hope for economy prospects 
Associated Press 

WASHINGTON 
Consumers increased their 
spending in July by the 
largest amount in six 
months and the back-to­
school shopping season got 
off to a strong start in 
August, boosting hopes 
that the economy will not 
stumble into a recession 
this year. 

The Commerce Department 
reported that July consumer spending rose by a healthy · 0.8 percent, double the 0.4 percent gain in June, reflecting a rebound in 
auto sales. 

Meanwhile, many of the 
nation's retailers reported 
solid gains for back-to­
school shopping in August, 
led by better-than-expected 
increases at retailing giant 
Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and 
many teen retailers such as 
Abercrombie and Fitch Co. 
and Wet Seal Inc. 

The new repqrts provided 
evidence that consumers are 
continuing to spend despite 
rising interest rates, a cool­
ing housing market and 
gasoline prices that hit 
records this summer above 
$3 per gallon. 

That is good news for the economy, given that con­sumer spending accounts for two-thirds of total economic growth.

Investors await employment data 
Associated Press 

NEW YOHK -Wall Street ended an aimless session barely lower Thursday after investors shrugged off comments about productivity by Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and awaited the govern­ment's August employment report. The major indexes ended August with gains. 
With Bernanke saying little to inspire the market in light pre-hol­iday trading, investors decided against making any major moves in advance of Friday's report on non­farm payrolls. The Fed chairman, speaking before an economic and devPlopment conference in South 
Carolina, said productivity growth is "likely to continue for some time." He said recent reports showing a short-term slowing in productivity didn't change his view. 
There are questions on Wail StrcH~t about whether the economy has slowed enough to ward off fur­ther intere8t rate hikes -or whether the Fed's 17 straight increases since 2004 might have tipped the economy too far. Productivity gains make it easier for the Fed to maintain a stable rate policy. 
The market was hard-pressed to hold on to gains from early in the session. It ultimately had little response to a Commerce Department report that consumer 

spending rose in July and that core consumer inflation eased, signaling that the current economic slow­
down might not be  as severe  as  
some have feared.  
Also  Thursday,  the  Labor  

Department released figures show­ing a drop in the number of recent­ly laid off workers filing for unem­ployment benefits. 
According to preliminary calcula­tions, the Dow Jones industrial average was modestly lower, down 
1. 76, or 0.02 percent, at 11,381.15. The Dow showed gains in each of the previous three ses­sions, and is now at a three-month high. For August overall, the Dow rose 1.8 percent, its best showing since April.

The devolution of evolution 
Normally, when the U.S. Department of Education (DoE) issues a 13 page memorandum of detailed rules relat­ing to a new federal grant for college students, a few financial aid directors will groan, a few stu­dents will cheer, and most people will con­tinue on as if nothing at all had happened. But not this year. 
Issued just this summer, the table of acceptable fields of study for the new Academic Competitiveness Grant reads like Einstein's shopping list: molecular biolo­gy, toxicology, computer science, mathematics, physics. These are only some of the scientific, engineering and linguistic majors to which Congress allocated additional funds, because it deemed them essential for the contin­ued success of the nation. 
Conspicuously absent from the list is major number 26.1303: Evolutionary Biology. 
The DoE claims that the omission was simply a "clerical error," but a closer inspection of the memo shows that 26.1303 breaks what would have otherwise been a sequ~nce of 1 0 con­tiguous biology majors, and, further­more, there is a blank line in the doc­ument clearly indicating an omission. Giving the obviousness of this "error," it is difficult to understand the removal as anything other than pur­poseful. Evidently someone in the DoE thinks that evolutionary biology is not an acceptable field of study. 
But, besides insulting to all of sci­ence, what does this omission actually mean? If you happen to be studying evolutionary biology this fall, it means that you could be out several thousand dollars of federal aid. However, in the grand scheme of things, it probably means very little. The ACLU has already threatened to sue if the major is not restored to the list, and chances are good that it will be 3:dded very soon. 
What is troubling about this incident 

Lance Gallop 

Tidewater Blues 
is that it is just one symptom of a much larger problem spanning the entire nation -sort of a bureaucratic canary in a mine-shaft. 
On August 11, the journal "Science" published the results of a study that examined American and Western acceptance of human evolution since 1985. While some of the results were promising, overall the conclusions of the study were profoundly negative. As of 2005, 39 percent of Americans rejected the concept of human evolu­tion, which places America second from the bottom among the 34 nations surveyed. Only the country of Turkey had a higher rate of rejection of this fundamental science. 
While this is a decrease of nine percentage points 

from 1985, at the same Evidently someone damentally grounded in time the percentage of in the DoE thinks evolution. This is not Americans who are advanced or specialized

Future generations will no doubt look back on this era as a form­ative moment in our legal understand­ing of bioethics, in the same sense ·that the late 19th century was formative in our legal understanding of the role of private corporations. We should not take this lightly. 
Reproductive human and animal cloning, genetic discrimination, the implications of transgenetic modifica­tion, stem-cell research, therapeutic cloning and incidents of viral mutation 
(e.q. bird flu) are only a handful of the scientific issues closely linked to policy decisions that are currently being debated, and which are all fundamen­

1985 to 21 percent as of 2005. One can safely conclude that most of those who no longer reject evolution outright end up in this inter­mediate category, and therefore much of the gain since 1985, though hope­ful, is nonetheless moot. 
As recent as May of 2005 we wit­nessed an unfolding comedy of errors, as the Board of Education of Kansas once again attempted to handicap the teaching of human evolution in its schools. Additionally, there are now several Republican conventions which have adopted campaign platforms that are openly hostile to the continued soundness of Americans' understand­ing of the concepts of evolutionary biology. 
This reason that all of this is impor­tant, notwithstanding the intrinsic value of scientific understanding and the profoundly troubling implications for our nation's cherished and essen­tial separation of church and state ­and perhaps even for religio'us free­dom itself-is that today the American people are increasingly called to make qualitative and ethical 

lack. I contend that with­out a firm understanding and accept­ance of evolutionary biology, we as a society are not equipped to make any kind of meaningful judgments about biologically oriented issues. 
Our nation has already lost a great deal because of the rejection of evolu­tion. It has diminished our ability to permit science to enlighten our spiri­tual understanding of the world. It has overthrown scientific fact as the stan­dard par-excellence on which to base public policy, and it has terminated the ability of a section of our popula­tion to do more than babble and wave its hands everywhere that public poli­cy and biology intersect.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR 

A modest 


proposal 

Skipping the tedious business of refutation, Clare Feeney devotes most of her August 30 let­ter ("Beware stereotyping") to diagnosing Ryan Davidson as suffering from a severe case of "savage Arab" stereotyping. This has led him to accuse Iran (which is not an Arabic state) of, in Ms Feeney's words, "making nuclear weapons for unfriendly purposes." In fairness to Davidson however, it seems possible that his conclusion might be based on more than just repeated viewings of Lawrence of Arabia. After all, Iran's President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has been known to call for the Zionist entity (i.e. Israel) to be "wiped off the map." Admittedly, the accuracy of the translation has been ques­tioned, with some experts suggesting that the phrase is better rendered as "wiped off the pages of history." Maybe it sounds friendlier in· the original Farsi. 
Having said that, when Feeney says that America is in no position to make accusations about Iran's motives since "we are the only one who has actually dropped the bomb" she makes a strong, albeit ungrammatical, point. That is why I propose a radical new approach to the issue, which I call the "Everybody Gets One" policy. According to this policy every state rec­ognized by the United Nations. exception for the United States which has already had its turn, gets to fire nuclear weapons with a total force of 100 kilotons (the total for the two bombs dropped by the U.S., adjusted for infla­tion based on the increase in the world's popu­lation, and rounded up) at a state of their choos­ing without any recriminations. Then the sur­vivors can go about the business of establishing a sane and rational global nuclear policy unbur­dened by history on a leveled playing field. 
Either that, or we could try to stop judging the actions of nation states, including our own, in terms of friendliness and hypocrisy, as if they were giant superannuated people.

We now bring you a commercial break 
It's an awful feeling. You're watching your favorite program or a big game and one of the commercial breaks features the utterly worst commercial you've ever seen. 
Whenever a commercial featuring Willie Nelson, Joan Cusack, old men fishing aqd promot­

car dealer­ship pops on Scene Editor the screen, aRger and disgust start to arise like bile. 
I had this exact experience recently with a certain Dr. Scholls -commercial. Part of the "Are you gellin'?" series, the commercial plays on the word "gellin" and rhymes it with as many words as possible in an attempt to be funny. I became painfully aware of the fact that the writers of the commercial were trying far too hard to be funny, and the end result was a total lack of humor. 
"Why," I wondered, "can't all commercials be funny and enjoy­able?" 
I had in mind such commer­cials as the Geico caveman ads, Aflac commercials, anything fea­turing Red Stripe and even the Vonage commercials where a spokesman tries to promote cell phones while a lobster gets stuck in a revolving door. 
There is, of course, a reason for the disparity in funniness between various commercials. This disparity can be connected to a similar inconsistency found among stand-up comedians. Some comedians, such as Dane Cook, Mitch Hedberg and Jerry Seinfeld, are extremely funny, while others. such as Sarah Silverman and Gilbert Gottfried, lack the capacity to humor intel­ligent audiences. 
The difference lies in that the first three comedians do not overextend themselves in their approaches to humor whereas the latter two try excessively hard to woo audiences and fail in the process. Thus, the best humor is unforced, natural and produces unaffected and hearty laughter. 
Humor in television commer­cials functions in a similar man­ner. An ad depicting a caveman asking for roast duck at a restaurant is funny because it is not trying overly hard to be humorous. However, Dr. Scholls commercials trying to rhyme and ESPN Mobile commercials trying to use humor so subtly or wittily causes them to fall flat on a majority of television watchers and fail miserably. 

The source of many poor com­mercials is clearly the Super Bowl. While Super Bowl ad time has produced many outstanding commercials in past years such as the Office Linebacker and a prehistoric Fed Ex spot, just as many bad commercials have come from Super Bowl ad spots. Given large· amounts of money and a large public forum, writers overextend themselves and turn out horrible advertisements that in turn make it all right for more ads like these to be produced at times other than the Super Bowl. 
In the face of poor advertise­ments like the ones mentioned here and many others floating around the airwaves, it is neces­sary to ask what can be done to end the pain and bring about better commercial watching. Doing away with Super Bowl ads is not an option given that some of the best commercials origi­nate here. Simply muting the tel­evision or changing the channel when a horrible commercial airs also serves no purpose. The offending ad will still play even if you try to stage a one-person · revolt against the television pow­ers that be. 
I propose that a reality televi­sion show be developed in which commercial writers are subject­ed to a jury of "ordinary Americans" that has the power to sentence writers of bad com­mercials to punishments of watching their own commercials for hours on end. In one or two seasons, a show like this could weed through the entire popula­tion of commercial writers -for how many can there possibly be? 
In this way, I believe we can rid America of bad, unfunny commercial advertisements for­ever. Until then, we return you to your regularly scheduled pro­gramming.

DVD REVIEW 

'Friends' a smart, bold film 
By LAURA MILLER Scene Critic 
Writer/director Nicole Holofcener's "Friends with Money" is absolutely shocking. 
Joan Cusack (Franny). Frances McDormand (Jane). Jennifer Aniston (Olivia) and Catherine Keener (Christine) play four best friends who are struggling in the adjustment to middle age. Although it is advertised as a comedy, it most assuredly is not. It is funny, but it rises above this label (evidenced by it opening the Sundance Film Festival this year) and is also quite pos­sibly one of the most well-writ­ten and true-to-life movies to come out this year. 
The best thing about the script is that it allows the actors and actresses to be dis­tinctly human. There is no illu­sion of beauty. They look frumpy in the morning, they eat ice cream for breakfast and they bicker. At first, it feels. like a film that might take 88 minutes to go absolutely nowhere, but Holofcener gen­tly ties the film together in subtle outtakes of the charac­ters talking about each other. It is these clips of the more intimate discussions that taste­fully integrate the themes of the movie without forcing any specific message upon the viewer. Holofcener is wise in leaving issues open-ended, allowing the audience to draw their own conclusions and relate to the characters in their own unique way. 
Overall, the acting was phe­nomenal, but it is clear that Aniston is not as comfortable out of the comedic setting as her costars. This is the first film in which Aniston is seen departing from her traditional role -and while it is not a seamless transition, her acting like "Divine Secrets of the Ya­Ya Sisterhood" and shows like

is promising at the very least. 
Cusack nails her wealthy soccer-mom persona and McDormand's picture of Jane going through menopause is so perfectly scary that it leaves the audience praying that their mothers (or themselves) are never that bad. 
Keener also does a fantastic job showing a woman s.trug­gling with her marriage with­out going too far. These depic­tions are what make this movie great. It is real and the prob­lems encountered are real problems. Money. Friends. Divorce. There is no spastic soap opera plot with the ex­wife's husband's child getting pregnant, b.ut rather, a thoughtful outlining of every­day problems and event in the life of the middle aged -get­ting burnt on the stove, notic­ing wrinkles, etc. 
The film also translated well to DVD, in part because of the simplicity of the cinematogra­phy and a larger emphasis on dialogue. The extras are sparse, but actually worth watching. Deleted scenes or music videos are absent, replaced with actor and direc­tor interviews. If the movie didn't make the viewer see these actors and actresses as real people, the extras certain­ly do. They show crew at the Sundance Film Festival clad in jeans and casual shirts, hair in ponytails and minimal make­up. These women looked their parts. They were passionate in their interviews, describing the script in terms of an emotional process -not a "this movie was fun to make" response. It was refreshing to see some big Hollywood names looking and feeling so comfortable in their own skins. 

Over the past years, few good movies about women's issues have been released. This movie achieves what films

Celebrities always under public's keen eye 
By ANALISE LIPARI Assistant Scene Editor 
It's been more than a year since Tom Cruise took to the couch on an unassum­ing broadcast of "The Oprah Winfrey Show," declaring his love for much younger actress Katie Holmes. Viewers were intrigued -albeit somewhat shocked-at this up-close-and-person­al exposure to Cruise's formerly very pri­vate life. 
Cruise's antics during the year that fol­lowed only added to the perception that he was odd, or even slightly disturbed. Few can forget his famously calling Matt Lauer "glib" while discussing anti­depressants on "The Today Show," while still fewer can watch a Cruise film with­out the thought of his bizarre endorse­ment of Scientology on their minds. 
It is true that "Mission Impossible III" did yield more than $400 million dollars worldwide during its on-screen run. However. Cruise's recent split with for­mer partner Paramount, allegedly due to his recent behavior, suggests that the power of negative public opinion remains an indelible factor in Hollywood. 
The experiences of Cruise and other celebrities, such as the recently maligned Mel Gibson, call to mind the question public perception in an enter­tainer's career. When entertainment magazines revealed the details behind the gates of Neverland Ranch, that infor­mation undoubtedly altered Americans' opinion of Michael Jackson. Charlie Sheen's recent redemption from the 
bowels of Tinseltown has been ham­pered yet again-this time by the accu­sation of former spouse Denise Richards of alleged wrongdoing during their brief marriage. 
Be it through tabloids, E! Entertainment Television or the internet, the American -and the increasingly global -public finds more evidence of a seamy underbelly to their favorite stars' lives. Often, these revelations can have a powerful impact on those actors' or actresses' careers. 
Is it right to judge a man's craft based on the details of his private life or per­sonal opinions? Despite the truth or fal­sity of this question, history has shown in the end, the public has the final say. 
Actors are not alone in this uncomfort­able circumstance. Nineteenth century Britain shunned the formerly beloved playwright Oscar Wilde, upon discover­ing that he had been convicted of engaging in homosexual behavior. Politicians are clearly not immune from public scandal. as Americans have seen in the damaged reputations of Trent Lott, Bill Clinton and even John F. Kennedy. 
It is a peculiarity of entertainment, however, that success is so tightly linked to public opinion. To put it bluntly, if an actor or actress has no audience, they simply will not act. The crux of the prob­lem lies where the public's enjoyment of celebrities' screen personas and its fas­cination with celebrities' personal lives intersect. Where one ends and the other begins is the question that must be asked. 
Disconnection with that audience due to personal behavior casts a negative, and often irrevocable, shadow. Despite being a nation of self-proclaimed' free thinkers. American sensibilities still con­tain a strain of Puritan ethic, and social norms still have a say in the actions of c·elebrities. 

The future success of men such as Cruise and Gibson remains to be seen. Bouncing back from scandal can take precious time and money. However, the ultimate redemptive factor may just be the passing of time. In the annals of film history, Orson Welles is remembered more for the critical darling that is 1941's "Citizen Kane" than he is for the tailspin of weight gain and bad career decisions made in his later life. Marlon Brando is remembered for being off-kil­ter, sending an actress posing as a Native American to collect one of his Academy awards. However, he is more remembered for his eternal portrayal as Don Corleone in "The Godfather" and Stanley Kowalski in "The Streetcar Named Desire." Some celebrities stand the test of time aside from abnormal behavior. 

Only time will tell how our genera­tion's stars are remembered.

DVD REVIEW 
'Arrested Development' shines in third season DVD set 
By CASSIE BELEK Assistant Scene Editor 
After an unceremonious and much­debated cancellation, "Arrested Development" now has released its third and final season on DVD. The Emmy-win­ning series went from critical darling to cult favorite during its short run but never achieved the widespread viewership it so rightly deserved. 
The FOX Network did little to aid the success of the comedy by continually switching its time slot, cutting Season Three down to 13 episodes and air~g the last four episodes opposite the Torino opening ceremonies. FOX practically ensured the demise of the otlbeat series produced by Ron Howard. In the process, television lost its best comedy on Feb. 10, 2006. Thankfully, "Arrested Development" will forever be preserved on DVD in 53 flawless episodes. · 
The 13-episode third season continues to follow the exploits of the Bluth family, a dysfunctional bunch whose patriarch, George Bluth Sr. (Jeffrey Tambor), was arrested on multiple counts of fraud and light treason in season one. At the start of the first season Michael (Jason Bateman) -the only sane member of the family­establishes himself as the new leader ·or his family and the Bluth Company. 
This season begins with George Sr. being put under house arrest and Michael meet­ing British bombshell Rita (Charlize Theron), who is painted as spy that pre­tends to fall in love with him. 
The episodes continue with Tobias get­ting hair plugs only to have the transplant reject him (not the other way around), Maebfs relation to George Michael frnally being revealed, the introduction of new lawyer Bob 1oblaw (Scott Baio) and his

Arrested Development 
Third Season 
20th Century Fox 



l(ltTrtTrtTr-
Outstanding Comedy Series. The smartest show not on television employs a massive amount of self­reflexivity, endle3s pop culture refer­ences and a contin­uous recycling of jokes and sight gags from earlier episodes, not to mention using Ron Howard as the spectacular narrator. The series joins the ranks of "Freaks and Geeks" and "Undeclared" as amazing shows that couldn't find an audience. 
For months, speculation circulated that Showtime would pick up the series, but when creator Mitch Hurwitz quit the show, that possibility died. There is now renewed buzz that the show will instead return as a feature film. a prospect Ron Howard him­self addresses in the series finale. While most of its actors have moved on to other projects, "Arrested Development" is still fighting for its life. 
Shrouded in dysfunction, the series is actually a celebration of traditional family values. Family unity remains paramount over women, money and loose seals with a taste for mammal blood. Its themes never caught the eye of mainstream America, but the fan ·base is spreading, particularly among college students. 


With its use of handheld cameras and abandonment ofthe laugh track, "Arrested Development" helped pave the way for shows like "The Office" and "My Name is Earl." The series could not find an audi­ence while on the air, but the Bluth family will live on through DVD, further establish­ing "Arrested Development" as one of tele­vision's all-time great comedies.

SAN DIEGO -Left-ban­der David Wells was trad­ed Thursday from the Boston Red Sox to his hometown San Diego Padres, who are seeking pitching as they contend for a playoff spot. 
"He's thrilled to be heading back to San Diego and, hopefully, helping get them into the playoffs," agent Gregg Clifton said by phone from Arizona. 
The defending NL West champion Padres were off Thursday. They were leading the wild-card race by a half game over Philadelphia and trailing the division-leading Los Angeles Dodgers by three ga:nes. 
A source told ESPN's Jerry Crasnick that the Red Sox would get minor­league catcher George Kottaras in the deal, which was first reported by ESPN The Magazine's Buster Olney. 
Kottaras is playing for Triple-A Portland, where he is hitting .233 with two homers and 13 RBI. The Red Sox organization is in need of catching, and Kottaras has a reputation as a solid defender. To be on a postseason roster, a player had to be in a team's organization by the end of Thursday.

IN BRIEF 

Tigers ski~per stops ar$Uing
for "God Bress America 
NEW YOHK -Jim Leyland put his argument with umpires on pause of a moment of patriotism. 
The Detroit Tigers manager was ejected in the seventh inning of Thursday's 6-4 loss to New York, and came on the field to argue with plate umpire James Iloye. 
Leyland got to the plate and started jawing with Hoye when Yankee Stadium public address announcer Bob Sheppard called for a mome.nt of silence followed by the playing of Kate Smith's rendition of "God Bless America." Leyland backed off, stood at attention and respected the moment before resuming the argu­ment. 
"That was a little embarrassing," Leyland said. "I certainly in no way, shape or form would I ever be disre­spectful. But you don't tell the umpires, 'Hey, I've got to listen to Kate."' 
who pitched with the Padres in 2004, was scratched from his sched­uled start Thursday night in Boston and designated for assignment. 
Wells' locker was nearly empty and four cartons were stacked in front of it before the game against the Toronto Blue Jays. Reliever Julian Tavarez was picked to start in his place. 
The 43-year-old Wells has a history of postsea­son success and has been one of Boston's best starters while the team has fallen far behind in the playoff race with an 8­21 record in August, the worst in the majors for the month. The Red Sox began the day eight games behind in the AL East and 7 and 1/2 games behind in the wild-card standings. 

Wells, who battled knee problems most of the sea­son, is 2-3 with a 4.98 ERA. Since returning from the disabled list on July 31, he is 2-2 in six starts. He has a 2.65 ERA in his last five outings beginning Aug. 5. 
Wells was expected to be in uniform when the Padres open a home series against Cincinnati on Friday night. He is expected to start for the Padres on Saturday against the Reds. 
Vinatieri still sidelined with 
injury to non-kicking foot 
INDIANAPOLIS -The Indianapolis Colts expect an update Friday on the condition of kicker Adam Vinatieri, who has an injured non-kicking foot and will probably miss the team's final preseason game. 
Vinatieri's mother, Judy, told The Indianapolis Star that he told her several days ago that he had a frac­ture, the newspaper reported on its Web site Thursday. 
"They sent him to a specialist," Judy Vinatieri told the Star. "They found a small broken bone in his foot." 
Colts coach Tony Dungy declined Thursday to elaborate on Vinatieri's injury, saying he expected a team doctor to updatf' about the kicker's recovery on Friday. 
Colts spokesman Craig Kelly said that Vinatieri had not suffered any broken bones and that he was recov­ering from a sprained ligament. 

Ortiz released from hospital, 
expects to play Saturday 
BOSTON-David Ortiz said he is in good health after experiencing heart palpitations and expects to return to the lineup Saturday, welcome news for a Boston Red Sox team reeling ti·om injuries. 
"My health is fine. The doctors have told me to rest today and practice Friday so I can be ready to return to the playing field on Saturday," he said Thursday on radio station Z-1 01 in his native Dominican Republic. 
Manager Terry Francona was cau­tious about putting Ortiz back in the lineup. 
"I talked to David today," Francona said before Thursday night's homes­tand opener against Toronto. "I think he was very upbeat. I think the med­ical people are also, but, at the same time, we sent him home to be careful. So to deviate from that plan now would be, in my opinion, stupid, and we're not going to be stupid."

Monarchs rehrrn home 
Williams advances in Open 
for second Finals game 
an engagement at Arthur Ashe Stadium: The 17-year­old American was to sing "America the Beautiful" before the night session. 
"I'm really nervous," King said. "I don't know if I'll be more nervous .for that than my match." 
"The inflammation was pretty bad, and I just don't want to go off the court limp­ing," Agassi told USA Network. "It's not what I want to do." 
While Davenport was enjoy­ing her breakfast bagels, a crowd formed outside the fence at the practice courts to watch the 36-year-old Agassi warm up. 
When he wrapped up, Agassi made a teenager's morning wait worth it, signing the boy's forehead with a Sharpie. 
Former Open champion Andy Roddick said he expect­ed a game effort from Agassi. 
"I've never had a cortisone shot, but from what I've heard, you feel like you can run through walls," Roddick said. "He's been playing through that pain for a couple of years now, so I think he's used to it." 
Davenport didn't face a break point, compiled 11, and produced a 24-2 edge in win­ners. The match took all of 40 minutes. 
"I knew I had to come back tomorrow again and play, so I was trying to get out of here relatively fast. Not that fast," said Davenport, who quit dur­ing the final of a hard-court ' tuneup in New Haven, Conn., last weekend because of fatigue and soreness in her right arm. 
Laimbeer readies Shock to rebound from loss 
Associated Press 
DETHOIT-The Sacramento Monarchs accomplished their goal of grabbing home-court advantage from the Detroit Shock with a dominating per­formance in the opening game of the WNBA finals. 
But the coaches and players for the defending champion Monarchs expect to see a much different effort from the Shock in Game 2 on Friday. 
Detroit coach Bill Laimbeer is demanding more from his play­ers. 
"We're a very confident bunch and when we get an atti­tude, we're even more confi­dent," Laimbeer said. "We got frustrated and-a couple players started getting mopey and it atl'ects how you make shots and how you go to loose balls quiek­er and how you make rebounds. 
"That can't happen. . . . I told them, in the WNBA finals, the coach's job is to help get you there. When you get to the finals, it's a test of wills." 
The Monarchs, who won at Connecticut to open last year's finals series, set new records for points in a game and in a half with their 91-75 victory Wednesday night. And they beat Detroit at its own physical game, getting in the faces of the Shock players on defense and taking the ball straight at its usually solid interior defenders, including power forward Cheryl defense was what got us the win, and that's the type of team that we are," Walker said. "That's the type of team we've always been, and we know we can't win without it. We also know Detroit is going to come back at us in Game 2, so we've got to keep our focus and remain steady and not worry about Game 1. Game 1 's over." 
When they weren't pounding it inside, the Monarchs were lighting it up from the outside. Former Shock draft pick Kara Lawson scored 22 points, 18 from 3-point range -another finals record. 
The Monarchs forced 24 turnovers. 
But the Shock did have a few bright spots they hope to build upon. 
Ford scored a career playoff­high 25 points, many of which came from short range or the free-throw line after being fouled under the basket. And Katie Smith scored 21 points, Jiving up to her status as the all-time leading scorer in women's professional basket­ball in her finals debut. 
Ford, Smith and Deanna Nolan, who had 14 points, sco.red 60 of the team's 71 points. The key for Game 2 is to get more production from Riley and Swin Cash, the ·team cap­tain and one of the stars of the 2003 championship team. 
·Riley managed only two points in 15 minutes of playing time. 
Cash, who hasn't achieved the same level of consistency since a serious knee injury two years ago, was held scoreless in only 11 minutes in Game 1. 
6, 6-4, 6-2. 
A n d r e Agassi was on the night schedule, and once again could be playing his final matcli as a pro. 
He was set to face No. 8 Marcos Baghdatis, two days after getting a cortisone shot for an ailing back. 
No surprise, Arthur Ashe Stadium was already sold out to see him. 
The third-seeded Sharapova overwhelmed Emilie Loit 6-0, 6-1.

Sharapova, Davenport move to third round 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK Maria Sharapova switched outfits for a power lunch while Serena Williams changed her early luck, with both advancing to the third round of the U.S. Open with straight-set victo­ries Thursday. 
Lindsay Davenport served up the most impressive win ­a "double bagel" in tennis terms -and joined fellow former Open champions Justine Henin-Hardenne and 
Sharapova was knocked out of her first U.S. Open by Loit. 
Sharappva came out wear­ing a relatively simple pale blue dress. The previous night, she put on a sequined, black cocktail number that she said was inspired by her Audrey Hepburn "phase." 
Trying for her third U.S. Open title, Williams defeated No. 17 Daniela llantuchova 7­5, 6-3. She got off to a shaky start in the first set, not that she was keeping score. 
"Was I down 5-2? I didn't even know it," she said. "I just started focusing. She was doing everything right."

BASKETBALL 
Coach K succeeds with NBA stars 
USA to play Greece in Worlds semifinals 
Associated Press 
SAITAMA, Japan-As prac­tice wound down, Mike Krzyzcwski approached LeBron James, who was shoot­ing baskets alone on a side court. 
James listened intently as the coach spoke and motioned to a spot in the lane. The two talked for about 10 minutes before Krzyzewski rejoined his staff on another court and James went back to shooting. 
Who said NBA stars would never listen to a college coach? 
"You know the high-intensity coach that you see on TV," James said later. "You get a chance to see the warm side of him a little bit now on this trip. You get a chance to really know him." 
When USA Basketball appointed Krzyzewski coach last October, skeptics won­dered whether a college coach, even one as respected as Duke's Hall of Farner, would be able to connect with pampered pros. But those questions have subsided as Krzyzewski has led the U.S. to the semifinals of the world championships. 
The Americans already have advanced farther than they did in the 2002 worlds, when they finished a demoralizing sixth in Indianapolis. While the U.S. hopes to win this tournament, the ultimate goal is to bring home the gold in the 2008 Olympics in Beijing. If Krzyzewski does that, his con­siderable reputation will have grown exponentially. 
"Let's put it this way: A<> high up the totem pole as he is, his position will only be enhanced in the basketball world with the success of this program and the new relationships he has developed," said USA Basketball managing director Jerry Colangelo, who hand­picked his fellow Chicago native. 
For Krzyzewski, success with the U.S. team may bring renewed interest from the NBA. But having spurned a reported $40 million offer from the Los Angeles Lakers in 2004, Krzyzewski said he has no interest in coaching in the pros, even though he's enjoyed dealing with the NBA stars at the worlds. 
"This is an incredible, unique experience, and I love that experience," Krzyzewski said after a recent practice. "But I'm not going to be going to the NBA. I love coaching in col­lege. Whenever I get through coaching in college, that'll be it, whenever that is. I'm not saying that it's imminent." 
Tl)e 59-year-old Krzyzewski, a West Point graduate, accept­ed this job because he wanted to restore the U.S. to promi­nence in world basketball. Krzyzewski has won 753 games and three national titles in 26 years-at Duke and five at Army. But he hasn't led a team to an Olympic gold .medal, although he was an assistant on the gold medal-winning Dream Team in 1992. 
U.S. forward Shane Battier played for Krzyzewski at Duke and sees in his coach the same vigor at the worlds. 
"He's enjoyed the journey because it is so different from what he's been doing the last 30 years," Battier said. "And he is an individual who really gets off on those sorts of expe­riences and those challenges." 
At the outset, it was fair to wonder whether rich NBA players would be sufficiently motivated. But when Krzyzewski and Colangelo required players to commit through the Beijing Olympics, the 'likes of James, Kobe Bryant, Carmela Anthony and Dwyane Wade bought in. 
Once the U.S. had assembled its roster, Krzyzewski didn't worry about his wealth of NBA talent. He dealt with his play­ers as people, not celebrities. 
During training camp in Las Vegas this summer, Krzyzewski spent much of his time talking to players individually, just as he did with James at practice in Japan. He understands this is the NBA offseason and knows not to push too hard. 
"Even when we're doing five­on-five, if a guy's sitting out, I might go up to him and be able to do that instead of saying, 'Will you come to my room and have this meeting?' " Krzyzewski said. "That's rela­tionship-building. At least the first three days in Vegas, that's all I was doing. 
"Somebody would say, 'Well, who's the head coach?' " Krzyzewski said with a grin. "I don't know. There's this guy walking around talking to everybody." 
The players may have envi­sioned the sort of fiery speech­es Krzyzewski uses when Duke faces North Carolina. But his approach has been more low­key. 
"I really didn't know what to expect coming in," guard Kirk Hinrich said.

Wildcats beat Red Hawks in opener 

NU bests Miami in memory ofdead coach 
Associated Press 
OXFORD, Ohio -With his number on their helmets and his nickname on their hearts, Randy Walker's players gave him one more tribute. 
Erryn Cobb blocked a punt and returned it for a touch­down Thursday night, helping Northwestern finally get beyond two months of mourn­ing with a 21-3 victory over Miami University. 
The entire night was a trib­ute to Walker, the 52-year-old Miami graduate and Northwestern coach who died two months ago of an appar­ent heart attack. The season opener featured a lot of emo­tion but no points in the first half. 
Coach Pat Fitzgerald, who was Walker's close friend and top assistant, watched his Wildcats find their stride in the second half behind red­shirt quarterback Mike Kafka, who threw a 19-yard touch­down pass. 
Terrell Jordan made the Miami fans head for home with a 4-yard touchdown run early in the fourth quarter that made it 21-3 _ too much for Walker's alma mater to overcome. 
Walker scheduled the game when he left Miami in 1999, agreeing to make North\\1estern only the second Big Ten team ever to visit Oxford. Walker was remem­bered during a pregame trib­ute behind one of the end zones, where a plaque with his likeness was unveiled. 
There was a moment of silence before the kickoff, and Walker's wife, Tammy, went on the field for the coin toss. Players from both teams wore 

a decal with Walker's uniform 
number and nickname just 
above their facemasks. 
Northwestern players also had a rectangle that said "WALK" sewn on the front of their jerseys over their hearts. 
Video and photos of Walker's career were shown on the scoreboard at halftime, lend­ing the feel of a memorial instead of an opener. Two list­less offenses provided little distraction in the scoreless first half, a reflection of the mutual inexperience at quar­terback. 
In Walker's · wide-open offense, the Wildcats averaged more than 500 yards per game last season behind Brett Basanez, the school's career passing leader. His replace­ment started out playing like a freshman. 
Kafka went 7-for-11 for a measly 26 yards in the first half. In two telling throws, he bounced passes at the feet of wide-open receivers on back­to-hack plays. 
His counterpart had his own problems. Junior Mike Kokal made only his second career start for Miami, which man­aged 54 yards in the scoreless half against a defense that fin­ished last in Division 1-A last season. 
Maybe that was another appropriate tribute. Walker never minded a low-scoring game. A star tailback at Miami, he preferred the slog­it-out style -his spread offense was a matter of neces­sity, not deeply held philoso­phy. 
Cobb, a senior tight end, broke the stalemate by break­ing through the line on Miami's first punt in the sec­ond half and batting Jake Richardson's kick to the ground. The ball bounced straight up, and Cobb caught it cleanly and ran 8 yards for his first career touchdown.

MLB-NL 

Sanchez leads league in average
l 
\ 
Unkown third baseman outhitting superstars 
Associated Press 
PITTSBURGH -Batting cham­pionships once came with relent­less regularity for the Pittsburgh Pirates, who won nearly one­quarter of all the National League titles during the 20th century. 

\. But who expected Freddy Sanchez, the Red Sox castoff and a utility infielder at the start of the season, to challenge for their 25th title and first since 1983? Certainly the Pirates didn't. 
Sanchez, in his first season as a regular at 28, takes an NL­leading .347 average into September after hitting .301 or better every month this season. 
If he can maintain that consis­tency, and no one behind him gets unstoppably hot, Sanchez could join former Pirates such as Hanus Wagner (eight titles). Roberto Clemente (four) and Paul Waner (four) as an NL champion. 
He would be their biggest out­of-nowhere winner since Matty Alou, once a journeyman out­fielder, changed his batting approach after being traded by the Giants and jumped his aver­age from .231 in 1965 to .342 in 1966. 
Can he do it? Sanchez doesn't know, and doesn't talk much about his unanticipated pursuit of the silver bat. But after hitting .354 in August (39-of-110)-he hit .360 in May and .380 in June -he has answered the doubters who suspected he couldn't stay in the race long-term after mov­ing into the lead July 3. 
"I do have confidence in my 

i 
~~ 
', ' 
) 
~ 
ability, but I was .always labeled as a utility guy and it can be hard to shake that label," he said. "This isn't something I thought about and it's just hap­pened." 
If anyone with the Pirates says he saw this coming, he's not telling the truth. As manager Jim Tracy said, "Did I expect him to contend for the batting champi­onship? No." 
Sanchez hit .291 in 453 at-bats last season, mostly at third base, yet the Pirates went out and signed Joe Randa to a $4 million contract to be their third base­man. Sanchez? He was supposed to be their super sub, a guy who would get regular at-bats at every infield position. 
If nothing else, this illustrates why the Pirates are one loss from a 14th consecutive losing season: They had a potential bat­ting champion and NL All-Star on their roster, yet didn't make him a regular until he forced them to do so in early May. 
"He never complained," Tracy said. "Give him a lot of credit. He handled it very professionally." 
The 5-foot-1 0, 180-pound Sanchez is more than a singles hitter. He has 45 doubles, two off the club record for a right-hand­ed hitter, a total never approached even by Hall of Farner Clemente. 
"He can flat out hit," said Pirates pitcher Marty McLeary, who came up in the Red Sox sys­tem with Sanchez. "He's always found a way to get it done." 
Sanchez also has been excep­tional in the clutch. His two-run single in the 11th inning Wednesday gave the Pirates a 10-9 win over the Cubs and raised his average with runners in scoring position to .419, the highest among NL players with 40 or more such at-bats. 
And while Albert Pujols often is called the NL's best clutch hitter, consider this: Going into Thursday's games, Sanchez had 65 RBis with runners in scoring position to Pujols' 68, even though Pujols had 39 homers to Sanchez's 6. 
Pujols, by the way, is making $14 million this season to Sanchez's $342,000. 
"He's been Mr. Clutch all year," Jason Bay said of Sanchez, who is trying to become the Pirates' first batting champion since Bill Madlock in 1983. 
Sanchez's enthusiasm, always­on personality and love of the game have turned his teammates into his biggest fans. He still likes taking batting practice, much as he did when he passed up Friday night dates as a California high schooler to hit in batting cages. In the minors, he had averages of .339, .328 and .341. 
"There isn't a guy in that club­house who isn't rooting for this kid to win the batting champi­onship," Tracy said. "He's just amazing. If you handed out bal­lots at the start of the season list­ing potential candidates to win the batting championship, I don't know of his name would have been on the list. Now he's a play­er who people will keep an eye on for years to come." 
Teammates such as Jack Wilson are urging Sanchez to not read the papers and skip watch­ing TV sports highlights so he doesn't get caught up in the race and starts pressing for hits. Not that they expect that from a hit­ter who has had consecutive starts without a hit only twice all season. 
"All you try to do is put the ball in play," Sanchez said, "And find some holes."

soccer because two top teams play each other early every year." 
Notre Dame's first game of the Classic will be tonight at 
7:30 against USC. Despite Notre Dame's intense football rivalry with the Trojans, the two women's soccer teams 
have not played a  regular  
season  game  during  
Waldrum's tenure.  

"Certainly, the two institu­tions have a lot of competition with each other, but the only time we've played them while I've been here was in a spring [exhibition] game," Waldrum said. ''I'm hopeful that after getting them here this year, this is a relationship we can continue after this year." 
The Broncos and Irish, on the other hand, have played several hard-fought games over the last few seasons. In 2003, Notre Dame won 2-1 in Santa Clara on a goal by then-sophomore Katie Thorlakson. In 2004 the Irish beat the Broncos twice ­once by a score of 5-2 in the regular season and then 1-0 in the national semifinal. 
Last season, Santa Clara ended its losing streak, beat­ing the Notre Dame 1-0 at the Broncos' home field. 
The Broncos are generally known for the explosive offense, but have only scored two goals in their first two games -a pair of 1-0 victo­ries over Wake Forest and Utah. Irish defender and sen­ior captain Kim Lorenzen said Notre Dame stiJl has to respect Santa Clara's for­wards. 
"Santa Clara is a challenge for us because they're very technical and creative where they're on the attack," Lorenzen said. "They're one of the best attacking teams in the NCAA." 
The Irish back wall will be once again without sopho­more defender Carrie Dew who, along with sophomore forward Brittany Bock, is competing in the U-20 World Championships in Russia. Freshmen Amanda Clark and Haley Ford have alternated in Dew's spot and will be called upon to help slow down the powerful Bronco attack. 
"[Clark and Ford] have real­ly stepped up," Lorenzen said. "We haven't missed a beat with Carrie gone, but at the same time we're really excit­ed to have her back starting next week." 
As for the Trojans, they come into tonight's contest 1­0-1, with a 4-1 win over UC­Santa Barbara and a score­less tie with UC-Irvine last weekend. While the two teams haven't played in a while, Lorenzen said the Irish have been focusing on USC this week and trying not to look ahead to Sunday against the Broncos. 
"We haven't played [USC] since I've been here," Lorenzen said. "I don't know anyone personally on their 
team, but most California schools are really good pro­grams. We're not looking past them at all."

Waldrum said he expects big crowds for the two home games, especially tonight. 


"I'm hoping that we get a really good crowd," he said. ''I'm sure the students want to do something the night before football season gets started."

Indiana 
continued from page 20 
The Irish expect the competi­tion to be just as stiff this year. 
"Whereas last weekend's tournament had three top-20 teams, you're talking about four top-20 teams this weekend," Notre Dame head coach Bobby Clark said, referring to Saint Louis, Indiana and No. 16 
. Connecticut. "These are all potential Final Four teams." Competitive games are noth­ing new when Notre Dame and Indiana take the field together. Over the past five seasons, the two teams have split their six contests, and it was the Irish who ended the Hoosiers' bid for fl second consecutive national title last November with a 2-0 win in the second round of the NCAA tournament. "There's a very healthy respect for the other in both camps," Clark said. "It's been a hard fought rivalry with great games, and we're lucky to have such a quality opponent in such close proximity." Indiana will enter this week­end with a record of 2-0-0 after finishing in first place at Notre Dame's Berticelli tournament last weekend. The Hoosiers defeated Creighton 1-0 in dou­ble overtime and edged UAB 2­

1. The Irish, who finished in second place with a record of 1­1-0 in the tournament, will have a chance to repay the favor this weekend. 
Notre Dame's other opponent this weekend, Saint Louis, has an impressive history at the Classic -owning an all-time record of 10-1-3. The Billikens also have a 9-3-1 record all­time against the Irish. Notre Dame, however, won the only match-up between the two teams last season by the score of 1-0 in overtime. 
Clark sees this as a positive in the high levels of competition this weekend for his team. 
"I believe in playing the best possible schedule you can," he said. "You only have eighteen regular season games, and you want to make every game as good as possible. Athletes love pitting themselves against good competition, and that's when you find out who the true com­petitors are." 
Plus, two wins this weekend will send a message. 
"It's an early opportunity to make a statement," he said. "We can either pass that oppor­tunity or grab it with both hands. I hope we grab it with both hands."

After two difticult games in the Mike Berticelli Memorial Tournament last weekend, Notre Dame will have no time to relax this weekend as it takes on No. 8 Indiana and No. 25 Saint Louis in the Adidas/IU Credit Union Classic in Bloomington. 
This will be the fourth con­secutive season Notre Dame has participated in the Hoosiers' annual event, one of the most competitive early-sea­son tournaments in the nation. On nine separate occasions, the eventual NCAA champion has participated in the Classic.

MIAA Alumnae Meet 
" 

opens year for Belles 
Exhibition race kicks off Bauters'· second year as head coach 
By BECKI DORNER Sports Writer 
Before every race, acclaimed running coach Mike FaneIIi would give his runners the same piece of advice: "Run the first part with your intellect, the middle 
part with your person­ality and the last part with your heart." 
Saint Mary's looks to fol­low this 

same advice Bauters to piece together a successful fall sea­son, combining smart train­ing, camaraderie and dedica­tion to both the craft of run­ning and to each other. 
The runners begin their fall 2006 schedule Saturday when the Belles play host to the pre­MIAA Exhibition Alumnae Meet. 

Second-year head coach Jackie Bauters stressed that the exhibition will be "a good opportunity to see where the team is at and what we need to work on." 
"Hopefully it will be a good time for the team and I can get a better idea of the tal­ent," Bauters said. 
Indeed, the squad is rela­tively young and unproven, with nine freshmen after graduating three seniors last season. 
But the Belles do enjoy a solid core of experienced returning runners. Senior cap­tains Meaghan Herbst, Sara Otto and Katie White will guide the freshmen. The three have been consistent in the past and hope to usher in a new era for the program. 
Last season Otto finished first or second for the Belles in every single meet she entered, with her best time of 
20:07 clocked at the MIAA Jamboree.

McKnight and day 
After being injured, Rhema McKnight returns to the field hoping to make an impact in 2006 
By BOB GRIFFIN Sports Writer 
Notre Dame wide re.eeiver 
Rhema McKnight stood. pnxious­
ly on the sideline' crutches 
tugged und~_). his· shoulder pad­
free No. ))·1e'f'sey, and watched 
the Iri~lt-offense explode under 
firsf year head coach Charlie 
Weis -his own leg preventing 
him from being part of the 
process. 
McKnight witnessed teammate 
Maurice Stovall go from a junior 
with 21 catches for 313 yards to 
a third round NFL draft pick. He 
saw his replacement, Jeff 
Samardzija, transform himself 
from an unknown receiver to a 
national celebrity. 
He observed his battery mate, quarterback Brady Quinn, pick apart opposing offenses as if they were Pop Warner squads, and tight end Anthony Fasano draw safeties away from the sideline routes he used to run with ease. 
And while he watched his teammates fmd success, his own place on the sidelines was a reminder of how close he came to being a part of it. McKnight came into 2005 with high expec­tations after a strong junior sea­son (42 catches, 610 yards, 3 touchdowns), but saw it fade away with one play in Ann Arbor. 
But instead of viewing that ill­fated crossing pattern as a hin­drance, he sees it as a cross­roads. 
Because while McKnight spent all but two games of last season unable to play, he now has a chance to re-establish himself on perhaps the most powerful offense in the country -a unit that undoubtedly developed that reputation without him. 
Patiently waiting 
McKnight's season didn't end when he was put on the shelf following the Michigan game on Sept. 10. Instead of catching passes, McKnight's responsibili­ties became centered on rehab­bing his knee and being a source of ofT-field support for his team­mates. 
It was not the ideal situation for a player who might have been an NFL draft pick with a full, productive season -a likely scenario given McKnight's talent and Notre Dame's success in 2005. However, it was a role the fifth-year senior accepted. 
But with a full year of anticipa­tion for the start of the 2006 sea­son and his subsequent return to college football -McKnight could not be more prepared. 
"I always said it would be nice to have two years in this offense and look what I got," McKnight said after practice Tuesday. "So I'm very thankful I'm back ... and I'm going to try to take advantage of it." 
McKnight trusts his coaches when they tell him he looks bet­ter now than he did in the past, despite having concerns last year regarding his injury and the timetable for his full recovery. . 
But maybe even more impor­tantly, McKnight trusts the men­tal strides he made last season when he was unable to perform physically. Studying game film is one thing, but being forced to watch plays develop from the sideline left McKnight with a new perspective on reading defenses. 
"I've had the opportunity to sit back on the sidelines, just watch other defenses, see how they rotate, watch corners ... I've been able to capitalize on the opportunity just to sit around and watch," McKnight said. 
And while McKnight stored the information·for a time when he would return to the field, he also shared it with his teammates ­notably Samardzija and Stovall -who could benefit from his insight. 
"Any time you have a veteran like that on the sidelines, unfor­tunately on the sidelines, he adds to what you see," Samardzija said after practice Tuesday. "He sees things that you can't."

advice and worked with it," McKnight said. "He made the best of an unfortunate situation and look where he's at now." 
Finding his own role

Sam ard zija would have been the third receiver, behind McKnight and Stovall, and had fewer opportunities to showcase his abilities. 

But instead of harboring bad feelings for his own misfortune, McKnight encouraged Samardzija and gave him advice throughout the season. This year, the two have been working on their rhythm since spring practice began.

Georgia Tech head coach Chan Gailey understands this· reality and studied old film of McKnight in order to prepare for Saturday's game. He also viewed tapes from last season in order to anticipate how McKnight might be used. 
"What you have to do is go and look at that position last year and see how that position was used," Cailey said in a telecon­fer('nee Tuesday. "Then you go back to prior tape and see how that person can adapt to that

Walker will have Asaph Schwapp blocking for him.  McKnight's career average of 13.3 yards per catch is impressive, and Samardzija's is even better.  
Chan Gailey has never won more than seven games in a season at Georgia Tech but has a penchant for beating top teams early in the season, including a 23-14 road win over No. 15 Auburn in the 2005 season opener and a 14-10 win over Miami in late November.  Georgia ·Tech's Reggie Ball is an inconsistent passer, completing less than 50 percent of his career passes and throw­ing four more intercep­tions (41) than touch­downs (37). But his ability to run has led to 1,097 yards and nine scores for the Yellow Jackets.  The Yellow Jackets return all four starters on the defensive line, a unit which held opponents to 103 yards per game on the ground in 2005. Third­year starting linebacker KaMichael Hall is the intimidating force behind the trenches with 121 career tackles.  The Yellow jackets have one returning starter in the secondary, and he is a good one. All-America candidate Kenny Scott will be responsible for shutting down Samardzija, but the three remaining members of the secondary have combined for two career starts.  
Despite the Irish per­formance in the Fiesta Bowl, Gailey said Weis ts one of the best coaches at finding his team's compar­ative advantage and exploiting it. Gailey's teams simply haven't had that success, losing at least one game per year by three touchdowns or more.  Both signalcallers have started since they were true freshmen, but Quinn is a pre-season favorite for the Heisman Trophy for a reason. The Dublin, Ohio, product is one of the nation's most effec­tive quarterbacks at reading defenses and checking off receivers.  
 The dual threats of Samardzija and McKnight for the Irish may equal the nations most feared and productive combination of receivers. Scott is an excellent eor­nerback, buthe.is only.om~ member of a four..tnan unit.through the air .. .....tr

Tashard Choice studied under Oklahoma standout tailback Adrian Peterson for a year before Choice transferred to Georgia Tech. Choice averaged 4.4 yards on 114 carries in 2005 as the backup to P.J.

Calvin Johnson has made his fair share of out­standing catches, but he has been wildly inconsis­tent, catching four or less passes eight times in 2005, while gaining more than 100 yards in three of the team's other four games. Meanhile, James Johnson has just two career starts.  Junior Travis Bell has never missed an extra point for Georgia Tech and is 19­for-22 on field goals shorter than 40 yards.

Notre Dame will pick apart the three inexperi­enced starters in the Georgia Tech secondary and put up a big number on the Yellow Jackets. Expect Quinn to throw 15-to-20 passes in the flfSt half as the Irish use the passing game to set up a Darius Walker-led rushing attack that will eat up the cloek once Notre Dame takes a com­manding lead. Georgia Tech will score some, but 
not nearly enough.

It will be a sweet victory for the Irish, who roll past a strong defense in the perfect warm-up for the Big Ten trifecta up next. McKnight and Samardizja shine, Walker's draws are deadly and Quinn is rarely off-tar­get. Notre Dame's defense is a surprising strength and shows off a suffocating pass rush. The Yellow Jackets give it their best, but the Irish dominate the line of scrimmage.

GEORGIA TECH 

BACKFIELD 
Reggie Ball has rushed for nearly 1,097 yards in his career, scrambling around defensive ends and slic­ing through lineback­ers. 
If Notre Dame's cor­ners are able to cover the two Johnsons well, Ball will' try to make the most of broken plays by using his speed and shiftiness with the ball tucked in his arm. 
His main cohort in the backfield will be Tashard Choice, who is taking over in a start­ing role for the Yellow

Jackets. Choice aver­aged 4.4 yards per carr in limited action last season.

NOTRE DAME 
RUN DEFENSE 
The Notre Dame's linebackers were strong against the run last season, but had trouble in pass cover­age and against dual­threat quarterbacks, including Michigan State's Drew Stanton. 
With junior Maurice Crum the only return­ing starter, it remains to be seen whether new starters Travis Thomas and Mitchell Thomas bring enough of an upgrade in speed to mitigate the unit's lack of experi­ence. 
Even if they can keep up with Ball and Choice, it's no guar­antee they can tackle them.

Johnson's big play ability worries Irish 
Size, strenghth, speed zvill test vulnerable secondary in opener 
By KEN FOWLER

He's bigger, he's stron~er and he's got better _pan ds than almost anyoneAfi~college foot­ball. Other than that, Georgia Tech junior Calvin Johnson is just a normal receiver. 
The 6-foot-5, 235-pound wide receiver was a second­team All-American in 2005 with 54 receptions for 888 yards. After just two years at Georgia Tech, Johnson is in the school's all-time top-10 in career receptions (1 03), yards {1,725) and touchdown catches (13). 
Notre Dame defensive backs coach Bill Lewis thinks Johnson is just as good as advertised. 
"When you read the com­ments that the coaches there in the ACC make about him ... he lives up to everything that's been said," Lewis said after Wednesday's practice. "He's among the best receivers in college football." 
Lewis said Johnson's combi­nation of size and strength ­along with his jumping ability 
is something usually reserved for the NFL. 
"He's got a 45-inch vertical jump. You put that on top of a 6-foot-4, 6-foot-5 guy -that's what makes him play so big," Lewis said. "You could be in perfect position. You could be in perfect position with two people. And he'll go up and out-jump two people for the ball because he's that kincl ol' a(hlete."

The Yellow Jackets lost 17-14 to North Carolina State last year when Johnson set person­al records with 10 catches for 130 yards. His five catches and 108 yards also went to waste in
