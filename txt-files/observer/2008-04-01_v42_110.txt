Immigrant admission policy examined 
Undocumented students could gain acceptance to University, but few actually apply 
By BECKY HOGAN News Writer 
After last fall's campus-wide forum on immigration, senior Michael Kozak was left with questions about the University's role in the debate. 
Kozak, who had completed a four-credit field study course on Mexican immigration last semester, was inspired to research the University admis­sions process for undocumented students. lle wanted to find out if Notre Dame allowed undocu­mented citizens -a genteel euphemism for illegal immi­grants -to apply and enroll. 
"Once we began researching we started finding that it is entirely possible for undocu­mented students to be admitted [to the University]," Kozak said. 
Assistant Provost for Enrollment Dan Saracino said while the University does not prohibit undocumented students from applying to Notre Dame, it does require that they apply as international students. 
"We have no policy against admitting an undocumented student if the student is aca­demically qualified," Saracino said. 
However, few apply, and few are admitted. Saracino said he wasn't certain the University had any undocumented stu­dents enroll in the past 10 years. 
The applicant pool is so small in part because a limited amount of fmancial aid is avail­able for international students. 
According to the Office Of Undergraduate Admissions Web site, the University "meets 100 percent of every student's demonstrated need," though it also requires international stu­dent applicants to submit a Certificate of Finances proving they can pick up the costs for their education. 
Because undocumented stu­dents are treated like interna­tional students, they must "be able to show the University that they have the funds to pay for a four year experience at Notre Dame," Saracino said. 
"A U.S. citizen and or a per­manent resident is eligible for federal grant money and federal loans, and then we are capable of meeting the difference of what the federal programs pro­vide," Saracino said. "We cannot afford to offer admission to undocumented students who can't afford to pick up the tab

ColU11111ist says era of religious right at an end 
Dionne claims Christian voters have shifted party affiliation over past three decades 
By CLAIRE REISING 
News Writer 
After over 20 years of associ­ation with right-wing conser­vatism, Christians are redefin­ing their relationship with poli­tics and moving away from the religious right to support the Democratic Party, Washington Post columnist E. J. Dionne Jr. said. 
"The era of the religious right is over. The end of the religious right does not signal an end to conservative Christianity," Dionne said in a lecture Monday in Carey Auditorium. "It's a sign of a reformation among Christians who are dis­entangling their great religious movement from a political machine." 
Christian conservatives have adopted "a broader definition of what it means to be a Christian in public life," he said. 
Dionne said religion has tra­ditionally been a conservative force but religious Americans are now focusing on other faith­influenced issues such as social justice and Jesus' emphasis on serving the poor. 
"This is a change which is now underway, for liberals and conservatives alike, to abandon their sometimes narrow view about who real Americans are and what they believe," he said. 
Voting trends among young people indicate this ideological shift, Dionne said when he com­pared Ronald Reagan's 1980 election with today's political climate. Voters under 30 voted three to two for Reagan, who was a Republican, but in 2006, young voters supported demo-

NDSP description matches Valpo suspect 
By BILL BRINK 
News Editor 
Notre Dame Security/Police (NDSP) has received new information about burglaries in Lyons Hall last week that may identify a suspect and link him to similar crimes at Valparaiso University, NDSP director Phil Johnson said Monday in an e-mail to The Observer. 
During the burglary, three laptops and two wallets were stolen from two unlocked rooms last Wednesday, NDSP assistant director Dave Chapman said last week. 
Johnson said "several peo­ple" had seen the man NDSP considers to be a suspect. He was described as a black male, between 5-foot-8 and 5­foot-11, with a thin build, "frizzy, long, black hair" in a pony tail or braid, possibly bad or missing teeth and pos­sibly facial stubble, Johnson said. 
The man had a duffle-type bag, Johnson said, and entered unlocked rooms when students were present. When he saw the students, he asked for someone by name who did not live in the room, Johnson said. 
NDSP learned from Valparaiso that similar rob­beries took place on its cam­pus in recent months, and the

CAMPUS LIFE COUNCIL 
Group discusses change to Orientation forn1at 
By KATIE PERALTA 
Assistant News Editor 
In its last meeting before the new administration takes office, the Campus Life Council 
(CLC) discussed improving the format of First Year Orientation (FYO) Monday. 
Brian Coughlin, assistant vice president for Student Activities, presented a plan to update and improve the first three days a freshman experiences on cam­pus. 
"The programming lof FYO] seemed awkward and forced ... with some of the inter-gender socialization," Coughlin said, referring to socializing activi­ties between men's and women's dorms typically planned for students during the orientation days. 
Coughlin said students have too little time to move into their rooms and say goodbye to their parents during the current FYO schedule and advocated free time for the students in his pro­posal. 
He also said more in-dorm activities should be planned for the weekend to foster friend­ships among men and women in their respective dormitories.

A guide for vvriting to Vievvpoint 
It's that time of the year again when Viewpoint becomes intensely 'Monologues' oriented. 
So here it is, a shameless plea 
Kara King 
for letters. But not just any let­
Viewpoint
ters. Good let­
Editor
ters. Articulate lntters. Lett11rs with a logical argument. 
Below arc some helpful tips for let­ter-writing, guaranteed to incrnase your chance of publication. 
1) Proofread -Don't just write a letter in anger and send it off. Hemember that you are submitting this for publication. It is not just a friendly (or not-so-friendly) e-mail. If there are typos or basic grammat­ic<d mistakes, your letter won't be taken seriously. llave some pride in your work. 
2) Sign your name-We have only printed one anonymous letter in our 42 year history. We are unlikely to do so again. If you are embarrassed by your opinions, perhaps you should reconsider sending it out t.lwrn for the world (or at least thn campus) to see. And sign your real name. We can't publish under psnu­donyms. 
3) Providn the necessary contact information-It's frustrating whnn wP. receive a well-writtnn IP.t.t<~r but cannot run it aftnr wn fail to get in touch with the author. If you'rn a student, give us your dorm and class ynar. If you're an alum. let us know when you graduatnd. And everyone should provide a phone number and valid n-mail address. 
4) Don't makn sluff up-If you quote facts or figurns, cite your sources at the end of the letter. 
5) Find something new to write about-This isn't necessarily a requirenH~nt. hut it improves the section as a whole. You can literally write about whatew1r you want. Write about something you care about. A passionate letter is much more likely to run and draw readers and responses. 
6) Keep it brief-I can't stress this one enough. Anything over :~50 words, and you'll be losing readers. It's supposed to be a letter, not a manifesto. Be coneise. You'll get your point across to more people if you can manage this one. 
7) Don't be afraid to ask -If' you have a time-sensitive topic, e-mail us ahead of time so we can do our best to aecommodate the letter. If' you're interested in writing a guest eolumn. let us know. We are open to suggestions. 
8) I do my best to print letters rep­resentative of what I receive, but I can't print nverything that comes in. If yours doesn't quite make it, find a new topic and try again.

WAUSAU, Wis. -Cars lining the street. A house full of young people. A keg and drinking games inside. Police thought they had an underage boozing party on their hands. 
But though they made dozens of teens take breath tests, none tested positive for alcohol. That's because the keg contained root beer. 
The party was held by a high school student who wanted to show that teens don't always drink alcohol at their parties. It has gained fame on YouTube.com. 
Dustin Zebro, 18, said he staged the party after friends at D.C. Everest High School got suspend­ed from sports because of pictures showing them drinking from red cups.

Dionne also said the problem of abortion needs new solutions, since it has been legal for 35 years, and even if Roe v. Wade was reversed, he said most states would still allow early-term abortions, and women would obtain tl_1em illegally. 
"Our rate is much higher than in other countries where abor­tion is legal," he said. "It seems to me the time has come for pro­choice people to acknowledge that abortion is a moral problem and tci understand why right-to­lifers see abortion as a moral evil and for pro-lifers to say, 'Let us pursue a strategy that will sub­stantially reduce the number of abortions in our nation."' 
Instead of arguing over issues like Roe v. Wade, which legalized abortion in the United States, Dionne proposed that both pro­life and pro-choice advocates should seek abortion-reducing policies, such programs that combine abstinence and contra­ceptive approaches to prevent unwanted pregnancy. 
While some religious Americans are redefining their political priorities, Dionne said secularism and neo-atheism are on the rise on the American political scene.

Scholar discusses sex inShakespeare 
Lecture examines sexuality in Elizabethan society, literature 
By MADELINE BUCKLEY 
News Writer 
Shakespeare scholar Stanley Wells used public records from Shakespeare's hometown Stratford-upon­Avon to understand the sexu­al behavior of Shakespeare and his contemporaries dur­ing his lecture "Sex and Literature in Shakespeare's Time" Monday. 
Sexual misconduct was not blatant under the eye of Q u e e n Elizabeth, 

who was often "It was a sexy that spread referred to as business. Rumors throughout 
the Virgin Europe on the­
circulated about the 
Queen, and atrical per­the church or sexual conduct of the formances and the state did players." Wells com­not tolerate pared the adultery, players who

incontinence dominated the 
or pre-marital Shakespeare scholar Shakespearian 
sexual experiences are reflected in his writing, Wells said. In Shakespeare's "As You Like It," Rosalind dis­cusses pre-marital sex, and in his Sonnet 151, Shakespeare gives an "extraordinary description of an erection, detailing the ris­ing and the falling of the penis," he said. 
This frank discussion of sexual encounters gave Elizabethan theater a bad reputation, Wells said. There were some religious leaders who blamed the plague 
sex, Wells said. 
"Stratford records give record of prosecution for for­nication," Wells said. 
In spite of the danger of punishment, evidence shows that Shakespeare himself engaged in pre-marital sex, as his wife Anne Hathaway was already pregnant at the time of their marriage, Wells said. It seems as though he escaped prosecution for this and escaped "scot-free." 
Shakespeare's personal 

stages to the current celebrity culture. 
"It was a sexy business," he said. "Rumors circulated about the sexual misconduct of the players." Like actors now, players were scrutinized for more than their acting skills, Wells said. 
While prostitution was also a component of Elizabethan society, it is left out of much literature of the time, Wells said. Although the practice did occur, public records are scarce on the subject, he said. However, one prison record indicated the exis­tence of a prostitute from Shakespeare's hometown. A woman by the name of Elizabeth Evans lived a color­ful life as a prostitute until she was finally arrested for using a 5 year-old girl to earn money as a prostitute, Wells said. 
Homoeroticism was anoth­er scandalous literature theme "in vogue" at the time of Shakespeare, he said. 
Although sodomy was pun­ishable by death, "male-to­male relationships were com­mon," he said. Most famous­ly, accounts detail the sexual exploits of Queen Elizabeth's successor, King James I, Wells said. His "fondness for handsome young men" is well documented, he said. 
While homoerotic themes were popular in the literature of Shakespeare's contempo­raries, and many believe that some of Shakespeare's work falls in the same category, Wells is skeptical that Shakespeare's writing can be classified as homoerotic. 
"Shakespeare succeeds in writing verses that could be applied to homoeroticism," Wells said, "but ultimately, he simply captures the very essence of human love."

Kozak is not satisfied with the University's claim that undocu­mented students are a financial burden. 
"We're not talking about droves of undocumented stu­dents." Kozak said. "We're not dealing with huge numbers. Personally. I don't think that it's the burden (the University( is making it out be."

Kozak, however, said the poli­cy should be changed to simplify the process of applying as an undocumented student or to receive a student visa. 
"Undocumented immigrants have to physically go back their country [of origin! to get a visa ... getting an international stu­dent visa is extremely difficult in and of itself," Kozak said. 
Kozak said reevaluating the current policy is part of the University's duty as part of its Catholic mission. 
"In the same way that the University does not deny admis­sion to poor people because of the additional burden they will place on financial aid, it ought not deny admission to undocu­mented immigrants based on financial ease alone," Kozak said. "This is a moral decision

Saraeino mentioned a female applicant from California who is in the ·proc-ess of attaining per­manent residency prior to join­ing the Class of' 2012. 
"We just sent .a letter to California Senator (Dianne( Feinstein on behalf of' the stu­dent asking her do her best to expedite this process.... We want that student to be able to start here in the fall," he said. 
Saracino said tlwre has been no discussion about changing the University's 1:urrent policy toward undocumented immi­grant applicants. 
there are public 

and private non­Catholic colleges and universi­ties that admit undocumented students and offer them aid to finance their education. 
lie said Harvard University and Princeton University are two of the non-Catholic, highly visible institutions that accept undocumented students and provide them with financial aid. I Iarvard had 10 undocumented students and Princeton had at least one in 2006, the most recent year for which figures are available. 
Kozak said there are local institutions that accept undocu­mented students, like Saint Mary's. 
Dan Meyer, vice president of enrollment management at Saint Mary's, said the College 
evaluates undocumented immi­
grants just as they would any 
other applicant. 

"We accept undocumented students because when we go through the admissions process we may or may not know if a student is undocumented," Meyer said. "The decision is just based on academic qualifica­tion. We do not want to penalize a student if she is undocument­ed." 
When an undocumented stu­dent applies for financial aid at Saint Mary's, she is not guaran­teed to receive full financial aid from the College since Saint Mary's does not guarantee meeting 100 percent of stu­dents' demonstrated need, Meyer said. 
"She has to rely on her family and her extended family to fmance her education," he said. 
Unlike the University's policy, however, undocumented stu­dents are considered for schol­arships from the College in the same way any other student would be considered. 
"We also make a decision on the level of academic scholar­ship she qualifies for," Meyer said. "We apply the same stan­dards across the entire appli­cant pool." 
Saint Mary's did change the way undocumented students apply for aid this year. They are now required to complete a paper version of the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). The College uses this application to assess a stu­dent's eligibility for aid. 
'This year the change in poli­cy was carefully analyzed and reviewed. We feel it's consistent with our mission as a Catholic institution," Meyer said. 
Although Meyer could not give an exact number, he said that there were less than a dozen undocumented students admit­ted last year.

HUD Secretary resigns from duty 
Jackson steps down from post amid speculation of political favoritism 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -I-IUD Secretary Alphonso Jackson, his tenure tarnished by alle­gations of political favoritism and a criminal investigation, announced his resignation Monday amid the wreckage of the national housing crisis. 
IIe leaves behind a trail of unanswered questions about whether he tilted the Department of Housing and Urban Development toward Republican contractors and cronies. 
The move comes at a shaky time for the economy, with soaring mortgage fore­closures imperiling the nation's credit markets.

Judge warns of alcoholdangers 
Magistrate takes courtroom to high school to shaw drunk-driving consequences 
Associated Press 
BELEN, N.M. -Marlene Chavez stood before a hushed courtroom, acknowl­edging the consequences of her second drunken-driving offense. Among the specta­tors were hundreds of teenagers who hung on her every word. 
"I lost a lot of things," said Chavez, 43. "I left my vehicle in the impound so that I don't do drinking and driving after that. And I lost my house. 1 lost my kids to their father so that they can go stay with him because I had nowhere to go." 
Chavez had already plead­ed guilty. Now a judge gave her four days in jail and a $500 fine. But her sentence came with an additional indignity: It happened in a high school auditorium, where 400 students stared as she lifted one leg, then the other, to let jailers shackle her feet. Guards also wrapped a chain around her waist and handcuffed her. 
When the hearing ended, she was escorted out of Belen High School, about 30 miles south of Albuquerque, and locked up. 
Magistrate Daniel Hawkes brought his courtroom to the school in hopes that the pro­ceedings will show students the dangers of alcohol, espe­cially in the weeks leading up to the prom and gradua­tion. 
Hawkes, whose program is unique in New Mexico, also senteneed two people at the school last year. lie brings with him a plywood court bench emblazoned with a New Mexico Supreme Court seal. The makeshift court­room also includes U.S. and New Mexico flags. 
Ed Chavez. chief justice of the high court and no rela­tion to Marlene Chavez, said he would like to see the pro­gram go statewide. 
When the hearing began, 18-year-old Angel Mendez didn't realize the seriousness of the proceedings. But after watching Marlene Chavez and four other repeat offend­ers get sentenced, he changed his view. 
"I thought it was pretty shocking just to see them like that. I didn't think they would have them in shack­les," he said. 
Elizabeth Sluder, 17, was initially skeptical, too, think­ing the hearing was overly staged. But she also ehanged her mind by the end. 
"You see your friends, you know, they're like, 'I'm going to go out to this party.' But you never see the conse­quences of them getting in trouble or getting in an acci­dent, or any kind of conse­quence of driving drunk," she said. "But here, it's actu­ally being brought to us. It does happen, there are con­sequences." 
Michael A. Martone, a Michigan judge, started the first court-in-schools pro­gram in 1993, sentencing offenders who pleaded guilty to charges ranging from drunken-driving to assault and battery. lie has held hearings at high schools and middle schools in Troy and Clawson, Mieh. 
In 2000, Martone's pro­gram became the model for the outreach program at thn National Judicial College in Heno. Nev. Hawkes said he learned of the program while attending the judicial eol­lege. 
Other touches he came up with himself, including his mobile courtroom, which is hauled around in a trailer that he bought for $6,800. On the side of the trailer is: "Judicial Outreach Team. Courts are the crossroads of prevention. It's NOT KOOL to SKIP School. Stay in school." 
Sluder was struck by the emotional impact of the sen­tencing and the statements from the defendants. 
"I can't imagine how those people felt standing up and having to talk to all of us kids, especially because we ean see them in the commu­nity," she said. "It just makes it real."

IN BRIEF 
Lehamn Brothers filing suit for fraud 
TOKYO -Lehman Brothers filed suit Monday against major Japanese trading company Marubeni, demanding $350 million in damages in a case of alleged fraud. 
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. is seeking to recoup funding it provided to another Japanese company that the U.S. bank says employees of Marubeni Corp. helped secure. 
The Tokyo District Court confirmed the lawsuit was filed. A Lehman Brothers official, who spoke on condition of anonymity citing policy, said the lawsuit demands $350 million. Other details were not immediately available. 
Marubeni, which has repeatedly denied wrong­doing, said it has not yet seen the lawsuit and could not comment. But it reiterated it has no obligation to repay the money, which was provid­ed to a unit of ITT Bio-Pharma, a medical con­sulting_ company. The unit has since declared bankruptcy. 
Vytorin's makers see drop in shares 
NEW YORK-Shares of Merck & Co. and Schering-Plough Corp. fell to record lows Monday, as analysts warned new clinical data would cause sales of their blockbuster choles­terol drug Vytorin to fall further. 
The companies market Vytorin through a joint venture, but earlier this year, partial results from a clinical study showed that it was no more effective at limiting plaque buildup than Merck's Zocor, a drug that is already available in generic form. Full results of that study weJ,"e released Sunday. 
Vytorin is a combination of Zocor and Schering-Plough's drug Zetia. 
Schering-Plough shares plunged as low as $14, touching their lowest levels since August 1996. Merck shares fell as low as $36.82, their lowest since June 2006. 
Leading physicians are now recommending the use of older drugs called statins before put­ting patients on Vytorin. Many physicians had prescribed Vytorin in lieu of higher doses of statins because of what some said was an undue fear of side effects. 
"There was an irrationality to begin with," said Dr. John LaRosa, president of State University of New York Downstate Medical Center.

New economic strategy proposed 
Federal Reserve overhaul will not ease current problems but help in the future 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -It's a Herculean task: revamping a financial regulatory sys­tem dating back to the Civil War to deal with 21st cen­tury crises imperiling the country. 
Under an ambitious Bush administration plan, the Federal Reserve would take on the unwieldy role of uber cop in charge of financial market stability. Other regulatory agencies could see their in!1uence diminished. 
The proposal won't fix the host of economic and financial problems that threatens to plunge the United States into a deep recession, but it might help guard against future trou­bles. It would take years and a lot of political wran­gling -in Congress, on Wall Street, in statehouses and elsewhere -to imple­ment all the changes envi­sioned.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 

Back to the issues 
This is no response to any specific Viewpoint article, but rather to the over­flow of press coverage regarding Barack Obama's relationship with his church pastor, Hev. Jeremiah Wright. It occurmd to me that the media has seemed to place an unfair weight on the relationship Obama has shared with Wright over the ye<:W"s. For anyone unaware of the issue, Wright is the pas­tor of Trinity Church and recently became famous for his controversial remarks regarding race in America. While I do not need to go into the specifics of his comments, they are seen as quite heated and contentious. 
The media since then has been highly critical of Obama's relationship with his pastor, and rightly so. If we are to elect an individual to the highest public office in this country, are we not allowed to scrutinize their character? After all, a lot may to be said by the people with whom we associate. However, the media has taken it too far. 
Before I go on, I should state that I am not a Barack Obama supporter, nor am I a Clinton supporter. I simply want to see a fruitful debate among the Democratic Party that is fair and worthy to produce 

a candidate to the general election. Obama recently answered questions regarding his relationship with Wright, 
and even went on to comment on racial divisions that still exist today. 
I have to admit I was extremely impressed with the articulate Obama and can fully understand why he is such an attractive candidate to a lot of people. But even with his answers, the media did not let it go. They still ask the pierc­ing questions concerning his character, almost as if to make up for previous lack of scrutiny. 
All I ask is that we do not forget the issues. While it is easy to say that this upcoming election is a momentous one for the history of our country (every presidential election cycle says that), it does have importance. We are currently in a war that has passed its fifth anniversary. We have major issues with the continuation of social security. The economy appears to be in a slump. We have serious thinking to do in the com­ing years. 
I want to know both where Obama stands and what he has done in the past as a senator to affirm those belief's. Sure, it is easy to go on his Web site and read about it, but I want to listen to him artic­ulate it more. I want the media to foster debate about the issues. I want to know how Obama will manage to stabilize the Middle East with his steady withdrawal of American troops. I want more specifics on government-sponsored healthcarc. Exactly how will it work? What are the consequences? 
These arc only a few of the many issues on which the media could focus, but instead their attention is elsewhere. Do I think scrutinizing character is unimportant? No. But I do believe the media has to do a better job balancing that with debate among the issues. 
I do not support Obama, and I disagree with what I do know of his stance on issues. Alii ask is give him an opportuni­ty to make a case for what he believes in. Debate amongst the issues will better serve this country in the long run.

'Monologues' 

refusal 

I am a woman. I refuse to be objectified. I refuse to be mocked. I refuse to be trivialized. I refuse to be debased. I refuse to be used. I refuse to be stereotyped. I refuse to be violated. I refuse to be valued only for one part of my body, and for how I utilize that part of the whole that is myself -a woman. I especially refuse to do so under the guise of "empowerment." I refuse to support "The Vagina Monologues."

Support academic 
freedom 
While I personally wish the Vagina Monologues were not performed at Notre Dame (or anywhere for that matter). I fully support Fr. Jenkins' deci­sion to allow the performanc­es this year, consistent with the guidelines on academic freedom he articulated two years ago. 
I have been criticized by fel­low alumni in my local region for that support. One member of our alumni club removed me from her e-mail list, stat­ing that Satan is clearly at work here because our friendship has been am~cted. I don't understand this. We have a different understand­ing of academic freedom; that in no way affects how I feel about her as a friend and fel­lowalum. 
One thing keeps coming to mind that I wish she and Bishop D'Arcy and others would realize. At Notre Dame, 
unlike most if not all other campuses, there are real choices. Such choices, it seems to me, are only to be expected in an environment where both Catholic charac­ter and true academic free­dom are vibrant. In addition to the performance of "The Vagina Monologues," students at Notre Dame last weekend hosted the Edith Stein Conference lor the third con­secutive year. Notre Dame students have also developed a Notre Dame-specific alter­native play. There are just so many examples of God's work on campus and among the alumni. Once again let it be said, "Only At Notre Dame."

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Patriotic protest 

Impressionable youth 
As a senior leader in Army ROTC who faces the likely prospect of being sent to Iraq in the next year or two, I found the discussion about last week's protest interesting. I would like to offer my two cents and thank those who started and continued what I found to be a thoughtful and well­timed protest. 
What are you supporting by sup­porting the war? The Army does not declare war, Congress does. A soldier takes no part in deciding whether or not to go to war; a soldier goes to war when he or she is told to by the gov­ernment. 
Since we are fortunate enough to be governed by a democracy, "the peo­ple" are essentially the ones who decide to go to war, and our support of the war means supporting the cause and the deployment of troops to realize that cause. If you do not sup­port the war, you are simply opposing a government decision, and the best way to support the troops in that case is to discourage the government from sending troops into harm's way (in a thoughtful manner, of course). 
A soldier's mission is to support and defend the people of the United States and its Constitution; to support a sol­dier is to support this mission, not necessarily a particular war. Patriotism does not mean blindly fol­lowing the dictates of the present administration; it means encouraging the course of action which is best for our nation and the whole world. 
The recent protest, by provoking thought and discussion about that best course of action, was an act of patriotism.

"The Vagina Monologues" have stirred up a lot of passion in many students at Notre Dame. This led stu­dents to a debate with each other and panelists, and as a result, I witnessed one of the most compelling and insightful conversations I have ever seen. 
This exploration of sexuality strengthened my own ideas on the subject, which I would classify as conservative. Not changed, strength­ened. Bishop D'Arcy has noted that college students are impressionable, and such a play could be dangerous to our Catholic understanding of sex­uality. 
There are many aspects of the . world we live in that could be danger­ous for a young Catholic to see. For example, The Keenan Revue protrays college boys who are open about their sex lives, scenes of masturbation, and scenes demeaning to women. Yet tick­ets to the Keenan Revue sell out with­in half an hour of availability. 
Clearly, Notre Dame students are regularly exposed to "sexual revolu-

Disability awareness not just for March 

Revive the concert 
Disabilities are something that I'm sure many people on our campus do not think much about. I think about them every day. 
I have a learning disability, and at the very beginning of my freshmen year, I felt like I was the only one on campus who did. That all changed when I was invited to get together with other students with disabilities to create a group. We started meeting every week and eventually called ourselves Perspectives. This came about because we feel that being a per­son with a disability at Notre Dame gives you a different perspective, but also because we want people with normal abilities to try and understand that. 
Our goal is to offer support to each other and promote awareness and edu­cation about disabilities. Having a dis­ability is not a necessary component to membership, just an interest in our goal. We worked hard to gain group status, and I am very proud of the work we have done. We have had panels, simulations, and socials, and have worked with other groups such as Best Buddies and the Logan Center. It has been a very reward­ing journey. 
I write because March is Disability Awareness month. There have been many great events, but the promotion of disability awareness does not have to end. There is so much that you can do. You can be more understanding of people with disabilities all year and educate yourself. 
I invite anyone who is interested in any of this to join Perspectives. It has been one of the best parts of my four years here at Notre Dame.

PERSPECTIVES: APRIL 1, 1991 
Bored on a cold day, watching UCLA blow Xavier out of the water, I was lis­tening to music on my computer to make the game go by faster. I was lis­tening to Bruce Springsteen when I wondered, when was the last time Bruce played at Notre Dame? 
Let's just go this far, most readers of the Observer weren't born yet. So I decided to look into the online archives of The Observer to find a mention of the Boss, and one com­pletely blew me away. 
Just over four years ago, on Feb. 9, 2004, there was an article labeled: "University rejects concert." I first thought, "they canceled a potential Bruce concert!" I then reasoned with myself that there probably wasn't enough money. I continued to search on, but upon returning to "University rejects concert," I discovered a horri­ble incident. 
According to the article, Norte Dame SUB has planned potentially the great­est concert in Notre Dame history­even greater than the 2001 U2 con­cert. U2 and Bruce Springsteen in the Stadium. 
Upon reading this, I choked on my Arizona Iced Tea and did a double take. I was shocked that SUB could pull something like this together, but once again I thought, "It must be a pipe dream and there is not enough funding." As I read on, I discovered that SUB had raised $250,000 over the estimated $1.25 million required for this show. Not only was money not a problem, but the reason for the con­cert was not just the pleasure of Notre Dame, St. Mary's, and Holy Cross stu­dents, but for a greater good: all pro­ceeds from the concert were going to fund the AIDS effort in Africa. 
After skimming it, I read deeper into tion propaganda." "The Vagina Monologues" offered students an opportunity to discuss complex issues of female sexuality, and each panelist gave an alternative to the sexual rev­olution. 
Is there a better place to be exposed to the sexual revolution than Notre Dame? I doubt that, had the play been held elsewhere, anyone would have cared to conduct such a respectable conversation as the debate on Friday night. 
You cannot hide reality from us. It will hit us eventually. I thank Fr. Jenkins and the organizers of "The Vagina Monologues" for offering a dose of the reality of sexuality in the world today, and providing me with a remarkable and beautiful response that I probably would not have recieved anywhere else but Notre Dame. 
Flannery Kearney sophomore Pangborn Hall Mar. 29 

the article to find out why this epic endeavor was never carried out. I found it: University spokesman Matt Storin said the proposal was not approved by the administration. "Several university officers considered this proposal and decided that we did not have the resources or personnel to pull off an endeavor of this size within the necessary time frame," Storin said. 
At this I became very upset. I mean, a university that has enough security, personnel, parking, and other resources to maintain order on the six to seven home game weekends each year can't provide enough for a one­time concert that would cater to far fewer patrons? Notre Dame had a chance to host one of the greatest con­certs of the decade and the adminis­tration balks. 
I also wonder what happened to SUB continuing to fight for this endeavor. At the end of the article there is a mention of how this idea will come to be, but there have been no echoes of it coming to fruition, not a mention in the rest of the Observer archives. 
In the end, I can only stare back at the University's missed chance to host two musical talents that have com­bined to sell more than 200 million albums. The chance of a lifetime spurned. 
I hope that SUB has great events in motion for the 2008-09 season, but I also hope this can get gears turning again because settling for one hit won­ders and alternative rock shouldn't be the highlights of a year

RICH at1d REAL 

Since coming unto the scene in 1999, Explosions in the Sky has mad some of' the most intense, emotionally rich music in tlw genn~ of post-rock. 
Put simply, post-rock is the use of' rock instruments like guitars, drums, and bass to creato musical styles that are not common to rock music. Most post-rock bands, including Explosions in the Sky, arn purely instrumental. 
The band creates beautifully layered textures and narra­tivn guitar linus with their instruments, and uses this talent to grab the listener. 
In 2000, they released their first album, "!low Strange, lnnoconee". It was first released on just 300 CD-Rs, but they rn-reloasnd it in 2005, and fans were able to soc how they got thnir start. 
In tho dobut album album, their sound is more stripped down. but their car for arrangemonts is apparent. Songs like "Snow and Lights" and "Glittering Blackness" show basie tcxturns that are tho beginnings of more thir:kly layered songs on their later albums. 
Thn album "Tho Earth Is Not a Cold Dead Place" from 2003 presents a hopeful view of life. While the title says the Earth is not awful. one had to think it was initially to need that kind of' assurance. 
In "Tho Earth Is Not a Cold Dead Place," the band fully

work still provides some solid songs. 
The band also released an EP entitled "The Rescue" in 2005, in which they wrote and recorded a song a day for eight consecutive days. In many ways, this is their most accessible due to the relatively short lengths of the songs. The band also did the entire soundtrack to the film "Friday Night Lights." 
The music of Explosions in the Sky is some of the most explosive (no pun intended), rich, emotional, cathartic and beautiful music you will ever hear. The fact that they are. able to draw so much out of basic rock instruments is· incredible. The music of Explosions in the Sky is almost too epic, if only it didn't fit so well within our lives.

Stepan Center is not exactly the ideal spot for a con­cert. Not only is it acoustically stifling, but also remi­niscent of chemistry related events, including dreaded Organic Chemistry exams. Additionally, it takes a bit of a hike from civilization to reach the complex. Nonetheless, on Friday night the lights came up on Stepan Center when Jack's Mannequin took the stage. 
Jack's Mannequin's Andy McMahon was a member of Something Corporate before writing his own songs while the band was taking a break. His songs from the hiatus became the first and only album of the newly formed Jack's Mannequin, "Everything in Transit." The album has slowly gained a wide following, and a new one is expected soon. 
The real story behind Jack's Mannequin is unusual for a band riding the punk-pop wave. After the album was recorded in 2005, the band was ready to go on tour to promote it. Just before the tour, McMahon was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. His little sister was the marrow donor, and he made a full recov­ery. They are now touring and will eventually end up on the Warp Tour circuit. 
The set was typical, except for the large black grand piano center stage. No opening band in sight, Andy McMahon and his crew bounded onto the set at around 
9:15. Bursting into the opening chords of "Dark Blue," 

cacophonic ride of li an there. Drums, bass, guitar and piano managed to cre­ate a sound full enough to elevate the crowd to eupho­ria. 
The crowd stood on its feet the whole time as differ­ent people sang along with different snippets of songs. Though few people know the album by heart, man people have heard their songs and were able to get into it along with McMahon. 
The artist spent the evening banging on the piano. He felt the music to the point that he appeared almost par­alyzed at moments. McMahon never sat, but hunched over the keys and sang into the mic with his head turned toward the audience. It was almost existential to watch him completely living within the sound of his own music. 
Most of the songs from "Everything in Transit" were performed. Near the end of the evening, McMahon s calmly at his keys and played a more introspective off the album yet to be released. 
The band played for an hour and 20 minutes, includ­ing one encore. When they left the stage the second time they ignored the cr·owd 's cry for another song, leaving the audience to mistakenly cheer the roadies the lights came up. The evening was generally deemed a suc;cess by everyone. The energy that had bee buzzing for an hour and a half was carried out into night as students walked home under the stars.

Special to the Observer 
Women's water polo 
The nation's top-ranked club proved worthy of its status as Notre Dame captured the pres­tigious Miami Invitational in Oxford. Ohio this weekend. On Friday, the Irish opened play against the Pennsylvania, the No. 8 team in the country. The game was back-and-forth, with the Irish coming back from a two-goal deficit in the fourth quarter to tie it at 9-9. After Bridget O'Neil fouled out early in the fourth quarter with five goals, Kelly Horner took over in ovnrtime, scoring a hat trick in the extra periods to lead the Irish to a 12-10 vic­tory. Ali Durkin, Kristen llarchut and Cristina Homano nach contributed a goal, while goalie Betsy O'Neill made 12 saves. 
On Saturday, the Irish defeated Wisconsin 14-4. O'Neill and Homano led the squad with four goals apiece, and Horner added another three. Durkin, Emily Harig and Beth Nagel also each splashed one home for the Irish. Goalies O'Neill and Maggie Hyde split the cage, making a combined nine saves. 
The Irish then defeated No. 6 Michigan 5-3 Saturday night. 
In the championship game on Sunday, the Irish finally met No. 3 Cal Poly in a long-antici­pated game that lived up to its expectations. In the end, the Irish came from behind to win 4-3. O'Neill hit a lob shot in the second quarter to tie the score 1-1 at the half. Poly opened the second half with two goals, taking a 3-1 lead at the end of the third quarter. But Notre Dame picked it up in the fourth quarter, scoring three unanswered goals. Homano hit a cross-cage shot on a man-up opportunity then Harig nailed one from outside. Finally, Kennifer muscled the winning goal by the keeper from set, as the Irish won by a final score of 4-3. O'Neill came up huge in the win, keeping the goal clear for two quarters while recording five saves. 


Men's volleyball 
In their final tune-up before nationals, the Irish traveled to Columbus, Ohio, to play in the annual MIVA tournament. The tournament brought together 30 teams from three of the most competitive conferences in the nation. With an incon­sistent season thus far, the Irish looked to gain some sta­bility and momentum going into nationals. 
In the opening day, the Irish were placed in a six-team pool. Notre Dame played tough all day, but was unable to pull out any victories. The Irish dropped dose contests to Minnesota, Indiana and Cincinnati, while defeating Bowing Green. The Irish went 1-3 on the day, losing five sets by a combined 11 points to put them in a deep hole for the second day. The Irish entered the single elimination bracket portion of the tournament with the No. 17-seed and plenty of difficult matches ahead of them. 
Notre Dame's first opponent Sunday morning was Grand Valley State. The Irish came out flat in the first game, giv­ing up several short runs that turned into a large deficit and a convincing 25-18 win for Grand Valley State. Aggressive serving by freshman Jason Healy kept the Irish in the sec­ond game, which was close until the end. A strong defen­sive push tipped the score in the favor of Notre Dame as they closed out a squeaker, 25­
22. The momentum carried into the third set as the Irish dominated, 15-8. 
The next match pitted the Irish against conference rival Marquette, a team that defeat­ed Notre Dame twice during the season. But the Irish played their most inspired vol­leyball of the day as they burst out of the gates. Outside hit­ting by Mark Iandolo carried the Irish to the end as they took the first set easily. But the Golden Eagles did not go down easily as they responded with a strong 17-25 win that sent the match into a third game. Middle blocker Mike Nejedly fueled Notre Dame's early push with phenomenal attack­ing, giving the Irish an early lead they never relinquished on their way to the match vic­tory, 15-11 in the third game. 
In the quarterfinals, Notre Dame defeated Dayton 25-17, 26-24. 
For the right to play in the championship, Notre Dame faced No. 4 Lakeland College. Despite forceful hitting by out­side hitter Dan Zibton, who was also named all-confer­ence, the Irish looked as if the seven previous matches had taken their toll. The Muskies took control and didn't relent, beating Notre Dame in consec­utive sets and sending the Irish home with a third-place finish. 


Rugby 

Notre Dame swept Loyola College in a pair of dominating victories on Saturday in Skokie, Ill. The A-side opened play with a convincing 66-0 win marked by Chris Harrington's three tries. Patrick Toole and Bob Huguelet each added a pair of tries, while Ben Frost, Andy Mullen and Chris Brown scored one apiece. Don Greiwe was 8-of-10 on two­point conversions. The Irish preserved their 28-0 halftime lead with a three-minute goal line stand to close the half. 
Dan Blakely also scored three tries for the Irish in the B-side's 55-0 whitewashing of Loyola. 

Men's rowing 

Notre Dame opened its spring season with a trip to Grand Rapids, Mich., where the team raced in the Lubber's Cup Regatta. The Irish raced in fours and eights in a fast current and unusually warm regatta conditions. Notre Dame faced some of the best crews in the northern Indiana and Michigan area, along with the University of Rochester from New York. 
The Irish novice boats were the highlight of the Notre Dame performance as they took home a total of 16 medals and one trophy. In the eights, the novice first boat had a dominating performance. The crew won the race with open water on the next boat and brought the large, golden cup trophy back to Notre Dame. The second novice boat took second in its race. In the fours, the Irish novice continued to show powerful performances, winning both the novice A race and the novice B race. The third novice four took fourth place in the B race as well. 

Cycling 

The Irish resumed competi­tion at Michigan State and Michigan with racers in every category but men's B. The road race consisted of a 4. 7­mile loop with a 1.25-mile sec­tion of dirt road. The men's C had an all-star line-up looking to win the race, while the B entry women's squad was seeking more experience. With numerous break away attempts from rookie Kirk Post, the pace of the race was fast. But the rest of the pack worked against Post and kept him on a short leash. The Irish benefited, though, with Nate Farley netting fifth place and Josh Johnson finishing eighth. Post came in just behind in 12th place. 
Laura Simons and Caitlin Sullivan competed in the women's B race and finished 18th and 22nd. Veterans Jenn Perricone and Meghan Johnson new the argyle in the women's A 45-mile race. The soft and difficult dirt section took its toll on the field. Perricone came in 1Oth behind an old and experienced field with Johnson taking 13th. 
The men's A race consisted of 35 riders, including Tim Campbell and Mike Lavery. The 55-mile race started off pretty tame, but the attacks started the third lap of the race. Campbell finished slight­ly behind the dwindled main field in 13th place. 
The D men, who started right after the A men, had a short 20-mile race. The entire field was on the attack, but it was Irish riders John McDunough and Adam Bee that joined another rider the make the 3-man break of the day. McDunough drilled the pace hard and consequently dropped back from the group to rejoin the pack, finishing 13th. Bee went on to win the sprint for first place, giving the Irish their first win of the sea­son. John Dailey and Mike O'Connor also finished with the pack and did not place. 
Sunday's races started with a twilight D men's criterium on the University of Michigan campus. The D men had a short but furious 20 minute race. All four Irish riders drilled the pace on the course and caused mass suffering in the peleton. McDunough pulled in front in as he went for the victory, but his push was reeled back in. This set up Bee once again as Bee won the group sprint. Dailey took fourth place and O'Connor came in slightly out of the placing. 

Men's water polo 

The Irish hosted their annual Alumni Tournament at Rolfs Aquatics. The event featured Purdue, Mercyhurst, Monmouth, and the Notre Dame Alumni team. In addition, a Notre Dame B squad competed. The team was comprised mostly of the club's large freshmen class. 
In Notre Dame's first game, against Monmouth on Saturday morning, the club came out strong to take a quick 4-0 lead in the first quarter before winning 15­3. 
In their second game, the Irish faced a much tougher opponent in Mercyhurst, a division II varsity team with several All-American play­ers. The Irish fell 12-6. Notre Dame came out fired up and managed to hit the back of the net five times in the first half as Fordonski and Dunn each scored twice and senior Zhan-Wei Khaw netted one to forge a 5-5 tie at the half. 
But the Irish were unable to keep up the pace in the second half and began to seriously tire in the third quarter. Mercyhurst quickly pulled ahead by five goals and the Irish were only able to respond with one by Connors. The game slowed in the fourth quarter as Mercyhurst scored two more unanswered goals for the easy victory. 
The last game of the day for the Irish A team was against the ND Alumni team. The two squads kept the score neck-and-neck for the entire game before the Irish pulled out an 11-10 victory. 
The final game of the weekend against Purdue was also a nail-biter, with the Irish squeaking out a 10-9 win. Connors lit up the goal in the first quarter, scoring three right off the bat before Dunn added one to make it 4-1 the end of the quarter. Purdue bounced back in the third quarter to tie it up, and the two teams battled it out in the fourth with Connors, Dunn, and Fordonski scoring one goal each. Purdue answered with an additional three goals to knot the score at 7-7. The game ended in a shootout as goalie Jon Kelly performed spectacularly for the Irish, blocking three Purdue shots. Damian Sharratt, Sebastian Andres-Testero, and Fordonski all scored in the shootout to give Notre Dame the victory.

North Carolina's Tyler Hansbrough and Kansas State's Michael Beasley were unanimous selections to The Associated Press' All­America team Monday. For the first time, no senior was chosen. 
Beasley and Kevin Love of UCLA made it two straight years there were two fresh­men chosen. Sophomore D.J. Augustin of Texas and junior Chris Douglas-Roberts rounded out the selections, shutting out the seniors. 
Until this group, Hansbrough, a junior and the . Atlantic Coast Conference player of the year, and Beasley, the Big 12 player of the year and third freshman to lead the country in rebounding, were named on all 72 ballots and received 360 points from the same national media panel that selects the weekly Top 25. 

"To be one of just two players in the country to receive such an honor is very humbling, n said Beasley, who led Kansas State to its first NCAA bid since 1996.

Martinez had opened the Indians' seven-run inning with a single off Chicago White Sox starter Mark Buehrle. Later in the inning, he drove home Travis Hafuer with a two-out base hit. When reliever Nick Masset's pitch got away from catcher A.J. Pierzynski, the slow-footed Martinez attempted to take second. 
But he stumbled as he neared the bag and fell with an awkward slide. 
Martinez also got hurt in the 2007 season opener against Seattle, straining his left quadriceps while running to first base. 
However, the 29-year-old never went on the disabled list and batted .301 with a career-high 25 homers and 114 RBis for the AL Central champions.

Douglas-Roberts, the third member of the All-America team playing in the Final Four, had 52 first-team votes and 309 points. The 6-7 swingman averaged 17.2 points and 4.1 rebounds and shot 44.9 percent from 3­point range for the Tigers, who lost just one game this season and earned the school's second No. 1 rank­ing. 
"It's an honor. I've put a lot of work in, over the sum­mers, during the season and staying after practice just trying to improve. I feel now that I'm finally getting the

Loi!ar~'s lucl.cy pJitt lands him 
an mvlte to the Masters 
NEW ORLEANs-Peter Lonard figured the closest he would get to the Masters this year was in front of his television. Thanks to a 5-foot par putt on the final hole that he thought was only worth money, he was added to the field Monday by squeezing into the top 50 in the world ranking. 
Lonard was at No. 72 and figured he had to win the Zurich Oassic. 
He was one shot behind Andres Romero and faced a 45-foot birdie putt on the 18th to force a playoff. Lonard ran it 5 feet by the hole, then made that to finish alone in second. Had he missed, Lonard would have tied for second with Tim Wilkinson and moved up only to No. 53. 
The Masters now has 93 players expected to compete, with one more spot available to the winner in Houston if he is not already eligible. Among those still not eligible is Davis Love ill, whose 70 consec­utive majors is the longest streak among active players.

BEIJING-The elaborate ceremo­ny to rekindle the Olympic torch went off without a hitch Monday in closely guarded Tiananmen Square -with hundreds of cheering women in brightly colored T-shirts, flower--toting children and confetti. 
There were no protests in Beijing, although some are expect­ed during the 85,000-mile world tour. 
Demonstrations are expected as the torch goes to London, Paris and San Francisco. Even stops in Kazakhstan on Wednesday and Turkey on Thursday could be flash points for China's Muslim Uighur minority living abroad. 
President Hu Jintao presided at the elaborate ceremony in Beijing's Tiananmen Square, where the flame -carried from Greece in a lantern aboard an Air China flight -reignited the Olympic torch.

Tuesday's match will be the third conference competition this season for both teams. 
"I feel pretty good about playing OlivPt." Belles coach Chuck Rubino said. "They are not pickPd as one of the top tPams in the conference, like who wp'vn been play­ing." 
The Belles have played Albion and Calvin in their first two eonfen~nce matches this season. Albion (10-1. 3-0 MIAA) is currently leading in the MIAA. and Calvin (8-2, 1­0 MlAAl is third. Saint Mary's fell 6-:{ to both Albion and Calvin in the past two weeks. 
"UnfortunatPly. the confer­ence teams we have played so far have been two of the three toughest teams in the MIAA. so they havfl brought some pretty good competi­tion." sophomore co-captain Camille (;ebert said. "Tomorrow's match should be slightly easier than the teams we've been playing so far. llopcfully it will be a good match to bring us out of our slump." 
The Belles are coming off a 0-2 weekend at the Jack Swartz Invitational at Wheaton College. Ill., where they lost to Olivet Nazarene and Wheaton College, both rankPd teams. The Belles lost 6-3 to NAIA No. 16 Olivet Nazarene on Friday, and 8-1 to Wheaton. which is ranked No. 28 in Div. Ill, on Saturday. 
"We had a lot of tough matches this weekend and I think we're going to put that experience into this match," Rubino said. 
Rubino said one main prob­lem in the weekend losses was his team's doubles play. 
"I want to see improvement in our doubles," Rubino said. "Singles did well this past weekend, we want to contin­ue to improve in singles, but I hope to sweep the doubles and if we can -the singles, too."

MLB 
Royals win in extra innings on opening day 
Indians defeat White Sox with help from seven-run second frame; Jim Thome hits two home runs 
Associated Press 
DETROIT-Money can't buy wins. Just ask the Detroit Tigers. 
Tony Pena Jr. hit a two-out, tiebreaking single in the 11th inning and the frugal Kansas City Hoyals held on to beat the big-spending Tigers 5-4 in Monday's opener and give Trey Hillman a win in his major league debut as manager. 
Detroit eloscr Todd Jones said a team's payroll is "totally" irrelevant on any given day. 
"But the beauty of baseball is it's all about the long haul, not one game," Jones said. "Hopefully with the kind of tal­ent we have, we'll find a way to grind out more wins than other people." 
Hillman made the right moves and his players executed in the field to rally from a three-run deficit and hold off a late come­back. 
"This is pretty cool for me," said Hillman, who was success­ful as a manager in Japan. "It's a great honor, it's humbling." 
The Tigers will spend about $138 million on their star-stud­ded team, putting them in the pack with Boston and the New York Mets -behind only the Yankees. 
Kansas City, meanwhile, will try to compete with a payroll of approximately $58 million ­ranking among the smallest. 
"I don't think we'll win most of the time just because our payroll is big," Detroit manager Jim Leyland said. "We just left some guys on base and we left a couple pitches up." 
The Tigers stranded 10 run­ners, including Clete Thomas, who was on third base with only one out in the 11th. 
Joakim Soria got out of the jam and earned the save by striking out Edgar Renteria and getting help from third base­man Alex Gordon, who snared Placido Polanco's grounder in the hole and threw him out. 
"We had one of the best hit­ters in baseball up with a man on third and two outs the last inning," Leyland said. ''I'll take that situation every time." 
Miguel Cabrera hit a homer in his Detroit debut, helping the home team go ahead 3-0 through five innings, but Justin Verlander had a lackluster start to spoil the party. 
"This is just Game 1 of many, you can't get too upset about it," Verlander said. 
Leo Nunez (1-0) threw two hitless innings. "He was probably the unsung star of the game," Leyland said. 
Denny Bautista (0-1) was an out away from pitching two scoreless innings, but Pena's single to center brought John Buck home. 
Trailing 3-0, Gordon hit a two-run home run in the sixth and the Royals scored two more while facing four pitchers in the seventh. 
Leyland raved about the 24­year-old Gordon, who impressed him last year as a rookie. 
"This guy is a big-time player waiting to happen," Leyland said. "He's got a tremendous swing. I think he'll be a star in this league before it's over with. That's why he was a No. 1 play­er." 


Carlos Guillen helped send the game into extra innings with a solo shot in the eighth. 
Cleveland 10, Chicago 8 
CLEVELAND -As the inning unfolded, C.C. Sabathia felt as if he was watching a favorite movie, one with a dialogue he knows by heart and predictable ending. 
"Not to sound cocky," the reigning AL Cy Young Award winner said. "But I think everybody knew what was coming." 
Say this for the Cleveland Indians, they can do drama.

The defending AL Central champions won in familiar fashion at Progressive Field -their ballpark previously known as Jacobs Field -as Casey Blake hit a three-run double in the eighth inning Monday for a 10-8 opening win over the Chicago White Sox. 
Blake's shot off the wall against Octavio Dote! capped a 3-hour, 21-minute opener that featured five homers, controversial calls and unsea­sonably pleasant weather in a city finally thawed out from the snowiest March on record. 
After blowing a 7-2 lead, the Indians loaded the bases in the eighth on two singles and a two-out walk before Blake's clutch hit. 
"It was not that big of a sur­prise," said Sabathia, who made his fifth and potentially final opening day start for the Indians. "Nobody in this club­house was ever in doubt. We always have faith that some­body would come through and it was Casey-once again." 
They may not play in the Jake anymore, but everything else seemed in place for the Indians, who won 23 times in their final at-bat last season. 
With the score 7-7, Kelly Shoppach and Jhonny Peralta opened the eighth with sin­gles off Dote! {0-1), who bounced back and got two quick outs. Franklin Gutierrez, who hit a three­run homer in Cleveland's seven-run second off Mark Buehrle, walked to load the bases. 
Blake fell behind 1-2 in the count before lifting a shot high off the 19-foot-high wall in left, barely missing a grand slam but starting a new chap­ter of memories for Indians fans, who have resisted the 
ballpark's  new  corporate  
moniker.  
"I  was  begging  for  a  

homer," said Blake, who bat­ted just .190 with runners in scoring position last year. 
Chicago's Jim Thome hit a pair of two-run homers off Sabathia, who couldn't pro­tect a 7-2 lead but wound up with a no-decision. The lefty struck out seven in 5 1-3 innings. 
The White Sox threatened in the ninth as Jermaine Dye homered off Joe Borowski, last year's AL saves leader who once again had pulses racing before retiring Joe Crede on a foul pop to get the save for winner Rafael Betancourt.

Although the lack of energy proved detrimental to team 490, the squad put up tough resist­ance as 535 tried to get the last two points in the second half.

Spiny Backed Arabian Tortoises 21, Team Bad Life Decisions 15 
The Spiny Backed Arabian Tortoises earned a well-fought victory over Team Bad Life Decisions. Although the male Tortoises ended up winning, the girls from Decisions played them even the whole game. 
In the hour and 10 minute game, the defense of Decisions made it difficult for the Tortoises. However, their offense couldn't handle the intense defense from the Tortoises, which proved to be the differ­ence in the contest. Both teams threw up multiple airballs and displayed questionable passing, but the game intensified as the Tortoises couldn't make their fmal shot. 
After several failed attempts, Tortoises guard Kyle Hanratty ended the marathon game with a corner shot from three-point range. 
We're the Real Reason Brett Favre Is Crying 23, U Got A Bad Draw 11/2 21 
In an epic struggle that lasted nearly an hour and forty-five minutes, We're the Real Reason Brett Favre Is Crying held off U Got A Bad Draw 1 1/2 in the biggest upset of the tournament so far. 
Bad Draw, which was com­posed of club lacrosse players from IIoly Cross, came out with a fiery display of confidence. 
But this cockiness was short­lived as the all-female team, Brett Favre, stormed out to an 11-5 halftime lead. 
"We simply need more elec­trolytes," Bad Draw team mem­ber Dave Bendel chanted as he ran over to his team's communi­ty Gatorade bottle. 
Similar to the bottle of "Michael's stuff' from the movie "Space Jam," the Gatorade seemed to revitalize Bad Draw as it managed to fight back and tie the game at 17. 
The final minutes of the game were grueling as the two teams traded baskets. 
As team members from other games began to come over to cheer for the ladies of "Brett Favre," the girls capitalized on the crowd momentum and pulled ofT the narrow victory. 
"We absolutely played our hearts out today. We kept it together at the end when we needed to," captain Emily Dore said. "It was truly amazing." 
Bendel was quick to dismiss the loss. "I blame it on the weather ... and the hot girls," he said. 
On this day, the only thing sloppier than the rainy weather was the play of the two teams. Frequent turnovers, errant shots, constant complaints, and even a 15-minute seoreless peri­od all contributed to the ridicu­lous length of this contest. 
Carrolynn's Chub Club 21, Scurrying Lemurs 12 
A bone-chilling, earth-shatter­ing bloek by Patriek Mulligan was all Carolynn's Chub Club, needed to down the Scurrying Lemurs Monday at Lyons courts. 
"I saw her coming down the court. It was just me and her," Mulligan said about the block. "As soon as I smelled weakness, I attacked." 
Mulligan sent the ball flying out of bounds, but the damage had been done. The Scurrying Lemurs' confidence was shot and Carolynn's Chub Club, the dirtiest team name to sneak by the Bookstore censors in years, took over from there. 
After facing an 11-2 deficit heading into halftime, the Scurrying Lemurs thought they had a good second half plan to get them back in the game. 
"We need to get the ball to our secret weapon," captain Holly Hinz said to her team between halves. 
What they failed to account for was Mulligan's game-breaking ability that ultimately sealed their fate. 
"We tried to pull it together and make a comeback," Hinz said. "It just wasn't enough and we came up short." 
LHOOQ 21, Equestrians 3 
The Notre Dame/Saint Mary's Equestrian Club usually just rides horses and travels to com­petitions, but Monday it took to the bookstore courts to take on LHOOQ, a team named after a French painting making fun of the Mona Lisa. 
The Equestrian girls came out in almost full gear, mostly in rid­ing breeches, a few in riding boots, one in riding boot socks covered in flames, and one in a riding helmet. Their opponents were two guys, one in short shorts and sunglasses, the other in shorter shorts and a bandana around his eurly mass of hair, and three girls, all in regular sweatpants and tee-shirts. 
The game started off as a con­test of which team could actually hit the rim first. Airballs were the trend for much of the first half, but the Equestrians squad was the first to draw iron. However, LIIOOQ scored the first point of the game, which was somewhat surprising sinee the team had a majority of the game's air balls up until that point. 
Equestrians was unable to seore many points in the first half, with its only point scored by helmet-clad Katrina Stuart. But it did keep i:ts opponents fighting for the ball as they raced up and down the court. The most aggressive Equestrians players were Heather LaDue, Kelley Daniels, and Andrea Kochert, the team captain. The guys from the LHOOQ team weren't too happy with having to tight for the ball with girls, but they still showed no restraint. 
LHOOQ led 11-1 at the half, and carried its momentum into the second half. The Equestrians scored its second point of the game, made by Stuart again, after LHOOQ had scored three more times. LI-IOOQ continued to score but the team's baskets were few and far between. Daniels scored the third basket for the Equestrians, bringing the score to 18-3. LHOOQ pulled out the win after a 50-minute game of air balls and back and forth play. 
"It was a really physical game, but both teams played hard until the last point," LHOOQ captain Stephanie Brauer said. 
"We played mean and strong, 
-

and it showed with our amazing three points. But we could out­horsebaek ride them any day," Equestrians captain Andrea Kochert said.

the few areas of eoncern for the Irish of late, an area that Gumpf has addressed with her squad. 
"Our defense really does need to improve," Gumpf said. "What I believe the problem to be is that we are not keeping everything simple. Sometimes I feel like we are rushing things and we just need to slow down and watch the ball into the glove." 
The Irish will first face a Ball State team they bested 3-0 at home last year. Gumpf is not tak­ing the contest lightly, as she knows Ball StatP has strong pitch­ing and good hitting eharacteris­tic of the MAC. 
"When we played them last year they had very good hitters," Gumpf said. "And this yPar they havP added an outstanding trans­fer pitcher, junior Tiffany Garofano, so it is going to be very tough." 
Gumpf.said the kPy to bPating thP Cardinals is Notre Dame's pitching. 
"To beat Ball State we are real­ly going to have to loeate our pitches and control their hitters," Gumpfsaid. 
On the offensive side, Gumpf would like to see thP tPam main­tain its strong showings of the past couple weeks and keep foeusing on the fundamentals. 
"Ofl"Pnsively, we rPally nend to keep it simple," Gumpf said. "I want to see us do the littll~ things that are necessary to score runs." 
On Wednesday, the Irish will take the field against Toledo, another offensive-minded MAC team. 
"Toledo is another great hitting team, and we just need to find a way to eontrol thPir hitters," Gumpf said. "I believe Jody [Valdivia! will eontinue to do a great job." 
Gumpf also wants to see the team be patient at the plate against the Bockets. 
"I want us to wait for and swing at good pitehes," Gumpf said. 
Both games will be at 5 p.m. on Ivy Field.

HOROSCOPE EUGENIA LIST 
CELEBRITIES BORN ON THIS DAY: Pavel Bure, 37; Ewan McGregor, 37; Rhea Perlman, 60; Christopher Walken, 65 
Happy Birthday: Check out all the possibilities rather than assuming everything will go according to your plans this year. You are likely to overreact if you aren't prepared. Oversee everything. Detail and precision will be key to your success. Your numbers are 2, 10, 26, 29. 35,40 
ARIES (March 21-April19): Settle down and let everyone else take care of things for a change. You need to break away from the stress and give yourself a chance to reclaim what's really important to you. 2 stars 
TAURUS (April 20-May 20): You have the right idea and will certainly be able to convince others that you know what you are doing. Take care of any matters that require dealing with banks, institutions or government agencies. 5 stars 
GEMINI (May 21-June 20): You can pick up valuable information that will allow you to help someone from whom you need a favor. Make a change at home and you will rid yourself of some of the tension you've been facing. An older individual will reveal some family background. 3 stars 
CANCER (June 21-July 22): Take a dynamic approach to whatever you do and you will excel. Be a little unique, bold and no-nonsense and you will capture the attention of someone who will support what you are doing. 3 stars 
LEO (July 23-Aug. 22): Emotional matters are likely to escalate. A business trip will lead 
to an interesting meeting with someone who can help you see and do things a little differently. An offer regarding your vocation and what you want to pursue is heading in 
your direction. 3 stars 

VIRGO (Aug. 23-Sept. 22): Get your chores out of the way so you are free and clear to enjoy friends, family or someone you love. A love connection can be made if you are single or a commitment made from the heart to someone you are already involved with. Be a participant. 3 stars 
LIBRA (Sept. 23-0ct. 22): So much of what you do will depend on how you treat the 
people close to you. If you have been overreacting, expect to apologize but. if you have 
been helpful and understanding, expect a pleasant surprise. Don't mix business with 
pleasure. 5 stars 

SCORPIO (Oct. 23-Nov. 21): Don't take anything or anyone for granted. You will not get the respect or the help you require even if you ask for it. Do the work yourself and you will have no regrets or apologies to make. Someone is probably withholding information. 2 stars 
SAGITTARIUS (Nov. 22-Dec. 21): Hard work and dedication will pay off and will keep 
you too busy to get into trouble on a personal level. Someone you are involved with will be 
sizing up his or her situation. You may want to distance yourself. 4 stars 
CAPRICORN (Dec. 22-Jan. 19): You will be the driving force behind what gets done. 
Your outgoing nature and your big ideas will take you over the top and on to massive 
projects. An emotional encounter will prove beneficial in the end. 3 stars 
AQUARIUS (Jan. 20-Feh. 18): Hidden matters will lead to trouble. Try to keep everything out in the open so you aren't blamed for something that is not your fault. A partnership can take a turn that will lead to greater security if you are honest. Share how you see things unfolding. 3 stars 
PISCES (Feb. 19-March 20): You can gain ground by the way you handle situations today. You will be able to make professional headway by making a few alterations to your resume. A change at home will allow you to make extra cash doing something that is second nature to you. 4 stars 
Birthday Baby: You are sensitive and caring. You are strong, steadfast and determined. 
You aren't afraid to pitch in and help or to ask for assistance.

Changing priorities 
Weis devotes more time to coaching 'D' 
By CHRIS HINE Sports Writer 
Coach Charlie Weis said he wantnd to get to know his nntirn tl~am a little better ­not just the offense-and this spring, the dnl'ense is finding out exactly what that mnans. 
It nwans thny sec a lot more of thnir coach on the field in practice and ofT the field in the wnight room and in meet­ings. 
Weis said part of his reason­ing bnhind giving play-calling dutins to o!Tnnsiv~ coordinator MichaPI Haywood was to nnhane~ his rdationship with his playnrs and becomn morn involved in their individual dnveloprnent. And the deff1nse has notiend a little more W<~is in tlwir day-to-day operations sincn thn beginning of spring pradien. 
"lin's dnfinitnly a more visi­bln figure, in the ofT-season and practice," rising senior Kyle McCarthy said Monday after pradicn. "Whnn you're on dnfnnse and you'rfl not used to seeing coach Weis behind you, you're kind of tripping a bit, but it's boen good. It's bnnn putting the pressuro on some guys but I think !.t's going to work well for us. 
Wnis said his increasnd visi­bility with the defense at practice has onablcd him to interaet with the playnrs and coach more on that said of the ball. 
"It gives me a chance to

"I stoppHd practice more times IFridayl to give a coaching point and I'll probably give as many of them to the defense as I give to the offense. I'm not talking about scheme of the defense, but there's things that I notice."

Irish prepare for pair of :m_id-week contests 
By JARED JEDICK Sports Writer 
Notrn Damn hopos to enjoy somn sunny skins -and play sornn good softball -when it hosts Mid-Anwrkan Conference opporwnl'i Ball Statn (20-1 h) and Tolndo (6-1 0) Tuesday and Wndnnsday. The Irish will attnmpt to build on thnir monHm­tum from a double-header split against No. 17 DePaul on Sunday. 
Notrn Dame (17-1 0) starting pitdwrs Brittney Bargar, a junior. and frnshman .Jody Valdivia have been outstanding for tho Irish thus far. Their latest strong pPr­f(mnanc.n mmn in a 2-0 Valdivia shutout Sunday. 
".Jody IValdivial really moved tlw ball around well against DePaul," coach Deanna Gumpf said. "With tlw misting and eold conditions, sho was really irnpr<~ssivo." 
Valdivia was named the Big East pitcher of the week on Monday after notching two shutoul'i in 10 and 2/3 innings of work. She limited IUPUI to three hil'i and a walk with seven strike­outs in the home opener Wednosday before handing DePaul its first regular season loss of the season. 
"She did a great job this week with her two shutouts," Gumpf said. "She just gets better every time she goes out onto the mound." 
This is the third time in seven weeks that an Irish pitcher nabbed Big East pitcher of the wnnk honors. Bargar has narned the honor twice this season, and hold DePaul to two runs on lour hits Sunday. 
"Brittney [Bargar! pitched a really great game, as well, in the first half of the double-header," Gumpf said. "But she had trouble gntting enough support from her defense." 
The defense has been one of 
see MAC/page 18 
Weis has left most of the schematic adjustments to defensive coordinator Corwin Brown and assistant head coach/defense Jon Tenuta, who was the defensive coordi­nator at Georgia Tech for the past six seasons. 
"He's going to be the first one to evaluate the talent, put the guys in the right positions of how he sees it and go from there," Tenuta said Monday. 

"He's been around for a long time. There's nothing I've done in my career -having faced him two times and being here -:-that he doesn't understand how we do it or why we do it." 
Brown said having Weis help out more during practice could only improve the team in the long run.

ND bailers begin play in tourney 
By EUGENIA ALFONZO,

Sports Writers 
The 2008 Bookstore Basketball tournament kicked off Monday. Dnspite bad weath­er, the first day featured excited players and at least one big upset. 
Team 535 21, Team 490 10 
Team 535 dominated team 490 and won with intricate pass­ing, great teamwork and key steals and blocks. But the strate­gies of the two squads also proved to be a key in the well­played game. 
"Our strategy to win the game was to just wing it," said senior Derek Lipp of' team 535. "Wn have four seniors and a fresh­man on this toam and it was especially fun for the seniors because this was our first win ever." 
It was a different story for team 490, who dedieated the game to physics professor Christopher Kolda. 
"Our gameplan consisted of going to the Hock two hours before our game and scrim­maged some random team," freshman Ben Linskey said. "Then we went to dinner after­wards, so we had absolutely no energy when it came time to play."

Squad looks for home win 
By MICHAEL BRYAN Sports Writer 

Arter dropping two of three in a tough series against Cincinnati this past weekend, the Irish will look to rebound in a non-eonferenee game against Western Michigan today. 
The Broncos (12-7-1) suf­fen~d a three-game sweep at the hands of Ohio in their first three MAC conference games. 
Sophomore catcher Chris Lewis leads Westnrn Michigan in most ofl'ensive categories. In 19 games this season, Lewis is batting .403 with four home runs and 19 HBI. The Broncos offense is batting over .300 combined this season, scoring almost seven runs per game. 
The Irish will hope for a result similar to last year's game, a 17-9 Notre Dame win at home. Notre Dame pounded the Broncos for 22 hits ­

Thousands of fetal corpses found under South Quad 
NDSP names no suspect, but encourages students to report 'all suspicious townies' 
By IGNOMINY Staff Cynic 
SOUTH QUAD -In a shock­ing turn of events, the white crosses that adorn this quad periodically to commemorate aborted fetuses were shown to mark the graves of thousands of actual fetuses. 
The fetuses were discovered Monday night by an NDSP sting operation, the first of its kind to be launched entirely on a fleet of Segway and Rascal scooters. 
Alerted to the possibility that vandals would desecrate the demonstration -popularly known as Graveyard of the Innocents -the responding officers were shocked to find the executive board of the Notre Dame Right to Life Club were moonlighting as gravedig­gers. 
All students involved were immediately tased. 
"Using our full force of six security -I mean police -offi­cers, we were able to appre­hend the suspects," said NDSP spokesman Jill Phonson. 
Phonson was unable to say the last time a troupe of pro-life activists had buried fetuses on campus. He did not have access to information about the time, exact location, number of sus­pects, where the fetuses came from or where they would be taken.

LAST MINUTE COLUMN 
I declare a Vie-wpoint -war!!! 
I ley fellow Domers! Inside Column here. Sorne of you may know me from my daily musings on life, but others of you may pass right over me on your way to Sports to read about Charlie Weis' rose-seented bowel movements or those other "sports" that we tolerate in between football seasons. 
If you're one of my fans, then I want to say thanks for being there for me through the years as I write about top­ics that only I care about, like spring weather. assorted lists, passing torches or 9/11. But if you do enjoy reading me everyday, then you 'II notice that I don't get quite as mueh attnntion as a eer­tain otlwr snction of this paper. I'm rnady to makn a 1:onf'nssion: I hate Viewpoint and I'd like to take this opportunity to dedare war. Viewpoint war. 
I nwan, why hasn't there bmm an Inside Column vs. Viewpoint war yet? Suw I don't talk about the state of Notw Damn's Catholie identity or the irwfl'edivmwss of student government, but opinion is opinion and at least I don't ramble on about soap operas and "I low I Met Your Mother" or whatever else Se1~1H1 & I Ieard feels the nm~d to talk about as she watdws marathons of "Anwriea's Next Top Model" all day. 
And it's not like Viewpoint is little Miss Perfect either. I was driving to my apartment in Clover Ridge and I totally caught Viewpoint walking baek from Turtle Creek wearing the same Britney-worthy dress and red high heels from the night before. Humor has it, she's been spending a few too many nights at Sports' apartment. For as much as she's against the "Vagina Monologues," her vagina sure has been doing a lot of talking lately. Maybe she's getting some pointers from those Saint Mary's girls she seems to love so much (Ah! Stereotype!). 
Actually, I hear Viewpoint has been around the block with everyone except for Scene. Scene's too busy watching "The Wire" and talking about how excited he is for the new "Indiana Jones" movie. 
All I know is that if Viewpoint wants to keep her credibility. she better stop flirting with Comics so inuch. I mean, seriously? All he does is sit on his futon playing "Halo," thinking of lame jokes about squirrels or ugly girls (because guys here really have room to talk). 
So bring it Viewpoint. I hear Crossword and Horoscope talking behind your back everyday. And it turns out that Question of the Day and Oflbeat were talking smack too before I scared them ofl' in the bathroom so I could smoke cigarettes rolled with old copies of the Irish Hover and Scholastic. So let's start a war and try to give Notre Dame students a break from all this talk about vaginas. Hetaliation is up to you. 
The views expressed in the Inside Column are divine revelation so don't get so uiorked up about it.

Heath Ledger jokes finally deemed fumy 
GOING TO HELL, Kan. ­Although the premature passing of the Oscar-nomi­nated actor Heath Ledger in January was a tragic end to a young life, celebri­ty expert Classy B. has decided that jokes about the deceased heartthrob are now funny. 
"Enough time has passed," says Classy. "His death has become open game, just like AIDS, 9/11 and poverty in Africa." 
Classy believes that her favorite Ledger jokes are sensitive and thought-pro­voking. 

"E! is reporting that pro­duction has begun on 'The Patriot 2.' Heath Ledger will once again play the role of the dead son," Classy jokes. 
But her favorite joke goes, "What do Jake Gylennhal's cherry and a bottle of Paxil have in com­mon? They both got popped by Heath Ledger." 
SMC students shave heads for Britney, not cancer 
FIRECROTCH. Calif. ­Reports on Monday that Saint Mary's students had shaved their heads in sup­port of cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy proved to be false. Instead. the students reportedly shaved their heads in soli­darity with Britney Spears, who has made great strides in recent months toward a comeback. 
"We, like, Jove Britney! She's super cute and not fat, and her new CD is, like. Shakespeare," said sophomore Kimberly Johnson. "Why would we shave our heads for can­cer? Cancer patients aren't famous." 
Information compiled by someone who just wants to be famous. Really, that's all she asks out oflife.

Obama taps ND coach to lead Dept. of Defense 
Illinois senator's approval rating among Big East basketball fans falls sharply; choice provides 'balance,' analysts say 
Agence Ken Presse 
Sen. Barack Obama has named Notre Dame basketball coach Mock Tee his expected nominee to become Secretary of Defense if the Illinois Democrat wins November's presidential election. 
Obama cited Tee's visit to Kuwait last summer as "undeni­able evidence" that Tee was "far more qualified than myself' to lead the nation's military.

The Absurder endorses student governinent. All of it. 
Student government has done it again. Despite the student body's typically demanding expectations, no one was surprised when, mirroring last year's success, all student body concerns were addressed in the productive, issue-oriented approach that Absurd Staff has come to characterize 
Editorial

everything about student government at Notre Dame. 
"We had a great year," said outgoing student body president Fiz Beige at the impromptu, stu­dent-organized recognition ceremony held last Friday. "For one, student government single handedly stopped the Common Council ordi­nance," she continued, referring to the proposed legislation cited as unconstitutional by lawyers and unenforceable by SBPD. 
Katie McDomer, who helped to organize the surprise ceremony, summed up the general atti­tude of the more than 2,500 present, an attitude echoed here at The Absurder. 
"I just couldn't sit down and let their tireless, unflagging commitment to student issues go uncelebrated," McDomer said. "I haven't even been paying attention to key student issues like resume-padding and meaningless political machinations," she continued, referring to stu­dent government's well-known policies designed to harness the prestige associated with illusory power. 
Beige and student body vice president Paris Lawn had been forced to leave their class after

Browns, the New York Knicks and Bookstore Team No. 451. 
"We feel this diverse group of teams makes us one of the most, if not the most, compet­itive conference in the coun­try," Trogese said. "We want­ed to make sure we got to 24 teams because I think there's some way you can do a tour­nament with that many." 
Trogese said that while most of the new teams will not play football in the Big East, the Cleveland Browns will make "good competition for Louisville, West Virginia and Rutgers" in that sport. 
The Cleveland Browns will also compete in basketball, something that excites back­up quarterback Quinn Brady. 
"I was on a pretty good intramural team in college," Brady said. "Maybe I'll be able to start for Browns bas­ketball." 
Trogese said he's looking forward to the cross-town battles between Saint John's and the New York Knicks at Madison Square Garden. 
"Although we do not expect either of those teams to be competitive with the league at large, it will be nice to have a major event in New York," Trogese said. 
Trogese also said he is excited to have Memphis, Xavier and Davidson in the fold because "they're really good." 
"Memphis is in the final four." he said. "PIus X a vier and Davidson beat West Virginia and Georgetown. My policy is, if you can't beat them, have them join you." 
Notre Dame coach Mock Tee said he can't wait to play a mob assembled outside DeBartolo and began chanting their names. After stepping outside, students rushed to place them atop separate thrones, which were subsequently carried to South Quad for the ceremony. 
This is exactly the sort of leadership advocat­ed by The Absurder. The illustrious reign of Beige and Lawn, though over in principle, will never be over in spirit. Of course, it must also be noted that their accomplishments were bol­stered greatly by the loyal service of senator Tim Dockwood, whose puppet rule master plan was a shining example of student government in its purest form -empty debate over internal procedures wholly unadulterated by confused attempts at action. 
The future, too, looks bright. 
Campaign posters for all successful tickets were a fitting tribute to the best student govern­ment values: Smiling, eye contact, bullet points, and postures that are both powerful and friend­ly. 
Going above and beyond simple posters, the winners of the presidency/vice presidency ­Rice and Smith-combined all the key ingredi­ents of a good poster with the more wide-reach­ing platform of a Web site. Lofty, immeasurable goals like "bridging the gap" and "forging rela­tionships" are the key to building on the monu­mental accomplishments of the last regime. 
The Absurder knows that student government will continue its impressive and formidable legacy. Keep up the good work.

Satan 
continued from page 666 
Devil said in an interview in the basement of South Dining Hall. Wreathed in shadows, he appeared only as a pair of glow­ing red eyes set amidst a swirling coil of darkness some­what similar to the smoke mon­ster seen on ABC's popular tele­vision series "Lost." "Eve Ensler is my homegirl. Deal or no deal. Let's go, I have other things I could be doing, such as luring souls to the precipice of eternal damnation." 
The Devil himself admitted that he "drove a hard bargain," but said that Spankins didn't have much choice in the matter. 
"Did you seriously think last season was what, a fluke?" the Prince of Darkness continued. "A few bad bounces against the Irish? A few breaks going the wrong way? Come on, people. That was all me." 
Satan also reiterated his rela­tive position of power in the negotiations, intoning, "What? Do you think I won't do it again this season? 'Cause I will. You all laughed because I helped Appalachian State topple your rival in Michigan last year. " While he wouldn't hint at the precise nature of his dastardly plans, the Devil did say, "You all have San Diego State first on the schedule this year. At home, nonetheless. Can you say, 'sequel?"' 
"Obviously, there are pros and cons whenever you're consider­ing a deal, especially with an entity such as Hades himself," Spankins said of his current musings. "When you push back from the bargaining table and shake on [the deal]. you kinda want to make sure you still have all your fmgers attached after­wards." 
"What people don't realize is, heavy is the head that wears the crown," Spankins said, sighing and slumping in his chair. "Or the papal hat, which represents our strong Catholic morals here, or the mortarboard, which rep­resents academic freedom. You see, I have a lot of hats I have to wear here as the president of the University, and one of them happens to be, well, a baseball

with other leading institutions of higher education," Spankins said. "The bottom line is we can't charge more for a diploma with­out making it more attractive to the market. Our customers expect demonstrable increases in quality to account for superinflationary pricing." 
Spankins said specific increases would vary by department. l-Ie expressed his concern that a 4.8 percent grade raise would not be possible for all departments, as increasing an average GPA higher than 3.8165 by 4.8 percent would put it over the currently allowed maximum of 4.0. 
"We expect the greatest benefi­ciaries of the 4.8 percent average increase to be the College of Engineering and the College of Science," Spankins continued, cit­ing the possibility of increases as high as 25 percemt without hit­ting 4.0. Other departments expressed displeasure with this dissimilarity. 
Business school dean Caroling Foo called the 4.0 maximum "absurd" and "anachronistic." The limitation of any increase to a 
4.0 maximum is speculated to cause the lowest grade increase hat, but it reads NOTRE DAME FOOTBALL on it. Plus, and not to sound hopeless here, but we all hoped and prayed and went to the Grotto last year, and all it netted us was three wins and a trip to the toilet bowl." 
"I mean, let's cut to the chase here: either we get better at football soon, or I'm out of this chair anyways, 'Vagina Monologues~ or no." 
"Besides," he said, "winning cures all evils, does it not? So if you follow my line of thinking, we'll start racking up the Ws next season and maybe the whole 'deal with the devil' thing will just sort itself out." 
While he wouldn't set a hard deadline regarding the Devil's offer, Spankins did say that tim­ing had a large part in deter­mining when he would announce his decision. 
"Obviously, you can't go public with a deal like this on say, Good Friday. That wouldn't be kosher," Spankins said. "After the rebirth of newly risen Lord, the Devil tends to be a little weaker, a little less confident. Who knows, maybe he'll sweet­en the deal and toss in a guar­anteed berth for our men's bas­ketball team in the Elite Eight next season? For now, it's best to sit and wait. We still have time before the season starts." 
"Absolutely not," the Devil raged after hearing of Spankins' plans to sit on his hands. "Who does this guy think he is? First off, I put Mike Brey in that posi­tion for a reason. The best defense against having a good offense, or a good defense, is hiring Brey. If he hadn't approached me and cut a deal first, he'd have fulfilled his des­tiny of selling used cars in Nebraska for all of eternity." 
While the delay continues, the Devil said he has big plans for Notre Dame's spring training. "Expect to see a lot of ankle sprains," he said, "and more mysterious bone spurs in Jimmy Clausen's throwing shoulder. Tell Spankins to call me when he's ready to deal" he said before disappearing into the ground with an accompanying thu~derclap. "He has my num­ber.

across all departments for either the College of Business or the College ofArts and Letters. 
"We need to take the lead on this issue, and bring collegiate grading policy into the 21st centu­ry," Foo said. "If only all the mar­keting majors were as stupid as the engineers, then everyone could get a 4.8 percent increase. It doesn't make sense to punish our college for the unmatched work ethic of its students, as evi­denced by their high GPAs." Foo added that a marketing class was in the midst of developing a con­vincing Powerpoint presentation that she felt would sway Spankins' thinking. 
Addressing concerns aboqt the impact higher grades would have on distinguishing between the best and worst students, Spankins explained that greater weight would be given to previously less significant decimal places. 
Spankins emphasized funda­mental economics as the basis for the Board of Trustees' decision to up grade inflation. "You have a $129,648 degree with a 3.4 GPA in 2008, and then in 2009 you expect a $136,476 degree with a

SAINT MARY'S, Ind. -In the midst of one of Saint Mary's best­ever seasons, the campus has caught basketball fever.

The second game ol'ficially will be a n e u tra I s i t e g a m e a t Mishawaka's Penn High School, as part of the two neutral site games in Black's new 8-3-1 schedul­ing model, but all gate receipts and TV revenues will go to Notre Dame.

HOCKEY 

Late-running season scares tean1 
Players not used to having games in April, run in fear 
By ADAM BANKS 
District 5 

A frightened and confused Notre Dame hockey team refused to step onto the ice for practice today after seeing that the calendar had changed to April. 
The Irish, who are headed to play in the Frozen Four in less than two weeks, became dis­orientated when they entered the locker room and realized they had to play hockey after March. Several players broke down in tears, while others fled to protect themselves from the month. 
"This just isn't right," said Irish captain Clark Van Builder, who had wrapped himself in tin foil to camou­flage himself from April. "We've never had to do this before, ~tnd we're all scared. I heard thai. if you play hockey in April, yout face grows a beard. Can you imagine that?" 
Notre Dame head coach Jack Jefferson, furious upon learn­ing that his team was still playing hockey in the crucial offseason training period, called the Irish "the biggest bunch of lazy, cake-eating pan­sies he had ever seen." Jefferson vowed the Irish will pay dearly for all the 6 a.m. workouts they will miss while playing in the Frozen Four. 
"They thought 6 a.m. was bad? Wait till they see what I have planned," Jefferson said in between clean and jerks of a dazed and badly beaten CCHA referee. "I bought a slave gal­ley out on Lake Michigan. They're going to row until they learn teams win games with offseason work." 
The Joyce Center rink was a chaotic scene the rest of the afternoon. 
Seniors Steve Stankin and Rock Greehan attempted to blend into the fencing practice above the arena but were kicked out when they speared the team's best fencers with their hockey sticks. 
"They were Eastern European," Stankin protested. "That's the only way you can slow them down." 
Stankin, screaming that April was coming for him, had to be removed at saber-point. Greehan hacked his way out of the fencing gym and immedi­ately put himself in the penalty box. 
Junior right wing Connor Eriksson patrolled the outside of the Joyce Center in a motor­ized scooter, wearing only a jock strap and carrying a stick. The Notre Dame Security Police were called when Eriksson began to challenge passersby to joust. 
NDSP followed Eriksson in a slow-speed chase to the library, where the deranged forward jumped out of his scooter and fell flat on his face. 
"The same thing happens to him when he tries to skate, down he goes," Van Builder said. "It's sad, really. We all feel bad for him. Most days he has to skate with a traffic cone or else he falls down." 
The body of freshman goalie Sherm Lips lay at center ice, the naive victim of a dozen Notre Dame players who believed a sacrifice to the hockey gods could protect them from April hockey. Led by junior center Islam Branson, the players built a fortress of pucks along the goal line and lured Lips into their trap with promises of more playing time and tips on how to survive puberty. 
"Playing this late in any sea­son goes against everything Notre Dame athletics stand for," athletic director Melvin Black said. "I applaud the efforts of Branson and compa­ny to try to keep national championships away. That Lips kid had it coming any­way." 
There were a few Irish play­ers, however, who weren't ready to give up. 
Senior defensemen Stan CaNard and Ryan Farsi offi­cially transferred today to the Irish women's club hockey team, where they will compete for the fifth and sixth spots on the women's blue line. 
"Hey, at least they'll let me play there," CaNard said. "And I'm pretty sure no one can hurt me for once."

Michael also said that God considered using a giant fin­ger to smite Wise, but that he decided on the lightning bolt "because it's way cool­er." 
The Notre Dame theology department was quickly convened to discuss the implications of the smiting. 
"We felt that God acted unfairly, because Wise was clearly talking about a rebuilding season and not 

the rebuilding of an actual building," associate profes­sor Abicus O'Hoolihan said. 
O'Hoolihan was later found in his office trans­formed into a pillar of salt. God was not available for further comment. 
Former Notre Dame defen­sive coordinator Corduroy Braun was promoted to interim head coach. Linebacker Marty Krun said the team, while sad at the loss of coach Wise, expects 
to continue spring practice as planned. 
"We're just going to keep working hard," Krun said. "We're just trying to get better." 
Linebackers coach Tom Thanuta was promoted to defensive coordinator in place of Braun. 
"Thanuta no scared," he said. "Thatuta blitz!"

By nightfall, the tensions that had run through the crowd all day changed to fear as the members realized what the ramifications of their rally would be. 
'Tm not sure how we can go back to the old ways," poster Senior You Never See Who Lives in the Single said. "Before, we posted anonymously from our computers and no one knew who we were.

The planned roast of football coach Charlie Weis over a fire pit had to be cancelled as dispirited and frightened posters headed back to their cubicles.

God strikes Wise dead 
Coach says 'rebuilding,' is smote by Supreme Being as requested 
By HORSEMAN NO.3 OfThe Apocalypse 
In August, Notre Dame coach Chuck Wise told reporters that "God strike me dead" if he used the word "rebuilding." 
Monday, God delivered on that rnqunst. 
During a post-practice news conference, Wise updated the media on his plans for a new headquar­ters for Banana and Friends, his charity for developmentally disabled children.

Just three years after expanding to 16 teams, the Big East is getting bigger again. 
The league is raiding several different other conferences and will add eight new members next school year. 
"We didn't think 16 was enough schools," confer­ence commissioner Mikail Trogese said. "We need a few more to have a com­petitive conference." 
The new teams will be Memphis, Xavier, Davidson, Harvard, North Florida, the Cleveland

this really leL<; us get together and channel all our hate at once. It's way better than the time I wrote a haiku about Zbikowski's pac;s cov­erage. He sucks." 
The revelers pounded Appletinis and Fuzzy Navels well into the afternoon until rally leaders cut back alcohol consumption when it was discovered that preparations li1r an Elephant Walk had almost bnnn completed. 
But then the day's festivities kicked into high gear. 
The posters danced naked around a burning effigy of Kevin White, tl1eir bodies eovnred in blue and gold paint and their faces smnared with the blood of South Bend Tribune columnist Jeff Carroll. Several dancers became confused at the remarkable like­ness of the efligy and received tl1ird-degree burns in an attempt to "teach him how to make a sched­ule." 
As the sun set, the posters formed a circle and dropped to their knees around a life-size statue of oflen._c;ive lineman Sam Young made from a mixture of Spam and their own tears.
