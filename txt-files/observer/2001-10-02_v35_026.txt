BOG creates plan to reduce mass e-mails 

By SHANNON NELLIGAN 
News Writer 
Board of Governance brain­stormed and proposed meth­ods to end abuse of the e-mail system Monday night without restricting students' First Amendment rights. 
Continued abuse of the Saint Mary's e-mail system dominat­ed the BOG meeting Monday. Elizabeth Cusick, technology commissioner, submitted a recommendation to restructure the network. 
The plan is constructed in a way that will promote the reduction of unwanted e-mails. Students will only receive class e-mails from the College presi­dent, vice president of Student Affairs, information technolo­gy, class boards and the Board. 
Cusick clarified that, "if someone believes the whole student body needs to know about an upcoming event [by mass e-mail] ... major boards should have the right to review and send out the e-mail." 
"This will also increase com­munication within student gov­ernment which will increase co-sponsorship," said student body vice president Kristen Matha. 
The Board also addressed the need for students to obtain information from various clubs and academic associations. The idea of creating list serves was presented: These would permit students to subscribe for information from the pro­grams they are interested in and filter the circulation of unwanted e-mails. 
"This plan of action will be a more organized outlet for the information to be sent," Cusick said. 
Michelle Nagle, student body president, ensured this is not restricting freedom of speech. Every student will have a way to get every single e-mail sent. 
The first list serves will be sponsored by the athletics department and art depart­ment and will include current events affecting the college and educational resources. 
The issue of mass e-mails sent by students was also con­sidered. The focus was on the student body's rights regarding

four specific instances in  

which she has persevered for 20 miles. In a row. 
I am truly amazed at the dedication it takes to prepare for an event as grueling as a marathon, and even more impressed that so many Oomers have been juggling running, academics and extra curricular activities in an effort to prime their bodies for Chicago's 26.2 mile course. At least 42 students from Noire Dame will head west this weekend, and many ofthem will be wearing Notre Dame track singlets procured from the Issue Office in an effort to show Irish spirit dur­ing the race. Kudos to you, Jenn, for coming up with and following through on such a great idea. 
Chicago boasts that its marathon is the fastest in the world: Khalid Khannouchi set a World Record time of 2:05:42 in 1999. I thought I might have a chance at beating that until I real­ized it was two hours, not two days. But this Sunday, 37,500 people are going to begin run­ning at 7:30 a.m.; some in an effort to beat this record, some to meet their own personal goals, and others just to cross the finish line before the race coordinators begin to disassemble it. 
Cheering the runners on will be 900,000 spec­tators, many of whom come to enjoy the various events stationed around the course. Bands, sponsoring organizations, and a multitude of groups offer fun, entertainment or distraction for crowds during a race that for some runners ¼ill last almost six hours. 
Many participants wondered if the marathon would remain scheduled for Oct. 7 in light of our recent national tragedy, but event chairman Mark Nystuen said, "The triumph of our nation over this adversity will be, I believe, beautifully reflected in the spirit and resolve of our many runners on Race Day." In addition to fostering national spirit, LaSalle Bank is working to help The American Red Cross National Disaster Relief Fund by accepting donations throughout Race Day and at the pre-race Health Expo on Saturday. 
So, what's my purpose in writing an entire col­umn about a very, very, insanely long race? It's an attempt to convince as many people as possi­ble to take a trip to Chicago this weekend to cheer on classmates, friends and strangers in their pursuit of dreams, goals and records. I know without a doubt that I could not run 26.2 miles, but if I were going to try, it would make a world of difference to know that people had trav­eled to support me. It is quite a different caliber than the high school cross country meets in which you cheer on the runners at the beginning of the race, watch them disappear, wait for the next three miles, and then cheer them on when they reappear to finish the course.

HARVARD UNIVERSITY 

Student assulted in hate crime act 
CAMBRIDGE, Mass. 
A Muslim Harvard University graduate student was verbally and physically harassed at the Harvard Square T-stop Friday afternoon in what police are calling a hate crime. The incident is the first felony-level hate crime at Harvard in the wake of the Sept.-11 attacks and comes on the heels of the recent stabbing of a Saudi Arabian man who was reported to be a student at Boston University. On her way to weekly congregational prayers, the Harvard graduate student left the Harvard Square MBTA station and was entering the "Pit" area when four white males approached her, according to the 
· police log. She was wearing a hijab. a traditional Muslim headscarf. The males reportedly said, "What are you doing here? Go home to your own country," and tried to take off her hijab. "She was shocked and scared," said Melinda Mott, a friend of the victim. Mott said her friend continued on to Friday prayer and that the pair then contacted the Harvard University Police Department (HUPD). 


SOUTHERN ILLINOIS UNIVERSITY 
Police to exhume serial killer's body 
CARBONDALE, Ill. 

Carbondale Police Department will file a petition this week to exhume the body of infamous serial killer John Paul Phillips with the hopes of connecting him to sever­al unsolved murders dating back more than 25 years. Jackson County State's Attorney Mike Wepsiec said the petition could be filed as early as Monday in Williamson County -the final resting place of the man police believe raped and murdered five women, includ­ing 3 Southern Illinois University students between 1974 and 1981. The petition will contain evidence establishing probable cause that Phillips was linked to murders other than the one he was convicted of com­mitting. Carbondale Police Sgt. Paul Echols said med­ical examiners will extract Phillips' leg bone, obtain his DNA profile and send the sample to the state crime lab in Springfield for a comparison with DNA evidence gathered from the 1981 murder of Susan Schumake. Police have obtained a DNA profile of Schumake's killer.

CLC defines task force goals 
ByJASON Mc:FARLEY 
News Editor 
An efficient Campus Life Council defined objectives for its task forces at a 20-minutc meet­ing Monday. 
Members set goals for each of the council's three task forces. At its Sept. 17 meeting. the CLC voted to create task forces on off-campus living, alcohol use and abuse and campus social space. 
The off-campus living task force will explore concnns about transportation, security and communication that off­campus students typically face, task force chairman Tim Jarotkicwicz said Monday. 
"We'd basically like to come up with ways to improve the lives of off-campus students," he said. "We'd also want to deter­mine why students move off campus." 
Student government officials and the Office of Residence Life are already compiling data about what leads students to move off campus, and the task force will take advantage of some of that information, Jarotkiewicz said. 
The report that student gov­ernment representatives will give to the University's Board of Trustees deals with the trend of increased numbers of students choosing off-campus housing. 
The CLC's alcohol task force will try to identify stricter ways for administrators to crack down on underage drinking, Blake Haan, the task force's chairman, said Monday. 
One possibility is to have alco­hol-related incidents reflected on student transcripts, Haan said. 
"We are also exploring how we can change the culture of how people think about alcohol so· that the culture is not all about getting drunk," said Becca Davidson, task force member and Breen-Phillips rectress. 
The social space task force abandoned plans to research available social space in resi­dence halls and opted to look at

non-dorm social space, accord­ing to chair Bob LeBlanc. 
The task force will study the feasibility of holding more events for underage students at the Alumni-Senior Club, making bet­ter use of current space in cam­pus buildings and establishing a 24-hour restaurant on North Quad, LeBlanc said. 
Father Paul Doyle, Dillon Hall rector, recommended an alter­native means for extra social space. 
"Maybe we can look into hav­ing more dances aQ.d other events in big tents outside," said Doyle, who told the council that Dillon's dance under a tent was successful Friday. "I think tents are a good venue

Agreement falls short 
of Ashcroft's plan 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON 
Senior members of the House Judiciary Committee reached bipartisan agreement Monday on anti-terrorism lcg­i.slation that strengthens the hand of investigators but falls short of recommendations made by Attorney General John Ashcroft in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks. 
The compromise would make it easier for investiga­tors to gain court permission for electronic surveillance of suspected terrorists under the Federal Intelligence Security Act. Another provision would extend the amount of time the government may detain an alien suspected of terrorism without filing charges, from the current two days to seven. 
But the standard that would be set for these electronic sur­veillances would still be more stringent than the Justice Department sought. And Ashcroft had proposed there be no limitation on the length of detention in cases involving aliens suspected of terrorism. 
In another setback for the administration, many of the key provisions of the bill would expire in little more than two years, on Dec. 31, 2003. Officials who described the proposed legislation did so on condition of anonymity. 
They said the plan had the backing of Rep. James Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., and John Conyers, D-Mich., the chairman and senior Democratic member of the Judiciary Committee. The committee is expected to debate the measure as early as Wednesdav. 

Ashcroft p;oposed new ter­rorism laws in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks at the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, and prodded Congress over the weekend to act speedily. But some of his initial proposals sparked opposition from liberals and conservatives alike who said they would infringe on civil liberties. · 
The Justice Department responded warily to the pro­posals. "We are in the process of reviewing the legislation that Chairman Sensenbrenner has agreed to and will assess how it compares to the admin­istration's proposal," said Susan Dryden, a spokes­woman for Ac;hcroft. 
The legislation would make it easier for law enforcement authorities to obtain so-called "pen register" and "trap and tracc"ordors that permit them to learn the incoming or out­going phone numbers from a particular telephone. Rather than seek permission for such orders in multiple jurisdictions around the country, officials would be required to obtain permission only once. The current law, according to a summary of the legislation, "can cause serious delays that could be devastating to an investigation where additional criminal or terrorist acts are planned." 
The law also extends the amount of time for which a court order may be used to conduct physical searches and electronic surveillance under the FISA.

Logan airport ousts its head of security

BOSTON 
The head of security at the city's Logan Airport is being ousted, three weeks after terror­ists crashed two planes hijacked from the airport into the World Trade Center, an ofiicial in the governor's office said Monday. 
Joseph Lawless had handled security for then-Gov. William Weld when he was appointed in 1993 as the head of public safety at the Massachusetts Port Authority. which runs Logan, the Port of Boston and several regional airports. 
"He will be removed very soon," said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymi­ty.

A call left for Lawless' spokesman after business hours Monday was not immediately returned. Lawless has an unHst­ed home phone number and could not be located for com­ment. 
It was unclear whether Lawless would be reassigned to another position after his removal from the $130,000-a­year security post. 
Swift on Monday called securi­ty lapses at the airport "unac­ceptable." About 150 National Guard members will be assigned to Logan and the state's other airports starting Friday.

Cusick also suggested that, "Until the possible setup of a 'Blackboard Program' [hoped to be setup by January]. there will be bulletin boards set up in Haggar for items that are per­sonal in nature." \

CHINA 


Associated Press 
BEIJING 
China celebrated National Day on Monday, the anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic, with pledges by the country's leaders to join the international com­munity's fight against ter­rorism. 
China's flag of gold stars on a red field was raised at dawn ceremonies across the country, from Tibet's capital Lhasa in the tower­ing Himalayas to the com­mercial powerhouse of Hong Kong. Hundreds of open-air dance and song shows were staged to mark the day, and public parks in the capital put on street fairs. 
Chinese President Jiang Zemin led top leaders in an appearance late Sunday night atop Tiananmen gate in Beijing, the ancient entrance to the former home of Chinese emperors where M.ao Tse-tung declared the founding of the People's Republic on Oct. 1, 1949 after winning a civil war. 
Monday was also the beginning of the weeklong holiday dubbed "Golden Week," a key time for Chinese to travel and shop. This year, the holiday also coincided with the Mid-Autumn Festival, a tradi­tional time for gathering with friends and family to eat pastries and view the full moon. The date of the festival is calculated according to the lunar cal­endar and changes yearly. 

With the terror attacks against the United States still fresh, Chinese leaders also used the occasion to reiterate-promises to join international efforts to fight global terror. 
Calling terrorism a "seri­ous global scourge," Premier Zhu Rongji said at a reception Sunday that the government will make "staunch and unremitting efforts" together with other countries to ensure peace. 
State television reported President Jiang Zemin made a similar pledge in a phone conversation with Gen. Pervez Musharraf. the president of traditional ally Pakistan. But Jiang stressed any action against those behind the terror attacks must be based on sufficient evidence, have a specific target and adhere to principles outlined by the United Nations. 
Since the attacks, Beijing has repeatedly stressed it wants any military action in Afghanistan to first be approved by as many countries as possible.

Combating off-campus crime 
When Tiffney Colon found the smashed passenger side window of her car (which was parked in her house's driveway) two weeks ago, she instinctively knew what to do. 
"I called the police right way and they were really helpful," Colon said. "But I know this probably wouldn't have hap pened ifI still lived on campus." 
The police officer told Colon that break-ins are common place for many off-campus stu­dents, a fact Kramer himself cannot dispute. 
"We've had some break-ins, but nobody has ever been harmed," Kramer said. "They usually occur over the summer when the houses aren't 100 per­cent occupied." 
Kramer estimates that nine out of 10 break-ins are a result of the students not being aware of what they need to do to pro­tect themselves. As a result, he hosts an annual neighborhood safety and crime prevention meeting for both students and South Bend residents. This year's meeting is scheduled for today at 5:30 p.m. on the 800 block of East Washington Street. 
In addition to having a respon­sive police department, Kramer said he takes several precautions to prevent crime, including installing alarm systems and motion lighting around a house's perimeter and locks on all the doors and windows. 
"Students may not be familiar with some of the things they can do to prevent Grime," such as keeping blinds closed and watching what is put in the trash, Kramer said. "Student safety is our No. 1 priority." 
Getting up to par 
Kramer said renting to stu­dents is not always smooth sail­ing. His houses are often older, requiring extensive maintenance and repair. 
Sally Bannon, Kramer's execu­tive assistant, handles daily phone calls from renters dealing with a wide array of problems. Whether it is a leaky faucet or a mouse in the house, Bannon is responsible for dispatching Domus Property's maintenance staff. 
'Tm here to take care of stu­dents. [t's my job," she said. 
Kramer also owns Termiguard, a local extermina­tion company. He treats houses monthly for any pests that may wander in. 
"We don't have many com­plaints about bugs or mice," Bannon said. "Our biggest com­plaint is plumbing issues, but we can take care of that right away." 
The end of the year can be a difficult time for Kramer. Although Kramer meets with his renters six weeks before move­out to discuss his expectations for the condition of the house, only 50 percent of the students get their full security deposit back, 30 percent get partial refunds and 20 percent owe him money for damages and exten­sive repairs. 


He said that at least four hous­es a year are beyond handy-man repair. with damages such as holes in the walls, kicked in stoves, smashed toilets, ruined hardwood floors and broken windows. 
"We don't want the deposits because by taking the deposits our workload is horrendous," Kramer said.

Anti-Taliban alliance calls for leadership 
Associated Press 
ROME 
The anti-Taliban alliance in northern Afghanistan and the former Afghan king agreed Monday to conven.e an emergency council of tribal and mili­tary leaders as a first step toward forming a new sys­tem of government in their country. The Taliban's leader predicted the effort would fail. 
The council, or loya jirga, they envision would consist of 120 people cho­sen from the opposition northern alliance as well as different provinces and ethnic groups, said Abdul Sattar Sirat, a senior adviser to former King Mohammad Zahir Shah.

between Zahir Shah and a half-dozen northern alliance representatives, was seen as a possible opening for an alternative Afghan government if the ruling Taliban militia is toppled as a result of U.S. strikes to retaliate for the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. 
Opponents of the Taliban have called for convening such a council, considered by Afghans to be one of the few broadly accepted means of finding a representative govern­ment. 
Monday's announcement left the door open for the Taliban to take part in the council. which would be held in Afghanistan soon. 
But the Taliban's leader 

wasted  no  time  in  
denouncing the move.  
In  a  broadcast  on  

Taliban-run Kabul radio and monitored in the 
Pakistani capital. Mullah Mohammed Omar said the efforts to bring the ex-king into an alliance with oppo-· sition forces was destined to fail. 
"They want to impose the Zahir Shah regime on us," Omar said, referring to the Americans. 
"God willing, I'm sure America cannot do that." 
A representative of the northern alliance in Tajikistan, which borders Afghanistan. praised the agreement. 
"The temporary differ­ences between the north­ern alliance and Mohammad Zahir Shah ... have been settled," said Muhamad Salekh Registani. the military attache of the opposition alliance's embassy in the Tajik capital. Dushanbe. 
The Joya jirga had been a centuries-old institution in Afghanistan. However, tra­ditionally only the king could call such a council meeting. The former king was overthrown in 1973 by a cousin with the help of the communists. 
Many influential Afghans who are not associated with the northern alliance would like to see a council convened. The ex-king's role would be limited to convening the council. 
However, joining with the northern alliance could tarnish his image as a uni­fying figure above politics. Many figures in the alliance were discredited in Afghanistan because of the chaos that swept the country when they ruled following the collapse of the leftist government in 1992. 
Councils convened dur­ing Marxist rule were not widely accepted as valid by Afghans, and the Taliban have rejected any Joya jirga called by anyone, including the king. who lives in a luxurious gated community north of Rome.

Bush's decision devalues life 
Should taxpayers pay for research on embryonic stem cells? The answer offered, wit[! evident sincerity, by President Bush is neither moral nor capable of practical limitation. 
In its earliest days, the embryo is a living human composed of stem cells, each of \1vhich can develop into all or many of the more than 200 tis­sues in the human body. If stem cells are removed to a dish thev can replenish them­selves in "lines," perhaps indefi­nitely. Stem cells can also be obtained from adults, in bone marrow and other sources. Scientists hope that research on stem cells, whether from embryos or adults, can lead to relief for some dis­eases, including Parkinson's, Alzheimer's and others. 
No moral problems arise in the use of stem cells derived from adults. But to obtain stem cells from a human embryo requires the removal of the inner cell mass which terminates the life of that embryo. 
President Bush said: "We do not end some lives for the medical benefit of oth­ers ....[T]hat life, including early life, is biologically human, genetically distinct and valuable. [We can] promote stem cell research without ... ethical abuses. First, we can encourage research on stem cells removed from sources other than embryos .... Second, we can encourage  research on embryonic stem cell lines that already exist .... Therefore ... [f1ederal funding for research on existing stem cell lines will move forward; federal funding that sanctions or encourages the destruction of additional embryos will not. VVhile it is unethical to end life in medical rosea.rch, it is ethical to benefit from research where life and death deci­sions have already been made." 

Bush approved funding on cell lines "derived (l) with the informed consent of donors, (2) from excess embryos created solely for reproductive purposes and (3) without any financial inducement to the donors." Bis policy differs from National Institutes of Health guidelines, issued in 2000, only in that he would not fund research on lines created after his Aug. 9 announcement. 
One question is whether the parents of an embryo have standing to consent tu the killing of their child so that his body can be used for research. And proper consent obviouslv is absent where embryos are cre~ted fur the purpose of killing them to obtain their stem cells. 
Apart from consent, the decision to fund research on existing cell lines is not intrinsically wrong. With proper consent, one can morally use the body of a mur­der victim for research. But the Bush pol­icy is immoral for circumstantial reasons. 
The policy "encourages" scientists to kill more embryos by extracting their stem cells in the hope of persuading the government to fund research on them. And it "encourages" the creation of embryos for the specific purpose of killing them and seeking federal funding for such research. Pressure for funding of new cell lines will be irresistible because the Bush policy already con­cedes the legitimacy of funding research on stem cells after embryos have been killed. 
The Bush policy involves the govern­ment in scandalous complicity in murder. both as to existing cell lines and especial­ly as to any lines created in the future. 

Hemember: Each of us is a funner embryo. Each and every killing of a human embryo by removal of the stem cells is, in moral terms. a homicide. It is no defense that the victims were going tu die anyway. Aren't we all? Nor is it a defense that the research will benefit older human beings, as when the Nazis and Japanese, in World War IL used prisoners in lethal experiments. And if we can kill innocP.nt human beings to use their bodies to save lives. what conclu­sive objection can there be to killing them to make lampshades? 
Under "Roe v. Wade," the unborn child is a nonperson until birth and therefore destruction of the embryo is a constitu­tional right. President Bush missed an opportunity to challenge that nonperson­hood of the youngest human beings. His focus only on funding implicitly concedes the legitimacy, under Roe, of' the research itself, of homicide as a scientific technique. This carrit~s us further down the path charted by of the contraceptive ethic in which man makes himself (or herse!O the arbiter of whether and when life shall begin (arid, implicitly, end). 
The Bush policy, as the Pennsylvania Catholic Conference put it, puts America "on a dangerous path in which govern­ment endorses the death of one for the potential cure of another. [Instead]. sci­entific advancements that cooperate with God's plan for life and love are the surest means of alleviating suffering and build­ing up the dignity of man and the sanctity of life."

LETTER TO THE EDITOR 

Student leaders show courage at race retreat 
A strong commendation is in place for Notre Dame's stu­dent leadership. As the focus participants of this week­end's Learning to Talk About Race Retreat, a phenomenal but relatively new event, these prominent club and com­mittee heads from the Office of the President to FASO proved their strengths as leaders and showed their courage as people. While the LTR Retreat's principle mis­sion is to initiate positive and productive dialogue in race­related topics, I have ·all the confidence that this week­end's conversation will continue on as these leader-partic­ipants take home lessons learned and begin to plant of seeds of change. 
From addressing ignorant and hurtful statements on the Notre Dame campus to discussing race relations and demographics overall, the hours that these student lead­ers spent together sent an inspiring ripple of hope for the entire Notre Dame community. These student leaders, commissioned with the duty of embracing diversity educa­tion in their prospective organizations, will undoubtedly take their experience and lead the burgeoning movement at Notre Dame to increase sensitivity and awareness of diversity issues. 

I admire their courage, their commitment and their vision, and I anxiously wait to see these seeds of compas­sion and open-mindedness blossom into a better humani­ty.

After Sept. 11: Don't go nuts 


Now, let's not go nuts. Did a famous person once say. "don't go nuts," in a movie or an interview? I do not know, but probably, and I am saying it so you can quote me. What I mean to say, though, is to Anna Barbour remain who you have always been, remain who you are in the Get a Life wake of Sept. 11 's barbarous terror­ist attacks. 
As a nation, we have not yet nuked Afghanistan, and I take that as a sign that the United States' head officials are attempting to find a rational and just solution to the attacks. But are individual Americans also as circum­spect in how each deals with the aftermath of the attacks? And are some of our future foreign policies 
changing to represent a disre­gard for liberty and human rights? 
What I have in mind is people forgetting or throwing away their civil rights in order to feel more secure in the wake of Sept. 11. I am talking about blacklisting talk show hosts who have unpatriot­ic opinions. I am talking about detaining people in jail for an unspeci­fled amount of time without the proper evi­dence. I am talking about killing American citizens who wear turbans. I am talk­ing about airline pilots carrying guns on 11ights. I am talk­ing about Muslim women afraid to go gro­cery shopping alone. I am talking about Republicans and Democrats agreeing on everything. 
Is any of this normal? No. Do we want terrorists to affect our lives in anyway? No. So I am saying, let's not go nuts. I am saying do not let them change you. 
There is a difference between tak­ing a nip now and again from the bourbon bottle and drinking glasses of whiskey all alone in your room every night. There is a difference between exercising on a regular basis and having muscles so big, you cannot reach around your muscles to scratch your own back. There is a difference between taking precau­tionary measures, rooting out the problem, working to overcome the tragedy, or becoming a totalitarian state, putting people on McCarthy-like trials, monitoring every single move every single person makes. 
So. again, I am saying, let's not go nuts. People say they feel insecure now. Well. I agree. Yet. have we not been insecure for years and life went on? People say they want to be more prepared for disasters like this in the future. Even with as much security in all areas of life as possible, would we ever be fully prepared to repel every type of harmful attack? Even the Bush Administration's missile defense shield cannot defeat all threats. What about biological weapons of mass destruction that can be smuggled into water sources and the like? We have many prob­lems about which we can feel inse­cure. Global warming and energy-fuel shortage problems are just two problems we could dwell upon. 
Great Britain, however, in an attempt to feel more secure, wants everyone to carry an identification card for anti-terrorist precautions. The police will have the right to stop anybody any time and have him or her produce the ID card. Terrorists, though, have shown that they are willing to live in-country for years before they perpetrate their crimes and will probably be able to gain an 
ID card. The only people who may 
~-­
be caught by the ID cards are not terrorists but illegal immigrants and refugees that are 11eeing war-torn countries. New Yorkers, in addition, are carry­ing survival kits when they go out. These kits con­
tain gels that once spread upon the skin 
may slow down the effects of biological weapon attacks. I sup­pose it is useful to have the harmful effects 
of bio-weaponry slowed down. But, I ask you, 
are ID cards and 
gas m_asks what you want to carry around with you in 
the United States of America? I do not want to begin blaming every dis­aster upon terrorism. In Toulouse, France on Sept. 
24, a chemical plant exploded, and some blamed terrorists while investigators blamed carelessness. 
Neither do I want to forget that there are other problems in the world along with terrorists. Will the United States engage in international policies and treaties that compro­mise American concern for human rights? What precedent will be set if gaining aid in defeating terrorism from China or Russia means tacit 
U.S. consent for human rights abuses .in Chechnya or in Tibet? 
Do not forget what happened on Sept. 11. We should not stop fighting for a just conclusion to the attacks. We will always remember, in our prayers and actions, the victims and their loved ones harmed by the attacks. But should we change our entire way of life in fear of terror­ists?

Holy water blesses; pornography harms 
Editor's note: "On the Way" is the Campus Ministry's question and answer column that will appear every other Tuesday. Please direct questions concerning the prac­tices and principles ofCatholicism to Father J. Steele at ministry. l@nd.edu. 
Why do Catholics bless themselves with holy water? 
Holy water fonts, those little dipping bowls near the entrance of a Church, have a long and splendid history. They date back to the earliest churches in the Roman period after Constantine when one passed through an open court with a fountain at the center to enter a church. 
While the liturgy was going on, two groups of people would Father J. remain in the court, the penitents and the catechumens. Steele 
The penitents, a term sometimes still used for people waiting to go to confession, were those who because of serious sin had to remain outside the church for periods of up to several years. On the Way 
The catechumens, another term still in use, were those preparing for baptism. The fonts, used for baptism, were often octagonal and frequently had three steps down into the water. The octagonal shape referred to a common design for Roman mausoleums and the three steps suggested Jesus' three days in the tomb before the resurrection. Baptism, then as now, is a commitment to die to sin so that we may rise to new life in Christ. 
While the court of the penitents has disappeared as a feature of church architec­ture, vestiges of it still remained through the centuries. One of them is the holy water font. Since the Second Vatican Council ·the Church has re-emphasized the value and meaning_ofbaptism. Thus. in recent years, there has been an architectural develop­ment which harkens back to the baptismal courts of earlier times. Large baptismal founts haye been bui_lt near the entrances of churches helping us to recall the origi­nal meanmg of blessmg ourselves upon entering a Church. The Basilica's newly ren­ovated and relocated baptismal font with its octagonal form and impressive size is an excellent example of this development. 
S~. ~hen we bless ourselves upon entering a Church we join the generations of Chnstians who regularly recalled and recommitted themselves to their Baptism, an ongoing death to sin so as to live in the light of the Gospel. 
Nobody gets hurt, so what's wrong with pornography? 
Since the rise of the Internet in the last few years, the question of pornography has become almost commonplace. As a confessor on a college campus and from plenty of conversations I can say with some certainty that most young men have had some exposure to pornography and an apparently growing number have become compul­sive in their resort to pornography and sexual fantasy. Seemingly, no one gets hurt. So what difference does it make? 
Pl_enty. For the guy who is beginning to rely on pornography and fantasy to allay amnety, stress, loneliness, boredom, etc, the escape is minimal and temporary. Worse, he now returns to his previous emotions with the added burden of shame. This may set him up for another episode. With succeeding episodes there is a dawn­ing awareness that one is losing control. Certainly, not everyone who looks at porn will become compulsive about it, but all current studies show that sexual addictions are sharply increasing. Even if one does not become addicted, the same dynamic of shame-and-return often apply. 
And there are spiritual reasons pornography should be avoided. The Church's long and consistent teaching on sexuality tells us that the expression of intimate love (as well as the possibility of procreation) is an essential element of sexual expression. Pornographic images do not depict a loving encounter but something impersonal and base. These images can "teach" the viewer wrong ideas about sexuality which may be carried over into a marriage relationship. I would not want a sister or daughter of mine to marry a man whose ideas of sexuality were formed by years of viewing pornography. 
The question of pornography always returns us to the design of God in making us sexual beings. God is not ashamed of sex. God made our sexuality. along with all cre­ation, and has pronounced it good. According to John Paul II, when sex is the expression of complete self-surrender to the other, when it says I am yours and you are mine, completely and without reservation within the context of marriage, it is an experience that is holy. Sex should be sacred. And that is the best reason to avoid pornography.

ALBUM REVIEW 
Sebastopal demonstrates Farrar's solo talent 
By BRIAN KORNMANN 
Scene Music Critic 
i'  
' Considered one of the leaders of the alternative­country music movement, Jay Farrar turned some heads when he announced last year he was taking a break from his band, Son Volt, to produce a solo album. There was talk that Farrar was going to repeat the same behavior that led to the breakup of his former band, Uncle Tupelo. 
Uncle Tupelo rose from relative obscurity in St. Louis to become the nation's premier band in the alternative-country genre, mixing traditional aspects of country music and adding elements of punk, rock and the blues. 
Founded in 1989, Uncle Tupelo released four albums (No Depression, Still Feel Gone, March 16­20, and Anodyne) before breaking up in 1994, after Farrar and fellow Uncle Tupelo member Jeff Tweedy decided to focus on their respective side projects. Tweedy went on to Lind success as the lead singer of

Wilco, but steadily shifted from a country sound to a darker pop sound. 
Farrar, meanwhile, went on to record with Son Volt and release what Rolling Stone and Spin maga­zine calfed one of the greatest albums of the lust 30 years in Truce (which can also be found in the world-famous Club 23 jukebox). Written while driving from New Orleans to Minnesota, the album is a series of emotions and sounds that reflected Farrar's great ability to write music. After two other Son Volt releases (Straightaways and Wide Swing Tremolo) Farrar and Son Volt took a year off before Farrar made the decision to release a solo project for his next album. 
It was worth the wait. On Farrar's debut album. Sebastopal, he shows the great range of music and power­ful lyrics that have become his trademark. Consisting of 17 songs. the "solo" effort actually consists of Farrar playing guitar, piano, key­boards, and the tambura, with 10 other musicians filling in on drums. bass, etc. on the album. 
The album's strength comes from what many fans have come to expect from a Farrar-led band: powerful 

Bad Ronald releases unbelievably bad album 
The band's press release describes Bad Ronald as con­sisting of "3 MCs, a DJ and enough free-stylin', beats and phat hooks to start any party." Playing this band at a party will only clear everyone out of the room with everyone think­ing that you have the absolute worst taste in music possible. 
Although these jokers want to be the next Limp Bizkit, the actual music behind the mad-· ness is honestly closer to Hanson's "MMMBopp." Only artists like Sugar Ray. Smash Mouth and Michael Bolton 


By GEOFF RAHIE Scene Music Criric 
On their debut album, Bad Ronald makes a case for the most annoying group of human beings put together in one room. Using samples, bor­ing hip-hop beats, remedial guitar licks and very preten­tious rap vocals, the band takes the waste of the MTV Generation to a whole new level. Fred Durst looks like a genius compared to Bad Ronald.

However, the album sho·uld be an enjoyable listen to anyone who is anchored by terrific songs such as Voodoo Candle, Feed Kill Chain. Dtain and Damn Shame. The entire album flows well, and is a great listen from start to end. The replay value on the album is high as well, as no songs stick out as being annoying or out of place on the album.

It's clear from the start what Bad Ronald is all about: mass quanti­ties of marijuana and women. "We're gonna light the weed/ Tap the keg/ Now let's begin/ We gonna kick right back/ We're gonna sit right down/ Enjoy it girl/ You're gonna love this sound." 
The songs are all about the band's daily life. which consists of doing a lot of drugs and meeting a lot of women. "Had Idea" is about a man's love for a college girl. while "Lost On Tour" is about the band taking a wrong turn with their tour bus. It's hard to imagine women actually becoming groupies of this ensemble.

some ideas off me," he said. 'Tm just going to be there in a little more of a support role. I'm just trying to help Kevin, help our team, help in any way I can to solve this problem." 
Notre Dame's offense is conservative -something coaches feel may have developed after Notre Dame's 27-10 loss at Nebraska -which is fine with Davie. 
But what is hurting the Irish the most is their offensive mistakes. 
Three games into the season, the Irish already have nine turnovers -one more than all last season -and have only converted 12 of 46 third down attempts. 
"If you arc going to be as conservative as we are, then you'd better execute at a very high, high level," Davie said. ''We are not doing that." 
But what the Irish are lacking is the capability to make big plays. Their longest passing play this season has only been 19 yards long and Tony Fisher's 35-yard scamper against Nebraska remains the longest rushing play the Irish have pulled off. 
It's not that opposing defenses are throwing complicated schemes at the Irish. Texas A&M only blitzed twice dur­ing Saturday's game. Instead. the Aggies seemed content to let the Irish beat them with a big play -something they haven't been able to do this season -a strategy Davie said he would use if he were coaching against the Irish. 
. 'Td sit back and then beat you with offense," he said. "Don't give up a big play because it doesn't like right now we are going to generate a big play on our own. There doesn't seem to be a whole lot of explosiveness." 
Holiday started at quarterback against Texas A&M and will start again this week against Pittsburgh because Davie hoped he could provide that explosive­ness. Although Holiday carried 12 times for 23 yards and was 6-for-13 passing with two interceptions before leaving with a sprained neck at the end of the firsl. half. Davie felt Holiday showed flashes of what the coaching staff believed he was capable of. 
But Holiday made several key mis­takes that hurt the Irish. On Notre Dame's first offensive drive Saturday, with the ball deep in Aggie territory, Holiday missed a wide-open tight end John Owens in the corner of the end zone. 
The next play, his pass that was intended for David Givens was intercept­ed in the end zone. And late in the sec­ond quarter Holiday underthrew Givens again, resulting in another Aggie inter­ception. 
And it wasn't just Holiday. Lovecchio was ineffective at quarterback in the second half. The offensive line gave up six sacks. Receivers dropped balls. 
"The bottom line is it's not what you do -it's how you do it," Davie said. "The best laid plans in a game some­times get discombobulated. There's much more premium on how you do things, not what you call. There's no magic scheme. The bottom line is to play hard and execute and be mistake free and not make the big dramatic mistake." 
"The plays themselves arc just fine," said Holiday. "We just haven't been able to execute at certain times, and we have to do that in order to win." 
Davie doesn't know exactly what is wrong with the offense. But by getting more involved with the offensive plan­ning, he hopes to get the Irish back on track. 
"We all feel the same way," Davie said. "You keep waiting. You keep waiting, but it's just not happening. You certainly feel like the energy and the emotion and the ·want to' is there, and the chance to do it is there. But it just hasn't come."

WOMEN'S INTERHALL GOLD LEAGUE 

Late pass rescues Lions 
ByMATTLOZAR 
Sports Writer 
After letting the opponent comeback from two touch­downs late in the game, a team can play for the tie, or go for the vi.in. · 
The Lions of Lyons Hall chose the latter, and used a late touchdown drive to give them a 20-12 win over Pangborn on Sunday. 
With the score tied at 12 and under a minute to play, the Lions went 65 yards in 35 seconds for the winning touchdown. A 10-yard pass from junior quarterback Sarah Jenkins to sopho­more Allison Shenk capped off the five-play drive. 
"It was a tense situation," said Lyons captain Irene Onyeagbako. "But we were confident and luckily, we came through." 
The Phoxes made the lions sweat with two touch­downs in tho last 10 min­utes of the second half. Their second touchdown, a 35-yard reverse halfback pass to sophomore Tia Vonil highlighted the Phoxes' charge. 
"We didn't really practice that exact play." said Pangborn senior co-captain Nicole Tutin. "We kinda had something close to that, it was a variation called in the huddle." 
Lyons' offense was led by Jenkins. Her three touch­down passes, two to Shenk and the other to senior Megan Chandler, highlight­ed her superb performance. 
"She [Jenkins] had an excellent game," said Onyeagbako. "The whole offense really went to the next level and executed so well." 
Freshman quarterback Charlotte Troupis, along with Vonil and Tutin, car­ried the Phoxes' offense. Tutin scored the Phoxes· first touchdown on a short run to ignite their come­back attempt. 
Breen-Phillips 6, Badin 6 
Big plays on both sides of the ball from the Breen­Phillips Babes and Badin Bullfrogs led to a 6-6 tie on ·Sunday. 
BP scored first, on a 78­yard touchdown run from senior quarterback Katie McFarland, in the first half. 
"We came out flat in the first half," said BP senior captain Jenny Wahoske. "Katie's run really helped 
us." 

Badin answered the BP · score with a nine-play drive. Junior Courtney Giel's fingertip catch on a 25-yard touchdown pass from sophomore quarter­back Erin Zachary tied the game for Badin. 
"She [Giel] made an unbelievable catch in the first half." said Badin junior captain Amy Marshall. 
After that scoring, both defenses shut down the opposition. BP recorded three sacks and one inter­ception. Wahoske led the BP defense with two sacks and numerous pass deflec­tions. 
"Our defense played real­ly well," said Wahoske. "We got our hands on a lot of passes that should have been intercepted ... 
The Bullfrog defense made some of their own big plays. They allowed only three first downs and inter­cepted the Babes on their last two drives. Sophomore Cindy Adimari's intercep­tion in the end zone kept the Babes from a late win­..... ning touchdown. 
"Our defense really stepped up in the second half," said Marshall. "Suzie Schaab and Cindy Adimari made interceptions that gave us some great oppor­tunities." 
The tie gave the Babes some encouragement but they would have preferred a win. 
"A tie's OK, it takes our record to 1-1-1," said Wahoske. "The game was good, but could have been better." ·

What does the Church teach? Why does it matter? Have questions and need a place to ask them? Each one credit course in the series "Know Your Catholic Faith" will reflect on a central feature of the Catholic faith, so that students come away with a clear idea of what the Church holds on these topics as well as a basic theological and personal understanding of them. The courses will be based on the Catechism of the Catholic Church plus other pertinent texts, supplemented by personal reflection and experiential learning where appropriate. These courses should meet the needs of those students who know little or nothing about the faith, as well as those who are familiar with the faith but do not feel they have a clear grasp of certain features of Christian doctrine. The courses will be presented in a variety of formats and venues.

At the beginning of the season, the Irish, under new coach John Jasinski, were practicing twice a day.

A line-up change before the tournament enabled Lunke to play at the Wolverine lnvitational. The Trish's top per­former for the weekend and freshman Ryan Marshall replaced Gavin Ferlic and K.C. Wiseman, based on perfor­mances from last weekend's Earl Yestingmeier Invitational. 
It turns out Jasinski made a good decision, and Lunke was glad to have the opportunity to help his team. 
"I was really happy with this weekend," Lunke said. "I kind of gave some shots away coming down, but ! was pleased." 
Steve Ratay, last year's top golfer for the Irish, had a solid performance, finishing in 27th place after two rounds of 7 4. Marshall and junior Chris Whitten finished 76th and 92nd, respectively.

Aggies feast on Irish saltines 
Have you ever played that saltine cracker game? 
You know the one. You find one of your unsuspecting friends, bet him or her that they can't eat five saltines in one minute. they say that's easy, and then you watch them struggle through the plaster of Paris that is now their mouth. 
Yeah, well, I found one friend such in O'Hare Airport's Chili's on Friday. We were waiting for our flight to College Station. 
And for what must have been the first time in the histo­ry of the world, or at least stu­pid bets, someone ate (and swallowed) those five crackers with six seconds to spare. 
I was a little deflated after throwing down my impossible gauntlet only to see him rip through it like Nitro on American Gladiators. 
I tried to figure out how he did it. Maybe the crackers weren't regulation size (they did look a little small). Maybe the rules called for six and not five or for a SO-second eating window. 

But in the end, no matter what the reason, I lost. Bob Davie had a similar weekend. 
"Right now on offense, I don't think there's much confi­dence, and it's been well­intentloned, but the bottom line, it hasn't happened right now," Davie said. 
Obviously, the Notre Dame head football coach was not referring to the saltine chal­lenge in my horribly construct­ed segue. 
But there is a certain simi­larity (work with me here). Anyone can look to Notre Dame's 24-3 loss to Texas A&M on Saturday and try to pick out specifics concerning why the Irish haven't done much at all this season. 
The only things that people remember are the final scores. 
So far, Michigan State ate the crackers in somewhere around my friend's time. The Huskers and the Aggies wolfed them down in about 20 sec­onds. 
I didn't start this column the way I did because I think it's particularly funny. insightful or a good working metaphor. 
Instead, like the entire Irish football community, I'm at a loss. And the most memorable thing I could think of from this weekend's travel was the cracker story (that, and taking a sharp jab to the shoulder from an airport sliding door). 
I could trot out statistics about lack of touchdowns scored or lack of big plays pro­duced or lack of wins notched. 
That's useful for a while, to illustrate a point. but you've heard them all already. Heck, you watched the game. I wouldn't be offended if you didn't offer me immediate Mensa membership if I told you this team is bad right now because it didn't do x, y, and z. 
Davie said it all on Sunday. Talking about his offense: ''We don't seem to have much banked fundamentally, or even scheme-wise, right now that we can do, that we can exe­cute at a high level or get our players into a comfort zone with." 
A little later on: "We've kin<l of gotten ourselves kind of into a -you know, I'm not sure what we are on third down." 
But what really struck me reading through the transcript of his teleconference was his frank assessment of the big picture of his team, probably right on with all Notre Dame fans. 
~I think when you look at it, the thing that's so disappoint­ing to me is how many ... plays where there's no chance, just no chance. We look like a poorly-coached football team, and that's hard for me to swal­low and hard for me to say. but that's what I see." 
Davie said what all of us know: it's not that the Irish are 0-3, it's how they've played in getting there that makes play­ers, fans, and coaches alike cringe. 
I travel to the away games to broadcast them on WVFI. I must admit. I'm often very vocal in my criticism of what's going on down on the field, at least much more so than I am here. 

Part of that is due to the emotion of the game that unfolds as live drama. And part of that is due to the fact that I know I'm not also talking to the players, as I do here each week. 
That's probably wrong. It's like I'm a fifth grader laughing until the teacher comes in and then hiding the whoopie cush­ion behind my back. 
But I also know these guys are worrying about the same things I worry about at the same age, and despite getting all fired up during the games, we are still just kids. At least until we graduate. 
So yes, the Notre Dame foot­ball team's performance is inexcusable thus far this sea­son. Yes, I can refer to third down inefficiency or lack of yards or the near non-exis­tence of points. 
Fact is, it's all been said, and everyone knows the numbers. 
So I chose to talk about crackers, one of the more amazing parts of my weekend. 
And you know, I really wish someone could tell me what was going on there. ·

Belles fall to Alma, sweep past Rochester 
By KATIE McVOY Associate Sports Editor 
Communication was key to the Belles in a 1-1 weekend finish. 
After dropping the first match to Alma 3-0, Saint Mary's stepped up play and solidified team communication for a 3-0 win against Rochester. 
"I thought we communicated a lot better in the second game compared to the first game," senior Jamie Dineen said. 'That was basically the key." 
The increased communication allowed the Saint Mary's defense to dominate Saturday afternoon. The Belles held Roche~ter to 49 total points. keeping the team under 20 in all three games. Meanwhile, the Saint Mary's offense kicked in and picked up the pace. 
"We ran a really quick offense to stay up and keep on our toes," Dineen said. 
With captain and leading defender Angie Meyers out with a torn ACL, the young members of the team had to step up play, which they did very well. 
Freshman Alison Shevik led the team with 14 digs, 13 kiUs and 28 total attacks. 
"[Shevik's) been doing great," Dineen said. "All the underclass­men arc stepping up and our coach is trying new girls at differ­ent positions." 
A solid 30-15 victory in game one of the match got the Belles off on the right foot. They took the lead early in all three games

and never looked back, taking game two 30-18 and game three 30-16. After_a long stretch of close losses, the win put them back on the right track. 
"We're very happy, very glad to win," Dineen said. "We feel that in a lot of our games in the con­ference we've played really well but our record doesn't justify how we played." 
Match one didn't go as well for the Belles. For the fifth consecu­tive time, the Belles fell to MIM competition. This time they fell to the Scots of Alma. 
"In that game we seemed a lit­tle slow getting to the ball," Dineen said.· "We weren't really talking, there was a lack of com­munication." 
The first game was close. The teams traded points, but Alma came out with the 30-27 win. 

Games two and three were not as close. The Scots took control of play, recording 10 aces to the Belles' three. They wrapped up game two 30-17 and game three 30-22. 
"We seemed so slow the first game ... we knew what we had to do, but we just didn't get the job done," Dineen said. 
Senior Jolie LeBeau led the Belles offense with nine kills and 24 total attacks. Shevik again led the defense with 16 digs and one block. 
The loss dropped Saint Mary's to 1-6 in the MIAA and 2-11 overall. The Belles will take on the Britons of Albion on Wednesday at Albion.

Kreher leads Irish in road match at Toledo 
By NOAH AMSTADTER 
Sports Editor 
With the Big East's best player on board, the Irish volleyball team boards the bus today for its first midweek non-conference away game of the season as Notre Dame takes on Toledo at Savage Hall tonight at 7 p.m. 
The No. 22-ranked Irish (7-3) come in with a four-match win­ning streak while the Rockets (7­
3) enter with three wins in a row. Notre Dame comes in on a high note after sweeping Big East rival Virginia Tech 3-0 Friday night and topping Georgetown in four games Sunday. 
Leading the Irish in those two matches was senior opposite Kristy Kreh er. Kreher totaled 32 kills in seven games, posting a . 407 attack percentage. Kreher's efforts earned her the Big East player of the week award on Monday.

ing," Kreher said. 'Tm very hon­ored to be chosen for it." 
After playing Georgetown on Sunday, the Irish would normally take a day off on Monday. Instead, the team practiced on Monday and heads east to play Toledo for the first time since 1998. 
"We're excited to play again, to be able to focus on stuff on our side of the net," Kreher said. "Toledo's not as strong as some of the other opponents that we've had but it's still a match." 
One of the keys for the Irish this past weekend was success on the block. Notre Dame totaled 21 blocks in the four-game win over Georgetown, including nine by Malinda Goralski. 
Notre Dame hopes to continue that success tonight, albeit by a slightly different approach . Whereas Georgetown's leading scorers played on the outside, Toledo is led by junior middle blocker Jessica Buck and senior middle blocker Lindsey Kretzmann. With the attack com­ing from the inside, Irish head coach Debbie Brown changed her defensive strategy. 
"We're going to do what is call'ed a commit block where we're actually jumping maybe a little ahead of the hitter or for sure right on time with them," Brown said. "We anticipate that we'll get more solo blocks against this team because typically we're not going Lo comm'it two people on it but we could commit one." 
After Sunday's success against the Hoyas, the Irish look to use their advantage on the block tonight. 
"They're not a very strong blocking team at all," Brown said. "In fact, [Irish senior Malinda Goralski] averages more blocks a game than their whole team. Their middles are very offensive, but. they're not really blockers." 
Kreher is just looking forward to the team unity on the road to Toledo. 
"We like road trips," Krehcr said. "Bus trips are fun. We have a lot of fun on the bus."

McGlinn takes home first win in 4 years 
. Shamrocks score winning TD on game's final play 
By KEN CHAMPA and PHILIP KOESTERER Sports Writers

The game's final play was a complete role reversal from last year's outcome when Off­Campus defeated McGlinn on a similar Hail Mary play.

WOMEN'S INTERHALL BLUE LEAGUE 
Lewis faces Howard in 'Battle of the Birds' 
By MATT MOONEY, BRIAN LONG and JOE HETTLER Sports Wrlrers 
Come tonight, the feathers will fly. 
½'hen the Howard Ducks (2-1) square off against the Lewis Chicks (3-0-1), Howard will face its most challenging test yet. 
"We're treating it like a playoff game," said Howard captain Katie Cawley. "We know it's going to be a tough game." 
Clearly, Howard places a lot of value on this game. A win for Howard would pull them into a tie with Lewis for first place in the Blue League. 
"We need to have confidence and know we can win," said Cawley. "I think we have that." 
Lewis, however, looks to solidify its place in the standings and head into the playoff,;. 
"A win for us secures a playoff spot and keeps us atop the stand­ings in our division," said Chick captain Caitlin Murray. "That's important to us." 
The road to victory will not be an easy one for the Ducks. In order to win, they will have to score. Unfortunately for them, the last three opponents the Chicks have faced have failed to do so. 
"We have an extremely tough defense," said Murray. "It's been a consistent strong point for us and it should be able to handle [Howard's offense] without a problem." · 
However, Howard feels like its defense is no push-over either. The front line is led by two fresh­men. Brin Anderson and Charleen Vinalon. According to Murray, they play fur beyond their years. 
"They did very well [against Farley]. They had at lea.st 5 sacks [between the two of them]. They don't play like freshmen." 
With the defenses matched the way they are, this game may come down to who wins the battle between the two quarterbacks. Erin Nasrallah will lead Lewis's attack, while Howard is led by Jill Veselik. 
In e_ach of their previous games, both quarterbacks had stellar per­formances. Against Farley on Tuesday. Nasrallah dropped four touchdowns on the Finest, passing for three and running for another. 
Veselik was no slouch herself. Against Farley on Sunday, she connected on a deep touchdown pass and also scored on a quarter­back keeper. 
Cawley feels quite confident that Veselik will outdo her counterpart. 
"Jill can read the other team's defenses very well. We think she's better." 
Murray, however, feels con­vinced that the Chicks control their own destiny on offense. 
"We stop ourselves [on offense]. When our offense gets it together, nothing can be done [to stop it]." 
The two teams will meet tonight at 7 p.m. at Riehle West Field for the right to decide which team is fowl and which is fair. 
McGlinn vs. Farley 
Fresh off their first win of the season, the McGlinn Shamrocks are looking to continue their improving ways as they square off against Farley Hall tonight. 
After starting the season with a loss and a tie, McGlinn took advantage of a small Off-Campus team to pull their record to 1-1-1. 
Also hoping to improve on Uieir early season efforts, Farley's Finest will come out Tuesday night looking for that first victory. 
Losses to Howard and Lewis. plus a tie with Walsh, puts Farley's record at 0-2-1. 
Leading Farley's offensive will be quarterback Megan Sheehan, as the team looks to put some points on the board this week. 
"We didn't get off to a great start, but hopefully we can put things together and score a couple points," said sophomore Julie Goolia. 
McGlinn, feeling confident after tasting victory on Sunday, will still concentrate on bringing the team together. On the offensive side of the ball, the Shamrocks will look to receiver On-Kay Wong for her big-play ability. 
McGlinn captain Christa Gray felt that the past few practices for her team have been very produc­tive, and to look for the Shamrocks to come out firing on all cylinders. 
"We don't know what to expect from Farley, but hopefully we will come together as a team and take home another victory," said Gray. 
As Gray stated, these two teams don't really know what to expect from each other, but both squads played Walsh Hall to a tie earlier this season. 
Cavanaugh vs. Walsh 
A powerful offense meets a stingy defense on Tuesday night when Cavanaugh faces off against Walsh in a key interhall football match-up. The winner controls its playoff destiny. while the loser may need help to reach the post­season. 
Both teams have gotten to this point in their seasons by relying on different strengths. Cavanaugh has used a big play offense that scored 28 points in a win over Off-Campus last week, while Walsh's suffocating defense has yet to be scored upon this season. On Tuesday, something has to give. 
"We're pretty much sticking to what's been working for us so far," said Cavanaugh head coach Bart Bruckert. "We're pretty con­fident we can score enough to 
. win each game." Scoring on the Walsh del"ense, however, has been impossible thus far this season. The Wild Women have already racked up four shutout.s in four games. "Our defense has been consis­tently strong," said Walsh co-cap­tain Alison Troy. "We've definitely got some good freshman [on defense] that are helping out a lot." On the other side of the ball, the 
Wild Women will be looking to improve on their anemic offense that has only produced a total of six point'l this season. 
"Our offense has been doing a good job of moving down the field but they've just had trouble get­ting into the end zone," said Troy. "We're just having a little more difficulty with the offense right now." 
Meanwhile, the Chaos defense is coming off a strong perfor­mance from last week in which they forced four interceptions and didn't allow a point. Due to the recent success of Cavanaugh's overall team play, Bruckert believes they are ready to face tonight's test. 
"[Walsh isl a pretty good team, but I think that if we just do everything we said we were going to do in practice, such as a exe­cute, we should be pretty good to go," said Bruckert. 
Troy, on the other hand, knows that Walsh's offense must step up their game if the Wild Women hope to stay undefeated. 
"We know [Cavanaugh] did really well last year, so we're expecting them to be very com­petitive this year," said Troy. "Basically we're going to have to execute well on offense, get the ball down the field, and get into the end zone."

FOOTBALL 
Davie gets offensive 
 Irish coach gets more involved in planning plays 
By ANDREW SOUKUP Associate Spons Editor 
Tired of seeing mistakes. missed opportunities and missed plays, Bob Davie announced that he would be more involved with offensive planning sessions in order to jump-start Notre Dame's ineffective offense. 
"It's not going to be anything dramatic that you see or all of a sudden I'm calling the plays," he said after practice Monday. "I don't trunk I need to do that, but I do think I need to be more involved from a leadershlp stand­point." 
Notre Dame is statistically among the worst offensive teams in the nation. The Irish are 113th out of 115 Division I-A teams in total offensive yards and dead last in scoring, averaging only 7.66 points per game. On Notre Dame's two touchdowns, the offense has driven a combined 1 0 yards. 
"There's way too many plays where it looks like a Chinese fire drill," Davie said Sunday after­noon. 
Davie insisted that offensive coordinator Kevin Rogers' posi­tion would not be affected. Rogers will still be calling all the offensive plays during the games -in part so Davie can stay focused on his defensive responsi­bilities.

ND WOMEN'S TENNIS 
Irish netters win on both coasts 
By COLIN BOYLAN 
Sports Wrirer 

While their teammates competed in a tournament more than 2,000 miles away, Irish tennis players Nina Vaughn and Caylan Leslie were making a successful homecoming to Southern California. 
Vaughn, a resident of Corona Del Mar, and Leslie, of Newport Beach, took part in the Adidas Invitational at Palm Springs, Calif. -an individual event that showcased the top talent in women's col­legiate tennis. 
Both players fared well in their first official competition of the new season. 
Leslie fought her way to the finals of the consolation bracket before losing a tough match to UCLA's Lauren Fisher 7­5, 5-7. 7-6. Vaughn followed suit by win­ning her first consolation match and sub­sequently teamed up with Leslie to reach the quarterfinals of the doubles draw. 
And although she stayed focused on the task at hand, Vaughn admits it was nice to be back in California for the weekend. 
"It was nice to be able to see my fami­ly," she said. "We sort of had a home crowd advantage going on there." 
Especially surprising was the play of Sophomore Leslie, whose griHy perfor­mance against the 76th-ranked Fisher proved that she belonged among the top players in the game. 
"I thought Caylan looked leaps and bounds better than she did last year and she was awesome last year," said Vaughn. 
Head coach Jay Louderback agreed. 
"I think Caylan had a very good tour­nament against some tough competi­tion," he said. 
Meanwhile, the rest of the Notre Dame team competed the Georgia Invitational. a four-team tournament among the Notre Dame. Georgia, Kansas State and Miami tennis squads. 
Although not official for the purposes of record keeping, the tournament was nonetheless an important gauge of the team's early season progress. 
Senior Becky Varnum stole the show when she topped Georgia's Anne Nguyen, the 12th-ranked singles player in the nation. 4-6, 6-3, 6-2. Varnum fin­ished the weekend with five victories 
overall, including three in doubles  com­ 
petition.  
Senior Lindsey Green also had  a  solid  

weekend, winning a tough match against Kansas State's Petra Sedlmajerova on Saturday. 
All things considered, Louderback was encouraged by the progress of his play­ers. 
"We played well and we improved as the tournament went on," he said. "I def­initely like what I saw this weekend."
