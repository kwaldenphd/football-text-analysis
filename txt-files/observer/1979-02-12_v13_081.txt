Al McGuire discusses own careers, sportscasters 
by Andy Segoria StaffReporter 
AI McGuire, former head basketball coach at Marquette University and color commentator for coUege basketball on NBC, spoke before a crowd of approximately 100 ~pie at Howard Hall last night. 
McGuire opened with a bnef discussion on hi:s careers, discussed yesterday's game, and ended by taking various questions from the floor. 
McGuire stated his belief in multiple careers, "I am now on my third career,'' he said. His first career included jobs as a bartender, construciton worker, and pro basketball ~;>layer for the New York Knicks. McGuire described this period as 'a soul-searching process which everyone goes through." 
Next McGuire went on to coach basketball for 20 years. ''I stayed too long but was fortunate to go out with a last hurrah,'' he quipped. 
"Now I am in business," he said. McGuire is currently vice-president of an industrial firm. "I am not completely disenchanted with it, but I think business is relatively shallow some of the time." 
McGuire does not consider his commenting role as a career. "It is just on weekends; an ego kind of thing which prevents me from going cold turkey. " 
McGuire did say that he enjoyed working with professional sportcasters such as Jim Simpson and Dick Enberg, who he considers as the best in the business. "You play off a pro," McGuire remarked, "in life if you Want to be successful, you must associate with successful people.'' 
Concerning yesterday's game, McGuire believes that strong comments made by the press following the first ND-UCLA game in

Bakhtiar resigns; tnonarchy 1in final hours' 
TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -Prime Minister Shahpour Bakhtiar re­portedly resigned yesterday after Iran's military chief declared support for Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. The 2,500-year-old 
Observer 
apologizes for edition 
We at The Observer would like to apologize for both the tardy deliH:ry of la"t Friday's edition as well a'> the incorrect ordering of its pages. However, the circumstances that caused these problems were not subject to our control. 
The Observer is printed at the Penny Saver Press in South Bend, and on Friday the Penny Saver experienced mechanical problems with their presses. These were partially solved, al­lowing the paper to be printed, but the ordenng of rhe papers' inside pages was incorrect. 
These problems were dis­cussed at length with the Penny Saver management in order to prevent them in the future. 

iranian monarchy appeared to be. 
in its final hours. 
The government news agency 
placed the death LOll in Tehran at 
more than 200 with scores killed 
in other cities during two days of 
bloody street fighting. 
Khomeini's followers took over 
Tehran Radio and issued a series 
of directives from the Provisional 
Revolutionary Government. The 
broadcasts said the shah-backed 
Bakhtiar government had fallen 
and all members of Parliament 
had resigned. 
The Khomeini followers also 
reported fighting continued in 
some cities but urged Tehran 
residents ' 'to refrain from atracks 
on the armed forces now that the 
revolution was triumphed and the 
armed forces have surrendered.'' 
Among many rumors circulat­
ing in Tehran were that Baktiar 
had fled the country and that he 
committed suicide. 
Gen. Abbas Gharabaghi, chief of staff of the armed forces, met with 70-year-old Mehdi Bazargan, named by Khomeini to be his prime minister, and said he would support the government set up by Khomeini to establish a 
'' revolutonary'' Islamic republic. 
The military chief ordered troops 
to stay in their barracks. 
The withdrawal of troops appeared to break the back of the constitutional monarchy that de· pended heavily on a loyal, united military. 
Khomeini, the 78-year-old re­ligious leader who returned to Iran Feb. 1 after 14 years in exile, declared · in a statement that "victory is neaf." 

Insurgents took over Tehran, looting military posts of weap~ms and ammunltlon, occupytl}g government buildings and police stations and racing through the streets flashing "V" for victory signs. They raided several prisons and released hundreds of "political" detainees jailed by the shah as common cnminals. 
Early today, huge explosions shook the western side of the city near Mehrabad International Airport. Tehran Radio said Jay barracks, one of Iran's largest tank garrisons, was in flames. The radio reported heavy shoot­ing there, in Majlis Square and two other areas of the capital. 
A source close to Bakhtiar told The Associated Press that the prime minister submitted his 
resignation in  the afternoon  to  
Bazargan,  a  friend for  over  30  
years.  

Ibrahih Yazdi, Khomeini's 

chief aide, said Bakhtiar, 54, had quit. There was no comment from Bakhtiar, and his where­abouts were unknown. Sources said the prime minister, appoint­ed Jan. 4, wrote his resignation because he cuold not continue without military support. 
Tehran Radio, overtaken by insurgents, said the speaker of the Majlis, the parliament, an­nounced that all members of Parliament also had resigned. 
Tehran Radio said some mili­tary personnel were resistin~ Gharabaghi's sdltement, but tt quoted the commander of the shah's elite Imperial Guard as saying, "I wish to state with much pride that the Imferial Guard is on the side o the nation.'' 
In one of its -first acts, the provisional operational staff of the Islamic Revolutionary Move-· ment closed Iran's borders and all airports for 24 hours beginn­ing today, Tehran Radio said. 
In Washington, the Pentagon ordered a detachment of 69 Marines sent from the United States to Turkey in case they were needed to help 19 Marines protect the U.S. Embassy in Iran, Six Air Force helicopters were

real issue was not pari"etals but rather the lack of student input into student life policy formula­tion. 
Michele Kelly, Farley Hall president, read the statement to a group of approximately 40 hall re!>idents. This was the ftrst official reading of the hall posi­tion, created after mandatory sectionmeetingsheld last week to assess the desires of the whole Farley population. Kelly said she 
'and the members of the hall council felt this was an acurate consensus of hall opinion as presented by the section leaders at a hall council meeting last Thursday. 
In rejecting Carroll Hall's init­iative to abolish parietals, Farley called for a recognition ~y the Administration ofstudent dtscon­tent and for increased student participation, through voting power, in forming rules govern­mg student life. The present Campus Life Council (CLC) has no inherent legislative powers. 
In the proposal, Farley stated that ''we beueve that the Admin­istration does not fully acknowl­edge the student body as adults fully capable of making respon­sible decisions." 
The hall asked for support from the student body in addressing the issue. For effective leader­ship, they appealed to student government to "represent the obvious widespread discontent and disillusiorunent of the stu­dents." They felt that strong vocal representation was impor­tant in defining and defendng the students' position, and that stu­dent government should provide this representation. 
Editor's note: The complete statement by Farley Hall is printed on today 's Editorial page.

Archbishop condemns strikers 
FOLKESTONE, England (AP) -The Archbishop of Canterbury condemned tl1e "sheer pitiless­ness" of some British strikers yesterday, saying they have hurt the old and the young, left the dead unburied and turned their backs on the sick and dying. 
"Pity is out, mercy is out and the sense of !brotherhood in the nation is out," said Dr. Donald Coggan spiritual head of the Church of England and the worldwide Anglican Communion, in a sermon at St. John the Baptist Church in this southeast coastal town. The Communion includes the Protestant Episcopal Churchin the U.S. 
He said British society is in danger of destroying itself by selfishness and condemned what he said was a widespread attitude of ''every man for himself.'' He called for a change of heart among employees and employers alike. 
The archbishop was comment­ing on a campaign of strikes, slowdowns and picketing by 1.5 million public service workers demanding more pay. 
The disruption, which began Jan. 22, has reduced some hospi­tals and ambulance units to emergency services only, closed schools, left bodies unburied and garbage uncollected.

'Innocent' squirrels bite several ND students 
~)John Me Grath StaffReporter 

In the last few weeks, several students have been bitten by the seemingly innocent squirrels that inhabit areas of the Notre Dame campus. 
Dr. Robert Thompson, Uni­versity physician, estunated that approximately five or six students have been treated at the infirmary in recent weeks for such wounds. 
"Most of the bites have resulted from some type of invitation on the part of the students in which the squirrels are coming up close to be fed," Thompson commented. 
He discounted fears that some of the bites may have been inflicted by rabid squirrels, explainins, "I've checked with the public health departments locally and they don't seem to be concerned. That type of disease (rabies) hasn't been present in that type of animal (squirrel) for years in this part of the country. 
Thompson added, however, that two victims have chosen to undergo rabies treatment as a precautionary measure. 
"Some people, depending on their fear of rabies, or for special medical reasons decide that they need special treatment,'' Thompson explained. 
Such treatment consists of daily injections of srecial vac­cines for a duration o 14 days. 
Thompson said that his staff had not noticed any particular area in which the squirrels attacks have been concentrated, but cautioned all students to be aware of the potential dangers involved in feeding the creatures, wherever they may be.

CBS said the cancellation came one day after it received a call from a secretary to presidential adviser Gerald Rafshoon. 
The network said the secretary called and said Rafshoon was "very diappointed" and "quite upset'' that the president's brother was to be questioned on the program. But CBS quoted Rafshoon as saying he had done nothing to try to get Carter to cancel. 
A White House aide, who asked not to be identified, said Rafshoon was ''just astounded 'Face the Nation' would be interested in Billy. He's hardly a national figure."

Jackson said he believed an Iranian government under Aya­tollah Ruhollah Khomeini would virtually dry up oil supplies from Iran for the U.S. and Its Western allies. 
He said gasoline rationing would not be necessary if the loss of foreign oil is restricted to Iranian sources, but would be needed if 9.5 million barrels a day imported from Saudi Arabia also are interrupted. 
Jackson .descri~ed the .supply from Saudi Arabia and Its oil-producing neighbors as vulner­able to interdiction by the Pales­tine Liberation Organization, which he characterized as having "a real tie to the Khomeini government."

State Department spokesman Kenneth Brown said the 7,000 .Americans in Iran were safe "to the best of our knowledge.'' 
In Marrakech, Morocco, sources close to Shah Mohhamad Reza Pahlavi, 59, said he was in a state of "anguished expectation" as he followed events from his ''vaca­tion" seclusion there. He left Iran in mid-] anuary. The sources said he was following the events through Iran's U.S. and Euro­pean embassies. 
In a radio and television add­ress, Bazargan said he was pleased to hear "the army will not interfere in political affairs and that they have supported the will of the people." 
The military decision to follow "the will of·the people" came after two days ofbloody rioting in which many soldiers joined the opposition, exploding the notion that the 430,000-man armed forces were united behind the government. 
''The armed forces with all its power supports the wishes of the people," said a statement broad· cast by Iranian state radio.

Response: 'Why WSND?' 
Mark Ferron's coocemed and sincerelr,-swed remarb about WSND-AM ("Why WSND ') were apprcciatcd and cattfully considered by all of us at W'SND. However, Mr. Ferron has some colossal. misconceptions about WSND AM and FM, and their roles on this campus. Perhaps before using the Observer, Mr. Ferron ~ht have seen fit to dO a bit ofresearch on some ofhis facts that are easily explained. Unfortunately his experience with WSND is limited to a rather tentative involvement in our newsroom last year when WSND was not exacdy a ship-shape or~on. His program· ming criticisms are liased upon questionable sources, since he admittedly rarely listens to WSND, nor do his friends. In any case, we are anxious to answer Mr. Ferron's queries. 
WSND realizes (and has realiied for years) its occasional audio problems. The cost to repair the worn-down transmitters that we have in most every dorm is lremetu/oMS. However, replacinJ the old transmitters is AM's Eriority. Smce Mr. Ferron lives in flanner r and Grace have the worst transmitters all dorms) he ~ht be interested to know that we purchased a new tranSmitter for flanner last semester; but due to conflicts with the manufacturer it has not been installed. Hopefully it soon shall be. As far as we know, most Other dorms only occasionally have problems tuning in WSND. 
Secondly, the Administration docs not have the responsibility to automatically produce funds to pay for $12,000 worth of tranSmitters. We do receive some funds every year· for ~ital purchases from the University but the tranSmltter project is necessarily going to be a slow process. Let me emphasize though that Aanner and Grace are our #1 priority. 
I am afraid Mr. Ferron's solutions to the AM audio problems beyond purchasing new tranS· miners are somewhat uninformed. No, AM cannot increase its power because it is not broadcast through aic waves, but through lines connected to each dorm. No, AM cannot go stereo by acing cable because you are talking about bigger bucks than you can unagine. No, AM is not going to switch places with FM. Mr. Ferron ciUs FM "super inarket Muzak" and implies that it too is there to serve only students. WSND-FM serves the public around the South Bend community, and funhermore, Bach, Beethoven and Brahms should not be confused with a Muzak 'rersion of''Precious and Few" or "Raindrops are Falling on My Head." 
The most unfair statement made by Mr. Ferron concerns WSND-AM's programming. In case he had not noticed, AM underwent a very important (and successful) clwlge in format this year. There is a good balance of requests, golds, and up and coming songs--not the bubble gum rock heard on WRBR. Jim Dorgat!, the! AM Program Director, had brought AM !11' from being unoipnized, noisy and demoralized to becoming--and I say this without hesitation--the best niCk radio station in town. 
Mr. Ferron cites "Radio Fr.ee Notre Dame" as the only special program for students on WSND. He seems to have overlooked ''SnM~Irina of Sports," "Studio).,'' "Album Hour," r.S~ld Album ~." 'Rock in Retrospect,'' "Disco," "Blast from the Past," and "SOul Hour," ... PWS full coverage of Mardi Gras, An Tostal events, all football, basketball and hockey games and other special remotes. 
We feel badl~that despite our efforts, Mr. Ferron, and per s others, are unaware of the improvement WS has made this year. WSND is qwte popular with underclassmen who have never known any other WSND. Howc:ver, we realize that it will take time and money to rc..-familiarize the rest ofthe campus with our radio station. Why WSND? . .. because talented and hard-working people are making it the station that the students need and deserve.

Suggestions for winter safety 
Dear. Et/ilor: 

This letter is in reacnon to what is an ever-present problem around the Notre Dame ~us during the winter--snow and tee. 
Footiiig on campus pathways is treacherous and especially dan­gerous as the weather warms up. Snow melts during the height of the afternoon and freezes again in the evening, leaving a thin sheet of dangerously slick ice over the snow. In the past several days footing on the paths has been worse than usual and many people (myself included) have slipped and fallen, usually with no serious injuries, except to our pride! 
I ask the groundskeepers, who do an excellent job of clearing snow, to watch for ice at major walkway intersections on campus. Two dangerous places are the sidewalks in front of the dining halls and the area where the siaewalks intersect in front of Dillon Hall on the way to South dining hall. The section of road whicli students must cross on their way from the Farley end of the North dining hall. to Flanner and Grace hall~ is especially dangerous because of the-traffic, where a misstep could be fatal. 
Obviously, the entire campus cannot be sanded every day, but certain especially busy and dan­gerous areas could be checked and sanded every day to reduce the potential for serious injury. These safety precautions will help to ensure that we will all be survivors of the winter of '79!

WSND-FM 
not a 1Muzak' 
Dear Editor: 

Mark Ferron's article "Why WSND?" often seemed to be quite reasonable in its approach and statements. I have never lived on campus, so I have never _had the opportunity to hear WSND-AM. Ifhis description of the Radio Free Notre Dame talk show is accurate, then the per­sons responsible should apolo­gize to the Notre Dame commun­Ity. 
However, a basic error in the article must not go unanswered. WSND-FM is not a "super market Muzak'' station. Either Mr. Ferron is unacquainted with the pro_gra.mming at WSND-FM or he does not know the differ­ence between classical music and Muzak. Since he docs mention WSND-FM's ''classical music orientation" I feel the problem must be that he docs not know the meaning of classical music or the term "Muzak." 
Muzak is created for back­ground sound in stores, banks, doctor's waiting rooms, etc., and can be found in a station such as WWJY-FM (South Bend). The xery p~e of Muzak (in its non-conflicting sound) is to fade into the background. 
"Classical music" (a very inaccurate term) is the personal expression of the artist or com­poser, arid it must be listened to closely ifit is to be understood. A symphony by Beethoven, an opera by Verdi, or an oratorio by Bach is not now, never has been, and never will be Muzak. 
In addition, the AM station should not change places with the FM station be<:ause there is little need for another "Rock station" on local airwaves. WSND-FM serves the community. of 
Michiana (South Bend, Elkhart, Mishawaka, etc.) as well as the students of the· University of Notre Dame. This means that there are only two local stations which broadca-st classical music-­WAUS-FM (Berrien Springs, Michigan( and WSND-FM.

Farley commends Ca"oll 
Dear Editor: 
Farley Hall would like to commend Carroll Hall ~or their initiative in abolishing parietals. We support the philosophy behind their actions but do not believe that parietals is the central issue. 
After input from the entire hall, the general consensus is that the true concern is lack of student representation and the need for an effective channel of communication. This channel would provide input for decisions affecting student life not in the form ofsuggestion but rather throue:h voting power. We believe that the administration does not fullyacknowledge the student body as adults fully capable of maklng responsible decisions. 
Farley recognizes the existence ofgeneral student disconte~t and would like to direct it towards constructive efforts to obtam the right to work with the administration in formulating policies concerning the Notre Dame community. 
We sincerely hope that the student body will acquaint themselves with the issues and join us in our effort to achieve these goals. We need a vocal representation of our rights and doubts, and most importantly, we need a leader. We appeal to the student government to provide this leadership to represent the obvious widespread discontent and disillusionment of the students. Results Will come only through a united effort from all quarters. 
Let's see some effort to plan realistic courses ofaction!! Farlej Hall Cotm&il

NEW DEl-ill, India (AP)­Iulfikar Ali Bhutto, the deposed Pakistani prime minister await­ing execution in his homeland, draws parallels between himself and former President Richard M. Nixon in an emotion-charged statement smuggled from his death-row cell. He warns that Pakistan's future depends upon his survival. 
"I was born to make a nation, to serve a people," wrote the condemned Bhutto. "I was not born to wither away in a death cell.'' 
The statement, 80,000 works in all, was addressed to the Pakis­tan Supreme Court and smuggled from Bhutto's cell in Rawalpmdi Central Jail. It was published in book form by Vikas Publishing House here after the military government in Pakistan blocked Its release. 
Entitled, ''If I Am Assassi­nated," the book reveals much of the 51-year-old Bhutto's brash style, personal philosophy, and fervent if not excessive belief in his own importance, said several political observers. 
"It's not a masterpiece, but it's pure Bhutto," commented a former close colleague, who had read a mimeograJ?hed copy that had been circulaung secretly in 
Alvin Rubin to attend lectures 
The Honorable Alvin B. Rubin, judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, ha.-; been named Distinguished Judicial Visitor of the Thomas J. and Alberta White Center for Law at Notre Dame and will attend a series of Law School talks this week. 
Rubin will participate in sever­al classes where he will discuss ethics in the negotiating process with White Scholars, faculty and other students. He will address a student-faculty forum at 12:15 
p.m. today in the Law School Lounge focusing on the ability of our judicial institutions to res­pond to·the needs of justice in our contemporary society. 
A 1942 law graduate of Louisi­ana State University, Rubin prac­ticed law for several years before being named U.S. District Court Judge for Eastern Louisiana in 1966, and moved to the Appeals Court in 1977. 
He is a visiting lecturer at Louisiana State University and serves as a member of the visiting committee for law schools at the Universities of Chicago, Miami and Harvard. 

Deposed Pakistani prime m.inister awaits execution after conviction 
Islamabad, Pakistan's capital. following charges of election 
The former minister's chances 
of !eSCaping the gallows are slim 
since Pakistan's Supreme Court 
last Tuesday confirmed in a 
4-to-3 decision his 1978 murder­
conspiracy conviciton by a lower 
court. He was convicted or 
ordering the 1974 murder of a 
political rival. 
Four security officers convicted in the case also are condemned to die. Bhutto's main hope is executive clemency in response to appeals sent by President Carter, Soviet President Leonid I. Brezhnev, U.N. Secretary­General Kurt Waldheim, Pope 
John Paul II and Chinese Com­
munist Party Chairman Hua Kuo­
feng, among others. 
Without a clemency or a stay, Bhutto could be hanged as early as Wednesday or Thursday, ac­cording to his lawyer, Yahya Bakhtiar. 
The book repeat~ Bhutto's earlier denials of the murder charges and that he rigged the 1977 general elections. Riots 
Farmers continue strike 
EL CENlRO, Calif. (AP) ­United Farm Workers leader Cesar Chavez, a rallying figure for a decade's crop of social change, is betting heavily in a high-stakes labor game that is heating up with increased vio­lence. 
The raised ante involves 4,200 farm workers on strike in Cali­fornia and Arizona since Jan. 19, bringing the lettuce harvest to a wilting halt, jeopardizing about 40 percent of the nation's winter crop and nudging supermarket prices higher each week. 
Growers, however, call the strike Chavez' "last gasp" and have launched a high-powered public relations campaign in an effort to win their fight. They also have let about $3 million of their highly perishable crop rot in the fields rather than give in to what some term "exorbitant" UFW demands. 
If successful, the walkout could raise the $3.70 minimum wage by 40 percent and firmly establish the UFW as a tough union with the muscle to back its demands. But UFW officials admit they must win a substantial part of those demands or risk losing their credibility. 
A top aide to Chavez, Marc Grossman, said the union is negotiating simultaneously with 28 vegetable growers who repre­sent the bulk of the union's contracts in the rich Imperial Valley, a once-barren expanse of desert in southeast California that has flowered into one of the nation's richest agricultural areas.

fraud lea to his overthrow. The· 
book discloses some of Bhutto' s 
hitherto concealed policy aims. 
While prime ffilruster, he said a French-built nuclear reproces­sing plant ordered by his govern­ment would serve only peaceful uses. But in his book, Bhutto said the plant was to help Moslem Pakistan· break the "Christian-Jewish-Hindu" mon­oply on nuclear arms capability. 
"We were on the threshold of full nuclear capability when I left the government to come to theis death cell,'' Bhutto claimed. The French government stalled the deal after Bhutto was overthrown in a bloodless coup by Gen. Zia ui-Haq on July 5, 1977. 
"A coup d'etat is an un­r.Jeasant experience," he wrote. 
'It leaves behind a dreadful legacy." Bhutto drew a parallel between himself and Nixon, claiming both were· "ousted" because the "intelligence com­munity'' of both countries turned against them. 
Chavez, 50, began working the 
fieids when he was 10 years old. 
Nearly three decades later, in 
1965, he launched the first of a 
series of strike.boycotts in Cali­
fornia that propelled him to 
international prominence. 
"I think this is Chavez' last 
gasp,'' said growers spokesman 
Ron Hall on Friday. "The union 
has lost three decertification 
elections in the last few months 
and feels it needs to do some­
thifiE dramatic.'' 
That feeling has charged the strike with a current of urgency ­and violence -reminiscent of Chavez' struggles with growers in the 1960s as he tried to establish his union in an industry largely untouched by labor groups. One person has been killed and 20 injured in two major outbreaks, while scattered vio­lence has been reported almost dail . . 
{#w officials maintain the wage raise is needed to catch up with other, more establishea unions whose scales are two or three times higher. Growers insist they won't exceed Presi­dent Carter's voluntary 7 percent wage hike ceiling. 
Both sides agree the outcome of this struggle will set a pattern for farm labor wages nationwide. 
Meantime, consumers are paying the price. 
As lettuce supplies have dwindled, prices have more than doubled, from 39 cents a head two weeks ago to as high as 89 cents.

December were instrumental in spurring UG.A to victory. 
''I als<:> believe that Notre Dame is a _ftfth of a step slow,'' he said. 
McGUite sta~ed that th~ game was ~tensely physical, marked by some outstanding defensive play. There was very little pure excellent _offensive b~ketball m the ~arne," he noted. . 
Acc?rding to McGUite, the key pomt of the game occurred m the last mmute wh~n Notre Dame was unable to obtain a desired timeout / while David Gr:eenwood went down the court for the layur.. 
McGuire expressed l1e had no doubt that Notre Dame will go to the NCA.A tournament but in order to reach the fmal four, three things must happen: 1) there must be_ no injuries; 2) the last shot must go in; and 3) the team must be peaking at tournament time. 
McGuire believes that in the ftve games leading up to the championship, .two will be decided by three points or less. ''A coach can do everything right but the key sh~t must go in,'' he said. 
Wh~n questioned about ~s working relat~onship will Billy Packer, McGUite stated that he enJoys working with Packer. "We never disagree unless it is legitimate," he emphasized, "we do not pum.P it up just for the'cameras." McGuire said that Packer is a techniCian "he deals with the clinical-oriented sport fan, whereas I am mor~ interested in ~e human aspect of the game.'' · 
In reply to this same question, McGuire noted that the Big Ten is the better conference in college basketball. "It varies from year to year, but I feel the Big Ten is the leader this year. " 
Responding to a question concerning the pressure on coaches whose teams are near the top, McGuire pointed out that there is a tremendous wearing down on coaches during the season. 
He stated that the press accounts for a significant amount of this pressure. "A coach must always be on his toes in handling the news theatre and a 1major amount of his time is taken up by the news theatre." 
Commenting on his coaching role at Marquette, McGuire admitted that his as~istant coaches played a major role in the program, yet he never felt It was necessary to prove he was the head man. 
Concerning the upcoming poll, McGuire believes that Indiana State should be ranked number one. ''The Missourri Valley Conference is not the best conference in the country but it is extremely difficult to win 22 games without a defeat anywhere. In addition, Indiana State has the best player in the country in the person of Larry Bird.'' 
As the session came to an end, McGuire remarked that he has encountered no student body that has a greater impact on a home game than the Notre Dame student body.

NEW YORK (AP) -Public support for a new SALT union is now the highest it has been in three years, an Associated Press­NBC News poll shows. 
The increased backing for a new treaty limiting nuclear wea­pons is based on the growing perception that such a pact will enhance U.S. security and that it will reduce the chances of a nuclear holocaust. 
The burgeoning support for a new pact comes as Soviet and American negotiators work out the details of a new treaty, although no date has been set for signing a new agreement. 
Eighty-one percent of those interviewed across the country Feb. 5 and 6 said they favor a new SALT treaty. That is six points higher than the backing found in the December AP-NBC news poll and 11 points higher than the November level. 
And it is the highest level of support since the question was ftrst asked in 1976. 
This month, 14 percent oppos­ed a new pact and 5 percent were nofsure. In tandem with the rise in support for a new treaty, the public increasingly sees a SALT pact as strengtherili_l~ U.S. secur­
Ity, not weakening It,  as  critics  
say.  
Fifty-seven  percent  of  those  

questioned satd the new agree­ment would boost this country's security -up six points from the December survey and 12 points from a June AP-NBC news poll. Twenty-seven percent took the view it would weaken the U.S. military position. Sixteen per­cent of the 1,600 adults inter­viewed by telephone were uncer­tain.

mazoo the chance they needed to take the lead for the remainder of the game. SMC's 14 fouls in the ftrst half· put Kalamazoo in the bonus siruation early enabling the Cougars to edge ahead at halftime, 39-38. 
Foul trouble again plagued the Belles during the second half and Kalamazoo took advantage of many three-point plays. Saint Mary's, however, was less successful at the free throw line. 
A full-court press and a switch to a 1-3-1 zone defense by SMC in the second half hurt rather than helped the team. The quick Cougars had no trouble dribbling past the SMC press to score on numerous fast breaks before the SMC defense could set up. And Karen Caywood and Connie Oberlin for Kalamazoo took advanta~ of the weak SMC zone to combme for 16 points under the basket. 
But excellent outside shooting by Nowalk, Meg Holland and Diane Bury and fme assists by guardJean Myler kept SMC no more than two baskets behind the Cougars until 9:55 remaining in the game. 
Kalamazoo called a time out and it was a different team that emerged from the huddle. Kalamazoo strongly dominated both the offensive and defensive rebounding and committed few rurnovers. 
The Cou~ars took the lead for good with stx unanswered points and continued to outscore the Belles with another four straight baskets in the final minutes ofthe game. !'Jowalk kept _pump~g in the {X>lnts for Saint Mary's fmishing with 22 points, but the clock ran out with Kalamazoo on top, 93-74.

(continuedfrom page 12] 
shooting performance (31 percent in the second half and 39 percent overall) was more an indication of being cold than being defensed. "When a team like ours shoots 39 percent, you know we're just not playing our game. We missed some easy shots. But I thought our defense did a great job." 
Hamilton toppea all scorers with 12 points while Greenwood dropped in 11. Vandeweghe grabbed ten rebounds while Ua..A outrebounded the Irish 
39-35. 
Kelly Tripucka and Tracy Jack­son led the Irish with 11 points each on 8-21 from the floor. OnJy Flowers and Hamilton hit better than half of their shots. 
Notre Dame's record drops to 16-3 while the Bruins move up to 18-3 on the season and are a strong contender for the number one national ranking this week.

with a shorthanded goal he scored with Mark Pavdich on his back from the blue line on. The two shorthanded goals the Irish got on the weekend were indica­tive of the outstanding penalty killing of Humphreys and Michalek as well as of Brian Burke and Kevin Nagurski all weekend long. 
But UMD struck back midway through the period, and capped the comeback with a goal with just five seconds showmg for a 4-3 lead heading into the third period. It was a reversal of roles from the previous night. 
This time, thou·gh, the never­say-die attitude that made Notre Dame oneof the top teams in the country tor the ftrst half of the year came shining through once again. Rothsr~in notched his second goal of the night to even things u_p 4-4 at 2:03 and line­mate J effPerry and captain Steve Schneider put the Irish on top 6-4 with tallies at 5:01 and 14: 19. 
UMD came storming back just 30 seconds later on a goal by Bruce Olson, and John Harring­ton sent the game into overtime at 16:45. No one from the capacity crowd of 5,681 had budged, and the Bulldogs cer­tainly appeared to have the momentum headin~ into the extra 10 minute sess1on. 
But the Irish decided it 1:16 into the overtime with the only shot on goal of the period. Wdtzin sent a centering pass to Humphreys out near the front of 
   Sweep 
the net, and Humphreys quickly rerurned it to Weltzin. The junior center stuffed it by from the left of Johnson, and he nearly drowned in the flood of blue Irish jerseys that swarmed the ice in jubilation. 
But thts past weekend was only the start of Notre Dame's stretch drive to the playoffs. The Irish face three more crucial series and their last home series comes this Friday and Saturday when second place Minnesota invades the ACC. It will mark the annual Parents' Weekend for the Irish players, and could be the last time they play on home ice this year. A sellout crowd is expected, and you can bet Notre Dame will be out to make sure it won't be its last appearance at the ACC.

UCLA Bruins stop Notre Dame short of achieving 'grand slam' 
by Ray 0 'Brien Sports Editor 

While the action between the beginning and the end of Sunday's Notre Dame-UCLA clash dtdn't develop as expected, the margin between the winner and loser was once again very close as the Bruins outdefensed the Irish 56-52. 
Notre Dame took the game's biggest lead, scoring seven un­
-answered points at the outset before thts usually exciting matchup turned into one of the more boring nationally televised college basketball games of the year. The Bruins got back in the games as super-guards, Brad Holland and Roy Hamilton led an eight point surge to· tie the game at 12-12 before both teams start­ed missing. A sluggish UCLA team, who had to go to overtime to beat USC on Friday night, had the shooting blues first as none of the Bruin starters could find the range for the first 14 minutes. Notre Dame dido' t fair much better as turnovers and missed layups kept the UCLA team from going to the locker room with a double-digit deficit. All of the Irish scorers got in the act as Tripucka's five first half points topped the home team. Hamilton and Varideweghe led all scorers with six markers after twenty minutes as Notre Dame stumbled to a 28-25 halftime lead. 
In a haphazard first stanza, the Irish shot 48 percent to their guests' 44 percent. Tough defenses caused nine turnovers on both teams part. 
If the first half looked sloppy, things were only to get worse, withNotre Dame leading the way in missed chip shots. 
Tripucka hit an 18 footer to open up a 30-25 lead at the start of the second half, but this was not a sign of what was to come as Wilkes brought UCLA back two minutes later with six straight points to tie the score at 40-40. 
The pace of the games was slowed despite missed shots as b~t~ teams ~ot. int? foul trouble hittmg die !unit wtth almost 12 minutes still remaining in the contest. Notre Dame was charged with six straight fouls during one UCLA possession. -During the long stretch of fouls, the Irish went six minutes without scoring a point and made it eight minutes without a field goal. Things only' got worse for Digger Phelps· crew as they scored only two field goals be­tween the 17:31 and 3:05 mark" as the ball seemed to get bigger and the hole smaller. 
Gary Cunningham's crew gra­ciously kept Notre Dame in the game with assorted missed shots and turnovers but found them­selves ahead 48-42 thanks to a tough man-to-man defense and solid rebounding. 
Jackson connected on a 15 footer with three minutes left 

sending desperate Irish fans into pandemonium as their team nar­rowed the lead to 50-46. 
From there the "game of all games'' can1e down to the cool play of no-name UCLA freshman, Tyren Naulls. Naulls sank four free throws in one-and-one situa­tions that James Wilkes had missed the year before to cost the Bruins the game. Naulls last four points finished the scoring at 56-52. 
A subdued Naulls would not overplay his last second heroics after the game commenting, ''You go up there and figure you have a 50-50 chance. Luck was just on my side. I had never been in a situation like that before and I didn't want them to foul me. I dido' t like the pressure and I'm just glad its over." ­
However, Naulls tean1ffiates indicated that this freshman was not a goo~ p~~son to _foul. ''Ty _is a cocky kid, explamed Hamil­ton. "We never said anything to him. We all knew he would sink them.'' 
Holland explained his team's slow start, "We weren't patient on offense at first. We decided we had to get the ball inside more. 
The senior All-American con­tinued, "We were a little tired and just came out cold. But we pride ourselves on a tough man­to-man defense and that kept us in the game.'' 
Phelps felt that his teams poor

Saint Mary's Belles lose to'· Kalamazoo College, 93-74 
by Debbie Dahrling Women Sports Editor 

The Saint Mary's basketball team was handed another loss Saturday as a second-half scoring drive by Kalamazoo Valley Community College shut down the Belles, 93-74. 
Scoring was sluggish at the onset of the game due to many turnovers. Kalamazoo's Cathy Heator broke the ice with a basket from the outside. which was the beginning of her domi­nance on the court. Heator went on to score 26 points in the game, 24 from the field and two from the line. 
The Belles' offense got under way with a .15-foot jumper by guard Maureen 0'Brien and the scoring was back-to-back for-the ftrst half. The teams appeared to be evenly matched with fme shooting by SMC forwards Nancy Nowalk and Martha Kelly and the Cougar's He a tor and Lori Schneider. 
But the Belles' recurrent problem with fouls gave Kala­

Irish icers sweep 7-3, 7-6 
by Brian Beglane Sports'Wn"ter 

DULUTH, Minn. -The Notre Dame hockey team could not have picked a better time to come up with its best two-game per­formance of the second half of the now dwindling Western Col­legiate Hockey Ass.ociation season. 
There were several factors involved. The Irish had dropped six of their last 10 league games heading into the weekend, and had not been able to string together two solid games in a row. They were in ftfth place, 
and fighting for home ice as they began the stretch drive towards the playoffs. And they had not swept on the road all year, with six of their last eight games co_ming on the road. 
But Notre Dame responded to all the pressure by sweeping the hottest team in the WCHA, Minnesota-Duluth, in enemy territory with a solid 7-3 victory Friday and a 7-6 overtime win Saturday at the Duluth Arena. The Bulldogs had been tied for second with Minnesota before the weekend and were ranked no. one in the country the last two weeks, rio less. 
Notre Dame took care of the the latter -ranking, however, while improvin~ its league record to 15-10-1 and Its overall mark to 16-13-1. More importantly, 
. though, the Irish took advantage of sweeps of Wisconsin and Michigan Tech to move from ftfth place in the WCHA to a tie for third with UiviD. ''Our performance Friday ni~ht was our best since beating Wtsconsin in early December," 
said lnsh coach Lefty Smith, "And getting four points on the road against a team that was as hot as Duluth and that was ranked no. one in the country makes it that much better. 
"We showed balanced scoring throughout the series, and Friday night I thought we did a great job throughout the lineup. It was just a total team victory, an excellent job by everyone." 
Duluth came out strong in the opening minutes of the ftrst period, though, and jumped ahead 1-0 on a power play goal by Bill Oleksuk. But John Friedman and Greg Meredith answered back with two goals in five minutes, Meredith's goal coming 
on a rebound shot at 9:36, to give 
the Irish a 2-1 lead after one 
period. 
The Bulldogs started out strongly in the second period, and tied it when Irish goalie Dave Laurion lost sight of a loose puck near the net and Mark Pavelich put it by at 5:10. But Tom Michalek turned back the tide for the Irish at 11 :2S with an unas­sisted shorthanded goal after some nifty forechecking. Then John Harrington took an errant pass by the Irish defense in the slot and beat a helpless Laurion at 17:08 to even things up for the last time for the Bulldogs, 3-3. 
But the key goal come with just 11 seconds remaining in the period. Irish defenseman John Schmidt intercepted a pass at his blueline and skated to mid-ice, where he put a wrist shot by UMD goalie Bill Perk!, who played with a 102 degree fever, for a 4-3 lead Notre Dame would never lose. 
Jeff Brownschidle continued the pressure with a goal just 41 seconds into the third for a 5-3 lead, and Ted Weltzin and Jeff Logan closed out the scoring midway through the period. Perk! stopped 31 Irish shots while Laurion made 23 saves. 
Coming into the game, UMD had lost only once in 15 contests. The Bulldogs have never finished better than fifth in 13 seasons in the WCHA, ·and with their recent play, the whole city of Duluth has nearly gone hockey crazy. Local businessmen have come out with a "Triumphant Towel" (a Ia Pittsburgh Steelers ''Terrible Towel") and UMD "Puppy Love'' buttons can be seen on almost all of the more than 5,000 fans at each game. Losing 7-3 Friday was hard for them to swallow, and losing the next night in overtime proved even tougher to digest.

Perk! was too weak to go in the nets for UMD Saturday night, and Jeff Johnson got the nod for the Bulldogs. SlDlth stayed with Laurion again, and the freshman netminder responded with a superb performance, making 34 saves, 13 in the final period. His outstanding play made up for several Irish defensive lapses in the slot and kept the Irish in the game. 
Bill Rothstein, playing head to head against older brother John of UMD, gave the Irish a quick 1-0 lead at 3:08 off a nice setup from Dave Poulin. Oleksuk and Logan then exchanged power play goals for a 2-1 Irish lead after one. 
Kevin Humphreys increased the advantage to 3-1 just 50 seconds into the middle oeriod
