Shange initiates Literary Festival 
By CHRISTOPHER RYAN 
News Staff 
"I am compelled to write because it's in my genes," said Ntozake Shange, a black writer and the first of the six literary figures to be featured during this week's Sophomore Literary Festival. 
The writer also told last night's audience at Washing­ton Hall, ''I'm not searching for why I write, it just 
comes to me." 
After reading some of her works last night, many in the audience would have to agree that her talent is purely natural and certainly something that "just · comes" to her. for the entire audience seemed to be mesmerized by the portions of her works that she read for over an hour. 
The works that she read. mostly poems, engrossed the audience not necessarily because of their style or form. but more because ofher feelings about the black's status in the United States and around the world. Her poetry revealed the many injustices that blacks, par­ticularly black women, must bear and suffer in everyday life. A dominating tone ofanger and rage over the plight of blacks around the globe was the prevailing message that Shange successfully got across to her audience. 
It is said that any writer who reads their works before an audience is capable of bringing out an added dimen­sion for the audience toward both experiencing and un­derstanding the work. Standing alone behind a simple blue podium, Shange proved to be an entertaining per­former, as she successfully made her written words come alive for her audience. Making use of an ex­pressive tone of voice, as well as hand gestures and fu­cial expressions, the writer brought forth her poetry more vividly and with added meaning. 

Shange read excerpts from some of her well-known published works, including poetry from her most popular workFor Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide/ When the Rainbow is Enuf , a collection of poems exploring the everyday trials of black women.

The United States government and the Palestinian Liberation Or­ganization held unofficial negotia­tions between August 1981 and May 1982,The New York Times reported last week, and John Edwin Mroz, a 1970 Notre Dame graduate, served as the mediator for these undis­closed talks. 
From 1975 to 1981. Mroz was ex­ecutive vice president and director ofMiddle East studies at the Interna­tional Peace Academy. It was in this capacity that Mroz wrote the book Beyond Securiry which consists of private opinions ofvarious Arab and Israeli officials about the Middle East conflict. Mroz compiled the in­formation during various trips to the area. 
In his book, Mroz concludes among other things that peacemak­ing efforts are hindered greatly by "publicly enunciated demands to an 
This includes Israeli demands that its right to exist be recognized by the PLO before talks can be opened between the two groups. 
This "recognition" of Israel is precisely what Mroz was trying to obtain from the Palestinians. 
In an interview with The New York Times, Mroz said "Ifl could get Arab recognition of Israel, there's nothing I could do that would be more important in my life." 
Father Robert Griffin. University chaplain, remembers Mroz when he was at Notre Dame, and recalls him as a "very pleasant and open young man" and "a natural politician." 
Griffin said Mroz was also very ambitious and interested in doing good in his life. According to Griffin, Mroz probably had John F. Ken­nedy's saying '"Ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you

Marine base labeled vulnerable to terrorists 
Associated Press 
WILMINGTON, N.C. -Camp Lejeune, the North Carolina home base of the U.S. Marine contingent offthe coast of Lebanon, is virt ually unprotected against the kind of ter­rorist attack that killed 241 troops in Beirut, a newspaper report says. 
The Wilmington Morning Star said its reporters entered the base without passes through gates routinely open to traffic. The repor­ters, driving two vans laden with empty boxes to simulate explosives, were unchallenged entering the base or while on it, the newspaper said. 
To show how easily the base can be infiltrated by outsiders, the reporters taped letters to the un­derside of the toilet tank top in a bathroom in the home of a senior 2nd Division officer and atop a lock­er in the women's toilet on the second floor of 2nd Division head­Siuarters. .· Maj. Gen. Alfred M. Gray Jr., com­tnander of the 2nd Division from which the Marine peacekeeping force was chosen, said the Marines were aware of the newspaper's in­
vestigation but decided to let it proceed as a counterterrorism ex­ercise. 
"We were aware of the plan from the early stages," he said, adding that the information came from military intelligence as well as FBI, state and local law enforcement officials. Gray said there are security measures on the base which are not apparent and that the Marines did not want to in­vest the time, money and manpower to counter something that was not an actual threat tci the base. 
However, the newspaper quoted 
a source with the FBI in Wilmington 
as saying the bureau had no 
knowledge ofany such probe. 
The empty boxes in each of the vans could have held enough dynamite to seriously damage a building if the vans penetrated the interior, an explosives expert with the Wilmington Police Department said. 
At no time did the investigative team encounter concrete-filled bar­rels, concrete barriers, bomb­sniffing dogs or other security measures like those put into place at key Washington buildings.

Students among volunteers aiding neighborhood revitalization work 
By TIMOTHY GIANOTTI 
News Staff 
Revitalizing neighborhoods is what National Housing Services is all about, and its people are hard at work in South Bend -especially in the northeast section oftown. 
Coping with such problems as transient student residence, lower income occupants, apathetic and negligent landlords, high interest rates on home loans, government destruction of salvable houses and expansion of local institutions ­namely the St. joseph Hospital-the NHS of South Bend embarks on its sixth year ofcommunity service. 
"We are fighting an uphill battle," temporary Development Coor­dinator Margarita Howard says. Be­tween the politics and the apathy, Howard feels she is fighting a multi­fronted war. 
One problem is the lack ofmoney 
to work with. NHS is locally funded 
and operated, and the dollar is not 
always easy to find. In order to 
achieve reform in "target areas" 
(specific, bounded residential sites), 
the organization must depend on 
businesses, financial institutions and 
individuals for contributions. In 
most cases, residences of such areas 
cannot change their environment 
without help. 
Help comes in many different 

packages. One of the foremost 
means of resident assistance is low-

interest, long-term loans which provide the means for structural. cosmetic and operational renova­tion in dilapidated houses. But even when banks arc willing to loan capi­tal at a three or four percent annual rate, problems don't automatically vanish. Many people cannot afford the payments. 
The NHS counters this by offering loans to residents who cannot meet the normal commercial rates. These loans, called "revolving loans," design their repayment terms to fit the ability of the borrower to pay. Theoretically, there is no reason why any home within a target area could not be brought up to code. 
These loans also encourage some­thing which is considered essential to the revitalization ofcommunities -,.home ownership. 
Much of the present housing is rental, and the majority of landlords are not concerned with upkeep of the property, Howard says. She sees these "absentee landlords" as major contributors to the run-down state ofmany residential areas. 
Home ownership, as opposed to 
rental, is much more conducive to 
the pride of a neighborhood, says 
Hesther Herring, a student leader of 
NHS involvement. The NHS en­
deavors to spark local initiative for 
action, and cannot succeed without 
community support. Thus, neigh­
borhood pride is a needed motivat­
ing force.

Fees: There is nofee to see the University physicians or nurses. Overnight stays arefree for on-campus students, $10 per night/or 0-C students. 
Permanent figures in the community are more willing to put in time and effort than someone who is temporary or "just passing through," adds Howard. This is why Howard sees student off-campus residence as a real obstacle to her ef­forts. 
"Most of the neighborhood has a 
problem with students," she said. 
"They don't feel responsibility to the 
community." Another problem 
confronting the northeast area in 
particular is the expansion of St. Joseph's Hospital. Need for new building space and parking facilities is forcing many people out of their homes. The NHS is presently working on the relocation of these persons, but complications are an­ticipated and feared. 
"It's going to have a horrible ef. 
feet," Howard predicts. Work for 
relocation has already begun, but 
Howard notes, "Cost might be 
prohibitive." 
Despite the problems the hospital 
is causing now, Howard anticipates 
that it will eventually be a supporter 
ofthe revitalization campaign. 
The NHS is a local, autonomous 
suborganizati<in of the Neighbor­
hood Reinvestment Program, a 
public, non-profit corporation based 
in Washington, D.C. It is one of 172 
such suborganizations across the 
country. 
Any questions concerning the 
campaign for the revitalization oflo­
cal communities and opportunities 
for students to help can be 
addressed to Herring.

LeMans gets Mass 
By LAUREEN WOLFE 
News Staff 
The first of many Sunday evening Masses in the LeMans Hall chapel will he celebrated Mar. I 1 as the rc:sult of a petition signed hy ap­proximatdy 400 LeMans residents requesting a Mass there. 
"I think we should have a Mass here hccausc it is a beautiful chapel," said junior Anne Gallagher, a I..cMans resident. "For a dorm with sud1 a large population, LeMans should have its own Mass." 
Senior Bridgett Dolan, a LcMans 
R.A.. also saw the chapel as an ap­propriate setting for a Sunday Mass. "Fir~t of all, it's a beautiful chapel and very traditional. Secondly. it's ridiculous to not have a Mass in Ll·Mans when there arc SOO students in the hall. The 7 p.m. Mass at Holy Cross is crowded and we need an­other Mass." 
Convenience is another aspect Ll·Mans residents were looking for. "It will he easier since I live in thl· dorm," said freshman Suzanne Ham­mer. "I found walking all the way over to Regina Hall to be a hassle." 
According to Father Thomas Reed, Campus Ministry received the students' petition Feb. 6. Campus Ministry then discussed with stu­dent government and Regina Hall staff the possibility of moving the 10 
p.m. Regina Mass to LeMans Hall. The musicians and ministers of the Mass agreed and arc now discussing alternations of the chapel. 
More space has to be made for musicians and seating has to be rear· ranged for a community-type set­ting. Campus Ministry wants to have the chapel set appropriately for a Vatican II liturgy. Father Reed would like to have the congregation seated in such a way that everyone can see 
one another rather than staring at each others' backs. He would also like to have the seats closer to the altar. 
Saint Mary's students can now at­tend Sunday Masses in LeMans Hall chapel by the first Sunday of Lent.

Notre Dame election system needs change 
Two weeks ago, Notre Dame students went through the process of electing a student body president. Usually the elections generate little excitement among students, who soon after election day forget ali about it. This year's election had a new twist: a write-in

ticket that filled the last days of the campaign w!th controversy. 
Two students, billing themselves as The Alternative, entered the race at the final hour. Claiming they had missed the mandatory can­didates' meeting, they decided to attempt a write-in campaign. Simple, right? Just go out and encourage students to ignore the names on the ballot, and write in theirs instead. 
However, Chapin Engler and John Dardis, "The Alternative" candidates, discovered that they faced a roadblock. Because ofa clause in the election rules, only candidacies which have been d~clared by a certain date are allowed on the ballot, and then counted by election officials. Otherwise, write-in hope­fuls must plead their case before the Student Senate and hope for approval from that body. Fortunately for Engler and Dardis, they received the senate's okay. 
Even with senate approval, there remained a small problem. Any student wanting to cast a vote for Engler and Dardis had to write "The Alternative" on their ballots; nothing else would be counted in the final tal~y. A number of ballots written for ''Chapin and John" were thrown out. This seems rather questionable. Who did the election officials think the votes were for? 
In regular elections in this country, voters have the option to ignore the names on the ballot and write in the candidate of their choice. In some states, this can be a difficult process. Nevertheless, the choice remains in the hands ofthe voter. Any ballot marked with a person's name will be registered in the final tabulations. 
Not so at Notre Dame. Ifl were to walk into my dorm and write-in a vote for myself, my ballot would be disqualified. Why? My name, clearly written on the ballot, would leave little doubt as to my preference. Unfortunately, without official sanction of my candidacy, I would be out ofluck. 
The rules in place prohibiting write-in can­didates serve their purpose. This provision seeks to give structure and order to the cam­paign. Obviously, election officials don't want a write-in campaign spending more money or time allowed the other candidates. Fair enough. But if all candidates play by the rules, what difference does it make ifthey made it to some boring meeting? 
Historically, write-in candidates have little chance of victory. Their main effect is to sip­hon off votes from the other candidates. The great appeal of a write-in vote lies in the tact that the voter may register a protest; if the voter dislikes the choices on the ballot, he or she may write in any desired name. 
This process is all part ofthe crazy game we in democratic societies call elections. As the rules stand now, Notre Dame's system seems undemocratic. A student's vote will be dis­regarded if it does not select one of the "official" candidates. Thus, the voter's choice becomes extremely limited. We are told that we may only vote for a, b or c. Period. 
Notre Dame already has enough rules con­stricting our freedom. Let's at least change one rule over which the students still retain some control. 


P.O. BoxQ 
Right stuff? 

DearEditor: 
The other day it was quite amusing to read a flier promulgated to say the "ND Con­servatives for the Right Stuff." The flier, which represents 100 percent rhetoric and 0 per­cent substance, deary intended to encourage conservative students to sign up for the Mock Convention, as Glenn delegates, by equating their candidate with Ronald Reagan. 
The assertion that John Glenn is the con­servative Democratic choice, in step with 
onald Reagan, is mistaken. None of the 
emocratic candidates are their party's ver­sion of Reagan, including Glenn who has blasted the Reagan administration throughout his campaign. 
We believe the Democratic candidate who would most appeal to moderate­conservatives at Notre Dame is Reubin Askew. Askew stands apart from Glenn and other moderate to liberal Democrats on such key issues as the economy, foreign trade, abortion and defense spending. 
We woukllike to encourage all Notre Dame and Saint Mary's students to take part in the upcoming Mock Convention, and we would hope that they, when choosing a candidate to support, would focus less on rhetoric and various polls and more on the man, his record ofpublic service and his stands on the issues.

Dented car 
DearEditor: 

On Monday, Feb. 20, I went into the D-2 parking lot on the northeast part ofcampus to get my car for an errand run. When I finally found it, I was taken aback by the dents I saw on the hood. Surely I had to be dreaming, but no, I also found footprints which undoubtedly caused the damages. 
Instantly I felt anger. But within a few hours, I felt disappointment -not only because I will have to pay for the damages, but also be­cause such d~ruction probably was the result of tomfoolery on the part of a fellow Notre Dame student. 
Done in drunken stupor? Perhaps. Done as part of a childish game? Maybe. But done, nevertheless, with no conceivable reason at all. 
As a student at this great Catholic university and a member of a quite civilized society, I 
think if our moral standards do not dictate to 
us that jumping on another's car is an infringe­
ment on and abuse of rights, then common sense should tell us that such action is bound to do damage. No one enjoys finding new dents, bumps and bruises whenever he or she goes into the parking lot. I know I don't. For my blue Honda Accord sedan, this was the second time in less than four months. 
I make this humble, though probably far­fetched, request: If you have any sense of morals and were involved in this little inci­dent, I ask that you please help me pay for the damages. Otherwise, I ask that you please refrain from such nonsensical activity in the future.

Alcohol abuse 
DearEditor: 
There seems to be very little discussion about what the alcohol problem really is. Cer­tainly everyone admits there is a problem, but what is it? 
The problem, in my opinion, is this com­munity's reliance upon alcohol as a social lubricant; a social crutch if you will. The' feeling among the students is that alcohol is 
somehow necessary to life at Notre Dame. 
The reaction of the administration to the "Problem" and the reaction of the students is precisely that ... reactionary. We seek to reg­ulate a symptom, rather than attacking the root cause itself. 
As a former graduate ofthe University, I was surprised at the drinking on campus when I returned last year. Not that it o-ccurred at all, but the fervor and wild abandon with which the students attacked their alcoholic rations. 
The common attitude was that of a Haw­keye Pierce: "to drink to escape the horrors of war." Anyone who thinks that Hawkeye didn't have a problem is sadly mistaken. 
I think it is time to address the questions of social life on campus, the dearth of cultural events both at the University and in South Bend and the ways in which the students employ keggers and cocktail parties to fill the 
gap. 
Such an investigation might provide useful 
information on how we can reduce the impor­
tance of alcohol at Notre Dame without 
resorting to the "overt regulation" students 
fear.

are the anti-slavery poets who 
devoted their lives to writing about 
the harsh and unfair treatment of 
negros. Growing frustration and ten­sion between blacks and whites erupted in the race riots ofthe early 
1900s. Lynchings and vivid dis­crimination were also characteristic of this period. 
The second window ofthe display progresses into the early 1950s and 1960s, perhaps the most instrumen­tal period in the history of the black movement. During this period, black civil rights programs gained fD' ,-,. prestige and notoriety than in the previous 50 years. Courageous black history month, offers an

attire ... 
Eleanor Walker and Edward Junkins demonstrated their talents in a duet, and many others joined in the show, which, judging from the overall crowd response, was a great success. James Patterson finished it offwith excerpts from the Martin Luther King speech, "The Drum Major Instinct." The poignant message wrapped up the event nice­ly and left the audience with some points to ponder. 
Included among the speakers for the festival was the husband and wife team ofRuby Dee and Ossie Davis. Dee, an actress for many years, whose credits include major roles in "Gone are The Days," "A Raisin in the Sun," various other television roles, and many more contributions to the Arts, read poetry along with her husband who is also known throughout the film and poetry world.]ames Patterson, an active participant in the festival, praised the two for their "incredible creativity and uniqueness of presentation." 

On February IIth, a play by Notre Dame senior Sandra Hodge, "Living Memories," was presented. The play dealt basically with a young black student(played by Hodge) who was three days away from graduation at a predominantly white university: Each ofthe four scenes consisted of a flashback representing different segments of the student's life. Al­though there was a distinct message concerning the difficult challenges ofbeing black in a predominantly white school, the message, Hodge explained, goes far deeper. 
"The first scene, where a little boy expresses his griefover having no father, and the last scene in which the Baptist minister stresses the responsibility ofsharing your success, are virtually colorless ­they carry universal messages for all races. The other two scenes, one in which a black high school athlete faces the prejudice ofhis teacher, and the other in which the main character, as a freshman in the col­lege from which she eventually graduates, begins to doubt her belonging in a primarily white school, still have their universality, though they·confront the race issue head-on as well," said Hodge. 
Indeed, the theme ofHodge's play which stresses the sharing ofone's success, is what the Black Cultural Arts Festival is all about. It is a celebration ofsuccess in the black community, and the expression of the desire to share that success with others. 
Hodge's play recieved great praise from those who witnessed its debut, and may be presented again for the South Bend area. 
The final event ofthe celebration 
is the annual BCA Festival Fashion 
Show, "Silhouettes," which will be held Saturday, March 3rd, at the Monogram room. Tickets can be bought in the BCAC office for $5, or at the door for S6. Chairmen for the show are Regina Howell and Eleanor Walker. 

Anderson summed up the overall impact ofthe month-long festival when she said, "It is very unifying and it reaches past the Notre Dame community. It has so many differ~nt things to offer in education and en­tertainment and it gives the chance for students to share their talents and feelings. Since it is a celebration ofthe contribution ofblacks to our past and present, it promotes a heightened awareness ofblack culture. Too often, this awareness is not as keen as it should be."

he cho~en. Ifapartme.nt life suitf ynu, then picking the proper Ioca­ti.m should rank first on your list. Al­'ways try.to rent a second floor apartment above a Southern Califor-. nia beach bunny. This is not for so­da! reasons, though that doesn't hurt, but for economic reasons. The beach bunny will try to keep her apartment at a balmy eighty degrees and the rising heat will warm you all winter. As her monthly heating bills closely resemble the national debt, you sit cozy in your apartment and pay only for the lights and your electric typewriter. 
Similarly, check out your neigh­bors before'renting the apartment. So not be influenced by romantic en­deavors. The most important criteria when ranking the girls next door is how many meals a week they will make for you. When living off­
campus, you must perform two of cl;r most painful chores known to man: ('ating what you cook and cleaning the pans you have burned. When the neighbors provide dinner you not only get a good meal, bm you also don't have to clean up after­ward. Be polite, always bring along a small carton of milk to show the neighbors that you appreciate their generous gift. 
After moving into your new apart­ment, you will find it necessary to buy a few essentials. Learn how to create multiple uses for each household object, this saves money. For example, a smoke detector can double as a fire warning system and a timer for the oven. When the smoke detector goes off, dinner is cooked. Ifyou like your food rare, move the detector closer to the kitchen. The telephone works well to organize a messy apartment. The more impor­tant an object, the closer it should be placed to the phone. When the ob­ject is needed you can follow the cord through the dirty clothes stacked on the floor, past the pile of old newspapers, over the couch, around an uneaten sandwich and finally to the phone and the impor­tant objects. 
Mail can help make your new apartment or house feel like home. If you don't have a lot offriends, then just tell the Navy that you will graduate in May and your mailbox will be full everyday for the next six months. Another trick for drawing mail is to never pay bills on the first notice. I can guarantee that the telephone company will write again. 
These are just a few hints you 
should consider before moving off­
campus. Remember, without 
money-saving tips like the ones I 
mentioned above, you won't have 
enough money to buy beer. And that 
is why you moved off-campus in the 
first place.

pi yers saw action for Notre Dame on the course of the night, and re ardless of which players coach M ry DiStanislao put on the court, X· vier could draw no closer than ei ht points the rest of the way. The M skateers received no help from th officials either, as they had three st rters foul out in the final eight m)1utes. 
'It felt good to really be in com­m nd of the game all the way th ough," said Schueth. "We really es ablished ourselves well tonight. Tt at's something we've got to do m re consistently. It would be great if iVe could come up with two solid b~ k-to-back games with a win on to Jay against Illinois-Chicago." 
t was appropriate that the Irish h~ d a solid victory _in the final home game for veterans Mullins and 
Klauke, both of whom have made 
important contributions during 
their careers. Mullins has co­
captained the squad for the last two seasons, while Klauke is the first woman to receive an athletic scholarship at Notre Dame. 
"It felt really good.to win, and to be able to step in and contribute to the victory," said Klauke, who netted six points in the con test. ''1'-n really thankful to have had the tp· portunity to play for Notre uame. I'm going to miss playing, and I'm going to miss these people." 
Meanwhile the Irish, now 5-3 and tied for second place in the North Star Conference, must w'n their last four games in order to rinish above the .500 mark for the season. 
Tonight women face Illinois-Chicago 
CHICAGO, Ill. -The Notre Dame women's basketball team,  
fresh off a victory over Xavier University on Saturday night, will~ 
swing right back into action tonight as they travel to Chicago to 
face the Lady Flames of the University of Illinois-Chicago. 
At I 1-13, the Irish need a win as they attempt to salvage what  
has been a disappointing season. 
I 
The Flames, who are suffering through a 7·19 season this win­ter, are led by 6-0 sophomore forward-center Tracey Manuel, Illinois-Chicago's leading scorer at 18.5 points per game and its leading rebounder with an I I. 5 average. 
In addition, coach Barbara Leahy depends on junior forward Erin Maloney, who averages 9.3 points and 6. 5 rebounds p<·r con­test. Leahy also has received great play of late from freshman Linda Larson, who adds an additional 8. 5 points and 7.1 rebounds per game to the Illinois-Chicago attack. 
Leahy, in only her second season as head coach at Illinois· Chicago, is already familiar with Notre Dame. Last season, Mary DiStanislao's Irish handed the Flames an 88-61 defeat at the ACC as forward Trena Keys sparked Notre Dame with 18 points in ~ reserve role. Frontline starters Mary Beth Schueth and Ruth Kaiser added 13 points apiece in the Irish victory, while Manuel had I 7 points in a losing cause for the Flames. 
The Irish have never won at the UIC Pavilion, however, suffer­ing two defeats in the past four seasons. Notre Dame will attempt to end that streak, as well as climb within a game ofthe.500 mark, when they take to the court tonight.

thing but commit fouls in any of these formations. 
Sluby remained calm, however, and he hit II of20 attempts from the floor and eight of I2 from the line. 
"We thought we had to take (Sluby) out ofthe game," Marquette coach Rick Majerus admitted after­ward. "He's a great player; he's a great scorer. He scored on our box -he's just so confident." 
Majerus said he wanted to lay more man-to-man and box-and-one on Sluby, but his players ran into foul trouble. Three of Marquette's start­ers eventually fouled out of the game. 
Sluby owned what was perhaps the most exciting play of Saturday's game. With about 8:20 left in the game, Sluby's jumper from the foul line was blocked by Dwayne Johnson, creating a fast break for Marquette.Johnson got the ball back and went up to jam the ball home, but Sluby carne from behind him and slammed the ball into the seats in­stead. 
"He had just blocked my shot," Sluby recalled, "and I was mad be­cause I didn't ball-fake him. I just wanted to get back down and stop the play." 
By this time, the Warriors were struggling unsuccessfully to stay in the game, and they never again came closer than six to the Irish. 
The small-but-vocal ·Marquette are ...Marquette," only to be answered by the Notre Dame stu­dents, "Who cares?" 
The game was iced with 17 seconds remaining, when Donald Royal slammed home Notre Dame's 65th point of the day. Richard McCormick added a layup to end Marquette's scoring for the game at 56. 
Royal was the second-leading scorer for the Irish, with 13 points, six rebounds, and three blocked shots. He shot 67 percent (four for six) from the floor, and 71 percent (five for seven) from the foul line. 
Notre Dame coach Digger Phelps was impressed with the play of this 6-7 freshman from New Orleans, who has been starting in place ofthe injured Tim Kempton. 
"I think Donald Royal has really handled this (starting) m:ll," Phelps says. "He's been patient, and he's playing with a lot of confidence, now." 
Royal says he is now comfortable in his starting role, although he was not, at first. 
"In the beginning, when I first started, I demanded a lot from myself," Royal says. "I had to come into a groove. It took a few games for me to get settled with the game, and I feel right at home, now." 
Other leaders for the Irish were 
Scott Hicks, with nine points, and 
Ken Barlow, who had II rebounds. 
High-point man for the Warriors 

was Dwayne Johnson, with I8. 
Marotta had I0 points and II otebounds for Marquette, and Copa added II points to the losing effort. Phelps said afterward that Notre Dame's defense had been a key fac­
contingent of fans proclaimed for . tor in the second half. the last time, "We "We really kept mixing our 

defenses," the Irish coach said, "and I thought we did a better job offor­cing them to take outside shots, which gave us the long rebound situation. 
"The thing about Marquette," Phelps continued, "is that they can get hot, and that was my concern about them. No matter what defense we were playing, I was worried about their outside shooting." 
Majerus said he thinks that tur­rovers were a major cause of his team's loss. 
"We were our own worst enemy in turnovers," Majerus said. "We got the ball on the break and turned it over. In two-on-one situations, we don't take the ball to the basket." 
Majerus also attributed the loss to the Notre Dame offense, which handled the Marquette defense well. 
"We wanted to play the box," the Warrior coach said, "but they got some easy baskets off the other guys (besides Sluby in the box at the start ofthe second half. They made a nice adjustment." 
Sluby said that he had been hoping in the first half that the Irish could make that adjustment. 
"I was just hoping some of the other fellows could hit a few open jumpers and drive the gaps," the Irish swingman said. 
Phelps concluded that the game was a fitting end for Sluby's and Cecil Rucker's careers at Notre Dame. 
"I think for the seniors it was a great way to go out," Phelps said. "That's part ofthe tradition we've al­ways had here at Notre Dame. It was a big win for us." 
The Irish will conclude their regular season on the road next Saturday at Dayton.

Pardo with a shot to his glove side from right in front. 
Five minutes later, however, Dearborn's Ryan Willette took a pass from Craig Aittama, deked Irish net­minder Tim Lukenda. and flipped 
the puck  into the  net  to  put  the  
Wolves up 4-1.  
Then  at  12:53,  co-captain  Joe  

Bowie rifled a drive that bounced off Pardo's shoulder and into the goal to pull the Irish within two. 
Notre Dame continued to apply pressure, and on a powerplay at 
17:54 Tim Reilly stepped out from behind the Dearborn goal to hit Steve Ely near the top of the circle on the right wing side. Ely's blast through a screen took Pardo by surprise, and wi th just over two minutes to play, the Irish trailed by just one.. 
With 51 seconds remaining, Lukenda was lifted in favor of an ex­tra attacker. The Wolves' Joe Char­tier was then whistled for tripping at 
19:39 giving Notre Dame a six-to­four man advantage. But agressive defense by Pardo and his teammates kept the swarming Irish from capitalzing. 
"We controlled most of the play, hut tried to be too cute with the pas­sing," said Irish mentor Lefty smith. "We were looking for a special shot instead of just taking one. They capitalzed on some of our mistakes and that hurt. But it was good to see a strong comeback after being down." 
Gary Chanson's goal at 7:12 ofthe opening period was the only score in the stanza. But the Wolves came close five other times as four shots found posts behind Lukenda and an­other was blocked by a Dearborn player, who had wandered in back of Lukenda as he came out to cut the angle on a shot from the right boards. 
Doug Hervey then got the lone goal of the second period at 5:33 as he and Larry Massa found them­selves alone in front ofthe Irish goal. 
With Dearborn up 2-0, Lukenda made two fine, sliding saves in the final two minutes ofthe period, stop­ping both Massa and Hervey on breakaway attempts. 
Lukenda had 25 saves on the night. while Dearborn's Pardo had 24. 
Saturday was a different story for Notre Dame as it came out flying and wasted little time jumping into the lead. 
In fact, it took just 25 seconds for Metzler to take Bob Thebeau's pass from tht· right wing and beat Chuck Irwin to the open side and put the Irish up 1-0. 
"Tonight we were ready for them right from the start," said Parsons. "Scoring quickly then set the pace for the whole game."

Notre Dame made it 7-3 at 12:28 
when Jeff Badalich skated from the 
right corner, faked once and flipped 
the puck high over Hatt's glove. 
The second Dearborn powerplay goal of the night rounded out the evening's scoring. Willette beat Lukenda from the top of the left circle with just 2:50 left to play. 
"A key factor in tonight's success was our forechecking," said Smith. "We were playing the body more and it allowed us to get a few more turnovers inside. We also moved the puck much better; and it helped in getting a better flow going." 
"We took shots rather than looking for the perfect play," said Bowie. "Everyone skated well. It was a real team effort." 
Lukenda made 22 saves in earning the win. Irwin and Hatt teamed up to make 27 stops in a losing cause for Dearborn. 
Dearborn now stands at 17-19 on the season. Smith's 16-year career-record is now 274-261-28.

Irish scalp Warrio 
led by Sluby's 30 p 
By PHIL WOLF 
.\ports Writer 
It was a great way to finish the regular season at home. 
Senior Tom Sluby exploded for a career-high 30 points in the ACC Saturday to kad the Irish past Mar­quette, 65-56. 
"(This victory) feels really good, because I didn't want to go out losing to Marq uetle," Sluby said af­terward. "Every year this is a big game, and it was pretty important for us to win." 
The game was exciting from the opening tipoff, as the two teams traded baskets to tie the game at two, l(lur, and six. 
Joe lloward scored first for the Irish following a Marquette turnover 46 s econds into the game. The War­riors then came back with a slam dunk by Tom Copa, who received an excdlc:nt pass inside from Marc Marotta. 
The next time the Warriors had the ball, Marotta had it stripped away by Sluby, and Donald Royal hit an ea~y layup with an assist from Joe Howard. 
The Irish slowly began to slip into the lead, and they held a I5-l0 ad­vantage with 9:32 remaining in the half. Eight consecutive points for Marquette, however,

Women thrash Xa in seniors' home 
By LARRY BURKE 
Sports Writer 
It had been a long time -nearly a month -since the Notre Dame women's basketball team had won a game in a thoroughly convincing fa~­hion. The Irish did it Saturday night, holding tht· upper hand from start to finish in a 91-77 victory over the Lady Muskateers of Xavier Univer­sity. 
The win raised Notre Dame's record to I 1-I 3. and kept alive the team's hopes for a .500 sea'i<m (there are four games remaining). During a campaign in which the Irish have seen more than their share of disappointments, there wert· a lot of bright spots in Satur­day's victory. 
This wa~ particularly true of­fensively, as Notre Dame netted its third-highest team point total in its seven-year history. The team's 96 points against Marquette in the sea~on opener set the record. 
Individually, it wa~ a balanced scoring attack that paced the Irish to victory, as five players scored in doubk figures, led by center Mary Beth St·hueth's I 9 points. Forwards Trena Keys ( I 2 points) and Carrie Hates (II points), as well as guard Laura Dougherty ( I 0 points), also sparkt·d the Irish attack. 
Notre Damt· also got strong sup­port from its reserves, led by for­ward Ruth Kaiser's I I points, as well as the contributions of seniors Thertsa Mullins (one oftht·lrish co­captains) at guard, and Jenny Klauke at forward, both of whom played their t1nal gamt· at the ACC. 
Schueth and Keys scored the first two baskets of the game, enroute to a nine-point halftime lead, 41-32. Notre Dame was especially dominant on the hoards in the first half, as they outrehounded Xavier 19-6. 
"We were really concentrating on rebounding, especially in the first half," said Schueth. "That's because we had a team-low for rebounds in

Defensive line coach accused of rule violation 
By PAUL McGINN 
Executive Editor 
Bishop Harris, Notre· Dame's new defensive line coach, repor­tedly exchanged money for football tickets as an assistant coach at Louisiana State University, charged a former L.S.U. player, according to an article in yesterday's New Orleans Times­Picayune. 
Clyde Bishop, a former wide receiver at L.S.ll., reportedly told 
an NCAA board ofinquiry that Harris. in the fall of 1981, "would 
bring him cash in an envelope in return for the (player's allotted) 
game tickets." 
The story also said Bishop and another former L.S.ll. player, 
Donald Polk, "claimed that assistant coaches helped them illegal­
ly sell game tickets, in some cases for more than 30 times the face 
value." 
Contacted by The Observer last night, Harris said, "I'm not 
going to lower myselfto his level to respond to that. I don't know 
what the hell he's talking about. 
"He didn't play but one year," said Harris. "He flunked out of 
school after his first semester. I think it's just sour grapes on his 
part." 
Neither Bishop, now a member of the track team at Texas Southern University in Houston, nor Notre Dame Head Football Coach Gerry Faust, who is vacationing in Puerto Rico, could be reached for comment by The Observer. 
Dean Guidry, a senior offensive lineman at L.S.U., told the Times-Picayune that while he could not prove coaches and players did anything illegal, many things seemed questionable. 
"To tell you I've seen it or have proof would he a lie, but it's obvious it's common knowledge," Guidry said. 
Bob Brodhead, L.S.ll.'s athletic director, who began his duties June I, 1982, said "I do not know ofcar. clothes or ticket sales. If I knew it and there were evidence presented we would do some· thing about it." 
Former head football coach Jerry Stovall. who was fired by 
L.S.U. Dec. 2, 1983, also denied knowledge of the alleged ticket sales. "It's absolutely absurd," Stovall said. "In four years as head foot­ball coach at no time did any player ask for anything illegally. "At ·no time did any assistant coach suggest anything illegal immoral or unethical," Stovall added. 
Last April, the NCAA had announced it wa~ beginning a prelimi· nary investigation into the L.S.U. athletic department after it heard claims that students were receiving money and gifts from wealthy L.S.U. alumni who football players nicknamed "money 
men." 
Ifsubstantiated, the claims made by Polk and Bishop could leadour la~t game against Detroit." 

The women's ba~sk,fltlJall team ended its home season against the 
to sanctions or probation of L.S.ll. by the NCAA.
