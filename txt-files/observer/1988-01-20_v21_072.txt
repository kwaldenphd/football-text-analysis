Indictment possible for North 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -Marine Lt. Col. Oliver North failed Tues­day in a bid to have the Su­preme Court block a criminal investigation into his role in the Iran-Contra affair. 
The justices, without com­ment, refused to disturb a ruling that Attorney General Edwin Meese III properly delegated authority to indepen­dent counsel Lawrence Walsh to conduct the inquiry. 
The high-court order clears the way for Walsh to seek in­dictments against North and other key participants in a scheme to divert the proceeds of secret U.S. arms sales to Iran to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels. 
Indictments are possible in the coming weeks against North, former national secur­ity adviser John Poindexter, retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard Secord and Secord's business partner, Albert Hakim. 
Jim Wieghart, spokesman for Walsh, said, "We are pleased that any question as to the au­thority of this office to carry on its investigation of the Iran­Contra matter has now been laid to rest by the courts." 
The court asked the Reagan administration in a case from Miami for its views on an im­portan! affirmative action issue the power of local gov­ernments to require participa­tion in public works projects of businesses owned by women and minorities. 


University media unaffected by Court censorship ruling 
By JIM WINKLER Staff Reporter 
The recent Supreme Court ruling allowing high school ad­ministrators to censor ma­terial in student newspapers "won't have much impact on what we do here at Notre Dame or at other colleges in terms of publications," said Father Peter Rocca, assistant vice president for student services. 
By a 5-3 vote last week, the Court decided that the prin­cipal of Hazlewood East High School in Missouri did not vio­late students' free speech rights when he ordered that certain articles be removed from the paper prior to publica­tion. Three journalism stu­dents sued the school, but a federal trial judge ruled against them. Mter an appeals court over-turned the lower court's decision, the case came before the Supreme Court. 
At Notre Dame, the Office of Student Mfairs oversees the publication of Scholastic, the Juggler, and the Dome while monitoring the programming of both WVFI and WSND, student-run radio stations. The Observer exists in a unique re­lationship with the University, functioning as "independent" in terms of editorship and day­to-day control while using facilities in LaFortune Student Center. 
Adele Lanan, assistant direc­tor of student activities, serves as advisor to student media at Notre Dame. Lanan said, the ruling "is a low-blow for the first amendment and won't af­fect the University at all." Lanan added, "We are open to a liberal exchange of ideas," and therefore would be slow to censor any material. 
Rocca clarified this point by saying, "Publications must not run contrary to the explicit mission of Notre Dame as a Christian university. We don't necessarily have to agree with the opinions those publications print, however." Rocca added,

'CIA to resume arms airdrops' 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -President Reagan on Tuesday authorized the CIA to resume airdrops of weapons to Nicaragua's Contra rebels, as congressional oppo­nents worked to offset an ex­pected presidential lobbying blitz for an extension of mili­tary aid. 
"This is really a gut issue for the president," said Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., an opponent of the aid renewal Reagan is expected to seek for the rebels on Jan. 26. "It is his highest foreign policy objective. The administration will pull out every stop in order to win this vote." 
The House is to vote Feb. 3 on Reagan's request for an as­yet-undetermined amount of new military aid. If it approves the request, the Senate would vote the next day. 
In a speech to administration political appointees Tuesday, the president reiterated his belief that only continued mil­itary pressure on Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government will lead to peace for the region. 
"We must have the courage to stand behind those who con­tinue to put their lives on the line for democracy in Nicaragua," Reagan said. 
He said his final year in office will be "the year that the United States will strongly af­firm that democracy, not com­
munism,  is  the  future  of  
Central America."  
The  rebels  are  currently  

operating on a short-term infu­sion of humanitarian aid ap­proved before Congress left for its holiday recess, including money to pay for CIA airdrops of previously stockpiled weap­ons and ammunition. That money is expected to last through next month. 
The airdrops had been suspended for the past week be­cause of the weekend meeting in Costa Rica of the five Central American presidents who signed a peace accord Aug. 7. 
Under the law, Reagan must ask for any new military aid next week, triggering votes in Congress the following week. But the administration's task in winning new lethal supplies was made more difficult over the weekend, when Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega 
.promised to make substantial 
concessions to keep the peace 
process alive. 
Ortega vowed to lift the state of emergency in his country that has curtailed civil liberties, to hold direct talks

Activist Chisholm urges freedom remains our goal 
By LISA MONTPETIT News Staff 
Shirley Chisholm, the first black and the first female to run for president, reminded her audience that racism still remains an ugly blot on our society in her lecture "Protest, Order and Jus­tice." 
Chisholm, a U.S. congres­swoman for 14 years, spoke in Washington Hall Tuesday 
night. "Today we  are  like  
Rip  VanWinkle:  so  fast  
asleep," she said.  

"We are not our brother's keepers; we don't realize that we have a legacy to be­queath to other genera­tions," said Chisholm. 
This "slumber" outlook is only reinforced by what Chisholm called the attitude of the American people, namely "If you don't bother me, I won't bother you." 
At the same time Chis­holm said the current atti­tude of the government is di­rected at reducing the deficit rather than improv­ing the lives of thousands of Americans in this country whom she sees in need during her travels. 

"Thousands of people tonight are not eating in America. Thousands of people are homeless, and bundles are living in trucks and cars," Chisholm said. "All over America, this is happening." 
The numbers continue to grow daily and all minorities are feeling the effects, she said. Farmers are being pushed off their property be­cause of "unfair" and "cal­loused" government policies. 
Chisholm pointed out that it is important for all people to reflect on the philosophies of Martin Luther King Jr. who said, "the goal of America continues to be freedom." 
"Freedom is never volun­
tarily given by their 
oppressor--never," Chis­
holm said. 

"All of us can help by making changes in our own way," Chisholm said.

A newly recognized cholesterol has been linked with triple the usual heart disease risk, according to re­search released Tuesday. An estimated 1 in 3 Americans inherits the newly recognized form. "We have identified a new genetic trait that may predispose to heart disease risk," said Dr. Ronald Krauss of the University of Cali­fornia at Berkeley.

Sagan imagines finding proof of God 1n sc1ence 
Carl Sagan imagined something fantastic. He 
made it seem so realistic, too. And if you've 
ever dreaded the thought of having to stomach 
another proof in your lifetime, this could make 
you feel terrific. 
Imagine that it was finally scientifically 
proven that God exists. 
Imagine God left a message for us in some­
thing incredibly simple yet absolutely intrinsic 
in the fabric of the universe. 
In Sagan's book "Contact," God had been 
glorified in a multitude of worlds resplendent 
of his power and majesty, but he had chosen to 
leave his signature in a number. The author 
had left a message for intelligent, scientifically 
advanced life to discover, at a time like our 
own, when human potential threatens the awe 
previously reserved for God. 
God left his message in the number pi. 
The proof skeptics, atheists and independent 
minded college students have longed yet denied 
was finally in, without a doubt. 
There's no question this information would 
change some lives and reaffirm others. Some 
have even said that knowing there is a God 
would make religion obsolete. 
But the real wonder in this proof is not its 
affirmation of Christian values or the sacra­
ments. Christ's name was never even men­
tioned, but Sagan reaffirmed His teachings in 
a modern and realistic way -for scientists and 
theologians. The proof's appeal is the simplicity 
of its message, the majesty it attributes to God, 
and its capacity to thrill and inspire: the mes­
sage had been waiting billions of years just for 
us. 
Sagan's main character in "Contact" is a 
scientist and an agnostic dedicated to her work. 
Ellie is fascinated with science, especially extraterrestrial intelligence, and, from her ob­servatory, records the first communication ever received from space. Ellie and her col­leagues discover they are to build a machine in which they make a fantastic journey through space, leaping through black holes into a uni­verse a billion years old. 
"If God wanted us to know that he existed, why didn't he send us as unambiguous mes­sage?" she asks early in her adventures, but she soon becomes the fanatic. Her faith is the truth, but now her truth is too fantastic for anyone else to believe without proof. 
What Ellie discovers on other worlds not only reaffirms her beliefs in the relatively newborn community on Earth but also convinces her that God exists. 
"Well, eventually -let's say its in the ten-to­the-twentieth place -something happens," they told her about pi. "The randomly varying digits disappear, and for an unbelievably long time there's nothing but ones and zeros." 
"You're telling me there's a message hidden deep in the number pi?" she asked. "How can you hide a message inside pi? It's built into the fabric of the universe." 
"Exactly," the other answered. 
Why couldn't it happen? Why couldn't some­thing as mystical as the number pi hold a secret for us to discover? In the novel, the initail 
.f2Lpp{ications are now being accepted for rrlie Observer's

Assistant News Editor 
Sr~ repetitions of ones and zeros plotted on a grid formed a perfect circle. The numbers really would be endless, the message would continue forever ... 
The circle meant a number of things to Ellie. Computers today could never decode the entire sequence of infinite numbers, but Sagan got his message across. The succession of numbers, if it really worked, could not be a chance event. The message was eleven dimensions deep but it was there. 
I wasn't looking for a message of hope or an expression of faith in this work of science fic­tion. The past semester was exhausting in its continual juxtaposition of science and art as if to disprove one or the other. Here instead was a simple proof, more convincing in the novel than I could present here, but appealing in its simplicity and its central message. 
Sagan told us that scientists and skeptics, in their search for the truth, are not necessarily rebuking God. Some time may come when they will discover an unambiguous message left for them. Faith may be awe and knowledge in­spiration, but unity among people -the complete circle -is life. Before we can be fully human we have to feel the awe, the inspiration and the unity. 
"It doesn't matter what you look like, or what you're made of, or where you come from," Ellie thought. "As long as you live in this uni­verse...sooner or later you'll find the mes­sage."

JULIE RYAN News Reporter Notre Dame raised about $6500.00 for the Marc Buonoconti fund to help re­search find a cure for paralysis, according to Sally Derengoski, assistant director of non-varsity athletics. Notre Dame participated in the nationwide flag football tournament the weekend of Nov. 20-22.

Sixty-five percent of the money pledged at Notre Dame has been collected, she said. According to Derengoski, the tournament was organized to honor Marc Buonoconti. Nick Buonoconti, Marc's father, was a 1962 graduate of Notre Dame. He was a middle linebacker  Citadel and was paralyzed while making a routine tackle. All Notre Dame students were able to participate. Teams were not restricted to residents of halls. Twenty of the twenty-four teams that signed up played with ten to eighteen players per team, ac­cording to the NVA office. The winner of the tourna­ment was Big Bill's Team from Grace Hall.

Scholastic, Juggler and the Dome all report directly to Lanan. As for the Observer, Rocca said that at times he or his staff will meet with the editors to discuss material. "We try to resolve conflict of interests, not opinions, through dialogue and conversation," Rocca said.  Last year he met with Observer editors to discuss a beer adver­tisement which was negative to women and was running at the time of student Michael Cogswell's death in a drinking and driving situation. The issue of censorship at Notre Dame was in the limelight last February, when Scholastic published a photo that had been previously removed from the Juggler by the Office of Student Activities.

Administration officials call the promises a ploy to lure Congress into a cutoff of Contra aid, and point to past failures by the Sandinistas to live up to their promises. 
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Tuesday that the amount and composi­tion of the new aid request will be determined by what Ortega does between now and then in fulfilling those promises, a view shared by aid opponents. 
"The issue remains in doubt," said Hamilton, who was in Costa Rica over the weekend to observe the regional summit as part of a delegation sent by House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas. "The extent to which Ortega implements the concessions he made at San Jose will be criti­cal."

GREENFIELD, Mass. ­Fifth-graders upset over plas­tic forks and spoons in the cafeteria are demanding a return to stainless steel, and their principal said they could protest with posters and peti­tions "as long as they had everything spelled correctly.'' 
The campaign, dubbed "The Great Plastic Fork Rebellion" by one father, began a few weeks ago when students at the Four Corners Elementary School discovered their stain­less steel tableware had been shipped to the high school for use by what one youngster called "ugh, teen-agers." 
In the place of the stainless steel were blue-gray forks and spoons made of reusable hard plastic. 
Babies Don't Thrive In Smoke-filled Wombs 
When You're 
Pregnant, 
Don't Smokel 

Christopher Peters, 11, des­cribed the new tableware as "bumpy, thick, hard to hold ... and eating with them makes you feel weird all over." 
Using non-violent tactics they studied for the Martin Lut­her King Jr. observance, Chris and his classmates hung the cafeteria with posters reading "School Is No Picnic" and "Real People Deserve Real Sil­verware." 
By Friday, the youngsters had gathered signatures from more than half the school's 316 pupils, aged 5 through 12. 
"We didn't break anything or start any riots," said Steven Berson, 10. "We just wrote signs and talked to people, like Martin Luther King." 
The leaders of the protest met Tuesday with the food ser­vices director, who said she would stand her ground under the fire. 


Sandra Herzig said she or­dered the plastic tableware be­cause the stainless steel uten­sils too often ended up in the trash. She added that the plas­tic utensils ·cost about 5 cents less each than stainless steel. 
"When I'm losing one­quarter of my flatware every year, I have to do something," said Ms. Herzig. "I understand the educational value of what they are trying to do, but they've got to look at the cost of things." 
She replaced the stainless steel tableware with plastic at all the town's grammar schools except Four Corners over the summer.

Rioters to be quelled with beatings 
Associated Press 
JERUSALEM -Defense Min­ister Yitzhak Rabin confronted stone-throwing Palestinians in a West Bank refugee camp Tuesday and said the army will use beatings rather than bul­lets to quell riots that began six weeks ago. 
He also said Israel would bar foreign countries or private groups from shipping food to Palestinian refugee camps in the occupied territories. United Nations officials say some camps are short of food be­cause of curfews. 
Talking to reporters and later to Israel Television, Rabin said troops were under orders to use "force, power and blows" to put down violent demonstrations. He used the Hebrew word "makot," which means blows or beatings. 
Elaborating on the policy to an Israel TV reporter, he said soldiers would "prevent them (demonstrations) with force, not fire," and promised the army would leave as soon as order was restored. 
Israeli gunfire has been the No.1 cause of 36 confirmed Pal­estinian deaths in the 6-week­old wave of unrest sweeping the occupied territories. 
Scattered disturbances were reported Tuesday in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, which Is­rael captured from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 Middle East War, but Rabin claimed violent incidents were down ''almost to zero." About 1.5 million Pales­tinians live in the territories. 
Military spokesmen reported "a violent riot" in Mazraa, near the West Bank city of Ramallah. They said a 29-year­old Arab, Azami Jamaa, was hospitalized with a bullet in the chest. 
The defense minister denied there were food shortages in the camps. Soldiers barred a convoy of four food-laden trucks sent by a private Israeli organization from entering the Gaza Strip. 
When Rabin was in the main square of the Jelazoun refugee camp 10 miles north of Jerusalem, a dozen rocks showered onto the street 15 yards away. 
Several reporters saw the in­cident, including a correspon­dent for Israel radio and Asso­ciated Press photographer Eli Hershkovitz, who was hit on the leg by a stone.

Gorbachev's image may blur reality 
Cynicism. Unbelief. Skepticism. A random selection from the nearest thesaurus? Or perhaps this trio of synonyms are words easily applied by many observers to current events. Think about it. The Reagan adminis­tration releases the latest economic fig­ures, indicating yet another decrease in unemployment; meanwhile network newscasters focus on solitary bums sleeping on heating grates in inner cities, hinting darkly about supposed increases in the number of homeless. The administration de-regulates the airliners, leading to more competition; people complain about delays and lost luggage. Television networks proclaim the virtues of their new series ; many remain skeptical of all the sex and vio­lence. The networks put on shows such as "The World of Disney" and "Our House"; nobody watches them.

guest column 
Ah, but where is all that unbelief when the bald head of Mr. Mikhail Gor­bachev appears? Once again a Soviet leader has taken the West by storm. According to House Speaker Jim Wright, Gorbachev received a letter from him on a recent trip to Moscow (expressing the usual hopes for peace, harmony, etc.) by rolling his eyes heavenward and uttering the Russian equivalent of "Thank God." Jimmy Carter, with his usual intellectual pre­cision, called Gorbachev the "most humanitarian" of the world's leaders 
(sorry, Mother Theresa -maybe next year). Gorby merely got out of his limousine and shook a few hands in Washington, D.C., but that was enough to prompt one woman to gush that he is "a P.R. genius!" Other Americans, prior to the Gorbachev's visit, sent the Soviet entourage keys to the front door of their suburban homes (just dinner invitations, you understand), and even invited them to church socials (don't forget the vodka and borscht -and by the way, Comrade Gorbachev, would you recite the Lord's Prayer for us?) 
Obviously, something is wrong here. Americans can be such a questioning, cynical people at times, yet now we find ourselves awash in naivete. And a care­ful look at the record shows that we need a dose of healthy skepticism con-



P.O. Box Q 
Glee Club thanks NO for support 
Dear Editor: 

As the new semester begins, many people tend to forget some of the im­portant events of the semester past. The confusion over new classes and long lines at the bookstore form a kind of memory block. Well, the Notre Dame Glee Club would like to take a short moment to recollect with the Notre Dame family. 
If you will think way back to Christmas of 1987, you might remem­ber that we performed two concerts on campus: one predominantly for Uni­versity staff and employees at Wash­ington Hall and the other for the stu­dents at Stepan Center. In addition, if you were lucky enough to attend one of these shows you might recall that we took a collection for the South Bend Shelter for the Homeless. After sepa­rating the numerous pennies and crumpled dollar bills, we counted ex­actly $1,416.81, the majority of which was donated at the student concert. 
Doonesbury 
(Who said students are poor?) 
From all of us in the Glee Club, thank you very much. It is comforting to know that so many of you have consideration and generosity for the unfortunate people of the South Bend community. We are lucky to be able to give our Christmas spirit to you with our songs and to them with your donations. Thank you, once again, and we look forward to even better results in 1-988.

cerning Mr. Gorbachev. Take his inter­view with Tom Brokaw on NBC. On the possibility of allowing non-Communist political parties in the USSR: "I see no need for any. other party ... we eliminated the exploitation of man by man." True, only they replaced it with the exploitation of man by a party. Next question: Why the Berlin Wall? "Through West Berlin, a lot was done which caused great harm, both political and economic, to that country (East Germany)." Is he serious? The only "damage" was in offering a vision of freedom which entices 16,000 East Ger­mans per month to flee their socialist utopia. And finally: Why don't you per­mit free emigration? The truth, of course, is that if he did, everyone of sound mind would leave. But of course Gorby couldn't say that. So instead he aggressively argued the superiority of Soviet "social and economic right" to Western-style rights. "For 50-odd years we have had no unemployment," he bragged. He forgot to mention that being unemployed (defined as "parasitism") is punishable as a crime in the USSR. 
Fact is, that while the style of Mr. Gorbachev may be different from his predecessors, the substance remains largely the same. Any "reforms" he attempts will remain within the strait­jacket of Soviet communism. But then that should not surprise us. For Gor­bachev shares an important character­istic with this forebears: He is a Com­munist. He seeks, not peace, but the greatest advantage possible for his Communist empire, as all Soviet leaders have sought. Cold War rhetoric, you say? Remember: 110,000 Soviet troops remain in Afghanistan, the same number as were there at this time last year. The INF Treaty? It gives the soviets a clear conventional-arms su­periority in Europe. His personal charm? But the record cited above shows that, while his smile may be broader, Gorbachev's positions differ little from Stalin or Khrushchev. It's been said before; it must be said again -the West must not allow the chimeric vision of peace to blind its view of the Soviet adversary. For an adversary of the United States Mr. Gorbachev will surely remain.

Predictions 1988: 
Dorks, yaks and evil alien playmates 

If you're wondering whether I'm implying that Michael Jackson looks like Liz Taylor's evil alien playmate you can stop wonder­ing. I am. 
Whitney Houston, who figured in my prediction about the entertainment industry, also figures in my fifth predic­tion. Whitney's squeaky clean image will be shattered when she's spotted in the back seat of a '78 Impala with Spuds McKenzie. An angry crowd will lynch Spuds, but Whitney will escape and go on to write "Saving All My Spuds For You," which will stay at number one on the charts for an amazing nine weeks. Watch for it. 
My sixth prediction combines my first and fourth predictions. Liz Taylor's evil alien playmate will enter the presidential elec­tion as the democratic can­didate for president. Because of the alien's amazing likeness to its new husband, Michael Jackson, it will beat out George 
Bush on Nov. 4. The same people who lynched Spuds McKenzie after finding him in the Impala with Whitney will be terrified when they realize that America is being governed by 
Liz Taylor's evil alien playmate. They'll attempt to assassinate the president, but Whitney will 
intervene with an army of fifty­
foot pit bull robots. At this point my mind gets cloudy and 
I can't see what happens next. Anyway, it's going to be a bad 
scene. Watch for it. 
Speaking of clouded minds, mine feels like green jello. Nobody said being a psychic was easy. As I've revealed, 1988 will be a year marked by yaks, sex and food, Whitney Houston and Liz Taylor's ever­present evil alien playmate. In other words, it's going to be about thirty times better than 1987 any way you look at it. It couldn't be much worse.

Altered 
As anyone who read a head­line or turned on the TV news in 1987 knows, this last year was the Year of the Bimbo. Fawn Hall, Donna Rice and Tammy Faye Baker were the most visible of the obnoxious women who slept and lied their way to the top. I predict that 1988 will be the Year of the Dork. Most probable candidate for Top Dork of 1988 is George Bush who will probably become President on Nov. 4. This col­umnist will not pretend to be an extremely well-informed po­litical commentator, but he does have the strong feeling that a former vice president named after a stubby lawn plant is well on his way to be­coming King Dork. Other probable Dorks for 1988 in­clude the Ayatollah Khomeni for 1988 is the pit bull as the hot pet to own. Last year was a tense year for everyone involved, and vicious, man-eating dogs just kind of fit in with the general mood. This year will be a much more mel­low year, and, therefore, the hot pet to own in 1988 will be a yak. That's right, a yak. Yaks are hairy, four-legged animals that have big noses and live in the Himalayas or the Andes or some remote mountain range like those. They're lovable, easy to feed (grass, garbage) and great with kids. On the bad side, they're expensive (logical when you consider how expensive it is to ship a half ton animal from Mongolia to Chicago), and they smell funny. Real funny. So be smart and buy a yak now before they're all gone or all turned into yak meat or whatever happens to yaks. If you're willing to wait about six months there should be an authorized yak dealer in most metropolitan areas. 
My third foolish, er, fearless prediction for 1988 involves the movie industry. With more Americans than ever dieting and eating the right foods, etc., food will become an ex­tremely hot topic in popular culture, especially in movies. With Americans seeing less food on their tables, they'll 
want to experience more food in entertainment. Therefore, you'll see less sex and violence in movies in 1988 and more sex and food. Films like "Fatal Pasta Attraction" and "Last Cream Bun in Paris" will attract huge crowds with their potent mix of raunchy sex and steamed vegetables. 
The culinary craze will also spill over into the other enter­tainment industries with the next Whitesnake album tenta­tively titled "Is This Love Or Just Another Bowl of Soggy Frosted Flakes?" Whitney Hous­ton will re-record her huge hit "Saving All My Love For You" as "Saving All My Doughnuts For You." Watch for it. 
My fourth prediction for 1988 may sound familiar. I predict that Michael Jackson will wed Liz Taylor's evil alien playmate. Fans will be uanble to tell Mi­chael and his new bride apart. 



Urban Plunge experience: 
the fall of a hero 

NAN SAUER 
accent writer 
T
he expectations that I had built up prior to going on my Urban Plunge were slightly different than my actual experi­ences. One experience in par­ticular affected me beyond just the "social awareness" that the Plunge was intended to pro­vide. I had expected to experi­ence poverty in my own hometown, to see firsthand just what It was like to be poor. I thought that I'd be somewhat of a detatched contributor, hel­ping people out, getting a feel for what life was like for them. 
Many of the students that attended my high school were from the inner city of Fort Wayne; This part of town is not exactly what you would call the high rent district. In fact, some of the families that live in the downtown area survive on in­comes that are at or below poverty level. For. my Plunge, headed to St. Mary's Church, located In the heart of this downtown area. I realized that, while I was there, it would be quite possible for me to work with one of the inner city resi­dents who had attended my high school. What I didn't ex­pect. though, was to see a guy like Tim walk through the doors of the Soup Kitchen at St. Mary's Church. 

At almost every high school, there is one athlete that the entire student body regards as a sort of god. During my fresh­man year at North Side High School, that athlete was Tim. Tim led the football team to a conference championship, playing on both the offensive and defensive squads. He was the fast-breaking floor leader for the basketball team, and no one could beat him in the 100 meter dash in track and field. It would be an off week if Tim's picture wasn't in one of the local papers at least once. "That kid's got a great future ahead of him," my dad would always say to me. 
Tim was, needless to say, heavily recruited for football by several major colleges, includ­ing his eventual choice, Indiana University at Bloomington. The whole school shared in Tim's excitement. After he graduated, I didn't follow his career too closely, but I assumed that he was breaking Jots of records at I.U. 
I can't exactly explain just how I felt when I saw Tim walking toward the door of the St. Mary's Soup Kitchen. This was not a situation that I was prepared to deal with. I could tell he was high on something, and somehow I didn't think that many professional football players needed to make use of a soup kitchen. I thought that perhaps this guy just looked like Tim. After all, I hadn't seen him for about seven years. There was no mistaking the name that he wrote down on the sign-up sheet, though. God, how could this have hap­pened? 
At first, I was really mad at him. I couldn't believe that he had thrown away a chance to really make it. How dare he waste such a privilege? Lots of the guys that I had known at North Side would have jumped at the chance to play football for any college team, let alone a Big Ten school like Indiana. 
As the day went on, my anger turned to sadness. I was sad for Tim. Maybe he didn't "blow It" as I had thought at first. Maybe things just didn't fall into place for him as they had for other people. Maybe he had just had a few more un­lucky breaks. 
God, it must be so hard for him to think about what could have been. There's probably not a day that goes by that he doesn't think back on what it felt like to be a hero --and what reality feels like now. By the glaze that covered his eyes, I didn't think it felt too good. 
I thought about Tim during the remainder of my stay at St. Mary's. I've been thinking about him ever since. The more that I think about Tim's situation, though, the more that I end up thinking about my own. How can I have the nerve to sit here at Notre Dame and complain about how much work I have this week. and basically whine about how rough my life is? I am so damn lucky. Everybody here is. It's just too bad that I wasn't able to realize that fact until I saw how some people -­people who were once an inspi­ration to others --can have their lives turn out for the worse. 
Tim was a good guy in high school. He was always trying to be the best he could be. The only reason that he was the one receiving soup and I was the one handing it to him was that, up until then, I had been lucky and he hadn't. It's true that he might have made some mistakes along the way, but the simple fact is that I could very well have made the same mistakes and ended up out of college, without a job, and without anywhere to turn. 
I was prepared to see desti­tute people on this Urban Plunge. I wasn't prepared to see Tim among those destitute people. 
I guess that if you asked me what I "learned" from all of this, I'd have to say that I've learned to be more apprecia­tive of my own situation --and also a bit more understanding of Tim's. I could say that I know exactly how he feels, but I don't. What I can say Is that I know that poverty is not some­thing that just affects other people. It affects Tim, and it has affected me. The shock of seeing him there was so over­whelming that I will no longer be able to simply acknowledge the existence of poverty without feeling compelled to do some­thing about it. Until last week. poverty wasn't something that was real to me. Now it is al­most too real.

Freshman guard Karen Robinson has established herself as the heir apparent to Irish senior Mary Gavin on the women's basketball team. Robinson's play Is one reason Notre Dame Is off to a quick start, and Brian O'Gara features her at right. 
The Observer page 9 
Freshman starter 


Robinson sparks Irish 
By BRIAN O'GARA 
Assistant Sports Editor 
If Notre Dame women's bas­ketball coach Muffet McGraw was worried about looking for someone to try to fill the big . shoes of senior point guard Mary Gavin next year, she needed to look no further than Gavin's neighborhood court. 
It is there where freshman Karen Robinson, like Gavin before her, sharpened her bas­ketball skills before coming to play for McGraw this year. 
"It's funny because Mary lives right up the street from me down in Wildwood (New Jersey)," said Robinson. "My family has a business on the Boardwalk there, so I've known her since I was young. I wasn't good friends with her or anything, but we played bas­ketball around the corner all the time." 
Now, a few years later, Rob­inson and Gavin team up in Notre Dame's backcourt and run the offense for the 10-4 Irish, who head to Chicago tonight to face North Star rival DePaul. 
Robinson's quickness led J.l,1cGraw to move JUnior Diondra Toney to the forward spot in order to start Robinson at guard. 
"Karen's biggest assets are her quickness and speed," said McGraw. "Having her at guard with Mary helps us play the up­tempo game that we want to play." 

With Gavin, who holds Notre Dame career records in assists and steals, at point guard, Rob­inson jumped into the off-guard position in the preseason and has started every game of the year. 
"At first I didn't know I would start," said Robinson, "but I thought I could get playing time. I was recruited as a point guard, but there's no question Mary Gavin is our point guard. I played the two­position before, but not much. 
"Coach McGraw came in with a fast-break style and that's how we played in high school, so this type of game is good for me. I moved to the two, but the way we get up the floor I don't have to wait for the ball." 
Robinson was recruited by former head coach Mary DiS­tanislao, another native of the Garden State, who resigned last spring. Along came McGraw, whose fast-breaking, pressure-defense style of bas­ketball with Gavin and Robin­son at the wheel has the Irish a possible contender for the NCAA Tournament. 
"I found out about the coach­ing change in the summer," recalled Robinson. "I knew a little about the problems last year with some girls quitting and all the losses. But I picked the school because of the school, not because of basket­ball or Mary D." 
At Paul VI High School, Rob­inson was named South Jersey Player of the Year for 1987 and earned all-America honors from USA Today. Last summer she participated in the U.S. Olympic Festival in Chapel Hill, N.C., where she was a member of the East team. 
Last Saturday in Notre Dame's 81-62 win over Syracuse, Robinson scored in double figures for the fourth time this season with 10 points, including a 6-of-6 performance at the free-throw line, where she leads the Irish at 80 per­cent. 
"Karen helps me out a lot," said Gavin of her heir apparent at the point, "especially when we're playing against teams that play a pressure defense and we're trying to bring the ball up." 
While Robinson and Gavin break the press, 6-4 junior cen­ter Heidi Bunek and 6-2 senior Sandy Botham will battle the Blue Demons' top scorer Diana Vines in the paint. Vines leads the North Star Conference with 
24.0 points and 11.6 rebounds per game. 
"We really need to shut her down," said McGraw of Vines. "It'll be a very physical game."

Lyons stops Howard by 10 Sports Briefs 
By JEFF HEILERT Sports Writer 
The women's Interhall bas­ketball season ended its third week this past Sunday night with some fine displays of indi­vidual and team talent. 
In a game full of action and intensity, Lyons upped its record to 2-1 with a 44-34 win over Howard, now 1-1. 
Howard kept the game close early by capitalizing at the free-throw line. Howard guard Lauren Romeo was able to con­tinuously penetrate the lane, either drawing a foul or dishing to Elise Seguin for the short jump shot. 
With Howard trailing by one at the end of the first quarter, Lyons began to pick up the tempo. Employing a 1-2-2 full court trap, it was able to cut off the penetration of the Howard guards. 
Offensively, Gretchen Kraus began to take over for Lyons. She finished as the game's leading scorer with 12 points. Kraus helped Lyons go on a 10-4 run and take a 20-13 halftime lead. 

Both teams traded baskets early in the second half before Howard made one final run. Trailing by seven at the end of the third quarter, Howard's Tammy Houseworth connected on a pair of jump shots to cut the lead to three. 
Howard switched to a 1-3-1 half-court trap and came up with an important steal. After failing to capitalize on the op­portunity to cut the defecit to one, Howard never threatened again. Kraus and senior Elizabeth Bolt put Lyons com­fortably back in the lead with a pair of jumpers. 
Bolt finished with eight points while Seguin and Houseworth tied with 10 points each to lead Howard. 
In other action, Breen­Phillips picked up its first win of the year by defeating Pasquerilla East, 31-19. BP moved to 1-2 on the season while PE fell to an identical1-2. 
Only two teams remain un­defeated on the season. Pasquerilla West moved to 3-0 with a victory over Walsh, while Lewis stayed in second place with a 2-0 record after beating Badin. 
Action resumes Sunday with a key game between the two undefeated squads, PW and Lewis, at 2 p.m.

Track club stuck 1n middle

The recent storm of changes in the Notre Dame athletic de­partment hit the women's track club hard. 
Ever since its cross-country counterpart gained varsity status in 1986, the club has had a precarious existence. One of its coaches was also the varsity cross country coach, and its distance runners were also var­sity athletes. 
But the cross country coach, Dan Ryan, recently resigned, and a decision by Non-Varsity Athletics and the Athletic De­partment also has barred Ryan from coaching track. 
"Their exact words to me," said Ryan, "were 'my overin­volvement with the cross country runners' on the track team, and not enough attention to the other members of the track club." 
Assistant Athletic Director Brian Boulac, who informed Ryan of the decision, said the club had approached NVA about Ryan's involvement. 
Rich O'Leary, assistant director of club sports, said the track club was concerned that the athletes in the sprints and weights were concerned that Ryan was concentrating on the distance runners, and that they

were continuing to look for a moderator. 
"He was trying to put his girls in a year-round training program, and understandably so," said O'Leary. "But it was that fftetion between the var­sity status and the club status that was causing problems." 
Dr. Tom Kelly, director of NVA, noted that from his de­partment's standpoint, the stu­dents in the club are supposed to do the majority of the admin­istrative work within the club. 
Theresa Rice, captain of both the cross country and track teams, contends that the cross country and track mixture was a positive factor on the club. 
"We don't see it as a con­flict," said Rice. "It's like this: we hate running on the club level. After competing in the Indiana Intercollegiate meet last year, we got bumped from it because we were a club. 
"The cross country is an in­centive to run club track. It helps to keep the women's track club going. 
Rice added that the sprinters and hurdlers trained with the cross country team during the fall, and assistant coach Mike McDonnell was delegated to work with them. McDonnell continues to work with the track team.

Rice added that a majority of the club members wanted Ryan as a moderator. 
Ryan said the Athletic De­partment did give him hope that the track club would even­tually go varsity. 
As the new cross country co­ordinator for both men and wo­men, Joe Piane will have to deal with the same varsity-club con­flict. 
"(Ryan) was in a difficult po­sition," said Piane. "Even some of the girls on the team experienced a conflict. It is a legitimate problem. Dan han­dled it as well as he could." 
Piane also praised the work Ryan did in leading the wo­men's cross country team the last few years. 
"Under Dan the program gained direction," he said. "He worked diligently with it. And the team peroformed well. There's no doubt the girls im­proved from the first year to last year."

on three club promotions 
By PETE GEGEN Sports Writer 

Non-Varsity Athletics gave birth to three varsity sports, and the department 
didn't  even  know  it  was  
pregnant.  
According  to  Rich  

O'Leary, assistant director of club sports, the softball, women's golf and women's soccer clubs all had not ap­plied for varsity status. Usually the clubs them­selves apply for varsity des­ignation. 
"Softball and soccer have been participating with the understanding that they would apply for varsity status, but they never have formally applied," said O'Leary. "Interest has also been shown by the men's vol­leyball, women's track and

water polo clubs, but t~ey have not formally applied for varsity status." 
_O'Leary said that it was the Athletic Department's decision to promote those three sports. Of the three, the women's golf promotion took NVAby surpirse, partly because the original news only mentioned soccer and softball. 
Adding further confusion to the news is the time that has elapsed since an article in the South Bend Tribune first mentioned the moves. Printed in the Dec. 30 issue, that article included quotes from Assistant Athletic Director Brian Boulac. But an official announcement has yet to come from the Sports Information depart­ment.

While the senior Titterton will never get the chance to play on the varsity squad, her sister, junior Jane Titterton, will. 
"I'm looking forward to taking soccer more seriously playing for the varsity,'' said Jane Titterton. "Before we couldn't even travel to away games be­cause we didn't have any money."

McGraw's Irish: off and running Picture this scenario. Notre Dame beats Miami by 15, and is ranked number one in the nation. A shattered dream of seasons past? An unfulfilled chal­lenge on Lou Holtz' list of 100 goals? No -a reality -just two short weeks ago. But it happened on an indoor surface with a round ball and female athletes. Brian O'Gara Irish Items On Jan. 7 the Notre Dame women's basketball team defeated the Hurricanes of Miami, 83-68, and improved its position as the number one team in the nation in field­goal percentage at .534. Even better news came to head coach Muffet McGraw's office on Tuesday, as the 10-4 Irish picked up three votes in the Associated Press Top 20 women's basketball poll. Just one year ago the record stood at 4-11, three players had quit the team and the outlook was bleak. Today the outlook is anything but bleak, as McGraw has the Irish posed to challenge for a first-ever bid to the NCAA Tourn­ament. Along the way stand several obstacles, including Ten­nessee, everyone's preseason No. 1 and currently in the top five of most polls. The Lady Vols will bring their act to the Joyce ACC on Feb. 3 and will not see the same team they demolished 90-55 last season. Circle that date on your calendar. Much of the credit for that goes to McGraw, the first-year Irish coach who brought a career record of 88-41 to Notre Dame last spring after the resignation of former head coach Mary DiStanislao. McGraw has the Irish off to the races this winter, with a pressure defense which has created a dangerous fast break. While at Lehigh, McGraw's teams consistently racked up impressive records but could not make the NCAA Tournament because it had little clout or name-recognition with the powers-that-be. Name recognition is not a prob­lem under the Golden Dome. While McGraw brought change to Notre Dame's game, some things remain the same, particularly the stellar play of point guard Mary Gavin. With every steal and assist Gavin adds to her own all-time Irish records. She currently is second in the nation with 9.5 assists a game. Notre Dame's coronation as field-goal percentage queens can be attributed to the fast break and the strong inside play of twin towers Heidi Bunek and Sandy Botham. So far the Irish have avoided the run-and-gun plague which bites many fast-breaking teams. When the break is stifled, Bunek (17.9 points per game) and Botham (15.5) have had little trouble getting open underneath and putting the ball in the hoop. Bunek was named this week's North Star Conference Player of the Week after consecutive 23-point perfor­mances against Syracuse and Northern Illinois. "The see IRISH, page 13
