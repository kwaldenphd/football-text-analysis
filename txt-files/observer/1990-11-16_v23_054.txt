Security call-boxes to be ready by Dec. 
By MEGAN JUNIUS 
News Writer 
Security call-boxes are currently being installed in 18 locations around campus, according to Phil Johnson, assistant director of Security. 
The call boxes are specially designed for fast, reliable response, he said. To notify Security, the user need only open the door of the call-box. Inside the box will be an extremely sensitive speaker telephone that allows Security to hear the situation whether or not the person activating the phone is speaking, Johnson said. 
Because of the special wiring of the phone, Security will immediately know the location of the phone and send help, he said. 
The phones were placed in locations needing better security, as proven through campus statistics. In the past, Saint Mary's Road and the parking lots have been a concern to many, he said, so call-boxes will be placed in these areas. 
However, since the residence halls have phones at the front of each door, and the paths along the main quads are well lit, there is little need for call boxes in these areas, Johnson said. 
The eighteen call-boxes will be ready for use Dec. 1, Johnson said, as the wiring and software are still being adjusted. Signs will be posted above the call­boxes when they are officially in operation. 
"We hope these phones are taken seriously. They have been installed for emergency use only," Johnson said. He defined emergency situations as

Faculty and students debate ROTC's place on campus 
By BETSY PUNSALAN 
News Writer 
Opinions were divided three to one in favor of ROTC at Notre Dame in a student/faculty panel discussion Thursday marking the third and final part of a Student Government lecture series. 
Alan Dowty, professor of government and international studies, and Father Joe Ross, rector of Morrissey Hall, were the faculty members of the panel. The student team con­sisted of senior Mary Sue Twohy, a senior anthropology major, and Patrick Murphy, a senior electrical engineering and government major who is in Army ROTC. 
"I'm well aware of how divi­sive this issue is," said Ross, the only participant who spoke against ROTC on campus. "Everybody struggles with this and no one has all the an­swers." 
Ross noted that Notre Dame students tend to be very defen­sive over the issue because ROTC is a financial necessity for many. "This is entirely un­derstandable." 
According to Ross, the recent talks given by journalist Cole­man McCarthy and Father Oliver Williams, associate provost at Notre Dame, regard­ing ROTC on campus were not very useful because they "danced around" and "oversimplified" the issue. 
"I don't appreciate [Williams'] theology," said Ross, "because my main concern comes from an educational perspective." 
Ross believes that the ROTC system tends to be anti-intellec­tual. 


Student government pushes for policy of freedom of expression 
By KELLEY TUTHILL and JOHN O'BRIEN 
News Writers 
In its continuing efforts to salvage the ideas of the Student Bill of Rights, the Student Gov­ernment's Legal Department \\ill pursue a policy of free ex­pression, but will not push for public knowledge of disci­plinary hearings. 
The areas of free expression and public disclosure of hear­ings, along with collective pun­ishment and judgement by peers, are the main issues which the Legal Department chose to address, according to Raja Singh, executive coordina­tor of the Legal Department. 
The Legal Department is compiling reports on each of these four areas and submitting them to the Bill of Student and University Relations fask Force. If they are appr ed by the Task Force, they w' be as­similated into a sing' report which will be sent to the Cam-

pus Life Council (CLC). If the CLC accepts this report, it will be forwarded to Patricia O'Hara, vice-president for Stu­dent Affairs, for her evaluation, and could become part of du Lac when it is revised this summer. 
The Legal Department is con­centrating on the issue of free­dom of expression because du Lac is ambiguous in its treat­ment of the issue, according to Singh. 
"There needs to be a well-de­fined policy regarding campus media and freedom of expres­sion," said Student Body Presi­dent Rob Pasin. 
The report is calling for a "free and open community" which will enhance the educa­tion at Notre Dame, said Singh. 
"Our aim is to ensure an envi­ronment where any idea can be expressed free of censorship," he said. 
The Legal Department report makes five recommendations regarding free expression on campus: 
•It 
recommends that du Lac's statement on Student Media (page 62) be modified to take a stronger stand on a "free and uncensored media." 

•It 
proposes the idea of "limited recognition" of campus organizations that don't reflect the "Catholic perspective" of the University. 

•It 
recommends the continua­tion of the University's free speaker policy. 

•It 
recommends that Univer­sity facilities be made available to individuals as well as groups "if their purpose is to express a legitimate idea." 

• 
It proposes the formation of a seven member "Freedom of 


see RIGHTS I page 12 

"The ROTC program puts our students into situations for which they might not be ready for," said Ross, citing chains of command as one example. "How can we be asking them to enter into a system where they have to follow policies ... which the Church has condemned?" 
"If we have to [have ROTC on campus]. then the students should at least be getting good moral and theological educa­tions, he said. "They're not well enough trained. They're doing what they're told, and that's tragic." 
Ross said that the Catholic tradition of non-violence goes back to Jesus, who must be the center of our tradition. "We die before we kill," he said. 
According to Dowty, a non­Catholic and pacifist who is in favor of ROTC on campus, the concept has to be viewed as a lesser of evils. He believes in making the most socially ac­ceptable choices, not in com­promising with evil. 
Dowty said that violence is sometimes justified, although it

INSIDE COLUMN 


A&L students overlooked in job search 
"Don't call us, we'll call you." 
"Sorry, we only want finance and eco­nomics majors." 
"Your GPA and work experience are commendable, but we aren't able to offer 

you a position with Christine Walsh our firm at this time." Business Editor 
"It's a shame you don't have six hours of accounting ... " 
I started out the semester with grand vi­sions of coasting through senior year and leaving ND with diploma in hand and an awesome job in my back pocket. Instead, all I have encountered are brick walls. 
It seems that every time I say that I am a government and philosophy major, employ­ers run for the hills. At least as a govern­ment major I may aspire to being a public servant, say, a police officer, or a postal worker, or a tax collector-certainly not an investor on Wall Street. 
The very word 'philosophy' seems to throw employers into a tizzy. They are sure that we philosopohy majors may put pic­tures of Plato on our desks, wear sandals to work and protest rigid work schedules because they stifle human beings and prevent them from reaching their proper telos. 
At best, a philosophy major will be the annoying person who sits in the cubicle next to you, talking incessantly about the simi­larities between Nietzsche's ideas and the plot of Lethal Weapon II. 
If you haven't studied 'The Four P's,' the vicious cycle and taxation in your four years of college, you are obviously not interested in working in Corporate America. Everyone knows that all Arts and Letters majors either go into the Peace Corps or 
graduate school. Why else would anyone take four years of Great Books seminars? 
When I first came to Notre Dame I was told to seek 'a liberal education.' Don't choose a major because you think it will get you a job; choose a major because that is what truly interests you. If you like what you are studying, you will do well. 
Naively, I followed this advice. I have en­joyed my four years of study here and have 'done well,' but unemployment seems an awfully high price to pay for the enjoyment gained from studying what I wanted. 
No matter how well I have performed at this university, inside and outside the class­room, it never seems to be enough. I will never have that one thing that all employers seem to be looking for-a business degree. 
It matters little that I can and have writ­
ten business correspondence, prepared pre­
sentations, spoken in public and analyzed 
charts and graphs. I even have work experi­
ence with one of the largest international 
corporations. 
Most companies have extensive training programs, claiming that they want to be able to 'mold' their own employees. If that's the case, Arts and Letters majors can learn just as well as the marketing major. Em­ployers would be well-advised not to alien­ate eager students based solely on their prejudice against particular majors.

Bret Easton Ellis. a best-selling author. blasted Simon and Schuster on Thursday for the publisher's 11th­hour decision to ax his new novel about a serial killer who mutilates women, saying it smacks of censorship. "If all this had been brought up 11 months ago, I would not say that," Ellis said. "But when it comes this late in the game and it seems that it was done just because Marvin Davis does not respond to this kind of fiction, then it is censor­ship." Ellis was referring to the head of Paramount Communications Inc., Simon and Schuster's parent com­pany. The publishing house announced Wednesday it would not print Ellis' third novel, "American Psycho."

They traded campaign rhetoric on the day Heseltine formally submitted his bid for leadership of the Conservative Party and the government. Heseltine, once Thatcher's defense secretary, will stand against her in a ballot Tuesday of the 372 Conservative legislators. It marks the first seri­ous challenge to her leadership since she took office 11 years ago. "After three general election victories, leading the only party with clear policies, resolutely carried out, I intend to continue," she declared in the House of Com­

The fire's cause had not been determined. "We have it labeled as suspicious at this time," said Fort Wayne deputy fire chief Jerry Bauermeister.

Beware of flying pizzas fired by Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. And yo, you Bart Simpson fans, don't get careless with a nylon replica of your television hero. So says a personal injury lawyer in his annual pre-Christmas list of dangerous toys. The list, released Thursday by attorney Edward Swartz, includes a Batmobile equipped with rocket launchers and a simulated crossbow. Swartz said the toys "have the potential to kill or injure," but officials at several toy companies disputed his allegations, saying their products meet safety standards and have adequate warnings. 
The soldiers accused of killing six Jesuit priests in a massacre that received world attention, have yet to be brought to trial after a year since the slayings had oc­curred. The soldiers who pulled the triggers have con­fessed and are likely to go to jail. But the senior officer charged in the deaths may well go free, and the question of whether higher-ups were involved is likely to remain a mystery. State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said Thursday in Washington: "This brutal crime shocked the conscience of El Salvador and the world. . .. The United States insists on a full investigation and prosecu­tion. There is no issue regarding El Salvador to which the ambassador and our embassy have devoted greater effort than the pursuit of justice in the murder of the Jesuits."

NASA launches Atlantis for spy mission over Iraq 
CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -NASA fueled the space shut­tle Atlantis on Thursday for a reported spying mission over Iraq that officials said would be the last secret military flight for a space shuttle. 
Atlantis was expected to lift off with five astronauts and a spy satellite at 6:46 p.m. EST or by 8:12 p.m. EST, but wind threatened to block launch. 
NASA pumped more than a half-million gallons of liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen into Atlantis. The fuel will have to be drained if liftoff is delayed until Friday or Saturday, when better weather is expected. 
The fueling was completed despite a last-minute problem with a unit at the launch pad used to cool the shuttle, said

NASA spokesman Dick Young. A back-up cooling unit was brought into service, and Young said the problem should not delay the launch. 
Air Force meteorologists predicted a 40 percent chance of good weather for Thursday night, down from earlier fore­casts of 60 percent. The biggest threat was crosswinds that might exceed the allowable 14 mph at the launch pad and emergency landing area. Other concerns were scattered clouds and possible showers. 
The launch was to be the fifth in darkness in 37 shuttle flights. It also was to be NASA's fifth launch for 1990 and the seventh and probably last Pentagon mission, which are shrouded in secrecy.

A news blackout has been im­posed on Atlantis' four-day flight, during which the astro­nauts will deploy a satellite that sources said is to spy on Iraq. Experts believe it is either a photographic imaging or an eavesdropping spacecraft. 
Atlantis carried a spy satellite into orbit during its last flight in March. 
The shuttle's all-military crew, commanded by Air Force Col. Richard Covey, has been waiting for months to fly this mission. The flight was sched­uled for July but was delayed indefinitely when Atlantis was found during a fueling t.est in June to have dangerous hydro­gen leaks. 
It was the second shuttle to be crippled by leaking hydro­gen. Columbia's astronomy mission was scrubbed in May when the spaceship sprang leaks during fueling. 
During the grounding, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration replaced Atlantis' external fuel tank, plumbing between the orbiter and tank, and valve seals. In addition, Atlantis' military cargo reportedly was modified for gathering information in the Persian Gulf. 
Atlantis, like Columbia, was cleared for flight during a fuel­ing test last month. 
NASA set a Nov. 9 launch date for Atlantis, but the Air Force delayed that mission because of undisclosed cargo problems. That trouble quickly was resolved, clearing the way for Thursday's liftoff attempt. 
Also on the crew are Navy Cmdr. Frank Culbertson Jr., pi­lot; and Army Capt. Charles Gemar, Air Force Lt. Col. Carl Meade and Marine Col. Robert Springer, all mission specialists. 
The Pentagon has imposed a news blackout on the flight sim­ilar to its six previous missions. Because of the expense in maintaining secure operations, officials said this would be the last military shuttle mission to be conducted in secrecy. 
The Pentagon plans to use the shuttle two more times in 1991, but the cargoes in each in­stance will be unclassified. Mili­tary officials will rely on un­manned rockets -primarily the giant Titan 4 -to carry other payloads into orbit.

ROTC members are allowed to impact is the "just means" por­tion. 
"The decision-making pro­cesses that goes into the just war theory will for the most part be out of the hands [of Notre Dame ROTC] students," said Twohy, adding that these are the students with a good moral education. 
TWohy also pushes for making the war ethics class a re­quirement for all ROTC stu­dents. 
In addition to ethical training, 1\vohy advocates other types of financial assistance programs. 
"Why aren't there alterna­tives for students needing fi­nancial assistance that do not involve the possibility of vio­lence?" she said. 
Twohy ended her portion of the discussion with a quote from Adrienne's Rich's selection of poems, "Leaflets": "All wars are useless to the dead."

Dame require freshmen to take war ethics before they sign an ROTC contract at the beginning of their sophomore year. 
According to Murphy. ROTC will continue to exist, even if it were eliminated from Notre Dame's campus. 
"Even if we could kick ROTC off of all college campuses," he said "I don't see it ending the 
U.S. military." 

Murphy believes the issue goes deeper than simply the ex­istence of U.S. military pro­grams. 
"Getting rid of ROTC and the military is like cutting a branch off a tree without cutting the tree down," he said.

Sweeping arms reduction treaty awaits Bush's signature 
WASHINGTON (AP) -As the most sweeping arms reduction treaty in history awaited Presi­dent Bush's signature. U.S. of­ficials on Thursday registered concern about the transfer of thousands of Soviet tanks to Siberia from Eastern Europe. 
The officials stressed that the tanks and other equipment shifted east of the Ural Moun­tains could not be excluded from the cutbacks required by the Conventional Forces in Eu­rope treaty. 
But they said the Soviets had given assurances that some of the weapons were destroyed and most of the rest would be put to the torch. 
The treaty is to be signed on Monday in Paris by Bush, Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev and the leaders of 20 other NATO and Warsaw Pact coun­tries. 
It is the most ambitious arms 
control accord in history and 
was aimed at reducing Cold 
War tensions between East and 
West. Even before the treaty's 
conclusion the Soviets under 
Gorbachev undertook major 
reductions in Eastern and Cen­
tral Europe. The treaty makes 
many of these cutbacks legally 
binding. 
With the signing deadline only 
four days away, U.S. officials 
said some details still had to be 
ironed out. They mostly con­
cern procedures to verify that 
the reductions in tanks. anti­
aircraft artillery, armored per­
sonnel carriers, aircraft and 
helicopters are carried out. 
Diplomats in Vienna said, however, that negotiators for the two military alliances had reached tentative agreement on treaty terms. 
The treaty will allow NATO and the Warsaw Pact each to keep 20,000 battle tanks. 30,000 armored combat vehi­cles, 20,000 pieces of artillery, 6,800 combat aircraft and 2,000 attack helicopters. 
The cutbacks are far deeper on the Warsaw Pact side, and in that sense represents a triumph for the Bush administration. 
But the transfer of Soviet tanks and other arms east of the Ural Mountains -beyond the 2.5 million square miles covered by the treaty -drew attention here even though the main U.S. goals had been ac­complished. 
"This is not a new issue," a senior U.S. official told re­porters at the White House. "We have made it clear to the Soviet Union from the begin­ning that since the treaty deals only with Europe, we wanted to ensure there would be no buildup in the Soviet Union east of the Urals that would circum­vent the treaty." 
At the same time, the official 
said, the Bush administration 
had put pressure .on the Soviets 
to withdraw their forces from 
Eastern Europe. As a result, 
tanks and other weapons were 
pulled back to Siberia. 
That positions them beyond 
the area where East-West ten­sions were high and where the United States wanted Soviet weapons held to a minimum. 
On Sunday, the day before the treaty signing, the two alliances will exchange information about the size of their non-nu­clear arsenals assigned to Eu­rope. Then, over 40 months, they will be obliged to destroy all weapons above the ceilings set by the treaty. 
The restriction applies to ma­terial assigned to the European arsenal that may have been moved elsewhere, including the tanks in Siberia and tanks and other non-nuclear weapons the United States has sent to the Persian Gulf in a military buildup designed to force Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait. 
"Obviously. we are concerned about movements to the East of the Urals," said the senior offi­cial, whose identity was shielded under White House briefing rules. "The Soviet Union has assured us that some of the equipment has already been destroyed and that much of the rest will be destroyed." 
The treaty will establish in­spection procedures and other ways of monitoring the cut­backs are carried out. The offi­cial acknowledged that Soviet territory east of the Ural Mountains would not be cov­ered. But he said the United States had other detection means of making sure the Sovi­ets do not store tanks and other arms in excess of treaty ceilings.

You know it's true-Milli Vanilli never sang
Homeless shelter to expand 
Special to the Observer 
A major expansion of South Bend's Center for the Homeless will be dedicated by religious, civic, municipal and University leaders beginning at 11 a.m. Saturday. 
Among the special guests at the dedication will be Edward Hennessy, chairman and chief executive officer of Allied-Signal Inc., which last year gave $400,000 to Notre Dame to make the Center expansion possible. Also present will be Notre Dame president Father Edward Malloy; Mayor Joseph Kernan of South Bend; Father Richard Warner, chair of the Center's executive committee; Eugenia Schwartz, vice president of the United Religious Community (URC); Mary Jane Bagatini of the Junior League; and David Link, dean of the Notre Dame Law School and president of the Council of Providers of Services to the Homeless. 
Also present will be the 14 members of the Center's new council of advisors, a group of area business leaders who advise on and support Center activities. 
The new construction in the Center includes 13 family rooms, a new dormitory which can accommodate 40 women, a children's playroom for activities organized by Junior League volunteers, triple the office space for Madison Center programs in support of mentally ill and addicted people, a prayer room for Center guests and staff, expanded office space for a legal aid clinic staffed by Notre Dame law students and finished office space for future tenant agencies in the Center. 
NEW YORK (AP) -The ru­mors are true: Milli Vanilli ­those dreadlocked, hunky dudes Rob and Fab -never actually sang on their debut album that sold 7 million copies, the producer-arranger conceded. 
"The record company never knew that. I never told them anything," said Frank Farian, the German producer who turned a pair of anonymous pretty boys into an interna­tional phenomenon. "Later on, after the record was out, there were some people who raised some questions." 
The questions were never re­ally answered as the Vanillis won a 1989 Grammy for Best New Artist. an award they may now lose. Rob Pilatus and Fab Morvan became international stars, lip-syncing their way through television and concert appearances. ­
"Girl You Know It's True" and "Blame It On the Rain" were huge hit singles for the band. At the MTV awards, the boys boasted they were better than Elvis or Bob Dylan. 
Farian -who has a new al­bum with a new group coming out in January -said he was forced to go public with the revelations when the band told him they wanted to sing on the follow-up to "Girl You Know It's True." 
"I said, 'No. I don't go for that.' Sure, they have a voice, but that's not really what I want to use on my records," said Farian, describing the en­counter that occurred earlier this month. 
So the bare-chested vocalists once described by The New York Times as "exotically sexy" really did nothing but look good and lip sync for videos? 
"Nothing more," Farian said through an interpreter during an interview here Wednesday. 
A telephone message left 
Thursday to the group's man­ager in Germany was not im­mediately returned. Michael Greene, president of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, said the Millis may be stripped of their Grammy. 
"If there's been a substantial, fraudulent, misrepresentation of the entity, I think there is a high likelihood that the academy would have to take some action," Greene said from Los Angeles. 
Including taking the Grammy back? 
"Sure," said Greene, adding that no one has ever been stripped of a Grammy in its 33 years. 
Farian's revelation didn't bother Arista, the label that sold "Girl You Know It's True." 
"Seven million albums? Embarrassing?" asked Roy Lott, vice president for opera­tions at Arista. "I don't mean the end justifies the means. But we sold 7 million albums." 
Lott said there was no reason to doubt Farian's veracity: "I certainly assume the producer would know who sang on the record." 
According to Farian, the idea to hire Rob and Fab as front men for the band came to him when the fabulous bunko boys arrived at his studio in Germany shortly after the recording of "Girl You Know It's True." 
"It suddenly clicked in my mind, and it was kind of evi­dent: I had the music, there were the people who wanted to perform outside," said Farian. "And I said, "Hey, let's put that together and make a great record out of it."' 
Farian would not say who the real singers were but added that they will appear on his next album -not a Milli Vanilli album.

Key Arab leaders dash chances for summit on crisis 
(AP)-Chances for an emer­gency Arab summit to resolve the Persian Gulf crisis appeared dead Thursday as key leaders rejected the idea. Despite Iraqi protests, U.S. and Saudi forces launched "Imminent Thunder" -a six-day amphibious exer­cise reportedly only miles from Kuwait. 
1\vo more Americans arrived in Amman, Jordan, on a regu­larly scheduled flight from Baghdad. A U.S. Embassy spokesman said the two were 
U.S. diplomats, but it was un­clear whether they had worked in Kuwait or Iraq. 
The Americans arrived along with 24 other foreigners -22 Irish citizens, one Dutch na­tiona! and one Briton. They all were medical personnel from a foreign-run hospital in Bagh­dad. 
The official Iraqi News Agency announced on Thursday that President Bush would go "on trial" in absentia next month in Algeria -for "inhuman policies and planning aggression against the people of Iraq." 
The trial will begin Dec. 10 in Algiers, INA said, in what it called an international court of justice. 
It said the verdict would be relayed to U.N. Secretary-Gen­eral Javier Perez de Cuellar and international groups concerned with human rights. 
Iraq first spoke of putting Bush on trial in September, after Western leaders said Saddam Hussein should be tried for war crimes. 
Presidents Hafez Assad of Syria and Hosni Mubarak of Egypt became the latest Arab leaders to reject the emergency Arab summit, which was billed by the king of Morocco as per­haps the "last chance" for 
peace. 
Saudi Arabia said Wednesday it would not participate in the meeting unless Baghdad promised beforehand to leave Kuwait, which it invaded Aug. 
2. Iraq made it clear that no such promise was forthcoming. 
In a joint statement released in Damascus, Assad and Mubarak said they also rejected the idea because of Iraq's in­transigence. And in Jiddah, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait's gov-ernment-in-exile also objected, citing Iraq's refusal to with­draw. 
The objections effectively killed chances for the summit. A few Arab League members, including Sudan and the Pales­tine Liberation Organization, had agreed to Morocco's pro­posal. 
Both Syria and Egypt have contributed troops to the 300,000-strong U.S.-led multi­national force confronting Iraq. 
The appeal on Sunday by King Hassan II of Morocco for Arab leaders to gather pro­voked a flurry of diplomatic ac­tivity. Among those trying to promote the summit was the Soviet Union, which sent high-level envoys to the Middle East this week to discuss the idea. 
The exact location of lmmi­nent Thunder, which began Thursday, was not revealed, and a news blackout was im­posed for the initial phases of the operation. 
The operation involves 1,000 
U.S. Marines, 1,100 aircraft and 16 ships. Iraq has termed it a "provocative act" because it is being held close to occupied Kuwait. 
There have been three previ­ous amphibious exercises in the Persian Gulf, but they were be­lieved to have been held farther south. The Washington Times reported Wednesday that lm­minent Thunder would be held 10 miles from Kuwait. No live ammunition will be fired in the operation, U.S. officials say. But it will involve the largest use of aircraft in a single training exercise since U.S. forces were deployed in the region in August. 
Imminent Thunder is not in­tended to provoke the Iraqis, said U.S. Navy spokesman Cmdr. J.D. Van Sickle. 
"The purpose is to give par­ticipating forces training in joint and combined operations and to enhance amphibious warfare skills," he said. 
Military officials said there was no particular significance to the name of the operation and that its timing was not linked to any operational plans. 
The United States has dou­bled the number of aircraft carriers in the gulf region to six, and ordered in about 200,000 additional military personnel to join the estimated 230,000 already deployed. The multinational force arrayed against Iraq numbers more

In other developments, Secre­tary of State James Baker III headed Thursday to Brussels, on his way to yet another round of consultations with foreign leaders. 
Baker was to meet Friday with the 12-nation European Community, which is providing aid to countries who have been hit hard by the trade embargo against Iraq. 
Over the weekend, he was to meet with the foreign ministers of three African countries as well as Romania and Finland. 
Elsewhere on the diplomatic front, Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati was in Iraq on Thursday, meeting with Saddam and visiting Moslem shrines. 
Velayati, the highest-ranking Iranian to visit Iraq since the 1979 Islamic revolution in Iran, said he had made it clear to Saddam and other senior offi­cials that Tehran wanted Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait. 
The two countries fought each other for nearly a decade during the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war.

Bush endorses clean air bill 
WASHINGTON (AP} -Presi­dent Bush, saying every Ameri­can "deserves to breathe clsan air," on Thursday signed an ex­tensive overhaul of the nation's anti-pollution law to curb acid rain, urban smog and toxic chemicals. 
Susan Merrow, president of the Sierra Club, described the Clean Air Act of 1990 as "a breath of fresh air after a 10­year smog alert." 
Bush said the bill, which up­dates and tightens federal air pollution standards for the first time since 1977, was "simply the most significant air pollution legislation in our na­tion's history." 
"This bill means cleaner cars, cleaner power plants, cleaner factories and cleaner fuels. And it means a cleaner America," Bush said at a packed White House ceremony. 
The goal of the legislation is to cut acid rain pollutants by half, sharply reduce urban smog and eliminate most of the toxic chemical emissions from industrial plants by the turn of the century. 
The cost of adhering to the regulations is expected to be as much as $25 billion a year. 
Environmental groups tern­porarily put aside their differ­ences with the president on other issues to praise his effort on clean air. But they said the effectiveness of the legislation would require aggressive im­plementation and enforcement by the federal government. 
Richard Ayers, chairman of the National Clean Air Coali­tion, called the legislation "cause for celebration and hope." 
But Ruth Caplan, executive director of Environmental Ac­tion, said Bush's signature marked "only the first step to­ward cleaning up our air. There are dozens of provisions that must be implemented through regulation." 
Industry representatives, facing large compliance costs, were more muted in their ap­proval. 
"While business supports the act's clean air objectives, its costs to American consumers and workers cannot be sugar­coated," said William Fay, administrator of the Clean Air Working Group, a coalition of 2,000 businesses and trade as­sociations. 
Bush's signature capped a decade-long debate over anti­pollution rules. The legislation was the product of 16 months of intensive wrangling among administration and congres­sional negotiators over a myr­iad of technical provisions. 
The new law requires tougher emission controls on cars, and requires service stations to sell cleaner-burning gas. It man­dates new equipment in thou­sands of businesses and facto­ries to capture smog-causing pollutants and toxic chemicals. 
It also requires coal-burning power plants to cut in half sul­fur dioxide emissions, which cause acid rain. 
Some of the new requirements will begin to be phased in within a few years, but most won't be fully in place until the end of the decade. Some cities with the worst smog problems have as long as 15 to 20 years to meet federal air require­ments. 
Bush, fulfilling a campaign promise, proposed in July 1989 a broad rewrite of the clean air laws. Earlier efforts to revamp the laws had been blocked by strong opposition from eco­nomic and regional interests and the Reagan administration.

FBI obtains CNN's Noriega tapes to network's protests 
ATlANTA (AP) -The FBI said Thursday it had obtained CNN tapes and was checking whether they are Manuel Nor­iega recordings at the center of a court battle. The network protested that the tapes were obtained without a warrant. 
The FBI said the tapes turned up in a hotel lost-and-found department. Cable News Net­work said the material was taken from a room that been occupied by one of its reporters at the Omni Hotel, part of a complex that also houses CNN's offices. 

The network is seeking to overturn a federal judge's order blocking it from airing taped jailhouse conversations between the deposed Panama­nian dictator Noriega and his lawyers. 
Turner Security, which pro­vides security for the complex, had notified FBI agents about the box of materials, the net­work said. 
The network said the FBI agents had no warrant and acted over the objections of a CNN attorney, and it demanded that the tapes be returned. 
In Washington, FBI spokesman Scott Nelson con­
firmed authorities obtained 
some CNN tapes without a sub­
poena. 
"We were made aware of the 
tapes and merely picked them 
up for analysis," Nelson said. 
CNN President Tom Johnson said he personally protested the FBI's action "in the strongest terms" to agency officials in Washington. 
The network said a Turner Security official called the FBI because agents had told him they were looking for "stolen government property." The network said the material was not stolen. 
Omni hotel officials claimed the room occupied by CNN re­porter Marlyn Fernandez had been vacated and that the box of materials given to hotel se­curity, CNN said. Johnson said "it's in dispute" whether the room was vacated by Fernan­dez, who normally anchors CNN's Spanish-language tele­casts in Washington but had been working on the Noriega case. 
CNN's chief counsel, Steve Korn, said he later told the FBI that the hotel had no authority to turn the material over.

MISSIONARIES 
Fulfilling one's life through a missionary vocation 
~ 
The Pontifical Institute for Foreign Missions (\he PIME Missionaries) is an international com­munity of Catholic priests and laymen who make a lifelong commitment to continuing the misalon of Jesus Christ in the modem world. We live the Gospel in Bangladesh. Brazil, Hong Kong, India, Japan, Myanmar, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Taiwan, Thailand and West Africa among the poor and unchurched. 

Founded in Italy in 1850, a group of dioCe­san priests, at the encouragement of their bishope, grew in their understanding ol just pre­cisely what God was calling them to be. A mis­sionary must be open to dialogue, prayer and selfless sefVice. especially to the poor. The mis­sionary mustleam how to be a sign of shared faith between well established European and AmeriCan local churches and peoples where the Church is just beginning. The missionary must know how to announce the Kingdom of God while btiing a Ioree for transformation of those societal values which do not bu~cl up that Kingdom. 
II you are a young man between 1B_and 35, in good health and spirits, excited to hve your faith in the missionary way described above. send in or call for infonnation today.

Expression Committee" to make decisions regarding cen­sorship. 
On page 62, du Lac states, "Student media should be free of censorship and advance ap­proval of copy, and their editors and managers should be free to develop their own editorial policies and news coverage ... All student media are subject to the same policies that govern all student organizations." 
It continues, "Editors and managers of student media which are supported by recog­nized University bodies ... should be protected from arbitrary suspension and removal be­cause of student, faculty, ad­ministrative or public disap­proval of editorial policy or content. .. " 
On the subject of unofficial student publications, du Lac states, "The University of Notre Dame should not prohibit the orderly distribution of student literature on campus except that which could be reasonably construed to be in violation of the law." 
The main problem with du Lac's statement is that it says "should be free" instead of "are free," said Singh. 
"Du Lac is too ambiguous on the issue of campus media," he added. 
The Task Force plans on get­ting outside input on the cam­pus media section of the Legal Department report, Pasin said. 
"The Task Force will formu­late a policy in consultation with leaders of the campus me­dia," he said. 
By proposing the idea of "limited recognition" of campus organizations, the Legal De­partment tried to please groups on both sides of the issue. 
"We tried to find a balance between minority support and defending the Catholic charac­ter of the school," said Singh. 
There are a lot of mixed opinions among students about recognition of groups that go against doctrines of the Church, and the recommendations had to take that into consideration, according to Singh. 
The "Catholic character" that Singh mentions comes from du Lac page 54 that says a club's purpose "must be consistent with the University's mission,

whether it be spiritual, moral, intellectual, cultural, social, athletic or recreational." 
Du Lac adds that, "No orga­nization, or member of any or­ganization on behalf of the or­ganization, may encourage or participate in any activity which contravenes the mission of the University, or the moral teach­ings of the Catholic Church." 
Under the Legal Department report's recommendation, lim­ited recognition could be given to groups which might contra­vene the mission of the Univer­sity or the teachings of the Church. Limited recognition would allow these groups ac­cess to University meeting space and allow them "limited sponsorship" of "educational or awareness-type events" such as lectures or panel discussions. 
However, unlike fully recog­nized groups, clubs with limited recognition would be denied ac­cess to funding and fundraising as well as recognition on official University listings. 
The suggestions regarding group recognition were pur­posely not intrusive or challeng­ing so as to avoid infringing on students who came to Notre Dame because of its Catholic orientation, said Singh. 
"Student government's rec­ommendations should embody consideration for those who come to NO for the Catholic character," he added. 
Another proposal of the re­port is the continuation of the University's "Open speaker" policy. This policy states, "Notre Dame students and student organizations are free to examine and discuss all ques­tions of interest to them, and to express opinions publicly and privately. They should exercise this freedom by the use of orderly means which do not tial operation of the University." 
"Notre Dame students may invite and hear any person of their choosing," it adds. 
The fourth proposal of the report calls for the availability of space for "any individual or group if their purpose is to ex­press a legitimate idea." 
Presently. du Lac states, "All demonstrations must be regis­tered with the Associate Vice President for Residence Life and also must observe the fol­lowing rules: 
a. 
All demonstrations must be peaceful and orderly. 

b. 
Only members of the Uni­versity community may orga­nize or lead a demonstration on campus. 

c. 
Demonstrations may not impede the freedom of the Uni­versity community. 


This recommendation basi­cally would give individuals not associated with any recognized group the right to express any idea of legitimate interest pub­licly. 
In order to determine which individuals and groups should be allowed to demonstrate, the report also proposes the for­mation of a "Freedom of Ex­pression Committee" to handle all decisions regarding censor­ship. 
The committee would make final decisions "regarding all issues of censorship including, but not limited to, student me­dia, organized activity, and group status," the report says. 
The committee is made up of seven members: four faculty members chosen by the Faculty Senate, two student members chosen by the Student Senate and one administrator chosen by the Vice President for Stu­dent Affairs. 
"This committee is critical to make our recommendations, subjective lines, practical and effective," the report states. 
These five recommendations could change drastically before they are brought before the CLC, said Singh. 
The report on freedom of ex­pression is in very rough form right now, he added. 
While the issues of collective punishment, judgement by peers and freedom of expres­sion have been worked on ex­tensively by the Legal Depart­ment, the issue of open hear­ings is not really a priority, ac­cording to Singh. 
Presently, on the subject of administrative hearings, du Lac states, "Hearings are conducted before a panel of two or three Residence Life staff members and are closed to all but principal parties, witnesses, undergraduate student counsel and appropriate residence hall staff." 
Because they were not even sure if the students wanted their hearings open to the pub­lic, the Legal Department "decided it wasn't worth pursu­ing," said Singh. 
The need for public disclosure of hearings brought up the is­of trust, Singh said. 
"It's an issue of trust, if we need the Administration to be accountable for every facet of the proceedings, we're not showing trust in them," he said. 
Singh also believes examina­tion of other issues is more valuable. 
"The issue of judgement by peers was more important than open hearings," he said. 
Now, the Legal Department, the Task Force and the CLC will work on compiling a report on the issues of judgement by peers, collective punishment and freedom of expression. This report will assimilate the ideas of the original Bill of Student Rights for presentation to O'Hara.' 
If O'Hara accepts the recom­mendations, some the points brought forth last Spring could become part of du Lac, and thus, become official University policy. 
"The overall aim of the Bill of Rights was to incorporate stu­dents more fully into the deci­sion-making process," said Pasin. 
This aim could become reality once the Bill of Rights is re­worked to the satisfaction of all parties involved.

Americans need to take a stand against pornography 
Dear Editor: 
Illegal drugs and alcohol have recently been receiving the at­tention that they deserve for their destructiveness of human life and limb. On the other hand, pornography, for all of its magnified evil, has not had sufficient light shed on it. The problem is exacerbated when one considers that 50 percent of Americans do not take ad­vantage of their francise of voting in order to change per­sons, places and things for the better. It is axiomatic that the Soviet Union, China, Cuba and the Moslem nations do not al­low pornography or obscenity to cross their borders. 
In the struggle against pornography, a common ground must be found-especially for those who do not realize the seriousness of this phenomenon, those who are unable to protect themselves from this evil, and those who are confused as how to proceed in combating it. 
Pornography debases, demeans and reduces the 
human person to the compost pile. It reinforces the subordination and mutilization of women and children. There is no division between hard core and so-called "soft core" pornography; it is all pornography. It has been estimated that pornography is a 8 million dollar industry and is growing. 
Why does pornography con­tinue to proliferate in such proportions? One study con-eludes that there are four basic reasons: (1) Lack of a spiritual

Thnnel vision abounds, and it has certainly found a home surrounding this art form.

combating pornography is that there seems to be no. universally accepted author­itative definition of the term. Justice Stewart of the U.S. Supreme Court once remarked, "I don't know how to define the term pornography, but I know it when I see it." 
Pornography is not rational; It is patently evil and total licentious. The limitations of freedom of expression have had 
little light shed upon them. 
Censorship may be unfortunate, 
but it is surely less evil than 
exploitation and en­
couragement of hate and de­
humanization of women and 
children. 
Pornography must not be al­lowed to spread scornful and wicked messages of sexual ag­gression, torture and the total disregard for the person. In a pluralistic society like America's, it is difficult to find a common ground in order to meet this menace of pornography. A common understanding must be found, however, to protect the moral lives held dear in America. 
Pornography has no relation­ship to sex or sexuality whatsoever; It is anti-sex. It attempts to destroy the true meaning of sex and sexuality. Sex and sexuality are men and women created in God's image. Sex and sexuality are men and women joined together in Holy Matrimony, cooperating with their Creator in a tender and loving relationship. It is meet­ing each other's deepest needs in tenderness and warmth. 
Sex and sexuality are our children. Their honesty. Their innocence. Their trustfulness. Their need to be appreciated, listened to, encouraged, corrected and praised for a task well done. 
Do we not all have the moral responsibility to safeguard the moral integrity of each other? America and Americans deserve better than this blight that is pornography.

ave you been unimpressed with Renoir lately? Has Picasso left you blue? Get a fresh perspective on your art outlook and visit the Snite Mu­seum's new exhibit of African Art from the Rita and John Grunwald Collection. It opens Sunday, November 18 and re­mains in the O'Shaughnessy Gallery West until December 30, 1990. 
Also on Sunday, from 3-4 p.m., Diane Perline, curator of the Art of Africa, Oceania and the Americas at Indiana University Art Museum, Bloom­ington,and also the exhibit's organizer will give an opening lecture on the exhibit. 
Sixty-two pieces constitute the traveling portion of the Grunwald's complete collection, which is located in their home in Bloomington, Indiana. Ac­cording to Douglas E. Bradley, curator of ethnographic arts at the Snite, the Grunwald's col­lection of African art is special because over the last 20 years, the Grunwalds "have devoted so much time and care to the collection, and also made deliberate choices in the art they wanted in their collection and pursued those pieces." 
In smaller, private collections such as the Grunwalds, each piece has an even greater role in contributing to the overall statement the collection is try­ing to make. 
Bradley said of the pieces in their collection,"The Grunwalds keep three things in mind when

nowhere. Instead of 
a resolution, utter 
puzzlement lies at the top rung. Questions only multiply the further you climb. 
Yet maybe the Adrian Lyne film is the inevitable result when the creators of such bizarre movies as "Fatal Attraction," "9 1/2 Weeks," "Angel Heart," and "Ghost," combine their efforts. 
"Jacob's Ladder" explores the life of Jacob Singer (Tim Robbins) who is haunted by un­explainable hallucinations and terrifying events, leaving him unable to decipher reality from nightmare. However, neither can we. 
For the majority of the film, "reality" is undefinable, as the scenes progress in such a unique way as to establish a number of different lives for Singer. The problem lies in try­ing to recognize the illusions. 
As soon as the audience 
seems satisfied that Singer is a

considering a piece for their exhibit: first, what they are do­ing as individuals at that time and whether the piece fits their concept of where the collection should be heading. Secondly, they rely also on what the art market dictates at the time (if a piece is overpriced, for exam­ple.) Thirdly, they try to get a sense of whether the piece is aesthetically pleasing. 
Aesthetically pleasing, how­ever, does not always imply beauty. "The Grunwalds arpn'l worried about whether the pieces clash with their couch", Bradley pointed out. Indeed,

office and living with one of his 
fellow employees, Jezzie 
(Elizabeth Pena), the scenes 
shift and he is the loving father 
and husband to a woman who 
had supposedly left him years 
ago. 

The unexpected leaves you 
tense in your seat and antici­
pating the next surprise, but 
ready to doubt its validity. After 
awhile, however, the shifts 
become annoying and Singer's 
insanity is too close for comfort. 
Even we cannot find the -stability that we crave. 
Singer's chiropractor and 
loyal friend, Louis (Danny 
Aiello). serves as the angelic 
figure of the film-a desper­
ately needed character for such 
a film. He continually reminds 
Singer of the importance of ac­
cepting death, as opposed to 
fearfully clinging too tightly to 
aspects of the past. 

Not only is Louis the only one 
who can relax Singer, but his 
advice also provides one of the 
few hints as to the film's mes­
sage-by digging into the hu­
man psyche and exposing deep 
fears and unconscious terror on the Grunwalds might have to worry about positioning their pieces in their house because that's where they keep all of them, out in the open, as the art was originally intended to be viewed. 
Bradley says of the way in which art can be displayed, "When a piece of art is kept in a glass case, you just can just walk by it because it's been somehow removed from your external surroundings by being encased. But, if, especially in this instance (a rather large and ugly wild boar), the piece is displayed without any glass

Led Zeppelin's self-titled four CD boxed set, released in late October, captures the various phases and moods the band moved through in their career, from the youthful urgency of "Whole Lotta Love" to the wist­ful, retrospective closer, "All My Love." 
Ever since the band's incep­tion in 1968, Zeppelin has been a powerful force in the blues­rock movement and at the same time has been slagged by critics through most of its flight. However, ten years after the death of drummer John Bon­ham and the subsequent breakup of the band, Zeppelin fans old and new are as rabid as ever, and this CD package should satisfy their appetite. 
Four "new" tracks accom­pany 50 songs selected by gui­tarist Jimmy Page from amongst Zeppelin's 84-song magnum opus. These unre­leased works hold their own against the rock classics ap­pearing on the set. 
One, "Hey, Hey What Can I Do," the only legendary Zep­pelin song not to appear on an album, actually was previously released as the B-side of the "Immigrant Song." It appears on CD for the first time here, and the effect is noticable. Page's acoustic guitar sounds incredibly clean, and Plant's voice melts nicely with the folk­based tune. The bizarre guitar intro is barely audible. 
"Traveling Riverside Blues," a relentless, Robert Johnson-in­fluenced slab of pure blues­rock, is the best of the new tracks. Performed in 1969 for BBC Radio, the song is textbook early Zeppelin-Plant belting out recognizable blues stanzas over a raucous Page riff, backed by sparkling perfor­mances by the rhythm section. 
Bonham shuffling bass drum has a life of its own. This track is several times better than many on the compilation album "Coda," and even tops some appearing on "real" Zeppelin albums. 
"Moby Uick/Bonzo's Mon­treaux" is a combination of two earlier releases, Bonham's two studio drum tracks. The solos fit perfectly together. Although the mix is seamless, the final product smacks of the sound created when today's bands, mostly rap groups, sample segments of Zeppelin's music as a backing track for a new song. Page tampered with this piece more than any other, and it barely succeeds. 
"White Summer/Black Moun­tain Side" is an eight-minute, almost exclusively guitar based instrumental piece. Only axe buffs or heavy-duty Zeppelin fans will find much in this track worth listening to. 
Page, producer of all Zeppelin albums, conceived of this boxed set as a reason to remaster all of the old songs for CD. The sound is quite clear and in many cases fuller than in the records and even the previous CDs. 
The only clearly noticable dif­ferences in the actual songs oc­cur in "Heartbreaker," in which Page's mistake-laden guitar solo is cleaned up considerably, probably to the satisfaction of casual listeners, but to the dis­may of hardcore fans accus­
page 15 
tomed to every missed note and the choppy continuity. 
More emphasis is given to the bass guitar in several songs. These changes do not take away from the songs, but re­quire the listener to hear an old tune from a different point of view. 
For a band who rarely re­leased singles and meant each album to be taken as a whole, the running order of the indi­vidual songs gains extra impor­tance. Though loosely arranged in chronological order, some interesting pairings do occur. 
Those who expect to hear "Living Loving Maid" after "Heartbreaker" will be sur­prised that playing "Communication Breakdown" directly afterward improves both songs and brings a more coherent perspective to each. 
A few questionable choices were made, such as including "Candy Store Rock" and "Ozone Baby" to the exclusion of songs such as "Out on the Tiles." The most glaring omissions were "Living Loving Maid" and "Good Times, Bad Times." 
Despite these faults. the col­lection is a formidable lineup of well known classics and lesser known songs which may now enjoy a greater popularity. "Achilles' Last Stand" and "Wearing and Tearing" are two likely candidates. 
The packaging of the discs does not shy away from the elements of mystery and the oc­cult present in many of Zep­pelin's album covers. The golden box cover depicts the shadow of a Zeppelin hovering over a field into which are cut strange markings. The covers of the individual discs feature the band's famous Four Sym­bols (from the untitled fourth album) cleverly hidden or ob­scured in four separate pho­tographs.

wall around it, you can't help but stop and truly see it every time you walk by." 
The personal stamp on the collection that develops from daily contact is one reason why the Grunwald exhibit is so fas­cinating; and as Bradley pointed out, "That's why it's such an interesting collection-­because we not only get to see excellent representatives of various African art styles, but we also get an insight into the evolution of the Grunwald's in­terests." 
And what exactly is the focus

over certain incidents, he al­ways retains a sort of numb­ness to the terror plaguing him. We never quite know what he's thinking behind his sneaky, de­mon eyes. But then again, nei­ther does he. 
The film is not always pleas­ant to watch. Singer's halluci­
of the Grunwald's interests? 
Over half of the pieces repre­
sented in the Snite's exhibit 
deal with the human figure. "I 
see the focus of this collection 
as definitely the figure, seen 
through various different 
African cultures, "Bradley said. 
Bradley also highlighted a few of the exceptional pieces in the exhibit. Particularly out­standing is the Chowke Pipe figure from the late 19th cen­tury. The Chowke people live in Angola, a southern savannah region, and they tend to share broad cultural patterns that are often reflected in the sculptures they produce. 
"The figure is an excellent representative of what the Chowke were trying to say about the human body in an el­egant way," Bradley said. "One large Chowke warrior was sold recently for one million dollars. The Grunwalds, however, be­lieve that instead of spending a huge amount of money on a large flashy item and then skimp on the other pieces, they should seek a more representa­tive sampling of African art," Bradley stated. 
The oldest pieces in the ex­hibit are from the city of Jenne in Mali and from Akan. These pieces date back respectively to 9th-10th century and 17th-18th century Africa. 
Overall, Bradley believes the exhibit is enriching because it allows people to "expose them­selves to a different way of looking at the world." The ex­hibit is also an excellent re­source for the museum, be.­cause, in Bradley's words, its "good to bring in new things so you can refresh your eye." 
nations include the disturbing images of whirring, vibrating heads, like those from a Francis Bacon painting, as well as a trip through a filthy hospital ward filled with amputated body parts. 
Yet the most startling aspect of such psychological thriller gore is its occurrence solely from Singer's point of view, not from an omniscient one which tends to suggest reality. Singer can never escape through a back door or open window; the hell is inside his head. 
Near the end of "Jacob's Ladder," a seemingly eye-open­ing explanation is given for all of the puzzling shifts in Singer's life-the results of a horrifying wartime experiment. The actual conclusion, however, turns the movie upside down, and all of a sudden you have to rethink everything. 
The whole plot is called into question, and the reality of Singer's life appears to have existed only in the opening and closing few minutes of the film...or does it? If nothing else, the film, with all of its unanswered questions, lingers.

How the_ martyr becomes a saint 
Dr. Samuel Johnson said: "Every man has a right to what he thinks is truth, and every other man has the right to knock him down for it. Martyrdom is the test." 
Cynics have told us, "Martyrdom has always been a proof of the intensity, never the correctness of a belief. There is no religion so irrational but can boast its martyrs." 
Some saints might have gone unnoticed for a lifetime if they hadn't eventually given them­selves away by becoming mar­tyrs. You know it must mean something when your neighbor starts shedding his blood for a cause. 
The one widely-acknowledged saint that I have stood close to twice in my life is Dorothy Day. In England, she's pictured wearing a halo. Yet none of the down-on-their-luck men and women who lived with Dorothy Day at the Catholic Worker House in Manhattan would tol­erate the idea that Dorothy could be a saint. They'd grow angry and snarl at you for mentioning the idea. 
Dorothy herself said: "I'm tired of hearing myself called 'saintly.' Such a way of disre­garding what we all have to do in our own way-follow God's lead! To call me 'saintly' is to rob me and cheat me of my very humanity! I am as mean and nasty in my head and heart as all the rest of us here. Every day we fall spiritually. Who is an exception to that-who gets 
' . an A plus in the eyes of God? Not me! Just this morning I was thinking of someone I know with a terrible anger and scorn in my heart! I tried to

a glass of wine, which he ac­cepted, told him he was going 
Letters to a Lonely God to die on the spot-the last Christian, the last man on earth who still believed. 
forget the person. I worked on the soupline, serving others in order to help myself a little." 
Yet Dorothy had her own specialized vocation; as she ex­plains it, "God has given us a moment to be worthy of His love. This is what we must do, all our lives, in every possible way, until He calls us back." 
Mother Teresa says: "We can do no great things; only small things with great love." 
Graham Greene has an essay in which he asks if Christianity is in peril. His answer begins: "I feel as though I am surrounded by shadows ... Christianity is something that happens somewhere else, beyond my range of vision, perhaps in an­other country, certainly in an­other he'art. I cannot touch the words unless they are given a human shape. The Apostle Thomas should be the patron saint of people in my country. For we must see the marks of the nails and put our hands in the wounds before we can un­derstand ..." 
'fhen he gives us the scenario for a fantasy he once hoped to write. It takes place in the fu­ture, when the world is gov­erned by a single all powerful political party. The curtain rises on a cheap hotel in a large city. It is late at night. A tired old man, wearing a shabby coat, carrying a beat-up suit­case comes into the lobby. Going up to the reception desk, been given the grace of faith. 
Had the Dictator been greater, or had he been weaker, things might have turned out differently for the Pope. Marianne Moore said: "It is easier to be faithful than to have faith, and to act with courage than to suffer with patience." 
T.S. Eliot's Beckett says: "I give my lifeffo the Law of God above the Law of Man.ffhose Who do not the same/How should they know what I do .. I am not in danger; only near to death." 
The mere martyr becomes the saint when he is able to say, "I am not in danger; only near to death." 
the register, then disappears upstairs. 
The house detective looks at the register, then says to the room clerk: 
"Did you see who that was?" 
"No." 
"It's the Pope." 
"The Pope? Who's that?" 
Catholicism has been stamped out. Only the Pope survives, elected 30 years before at the last conclave, to rule over a Church, which has virtually 
The Dictator took a revolver out of his desk. After allowing the Pope a minute to pray, he shot him in the left side of the chest. Leaning over the body, he fired a second shot in the Pope's head. 
At just that instant, in the second between the pressure on the trigger and the skull crack­ing, a thought crossed the Dictator's mind-"Is it possible that what this man believed is true?" Another Christian had 
ceased to exist. After the con­clave, the cardinals had met the fate of the rest of the priests­a white wall and a firing squad. But the Pope was authorized to live, pensioned by the govern­ment because he is of use in demonstrating how dead the 
Church is. 
The Pope drifts here and there, driven on by hope that somewhere he will encounter a sign to show him that the Faith has survived, and that he no longer needed to be haunted by the fear that what he had pro­fessed to be eternal might die with him. 
Eventually, the World Dictator tires of the game, and he wants a place in history as the man who fired the shot which put an end to the Christian myth. 
So the Pope is brought into the Dictator's secret, sound­proof room. There in the padded silence, the Dictator,

By RENE FERRAN Sports Writer 
Defending champion Howard and Gold Division champion Breen-Phillips will meet Sunday at 1 p.m. for the 1990 women's interhall football championship. 
Third-seeded Howard has gone relatively unnoticed throughout the season. While 
B.P. and Pasquerilla West re­ceived most of the attention, Howard quietly compiled a 4-1 regular season record. 
"It seems like no one thinks about Howard as a strong team," said Howard running back Marianne Haggarty. "The whole year, people have been overlooking us, but we have shown we deserve to be men­tioned with B.P. as a power in the league." 
Howard barely squeaked by OfT-Campus in the first round of the playoffs, and then came back from an 8-0 halftime deficit to defeat Blue Division champion P.W. 12-8 in the semifinals. 
"I think we showed a lot of spirit. Although we were down at halftime, we came together as a team and told each other we could do it," said Haggarty. 
The Howard offense started the season very conservatively, but as the weeks went by, it gradually opened up more as the team adjusted to the new blocking rules instituted this year. It is led by quarterback Elise Seguin, running back Becky Miller, and wide receiver Theresa Forst. 
The defense will suffer if linebacker Kathy Keenan has to sit the game out with an injury. Howard will still shine on de­fense, however, with linebacker Kelly Kolodziej and cornerback Margaret Shane leading the way. 
Top-seed B.P. has relied on a strong defense to guide it to a divisional championship. Led by linebackers Alicia McNeill and Kate Mapother and safety Carrie Goles, the Blitz gave up less than six points per game in the regular season. 
"We have lots of unity on our team this year. When we get out there, we just won't quit," said Mapother. "The offense and the defense did a great job of supporting each other." 
That offense has its own ver­sion of the "Rocket" in running back Kristi Alkidas, who can break a long gain on any given play. She and quarterback Kim Smith will need to have big games for the Blitz to win. 
Co-captain Kristin Ballard believes the key to victory on Sunday will be maintaining the intensity B.P. had in defeating archrival Farley 12-0 last week. 
"We just need to relax and to play strong on both offense and defense," said Ballard. "Last week was awesome, and we hope to keep it up." 
This game could be similar to their regular season matchup early in the year. Howard led 14-0 with six minutes remain­ing when the Blitz exploded for two touchdowns to tie the score. In overtime, Smith hit Lisa Petursson from the five to give B.P. the lead, and then stopped Howard on two plays to preserve the 20-14 victory. 
Both teams are evenly matched. The difference in the game may be Alkidas. She has big-play capability, and can break open a game at any time. If she gets free, she could carry Breen-Phillips right to the championship. 

Another key to the game could be PAT's. Both teams have had difficulty with conver­sions throughout the playoffs. Don't be surprised if the margin of victory in this game is a missed PAT.

Late score boosts Iowa, Irish next foe in the NIT 
IOWA CITY. Iowa (AP) -Acie Earl scored down low with six seconds to play Thursday night to lead Iowa, the ninth-place team in the Big Ten last season, to a 73-71 victory over No. 19 Temple in the opening round of the Big Apple NIT. 
Iowa will play at Notre Dame on Saturday night in the second round. Notre Dame beat Fordham 56-46 on Thursday night. 
Temple had all five starters back from last year's 20-11 team which played in the NCAA Tournament after winning the Atlantic 10. 
Temple trailed 46-41 at half­time and didn't take the lead until Donald Hodge put the 
Owls up 69-68 with 2:51 to play. 
Mark Macon gave Temple a 71-68 lead with 56 seconds to play, but Val Barnes' three­pointer from the top of the key made it 71~ 71 with 43 seconds left. Temple took a timeout but Iowa stole the ball with 19 sec· onds remaining. 
Kevin Smith drove into the paint and dished it off to Earl. who finished with 18 points. Macon misfired a long jumper as time expired. 
Barnes fmished with 15 points for the Hawkeyes, who were 12-16last season. 
Hodge and Vic Carstarphen each had 19 points to lead Temple. Hodge went 9-for-9 from the field.

don't need any superstars," ex­plained Piane. "You just need a few guys who will do it for you every day of the week, and for­tunately that's just what we have." 
A modest Cahill stated that he was pleased with his consistent running this season because it has allowed him to help the team more consistently. Cahill's goals parallel the team goals, and he is hopeful about the team's chances at the NCAA Finals. 
"It's great to have my last year be as good as this year has been," said Cahill, "and I hope that this last meet will be the culmination of four year's work. The fact that we won districts for the first time sums up the season, and we want to carry that momentum into the NCAA's and hopefully run our best." 
The final senior is the only one who may fit the description of superstar. Senior captain Mike O'Connor received All­America honors for his 1990 track season, and it is likely that he will add to his past achievements with another All­America title for cross country this season. 
O'Connor, however, avoids speculation about his own goals and tends to focus on team goals instead. His selfless spirit, along with his dedication and leadership abilities, makes him stand out in the role of team leader, and prompts Piane to call him "one of the best captains I've ever had. 
"He is a great leader, and he leads by running well," he con­tinued. "Nobody works harder than Mike. I've had kids in the past with more talent than Mike who couldn't hold a candle to him, It takes dedication to achieve what he has." 
O'Connor stated that Notre 
Dame's past and future suc­
cesses rest on the shoulders of 
the team as a whole. 
"I don't think anyone goes 
into a meet with personal 
goals," said O'Connor. "We just 
go in and try to run well as a 
team. I think we've done some 
good things since we've been 
here, and we have an opportu­
nity to do some real good things 
on Monday." 
With seniors like Kearns, 
Cahill, and O'Connor leading 
the way, the men's cross-coun· 
try team deserves to find suc­
cess, and if the team follows the 
example of these three leaders, 
they will succeed.

Jen~y Kipp, school record 
holder in one-meter diving and NCAA Zone meet qualifier, would not be racking up points for the Irish if Notre Dame had a gymnastics team; in fact, Kipp wouldn't be diving at all. 
A junior psychology major from Woodridge, Ill., Kipp participated in and competed in gymnastics for 15 years. While most divers begin no later than ninth grade, she didn't take up diving until her junior year of high school. 
Kipp's gymnastics coach, who was also the swim coach, converted her to diving. With a strong gymnastics background Kipp had no problem switching from land to water; by her se­nior year she placed ninth at the Illinois State Diving Championships.

Notre Dame without r all ettin into troubl<:. 
In spite of her diving success, Kipp's interest in gymnastics continued. Why did she choose Notre Dame, a school without a gymnastics program? 
"I was going to pick a school for academics, I didn't plan on diving in college," said Kipp. 
After Kipp decided on Notre Dame and found there wasn't a gymnastics program, she called Head Swim Coach Tim Welsh. She didn't hear from Welsh again until the August newslet­ter, welcoming all freshmen swimmers and divers to Notre Dame. 
Although Kipp hadn't been on a diving board since the previous fall, she decided to dive because it was a varsity sport and she felt she was as good as the other divers. She didn't tell Welsh the part about

Announcing A Poetry Contest 
in honor of The Sesquicentennial Year 

Open to alumni, current students and staff, and present and former faculty members 
A prize of $500 dollars is offered for the 
chosen poem selected by the judges. The 
winner will be brought to the campus for 
SY celebration and a reading of the poem. 
The prize-winning poem will be selected 
from entries from the four 
aforementioned categories, with 
runners-up from each category possible. 
The poem need not be directly concerned 
with Notre Dame, or the 

Sesquicentennial, though submissions 
which touch upon the themes of the 
Sesquicentennial (Belief, Inquiry, 
Community) will be looked at with 
special interest. 

Previously published poems are not eligible. Send entries (no more than 3 poems) in triplicate, with no name on the poems themselves, but on a removable coversheet, by April 15th, 1991, to SY Poetry Contest in care of The Department of English, University of Notre Dame, IN, 46556. 
her success is a good body awareness when she's in the air twisting or spinning. Gymnastics has certainly helped, and Kipp was able to make the adjustment to diving, although the hurdle on the div­ing board is a lot different than the hurdle in vaulting. 
"Jenny's dives are fine, we just need to improve her boardwork, so she'll get higher and have more time to make cleaner entries," said Brennan. 
Kipp was diver of the meet at last year's National Catholic Championships, winning the one-meter and placing second on three-meter. Her perfor­mance was especially impres­sive because she never had dove three-meter until college. In two weeks she hopes to im­prove upon last year's perfor­mance and come out a double 
winner at National Catholics.

Jenny Kipp 
not diving for almost a year. 
Kipp admits she already had peaked in gymnastics and en­joys diving because "diving is kind of like gymnastics and I can work at it. . . it's different and I still have room to im­prove." 
Since Tracy Brennan became diving coach last year Jenny has become "a lot more consis­tent on both boards, improving quicker on one-meter than three-meter because she's taken time off on three-meter." 
Her improvement was slowed when she hit the board a month ago and sprained her fingers. The impact with the water is harder off three-meter is harder than off the one-meter board, but Kipp's fingers are healing and she's already back on three-meter. 
Kipp has already reached her first-semester goals: qualifying for Zones and breaking Andrea Bonny's one-meter record. Brennan is confident Jenny can also qualify for Zones on three­meter. 
What makes Kipp a good diver? Brennan feels the key to

Sixers' Bol seeks to end hunger in his homeland 
WASHINGTON (AP) -Manute Bol of the Philadelphia 76ers told a hunger relief group Thursday that he feels torn every day because he is living well while his relatives and millions of others in the Sudan are starving. 
Bol, a Dinka tribesman from the Sudanese village of Turalei, appealed to Americans, if not to help, 
then  to  at  least  make  
themselves aware  of the  
suffering.  

"I eat good food here in America and I go to sleep at night and then when I wake up in the morning and watch something on TV, I just feel really terrible," Bol told Oxfam America, the hunger relief group. "There's nothing I can do. In my family, too, I have got about 70 people right now homeless in the capital of Sudan. They have no place to go." 
Bol earns $1.3 million in salary with the 76ers. He and his agent estimate he has spent $300,000 over the past three years to keep his relatives from going hungry. He bought a house in Khartoum for $100,000 and estimates that 35 to 40 members of his extended family live there. 

Bol said he wants to believe that Americans are compas­sionate. 
"Some friends, not my team­mates, they ask me do you think that Americans will help those hungry people, give them something? I say 'Why do you say that?' and they say 'There's a lot of homeless right now in Philadelphia and nobody's helping them,' " Bol said. 
Bol said his teammates asked him why he wanted to attend the hunger awareness reception. The reception, held in honor of the late Texas congressman Mickey Leland, was part of activities and fasting nationwide.

In a rematch of last year's semifinal playoff game, the Alumni Dogs and the Off­Campus Crime will meet on Sunday, this time for the 1990 men's interhall football cham­pionship. 
Both teams have cruised through the playoffs so far. Alumni easily handled Stanford 26-3 and Sorin 24-0, while Off­Campus defeated Fisher 17-6 and Grace 19-7. 
The Dogs have relied on a rock-solid defensive effort to lead them to their two playoff victories. Last week against the Otters' explosive offense, Alumni held them to negative­four total yards, and forced four interceptions. This week Alumni faces an offense that is slightly more predictable, but is also very dependable. 
Off-Campus has used a strong running attack in its wins. Phil Couri and Brian Doherty, running behind an excellent offensive line led by Tom Sutliff and John Schoen, are the keys to the Crime offense, com­plemented by key completions from Bob Allard to receivers Chuck Moser and James Dillard. 
Alumni's defense has been tough against the run all year, however, and Coach Tom Helms believes his team will have to vary the offense a little more to keep the Dogs guessing. 
"We want to control the ball on offense," said Helms. "We need to have sustained drives to keep Alumni's offense off the field as much as possible. We'll need to run the ball well, but also mix in the pass a little more in order to be successful on offense." 
The Dog offense Helms men­tioned is one of the best in in­terhall football this year. A solid, ball-control offense keyed by a good running game with Dave Ludwig and Mark Ross, it also has big-play capabilities with quarterback Jim Passinault often hooking up with split end Pete Parten and tight end John Carretta. 
"We have to eliminate the penalties on defense," said Helms. "With their offense, we can't give them any yards. We have to make them earn every­thing they get."

Alumni, O.C. meet in IH final 
Szyperski, the key will be the Dogs' defensive play. If they shut down the Crime running game, he believes this will hurt seriously Off-Campus' chances for victory. He also wants to get Ludwig and Ross into the game early. 
"We want to establish the running game against Off­Campus to offset their hard­hitting, aggressive defense which pursues the ball well," said Szyperski. 
Szyperski spoke specifically of the linebacking corps of the Crime, led by Antwon Lark, a former varsity scout team member. If Alumni can get the running game established, it only enhances its potent pass­ing attack, which will have a height advantage on the smaller Crime secondary. 
Special teams play also will be a major factor in this game. Sorin self-destructed in the punting game, and Alumni scored 16 easy points on these errors. The Crime have been prone to giving up blocked punts and place-kicks this year, but if they get the ball off, they have one of the better kickers in interhall football, Bob Topel. 
Both defenses are strong against the run, so the game will turn on the abilities of Passinault and Allard. Off­Campus has lived by the run this season, but will face its stiffest test yet in trying to crack the Dog defense. Allard threw only four times against Grace, but will have to throw more against Alumni in order for the Crime to win.

The fifth-year Fordham coach said Ellis' 13 rebounds and physical play intimidated the Rams down low. Ellis allowed standout Damon Lopez just six points and four rebounds. Lopez averaged 11.4 points and over 10 rebounds a game last year.

ND hockey ices UMass-Boston 

By DAVE DIETEMAN 
Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame hockey team (2-5-1) survived a third-period rally by the visiting University of Massachusetts-Boston Beacons (3-1) last night, squeaking out a 6-4 win in front of several hundred fans at the JACC. 
The Irish opened the scoring early, as Dan Marvin took a pass from Dan Sawyer in front of the Beacon net and dumped it into the goal only 1:39 into the game. Black had taken a pass from Sterling Black, who stole the puck from a Boston defender. 
The Beacons quickly tied things up, however, as forward John Veneri beat Irish goal­keeper Greg Louder at the 3:39 minute mark, with assists going to Jim Abban and Jim Geary. 
Tim Litchard notched an unassisted goal, and Curtis Janicke took a double-assist from David Bankoske and Darren D'Amato for another score as the Irish jumped out to a 3-1 lead by the end of the first period. 
Yet the lopsided score of the early going did not indicate the see-saw, erratic play on the ice. 
"We played just poorly enough to lose," wryly com­mented Notre Dame head coach Ric Schafer, whose squad faces the Beacons again tonight. "But we did win, and that makes me glad. We needed this win. We 
Ric Schafer 

have been working hard and we got the win we needed-this is what the doctor ordered." 
Despite the fact that the Irish garnered a much-needed vic­tory, Schafer remains con­cerned, as Notre Dame must take the ice again tonight to face the same Beacon squad. 
"I'm still worried about us," said Schafer. "I hope that the players are worried too. I think that we're a better team than we showed-we're supposed to be a better team than that-but this team could beat us if we don't really play well." 
Given the Beacon perfor­mance in the final period, Schafer has good reason for concern. The UMass-Boston put together a three-goal assault, as they pulled to within 6-4 of the Irish. 
Notre Dame had apparently landed its knockout punch just 
2:56 into the third period. Dan 
Marvin took an assist from Sterling Black and beat the be­leaguered Boston goalie for a 6­1 Irish advantage. 
Yet the Beacons rambled back with poise, as Steve Goslin scored twice and Jim Geary scored once, putting the game within reach. The Irish defense, however, rose to the occasion and held UMass-Boston score­less during the final 1:47 to preserve the win. 
Coach Schafer hypothesized about his team's sporadic per­formance. 
"We are not approaching our best efforts at the same time," said Schafer. "We are not all together yet. I am so worried about how we will become a better hockey team. I'm just so critical of our performance right now, however, that I can't really pinpoint what we have to do." 
Despite his lack of satisfac­tion, Schafer was quick to point to a rosy future. 
"I definitely see better days on the horizon," remarked Schafer. "We can play better than we have played. Right now, I am worried. This team will play us tough tomorrow, and I hope that we play good hockey." 
Notre Dame again faces UMass-Boston tonight at 7:30 
p.m. at the JACC.

Irish wrestle at St. Louis, hope to keep momentum 
By RICHARD MATHURIN 
Sports Writer 

The Notre Dame wrestling team will travel to St. Louis this weekend to compete in the St. Louis Open on Saturday, November 17. The Irish are coming off a victory at the Michigan State Invitational two weeks ago. The Irish had many strong performances including victories by junior Marcus Gowens in the 126-lb. division, sophomore Jamie Boyd in the 142-lb. division, senior tri-captain Todd Layton in the 150-lb. class, and sophomore Steve King in 190-lb. division. Last year, the Irish placed strong in the St. Louis meet, receiving a victory in the 167­lb. from one of this year's senior tri-captains Mark Gerardi. Also, the now graduated All-American Pat Boyd took second pace in the 142-lb. weight class. The Irish will also look to freshman Chris Jensen in the in the 118-lb. division. Jensen has impressive high school credentials having compiled a record of 126-1 at Hoquiam High School in Washington. In the 134-lb. division looks to be the most competitive with sophomores Kyle Cadman and Mike Donnino competing with freshman Mike Ahern for the starting spot. The surprise of the season could come from sophomore Emil Soehnlen, who has shown great improvement in the 158-lb. class. At 177-lb. wight class, two freshman will vie for the starting spot. J .J. McGrew and Bill Hunter both had distinguished high school careers and was impressive in the preseason. The heavyweight division ap­pears to have the most depth for the Irish with three strong candidates competing for spots. Junior Chuck Weaver appears to have the edge since he started last year, but he will be pushed by juniors Curt Engler and Tom Salvino.

ND volleyball goes for MCC title 
By RENE FERRAN 
Sports Writer 
The Irish volleyball team travels to Cincinnati today to compete in the Midwestern 
Collegiate  Conference  
Championships  hosted  by  
Xavier University.  

Notre Dame (8-23) will face the Loyola Ramblers (24-9) in the first round at 3:00 p.m. Friday. 
Notre Dame received the fifth seed in the tournament after tying for third in the MCC this year because it lost to both Dayton and Loyola in the regu­lar season. The Ramblers are the fourth seed. 
Loyola is led by sophomore setter Julie McShane, who leads the team in assists (1391), and sophomore middle-hitter Therese O'Neill, the team 
. leader in kills (402). In their regular season match, Loyola defeated the Irish 15-6, 15-4, 11-15, 15-10 in Chicago on October 9, in the first of two matches that evening for the Irish. Sophomore middle blocker Jessica Fiebelkorn, who did not make the trip to Cincinnati due to an injury, believes the Irish are ready to atone for their earlier defeat at the hands of the Ramblers. "We played awful that night," said Fiebelkorn. "We did not play anywhere near our capa­bilities in the first match, although we picked it up in the 
second-half of the double­header. The team is looking good. We played well Tuesday night, and it should carry over." 
So far this year, Notre Dame has been guilty of lapses in key situations. For example, against Northwestern on Tuesday, the Irish lost two of three games on mistakes at game point. This topic has been stressed at Irish practices lately. 
"We've been working in prac­tice on eliminating our errors during critical times of our matches," said senior outside­hitter Colleen Wagner. "If we focus on the fundamentals, and play a relatively clean match [against Loyola]. we'll be in good shape."
