The DaVinci Code, the contro­versial American novel that has topped best-seller lists for well over a year, has stirred conver­sation and controversy about Christian history and theology, generating particular interest in an organization that several Notre Dame students and facul­ty belong to -Opus Dei. 

In casting the novel's villain as an Opus Dei member, author Dan Brown heaped more confu­sion onto the lay organization whose publicity in the last sev­eral years has spanned the GEOFF MATIESON/The Observer

Three recent fires at Castle Point Apartments have left authorities searching for answers, after four Notre Dame seniors were left with an unliv­able apartment and other areas of the complex were badly dam­aged by smoke. 
While two of the fires were minor -flaring in trash cans in separate community laundry rooms the nights of Oct. 11 and 12 -the third fire, which occurred the ·afternoon of Oct. 14, did significant damage to several apartments, according to Clay Township Fire Chief Tim Schab bel. 
The first two fires have been classified as suspicious, and the third is under open investigation, Schabbel said. 
"We haven't eliminated any possibilities," he said, adding the possibilities include arson, other suspicious activity or an acci­
dent. · Authorities including Clay Fire Marshal Dave Cherrone, the office of the Indiana state fire marshal and the office of the St. 
Joseph County sheriff are piecing together the details of the fires through interviews and lab 
investigation, Schabbel said. It could not be determined whether the same party was

NDto offer li111ited flu shot supply 
Nationwide concerns lead to revised plan 
By KATIE PERRY and CLAIRE 
HEININGER 
News Writers 
In light of the severity of the nationwide flu vaccine shortage, Notre Dame has decided to only offer vaccinations to high-risk individuals -reversing a previ­ous plan to also vaccinate the general population of students on a first-come. first-serve basis. 
Although students were informed through an Oct. 13 e­mail from Heath Services direc­tor Ann Kleva that shots would be available. the University real­ized it could not in good con­science offer vaccinations to healthy students when the natiorial community is strapped to cover all high-risk individuals, said University spokesman Matt Sturin. 
The initial plan was a "natural reflex" on the part of Health Services to follow its mission of providing care to students. Sturin said, but was changed once Notre Dame officials had a chance to fully absorb the importance of the Centers For Disease Control guidelines about who is eligible to receive shots from the nation's dwindling sup­ply. 
"When we gained a full cog­nizance of the guidelines, we realized our program was too generous," Sturin· said. "Every instance [of vaccination) that goes outside those guidelines takes away from those [high-

Are you serious? 
If this was your reaction after the 
infamously cursed Boston Hed Sox 
advanced to the World Series. 
you're not alone. 
Not only did the Hed Sox advance

Series, they did it Steve Coyer

best of seven 
series. 
No baseball team had ever come 
back from such a deficit and for the 
Hed Sox to do it defied all odds. I 
could go on about the details of the 
monumental upset but you can find 
out about that in any sports page or 
on ESPN.com. 
So rather then tell you what hap­pened to the Hed Sox, I'm going to take a stab at explaining the bizarre phenomenon. 
My theory begins with a key assumption. It is that the Hed Sox indeed are a cursed team. After trading Babe Huth to the Yankees, the tE\alll has yet to win a World Series even after coming painfully dose. 
The Hed Sox still have to win the World Sr.ries to break the curse but this team has all the ingredients to shatter the curse forever. 
Where do I start? One of the keys to breaking the curse comes from a friend of Pedro Martinez. The Boston pitcher has been seen with a midget sidekick who Martinez believes has magical powers... apparently his little friend does. 
And what about .Johnny Damon and his caveman long hair that has been a constant throughout the playoffs. Damon called the Hed Sox a "bunch of idiots" and this charac­teristic has been vital to the team's curse busting efforts. 
Besides being idiots, the Bed Sox could also be characterized as lazy and not the most clean cut bunch. Manny Hamirez jogs to first on sin­gles and Kevin Millar had a three inch long beard extending from his chin. 
Even their manager Terry Francona admits that team resem­bles a college fraternity. 
And this is the central point of my theory; the Hed Sox aren't serious. They arc overcoming an 86 year old curse and defeating far more pol­ished and professional teams (like the Yankees). 
Whether it is due to Pedro Martinez's friend, the team's unique facial hair. or simply a lack of seri· ousness. I can't say, but I do know that whatever they are doing it has worked. 
Don't get me wrong, the Hed Sox are a very talented baseball team but their many quirks have given them an extra boost this season. 
And if said "are you serious?" while watching the Hed Sox surprise the world. I think I know how the team might respond ... 
No, we definitely are not serious.

Panel discusses U.S. foreign policy in African countries 

By JEANNINE PRIVAT News Wmer 
A range of speakers addn~ssed various issues concerning the relationship between the United States and Africa in an "Africa. Trade. Debt & the U.S. l'n~sidential Elections" panel Tuesday evening. 
The first speaker. Brian Davis. the Midwest Field Coordinator for Debt Aids Trade Africa (DATA), analyzed the Bush administra­tion's actions with regard to Africa. Davis said that as Africa has grown in importance with n~gard to tlw United States' for­eign policy, presidents have been more willing to pass legislation and discuss A!hcan issues. 
President George W. Hush has done more than any other presi­dent to aid and c£ddress African issues, according to Davis, with initiatives like PEPFAR (!'resident's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relid) and thn Millennium Challenge established in March 2002. 
I lowever. Davis added that even though the Bush administration has donP this, it has not given its initiatives high importance. While tlw administration aimed to spend $5 billion per year by 2006 for the Millennium Challenge, this yrar's budget has allocated a mere $1.12 billion. And though Bush has spent more than any other leader, with regard to relief aid as a percentage of a nation's wealth. Davis said the United States "ranks dead last in the wealthiest 22 countries." 
Father Hob~\rt Dowd, assistant professor of political science, said the kind of attention paid to Africa is more important than the amount of attention. Since Sept. 11, 2001, the administration has focused more on Africa, because some in the administration have come to view Africa as "a poten­tial breeding ground for terror­ism," Dowd said. 
He also emphasized the impor­tance of fair and free trade, as well as commended the African Growth and Opportunity Act and Millennium Challenge Act. However, Dowd was wary con­cerning the strengthening of mili­taries and police forces through aid in certain African countries. 
"If these [military and police] initiatives focused on consolidated democracies, that would be one thing, but they're not," he.said. 
Dowd said he would be "con­cerned about a second Bush administration without Colin Powell," who Dowd views as the strongest advocate for African issues within the current adminis­tration. Dowd stated that he believed it is important to look at who will be in the prospective administrations surrounding the victor on Nov. 2. 
Isaac S. D. Lappia, an M. A stu­dent in Kroc Institute for International Peace Studies and former director for Amnesty International Sierra Leone, focused on three key issues: the death penalty, the small arms trade and the ICC. Lappia spoke of "the blind following" by many African countries of the United States and their policies. 
With regard to the death penal­ty. Lappia said, "as long as America continues to kill, they [African countries] will not abol­ish killing." 

While the United States con­ducts trials for criminal acts and then sentences the guilty to death, in some African countries the death penalty is used to obliterate political opposition. he said. 
Lappia also warned of the prob­lems with the United States' policy of small arms trade with African nations, where many small arriis find their way into the hands of rebels and guerilla armies. He called for an International Trade Treaty with more strenuous regu­lations for small arms trading. Lastly, Lappia touched on the topic of the ICC, International Criminal Court. He stated the case of his home country, in 
which the United States offered ·Sierra Leone $25 million to agree to a bilateral impunity agreement protecting United States nationals from b.eing surrendered by Sierra 
Leone to the ICC. 
"[It was] unfair to use money to 
buy freedom for Americans," he 
said. 
The last speaker, Dolores T. 
Connolly, CEO of Sterling 
Engineering, Inc. and a board 
member of Concern USA, spoke of 
the disconnect between 
Americans and the citizens and 
problems of the Third World. 
"Obesity is our major health 
problem and I'm here to talk 
about hunger," she said. ·with the 
Millennium Challenge Act the 
United States signed on to gradu­
ally increase aid up to .7 percent of its GNP in the next couple of years, but is "dragging in this area," according to Connolly. Of the eight Millennium Challenge goals, she emphasized the impor­tance of eradicating extreme poverty and hunger. achieving universal primary education. pro­moting gender equality and the empowerment of women and the development of a global partner­ship for development. 
"The Millennium Challenge is building bridges that have never been built before," she said. 
Dowd summarized by saying that it is important to stay true to the standards the countries have set.

Linguistic expert talks of -word choice, gender 
By TRICIA de GROOT 
News Writer 
Hobin Tolmach Lakoll', a professor at University of Cal.ifomia, Berkeley usnd her expertise in linguistics to analyze tho progress toward equali­ty of opportunity for all people in the Unit11d States on Tuesday as part of the fourth Provost Distinguished Women Ler.ture Series. 
I~tkotl' began her lecture by intro­dueing her basic argument. "rodrawing the gender line in the sand" and then by explaining what linguist<> have to say about social changes. 
"I ~mguage is the means by which we understand the world and the way we communicate to one anoth­er what we believe the world to be like." Lakotl' said. 
Language functions, according to I.akotl', serve as a "universal donor" or medium especially with regard to the other social sciences and specifi­cally. gender discussions. Language basnd evidence is one way of mak­ing sense of social changes, said Lakon·. 
"We look at the situation of women in pmt by words that have come and gone." 
"Language is often the clearest way of understanding what is going on. what is working and what L<>n't working. and we can chart progress by what goes in and out of lan­guage," said I..akofl'. 
Shti then spoke more specifically on the implications that language has with regard to narratives. the 11111dia and the roles that they have playPd both in the past. present and will play in the future. Lakoff nar­rownd her focus further and said that "morr. and moro we are reliant on the media to be the medium of story telling" and that then novel TV sitcoms such as "I Love Lucy," gave "additional reinforcement of the post World War II message to tell women to get back home and stay back home." 
l.akotl' also spoke of the changes in academia and her own personal challenges upon entering the aca­demic world with no role models to 
guide her in her pursuit of an aca­
demic: career and how the same sit­
uation rang true with regard to law, 
medicine, and politics. 

She talked about the implications of the changes in the roles of women in the 1970s to 1990s and how these women were given more choices, pressures and ambiguities than there mothers had ever encountered. These same women fmmd themselves in time crunches, energy drains and identity crisis and sought to. quite reasonably. blame the women's movement for these situations they found themselves to b1l unprepared for. "People some­times turn on the women's move­ment as the evil genie of all of this," said Lakoff. 
Instead, according to Lakoff, they actually "experienced nostalgia for a past that, in fact, had never exist­ed." 
Lakoff gave detailed examples of the major changes for women in the 1970's and 1990's, including Roe v. Wade, Ms. Magazine, "Thelma and Louise" and even Hillary Rodham Clinton whose terms as first lady, according to Lakoff, "made a great deal of rethinking about gender roles." 
She concluded by showing the redrawing of the line in the present and illustrated this with examples such as Martha Stewart being sent to prison, the attitude toward Janet Jackson's "wardrobe malfunction," and the media treatment of Teresa lleinz Kerry. 
Lakoff then left the audience with· three unresolved questions relating to the present understanding of role-sharing in couples, equality between the sexes and fmally, the implications of starting off at a "lower level." 
The goal of the lecture series was established in order to create a number of small and large settings for faculty, staff, students and the community members to int,eract around some interesting topics, this one being the so called "gender line."

Amnesty calls for U.S. investigation 
LONDON -Amnesty International on Wednesday renewed its call for the United States to set up an independent investiga­tion of the abuse of prisoners in Afghanistan, at Guantanamo Bay and at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq. 
The organization denied it was seeking to influence the U.S. presidential election with its 200-page report, but expressed disappointment the issue had not been prominent in the campaign. 
"We feel that this is the last chance to get it on the agenda of the candidates," Amnesty International spokeswoman Theresa Richardson said in London. 
Richardson added that six months had passed since the photographs. of Iraqi pris­oners being humiliated at the Abu Ghraib were first shown on U.S. television. "It's taken this long for. us to pull this report together," she said. 
India unsure of Kashmir proposal 
NEW DELHI -One day after Pakistan's president proposed a demilitarization of the violence-wracked Himalayan region of Kashmir, India's response was notably lukewarm, with an official making clear the proposal should not have been made first to reporters. 
Refusing to comment on the substance of the proposals, presented to journalists Monday by Pakistani President Gen. Pervez Musharraf, Indian External Affairs Ministry spokesman Navtej Sarna said they should have been raised through diplomatic channels.

Texas execution reprieve lifted 
HUNTSVILLE, Texas -A federal appeals court Tuesday lifted a reprieve that had blocked the scheduled execution of a man in a 1992 murder case in which the troubled Houston police crime lab allegedly mishan­dled evidence. 
Lawyers for condemned inmate Dominique Green went to the Supreme Court to try to save his life before he's set to die by injection Tuesday evening. 
U.S. District Judge Nancy Atlas ha'd blocked Green's execution after his attorneys argued that boxes of improperly stored and catalogued evidence kept by the Houston crime lab and recently discovered could con­tain information relevant to the case.

WASHINGTON -The White House praised the Israeli parliament's approval of removing settlements from Gaza and part of the West Bank as .a step forward in peacemaking with the Palestinians. 
'This disengagement plan has the potential of being historic and we see it as an important step in fulfilling President Bush's vision of two states living side-by-side in peace and security," White House spokesman Trent Duffy said in Dubuque, Iowa, where the president was campaigning. 
Approval by the Knesset, or parliament, came in Jerusalem after a stormy debate between supporters of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and critics of the pullback.

Karzai wins Afghan presidency 
Interim leader declared official victor of country's first democratic election 
Associated Press 
KABUL, Afghanistan ­More than two weeks after Afghanistan's first presi­dential election, vote counting wrapped up Tuesday and interim leader Hamid K.arzai emerged with a resounding victory. 
With his inauguration to a five-year term a month away, the U.S.-backed Karzai already is under pressure to ditch his coali­tion with powerful war­
. lords and tackle a booming narcotics industry that has become a major economic force in one of the world's poorest nations. Officials declared the vote count complete Tuesday afternoon, giving some 1,500 weary staff at eight counting centers a well-earned rest in the middle of the Islamic fast­ing month of Ramadan. Investigators were still examining about 100 sus­peCt ballot boxes, but the election's chief technical officer said the count was effectively "over and done." "It's jus.t these last dribs and drabs to be approved," David Avery told The Associated Press. "It's real­ly nothing that can affect the outcome." Showing 98.4 percent of the votes counted, the Web site of the U.N .-Afghan election commission said Karzai had 55.5 percent of the votes, 39 points ahead of his closest rival, former Education Minister Yunus Qanooni. An estimated 8.2 million ballots were cast in the his­toric vote Oct. 9, a turnout that U.S. and Afghan offi­cials hailed as a nail in the coffin of the former ruling Taliban, whose threats to disrupt the election proved hollow. Karzai, 47, a member of the Pashtun community, the largest ethnic group in this diverse and often divided country, portrayed himself as the best candi­date to weld a unified Afghanistan. He also promised to dou­ble the income of Afghans 

and pursue a reformist agenda that can finally begin to deliver basic serv­ices such as health and education to people impov­erished by a quarter-centu­ry of fighting. 
So far, the country's re­emergence -cities such as Kabul and Kandahar are in the grip of a real estate boom -appears to be founded more on lucra­tive drug exports than the legal economy. 
Under pressure from the United States, Karzai is expected to announce a crackdown on refiners and traffickers who use Afghan opium poppies to supply most of the world's heroin. 
"His mind is made up to do something, finally," a Western official who advis­es the Afghan government on counternarcotics policy said on condition of anonymity. "They know that this government will not survive if they don't take action." 
Karzai must deal with the opium traffickers at the same time he grapples with regional leaders who still control much of the country with the help of private militias that have so far escaped a U.N.-spon­sored disarmament drive. 
Francese Vendrell, the European Union's special representative, said Karzai took an important step before the election by excluding Defense Minister Mohammed Fahim, a pow­erful warlord, from his presidential ticket and then sidelining the most influen­tial warlord in western Afghanistan, Ismail Khan. 
"He's now got a mandate to have a reformist govern­ment," Vendrell told British Broadcasting Corp. radio, adding that the United States and European nations would support his efforts. 
Election officials said for­mal confirmation of Karzai's victory could come by the weekend, when investigations into irregu­larities were expected to be complete and the elec­tion ruled "free and fair." 
Karzai would then have until his swearing-in in late November to think about how to reorganize his Cabinet, which now con­tains a string of former militia leaders who helped the United States drive out the Taliban in late 2001. 


Sniper sentenced to life in prison 
Associated Press 

SPOTSYLVANIA, Va. -Teenage sniper Lee Boyd Malvo accepted a d.eal Tuesday in which he avoided the death penalty and was s~n­tenced to life in prison without parole for one of 10 slayings that terrorized the Washington area in October 2002. 
Malvo, 19, is already serving a life sentence for another one of the killings, and dropped his appeals of that conviction in connection with Tu'esday's plea bargain. 
Malvo could still face a death penalty prosecution for other slay­. ings. 
Malva was sentenced Tuesday for the Oct. 11, 2002, killing of busi­nessman Kenneth Bridges. Under the plea deal, he also received an additional life sentence for the shooting of Caroline Seawell on Oct. 4, 2002. She recovered from her wounds'. 
Malvo's guilty plea took the form of an Alford plea, in which Malvo did not admit factual guilt but acknowledged the government hi;ts sufficient evidence to convict him. He cannot appeal the sentence. 
Malvo declined to make a state­ment before he was sentenced. Spotsylvania Commonwealth's Attorney William Neely said he 
consulted with the victims' families and they supported the plea bar­gain. 
"He's spending the rest of his life in a maximum security prison where he'll be locked down 23 hours a day, seven days a week for the rest of his life," Neely said. 
Malvo was convicted last year and sentenced to life in prison for the Oct. 14, 2002, murder of FBI analyst Linda Franklin, one of the sniper killings over a three-week· span in Maryland, Virginia and Washington, D.C. His accomplice, John Allen Muhammad, is on Virginia's death row for one of the slayings.

IN BRIEF 
Hotels refuse to end lockout 
SAN FRANCISCO -Faced with an ultima­tum from the mayor, 14 San Francisco hotels refused Tuesday to end their four-week lock­out of unionized employees. 
"We respectfully decline the mayor's request for a 90-day cooling-off period," said Cornell Fowler, a spokesman for the hotel operators. 
Mayor Gavin Newsom on Monday threat­ened to call for a boycott of the hotels if they did not agree to allow the 4,000 bellhops, maids, cooks and other workers to return to their jobs while contract talks continue. 
Warning that the dispute was tarnishing the city's image and hurting its workers, Newsom said he would join the hotel workers on the picket lines and encourage mayors in other cities to play hardball with the properties' cor­porate owners. 
He made good on the vow Tuesday, showing up for a half hour at the posh St. Francis Hotel, where he reiterated his plan to prevent the city from doing business with the hotels. He said he personally won't attend functions there, either. 
Attorney general questions Anthem 
PHilADELPHIA -Anthem Inc. received a sub­poena Monday from Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal, who is seeking information from the health insurer about commissions and bonuses. 
"It just lays out some standard questions about commission and bonus structure," Anthem spokesman James Kappel told Dow Jones Newswires on Tuesday. "We plan to comply with the request for information." 
The subpoena was the first that the Indianapolis company has received from Connecticut's attor­ney general or any state official investigating the insurance industry, he said. 
Anthem did not issue a formal release on the subpoena or ftl.e a notification with the Securities and Exchange Commission, he said, because "it's not a material event for the company." Kappel had no further comment on the request for infor­mation. 
Anthem, the nation's fourth-largest publicly traded managed-care company, operates Blue Cross and Blue Shield health pfttns in several states.

Voters skeptical of voting accuracy 
WASHINGTON -Memories of Florida's contested 2000 presidential election and a growing number of pre-election lawsuits are making Americans skeptical about a voting process they once took for granted. 
Six in 10 of those surveyed in an Associated Press poll say it's likely there will not be a clear winner in the presidential race by Nov. 3 -the day after the election. About half say they rear the results will be chal­lenged in court, according to the poll con­ducted for the AP by Ipsos Public Affairs. 
Both Democrats and Hepublicans worry about the possibility of an unresolved elec­tion -though Democrats express more wor­ries. About seven in 10 Democratic voters, 69 percent. say they think it's likely there won't be a clear winner by Election Day, while almost six in 10 Hepublican voters, 56 pnrcent. say they feel that way. 
With both political parties putting thou­sands of lawyers on call for Election Day, a majority of both Democrats and Hepublicans -just over half of each -expect the elec­tion results will be challenged in court. 
Joe Lockhart. a Kerry spokesman, said Tuesday during a conference.call: "Our oper­ating assumption is that there will be a clear winner. The six-in-10 number is areaction to coverage to some of the shenanigans that are going on. I expect the six-in-10 number to go down and not go up before Election Day." 
Tom Josefiak. the Bush campaign's top lawyer, said recently that "it may takes days or weeks" after Nov. 2 to determine the win­ner because of absentee ballots and other questions. 
Catholic group: Bush failed to 
respond to bishops' form 
The Bush-Cheney campaign refused to fill out a questionnaire developed for the presi­dential candidates by U.S. Roman Catholic bishops, according to a memo obtained by a Catholic voter advocacy group. 
Frank J. Monahan, in the Office of Government Liaison of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, sent a memo Aug. 16 to Democrat )ohn Kerry, saying his campaign need not submit answers because "the Bush campaign has indicated that it does not intend to respond to the questionnaire." 
Monahan wrote that the bishops' confer­ence was abandoning the project because it "cannot disseminate the questionnaire responses of only one candidate" under IRS rules requiring that charitable organizations remain nonpartisan. The questionnaire asked the candidates about their positions on issues including abortion, health care and immigration. 
Catholics comprise about one:quarter of the electorate, and the campaigns have been competing fiercely for their vote. 
Kerry is Catholic but has drawn criticism from bishops for supporting abortion rights. The presid~nt's anti-abortion position is closer to that of the church. Bush is a Methodist. 
The memo was obtained by The Catholic Voting Project, a group formed partly to counter what it sees as a narrow focus on abortion among politicians seeking Catholic support. Project organizers say they are nonpartisan, but believe Catholics should consider a wide range of social justice issues when deciding which .candidate to support.

Attacks stretch across party lines  I I ·1 I 
Bush, Kerry praise former presidents as national security battle continues 

Associated Press 

ONALASKA, Wis. President Bush and Sen. John Kerry accused each other of lacking the hard­nosed resolve of Cold War presidents from Democrat Truman to Republican Reagan ­reaching across party lines a week before Election Day to try to break their cam­paign deadlock. 
With tensions rising Tuesday in both camps, Kerry escalated his criti­cism of Bush over explo­sives missing in ·Iraq, asserting that the weapons could be used against American troops and citi­zens. He accused the presi­dent of keeping the cost of war in Iraq under wraps until after Election Day. 
"What else are you keep­ing from the American peo­ple?" Kerry said in Green Bay. 
Across the state, Bush said his rival favors "the· position of weakness and inaction" contrary to "the great tradition of the Democratic Party." 
A Los Angeles Times poll showed the popular vote tied, 48-48, with Bush­weary voters open to change on Iraq and the economy but harboring doubts about Kerry's ability to lead the nation against terror. 
New state surveys showed the race also knot­ted in Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania, the three most important battle­grounds in the race for 270 Electoral College votes. 
Behind the scenes, both campaigns tweaked their stump speeches, advertis­ing strategies and get-out­the-vote drives. In addition to Wisconsin, Bush visited Iowa while Kerry traveled to Nevada and New Mexico -all tossup states. 
After spending weeks casting Kerry as a flip-flop­ping liberal in TV ads, Bush plann.ed to close the race with a 60-second commercial designed to portray himself as a trust­worthy, steady leader. 
The high point, according to advisers.. is a clip of a choked-up Bush addressing the Republican National Convention about meeting the children of slain U.S: soldiers "who are told their dad or mom is a hero but would rather just have their dad or mom." 
Kerry's latest ad accuses the Bush administration of failing to secure nearly 400 tons of explosives that are missing from a military installation south of Baghdad. "His Iraq mis­judgments put our soldiers at risk, and make our country less secure," Kerry says of Bush in the ad. 
He said in Green Bay the explosives "could be in the hands of terrorists, used to attack our troops or our people." 
Vice President Dick Cheney responded for Bush from Florida, saying, "It is not at all cleav that those explosives were even at the weapons facility when our troops arrived in the area of Baghdad." 
In the battle of past pres­idents, Bush said Democrats Roos­evelt,Truman and Kennedy showed "confidence and resolve in times of war and hours of ·crisis," asserting that Kerry lacks such met­tle. 
Kerry said Presidents Roosevelt, Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy and Reagan all built strong alliances, a contrast to Bush who Kerry said "has failed in his fundamental obligation as commander in chief to make America as safe and s.ecure as we should be." 
Later, in Nevada, the Democrat appealed in both Spanish and English to undecided voters. "We're in a bigger mess by the day and the president can't see it or can't admit it, but either way, America is less safe," he said. 
Bush made a direct pitch to wavering Democrats, particularly moderates unsure about Kerry. 
"If you believe America should lead with strength and purpose and confi­dence and resolve, I'd be honored to have your sup­port and I'm asking for your vote," he said. 
In a gesture of modera­tion aimed at the same vot­ers, Bush told ABC-TV he supported civil unions for homosexual couples "if that's what a state chooses to do." The remark upset some conservatives who not only want to amend the Constitution to ban gay marriage, as does Bush, but also wou-ld bar state approval of gay civil. unions. 
Campaign pitches varied from deadly serious to almost silly. A radio ad reminded Wisconsin voters that Kerry got the name of their beloved Green B.ay Packers' football stadium wrong. Kerry recruited rocker Bruce Springsteen to play at his rallies.

Daniels campaign manager Bill Oesterle said the WISH poll findings were significant for several reasons. 
"Obviously we are very excit­ed, not just because of the lead but because with a third party

JAPAN 
Rescuers dig for quake survivors 
Associated Press 
NAGAOKA -A family of three-a motl-ier and her two toddltus -was rescued Wednesday after surviving four days buried in a land­slide fro;n the powerful quake that ravaged northern Japan OV!'r the weekend. 
The family's white van was swept away in a wave of boul­ders and earth that pulver­izPd the hillside road they WPre on when a 6.8-rnagni­tude quake ripped a·cross rural Niigata prefflcture on Saturday. killing at lflast 31 pPople. 
Firefighters dispatched from Tokyo dug steadily through the rocks and rubble Wednesday afternoon after hearing Takako Minagawa's voice in response to their calls. The family's van was discovered. on Tuesday. 
TV footage showed the two children -Mayu Minagawa, 
3. and Yuta Minagawa, 2 ­being pulled from the wreck­age by the rescuers, covered in mud after four days under the landslide. The workers continued digging to free the mother. 

The children were flown by helicopter to hospital, said Keiko Kondo. a spokeswoman for Tokyo Fire Department. 
The family had been the focus of intense interest in Japan after their car was spotted under the hillside rubble on Tuesday. TV sta­tions showed Minagawa 's father's desperate attempts to track down the family-in the post-quake chaos. 
The surprise rescue came hours after a powerful 6.1­magnitude quake rocked the region Wednesday morning, rattling already-damaged buildings and terrifying resi­dents. At least five people were injured. and some build­ings were damaged. 
Homeless people in evacua­tion centers threw themselves to the floor and screamed in horror as the Wednesday tem­blor rumbled through the rural area of Niigata prefec­ture. A 4.2-magnitude after­shock hit about 25 minutes later. 

The Japan Meteorological Agency said the stronger quake was centered at a depth of 6 miles in Hirokami, a village of 9,200 abouf 150 miles northwest of Tokyo. The agency warned another quake of similar strength could hit in the coming hours or days. 
Five people were injured in the Wednesday morning quake, but it was unclear if any of them were in serious condition. One man suffered a stroke from the shock of the quake, said Hisao Ishikawa of the Niigata prefectural gov­ernment. 
"Aftershocks are continuing, we don't know what the dam­age situation is yet," said Kazumasa Sakurai, an official at the Hirokami city hall. 
THAILAND 
Dozens of detainees suffocated, crushed 
Prime Minister apologizes for police's action 
Associated Press 
BO THONG -Thailand's prime minister apologized Wednesday for the deaths of 78 Muslim detainees who were suffocated or crushed while crammed into army trucks after a riot, but insisted that his security forces were. "soft" on the rioters. 
Grieving relatives, mean­while, flocked to a camp to claim the bodies and outraged Islamic leaders warned the deaths could worsen sectarian violence in the Muslim-domi­nated south of predominantly Buddhist Thailand, where more than 400 people have been killed this year in the revival of a long-simmering insurgency.

Shinawatra said that "there were sorrie mistakes," and that authorities lacked enough trucks to properly transport the 1,300 people arrested in Monday's riot in the sou.thern province of Narathiwat because it was a public holi­day. 
Authorities had to "pile them up on top of each other; and they died," he said. 
"We are sorry for that, sorry they met an untimely death." he told the Thai Senate. which had demanded an explanation for the deaths. 
But Thaksin insisted the mili­tary had used "the soft approach," and that soldiers "did not fire a single round into the crowd ... They fired into the air and used only clubs . and rope to tie their hands ­that's the normal practice for controlling mobs." 
Gen. Sirichai Thunyasiri, commander of a task force on security in that region, said the military used only four trucks to transport more than 1,300 detainees, and that they spent more than six hours in the vehicles before arriving at an army camp in a neighborihg province. 
Thaksin and other Thai offi­
cials have sought to pin part of the blame for the deaths on the detainees' weakness due to ·dawn-to-dusk fasting during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan1 saying they died of 
dehydration or suffocation. 
Many relatives wept Wednesday as a police spokesman read out names of the dead outside the Inkayuth­Borihan army camp in Pattani province. 
Muslim resident Wadamae 
Hajehding, 62, traveled 75 
miles from the scene of 
Monday's riot to the army 
camp in hopes of finding that 
his 23-year-old son was not 
among the dead. 
He said Thailand's security 
forces were "too cruel." 
"They treat us worse than 
animals," he said. 
The detainees were among 
abdut 2,000 people who 
clashed with police and sol­
diers outside a police station in 
Narathiwat province Monday 
while demanding the release of 
six Muslim militant suspects. 
At least seven people also were 
killed in the melee, apparently 
shot by security forces, and the 
overall death toll stood 
Wednesday at 85. 
Police and soldiers fired 
water cannon and tear gas, 
then shot into the air to try to 
scatter the crowd. 
After subduing the rioters, 
police and soldiers kicked and 
in some cases smashed rifle 
butts into young men as they 
were forced to slither bare­
chested across a road to the 
trucks that took them away. 
Authorities said some rioters 
were armed. Thaksin said 20 
pistols, seven assault rifles and 
three hand grenades were 
recovered at the scene. 
The death toll shocked mod­
erate Muslim leaders who 
accused security forces of 
overreacting -a charge they 
have repeatedly made as the 
government has failed to halt 
violence in the so.uthern 
provinces near Malaysia.

We stand on the eve of what will

Breaking the

compromised within the last four years. President George W. Bush and his administration of sorted corporate interests have misled both in the sense of being treacherous and dangerous for the American people. To stay on a path headed to ruin is folly. There are com­pelling, even staggering reasons to vote· for change in the White House. 
Today, we live in a world of harsh inequities.of wealth, political influence. health care, education and safety. The income gap has· become a daunting chasm of injustice. Not only are people separated by income. but also the hearts of the rich lind no kinship with the poor. Content to compile unneccl1~d wealth, the owning class selfishly turns hardship into profit by reducing work­er's wages and benefits. This "race to the bottom" makes basic survival on full-time work for minimum wage impossible for families. A job is more than a paycheck; it is our dignity, our livelihood and our gift to ourselves in old age·and our posterity. We need to value our citizens through instituting a living wage and ceasing impediments to collective bargaining for adequate and needed labor rights. 
All citizens must have equal access to the political process. The silencing of minority voices at the polls and in other facets of society endangers the fabric of our democracy. As Martin Luther King Jr. declared. "Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere;" we must embody that sentiment and treat the disenfranchisement of any citizens as ·a threat to our own civil liberties. We cannot impose democratic systems on other nations while our own political system is riddled with racism, sexism and class conflict. 
For too long, quality education in America has been situated as a privi­lege of the rich and well-off. while urban schools struggle with outdated books. badly-kept school buildings, budget cuts and under paid teaching staff'. The No Child Left Behind Act. under-funded and undermined by the Bush tax cuts. has done nothing to turn this tide of injustice. We need an actual commitment through adequate funding of this measure and further steps to minimize the education gap in Am'crica. 
In regards to foreign policy and U.S. leadership.in the world, much has been made about Bush's resolute and unwa­vering conviction to a single plan of . action. Indeed. the Bush administration does not change its stances too oftpn, but this is definitely not a positive attribute. As Noam Chomsky describes. Bush follows a strict line of policy deci­sions building U .S.-world hegmnony within a "lunatic doctrinal framework as it threatens survival." The war in Iraq, which is entering Vietnam-like territory with regards .to domestic and international opinion and difficulty in reaching a peaceful end with current leadership, has increased American insecurity and threat of terror. It does not deter terrorists from procuring weapons of mass destruction. particu­larly nuclear weapons. when the United States attacks a largely defenseless nation -Iraq-under falsilied and skewed reasoning while it deeds with nations like North Korea and Iran diplo­matically, knowing they have extensive weapons capabilities. It seems the Bush administration's incoherent message 
· will encourage anti-American entities to 
arm thcmselv1~s to prevent a U.S. ·attack on weakness. 
Additionally, our integrity in the world has greatly deteriorated since the beginning o'f the Bush reign. llis deci­sions to reject international. initi!ltivcs regarding biological and chemical weapons, the greenhouse effect and the reserving of outl~r space for peaceful purposes rel1ccts harmful unilateralism and disregard for other countries. Our power on the world stage rcquin~s U.S. participation in any global agremnent. While we may be abh~ to ensure our survival of biological weapon attack. by turning our back on international coali­tions and agreements to deter such aggression leaves our allies and defenseless countries open for attack. Further, this dismgard also aliPnates our ability to compile intdligence cru­cial to preventing another Sept. I I likP an attack on the UnitPd Statl~s or onP on our remaining allies. 
America rwnds a changP. and that change must lwgjn on Nov.~-\VP must not resign ourselves to inaction or sup­port of the status quo out of fear. Instead, we must carry tlw banrwr for peace and justice. which WP arP­when in solidarity-ablP to bring to this nation and this world. Sen . .John Kerry and Sen.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR 
Voting with a Catholic conscience 
I have always tried to vote my Catholic conscience. This Catholic conscience has led me to vote more often for Democrats than Hepublicans in the past 20 years, and not because they are exemplars of virtue or represent any Catholic ideal. Instead, like most people of good con­science, I "hold my nose and vote" for the least offensive candidate on the bal­lot. 
Single-issue voting is a poor use of judgment. God has given us the capacity to think through and weigh complexi­ties. Good people led by their conscience arrive at differing conclusions. This is why the Catholic Church embraces no single party or political ideology. 
Many students have asked me my opinion on the coming election. I would never presume to violate their con­science by insisting on one candidate over another, but I will manifest my own conscience as we all are preparing to vote. 
In the history of the wofld, only two nations have slaughtered 40 million of their own people: the Soviet Union under Stalin, and the United States of America under legalized abortion. No election of the past 30 years has been so critical as this one for the issue of abor­tion. With as many as three or four of nine Supreme Court justices likely to retire from a court already evenly divid­ed on a whole host of cultural-moral issues like abortion and stem-cell research, the next President will have a unique opportunity to set the tone of Constitutiqnal Law for then next genera­tion. On the issue of abortion, he will name those who wili decide if America will give its blessing to another 40 mil­lion deaths. 
Why is abortion so important? 
Abortion is America's dirty vast secret. This atrocity dwarfs the Holocaust by a factor of six (or by 12 or by 18, depend­ing on how you count), yet so few people 
talk about it. While abortion was made 
legal to give women freedom, they often 
become prisoners of the secrecy which 
shrouds their choice. Tiny, beautiful, innocent human 
children, whom our human 
nature is wired to protect, 
are not the only victims 
of this tragedy. Often 
decades after the 
fact, mothers who 
have made this 
choice face 
their own 
consciences 
in waves of 
sorrow, 
regret, guilt 
and shame 
when they 
see babies 
in 
strollers, 
see their. 
former due 
date on a 
calendar, 
see others 
about the 
same age as their child would have been or look in the eyes of their 

children and recall 
the missing sibling. This trauma from which 
millions of women suffer is 

now common, but remains virtual­
ly unspoken in public settings. In a soci­
ety that has dared go public with every 
shame and former taboo, one still 
remains: the stories of millions of 
women who can bear their troubled 
spirits only in the silence of prayer 
before God or before a trusted fdend or 
perhaps a priest in a confessional. Today, abortion in the distant past is an almost common confession in parish­es across America. Having seen the heartbreak of so many women, so many years after their choice, as a priest I can 
attest to the now clear truth. The choice of abortion is bad for 
women -and not only for women, but bad for their boyfriends, 
their future hus­bands, their pres­ent and future 
families. Anything else that would do so much 
damage, cause so much pain 
and endur­ing trauma would be illegal. 
The Church and the Gospel 
call us to weigh in a balance all 


the various moral and practical factors that go into elect­ing any politician. In past years abor­tion had not weighed as heavily for me as other life issues, such as the 
nuclear threat during the Cold War. This year I have tried honestly to weigh in that sacred inner scale of conscience the good of a greater care for the poor, the good of ending capital punishment, the good of being more dovish than hawkish in foreign policy, all these goods and more against the evil spectre of another 30 years of legalized abor­tion; perhaps another 40 million dead, another 40 million anguished mothers. another countless many who will have some hand in this ongoing tragedy­and I can't. 
The Catholic Church is the only institu­tion in this nation which has resolutely opposed the practice of abortion since its federal legalization in 1973. However, the Church has been opposed to abor­tion not only for the last 30 years, but for the last 2000. A Catholic who pub­licly professes to oppose his private con­science in order to gain office for him­self, betrays the fact that he has no understanding of conscience. It is our sacred inner knowledge of the truth, and of what is good and evil that tells us how we must act publicly, even if it means to give our own lives for it. This is the Gospel. 
Ironically, it was Edmund Burke, an 18th Century British statesman who lost his seat in Parliament for taking pro­Catholic and pro-Irish positions, who said, "All that is necessary for evil to tri­umph is that good [people) do nothing..." Likewise, it is a shock to consider that all that is necessary for legalized abor­tion to remain a "right" in our land for some decades into the future is for good Catholics, other Christians and all peo­ple of conscience on this issue to ignore their consciences in a single act on a single day this November. 
This year as never before, my con­science leads me to vote like that single­issue voter I have held in disdain in the past. But, my advice to anyone who wishes to hear it, remains the same: However you vote, vote your conscience, even if it means you have to hold your nose.

Live! From Notre Dame's campus 
Regis Philbin ma.kes the most ofa weekend visit to his alma mater 
By MARIA SMITH, CHRISTIE 
BOLSEN, and MOLLY GRIFFIN 
Scene Editor and Assistant Editors 
More than almost any top university, 
Notre Dame is a school whose loyal fan 
following has almost reached cult status, 
and talk show host Regis Philbin is one 
of its favorite sons. 
The celebrity personality has become a household name and naturally his fan base grows enormously around the alma mater to which he still maintains strong ties. 
Although Philbin's returns to campus always cause excitement, last weekend's visit was particularly unique. If having a chance to see the famous "Live! with Hegis and Kelly" broadcast from Notre Dame campus was not enough, South Bend fans also had a chance to witness the host's foray into vocal performance in a benefit concert for the Center for the Homeless. 
Philbin was born on August 25, 1933, and grew up in the South Bronx. He was named after his father's alma mater. a Manhattan Jesuit high school. He served in the Navy after graduating from the University of Notre Dame in 1953 with a degree in sociology. 
He began his career in Hollywood working in several entry-level jobs, such as serving as a film-delivery person for KCOP-TV in Los Angeles. At that job, he wrote satirical pieces about the station's newscasts and tape them on the wall. Through this work he earned his first job as a writer in the entertainment industry. His job as a news and sports writer for the station led to a series of other news and feature jobs in television and radio. Eventually, he worked his way up to taking on news anchor posi­tions. 
The first talk show Philbin appeared on was "The Regis Philbin Show" on KGTV in San Diego, and it was from this that the now-famous "host chat" seg­ment that is used to open most of his talk shows evolved. Philbin couldn't afford a writing staff with the small budget the show was given, so he would just begin by talking about his own opin­ions and experiences instead of working with a pre-written script to introduce the rest of the show. This job led to "Philbin's People", which won an Emmy, and discussed current events with a variety of well-known personalities. 
Philbin took over as the host of Steve Allen's late night talk show, and gained national exposure as a sidekick on "The Joey Bishop Show". He continued to host a variety of shows, including two morn­ing shows, "A.M. Los Angeles" and "Temp". and two game shows, "The Neighbors" and "Almost Anything Goes". 

He joined Cindy Garvey on New York's "The Morning Show" in 1983, but the show did poorly until Garvey was replaced by Kathie Lee Gifford in 1985. The show became nationally syndicated in 1988 under the now well-known name, "Live! With Regis & Kathie Lee", and Philbin was nominated seven times for his role as a co-host. · In 1999, Philbin signed on as host for the American version of a British game show, "Who Wants to be a Millionaire?", which became hugely successful. It cemented Philbin's position as a pop-cul­ture icon and made the query "Is that your final answer?" a popular catch phrase. He inked a $20 million deal with ABC to continue hosting, which was an unprecedented amount of money for a game show host. 
In 2001, Kathie Lee Gifford decided to leave "Live!" to pursue her musical career, and ratings actually went up after her departure and soap star Kelly Ripa was announced as her successor. "Live! with Regis and Kelly" remains an incredibly popular national morning talk show. 
Philbin's television charm is well known, but his love for old-time croon­ers like Frank Sinatra and Bing Crosby is less famous. During the benefit concert Sunday night Philbin related how he used to listen to Crosby while mopping the floors in the old Huddlemart, where he worked for two years while he was a student. 
Although Philbin had dreams of becoming a singer during the early years after his graduation, that career path didn't seem plausible enough to justify his degree. 
Unbeknownst to many fans, Philbin actually recorded an album of old Crosby numbers in 1968 after sponta­neously being asked to sing "Pennies from Heaven" on the Joey Bishop Show. "It's Time for Regis!" failed to launch a musical career, although his role as Bishop's sidekick obviously turned out more profitably. 
Philbin has since earned the comfort­able celebrity status of being able to branch out from his main focus for other projects that strike his fancy. On Sept. 28 he released ''When You're Smiling," his second album of jazz-pop standards. This recording includes favorites like "It Had to be You" and "Cheek to Cheek," as well as duets with Irish tenor Ronan Tynan for "Too RaJ Loo RaJ Loo Ral" and his wife Joy for "They Can't Take That Away From Me." 
If his performance at the Leighton Concert Hall with the Notre Dame Pops Symphony is any reflection of his record­ed work, it's probably not worth rushing out to buy the album for any but a truly devoted Philbin fan ..If proceeds from the $30 and $100 tickets went towards his television salary, those might not be worthwhile either. 
But as a benefit for the Center for the Homeless, the performance was enter­taining and fully worth the money. Philbin is not a musical prodigy, but he does not lack talent. Old rat-pack favorites suit the wiseacre, who probably would have fit in admirably among their ranks. Although he sometimes stretched for a note, charity creates a forgiving audience. Philbin filled in the time between songs with enough stories of his early career and audience interactions to entertain any fan. 
His performance of "Calendar Girls" with six women from. the audience who were supposedly called up to see if any of them would be a fitting replacement for Ripa on "Live! with Regis and Kelly" was an especially good combination of a favorite musical number and Philbin's particular style. 
The entire audience seemed to enjoy the show. Even if they had not, the $80,000 raised for the Center for the Homeless would clearly make the show a success. 
Philbin concluded his campus visit with a live broadcast of "Live! with Regis and Kelly" from the Leighton Concert Hall. As soon as Philbin stepped onstage, the audience in the Leighton Concert Hall discovered that the on-camera fun keeps rolling long after the cameras stop. 
Most of Philbin's wisecracking repar­tee with the audience took place behind the scenes, with a Red Bull-caliber ener­gy boost provided by guest Martin Short's constant tbeatrical antics. Philbin began the program outside to show off campus sights like the Golden Dome and the Basilica, while sidekick Kelly Ripa bantered with him from the studio in New York. 
The next segment, a video montage, followed Philbin before, during and after the Boston College game and was an entertaining piece that served as a flat­tering advertisement for the university. The camera crew caught shots of him greeting fans, tossing footballs around the quad; scaring away flocks of ducks and even visiting his old room in Zahm. Once there, he found Short dressed as a student who hadn't quite mastered the "getting down from your bunk bed with­out face-planting" maneuver. 
There was footage of Philbiri preparing 
for his benefit concert for the Center for 
the Homeless. The brand-new 
Performing Arts Center received much 
admiration on national television as 
Philbin gushed about the educational 
and entertainment benefits of the PAC, 
even jokingly predicting that the next 
Brando would be trained there. 
The pace picked up after Short, who was funnier off camera than on. joined Philbin onstage. While Kelly interviewed Judge Judy back in New York, the come­.dian helped Philbin keep the Notre Dame audience amused by telling jokes about Kelly and commenting on Judge Judy's outfit. Short was a one-man cabaret with his dancing around stage, and even played for a few impressive minutes on the piano before insisting 
that he was "too shy" to continue. 
On camera, the two discussed the loss 
on Saturday to the Eagles, and elicited 
cheers after Short proclaimed that the 
Irish were a better team anyway. Off 
camera, Short asked Philbin questions in 
an impromptu interview. 
"Out of all your guests. who's been the 
drunkest?" 
The cheerleaders and leprechaun mas­
cot Edward Lerum rehearsed for their 
appearance by leading the crowd in a 
cheer and lifting Short, who was wear­
ing a green hat and clutching two pom­
poms, into a mini-pyramid. 
"You'd tell me if I looked foolish, 
wouldn't you?" he asked. He also 
informed Philbin that if he fell, he would 
"take your entire university down with 
me." 
After musical guest Finger Eleven 
played back in New York, Philbin 
brought the national spelling bee winner 
and South Bend native David Tidmarsh 
onstage and challenged him to spell 
"shillelagh" correctly, which he did. The 
Notre Dame Glee Club also performed 
the fight song, although their perform­
ance was unfortunately cut short by the 
ending of the show. 
Philbin spent much of his time during 
the taping pretending to be annoyed 
with the crew, which was rushing 
around to coordinate his appearances 
with Kelly's. When he requested a tissue 
at one point, he wondered out loud if 
they had brought him used ones. This 
prompted a crew member to bring him 
an entire box, but his good-natured irri­
tation didn't end. 
"I kill myself for a stinking $500,000 a 
show!" he cracked later.

Second City performs at PAC 
The Legendary comedy troupe kept the audience laughing with improve, satire and Martin Short 

By SARAH VABULAS 
Scene Writer 
Friday night, one of comedy's leg­

·,1'endary groups came to Notre Dame's DeBartolo Performing Arts Center, performing in front of a packed house. While the audience was not made wholly of students, The Second City sketch and improvisational comedy did not fall by the wayside for the alumni that made their way into the seats of the Decio Mainstage Theatre. As the theatre lights came down, "Mad World" by Gary Jules -which one might know from the film "Donnie Darko" -grew louder, ceasing once The Second City cast assumed their positions on the stage. The Second City is currently celebrating its 45th Anniversary, therefore opening the show with a song about The Second City and what to expect in their show. The Second City is known for taking on current issues, political and other­wise. They certainly lived up to that reputation. After performing a satire about reality television shows, the cast wasted no time with poking fun at the recent Presidential debates, the media and current events. In the second act, 
they held a mock debate between three candidates. none of which really represented anyone involved in this election. This sketch took on a differ­ent meaning. They seemed simply to make ·up ridiculo'us stories about the candidates, as well as their positions on topics important to a presidential election. 
Since they were tackling issues through humor, the actors moved on to a mockery of marital counseling and the hilarious miscommunications between a husband and a wife that can lead to fights. One of their sketch­es talked about how when a woman says one thing, her husband should understand it as something else. This was one of the best skits the entire night, and the audience laughed until they nearly cried at parts. 
Following that, The Second City par­ticipated in one of their improv games, where the last line of the prior skit must be used as the first line for the proceeding one. 
A few more sketches and improv ses­sions followed before the first act con­cluded to make way for a short inter­mission. 
The second act began featuring cre­ative love songs from each decade since the '50s until present time. The actors sang and danced, while making fun of the music in each decade. 
A few more skits trailed before the closing song. But before anyone could make it out of the theatre, the acts reappeared for a completely impro-. vised third act with a special appear­ance by Martin "Short, who was on campus this weekend for the football game. Short was paired with one of the actor for a skit that poked fun at a student missing a final exam. 
Following the sketch, the actors paired up to make scenes from sug­gestions from the audience about places and objects that should be in the mini-skits. 
The Second City provided many laughs and entertainment for the audi­ence. This was a wonderful opportuni­ty for Notre Dame to have this talented group of actors perform. 
If you missed out on the performance The Second City is a short drive away to its Chicago theatre. For further information on The Second City or for tickets to future shows, visit their Web site at http://www.secondcity.com.

I 
I Memories of Stewart remain vivid for players 
Five years after the golfer's death, his peers reminisce 
Associated Press 
lAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. -Paul Azinger rarely plays in a golf tournament without something reminding him of Payne Stewart, and the memories were particularly strong during The Funai Classic at Disney. 
Monday marked the five­year anniversary of the plane crash that killed Stewart and five others. 
Disney was the last tourna­ment he played. 
Three days after he missed the cut by one shot, Stewart boarded a private plane for a meeting on a golf course project in Dallas and then to play the Tour Championship in Houston. The plane lost cabin pressure and flew 
uncontrolled across the 
country until it ran out of 
fuel and plunged into a field 
in South Dakota. 
Azinger and Stewart were partners for the first two pro-am rounds at Disney that year. Even though he shot 71-71, Stewart man­aged to make headlines by speaking in a mock Chinese accent on ESPN during a rain delay to retaliate for comments British golf ana­lyst Peter Alliss had made about the U.S. Ryder Cup team. 
"I watched him do it," Azinger said, smiling and shaking his head. "He comes over to me and says, 'Hey, that was pretty funny, huh?' I told him, 'Congratulations, Payne. You just insulted about 3 billion people."' 
Azinger remembers the loose lips, the pranks, the jabs. He remembers their favorite fishing spot behind the fifth hole on the Magnolia course, where they once came across a rattlesnake on a dirt path and hit 1-irons at it. Ask him about the Ryder Cup, and Azinger talks about the music Stewart brought: "Born in the USA" blared down the hallways of the hotel. 

Tom Lehman remembers, too. 
He delivered a powerful tribute to Stewart during a chilling ceremony before the start of the '99 Tour Championship, where an eerie fog shrouded the first fairway as players sat in shock. Lehman tries to have dinner with Stewart's widow, Tracey, every time he comes to Orlando for Bay Hill or Disney. 
"I think about Payne fairly frequently," Lehman said. "It could be anything-high­lights of a golf tournament, a guy in knickers, thinking about the Ryder Cup, coming to Orlando, getting on a pri­vate jet. You don't want to forget. I don't know if you want to dwell on what hap­pened five years ago, but you don't want to forget." 
Anyone who goes-in the locker room at Disney cannot forget Stewart. 
Past champions have their own row of lockers. Stewart's locker has a glass door to show its contents -a pair of red plus-fours on a hanger, a white shirt with his silhou­ette stitched in navy blue. A white tam-o'-shanter cap is on a hook above white shoes and a worn glove. A box of golf balls is on the top shelf. 
One look at the balls -a black box of Titleist Tour Prestige, a wound golf ball now obsolete -was a reminder of how long ago it seems that the reigning U.S. Open champion died. 
Even more startling was to see Stewart's son on the practice range early last week. Aaron i~ 15, a sopho­more on the junior varsity golf team at Olympia High in Orlando.

PIIILADELPIIIA -Allen Iverson scored 19 points, and Kyle Korver hit four 3-pointers and added 15 points to lead the Philadelphia 76ers to a 97-86 preseason victory over the Utah Jazz on Tuesday night. 
The Sixers played their first game with coach Jim O'Brien's new lineup and rotation. 
Glenn Robinson and Samuel Dalembert were dropped from Philadelphia's starting lineup when O'Brien announced he put the first stamp on his new team. 
O'Brien. named veterans Aaron McKie and Marc Jackson and rookie Andre lguodala to the starting lineup. McKie beat out Willie Green to be the starter at shooting guard, Iguodala gets Robinson's old spot at small forward, and Jackson takes over from Dalembert at center. 
Iverson, who will play point guard rather than shooting guard, and Kenny Thomas will be the other starters for Philadelphia's season-opener Nov. 3 against Boston. 
Philadelphia (6-1) used its seventh different starting line­up in seven exhibition games. This one, though, is going to stick. 
The new roles weren't reflect­ed in minutes or production. Green played 24 minutes and scored 13 points while McKie played 16 minutes, missed all three shots from the floor and had one point. 
Dalembert scored seven points in 24 minutes, and Jackson finished with four points in 17 minutes. Iguodala scored 10 points in 31 minutes. 
Iverson pumped his fist and jumped off the bench during a nifty, off-balance layup by Iguodala in the second half. 
Andrei Kirilenko led the Jazz (3-3) with 14 points and Carlos Boozer added 10. 
"The Sixers went 34-for-44 from the line, while the Jazz shot 27-for-33.

When a player returned a bat to the factory, Morrow wrote the date, the player's name and the city or team where the bat originated. Bushing said tlw markings increase the bat'.s value. which he guessed at between $100,000 and $125,000.

NBA 
Tim_berwolves rem_ain favorites with several returning players 
Associated Press 
MINNEAPOLIS The Minnesota Timberwolves are among the favorites in the Western Conference, largely because all the key players are back from last season's team that nearly made the NBA Finals. 
But with a week to go until the regular season, two of their biggest stars -Latrell Sprewell and Sam Cassell -have raised doubts about their long-term futures with the team. And Wally Szczerbiak has made it clear he wants a bigger role. 
Cassell and Sprewell, who form Minnesota's "Big Three" with league MVP Kevin Garnett. want contract extensions. 
Sprewell has publiely said he wants an extension before next the opener against New York or he'll ask for a sign-and-trade deal after the season or become a free agent. Cassell was upset enough about not getting an extension that he skipped the team's media day and first day of training camp. 
"Me and Spree, we deserve extensions," Cassell said this week. ''There's no other way to say it. You can't sugarcoat it." 
The Big Three formed the 
NBA's highest-scoring trio last season and led the Wolves to the Western Conference finals, where they lost in six games to the Los Angeles Lakers. But ·cassell barely played in that ·series because of a hip injury that caused painful back spasms. 
Cassell is convinced the out­
come would've been different 
had he been healthy. 
"I know for a fact we'd be cele­
brating our first championship in 
the city right now," Cassell said. 
Cassell, never one to bite his 
tongue, thinks the Wolves need 
to pay more if they want to keep 
him and Sprewell, who wasn't 
available to reporters after prac­
tice Tuesday. 
Neither Sprewell's agent, 
Robert Gist, nor Timberwolves 
owner Glen Taylor immediately 
returned phone messages seek­
ing comment. Cassell's agent, 
Charles Tucker, couldn't immedi­
ately be reached. 
Kevin McHale, Minnesota's 
vice pre~ident of basketball 
operations, has said he also 
wants to get Sprewell an exten­
sion before the season starts. 
Sprewell is due to make $14.6 
million this season. Last week, 
he told the St. Paul Pioneer Press 
he doesn't want to take a pay 
cut, but at 34, the Wolves could 
be hesitant to oblige.

COLLEGE FOOTBALL 
Brezina etnotionally walks away from. gam.e 
Georgia Tech player suffered from disease that causes narrowing ofspinal cord 
Associated Press 
ATLANTA -Brad Brezina 
feels just fine, which might be 
the worst part of all. 
If he wants to lift weights, go 
right ahead. If there's a pickup 
game down at the basketball 
court, he's in. 
He just can't do the one thing 
he loves more than anything _ 
play football for Georgia Tech. 
"I went and ran the other 
day. I'm in shape. I feel good," 
Brezina said. "My body feels 
perfectly fine to go out there 
and practice. It's tougher when 
I think about it in that regard." With a heavy heart, he has had to walk from the sport that took his father all the way to the NFL. Brezina, a sophomore who started the first four ·games of the season at offen­
sive guard, had little choice 
after experts on both coasts 
diagnosed a genetic condition 
that causes a narrowing of the 
spinal cord. 
If he continued to play, one 
good lick in the right spot 
could have left him paralyzed 
from the neck down. 
"''m not going to be stupid 
about this," Brezina said. "I 
had to look at all my angles, 
but when you get reports from 
two experts in the field, you're 
not going to overlook it by any 
means. There's no doubt this is 
the right decision." 
Not that it's easy to accept. 

Football runs in the family, most notably with his father. Greg Brezina was a linebacker for the Atlanta Falcons in the 1960s and '70s. His son yearned to follow the same career path. 
"It's been real tough," Brad said, struggling to hold back the tears. "This is something I've had a passion for since I was a kid. It's just one of those things you grow up wanting to do." 
-

After starting his college career on the defensive line, Brezina shifted to offense this season. He earned a starting job and seemed to have a bright future. · 
One jarring hit against Miami changed all that. 
Brezina has watched the play on film. He was doing all the right things as he prepared to block a linebacker -head up, shoulders back -but he knew right away that some­thing was wrong. Crumpling to the turf at Bobby Dodd Stadium, Brezina couldn't move his arins or legs for a few frightening seconds. 
"It's something I would not want to do again," he said somberly. 
Still, reality didn't set in immediately. Brezina regained the feeling in his limbs and wanted to go back in the game. He thought it was merely a "stinger" -a jarring of the spine that is common in foot­ball, causing temporary paral­ysis in extreme cases. 
Wisely, the trainers recog­nized that his condition was more serious.

Associated Press 
ST. LOUIS -Terry Francona knows better than to get com­fortable. 
He may have been sitting on top of the world, just one win away from bringing the World Series trophy back to a town that has waited 86 torturous years to throw itself a party, but the Red Sox manager hardly needed reminding how precarious that perch can be. He might be the last man in baseball, in fact, who needs to hear how this can be a fickle game. 
Hi's predecessor iri Boston was fired after getting within a game of the World Series, so there was never any doubt how the job description read the day Francona signed a contract. 
In Philadelphia, during his only previous stop as a big­league manager, Francona left the ballpark one day to find somebody had slashed his tires -on Fan Appreciation Day, no less. 
But that wasn't the only rea­son why, even after his Red Sox pulled steadily away to a 3-0 lead over the St. Louis Cardinals in the best-of-seven series, Francona fidgeted in the dugout and nervously shifted the plug of chewing gum in his mouth from cheek to cheek. 
"Anybody ever seen me play when I was a player?" Francona asked reporters after Boston's 4-1 win Tuesday night. "You can understand why I never get too confident." 

Self-deprecation is a lost art in the major leagues, but Francona could be the man to revive it. With one more victo­ry, he becomes living proof that nice guys don't always finish last. 
That was the rap against him in Philly, where Francona strung together an unimpres­sive 285-363 mark before being chased out of town in 2000 amid talk that his own players ran him over. 
But that was the strange thing about his rebirth in Boston. The very same quali­ties that made him a patsy in one clubhouse made him a hero in another.

ABC to bring Azinger, Faldo to the broadcasting booth 
The two last faced each other in a close Ryder cup final 
Associat<d Press 
LAKE BUENA VISTA. Fla. ­Paul Azinger and Nick Faldo are linked by a dynamic Ryder Cup match in which neither player wanted to lose, even after they had nothing to gain. 
In the final pairing at The Belfry in 1993, Faldo took the lead with an ace on the 14th. Azinger answered with a birdie to square the match. 
And although the United Statf\S already had clinched victory, they battled to the very end, with Azinger pouring everything into a 12-foot birdie on the 18th hole for a halve. 
"The last time I talked to Nirk Faldo. he shook my hand at the Hyder Cup," Azinger said. 
The nr.xt time could be in the broadcast booth at ABC Sports. 
Two sources connected to ABC, both speaking on condi­tion of anonymity, told The Associated Press that the net­work will announce next week at the Tour Championship

"I can't answer that," said Mar.k Loomis, wrapping up his first full season as ABC's coordinat­ing producer for golf. 
Azinger, who first dabbled in television at the '95 Ryder Cup when he was recovering from cancer, is among five players who worked sparingly with ABC this year as the network tried to find a replacement for Curtis Strange.

It would be the latest wrinkle in a season of change for Loomis, who was hired about this time last year when Jack Graham resigned as ABC's golf producer.

The biggest change was when Strange resigned in June after nine years in the booth. Strange turns 50 next year and will be eligible for the Champions Tour, although he was interested in staying with ABC if he could get a long-term

WORLD SERIES 

Associated Press 

ST. LOUIS -Get ready, Boston. There's no other outcome now: Pedro Martinez. Manny .Ramirez and the Red Sox will either win the World Series or add another historic col­lapse to their legend. 
They'll either reverse The Curse that's plagued the team since 1918 or they'll fall apart, just as they did the last four times they got this close. 
Martinez made his long· awaited Series debut a spe­cial one, bailed out when Ramirez and David Ortiz did as much damage w!th their arms as bats. Backed by the surprising show of defense, Boston cruised past St. Louis 4-1 Tuesday night for a 3-0 lead and left a crowd that loves its Cardinals booing the home team. 
Until this October, it was considered almost impossi­ble for any baseball team to recover from such a deficit in the postseason. No one had ever done it ­that is, until the Red Sox bounced back to stun New York in the AL champi­onship series. 
And now, after being only three outs away from get· ting swept last week, Boston is on the verge of sweeping the club that led 
IN BRIEF 

Foster latest Pacer bitten by
injury bug 
INDIANAPOLIS -Indjana Pacers center JefT Foster will have hip sur­gery Wednesday and is expected to miss four to six weeks, further depleting the team's front court. 
Foster is scheduled to undergo arthroscopic surgery on his right hip. He has been hampered by the injury since before training camp, but did­n't believe it to be serious until it flared up this week. 
"It's a clean-out type thing, not a tightening thing or reattachment deal," Pacers coach Rick Carlisle said Tuesday. "But it is weight bearing. So we'll just have to see." 
His emergence as a legitimate hus­tler and rebounder played a big role in the Pacers' success last season. He averaged 6.1 points and 7.4 rebounds in his first season as a starter. 
Scot Pollard, who has looked sharp in the preseason, will fill Foster's spot in the starting lineup. 
the majors in wins this year and claiming the ulti· mate prize. 
Derek Lowe will try to finish it off Wednesday night, with Jason Marquis starting Game 4 for St. Louis. 
Pitching a day after his 33rd birthday, Martinez threw seven innings of shutout ball, holding the limp Cardinals to three hits and retiring his final 14 batters. 
Ramirez put Martinez ahead with a first-inning homer and the three-time Cy Young winner held it, helped by superb defense and shaky baserunning. Added up. the Red Sox set a team record with their seventh straight postsea­son win. bettering the streak of six capped ofT by Babe Ruth's win in the 1916 Series. 
That Martinez won was hardly amazing. That Boston's defense con­tributed was downright shocking. 
The Red Sox made eight errors and still won the first two games. 
This time, they were flawless in the field -and maybe even better than that. 
Ramirez threw out Larry Walker at the plate from left field to end the first inning. 

Foster's injury is the latest to hit the front court. Forward/center Jermaine O'Neal could be held out of the remaining preseason games with a nagging ligament strain in his left foot, and rookie David Harrison has missed time with a shoulder injury. Man sentenced in baseball

Pete Marron, 20, was convicted in August of first-degree murder in the Sept. 19, 2003, killing of Marc· Antenorcruz, 25. The jury also found Marron guilty of using a handgun in the attack.

withdrawal 
BASEL, Switzerland -Roger Federer pulled out of the Swiss Indoors after hurting his left thigh in a practice session Tuesday, while Taylor Dent and Paradorn Srichaphan exited with upset losses. 
The top-ranked Federer will need to rest up to two weeks and could miss the Paris Masters and season~ ending Tennis Masters Cup, which starts Nov. 17 in Houston. 
As a kid, Federer was a ball boy at this tournament, which he's never won. 
"This is a huge disappointment for me, clearly," said Federer, the first man since 1988 to win three Grand Slam titles in a season. "But all I can do is wait again until next year." 
The man who replaced him in the draw. Bohdan Ulihrach, reached the second round when Luis Horna quit with lower back pain after losing the first set 6-1.

NFL 
Bengals save pride and season 

Associated Press 
CINCINNATI -Now that 

they've  won  their  first  
Monday  night  game  in  a  
dozen  years,  are  the  

Cincinnati Bengals capable of something even more unex­pected? 
Chad Johnson is convinced of it. 
Shortly after the Bengals saved face and their season with a 23-10 victory over Denver, the receiver who made it happen was asked if his last-place team is capable of another playoff run. 
"Yes," he said, without hesi­tation or elaboration. There is a precedent, though it may not apply. 
The Bengals were 1-4 -the same as last season -when they pulled themselves togeth­er for their first "Monday Night Football" appearance since 1992. Johnson led the way with seven catches for 149 yards, repeatedly beating Pro Bowl cornerback Champ Bailey. 
The Bengals are still lan­guishing at the bottom of the AFC North, but they're no longer a lost cause. 
Same as last season. 
Cincinnati crawled out of an identical start in coach Marvin Lewis' first season by winning six of its next seven games, moving up to 7-5 and a first-place tie with Baltimore. The Bengals stayed in contention until the final week, finishing two games behind the Ravens at 8-8. 
"We were 1-4 last year and we bounced back." Johnson said. "We were 1-4 this year and we bounced back." 
They did it once, why not again? 
Well, the schedule is much more daunting. The final three road games are in Baltimore, New England and Philadelphia. 
And the Bengals (2-4) have yet to prove they're anything more than a creation of prime time television. Their two vic­tories are 16-13 over Miami at home on Sunday night, and the upset over Denver at home on Monday night. In their four day games out of the natiomi.l spotlight, they've looked half-asleep. 
Maybe they're just noctur­nal. 
"We're pretty good at night," quarterback Carson Palmer said. "The atmosphere is just unbelievable. You could tell that Cincinnati wanted a Monday night game for a long time. We really fed off of them. It was crazy all night long. The intensity they brought really kind of pro­pelled us through this game, especially defensively." 
Palmer's 50-yard touch­down pass to Johnson got the Bengals ahead, but it was the defense that kept them there. One of the league's lowest­ranked units had two inter­ceptions, forced a fumble, got three sacks and kept the Broncos (5-2) in check for most of the night. 
For the first time since that Sunday night win, the defense played like something impor­tant was at stake. 
It was. 

"We had our backs to the wall, we're playing on nation­al television, it's early in the season and we're 1-4," line­backer Brian Simmons summed up. "It feels good. but keep in mind we're only 2-4. There's no reason we can't play this way every week."

In addition to Stewart and Sawyer, defender Kevin Goldthwaite has also been stellar in the back since returning from injury in late September.

Graduating 35 of 38 goals from last year's Sweet 16 squad, to say the Irish were unsure where the tallies would come from at the beginning of the sea­son would be an understate­ment. 
"Ask m~ [who will score the goals] at the end of the season, and I'll be able to answer your question," coach Bobby Clark said during preseason action. 
Forwards Justin Detter ·04 goals) and Devon Prescod (12 goals) and midfielder Greg Martin (six goals) accounted for 32 of the team's 38 goals last season. 
Goldthwaite, Stewart and sophomore midfielder Ian Etherington were the only play­ers currently lacing up the boots 
'The scoring realty fell to two main players last year," Clark said after Notre Dame's second and final preseason game. "I think the way to cover that is to get goals from a lot of different areas and not rely on solely one or two guys. 
"Can we actually get goals from four, five or even six differ­ent areas? 
"I think that's possible this year." 
Clark's comments appear prophetic several months later as a handful of young Irish play­ers have stepped up and shoul­dered the goal-scoring burden. 
Junior forward Tony Megna (five goals) and sophomore for­ward Justin McGeeney (five goals, one assist) have spear-four assists), Etherington (three goals, five assists), sophomore midfielder Nate Norman (two goals. two assists) and freshman forwards Alex Yoshinaga (three goals, two assists) and Joe Lapira (two goals. two assists) have frequently contributed. 


Both Megna and McGeeney currently sit fifth in the Big East in goals scored with five each while Etherington's five assists rank sixth in the conference. 
The young unit leads the Big East in a pair of offensive cate­gories -shots (291) and corner kicks (101) -and ranks third in both goals (26) and assists (23).

playoffs, the team still expects to play at a high level. 
"We definitely will come out with some intensity, because we're not the type of team to give up," Herdman said. 
"We'll try to upset some other people's seasons if we can, and try to get as many wins under 

-
our belt." 
Unlike their first game of the year, however, the Belles will no longer have the advantage of playing on their home field. 
"They [Hope] are tough to play at home, and they're prob­ably not happy about us beat­ing them earlier in the year," Herdman said. 
"We'll try to show them today that that's the way it should be." 
In their last four games on the road, the Belles have been unable to post a victory, and their road record for the year stands at 1-4-1. 
"We'll be looking to improve on our road record, because it's clear to see that road games have been a problem for us," Artnak said. "We have two away games left, and it would be nice if we could put two more points in the win column there." 

Even with high expectations gone unfulfilled, a second win against Hope would leave the Belles feeling confident about their season. 
"Hope is a strong team, and beating the top conference team is always a big accom­plishment; even if we don't make the NCAA, the season has still been very successful," Herdman said. 
"We've got a great record, we've played some amazing games, and we've beat some very good teams in this confer­ence. Just because we didn't pull off everything we should have doesn't mean this season wasn't a success."

in each of their last nine contests (8-0-1 during the stretch). 
Although the Irish may not light up the scoreboard night-in and night-out, in the end. they've gotten the job done, as evidenced by Notre Dame claim­ing its first regular season con­ference crown since the Irish joined the Big East in 1995 with a 2-0-1 conference road trip over fall break. 
Should the aggressive young offense continue to buttress what has been a shut-down defense, the Irish may achieve yet another "first" come NCAA tournament time -a national championship.

and those three games really make your season," Willingham said. 
Even after the blowout loss to Purdue, Willingham and the coaching staff kept the team focused on possibly qualifying for the Bowl Championship Series by getting to nine wins. 
Now with a third loss, it's very unlikely the Irish will reach that level. 
Willingham and his staff haven't talked to the players about it much, but he knows the best the team can do is to win out and to see what hap­pens.

Irish to regroup, recover 
Bye week allows the team an opportunity to rest and prepare 
for Tennessee

-
By MATT LOZAR Sports Writer 
After the disappointing loss to Boston College, the first instinct for a lot of players is to want to get back out as soon as possible and play again. 
But the Irish aren't in that sit­uation. Thanks to the moving of the 

Brigham Young game to Sept. 4, the Irish have a bye after· Saturday's disappointing loss and an extra week to prepare for a tough road trip to Neyland Stadium at the University of Tennessee. 
And they're looking to capi­talize on the situation. 
"When you have a bye situa­tion, you have to learn to use it to your advantage. Right now, our advantage, it gives us some extra time to get rid of the feel­ing we have and get back in the saddle," Willingham said. 
"Sometimes you can have a hangover from a defeat, so hopefully, the time that we have, the extra week, will give 
During the postseason, one which saw the Irish reach the Sweet 16, Batteast averaged a double-double -22 points and 
11.7 rebounds per game, to go along with a .48"3 field goal per­centage. 
Last season was the third in a row Batteast was named to the all-Big East team. 
Entering the 2004-05 cam­paign, Batteast is in 11th place on the Notre Dame all-time scor­ing list, with 1,315 career points. 
She has started 64 straight 

games for the Irish. and 86 of the 90 games played in her three years at Notre Dame .. 
Already this preseason, Batteast has been named a pre­season All-American and award nominee by four other publica­tions. 
She was selected to the Wooden's Women's Award Preseason All-America team, meaning ~he is one of 30 candi­dates for the Wooden Award given to the top women's basket­ball player. 
She was also named to the watch list for another top award. the State Fartn Wade Trophy. 
Lindy's named Batteast a pre­season first team All-American. Finally, Street & Smith's named her to its ''Terrific 10" list of the nation's top players. 
Batteast hails from Washington High School in South Bend.

Tennessee."  
Wide  receiver  Rhema  
McKnight agrees.  

"It's actually good for us because we've been waiting for a bye week for awhile now," he said. 
"Guys have been beat up, still working pretty hard, but get a chance to rest and be ready for Tennessee." 
The Irish were devastated after the game Saturday. Their emotions will recover over time.

MEN'S SOCCER 

Sawyer, Stewart dominate 
By MATT PUGLISI Sports Writer 
While the old adage "If they don't score, you can't lose" is certainly true, by the same token, if you cah't score, you can't win, either. 
Heading into the season, the Irish knew exactly what they would be getting from their nationally-acclaimed defense. 

-
Anchored by a pair of 2004 Hermann Trophy Watch List members-the most prestigious honor in college soccer-in defender Jack Stewart and goal­keeper Chris Sawyer, the defense has certainly not disap­pointed. It yielded one goal or less in 15 of 16 contests thus far this season-only then-No. 1 Indiana managed to sneak more than one by Sawyer in a 2-0

Belles fight for life in 
playoffs against Hope 
Game expected to determine the rest of the team's season 
By RYAN DUFFY Sports Editor 

Though they won't make the NCAA Tournament this year. the Belles know they can hang with the best of them. 
Saint Mary's will get to prove just how talented their team is when they face off today against Hope College, which currently sits atop the standings in the MIAA confer­ence. 
"Hope is a very strong team. and the games against them are always good because they're top competition," sen­ior captain Jen Herdman· said. "We're all excited for today's game. Hopefully, we'll have some better luck on the road and take home a win." 
The Belles looked strong in their first meeting with Hope this season, pulling out a 2-0 victory at home. The loss to Saint Mary's is the only con­ference loss for Hope all year, and both teams eagerly antic­ipate a rematch. 
"We're excited because we always enjoy playing Hope," senior Shannon Artnak said. "They're another high caliber team that plays a style of soc­cer similar to ours." 
Although the rematch against Hope was expected to be the deciding factor in whether the Belles made the
