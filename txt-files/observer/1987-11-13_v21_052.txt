registration 
By LISA M. MONTPETIT News Staff 
A new registration procedure for Saint Mary's students begins next week in the south lounge of Regina Hall. 
Before students can register for core classes and electives for the Spring se­mester, they must complete an advise­ment form to be signed by their ad­visors, said Sister Francesca Kennedy of the Registrar's Office. Students who arrive at registration without a com­pleted and signed form will be turned away, she said. 
The new registration procedure also enters all class selections directly into a computer. Students will no longer have to stand in separate lines to obtain computer cards for each class. Each student will leave registration with a printed copy of her completed schedule. 
Registration begins next Monday with the seniors. The signed advise­ment form will be stamped for admit­tance into the south lounge. At one of five computer terminals students' se­lections will be checked for openings. If available, a space in the class is then reserved. 
Any pre-registration that took place in the departments will already be on file.

No plan yet for payment of damages 
By CHRIS BEDNARSKI News Editor 
The Hall Presidents' Council decided 
Thursday to ask the classes and student 
government to help pay the $1,400 in 
food fight damages but did not come 
up with a specific plan for dividing the 
bill, said Bob Daley, HPC co-chairman. 
HPC members will meet before Mon­
day's student senate meeting to devise 
a formula, he said. 
Last Friday, HPC members met with John Goldrick, associate vice president for residence life. Goldrick said the stu­dent body as a whole should take responsibilty for the damages which resulted from the food fights following the victory over Michigan because as many as 800 students were involved, HPC members said. 
Goldrick placed no restrictions, guid­lines or a deadline on how or when the bill should be paid, Daley said. 
A plan to collect the money through a fundraiser was rejected, Daley said. "That would draw too much attention," he said. "We want to get it out of the way as soon as possible." 
Though Daley said he hoped the whole student body would go along with the plan, "It's more important that the student leaders agree," he said.

Hare Krishnas also tricked on-campus students

Notre Dame students on­campus reportedly have been solicited by the same group of Hare Krishnas who have con­ducted door-to-door campaigns at Campus View Apartments. 
Residents of Alumni, Fisher, Pangborn and Grace Halls con­firmed reports of solicitations before and after October break. Notre Dame Assistant Director of Security Phil Johnson said his department received information "from a couple of halls."

Cease-fire plan is 'concrete' 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega, after talks with House speaker Jim Wright, said Thursday he has come up with a "concrete pro­posal" for achieving a cease­fire with the Contra rebels. 
Ortega, here for a meeting of the Organization of American States, told reporters he will announce his plan on Friday. 
There were stong hints that the proposal would include a role for Wright in the efforts to reach a cease-fire, but Ortega said he could not provide details because "we're still refining all of this." 
As Ortega spoke, Nicaraguan Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo, who has been designated intermediary in pending cease-fire talks be­tween the Sandinista forces and the Contras, was heading for Washington and was ex­pected to take part in the Friday announcement. 
Congressional sources said last week that Wright had declined an offer to serve as a cease-fire intermediary be­tween the Sandinistas and the Contras because he did not have the time and felt that such a role was inappropriate for someone outside of Central America. 
But meetings Wednesday and Thursday between Wright and Ortega left the impression that the speaker may have agreed to play a role. 
Wright has been an influen­tial figure on the Central Amer­ican issue and the signs of cooperation between him and Ortega contrasted sharply with Reagan administration efforts to shun diplomatic contacts with the Sandinistas. 
At a news conference Thursday morning, Ortega ac­cused President Reagan of reneging on a promise Reagan was alleged to have made last August to hold direct talks with Sandinista authorities.

Assistant News Editor 
I had never seen such a deathly quiet crowd of football fans as the one watching the band before the USC game. Of course, my fellow busi­ness and econ majors continue to reassure me that although Wall Street has gone to the bears, all talk about an upcoming depression is a bunch of bull. But then President Reagan kept repeating ''the economy is fundamentally sound" while the index fell even further--much like the Wizard of Oz saying, "Ignore that man behind the curtain." 
Economists downplay Crash II because they are in the business of faith --that's why they call the foundation of our economy a fiduciary system. True the stock market has stabilized at a level $1 trillion poorer. To ensure this, however, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan has had to lower interest rates--all of which amounts to nothing more than another form of taxation through devaluating the dollar. The height of irony was of course that the Secretary of the Treasury had to beg the West Germans to lower their interest rates. Sooner or later, with debts soaring into space and the dollar on the verge of becoming as valuable as lira, we just better hope the Europeans are nice enough

Impact of drastic cuts in nuclear arms discussed 

By NATASHA WILSON Staff Reporter 
"It is difficult to forsee the total elimination of nuclear weapons from this earth with­out drastic changes in the in­

ternational  order,"  physicist  
Wolfgang  Panofsky  said  
Thursday.  

''The reason for this some­what pessimistic conclusion lies in the very nature of nu­clear weapons. The explosion of even a small number of nu­clear weapons can wreck un­speakable havoc," said Panofsky in a lecture entitled "Under What Circumstances Are Drastic Cuts in Nuclear Weapons Feasible?" 
The speech, sponsored by Notre Dame's Institute for In­ternational Peace Studies, was the second in a series on "The Cost of Militarism." 
Panofsky, director emeritus of the Stanford Linear Ac­celerator Center, said the 

Duped

A leader of the ISKCON Ap­palachian Projects was con­tacted last week in Moundsville, West Virginia, the site of a major Hare Krishna community. 
Dahlen said the man indi­cated he had permission from the University, but that "his su­pervisor" had the letter from Notre Dame. 
There was no confirmation that Appalachian Projects had a permit, but Du Lac states that "no door-to-door sales or solicitation in the dormitories" will be permitted, even if the group has authorization to so­licit on campus. 
Du Lac states that "University-approved organi­zations, campus residence halls and individual students are eligible to apply for a per­mit allowing them to engage in a merchandising activity on the Notre Dame campus." ISKCON does not meet any of those criteria. 
Alumni junior Richard Abood said he was one of four or five people he knew who donated money to Appalachian Projects before October break. He said the solicitor gave them Notre Dame hats and stickers with the logo of the Grateful Dead. 
Abood, who donated $10, said he did not know if the hats were officially licensed by Notre Dame, but last week Notre Dame Assistant General Coun­sel Pat Lyons said ISKCON is being investigated for copyright infringement of col­lege and university logos and professional sports teams. 
Abood said none of his group informed anyone of the solicita­tion and did not think much of the donations until the Obser­ver story ran last week. 
Johnson said individuals caught soliciting without a per­mit will be asked to stop. "Failure to heed that warning will result (in a trespassing ar­rest)," he said.

world leaders "have not analyzed the possibility of ac­hieving success (in arms con­trol) along the direction of traditional paths." 
"Let me warn you from the outset," he told the audience, "not to expect a declaration of a clear solution." He said, however, "the level of reduc­tion is going much further than those now on the bargaining table at Geneva." 
At Reykjavik last year, Reagan and Gorbachev dis­cussed limiting or eliminating intermediate range nuclear missles and reducing by fifty percent central strategic forces over a five year period. Disagreement on the quota of SDI (Strategic Defense Initia­tive) led to the termination of the meeting. 
Panofsky added many of the proposed reductions were am­biguous. The leaders promised to reduce "something" in Europe in the next ten years, he said. 
Discussion has proceeded to the point that most recently Reagan and Gorbachev have agreed to meet Dec. 7 to dis­cuss more reduction plans, Panofsky said. He said he ex­pects negotiators to concen­trate next month on the ques­tion of verifying or policing the reductions. 

He added they should also consider ways to extend verification of "third party weapons," those based on the soil of U.S. allies. 
The physicist contends that much of the current negotiation is too political in nature and of­ten fails to consider the human lives involved. 
A fifty percent reduction of all nuclear weapons by the su­perpowers "would be rela­tively insignificant." "If you woke up tomorrow and found out that the total number of nu­clear weapons had been reduced by a factor of two, the world would hardly have changed. The potential for human suffering would be the same.

Summit schedule announced 

Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev is expected to arrive in Wash­ington late in the day on Dec. 7, hold three days of working meetings with President Reagan beginning Dec. 8 and depart on Dec. 10, the White House said Thursday. 
Giving a preliminary schedule for the Reagan­Gorbachev summit, spokes­man Marlin Fitzwater said, "The Soviet team indicated some amusetnent at the stories of an extended stay and did not give any indica­tion that would be the case." Several published reports earlier this week said Gor­bachev was seriously con­sidering staying longer. 
Fitzwater said Gorbachev wants to hold a press confer­ence before leaving but that the time and location have not been determined. 
The spokesman said it was not clear yet if Reagan would see Gorbachev on Dec. 7, a Monday. The for­

might be delayed until Dec. 8, a Tuesday, he added. 
"Generally speaking, there will be working ses­sions each day, beginning Tuesday, Dec. 8," Fitzwater said. He said it was envi­sioned that the meetings would take place at the White House. 
A state dinner for Gorbac­hev likely will be scheduled Tuesday night at the White House, followed by a reciprocal dinner given by Gorbachev for Reagan the next night. 


Cut may increase abortions, deaths 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -The planned cutoff of U.S. money for inter­national planned parenthood programs could result in 1,200 maternal deaths and 69,000 ad­ditional abortions worldwide over the next three years, ac­cording to a study released Thursday. 
The study by University of Michigan researchers also con­cluded that the cutoff would lead to an additional 311,000 live births over three years.

ding for Family Planning In­ternational Assistance is scheduled to end Jan. 1, the group's U.S. parent organiza­tion, planned Parenthood Federation of America, said Thursday. 
The Agency for International Development will not renew the funding because the group has rejected a demand that it not assist foreign family plan­ning programs that include abortion or abortion counsel­ing, even if they use their own funds rather than U.S. money. 
This cutoff will have a direct affect on human beings and on misery, said Faye Wattleton, president of Planned Paren­thood. 
Rather than reducing abor­tions, it will lead to 69,000 more of them, as well as increases in maternal deaths and un­planned births, she said, citing a study done for her group. 
An AID spokesman said later Thursday "the premise of the study appears to be based on assumptions that (a) family planning funds will be reduced and (b) if Planned Parenthood does not provide the services. no one else will. Both are wrong. Family planning fun­ding has not been reduced and other organizations are ready to pick up any slack that may occur as a result of Planned Parenthood taking itself out of the program." 
"This administration strongly supports family plan­ning. It does oppose abortion. Planned Parenthood is trying to turn a fight over abortion into a fight over family plan­ning," said the spokesman, who declined to be identified. 
"This is an administration that's out to defund the left and, boy, Planned Parenthood is the pelt they're wanted on their wall for years," commented Sharon Camp, vice president of the private Population Crisis Committee. 
Already other administra­tion cuts in population pro­grams, based on abortion policies in other nations, have had an impact on family plan­ning around the world, she said.

"I think he'll make a fine member of the Supreme Court," Helms, R-N.C., an out­spoken member of the Senate's conservative wing, told reporters after meeting sepa­rately with Reagan and with the federal appellate judge. However, a spokeswoman said Helms wouldn't make a deci­sion until after confirmation hearings. 
Late last month, after the Senate voted down Reagan nominee Robert Bork, Ken­nedy was considered the front­runner for the court vacancy until Helms said there was no way he would support a Ken­nedy nomination and other con­servatives also indicated dis­pleasure. Reagan then nominated Douglas Ginsburg, who withdrew last weekend after admitting past marijuana use. 
The president also met with 
Democrat Joseph Biden, chair-

man of the Judiciary Commit­tee, as Kennedy made courtesy calls on senators, many of whom have reacted favorably but cautiously to the nomina­tion. · 
The Judiciary Committee's top-ranking Republican, Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, also took part in the White House meetings. He told reporters conservatives would

everybody."  

On Capitol Hill, during a meeting with Senate Republi­can Leader Bob Dole and other GOP senators, Kennedy, 51, said, "I like this; it's been won­derful." 
"If anyone has a chance to be confirmed, he does," Thur­mond said of Kennedy before the White House meeting. 
He urged confirmation by Christmas, but Biden indicated there would be no vote before the Senate returns early next year from its year end recess. 
Reagan, in introducing Ken­nedy at the White House on Wednesday, adopted an apolo­getic tone in regard to the contentious previous nomina­tions and praised his new nominee as a "courageous, tough but fair jurist." 

Funeral for battered child attended by hundreds 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK -Elizabeth 
Steinberg's natural mother and 
hundreds of strangers 
Thursday mourned the death of 
the 6-year-old who was found 
beaten in her adoptive parents' 
apartment, a death a rabbi said 
he hoped would save the lives 
of other children. 
"We kick ourselves. Why 
couldn't we see, why couldn't 
we tell?" Rabbi Dennis Math 
asked at a funeral after more 
than than 1,000 people paid 
their respects at Elizabeth's 
coffin. 
"We must risk being wrong, 
embarrassed, or even evoking 
a neighbor's anger when we 
feel a child is being harmed," 
said Math, who conducted a 
joint service with a Catholic 
priest. "May Lisa's death help 
to save the lives of other 
children. Then her life will be 
sanctified." 
The child's natural mother, Michelle Launders, saw her newborn daughter for only 20 seconds before giving her up for adoption, but fought in court for the right to bury the child because she did not want it to be done by "the people who killed her." 
Police found Elizabeth com­
atose and brain dead Nov. 2 in 
lawyer Joel Steinberg's Green­
wich Vilage apartment. 
A judge ruled Tuesday that Elizabeth was never legally adopted, and sources familiar with the investigation said Thursday that police were still trying to determine whether the girl was a commodity in a black market baby-selling ring. 
Steinberg, a lawyer, and his live-in lover, Hedda Nus­sbaum, are charged with mur­der and endangering the wel­fare of a child in the case. 
Cardinal John O'Connor was among more than 1,000 visitors to the casket of the girl whose death outraged the city. The coffin was surrounded with small individual bouquets from visitors as well as larger floral arrangements. 
Other cards and letters from mourners who had never met the girl were left beneath or atop the casket. 
"To Lisa, God bless you," read a hand-made card with flowers drawn in crayon from 9-year-old Padre Smith. "I hope the angels watch over you." 
Mourners, many weeping openly, filed past the white steel casket in a steady stream Thursday morning at the Red­den Funeral Home.

Trade gap eases, market rallies 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -The nation's trade deficit eased to $14.1 bil­lion in September, the govern­ment reported Thursday in sta­tistics that suggested the U.S. import-export picture was brightening even before the stock market crash. 
The report, marking the lowest trade shortfall in four months, touched off a rally in the financial markets. 
The Commerce Department said the merchandise trade deficit, the gap between im­ports and exports, decreased by a strong $1.6 billion in Sep­tember from the $15.7 billion level of August.

5 MINUTES STRAIGHT EAST OF THE ACC 
The Dow Jones industrial average surged 69 points by early afternoon while the dol­lar, which had sunk to new 40­year lows earlier in the week, rallied strongly in New York, rising more than 1 yen in value to 136.35 yen. It also was sharply higher against European currencies. 
Although much of the trade improvement came from a decline in oil imports, imports of manufactured goods also fell while exports of U.S.-made products rose sharply. 
Economists took this as a sign that the long-awaited tur­nabout in trade accounts from a declining dollar may have fi­nall be un, and that it started weeks before the Oct. 19 stock market collapse. 
"Two and a half years after the dollar peaked, we are fi­nally seeing an effect on both imports and exports," said Robert Wescott, chief econo­mist for Alphametrics, a Philadelphia forecasting ser­vice. 
Last month's disappointing report on the August trade def­icit, which showed a smaller­than-anticipated improvement from the $16.5 billion shortfall in July, has been widely cited as one of the factors that helped trigger the stock market col­lapse. 
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the new figures were "especially en­couraging" because they in­cluded a gain in the export of manufactured goods. "These numbers should be received well," he said.

Student Body Vice President Laurie Bink said she also would support a plan to divide the ex­pense. "My feeling is that someone has to pay for it," she said. There is no way to single out those directly responsible, she added. 
There may be some trouble, however, getting the student senate to agree to a plan, Bink said. "There have been some questions as to whether or not the whole student body should be responsible or not," she said. "There could be some

Senior recalls four years of home games 
P.O. Box Q 
Make a commitment to stop DUI at NO 
Dear Students at Notre Dame: 
On December 6, almost one year ago, we received the phone call that is every families' nightmare. A call that ir­revocably altered our lives. Michael had been killed in an accident. Our strong, happy, vibrant son whom we last saw boarding a train, anxious to return to his friends at Notre Dame was lost to us. His dreams ended in a split second because of a needless act. A finality that no human power could reverse. We are still living the trauma and shock. 
It was a short time afterwards that the perceived cruelty that life goes on as usual revealed itself to us. Life will and must go on. Mike would want his family and friends to participate in the glory of life. In our lives the sun will never be as bright, but it will still shine.

Our comfort is knowing how much Mike loved living and the positive affect his short life had on others. He was so happy at Notre Dame with his friends, studies, music and sports. He was proud to be a member of the Notre Dame family. For this reason, it hurts us deeply to have Mike referred to as a tragedy. His essence was the oppo­site. 
At his death we received hundreds of cards and letters from you at Notre Dame. We were aware of the tremen­dous outpouring of grief evidenced by the attendance at Mass for Mike. We have no doubt that any one of you would have made any commitment to have Mike back at Notre Dame or to help us in our pain. The former could never be but the latter can. 
As the first year since Mike's death approaches you, his fellow students, could take a strong committed position --never drink and drive and never remain passive when a fellow student

"The fact that Notre Dame is considered one of the out­standing universities in the land still seems overshadowed by the memories of Rockne and Gipp." 
Sports Illustrated September 22, 1986 

You will make a commitment that a family never will receive an early mor­ning telephone call advising them their worst fear is reality. You will be telling us that our Mike's life and death was not just a tragedy.

Saturday will be the last time I watch a Notre Dame home football game as a student. 
Sigh. 
Gee, four football seasons do go by pretty quickly. It seems like yesterday that I was standing in Notre Dame Stadium watching the Irish trample gleefully over hapless Colorado. (Even though the Purdue game was officialy a home game, I do not consider travell­ing down to Indianapolis the same as walking across campus to the staduim.) Standing in section 33, doing all the "freshman" kind of things like the Wave and passing girls up towards the top row. 
Eric Bergamo 
20 seconds into the future 
This year my seat is in row 23, seat 8, and to the girls who said it was their seat, I will gladly show you my ticket (and watching this year's freshmen doing the same thing I did when I sat in their section.) 
And next year I'll probably come back for a game, but it will not be the same. Once you become the peculiar social class known as "alumni" stand­ing in Notre Dame Stadium to watch the Irish somehow changes. (Did you notice that most of them sit, not stand like we, throughout the game. For me the habit will be hard to break.) 
But before I pull on the ugly plaid pants of a Notre Dame graduate, I think back to the four seasons I have experi­enced. 
Standing in the rain for three con­secutive games freshman year. And watching the Irish drop games to Miami, Air Force and South Carolina. 
Later that same year the gloom would change to cheer as Notre Dame walloped Penn State 44-7. And the stam­pede onto the field at the gun to tear down the north goal post. The other goal post was saved from a similar fate by literally an army of law enforcement officials. 
Sophomore year saw Tim Brown return a kick-off for a touchdown against Michigan State (something we would see more of in the future), but the season ended on a sour note as LSU pulled out a last minute victory in Gerry Faust's last game. 
Then came Lou Holtz. 
I will always remember the moment of stunned silence after John Carney missed what would have been the win­ning field goal in a 24-23 loss to Mic­higan. Even though we had lost that day, Notre Dame was telling the college football world the Irish were back and have to be reckoned with. 
Junior year also brought another Brown kick return for a score (against Air Force) and a pasting of SMU. And then there was another down-to-the­wire game at the end the season. But Penn State escaped with their lives and we could take pride in knowing Notre Dame had fought the eventual national champions all the way. 
And, weB, this year has provided a wealth of memories. Tim Brown re­turning two punts for scores in the space of two minutes. Tony Rice rolling down the field. Michigan State's little "mistake" at the start of the game. The Irish defense shutting down Lorenzo White. The Irish ramming the ball down USC's throat for a 26-15 victory. Kent Graham's touchdown pass to Brown on the final play of the first half against Navy. Mark Green's 152-yard rushing effort in the comeback against Boston college. The team saluting the fans at the end of each game with upraised helments. 
Hopefully, there will be one more win against Alabama and the memories to go with that win. 

But there are memories other than those on the football field that I will remember. 
Sitting with my friends and experi­encing together the ups and downs of four years of Notre Dame football. Thanks for those memories. 
The guys from Moreau Seminary who sit up in the top rows of the stadium and their riotous cheers. (For example: Rip off their face and scare 'em with it). 
The great band shows over the four years and the spirit of the band. I will miss the playing of "Notre Dame, Our Mother" at the end of each game. 
The tailgaters and the atmosphere of the pre-game activities have also been a highlight of my four years. 
My parents will be here for this game (Dad's first one since he was at Notre Dame in the 1950s) and they'll see what I've been experiencing for the past four seasons. 
Saturdays in the fall won't be the same after this.

Years that were Devine 
So far, the roll call of head coaches for the Notre Dame football team has read like a Who's Who of college football: Rockne. Layden. Leahy. Parseg­hian. And after Ara decided that he had had enough, yet another great stepped to the fore -Dan Devine. 
During the years 1964-1974, Ara Parseghian had won enough acclaim in South Bend to warrant his nomination for sainthood, and his decision to retire from coaching came as quite a shock to Irish faith­ful everywhere. Who would resume the duties of the most visible, many times most second-guessed college coach in the country? 
Once again, legend followed legend on the Irish sidelines. Dan Devine, already an accomplished college head coach at Arizona State and Missouri 020-40-8 over 16 seasons), and head coach of the NFL's Green Bay Packers from 1971-1974, took the job with quite a bit of momentum in his favor. Par­seghian's Irish had won two straight post-season bowl games, and Devine was the recipient of the ninth ranking in the opening AP poll of 1975 without coaching a down. 
His squad finished a respectable 8-3 in 1975 and the following year, with the same record, Devine took the Irish to Number 15 in AP and the Gator Bowl against 20th-ranked Penn State. Not exactly the Granddaddy of them All, but Notre Dame prevailed, 20-9, behind the 102-yard, two-touchdown performance of tailback Al Hunter. The victory propelled the Irish to 12th in the final AP poll and planted hopes for even better things to come the following year. 
Those hopes sprouted into bona fide celebration in 1977. After surviving the initial test of the season by downing seventh-ranked Pittsburgh 19-9 on

opening day, Notre Dame was stunned by the Rebels of Ole Miss, 20-13, in Jackson. That loss, the only one ever dealt to the Irish by Mississippi, toppled Notre Dame to nth in the nation, and only the diehards held out for a national championship. 
But the Irish rebounded, capturing their final nine regular season games in convincing fashion, includ­ing a 49-19 burial of fifth-ranked USC. Notre Dame took over that spot at the end of the year and was assigned to play the number-one Texas Longhorns at the Cotton Bowl in Dallas for the national cham­pionship.

Golic, the Irish routed Texas, 38-10. Notre Dame converted five of the Longhorns' six turnovers into scores, three of them touchdowns by running back Vagas Ferguson, to spoil Fred Akers' first year with Texas and bring yet another national champi­onship, the 16th and latest, to South Bend.

Devine 
continued from page 1 
Bowl-record low 20 degrees and Notre Dame was just as cold in the early going on New Year's Day. After bolting out to a 12-0 lead, the Irish were completely stymied by the Houston defense until midway through the fourth quarter. The Cougars scored 34 unanswered points to lead 34-12, and the Irish looked like they would end their Cotton Bowl winning str~ak at one. 
But then the miracle began. To start was has been called by many the greatest comeback in Notre Dame history, freshman reserve running back Tony Bel­den blocked a punt and Steve Cichy ran it in 33 yards for a touchdown. Devine, looking ahead, went for two on the con­version and got it on a pass from Joe Montana to Vagas Ferguson. Three minutes later, after forcing another punt, Notre Dame scored again when Joe Montana swept left end for two yards and a touchdown. Never one to go for the tie, Devine again went for two, and again it paid off when Montana threw to Kris Haines to narrow the score to 34-28. 
The Irish were rolling. They forced another punt and took over deep in their own territory with just over two minutes left. But then, after picking up 16 yards on a scramble, Montana fumbled and the ball was recovered by Houston. It looked like the Cougars would be able to run out the clock, but Houston ended up facing fourth and one from their own 29 with 35 seconds left. Figuring that they could get one yard and not wanting to risk a big punt return, Houston went for it and the Irish defense held, turning the ball over to Montana and the offense with 28 seconds left. 
Montana threw to Haines for a gain of 10 and then scrambled for 11 more. With seven seconds left, Montana, who had already thrown four intercep­tions, threw behind Haines in the corner of the endzone. Two seconds remained, enough for one more play. Montana ran the exact same play and hit Haines for the game-tying eight-yard score. Joe Unis kicked the extra point to give Nofre Dame the hard-earned win. 
Devine's Irish went 7-4 in 1979 in an up-and-down year. Notre Dame knocked off sixth-ranked Michigan in Ann Arbor to open the season, lost by six at 17th­ranked Purdue, destroyed number-seven Michigan State, 27-3, at home, lost by 19 at fourth-ranked USC, won two more home games, and then got obliterated by unranked Tennessee, 40-18, in front of 86,500 in Neyland Stadium. Notre Dame finished the season unranked. 
Devine announced that he would retire at the end of the 1980 season and he made his last year one of his best as the Irish compiled a 9-1-1 record and Top Ten status throughout the season. But once again, USC rained on Notre Dame's parade when the 17th-ranked Trojans upset the Irish, then number two, 20-3, in Los An­geles. The Irish couldn't recover in the Sugar Bowl, where they met top-ranked Georgia. Although Notre Dame outgained the Bulldogs 328-127, they fell, 17-10. 
Devine finished his Notre Dame coaching stint with a 53­16-1 mark (.764), and a place in hallowed hall of great Notre Dame coaches.

The Game 
---------------------·-·--~-.------·---------.-.-.:..-·--'--~ ....... __.._...'-"-......._ ....._,_ -"·"--""""'""-·········"' 
By RICK RIETBROCK 
Assistant Sports Editor 
With the end of Notre Dame's home 
schedule comes the onset of the big 
three, the part of the season that every­
one has been looking forward to, yet 
still having nightmares about. 
The first of the dangerous trio, Ala­
bama (11th AP, lOth UPIJ, comes into 
Notre Dame Stadium Saturday (2:45 
EST> in full stride. The Crimson Tide 
has notched victories at Penn State and 
against Tennessee. Last week, the Tide 
added the most impressive win to the 
list by thumping LSU 22-10. That win 
left Irish head coach Lou Holtz very 
impressed. 
"I think Alabama right now is playing like one of the top five teams in the country," he said. "They really have momentum going and they're playing very well." 
These two teams have met only five times, but those few games have in­cluded games legends are made of, in­cluding two Notre Dame wins over top­ranked Alabama squads in the '73 Sugar Bowl and the '75 Orange Bowl. 
But last year's meeting was not a classic. Alabama's Greg Richardson returned a punt 66 yards for a touch­down and Albert Bell took in a Mike Shula pass and raced in for a 52-yard touchdown to spark a 28-10 Tide victory. The Irish were dominated in that game more than at any other time last season. 
New Alabama head coach Bill Curry, who replaced Ray Perkins, has his team fighting for the Southeastern Con­ference's Sugar Bowl bid and fighting to do the almost unheard of, overlook Notre Dame. 
"It's probably the first time in history that has been a concern, but it's a pos­sibility," said Curry. "This game is a great challenge coming on the heels of several challenges for our team." 
And for the Irish, it's just the begin­ning of the season's greates challenge. 
Notre Dame's offense vs. Alabama's defense 
The Notre Dame offensive attack has been less-than-imaginative, but no less than spectacular. The Irish rushing game has totaled 2,125 yards this season, already more than last year's mark of 2,083, and has averaged over 353 yards in the last four games. With that surge, the Irish now rank 11th in the nation in rushing offense. 
Leading the way is Mark Green. The junior tailback continues to assert him­self as a potent rusher. He has two con­secutive 100-yard games coming into the game, and his 629 yards for the season has already surpassed his team­leading total for last season. 
Last week, the Holtz called on his big offensive line to erase Boston College's 17-6 lead, and they responded. Holtz isn't so sure that his horses can pull off the same trick against Alabama. 
"There's just no way in the world we're going to control the football against Alabama," Holtz said. "We're going to have a lot of no-gain plays. That's just the nature of the way they play." 
Despite Holtz' apparent worries, ex­pect the well-stocked crew of Irish rus­hers, fullbacks Anthony Johnson (262 yards) and Braxston Banks (169 yards) along with halfbacks Ricky Watters (261 yards) and Tony Brooks (206 yards), to have plenty of chances to prove Holtz wrong. 
The man in charge of keeping the Irish from running wild is inside linebackers coach Don Lindsey, who served as defensive coordinator under Holtz at Arkansas for three years. 
"I think he's a genius," Holtz said. "One thing he's always going to do is he's going to have four or five things that you aren't ready for and he plays it a little different than everybody, and he's going to take your four or five best plays and he's going to stuff 'em." 
Alabama also strips 'em and steals _ 'em. The Tide defense has caused 33 turnovers, which also makes Holtz wary of turning to the pass. 
"I know we're going to have to throw the football and yet I don't think we can throw it on Alabama," Holtz said. "We're averaging one interception every nine throws, and you just can't do that." 
The most dangerous man on the 'Barna defense is outside linebacker Derrick Thomas. The 6-4, 222-pound junior has registered 14 sacks, has caused seven fumbles and also has 50 tackles. Sophomore nose tackle Willie Wyatt, 6-1, 255 pounds, leads the defense with 80 tackles. 
The secondary has been a ball­hawking unit. Cornerback John Mag­num has four interceptions and con­verted tailback Gene Jelks has three. 
The punting game matches Tim Brown, who averages 12.9 yards per return, against the Alabama coverage team that has allowed an average of just 4.6 yards per game. 

Alabama's offense vs. Notre Dame's defense 

Lost in the Brown Heisman Trophy shuffle is Alabama's offensive weapon, tailback Bobby Humphrey. The junior is the team leader in rushing yards (1,078), receptions (18 for 159 yards), kickoff returns (nine for 25.3 avg.) and scoring (78 points). Perhaps the most important part of the Tide offense is quarterback Jeff Dunn. The redshirt freshman, who has started since since the Tide's 41-22 win over Tennessee, has hit on 29 of 60 passes for 429 yards. He is under the guidance of Rip Scherer, who played quarterback under Holtz at William & Mary. But Curry and Holtz agree Dunn's on-field presence and leadership are his main attributes. 
"Dunn is such a leader," Holtz said. "You can just tell he has command when he walks on the field." 
"He's a gritty guy, who doesn't look pretty, but he'll do the job for you," said Curry. "He brings toughness and leadership to the position. He makes up in grit what he lacks in polish." 
A big problem for Alabama may be the injury to senior guard Bill Condon, who was on crutches with a leg injury until Tuesday. If he is unable to start, 6-4, 290-pound John Fruhmorgen will move inside from his backup right tackle slot. 
On the Irish defensive front, injuries again have made their presence felt. Marty Lippincott will be out for at least two weeks with a knee injury after just recently moving to the defensive line and Bryan Flannery may also be out for two weeks, continuing the revolving door at defensive tackle. 
On the promising side, Corny Southall is listed as "questionable" for the game. Southall was injured at Pit­tsburgh game and could possibly see action for the first time since then. 
The defense held Boston College to 94 yards rushing, the fourth time an Irish opponent has been held under 100 yards rushing this season. 
Inside linebacker Ned Bolcar con­tinues to lead the Irish with 81 tackles. 
While Holtz expressed concern over the lack of dominance his defense has displayed recently, he said he liked its performance in clutch situations. 
"Our defense has not been dominat­ing people so we can't afford to turn the ball over," Holtz said. "But I have been pleased with our performance when we have. We got the ball right back on a crucial drive against USC and also caused a fumble right after an interception against Boston College."

Raider signal-callers not doing job in LA 
Associated Press 

LOS ANGELES-A ghost emerges yearly from a Los An­geles Coliseum dungeon to tor­ment the local pro football quarterbacks, coaches and fans. 
A spell is cast in which nobody wins the big one and a talented passer leaves town. 
The past is filled with names that revive memories of battles for jobs and choices that were made. Among them: Waterfield-Van Brock lin; Gabriel-Munson; Harris-Jaworski; Harris-Haden, Haden-N amath-Ferragamo. 
This year, it's Wilson-Hilger­Evans-Plunkett, the four quar­terbacks of the Los Angeles Raiders. 
For decades, the Los Angeles Rams, followed into the Coliseum by the Raiders in 1982, have been consistent win­ners who could not win the big ones. Coaches and fans debated the perennial question: which of our talented quarterback can win it all for us? 
Inevitably, the loser left for Philadelphia, where Norm Van Brocklin won an NFL title and both Roman Gabriel and Ron Jaworski had extended careers, throwing lots of touch­down passes for losing teams. 
When the Raiders inherited the Coliseum and the ghost, the script didn't adapt well to a team with just one superb quar­terback, Jim Plunkett, who led them to Super Bowl triumphs in 1981 for Oakland and 1984 for Los Angeles. 
But Plunkett's age and injur­ies and the arrival of Marc Wil­son revived kind of "almost" seasons that were the Rams' specialty for 30 years.

Beefcake was formerly a member of the original Dream Team (along with Valentine). The Beefcake-Valentine com­bination held the WWF tag­team titles until WrestleMania II, when they were defeated by the British Bulldogs. 
Since that time, the Dream Team slowly declined. Beef­cake maintains that Valentine and Johnny V were cramping his style.

"We were the champs for al­most a year and we scheduled more title defenses than any team in history," said 'The Barber' Tuesday from a pay phone in a Fort Lauderdale shopping mall. "Then the egos started taking over and jealousy really took over. I started getting more and more popular and Valentine and Johnny V just couldn't handle it.

"Bravo's a jerk -lots of muscle and no brain. He's got a bad attitude. I don't like the way he treats kids. I like to do a lot of work with handicapped kids and visit a lot of hospitals. He has no heart for kids." 
Since his break from Valen­tine, Beefcake, now in his 11th year of professional wrestling, adopted the nickname 'The Barber.' That is also a result of WrestleMania III. 
''After Roddy Piper beat Adrian Adonis, I went in to clip his hair because he had taken a chunk out of mine a few weeks earlier," said Beefcake. "Then I did it again in a match in April and the crowd went crazy. I made it a practice to end with a sleeper and then cut my victim's hair, give him a little extra color on the side (with spray paint) and even a nice style job.

Three WWF titles are also on the line Sunday. The Honkey Tonk Man will defend his Inter­continental belt against Randy 'Macho Man' Savage, the World Tag-Team Champions Strike Force will face The Islanders in a cage match and The Sensational Sherry will defend her Ladies' title against Debbie Combs. 
Other matches include the One Man Gang against the Junkyard Dog and Sam Hous­ton against Cowboy Bob Orton.

The Notre Dame men's and women's swim teams will test their strength in the first home meet of the season against a strong Alabama team today at 4 p.m. in the Rolfs Aquatic Cen­ter. 
Competing against Alabama for the first time in intercol­legiate swimming, the men take their 32-member team up against last year's 16th-ranked Crimson Tide. Meanwhile, the inexperienced women's team will begin its season versus a young, but strong Alabama wo­men's team. 
Alabama head coach Don Gambril, head coach of the 1984 United States swim team and four-time assistant coach, and his team will give the Irish a run for their money. One of the powerhouses on the Notre Dame schedule, Alabama should prove to be a learning experience for the team. 
"What we're looking at here is an awesome Alabama team," says Irish head coach Tim Welsh. "The men's team has been ranked in the top 10 in the NCAA ten times since 1974 and the women's team has been ranked five of the past six seasons. This is a quality team coming up here, and we'll have to make sure we meet that high caliber. This meet will prepare us for a field of excellent swim­ming teams at the National Catholic, and give us an idea of where we need to consolidate our efforts and improve." 
Although the challenge will be an obstacle for the Irish, the meet with Alabama will mea­sure the talent, strength and durability of the squad. Win or lose, the team will have had the chance to compete against one of the best. "This meet is not going to be measured by which team wins, but by the amount of energy and excitement that comes out of it," says Welsh. "This meet exists because Al­abama wants to be part of the Notre Dame experience, it is not the only objective to deter­mine the faster team. It is im­portant that Notre Dame is well-prepared and disciplined for the meet, and we have the advantage of racing against the clock and not only the op­ponent."

Notre Dame not looking past anyone this weekend 
Stanford, Dillon live up to billing 
By TIM SULLIVAN Sports Writer 
Entering the playoffs, they had to be considered the favorites. 
Three weeks and two rounds later, Stanford and Dillon are prepared to do battle on the grass of Notre Dame Stadium in the final of the men's Inter­hall football playoffs. 
The game will take place Sunday at 2:30 p.m., immedi­ately following the-women's final. 
Dillon will enter the game in an unfamiliar position -that of the underdog. Despite Dillqn's losing only one game (in seven efforts) and outscoring oppo­nents 77-21, Stanford has bet­tered Dillon on all counts. The Studs are sporting an un­blemished 5-0 record, and have scored 128 (yes, 128) points, while allowing just 13. 
When watching Stanford play, one characteristic stands out: a highly-advanced of­fense. The Studs usually begin games by simply pounding the ball at the defense behind a talented offensive line. Halfback Dan Diebel has keyed the running attack throughout the season. In last week's 26-7 dismantling of Fisher, Diebel ran for three touchdowns.

But who could blame them if they did? 
The Irish will play host Mar­quette in the first half of a vol­leyball doubleheader this after­noon, followed by a visit by Valparaiso that evening. On Saturday, Michigan State comes to the Joyce ACC Pit. 
The Warriors, Crusaders and Spartans have a combined record of 14-58.

BP, Farley meet again for the title 
By JEFF HEILERT Sports Writer 
You play to have fun, but it's a lot more fun to win. 
Talk to any Farley or Breen­Phillips resident and you'll probably hear something like that. 
When the two dorms meet in the women's Interhall football final Sunday afternoon at 1 in Notre Dame Stadium, a lot will be on the line. 
Playing in the finals is noth­ing new to these teams. Last year they met, with Farley win­ning its third-consectutive title, 18-8. BP, however, partially avenged that loss with an ex­citing 24-22 victory during the regular season. 
This time around a lot more is at stake. Farley has the op­portunity to win a unpreci­dented fourth-consecutive title. BP hopes to start a title string of its own. 
The keys to the game? 
"Last time they defensed our option extremely well," said Farley coach Tom Doran, "but the pass worked well. This time around, I think they (BP) may be concentrating more on our j passing game. We have been working hard on our option at­tack to counter. 
"Defensively, we know what they are going to run this time.

Mideast Regional Poll, are con­centrating on the task at hand. 
"It is extremely important that we play well this weekend," said Head Coach Art Lambert, "particularly be­cause of Tuesday." 
(Tuesday is when the Irish travel to Western Michigan. But other things come first.) 
The Irish hold a 3-0 advan­tage in series play with Mar­quette (currently 4-17), with the Irish sweeping the War­riors, 15-8, 15-2, 15-2, last season. A win would keep the Irish record unblemished against North Star Conference opponents. 
Against Valparaiso (7-21), Notre Dame is 7-2 over the years, including seven straight victories dating back to 1981. 
The Irish also swept the Crusaders last season, 15-9, 15­2, 15-2, but did allow them one more point than they allowed Marquette. 
"We don't know much about Marquette and Valparaiso," said Lambert. "They have not been doing well." 
More of a challenge to Lam­bert's team will be Michigan State. 
"The Big Ten factor lives with us," said Lambert. "We're right in the middle of them. We have to play them and do well against them." 
The Irish are 4-3 against the Big Ten this year, and the Spar­tans are not among the elite of the conference, currently pos­ting a record of 3-20. -"Michigan State has got some good people,'' said Lam-this weekena·s acuon. 1\ wm un bert.

Although Lambert says the "Our tourney hopes are not Irish will have no endurance as bright as they once were," troubles with playing two said Lambert. "But lots of matches on Friday, he does things can happen. The season have some concern about his is not over. team's level of play. "There is too much emphasis
