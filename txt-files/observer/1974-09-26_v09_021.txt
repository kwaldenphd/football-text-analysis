Julian Bond calls for new responsiveness to needs 
by Marlene Zloza Manae:ing Editor 
Attacking current federal government operations and policies, Georgia legislator Julian Bond last night called for a "national coalition of need" to help influence elections and make government responsive to contemporary needs. 
Speaking on "current events" to an overflow crowd in the Library Auditorium, the 34-year-old politician expressed concern that "many people don't keep in touch" with their surroundings. 
"Things are moving so fast that you must be 
careful that they don't sweep you away," 
warned Bond. We recently had "a president that 
impeached himself and was exposed as a cheat, 
liar and petty thief," he continued. "And now he 
has been pardoned and is not in jail as are others 
who were not born rich or politically powerful." 
Bond then referred to Lyndon Johnson's past 
characterization of our current president as "a 
man who can't walk and chew gun at the same 
time" and added that "he has apparently started 
chewing gum again." 
In beginning his lecture, Bond gave a short 
"mock speech" in which he called himself a 
"politician by profession" and discussed the 
profession as it stands now. "I belo?,g to ~e 
finest body of men that money can buy, he said. 
Bond then noted the "spectacular amount of 
corruption" in government today and gave some 
of the reasons for it. "One reason is the innate 
venality of some people and another is the low 
level of pay that people in politics receive," he 
detailed. "This makes politicians susceptible to 
bribes and paybacks that they may be offered." 
Moving into a broader perspective on current 
events, Bond noted that while great changes are 
taking place in other parts of the globe 
Americans see themselves existing in a vacuum. 
"Only here is there. indifference . and 
disorganization, only hert; IS there uncertamty 
and indecision," Bond said. 
Throughout his address, Bond referred to his 
extensive notes for a variety of stylized phrases 
and memorable quotations. . 
Returning to his attack on the present national 
leadership, Bond claimed that "the reins of 
government have been seized by a group of the 
comfortable, callous and smug" who have 
"closed their hearts, closed their minds, and 
closed their ranks" to the forgotten elements. 
This in turn has caused the "national 
nullification of the needs of the needy," ac­
cording to the Southern Democrat. 
Bond characterized the "coalition of need" as 
those "people who work for a living but can't live 
on what they make and those who can't find work 
and can't live on what we so grudgingly give 
them. 
He further stated that this coalition should 
work to turn this year's Congressional elections 
toward a committment to a more representative 
government. Bond classified the present 
national representatives as "people from an 
earlier ear" whose concerns were rural and 
farm-oriented rather than urban. 
Bond blamed the last two national elections for giving the electoral power to a group that "reinstated the fiscal fascists" and "insured a

consistent arrogant contempt for people and their problems." Coupled with an "impotent Congress" this has cut most of the pople at the bottom of the class structure charged Bond. 
Commenting on the present shift from the Kennedy and Johnson administrations' slow­moving advances, Bond accused the government of changing from one of ''benign concern to malignant neglect." 
"Although New Frontier and Great Society programs recuced by one-third the number of people at the poverty level, Bond explained, "they still managed to kill, freeze, or wind down" a variety of social programs such as urban renewal education, and student loans. "This amounted to a 60 percent national pullback of social concerns," said Bond. 
"Share the wealth plans only consolidated it away from the cities, the poor and the young and into established wealth," he charged. 
Moving into the seventies, Bond accused the country of "thinking the black problem had burned out or blown away," while the average black was still dying seven years earlier than the average white and "the blacks were still the last to be hired, and the first to be fired." 
"Many people thought the New Federalism was the promise of manna but it turned into only a few pennies," stated Bond. This shifted the burden from the federal level, where the resources were, to the state and local level, where the resources weren't." 
Comparing the current period to the Recon­struction Era, Bond called the parallels "more fthan frightening." 
He noted that both then and now, a "president desperate for power entered into an illicit relationship," believing private gain could be masked by public concern. 
Also in both periods liberal crusaders for democracy became tired and politics became misdirected by the "mightly manipulators of the American mind," Bond noted. 
Of the present situtaion Bond stressed that "too many of us tired and turned from the social committments, and social concern began to be measured by the length of hair or complexity of handshake." 
In the same vein, Bond noted the change from student activism and protest demonstrations to the streaking fad. 
Many people have taken the attitude that "if they can't be part of a massive crusade to save the world, they won't be part of any movement," Bond charged. 
Turning to the area of political support and endorsement, Bond warned the audience not to vote for a candidate that may have a favorable stand on one issue but be on the wrong side of another one. "There has to be a confluence of forces now," he said. "If a candidate is on the right side of the pollution problem but wrong on people, he should be corrected to be right on people" 
Bond concluded his speech by addressing those 
who think "the problems of the world can be 
magically solved." He strongly stressed that the 
importance of "taking the first step yourself" 
and getting involved rather than sitting still and 
waiting for others to take the initiative.

Ombudsman Director Bill Mclean has announced the trial basis for the new off-campus shuttle. 
OC shuttle begins 
The "Quickie" a weekend off-campus shut tle bus service to the South Bend and Roseland-Niles areas, will begin this Friday on a trial basis. 
The service initiated by the Social Commission and Om­budsman Servi~es under the approval of Vice President of Student Mfairs , Bro. Just Pacze sny will run on a tentative time schedule to be released Thursday night to the students. 
Under this schedule, buses will leave every Friday from the Circle beginning at 8:30p.m. continuing until the last bus departs at 
1:30 a.m. Saturday. . 
The "Quickie" will operate on a two route or loop basis. The northern loop will provide transportation along Route 31 to areas including Boar's Head, Denny's, Village Inn, McDonald's, Jay's, Lounge, Shula's, and Kubiak's. 
The southern loop takes in areas such as the Notre Dame Apartments, Rocco's, River Bend Plaza, Scottsdale Mall, the downtown theartres, Eddie's, Wooden Keg, and the Town and Countyrvry Shopping Center. 
A bus ride will cost the individual an initial $.25 upon payment of which his hand will be stamped. Any additional use of the service will cost the marked passenger a only $.10 more per ride. 
Security will be undertaken by a two man team of "stewards" who will occupy eve~y bus in operation. ~heri _roles incl~de collecting fares makmg change , and deahng with any xsick passengers, tro~blemakers or those w~o attempt to _bring alcohol on the bus. The latter will not be permitted to remam on the bus. The stewards will also answer questions concerning the route of the vehicle. 
In providing this shuttle service, the Social Commission and Ombudsman Service stressed in itheir joint policy statement that they are "rE-lying on the maturity and responsibility of the Notre Dame body in regards to the bus servicing Michi~an .bars." .. 
The statement ·points out that both orgamzabons beleuecve that alcohol plays a significant role in the social activities of the students. The shuttle provides access to an area where such ac­tivities involving alcohol may legally be conducted. 
The ·service was also cited to be a 1minimizer of automobile accidents that might occur from increased traffic to Michigan in view of the recent Indiana ruling. 
The northern loop of the shuttle will be serviced by one 41 pas;.;enger bus, -· and a complete cir~uit will. average 40 minutes. It will operate from 8:30 p.m. Friday until 2:30 a.m.

Goldrick cmd Jones express views 
ND women discussed 
by Fred Herbst 
Staff Reporter The admittance of female students to the University is a very complex process and the future of coeducation at Notre Dame is still undecided, according to Director of Admissions John Goldrick and Assistant Provost Sr. John Miriam Jones. Goldrick described the method by which the number of women accepted in a particular class as very complex. A final decision on the numbers is made by the University Provost along with the University President after receiving the recommendations from. an ex­tremely diverse faculty committee under the chairmanship of Fr. Ferdinand Brown, associate provost, Goldrick explained. Numerous factors enter into the decision including the availability of housing for women students. Yet Goldrick stated that "probably the major consideration is the applicant pool." A determination of the number of women in next fall's freshman class has not yet been made. While being unable to predict an increase of women for next year, the Director of Admissinos remarked

O.C shuttle 
Saturday. 
The southern loop will be ser­viced by two 45 passenger buses with a round trip averaging 60 minutes. 
One bus will start operations 
from the Circle at 8:30 p.m. and 
loop to and from downtown until 
1:30 a.m. The second bus will start from Town and Country at 9 p.m. and continue the reverse loop until 2 a.m. 
The shuttle is a non-profit service run at a const of ap­proximately $350.00 a week with an income expected at 1$150.00 weekly. The deficit will hopefully be counteracted by the financial backing of Student Government and-or Student Union. 
The policy statement was issued by Bill McLean, director of Om­budsman Services, Bill Bracken, deputy director, Rich Guiltinan, Social Commissioner and Mary Siegal, assistant Social Com­missioner after receiving the approval of Paczesny.

Sr. John Miriam stated that there are presently 375 women in the freshman class, and she an­
ticipates a slight  increase  next

There  currently 1100 women  

at the University. The Assistant Provost projected a figure of 1300 women students next year and the realization of the University's goal of 1500 women students by the fall of 1976. 
Stating that the ratio of men to women is 3 to 2 in colleges across the country, Jones said that when the goal of 1500 women student s is reached, the University will "re­evaluate" coeducation and decide where to go from there. 
Revealing that there is housing for less than a thousand women, she stated that women will "eventually take part in a lottery" to determine who gets campus housing. The lottery will be the same as that which men took partin this past year. 
"Ultimately, there will be a proportional amount of housing for men and women" according to the Assistant Provost.

The last two panty raids have claimed over $1,200 damage each, as well as several incidents ht­hcases of injury. 
The three Student Affairs ad­ministrators arrived at the en­trance of the St. Mary's campus at about 12:15 a.m. Their request for students to doisperse centered on previous complaints by SMC students and officials. 
Despite these housing problems, Jones stressed that the Farley· Motel will remain open to guests and will not be converted into dormitory space. 
Speaking of the still young coeducational experience at Notre Dame, Jones said that she feels things have gone "very well," with many "things yet to be done." 
The Assistant Provost pointed out several problems facedby coeducation, such as fighting a 130 year old tradition. Yet perhaps the largest single problem is that approximately 50 per cent of all incoming students attended either all-male or all-female high schools. 
"So it is at Notre Dame," Sr. John Miriam said, "that these students get their first adult exposure to one another." 
Jones is optimistic about coeducation at Notre Dame and views it as a necessity because the University is "dedicated to the toal development of the individual."

POLICY STATEMENT-SOCIAL COMMISSION AND OMBUDSMAN SERVICE 
THE NEW SHUTTLE SERVICE 
TThe Social Commission in conjunction with the Ombudsman Service will institute, beginning Friday, September 27, 1974, a weekend shuttle bus service to both the South Bend and Roseland­Niles areas. 
Route number 1 of the shuttle will provide transportation to the areas including the Notre Dame Apartments, Rocc's, River Bend Plaza, Scottsdale Mall, and the Town and Country Shopping Center. Route number 2 of the shuttle will provide transportation north from campus along Rt. 31, to areas including Denny's, McDonald's, Jay's Lounge, Shula's, and Kubiak's. 
This shuttle is being initiated as a service to both campus and off­campus students. The advantages of the shuttle ·are many. For no more than $.25, students will be accorded transportation to the leading centers of social activity in the South Bend area. Movie theaters, bars, shopping centers, off-campus student neigh­borhoods, and restaurants will now be available. The busses will leave from the Circle beginning at 8:30p.m. Friday and will con­tinue until the final bus pulls into the Circle at 1:30 a.m. Saturday. 
Both the Social Commission and the Ombudsman Service would like to emphasize that they are relying on the maturity and responsibility of the Notre Dame student body in regards to the bus serving Michigan bars. Providing such a service is an alternative to the present alcohol rules on campus dictated by Indiana State law. We would like to point out that providing the bus north has two other positive aspects. Following the change in alcohol rules on campus and foreseeing the possiblility of increased travel to Michigan by cars, the shuttle will help minimize possible automobile accidents. Secondly, it is the belief of the Social Commission and Ombudsman Service that alcohol plays a significant role in social activities of young adults. By ex­periencing alcohol during social functions now, students will be better equipped to responsibly handle alcohol in the future. 
It should be noted that students will not be permitted at any time to transport alcohol on the busses, and that any abuse of this newly provided service will result in its termination.

the audience, Bono clarified his position on many national issues and problems.
Concerning the pardon of former President Nixon, Bond stated he was not against the pardon itself, but its timing. He disagreed with a pardon given "before a jury of his peers decides he has done anything wrong."
On the 1976 presidential race, Bond, who is an unofficial can­didate for the Democratic nomination, commented that "there will be candidates aplenty. The Democrate won't have a shortage of candidates, but of winners." He named Senators Jackson and Mondale as top contenders. 
As for his vice-presidential hopes, Bond hedged by saying he would like to be vice-president with some people but not with others. He listed Mondale on the positive side and Wallace and Jackson on

the negative side. 
Discussing the Southern Election Fund, Bond defined it as a group that raises money for local can­didates in the eleven "old South" states. Based in Atlanta, the group has aided about 400 capmaigns in the last four years with small donations. They raise the funds from traidtional liberal con­tributors and "from whoever cares to give." 
Concerning the recent revelation of CIA involvement in Chile, Bond said he had "always assumed these things happen as a matter of fact, but now we have the actual proof that it was done. We have the president saying it himself and those responsible for lying about it shoudl be held accountable." He said the idea that "we do it because they do it and we wouldn't if they didn't" is being used lately as a justification for any illegal act. 


Captain Chester M. Lee, U.S.N., Program Director of the Apollo Soyuz Test Project will discuss the American-Russian Joint Space Program tonight at 
8:00 in the Engineering Building Seminar Room 303. His lecture will include movies and slides of the Program_ 
Lee's appearance is sponsored by the Notre Dame Student Section of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics and the St. Joseph Valley Section. 
As Director of the Test Project Lee has overall responsibility for the direction and management of the United States portion bf the US­USSR joint manned space flight missions. This task includes spacecraft and docking module activities, flight operations and crew operations at the NASA Manned Spacecraft Center in Houston, launch vehicle activities at the NASA Center in Huntsville, Alabama, and launch operations at the JFK Center in Florida. 
Prior to this appointment, Lee was Apollo Mission Director. Lee received a BS degree in Electrical Engineering at the U.S. Naval Academy in 1941. He was awarded the NASA Exceptional Service Medal for both the Apollo 8 and Apollo 11 Missions. 
Admission is free, and the public is cordially invited to attend. 
Frost reports helped move soybean futures sharply higher in the last three days of trading on the Chicago Board of Trade. Corn futures prices also clim­bed, but less dramatically. 
Farmers from the Dakotas to Ohio were trying to estimate how severely their 1974 incomes had been crimped by freezing temperatures that whitened late-maturing -grain, beans and 
vegetables summer  on and  the first  last day day  of of  
autumn.  

Agricultural sources general­ly agreed it was much too early to say what impact the cropdamage would have on already rising food prices, but some increases were expected. 
Canning company officials in Minnesota said prices of sweet corn and green beans were likely to rise about 5 per cent because of this growing sea­son's combination of bad weather conditions.

The deans of the law school will address an estimated 27 directors on the state of the school. Following a discussion, the first session will be concluded with a talk by Professor Howard Glickstein, director of the Center 

· on Civil Rights. The second of the three sessions will include a report of the Law Association's placement com­mittee followed by a business meeting conducted by the Association President Hugh H. Fitzgerald. A directors luncheon will follow with an address by Fr. Edmond P. Joyce, executive Vice-president of Notre Dame. The third session will be com­prised of nports from the Law Associations Policy Committee, Scholarship Committee and a report on student recruiting. According to LawSchool Dean David Link, the alumni that form the 4000 member Law Association play an essential role in four im­portant areas: recruiting good law students; helping graduates find good law positions; fund raising 
A spokesman for the Agricul­ture Department's Economic Research Service said radio and television reports that 20 per cent of the corn and soybean crops might be lost were not realistic. 
"We have not yet been able to get a firm estimate, or even a good guesstimate, of the extent of damage, but we don't think it will be even as high as 10 per cent," he said. 
John W. Kirkbride, director of the estimates division of the USDA Statistical Reporting Service, said "until we get a pretty good reading from the farmers ... I'm in no position to say whether it was a little damage or 20 per cent." 
The next government crop report, due Oct. 10, will be based on a survey which will be made by Oct. 1.

which makes up the backbone of the scholarship program; and, finally public relations to spread the word about the excellence of the Notre Dame Law School. 
Link said, "The reason we have one of the best law schools in the country is the working support from alumni. We find that their advice is most helpful in running our law school." 
The Notre Dame Law School Board of Director£ activities were organized by their executive secretary Milli Kristowski and the Notre Dame Student Bar Association. Link pointed out the directors are voluntarily giving of their time to help run this place." 
A social gathering sponsored by the Student Bar Association on Friday night will provide an op­portunity for greater com­munication between practicing lawyers and law students. Link hoped that this would give the directors a chance to discover student feelings and give students a chance to rub elbows with those in practice.

Will there be an off-campus shuttle bus going through the South Bend area and Mich. this Friday? 
We checked into it and so far we have determined that efforts are 
 underway for such a project and there is a good chance that it will be off the ground by Friday. There should be further information about this project in The Observer as it develops, however if it is in progress on Friday there will be a special note on the bottom of my column on Friday. 
How does one go about becoming a CAP? 
First one must be nominated by an instructor or oneself. These nominations are due on Monday, September 30. Once this is done, one will receive application forms that must be filled out and returned by a specific date. Then it is merely a matter of getting an ingerview with the CAP board. Those eligible for the CAP Program as of this time include 1st semester sophomores and juniors returning from abroad. Next semester, second semester freshmen will be eligible to apply for acceptance in the program, around March and April. For those who are unsure of what CAP stands for, it means Committee on Academic Progress and offers the student an opportunity for advancing his or her education in a very open and flexible manner. It should be noted that htis program is limited to Arts and Letters people.

Dear Editor:

Although the creature belongs to the species of Homo Sapiens <abbreviated SAP), this is a commentary on a subgroup of SAP known as Homo Domers (em­phasis on subgroup, i.e. beneath, lower than.)

pinnacle of society. Well, so what, you say. When I consider that those elements of society which make up 65 percent of white America find only a 20 percent representation on this campus, Imust seriously question this institution's use of the word "university" before its name. Further, I think it pretty sad that the greatest number here on campus come only ffl(>m the middle, upper middle, and upper classes. These 3 groups compose 92 percent of Notre Dame students, while the lower 3 groups (upwards of 65 percent of the American people) are represented by a whopping 8 percent. When lconsider the working class alone, that backbone of the industrial unions, that class that makes this country what it is commercially, and that which is America's largest at 41 percent of  the total society, I am nauseated by the fact that only 2 percent of Notre Dame students are sons or daughters of workers. What was it that that p1 ofessor at a major Catholic university in Chicago was trying to convey to me by his reply of "Oh" in a cynical and sarcastic tone to the fact that I went to Notre Dame? Only this community has the answer. Sincerely, Tom Sheridan  Notre Dame is actually a "university", the comments of Professor Quigley in Tuesday's Observer have compelled me to take exception to my rule. It is, indeed, distressing that the president of the Northeast Neigh­borhood Council, Notre Dame's own professor Arthur Quigley of the <nationally rated!) Enginering Department, has accused some of us <youthful) Domers of using obscenities, making excessive noise and littering lawns on our way to "frequent" local bars. As one of the "frequenters" (a freq '?), let me reply that such incidents of "unneighborly" behavior are highly exagerated by the professor. Arthur Quigley should recognize the inevitability of some friction when the youthful relax socially in areas also occupied by more senior citizens. Professor Quigley should further understand that 5000 Notre Dame students are  deliberately and without cause, kept us stopped at the gate, making us late for our delivery at Dillon Hall food sales by 20 minutes.

Is it the students or their own precious images as strong arm men? What ever happened to those students in Pangborn and Dillon who were tied up and robbed last year? How effective were our Benevolent Protectors then? Get your values straight, J. Arthur and Co.! Bill Whlig Bill Thode

Civil rights remain an important issue for the young congressman. Despite the fact that many rights have been won for the blacks, the problem now is maintaining the rights. "the right to eat at a lunch counter-­that's guaranteed. The fight now is in maintaining it and its enforcement." 
Quite outspoken in his opinion of the current Congress, Bond explained that starting with the Kennedy administration and following through with Johnson, reaching new heights with Nixon, Congress had stopped being a co-partner in the triad of government and instead had become "in the hands of an aggressive president, an impotent group of old men unable to make decisions for themselves-unable to im­plement what few decisions they did make." 
It almost goes without saying that the college student population could be treme~dously important in a presidential campaign.

Juggler expands distribution SIZe 
by Gregg Bangs 
Starr Heporter 
The 1974-75 Juggler expands this year with a sizeable increase in distribution as compared to last year. 
"We want to expand to a broader format and make the Juggler more visible," said Juggler editor Joe O'Brien. "Therefore we'll go with distributing 4,000 free copies this year, instead of selling 500 copies for fifty cents each like last year." 
O'Brien, a senior English major from Troy, New York, said that this will be the first year that the 
Soc and anthro department 
New committee formed 
The Department of Sociologyand Anthropology has announced the formation of a Sociology and Anthropology Undergraduate Planning Committee, as a result of a meeting held last Monday night, Sept. 16. 
The committee consists of Department Chairman Dr. Leo Despres, seven faculty members, and two student representatives­one majoring in sociology and one in anthropology. 
Student representative Robb Caponigri, the sociology mojor, said "Our job is to act as a liaison between faculty members on the committee and the students in our departments. We want to get the students' opinions on how things are being run." 
One purpose of the committee is to review the possibilities of sociology and anthropology as undergraduate majors. "We're looking into the possibility of branching out by dropping some of the elementary level courses and offering more courses on the ac­vanced levels," said Caponigri. "We're also considering revision of the basic degree requirements."

Juggler is the university's journal of the arts. It accepts works in peotry, prose, photography, art, design, musical compostitions and other works related to the arts. 
Anybo.dy affiliated with the University can submit material to the Juggler. "We would like to have a broad spectrum of people contributing to the Juggler"', commented O'Brien. "We promise that we will read everything submitted; we won't 
Another goal of the committee is to re-evaluate the role of sociology and anthropology in the Notre Dame community and their relationships with other academic disciplines. Caponigri stated that "there are great opportunities for co-operative educational programs between the sociology and anthropology departments and other departments in the University." One such example would be a combination program

Caponigri admitted although the demand  that for  

sociologists is not very great, sociology itself provides an ex­cellent backbround for careers in business, government, and law. He also added that the committee may in the future act as a placement service for department graduates. 
Sociology majors having any questions, comments or com­plaints should call Caponigri at 1592. Anthropology majors should contact their representative, Karla Grazier, at 6883.

The Juggler is published once a semester. The deadline for this fall's November fifth distribution date is October fifteenth. O'Brien emphasized that the articles should be turned in by this date because "it takes us three weeks to read over and. lay· outithe,material we I receive."

Fox meets with marketing club 
The Notre Dame Marketing Club will jost Mr. Frank Fox this af­ternoon as he discusses "How to Interview For The Marketing Job." Fox is head of the Marketing Personnel Department at Eli Lilly and Company of Indianapolis, a leading pharmaceutical products. 
A graduate of Notre Dame in 1942, Fox was a former college recruiter and Indiana Region Chairman of the Midwest College Placement Association.

O'Brien expects the November issue to fall between seventy and eighty pages. "Excluding photographs, I'd like to have about fifty to sixty pages," he added. 
O'Brien also expressed pleasure over the current affairs of his staff. 
"I was pleasantly surprised on activity night when a lot of people wanted to join our staff. Right now, I have about fifteen people who help me read over the material, give their op_inion on it and help work on layout," he commented. 
When questioned on how he thought the quality of this year's Juggler might turn out, he replied, "Like any editor, I'd like to see the quality of the magazine go up." O'Brien continued, "Last year, I thought the quality took a dive, but that was due to a certain clique contributing everything and choking off any fresh input of poetry or fiction." 
"However,'' he concluded, "1 think the Juggler is one of the best literary magazines in the countr on a colle iate level."

Buses taking blacks home left without incident and as they pulled out one black policeman said, "Did you ever see a stick of dynamite that was about to go off. That's what it was like in there today." 
In South Boston, where demonstrations and bus ston­ings have occurred on previous days, a white classroom boycott continued to soften somewhat. Attendance at South Boston High School increased slightly Wednesday to 22 per cent of the 1,521 assigned, compared to 20 per cent on Tuesday. 
School Department figures showed that 338 students-154 white, 172 black and 12 others­went to the high school Wednesday. The white total showed an increase of 20 whites over Tuesday. 
A sympathy school boycott continued in Charlestown, a predominantly white section of the city which is not affected by the busing program, but is expected to become involved in 
the  near  future.  
Officials  said  465  of  1,180  
students  went  to  class  at

Ilawing salaries at San Clemente 
Nixon help remains on government payroll 
By MIKE FEINSILBER 
WASHINGTON (UPI) -Gov­ernment officials testified Wednesday that 22 federal employees drawing annual salar­ies of over $42,000 are working for former President Richard 
M. Nixon at San Clemente 
Calif. ' 
The figure came to light in a Senate appropriations subcom­mitee hearing into President Ford's request for $850,000 to support Nixon's post-presiden­tial activities through next June 30. 
The 22 employees assigned to Nixon but still on the federal payroll range from Ronald L. Ziegler, press secretary, draw­ing $42,500 a year plus up to $40 a day in living expenses, to butler Manolo Sanchez, paid $12,000 and his wife, Fina, a maid, paid $8,000.

Blessed with pennies from heaven 



ND avoids penny 
by Catherine Brown Starr Reporter 
The penny shortage that has pinched other parts of the country has apparently largely by-passed the Notre Dame-St. Mary's community. 
A survey of some campus offices and businesses revealed that, although some experienced minor problems with their penny supply over the summer, none have had or expect to have any majorproblems. 
The Cashier's Office had problems all summer getting and keeping pennies, but there has been "less demand since August", notes Cashier Timothy E. Howard. Howard feels that the summer pinch was largely due to the "many outsiders on campus, who aren't exempt from the 4 per cent sale tax, as students are." 
Howard aaaed that the bank has told him that "things are much better," and there is now no limit on the number of pennies he can get. The cashier said he has no intention of asking for larger amounts of pennies, "because we have a good relationship with the bank, and I don't want to put any unnecessary burden on them." 
Meanwhile, the Hammes Bookstore on campus has also been affected by the shortage. "We had a problem a few weeks ago," said a bookstore bookkeeper, who preferred not to be identified. "The bank put us on a budget, so that we could only get a certain butler and a maid at govern­ment expense. 
Roy M. Ash, Director of the Office of Management and Budget, Arthur F. Sampson, administrater of the General Services Administration, and Lilburn E. Boggs, deputy Secret Service director, flanked by 10 aides, sought to justifythe $850,000 request.

A spokesman tor tne ~:it. Mary's College Business Office, which provides the SMC bookstore with its pennies, said that there had been no shortage and no unusual demand for pennies, and added that they had not had their supply limited by the bank.

International cooperation requested 
Ford repeats oil warning 
By RICHARD E. LERNER 
WASHINGTON (UPI) President Ford warned Wednes­day that high oil prices and other inflation problems threat­en the stability of the world's economy and called for the third time in a week for prompt international cooperation. 
Ford made his latest remarks during a red carpet welcome for Italian President Giovanni Leone to the White House for talks on inflation. 
He also arranged a late afternoon meeting with Adam Malik, foreign minister of oil­rich Indonesia. 
Presidential Press Secretary Ron Nessen said Ford and the Indonesian leader arranged to get together to discuss relations between their countries, "the situation in Southeast Asia and other matters of mutual con­cern.". 
"We must all admit that the road will not be easy," the President told Leone and a crowd of hundreds assembled on the South Lawn of the White House after welcoming ceremo­nies. 
"The problems of inflation and of assuring equitable access to fairly priced resour­ces, for example, threaten the stability of every economy and the welfare of people in developed as well as developingcountries." 
Ford's statements on inflation were a followup to his tough speech at a world energy conference Monday in Detroit and an address last Wednesday to the U.N. General Assembly. 
Ford's meetings with Leone and Malik followed a similar session Tuesday with British Foreign Minister James Callag­han and two days of talks late last week with Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei A. Gromyko as well as a lengthy meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Ka­

In addition to 22 employees assigned to Nixon, the GSA employs eight maintenance workers at San Clemente and four at Key Biscayne, Fla. where the government leases two buildings adjoining Nixon's Florida home. 
The salaries of employeesassigned to Nixon and of the maintenance workers are not included in the $850,000 request.

He said he could not understand why four mainte­nance men, paid $53,566 on an annual basis, were necessary to care for 7,480 square feet of space at Key Biscayne or why it was taking so long to close up shop there. 
"We're working with the Secret Service to come up with

10 the observer 

through centuries, themes and media 
a collection of french art 
by janet woltmon 

Now showing in the West Gallery of the Notre Dame Art Gallery is an exhibit of French Art from the University's Permanent Collection. This is an exhibition that is sure to please almost everybody with its wide range of styles, media, and subject matter. 
Nearly half of the works have been acquired by the Gallery in the last ten years. And some of them have not been shown before. The Gallery staff has worked hard to build up the collection so they could mount a comprehensive exhibit of high quality works like these. (Similar projects are un­derway to build up the collections of German, British, and Italian art.) 
Meanwhile, the scope and variety of the French exhibit was a challenge to present in a coherent way. The theme chosen by the gallery staff was subject, and thus there are works grouped by portraits, landscapes, genre, and religious themes. But within each group are oils, watercolors, sculptures, etchings, drawings, and lithographs dating from the 14th to the 20th centuries. 
The selection of portraits includes many of Notre Dame's finest-and most often displayed-paintings, a group of 18th century portraits by Louis Tocque, Jean-Marc Nattier, and Jean-Baptiste Oudry, whose Portrait of Pouan and his Dog is one of the most important works in the collection. The two charming portraits by Nattier, of the Marquise de Croissy and of a Lady of the French Court are displayed flanking a terra-cotta Bust of a Woman by Nattier's contemporary Jean-Baptiste Lemoyne. The grouping of the three works gives the viewer an idea of the Frenchman's concept of the ideal beauty rather than the personalities of the three in­dividual ladies. 
Nattier's son-in-law Louis Tocque painted the partner to the Marquise de Crolssy, the Marquis, in 1749. These two often worked as a team this way since Nattier had a reputation for making the ladies more beautiful and Tocque had a fine hand for men's portraits. All the fashionable couples of the day commiss10ned matching portraits from these two. 
Around the corner from these is the area devoted to land­scape. Here are bold and expressive oils by Maurice Vlaminck, a small Landscape with Rocks by Gustave Courbet, and an etching by Felix Bracquemand, Aile Dans Le Pare St. Cloud en Hlver. From any position before this .etching, Bracquemand's invitation to stroll down the lane of 
trees in St. Cloud Park still readhes out. 
Turn another corner and leave the great outdoors for 19th 
century Paris, as depicted in a group of etchings and 
drawings, highlighted by Felix Buhot's Place Pigalle en 1878. 
One of the Gallery's latest acquisitions, this rare etching is a 
melange of images of the square, its denizons, and Paris 
itself. It is remarkable not only as a splendid etching, but is 
also signed and includes on the lower border a tiny portrait of

the artist. 

Down the west wall of the Gallery are several groupings of works with different subjects. There are two Bathers by Cezanne. Both lithographs, one is colored with yellow, blue, and grey, and the other, smaller one is black-and-white. The groups of nudes in each are different, but the figure on the right in both is in almost the same pose, tying the two works together. 
The works on this wall are genre art, that is they deal with many subjects and depict people from all walks of French life, from Jacques Callot's Two Beggars to Pierre Bannard's La Revue Blanche. There are a watercolor, an oil, and a drawing that share a military theme. There is an Arab by Decamp, a Sherpherdess by Millet, a periodical cartoon by Daumier, and a Dancer by Mattisse. 
Then there are two 18th century drawings now thought to belong to one Jean Daulle, although they were long attributed to Francois Boucher, whose Offering of a Rose, one of the Gallery's most important paintings, is currently hanging in the Masterpiece Gallery. The Love Allegory with Egg Basket and Love Allegory with a Bird Cage are in the popular mode of their day, with charming young rustics engaged in "innocent" games which symbolize much more. 
In the small group of religious paintings there are more authentic Bouchers--three etching of Putti or Cherubs cavorting in the clouds. Displayed next to a series of tiny H~ by 2% inch etchings of the Life of the Holy Virgin is one of the largest canvased in the exhibit, a Resurrection of Christ by Antoine Coypel. This arrangement offers an interesting contrast in style, execution, and detail and color work. 
If none of these two dimensional media 

interest you, perhaps the sculpture which rounds out the exhibit will. The oldest ob­ject in the exhibit is a wooden Madonna from the Isle de France. Thirty-eight inches high, it still retains much of its original 14th century polychrome. 

A late addition to the show is a Burgun­dian Madonna and Child made of stone. In almost original condition, except for the loss of most of its polychrome, it is eighteen inches high. It was made about 1430 and 
has beautiful lines in the flow of the Mother's gown and hair as she nurses her natural looking Child. 
From the 19th Century there are several small bronzes, including Antoine-Louis Barye's Walking Lion and Lioness and Auguste Rodin's small model of Jacques de Wisant from his famous large group The Burghers of Calais which is in the Rodin Museum in Paris, and his Homme Au Nez Casse (Man with a Broken Nose), which is the Galler's very latest acquisition. This life-size bronze portrait may be Rodin's homage to Michelangelo. 
Besides all these, the exhibit contains many other goodies from France that now belong to Notre Dame. Be sure to take a look and a little education before the show closes on Sunday, October 13 to make way for an exhibit of 20th Century Art which opens October 20.

ND history department sponsors lecture series 
by Bob Mader Staff Reporter 
The Notre Dame Department of History will sponsor a lecture series entitled "The Rein­terpretationof American Catholic History'' October 4-5 at the Center for Continuing Education. 
The purpose of the lecture series 
is to examine the American 
Catholic "man in the pew" ac­
cording to Prof. Jay Dolan of the 
Notre Dame History Department. 
Previous studies of American 
Catholic History have been con­
cerned with the Church hierarchy, 
or, in other words, biographies of 
bishops,andhistories of dioceses and 
Church organizations, stated­
Dolan. 
The series featuring historian from 18 Catholic, private and public universities will begin with the topic "Catholic and the Left", concentrating on the Catholic worker , peace, and social justice. The section "Catholics and New Ethnic Studies" will be concerned with Irish, Italian, and Lithuanian Catholic communities. "New Approaches in American Catholic History,' is devoted to a discussion of the methodology of studying the Catholic community. ' 
The lectures on Saturday, Oc­tober 5, will cover Church Hierarchy and American Catholic theology. The lecture series will be concluded Saturday afternoon with an informal discussion of the topiccovered in the series. 
"Notre Dame has long been identified with studies of 'American Catholicism,'' Professor Dolan said. "This lecture series is meant to strengthen this identity."
Dolan stressed that this is the first lecture series concerned with purely American Catholic History emphasizing the common man. "We are trying to fill a gap," he continued. "A pretty good area has been covered concerning the Church hierarchy. We are trying to fill in the other half of the square, so-to speak." 
Dolan explained that recent studies of the Catholic community have found that Catholics are very much in tune with revivalism, that contrary to popular belief Irish Catholic families do not have a greater number of children than other families, and that the American Catholic community has modeled itself aa great deal after its European counterpart, among other things. 
Dolan pointed out that Robert D. Cross, former president of Hunter College of New York and Swar­thmore College in Pennsylvania, currently Dean of the History Department at the University of Virginia will act as chairman­commentator of the series Friday evening. Dr. Cross is a noted historian of Catholicism. 
Admittance to the lecture series is free and students are welcome. Anyone wishing further in­formation should call the History Department or Professor Dolan.
