NixGn1s pollution push 
President Nixon's venture into the murky midwest ends today and the prospects for increased efforts toward pollution abatement look good if the President's words are to be believed. 
Wednesday the President ordered all Federal facilities to start work on eliminating air and water pollution. The costs for the program­$359,000,000, a tidy sum for cleaning up part, but only part, of the mess that has been perpetrated on our environment. 
Federal facilities are responsible for a lot of the pollution problems that the country is facing. Estimates of the cost of improving the sewage treatment system at the West Point Academy in New York on the Hudson range as high as $3,100,000 alone. Other defense installations are of equal concern. According to Russel Train, Undersecretary of the Interior and Chairman Designate of the President's Environment Quality Council, "almost all" defense installations have "serious pollution problems." Signs of the earnestness of the President's effort lies in the fact that for the first time all government and armed-services aircraft and other vehicles are covered in his order. 
The President has put a three year limitation on the amount of time that the various government agencies have to make strides toward abatement. The real test will come when the President is faced with enforcing his executive order. The order states that installation of pollution abatement equipment that may endanger national security can be exempted in special circum­stances. It will be up to the President to make sure that the Defense Department is required to live up to the same standards as other government agencies. A country ravaged by pollution to the brink of natural disaster leaves little worth defending. 
Sometime today the President will be meeting with top level Cabinet members, the Governors of Indiana, Wisconsin, Michigan, and Illinois and with the members of his Environmental Quality Council in Chicago to discuss the problems in the four state area. Quite appropriately the meeting is being held in the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago. Meanwhile, the industries in Gary and the Chicago area are destroying nature. At the rate we are going there will be little natural history to record. 
The President's message in his State of the Union Address suggested that we are now at an historical juncture. Either we exert every effort to stop polluting our environment or we will destroy it. 
We hope that today's meeting will result in bringing about an historical effort toward pollution abatement. 

SOOO MORE PEOPLE DIED IN BIAFRA TODAY 
T. C. Treanor 


Are sign-ins needed? 
Some time ago -almost a year, as a matter of fact, Chris Wolfe wrote a polemic against Parietal Hours in which he expressed fear that fornication would become manifest on campus. Now, as we all know, one does not fear fornication at Notre Dame. Rather, one welcomes it, if one is to remain a political force here. Fornication is without a doubt the school's most popular participant sport. One might as well come out against the Pope in Ireland, or against Milhous in Middle America, or against Geroge Wallace in the heart of Ku Kluxery, as come out against fornication at Notre Dame. 
So the move was a political disaster. The student body rose up as one to damn Dr. Wolfe, and even the school's most pious and pure group -the theology majors -found time away from their prayers and meditations to cluck disprovingly in poor Chris' direction. Chris Wolfe thence silenced himeself, parietal hours were passed, and the world was made safe for fornication. 
But the issue has come up again this year. Only this time, the Student Poobahs, spearheaded by the HPC, are hot after unlimited parietal hours and the end of sign-ins. It is now the Board of Trustees which are booming the sign-in system. 
Likewise, the moral issue has left fornication and has moved on to something else. Fornication has happily joined Emil T. Hoffman, Saturday football games, and Sunday Mass as Notre Dame I nstit u tio ns. 
The new moral issue is, specifically, rape. Now, while rape probably isn't quite as popular as fornication, it is at least as popular as chess. So there will be no attempt from the source to morallize on rape. Only to point out a few points of law. 
In Indiana, as in most places here in the USA, rape is not considered culturally a great leap forward. In spite of that it is illegal. It is also quite difficult to prove. Subsequently, the Courts, in an effort to preserve both the laws and the chastity of the maidens of the Indiana Free State, tend to listen with only one ear -and that a tin one -to the protestations of the accused, particularly if the accused is a college student. 
Concurrently, an impressively large number of the maidens of the 
Indiana Free State -largely under eighteen -get their kicks by 
accusing Notre Dame students of rape, statutory rape, ad nauseum. 
Two years back, when the Observer wasn't old enough or ambitious 
enough to run an investigation -one of these maidens charged that 
a hall was running a "ring of prostitution." No one seems to know 
what happened to the case, but whatever the outcome, the whole 
process would have been dismissed a lot more smoothly had the 
sign-in desk been properly manned. 
For where does rape, statutory rape, prostitution, etc., happen, if 
it happens? Not at the Rockne Center. Not in Sacred Heart Church. 
Not in Chris Wolfe's imagination. No, it happens in rooms. And if a 
girl wants to pretend she was raped in a room that the sign-in sheet 
says she wasn't even in, she stands little chance of winning her case, 
even in Indiana. 
Hall Presidential elections loom, and there will surely be a 
spectacular number of candidates ready to drop parietal hours and 
burn the sign-in desk. Parietal Hours, predicated on the subliminally 
ridiculous belief that something will happen between 2 to 7 a.m. 
that hasn't happened 8 p.m. to 2 a.m., should go. But the sign-in 
desks guard us against Indiana justice, and should stay.

the individual should go against the state.

AT THE NOTRE DAME BOOKSTORE If the proposed volunteer army goes in effect, people would be inducted for five to ten years on a voluntary basis. The military would then provide a choice of technical education for the enlistees. 
Crawford's committee de­Cided that if the military did provide an education for the soldiers, the G.I. bill would no longer be necessary since the men would be earning a salary after they were out of the service. 
This idea was based on the assumption that all the men in the service would not be oriented toward nor would desire a college education after they were discharged. 
Theadvisory committee also felt that the number of Selective Service personnel could be reduced to save costs if a volunteer army were instituted. 
Crawford contended that the 


alleged unworkability of the 
present lottery system was the 
result of the government fixing 
state draft quotas according to 
the number of men between I 9 
and 25, while the states have 
available only those men who 
have not been deferred in the 
same age group. 
Crawford saicl that each state 
determines its own deferment 
policies and local draft boards 
also determine to some degree 
who and how many people get 
deferments. In some states 
nearly 50% of the men between 
19 and 25 are deferred. 
As a result, approximately 75% of the states are going to have trouble not exceeding the theoretical number of 240 in the draft to fill this year's quotas, explained Crawford. 

At the time of the lottery drawing, government officials speculated that it was very unlikely that men who got numbers over 240 would be drafted this year. 
The draft advisory committee is also considering proposing that all student deferments be ended. Crawford believes that a proposal advocating this will be passed and released next fall. 
Crawford said that the

More uproar 1n trial 
CHICAGO (UPI) 
Defendants in the riot conspiracy trial shouted angry insults at the judge and obscenities at a prosecutor Thursday, when the judge refused to free one of them from custody. 
U.S. District Court Judge Julius J. Hoffman listened in stony silence as Yippie leader Abbie Hoffman called him a "schtunk" and walked out of the courtroom for a recess with Yippie Jerry Rubin's cries of "tyrant, tyrant" ringing in his ears. 
The judge did not act immediately to revoke bail of the offenders. He had ordered one of the "Chicago Seven," David Dellinger, jailed Wednesday for repeatedly disrupting trial proceedings. 
The seven antiwar demonstration leaders are on trial before Hoffman on charges of conspiring to incite the riots that erupted in Chicago during the I968 Democratic National Convention. 
The first storm of Thursday's trial sessions boiled up when Judge Hoffman denied a defense motion to restore Dellinger's bail and release him from the custody of U.S. marshals. 
"I'll hear no more 

arguments," Hoffman finally 
said. "I deny the motion." 
"You schtunk, a Jewish idiomatic insult,-your idea of justice is the only obscenity in the room," Abbie Hoffman yelled. "Julie, how's your war stock?" 
Rubin joined in the abuse. 

"You're the laughing stock of the world," he shouted at the judge. "Every kid in the world hates you. You're synonymous 
with  the  name  Adolf  Hitler.  
Adolf  Hitler  equals  Julius  
Hitler."  

Assistant U.S. Attorney Richard G. Schultz asked the judge not to tell the jury-which had not yet been called in-what had happened. Defendant Hoffman shouted at Schultz: "You know you ain't got no case."

A space agency official said Thursday the day may come when America will loan its pro­posed space shuttle to foreign nations. 
"A great involvement is ex­pected internationally because of the flexibility and utility of the space shuttle," said Charles 
W. Mathews, deputy associate administrator for manned space­flight of the National Aeronau­tics and Space Administration. 
"Other nations might utilize the United States' space shuttle to carry and deploy their own payloads, or to carry personnel. . .up to a space station," said Mathews. "Ultimately, w en­vision that some nations, or a consortium of nations, might ac­tually operate their own shut­tles, very much like foreign na­tions now operate U.S. devel­oped commercial aircraft."

The authors conclude with the acknowledgement that it is difficult to predict the direction of the change they see ahead for the American Catholic Church. "Still," they write, "on the basis of the perspectives of the be­havioral sciences on social change in the American Catholic community, "certain telling questions emerge: After the papal position on birth control is either retracted by Rome or disavowed by the American hierarchy, after church proper­tics have been added to civic tax rolls, and after priestly celibacy is dead --what next?"

What Mr. Faccenda did say was that obtaining an injunction was only one of the methods of dealing with demonstrations and a viable alternative to bringing

Messages traveling across the vast expanse of space can be­come garbled by the background radiation, or "noise," Massey ex­plained. This noise produces the familiar static in sound trans­mission and blur in pictures re­ceived from deep space probes, and can so garble messages that they become useless. 
The technique of coding helps spread the burden of informa­tion, allowing a computer to salvage much data that is lost through noise, Massey said. In

Law students at the Univer­sity of Notre Dame are getting a look into the life and problems of the police officer from an unusual vantage point -the front seat of a squad car. 
About 50 second-year stu­dents at Notre Dame's Law School have spent about eight hours observing South Bend police officers patroling their motorized beats as part of a four-week program begun last year and designed to acquaint prospective attorneys with police procedure. The four-week program, which has the endorse­ment of both law professors and police officials, includes a familiarization tour of the South Bend police department, follow­ed by two 8 p.m. to 10:30 p.m. observation stints in patrol cars and one night spent with a detective.

systematic codes, radio pulses representing a bit of information arc accompanied by "parity 
hits," or pulses which give infor­mation about wide sections of the code. A computer decoding the message can often piece lost sections of information together, using the parity bits. 
Massey's new non-systematic code spreads the burden of in­formation even more thinly, re­ducing the importance of each pulse and improving accuracy. The code consists only of parity bits, and contains no pulses re­presenting the information itself. The philosophy behind the code's improved performance might be compared to tiw problem of solving a picture puzzle with 10 percent of the 
Steve Kurowski, a second-year law students from Gary, Ind., who runs the program, said it grew out of a realization that "a criminal law course tends to give a one-sided view of law enforce­ment, concentrating as it does on court decisions affecting police practice. We thought if we could somehow get a 'feel' for what the policeman's problems were, we would make better attorneys." 
Glenn L. Terry, services divi­sion chief for the South Bend Police Department, agrees. "We felt there was real value in ex­posing prospective lawyers to the way in which a policeman has to handle problems growing out ,..,f a concrete situation," he explained, "compared with the way they appear later on paper."

would be easier to figure out 
what the picture must be if a 
nick were missing from each 
piece, than if an entire section of 
the puzzled were gone. 
In fact, Massey's code out­performs the best systematic codes known. In I000 trials, the code performed perfectly over simulated noise conditions, while the best systematic code produced 87 decoding errors. Massey expects such trials to win many doubting scientists to his side. "Some are quite uneasy about entrusting valuable data to a code with no hard informa­tion," he explained. 
Information theory, the new science of communicating with computers, had long predicted 
Terry said the impressive and 

serious demeanor of the law students has alleviated any police apprehension that they 
were fledgling defense attorneys 
out for ammunition they 
thought they could use later on. 
As for the law students, Kurowski reports a grow.ing sympathy with the policeman's 
lot in a tedious world of petty crime, domestic quarrels, public drunkness, and high school stu­dent fights. "There have been no observations of violations of civil liberites," Kurowski said. "In 
fact, most students are surp ." 
to see how closely police f court guidelines in arrests, example." 
The program is being enlarged for the second semester, with a estimated 60 that a non-systematic code like Massey's would be more accurate than the systematic codes now used. However, most researchers had assumed that such complicated codes would require complex computer equipment, and would be incom­prehensible to scanning engi­
neers  without  complete  decod­ 
ing.  
The  resulting  system  

proved far superior to the best systematic codes known and allowed engineers to moniior in-.

at them in a new way, they combine into an idea that can change the world. 
Reverse osmosis is a purification process that requires no phase change. It's potentially the cheap­est way to desalinate water. 
Du Pont's innovation? Hollow, semipermeable ny­lon fibers much finer than human hair. Symmetrical, with an outer diameter of .002 inch and a wall thick­ness of .0005 inch, with an accuracy of manufacture maintained at close to 100%. Twenty-five to 30 million of them encased in a precisely engineered unit 14 inches in diameter by 7 feet long. ' 
The result: a semipermeable surface area of about 85,000 square feet-the size of a 2-acre lot-and up to 10,000 gallons of desalted water per day. 
So far "Permasep"® permeators have been used experimentally to purify brackish and polluted water, and in various industrial separations. But the po­tential to desalt seawater, too, is there.

The Community Relations commission of St. Mary's College is announcing a Volunteer Services Night to be held Wed­nesday, Feb. 11, from 7:00pm to 10:00 pm in the St. Mary's Dining Hall. The purpose of the 
event  was  explained  by  SMC  
V o 1 u nteer  Services  Director,  
Maureen  Considine,  and  ND  

Community Relations Commis­sioner, Peter Kelly, in a joint letter sent to forty institutions and service organizations in the South Bend-Mishawaka area. The importance of promoting student participation in the life of the rest of the community was emphasized: 
"We want to impress upon students that for the four year period while they are attending school here, South Bend is their home, much more than Chicago, or Cleveland or Indianapolis or wherever." 
We also feel that if a Univer­sity is to develop educated,

understanding, concerned human beings, it is not fulfilling itself if it is a shady glen of re­treat. True, it is very easy to become involved in campus activities all of which are impor­tant. However it is just as easy to become so campus-oriented that the student can completely lose touch with the community of which he should be a part." 
Besides about fifteen local groups, all campus-located service organizations will be recruiting help Wednesday. Representatives from The Reformer, Northern Indiana Children's Hospital, Family and Children Center, Christian Democratic Movement (which is working to reform the Depart­ment of Correction of the State of Indiana), Model Cities-Model Neighborhood Program, St. Jose ph County Tuberculosis League, and the Mental Health Ass. of St. Joseph County. The 
volunteer jobs available range 
from nurses aids, working with retarded children, and tutoring to publicity work, public rela­tions and fund raising and many more. 
Maureen explained that the Kennedy Institute held a similar "Social Action" night during the first semester hut that no South Bend service organizations were represented, and only a smat­tering of campus organizations attended. It is hoped that Vol­unteer Services Night will more completely represent volunteer opportunities available to stu­dents. 
There are many students who are genuinely interested in volunteer work of some kind, but who do not know where to go for information. At the same time, there are organizations; both community and campus who are desperate for volunteer help, but do not know where to turn for this help. Both Maureen and Peter feel that Volunteer Services Night presents a golden opportunity for the two parties to get together. 
Need volunteers for Arts Center

Center efforts. 
Dowdall sa!d, "The Center will benefit and will try to in­volve the entire community. The effort asks people who are not 'artists' as such to donate their talents to help improve cultural life for all here on campus." 
He continued, "Financial pro­gress went slowly during January due to exams, but we are in the process of submitting, now, sev­eral proposals to various persons who are known to be patrons of the arts. If these people like the plans we may be well on the road to our quota." 
Dowdall disclosed that one of the proposals would have one particularly avid appreciator of the arts donate almost th~ entire $1.8 million. He was pleased with response so far and stated, "We are now in the formation stage of a finalized committee to start channeling the money." 
The Commission has already secured adequate funds to main­tain administrative costs for the next few months. Other contri­butions for this purpose are ex­pected to be forthcoming. 
The Commission will soon re­lease a letter to the community reiterating its goals and suggest­ing some procedures to achieve these goals. 
"This letter will show our pro­gress and give people another chance to see the unique and in­novative efforts of our group," Dowdall said. 
In support of this need for a Center, Dowdall cited the fact that Dartmouth, a school often cited as similar to Notre Dame in enrollment and ideals, now has a new I 0 million dollar Arts Cen­ter. 
Dowdall was quick to cite what he called a "very coopera­
tive  and  positive approach"  to  
the  idea  from  the  administra­ 
tion. He  emphasized  the Com­ 

mission is working very closely with him in the campaign.
