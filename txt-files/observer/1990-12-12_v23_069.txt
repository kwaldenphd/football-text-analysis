"Under Margaret Steinfels' editorship. what was already a finn pnriodical has strength­mwd its reputation as an indis­pensable voice in the conversa­tion of our Church." said Uni­versity President Father Ed­ward Malloy.

Submitting a list of over 50 women as poten­tial..speakers to Malloy, Kolman said she did not specify a pref­erence as to which woman to choose. "Our main thrust was that it be a woman," she said.

Industrial magnate Armand Hammer dies at age of 92 
LOS ANGELES (AP) -Indus­trialist Armand Hammer was remembered Tuesday as a tire­less crusader for international peace who impJ:.Oved the human condition by investing millions in education, medicine and the arts. 
The flamboyant, globe-trot­ting chairman of Occidental Petroleum Corp., the nation's 16th largest industrial com­pany, died a-t his home in the Westwood district late Monday following a brief illness. He was 92. 
The cause of death was not revealed, although associates said privately Hammer had been suffering from kidney problems. He died just one day before a planned celebration for his belated bar mitzvah.

Madonna employs smut, not substance 
Yesterday I was lis­tening to the radio and heard a familiar Anna Marie female voice pant 
Tabor
"Wanting ... Needing ... Waiting." I grimaced and popped in a CD. Never underestimate Asst. SMC Editor the power of shock value. It has certainly worked for Madonna.·--------­
Being an avid follower of popular music, my interest in the elusive, energetic singer traGes back to the days of "Borderline" when she was the cute rebel with the belly­button. Because Madonna is so unpre­dictable, I was always slightly eager to see what issue she'd tackle next and what color her latest dye job would be. 
Madonna definitely has a unique style and is somewhat of a legend in her own time. In this business of Milli Vanilli's, I'd even say that she is multi-talented performer. While her image is not exactly wholesome, many of her contributions to the music industry have been positive. 
"Papa Don't Preach" can be interpre!ed as there being options other than abortiOn for an unplanned pregnancy. "Vogue" en­dorsed a street dance craze and gave The Roger Rabbit a rest. All of her songs are at least interesting or danceable. Until now. "Justify My Love" is not even palatable. 
In an interview on Nightline about the 
video that MTV refuses to air, "Justify My 
Love" was shown in its entirety. "Like A 
Prayer" raised a few eyebrows, but her lat­
est has been touted to astronomical 
heights. Which could be exactly what 
Madonna wanted. People will be curious to 
see what is so allegedly offensive and buy 
her video when it hits the market. 
Furthermore, if video stores refuse to 
carry the video single or put a warning 
label on it, it will be in even greater 
demand. Recall how controversy 
popularized "The Last Temptation of 
Christ." (Not that the two are in the same 
category.) 
Contrary to Madonna's iflsistence that she 
is encouraging sexuality awareness and 
open, healthy discussions with parents, I 
see nothing noble in her 'attempt. I also 
resent her telling me what I and everyone 
else fantasizes about. Since when are 
voyeurism and bisexuality universally 
desired?

WORLD 

Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze urged the Bush ad­ministration Tuesday to make a last­ditch diplomatic effort to avert war in the Persian Gulf. "It is also my strong hope that U.S. troops will not see ac­tion," Shevardnadze said at a news conference near the end of a two-day meeting here with Secretary of State 

James Baker. Referring to the high-level talks President Bush has proposed with Iraq, the Soviet foreign minister said; "We pin much hope on the coming contacts." But Baker said Baghdad had still not agreed on a date for him to go to Iraq to see President Saddam Hussein. He of­fered any time between Dec. 20 and Jan. 3, but again re­jected any Iraqi attempt to delay the visit until just before the Jan. 15 deadline set by the U.N. Security Council for Iraq to pull out or face the prospect of military measures. 
Norway, which already has the world's most ex­pensive cigarettes, is trying to stop smoking everywhere indoors and wipe out the habit in a decade. Even a smoker's home may not be his castle for long. Schools and day-care centers tell children about the dangers of passive smoking and encourage them to tell their parents to quit or smoke outside. Norwegians with tobacco habits are responding by rolling their own cigarettes, using butts over again, taking snuff and smoking on balconies. Tore Sanner, a professor at the Oslo Cancer Institute and head of the smoke-free campaign, granted that the num­ber of smokers has remained constant for 10 years de­spite increasingly aggressive measures. About 1.2 million Norwegians smoke, or 37 percent of the population, but fewer young people are starting. Tobacco consumption has dropped only marginally, to 6,700 metric tons a year from 6,800 in 1980. 
I try to look at it this way: Madonna can only go so far before she has to tone it down. The next cut might have a little sub­stance or at least a good beat and not rely on hype and hormones to sell records. Un­fortunately, that's what seems to be what we buy. The Controversy Queen knows this. I'd like to see her redeem herself by taking a stand on a less over-worked subject than sex and use an approach other than the dangling -carrot-in-front-of-the-donkey, scandal-ridden method. 
Then again, maybe Madonna has mas­tered human nature.

Tribal clash in South Africa kills 37 people 
TOKOZA, South Africa (API­Factional rivalries erupted in warfare Tuesday in Tokoza, where Zulus and Xhosas slashed and shot 37 people to death and burned scores of homes before black officials held peace talks. 
In the afternoon, when the violence had died down, women piled household belongings on their heads and fled in the rain to seek shelter in a nearby township. 
Armed men stayed behind, guarding their shacks in the impoverished township and the workers' hostels that .have be­come a flashpoint of factional unrest. 
Hepresentatives of the Afrkan National Congress and the lnkatha Freedom Party, whosn supporters are at the center of the clashes, met later and said they would appeal to their followers to stop fighting. 
Past appeals from leaders of the rival groups have made lit­tle difference. The death toll in Johannesburg townships has exceeded 1,000 since August, and ANC leader Nelson Man­deJa and lnkatha leader Man­gosuthu Buthelezi have yet to sit down to talk. 
Buthelezi, citing a tight schedule and late notice, re­jected an invitation to tour Tokoza on Wednesday with Mandela and other black lead­ers. lie said he instead would visit Tokoza separately with national Law and Order Minis­ter Adriaan Vlok and said Mandela declined an invitation to join them. · 
Group shows women ways to balance work with family 
By ANN MARIE HARTMAN News Writer 
"Compartmentalizing" is the key to successfully balancing studies or work with commit­ments to family or other rela­tionships. according to a dis­cussion group sponsored by the Year of Women Committee. 
At a brown bag lunch discussion held in LaFortune Tuesday, various women shared their difficulties with balancing a family and a career. One of the attende.es said that what has worked best for her has been to, "compartmentalize; do work at work, school at school, and do family when I am at home." 
A representative of the Year of Women Committee, Kathie Newman of the Physics De­partment, discussed various child care options for working mothers and the necessity of finding one with which the parents are both comfortable. Overall, each of the working mothers said that even though their lives do not leave much 
time  for  them  to  be  
themselves,  they  all  are  
leading very rich lives.  

These brown-bag lunch meetings, over the course of the semester, have discussed several topics relating to the work environment. Each discussion has had several group leaders who have generally been from the faculty, staff, or graduate students of the Colleges of Sciences of Engineering of Notre Dame or from sister departments at St. Mary's. 
These meetings were held on an experimental basis this semester. They have been well-received, Newman hopes that they will continue next semester. Sessions are open to all willing to share and participate. Future topics can be suggested at the meetings.

Faculty Senate discusses libraries' faults 
By KATE MANUEL News Writer 
At Tuesday's meeting of the Faculty Senate, Robert Miller, director of University Libraries, said that, despite weaknesses in current library resources and services, the library has improved over the years and will continue to improve, if it receives input from faculty members and other library users. 
"The libraries are basically about delivering information to researchers. Each individual has different needs and we have to try to respond to those needs. Our mission is a compli­cated one," said Miller. 
Limitations to delivering in­formation are posed by the availability of resources, the range of information needs that individuals have, and the formiJ.t in which research is presented, he said. 
Because library users occa­sionally need resources that have been checked out be other users, the library also faces problems with confidentiality in its circulation system, he said. 
"The library profession at present has a code of ethics ­no one under any circum­


. stances has any idea of who has checked out what," he said. "We are trying to be idealistic and realistic in finding a solu­tion to conflicting needs. We'd like to ask each member of the faculty and student body if they'd want their name re­leased." While most undergraduate areas of study have reasonably good library collections, and the library does have nationally recognized collections of theol­ogy, medieval studies, and sports material, the library is especially weak in current jour­nal subscriptions, he said. He also said that the library staff is committed, but inade­quate in size to meet user needs, that the budget leaves no room for flexibility or expansion, and that library technology is reasonable, but not on the cutting edge. "We have made a lot of progress in the last ten years. We have made progress in our ability to serve; we are doing better at meeting local needs than fifteen years ago," Miller said. "We have grown in our

endowments. We have new, and I hope, better copiers. We are getting materials into UNLOC more quickly, and I think we've generally made a lot of progress with UNLOC. 
Despite these improvements, Miller said he would like to see improvements in coverage for all undergraduate areas of study and for nationally recog­nized collections and the provi­sion of facilities for the use of full-text data. 
"We also hope to provide fa­cilities that are more conducive to the work of graduate stu­dents. We have increased the number of carrels but we hope to provide a place for graduate students to work together," he said. 
"We'd also like _to to extend hours, especially of branch li­braries which ani grossly inad­equate in size, environment, and facilities. We are hoping this will change in the near fu­ture," he said. 
Miller said that faculty mem­bers can help the library im­prove by sharing criticisms and praises with library personnel, by telling the library what stu­dents will need for their classes, by responding to sur­veys, by considering member­ship in the Friends of the Li­brary of Notre Dame, and by having patience as the library improves.

"I'm not a programming body. As Treasurer, I have no say [in how an organization spends its money], as long as it falls within the constraints of the Student Government Consti­tution." 
"I don't think the groups use the [Student Activities] Fee as effectively as they could to keep the clubs going," Hanley stated. "It's not [these] people's own money, so they're not as cau­tious on how they spend it." 
One big problem in the allo­cation process is the amount of duplication in organizations' activities, said Hanley. He pointed to Student Govern­ment's Intellectual Life and SUB's Ideas and Issues De­partments as one example where money is allocated for two organizations that are essentially the same. ':Can you tell me the difference between these two?" he said. 
Intelle'ctual Life is, according to Pasin, "very cost-intensive." He cited Intellectual Life and

Public Relations as two de­partments where much of the Student Government budget is spent. 
For the 1990-91 budget, $17,500 was allocated for Intel­lectual Life, and $32,000 was allocated for Ideas and Issues. 
Of the organizations receiving Student Activities funds, "HPC is the most effective group," according to Hanley. "Their money goes right into the dorms," he added, pointing to the Keenan Revue, St. Ed's Car­nival, and Mr. Stanford as evi­dence of the funds' use. 
Those organizations request­ing Student Activities funds must follow a budget procedure before receiving their alloca­tion. 
Each group must submit a proposal to the Budget Com­mittee, a standing committee of the Student Senate, which meets every April. This groupis headed by the Student Body Treasurer and is composed of the Student Body President, Vice President, one class presi­dent, one HPC chairperson, the SUB manager, and the Club Co­ordination Council Chairman. · 

"Each group submits a bud­get proposal, and the Budget Committee reviews it and usu­ally slashes it, " Pasin admitted. "It's a hellacious thing," he continued, citing the 20 or more hours the committee spends reviewing the numerous proposals each April. 
The Student Senate then re­views the Budget Committee's proposed budget ·and "has al­ways approved it in the past." said Pasin. 
"There's been a very signifi­cant and important change in the way clubs receive money," Hanley said, referring to the newly organized Club Coordination Council. This group reviews each club's budget proposal, and then turns its recommendations for all the clubs over to the Budget Committee. 
"The Club Coordination Coun­cil is a big step towards im­proving the budgeting process. But it's still a tough process," Hanley said, referring to the

Budget Committee's larger re­view of the individual propos­als. "There are a lot of person­alities involved. People not only look out for themselves, but they also attack others." 
"When [everyone else's bud­get] is on the firing line, it's 'slash, slash, slash,' but when it comes time for their own bud­get to be proposed, it's 'we're down to the bare minimum.'" 
Hanley stressed that the bud­geting is "n-ot an arbitrary pro­cess," and is not simply a con­tinuation from last year's bud­get. 
All of the $410,000 has not yet bee·n allocated this year. A sum of $12,000 has been set aside in a contingency fund for unanticipated expenses, said Hanley. 
According to Hanley, there was a surplus of $40,000 of Student Activities funds left over at the end of last year's Student Government adminis­tration. 
"All the money left over goes into an outside account that earns interest," said Pasin. "This is called the 'carry for­ward fund' and it is used for capital expenditures." 
Pasin cited the new Notre Dame Video Store as one ex­ample of a capital expenditure which used the carry forward funds, as well as purchasing vans _for the Center for Social Concerns, "which all clubs can use." 
Pasin stressed the fact that no Student Activities funds are being used for the Student Gov­ernment lecture series. "This is strictly corporate-sponsored," ht;l explained, noting that the average cost for each lecture speaker is around $8,000, plus travel and lodging expenses.

A morning fog covered Inter­state 75 over the Hiwassee Hiver, about 40 miles north of Chattanooga, when the 75­vehicle pileup began about 9:30 a.m., said Cecil Whaley, direc­tor of the Tennessee Emergency Management Ag1mcy. 
People involved in the acci­d!mt, which covnred more than a mile of the intersJ.ate, de­scribed hearing booms in the fog as dozens of tractor-trailers collided with each other and with cars. 
Traveling salesman Ralph Fisher of Cleveland, Tenn .. was headed north when he hit the fog patch. lie said he noticed traffic slowing down so he pulled to the roadside. 
"After that I started hearing bangs and booms from every­where. Immediately after that there was a truck on fire from across the road. We stared hearing them banging and booming from over there. Then all of a sudden you started hearing them from every­where," said Fisher, 43. 
Whaley confirmed 15 dead, but said the number could rise as crews searched the burned shells of vehicles. In some cases, only nameplates distin­guished the wreckage of a car smashed into the side of a truck. 
"This is one of the worst ac­cidents that anyone can re­member happening in Ten­nessee in terms of the number of vehicles and fatalities in­volved," said Whaley, who fol­lowed rescue efforts from his Nashville office. 
Names of the victims would not be immediately released because some of the bodies were burned beyond recognition, Whaley said. 
Authorities believe an initial accident occurred in the south­bound lane, and cars jumping the median or people rubber­necking to see the southbound crash may have caused the sec­ond pileup in the northbound lane. 
From there, authorities say it was a ghastly chain reaction. 
Russell Newman, eastern dis­trict regional director of the Tennessee Emergency Medical Agency, says no one is really sure what happened.

Some U.S. citizens will stay in Iraq 
WASHINGTON (AP) -More than 500 Americans, a majority of them children, will remain in Kuwait and Iraq after this week's evacuation flights, although the number who are doing so voluntarily is unclear, the State Department said Tuesday. 
Spokesman Richard Boucher said some families with one_or more Americans are staying because they have roots in Iraq or Kuwait. In other cases, the non-American head of house­hold has been un.able to obtain permission from Iraqi authori­ties to leave. . 
Just how many there are in each category could not be de­termined. 
The evacuation of Americans appeared all but over Tuesday, as only eight boarded a gov­ernment-chartered Boeing 707 in Baghdad, a department offi­cial said. When the same plane had left Kuwait en route to Baghdad, there were no Ameri­cans aboard. 
With the exception of three Americans who have had visa · problems, Boucher said, all

Americans who wish to leave Iraq and Kuwait apparently have left, so far as is known. 
On the chance that some Americans appear who have not yet made their presence known to U.S. officials, an ad­ditional charter flight is planned for Thursday. White House spokesman "Marlin Fitzwater said that flight is likely to be the last. There are five U.S. diplomats working at the embassy in Kuwait and all will be brought home soon, but it has not yet been decided whether they will be aboard the Thursday flight. 
The three other Americans who have been left behind had been among those used by Iraqi authorities as human shields to deter a potential U.S. military strike, Boucher said. 
He said that as many as 510 Americans will remain in Kuwait and Iraq permanently." That is more than half the number who were in the two countries when President Sad­dam Hussein announced last week that all foreign hostages were free to go home. 
"As of today, we believe that as many as 310 Americans have chosen to stay in Kuwait," 
Boucher said. "This includes 60 
women, 215 children, and 35 
males with dual Kuwaiti-Amer­ican citizenship.

Pro-life advocate stoops to life swapping 

Dear Editor: 
I find going to an abortion debate one of the most vivid reminders these days of human fallibility. Not only can we not agree on the issue, but many refuse to admit absolute 
'knowledge of some of the facts, 
such as when human life truly 
begins. 
Yet there must remain some absolutes in our society. We must, for example, if we are to have society at all, believe in such· causes as human preser­vation. The abortion issue, however,· finds us imposing. human judgements over this very instinct in the interest of convenience and facility. 
The abortion debate that took place on Nov. 29 was clouded by hypocrisy as each contender asserted or negated this abso­lute to meet his own ends. Not only did hypocrisy color the views of Ms. Weddington, the lawyer whose victory in Roe v. Wade still plagues our society, but a harshly contradictory statement made by Mr. Scheidler, the executive director of the Pro-Life Action League, served to blight his otherwise forceful argument. 
Mr. Scheidler compromised his pro-life position when he struck a bargain with society that he would stop supporting a death penalty if abortion were outlawed. Is the pro-life movement now to str>op so low as to employ the pro-choice technique of swapping life for life, of deciding which human being's right should be dis­pensed with to acpieve their own ends? It is· bargaining that advocates of choice actually engage in, weighing the rights of the child against tbose of the mother, or figuring whether the probable quality of the child's life renders it worthwhile, as if the life of a human being should be subject to our eco­nomic laws of supply and de­mand or profit-expenditure. 
For Mr. Scheidler to barter human life, deciding which is desirable and which disposable, and for him to support the death penalty, is for him to say his objections to abortion are not based on the right to life inherent in being human, but on some other kind of subjected decision. Quality or worthiness,

perhaps? How dare he claim the right to decide if another human being has the right to live and then attack Ms. Weddington for subjecting hu­mans to th6Se same decisions of her own! 
As pro.choice orators usually are, Ms. Weddington was well­
·versed in all the typical examples of advantageous exchanges of human beings: child for mother, child for child, helpless for powerful. For instance, she was quite concerned about the parents of a large family who might desire to eradicate any "extra" little blessings in order to better love and provide for the children they already have. She adamantly complained that many people worry a great deal about human life before birth, but fail to care for human life in the rest of society. She pleaded for expressions of the worth of human life through care of children and adults already visible in society rather than concentration on the lives of those unborn. 
Better living conditions for the less fortunate of our society, increased love and attention to nurture our growing children, and overall concern and respect for the worth of human life are wonderful pursuits: not our choices, but rather things we must always strive for by laws of self-preservation and human decency. But how can wrenching the unborn baby. from her womb enable a mother to better love her children? How can a society that supports the murder of its most innocent and vulnerable foster concern for the welfare of its dependents and nurture its young? 
How can the worth of human life be respected when that life is being subjected to human judgements and technological capabilities cannot claim con­trol. Respect for the human right to live must begin at the beginning of life and not end until the last breath is drawn. Overstepping this boundary negates the absolute, leaving each and everyone of us at the mercy of the masses.

Families Suffer from soldiers' brutality 
Dear Editor: 
My neighbors in Kuwait were living comfortably. They had a nice home, nice cars; they were a nice family. On the ninth day of the invasion, Iraqi soldiers broke into their house. They were stealing cars and other valuables and this house looked nice. 
When the soldiers came in, the family was sitting at supper: two parents and four teen-aged daughters. The soldiers tied up and gagged the man; he was about fifty. He was a man of peace. He did not protest. 
The soldiers packed every­thing they could in the family's cars. The woman and her daughters were crying. They said to the woman, "Choose your favorite daughters: you keep two and the conquerors take two!" She fell to her knees and begged them not to take her girls. "These are my ba­bies," she said. "They are like your sisters. You are like my sons." She begged and begged and begged. 
They laughed. "Choose two or we will take all four," they said. She kissed their boots and begged them not to in the name of everything they believed in. "We are all leaving," they warned. She chose to save her two youngest daughters. But they did not leave. "You took too long," they said. "We are going to punish you." 
They raped her two youngest daughters in front of her eyes. They took turns. When they were done, they took the other two daughters with them. After four and a half weeks of searching, she found her daughters dead. They had been repeatedly raped and beaten....

The other day as I was dig­ging through my desk I came upon Joe Moody's "translation" of Hotel California by the Eagles. .Joe pointed out that the song was a reference to the satanic church. I, being the journalist that I am, decided to ask around for other people's opinions. 
People had no trouble believ­ing that this song and many others were really evil songs with references to satanism, death and drug use. Some of the other songs with these drug references people mentioned were not Metallica or Iron Maiden but Led Zeppeli·n's "Stairway to Heaven" and Peter, Pauf. and Mary'& "Puff the Magic Dragon." 
Now I know I am only a freshman (as some people pointed out oh-so-tastefully re­cently) but I think I have found another song to add to the list. 
I know my discovery might shock a few people, but after dis<;.ussing hidden messages with these mental giants, I don't know how I could have ever been so blind. These peo­ple are so right. 
Now when I listen to Led Zeppelin and Pink Floyd these satanic death lyrics become glaringly obvious. Granted, .Jimmy Page and Roger Waters are geniuses at disguising t~eir true message, but individuals like Joe Moody have shoWn me th& light. I have since disposed of all my records except for ".John Denver and the Muppets' Christmas."

s! Beware of e satanic carols 
Michael Snyder Duke On Stuff 

-the other night at , a "graceful" Christmas SYR, I heard the song that turned my life around. I was standing there, between the bed and my curly straws when the lyrics h.it me square across the face. It was so obvious, so apparent. I couldn't understand why I hadn't figured it out before. It was if my entire had been cleansed and my life had a new meaning. "Jingle Bells" is straight from Hell! 
Dashing through the snow ... 
The word dashing indicates the individual is out of control because of the break-neck speed they are racing at. This racing is obviously caused by this "snow", which is a common · term for cocaine. This is an ex­plicit invitation for you and me to join the race by doing drugs. 
In a one horse open sleigh ... 
A one horse sleigh indicates to the listener that there is only one available and open path to true enjoyment of life. This line, along with the next two lines, shows the author's evil intent. · 
Over the fields we go ... 
The word "over" indicates the people are flyin'g over a field by some supernatural force, probably the devil's work. The word "we" tells the listener to bring along their friends to join in these evil do­ings. 
\ 
This is an obvious and easy line to decipher. This laughing is obviously referring to "snow" or cocaine. The words "the way" again tell the listener that his or her path is already cho­sen and all they can do is join by drug induced hallucinations. 
Ha Ha Ha ... 
·This line is nothing more than screams of ecstasy from fornication. 
Bells on bobtail ring ... 
These bells are obviously re­ferring to John Dohne's quote "Do not ask for whom the bell tolls, it tolls for thee." This quote concerns the good ole' days when the dead were col­lected right at your front doorstep. One knew when the undertaker was coming by the bells he would ring. 
Making spirits bright ... 
This line tells one that the only truly happy or "bright" inc dividuals are the "spirits", which are, of course, the dead. The author is practically beg­ging us to walk among the dead. Another possible inter­pretation is that the "spirits" are alcohol in the form of punch which is a violation of DuLac. 
Oh what fun it is to ride and sing a sleighing song tonight ... 
This line tells the listener "Hey, come along. Everybody's doing it. You can quit any time. It's just one." The author uses the bandwagon effect to con­vince the reader to join in on this song of death and drug abuse. 
It is apparent to me exactly what the author's intent was in writing this song. It is an open invitation for all of us to enter the dark and evil world of drugs and death. Not only are the lyrics morally corrupt, but when I played the song back­wards, I heard subliminal mes­sages. . 
This technique, known as backmasking, plays upon the subconscious mind which picks up the message that the con­scious mind can not. When one plays the chorus backward, if one tistens very carefully, one can hear "Women and Football Don't Mix." I don't have to tell anyone how I feel about that. (Nor do I want to hear what you think about that anymore.) 
Needless to say, I \VaS of­fended. This song is evil for­ward and backward and should be taken off records every­where. Every time a child hears this song, they have to fight off the corrupt and rude messages the song contains. 
I would just like to thank those individuals responsible for my awakening. I am mak­ing a personal vow to ban "Jingle Bells" forever. I don't know how I could have ever been so blind when the lyrics are so blatant. I'm not sure how successful my crusade will be, but this will put a new per­spective on Christmas classics like ''I'm Dreaming of a White Christmas," (another reference to drugs) and "Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer." (Perhaps Rudolph has been using the nose candy in his stocking!)

at Christmas break, there are just a few more things we would like to share with you. If you have thought about study­ing in Rome but never got around to applying, it it not too late. Prove something to your­self and get an application. Everyone should experience a semester or year abroad if pos­sible. 
Some of the experiences were silly and pretty unimport!nt. Nevertheless, they have made an impression and will not be forgotten. For instance, many of us will never forget seeing Ma and Pa Kettle or "The Bold and the Beautiful" on television in Italian. Italian MTV must be experienced and should not be explained. 
Our group will never forget our self-appointed "song advi­sor," Matteo, who always found an appropriate song to fit an occasion. "Happy Birthday" and the theme song to "The Jetsons" were two of the easier tunes, but it. was a challenge to remember the words to "The Mary Tyler Moore Show." 
"If you have thought about studying in Rome, ... prove something to yourself and get an.application." 
We will always credit Dave for helping us study our art history. His imitative poses were more interesting and use­ful than the book alone. All of these things are little experi­ences that are noticed by an in­dividual either alone or as part of a group. Some may be silly, but they will not be forgotten. 
This is the last article for the semester from the students in Rome. Although I am returning to Notre Dame next semester, perhaps someone will keep the home campuses aware of the existence of the students abroad. Personally, I want to thank the other students in Rome for their support-and yes, they will see this article-because fnany of my ideas were based on their words and actions. 
To any students who have considered studying abroad for a semester or a year, I hope the articles have given you an idea of some of the more personal aspects of the experience. Nothing is perfect. You will not be pleased with every aspect of the program, but that is a per­sonal opinion. It really is an opportunity to change ( I know I did even though I laughed when people told me the same thing.) 
It is a fantastic risk to take. A person really steps away form the security of friendships and family, even more so than freshman year. Most impor­tantly, the whole trip is what you want it to be and what you make of it.

Bucks down Bulls, Robinson unplugs Pistons 
MILWAUKEE (AP) -Jay Humphries scored 21 points and the Milwaukee Bucks went on a 24-10 tear in the third quarter to beat the Chicago Bulls 99-87 Tuesday night, set­ting set a club record with an 11-0 start at home. 
Frank Brickowski added a season-high 19 points, Alvin Robertson 16 and Jack Sikma 15 as the Bucks took over first place in the Central Division with a 15-6 record. Milwaukee was 10-0 at home to start the 1984-85 season. 
Chicago, which had beaten the Bucks 18 of 21 times the last three seasons including the playoffs last season, was led by Michael Jordan with 31 points. Scottie Pippen added 14 points. 
Milwaukee used a 13-2 surge early in the third quarter -the only spurt by either team up to that point-to open u~ a 66-60 lead. Robertson had 6 points and Sikma 5 in the spurt. 
Jordan scored twice for the Bulls to cut it back to 2 points, but the Bucks went on an 11-1 surge behind 5 points from Brickowski to lead 77-65 enter­ing the fourth quarter. 
Jordan hit a three-point play with 3:15 left to make it 87-82. But Sikma hit a bank shot and Robertson made two free throws with 2:43 to go, putting Milwaukee up 9 points. 
Spurs 95, Pistons 86 
AUBURN HILLS, Mich. David Robinson had 27 points and 16 rebounds as the San Antonio Spurs handed the De­troit Pistons their first home loss of the season, 95-86 Tues­day night. 
The Pistons, looking tired after a 1-4 trip to the West Coast, are 8-1 at Tha Palace. It was only their second loss in 14 games in which they have held opponents under 100 points. 

Joe Dumars led the Pistons, who missed 11 of 35 free throws, with 19 points. Isiah Thomas added 16 points and John Salley 15. Rod Stickland added 16 points for the Spurs and Sean Elliott 13. 
The Pistons, who didn't make a basket until 4:03 into the game, led by 1 point twice in the first quarter, the last at 19­18 on a basket by Salley with

"If I piGk a team to sign with, Tampa Bay would be. at the top of my list," Walsh told the St. Petersburg Times on Monday. "But there's a lot that would have to occur before we final­ized something."

everything works out, what kinl:l of offers I get," says Curry. 
Says Schafer of Curry's pro chances, "He's made a tremen­dous improvement. If he con­tinues, who knows?" 
For tile immediate future, Curry's concerns are his con­tinued improvement and the play of the team over Christmas break, when they go East to play four games. 
"I'm happy (with my play so far), but I think I can do better," 
"I have great respect for (owner) Hugh Culverhouse and great respect for the whole or­ganization," Walsh said. 
"I also think Tampa Bay can become competitive and real contenders in that division (NFC Central) right away. It's just a matter of me looking into whether I want to leave the San Francisco area at this stage of my life. That would be the prime consideration." 
he says. "The biggest part of the season is what happens after Christmas. All of the east­ern guys will be psyched." 
The Irish will have some time to kill before their neJtt'game, however, as they will enjoy a two-week vacation before they take off for the East Coast. Curry is one person who can use the rest. 
"You get run-down working out everyday," he says. 
And for a busy mechanical engineer/left wing, vacation time is a precious commodity. 

Walsh said he has not talked directly with Culverhouse, but that he has had two conversa­tions with San Francisco owner Eddie DeBartolo and 49ers president Carmen Policy about the Bucs coaching vacancy. 
He said Culverhouse had asked DeBartolo and Policy to present Tampa Bay's position in preliminary discussions. 
DeBartolo told the newspaper on Sunday that Walsh "might prefer to be the general man­ager instead of being on the field." The former 49ers coach would not elaborate on what position he would like to hold for the Bucs.

...but Browns want him, too 
The Cleveland Browns have talked to former San Francisco 49ers coach Bill Walsh about joining the organization, ac­cording to a published report. 
The report also said any Browns shakeup would not in­volve the jobs of Browns execu­tive vice president Ernie Accorsi or pro personnel director Mike Lombardi. 
The (Cleveland) Plain Dealer quoted unidentified sources as saying the Browns were one of 
·three teams to contact Walsh, now an NBC-TV analyst, about a head coaching or front-office position. The other teams are believed to be Tampa Bay and a West Coast team, possibly the Los Angeles Rams, the newspa­per said. 
"I'm not going to comment on that," Modell said when asked if Walsh had been contacted. ''I'm not going to comment on any names in relation to the coach of the Cleveland Browns." 
Bud Carson was fired as Browns head coach on Nov. 5 after the team went 2-7. 
He was replaced by Cleveland offensive coordinator Jim Shofner, who is not expected to return as head coach next sea­son but may take a post with the team's front off)ce. Under Shofner, the Browns have de­teriorated to 2-11.

New study reports higher steroid use 
STATE COLLEGE. Pa. (AP) -A limited study of five NCAA Division I-A schools suggests that 1110re than a quarter of the nation's foot­ball players may have used steroids at least once. 
A professor in Penn State's college of health and human development said Monday his study sets an "upper limit" of actual anabolic steroid use among college athletes, whereas an NCAA study done last year set a lower limit. 
"The mean overall pro­jected rate of use of anabolic steroids across all sports surveyed was 14.7 percent for male athletes and 5.9 percent of females." Professor Charles Yesalis said. 
Yesalis, who worked with researchers from Penn State

KANSAS CITY. Mo. (AP) ­Tom Watson still will not indi­cato whether he intends to re­join the Kansas City Country Club, although he said he is pleased by the club's decision to invite Henry Bloch into tho fold. 
Watson. who grew up playing golf at the 94-year-old private club, resigned Nov. 28 when he learned the club's membership committee rejected an applica­tion by Bloch, who is Jewish. 
Watson's wife and two chil­dron are .Jr,wish. He is not. 
and five other schools, said the study shows that steroid use is more widespread than earlier thought. Last year's NCAA study, based on self­reporting, estimated steroid use at less than five percent. 
"For years. a number. of re­searchers have believed that with self-reporting there's an underreporting 'of use," Yesalis said. "This represents an upper bound, and for the (irst time there are boundaries and somewhere in between is reality," Yesalis said. 
Athletes at five schools that agreed to participate in the study were asked to estimate steroid use among their oppo­nents. Even so, Yesalis said the athletes said a lot about thei~ own programs. 
The club's current and incoming board of directors an­nounced last week that if Bloch re-submitted an application it "will be acted upon favorably." 
Bloch, chairman and chief ex­ecutive of H&R Block Inc., ana­tional tax-preparation firm, said he planned to do so. 
Club president L. Chandler Smith said if Watson chooses to rejoin, he must follow proce­dure and apply for reinstate­ment. The club's board of di­rectors then must approve his application. 
Chang upsets Edberg in Slam Cup 
MUNICH, Germany (AP) ­Michael Chang won the last four games to upset top-ranked Stefan Edberg 6-4, 4-6, 7-5 on Tuesday in the opening round of the $6 million Grand Slam Cup, the richest tournament in tennis history. · 
Chang, who trailed 5-3 in the decisive set, broke Edberg's last two service games to win the error-filled match. 
"I knew I had a decent chance against him, I've played him before and he's won some 
·and I've won some," Chang said. 
Pete Sampras and Goran Ivanisevic also advanced to the second round. Sampras, the 
U.S. Open champion who is seeded fourth, overcame a sloppy start to beat Andrei Cherkasov of the Soviet Union 5-7, 6-2, 7-5. Ivanisevic, the fifth seed from Yugoslavia, ousted Kevin Curren 7-6 (7-3), 7-6 (9-7). 
The 16-man field was deter­mined on the basis of results in the four Grand Slam tourna­ments of the year -the Australian, French and U.S. Opens and Wimbledon. T-he winner gets $2 million and first-round losers receive $100,000. 
Chang's stamina and deter­mination prevailed over Edberg, who made too many unforced mistakes on his usu­ally perfect volleys. 
The victory leaves Chang trailing 5-3 in career clashfls against Edberg. Chang beat Edberg when he became the youngest Grand Slam winner at the 1989 French Open. 
Edberg was serving for the match at 5-4, but double­faulted and hit a volley wide to allow Chang pull even. Chang

then held his serve at love, the first love game of the match, then got to match point on a double-fault before passing Edberg at the net for the vic­tory. 
"The year is finished at last, and that's one good thing," said Edberg, who won only three points in the last three games. "I .missed a lot of easy shots, it's hard to get motivated after such a tough year." 
Sampras served 16 aces but struggled with his second serve and his ground strokes. 
"I rely on my first serve maybe too much," Sampras said. · 
He lost the first set when he committed two double faults. 
On the first. he fell behind 15­
40. The 19-year-old American then seTV~ed an ace but followed with another double fault to give Cherkasov the set. 
Sampras quickly took control and dominated the second set, firing three aces on the last four points to win. He had a chance to put the match away after going up a break for a 5-4 lead in the final set, but hit a forehand long on the third break point. 
But the Soviet was unable to take advantage. A spectacular passing shot down the line gave Sampras two break points and when Cherkasov netted a back­hand, the American re~ained the lead. .

He has 14 victories, sec­ond in the NHL to Chicago's Ed Belfour, and is 5-1-2 in his last eight games. Robert Reichel scored twice for the Flames, who are unbeaten (4-0-3) in their last seven road games. 
Dave Gagner had two goals for Minnesota, which lost (or only the second time in seven games (4-2-1). 
Blackhawks 4, P~nguins1 
PITTSBURGH -Troy Murray, Steve Larmer and Mike McNeill scored ju~t over four _minutes apart in the third period to give the Chicago Blackhawks a 4-1 win over the Pittsburgh Penguins on Tuesday night. 
Chicago has the NHL's best road record at 11-5-1, includ­ing a 9-2-1 streak. T·he Penguins are 1-6-1 in their last eight home games and have scored five goals in their last four games. 
Penguins goalie Frank Pietrangelo was given a 10­minute misconduct and game misconduct for arguing with referee Kerry Fraser after Larmer's goal at 10:49. Pietrangelo, apparently believ­ing he was interfered with by Mike Hudson, slammed his stick against the goal cage and was given the penalties. Wendell Young replaced him. 
Larmer scored his 22nd goal when he deflected Chris Chelios' shot from the right point. 
Islanders 3, Devils 2 
UNIONDALE, N.Y. -Ray Ferraro's second goal of the game with 42 seconds remain­ing in regulation time gave the Islanders a 3-2 victory over the New Jersey Devils, snapping New York's seven-game winless streak. 
Ferraro took a pass from Bill Berg in the DevilS: zone, used Tom Fitzgerald as a pick to avoid a defenseman and swept into the slot, where he deked Chris Terreri to the ice and shoveled a forehand shot into the vacated net. 
The Islanders had been 0-5-2 since beating Winnipeg on Thanksgiving night and are 2­7-2 in their last 11 games. 
The Devils trailed 2-0 after two periods but tied the game on power-play goals by Brendan Shanahan and Claude Lemieux. 
Capitals 4, Flyers 1 
LANDOVER, Md. -Dino Ciccarelli scored a goal and as­sisted on another as the Washington Capitals defeated the Philadelphia Flyers 4-1 on Tuesday night. 
Washington improved its record to 8-4-0 in the last 12 games and is now 5-0-1 in its last six against the Flyers.

Coleman leads the team in rebounding with 10.2 rpg even though he is only 6-6, and is second on the team in scoring with 17.2 ppg. Point guard Robert Pack, the only other Trojan player averaging in double figures at 13.2 ppg, handles most of the playmaking chores as he averages 5.8 apg. 
USC is coached by George Raveling, one of the most rec­ognized figures in all of college basketball. Raveling, whose re­

ing duties in the 1984 and.1988 Olympics, is in his fifth season at USC. 
Notre Dame, meanwhile, will count on the Texas Express backcourt of Daimon Sweet and Elmer Bennett for most of its scoring. Sweet, a 6-5 guard, leads the Irish with 16.4 ppg, while Bennett, who will con­tinue to assume the point guard duties while Tim Singleton is out with a back injury, averages 
15.5 ppg and 4.8 apg. 6-9 junior LaPhonso Ellis 
(14.9 ppg, 10.9 rpg) will be counted on for inside scoring from his forward position, and 6-11 center Keith Tower should help out on the boards. Either Kevin Ellery (11.8 ppg) or freshman Brooks Boyer will round out the starting lineup. 
Boyer and Jon Ross have been getting considerably more playing time of late, and with Singleton's injury their contin­
.ued improvement off the bench may be essential to the team's progress. Boyer in particular has been impressive ~n the last three games, averaging 9.0 ppg over that period and helping Bennett with the ballhandling chores. 
"The way I can help with Tim Singleton out of the lineup is to help bring the ball up," Boyer say. "Elmer can't do that all by himself. And if I get the open shot I think I can knock it down and maybe help out with a cou­ple of three-pointers. I'm not going to go coast to coast and dunk in anyone's face, but hopefully I can help out."
