Film sponsors merge 
by Greg Rowinski According to Commissioner Bob Brinkman, the Cultural Arts Commission has been formed this year to bring a "sense of the J\rts" to the Notre Dame -St. Mary's campus. The Commission consists of the Cultural Arts Fes­tival, the Sophomore Literary Festival, and Cinema '71. The three groups have been consolidated, Brinkman ex­plained, to bring together the necessary files and references, provide monetary stability, and to eliminate the calendar hassles and quarrels of the past. Each group will still hold its separate functions. The CAF will still present films, as will Cinema '71. However, the SLF will not

and opinions. In order to avoid the considerable time and ex­pense such an undertaking would have required, freshmen were contacted by phone and re­quested to place self-stamped, self-addressed envelopes in specified mailboxes. 
Support of their efforts was evidenced by the tremendous re­sponse--almost 78% of the class. The letter to be sent to the pa­rents will state the existing rule, present the proposed change, and invite comments. 

Another letter with essentially. the same content will be sent to each member of the faculty. They expect to have received all replies by November I. Miss Carney (:Xpressed the hope that the girls would also write to their parents and urge their sup­port of the plan. 
In order to have the rule

Dissent • SUAC and The Lib 
A minor controversy has been set off among various circles in the Administration and students with the scheduling of two con­troversial females, Ti-Grace At­kinson and Jane Fonda. 
Ti-Grace received a very hos­tile audience when she spoke here last Thursday night. In fact,

SUAC head Jim Metzger claimed that it was the first time that he had brought in anyone and had her heckled. The various ele­ments in Ti-Grace's speech, in­cluding how the church op­pressed women and her obscene language were believed to be contributing factors to audience hostility. 
The selection of Jane Fonda to speak on the "Ills of Society" has stirred criticism from many SMC students including Student Body Prc.sident Ann Marie 
Tracey. 
"It is regrettable with the number of intelligent women speakers that they have to bring in a woman noted for her theatrical and movement reputa­

work with the Indians, and work with the GI's as evidence of her commitment. 
Metzger asserted that this year, unlike under John Mroz, the Academic Commission was going to concentrate on bringing in quality speakers, rather than "anyone with a name." 
Both Ti-Grace and Jane Fonda are part of the Commis­sion's Women's ·speakers series. Co-chairman Missy Underman said that the series was not de­signed to be solely for advocates of Women's Liberation. How­ever, Jim Metzger said that potential speakers for the series included Gloria Steinham and

SLC 

The Observer wishes to extend its most profound congratulations to the distinguished Messers. of the Student Life Council for finally passing the revised judicial code. After considering some more pressing matters, like when the Stu~e~t Li_fe Council ~o.uld meet (that took an hour) or whether the minutes taken by the dJstmgUished Mr. Wmmgs were objective (half hour), the SLC finally buckled down and did a job. . . . . 
Now the Judicial Code goes up before the university Potentates a thud tune, and 1f th1s cup is once_ again refused, we are all in serious trouble. We ha~e .been.without an effective code for too long, now, and one can only hope that the Admll1JStratwn and the Board _of Trustees will put that reality ahead of the petty considerations that have so tar predominated these proceedings. . . 
When the Judicial Code was passed late last year, there was only one d1ssentmg vote ­the vote of the Student Body President. The President protested that the code was too "legalistic.' lile did not suggest an alternative to legalism in a code of laws. 
But Father Hesburgh, acting, perhaps, on this one dissenting vote, sent the bill back to the Student Life Council, with some "recwmendations." The bill was rewritten, and brilliantly rewritten, by the Rev. James Burtchaell, C.S.C., provost of this University. The Student Life Council unanimously passed the bill. 
The University Trustees vetoed the bill early this year, protesting that the controversial "double jeopardy" provision would prevent the University from prosecuting cases ab~v~ the trial board level. After much haranguing over whether this new court should be a clVll court or a criminal court, the SLC passed the Houck-Massey amendment, ·which made 
provisions for the retnal of a defendant convicted in a lower court. Once again there was 
one dissenting vote. Once again it was the Student Body President. 
It is our sincere hope that the Board of Trustees will pass the revised Burtchaell code 
forthwith. It is also our sin~ere hope that with this out of the way, the Student Life 
Council will turn itself to the problems that are facing this campus. They are many. They 
are difficult. They must be overcome. 
There is no more time for games.

1!1 Reflections on Perversion 
I 

-~[t===========::=====================================================================================================~:=:=:::::::£d £Ills 
Eleven o'clock at night. A guy and his girl are walking down the hallway to the guy's room. They pass hy the doorway where the keg is housed for the evening's indulgence in that All­American Utopiate, alcohol. Notre Dame has probably kept Anheuser-Busch in business for more than one economically dry season. The crowd in the room, all celibate by fate, not choice, is becoming unruly. They have exhausted the supply of Fugs albums. They have petitioned the Lord with prayer till their throats ache for more of the elixer, and they have finished drooling over the last three years of Playboy. They are bored. They watch the "lucky jerk" (if the euphemism is to be pardonned). 
"Hey, the broad ain't bad, man." Louder, "No, the guy's gonna get his piece tonight." Altogether, louder still, "Hey, Mac, wouldn't kick her out of 
bed myself, bring her in here so we can make a 'piece' treaty." 
The guy blushes and says something about the guys being at it again. So does the girl. That is it. Till the next night when the same guy is in almost the same place. But this time he is drunk "with the boys", and inquires as to the bra size of a young lady walking with another young man outside his window. 
Another day, another perversion. 
Ten guys are on the quad, playing football. Two girls, presumably from St. Mary's on their way to the library, walk along the quad, casting occasional wary glances at the pseudo­jocks showing off their presumed masculinity. And now, through the use of miniature microphones concealled in the quarterback's regulation Joe-College headband, the scene in the offensive huddle. 
"Hey look at the broads. Wonder if the blonde goes down?" 
"No,'she's stuck up. I already asked her and she wouldn't 
answer." "What a bitch!" Louder now, "Wannah play some ball?" Altogether, louder still, "What are you doing tonight, Honey?" Answer, "Studying." "Wannah play with me"!" The girls retreat with all deliberate speed, but not without 
having their vague suspicions about "gross Notre Dame boys" solidified. 
These two incidents, well known to any student of the University who is willing to be honest with himself, are not unique in the mentality that fosters them. They are perversions in every sense of the word. To accost young ladies with not-so-double entendre is a perversion. To cover one's walls with photographs of naked prostitutes is a perversion. To throw beer cans, apple cores, mini-footballs, toilet paper, and undifferentiated garbage at Terry Buck is perversion. 
What is the underlying cause of the above-mentioned sexual irregularities? Quite simply, it takes no sociologist or psychologist to notice the obviously and disgracefully artificial relationship he! ween the sexes here at Notre Dame. Anytime somebody finds it necessary to ask a girl for a date two weeks in advance. there is something wrong, and not with <.~nybody's pituitary glands, either. 
The obvious solution to the problem is to increase the number of women on campus. Then the guys at the keg won't have to demand eminent domain over their fellow's girl. 
The atmosphere created by the artificiality of the situation is by far the most debilitating effect of Notre Dame. Those who find out about it before they begin school do not come here. This 
University Loses its best applicants, accord!ng_ to the ~dmissions office. Those who come here talk of transternng for tour years, and participate in a myriad of perversions. They. call_ the Hot-l.ine. Tl1ey go "hogging" at the circle. No other Umversity Ill the country has extracurricular activities like this! . 
And meanwhile, the SLC meanders for hours harangumg each other about when to meet. Student Government leaders play power poli!il~S by juggling their friends int_o good jobs. . ... 
Anotlwr day, another perwrswn. Tlus, gt:mtlemen, IS llfe at Notre Dame. This is Life'!

WHO IS THE GREATEST? 
A dispute arose also between them about which should be reckoned the greatest, but he said to them, "Among pagans, it is the kings who lord it over them, and those who have authority over them are given the title Benefactor. This must not happen to you. No; the greatest among you must behave as if he were the youngest, the leader as if he were the one who serves. For who is greater: the one at the table or the one who serves? The one at the table, surely? Yet here I am among you as one who serves.

Editor: 
Your editorials to this point have continually harbored upon the absurd but one has had to refrain from responding for either of two reasons: o"ne, com­passiong dictates one's refrain and influences one's sincere desire that improvement will be the future mode. Two, one has been reluctant to comment be­cause any reactic", would only dignify your abs1:rdities and some of your rashness. 
My departure from the above position is motivated by one such rash judgment in your editorial' Bombings (October I 5, Thursday). Immediately I must say that I do not contest those strong sentiments against the recent bombings but share in them. Instead what I must take strong exception to is your judge-jury-conviction attitude 
towards Miss Angela Davis. 
At this time I do not question either Miss Davis' compulsions nor her particular methodologies (for not the least of reasons that I may concur with some of them.) However, the relevant issue for your consideration in the future must be that you render to our courts of law that which many people (and I

There are two things to sadden the reader of the Obser­ver~ report on the recent ad­dress by Ti-Grace Atkinson. One is the talk itself--where blas­phemy apparently· replaced argumentation-and the other is the Observer's direct quotation of some of the speaker's vulga­rities.

There is little this community can do to protect itself from the crudities of invited speakers. Over the long haul, the open speaker's policy is vindicated, despite such performances as that of last Thursday. One hopes, however, that students are coming to realize that the visibility of such a place as Notre Dame means that some who use its platform are more interested in self-promotion than in any commerce in ideas. 
On the second point, we have somewhat more control. While the use of obscenities has become fashionable in the so-called underground press of 
the country, the Observer would still do well to model their news treatment on such journals as The New York Times. The 'Times and other reputable dailies manage to cover a wide range of controversial material without lowering their stan­dards. It is possible to convey the flavor of a discourse such as Miss Atkinson's without the 
scatology. 
If, as I am given to under­stand, there was heckling of Miss Atkinson from some members of the audience, we have a third as­pect of the event to lament. Boorish conduct is no answer to a tasteless lecture. 
Finally, let me simply remind the editors of the Observer that, while there is no prior censor­ship of student publications on this campus, there still is an ac­countability which these ~ubli­
cations and their editors owe to the communitY. 
Yours, truly, 
Rev. John A. O'Brien, Ph.D. 
Editor: 
For a good many years I have worked in journalism and I,too, cherish freedom of the press. Why do you demean this beauti­ful right for which many journa­lists have struggled and suffered? 
I refer to the October 16 report on the talk given by Ti-Grace Atkinson. Any half-way professional writer could have given an honest accoun\-in­cluding the speaker's citicisms of the Church and denial of Mary's virginity-without descending to Miss Atkinson's vulgarity. 
I know those words. I know that you know those words. We both know that Miss At­kinson knows them. Why must you try to show off?

_Editor, 
Too often when a group or an organization is involved in some project, its president (director) incorrectly is either given credit or recognition. I believe that this often has happened in regard to the Student Union. The case in point being the Muhammed Ali­Jerry Quarry fight. Although I 
was involved in the dispute, Tom Olivieri, The Associate Director, and not I, expended the most effort. He deserves the recogni­tion of a picture in the paper for the efforts of the Student Union to secure the fight.

. THE OBSERUIR. 
Frosh must learn what N D means 
by Vic Dorr 
Observer Sportswriter 
This is Coach Dt:nny Murphys first year at the helm of the Notre Dame Freshman Team. and surely no one can blame him for experiencing mixed emotions when he considers the opposition facing his charges in 1970. 
The Irish yearlings will play a three game slate this season. They will entertain Michigan State tomorrow, and Tennessee on October 31, before heading to Ann Arbor for a November 7 game with the Wolverine First-year men. The Spartans, of course. pose the most immediate threat to Murphy's freshman squad. 
"Michigan State's going to be higher than a kite when they come down here for the game," said Murphy, "and I've tried to impress this upon the boys. I've tried to make them realize that everyone wants a piece of Notre Dame." The Irish coach will have to wait only until I :30 tomorrow afternoon to see what effects his exhortations have had on the players. The Spartans will square off against Notre Dame with a team that is somewhat lacking in balance, but that features several outstanding performers. Quarterback Mark 
Nie'sen and running backs Bill Simpson and Mike Holt have drawn raves from their coaches, 
as  have  guard Ray  Nester and  
end  Mike  Hurd.  
Murphy  will  meet  the  

Michigan State challengt: by unveiling an Irish Freshman Team that is a potential powerhouse. Competition has been keen for the starting positions on this squad, but no where more so than at quarterback. Cliff Brown, a six-footer from Middletown, Pennsylvania, will probably receive the starting nod, but two other candidates, )'om Creevy and Brian Doherty, have shown well in practice, and both will play depending on the game situation. Greg Hill, perhaps the most effective runner the Freshmen possess, will start at right half, and his running mate at left half will be Gary Diminick. Other certain starters for the offense include tight end Dave Casper and center Mark Brenneman. The offensive co-captain will be Frank Pomerico. The defense, led by linebacker co-captain Tom Devine will employ the 4-4-3 setup which has been proven so effective by the varsity this year. The front four-ends George Hayduk and Dennis Lozzi, and 

tackles Dan Morrin and Larry Suske-average around 230 pounds. and should prove mort: than a match for their Spartan counterparts. Besides Devine, the linebacking unit includes Joe Alvarado, Brian Clemente, and Tim Sulliwan, all of whom are swift, rangy performers. There is still some question as to who will start at the three deep spots for the Irish. 
"The kids have done a real fine job," said Murphy. "They've been very intense in learning, and have drawn together as a team. We have had no problems." This , Murphy feels, is expecially encouraging in view of the fact that the team has had very little opportunity to practice together as a functioning unit. 
"We've spent most of our time in preparation work with the varsity," he explained. "Each week we run the offense of whoever the varsity is playing on Saturday against the first string defense. We try to simulate it as close as possible. Colors, numbers, everything." This preparation work' when coupled to the weekly scrimmage against the second and third string varsity players, indeed leaves the freshmen with very little time in which to work

The Irish Eye 

And a tip of the Leprachaun's hat to those wonderful people at 
Sports Illustrated who 'finally realized that there is a good football 
team roaming among the sycamores of northern Indiana. It was a 
real let down to find that Dan Jenkins didn't cover the ND-Mizzou 
game for Sl. He could have picked out numerous flaws that would 
make the Irish sound more like the third worst team in the country 
rather than uphold there Number Three ranking. 
With an open date on the Irish schedule, it's time to sit back and 
hope that a few more upsets can occur this weekend. It's highly 
unlikely that either of the teams in front of du Lac will fall to their 
opponents but possibly a bigger gap can be created for those teams 
that trail ND. 
Ohio State over Illinois: If the Buckeyes are going to lose this 
season it certainly won't be this weekend. Anything less than a 35 
point victory will be a moral win for the Illini. 
Northwestern over Purdue: The boilermakers have been hot· and 
cold all season. Even though they're due for a hot game this writer 
will stick with the ups:uging Wildcats who have won two Big Ten 
matches in a row. The game is at Evanston and that should help 
matters. 
Toledo over Kent State: The Rockets have shot into the Top 
Twenty rankings in both polls. They have the third leading defense 
and second longest win streak in the nation. They should get by 
troubled Kent State with little difficulty. 
Houston over Alabama: It's getting to the point where I almost 
feel sorry for the old Bear. 'Barna has played a tough schedule this 
season and it's possible that they may finish below .500 for the first 
time in many moons. LSU and Auburn are still on the Tide's 
schedule. 
LSU over Auburn: This is an upset of sorts. The Tigers from 
Auburn have been winning the big ones this season and the Tigers of 
the Bayou haven't played anyone of repute (sorry Aggie fans), but 
this is one of the few games LSU must get "up" for. 
Stanford over UCLA: The Bruins were involved in a controversial 
win last week what Dennis Dummit scored with four seconds left. 
Films showed that his knee hit before scoring against Cal. This week 
there will be no argument. If the UCLANs should win, the Pacific 
Eight will really be topsy turvy. · 
Southern Cal over Oregon: SC has just managed to get by a few 
opponents but they're due to break a game wide open, unless 
maybe they are saving something for Nov. 28. 
Arkansas over Texas A&M: The Aggies have been disappointing in the Southwest Conference so far. The Hogs may outscore them this week but wait until Thanksgiving when the Farmers play the only game on their scedule that really counts. 
Pitt over Miami(Fla.): The Number One team in the east will have a 6-1 record when they come to South Bend for Parents Weekend. My folks have never been to a circus. 
UPSET OF THE WEEK 
Minnesota over Michigan: In the battle for the Little Brown Jug it could be a sad .day in Ann Arbor. The Wolverines may have played themselves out against State. Besides the upset of the week has been 
pretty hot lately. 
In the other big games it looks like: Penn State over Army, West 
Virginia over Colorado State, Syracuse over Navy, North Carolina State over Maryland, North Carolina over Wake Forest, Duke over Clemson, Tennessee over Florida, Florida State over South Carolina, Georgia over Kentucky, Georgia Tech to get back in the win column against Tulane, Michigan State over Iowa, Indiana over Wisconsin, Nebraska over Oklahoma State, Oklahoma over Dansas State, Kansas over Iowa State, Mississippi over Vanderbilt, Texas over Rice, Texas Tech over SMU, Air Force over Boston College and Washington over Oregon State.

The report was entered in a sociological contest and "literal­ly walked away with three first place awards." 
The groups also have been working with Sr. Marita and her day school. They gave $1 ,000 to her, and have been "writing reports to submit to various organizations for her. We were considering sending one to the Ford Foundation, but it sometimes takes seven vears to get a reply, so we di_dn't." 

For a time, it appeared as though an Indian reservation would be the recipient of the Institute's efforts. "We thought we were going to start a reserva­tion, but that kind of fell through. We're working along the same Jines on a smaller scale for next year," explained Winings.

Metzger explained the various processes the Commission fol­lows in order to procure suitable speakers. The prime source of potential speakers is suggestions from the staff. Invitations are sent out to those people and when replies are received the commission evaluates them on the basis of their price, schedu­ling availability, experience, rele­vancy and interest. 
Other processes include going through speakers' bureaus, faculty and student recommen­dations. The same criterion are used to judge potential speakers obtained in this manner. Metzger stated that the Academic Com­mission was open to any sug­gestions the students might have.

Hawk, in his address to a sparse crowd in the Engineering Auditorium, also commented on the past successes and future plans of the peace movement. He said that the anti-war move­ment has been relatively success­ful, in that it has "put the ad­ministration on the defensive three times." He cited the resig­nation of former President Lyndon Johnson, the mora­torium movement of last fall, and the campus strike last spring as the major successes along this line. 
Mr. Hawk, who is now attend­ing a theological seminary in New York, also said that vio­lence is not an effective means of social change. Citing the over­whelming superiority of civilian and military police power, he ad­vised that it would be useless to fight militarily.
