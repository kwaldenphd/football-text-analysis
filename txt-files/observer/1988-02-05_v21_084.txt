BP, Cavanaugh collaborate to sponsor new talent show 
By DEANNA DOBROWOLSKI News Staff 
Breen-Phillips and Cavanaugh Halls are getting their act together, in the form of a campus-wide talent show. 
The two halls are co­sponsoring a talent show in an­swer to a request from the Drug and Alcohol Education Office for new and unusual ac­tivities. The office asked hall councils to come up with activ­ities that do not revolve around drinking. 
The office gives $500 in fin­ancial assistance to each dorm for special activities, said Cavanaugh president Chris Lee, adding that Breen-Phillips and Cavanaugh decided to combine their funds. Because the Drug and Alcohol Educa­tion Office is sponsoring the event, admission to the talent show will be free. 
Although the office is helping to support it, the show will be run entirely by students. The only stipulation is that the ac­tivity must provide only non­alcoholic beverages. The pro­duction will be organized mainly by the hall councils of Breen-Phillips and Cavanaugh. 
Breen-Phillips president Kathleen Maglicic said the in­itial response to the idea has been good. Although the dorm was the butt of many jokes in the Keenan Revue, Maglicic said the talent show is "not meant to make fun of Keenan.'' 

Maglicic said the show will include two categories of acts: musical talent and comedy. 
Monetary prizes will be given away, Maglicic said. Two first prizes of $125, two second prizes of $75, and two third prizes of $50 will be awarded. 
The show will be held March 5 at 7:30 p.m. in the Hesburgh Library auditorium. Seats will be available on a first-come, first-served basis, and doors will remain open until all the seats are filled, Lee said. 

reportedly broadcasts from El Salvador and is jammed in Managua. 
Ortega lobbied hard to end the funding. His campaign in­cluded restoring many lost rights in the last five months, courting visiting Democratic Congress members, and recently completing a European trip that included an audience with Pope John Paul II. 
Military analysts speculated the Contras could not survive more than a year without the food and weaponry airdropped to isolated, rugged regions by CIA-operated planes. The Con­tras have been most active lately in central Chontales and northern Zelaya provinces. 
They say they have up to 18,000 men under arms, al­though the Sandinistas put their strength at 6,000. 
There was little reaction to the news from Washington on the dusty streets of Managua, where Nicaraguans waited in lines to buy gas or board scarce buses. 

Donnelly, Oxrider chosen to manage The Observer 
By REGIS COCCIA Assistant News Editor 
Two Notre Dame students were appointed Thursday to the positions of managing editor and business manager of The Observer. 
Chris Donnelly and John Oxrider were chosen by the paper's editor-in-chief, Chris Murphy, as managing editor and business manager, respectively, for 1988-1989. 
Donnelly, a sophomore philosophy major, said he is excited about the upcoming year. "We've got a lot of new projects starting. The paper is really growing," he said. "It's a very good time, a time to build and keep im­proving on the paper." 
The Observer's new busi­ness manager, junior ac­counting major John Ox­rider, agrees. "I feel confident with the way our system is right now. We're going to keep it running smoothly," he said. "I'm really pleased with the op­portunity to work with The Observer.'' 
Donnelly, from South Bend, began working at The Observer as a freshman in

Cold and flu season: A problem everybody nose 
It starts as a tickle somewhere in the depths of your sinuses. You glance to the left. You glance to the right.Maybe you just imagined it. 
You know how it is.You go into class, prepared as always for a fun and exciting hour and fifteen minutes of intellectual stimulation. 
You sit down, intensely interested in what the professor has to say. Having read all the re­quired material and more for your own enrich­ment, you confidently open your notebook and click that ball point pen into the "on" position. Doctor Doom walks in, and a hush falls over the classroom. 
You try to ignore the tickle by concentrating on the fascinating lecture. But the tickle is turn­ing into a trickle. 
As you stare at the blackboard with unseeing eyes, a terrible dread begins to creep through your body. You cling to the hope that it is merely a false alarm, but as the old sinuses begin to churn and the pressure builds, you know your hope is but a pipe dream. 
The same word runs through your mind over and over: "KLEENEX . . . KLEENEX ... KLEENEX.'' Of course those soft, white, fluffy facial tissues are in your room right now doing I you absolutely, positively no good whatsoever. You have no choice but to sniff. Just once. That 
should do it. Twice. Accompanied by a brush of the hand. Alas! 'Tis not enough. The flood gates swing open; the dam breaks. If the people around you don't notice the sniffles, they'll certainly take note of the sweat you've just broken into. Great. Fantastic. 
Dread turns into panic as you frantically try every facial contortion in your repertoire to coax your honker into humility. Sniffles stretch into snorts ; students begin to turn around and frown at you with disdain. How dare you have the audacity to interrupt their intense concen­tration? 
In a last-ditch effort you tilt your head back, with the pretense of pondering some deep thought, praying that your last friend in the whole world won't desert you: gravity. But you're kidding yourself. No one admits friendship with a sniffler. Tilting your head is not enough, and you contemplate hanging by your heels from the ceiling. 
Ears popping, eyes watering, mind racing, and of course, nose running a marathon, you try to assume anonimity by slumping down in your seat and hiding behind your notebook. You sneak a peek at your watch and, horror of hor­rors, it is only ten minutes into the class! Oh, sorrow! Oh, misery! 
As you slouch in agony, shunned by all your peers, the professor requests that you leave the room and do something about your raucous probiscis. 
Humiliated, you make a nosedive for the door. Stumbling down the hall and into the bathroom, you grope for a wad of toilet paper. As you bury your nose in the white cloud, heavenly relief cascades over your entire being. 
An outcast, you find solace in your solitude, sniffling away. It wasn't your fault you were cursed with perpetual motion of the sinuses today. Then, a wicked thought pops into your head. You smile despite your post-nasal drip and laugh inwardly. This malady is bound to be contagious. 
It won't take long before the whole snooty class nose this is nothing to sneeze at.

Lawyers divided on 'surrogate'" 
Associated Press 
PHILADELPHIA -Efforts by legal and medical experts hoping to shape the future of surrogate motherhood on the heels of a New Jersey court's groundbreaking decision got bogged down quickly Thursday. 
Twenty-six participants in an American Bar Association con­ference aimed at drafting a model state law found they could not agree easily on an all­inclusive definition of sur­rogacy or on just what con­stitutes a "commercial" surrogate agreement. 
"We have two days to come up with something," said moderator Robert Arenstein, a New York City lawyer. "It's a big task." 
If the two-day conference can reach agreement, its proposal probably will be sent to the ABA's policy-making House of 
Copies

Delegates in August. If ap­
proved, the proposal would 
spark ABA lobbying efforts in 
state legislatures. 
Much of Thursday's discus­sion focused on the New Jersey Supreme Court ruling a day earlier in the widely publicized Baby M case. The state court said surrogate motherhood for money violates New Jersey's adoption laws. 
The decision ended a dra­matic legal fight between a wo­man artificially inseminated and the man whose sperm was used. They had signed a con­tract under which the woman would surrender all parental rights and would receive $10,000, but she later changed her mind. 
The New Jersey court ruled that the contract was illegal. 
"What we first have to decide is whether surrocacy should be prohibited under all circum­stances," said Gary Skoloff, the Livingston, N.J., lawyer who represents Baby M's fa­ther, William Stern, and his wife. 
Only one conference partici­pant, William Pierce of the Na­tional Committee for Adoption, supported a total ban on sur­rogate motherhood. 
Harold Cassidy, the Red Bank, N.J., lawyer represent­ing Baby M's surrogate mot­her, Mary Beth Whitehead­Gould, said surrogacy amounts to "forcing women through subtle inducements" to give up their children, an act that should only be a last resort. 
Dr. Michelle Harrison of Cambridge, Mass., explained that not all surrogacy cases are as clear cut as the Baby M case. Citing the transfer of an embryo from one woman to an­other, she asked, "Who is the mother? Is it the genetic or gestational mother?"

Nuclear power death-s studied 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -The Na­tional' Institute of Health has quiety initiated a study of can­cer deaths among populations near nuclear power plants, ac­cording to a letter released Thursday by Sen. Edward Ken­nedy. 
The letter, which was sent to the Massachusetts Democrat -from Dr. James Wyngaarden, director of NIH, said that the studies were started as a result of "leukemia clusters around the Pilgrim power plant in Massachusetts and several plants in the United Kingdom." 
The findings, said Wyngaar­den, "have led us to initiate a large-scale evaluation of can­cer deaths occurring among persons living near the over 100 
reactors  operating  in  the  
United States."  
Don  Ralbovsky,  a  NIH  

spokesman, acknowledged that the letter was sent on Jan. 28, but said Wyngaarden was out of town and others who could comment were not reachable. "We'll just have to stand on the letter," he said. 
In the letter, Wyngaarden said the NIH also is collaborat­ing in a Swedish study of 40,000 patients who have received low

Republican Bob Dole con­fronted chief opponent George Bush on Thursday, accusing the vice president of a cam­paign designed "to impugn my integrity" and demanding to know if Bush authorized an aide's harsh statement. 
The two met face to face on the Senate floor in a moment orchestrated by Dole following escalating tensions between their two presidential cam­paigns. 
Enjoying the GOP brawl, Democrat Bruce Babbitt ridiculed Dole from afar for leaving his vision of the future "locked in a blind trust."

Police disperse Poles·. during riot in protest over price increases 
Associated Press 
WARSAW, Poland -Police swinging clubs dispersed Solidarity supporters who protested price increases after a Mass on.Thursday, opposition sources said. Lech Walesa was at the church in Gdansk, but did not join the protest. 
"It was an unusually brutal action;" Joanna Wojciechowicz said. "Police beat people with clubs unusually severely ... It was a nightmare." 
Wojci~chowicz was a witness 
outside St. Brygida's Roman Catholic Church in the the Bal­tic port city, Walesa's hometown and birthplace of the now-outlawed free trade union movement. She said by tele­phone that police detained at least 10 people. 
Father Henryk Jankowski of St. Brygida's, one of Walesa's close advisers, said he would file a complaint about the police action. 
Thursday's protest was the second in Gdansk since the weekend, when the govern­ment announced price in­creases of 40 to 200 percent for most basic foods, fuel, alcohol, cigarettes, transportation and services. They are the steepest price hikes since 1982, when the country was under martial law. 
Police did not intervene Thursday when several thousand Solidarity supporters marched through Gdansk and chanted anti-government slogans outside the local Com­munist Party headquarters. 

Indianapolis Education Board accepts standardization of competency testing 
Associated Press 
INDIANAPOLIS -An esti­mated 31,270 pupils in five grades will have to take remedial work this summer after falling below a new stan­dard on statewide competency tests, according to Department of Education figures released Thursday. 
The State Board of Education approved on Thursday the cut­off scores that pupils in grades 1, 2, 3, 6 and 8 will have to exceed to avoid going through summer remedial work. 
The department also es­timates that 11,877 children could be retained in their pre­vious grade after failing to show enough improvement after remediation. 
Under the 1987 education reform law, children in the five grades, plus grades 9 and 11, will participate in the Indiana Statewide Testing for Educa­tional Progress program by taking exams in mathematics

CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. ­The launch of a "Star Wars" research satellite carrying 15 simulated Soviet nuclear mis­siles was postponed Thursday because of a potential problem with the Delta rocket, NASA said. 
The launch was not immedi­

Delta's second stage with five 
minutes to go in the countdown, 
the National Aeronautics and

"It has not been determined 

if it is a vehicle or a ground

spokesman Hugh Harris said. 
The mission calls for the 

Delta's second stage to go into

A new attitude toward drugs 
"Alcohol is a drug." . 
Most of us have heard this fact before, but who takes It seriously? 
Apparently the administration does. 
Today's dedication of the new Office of Alcohol and Drug Education marks another step in the administration's con­tinuing effort to deal with the problem of alcoh~l abu.se in our community. The administration has committed Itself to educating students and raising awareness of the dangers of alcohol misuse through policies, task forces and educa­tional programs. . . 
But unless student attitudes change, this effort Will go to waste. 
In an environment where alcohol is associated with fun times and release from the demands of school, it is difficult to treat alcohol for what it is --a potentially addictive drug. We need to learn to respect it as such. 
The cost of alcohol abuse is staggering. Nationally, it has been responsible for 23,000 highway deaths, 3,000 drownings and 9,000 suicides within one yea~. Alcohol­related highway deaths are the number one killer of 15­to 24-year-olds. At Notre Dame, two tragic alcohol-related deaths have made these statistics a grim reality. 
Another tragedy of which most of us are not aware con­tinues every day: Based on national estimates, we can project that 700 Notre Dame students are in the primary to advanced stages of alcoholism. 
In light of this, we cannot afford to continue treating alcohol use casually. Student attitudes which not only per­mit, but encourage, drinking to excess must be changed. We must work to recognize alcohol abuse in ourselves and others and take steps to deal with it. 
Whether we like it or not, the drinking habits which we form in college will affect us for the rest of our lives. It's time we started using this drug responsibly. 
The administration has shown that it takes the problem of alcohol misuse seriously; it is time for the students of Notre Dame to follow that lead.

P.O. Box Q 
Fanatacism has no use in debate 
Dear Editor: 

Mr. Hahn, in his Feb. 1 column, "Abortion issue needs rethinking," states that he wants "opinion forming thought" on the volatile topic of abor­tion. So do most people, but for this to occur hyperbole, incomplete analysis and callousness must be avoided. Mr. Hahn states that we are encountering "an atrocity comparable to tne Nazi holocaust." Over six million Jews died in Hitler's Germany. To equate any number of abortions with this ultimate expression of hate and bigotry is ridiculous. Remember, human beings die, not potential human beings. Fur­thermore, to infer a parallel between a Nazi and an abortionist is hypocritical and cruel. 
Mr. Hahn cited the decision of some doctors to selectively abort fetuses and commented--"How low has the medical profession sunk this time?" I will grant that this is a potentially unethical prac­tice, but if Mr. Hahn had explored the issue deeper he would have learned that in many instances the survival of any of the fetuses depends on the aborting of the others. 
Another difficulty with his article was the lack of discussion about a very im­portant person in any birth--the mother. Any analysis of this issue must involve the rights of women, to omit them evidences a sexist attitude which too often prevails on the Right to Life side. 
In any discussion of a controversial issue it is important to avoid fanatacism, but it is particularly vital on the abortion question. If the U.S. is to reach a concensus on this pressing issue we must do so after examing and respecting all sides with objectivity and compassion. 
Craig Gundersen Grace Hall February 3, 1988 
precipitated the legalization of abor­tion, was almost entirely overlooked (with the exception of a short and am­biguous pro-life quotation). I fail to un­derstand why Friday's or Monday's edition could not have featured at least a brief report on the NMMC Right to Life rally in the capital. Perhaps a few comments from spokesmen of both 
R.T.L. and N.O.W. (National Organiza­tion of Women) could have been printed. Each group has something to say, but we read nothing from either side. · 
On Jan. 22, 1973, the Supreme Court sparked a huge controversy that has become progressively more dynamic and intense. On Jan. 22, 1988, I would have enjoyed reading in our school newspaper a little bit about this monumentally important issue. I would have been interested to read about how different people are reacting to one of the most widely disputed decisions in the history of Constitutional interpreta­tion. 
Now, there lies a profound irony in all this. Humanity is subverted; human beings are expendable to the tune of about 1.5 million lives per year in this country. Simultaneously, however, animals are being elevated to the status of humanity. Last Friday, we read about some gallant cat that was trapped in the cargo hold of an aeroplane, journeyed several thousand miles, and was later rescued. "I love her so much," said the feline's joyfully sobbing owner of her pet, as the cat "nibbled on tuna, steak, and caviar." This animal was even "toasted with champagne." That's news? That's trivial. Think of how many rats and ver­min have seen the same kind of mileage in the storage compartments of ships and choo-choo trains. And they only get to eat moldy trash and industrial waste. No, it's not news, but it got the print. The newsworthy issue dido 't.

A Catcher in the Rye 
prince of darkenss as an agent of evil with a specific identity; yet in the Church's rite of Bap­tism, the exorcisms are milder than they used to be. The lie that the devil has spread in the 20th century America, so they say, is that he doesn't really exist. 
Father Robert Griffin 
Letters to a Lonely God 

Undergoing hypnotism as part of his therapy, the boy remembered attending a party where a naked woman did an erotic dance with a chicken. The mother's question was: were the weird events part of the worship carried on by a Satanic cult? 
Are witches and warlocks now holding their covens in the Windy City? It wouldn't be surprising to hear that black magic is being carried on as a pubilcity gimmick, or a cult favored by thrill-seekers, or as a game teenagers are playing to shock their parents. 
Does this mean that the devil is alive and well and working in Skokie? Based on the evidence I've heard, OI'Nick isn't going to get any testimonials as a activist from me. Does Beel­zebub exist as a personal enemy of God, out to ruin souls? On the question of Beel­zebub's existance, I'm an ag­nostic. The Gospels mention Beelzebub; is this purely myt­hological language, or a per­sonification of the spirit of evil? I'm open-minded, like a liberal Christian. 
The catholic Church ack­nowledges the existence of the 
I've never seen proof of the diabolism in the world; whether I see the devil or not, I'm sus­picious that he's around; not, however, because a naked wo­man does a dance with a chicken. But why should the devil come around, when he's got well-intentioned Christians to do his work for him? Why would God need archenemies who want to rival His authority? God must have His hands full, turning the crooked lines His friends draw into straight writing. 
Why bring this up? Because Notre Dame is a campus of exceptionally fine young people. Every student here has his or her special kind of truth and beauty, which awaits fulfill­ment. Each of us is partially fulfilled in the fulfillment of the others; none of us is an island. Each one is a child of the adoring Father, related as a sibling to the only-begotten Son. 
Does anyone feel short­changed when compared with others, as though he or she were lacking a necessary ad­vantage? That could be a stum­bling block, but it shouldn't terminally defeat us. Didn't Christ promise: "My grace is sufficient for thee?" What, then, could defeat us, to leave us losers? Nothing can cheat us of our fulfillment, if we resist believing the enticing lies. 
Adam and Eve believed an enticing lie. 01' Snake-hips in the garden, promised them: "You shall be as God." Wanting to be godlike, they brought misery on themselves. Their bad luck should be a warning to us: "Neep an eye on those angels of light, flattering you with what you most want to hear. A number of those angels of light may be in the devil's camp, without even knowing it." 
I offer you a warning: season everything you read or hear-­including this column--with a grain of salt. Season any gospel of liberation that is preached to you--no matter how Christian it sounds--with a grain of salt. Religion used to represent a body of doctrine that the faithful had agreed to agree on; but that was before the silly seasons started. 
Do the preachers seem in love with love? "By their fruits, you shall know them," said the Lord. The tree of love can bear bitter fruit. 
Is the 20th century the cruel­lest of all centuries? The cream of the crop of two generations perished in the great world wars, and every decade produces a fresh genocide. 
Now, in the Eighties, when America has no war of its own to fight, what new headcounts of death are we keeping, and what are the battlecries that ease us towards the cults of death? The young and the wise need to be wise in their own defense. 
Like Holden caufield, I dream of being a catcher in the rye, saving the children playing in a field of rye from falling over the edge of a cliff. His vision of himself as a catcher in the rye means that he wants to save them from their loss of innocence 
Dennis Tillman is a black student I like and admire very much. Tuesday, reading his Observer column, I had ques­tions to ask him as a catcher in the rye. He acknowledges the vicious circle of the Admissions Office recruiting black students to a Notre Dame where they will feel out of place. 
I've been aware for years of this kind of problem. Nearly 20 years ago, a number of stu­dents came here from the black neighborhoods of Chicago. Among them was Greg, an angry young man, who made no bones about his dislike for Notre Dame. 
The recruiters, he said, came to his ghetto, asking: "How would you like to be a Notre Dame freshman?" "''d never heard of Notre Dame," Greg said. "But they brought me here to see the place, for a weekend of partying. I decided: why not go, to get away from the streets for a year? When I came, I didn't see no more partying. It was just a white boys' school, and it wasn't for me." 
Greg put up with the place 
for one semester. His class­
mate Chris, winner of the first 
Martin Luther King scholarship, 
was as charming as Greg as 
surly. He was gifted, sensitive, 
and highly intelligent; I found 
out a lot about him, because 
he invited me to read his jour­
nal. He had been accepted at Harvard; but he came to Notre 
Dame because his brother, an 
ND graduate in love with the 
place, asked him to. 
By October, Chris had stopped going to classes. When he came back after Christmas, he had no grade point average because he hadn't taken any finals. His indifference to the place had nothing to do with the color of his skin; he couldn't have had more friends if he had won the Heisman trophy. But he hated the drab­ness of life in the dorms, and he kept eating his heart out because he wasn't at Harvard. 
My questions to Dennis are: why would blacks want to at­tend Notre Dame if other blacks told them they should stay away? How, in conscience, could I encourage them to en­roll, if I suspected that they might be unhappy here? 
Do other prestigious schools have a much larger percentage of blacks in attendance, and a larger number of black teach­ers on the faculty? 
None of these questions change the truth or forceful­ness of what Dennis wrote; but after twenty years, I want him to say more than that blacks have felt uncomfortable on campus. 
If we treat the blacks here now as part of the family, maybe their children and their children's children will be in love with the place. 
As Jesse Jackson says of himself, Notre Dame isn't per­fect, but God hasn't finished with it yet. May the devil and his angels of light stay away from out door, but may the Dennis Tillmans always bear witness. 

~ clock-radio, tuned to a 1" l:hicago station, awoke me this morning: the radio-host was reading from Mike Royko's column in the Chicago Tribune. Royko quoted from a letter written by a mother about her teenager, who has been acting strangely. 

The Observei1Jim Brake Dave Dannison, director of the Office of Alcohol and Drug Education which is being dedicated today. 
He said the office would be targeted in these six basic areas: 1)getting information to as many people as possible so that they might be able to see alcohol as a problem or poten­tial problem in their lives. 2)having information sessions and materials in dorms. 3)helping people do research on alcohol for papers and per­sonal reference. 4)meeting with rectors to help support them through in­stances where alcohol might be an issue. 5)promoting social activities which condone responsible or non-drinking activities. 
6)providing a setting where students concerned about alco­hol and drugs in thier lives or the lives of others can come and air their concerns. 
Sally Coleman, alcohol coun­selor at the University Counsel­ing Center is quite exicited about the office: "It's an oppor­tunity to start learning about the people we want to be in society and how chemicals do or do not fit into those roles." 
This is the fifth and final story in a series of articles on alcohol education at Notre Dame. 

Alcohol and leadership 
TAMRYN ETTEN accent writer 

}\ lcohol "education"--that nsounds like another subtle way for the University to tell you to stop drinking. Right? 
Wrong. 
"AlCohol education is to help you know more generally about alcohol and its role for you as a leader," said Dave Dannison, Director of the Office of Alcohol and Drug Education af Notre Dame which is having its dedication ceremony at 4:30 this afternoon. 
"We're training leaders here at Notre Dame, "he said. "Ones who should be able to conquer problems, and alcohol is as large a single social problem as any other in society." 
"If you don't know about al­cohol, you don't know about the area over which you'll have to make decisions." 
Alcohol leads 10 percent of its users to addiction, while 70 to 80 percent of the American population chooses to drink. Recent evidence has shown that this addiction can be hereditary. 
Children of alcoholics, as well as undergoing emotional problems because of their par­ents addictions, are four times as likely to develop an alcohol problem then their peers. A general genetic influence (for instance through siblings or grandparents) is identifiable in 35 to 40 percent of alcohol abusers, both men and wo­men. 
These statics imply that al­coholism is a disease--a status that the American Medical As­sociation gave it 22 years ago. Treating alcoholism as a dis­ease is much different than treating it as a lack of wil­lpower on the addicts part. 
"Will power is a bankrupt ideal in terms of alcohol. A lot of alcoholics think they can stop drinking if they have enough will power," said Dan­nison. "Will power may get them through tomorrow, but it won't get them through 1993." 
The "cure" is just as illusive as the disease. 
This is something that is cru­cial for the alcohol educator to teach. "If you give them good information," said Barbara Naser, executive director of the South Bend Alcoholism Coun­cil, "then they are able to watch their behavior closely" to see if they are developing any 
symptoms of alcohol depen­
dence. 
"It's ·like cancer. People are learning earlier and earlier what to look for." 
Naser said alcohol without 

education is like giving a 
loaded gun to a child and not 
telling him about the dangers 
involved with it. 
She said that in the South Bend community, they are starting to educate children as early as grade school. A recent ·survey taken by the National Council on Alcoholism showed that only 42 percent of the na­tion's fourth graders were aware that alcohol was an a drug (and therefore addictive) while 81 percent considered marijuana one. 
The Office of Alcohol and Drug Education at Notre Dame, will not be educating fourth graders, but college students -­mostly people who have been exposed to just as little infor­mation concerning the drug. 
"The main goal (of the office) will be to provide a resource center to help students access information to loosen the grip of alcohol in a person's life," said Dannison.

"No Way Out" (1987) is a steamy murder mystery pitting Kevin Costner's handsome Navy Lieutenant against Gene Hackman's sleazy Secretary of Defense in a race against the clock to uncover a spy in the Defense Department. The search for the spy is in actual­ity a smoke screen to cover up Hackman's accidental killing of his mistress (Sean Young) who, coincidentally, was Costner's lover. Costner becomes the prey in this thrilling cat-and­mouse game that will keep you on the edge of you sofa (HBO Video, rated R. 116 minutes, $89.95).

Devils

not the same squad that began the season 12-0 and ranked as high as ninth. Junior forward Katie Meier injured her knee in a Jan. 9 game against Maryland. The Blue Devils went on to lose that contest and three of their next four without their all-American before she returned against North Carolina last week. Duke lost that contest by a point and has split its last two games, beating Georgia Tech 80-71 last weekend and losing 78-65 at Monday night at Clemson. 
Meier averages 16.0 points per game and 6.6 rebounds, while handing out 70 assists for the season. The big gun for Debbie Leonard's squad is Blue Devils is all-America forward Chris Moreland. The 6-1 senior averages 18.9 points per game and 12.2 rebounds per contest. 
Rounding out the Blue Devil lineup is forward Paula Ander­son (9.2 points per game, 4.3 rebounds, team-leading 74 as­sists), center Sue Harnett (14.0 ppg, 8.4 rpg) and guard Leigh Morgan (5.8 ppg, 2.0, 73 as­sists). 
"Duke is a lot like us," McGraw said of the Blue Demons. "They have a very strong inside game, good guards, and not a lot of bench strength." 
McGraw added that to counter the Blue Devils inside game, the Irish would "definitely" play some zone defenses. 
After a night's · sleep and a second look at the stats, McGraw said she felt a little better about her squad's disap­pointing loss to Tennessee. "Looking at the stat sheet, we played our normal game," McGraw said. "We didn't rebound as well. Seventy points should be enough to win a game, but we didn't play good defense. We're getting some good shots, but we're not get­ting enough of them."

Bullets great, coach Unseld tops Hall of Fame inductees 
Associated Press 
SPRINGFIELD, Mass. -Wes Unseld, the first year he was up for election, Clyde Lovel­lette and Oregon State Coach Ralph Miller were named to the Basketball Hall of Fame Thursday. 
A fourth man whose election was announced was the late Bobby McDermott, who dropped out of high school to star in the pros in the 1930s. 
Although Unseld made it in his first try, the Honors Com­mittee passed over his flashier former teammate Earl Monroe for a second consecutive year. 
"I wasn't flashy and I never played pcetty," said Unseld, who last month became head coach of the Washington Bul­lets in the NBA. "My contribu­tions were in the things most people don't notice. They weren't in high scoring or dunking or behind-the-back passes." 
But during his 13-year playing career with the Bullets, the 6-foot-9· Unseld, who also played center on his high school football team and won the Ken­tucky state high school shot put championship, averaged 14 rebounds and 10.8 points in 984 games and led the Bullets to the 1978 NBA title. 
His impact on the Bullets was immediate. A first-round draft pick, who had averaged 19 rebounds and 20 points a game at the University of Louisville, Unseld was named the NBA's Most Valuable Player as well as Rookie of the Year in 1969. The only other player to gain both honors was Wilt Chamber­lain. 
Following his retirement, Unseld was named vice presi­dent of the Bullets in 1981. He began this season as an assis­tant coach. 
Unseld was surprised that Monroe again failed to win election. "If anybody in his era revolutionized the game it was Earl. We have Michael Jordan and Magic Johnson now, but he was the one who set the stan­dard for that type of play,'' U n­seld said. 
Lovellette, who ushered in the era of the high-scoring big center in the early 1950s at the University of Kansas, said he also had felt ignored by the Hall of Fame. 
"It seems somewhat overdue. I used to read about guys who came after me get­ting elected, and it sort of made me wonder. But I'm just glad it happened, before I passed away," said Lovellette, in a telephone interview between classes at White's Institute in Wabash, Ind., where he teaches teen-agers who have been in trouble with the law. 
After leading Kansas to the NCAA championship in 1952 and the U.S. Olympic team to the gold medal in Helsinki, he averaged 17 points a game in an 11-year professional career with the Minneapolis Lakers, Cincinati, St. Louis and the Boston Celtics. 
After his retirement from the Celtics, Lovellette worked as a television sports director, sheriff of Vigo County, Ind., director of a nursing home in Illinois, owned an antique shop on Cape Cod and coached at St. Anthony's High School in New Bedford, Mass. 
Miller is the winningest ac­tive coach in Division I. 
"I think anybody who goes into coaching hopes some day he might be elected and I'm just as happy as can be," said Miller, who prior to Thursday night's game with the Univer­sity of Southern California had amassed a 642-358 record in 37 years of college coaching.

Irish sophomore 
Winter~s over for Robinson 
By DENNIS CORRIGAN Sports Editor 
You could say that Keith Robinson is used to the winters. Robinson is a native of one of the few places in the country with worse winters than South Bend--Buffalo, N.Y. Robinson remembers schools closing for days at a time and games being cancelled. 
But last year, the sophomore experienced a different kind of winter. Robinson was ineligible to play basketball last year un­der the provisions of NCAA Bylaw 5-1-(j). As the Irish went on to post upsets of North Carolina, Duke, DePaul and eventually end their season in the Final 16, Robinson could only watch and try to stay in shape.

"Shumate's  a  good  coach  

"Last year I worked out a lot in the weight room," Robinson says. "I did a lot of playing at the Rock with some of the stu­dents. I couldn't just sit back and sit out without trying to stay in shape. I just did a lot of playing and working out. 
"It feels good to be back with the team after sitting out last year. It was rough on me." 
But when spring came Rob­inson was eligible to join his teammates on their trip to Yugoslavia. Itwas his first shot to show his coaches what he could do. But for Robinson, bas­ketball was secondary to the experience of going out of the country. 
"It was an experience for me to go there and see a different lifestyle," Robinson says. "It was a chance for me to go out of the country for the first time, meet different people and see how they live. The competition was good because the players were older and had more expe­rience. Basketball was second­ary because we didn't have to practice, just play in the games." 
But when Robinson came back for his sophomore year, he found that the carefree days were over. Robinson became a key player off the bench for the Irish almost at once. But it was clear that the layoff had hurt him. He showed flashE>j of bril­liance inside but also made many errors, especially put­ting the ball on the floor when inside. More often than not, that led to turnovers. 
"In beginning of the season I needed to work on my defense," Robinson says of his

The Irish beat both Nor­thern Illinois and Southern Illinois in a tri-match last weekend to move their record to 3-0. 
Freshman Ryan Wenger remains undefeated at the number-three position, as does senior captain Dan Walsh at the number-four spot.

game. "My scoring will come as I get more comfortable. I still have the same high school habit of putting the ball on the floor without knowing where my man is. I take one dribble for no reason and I usually get caught up. I'm on a different level than I was in high school." 
But the Irish have one of tve best big man coaches in the 
working with the big men," Robinson says. "He teaches us inside moves, ways to guard people in the post. He has ex­perience in the pros and here." 
While still in the early part of the season, Robinson expe­rienced . one of the loneliest feelings in basketball. He was at the foul line on the road at DePaul with a chance to seal a win in the nationally-televised game. He missed two shots, and the Irish went on to lose the game in overtime. 
"When I went to the line," Robinson remembers, "I thought I could make one at least one of those two free throws and it didn't happen." After the game I was down on myself because I could have won the game. Coach Phelps carne over and told me it was an experience for me and every college player has experienced those things. I felt bad for a couple of days before I got over 
it., But shortly after that disap­pointment, Robinson returned to Buffalo, where he was

named Mr. Basketball in the state of New York while a senior at Grover Cleveland High School, and the fans there were eager to see their former prep star. A crowd 'of 13,558, the first sell-out for a college game in Buffalo, was on hand at Buffalo's Memorial Auditorium as Notre Dame took on St. Bonaventure. Rob­inson got his first start of the season and responded with a game-high 15 points in a 64-49 Irish win. 
"It was a big homecoming," Robinson recalls. "There were a lot of relatives and friends there to watch me play. That was one of the things I was looking forward to when I was able to play. I wanted to go home and play in front of my friends and family. It was just fun because everybody that I knew was there." 
Now Robinson has become Notre Dame's leading rebounder with 131 boards, 45 off the offensive glass. His 7.3 rebounds per game average is more impressive when you con­sider he averages 24 minutes a game. That along with his 9.1 points per game have made him a solid factor off the Irish bench. 
Robinson is philosophical about his future. 
"Every basketball player's dream is to play in the NBA, and that's what I'm striving for now," Robinson notes. "Whatever happens after that happens. I may go into business or whatever I'm comfortable with."
