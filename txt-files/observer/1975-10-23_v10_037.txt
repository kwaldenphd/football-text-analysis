Everything is set to start the membership drive for the food co­op according to Tom Fitzgerald, student body vice-president. 
Membership in the off-campus co-{)p will cost $25 per household. 
Fitzgerald said sign-ups for the CO-{)p will be at the end of next. week. Students who paid two dollars last spring toward this year's l'O-{)P can have their money refunded at this time. 
Eileen Margowsky, who has had experience in organizing CO-{)ps will speak on campus early next week to explain and answer questions about the CO-{)p for potential members. 
Fitzgerald said he does not yet know where the talk will be held. 
"We're going on the approach that this will go well and bring in members." Fitzgerald remarked. "If nobody comes to the talk, there will be little chance of people signing up." 
Encourages Attendance 
He added, "I encourage them to come to the speech to ask questions and make up their own minds." 
l<'itzgerald explained Margowsky will function as an adviser to the off-campus ro-{)p. A board of directors chosen by the members will actually run the CO-{)p. 
l<'itzgerald also said the Marketing Department is conducting a preliminary survey on what foodsmight be desired for the CO-{)p. "This has been a lot of help," he observed, "and it is fine for ideas. but the final decision will be made bytheco-{)p embers." 
Student Body President Ed Byrne said the location for the CO-{)p has been narrowed down to two places, but he did not name them specifically. 
"It depends on the number of members," Byrne pointed out. 
"I think the board of directors will choose the place'.' 
i''itzgerald emphasized the per household membership fee will be sellable and will be goodfor "not only no'w but for upcoming years." 
Success Doubted 
Father Thomas Tallarida, director of off-campus housing, said he does not think themembership rlrive will be successful. 
"A lot of kids are still asking how they can get their two dollars back," he stated," and quite a few are wondering if they will save any money at the CO-{)p." 
Tom Kruczek, who paid two dollars toward membership in the so­op last spring, said he will try to get his money back. "I wouldn't join it now,", he said, "but it's a good deal for off­campus students." 
.Jim Swartz also said he will try to get his two dollars refunded. 
"It must have been poorly planned and disorganized last semester." he remarked. "It couldn't have been looked into that well." 
"So many people have put so much time into the CO-{)p, it will be disappointing for me if there is a lack of interest." Byrne com­meoted, "because there was so much interest two years ago when the work was first started. 
University Village needs improvements 
by John Calcutt Staff Heporter 
University Village residents cit­l'd cases of deterioration of their facilities and again voiced a need for housing improvements on Wednesday. 
Last March, The Observer published an article in which Fr. Joseph Payne, the University Village chaplain, expressed the suggestions and complaints of­many of the residents of the married student complex. 
Although the University ex­plained their position in this matter tothecomm it tee on residentiality, little apparent action was taken. 
The most important deficiencies of the University Village complex are still the lack of. adequate storage space and a need for better heat distribution. 
Hesponding to these problems, Brother Kieran Ryan, Assistant Vice-President for Business Affairs stated, "We in­stalled bicycle racks for the bicycles ana tricycles for the kids, but the heating problem is out of our hands." 
He commented, "Those apart­ments have the same blueprints as the ones downtown, so there couldn't be that much wrong structurally that would cause heat loss." 
Many residents disagreed. They commented, "We don't have enough storage space for things like strollers which are necessary with kids." 
Several examples of the poor­facilities were cited by residents. One stated, "The apartment ,are poorly insulated, which leads to higher electric bills for those people living on the ground rioor ,"not to\mention the higher noise level." 
One incident cited by a tenant was that of a family living on the ground level who paid twice as much for heat when they left their apartment vacant over the 
Christmas vacation than the 
familyabove them who remained 
in the Village for the holiday. 
Last May, a small child was climbing on the 5 foot fence surrounding the apartments and was gashed by the barbs on the top to the extent of needing several stiches to close the wounds. 
"We wanted to have the barbs 
fixed to protect our kids," one 
resident commented, "because the 
fence really doesn't keep anybody 
out. But the university wouldn't do 
a thing. I guess they <the ad­
ministration) didn't realize that a 
kid getting gashed was serious." 
Another resident noted,

The world food shortage and garbage were the two topics of discussion at the second session of the three-day Energy Conference in Washington Hall last night. 
The  speakers  for  the  evening  
were  Dr.  Herrell  DeGraff,  of  
Cornell University,  on  "Human  

I<:nergy," and Dr. James Abert, Director of the National Center for Hesource Recovery, on "Heclaimed Resources." 
DeGraff spoke first, focusing on agriculture and the world food situation as the prime components of human energy. DeGraff is a former Babcock professor of Food Economics at Cornell University. 
DeGraff began by pointing to the "food crunch" which has affected a large number of Americans during the past three years. He said this is really not a food stor­tage, but rather is caused by higher prices. 
According to DeGraff, higher prices are due to the increase in exports to foreign countries, and l'Utbacks in livestock production. 
Worlrlwirlt' rood shortagt' 
The American food shortage is a reflection of the tightened food situation in the world. Degraff stated that the exact same things are happening in Europe, Canada, .Japan. and other nations around the globe. 
A partial reason for the world­wide shortage is adverse weather that has occurred for the past several years, the food economist stated. This has limited harvests in a number of foreign countries, forcing them to rely on imports, a 
large number of which are provided by the United States. 
Three reasons mentioned by DeGraff explaining the recent increase in imports of American agricultural products by foreign nations were: <1l the rising af­fluence of developing nations over the past two decades; (2) an at­tempt on the part of the newly affluent members of these coun­tries to improve their diets by incorporating certain foods into the. such as fat, sugar, and animal products. 
The third reason was the devaluation of the American dollar in 1972, which meant developing nations could purchase American goods and agricultural products at comparatively lower prices. 
DeGraff said all of these factors have increased exports which have begun to affect our reserves of grains and other farm products. 
World ag1·iculture 
Leaving the Amencan agricultural scene, DeGraff spoke of the advances being made in world agriculture. He said that the agricultural production of the world has increased by about 30 percent in the past ten years. 
He compared the amount of protein available to persons in developed and under-developed nations. The figure for developed nations is 89 grams of protein per pPrson per day. For under­developed nations, the figure is 63 grams per person per day. The recommended daily requirement of protein, according to both U.S. and United Nations agencies, 'is about 65 grams per day. 
DeGraff said these figures did not represent a tack of hunger in 
(continued on page 4 the world; rather, they demon­
strated that 16 percent of the world's total population, or 460 million people, have caloric and protein supplies below recom­llH'nded amounts. 
DeGraff emphasized that the so­called Green Revolution, which has provided high-yield varieties of seeds to under-developed nations, is not enough to t>nd the food shortage. 
lie pointed to the fact that many of these strains are not resistant to disease or insects. He also said that what is needed in many eountries is good soil, water, fertilizers. and pest control, in adrlition to new strains of crops. 
He also spoke of the drawbacks to American agriculture. He said that in the past 15 years America has not kept pace with its former agricultural research. 
·other major disadvantages, especially in light of the recent energy crisis.. are in the use of fertilizers and pesticides made from natural gas, or with petro­chemical bases. 
DeGraff pointed to the fact that American agriculture is entirely mechanized, requiring large amounts of fossils fuels to operate these machines. 
"We've suddenly awakened to 
the fact that our supplies of these 
fuels are finite," he concluded. 
DeGraff did not offer any con­
crete answers to the questions he 
posed. as he preferred to have the 
audience offer their own answers 
at the end of the evening's 
presentation. 
Garbagl• 
Abert, who was the second speaker for the evening, began his talk by saying, "My subject tonight is garbage. Sometimes I think I'm an overeducated gar­bageman." 
He utilized a slide presentation to illustrate his topic of resource recoverv. 
Abert said one of the solutions to the garbage problem in America today is to use waste as a raw material for the production of t>nergy. Anotehr use is to recyclE' certain components of garbage, such as aluminum, paper, and copper. 
The presentation focused on a number of centers around the country which are using waste materials in a variety of methods to generate heat. There are three general methods, Abert said, which are burniing, chemical conversion, and biological c conversion (com posting). 
One pound of raw, unprocessed refuse has half the amount of BTUs as a pound of coal, according to Abert. With relatively simple processing of the refuse, such as removing the metals, and shredding the material, it is possible to obtain a higher amount of BTUs. 
Another product of garbage is 
oil. Abert said. A high energy, but 
low quality oil can be produced 
with technology available today, 
he stated. 
Abert stressed that the 
technology is available for a great 
variety of resource recovery 
methods. "We're moved beyond 
the drawing board stage," he said. 
Thz only difficulty now are in­
stitutional problems, such as the 
amount of capital available to 
companies to use the technology. 
~'ollowing the presentations, co-discussantsDr. Daniel Winicur, assistant Professor of Chemistry, and AI Sondej, of the Notre Dame World Hunger Coalition, played an active role in a discussion between the speakers and the audience, which covered a wide range of topics.

Public life for Nixon in future 
LOS ANGELES <AP) -For­mer President Richard M. Nix­on may be planning a gradual re-entry into public life, a tele­vision producer who visited Nixon said Wednesday. 
Nixon, who recently played in a Teamsters charity golf tour­nament, spent an hour Monday with television producer-colum­nist Wally George and ap­peared at other golf courses near his seaside estate at San Clemente. 
In the semipublic golfing ap­pearances, Nixon has been de­scribed as affable and friendly. 
George, who wrote a news­paper column defending Nixon, said the former President told him he made "stupid mistake" in the Watergate affair but no worse than other presidents have made.

the  news  media,  who  Nixon  
said  "built  this  into  a  federal

Nixon has been largely recl­usive in his seaside estate that once served as the Western White House. But George said Nixon plans to spend more time in public, beginning in about six months when his book and a series of televison interviews are completed. 
"He said he'd like to visit several countries that he has visited in the past," said George. He said Nixon might get involved in radio and tele­vision or "wherever I can be of help to the country." 
"He looks excellent," said George. "He stands erect, is very clear-eyed and forceful in his speech. He looks like he has gained weight and is very much in fighting form, very happy and relaxed."

Glickstein letter 
Link won't debate Law School criticism 
by ('hristit' llt'rlihy Staff Ht'porter 
David Link, dean of the Notre Dame Law School, has refused to debate the unfavorable Howard Glickstein letter which sharply criticized the law school. 
"Although I have evidence to 
supportmy view and I will ~iscuss the issue with students, I feel it not proper to make a public point-by­point criticism of the letter," the dean said. "The letter is not worth debating although the issues which it raises are wor..th talking about." 
Link decined to publicly attack the Oct. Gletter because Glickstein addressed the letter to the law students and did not send Link a copy. The letter arrived after Glickstein left Notre Dame for a full-time teaching postion at Howard Law School. 
Glickstein, former director of the Civil Rights l'cnter and professor at the Notre Dame Law School from 1973 to 1975, criticized the school on three accounts: the lack of pervading Catholic character which the school claims to have, the fostering of an en­vironment hostile to public interest law, and the emphasis on presenting fixed technical in­tormation rather than encouraging creative thinking. 
Hl.'futl.'s claim 
Although a non-Catholic, Glickstein believes there is little substance to the law school's claim that it "is unique becuase it is Catholic and humanistic". Despite the crucifixes in the classrooms, occasional prayers before class, and profession by most faculty and students to be Catholic, there is not a ''constant struggle to harmonize the legal with the ethical and moral" according to Glickstein. 
"I disagree with Glickstein's attitude attitude towards the law school." Link stressed. "He was so far off base on details, actually wrong in our views of the curriculum and value orien­tation." 
Link said,he and Glickstein basically held the same goals forte law school: "I believe that we need to concern ourselves with the Catholic character of the school as we already have." 
Link said he was appointed law school dean by Fr. Hesburgh because he felt "strongly about 
Touhy, Thomas to square off 
The tickets of Hilaire Thomas and Terry Touhy will square off again in final elections for St. Mary's Freshman class officersthis Friday.

value-oriented curriculum and was concerned wit~ its Catholic character. Glickstein knows how I feel about this; I am just as concerned a~ut these issues as he is." 
Nl't•d for humanism 
The character of the Jaw school involves an overall objective which Link feels the school has in mind but yet has not reached. Society needs "lawyers with a concept of humanism-lawyers who treat a client as a person and yet still remain professionals," Link said. 
"I think that Watergate points to the real need for humanism in law," said Link. "It was an example of those whose primary responsibility was in representing 'themselves for loose political in­terests." 
"And when you examine their backgmunds it is not amazing the way in which they behaved. Their attitudes are reflected in their schooling," Link asserted. 
Glickstein has also attacked the law school saying that the at­mosphere was "hostile to public law" citing a core curriculull' which teaches students how they can make money" while " little attention is paid to how the system must be changed to achieve greater equity in society." 
·'There definitely is no lack of public law courses in our curriculum,"replied Link. "And Glickstein knows that." 
Link said that according to the American Bar Association statistics, more Notre Dame graduates enter major public law fields -such as government and public-interest-related work, than Harvard, or Michigan law schools. 
Nl'w law program 
To further the humanistiC ap­proach to law, the school will start 11 new program: "Problem Methods in a Client Environment," Link said. This method which will be employed in allthird-year t·ourses will address itself to viewing the human side of law. Abstract legal practice will be viewed as "people problems." 
The implementation of the new method 'Prompted Link to say that, "Glickstein is working with old information." 
Glickstein admitted that the law school "offers a number of wor­thwhile clinical and 'problem­solving'expriences." He praised the foreign study program for "adding depth to the curriculum." 
Law students ha-ve the op­portunity to act as legal interns for National Center for the Law and 
ihe Handicapped as well as the Civil Rights Center. Recently the school -received a grant of $54,960 from the NCLH to expand the legal internship programs. 
A clinically-oriented local government-course allows second and third-year students to work with South Bend government. 
lntl.'rnationa I law 
The international law study 
' program is expanding, Link said. The Law Advisory Council is 11ssisting in developing a Master of Laws program which will provide a concentrated one-year program in international law. In addition to the existing London study porgram, the school plans to reinstitute the Japan program, which was discontinued last summer, and to start a Latin American program based inChile. Glickstein, however, said ·the school transmits a "fixed body of knowledge" and produces "commonplace technicians rather than creative professionals." ''The law school places entirely too much empasis on what the law is ... Where I think the emphasis must be is on what the law school be,". Glickstein asserted. Link said the increased tendency towards a humanistic approach will allow the student to develop a 
value-system. all three years." 
"We want to provide that op­Asked if he felt that the Notre portunity. The approach that we Dame Law School emphasized are taking towards the third-year business-oriented law, the dean program has a lot to do with that. .said: "It is as necessary to train But this is only a beginning," Link a business lawyer in these values stated. "It will have to permeate :ts a public-interest lawyer.

Friday's pep rally for the USC game ranks as the most important of the season in the minds of most students. Various reasons were given in a sampling of students telephoned yesterday by the Ob­server. 
· • After taking the whole week in context--the problems, the rumors about the players and coaches, this one has to be more important than the others," said Bill Bracken, Flanner RA. 
Cheerleading captain Mary Ann Grabavoy said that in theory this rally shouldn't be more important, but was needed as a unifying ac­tion. "At Notre Dame spirit is a unifying element, and is the basis of the whole ND community," she said. 
Sophomore Maureen Walsh felt the rally was definitely needed for USC even if the team doesn't perform well during the actual game. 
Robert O'Brien, University band director, felt that all the rallies and the games were equally important. 
"Every team that comes here to play puts Notre Dame in the same category as a bowl game," he commented. "They are up for the game and always on their toes. We can't rest." 
Fullback Jim Browner admitted he is never really psyched up for a game until the opposing team takes the field. Browner felt three or four main ralles were needed throughout the year, one in­troducing the players, one before each big game, and one before a bowl game. 
Defensive end Gene Smith disagrees. Rallies for him aren't routine. 
"With different speakers each time, you can find out how these
.) 
people really are and what's on their mind," he said. 
Smith continued that the spirit of the rally was something that hangs in the air. "The timing is right. It's just before all the players are alone. Lots of time on the walk over to Moreau I think about the people I'm playing for. It gives m~ a whole new value of the game," he noted. 
Cheerleader Andy Praschak felt that because of the way games are scheduled, each rally is im-

portant. "If we beat USC, it could mean a bowl bid," he commented. "Northwestern is important because it's usually the first home game. MSU is important because of the rivalry."' 
Bracken feels that rallies grow in importance as the time goes on. "Because this is our last year the USC and probably the Georgia Tech rallies will be the most im­portant ones this year." 
O'Brien commented that the band's role in rallies was a con­tinuous one. "The march around campus has been a tradition for years. Our job doesn't end after the rally, though," O'Brien ex­plained. "Win or lose, the band plays for the team in the locker room after the game." 
The band's job is to express musically the feelings of the people, O'Brien said. It is in­teresting to note that two students, non-band members, composed the Fight Song. 
Junior Colleen McCarthy felt that pep rallies in general were a fake way of rousing emotions, at least as far as her own were concerned. "I prefer to get excited 
Improvements are still needed 
(continued from page 1) 
"Many of the rooms need paining or have wall paper coming off the walls, but they won't let us paint the rooms ourselves." 
"When they fixed the leaky roof this summer, they didn't bother to work on the apartments that were runined by the water leakage," sheadded. 
Ryan responded to these criticisms stating, "The basic philosophy behind University Village was to provide reasonably priced apartment forNotre Dame students." 
"It's true they <the apartments) 
lack certain conveniences, but 
what do the students expect for $80 
a month. They can always move 
downtown if they don't like it," he 
said. 
One tenant summed the entire 
Universiy Village feeling up when 
he said, "We like the convenience 
of being close to campus,and we 
like the low rent. But there are just 
some things that need to be done." 
, : ""' 
during the game; I don't seem to need that pre-game life," she said. 
Walsh admitted that she did not attend every rally last year because they seemed to become stale to her after a while. "This year I've been to every one," Walsh said. 
Grabavoy admitted that it is hard sometimes to keep herself mentally psyched. "It takes a lot out of me physically, but maybe even more mentally," Grabavoy explained. "It's a drain, especially during basketball season because it's long." 
Freshman Dom Narducci said he gets psyched every time the fight song is played. "My father is an ND grad, I grew up with ND all my life," Narducci admitted, "but every time I hear it, it becomes a whole new experience for me." 
Band drum captain Mark Augustine said that "sometimes it's a pain, but really it is a lot of fun getting ready for a rally." Augustine added that he would rather be in the band than in the crowd. 
McCarthy summed up the consensus by saying that some people really like the rallies, others don't. "Some never get tired of the. For them it's a new experience every time," he said.

are" column. And of what we are today, we can be very proud. As the week draws closer and closer towards that climax 

Saturday in the Stadium, it is becoming increasingly obvious that 
we are indeed Notre Dame. All of us. Together. We are Notre Dame. It's been called a fever, a pulse, a silent roar. Whatever it is, it's 
highly contagious and very healthy. It's brought us all together .all 
behind one objective, all into the same feeling of family again. It's brought us all back to Notre Dame again. We are rapidly approaching a Saturday afternoon when for three 
hours there will be no critics, no dissidents, no prodigal sons. We will be Notre Dame, and we will be one. And upon closer examination, it begins to become clear that perhaps we are one more often than we think. 
That oneness appears periodically throughout the year. un­mistakeable, but all-too-fleeting. It's there on that first day back from a summer vacation, it's there during the walk back from that final exam, it's thereon that bleak February night when the singing drunk walks past the dorm window and we are lonely and we are one. 
But for. some re~son, the oneness that joins us together this weekend IS more mtense than at any other time. The other moments of oneness are there, and should be far more consciously celebrated, but they lack the fervor of the feeling that joins us together right now. 
This weekend we are one, one in purpose, one in spirit. one in Notre Dame. This weekend there is no .administration. no faculty, no alumni, no student body. Only Notre Dame. 
When th.e national anthem echoes its final notes, and that brigade of blue shirts and gold helmets breaks into full view of the packed throng, the oneness will be fully realized. There will be no barrier

Transmits students' ideas, concerns 
Board changed in '61 
Comprised mainly of laymen 
by Maurl'en Flynn Sl'nior Starr Reporter 
In May of 1967, the Congregation of Holy Cross voluntarily tran­sferred control of the University of Notre Dame to a Board of Trustees composed primarily of laymen. 
Almost $30\l million worth of assets were involved in the tran­saction. which established a Board of seven t-~riests and thirty lay 1wrsons ;o replace one made up of six lloly Cross priests.

the reorganization of the University's prime governing body was attributed to four factors. 
"--1. The increasing public character of the University as evidenced by the broad financial support it receives. 
--2. The dramatic growth the University has experienced in the past few decades which has been accompanied by unprecedented and complex problems in ad­ministration, fiscal matters, planning, development and public relations. 
by Bon Hl'iml'r St'nior Staff Ht>porter 
The Student Affairs Committee of the Board of Trustees is the eomm ittee which deals most directly with student concerns anc! needs. 
The committee was set up six years ago in order to allow a smaller group of trustees to become better acquainted with st­udent problems, according to committee chairman Dr. Thomas Carney. 
Carney, the Chairman of the I<:xecutive Committee of the National Patent Development Corporation, added that the committee was established as "a sounding board for student affairs problems.'' 
The committee is mainly int­t•rested in student concerns con­sequently, many of the issues are raised by student leaders working with the Vice-President for Student Affairs Bro. Just Paczesny. Both graduate students and off-campus students have made presentation before the board. 
"The committee itself works in 
an informal way trying to help the 
administration and the student 
leaders put into effect or im­
plenwnt the goals and solutionsthat 
they have jointly arrived at," not-
Pd I<'r. Thomas Blantz. 
Another important function of 
the committee is that of t· 
ransmitting concerns and ideas to 
the larger board. The smaller 
eommittee is able to devote more 
1ime to an individual issue, 
narrowing the area down and st­
udying it in greater detail. 
"Their <the committee mem­
bersl role is more or less to 
acquaint themselves with the 
report back to the full board thei.r observations." 
('ommittee helps students 
When the committee was begun it was to serve the students as a vehicle to speak directly to the Board of Trustees. Faccenda explained that when the committee was established many of the students held strong feelings and felt that no one in the higher echelons of the University was listening to them. 
The two main ways in which the committee serves the students are in providing an avenue of com­munication and a place for student leadership to talk about unusual problems not included in the general university budget, ac­
cording to Faccenda. men who serve on the committe 
...The committee works in an informal way to help administration and student leaders put into effect the goals they have jointly arrived at.... 
"If something comes up that the students are quite interested in," Faccenda explained, "and they bring it to the vice-president forst­udent affairs and he determines t­hat the University would be in· terestl'd in it, then there has to be 
an  unusual  course  taken  to  
determine  if  the  proposal  is  a  
viable one."  

Thl' renovation of LaFortune St­udent Center was a prime example of this special process, according to Faccenda. A group of interested students approached the committ­ce several years ago with a proposal to renovate the center, t­
--3. The need to draw upon all available skills in the operation of the University. 
--4. The importance of granting the laity a more independent and responsible role in the governance of Catholic institutions as a sequel to the pronouncements of the Second Vatican Council." 
Changl'-OVt'l' rumored 
Rumors concerning the proposed change-over spread while discussions were still underway, and in January of 1967 Fr. Theodore Hesburgh, university president, wrote an open letter to "members of the Notre Dame family." 
Hesburgh briefly outlined the history of the University and the changing role of the Holy Cross priests in its maintenance and administration. 
"It is precisely in the core en­deavor of continuing, stabilizing, and insuring the character of the 
· University as Catholic, that the Congregation of Holy Cross finds its truest and most exalted mission," Hesburgh stated. "Not that the Congregation alone can or should do this" Hesburgh con­tinued, "but in concert with an increasing number of intelligent and dedicated laymen (and diocesan and religious priests of other orders, tool who share the vision of what a great Catholic university can be in the modern world ... " 
Laymt>n play larger role 
One way in which the Congregation contributes to the development of the University, Hesburgh noted, is through its administration. "In the past," he said, "this was an exclusive role of the Congregation, .... Today laymen are playing an ever larger role in the over-all administration of the University." 
Carney agreed with Faccenda also pointing to the renovation of LaFortune as an example of the committeee aiding student proposals to become reality. "The committee has been reasonably 
effective  in  transmitting  student  
concerns  to  the  Board,"  said  
Carney.  

Members tap student opinion 
The members of the Student Af­fairs Committee are very much in touch with the students, according to Faccenda. He said that the contacts are mostly through in­dividual liaisons on campus. 
"The chairman of the committee (Carney> customarily is in ·frequent contact with the student body president and several of the 
are also parents of students," said Faccenda. 
Faccenda added that the com­mittee has a "phenomenal" att­endance record of 98 percent and all of the members prepare in advance for the meetings and daily read the Observer. 
"I'm on campus every other weekend throughout the year," said Carney, noting that he too felt that committee members were very much in touch with the st­udents. He explained that when t­he committee first began they met four times a year, rather than two, in order to become better 
and he praised Commmittee Chairman Carney as being especially open. 
"Dr. Carney is a unique in· dividual. very open and very ap­proachable," said Blantz. "He is also a very good administrator who runs an excellent meeting and gives everyone a chance to say what they want to say." 
Daily contact with the students helps Blantz to gain a better grasp on what the students are thinking. 
"The day to day contact really . has been very beneficial," said Blantz. 
"Living here on campus you have the contact which will permit one to know what many of the students are thinking," Blantz explained. "When new ideas come up it is very easy, sitting around talking to a group of 
students, just to ask questions." 
Ht'lations with student affairs o£fice 
The role of the Student Affairs Committee in relationship to the Student Affairs Office, according to Faccenda, is that of an overseer. 
"The trustees are not in there to replace the judgment of the ad­ministration. What they are in th· ere for is to make sure that the administration is doing what it is supposed to do," explained Fac­cenda. He stated that the com­mitttee is the group who should Thunday, October 23, 1975

This increasing role, Hesburgh explained, "is necessary because .of the increasing complication of the current operation, the sheer .size of the place and the variety of its growing concerns, the wide ,spectrum of natural and acquired 
)competencies required to get the ·job done, and the changing in· terests and more academically and pastorally-oriented concern!> of the priests themselves." 
"But apart from necessity," 
Hesburgh stated, "the growing 
involvement of laymen on all 
levels of University administration 
reflects a similarly welcome 
development in many areas of the 
post-Conciliar Church." 
"The time has come," Hesburgh announced, "for a greater collaboration of priests and laymen in that body which is responsible for the over-all governance and policies of the University, the Board of Trustees." 
Hesburgh traced the origins of the University's main governing ~ody and the internal and external changes which called for an alteration in its organization.

committee as a purely advisory one. "We are an advisory com­mittee, " he said, "with no auth­ority over Br. Just. We simply m­ake recommendations to the Board." 
In the COUL Report presented to the Student Affairs Committee last May it was stated the many students have "such feelings as powerlessness, umpotence, bitt­erness and anxiety towards St­udent Affairs." The report also noted that the Office is seen as "an adversary whose task is to make life difficult for students." 
Blantz reacted to these charges saying that he was not exactly sure how widespread these feelings were on campus. He noted that because one of the duties of the Student Affairs Office is en­forcement of University rules there is bound to be some negative feeling towards the office . 
Otner areas of Student Affairs provide valuable services to the students, Blantz pointed out. He pointed out the work of Fr. Schlaver in Student Activities Office and Fr. Tallarida in the Off­campus Housing Office as examples of the positive services. 
"If there is that kind of negative 
feeling, I think it can be improved 
through better public relations to 
let people know the positive things 
the office is doing," Blantz 
suggested. 
Faccenda felt that complaints 
and problems with the Student 
Affairs Office should be resolved in 
discussions by those involved, 
rather than through rhetorical 
arguments. 
He pointed out that the office 
does receive student advice on 
various issues.

ford's economic theater 
is not to be ignored, and we trust that the interplay of the actors and their analyses will provide more information on the question. Of course both sides realize that whatever the final program might be, it will differ substantially from that proposed. Nonetheless, evaluation of the proposed package is important. But that still leaves us with the question of whether this is the type of play that we should be offen•d and whether the effect on the audit>nee is the best we could do. 
It seems to me that the theater piece is \'Pry unfortunate, the reason is that we heit1g offered poor entertainment instead of t'l'onom ic policy. Let's see in what sense this is true. Antoconomic policy would be a l'lt>ar statt>nwnt of the economic goals of the Pconomic decision-makers, combined with a Sl't of programs designed to reach thosP goals. Both statemPnt and program would he eolwrent and consistent and thus would providP a basis for estimating the likelihood ofsuccess in attaining the goal. lnstt>ad we are given a set of programs with no idPa of basic goals and no con­sistl'ncy evl'n among the programs. The programs arc chosen to maximize appeal to tht• audit•ncP. and thus consistency is too Jlllll'h to<•xpet'l. For t•xample, we can look at the tax l'llt package and another program introduced recently by the Ford administration. the "Energy ln­dt>l)('nd<•ncl' Authority." Note that the statl'd purpose of the tax expenditure package is to cut down the government's conltlland over real resources and to relul'll that eomm<md to the private in­dividual. It tul'lls out that the thrust of the I·:IA is exactly the opposite, government will enter financial markets and will take 1 0111111and over financial resources and 1hen•hv rt•alrl'sources in order to channel 1IH•m ii1to t'nl'rgy projects. It is hard to say 1f tlw $2B l}illion expenditure reduction will rl'lurn more resourees that the $100 billion 1-:1:\ will takl' away. but the point is the sht•Pr inconsistency of programs designed lor audit>nn• appeal.

IU expands medical school at Notre Dame 

by Pat Spicer 
Staff Reporter 
In the basement of Haggar Hall, 
a relatively obscure but 
nonetheless important part of the 
Notre Dame academic community 
goes about its business. All 
students are familiar with the Law 
School but few realize that our 
campus has its own medical school 
I ucked away on the bottom floor of 
the Psychology building. 
Officially known as the South Bend Center for Medical Education, the school can trace its history back to the mid-1960's. 
It was at that time that the overcrowded Indiana University School of Medicine found it . necessary to expand. 
Instead of merely enlarging the original med school in In­dianapolis, it was decided to create t•qual distribution of physicians about Indiana by opening up outlet schools in various large cities of the state. 
However. due to a lack of funds. this plan was scaled down to where the I.U. Medical School could only open up cooperative med schools utilizing the facilities of colleges located in the chosen cites. 
Thus, in 1970, Notre Dame became the home of one of the eight 
I.U. outlet medical schools. 
The medical school is in no way under the jurisdiction of the university. It is funded entirely by the State of Indiana and rents the Haggar Hall space from Notre Dame.

Insight 
According to Dr. Tom Pragon, administratior of the center, the school is attended by twenty students . all freshman, for two semesters. 
These potential physicans are considered special grad students by the university, although none live on campus. Among the twenty 
freshman,  mostly  natives  of  In­ 
diana.  are  four  Notre  Dame  
graduates.

Endorses public executions 
HOFFMAN ESTATES, Ill. (AP> -A minister concerned about increasing crime advo; cates public execution of con­victed murderers on prime­time televison. 
"Nothing much else has helped stop crime and I think public executions of convicted killers would be an unbeatable shock method," says the Rev. Paul B. Tinlin, 41-year-old pas­tor of the Evangel Assembly of God church. 
The Toronto-born minister who was ordained in 1961 said, "I'm no religious quack but people need to be shocked and sobered like they were by the assassinations of the Kennedys which were shown and reshown on television." 
The minister, whose congre­gation numbers 250, said sev­Pt'al weeks ago he answered an editorial in a local newspaper which commended the Supreme Court for striking down the death penalty. 
"In my .Jetter, which was printed, I said the court was wrong, that there should be swift and sure justice for those who kill," he said. 
''Now I've been called 'that 
murderous minister.' But one 'man wrote me saying that exe­
cutions should be held in Sol­
dier Field. · "I don't want any bizarre or 
circus-like attraction, but we've got to let society see life for real for its shock value. There

derground sex movie in which 
a woman actually was killed. "I thought to myself: Now we 
are making entertainment the real thing and we can't even 
make real life the real thing." From the Book of Genesis,
the Rev. Mr. Tinlin quoted: "Whoever sheds the blood of man, by man shall his blood be shed." 
The Rev. Mr. Tin lin said he began forming his philosophy when he was pastor of a church in Lexington, Ky., and visited several prisons. 
"Sitting and talking to con­victed murderers was a strange sensation," he said. "Here they were. comforted by being sure of living despite their crime." 
He said he had a long talk with his 12-year-old daughter about executions on TV. 
"I told her I probably would get sick when I saw it because it would be gruesome. But mur­der also is gruesome and society has to start taking it se­riously.''
