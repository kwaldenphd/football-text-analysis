Kling evaluates Church outlook 
By JIM PLAMONDON and KAREN MCCLOSKEY 
Neu•sStuff 
fr. llans Kung. a controversial 
theologian and author of three 
hooks, spoke to a <.·apadty crowd at 
Washington llall last night. His 
lecture wa.~ elllitkd "On What Can 
We Rdy? A Christian Oricmation in 
a Disorientated Society." 
Kung said that "the Church, State, School and family sc:em to be in­sccure and art· no longer ac<.·c:pted as absolutc authority." fr. Kung feels that there is no undisputed authority whkh <.'an take charge in important 
cthkal issues. 
"W<.· will ncver have concrete orientation if wc do not consider rdigion," Kung stressed. "Ethical questions overpower possible human capabilitit:s." Kung said that, "humans havc the technology to do more than is proper. Therefore we need a ba.~ic Christian orientation to guide us." 
fr. Kung wa.o; applauded when he commented on the issues ofpriestly celibacy, women's ordination, and remarriage after divorce. He said that ifjesus Christ came back today," he would not have passed such harsh judgments on pcoplt:." 
In answer to his initial question, on what can a Christian rely, Fr. Kung suggested that people look to jcsus Christ, not as a myth, bm as a historical figure. With this new spirit individuals can act with "new con­sciousnc:ss, new motivations new dispositions, new actions, and new 
horizons of meaning." 
Fr. Kung sees faith as the most im­portant clement of this conversion. He calls for the practicing of true Christianity instead of the falseness ofdecrees "which declare nothing." 
fielding questions at the conclu­sion of his lecture, Fr. Kung expressed his views on the papacy. Regarding the Pctrine succession: "I am in favor of such a tradition." He noted , however, that the Pope should pcrt()rm his role in the Chris­tian spirit, not in the custom of the Caesars. Acting as "the servant as· all," the Pope should bear the bur­den of the Church's mission rather than being its figurehead. He pointed to John XXIII a.o; a symbol of this papal servant. 
Fr. Kung is the author of three books, the first of which The Coun­cil and Reunion, was published in 1961. He later wrote On Being a Christian in 1976, and his latest work, Does God Exist? was released last year.

Charles F. Lennon, a South Bend community leader and president of the St. Joseph Insurance Agency, Inc., has been named executive director of the University of Notre Dame Alumni Association. The appointment, effective immediately, was made by Fr. Theodore M. Hesburgh, president ofthe University with the con­currence of the Association's Board of Directors. Lennon, 43, is a native of Joliet, Ill., who received his undergraduate degree from Notre Dame in 1961 and went on to earn an M.A. in guidance and counseling from the University the following year.

In 85 percent of cancer cases. there is no 
reliable and objective method of monitoring the spread of the disease. However, collaboration between a Notre Dame researcher and a South Bend oncologist may result in a reliable method through the study ofserum fats in the blood ofcancer patients. Dr. Seymour Schlager, associate professor in Notre Dame's Microbiology Depart­ment, cautions that his studies with Dr. Ronald E. Aigotti, oncologist with the South Bend Clinic, are not meant to devise new cancer treatments, but rather, a way to predict whether or not a given treat­ment is effective in preventing the spread of tumors. The collabora­tion began last spring, involving a "coded" group Of patients receiving conventional cancer treatment from Dr. Aigotti. Almost all are surgery patients, suffering from lymphoma, breast and colon can­cers having high recurrence rates. While Aigotti administers con­ventional treatment such as chemotherapy, he also sends samples of the patients' blood to Schlager, who studies the serum fats in the samples. Schlager said experiments with laboratory animals have shown a "well-defined" difference in the serum fats ofthose animals that died of tumors, and those that survived. Schlager said that the serum fats in animals underwent one type of change as tumors spread, but experienced another type of change when tumors regressed. He said there may be similar correlations in the change of human serum fats, which if analyzed, could lead to a reliable and 
objective method for determining whether a particular chemot­herapeutic treatment was preventing the spread of tumors. -The Observer 
A concert and candlelightvigilare planned 
in Liverpool today, the first anniversary ofJohn Lennon's death, in this industrial city where the Beatles began chronicling by song the changes ofthe 1960s that swept the world. "They're coming in their thousands from every corner of the world," said Sam Leach, a promoter ofBeatles concerts 20 years ago and organizer oftonight's free concert in memory offtnnon. "Americans, French, Dutch, Ger­mans, and a lot from Canada -the place will be packed," he said, predicting 30,000 would turn out. Five bands will perform Beatles hits from the 1960s. At 10 p.m., a candlelight vigil and silent prayers will close the gathering. Leach picked the St. George's Hall Plateau for the outdoors concert. It overlooks Liverpool's Lime Street and is opposite the Empire Theater where the Beatles played their first big stage show on Oct. 28. 1962.

Pax Christi heads campus peace 
Notre Dame has continually been a leading influence in the international pursuit of worldwide peace. On Veteran's Day, when the University participated in a nationwide Convocation on the Threat ofNuclear War, Fr. Theodore Hesburgh announced thaJ he would be arranging a meeting of "scientific and religious leaders at the highest level" to discuss nuclear disarmament. 
Guest speaker at the convocation Dr. James Muller, Notre Dame graduate and one of the founders of the International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War,· challenged Notre Dame to become the leading 'peace' campus in the nation, according to Dan Argue, student coordinator of Pax Christi. "Muller said that Notre Dame should be the number one 'peace' campus in the nation," he noted. 
Fr. Hesburgh commented that thus far, his efforts to arrange a meeting between scientific and religious leaders have been successful. Hesburgh travelled to Vienna, a city he considers "a great neutral meeting place," during Thanksgiving vacation to establish tentative arrangements for the meeting. "I made great progress in getting worldwide scientific and religious leaders together," he said, adding that something should happen "in the near future."

nuclear weapons. Berrigan also urged Breshnev to invite President Reagan to destroy four weapons, writing "We believe that it is only by such modest acts that I propose that the poisoned, irrational world climate may be changed'for the better." 
A week after the nationwide campus convocation, President Reagan delivered a "simple, straightforward message" offering a four-part proposal to free .the Con­tinent ofthe possibility ofnuclear war. 
The proposal, referred to as the zero option, states that the United States would forego plans to place 572 new medium-range missles in Europe if the Soviets would scrap comparable nuclear missles they have deployed against Western Europe in the past decade. This action would reduce the number ofmedium-range missles aimed at each potential enemy to zero. 
"I pray that Reagan is making a serious proposal for peace in the zero option Argue said, noting that experts say there is an imbalance in the proposal wh t ich slightly favors the United States."

sponsored by the Office of Campus Ministry. Campus Ministry has been working on a draft counselling service for over a year, according to Argue. "This action was initiated nationwide when President Carter reinstated the draft registration," he said. 
At the workshop, Cornell predicted that the draft would be reinstituted within a year, noting that the Na­tional Interreligious Service Board on Conscientious Objection (NISBCO) informed him that by June there will be classifications and a draft for a three-month training session and six-year reserve. 
Agrue said that he was concerned by Cornell's state­ment about the draft, noting that Cornell seemed hope­ful about the situation. "Many people don't remember 
that they signed up for the 
"We hope to be an informative group, linking stu­dents with counselors and experts to answer their ques­tions." 
President Reagan reconsidered his position regarding nuclear arms in Europe, due possibly to the influence of movements as the Convocation on the Threat of Nuclear War and the European peace demonstrations. West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt described his proposal as "a comprehensive concept for the stabilization ofpeace." 
Should Reagan reinstitute the draft, the stabilization ofpeace concept will become a question that can only be answered through the efforts of organizations such as NISBCO and Pax Christi, groups such as the Plow­shares Eight, and institutions such as the University of Notre Dame.

Over 220 dancers had signed up for the Mardi Gras dance marathon by last Friday, and co-chairman Jim Stork estimates that the number topped 300 last night. 
"Our goal is 500," said Stork. "We'll be signing dancers up tomor­row in both Notrc Dame dining halls and at Saint Mary's." 
Scheduled for Saturday, Feb. 13, 
the twelve-hour dance will begin at 
I p.m. with a OJ, and a live band will 
take over at 9 p.m. Participants in the 
marathon must sell twenty sponsor­
ships to be eligible for entry and for 
prizes. The top seller will choose be­
tween either a TV or stereo.

Sponsorships cost three dollars, and entitle the buyer to free entry to the dance after 9 p.m., a coupon worth S3 at Barnaby's pizza, and numerous door prizes. 
Stork said, "We have stuff like din­ners for two, weekender packages at South Bend hotels, gift certificates, and that type of thing. The main sponsor prize is a trip for two to Mardi Gras in New Orleans." 
Currently, more females than

Long year ahead 
Racers stun Irish, 56-54 

BySKIP DESJARDIN· 
Associate Sports Editor 
There were some questions after 
the Yugoslav game, and more after 
Indiana and UCLA. But last night, the 
questions were answered. 
Murray State served notice to the 
world that the Notre Dame basket· 
ball team has a hard road ahead. 
The Irish turned the ball over 20 
times on the night, and that alone 
was enough to give the visiting 
Racers, playing without their best 
player, a 56-54 win. 
"Things are going to be rough," 
said Digger Phelps after arriving at 
the post-game press conference 45 
minutes late. ("I was in confession," 
he apologized.) "They are going to 
be rough for the next month. We 
just have to realize that. We can't 
give up. We've got to make it go." 
The Irish frontliners, who solved 
one problem (shooting), only found 
another. Tim Andree, Bill Varner, 
Barry Spencer and Tom Sluby gave 
the ball up 16 times between them. 
. "And they didn't lose it against the 
press," Phelps said in disbelief. 
"They gave it up at mid-court. 
"That's what lost it for us, not the 
action at the end." 
The last eight seconds could have 
turned the game around, but they 
didn't. Murray State's Kenney Ham­
monds missed the front end ofa one­
and-one, and Ron Rowan pulled 
down the rebound for the Irish. 
Rowan dished the ball off to Paxson, 
who dashed the length ofthe court. 
As it had all night, Murray State's -defense held. Mike McDuffan, Pax­son's shadow for the evening, forced the Irish guard to the right, and Pax­son was forced to put up a 15-footer from the baseline. 
Then Glen Green, who came back 
from a rough first half to sparkle in 
the second, made the play of his 
career. He went up for the rebound 
of Paxson's prayer, but was knocked 
to the floor under the basket. In the 
time it took Spencer to come up 
with the rebound and put up a shot, 
Green got off the floor and into the 
air. 
Somehow he blocked Spencer's 
near lay-up cleanly, and ended Notre 
Dame's hope for overtime. 
"We got the ball, took a shot, got 
the rebound and "a second shot in 
eight seconds," Phelps said. "You 
can't ask for any more than that." 
The Racers, who lost a home game 
Saturday to Arkansas College, were 
without Lamont Sleets, who 
Shuttle Series continues tonight 
By MARK HANNUKSELA 
Sports Writer 

As it always is in a rivalry of this sort, intensity will be an important part oftonight's 1Oth renewel ofthe Shuttle Series between Notre Dame and Saint Mary's. 
Not too important, mind you, but important none-the-less. 
"Intensity won't be a problem for us," says Saint Mary's Coach Jerry Dallessio of tonight's 7:30 game in the ACC. "This is usually a pretty high-pitched kind ofgame." 
Notre Dame Coach Mary DiStanis­lao agrees. 
"This rivalry is still intense enough to make it a good ballgame," she says, "regardless of what level we might be on or what level they. might be on." 
The 1·1 Irish will have to be on guard against any kind of emotional· letdown against Saint Mary's after losing a close contest to UCLA Satur­day. Asked ifthat might be a problem for her team, DiStanislao replied "It better not be. We still have 24 games left to play." 
It's possible that tonight's game may be the last in this series, which dates back to 1978-Notre Dame's first varsity season -although both coaches have expressed a d esire to keep the series alive. 
Dallessio is 0:7 against Notre Dame in his three years as coach of the Belles. The closest he came to beating a Notre Dame squad was a 61-49 setback in the North District, tournament in February of 1979, the middle season of Sharon Petro's three-year reign as Irish head coach. 
Never in the nine-game series has Saint Mary's come any closer to beating Notre Dame than 10 points. 
Junior tri-captains Anne Armstrong, Mary Pat Sitlington and Mary Bayless will lead the 3·2 Belles into tonight's contest. Armstrong, as she has been in her first two seasons, once again is one of Dallessio's scoring leaders, while Bayless cur­rently leads the Belles in assists. 
SMC's rebounding leader is Missy Van Ort, a six-foot freshman who hauled down 11 against Franklin College Friday. Van Ort also scored I 7 points in last Saturday's game against Tri-State. 
Notre Dame, led by a host of talented freshman, will bring a 1-1 record into the contest. Kansas City, Mo., native Carrie Bates scored 1 7 points in each of the two Irish games, while classmate Ruth Kaiser tallied 22 in the opener against visit· ing St. Joseph's before being held to just four in Saturday's game with the Bruins. 
A third freshman, six-foot In­dianapolis native Mary Beth Schueth, leads Notre Dame in rebounding with a two-game total of 22. 
Tonight's game will be the only meeting between the two squads this season, a change from past seasons, when each team got to play one game on its home floor. 
reinjured a five-week old stress fracture in his left foot earlier in the week. 
"Without Sleets, somebody had to shoot," said Murray State Coach Ron Greene, "so Green got the job. He was cold in the first half, but turned it around in the second." Green ended up 6-of-16 on the night, but hit five of his seven second-half shots. 
The scene in the second half was familiar to Irish fans. As he had in the Indiana and UCLA games, Paxson took charge in the late going. He wound up with 19 points on the night, leading all scorers. He hit six of his eight shots from the floor in the second half, and connected on all three foul shots. 
"John gets a green light in a situa­tion like that," Phelps said of the game's end. "He does what he has to do." 
Greene knew that Paxson was the man to stop, and gave the assign­ment to six-foot-three McDuffen. 
"Mike has the size and savvy to defend a great player like Paxson," Greene said. "We wanted to force him to go to his left and make him shoot with his left hand. It worked well for us." 
After horrendous shooting by 
both teams in the first half, the 
tempo ofthe game changed dramati· 
cally in the second half. Both teams 
were hot early. At one point, both 
squads were hitting well over 80 
percent oftheir shots. 
"We seemed to turn things around as far as our shooting was concerned," Phelps said. Sluby went five-of-eight and Varner went three­of-five. Barry Spencer was two-of­nine in the first half, but turned it around to hit three-of-five after the intermission. 
"We've got a lot of growth ex­periences ahead of us," Phelps ad­mitted, "but we are progressing. We took UCLA out oftheir offensive pat­tern consistently Saturday, but couldn't handle them when they ran a freelance, busted-play offense. That's just going to take time." 
The Irish are still having trouble 
getting the ball inside, however. 
Phelps would pin the blame on inex­
perience, but Andree and Varner, af. 
ter all, are in their third year in the 
system. Much of the fault lies in the· 
paucity ofbig men. 
"It would be great to have a front­
line senior on this team," Phelps ad­
mitted. "We were hurt by 
graduation, the loss of Joe Kleine 
and recruiting. I have to take respon­
sibility for that. 
"We gambled on a couple of big 
men last year and lost. Now we have 
to do our best. and get it done with 
what we have. I promised Orlando. 
Woolridge and Gilbert Salinas that I would recruit no big men, and I kept my commitment to them. That's what Notre Dame is all about ­commitment. Woolridge and Salinas grew a great deal as people here, and that was important -more impor­tant than basketball." 
Now Phelps is suffering the reper­
cussions ofthat promise. 
"It's a challenge, but we will get it 
done. We did it before, and we'll do 
it again. We have to learn to be un­
derdogs. 
"This is the greatest underdog in­stitution in the world. Now teams better watch out, because we've been backed into a corner, and we are going to hurt people down the line. 
"We will get the job done, and we will end up someplace. I don't care if it's the NCAA's or the NIT. We will get there." 
The growth experiences that Phelps speaks of rapidly are ap­proaching. The Irish take on North­ern Illinois Saturday, then Valparaiso on Dec. 22. After that they face a two-week road trip against some of the toughest competition in the country. 
"We need a win," said Phelps. "We arc in a frustrating situation right now. But these guys have got to believe they can get it done. They will. Ifwe have to go into a shell and get away from everybody else, we'll handle it."
