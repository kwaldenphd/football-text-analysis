Iran's president proposes arms trade for hostages 
Associated Press 
KUWAIT -A Kuwaiti news­paper said Saturday that Iranian President Ali Khamenei told Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres that he would help secure the release of American hostages in Lebanon in return for U.S. arms. 
The daily Al-Rai Al-Aam said Khamanei made the proposal during a three-hour meeting Tuesday with Peres in New York where the two were at­tending the U.N. General As­sembly session. 
In Jerusalem, an Israeli Foreign Ministry official, speaking with the condition he not be be identified, said the ministry had no knowledge of such a meeting. 
Al-Rai Al-Aam said that after the meeting, Peres conferred with Secretary of State George Shultz. 
The article said, "Peres told Shultz that Khamenei ex­pressed readiness to secure the release of Americans held hostage in Lebanon in return for an arms shipment that in­cludes ground-to-air Hawk missiles and spare parts for (Iran's) U.S.-made Phantom jets." It attributed its report to unidentified U.S. State Depar­tment officials. 


Bush meets with Polish leaders 
Associated Press 
WARSAW, Poland -Vice President George Bush met Saturday with Polish leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski as he began a four-day visit to Poland with a declaration that he would seek to promote freedom in a way that does not "disrupt or divide" the communist country. 
"We seek only to play a con­structive role in bringing about the national reconcilia­tion that everyone in Poland desires and to promote the cause of freedom," said Bush, the highest-ranking Ameri­can official to visit this nation in a decade. 

"I want to make clear that our intention is not to disrupt or divide, nor is it to inter­fere," he said. 
Bush, who meets Sunday with officials of the banned Solidarity trade union, met with Cardinal Jozef Glemp, head of the powerful Roman Catholic Church in Poland, and separately with Catholic intellectuals in a day that combined the ceremonial with the official. 
Moving around the austere looking Eastern bloc city in a shiny black American limousine, Bush also laid wreaths at the Polish Tomb of the unknown soldier and at a memorial to those killed in 
the Warsaw Jewish Ghetto 
Uprising against the Nazis in 
World War II. 
A few thousand Poles turned out to see the Ameri­can vice president, even though the Polish government did not publish a detailed schedule for his visit. 
Bush's official trip to Europe took on a slightly po­litical cast when a camera crew paid for by his campaign organization began taping his appearances for future cam­paign commercials. 
The vice president is ex­pected to announce his can­didacy for the 1988 Republi­can presidential nomination on Oct. 12.

Let's throw Spuds back into the pound 
The world is going to the dogs. 

This fact became appallingly clear to me when I surveyed several retail stores for my home paper last summer to determine what was the bestselling T-shirt. 
If you thought people actually cared that this summer marked the 200th anniversary of the constitutional convention, you are terribly deluded. Hardly anyone would be caught dead with the Liberty Bell, Statue of Liberty, bald eagle, or any other such tackily jingoistic sym­bol on their chest. 
No, the shirt to which people were flocking in droves featured Spuds MacKenzie. 
I don't know about anybody else, but I think we've just about hit the bottom of the barrel with this latest American icon. Things were bad enough when the height of cultural expression consisted of posting rock stars or stupid quips on our chests. But now we've positively reached the dregs. Now the essence of American culture is embodied in some shiftless, hedonistic En­glish bull terrier, the ultimate "party animal," 
So what does Spuds have that Thomas Jeffer­son doesn't? He likes to drink beer, the only places where you can find him are night clubs, yachts and beaches (remember: he's a "real happenin' dude"), and he virtually has his own harem of scantily clad playmates. What could be more American, someone might interpose? Forget Jefferson. Everybody wants to be a "party animal" these days. So now we have one. Subconsciously, I am sure, every red-blooded, football-watching, beer-guzzling American male says to himself when he sees Spuds, "if only I could be more like him!" and as a result Anheuser-Busch sells more beers. We've come a long way since the day when Thomas Edison and George Washington were citedbyJoeAverageasheroes.Forthatmatter, we've come a long way since the day when this country's idol was John Wayne. 
Spuds alone would be bad enough, in my 
opinion, but unfortunately he (although I am 
told "he" is really a "she") seems to represent 
not just a stupid fad, but rather an increasing 
trend toward triviality in general. We hear con­
tinually about how everything in the universe 
is evolving inevitably toward perfection and in­
creasing sophistication, yet let the progressivist 
explain this: up to the 1920s, the majority of 
America's idols were statesmen, entrepreneurs 
and generals; then starting with the '20's people 
paid homage primarily to sports heroes; then 
starting with the '30's almost everybody wor­
shipped actors and actresses; then beginning 
in the '60's cults formed around rock groups; 
and now at last in the '80's the evolution of 
Americana has reached its Omega Point: a 
debauched dog wearing a tank-top. 
In general, everything these days seems to 
me to becoming more and more like a cartoon. 
Those mawkish little Smurfs and Care Bears 
are just the start of it. Drive through the most

recently built section of any town and all you see are bright, plastic signs and golden arches as though you were passing through a lolly pop factory. Go to almost any restaurant, and all you will find are plastic chairs, plastic tables and people with stupid paper hats making you feel as if you had just entered a Fisher-Price play set. Just look at how we dress. Almost everybody, myself included, wears bermuda shorts, boxer shorts, T-shirts, and oversized sweatshirts --as if we all lived in some Peanuts cartoon strip. 
These days things have become so cartooned and lampooned that our leading politicians deliver speeches that sound like Johnny Carson monologues. Even the priests at this university feel they have to tell jokes in their homilies to be listened to, to the point that one starts to wonder if one is in a chapel or a low-key nightclub. 
Whatever happened to those days when our architecture was sober and dignified, adults dressed like adults instead of children, and Presidents didn't have to be stand-up com­edians to survive politically? Quite frankly I've had enough of anything cute, cuddly, fuzzy or gooey. Let's throw Spuds back into the pound, ban the Smurfs, and not feel obliged to trivialize anything that could possibly be of significance, from politics to sex to religion. 
Yet does anybody care about what I am saying? No. The first thing the people at this paper want to do with my article is to decorate it with yet another cartoon!

The task force, however, needs state funding to ac­complish its goals, according to Rakow. A few months ago, when the state threatened to cut off their funding, the force members vowed to continue volunteering their services in the St. Joseph and Elkhart com­munities, Rakow said. 
"Our people are that com­mited to the program," Rakow added. 
Rakow said he is fairly con­fident the state will continue to provide resources for the pro­gram. One positive indication, he noted, is the state's recent request for the force to expand its coverage to 25 counties in Northern Indiana in order to help those areas establish similar committees.

Shiite faction holding hostages 
Associated Press 
BEIRUT, Lebanon -A pro­Iranian Shiite Moslem faction holding foreign hostages in Lebanon threatened to kill Tunisian government leaders if seven fundamentalist convicts are executed in that North African Arab nation. 
The threat came in a type­written Arabic statement issued by Islamic Jihad, or Is­lamic Holy War, and delivered to a Western news agency in Beirut along with a photograph of American hostage Terry An­derson. 
"We consider this step as a declaration of war on Moslems not only in Tunisia but through­out the world," Islamic Jihad's statement said. 
"Unless the Tunisian regime reverses its unjust sentences and releases all the imprisoned strugglers, it will bear the re­sponsibility for this step which will only end with the uprooting and elimination of the regime. 
"Either freedom for the strugglers or war which we. will not confine to a specific time or place."

The black-and-white photo showed Anderson in a dark striped shirt looking straight at the camera. The picture was similar to five other photos of Anderson released in Novem­ber and December of 1986 and January and February 1987. 
Anderson, 39, chief Middle East correspondent for The As­sociated Press, is the longest held hostage among the 23 foreigners missing and believed kidnapped in Lebanon. He was abducted March 16, 1985. 
In addition, Anglican Church envoy Terry Waite is missing after he vanished last January during a mission to attempt to mediate the release of some of the hostages. 
Islamic Jihad, which claimed responsibility for Anderson's abduction, also holds another American and -at least three Frenchmen. The group's new statement made no threats against the hostages. 
The release of Anderson's picture appeared to be only meant to authenticate the statement. 
"The price for the execuion of our struggling brothers will be big heads of the leaders of the Tunisian oppressive regime," the statement said. 

Artificial insemination to save exotic animals 
Associated Press 
LOUISVILLE, Ky. Veterinarians at the Louisville Zoo, who successfully trans­ferred a zebra embryo into a quarter horse in 1984, are now testing artificial insemination and embryo splitting as ways to save endangered species. 
"They're in the forefront. They really are," Dr. Joe Flanagan, staff veterinarian with the Houston Zoo, said of his colleagues in Louisville, who are led by Dr. Bill Foster. 
"We in the zoo business... know that Bill Foster is working with exotic equines, and no one else is really doing that. If I have a question, I call Bill." 
In the zoo's most unusual project, scientists early next year intend to extract a living embryo from an onager, a wild ass, split it, return half to the natural mother and implant the other half in a domestic mare. 
If the project succeeds, the result would be identical twin onagers with different mot­hers, Foster said ..

The Institute for Museum Services last month awarded the zoo a $10,080 grant to sup­port the artificial insemination research, and Zoo Foundation Chairman Bert Klein has all­ocated $25,000 for the embryo project. 
Foster said much of the zoo's inquiry is focused on reproduc­tion in exotic equine species ­wild horses and horse-like animals including zebras and onagers -because it ties in with Kentucky's horse industry. 
He said the purpose of the projects is to learn more about the ways in which the animals reproduce, with the ultimate goal of increasing the numbers and genetic diversity of threatened and endangered species. 
Sometime in February, Foster and Dr. Scott Bennett, an equine veterinarian from Simpsonville, plan to flush a 6­day-old embryo from the uterus of a female onager bor­rowed from the Mesker Park Zoo in Evansville, Ind.

Alcohol policy ripe for revision 
About six years ago, the administra­tion found they had a problem.. They thought the students were abusing al­cohol, so the administration studied this problem and looked for a solution. As a result, the Alcohol Policy was created. This banned open containers, kegs, loud parties and just about every­thing else associated with college fun. It also promoted something known as responsible drinking. After some protest, the campus became sedate, serene and dull. All drinking, except for S.Y.R.'s, was pushed into rooms or off campus, where the administration could not see it. Since they could not see as many people drinking as they had before, it seemed the problem had been solved. 
Tom Varnum 
third and long 
But had it? Ask yourself, has there ever been a time when you weren't able to drink when you wanted to because of the Alcohol Policy? If there was no alcohol policy, would you drink more than you do now? I doubt it. Sure it's a pain in the behind that you can't walk around .with a beer in your hand but has that ever stopped you from drink­ing? The majority of drinking occurs at parties, not while walking around. While loud parties and open containers have disappeared from campus, stu­dent drinking continues to be a prob­lem. 
In fact, the alcohol policy may have made the situation worse. By pushing drinking into the rooms, the university has given problem drinkers a shield to hide behind. They can hole up in their room and abuse alcohol all they want, and no one will say anything about it. It seems, as far as the university is concerned, as long as you are quiet and in your room, you can drink yourself into oblivion if you want. Is this promot­ing responsible drinking? By severely restricting social drinking, the only thing some people will do now is drink to get drunk. 
For those socially adept drinkers, the only option was to move off campus and escape the watchful eyes of Rectors and 
R.A. 's. This move has brought about two more problems: drinking and driving and off campus parties getting broken up by police. In the past year, two people have been killed by Notre Dame students driving under the influ-
Doonesbury 
ence of alcohol. Problems at the parties 
have also become worse; many have 
been ended by the local police with their 
noise meters, ticket booklets, handcuffs 
and hungry pets. 
In creating the alcohol policy, the uni­
versity forced drinking off campus. 
They moved their problem out into the 
City of South Bend. Accordingly, the 
City of South Bend has taken action to 
solve this problem. You really can't 
blame South Bend for becoming upset 
with the University and its students. 
Local residents shouldn't have to deal 
with a University problem. The local 
police have enough to worry about with­
out worrying about rowdy college stu­
dents. They have to do what they can 
to serve the local residents (the dogs 
are a bit much, though). 
In response to the drunk driving 
(D.U.I.) problem, the administration 
has released a four page list of sanc­
tions and punishments for students ar­
rested for D.U.I. That is well and fine, 
but it does not solve the problem the 
Alcohol Policy has partially created. 
Instead of eliminating the situations 
where drinking and driving would oc­
cur, it punishes the offenders after the 
act has been committed. 
Perhaps the administration believes the threatened sanctions will frighten the potential drunk driver to think twice before getting behind the wheel. The problem is: Have you ever met a drunk person who is frightened easily or thinks twice about anything? Of course not. A sober person might read about the punishments and vow not to drink and drive, but after a few beers, all rationality goes down the toilet. If scare tactics worked, the threat of arrest and prosecution would reduce drunk drivers, but it doesn't. Why does the administration think that the loss of parking privliges would stop a student when the threat of arrest won't? 
The administration's proposal also does nothing about the off campus party problem, which seems to get worse every week. The relationship be­tween off campus students and local residents has . just about reached the breaking point. Pretty soon, this prob­lem will reach the point where the Uni­versity will have to act on it. 
So what is their next step? Many people believe it will be a completely dry campus. This, besides being ex­tremely childish and unfair, will not solve the problem. The off campus sit­uation would mushroom into something

dreadful. What if the administration decides to expel anyone, on campus or off, illegally in possession of alcohol? Legal ramifications aside, it would be virtually impossible to enforce. 
What the administration must realize is that no matter what they do, we will still drink. No matter what sanctions or penalties are threatened, people, in general, will still drink. Prohibition proved this in the twenties. Having ex­amined all this, there might be another logical and possibly effective solution open to the administration. Maybe it's time to modify the alcohol policy. 
If the alcohol policy were modified, the major parties (which means the major drinking) would return to campus. This would mean three things. First, the social life on campus would improve. Second, Notre Dame's image in the community would improve be­cause off campus parties would be reduced. Thirgly, the instances of drinking and driving may be reduced. 
There are some problems with this idea, I know. Some people might ques­tion the legality of a more open drinking situation. Underage students might be exposed to more drinking. I doubt that. Underage students drink as much as

they want to right now, and sometimes more. A more liberal policy will not change that. 
Another problem deals with drinking and driving. If the major parties were held on campus, off campus students would drive to them. Driving home would still cause a problem. My only possible answer to this would be that less people live off campus so less people would be driving to an on campus party than would be driving to an off campus party. It's a very weak answer, I know, but it can't be any weaker than a list of sanctions. 
My idea might work and, then again, it might not. I believe, however, it is a viable solution which not only deals with the D.U.I problem but the off campus party situation as well. 
The alcohol policy has not really promoted responsible drinking the way the administration had hoped. It has only forced drinking behind locked doors and off campus. It may have dis­rupted and even destroyed lives. Con­sidering this, isn't it about time to re­evaluate and modify the alcohol policy?

Just who are Dick and Jane? 
MIKE NAUGHTON accent editor 

S 
tudents first heard of Dick and Jane through their per­sonals to each other in The Observer: "DEAREST JANE ­THE MOST BEAUTIFUL SENIOR, My life is empty since you left me for Notre Dame..." and "TO DICK. MY VERY OWN MAG­NUM P.l. Your personal brought tears to my eyes and a throb to my heart. .. 
Every day, as regular as the weather, a new personal would appear. Every day a new snip­pet of sappy love-longing and sighs would make people choke on their lunch. Student interest grew: "Who is this Dick?" "Could two people pos­sibly be so sappy for each other?" The questions

remained unanswered, and the personals continued. In fact, they became, despite all predictions, even more ga-ga eyed and love-lorn. 
Interest in the mysterious lovers peaked last week when a half-page ad appeared in The Observer: "Jane -will you many me? Dick.'' 
Everywhere from the dining halls to the Huddle a cry arose, "Are these two for real!!??" 
Well, yes and no. 
The story of Dick and Jane begins far away from Notre Dame at another school, the New York Academy of Window Display Modeling. Dick and Jane met there during their freshman year and were in­separable from then on. 
Somehow, Jane was able to keep up the hectic pace of maintaining a relationship with Dick while studying at the 
Institute and moonlight­
ing at local clothing stores. 
Even though she was happy 
with her life, Jane felt the need 
to move on, and at the end of 
her junior year decided to 
transfer to the school of her 
dreams, Notre Dame. 
Dick, a strong, silent type, 
was a year older than Jane and 
stayed behind to model in a 
local clothing store. Jane has 
been having some difficulties 
since she transferred into Notre 
Dame her senior year. She is 
by nature a quiet person, so 
people sometimes think that 
she lacks personality. But she 
isn't a dummy. Because Jane 
was having trouble adjusting to 
life under the Dome, the senior 
class officers took it upon 
themselves to adopt her. 
According to Diane Fitzgib­

bon, senior class president, 
Jane has the perfect personal­
ity to be involved in student 
government, "she spends 
hours and hours working in the 
office, and I've never heard her 
complain yet." Fitzgibbon 
says that despite the fact that

Jane's popularity to her outgo­ing nature, "She's a lot of 
fun and a great dancer (though she doesn't like to lead). She 
puts Janet Jackson to shame." 
Even though Jane seemed to 
be happy, friends sensed that 
there was a void in her life -­
she missed Dick. 
And Dick missed Jane. Since she left for Notre Dame, he had kept himself busy worldng 
in department stores, but none the personals of The Observer in order to keep the name alive between them. During this time, Dick was secretly moonlighting at Good­will in order to save money for a ring. Then, last week he pro­

Who's the richest? 
It seems that two biggest business magazines cannot agree on how many billionaires there are in the United States and Japan. In its July 27 issue, Fortune reported that the U.S. trailed Japan in billionaires 21 to 22. Forbes came back on Oct. 5, and put the U.S. ahead of Japan by a score of 40 to 
24. Then Fortune's issue a week later put the total of U.S. billionaires at 47, Japan 4. 
"Obviously, Fortune is a little confused," said a Forbes reporter, "but we have never changed our estimates." For­tune could not be reached for comment, but suggested, however, in the story that there was some difficulty in un­covering hidden fortunes. 
The richest businessman, according to Forbes, is Yoshiaki Tsutsumi from Japan. He controls a $70 billion empire and has a personal fortune of over $20 billion. A Business Briefs tip on getting there: buy real estate in Japan. Almost all Japaneses billionaires acquired their status by shrewdly buying land.

Business Briefs 
Recently an employment brochure was being distributed at a local Taco Bell. On the cover, four smiling, attractive models beckoned prospective employees with bright expres­sions that said, "Come on, this is fun!" The brochure promised a great group, not only to work with, but to be your best friends as well. It also promised frequent raises. A girl behind the counter had this to say about frequent raises: "I have worked here for four months." No raise yet. 
As for the supposed great group of people to work with, well... Taco Bell has some problems. The shifts can run as late as 5:00a.m. and are mostly limited to meal hours. Taco Bell is also a favorite spot for obnoxious party-goers, always fun to deal with at 2:00a.m. on a Friday night. 
With a complex menu that keeps expanding, polyester uni­forms, very low wages, and all that grease, one is amazed that Taco Bell has any workers at all. Needless to say, Taco Bell has a hard time retaining quality workers, let alone models like the ones pictured in their brochure. In the words of one anonymous former Taco Bell employee, "That place was Taco Hell."

A rose by any other name: business monikers changing 
By BRIAN P. MURRAY Business writer 

Last year was a record year for corporate name changes. Over 1300 companies empha­sized their change in image by adopting a name that sym­bolized their new direction and purpose. 
However, many of the names 
represent  cutsie  buzzwords,  
made  by  joining  two  other  
names.  

Take Unisys, for example. 
After Burroughs and Sperry merged, the employees were asked to submit names. From thousands of entries comes Unisys, an obvious suggestion about the merger, synergy, and the "strength of two," as stated in their ad campaign. 
An even worse example is Trinova, the new name for Libby-Owens-Ford. 
Though many people did not know what Libby-Owens-Ford made, it sure sounded like a lot. Fruit, glass, cars? A great business name deserving respect. 
But Trinova means nothing. The change in names is fairly obvious: tri, meaning three, and nova, suggesting a star. Since Tristar was taken, Trinova was chosen. 
As if there aren't enough star companies already, along comes Navistar, a rebirth of old International Harvester. 
International Harvester was once a mighty industrial com­pany. But in these Yuppie times, heavy industry is out. Cheese and wine and cute busi­ness quips like Navistar are in. 
UAL jumped on the band­wagon when it felt that United Airlines did not describe its hotel and rental car operations. From alliance and aegis comes Allegis. 
Two words, one stupid, meaningless name. The stock price fell almost ten percent on the announcement of the new name. 
Of course, some companies have justifiable reasons for changing their name, espe­cially when they diversify. 
USX needed to shed the steel image of US Steel when they diversified into energy. 
USX at least rejected "Maxus" and "Amcon", both whimpy names. In addition, USX took its name from its stock exchange symbol, a 
move that appreciates the real reason for corporate America. Combining words or sounds can have its dangers. 
Houston Natural Gas and In­terNorth almost picked the name Enteron for the merged company. Enteron is another word for the digestive system, from the mouth to the other end. Though the words fit, i.e. gas and enter north (exit south), the company chose En­ron. 
Exxon almost chose the name Enco, which means stalled car in Japanese. 
Fortunately, the mistake was caught in time. 
In reviewing the recent name change trends, a simple process becomes apparent. Take two syllables that sym­bolize a forward looking com­pany of growth and strength but above all else, the result must sound cute. 
Southland Corp., owner of 7­11 stores, would become Slurpco.

U.S., IMF disagree on deficit 
Associated Press 

Treasury Secretary James Baker gave an optimistic view of the world economy Sunday after a gloomier set of predic­tions was announced by the In­ternational Monetary Fund. 
The IMF's "World Economic Outlook" said sluggishness early this year roused concern that activity would slow down this year and next. 
It added that this concern was increased by large surpluses and deficits in trade and growing friction on the issue, fears of a further decline of the dollar in Europe and Japan, low prices for goods produced in the Third World and the decline of bank lending to the area. 
"In the United States we ex­pect real growth in excess of 3 percent for both 1987 and 1988," Baker told the IMF's Interim Committee, which makes its major decisions. 
"Other countries are also putting into place policies to promote global growth and a reduction of external im­balances. Japan, for example, is moving to implement a stimulative fiscal package and tax reform, both of which should support domestic demand" according to Baker. 
Baker's statement was made to a closed-door meeting . 
The IMF, meanwhile, issued a report saying the U.S. budget deficit would shrink signifi­cantly this year but will rise through 1990, despite predic­tions to the contrary by the Reagan administration. 
"There continues to be un­certainty about the timing and extent of future fiscal correc­tions because compromises be­tween the U.S. administration and Congress on ways to cut deficits have proved to be ex­tremely difficult to achieve," the IMF staff said in its annual economic outlook issued for meetings of the 151-nation IMF and the World Bank in Wash­ington this week. 
The report was referring to the conflicting fiscal positions staked out by President Reagan and congressional Democrats. 
Reagan steadfastly opposes tax increases and is trying to stave off military spending cuts demanded by the Demo­cratic majority in Congress. 
Compared to a 1986 U.S. budget deficit of $220.7 billion, the IMF staff published a table showing estimated deficits of $163 billion for fiscal 1987 en­ding this week, $173 billion for 1988 and $179 billion for 1990. 
The Reagan administration projects the deficits at $158 bil­lion for 1987, $123 billion for 1988 and $90 billion for 1990. 
The IMF said its estimates were based on no further changes in the U.S. tax system or spending programs. 
The report noted "signs of weakness in private consump­tion in the United States" after four years of providing the en­gine for economic recovery. 
It predicted that growth in 
U.S. domestic demand would slow to an annual rate of 1.75 percent to 2 percent in 1987-88, compared to 3.5 percent to 4 percent for 1985-86. 
Improved export competi­tiveness should stimulate U.S. economic growth and weaker domestic consumption "should be largely, if not fully, offset by a sizable increase in U.S. real net exports," the IMF said.

Punta-average 
ATLANTA -The San Fran­cisco Giants clinched a tie for the National League West title Sunday, spoiling Phil Niekro's farewell game by routing the Atlanta Braves 15-6 as Candy Maldonado hit a grand slam and drove in six runs. 
San Francisco cut its magic number to one over second­place Cincinnati, which beat Houston 4-2. The Giants can clinch their first playoff berth since 1971 by winning Monday night in San Diego, or if the Reds lose to Atlanta in Cincin­nati. 
The Giants also put a disap­pointing end on Niekro's career. The 48-year-old knuck­leballer signed to pitch one final game for the Braves, but he wound up allowing five runs on six hits with six walks in 
Niekro, who failed to hold a 5-0 lead, left the mound with his head bowed to a four-minute standing ovation, his seventh of the day from 26,019 fans on At­lanta's final home date of the season. 
Reds 4, Astros 2 
CINCINNATI-Buddy Bell's two-run triple highlighted a four-run eighth inning Sunday that carried Cincinnati past the Houston Astros 4-2 Sunday. 
Cincinnati rallied in the 
eighth off starter Bob Knepper, 
8-17, who took a three-hitter 
into the inning. Singles by Dave 
Collins, Dave Concepcion and 
Tracy Jones scored Cincin­
nati's first run and Knepper left 
after inducing Dave Parker to 
force Jones at second. 
NEW YORK-Bob Ojeda won his first start since coming off the disabled list on Sept. 1 after missing three months, and Kevin McReynolds drove in four runs as the New York Mets defeated the Pittsburgh Pirates 12-3 Sunday. 
The Mets now trail first­place St. Louis by two-and-a­half games in the National League East. 
Expos 5, Phillies 3 
PHILADELPHIA Tim Raines hit a bloop double that was lost in the sun and scored on a wild pitch to break an eighth-inning tie, and the Montreal Expos went on to beat the Philadelphia Phillies 5-3 

Montreal now trails first­place St. Louis by three games. The Expos start a four-game series with the Cardinals Tues­day night. 
Cubs 7, Cardinals 3 
CHICAGO -Bob Dernier, a last-minute replacement in the starting lineup, had a lead-off home run, double, and scored twice to lead the Chicago Cubs over St. Louis 7-3 Sunday as the Cardinals' magic number for clinching the National East title remained at five. 
The loss, coupled with New York's 12-3 victory over Pit­tsburgh, reduced St. Louis' lead to two-and-a-half games gave last-place Chicago a league-leading 203 homers this season.

TORONTO -Kirk Gibson's 13th-inning single drove in the go-ahead run and the Detroit Tigers stayed close in the American League East race by beating the Toronto Blue Jays 3-2 Sunday, averting a sweep in their four-game series. 
The Blue Jays' magic num­ber remained at five and their lead over the Tigers dropped to two-and-a-half games. The two teams finish the season with three games at Detroit next weekend. 
Jim Walewander started the 13th with a walk off Jose Nunez, 5-2, the fifth of six Toronto pitchers. W alewander went to second on Lou Whitaker's sacrifice and scored when Gib­son's soft fly ball bounced off the artificial turf and over cen­ter fielder Lloyd Moseby's head.

said even though the plays were successful, they were not a surprise. 
"We worked on that in prac­tice because Louisville did the same thing last week and we made some corrections late in the week," he said. "Those plays were · just blown coverages." 
Purdue may not have been surprised by the plays, btit Johnson said he was. 
"Purdue double-teamed Tim Brown the whole game and that opened things up for me," l)e said. "Tim is such a team player and he gave up his num­bers today for the team. I was surprised to see the ball so much today because it's not normally in the game plan, es­pecially for me to catch the ball out of the backfield so much." 
After Andrysiak fumbled on the first drive of the second half, the offense dominated, scoring four times and controll­ing the line of scrimmage. 
"(At halftime) we went over what we could run against them," said Irish center Chuck Lanza. "We knew that we could run many plays at will. It was just a matter of going out there and not defeating ourselves. We beat ourselves in the first half. It was just a matter of coming in here and saying 'hey, let's get together.' 
"You like to establish the run. No tricks. You know the ball's coming right up the middle. That's what a 4-3

defense is. You line up on that side and show us what you got. That's the way we like to play." 
That attitude was put to use when the Irish found them­selves down, 20-17, in the third quarter with the ball at their own nine. A screen to Green was good for 21 yards on the first play. Eleven straight run­ning plays put the ball in the end zone and Notre Dame would not trail again. Johnson, Green, Pernell Taylor and Tony Brooks consistently pounded into the Boiler­makers' defense to sustain the drive. 
Compared to that long, me­thodical drive, the next Irish scoring attack was completed in no time. Twenty-three seconds to be exact. 
Tim Brown, 'held' to 148 total yards, beat freshman Steve Jackson for a 49-yard touch­down after another long at­tempt to Johnson just missed. 
"We threw an out-and-up pass to Tim Brown early in the game and it was overthrown," said Holtz. "Brown said he could beat his defender on a down-and-up pattern pattern if he was given another chance. That's when he scored his touchdown." 
That gave the Irish a 31-20 lead that sealed the game. For the offense, the three miscues could not dim its best perfor­mance of the season. 
"They're good," said Purdue head coach Fred Akers. "They made the big play just enough to keep their drives alive. That kept our defense out on the field and then they really wore us down."

Invitational tests Irish tennis 
By STEVE MEGARGEE Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame women's tennis team received some good news and bad news during this weekend's individual­flight Irish Invitational at Courtney Courts. 
On the positive side, the Irish saw strong play from freshman Ce Ce Cahill and junior Natalie Illig for a second consecutive week, the recovery of fresh­man Anne-Marie Dega from in­jury and an encouraging debut performance from freshman Cathy Bradshaw. 
However, Notre Dame also suffered two major setbacks, as fourth-seeded sophomore Alice Lohrer and sixth-seeded sophomore Resa Kelly were sidelined for the rest of the fall season. Lohrer will undergo arthroscopic surgery on her knee this week, and Kelly will receive final word on her status tomorrow after reinjuring a knee on Sunday. Kelly was ahead, 6-3, 5-l, in her match before her knee gave out.

problem before, and now they think there's a cartilage prob­lem too," said Irish head coach Michele Gelfman. "We're hoping we'll have her back by January. 
"I give Alice the purple heart for the weekend," added Gelfman, "because she was hurting, and she didn't com­plain once. She didn't want to let the team down and her partner down. By the time we went to doubles play, she was hurting really bad." 
While Lohrer and Kelly be­came new names on Notre Dame's injured list, Cahill was busy adding names to her per­sonal list of victims. Proving her championship perfor­mance the previous weekend at the Midwest Invitational was anything but a fluke, Cahill blew past her four opponents to win her singles draw. Cahill won her first two matches by scores of 6-2, 6-0, and 6-1, 6-1, won 6-2, 6-0 in the semi-finals on Saturday, then blew past Purdue's Erica Adams in Sun­day's final, 6-2, 6-0. 
"She has more intensity than

anyone I've ever seen and more determination than anyone I've ever seen," Gelfman said. "I didn't expect it to be quite so easy for her. Erica Adams is a ranked player. The scores weren't close, but it took about four games in the set for her to get into her rhythm." 
Cahill contributed to both Notre Dame championships over the weekend, as she teamed with sophomore Step­hanie Tolstedt to take the second-seeded doubles flight title. Cahill and Tolstedt fell be­hind 0-5 in the first set of the finals, and roared back to win the match 7-6, 6-0. 
"They were down 5-0, and I told them that I was going to watch some other matches and they'd have to settle this be­tween themselves," Gelfman said. "They were down 5-2 in the tiebreaker also. It was in­credible. They had so much momentum and adrenaline that they just destroyed them and ate them alive in the second set." 
Illig, who won her singles flight at the Midwest Invita­tional last weekend, took second this weekend. In the 
same bracket, Bradshaw placed third in her first taste of college competition, losing only to Illig in the semi-finals. Dega, who was out with an in­jury to her foot and a scratched cornea early in the season, also got her first experience of col­lege play. "For Natalie, it goes to show how she's improved her perfor­mance. She's gotten progres­sively better, and has held up very well in tight situations," said Gelfman. "l was very pleased with Bradshaw. She really rose to the occasion. Dega had a slow start this weekend, but finished up strong. I look for bright things from both of them." Notre Dame's other top finis­her was freshman Kim Pacel­la.

Akers said. "They were a little too much for us physically when they started pounding it at us. 
"I thought the two turning points were the interception (a Stan Smagala inteception after which the Irish scored on Johnson one-yard plunge) which tied the game and sent them in into halftime with some momentum. Then we regained the momentum, and they needed another (score). They got what seemed like a 100-yard drive. They engineered a very good offensive drive. I think that took a lot out of us, and showed us some of their depth." 
The Irish opened the scoring on a Ted Gradel 25-yard field goal in the first quarter. They then went up 10-0 on Johnson's first touchdown run, this one for six yards, to cap off an 11­play, 81-yard drive. Johnson finished with 69 yards on 14 carries and two pass receptions of 51 and 39 yards -both of which figured prominently in the Irish scoring drives. 
At that point it looked as if the battle for the Shillelagh (trophy given to winner of Notre Dame-Purdue game) would be a shellacking, but the Boilers came back on two second-quarter touchdowns ­the· first scores the Irish had allowed in an opening half this season. The first score came on an eight-yard pass from Doug Downing to Brad Schumacher who had fallen on the play. 
"I was either tripped or just fell down," Schumacher said. "You've got to give Doug credit for hanging in there and stick­ing with me. I saw the ball com­ing when I was on the ground and had just enough time so I shot up and got it." 
The Boilers scored again less 
than two minutes later after 
Jerrol Williams intercepted 
Andrysiak. Two plays later, 
Downing hit a streaking Calvin 
Williams at the goal line form 
22 yards out to Boilers up, 14-10. 
Briggs hit an 18-yard field 
goal after a Green fumble to 
increase the Purdue lead to 17­
10 before the Irish knotted the 
game at the half. 
"We were just executing well," Downing said. "It felt good. I was really fired up to play Notre Dame-and it's nice to do well -but you remember that later. You always remem­ber you lost the Notre Dame game the last time you played them and that's tough." 
After going up 24-20, the Irish scored again on a 49-yard hook up between Andrysiak and Tim Brown. Two more Gradel field goals (from 49 and 28 yards) and Corny Southall's 57-yard interception return sealed the Boilers' fate. 
"It was a fine game," Holtz said in retrospect. "We got down 17-10, and I didn't know how our football team would react. I sort of liked what I saw. It was not a great performance by us. I think we had three turn­overs, and they were all criti­cal. 
"We had an awful lot of big plays. I though our defense stif­fened up and made things hap­pen in the second half."

Men's harriers 2nd at Catholic meet 
By GEORGE TRAVERS Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame men's cross country team placed second overall as it hosted the National Catholic Tournament Friday at the Burke Memorial Golf Course. The Irish were beaten out by the favorite, Loyola of Chicago. 
Coach Joe Piane and his har­riers learned an important les­son during the race. The key to winning a race like the Na­tional Catholic is to run as a team, something Notre Dame failed to do. 
Loyola of Chicago was led by Eddie Slowikowski (24: 24) who edged Irish senior Dan Garrett by less than two seconds to place first in the overall race. Other top Loyola runners were Marc Burns (3rd) and Jim Westphal (6th). The Ramblers also placed 13th and 16th to finish with an impressively low score of 39. 
The Irish may have had a chance if they could have stayed together and ran as a team. The only other Irish run­ner in the top ten was sopho­more Mike O'Connor who placed 4th (24: 51). Ron Markezich finished 11th overall for the Irish (25:13). Rounding out the Irish top five were senior Mike Smoron (21st) and freshman Pat Kearns (26th). Notre Dame finished with a total of 64 points. 
The rest of the top ten finish­ing schools were Marquette (121 pts), Fordham (150 pts), Canisius (167), Loras (170), St. Thomas, St. John's, Walsh.and Lewis. The surprise of the race was Loras College who placed sixth despite not having a single runner in the top ten. Loras ran consistently throughout and suprised a lot of people. 
Irish captain Dan Garrett felt Notre Dame ran well, but could have done a lot better if they incorporated more team­work. 
"We learned a lesson yester­day that can help us at the Notre Dame Invitational," said Garrett. "We didn't run as-a group and Loyola did. That was the biggest reason why they beat us. 
"Eddie (Slowikowski) and I shared the lead for most of the race. We were trying to force each other to take the lead during the middle. Then at the end he outkicked me. He did the exact same thing to me last spring in the 1500-meter race. I should have expected it." 
Coach Piane believes Loyola perfectly exemplified how to run a team cross country race. 
"To be a successful cross country team," said Piane, "you've got to run as a pack. All you need is your top 5 guys running well and together. Dan (Garrett) and Mike O'Connor ran together for most of the race but our other runners broke into splinter groups. 
"You've got to compliment Loyola for running such an ag­gressive race. It's obvious that they won because they ran as 


Women runners seventh in meet 
By GREG GUFFEY Sports Writer 

The women's cross country team improved one spot from last year in Friday's National Catholic Championships, but Irish coach Dan Ryan was still not pleased with the seventh-place finish. 
"I'm a little bit disappointed in the time gap between our runners and our finish," Ryan said. "We were beaten by Detroit who we soundly beat two weeks ago at the Detroit Invitational." 
Villanova ran away with the 21-team meet for the second consecutive year with 40 points. Vicki Huber and Kathy Franey took first and second places for the winners. 
"Villanova is still m1ssmg some of its top runners, but still ran a strong race," Ryan said. "They have incredible depth. They have one of the strongest programs in the country." St. Thomas and Depaul tied for second with 102 points. Fordham and Detroit rounded out the top five with 120 and 138 points followed by Holy Cross at 159 and the Irish at 161. Six teams were added to this year's meet and Notre Dame defeated all of them with the exception of Fordham. 
Junior Theresa Rice led the Irish for the second consecu­tive meet with a seventh-place finish. She toured the course in a time of 18:54.8. "There was the opportunity to run well, and she took i~,'' Ryan said. "She was running with the leaders. There's no question she is one of the best runners in the district, but she has a little more speedwork to do." 
Freshman Jenny Ledrick took 20th place with a time of 
19:25.5 and co-captain Julia Merkel finished 23rd at 19:33.3. Rounding out the scoring for the Irish was Kathleen Lehman in 43rd place and Wendy Mur­ray in 67th. 
Ryan and his team still felt the effects of the injury to junior Terry Kibelstis, one of the top runners. 
The Irish will host the 10­team Notre Dame Invitational Friday at Burke Memorial Golf Course.

Irish overcome 
pesky Boilermakers, 44-20 

Anthony Johnson does the-high step as he enters the endzone In Notre Dame's 44-20 win over Purdue on Saturday. Johnson scored three touchdowns on runs of 6, 1, and 8 yards. 
Offense kicks into gear for the win 
By RICK RIETBROCK Sports Writer 

WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. · More than in any other game this season, Notre Dame got their points the old­fashioned way against Purdue. They earned them. 
The Irish piled up 476 yards of total offense in surviving a first-half scare in Saturday's 44-20 win over the Boiler­makers. Unlike Notre Dame's previous two games, the defense did not give the ball to the offense in opportune field position this time. Not counting Corny Southall's interception return and Mike Griffin's fumble recovery on Purdue's 10-yard line in the fourth quarter, the offense scored on drives of 57, 81, 72, 81, and 49 yards. 
The offense's stick-it-to-them perfor­
mance, especially in the second half, 
was a welcomed sight for Head Coach 
Lou Holtz. 

"Once we got decent field position, we were going to establish a beach­head," he said. "We were going toes­tablish a running game. We were for­tunate enough in that situation to do it. 
"We had some great runs, some great blocking and/ it's probably the most crisp that we've looked this entire year." 
It appeared as though the Irish were returning to habits of earlier years in the first half. The offense gained 276 yards, but turned the ball over twice in the second quarter, setting the stage for 10 Purdue points. 
First, an Andrysiak pass was inter­cepted by Jerrol Williams on the third play after Purdue's first touchdown. Purdue scored a touchdown two plays later to take a 14-10 lead. 
Next, a 61-yard drive by the second unit ended at Purdue's 22 when Mark Green couldn't keep control of a Tony Rice pitch. Williams was there again to recover the ball for the Boiler­makers. 

Irish whip Bowling Green, 
By BRIAN O'GARA Sports Writer 

The Notre Dame volleyball team continued its winning ways this weekend,' defeating Bowling Green and improving its record to 11-2. 
The Irish won the contest in a three-game sweep, winning 15-3, 15-7, 15-9, and are cur­rently riding a seven-game winning streak. Off to its best start ever, Notre Dame also seems to be improving as it heads into a difficult week of four matches. 
"We played well in spots and poorly in others," said Head Coach Art Lambert, "but I noticed a distinct improvement over our play in the Bradley match last week." 
The lrtsh were led by Mary Kay Waller's 19 kills, a career high for the 6-0 junior. Zanette Bennett, also a junior, re­corded 17 kills and pulled out 12 digs to help the Notre Dame defensive cause. 
As a team, the Irish hit for a .476 kill percentage, their best hitting performance since set­ting a school record .539 last October 3 against Marquette. 
"It took us too long to adjust in the first game," said Lam­bert, "but we played well as the match went on. We did a good job covering up on defense. They are working to­gether as a team -with six people out there blending and working together to help each other out." 
Notre Dame now enters a busy week of volleyt>ail, oegin­ning at Northwestern on Wed­nesday. The Wildcats are cur­rently ranked No. 15 in the nation, and will be a challeng­ing test for the Irish, who are looking to break into national rankings themselves. 

On Thursday, Notre Dame will face DePaul in Chicago, then travel to Butler for a Friday evening match. The Irish return home on Saturday for a 7:30 P.M. match with Iowa. 
"This is crunch time," Lam­bert said. "This is where we begin to find out just what we're made of. Mter this -~

seven-game winning streak. 
Those miscues kept the Irish from taking a lead in the first half and dimmed some of the offense's bright spots. 
Mark Green rushed for 48 yards, but the big plays were provided by fullback Anthony Johnson. The sophomore scored on six-and one-yard runs and also hauled in two passes for 90 yards, beating Purdue linebackers badly. 
"We felt that they would double cover Timmy Brown and we'd be able to get the fullback open," said Holtz. "We did have people open, but that's the risk you take. There were two and even three guys on Timmy. That means you're going to get some other people open. It wasn't any stroke of genius. I'd have done the same thing Purdue did. We'd never gone to our fullback. We'd never made any threat that we might even be going deep with him."

2nd-half surge keys victory 
By DENNIS CORRIGAN Sports Editor 
WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind.-For the 
first time this young season, the Notre 
Dame was put to the test Saturday at 
Purdue. Going into the lockeroom at 
halftime tied at 17, The Irish did a little 
cramming and came back to pass with 
flying colors. 
Behind Anthony Johnson's three 
scoring runs, the Irish rallied twice to 
defeat Purdue, 44-20, and kept their 
record a perfect 3-0. The loss kept the 
Boilers winless at 0-2-1. 
The Irish had two turnovers in the 
first half and opened up the second with 
a Terry Andrysiak fumble on their sixth 
play. The Boilers went back on top 
when Jonathan Briggs kicked a 50-yard 
field goal, the second longest in Purdue 
history and the longest ever in Ross­
Ade Stadium. 
Then the Irish went to work. Starting 
on their own nine, the Irish drove the 
rest of the field to go on top for good 
on Johnson's third score of the game. 
Except for an opening screen pass from 
Andrysiak to Mark Green for 21 yards, 
the drive was straight ahead running. 
"The 91-yard drive (officially 81 be­
cause of a dead-ball penalty after the 
kick-off return) after they went ahead 
20-17 and we started first and 20 on our 
nine was very critical," Notre Dame 
head coach Lou Holtz said afterward. 
"We came in at halftime, and I told our 
offensive line if we don't win this foot­
ball game I'm not going to give you the 
chance to say we didn't do it." 
The 12-play drive consumed 4: 56 of 
the third quarter and from there the 
Irish defense limited the Boilers to just
