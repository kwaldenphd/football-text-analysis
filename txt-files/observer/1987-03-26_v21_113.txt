WASHINGTON -Senate Democrats, after failing a third time to choke off a Republican­led filibuster, abandoned on Wednesday their drive to force President Reagan to fully ac­count for all assistance flowing to Nicaragua's Contra rebels. 
The Senate vote of 54-46 in favor of cutting off the filibuster was six votes short of the total needed to end debate. However, it provided evidence that there may be a Senate majority ready to reject new aid installments. 
"The vote bodes well for hal­


ting Contra aid next fall," said Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., the deputy Democratic leader. 
"The 54 majority vote to stop the filibuster clearly reflects the erosion of support for the Contras," Cranston said. "It shows the growing concern over the cover-up of what hap­pened to the money for the Con­tras, money that has either vanished or gone into illegal channels." 
Senate Democratic Leader Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., was more cautious. 
He had said earlier in the week he wanted to show that a "constitutional majority" of at least 51 votes could be rallied against Contra aid. 
But Byrd told reporters on Wednesday that reaching that

Senate floor this fall. 
"The $105 million will have a hard time," Byrd said. "But events between now and then could affect votes -including mine." 
He cited possible new dis­closures or conclusions from the congressional investiga­tions of the Iran-Contra affair as well as unexpected events in Central America. 
At the same time, Byrd renewed appeals for the Reagan administration to "get behind" the peace proposals of Costa Rican President Oscar Arias and to shift emphasis away from current policies which he said place excessive reliance on military force. 
Sen. Edward Kennedy, D­Mass., said Wednesday's vote made clear that "the handwrit­ing is on the wall that the cur­rent installment of U.S. mili­tary aid is the last installment." 
"I urge the administration to use the coming months to move away from its failed policy of military victory as quickly as possible, and to develop the sort of bipartisan diplomatic initiative that is worthy of the United States and our proper role in the hemisphere," Ken­nedy said. 
The filibuster by Contra-aid supporters prevented action on a House-passed resolution to freeze a $40 million aid install­
ment, origmauy approveu 1a:sL year, to permit time for a full accounting of all money, private as well as public, which has reached the Contras. 

Arrest of espionage suspect triggers wide security probe 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -The arrest of a second Marine suspected of espionage while working as an embassy guard in Moscow has triggered a wide-ranging security probe at the embassy, the State Department said Wednesday. 
"We are treating this as a very serious breach of our se­curity," said spokesman Charles Redman, referring to the arrest of Cpl. Arnold Bracy, 21, from the New York City borough of Queens. 
"A full-scale counter­intelligence investigation is being conducted in coordina­tion with other appropriate federal agencies. We're looking at every aspect of se­curity at the embassy in Mos­cow." 
The corps said Bracy had been arrested because of evidence uncovered in the con­tinuing probe of Sgt. Clayton Lonetree, 25, a former guard arrested in December on spying charges. 
The corps said the two men worked together in Moscow from July 1985 to March 1986. 
Lonetree has been accused of passing to the Russians the names and photographs of American intelligence agents attached to the Moscow embas­sy's staff. He also has been accused of providing the Soviets with descriptions of floor plans and office assign­ments for the embassies in Moscow and Vienna, where he also worked as a guard. 
Redman said the State De­partment had launched "a worst-case damage assess­ment so that every aspect of security at our embassy in Moscow will be investigated as a result of these two cases." 
"We have no reason to believe that this is a worldwide problem," Redman added. "We have 1,400 Marines sta­tioned at 134 posts throughout the world" and "this is the first incident of this type in our 40­year relationship with the

Drug tests: An infringement on rights of players, workers 
Imagine the dilemma. 
As time is running out, the university's star point guard is dribbling down the court. The score is tied. His basket would win the game for his team. He glances at the clock. He glances to the left and sees his coach. He glances to the right and sees the NCAA drug marshall. Sud­
denly, sinking the basket and winning the game 
does not seem like as good of a deal: The win­ning team's players must face the little bottles. 
In this year's NCAA basketball tournament, association officials have instituted a drug test­ing program which has caused perhaps the highest degree of personal embarrassment and the greatest amount of personal infringement on a citizen's rights that has of yet occurred in such a program. 
After each game, the winning team has about 10 minutes or so to celebrate and have their post-game talk. Then, as the players hit the showers, the NCAA "marshalls" begin to come into the lockerroom. 
Each of the eight marshalls is assigned to a player -the five starters, the two substitutes with the most playing time, and a randomly­chosen player. 
As the players come out of the showers, the marshalls check their clipboards and have the staff point out which player is which. And even as they dress, uncomfortable players must en­dure the glances of marshalls from across the room. 
The staff and the other players board the bus and return to the motel. The chosen eight are taken next door for "testing." 
College tests are never easy and some players have found drug tests to be no exception. Dehydration sometimes leads to an embarrass­ing situation which no person should ever have to face. The players are "detained" until they give a sample. 
Of course, the marshalls provide distilled water and apple juice to hurry things along. But some players still have ended up staying at the test site for hours into the morning. 
There also has been controversy about the penalties involved. Currently, a player who tests positive is excluded from further playoff competition, but there is no penalty for the team as a whole. They don't have to forfeit the game. The NCAA may institute team sanctions next year. ' 
Besides just having their pride hurt, some players may be hurting themselves physically. Because coaches are unsure of the test's sen­sitivity, some coaches have forbidden players who have the flu from taking even aspirin for fear that it might cause a positive drug test reading. 
But in most cases, the main effect of the test-

ing of basketball players has been public em­
barrassment. While no person should have to 
put up with this humiliation and violation of his 
rights, the "side-effects" of drug testing for bas­
ketball players are just short-term. 
Other people, about whom we rarely hear, may be facing long-term problems because of drug testing. Government agencies and private corporations have begun to give their employees drug tests. In many cases the result of a positive test is dismissal from work. Despite the fad that the accuracy of these tests is uncertain at times, many companies use the results as a license to put a detour in some­body's career path. 
These people could also complain that their rights are being violated, but, in a practical sense, there is much more involved here than just a matter of principle. It is a matter of livelihood. 
The NCAA testing program may have focused national attention on drug-testing, but the col­lege basketball player who suffers embarrass­ment doesn't have nearly as much to lose as does the corporation employee who doesn't use drugs but tests positive. 
It's scary to think that an employee who is asked to fill a little bottle might soon be filling a cardboard box with the things he emptied from his desk.

sition that sex discrimination, like race discrimination, can be remedied by the use of af­firmative action measures," said Judith Lichtman, execu­tive director of the Women's Legal Defense Fund. 
As it has in a series of affirm­ative action cases, the court rejected the Reagan adminis­tration's position. Justice De­partment lawyers had argued that individual rights should not be sacrificed in the interest of "casual social engineering." 
The court rejected an appeal by Paul Johnson, who was denied promotion to road dis­patcher by the Santa Clara County Transportation Agency in California. 
The job went to Diane Joyce, who Johnson said was less qualified than himself. 
The court said Johnson, who scored two points higher than Joyce on a test, may have been minimally more qualified for the job. But the justices empha­sized their ruling does not mean unqualified people will be hired or promoted. 
"Sex is but one of several fac­tors that may .be taken into ac­count in evaluating qualified applicants for a position," Justice William Brennan wrote for the court. 
The court's dissenters said the ruling perverts the 1964 law "into a powerful engine of rac­ism and sexism."

Three chained women discovered in basement 
Associated Press 
PHILADELPHIA -Three nude women were found chained to a sewer pipe Wenes­day in the basement of a rowhouse and police said they found body parts elsewhere in the house that may represent two bodies. 
A fourth woman escaped from the house during the night and summoned police, who said the women, aged 18 to 24, may have been chained for up to three months. 
Body parts were found in the refrigerator, in the oven and in a stewpot in the kitchen, police said. Homicide Sgt. Robert Snyder said officers also searched near Camden, N.J., for a possible third body. 
Neighbors said they had complained to police about noise and a smell of burning flesh, but police said they had no records of such complaints. 
Gary Heidnik, 43, who lived in the rowhouse for about two years, was arrested and charged with rape, kidnapping and aggravated assault. No homicide charges were filed. 
One of the women held in the basement said she believed two women she knew only by first names died there, one in a fall and the other by electrocution. The Philadelphia Daily News reported that the woman said Heidnik attached electrical wires to the chains of the electrocuted woman. 
Capt. Robert Grasso said police do not know how the people died. "The investigation is just commencing. There are many aspects about which we do not know enough." 
One of the women held in the basement, Lisa Thomas, 19, said she lost 40 to 50 pounds through the ordeal. 
"He was digging holes on the ceiling to hang us, for punish­ment," she said. Handcuffs were placed through loops that 
would  suspend  the  women  
above  the  ground,  Thomas  
said.  

Thomas also told of sexual abuse and beatings. She said one woman fell, injured herself and later died. She said their captor carried the body away and "I think he burned it."

DRN<ING AND DRIVING CAN KILL A FRIENDSHIR 
Thomas said at first she went willingly with the man, who had a flashy car and a lot of money. 
Rosa Sauris, who frequently visits her son in the neighbor­hood, said there were "a lot of girls going in and out" of the rowhouse. "One was always with him," she said. "We never saw some of them come out." 
Sauris also said she could smell burning flesh "sometimes at 2 a.m., some­times at 9 a.m. The smell was so terrible, everybody com­plained and called police. But when they came out -they did nothing." 
"We in this office have no knowledge of anybody com­plaining," said Detective Ed­
ward Tenuto, of the department's public affairs of­fice. 
Catharine Wainwright, who lives with her daughter of the same name five doors away from the house, said the smell persisted for more than a week. 
Of the four women held cap­tive, Grasso said one was ab­ducted in November. 
Three of the women were taken to Episcopal Hospital where one was treated and released. The other two were in stable condition, suffering from malnutrition and dehydration, said Anthony Cirillo, hospital spokesman. 
Snyder  said  Heidnik  was  
stopped by poli ce  as  he  was  
driving  away  from  the  
row house.

U.S. refuses trade deal for release of hostages 
Associated Press 
BEIRUT, Lebanon -The wife of American hostage Alann Steen, whose captors say he is ill and may die soon, pleaded Wednesday for his release. 
There was no word of a Frenchman whose captors withdrew a threat of death, then said they might kill him after all. 
In the plea for her 47-year-old husband, Virginia Rose Steen said kidnappers "should release people that are sick so the person can get the best medical treatment possi­ble. . . . I hope he would be released very soon." 
Steen is held by an organiza­tion calling itself Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine, which said Monday he was very ill and "may die in 10 days." 
It offered to trade him for 100 Arab prisoners held in Israel and demanded the United States intercede with Israel. The U.S. and Israeli govern­ments refused the deal. 
Another group, the Revolu­tionary Justice Organization, has renewed its threat to kill Jean-Louis Normandin, a 35­year-old French television lighting engineer kidnapped March 8, 1986. 
"The organization an­nounces that the execution of the spy, Normandin, was not postponed and was not can­celed," the organization said in a statement issued Tuesday. The group is believed to consist of Shiite extremists loyal to Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. 
On Monday the kidnappers released a videotape in which Normandin said his abductors had decided to spare his life. They previously threatened to kill him Tuesday. 

Al-Ittihad, a newspaper in the Persian Gulf emirate of Abu Dhabi, quoted "well­informed diplomatic sources" as saying Syrian troops deployed in west Beirut had lo­cated Steen and the three other men kidnapped with him in Jan­uary.

Injustices eliminated by people's awareness 
Recently, Saint Mary's com­memorated the one-year anniversary of the overthrow of the Marcos govern­ment with a series of events as part of Philippine Awareness Week. For some, myself included, the events were basi­cally a crash course in recent Philip­pine history and a look at the reality of this unique revolution. 
Mary Ann White 
guest column 

The coup came at a time when, among other problems, the poverty level in the Philippines was nearly 60 percent. While thousands suffered from hunger and deprivation, Ferdinand Marcos successfully silenced his oppo­sition for almost 14 years as his wife Imelda collected her 5,000 pairs of shoes. 
As part of Philippine Awareness Week, the video entitled "The February Revolution" gave an up-close perspec­tive on the revolution. The video, filmed with hand-held cameras, depicted many scenes of the human barricades that formed to protect the rebels inside the Marcos palace. Because of these barricades, government tanks were un­able to penetrate the crowds. 
For me, these human barricades were the most striking aspect of the video. The word "revolution" immedi­ately conjures up images of massive chaos, camouflaged soldiers and widespread gunfire. But this revolution was different. The "rebels" involved wore Levis, Nikes, and even "al­ligator" shirts. In the background of the barricades were parks, shopping plazas, a Coca-Cola billboard, just like any American city. 
So what relevence does this have for us? There haven't been any tanks moving across U.S. 31. We're not starv­ing. Our elections are legitimate. There are no serious injustices on our college campuses today -or are there? 
True, the "injustices" that occur on our own campuses are far from the massive human rights violations in the Philippines and other parts of the world; for this, we are grateful. But the lesson learned from the Philippines is one of great importance, for when we look at the heart of this revolution, we see ordinary people who had enough courage in defending their opinions to stand up to a wall of tanks and armed soldiers. 
These middle class "rebels" were not all that different from each of us. Not only was their appearance and setting similar, but most likely, they held many of the same sentiments that we do. They were probably comfortable in their middle-class lifestyles. But by standing in solidarity with the op­pressed of their nation, they put their reputations, and more importantly, their lives in jeopardy. 
Here at Saint Mary's and Notre Dame, we are free to speak out on any issue whether it is the suspension of the Scholastic or disbanding of the Dancin' Irish. We do not lay down our lives when voicing our opinions, however, too often we do not utilize this opportunity to its fullest capability. 
Recently, with the furor over the decision to convert Howard Hall into a women's dorm, many students did voice their discontent. We can all un­derstand the University's need for more women's dorms; however, most 
agree that the administration's treat­ment of the situation was far from ap­propriate. The University told Howard residents of its decision only two weeks before Christmas break. Students that planned to study abroad this semester were given only two weeks to search for housing for next year. Other resi­dents must find space in one of the other dorms or off-campus. Still, the number of students who seriously questioned the administration seems small in com­parison to those who found a month's supply of jokes in the situation. Making light of a situation is one way of coping with it, but does the University now think that it can handle future decisions in a similiar manner since most stu­dents will choose to laugh it off? 
Financial aid, or rather the lack of it in most cases, is another source of in­justice that many students experience. Decisions made by Congress seem far removed from the reality of paying ex­orbitant tuitions. Still, few students voice their discontent over the system. The power in the Philippines came from the voice of the people who came out by the thousands to stand in oppo­sition. Imagine the power if, across the nation, students stood together to op­pose the government's unjust system of financial aid that has failed to com­pensate for the sky-rocketing costs of then, more people will begin question­a college education. ing those that are responsible for these

P.O.BoxQ 
Hickey is responsive to students' requests 
Dear Editor: 
On the Thursday before break, I met with William Hickey, director of Uni­versity Food Service, to discuss proposals regarding weekend guest meal passes, the alleviation of the mass influx of students to North Dining Hall during finals, and extended breakfast times among other things. I also brought him suggestions on the renova­tion of North Dining Hall which is slated to take place the next two summers. 
I want to take this opportunity to publicly thank Hickey for his receptive­ness, sincere concern and his quick ac­tion on the implementation of several of the proposals. For instance, before I even finished my arguments for weekend guest meal passes, Hickey was on the phone to his secretary as­king her to call the printer and have 500 "Weekender Meal Passes" made up which would encompass Friday din­ner, Saturday brunch and dinner, and Sunday brunch at a 20 percent discount off the individual meal rate. These should now be available at the dining halls to purchase for a guest coming up for the weekend. Beside the discount, the "Weekender" also alleviates the hassle of paying for individual meals while in line. Hickey also extended weekday hot breakfasts by 15 minutes and told me if I could show him tangible support for some of the other proposals, he would not hesitate to implement them. 
When we were discussing the North Dining Hall renovation, he pulled out all the blueprints and showed me ex­actly what was going to happen. I pre­
sented some suggestions such as in­
stalling heaterA10t air blowers in the 
door ways, and he assured me he would 
talk to the architect about them. I can 
assure you that North Dining Hall is 
going to be a much better place. 
Thank you William Hickey and also 
Debra Lemke, manager of North 
Dining Hall, for listening and acting on 
many of the suggested improvements. 
We really appreciate it.

Students have chance to view Hesburgh finale 
Dear Editor: 
The mailing by the St. Joseph Valley 
Notre Dame Club of invitations to all 
local alumni to attend a Century Center 
downlinking of Father Hesburgh's 
valedictory telecast May 9 has resulted 
in many calls to University Relations 
Offices inquiring about campus 
downlink sites. 
There will be two campus sites where 
faculty, students and staff can see the 
program "A Notre Dame Moment" 
without charge. As part of "Senior 
Week," the seniors will be sponsoring 
a downlink of the satellite-delivered 
telecast in the ACC, and all students 
are invited. Faculty and staff and their 
spouses are invited to a downlink in the 
Center for Continuing Education. 
The program, which will also include 
a 16-minute videotape retrospective on 
Father Hesburgh's career narrated by 
Walter Cronkite, will start at 8 p.m. 
(EST) and is expected to last about one 
hour.

Negotiations 



In progress for umpires 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK-Major league baseball teams were repor­tedly lining up substitute um­pires should the regulars strike at the beginning of the season. 
"What I did is alert the clubs that negotiations are in prog­ress, they haven't been re­solved and, with the season coming up, they had to find out who is available and who isn't," American League Pres­ident Bobby Brown was re­ported as saying in Tuesday's editions of The New York Times. 
A national League spokes­man said the league had "not sent a bulletin" to its clubs, but refused to comment when asked if the league's teams had been told to arrange for substi­tute umpires. 
The major league umpires contract has expired and negotiations have made little progress thus far. The umpires have not threatened a walkout.

Clemens continues hold out 
Associated Press 
SPRING, Texas -Boston pitcher Roger Clemens said Wednesday he remained resolute in his 19-day contract holdout and accused Red Sox management of trying to use him as an example for the rest of the league. 
"I want them to recognize what I did on the field last year and they are not doing that," Clemens said during a news conference at his agents' of­fice. 
Asked if he was prepared to sit out the season, Clemens' agent Randy Hendricks an­swered saying, "The question should be are the Red Sox ready to go through a full season without Roger Clemens." 
The American League Cy Young Award winner earned $340,000 last year on a base salary of $220,000 and an added $120,000 in incentives. 
He sought a new contract for $1 million over one year or $2.4 million over two years. 
Clemens has since lowered his demand to $950,000 for one year but the Red Sox have of­fered him a $500,000 base salary and $350,000 in incentive clauses. 
AkerS: Texas charges 'minor' 
Associated Press 
DALLAS -Former University of Texas football Coach Fred Akers has described allega­tions by the NCAA committee on Infractions against the Lon­ghorns program as minor. 
Akers moved to Purdue as coach last December after being fired following his lOth year as Texas' coach. He said in a telephone interview Tues­day from West Lafayette, Ind., that he still believes Texas al­ways has conducted its football program properly. 
"I tend to agree with DeLoss Dodds <UT athletic director) that all of these are minor al­legations," said Akers. "These are an accumulation of small things over a long period that could happen almost anywhere you have a major program." 
The 62 violations released by the school Monday in a report included cash loans to players never exceeding more than $200 at a time, ticket scalping, free legal and dental services, free meals and excessive recruiting contacts. 
Allegations involved eight former and present members of the athletic department. Among those named are Akers and David McWilliams, a former UT assistant who returned to Texas as coach after one year at Texas Tech. 
Also named are former UT assistants Scott Walker and Tommy Reaux, now working on Akers' staff at Purdue.

Coach Jerry Tarkanian, who preceded the team to New Or­leans Tuesday night told boosters earlier in the day he "never thought about the Final Four until last week. Then it dawned on me 'we're only two games away."' 
Tarkanian last took a team to the Final Four in Atlanta 10 years ago, where it lost in the semifinals to North Carolina 84-83. 
"This has been a special team from day one," Tarkanian told the boosters. 
He said he planned to turn the team loose for some celebrating in the famed French Quarter Wednesday night. 
"I told them they could stay out until 1 a.m. but they're negotiating for 2," Tarkanian laughed, "and they're such a great bunch of kids I'll prob­ably give in."

NEW ORLEANS -Members of the No.l-ranked Nevada-Las Vegas Runnin' Rebels flew to New Orleans Wednesday for an afternoon practice, a night on the town and Saturday's meeting with Indiana in the semifinals of the Final Four. 
"For you Runnin' Rebels on board, I want you to give Bobby Knight something to whine about,'' the captain of the American Airlines flight carry­ing the Rebels said as the plane landed in Dallas for a chan­geover. 
The Rebels, 37-1, meet the third-ranked Hoosiers, 28-4, in the second game of Saturday's playoffs. 
Some 200 fans turned out at McCarran International Air­port in Las Vegas to see the team leave on an early mor­ning flight. Sleepy-eyed players gave television inter­views before boarding the aircraft, then signed autographs as they walked down the plane's aisle. The flight left 30 minutes late as players and fans straggled on board. 
"I'm going in with the atti­tude I want to win it all, not just be here," said senior for­ward Armon Gilliam. "It's a heck of an accomplishment to be here. We knew we had the potential to be here. We just didn't know if we'd reach that potential. 
"The chemistry was there," Gilliam added. 
The 6-foot-9 Gilliam then stretched out in a first-class seat, pulled a jacket over his head and slept much of the trip. Shorter players, relegated to the back of the plane, did the same. 
Jarvis Basnight, a junior for­ward from Detroit, said the Rebels had achieved a goal they set early in the year by getting to New Orleans. 
"I don't know how to react at this point, but we'll probably begin to feel it when we get into the flow of things," Basnight

UNLV's Jarvis Basnight (44) and Gary Graham (32) look to celebrate two more victories with the Runnin' Rebels as the NCAA Tournament winds down. 
Associated Press 
LAS VEGAS, Nev. -Las Vegas bookmakers have turned cheerleaders with their hometown team in the NCAA final Four, despite the possible loss of millions of dollars in bets on the championship game. 
Bookmakers are unabas­hedly rooting for the Nevada­Las Vegas Runnin' Rebels, seemingly glad to swallow the lost bets in the name of com­munity pride. UNLV plays In­diana University on Saturday. 
"It would do more for the town for them to win than for us to take a few lousy bets on the game," said Keith Glantz, sports book manager at the Palace Station. 
Nevada gaming regulations forbid betting on amateur teams located within the state, meaning UNLV's advance­ment to the Final Four will cost sports books bets on one of Sat­urday's two games and pos­sibly the championship game itself. 
That doesn't seem to bother most bookmakers, who say the lost bets will be more than made up for by increased na­tional attention for the city. 
"I'm tickled pink we've got a team that well represents our community," said Mel Exber, owner of the Las Vegas Club. "I've talked to a lot of custom­ers around here. Nobody's complaining.'' 
Betting on the NCAA cham­pionship game generally ranks in the top five major betting events of the year, trailing the World Series and Super Bowl in betting volume among con­tinuing events. 
But bookmakers say the mere fact a lot of money is bet on a game doesn't necessarily mean they will win much money. 
"A lot of people think it's going to be extremely costly to sports books but I don't think so," said Sonny Reizner, who runs the Castaways sports book. "First of all, it's only one ballgame. And you can win or lose the game." 
Reizner said bookmakers operate on a 4.5 percent profit margin if they pick the game correctly and adjust bets ac-

"We're not necessarily going to lose any revenue," agreed Glantz. "And, if they allowed betting on UNLV we could take a bath because the people in this town will bet the Rebels no matter what the point spread is." 
Glantz said most book­makers he has talked with around the city are rooting for UNLV. He said he was trying to get tickets for himself to go to the games in New Orleans. 
"The town would rather see them win than take a bet on them," said Glantz. "It's our team. We don't have a pro team here and the town goes crazy over the Rebels.

Hoosier fans hold rally in Bloomington square 

Associated Press 
BLOOMINGTON, Ind. -In­diana University basketball fans rallied in the courthouse square Wednesday evening, sending up 1,100 red and white balloons along with their hopes for a successful Hoosier trip to the NCAA final Four in New Orleans this weekend. 
"I think everybody is pretty confident," said Mick Hayes as he held one of his four sons, all clad in IU sweatshirts, on a closed section of Kirkwood Av­enue a short distance from the campus. "People think we can do it this time." 
The crowd filled most of the closed block and part of the courthouse yard, yelling and waving red pompons as the school's pep band and cheer­leaders performed in the brisk, 45-degree wind. 
An Indianapolis television station's news helicopter circled over the downtown as the rally got underway at dusk. 
Ken Dwigans yelled himself almost hoarse trying to keep up with the megaphone-toting cheerleaders who shouted: "N­C-Double-A, Indiana all the way." 
"This team's been down a lot during the year, but we've al­ways been able to come back," said Dwigans. "We're lucky to be in the Final Four." 
The Hoosiers are scheduled to leave for New Orleans about noon on Friday, and another rally is scheduled for 11:30 a.m. at Assembly Hall on the campus to see the team off. The 
school's alumni association is 
setting up headquarters at the 
New Orleans Hilton and will 
coordinate a rally there on Sat­
urday, said Chuck Crabb, 
promotion director for the 
athletic department. 
Bartenders from a tavern 
across the street from the 
courthouse stretched a banner 
over the door of the business, 
advertising it as the site of the 
''N.C.A.A. Hoosier Party" Sat­
urday and Monday. 
AndrewS. Ludwig, one of the 
owners of the J. Arthur's, said 
he would have 10 television sets 
and serve up red beer when In­
diana meets the University of 
Las Vegas on Saturday. 
"The excitement is really just now starting," Ludwig said. "They (the fans) know Bobby's got the experience. UNLV has not played the type of physical ball they play in the Big Ten, but they're not to be taken lightly either." 
Nine-year-old Mickey Hayes, who alternately cheered and shivered through Wednesday's rally with his parents and three brothers, said he planned to at­tend the Bob Knight Basketball Camp this summer. 
And between cheers from the 
crowd, he was also ready to 
recite a poem he'd written 
about the coach: 
"There was a guy named Bobby Knight, who got into a fight; 
"He got a tech foul, and went on the prowl; 
"And now they know Bobby Knight was right."

IU bans airplay of Hoosier songs 
Associated Press 

INDIANAPOLIS -Indiana University fans rallied to roar their disapproval Wednesday of an NCAA rule that effec­tively banned from the radio the playing of two songs celebrating the Hoosier basket­ball team. 
"Any song done by any sta­tion anywhere should be able to compliment a team going to the Final Four," disc jockey Gary Harper told a lunchtime crowd of about 200 at Monu­ment Circle in downtown In­dianapolis. 
Harper's station, WEAG­FM, and two other Indiana sta­tions pulled the songs "Bobby Knight Bop" and "Stevie, Shoot A Three-Pointer" from the air at the request of IU of­ficials Tuesday. 
The songs, written by staff

members of the stations, men­tion the names of several mem­bers of the Indiana basketball team that will compete in the Final Four this weekend in New Orleans. 
IU sports promotion director Chuck Crabb said the univer­sity asked that the songs be withdrawn because an NCAA rule forbids the use of a player's name in a commercial venture. Any player so named could be ruled ineligible for Final Fo.ur competition, Crabb said. 
But Harper, his colleague Terry Lee, and many in the crowd questioned the applica­tion of the rule to the songs, which were written without the knowledge or permission of the IU players. 
"I think it's ridiculous," said Marge Poore, 46, an In­dianapolis postal worker who

are the same for both athletes and non-athletes. 
Second, the athlete should have the same academic re­quirements as other students. At that time athletes had to carry a 77 percent average to be eligible for competition. Hesburgh gives several exam­ples of this requirement, one in which two starters of the bas­ketball team had fallen below the average. He called the coach the day before the big Kentucky basketball game to inform him of the situation. The coach asked for just one more day before declaring the players ineligible, but Hes­burgh said, "You've got the word now." 
Third, the athlete should lead the same lifestyle as other col­lege students. Hesburgh uses this point to explain how under­the-table payments can hurt the entire process, saying, "they confront the boy with the worst possible aspect of double­dealing and graft, giving him a disreputable standard of values--and from educational institutions of all places," and, "if the boy wants to play for money, he would get much more from professional teams who are organized to do this." Making these points clear to alumni and friends, he stresses, is very important. 
attended the rally. "They did not ask for their names to be used. They're not getting any money for it." 
"What if another school wanted to sabotage our team?" asked John Golden, 38. "All they'd have to do is write up a silly song and get it played on the radio." 
An NCAA official said that whether the players were paid for the use of their names is immaterial. 
"The issue is not whether (a player) gets any benefit but whether his name is being used,'' Rick Evrard, director of NCAA legislataive services, told The Associated Press in a telephone interview Wednesay. "A student athlete cannot use their name, their picture, or their reputation to promote a commercial product . " 

BUY OBSERVER CLASSIFIEDS 

The issue of commercial ex­ploitation, however, is a toug­her issue for Hesburgh. He says that in the case of a private school, where students (in 1954) pay 65 percent of the cost of running the school, "any con­tribution looks good, even an athletic one." 
But before you can even ask about the danger of making athletics a growing revenue­generator for the school, Res­burgh points out that Notre Dame has declined to partici­pate in a bowl game since 1925 despite the financial rewards because of the time that is taken away from the athletes' studies. 
Of course this position changed in 1970 when Notre Dame went to the Cotton Bowl, but for 45 years this philosophy held. 
Thus Hesburgh concludes his article again with the principle of the athlete and his education. If the focus is kept on four things--the student, the in­tegrity of the institution, foot­ball as just a game and education through athletics, then this principle can be fol­lowed, he says. 
But what about today? Money is definitely the issue in college athletics, and Notre Dame has changed its stance on bowl games. 
But aside from this and a few other anachronisms, Hesburgh gave his opinion a few weeks agp on his 33-year-old testa­mebt to college athletics. 
''I WGUld still write the same thing today," he said.

Ripken sends son Billy to minors 
Associated Press 
MIAMI-Cal Ripken Sr., the stoic manager of the Baltimore Orioles, does not let emotions interfere with his job. 
Just ask Billy Ripken, a son of the first-year skipper and one of 14 players sent back to the minor leagues. 
"There was no father-son to it," the 22-year-old second baseman said. "He said five words to me: 'we are sending you out.'" 
The manager said there was more to it than that, but in­sisted that the individual meetings with all14 players do not tug at his heartstrings. 
"I told Billy the same thing I've been telling kids for years," the father-manager said. "We're doing what's best for him and the team." 
"Sure, it's a disappointment when you get sent down from

a major league club," he said. "But then you realize that it's best that you go out and play ... put on a uniform and go to work." 
Asked how he handled a similar situation as a player, the senior Ripken, a former minor league catcher said: "I was never in a big league camp, so I was never sent out. I was released." 
Manager Ripken, of course, still has one son on his roster, shortstop Cal Jr. 
Billy Ripken, in his first full season at second base, was promoted to the Class AA southern League last season after hitting .268 at Charlotte. He was optioned Monday to Rochester of the Class AAA In­ternational League. 
Ripken said all the players sent out in Baltimore's first roster trimming of the spring Monday had handled them-

After the tournament, the team was offered a chance to play at Bay Hill Country Club, the course owned by PGA legend Arnold Palmer. Playing from the pro tees, all players shot an eighty or less, proving to Coach O'Sullivan that the strong performance in the tournament was far from a fluke and truly demonstrated the potential of this team. 
Yesterday the team held an 18-hole meet with Lewis Uni­versity at Burke Memorial and defeated the visiting linksters, 297 to 307. Medalist for the Irish was sophomore Pat Mohan, firing a 73. The other scores for the Irish were: Dick Connelly 
(74) Doug Giorgio (76), and team captain Chris Bona (76). 
Next on the agenda for the Irish is the Eastern Kentucky Invitational this weekend. This tournament will see a truly huge field as all the teams of the Big Ten and Mid-American Conferences will be in atten­dance as well as all the major independents in the Midwest.

Spring Football '87 


"We've only been practicing three days and so far I'm very pleased with what I've seen," Holtz said after yesterday's practice. "I'm not saying we're a good football team right now, but I think the players have the right attitude and are ready to start working long and hard to make themselves a good foot­ball team." 
In the spring, however, long and hard work is a little differ­ent from what it will be in the fall. Holtz said he does not plan to practice more than about three times a week during the 
"We've got a definite number problem," Holtz said, "and that changes things some. We've got a billion people gone for one reason or another, but I am pleased that there are no serious injuries." 
Holtz said the only thing even resembling an injury to this point was a minor pain in the ankle of sophomore nose tackle Marty Lippincott. 
With all the talk of player suspensions, Proposition 48 victims and top-notch recruit­ing classes for the fall, however, Holtz and the Irish have somehow managed to set their sights on sharpening fun­damentals in the spring drills. 

"It's tough to tell this early how things are coming to­gether," Holtz said, "so what I do is take a look at how certain individuals are coming along. So far I've seen some good things on an individual basis, and I think the offensive line is doing a good job. 
"I've been working with the defense a little more than the offense so far, but I'm basically just looking at everyone right now. Sometimes the defense will come along faster and nothing will go right on the of­fense, or sometimes a good pass rush makes it tough for a quarterback to do anything. I'm not saying that's what's happening in general, but those are the type of things that make 
it difficult to evaluate the team in the spring." 
Some welcome signs on the field yesterday for Irish fans included the healthy running of senior Alonzo Jefferson and sophomore D'Juan Francisco, tailbacks who struggled with injuries last year. And as evidenced by some loud colli­sions and heavy pile-ups whenever a ball found its way to the wet grass, at least the players who are in uniform ap­pear ready to begin the quest to better last season's 5-6 record.

Hesburgh wrote article in Sports Dlustrated's first year 
No.te: _This story was originally intended for the Hesburgh spec,al tssue of The Observer, but due to space limitations, it was withheld from the issue 
Though University President Father Theodore Hesburgh usually refers all athletic matters to his partner Executive Yic~ President Father Edmund Joyce, Hesburgh' is still held m high regard when it comes to college athletics. 
Sport~ Ill~str~ted, for example, has featured Hesburgh many times m his 35 years as president of Notre Dame. One article fe.at~ing his final year as president ran with the Notre Dame-Michigan football story, and just four weeks ago he was quoted on the issue of SMU's probation. 
Pete Gegen 
Assistant Sports Editor 

"He has always been looked up to," says Donald J. Barr, publisher of Sports Illustrated and class of '57 alumnus. "He has let athletics be a total part of the school, rather than the other way around with basketball and football dominating. His opinion is always worth seeking.'' 
While Hesburgh has been a good source for reporters, it is not widely known that as President of Notre Dame, he once turned sports writer and scribed an article about athletics at Notre Dame for Sports Illustrated. 
The article was entitled "The True Spirit of Notre Dame," and it appeared in the Sept. 27, 1954 issue of SI, the seventh issue that the magazine ever published. The table of contents tells the reader to turn to page 16 to read about "the most famous football university in the nation," with Hesburgh ex­plaining "how we try to do it at Notre Dame." 
He begins by issuing a disclaimer that he is not an expert on thge collegiate athletic scene, but rather has "listened to a number of experts" and has come up with his own ideas. 
He then develops the theme which can best be summarized as "the athlete is first a student." In one of my favorite quotes, Hesburgh states, "This does not mean that they should all be Phi Beta Kappas or physics majors, but neither should they be subnormal students majoring in ping-pong." He also ex­plain~ that this theme has three basic conditions, all of which have been applied at Notre Dame. 
First, the athlete must be a qualified student coming out of high school. He notes that at Notre Dame the requirements see HESBURGH, page 13 


Baseball season opener rained out 
By KARA KOONS Sports Writer 
The Irish baseball squad will face Ball State and Indiana in doubleheaders this weekend after their home season opener against Lewis was rained out yesterday. 
"Not playing today definitely hurt," said Head Coach Larry Gallo. "I don't think it will hurt our moment~m, though." 
The Irish are looking forward to their weekend play at Muncie, Ind., Saturday against Ball State and at home Sunday against Indiana. The Irish dropped their first three games of the season to the Hoosiers. 
"Some people feel that In­diana has some of the best tal­ent in the Big Ten," said Gallo. 
"But I feel we are as good as they are. In our last five games against them, four have been lost in the ninth inning and the other we lost in extra innings. 
"Ball St. is 3-10, but they have played some excellent competition. Two of their oppo­nents were in the College World Series last year." 
Gallo will start Kevin Chenail, Mike Passilla, Brian Piotrowicz, and Robert Fitz on the mound for the Irish this weekend. Chenail leads the starters with a 2.38 ERA, while Passilla is the only starter to have struck out more batters than he has walked, registering 10 K's and issuing nine free passes. 
Piotrowicz and Chenail have each worked two complete games and have allowed only 16 earned runs in six starts. Fitz allowed only one earned run in his only win against Schreiner at Kerrville, Texas. 
Shortstop Pat Pesavento and outfielder Dan Peltier have the hot bats right now for the Irish. Pesavento has a batting average of .358 and an impres­sive 12 REI's under his belt. He also has two doubles, one triple and leads the team in stolen bases with four. Peltier has an average of .356 and, like Pesavento, he has 12 REI's. 
Designated hitter Chris Flynn has been a powerful force in the Irish offensive lineup. He has racked up two

Golfers impressive in Central Fla. 
By AARON GRICE Sports Writer 
While some of us were enjoy­ing the pleasures of Florida over the Spring Break without anything in the way of worries, the Notre Dame golf team was in a highly competitive tourn­ament at the University of Central Florida. 
The team left for the Or­lando, Fla., institution on Friday for two practice days before the three day, three course, tourney. First of the courses to be played was Or­ange Tree Country Club, a very fine but also very tight course. Narrow fairways, numerous water hazards, and staked boundries took their toll on the Irish scores, as a 90 and 93 were 
recorded, as was a team total 
of 324 for an average of 81. 
The unusually high scores at Orange Tree seemed to inspire the Irish as they stroked a 311 team total in the next round, played at Tuskawila Country Club on Tuesday. Head Coach Noel O'Sullivan commented that the team's confidence was notably up as they came in with an average of 77 for the round. With this perfomance adding momentum, the Irish rolled into the final round of the tourn­ament. 
The last round was to be played on Rio Ponar Country Club, site of the PGA's 1987 Citrus Open, which had been played the week before. Confi­dence was very high as the Irish played for "pride, perfor­mance, and position," accor­ding to O'Sullivan. On this, the nicest couse of the tourney, the Irish continued their surge, firing a team total 306 for a 75 average and placing fourth for the day. 
The final surge pushed the Irish into seventh place in a field of 12 teams including such perennial powers as Purdue, Kansas, and Louisville. Gar­nering top honors at the meet were Jacksonville University and the host school, UCF, each shooting an 898, with Jackson­ville winning the subsequent playoff. After these two, in des­cending order of finish, were Purdue at 911, Eastern Ken­tucky at 923, Louisville at 927,
