Observer Staff Report 
The joint task force of Notre Dame Security/Police, State Excise Police, St. Joseph County Police and South Bend Police issued 29 cita­tions and made two physical arrests on Saturday amidst the events surrounding the Michigan game. 
NDSP director Rex Rakow said the most common citations handed out were minor in consumption, minor in possession and public intoxication, though reports from all the officers on duty were not yet compiled for statistics. 
Excise officers handled the two arrests made, according to Excise officer Sergeant Michelle Traughber. 
Elizabeth Ryder, 20, was arrested before the game on charges of pos­session of a fake ID. minor in pos­session, minor in consumption and resisting law enforcement. Ryder is not listed as a student at Notre Dame, Saint Mary's or Holy Cross. 
John Khym. 25, was arrested on charges of public intoxication and battery to a police animal. Khym reportedly struck the Excise police horse Beau when officers told him to leave the parking lot after the game. 
No citations were issued during the field rush and altercations reported after the close of the game broke up before NDSP could respond, said Hakow. 
Rakow added the number of cita­tions and arrests at the Michigan game was about even with those at other home games. 
Interest in overseas programs remains high 

Info sessions occur this week 
By LYNN SIKORA 
News Writer 
The lure of Europe is in the air this week as students clamor to attend information sessions for Notre Dame and Saint Mary's overseas pro­grams. 
Study abroad programs are becoming increasing popular at Notre Dame and Saint Mary's as both schools seek to expand their overseas offer­ings. 
Though officials won't know exact numbers until applica­tion deadlines have passed, initial student interest is high this year. 
"It is hard to gauge the numbers because it varies year to year due to curriculum and security," said Thomas Bogenschild, director of inter­national study programs at Noire Dame. "We are expect­ing a similar turnout as last year, but we won't know what the impact of the bombing in Madrid will be for example." 
Within the past few years, Notre Dame has placed among the top schools in the nation for the number of students who study abroad. 
Generally 800-900 Notre Dame students study abroad per year, said Bogenschild, and the number rises to 1,100 to 1,200 when specialized pro­grams such as the Rome architecture program are included. 
Last year, Notre Dame initi­ated a new program in Italy and a yearlong option in London. 
Notre Dame's largest study abroad program, in London, will offer the yearlong option for a small number of stu­dents next fall. It w11l. target students who focus on British studies and could benefit from

Although Notre Dame's study abroad programs rank among the nation's best, some students find themselves craving immer­sion in a culture not on the list. 
Undergraduates who instead wish to choose their own loca­tion may apply to the University for a leave of absence. 
"Leave of absences are 
designed to supplement the study abroad offerings of Notre Dame," said assistant dean of arts and letters Jennifer Nemecek. "Non-western loca­tions are viewed very favorably by the committee." 
Currently, 16 slots are avail­able to Arts and Letters stu­dents, said assistant dean Jennifer Nemecek. The number varies depending on the College

much sweeter 
than the victory 
at Notre Dame Stadium of two years 
ago? 
Maybe it was because everyone and their mothers expected Notre Dame to lose. Heck, even Vegas had the team being steamrolled by the Wolverines, making us 13.5 point underdogs. ESPN cancelled its GameDay visit to South Bend at the last minute to make the trip down to the other USC (the University of South Carolina) campus for the Georgia game. "Hardcore" Notre Dame fans, sober and otherwise, heckled their team at the pep rally. But it was more than all that. 
Even if a part of me always believed we could pull out a victory over Michigan. another could not have imagined how emotional a game it would be. How could any game top a 25-23 victory with cor­nerback Shane Walton capping a nail-biter by batting away a two point conversion to preserve the win? It simply seemed unfath­omable for any football game in my Notre Dame career to compete with that 2002 victory. 
But suddenly, there we were two minutes into the fourth quarter. Up 14-12 over a Michigan team that everyone said could beat the Irish with one hand tied behind its collec­tive back. A faint glimmer of a real­ization started to dawn on the back of my mind (and probably the minds of many thousands of other fans). Could we possibly rush the field of hallowed Notre Dame stadium soil after an improbable win against Michigan? 
And then it happened. In a win for the ages, Notre Dame football kept Michigan to only one touchdown and a handful of field goals to pull out the victory. Within minutes, thousands poured onto the field, despite the ushers' futile efforts to prevent the mass exodus. It was deja vu all over again. But for some reason it wasn't. It was just a little different. Our team had just crushed Michigan, avenging last year's lop­sided loss, and all was well in the world and Domerland. 
In many ways, this win was a fit­ting way to balance the scales after a year and a half of bitter disap­pointment following a thrilling 2002 football outing. Even as ESPN.com was hurriedly scrambling to feature the Irish on the front headline, the best news came from the stadium announcer proclaiming to a mosh pit of thousands that Notre Dame had once again reclaimed its right­ful throne as Division I's winningest program. 
At that moment, it was clear that this truly was a win for the ages.

Students must apply simul­

their choice and to their col­

granted a leave of absence. 
Locations in Africa, where 
Notre Dame maintains only 
one program in Cairo, tend to 
be the most sought after as 
well as sites in South America. 
Due do the financial burden, 

the application process for 
leave of absence status has 
become more difficult in 
recent years. Nemecek esti­
mates that she received 20 to 
25 applications for the College 
of Arts and Letters' quota of 
16 per year. 
"It has gotten competitive over the years. The program used to be bigger," said Nemecek. "I just try to work with the students to put together the best application possible." 
Applications are due the weeks before the fall and spring breaks for the following semester and are evaluated by the Committee of Academic Standing. Students are responsible for researching credible programs. 
"There are tons of accredit­ed abroad programs out there that offer great academic experiences," said Nemecek. "We look for those that are academically comparable to Notre Dame, ones that are academically challenging with good safety and security pro­cedures and policies." 
Once students are accepted and their foreign studies begin, they are no longer for­mally enrolled at Notre Dame. Federal grants such as Pell funding remain intact, but participants forfeit any finan­cial aid received from the University for that semester.

St. Joseph County deputy coroner Rex Hakow said O'Connor's cause of death was severe head trauma and that an autopsy will not be performed. 
Police said O'Connor, recently returned from mili­tary service in Iraq. had left a bar with a group of friends to walk to a local restaurant. 
Several of the group had already crossed South Bend Avenue at Vaness Street when O'Connor and another person stopped on the west side of the street. According to a police statement, a wit­ness said that O'Connor ran across the street for an unknown reason, into the path of a northbound car driven by 19-year old Jackie Miltenberger of South Bend, a sophomore at Saint Mary's. Kraus said Miltenberger's car, which had one passen­ger, was the only one on the road at the time of the crash. 
"We'll never know if he saw that car or not," Kraus said. "There's no way we'll ever know." 
Kraus said that per proto­col. Miltenberger was given a blood alcohol content test at thn scene and then taken to option.

" I have always been inter­

East Africa, and have always

Hossmann, an economics and

If accepted, Rossman will 
live with a Ugandan family 
and study the history of mis­
sions and the church in East 
Africa. 
"I will really get to experi­

Rossman. 
In other cases leave of

when other plans fall through. 
Senior Courtney Kohout 
studied abroad in Seville, 
Spain last spring at the 
University of Seville. 
As an official student at the 
university, Kohout attended 
class entirely with Spanish 
students. The result, she said, 
was that she truly felt 
immersed in the culture, as 
opposed to some programs 
that feel like an American col­
lege in a foreign setting. 
"I would recommend this to 
anyone," said Kohout. "It was 
absolutely amazing, my lan­
guage skills improved so 
much." 
In Seville, Kohout also main­tained contact with Notre Dame. When the Madrid bombings occurred in March, Nemecek contacted all the Arts and Letters students on leaves of absence, said kohout. 
Coming back to Notre Dame, however, was more difficult then she expected. 
"It was hard for me to get back into housing," said Kohout. "I was at the bottom of the list, below the fresh­man."

Kraus did not know how fast Miltenberger was going on South Bend Avenue, although he did say the speed limit is 35 miles per hour. 
According to Kraus, that section of south Bend Avenue is fairly well-lit, but he noted that the street lamp at Vaness intersection was out at the time of the accident.

Mourners in the town of Arnold have put up a road­side memorial that includes flowers and balloons arranged between a pair of boots, a helmet, gloves and a shovel. A bulletin board included notes from friends and colleagues.

This fall also marks the first year that Saint Mary's has offered information ses­sions for College programs on Notre Dame's campus. 
Although both schools send a large number of students overseas, Saint Mary's focus­es on smaller, more special­ized programs, said College study abroad advisor Sarah DeMott. Roughly, 150. Saint Mary's students study abroad each year. 
"We can accommodate stu-· dents and their interests in a different kind of way while still maintaining the core essence of Saint Mary's College in the search for aesthetics and truth and the support of a higher Catholic education," DeMott said.

North Korea explains explosion 
SEOUL, South Korea -North Korea said Monday that an explosion last week that raised a huge mushroom cloud was the planned demolition of a mountain for a hydroelectric project, and the reclusive gov­ernment invited a British diplomat to visit the site to confirm the story. 
The North's explanation came as a number of officials and experts from the United States and elsewhere said they did not believe the blast Thursday near the Chinese border -which raised a cloud more than two miles wide -was a nuclear test. 
But a Bush administration official said the United States has indications that the North is trying to conduct a test. The explosion and concerns over Pyongyang's nuclear ambi­tions set off a heated back-and-forth between the White House and Democratic rival John Kerry. 
Hurricane Ivan heads for Cuba 
GEORGE TOWN, Cayman Islands -A strengthened Hurricane Ivan headed toward the tip of western Cuba with 160 mph winds Monday after pummeling the Cayman Islands with flooding that swamped homes and fierce winds that ripped off roofs. 
The slow-moving, extremely dangerous Category 5 storm, one of the strongest on record to hit the region, killed at least 68 people across the Caribbean before reaching the Caymans, and threatens millions more in its projected path. 
Parts of low-lying Grand Cayman, the largest island in the territory of 45,000 peo­ple, were swamped under up to 8 feet of water Monday and residents stood on rooftops of flooded homes. A car floated by the second story of one building.

Rigged letter sent to governor 
HICHMOND, Va. -Letters rigged to ignite when opened and bound for the governor's offices in Virginia and West Virginia were intercepted Monday, officials said. Governor's offices in at least 15 other states got similar letters last week. 
The letter that arrived in Richmond never threatened Gov. Mark R. Warner, said Bill Leighty, the governor's chief of staff. The let­ter, addressed to "executive chambers" in the state Capitol, was uncovered at a central postage-handling facility, Leighty said. 
A letter to Gov. Bob Wise of West Virginia was intercepted there. 
Like the letters received last week, both bore a return address :from Nevada's maxi­mum-security Ely State Prison."

Airstrike on Fallujah's residential neighborhood kills 20 and wounds 29 
Associated Press 

BAGHDAD, Iraq -U.S. warplanes pounded a sus­pected hide-out of al­Qaida-linked militants in the Sunni insurgent stronghold of Fallujah on Monday, killing at least 20 people and wounding 29, officials and witnesses sald. Seven of the victims died when a shell hit an ambulance, a hospital offi­cial said.

NFL 
Galloway expected to miss up to 6 weeks with groin irljury 
Associated Press 
TAMPA, Fla. -Tampa Bay's already thin receiving corps was further depleted Monday when the team learned Joey Galloway will miss four to six weeks after aggravating a groin injury. 
Coach Jon Gruden said the speedy 1Oth-year pro, obtained in an off-season trade from the Dallas Cowboys, has a tear in his left groin that is more seri­ous than the Bucs anticipated. 
Galloway missed most of the preseason with a sore groin and aggravated the injury in the first half of Sunday's 16-10 loss to the Washington Redskins. He came up limping turning to try catch a pass that glanced off his hands in the end zone, costing the Bucs a touchdown. 
"I can't say it didn't complete­ly heal or was completely healed, but he was cleared to play and practiced well," Gruden said. "He just made a slight turn for a ball and aggra­vated it on the way down. It's just unfortunate. We're going to miss him." 
The loss is especially damag­ing because the Bucs also are without last year's leading receiver, Keenan McCardell, who is holding out for a new contract after catching 84 pass­es for 1,17 4 yards and eight TDs last season. 
The team is also missing Joe Jurevicius, recovering from back surgery after sitting out most of last season with a knee injury. Charles Lee, who got a chance to play last year when Keyshawn Johi1son was shelved because of differences with Gruden, has been slowed by a sore hamstring and did not play against the Redskins. 
Galloway was obtained in the trade that sent Johnson to Dallas during the off-season. Still considered one of the fastest players in the NFL, Gruden was counting on his addition to add another dimen­sion to the offense. 
Tampa Bay was limited to 169 yards at Washington, including just 30 on the ground. The defense scored the team's only touchdown, and Martin Gramatica's 4 7 -yard field goal was set up by a long kickoff return. 
"It was a combination of thein playing very good defense and 
us not taking advantage of some 
opportunities when they pre­
sented themselves. In the end, 
that was the deciding factor," 
Gruden said. 
Galloway had one catch for no 
yards and watched the second 
half of the game from the side­
line on crutches. 
Rookie Michael Clayton or for­
mer Green Bay and Detroit 
receiver Bill Schroeder will 
replace Galloway in the starting 
lineup. Jurevicius is on the 
reserve non-football injury list 
and is eligible to return after six 
games, so Gruden said there are 
no immediate plans to sign a 
receiver. 
Clayton, the team's first-round draft pick, had sev1:1n receptions · for 53 yards in his debut. Schroeder, who will assume· 
Galloway's role as the primary 
punt returner, had two catches 
for 26 yards. 
Galloway had 261 receptions 
for 4,122 yards and scored 41 
touchdowns in his first four pro 
seasons in Seattle. A contract 
dispute wiped out half his 1999 
season with the Seahawks, and 
he was a disappointment the 
past four years in Dallas, includ­
ing 2000, when he suffered a 'season-ending knee injury in his first game with the Cowboys. The groin injury is not expect­ed to require surgery. 
"As I understand, he will be 
off his feet for a couple of weeks 
and then resume his rehab," the 
coach said. "It is a significant 
tear ... and we are looking at 
four to six weeks. It's going to 
take some time."

Cal's Lyman heals 
Receiver recovers from a series ofsurgeries 
Associated Press 
BEHKELEY, Calif. -Almost the only thing Chase Lyman has kept healthy while playing football is his head. 
Thank goodness for that -it certainly saved his sanity. 
To best diagram his injuries, start at the top of his 6-foot-4, 210-pound frame and work down. There was his troublesome shoulder and a hurt finger, appendicitis and a severely torn hamstring, a banged-up knee and a sprained ankle. 
All that has added up to five surgeries for No. 10 California's senior rnceiver. 
llere's how bad his luck has been: lie dislocated his finger on the first day of fall camp two years ago and five minutes later tore his hamstring muscle ofT the bone -causing him to need sur­gery, redshirt and miss what would have been his true junior season. 
"I'm done with surgery, I'm done with injuries," Lyman says now. "It's great to be back on the field with all my friends. I spent the majority of two years hurt." 
Everyone around Cal sure hopes he stays healthy. Lyman is on a roll.

season and has carried that suc­cess into this year. In two games for the Golden Bears, Lyman has caught seven passes for 210 yards and two touchdownS. 
"Chase is awesome," quarter­back Aaron Hodgers said. "He makes great catches. I can just throw the ball up. I threw some not-so-great passes and he got them." 
Star receiver Geoff McArthur has been slowed by a strained oblique muscle so far, leaving Lyman to take most of the plays at receiver in practice. 
Lyman is hoping for many more big games this fall. But he'll have to wait until the team's Pac-1 0 opener at Oregon State on Oct. 2. The Bears' game scheduled for Thursday night at Southern Mississippi was postponed Monday because of Hurricane Ivan. 
"I expect this out of myself, and I expect this out of the team," said Lyman, who grew up in nearby Los Altos Hills and remembers all the Bears' bad years. "Our goal is to put drives together and score every time we touch the ball." 
He took several months off after the bowl game last season to make sure he recovered physical­ly. He ran a 4.45 in the 40-yard dash during the spring, and worked all summer to get his time down into the 4.3s. 
"It was really those cou.ple months where I could shut every­thing down and give everything a rest and get back to 100 percent," he said of last winter.

After convincing 20-3 victory Sunday, fans remain on cloud nine 
Associated Press 
BEREA, Ohio-More than an hour after Sunday's game, the parking lots outside Cleveland Browns Stadium were still full of partying tailgaters, and the few cars that did leave pulled away with their horns blaring. 
For a change, the honking was­n't in anger. 
Cleveland won its first season opener since rejoining the league, a convincing 20-3 victory over the Baltimore Ravens, who were out­played in every phase by a Browns team seeking redemption and respect. 
Everything felt different on a sun-splashed afternoon along the shores of Lake Erie. 
Jeff Garcia, the Browns' new quarterback, scrambled, made big plays and even jumped into the Dawg Pound to celebrate a touchdown. Cleveland's defense swarmed "like bees to honey" on Ravens running back Jamal Lewis, and 73,068 fans stood, barked and screamed like they once did for Jim Brown and Bernie Kosar. 
It was one of the few times since their rebirth in 1999 it felt like the Browns were back -all the way back. 
"It's a great feeling," said defen­sive tackle Orpheus Roye, one of the few players available in the locker room Monday. "Hopefully, we can keep this going." 
Getting started had been Cleveland's problem the previous five seasons. The Browns had begun each year since '99 with a loss, all of them at home. 

But feeding off the positive vibes created by a weekend-long trib­ute for the Browns' 1964 NFL championship team, Cleveland played perhaps its most complete game since Butch Davis took over as coach in 2001. 
"It was a double exclamation point at the end of a great week­end," Davis said. 
That's a big improvement on the usual question marks. 
Davis credited Cleveland's flaw­less special teams, the Browns' gang-tackling on Lewis and not turning the ball over against one of the NFL's toughest defenses as the keys to victory. 
Finally 1-0, the Browns are not starting a season in a hole. 
"It's a better way to set the tone than the alternative," Davis said. "But it's just one game." 
There were plenty of positive signs, though. And Garcia's debut may have been the most opti­mistic. 
After a shaky start, the three­time Pro Bowl quarterback threw a 46-yard touchdown pass to Quincy Morgan in the third quar­ter before calling his own number on a bootleg and going 3 yards for the clinching TD late in the fourth. 
Garcia's scoring toss came on a play that looked doomed from the start. He danced in the pocket weren't going to be intimidated by looking for a receiver, and unable Ray Lewis, Deion Sanders or any­to find one, he pump-faked one else wearing purple and 
enough to get safety Ed Reed to bite and come up. 
Garcia then floated the ball to a wide-open Morgan, who only had to haul it in and not trip over any blades of grass on his sprint to the end zone. 
"His scrambling, staying alive in the pocket, that was a vintage vet-black. 
Linebacker Andra Davis got into it with Ravens tackle Orlando Brown, who had to be pulled away from the exchange of hand­shakes between the teams' cap­tains. 
"There was a lot of emotion at the start. Nobody was going to back down," said Andra Davis, who joked about the topic of con­versation. "We talked about the Presidential election. But we did­n't get far enough to find out who was voting for who." 
The Browns' landslide win caused Garcia to throw an open-house party following the game. The gesture underlined his lead­ership and a new bond among Cleveland players. 
Garcia now just needs to work on the guest list. "I was mad. He didn't invite the head coach," Davis said. 

Colts' Vanderjagt strives for perfection 
Kicker has great expectations for the season after missing game-tying field goal 
Associated Press 
INDIANAPOLIS Mike Vanderjagt thinks he should make every kick for the Indianapolis Colts. Anything less is unacceptable in his world. 
So when Vanderjagt missed a potential game-tying 48-yarder last week at New England, he grimaced, clapped his hands once and walked away feeling sick. Gone was the NFL record of 42 straight field goals and a 21-month stretch of perfection, but not the confidence that has made him one of league's top kickers. 
"It was supreme disappoint­ment," Vanderjagt said Monday. "I have higher expectations of myself than anyone could possi­bly imagine." 
Since joining the Colts in 1998, Vanderjagt has typically met his lofty goals. 
He has scored at least 100 points in a club-record six straight seasons and is an amazing 14 of 20 all-time on kicks from at least 50 yards. 
And few kickers could match Vanderjagt's success in 2003 when he made the Pro Bowl for the first time, became the fourth kicker in league history to complete a perfect season by making all 37 field goals and 46 extra points and broke the NFL record for consecutive field goals with his 41st in the sea­son-finale at Houston. He extended the record to 42 last week before pushing the 48­yarder wide right. 

Now, Vanderjagt must start over. 
"It meant the world to me because I expect perfection, and I was achieving it," Vanderjagt said of the streak. "So it was very disappointing." 
But one miss has not changed Vanderjagt. 
He still holds the distinction of being the most accurate kicker in NFL history, with a field-goal percentage of 87.5, and by most accounts, he's also the league's most confident kicker. 
He's embraced fans who try to chastise him, welcomes time­outs teams take to freeze him and even has been caught mak­ing a money sign while stand­ing on the sideline before a game-winning or game-tying kick. 
That's just Vanderjagt. 
"Mike is cocky," cornerback Nick Harper said, smiling. "He's as sure a thing as you get."

Lions' Rogers sidelined for the rest of the season 

ALLEN PAHK, Mich. -Detroit wide receiver Charles Hogers will miss the rest of the season after breaking his collarbone for the second straight season. 
The No. 2 pick in the 2003 draft was injured going for a pass Sunday in the !irst quarter of the 20-16 victory over the Chicago Bears. X-rays revealed a fracture near the one he got last year during a bye week practice. 
Hogers played only the !irst five games of his rookie season because of the injury, catching 22 passes. 
lie will have surgery later this week or early next week and will be placed on injured reserve, coach Steve Mariueci said Monday. 
"I just spoke with Charles, and he's very disappointed." Mariucci said. "I told him that's he not to blame. lle's 23 and ho's got a lot of football ahead of him." 
Cornerback Dre' Bly, also injured in the Bears game, will miss the next two games, Mariucci said. Bly sprained a lig­anwnt in his knee in the opening quarter. 
Broncos 
Cornerback Lenny Walls could miss up to a month after dislocat­ing his right shoulder in Denver's opener. 
Walls, who started all 16 games for the Broncos last sea­son, played the nickel spot in their 34-24 win over Kansas City on Sunday.

half of Sunday's 16-10 loss to the 
Washington Redskins. He came 
up limping turning to try catch a 
pass that glanced off his hands in 
the end zone, costing the Bucs a 
touchdown. 
"I can't say it didn't completely 
heal or was completely healed, 
but he was cleared to play and 
practiced well," Gruden said. "He 
just made a slight turn for a ball 
and aggravated it on the way 
down. It's just unfortunate. We're 
going to miss him." 
The loss is especially damaging 
because the Bucs also are with­
out last year's leading receiver, 
Keenan McCardell, who is hold­
ing out for a new contract after 
catching 84 passes for 1,174 
yards and eight TDs last season. 
The team is also missing Joe 
Jurevicius, recovering from back 
surgery after missing most of last 
season with a knee injury. 
Charles Lee, who got a chance to 
play last year when Keyshawn 
Johnson was shelved because of 
differences with Gruden, has 
been slowed by a sore hamstring 
and did not play against the 
Redskins. 
Sea hawks 
Running back Shaun 
Alexander has a bone bruise on 
his right knee, but could play in 
this week's game at Tampa Bay. 
"It might be a week or two," 
coach Mike Holmgren said. 
"There's a chance he can play 
this week. We'll just have to see 
how it goes." 
Said Alexander: ''I'm a fast 
healer. I'll be all right." 
An MRI exam disclosed the 
injury, which was reported as a 
knee sprain during Seattle's 21-7 
win Sunday at New Orleans. 
Alexander rushed for 135 yards 
on 28 carries, ran for two touch­
downs and caught a TO pass. 
49ers 
Starting QB Tim Rattay has a separated right shoulder and Ken Dorsey, the former University of Miami star and a seventh-round draft pick in 2003, will start in New Orleans on Sunday unless Rattay's injury heals much more quickly than expected. 
Rattay was injured while get­ting sacked by Atlanta's Rod Coleman in the second quarter of the 49ers' 21-19 loss to the Falcons on Sunday. Dorsey took over and led two scoring drives in his first NFL action. But after Dorsey got a stinger in his right shoulder late in the third quarter, Rattay returned and led three lengthy drives, throwing two touchdown passes. 
But an MRI exam on Monday revealed a serious shoulder sepa­ration for Rattay, who has strug­gled with a groin injury and a sore forearm during the off-sea­son and training camp of his first year as the 49ers' starter. 
"I was just getting over the groin and I got the forearm," Rattay said. "And then I was get­ting over the forearm. and I get this. I'm keeping those guys busy in (the training room)." 
Ravens 
Ethan Brooks, who replaced Jonathan Ogden at left tackle in Baltimore's 20-3 defeat at Cleveland, will miss at least two weeks with a sprained knee liga­ment. The Ravens hope to have Ogden, who missed Sunday's game with a sprained knee, back for this week's home opener against Pittsburgh, but are still without center Mike J<lynn (frac­tured shoulder blade). 
In addition, wide receiver Travis Taylor aggravated a groin 
injury and probably will be side­
lined this week. His departure 
Sunday left the Ravens with only 
three active receivers: Randy 
Hymes, Devard Darling and 
Kevin Johnson. 
On the defensive side, Kelly 
Gregg, a three-year starter at 
nose guard, will undergo knee 
surgery this week. 
"We were hoping that we could 
stall that for a while and do it at 
our choosing, but it needs to be 
done now," Billick said, adding 
Gregg will need around two 
weeks to recuperate. 
Eagles 
Rookie guard Shawn Andrews 
will have surgery on the right leg 
he broke Sunday against the New 
York Giants and coach Andy Reid 
said he will be placed on injured 
reserve. 
Reid said the Eagles would 
probably look for another line­
man, though they could use 
recently signed Steve Sciullo. "He 
needs more time," Reid said. 
Cornerback Lito Sheppard will 
wear a cast on his broken thumb, 
but will practice and play. 
Falcons 
Jim Mora's roots as a defensive 
coach were obvious Monday as 
he reflected on his first victory as 
an NJ<L head coach. 
Mora inherited an Atlanta 
defense that gave up more yards 
passing and more total yards 
than any other team last season, 
but he says the defense he saw in 
Sunday's 21-19 win at San 
Francisco will be a source of 
pride, not embarrassment. 
"The thing I liked about our defense, I looked out at them and said 'That's a hard defense,'" Mora said Monday. "They're unyielding. They're hard. They had an edge to them, an attitude. They were knocking the dog out of the ball carriers and getting after it." 
In 2003, the defense gave up more than 400 yards seven times. Thanks to two late touch­down drives by the 49ers, the Falcons gave up 359 yards Sunday -an improvement, but still more than Mora would like. 
Even when giving up the two late drives, the defense delivered two big fourth-quarter plays. Cornerback Aaron Beasley returned a goal-line interception 85 yards to set up the decisive touchdown by Warrick Dunn. and defensive tackle Rod Coleman batted down Tim Rattay's pass on a 2-point con­version attempt with 40 seconds left. 
Vikings 
Michael Bennett's knee is feel­ing better after a workout, but Minnesota coach Mike Tice prob­ably will sit his starting running back again next Monday in Philadelphia. 
Tice said Bennett is progress­ing quickly, but he has enough confidence in his backfield depth to hold him out at least another week. 
"We'll wait until Mike feels almost perfect," Tice said. 
Backup Onterrio Smith, appealing a four-game sub­stance-abuse suspension, rushed for 76 yards and caught a 63­yard TO pass against the Cowboys. Tice also has rookie Mewelde Moore and Larry Ned in the backfield. 
Moe Williams. who started in Bennett's place, will be closely monitored this week after sprain­ing his ankle in the opener. Tice doesn't expect Williams to prac­tice Thursday, "but we'll see how that goes. He's a tough guy."

Over-the-top documentary delivers the goods 
By RYAN ROGERS 
Scene Critic 
Morgan Spurlock. director, producer and masochist of the film "Super Size Me," points at America's fat gut with blatant disregard for its feelings. 
The documentary features Spurlock, an award-winning graduate of New York University, hinging on McDonald's food for an entire month, three meals a day. During Spurlock's eating adven­tures he must adhere to three rules. IIe can only eat things available over the countr.r at McDonald's (water and vita­mins includnd), he can only super size wht~n it is offered and hr. must eat evnrything on the menu at least once. Spurlock also calculates the average amount of exercise 
This film is very funny, and Spurlock is witty and thoroughly entertaining. It also offers a wealth of information for those unaware of the extent of damage that fast food can do to one's body, focusing heavily on facts. Spurlock is armed to the teeth with slats, numbers and professional opinions about the nutritional value of an average visit to McDonald's. 
The best part of this film is the fact that, while it clearly defames fast food chains, it does not look to them for answers. As the film states, fast food is a business and as long as there are cus­tomers there will be no change in prac­tice. Ultimately, the customer has to make the change. This ending does seem pretty abrupt and forced but regardless "Super Size Me" delivers all 
it promises.

By MARK BEMENDERFER 
Scene Critic 
There seems to have been an interest­ing trend sweeping through Hollywood lately. Movies that were average at best and undeserving of sequels are now receiving second chances to push their characters and themes back on film. When the first "Anaconda" film came out. not many people saw it. Those that did probably didn't expect to see a sequel. Well, they got it in the form of "Anacondas: The Hunt for the Blood Orchid." 
Wanted or not. the movie is here, and should be judged on its own merits. Unfortunately, its numerous flaws out­weigh those merits. The whole movie feels rec·vcled and lacking. The script would have been more deserving of a direct to video treatment as opposed to the theatrical release that it received. 
The movie begins with some pharma­

are introduced. Sadly, as they progress through the movie, they find that the blood orchid location also happens to be near the local anaconda mating ground. Since the blood orchid prolongs life, these snakes are slightly larger than average. But as usual, the characters never wonder about the obvious coinci­dence before launching into their quest 
If you couldn't tell already, this is a flawed movie. Where's a good place to start with the complaints? The plot was formulaic, with all the impending deaths obvious well in advance. The characters feel recycled; there's the greedy corpo­rate guy, the courageous loner, the horny jerk. If you are looking for some­thing new or innovative, look elsewhere. At least the first movie had some memo­rable characters with charisma, such as Jennifer Lopez, Ice Cube, and the always classy Jon Voight. 
Another complaint is that the film­makers did not do any research con­
cerning the 
natural wildlife thereof) and myths about nutrition. Random people interviewed on the street can more easily sing the Big Mac song than the National Anthem. 
As any film about the weaknesses of the human body, "Super Size Me" pres­ents some graphic images. Spurlock burps and vomits while consuming his meals. A medical procedure is per­formed on screen. Very personal things are revealed about Spurlock's body in his many visits to the doctor. Although this may be difficult for those with weak stomachs, it is very honest filmmaking. 
Spurlock not only puts his body on the line but also his pride. 
Spurlock knows his film's limits. The film runs just over an hour and a half and that is plenty. The film ends before beating its points into the ground, which is a difficult line to walk. 
Those seeking a tremendously groundbreaking documentary should look elsewhere, but ultimately "Super Size Me" proves itself to be funny, intel­ligent, and refreshing.

This brings us to the positives in the movie. The snakes look pretty nice on the screen. Being purely CGI animated, they move fluidly and create a lot of moments that are just plain fun to watch. If this movie had received the direct-to-video treatment, the snakes would have undoubtedly suffered in appearance. So it is probably for the best that it got a theatrical debut. as without the CGI this movie would proba­bly have been far less than what it is. 
Although formulaic and recycled, this movie certainly has some redeeming values saving it from earning the infa­mous single shamrock rating. The plot, despite complaints, still provides some entertainment if you lose any high expectations and the creatures are well done. 
However, you may still want to check out the first one if you are in need of a giant snake fix.

DVD REVIEW 

1 Kill Bill: Vol. 2' fails to make the cut on DVD 

By BRANDON HOLLIHAN Scene Critic 

Of all the films just dying for extras ­bonus footage, interviews, commentary, whatever it may be-the "Kill Bill" DVD series is a truly disappointing release, in light of all the buzz created while the films were still at the box office. This is like an Irish victory at Florida State being followed up by a home loss to Boston College, in case you need an idea as to how let down you should feel. 
At least "Vol. 2" is the better of the two movies. Picking up where "Vol. 1" left off in Tokyo. we open with the Bride (Uma Thurman) giving a prologue speech recalling her apparent death and subse­quent revenge. "I've killed a [heck] of a lot of people to get to this point," she sneers, "but I have only one more," that being Bill (David Carradine), her former boss/lover and the one most responsible for her attempted murder. Along the way the Bride encounters two other remain­ing members of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad: Budd (Mark Madsen), who's allowed his life to take a turn for the worse; and Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah), Bill's current flame and the Bride's ultimate rival. 

"VoL 2" hits its peak and most fun in the middle of the plot. Here, the action and exchanges between the principal characters are at their most engaging, plus there's the bonus of the indescrib­ably great 'Chapter 8: The Cr:uel Tutelage of Pai Mei,' with Gordon Liu uncannily assuming the role of the White Lotus priest and thus creating one of the best movie characters ever. Canadine's portrayal of Bill is also convincing and entertaining, but I feel we see too much of him. His interaction with other cl1ar­acters ought to have been limited to just the Bride and their child; a concept of mystique to his character needs to be upheld. 
Any flaws the film may contain, how­ever, are negligible when compared to the packaging of the DVD as a whole. As with "Vol. 1," there is no audio commen­tary -a pretty ludicrous mishap, given that Quentin Tarantino's insight is the kind of stuff fans of his films would die 
for. There is movie pre­miere footage on the DVD, but it's just Robert Rodriguez's band Chingon playing a song from the film's end cred­its. There's also only one deleted scene, a show­down between Bill and a thug named Damoe (Michael Jai White) and his cronies, which is nothing to write home about. 

The major special feature is a behind­the-scenes look at "Vol. 2 ,'' which is decent, but even then it leaves you want­ing more. For example, Tarantino dis­cusses Carradine's star turn in the 70's TV series "Kung Fu." or Liu having been worked in films outside of the "Kill Bill" series that featured the character Pai Mei. Would it really have been too much to dig up some of these things and do features on them? Tarantino shares his love for classic martial arts films with great intensity, and yet the viewer feels left out in the cold. 
That's why the "Vol. 2" DVD doesn't get the recommendation one might think it would have deserved. If you're an owner of the "Kill Bill" set, take heart in the fact that you have a pair of very fun movies in your dorm room, and that many people in your section respect you and find you very cool. Otherwise, this set is for fans only. at least until the inevitable "Kill Bill Special Edition Box Set" shows up somewhere down the line.

It has been the year for sequels. Hollywood must be running out of imagi­nation, as this year has been dominated by spin-offs to successful formulas. "Spider-Man 2,'' "Shrek 2,'' "Alien Vs. Predator" and even "Anacondas" have all received the sequel treatment. Some sequels have been memorable than oth­ers. The latest movie in this latter vein has been "Resident Evil: Apocalypse." 
Many people may think back to the first "Resident Evil" and recall that it didn't exactly rock the world. The actors weren't huge, as it starred Milia 
·Jovovich, a girl some may recall as being a bit actor in "The Fifth Element" and "Zoolander." It put forward a vaguely "Alice in Wonderland" storyline as an Alice fought against the tyrannical nature of a computer called the Red Queen designed by the Umbrella Corporation.

Almost before the first "Resident Evil" was released, the sequel was announced. Ever since then, the second movie promised to surpass the first in every regard. There was going to be more action, more critters and most important, more zombies. And in that aspect, this sequel succeeded in every category. There is more action. There are more critters and there is now a city full of zombies for your viewing pleas­ure. 
Anderson is cur­

rently responsible for writing (this and "Aliens Vs. Predator"), this one left me with a better feeling on how the movie went. However, this one may be the improved one as it was directed by Alexander Witt instead of Anderson himself. 
Overall though, the film was pretty enjoyable. The brain needs to be left at the door, but the movie provides some decent entertainment for those into this kind of genre movie. If you liked the first, you will most likely enjoy this sec­ond look at the Resident Evil world.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
John Kerry: A renewal of responsibility 
A recent Observer columnist wrote that a vote for president was somehow a more dift1cult. but ultimately more rewarding path. This claim of President Bush's more tough-minded approach is nothing more than a reiteration of the president's political persona: unyielding bravado. A quick comparison of Mr. Bush's record and Sen. John Kerry's plan reveals that John Kerry will return a much-needed responsibility to the presidency. 
Two key examples, among many possibilities, provide an adequate glimpse of President Bush's reckless first term in which political concerns most often trumped serious issues. 
First. Mr. Bush's enormous tax cuts have provided scant economic stimulus and are little more than a boon for his more wealthy constituents. They have turned a projected $400 billion surplus into a $500 billion deficit: a $900 billion regression. The Economic Policy Institute says these cuts will not engender needed investment and only lead to large debts. Instead. Mr. Kerry would take the sensible approach of rolling-back the tax cuts for only the wealthiest Americans. while retaining the tax cuts for the middle-class and working poor. Sen. Kerry is also known for a rigorous policy of costing-out all proposals so that every piece of his plan for America has a definitive revenue source. 
President Bush thrust the United States into an unnecessary war and grossly mismanaged occupation of Iraq as he foolishly succumbed to the neoconserva­tive block among his advisors. who believe that hawkish and risky military operations are the only way to promulgate democracy in the world. Sen. Kerry, who voted for the use of force in Iraq as a last resort, would have only invaded Iraq if the U.S. had exhausted all other plans and been sure that Iraq was a danger to the region and to the United States. This was not the case with President Bush. More importantly, Mr. Kerry would have led an occupation of Iraq that anticipated the residual troubles of a war-torn Iraq. 
In the end. the U.S. has encountered many serious problems during Mr. Bush's tenure and he has failed to address them. Opposite the Bush record. Mr. Kerry's plans show his commitment to responsible and thoughtful leadership.

To the man in the yellow jacket: thank you 

With the last few minutes of the game standing between the Irish and a huge win over their oldest rival Michigan, I was about to chew a hole in my Notre  Dame keychain and kept pinching myself. Merely an hour earlier. my friend had turned to me and said that if we won that game, we were going to rush the field. Apparently, many other people had had that same notion, and with 20 seconds left in the game, the sea of green started cascading down in a rush of people. purses and eventual bleacher shards. At one point during the descent. there had amassed such a crowd that my body was no longer touching the ground. 
The intensity was exhilarating until I got to the wall, where the surge from behind was so strong that I could not get my legs up and over. Earnestly afraid of being crushed, I glanced up and saw a man in a yellow jacket standing down on the field, apparently very concerned about what he was witnessing. Our eyes met. I mouthed the word "help," and he stretched his arms towards me. Grateful. I simply leaned over, threw my arms around him and slid over the wall in what must have been the epitome of grace. Good thing I wasn't wearing a skirt. 
Not only to that one usher but to all of them, I wish to extend a big thank you. I was certain that you were going to try to stop the inevitable. Instead, you helped a few flimsy students in their quest for the football field. My friends even told me that they had heard ushers asking people during the fourth quar­ter not to hurt each other while rushing the field. Saturday, the ushers showed some real wisdom and kindness for a student body that probably never shows gratitude. So once again, to the nameless selfless people in the yellow jackets who love Notre Dame too much to leave it, thank you. You deserve another big hug.

News-Letter

heartwarming stories 
of loved ones reunit­
ed and lives saved. 
What we did not hear, though, is 
why natural disasters such as these 
are occurring more and more fre­
quently. Natural disasters are fre­
quent in the news: Wildfires in the 
West. blizzards in the East, droughts 
in the Midwest and, of course, hurri­
canes in the Gulf. 
Typically, TV news stations do 
their exposes, tell their stories of 
life, death and the human spirit, and 
move on. There is little thought 
given to how and why these natural 
disasters occur. and surely no 
thought is given to why they seem to 
be covering more and more major 
disasters each year. Natural disas­
ters are seen as sudden, uncontrol­
lable, random and most of all, iso­
lated events. 
The startling truth is that natural disasters such as wildfires, floods and hurricanes have seen a dramat­ic increase in their regularity and intensity over the last 20 years. From the period between 1990 and 2000, the total number of natural disasters around the globe has risen from 650 to 850 per year. 
To prevent this sort of scenario from occurring, the developed nations of the world, including the 
U.S.. finally signed the Kyoto Protocols in 1997. after 10 years of debate. These protocols, mandating the reduction of global emissions by 
5.2 percent from 1990 levels, is an important, though not dramatic. step toward dampening the effects of global warming. Though coun­tries including the European Union, China, Canada and Japan have rati­fied the agreement. the Bush admin­istration withdrew the U.S. from this agreement pending "further envi­ronmental study." 
Though a vocal group of lawmak­ers, environmentalists and world leaders protested this move, the Sept. 11 attacks overshadowed and buried this type of story. More "pressing" issues such as global ter­rorism were then espoused by the government and the media, and environmental issues were given lit­tle airplay due to time constraints and public disinterest. 
This disinterest fed a "one-track" psyche that gives a narrow group of issues and dangers an overempha­sized amount of attention, allowing others to fade into a mishmash of "secondary" issues such as trade tariffs. veterans' affairs and envi­ronmental issues. This dangerous mindset allows the public and offi­cials to "forget" issues that are not immediate to the survival of the nation and its citizens -at least until they are at such a point that they are creating catastrophic effects to our national well being. 
Though global warming may not be an urgent issue of public debate, it will not simply go away. If we do 
not act soon, the exponential 
increase of natural catastrophes 
caused by global warming will not 
only further ravage our planet. but 
also has the potential to cause the 
breakdown of the existing world 
order. A recent Pentagon report. 
first publicized by the New York 
Times, outlined how such a change 
will force the U.S. to secure recours­
es vital to its survival if global 
warming continues at its current 
pace. To do this, the U.S. will be 
forced to act solely in its self-inter­
est, violating international law. 
Smaller countries will be forced to 
fight among themselves for a 
decreasing amount of fresh water. 
arable land and natural recourses. 
In essence, global anarchy will once 
again instate itself as typical of the 
human condition. 
To avoid this, we must have a 
broader vision as a country that 
must both address immediate issues 
of national importance and deal 
with ongoing issues such as global 
warming and energy dependence 
that have no immediate perceived 
effect today but will cost us dearly 
in the future. Both political parties 
and the public must recognize this 
today, or they face an uncertain 
future where the smaller, more 
attainable reforms o·r today will be 
replaced by much more far-reaching 
and draconian reforms in the future. 
Sadly, only a truly catastrophic event directly linked to global warming will sway the minds of many across the U.S. to take action, but there is hope that scientists. activists and "enlightened" politi­cians can once again bring the issue of climate change back into the realm of debate in America. States can also act on their own to limit emissions, thus forcing automobile companies to develop more efficient cars. Conservation groups can band together and enlist the help of sym­pathetic politicians such as Senator John McCain. This meta-group of activists can then respond to disas­ters such as Hurricane Frances by arguing the case that global warm­ing is at least partially to blame. 
In turn, the U.S. electorate will become more aware and concerned with legislation such as the Kyoto Protocols. thus forcing politicians to adopt these concerns. Finally. JGOs can mandate energy-efficient and clean-burning technologies in any investment abroad made by U.S. corporations. and censure those who are not following these prac­tices in the U.S. and abroad. 
In short. through public concern, governmental mandates and finan­cial incentives, the U.S. will, know­ingly or unknowingly, follow an agenda very similar to those of the Kyoto Protocols. A cleaner, more well-educated America will take the first crucial steps in altering the course of climate change from one of ignorance and catastrophe to one of pro-activeness and prosperity.

A Call to 

years later, Whitman's 
Action
words could not ring more true. 

No one would disagree that the United States is a country at war, but how many of us directly feel the effects of war? As our country has waged two wars over the last three years, it has become as trendy to talk about war. Yet, we contin­ue our quotidian lives with little con­sciousness of fellow Americans being brought home in body bags or Iraqi civil­ians being bombed. We are certainly not starved for war-talk, but we keep miss­ing the human realities of war. 
This summer I traveled to Phnom Penh, Cambodia, a land that knows too well the realities of war. From 1969 to 1973, the United States dropped 540,000 tons of bombs on Cambodia as a "sideshow" of the Vietnam War. Following the war. the Khmer Rouge, a communist-militia strengthened by poverty and suffering from the war, came to power in 197 5. During four years, the Khmer Rouge killed more than two million Cambodians. This auto­genocide resulted in the deaths of more than one-fourth of the population and more than 80 percent of the educated members of society. In 1979, the Vietnamese overthrew the Khmer Rouge, but ushered in a decade of occu­pation and conflict. In 1993, the United Nations organized elections, but prob­lems of poverty, corruption and violence have persisted. 
Almost 25 years after the war and genocide, the people of Cambodia con­tinue to feel the effects. First, the abject poverty and societal corruption are a result of devastated infrastructure. Second, the extremely high rate of tuberculosis cases in Cambodia, most of which result in death, is easily traced to the war years. Third, problems with landmines and uncontrolled small arms continue to kill many. Finally, the culture of fear continues to plague the society. Twenty-five years later, the Cambodian people continue to face the effects of war and genocide everyday. 
When I walked through Tuol Sleng where thousands of people were tor­tured or stared at the tree at Choeung Elk against which babies were smashed to death, the temptation was to turn away from the human realities. The temptation was and remains to simply see these events on a conceptual level, but to never give them a human face. As humans, there is a seduction to war as long as we avoid the "seething hell" of which Whitman writes. 
This summer, when I asked my stu­dents at the University about war and peace, they spoke with solemnity and somberness. They speak about losing family members, about fear, about their broken society. For them, war. though perhaps unavoidable at times, is never a good thing. War kills and destroys. And for them, peace is not a flowery concept; it is a dream of a day when they will not live in violence, despair or fear. 
The story of Cambodia is not exclusive. It is a common story for people from El Salvador, Congo, East Timor, Colombia, Uganda and most of the world's coun­tries. It is a story that many U.S. veter­ans know too well. These people speak of the realities of war that never get into the books, but are never erased. 
In our country today, we have every reason to face the human realities of war as more than 1,000 U.S. troops have been killed in the ongoing war in Iraq. The deadly fighting in Iraq has become a quagmire with no end in sight. More U.S. troops were wounded in August than any other month in the war. Every day, someone's son. daughter, father or moth­er is being killed in a war that Donald Rumsfeld claims will only get worse in the coming months. 
The saddest part of it all is that you and I are so easily able to avoid these human realities. We cheer at football games and dance at SYR's with little consciousness that our fellow Americans are fighting and dying. For too many of us, the war in Iraq or the genocide in Sudan are nothing more than headlines in the newspaper. 
Of course, this seems to be just what the powers-that-be want us to do. The Pentagon has banned photographs of dead soldiers. including the coffins in which they rest. There was even talk that those holding candlelight vigils for the dead U.S. troops last week were "hurting the war effort" and "unpatriot­ic." While it would seem that bearing witness to the sacrifices of our troops would be the patriotic thing to do, we are told to do the opposite. 
In a very important book, "War Is a Force That Gives Us Meaning," Christopher Hedges, a veteran war cor­respondent, writes. "War makes the world understandable, a black and white tableau of them and us. It suspends thought, especially self-critical thought. All bow before the supreme effort. We are one." In a culture of war, thought is often the first casualty.

Changes sought in nevvborn testing 
Better testing could result in safer births 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -Gracie Clay's mother says her child could still be alive had she been born in, say, Mississippi instead of Georgia: Which state you live in determines whether your new­born is tested for several dozen rare but devastating inherited diseases. 
Many of these illnesses, like the one that killed 19-month-old Gracie last February, can be treated easily if parents know in time. Testing requires a single drop of blood. But many states mandate newborn testing for only a fraction of the diseases. 
Next week, a government advisory committee is expected to move to end the geographic disparity, as it debates whether every state should test every newborn for 30 genetic illnesses. 
"We should not be having babies die because of not having a test that's relatively simple," says Dr. R. Rodney Howell, a University of Miami pediatrician who chairs the panel that advis­es Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy Thompson. 
The influential March of Dimes. which has a seat on that advisory panel, isn't waiting. Last week it decided to increase its own newborn testing recom­mendations from nine diseases to 30, persuaded by a long­awaited study from leading 

geneticists that forms the crux of ease. next week's debate. But new technology called tan­

requires now. If it's fewer than 30, "we do have to suggest that the family at least consider a private screening lab," Green says. Extra testing costs $25 to $100, depending on the lab. 
"If I'd just known about new­born screening," laments Molly Clay of Atlanta. Although a pub­lic health worker, she didn't learn until Gracie died that Georgia tested for eight diseases, but not her daughter's. The state is adding that one to its list. 
"The state you live in decides the fate of your child if you're not aware," says Clay, who encourages parents to seek that supplemental testing. 
Today. every U.S. baby is test­ed for two rare diseases that can cause retardation if untreated: hypothyroidism and the meta­bolic disease phenylketonuria, or PKU. Most also are tested for sickle cell anemia, a blood dis­ing going more 
than a few hours without food can be fatal. Gracie, for example, had some middle-of-the-night vomiting that seemed like a routine stom­ach bug, but she died hours later in her sleep. Had anyone known she had MCAD, a quick glucose injection almost certain­ly would have saved her, Clay says. 
These are very rare diseases, thought together to strike about 4,000 babies a year. But a recent federal analysis suggests that more than 1,000 a year may go undiagnosed because of state testing variation. 
Fifteen states require testing for five or fewer of the diseases, according to the U.S. National Newborn Screening and Genetics Resource Center. Nineteen states test for 25 dis­eases or more; the rest fall in the middle. 

US falters in education rankings 
Nation still leads in spending per student 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -The United 
States is falling behind other 
countries in having a high­
school-educated public, with 
the gap widening the most 
among young adults, a new 
comparison of industrialized 
nations shows. 
A total of 87 percent of U.S. adults age 25 to 34 have fin­ished high school. which puts the country 1Oth behind quality, because many of them are already ahead." 

Although titled "Education at a Glance," the yearly report has ballooned into a 450-page compilation. Measuring 30 countries, it relies mostly on data from 2002 and 2001, although its achievement fig­ures date to 2000. Organizers call those the most current numbers available. 
The United States has a higher share of its population with at least a four-year col­lege education -38 percent -than any country other than Canada. The United States is second. behind

"They're catching up with you in the proportion that fin­ish school (and) the proportion that go to college," said Barry McGaw, director of education for the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which develops the yearly rankings. 

"The one area you remain ahead is how much you spend," McGaw told U.S. reporters Monday. "They don't need to catch up with you on States is slip­
ping, too, as other countries with tradition­ally lower college rates are closing the gap, the report says. 
"If we are less competitive educationally, we will soon become less competitive eco­nomically," Education Secretary Rod Paige ~aid. "That's just a cruel fact." 
The high school findings come as President Bush, in a tight re-election race, has promised more spending and testing in later grades to ensure a high school diploma has value. His opponent, Democratic Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts, has criticized Bush's administration for fail­ing to enforce the high school graduation provisions of its own education law. 
Paige said educational 

progress by any country is 
good news but .warned that 
U.S. slippage could erode its leadership in the world. He commended good schools yet said taxpayers must shed their mentality "that every school is above-average, especially our own." 
Among other findings: 
+ 
The United States finished near the top in fourth-grade reading performance in a com­parison of nine countries. But while four countries showed increases from 1991 to 2001, the U.S. performance was unchanged. One country, Sweden, dropped in perform­ance. 

+ 
The United States spends more per student on all levels of education-$10,871 ­than any other country. Per­student spending in other nations ranges from less than $3,000 in Mexico, Poland and the Slovak Republic to more than $8,000 in Austria, Denmark and Norway. 

+ 
The United States has the highest number of teaching hours per school year in the primary and high school grades. and the second high­est for middle-school stu­dents. 


Under the nation's educa­tion overhaul of 2002, schools must show yearly progress for many historically disad­'Vantaged groups, including minorities and children who speak little English.

Inaccuracies revealed inPeterson tnurder trial 
Associated Press 
HEDWOOD CITY. Calif. ­Satellite navigation devices used to track Scott Peterson's car after his wife's disappear­ance sometimes developed glitches, once indicating he was driving 30,000 mph, an expert in the technology acknowledged Monday at Peterson's murder trial. 
Prosecutors allege Peterson acted like a guilty man and lied to friends and relatives about his whereabouts during the search for his wife, Laci. Defense lawyers maintain he was trying to avoid media attention.

Prosecutors are trying to prove that Peterson killed his 8-months-pregnant wife on or around Dec. 24, 2002, then dumped her weighted body in San Francisco Bay. 
The bodies of Laci Peterson and her fetus washed up on shore in April 2003 not far from a marina where Scott Peterson says he launched his boat that Christmas Eve morn­ing for a solo fishing trip.

Peter Van Wyck Loomis, whose company, Trimble Navigation. made the devices, testified "there were some rare cases where it was off by 15 to 20 yards." 
In an effort to head off defense attacks on the devices. prosecutor Hick Distaso noted one instance when a tracking device showed Peterson's vehicle was moving at more Witnesses testi­

During pretrial hearings, defense lawyers fought to keep GPS testimony out of the trial. claiming it was unreli­able and prone to errors. GPS technology had not yet been qualified as acceptable evi­dence in a criminal trial in California. 
FDA looks at antidepressant labels 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON Tom 
Woodward's 17-year-old 
daughter Julie committed sui­
cide by hanging herself. He 
blamed the antidepressant 
that the teen had been taking 
for seven days. 
"We are certain that Zoloft 
killed our daughter," said 
Woodward, one of more than 
70 speakers enveloping federal 
health advisers Monday in an 
outpouring of emotion, tears 
and anger. 
Others witnesses, like 
Cynthia Wainscott, urged the 
Food and Drug Administration 
not to take away drugs that 
have reduced suicide rates 
among depressed youths. 
Two FDA advisory panels are considering whether agency action -including stronger warning labels -is needed on antidepressants because they have been linked to suicidal tendencies among children who take them. The joint panel will weigh the benefits of nine drugs given to depressed children against the risk that the remedies may increase suicidal thoughts and actions. 
"Drug companies have pur­posely deceived the public about the safety and efficacy of their drugs," Woodward said, calling for a strong, black warning on packaging for pop­ular antidepressants. 
Susan Bro. spokesman for Zoloft manufacturer Pfizer, would not comment on Woodward's allegations because of pending litigation. Zoloft, she said, is a "safe and effective drug when used as prescribed." 
Wainscott showed panel members a photograph of her granddaughter Jessi, who she said began suffering from depression at age 11. Now 15 and on medication, Jessi has returned to her normal self, her grandmother said. 

"Tell them not to do anything that will make people afraid to go for help," Wainscott said Jessi told her. Wainscott, chair of the National Mental Health Association, quoted her grand­daughter as saying antidepres­sants meant "there are no invisible strings pulling me down." 
Tarek Hammad, an FDA sen­ior medical reviewer, told the panel an additional 2 percent to 3 percent of children are likely to incur increased suici­dal thoughts from taking any antidepressant

Untreated depression is a serious illness that threatens the children's lives, said Dr. Laurence Greenhill, speaking on· behalf of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, which represents 7,000 child psychi­atrists. He said he found it reassuring that the FDA's detailed analysis did not find a single completed suicide among 4,440 depressed youth in drug company-sponsored clinical trials.

Mosholder was praised by grieving family members for requesting clarification last year from Paxil manufacturer GlaxoSmithKline. The data he received in May 2003 sug­gested a link between Paxil and increased suicidal acts among children taking it. 
Dr. Robert Temple, director of the FDA's office of drug evaluation, told reporters he had no regrets delaying the testimony at a previous hear­ing because he still thinks Mosholder's data may be flawed. 
Lawyers work to find jurors in capital case 
Associated Press 
BATON ROUGE, La. -Serial 
killings suspect Derrick Todd 
Lee went on trial for his life 
Monday with defense attorneys 
losing an effort to toss out the 
entire pool of potential jurors. 
State District Judge Richard Anderson rejected defense contentions that discrimination may have played a role in par­ing down the original list of 
1.300 people summoned for potential jury duty to just over 
400. The 400 filled out ques­tionnaires last week. 
The lead prosecutor in the first-degree murder case against Lee expected to take at least a week to find 12 jurors and four alternates. Lee's lawyer said seating an impar­tial jury in Baton Rouge will be impossible because of the extensive media coverage, and he wants the trial moved. 
But the judge said he would first try to find local residents who can give an unbiased ver­dict of whether Lee beat and stabbed 22-year-old Charlotte Murray Pace in a violent strug­gle throughout her home. 
Lee was arrested in May 2003. Authorities said DNA evidence linked him to the murders of seven women between April 1998 and March 2003 and the assault of a nurse who is expected to testi­fy that Lee tried to rape and kill her. 
Pace was killed May 31, 2002. Her partially clothed body was found in her room­mate's bedroom and she had been slashed, beaten and stabbed 81 times with a flat­head screwdriver and a knife. Detectives said her hands were bruised, suggesting she fought her attacker. 
Lee, 35, who sentenced last month to life in prison in· the murder of Geralyn DeSoto. Prosecutors did not seek the death penalty in the DeSoto case because they felt they couldn't prove the required "aggravating circumstances," such as a rape committed with a murder. to secure a death sentence. 
He could get the death penal­ty if convicted in the Pace case. 
Attorneys on Monday ques­tioned only six potential jurors, three of whom were dismissed. 
One prospective juror said she believed Lee was guilty of 
 the murder but could make her decision based solely on the evidence. Over defense objec­tions. the judge kept her in the pool, but she could be removed later in the process. 
The prospective jurors who were sent home were released over their views on the death penalty, not because of any bias against Lee.

President Bush seeks hurricane relief funds 
Septe111ber 11 conspirator on trial 


Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -The White House has decided to increase its newest request for hurricane aid to about $3.1 billion, and was expected to ask Congress for the money Tuesday, Bush administra­tion and congressional aides said. 
President Bush had been expected to submit a $2.5 billion request Monday covering some of the damage that Hurricanes Charley and Frances inflicted on Florida. 
But administra­money for midwestern farmers hurt by drought and floods this year. 

"They are not the only ones who have been hard hit in the last few years," Conrad said of Floridians. 
When Congress approved Bush's initial $2 billion request for hurricane aid in a single day on Sept. 7 -with no amend­ments -Senate leaders agreed that lawmakers would be allowed to seek money for their own states' prob­lems in the next

Virginia, said one congressional aide, who like the others spoke on con­dition of anonymity. 
The election-year request was a politically sensitive one because of its effect on Florida, once again a potentially pivotal state in this November's elections. 
White House budget office spokesman Chad Kolton said offi­cials were still finishing the request's details. 
Administration officials were hoping Congress could act quickly on the request. But its speed was in question because lawmakers from other regions said they would try adding additional funds for natural disasters their areas have suffered. 
Sen. Kent Conrad. D-N.D.. said he and a bipartisan group of sena­tors would try adding about $2.5 billion to the measure, including also acknowl­
edged. "There probably are a lot more people who will come forward and say, 'We have emergencies."' 
The aides said the request would not include potential dam­age from Hurricane Ivan, which is projected to hit the Florida Panhandle or other Gulf Coast areas later this week. 
Aides said $1.5 billion of the money would be for the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which helps individual and state and local agencies after natural disasters. 
The remaining money would include funds for other federal agencies that are either dis­bursing aid or that sustain damage at their facilities. That includes the Small Business Administration, NASA and the Defense Department.

Prosecution can seek death penalty 
Associated Press 

WASHINGTON -An appeals 
court ruled Monday for a second 
time that the government can 
seek to execute Zacarias 
Moussaoui, the only US defen­
dant charged with a role in the 
al-Qaida conspiracy that led to . the Sept. 11 attacks. 
In a ruling that allows trial 
preparations to proceed. the 
court also said Moussaoui must 
be given access to statements 
from three al-Qaida witnesses 
who made statemen~s that may 
help his defense. 

The opinion appeared to give 
Moussaoui's lawyers their first 
opportunity to submit questions 
to the al-Qaida leaders. two of 
whom planned the Sept. 11 
attacks. However, an explana­
tion of the defense's new author­
ity was blacked out by the 
judges because of national secu­
rity concerns. 

Moussaoui, the only U.S. 
defendant charged with crimes 
related to the Sept. 11 attacks. 
contends he had no role in plan­
ning the hijackings. The three 
high al-Qaida officials in custody 
could reinforce that claim. 

In afflrming a lower court rul­
ing, the three-judge panel found 
"the enemy combatant witness­
es could provide material. favor­
able testimony on Moussaoui's 
behalf." 

But the panel said the lower 
court's remedy of removing the 
death penalty was not the prop­
er way to penalize the govern­
ment for refusing to grant 
Moussaoui adequate access to 
the witness statements. 

Rather. the court said, the 
solution should have been for 
the defense. the prosecution and the judge to decide which state­ments in support of Moussaoui would be presented to a jury. The defense must have a major role in crafting a compromise, the court said. 
In reaffirming the death penalty, the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Va.. said "no punitive sanction is warranted" by the government's attempt to protect national secu­rity by limiting defense access to witness statements . 
U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema in Alexandria. Va.. also had barred any Sept. 11­related evidence, but the appeals court also threw out that ruling. · 
Two of the al-Qaida witnesses are top Sept. 11 masterminds Ramzi Binalshibh and Khalid Shaikh Mohammed. The opinion identifies the three witnesses as 
A. Band C. 

Moussaoui was arrested on immigration charges after offi­cials of a Minneapolis flight school became suspicious of his poor flying skills. 
The commission that studied the Sept. 11 attacks reported that Mohammed may have instructed Binalshibh to send money to Moussaoui to help pre­pare him as a substitute pilot. 
Mohammed "denies ever con­sidering Moussaoui for the planes operation," the report said. "Instead he claims that Moussaoui was slated to partici­pate in a 'second wave' of attacks." · 
The commission said, howev-· er, it believed "the effort to push Moussaoui forward in August 2001 lends credence to the sus­picion that he was being primed as a possible pilot in the imme­diate planes operation. Binalshibh says he assumed Moussaoui was to take his place as another pilot in the 9111 operation." 
The court opinion said each of the three witnesses has made statements to interrogators that would support Moussaoui, and one would undermine a possible government theory that Moussaoui was to have flown a plane into the White House on Sept. 11. 
Witness A's statements are "consistent with Moussaoui's claim that he was to be part of a post-September 11 operation," the court said. 
Frank Dunham Jr.. the federal public defender representing Moussaoui. declined to comment on the ruling. 
Attorney General John Ashcroft called the ruling a vic­tory for the government, saying it "once again affirms our belief that the government can provide Zacarias Moussaoui with a fair trial while still protecting national security interests." 
The court said crafting wit­ness statements for the jury must be "an interactive process" among the trial judge Brinkema Moussaoui 's lawyers and prosecutors. 
A section of the ruling was entitled "Submission of Questions by Moussaoui." While a fuller explanation was blacked out, the heading would only have significance if this was being allowed for the first time. 
The court said "accuracy and fairness are best achieved by compiling substi­tutions that use the exact lan­guage" of summaries of wit­ness statements. 
Defense lawyers should identify portions of the state­ments that Moussaoui may want to admit into evidence, and the government has the right to object, the court said.

Sears sells new products online 
Associated Press 

NEW YORK -Sears, Roebuck and Co., which has successfully sold its tools and appliances on the Web, is counting on having the same magic with bedspreads and sweaters, thanks in part to expert­ise gained by its purchase of Lands' End Inc. 
The company's venture into online sales of home furnishings and apparel, which officially launches Monday, may be consid­ered late. But executives say tap­ping into the expertise of Lands' End -which it acquired two years ago and is considered a leading innovator of online selling -will enable Sears to jump ahead of the competition. 
"We are going to leapfrog further than anybody else right now online," said Bill Bass, vice presi­dent and general manager of Sears' customer direct division. "We're starting where Lands' End is and pushing it further." 
Sears.com has incorporated some of the same features that Lands' End pioneered on the Web, such as the "virtual model," where cus­tomers can enter body measure­ments such as waist and bust size to get an idea of how the outfit will look. But there are other features not yet available on Landsend.com such as a zooming technology that focuses on fabric and texture of the merchandise. Sears.com customers

Struggling team cannot afford many more losses 
By JUSTIN STETZ Sports Writer 
The Saint Mary's volleyball team hopes to earn its second win of the season as they travel to take on Bethel College today. After beating Tri-State University over the weekend, the Belles are look­ing to start a new streak. 
"Capturing our first win against Tri-State gave our team some much needed con­fidence and showed us how good it feels to win as a team," junior outside attack­er Michelle Turley said. 
A year ago, Saint Mary's lost to Bethel at home on Oct. 2 in three straight games. So far this season, the Pilots are 3-1. In its first tournament of the season, Bethel knocked off two ranked teams by wide margins. The Pilots should be a difficult test for the Belles.

In past years, the extremely aggressive style of the Adrian team might have proved too much for Saint Mary's. But this year, the team seems capable of meeting such a challenge in stride. 
"They played a really strong, physical game against us, but we stepped up to the plate and did not take them lightly," Courtney said. "Everyone worked well togeth­er; our team chemistry is look­ing really good. A team at Saint Mary's has neYer been this strong, and we want to reset the standard at this school." 
With its win against Adrian, the team moves one step closer to its goal of bringing the MIAA title to Saint Mary's. 
"This was a great way to start off in the MIAA," MacMillan said. "We gained a lot of momentum from a win like this. We've set our goals high. We don't want to be a team that gets taken lightly. We want to be the team that no one wants to play."

The weekend was a bit of a disappointment for the Notre Dame women's golf team. 
The team traveled to Ann Arbor, Mich. to compete in the Lady Northern Invitational, where it placed eighth in a field of 15. The Irish logged a 57-over-par 921. Host Michigan won the event, shoot­ing a combined 881 to hold off second-place Ohio State by four strokes. 
The Irish had trouble staying steady over the three-round 
sistency," coach Debby King said. 
However, the weekend was not completely lost for the Irish. Juniors Katie Brophy and Lauren Gebauer each scored an 11-over-par 227 to finish in a five-way tie for 17th. In Saturday's second round, Brophy shot a 3-under 69, helping to bring about the team's impressive round that afternoon and giving herself the second best single round score of the tournament. Gebauer continued her strong play from a week ago and has begun the season as one of the Irish's strongest golfers. 
"[Gebauer]'s really been on a roll right now," King said. 
Sophomore Noriko Nakazaki finished tied for 26th after she shot a 229, and joined Gebauer as the only golfers to shoot in the 70s for all three rounds. Karen Lotta, who set the Warren Golf Course single round record a week ago, struggled on her way to scor­ing a 241 for the Notre Dame team. 
"This just goes to show you how it can be from one week­end to the next in golf." King said. "Last weekend she shot a 68 and this weekend she's struggling to break 80." 
Freshman Jane Lee and sophomore Stacy Brown rounded out the Notre Dame lineup in Ann Arbor. In her second tournament for the Irish, Lee shot a 244, and Brown finished with a 247 in her first appearance in the scoring lineup this season. 
After this weekend's per­formance, King sees some defi­nite areas to focus on improv­ing for upcoming events. 
"We're going to start next practice with green reading and putting," she said. "I got the stat sheet back. and it seemed to be a common flaw this weekend."

The last time the Irish played the Spartans in East Lansing at night was in 1998 coming off an upset of defending national champion Michigan. 
The Spartans came out fired up and built a 42-3 halftime lead. 
All of the ingredients are there again for the Irish to be upset -a nationally televised game, at night and on the road. 
That's why this team is trying to usc what it learned at BYU to prevent all the hard work that went into stunning Michigan from going to waste. 
"They play real hard against us, especially a night game," defensive lineman Justin Tuck said. "It's a buzz saw. It's going to bn a tough game going in there and coming out with a victory.

The women's team did not have its top eight runners present at the Crusader Invitational. Coach Tim Connelly instead sent his less experienced runners to race in a major competition. 
"We returned most of our team from last year that fin­ished lOth in the NCAAs," Connelly said. "We've got some kids that, with time, are going to contribute." 
Irish Sophomore Katie DeRusso came across the fin­ish line at 23:19 to take 13th, 14th and 15th spots consecutively to give the Irish a final score of 53. 
Western Michigan won the women's race with 35 points followed by Wisconsin­Madison in second with 41 points.

The only potentially major mistake Holiday made was not calling for a fair catch with a Michigan defender barreling down on him. Holiday drew a 15-yard interference penalty, but he attributed the decision to being inexperienced. 
"I saw him corning, but I'm new at this," Holiday said with a smile. "I don't know what a fair catch is in those types of situations. I just want to make a play."

ND WOMEN'S SOCCER 

Undefeated Irish earn No.1 ranking 
By MATT MOONEY Sports Writer 
When the smoke cleared from a competitive weekend in women's soccer, Monday's Soccer America magazine poll showed Notre Dame standing atop all the rest with the No. 1 national ranking. 
The Irish (6-0-0) defeated 

No. 11 Arizona State 2-1 and jumped to the top spot after previous No. 1 North Carolina (5-0-1) blemished its perfect record with a scoreless tie against now No. 13 Tennessee. 
Notre Dame last held the No. 1 ranking in 2000 when it breezed through the regular season before bowing out in the NCAA semifinals to eventu­al national champion North Carolina. 
The Irish have already proven their mettle early in the season, defeating three teams who, at the time, were ranked in the top 15, including then No. 4 Santa Clara. Utilizing a creative offense and stingy defense, the Irish have established themselves as one of the nation's most complete teams, outscoring opponents by a 21-5 margin. 
Junior forward Katie Thorlakson has led the way on offense with a team high 17 points. Last week, she became the first women's soccer play­er in school history to be named Big East Player of the Week in two consecutive weeks. 
Senior Candace Chapman and sophomore Jen 
Buczkowski have provided ample support on the offensive end while fifth-year defender Melissa Tancredi has anchored a formidable defense. 
Other national polls will be released later today to deter­mine if Notre Dame is the con­sensus No. 1 team.

Chain unites entire team 
Defense's attitude infects and 1notivates rest of Irish players 
By MATT LOZAR Spores Writer 
Everything having to do with the number 38 is over. Now it's about focusing on a chain. 
The Irish brought a new point of motivation onto the field, courtesy of Derek Curry, prior to handing

revenge to Michigan. "Goolsby returns 
'That chain to special roots" is about unity, about page 26 
playing together as a team, about being unselfish. That's all it's about," Curry said. "It's not about me, the defense, the offense or special teams. You are only as strong as your weakest link. 
"It's something our defensive coaches came up with, and I think it's excellent to say what this season is about. Nobody else gave us a chance, but we knew what we had in this room, so that's what it was about." 
The loss to Brigham Young put a lot of doubts in the minds of fans, but Saturday's win restored a lot of confidence in the Irish. Now the chain will bring a message of what this team has experienced. 
"It reminds us of everything we've gone through," defensive lineman Kyle Budinscak said. "Without the effort of every­body on the team, we are all nothing. We've worked con­stantly in the off-season to do something like that. Before we pat ourselves on the back, we have 10 more [games) to go."

CLAIRE KELLEYfThe Observer 

Derek Curry presents a chain to his teammates to signify the unity and link of efforts on offense, defense and special teams. 
Budinscak assuming the Irish go to a bowl game -starts Saturday in East Lansing against Michigan State. 
The Spartans have been a pesky team for the Irish ·over the past seven seasons. winning six of those last seven contests between the teams -the best mark of any Irish opponent over that time frame. 
Nobody can seem to put a fin­ger on why Michigan State has had so much success against Notre Dame. 
"The one thing about this game is Michigan State is going to play their best game," Curry said. "No matter what we see on film or what we see before, they always play their best game against us, no matter what the season looks like." 
Many of those seven games have been close, coming down to one play in the closing min­utes. Like many opponents, Michigan State sees Notre Dame as the biggest game on its schedule. A win over the Irish can make a team's season.

Forn1er n1anager lifts squad to beat Adrian 
By RYAN DUFFY Spores Writer 

This time last year. sopho­more forward Cat MacMillan was the soccer team's manag­er, cheering the Belles on from the sidelines. This year, she's the one leading them to victo­ry. 
MacMillan -playing in her first collegiate game -scored a goal and added an assist to help Saint Mary's defeat Adrian 3-0 in the team's first conference game. 
"I knew I had to work hard to get to where I am. and I've given everything I have to try to contribute to this team," 
said MacMillan. "This is a 
team where every single play­
er contributes something." 

Like many of the players, MacMillan feels an added incentive to succeed this sea­son. 
, "We definitely have a lot to play for this year," she said. "This is the first year where Saint Mary's has had a team with this kind of talent and drive, and we're looking to take that far. We want to earn some respect for our school and its athletic program." 
The Belles' offense was impressive in the first step of their quest for an MIAA title,

Belles win, move up in conference 
By JUSTIN STETZ SportS Writer 

The Belles got their first taste of victory Friday night in the second game of the Saint Mary's 
Triangular. See Also 
Saint Mary's fell to Calvin "Belles' Bethel College in 
trip crucial"
the first game of the page 25 evening, los­ing in three games by scores of 30-19, 30­25 and 30-23. But the Belles were able to defeat Tri-State later ~on in a three-game sweep. Playing two games in one day didn't seem to affect the team's performance. 
"Playing two games on Friday night isn't much differ­ent," middle hitter Elise Rupright said. "There is enough time to regroup and make adjustments in between the games." 
Currently, th·e Belles are 1-5 overall and 1-4 in the MIAA. The win pulled Saint Mary's out of last place in the confer­ence and could give them some momentum going into their next game on Tuesday against Bethel College.
