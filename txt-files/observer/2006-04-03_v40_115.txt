Students seek jobs for break 
Center can help find last-minute options 
By ADRIENNE RUFFNER News Writer 
While many Notre Dame stu­dents have already landed internships in their home­towns, in new cities, or even in foreign countries, it isn't too late to find the perfect sum­mer job. · 
Susanne Thorup, manager of internship development at the Career Center, said while most employers have already hired their interns for the summer, some are still looking for qual­ified students to fill positions. 
"It's the end of recruiting season, but we can still help students tap into lots of resources." Thorup said. "There are still lots of local internships available for stu­dents who will be staying on campus this summer." 
Hundreds of employers have interviewed students on cam­pus in the Career Center dur­ing the past few months, Thorup said. Most of those were for business majors, but the Career Center prides itself on its wide variety of resources for all majors, par­ticularly on its Web site, she said. 
The Web site features Golrish, a database where stu­dents can search for hundreds of internships across the coun­try, and Hot Internships, a site focusing on particular intern­ships that might attract stu­dents. 
Summer internships are not limited to business majors and those in other career-specific fields, Thorup said. 
"We have helped students find all types of internships,"

("Seven Swans"), and he is a man 
who also plays most of 20 or more 
instruments incorporated into his 
music. 
Many of you have heard his suc­cessful and very hyped indie album "Illinois," the second installation of his epic conception -a CD about each of the 50 states that aims to capture different experiences, his­tories, and feelings of each region through music. 
lie is Suf]an Stevens. 
"Illinois" is the second release of Suf]an's 50 state project, the first embracing his horne state, Michigan ("Greetings from Michigan, The Creal Lakes State"). Stevens draws from personal expe­riences, state heritage, regional history, and political and social issues for his "Crentings from Michigan, th11 Creat Lakes State" with songs about snowmobiles, Henry Ford, the Dntroit Hace Hiots and love. 
lin has said he plans on approaching other states by doing a lot of obsnrving, listening and research and thnn using personal experiences, relationships and his­tory along with borrowing stereo­types -the same stuff he says he does for fiction writing. 
Suf]an is passing on history through the oral tradition of song, whieh is such a rieh and mystic way to tell a culturn about itself. It's not a tnxtbook or a movie, but it's pnrsonal intnrspection about coming to terms with being ameri­~~a in a way that is "a serious effort to ~~ombinn history and myth and gnographical eolor with stories in song. " 
Suf]an wants to expand the proj­ect into othnr forms. lie is contem­plating a Christmas CD most likely for Vermont, and an EP or split 7­inch for Hhode Island. 
Which state will come next is a mystery to us all, and if it is evnn possible to put out 50 releases, as this concept has nagnrly claimed, it is absolutely ridiculous. This is a monumental artistic nndnavor that I promisn will be nothing short of brilliant. I know that I am going to buy each release, and I'll be wait­ing anxiously for California.

Thief apprehended sumo wrestlers OSAKA, Japan  - by A  

Japanese burglar who thought he was lucky to find an unloekBd door was shockBd to be arrBsted by 20 massiyB sumo wrBstlers who were staying at the building. 
Konoshin Kawabata, 48, was rummaging inside a room in Osaka in the early hours when he was sud­denly confronted by wrestler Dewanosato, who stands 180 centimetres and weighs 131 kilograms. 
"Without thinking, my body moved," Dewanosato, whose real name is Hideyuki Kawahara, said. "I caught the guy and bear­hugged him." 
It was a citizen's arrest, said a police spokesman. 
"Mr Dewanosato immedi­ately shouted out 'Hey!' and 'Burglar!' as he arrest­ed the man. Then the other wrestlers woke up and eame out to cheek things out," the spokesman said.

The massive salad con­tained 110 heads of let­tuce, 165 pounds of carrots and about 120 cucumbers, and was prepared in a swimming pool. 
It took about 2 1/2 hours to prepare and a hungry crowd gobbled it up in about four hours Thursday, said Cheryl Mitchem, co­ordinator of the weight management program through the Tug River Health Association. 
Mitchem s'aid the salad represented the total pounds lost by about 27 people over a five-month period that ended Mareh 1.

By RYAN SYDLIK 
News Writer 
Created to educate Notre Dame students_ about the politi­cal and economic struggles of the African continent, Africa Woek 2006 kicks off today with a full schedule of speakers and cultural events. 
This is the second year for Africa Week, which is put on by Notre Dame's African Faith and .Justice Network along with the African Student Association. The. African Faith and 
The Hunger Banquet will be held at 6 p.m. Tuesday in the Coleman Morse Lounge. Attendees are asked to make a $5 donation, and proceeds from the banquet will go directly to Oxfam famine relief efforts in East Africa. 
The other keynote event, "Mourning Genocide and Stopping One," will take place at 7 p.m. Thursday in the Center for Social Concerns Coffeehouse. The lecture will mark the 12th anniversary of the Rwandan genocide and will address its

Feeney said the week is important to Notre Dame and its students because of its Catholic character. 
"One of the reasons for the week is the fact Catholic bishops called Americans to stand in sol­idarity with Africa," Feeney said. 
"It doesn't matter if it is far away or if they have different backgrounds -they are still fel­low Catholics and fellow people. There are many Catholics, as well as others, in dire situations that we need to do something about," she added. 
Feeney said Americans have the power to change their gov­ernment's policies toward Africa · and to demand more assistance. 
"We have the ability to lobby our government to help people out of poverty and to stop wars," she said.

Research sheds light on antibiotic function 
Special to The Observer 
For nearly half a century, scientists have known that bacteria possess a cell wall. Since the health and integrity of the cell wall are critical to the survival of these organ­isms, it is not surprising that many antibiotics work by either impairing biosynthesis of the cell wall, or simply bind to it to inhibit its full structur­al maturation. 
Now, a new research study led by Notre Dame chemist Shahriar Mobashery has pro­vided, for the first time, a clear understanding of the structure of peptidoglycan, the building unit of the cell wall. This knowledge has led to a three-dimensional depic­tion of the cell wall structure itself, which has, in turn, con­tributed to an understanding of how certain antibiotics interfere with the functioning of the cell wall. 
Roughly 50 years ago, sci­entists determined that the cell wall of bacteria consists of peptidoglycan, a mesh-like network. Peptidoglycan is the building block of the bacterial cell wall and neighboring peptidoglycans undergo a so­called "cross-linking" reac­tion to generate the rigid enti­ty known as the cell wall. Since bacteria cannot regu­late their internal pressure, bacterial cells would burst apart and die if cross-linking did not occur. 
Although scientists recog­nized the critical role peptido­gylcan plays in the bacterial cell wall, they have been unable to determine its exact three-dimensional structure. 
"Samples of peptidogylcan did not exist in either suffi­cient purity or quantity for researchers to be able to describe its structure and that of the bacterial cell wall," said Mobashery, the Navari Family Professor of Life Sciences. 
Mobashery and his team were able to· finally charac­terize the framework of pepti­doglycan by developing, through a painstaking 37 -step procedure, a synthetic frag­ment of the cell wall in a lab. And, through extensive stud­ies of the fragment, the researchers were able to characterize the structure of the cell wall. 
The breakthrough reveals what the cell wall looks like and provides insights into how B-lactam (e.g., penicillin) and glycopeptide (e.g., van­comycin) antibiotics are able to impair the bacterial cell wall. 
"For the first time, we can visualize how this entity that is critical' for the survival of bacteria looks and operates," Mobashery said. "And, as the old saying goes, a picture is as good as a thousand words." 

Feeney highlighted the Hunger Banquet for Famine in East Africa and "Mourning a Genocide and Stopping One­Hwanda and Darfur" -the two events of Africa 'Week she thought would be most vital in addressing the crisis in Africa to students.

which is the point of develop­
ment at which a fetus is 
capable of living outside the 
uterus. 
"After viability, they cannot 
ban abortions if an abortion 
provider daims that the pro­
cedure in question is neces­
sary to preserve any aspect of 
the woman's well being­
financial, psychological or 
familial." 
Tho state abortion bans 
struck down in Stenberg did 
not include exceptions for 
health both because such an 
exemption has been found 
unnecessary and because it 
would severely constrain the 
practical effects of a ban. 
"llfHtlth is [currently] 
defined so broadly that it 
prevents the political branch­
es from limiting abortion at 
all," Snead said. "The 
American Medical 
Association has stated that 
partial birth abortion is 'not 
good medicine' and is never 
necessary to preserve the 
health of a woman." 
In deeiding Gonzales, the 
Court may choose to redefine 
health -a definition Snead 
said is the single most impor­
tant factor in abortion deci­
sions -in a more "common­
sense way." 
With its recent additions of 
Chief Justice John Hoberts 
and .Justice Samuel Alito, the 
Court is likely to uphold the 
federal act and overturn 
Stenberg, both professors 
said. Alito, who Kommers 
and Snead said will likely 
vote to uphold the federal 
ban, replaced Justice Sandra 
Day O'Connor, who voted 
with the majority in Stenberg 
to strike down the state ban. 
"I think it's likely the Court will overturn Stenberg in a 5­4 decision," Snead said, adding that the question con­sidered in deciding relevant cases is always what the Constitution requires in the abortion context. 
The Court is unlikely to admit to making a mistake in its Stenberg deeision, Kommers said, but "in some matters, the Court is more deferential to congressional than to state laws." 
"I think here the Court will defer to Congress' judgment on the matter because of its superior fact-finding capabil­ities, findings of fact that in effect conclude that a ban on partial birth abortion poses no real threat to the health of the pregnant woman," he said. 
The case, Snead and Kommers agreed, may have an extremely significant impact upon the future of eonstitutional law. 
If Stenberg is overturned, "the elected branches of gov­ernment will, for the first time in 33 years, have an opportunity to impose mean­ingful limitations on abor­tions," Snead said. 

An overruling of Stenberg would undermine Hoe because the latter decision prohibited bans on abortions in the third trimester if they were needed to preserve the mother's life or health, Kommers said. 
"Thn case would result in the further hollowing out of the Hoe case," he said. 
The Court is expected to roach a decision sometime in the fall.

INTERNATIONAL NEWS 
U.S. diplomatic policies criticized 
GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip -Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh criticized the United States on Sunday for restricting diplomatic ties with the llamas government, saying his people were being punished for electing the militant Islamic group. 
Seeking to end chaos in the Gaza Strip, Palestinian Interior Minister Said Siyam pledged the new government would pacify the area but appealed for patience. "Let them bear with us for a year," he said. Four people were killed and 36 wounded in unrest over th11 weekend. 
The United States said Friday that American diplomats have been forbidden to make con­tact with officials in any Palestinian govern­ment agency controlled by l-lamas. whose charter calls for Israel's destruction. The Islamic group's new Cabinet controls every ministry. 
Three killed in bus bombing 
ISTANBUL, Turkey -A group of men stopped a passenger bus and tossed gasoline bombs at it, sending the vehicle careening into pedestrians and killing three in Turkey's largest city on Sunday as pro-Kurdish riots continued to spread. 
In the country's heavily Kurdish southeast, a pro-Kurdish demonstrator was killed, and local officials blamed police for his death. 
Clashes between Kurdish demonstrators and security forces have spread from the southeast to Istanbul, which has a large Kurdish population. 
In the attack in Istanbul's Bagcilar district, the driver reversed his naming vehicle onto a sidewalk after the bombing, running down a group of people nearby, police said. 
NATIONAL NEWS 
Identity theft study figures released 
WASHINGTON -An estimated 3.6 million 
U.S. households-or about three out of every 100 -reported being victims of iden­tity theft, according to a government study that counted misuse of someone else's cell phone, credit card or personal information. 
The figures released Sunday by the Justice Department differ from findings of a previous government study that counted 9.3 million victims of the crime. 
The department said the most frequent victims of identity theft were households headed by people age 18 to 24; those in urban or suburban areas; and those with incomes of at least $75,000. 

Two killed, four missing in car crash 
HENDERSON, Ky. -Police found the bodies of two women Sunday inside a sport utility vehicle that had plunged into the Ohio River, and were searching for four men a survivor said also were in the

A woman who managed to swim to shore told police she was riding in the vehicle when her friend drove down a boat ramp into the water around 2:30 a.m. 
Jamie Rakestrew, 26, said she and her friends met the men at a bar and were giving them a ride, but she did not know their names, officials said.

VATICAN CITY 

Pope John Paul II remembered 
Thousands gather to mark the first anniversary of his death with a prayer vigil 
Associated Press 

VATICAN CITY-Tens of thousands of people clutching candles filled St. Peter's Square on Sunday to mark the first anniver­sary of Pope John Paul II's death with a prayer vigil that culminated with a blessing by the current pontiff. 
Polish nags fluttered in the cool evening breeze, the candles twinkled and a choir sang hymns during the vigil, which ended with the blessing by Benedict XVI at 9:37 p.m. -the moment the Polish pope died a year ago. 
The scene resembled that before John Paul passing, when pilgrims from around the world prayed beneath his studio apartment windows. 
"He continues to be present in our minds and our hearts; he continues to communicate his love for God and his love for man, he continues to arouse in everyone, especially the young, enthusiasm for goodness and the courage to follow Jesus and his teachings," Benedict told the crowd, which he joined in reciting the rosary from one of the windows.

"We hope to provide posi­tive ehangns to Saint Mary's that will be effective and con­tinue throughout the years," Siefert said. "The key goal when it comes to student gov­ernments is to try to think of new innovative ideas that will get our campus exeited about who we are and let them be able to show their pride on campus." 
To fostnr this increased sense of College pride and tradition, Mellduff and Siefert plan to organize the second annual Heritage Week -an event created by Mitros and Melldul'f' and denmcd by changes to the College. They will be sadly missed, and hopefully we will find a replacement that will sustain the growth they have con­tributed." 
Mclldufl'. who sits on the Vice President of Student Affairs search committee, said the College's openness to seek student input on the hir­ing shows its dedication to the desires and needs of the student body as a whole. 
Together, Mcllduff and Siefert said their leadership would not only be based on a close relation­ship with administrators 
not make a dif­

Mcllduff agreed and stressed the need for con­stant change to avoid falling into a routine that would result in a lack of excitement for their work. 
"Whether it be special activities or academic prob­lems, we need to be going after what the students want." she said. 
So far in their short-lived term, the two said they have already felt a sense of unity and friendship amongst the new board of governance.

Shappell

"proactive" in its initiatives, especially when pushing for better community relations 
the issue Shappell believes will define her administration. 
"I would say in Dave and I's administration, we laid the groundwork," Shappell said. "Now Bill and I have the opportunity to take that and form it how we would like to leave it for future stu­dent governments." 
Shappell and Andrichik will attack the community relations initiative on all fronts -most notably by enhancing the lines of com­munication between the South Bend Common Council and Notre Dame students. 
"We want to establish the idea that in the future, if there are going to be any 
major ordi­nances [or] major acts by the city that ultimately affect students, that they aren't done in a man­ner that does­n't take into account stu­dent voice, Andrichik said, referring to the amendment to the disorderly house ordi­nance passed this summer by the Council placing stricter 
rules  on  off­ 
campus  par­ 
ties.  

Andrichik said the most effective way to do this is to open the lines 
of communication between the city and the students whether with the Common Council, its subcommittee on community relations, neigh­borhood watch groups or the South Bend police. 
"Hopefully with our increased contact with [these groups] ... there will already be that channel of conversation open so they'll choose that route in the future," Andrichik said. 
And Shappell has not given up on addressing the ordi­nance itself-a point of concern among many off­campus students, she said. The amended ordinance allows for an eviction after 
the first offense -a provi­sion Shappell wants to change. 
"If it's by changing the ordinance itself or working with those who enforce the law, [we want the ordinance! to better reflect that !more fair provisions]." Shappell said. "Either way we'd be pleased." 
Though progress on the community relations issue might be abstract, Shappell and Andrichik have more tangible priorities that they started tackling immediately after they were elected in the general election Feb. 13. 
Shappell has started taking steps to ensure that "a per­manent voice for minority students on policy issues" is established in the coming weeks. This comes after the Student Senate's rejection of a resolution calling for the creation of a permanent Minority Affairs committee at their meeting Wednesday. 
"We're putting together somewhat ofa focus group of students to offer all options possible for how to integrate the Minority Affairs committee and the Diversity committee['s] agendas into permanent structures in the Constitution." 
Lizzi Shappell student body president Notre Dame 
"We're put­ting together somewhat of a focus group of students to offer all options possi­ble for how to integrate the Minority Affairs com­mittee and Diversity com­mitteel's] agendas into permanent structures in t h e Constitution," Shappell said. "We're work­ing with minority and majority stu­dents to see the most effec­tive structure." 
The resolu­tion that would 

have made the current ad­hoc Minority Affairs commit­tee permanent was criticized by senators for not drawing a clear enough delineation between Minority Affairs committee and the Diversity committee. 
"We realized we didn't put in enough time to see what would be the best structure," Shappell said. "''ve always wanted to see permanent minority voice on policy issues." 
Andrichik has also been in talks with Notre Dame Food Services [NDFSI to create a list of 9 or 10 potential addi­tions to the current Grab­and-Go selection. Students will be given a survey to determine the most popular choices and then the top three or four will be added in the fall. 
"Food Serviees has been 
extremely encouraging and 
wanted to work with us on 
this," Andrichik said. "Since 
we got started on it so early, 
they can start right away 
with the new school year." 
The College Headership Program was the brainchild of the Baron administration and a point of contention in recent weeks due to student government's funding of it. 
The program will start this fall, Shappell said, pending approval by the Financial Management Board. She said she has no reason to believe FMB would deny funding for the program. which will bring 1,600 copies of USA Today, the Chieago Tribune and the New York Times to various locations every weekday. 
"We are working with Food Services and students and USA Today College Headership for an effective recycling and awareness campaign encouraging stu­dents to recycle their paper for other students so every­one who wants to read a paper is able to," Shappell said. 
Other initiatives the pair plans on tackling before the school year's end are pep rally student seating issues, pre-pep rally student-alumni receptions and wider student access to the alumni contact network -a lofty project that will require a great deal of time and coordination, Andrichik said. 
"That doesn't necessarily have the fall deadline, but it will take a lot of time," he said. "It involves cooperation from students, the Career Center, Alumni center, the administration and !the Office of Information Technology)." 
Shappell said students should be excited about the new administration because "we will bring results." 
"With our experience we're able to hit the ground running like few student governments I can think of in the past," Shappell said. "We have a fantastic group of people around us with lots of experience and lots of new ideas. Even above and beyond our platform. stu­dents will see change next year."

IN BRIEF 
Consumer spending, incomes down 
WASIIINGTON -Consumer spending slowed to the weakest pace in six months in February, while incomes grew at the slowest rate since November. 
The Commerce Department said Friday that personal consumption spending rose by a weaker-than-expected 0.1 percent follow­ing the huge 0.8 percent increase in January, which had been aided by a mild winter. 
Personal incomes were up 0.3 percent in February, less than half the 0. 7 percent January jump, which had been boosted by government pay raises and by cost-of-living adjustments for millions of Social Security recipients. 

Whirlpool finalizes Maytag acquisition 
DES MOINES, Iowa-Whirlpool Corp. com­pleted its acquisition of Maytag Corp. on Friday and said it will immediately begin integrating the two appliance companies.

The agreement paid Maytag shareholders $10.50 in cash and 0.1193 of a share in Whirlpool stock for each share of Maytag stock held 
The value of the deal is about $2.6 billion, including the assumption of Maytag debt. 

Court dismisses Mattei patent lawsuit 
NEW YOHK -Toy maker Mattei Inc. on Friday said a federal court in Delaware dis­missed a patent lawsuit brought against the company and its Fisher-Price subsidiary by rival LeapFrog Enterprises Inc. 
The lawsuit was originally filed by LeapFrog in October 2003 and revolved around Fisher-Price's PowerTouch toy, which is an interactive book that helps children learn reading and other skills. 
On Thursday, a U.S. District judge found that El Segundo, Calif.-based Mattei and Fisher-Priee did not infringe the LeapFrog patent. 

Delphi to close several plants 
'Noncore' facilities targeted in company's plans to emerge from bankruptcy 
Associated Press 
INDIANAPOLIS Anderson's Delphi Corp. plant didn't make the list of plants the nation's largest auto parts supplier says it must have when it emerges from bankruptcy. 
Kokomo's did. 
The difference for thou­sands of workers in both central Indiana cities is their jobs. 
Troy, Mich.-based Delphi filed for bankruptcy in October and intends to emerge from bankruptcy during the first half of 2007. To meet that goal, it plans to exit certain prod­uct lines and sell or close noncore plants by 2008, including 21 of its 29 U.S. plants. 
"We very clearly laid out where the core manufac­turing sites are," company spokesman Lindsey Williams said. "If you're not included in that option there are three options ­sale, wind down, or reloca­tion." 

The eight core plants, including the 5,000-worker Kokomo operation, will focus on product lines such as safety features, elec­tronics, diesel and gas powertrains and climate control products. The other 21 plants would be sold or phased out, or some of their operations 27,000 workers in the city Kokomo plant, which "There will be some job could be shifted to core about 35 miles northeast of might better the chances of adjustments," Kokomo plants, Williams said.

FRANCE 

Lucent Technologies purchased by rival 
Associated Press 

PAHIS -Alcatel SA and Lucent Technologies Inc. announced Sunday that the French telecommunications equipment maker had agreed to buy its U.S. rival in order to form a major new global player in the industry. About 8,800 jobs will be cut. 
The combined company, to be based in Paris, will have annual sales of 21 billion euros ($25 billion) -close to the 2005 revenue posted by world No. 1 Cisco Systems Inc. -and generate 
1.4 billion euros ($1. 7 billion) of sav­ings within three years, the companies said. 
The companies said the cost savings would come from several areas, including consolidating support func­tions, leveraging research and develop­ment and services across a larger base and cutting about 1 0 percent of their combined worldwide work force. As of Dec. 31 the companics had about 88,000 total employees. 
Alcatel said it agreed to buy Lucent to better combat the intense competi­tion in the telecom equipment market. 
"The primary driver of the combina­tion is to generate significant growth in revenues and earnings based on the market opportunities for next-genera­tion networks, services and applica­tions," the companies said. 
The combined company, whose name is to be decided at a later date, will be led by Patricia Russo, the cur­rent ehief executive of Lucent. the com­panies said in a joint stat11ment. Alcatel Chairman and CEO Serge Tchuruk will become non-executive chairman. 
The 14-member board of directors will include Russo, Tehuruk, five of the current directors from each company and two new independent European directors to be mutually agreed upon, the companies said.

NYC hosts tnarch for illegal aliens' rig-hts 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK -Thousands of immigrant rights supporters formed a line stretching more than a mile long Saturday as they marched across the Brooklyn Bridge, waving flags from more than a dozen countries as they demonstrated against possible immigration reform in Congress. 
Heralded by a cacophony of trumpets, whistles and drums,. the crowd of mostly Latin Americans gathered in down­town Brooklyn and trudged a path laden with symbols of the city's immigrant strength

"We came to say that we're here," said George Criollo, who arrived in New York a decade ago from Cuenca, Ecuador. "We have to speak, legal or illegal. We have to speak about this issue." 
Criollo, who said his family was in the United States illegally, feared that legislation could lead to his deportation or jailing. In the House, legislation already has passed that would set penalties for anyone who knowingly assists or encourages illegal immigrants 
to remain in the

On the way, they passed the Statue of Liberty, hot dog carts run by Middle Easterners, taxis driven by Russians and police officers speaking Chinese. 
More than 10,000 people flood­ed Foley Square, turning it into a sea of colorful banners and echo­ing noise. The crowd came dressed in the colors of Mexico, Uruguay and Ecuador, but just as many draped themselves in red, white and blue. 
"If you hurt immigrants you are hurting America," read a sign held by one marcher. Others read "We are your economy" and "I cleaned up ground zero." 
There were demonstrations across the country this week against legislation already approved in the House, which would make it a felony to be in the U.S. without the proper immi­gration paperwork.

The plan, which would be the first in the nation, still must be approved by federal officials. Hundreds of people marched peacefully in downtown Los Angeles to honor the late Cesar Chavez, co-founder of the United Farm Workers, who would have turned 79 on Friday. In Campo, about 40 miles from San Diego, more than 500 people gathered at Cesar Chavez Park to celebrate the civil rights leader. In Oklahoma City, more than 5,000 people jammed into the Capitol's south plaza to protest proposals in the Legislature designed to stop illegal immi­grants from receiving tax-sup­ported services, such as Medicaid and food stamps, and require state employees to report sus­pected illegal aliens. 
Car seats too s111all for obese kids 
More than a quarter million children in the U.S. exceed weight limit 
Associated Press . 
CHICAGO -Many young children are too heavy for standard car-safety seats, and manufacturers are start­ing to make heftier models to accommodate them, accord­ing to research on the obesity epidemic's widening impact. 
More than a quarter of a million U.S. children ages 1 to 6 are heavier than the weight limits for standard car seats, and most are 3-year-olds who weigh more than 40 pounds, the study found. 
Unless exceptionally tall, a 3-year-old weighing more than 40 pounds would gener­ally be considered over­weight. 
Lead author Lara Trifiletti said researchers at a safety center at Johns Hopkins Hospital became interested in the topic because they saw children "who were very obese and our car-seat tech­nicians were having a hard time finding car seats to fit them." 
She did the research at Johns Hopkins but now works at Ohio State University's Children's Research Institute. 
Using inadequate car seats for heavy children could put them at increased risk for injury in a car accident, the researchers said. 
"We don't recommend that 

a parent use a restraint sys­tem for a child that has out­grown that sys­tem," said Eric Bolton, a spokesman for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. "It is risky." 
Based on national growth charts and the 2000 Census, at least 283,305 chil­dren ages 1 to in 2001-02, government data show. New data out later this week are expected to show that the upward trend has continued. 
Jenny Riggs of Tillamook, Ore., said she had difficulty finding a harnessed seat for her almost-5-year-old daugh­ter, Hayley, who is heavier and taller than many kids her age -46 inches and 46 pounds and already weighed 40 pounds when 'she was 3. 
The $250 Britax "Husky" seat Riggs bought is about 10 pounds heavier and four 

· inches wider than standard harness-style seats. "It's like a Lazy-Boy reclin­er," Riggs said. "It was a little difficult getting it in the back seat but my daughter loves it." Hayley can use the seat for a while; it handles up to 80 pounds. Britax introduced two har­ness seats with 65-pound weight limits last year. The 
the researchers said. 

Their study appears in the April edition of Pediatrics, being released Monday. 
Trifiletti said the phenome­non mostly affects youngsters whose weight exceeds the

Eric Bolton spokesman National Highway Traffic Safety Administration 

limits of standard seats with built-in safety harnesses, which are designed for 1-to­3-year-olds weighing up to 40 pounds. These heavier young children are not mature enough or tall enough for "booster" safety seats, which are recommended for ages 4 and up and typically use the car's safety belts for restraints, she said. 
6 are too heavy for standard More than 23 percent of safety seats. That includes U.S. children aged 2 to 5 nearly 190,000, or almost 5 were overweight and more percent, of U.S. 3-year-olds, than 10 percent were obese obesity epidemic "is some­thing that we do keep in mind when designing our seats to make sure our seats are ver­satile in accommodating all sizes of children," said com­pany spokeswoman Joyce Kara. 
Dorel Juvenile Group, maker of Cosco brand car­seats, also introduced a har­ness seat last year for kids up to 65 pounds. 
Trifiletti said she did the study before last year's hefty models were introduced, when only four harness seats were available for 1-to-3­year-olds weighing more than 40 lbs. 
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration last year proposed new requirements for manufac­turers that choose to make seats for older and/or heavier children. Those who do would be required to build seats to protect kids up to 10 years old and/or weighing up to 80 pounds in 30 mph crashes. The agency also would create an 80-pound crash-test dummy for testing child safe­ty seats, 25 pounds heavier than the existing simulators, Bolton said.

There are countless things in this wide world that are better outside than in. Things like football, rain and skeet shooting. However, there is one thing that will always be superior when sur­rounded by !'our walls, and that is class. With spring in the air, our young minds ol'ten turn to things like throwing a Frisboe, hauling a couch outside for no real good reason and an overwhelming desire to have class in the Great Outdoors. I'm hnre to toll you now, please resist that urge, because when it comes to dasses, it's really the Subpar Outdoors. 
Just as the first robin and the first sleazy guy with an acoustie guitar on the quad signify the beginning ol' the spring season, so too you can prndict when winter has finally ended by listen­ing for students demanding to be taken outsido for dassos. Many times these requests arn met with resistance !'rom the professor. but it is entirely possib,le that your teacher may be complicit in this entire fiaseo. 
I know what you're thinking, "Look, Petn, even though you're awesome and all, I think having class outside is a jolly good old time." Well, I'm sorry, fellow student, but class outside is not a jolly good old time, and no amount of awe­someness on my part can change that. 
First ofl', the outdoors are full of bugs. Bumblebees, lire ants and giant cen­tipedes all populate this place where you desperately want to place your hind

end for an extended period of time. Sure, there are insects that you can find indoors, but they're things like house­flies and the occasional ant -nothing that you would someday lind injecting venom into your supple flesh. 
Another reason that classes stay inside is that blasted wind. When walk­ing across the quad, a nice breeze may feel invigorating and make you feel alive and ready to take on the world, but when you're trying to have a class, the wind just makes a gigantic mess of everything. How am I supposed to be able to take notes when the wind keeps blowing my graph paper out of my Trapper Keeper? I mean, why do you think that cavemen were called eave­men? They weren't called "Unable to Keep Papers in Trapper Keeper"~men, and that's because they kept it inside. Arc you sillier than a caveman? 
Another point on the growing list of reasons to keep it indoors is the lack of adequate seating in the wilderness. Unless you are a highly proactive Outdoor-Demander, chances are most of the good spots will have been taken by the time you manage to cajole your pro­fessor to allow a fun-filled lecture out­side. As such, you and your classmates will be forced to sit on the dirty, dirty ground. And you know what's all over that dirty, dirty ground? Dirt. And you know where that dirt ends up at the end of class'? On your butt. And you know who was the first person to sail directly from Europe to India? Vasco de Gama. I may not have learned a lot in my four years at Notre Dame, but I did learn that it's impossible to respect a man with dirt on his butt. Oh, and I learned that Vasco de Gama thing too. 
If my litany of reasons so far for keep­ing the learning under a ceiling is insuf­ficient, then think of the professors. These people devote their lives to the pursuit of academic exeP.Ilence in a desire to bettPr themsp,Jves and possibly mankind, and you're going to make them practice their well-honed craft outside'? You wouldn't ask Einstt~in to work out his equations outside, nor would you tell Miehelangelo to paint "The Creation of Adam" on a hedge of some sort. The faculty at Notrn Dame didn't devote their lives to the pursuit of knowledge just so that one day they would have to compete with grass for your attention. 
I know many of you think I'm nuts, but think about it: when is the last time you had a great time in an outdoor dass? Being outside for dass never ends with things like jumping in a Big Bouncy or playing frenzll tag. It always ends with a sore back, a Trapper Keeper sans some essential papers, and dirt on your butt. The outdoors an~ a seductive mistn~ss, making you lust allnr warm sunshine and Ultimate Frisbee -but stay strong, because that mistress will end up two-timing you with wind, lire ants and so much dirt. She can't be trustPd, so keep dass inside as the Good Lord inbmded.

are compelled to communicate the false message that they support the 
''don't ask, don't tell" policy and their hosting also subsidizes the military's 
expression of its view that openly gay persons are not suited for service. 
We are not concerned here with questions of constitutionality. Instead, we must ask whether the Solomon Amendment will harm or further the interests of liberal arts institutions such as Princeton University. 
While we grant that the "don't ask, don't tell" policy is discriminatory and hinders the opportunity of open homo­sexuals from pursuing a career in the military, it is also true that by banning military recruitment and HOTC pro­grams from campuses the faculties limit students' opportunities as well. This is especially true with regards to the HOTC. Many students rely upon H.OTC scholarships as their only means to fund a private university education. We are forced to judge between the evils of two forms of dis­crimination -the army's unwilling­ness to allow openly gay individuals within its ranks versus depriving qual-

Furthermore, it is within the rights of both faculty and students to criti­cize and condemn legal poliey but not to censor. A basic principle of the open society is free and fair discussion. But the prohibition of recruitment on cam­pus demeans this principle by limiting discourse on this controversial issue. Tho ideological field should be a bat­tlefield. Professors and students who seek to banish military recruitment on college campusns have cravenly retreated from this linld. Thn preven­tion of legally mandatnd military recruiters does a disservice both to the students and the mandate of a uni­versity that avows to practice and defend free intellectual discourse.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
ROTC contract leaves no rootn for reinterpretation 
In response to William Sullivan's March 31letter ("Military contract not ambigu­ous"), I would like to clarify some facts surrounding the matter of Jonathan O'Reilly. Note that the opinions here are my own and do not represent those of any government organization. 
The title given Sullivan's letter by The Observer is a very fitting one for a rebut­tal. Nothing in the clause quoted by Sullivan, "I will well and faithfully dis­charge the duties of the office upon which I am about to enter," implies an indefinite term of service. ROTC cadets sign an Enlistment Contract (DO Form 411 and 4/2), a ROTC Scholarship Cadet Contract (DA Form 597 -3), and ultimately an Oath of Office Military Personnel (DA Form 71). The term of service in DO Form 4/1 and 4/2 is stated clearly in Section B, Line 8. My own contract states "8 years." I don't know what O'Reilly's contract says, but I'd bet my next paycheck it doesn't say any­thing akin to "indefmite." Nowhere in any of these documents is there any provision for the length of service to be involuntarily increased; it is noted only that an officer serving in the guard or reserves may be involuntarily called to active duty. As Sullivan rightly notes, officers and soldiers must obey the lawful orders of the Commander-in-Chief (and all other offi­cers appointed above them) while they serve under the contract, but it is incoher­ent to assert that the President could uni­laterally extend the contract under which he has the right to have his orders respected in the first place. If a person's right to have his orders respected depends on the contract existing first, the terms of the contract itself cannot be subject to that person's will. 
Furthermore, there is no clause in the United States Constitution which grants to the President or any other official the priv­ilege to involuntarily extend the agreed service of anyone, military or no, and the 13th Amendment can be reasonably con­strued specifically to prohibit this. This is not to equate involuntary servitude with slavery. It is clear from the text that the 13th Amendment does not necessarily consider the two synonymous, yet they are both equally proscribed. The authors of this Amendment were wise to invoke a more general principle in order to prohibit involuntary service at large, and not only traditional slavery. This cer­tainly applies to the present case. 
The ROTC contract does

For one party to attempt to alter the contract uni­laterally to increase the obligations of the other party is simply an invalid act. The military does, in fact, often attempt to keep personnel in service beyond their legal commitment and against their will. The fact that such attempts are often effi­cacious does not bear at all on the fact that they are always illegitimate. These are wrongs unfortunately sometimes suf­fered. The warnings Sullivan has received

ed. For if one enters into a contract with indefmite obli­gations, how could one ever be determined to have fulfilled the obliga­tions of the contract? The obligations could never be said to have been fulfilled even by the admission of the other party, because at a later date the other party could change its mind and reinvoke the contract. The aggrieved party would have no textual recourse to protest even in the face of a prior admission by the other party. Such a contract would attempt to give one party the right to determine uni­laterally when the contract had been ful­filled, and by doing this it would lose the nature of a contract, i.e., it would be no contract at all. But the ROTC contract is a valid contract that does not attempt this usurpation. It lists clear, defmite obliga­tions for both parties. The student agrees to a certain term of service, and the gov­ernment agrees to pay a certain amount ed is here in conflict with 
the citizen officer's right to 
have the contract respect­ed, and this seems to be the core of O'Reilly's case. O'Reilly has served his agreed term of service. Cadet Sullivan's bare assertion that "one of the obligations is to serve as long as one's services are deemed necessary, not by the individual, but by the organization" is an opinion totally without legal, logical or moral sup­port. His statement that "It is not anyone else's responsibility to make sure the offi­cer candidate understands his or her obli­gation to fulfill that office" completely ignores the fact that O'Reilly knows exact­ly what his contract says. It is the govern­ment that does not "understand" the obli­gations in this case -in reality, it likely understands the obligations perfectly, but chooses not to honor them. Sullivan's def­erence to the government in fulfilling his duties as an officer is to be commended, but his deference to the government in a broader context of respecting rights is cer­tainly not in the spirit of maintaining the protections fought for and ultimately codi-. fied for us by the founders of this nation. 

Sullivan ends with the self-contradictory statement that " ... I am not arguing that O'Reilly does not have a legitimate claim to be released from his oath, but his letter shows gross ignorance toward the actual commitment officers are expected to make ... " If Sullivan himself recognizes O'Reilly's claim as legitimate, how can he then simultaneously believe that O'Reilly is "ignorant" of what his commitment does and does not require? The only assumption that makes this statement internally coherent is if Sullivan takes for granted that citizens are morally required to forsake all broader principles of free­dom in order to subject themselves blindly to the temporal will of the government, • even outside of the context of obeying law­ful orders under their oaths. This is an untenable moral position for a people who wish to remain free. Honoring personal freedom according to the principles and text in the Constitution and other written laws above the temporal desires or "needs" of the stewards of government is the crux of what it means to have a Republic as opposed to some other more sinister form of government. Ten years ago, I might have agreed with Sullivan. After several deployments and years of service, I hope Sullivan will eventually gain a more mature, balanced, and com­prehensive understanding of what patriot­ism and rights entail in our Republic, as I have.

Puzzles not to be overlooked 
Unacceptable. At hand here is a problem greater than the possibility of Greek life at Notre Dame or the derogatory label of "Irish" to our football team. I'm talking, of course, about the daily crossword puzzle and jumble experience. 
Two days in a row now we've had the same cross­word. And this is no isolated incident. Back in January, a similar travesty occurred. Not that it's not fun flying through an answered puzzle, thinking I'm the next Einstein, but where's the challenge? The thrill? Suddenly the Monday-through-Friday spec­trum of difficulty is thrown askew, leaving our dear readers gasping in shock. 
And if rampant reprinting wasn't bad enough for my strained soul, there's the failure to print the crosswords and jumbles in the right chronological order. Puzzles always contain the answers to yester­day's trials, helping us hone our wordsmithing skills. While a pesky word may have bested me Wednesday, I'll rest easy Thursday night knowing that "TTKACA" was actually "ATTACK." Failing to mainta_in the proper order is like not revealing "rosebud" in "Citizen Kane" or cutting out the final scene of "Sixth Sense" -we all are left wondering and a little less complete. 
These are arguably the most-read section of this fair news journal, and the failures of the editorial staff can disrupt literally thousands of students' lives. Whether one chooses to race with friends to that fmal jumbled phrase or prefer to stretch the crossword out to a full 50 or 75 minutes of classtime, puzzle mistakes affect us all and cast a dark cloud over an entire day. I urge the editors to put down the dozens of pointless viewpoints about petty matters and spend more time carefully laying out the gem of the Observer crown, before I might actually have to start paying attention in lectures.

Knights of Columbus no mystery 
So here's the word on the most mysterious building on campus (after the radiation lab, that is): That love­ly, columned building conveniently located at the junc­ture of God Quad and South Quad is the home base for the Knights of Columbus Notre Dame Council No. 1477. The Notre Dame KofC has been serving the University since 1910 and has organized hundreds of Catholic men to serve Notre Dame and the wider com­munity. We are probably best known for our steak sandwiches, which we sell every home football game right out front of our building. Each year, the Knights raise in the neighborhood of $50,000 with the steak sales, and every bit of it is distributed to charities near and far. We have supported the Gibault School for Troubled Youth for decades, and we have also con­tributed to Right to Life, Holy Cross Missions, Big Brothers and Big Sisters and dozens of other worthy causes throughout the years. We helped to found the Bengal Bouts, and legend has it that we coined the slogan "God, Country, Notre Dame." As a Catholic men's fraternal organization, we are dedicated to . upholding and promoting the mission of the Church. We are always looking for new members and would love to talk with any men who would like to join us in this mission. Anyone who has any questions or would just like a tour of our building should feel free to stop by before the Blue and Gold game for a steak sand­wich, or email me at jwaugh@nd.edu.

SHOW REVIEWS 
La Alianza's Latinacion highlights Latin culture 
By TAE ANDREWS 
Assistant Scene Editor 
Bailamos! On Friday night, University student organization La Alianza held Latinacion, its annual Latin Expressions cultural show. Held at the O'Laughlin Auditorium. at Saint Mary's, the show was the 16th performance of the event celebrating traditional and current Latin-American culture. 
After an opening act featuring both bomba and salsa-style dancing, the show continued with Rock LatinoAmericano, performed by Tiara Torres y Mauricio Ormachea. 
Dance performances were such a prevalent staple of the show that many in attendance might have wondered if the Notre Dame students involved should have changed their collective moniker to' the 
Following the dance act, the Julian Zamora Scholarship Award, given to a faculty member who played a substan­tial role in the Latino community on campus, was given to Father Daniel Groody, theology professor and director of the Institute for Latino Studies. He graciously accepted the honor and humorously suggested that, should the percentage of Notre Dame students of Latin descent continue to rise, the school's moniker might one day become the "Fighting Latinos" in addition to the Fighting Irish. 
The end of the first act saw "EI Cascabel," a traditional mariachi musi­cal performance by the eponymous music gro"up Mariachi NO. 
After a brief intermission, Latinacion picked up right wh~re it left off with another talented performance by Mariachi ND. Following this, the Julian Zamora

The performance lived up to show's billing as Latinacion, when a host of other Latin-American Notre Dame stu­dents joined Moo at the conclusion of the poem in a gesture of solidarity for their Latin brethren. 
Las Encantadoras continued the evening's festivities with "Fuera de Liga," followed by "Alabanzas," a per­formance by Coro Primavera de Nuestra Senora. Act One was rounded out by "Danza de los Concheros," a perform­ance by Ballet Folklorico Azul y Oro.

Latinacion then followed with "Sweat," a performance featuring bowler hats, suspenders and canes worn by the First Class Lady Steppers. 
After "Mi Reflejo," a song performed by Francesca Jiminez, "An Irish Tail" was performed by the Notre Dame and Saint Mary's Irish Dance team. In keep­ing with the evening's theme, the group performed its traditional Irish jig with a twist -instead of the more traditional Irish music jig/step music, the troupe performed to a thumping reggaeton beat. 
The evening also showcased the vocal talents of Yadira Huerta, who, in addi­tion to singing, coordinated the event with Sabrina Placeres. 
The second act of the show featured the first-ever Mr. and Mrs. Reggaeton NO competition, in which contestants vied fiercely for the titles of "papi chulo" and "mami chula" to raucous applause from the audience. The competition test­ed the competitors' knowledge of reg­gaeton artists, ability to speak rapid-fire Spanish, and, of course, ability to put-it in reverse and back it up on the dance floor. In the end, Chris Lied! and Emma Pineda were the ones left standing after the smoke cleared, and they won the inaugural title. 
Throughout the evening, the show was seasoned by the comedic antics of the show's emcee triple team -Rosa Lopez, Dmitri Martinez and Michelle Mas. At one point, the three staged a skit in which they held mock auditions for the show. The three-headed monster acting as Master of Ceremonies rotated

between playing colorful would-be Latin Expressions hopefuls and giving out brutally honest "constructive criticism" worthy of talent judge Simon Cowell on the television program American Idol. 
After "Tango y Paso Doble," per­formed by Pasion Ardiente, the show concluded with a Shakira mix for its closing act. 
"Latin Expressions is a wonderful glimpse into the beauty that Latin American cultures have to offer," said Vanessa Quezada, La Alianza vice presi­dent. "For the Latino students specifical­ly, it gives us great pride to share with the rest of the Notre Dame family the richness of these countries which we call home. It is an embracing event, not just for the Latinos of Notre Dame, but for all students who understand the true value of one's roots."

BCAC Fashion Show more than just models, clothes 
By CASSIE BELEK 
Scene Writer 
Hopscotch, football, cheating lovers and weddings aren't something one usually expects from a fashion show, but the BCAC proved this stereotype wrong. Saturday's BCAC Fashion Show was more than just strutting around in high heels -it was a high-energy dis­play of this season's best fashions pre­sented with music, choreography and a background story. 
The production took place at the South Bend Century Center, and it marked the Black Cultural Arts Council's 28th year putting on the fash­ion show. The BCAC, along with back­ing from clothing sponsors such as Buckle, Charlotte Russe, DEB, Fashion 
Bug,  Noelle's  and  the  Hammes  
Bookstore,  all  contributed  to  the  
show's success.  
The  emcees  of  the  evening  - 

Lawrence Denson, Anne Marie Desir, and Justin Gray-guided the audience through the journey of a young woman named Kodi (Ukachi Okoronkwo) as she transitions from childhood in an all-black community to life under the of a home game, from the cheers to the Dome. marshmallow fight to Officer Tim

energy of the segments and matched the music perfect­ly., The models themselves never missed a beat as they strutted and danced all over the stage. 
Highlights included "Jammin' for Jesus," "First Football Game" and "Freshman Puppy Love." In "Jammin' for Jesus" the models wore clothes by Noelle's and Fashion Bug as they re­enacted Sunday church at home filled with gospel music and witnesses. 
In "First Football Game," the models were dressed in Hammes Bookstore apparel and portrayed the excitement If anyone could be said 
to have stolen the show, it's the emcees who introduced each segment with their own bits. Denson and Gray weren't afraid to dress in drag or as Chippendale's dancers, and Desir tested the limits of her vocal cords before "Midterms: Library Time." 
The trio remembered the fond days of third grade crushes and dancing "The Electric Slide" at family barbe­cues, even going so far as to pull mem­bers of the audience to dance with them. They also proved their improvi­sational skills when they were asked to kill time for clothing changes. 

The most humorous moment of the evening came when the three warned Spring Visitation prospects in the audi­ence of the danger of facebook.com pictures and then proceeded to display their favorites of Notre Dame students with faces whited-out, followed by demands for the people in the embar­rassing pictures to show themselves. 
The show culminated in "Ring by Spring," in which two of the characters got married, giving the models a chance to show off suits as well as for­mal and semi-formal gowns. This finale also allowed them to tie up the story's loose ends. 
Despite a late start and long wardrobe changes, the BCAC Fashion Show was a unique and entertaining show that engaged the audience, told a story and displayed the hottest fash­ions of the seasons. The models were clearly having as much fun as the audi­ence, and they brought that to the stage while they showed off what's hot and what's not.

Pre-gatne ceretnony fires up Sox fans .. 
Associated Press 
CHICAGO-Fans cheered as soon as the White Sox emerged from the dugout to warm up Sunday night. 
Ready to celebrate? You bet, especially after a five­month wait. 
Their roar only got louder during a colorful ceremony before the major league opener against Cleveland, a celebration of Chicago's first World Series winner in 88 years. 
When the final out of the Game 4 clincher in Houston was replayed on the large center-field scoreboard at the end of a video retrospec­tive, four championship ban­ners hanging beneath out­field light poles were uncov­ered. As fans sheered, fire­works went off behind the left-center field fence. 

One banner saluted the White Sox World Series championships in 1906 and 1917, another was for last year's winner, a third hailed the team's AL champions and the fourth marked its division winners. After the fireworks, another video tribute followed, accompa­nied by Queen's "We Are The Champions." 
"It was awesome. This is really exciting," fan Pat Valiska of suburban Highland Park said. "We've waited a long time for this." 
The ceremony also fea­tured the unfurling of an American flag as big as the outfield during the playing of "The Star-Spangled Banner" and then a knee­knocking flyover by two jets: 
"It was nice and impres­sive," said Frank Lakis, another fan who later had to sit through a fourth-inning rain.delay. "The jets came a little close to the lights." 
Chicago clinched all three of its playoff series on the road last season. And despite a wild parade through the streets of the city, Sunday night presented the first chance for the White Sox and their follow­ers to celebrate in their own ballpark. 
"This is kind of a circus atmosphere out here," White Sox catcher A.J. Pierzynski said before the game. "We just want to get to where we can focus on baseball." 
Repeating will be tough. The last team to win consec­utive titles was the 1998­2000 New York Yankees 

After beating the New York Giants in the 1917 World Series, the White Sox went 57-67 the next season, good for sixth place. In 1960, one season after los­ing the World Series to the Dodgers, Chicago took third ­in the AL with an 87-67 record. 
"I hope I don't have to wait 88 years again," White Sox manager Ozzie Guillen said. 
IN BRIEF 

Giants' Lowry siJ!ns four­
year, $9.25 million ileal 

SAN FRANCISCO -Noah Lowry received quite the affirmation about his status in San Francisco's rotation, signing a four-year contract Sunday that guarantees the pitcher at least $9.25 million. 
The 25-year-old Lowry, the Giants' No. 3 starter heading into Monday's season opener at San Diego, is under contract through the 2009 season and the Giants have a club option for 2010. 
"It definitely means security," Lowry said. "For me, money isn't the issue. Baseball is game that I love to play. I love to go out and compete .... This is something I worked my whole life for." 
The left-hander gets a $1 million signing bonus. He was already set to make $385,000 this season and will earn $1.115 million in 2007, $2.25 million in '08 and $4.5 million in '08. The Giants have a $6.25 million option that could reach $7.7 5 million with escalators. Marlins owner contemplates 
move to San Antonio 

HOUSTON -Florida Marlins owner Jeffrey Loria said Sunday that discussions with San Antonio officials about the possibility of relocating the team there are serious. 
San Antonio has been trying to lure the team and county officials have offered to put up $200 million toward an estimated $300 million ballpark if voters approve extending a tax on hotel and car rentals. 
The Marlins slashed their payroll to about $15 million in the offseason because of poor attendance and no progress in Loria's bid for a baseball­specific stadium. Florida plays at Dolphins Stadium, home of Miami's NFL team. 
"We're still looking at all our options, but our talks in San Antonio are seri-ous," Loria said 'on Sunday at Minute Maid Park before addressing 
-
his team. 
Loria said several officials from San An'tonio would join him on Monday when the Marlins open the season against the Houston Astros. 
''I've invited them to join us to learn more about San Antonio," he said. Brewers sign reliever 
'Turnbow to tliree-year deal 
MILWAUKEE -Closer Derrick Turnbow and the Milwaukee Brewers agreed Sunday to a $6.5 million, three-year contract, replacing $488,000, one-year deal he signed in February. 
The 28-year-old righty tied the Brewers season saves record last year with 39, a mark Dan Kolb set in 2004. The 39 saves ranked fifth in the NL last season, when Turnbow was 7-1 with a 1.74 ERA 
He struck out a career-high 64 bat­ters in 6 7 1-3 innings. 
Turnbow gets $1 million this year, $2.3 million in 2007 and $3.2 million in 2008.

Clutch free throw shooting from Davis beats Golden State, gives Minnesota first overtime victory this season 
Associated Press

lie scored 35 points against reigning MVP Steve Nash and his :~-pointer with 3:40 left put tlw Pistons ahead in a 109-102 win over Phoenix on Sunday. 
"I think I made a good ease," Billups said. "It would mean a lot. Not as much as another championship. but it means a lot to even be mentioned." 
In a rnatchup of MVP candi­dates, Billups was sensational while Nash struggled, shooting 4-of-11 for 13 points. 
"Chauncey was amazing," Nash said. The Pistons (59-14) clinched the best record ahead of Miami. 
"This is the third of our five steps, but this one might be the most important of the first four, because of the 2-2-1-1-1 format in the conffHence finals," Detroit coach Flip Saunders said. 
The first two goals were to make the playoffs and win the division, and the last two are to elineh the best record in the league and win a second title in three years. 
Detroit expects to be without Hasheed Wallace on Tuesday at horne against the Hornets. Wallace is subject to a one­game suspension for picking up his 16th technical foul. 
"I don't care about No. 16," ()'Antoni said. 

The Suns played well for two­plus quarters without a usual game from Nash because Boris Diaw (16), Raja Bell (12) and reserve Leandro Barbosa (1 0) carried the scoring load. , Billups wasn't a one-man team. 
Tayshaun Prince had 23 points and eight rebounds, Hasheed Wallace had 15 points and 11 rebounds, Richard Hamilton had 12 points and seven assists and Ben Wallace had 11 rebounds along with a double-digit scoring game. 
Minnesota 106

The Minnesota Tirnberwolves have struggled all season long to win dose games. 
Sunday was an exception. 
Hicky Davis m.ade three free throws in the final 12 seconds of overtime and the Minnesota Tirnberwolves hung on to beat the Golden State Warriors. 
Minnesota, which won for the first time in five overtime games, is now 2-9 in one pos­session games. The other win was Feb. 6 at Phoenix when Kevin Garnett scored with 31.9 seconds remaining and blocked Shawn Marion at the buzzer. 
"This means we're growing," said Marcus Banks who scored 24 points to lead Minnesota, which had all five starters score in double figures. "A couple of games ago we couldn't do any­thing as far as closing out a game. Now we're starting to put this thing together and looking forward to the future."

Billups put the Suns away with a 3-pointnr from about 30 rent just before the shot clock expired, which Nash said won tho game, and a go-ahead 3­pointor on the next possession, giving Detroit a 100-98 lead that it didn't relinquish. 
"It's not like wn were making a lot of mistakes on him, he was just making shots that were incredible," Nash said. 
When Billups was shooting free throws in tho final minute, tho crowd chanted: "MVP! MVI'!" 
In Dntroit's previous game, Milwaukne led 15-0 and had an 18-point lead in the third quar­ter bnforn the Pistons rallind. 
"That's probably why thny'vn b1~1m to the Finals tlw past two years," PIHH~nix coach Mike

the last three by a combined six points. Fisher cut Minnesota's lead to 103-102 on a driving layup with 
12.5 seconds remaining, before Davis made two foul shots with 12 seconds left. Fisher then made two free throws with 7.8 seconds to play to close the gap to 105-104. Davis added anoth­er free throw beforf,l Richardson missed an open 26-footer at the buzzer. It was the third straight game he missed a shot late that would have tied or won the game 
Friday against Sacramento he wildly missed a 3-pointer before the buzzer and the Kings won by three. Wednesday against New Orleans/Oklahoma City his shot with 7. 7 seconds left was blocked by Hasual Butler, and the Hornets won 86-85. 
"I didn't realize how far from the basket I was when I got the ball." he said. "I ~as surprised I got that wide open." 
Minnesota coach Dwane Casey said Justin Heed was sup­posed to be guarding Hkhardson. but got blocked on a sermm. 
Hichardson had a play designed for him to win the game at the end of regulation. 
lie found himself matched one-on-one against Garnett 
near midcourt. With 5 seconds to go, Hichardson drove the lane before kicking the ball to Fisher, who missed a 3-pointer. 
"I thought was a great chance to get a gr!)at shot at the foul line," said Warriors coach Mike Montgomery. 
Fisher's attempt was one of a season-high 39 Golden State had from beyond the arc. 
Dallas 103, Denver 79 
Mavericks coach Avery Johnson was a little happier with his team's defensive effort. 
Dirk Nowitzki had 30 points and 12 rebounds to help the Mavericks snap a season-long three-game losing streak with a victory over the Denver Nuggets on Sunday. 
Jason Terry scored 21 points and Josh Howard added 20 for the Mavericks, who had lost five of their previous seven and experienced the first three­game skid under Johnson. The Mavericks had been competing with Detroit and San Antonio for the NBA's best record before falling off the pace. 
Johnson gave his team an angry dressing down for lax defense following Friday night's loss at Orlando. Johnson was displeased with his team's defense in all of the three con­secutive road defeats to Detroit, Cleveland and Orlando. 
"We thought we were pretty good defensively, for the most part, against one of the tougher teams in the Western Conference," Johnson said. "We knew we had to be physical."

SMC TENNIS 
After strong start, Belles break even 
By GREG ARBOGAST 
Sports Writer 
While Saint Mary's appeared unbeatable Friday, defeating Olivet Nazarene 8-1, the team looked anything but as it lost 9-0 to No. 13 Wheaton Saturday in the Jack Schwarz Memorial Classic Tournament in Wheaton, 
Ill. 
The Belles started the weekend by defeating a talented Olivet Nazarene team with ease. The squad swept the doubles matches with the teams of Caile Mulcahy and Kelly McDavitt, Grace Gordon and Kristen Palombo and Melissa Dingler and Mary Elizabeth Campbell, all picking up wins by the score of 8-6. 
In singles action, Saint Mary's proceeded to win five of the six match-ups. Only No. 2. Mulcahy failed to defeat her opponent as she lost to Olivet's Jennifer Hamsey by a score of 1-6, 6-1, 6­
1. No. 1 Palombo needed three sets to beat Olivet's Lily Gonzalez, but McDavitt, Campbell, Dingler and Gordon only required two sets to dispatch their opponents. 
But similar success was not found against Wheaton Saturday. The Belles failed to win a match, although McDavitt put up quite a light as Wheaton's Karly Olsen needed extra games in the third set to pick up the win by a score of6-4, 6-7 {4-7), 11-9. 
The rest of the matches were not as competitive. Every other singles match went only two sets, with no Saint Mary's player man­aging to win more than two games in any set.

In doubles, the No. 1 team of Mulcahy and McDavitt lost 8-1, the No. 2 team of Palombo and Gordon was defeated 8-3 and the No. 3 team of Campbell and Dingler lost 8-2. 
There were several reasons for the sizable gap between the out­comes of the matches, senior Palombo said. 
"Part of it was that we didn't play as well against Wheaton, but part of it was that Wheaton was just a much better team," Palombo said. "We could have won more games against Wheaton, but they're a very solid team all around." 
The weekend gives the Belles an overall record of 7-6 and 2-1 in the MIAA. Saint Mary's will now turn its focus on this week's conference matches. Despite the results against Wheaton, Palombo said the team will go into this week's matches with a worthwhile experience from this weekend's tournament. 
"We feel positive because Friday's match was so good," Palombo said. "We played well Saturday, but sometimes you just come across opponents who are better than you. We were happy with our results and efforts." 
Saint Mary's will play its next match Monday against Alma, a team that comes into the meeting with a record of 2-5 overall and 1-2 in MIAA. The Belles will look to pick up their third conference win after suffering their first con­ference loss last week to Hope by a score of 6-3.

No dancing for Heels this year 
Terrapins top UNC to reach first-ever national championship game 
Associated Press 

BOSTON -Maryland is play­
ing for its first national champi­
onship, and these Terrapins are 
no fluke. 

The only team to beat top­
ranked North Carolina in the 
regular season did it again 
Sunday night, outhustling and 
outmuscling the disjointed Tar 
Heels 81-70 in the NCAA 
women's national semifinal. 
In just four short years under 
coach Brenda Frese, the Terps 
have joined the nation's eliie. 
"They have the heart of a 
lion," Frese said. ''They believe 
in each other ... I'm really proud 
of them." 

The Terps confounded the Tar 
Heels' uptempo game, forcing 
them in to a halfcourt match for 
much of the game. 
Crystal Langhorne and Laura 
Harper asserted their strong 
inside presence -and the 
sophomores intend to be 
around for a while. Harper had 
24 points and Langhorne scored 
23 for the Terps, who had beat­
en the Tar Heels, their Atlantic 
Coast Conference rival, 98-95 in 
overtime in the regular season. 
Carolina avenged that with a 
91-80 in the ACC tournament, 
but the stakes were much high­
er for this rubber match. 
Erlana Larkins led the Tar 
Heels with 28 points and 10 
rebounds. Ivory Latta, 
Carolina's feisty point guard, 
was banged up, knocked down 
and carried off the court at one 
point. 

Though she returned, she 
never quite got on track, finish­
ing with 14 points, four assists 
and made just one of 10 3­pointers. The Terps will play the win­ner of the Duke-LSU semifinal. 
Maryland ran its halfcourt came to near perfection, getting the ball into Langhorne or Harper for basket after basket. The Terps outscored North Carolina 50-38 in the paint and finished with a 41-31 edge on the boards. 
Maryland was making its first Final Four appearance since 1989 but had the swagger of a team that's been here before. The Terps led by just two at the half, then began to methodically add to the lead. 
Kristi Tolliver's 3-pointer with 8 minutes left gave the Terrapins their largest lead at 63-52. As the ball dropped through, Tolliver nodded toward the Maryland fan section and coolly gestured "bring it on." 
For a while, it did seem Maryland was ready to run away with it. But Latta and the Heels had one more run left: North Carolina chipped away with a 11-4 run and Latta's two free throws with 1 :06 left got the Heels within 3 at 73-70. 
But there was no panic in 

~ou rre im'itul to a gatlierilliJ to mar(. tlie refeast of tlie JO'l}(j{,"\)1£ O<'F 'i}~(l>'E~qJVl'l>V.>J']tE ~<.ES'E.Sf.~

these Terps. Shay Doron played cat-and-mouse with Latta as she brought the ball upcourt, then dished to a wide-open Coleman for a layup. The Heels would get no closer. 
Doron said the game plan was to keep Latta "in front us all the time, make sure we contested every one of her shots and try to keep the ball out of her hand." 
Latta fouled out with . 7 sec­onds remaining when she wres­tled Coleman to the ground. She walked off to and watched qui­etly as the Terps celebrated on the sidelines. 
Most of the first half was marked by missed opportunities for the Tar Heels. Carolina hit just one of its first six free throw attempts and failed to capitalize on early turnovers. 
Things were even worse from 3-point range, where the Tar Heels one of 11 attempts. 
The Terps, meanwhile, went inside early and often to Langhorne and the big sopho­more did not disappoint. She was 7 -of-8 from the floor, most­ly from inside the paint, and had 16 points in the first half to give the Terps a 36-34 lead at the break.

Notre Dame takes 11 events in outdoor ho:m_e opener 
Despite bad weather, several athletes record personal best times 
By FRAN TOLAN Sports Writer 
The Irish hosted the Notre Dame Outdoor Opener at Moose Krause Stadium Saturday and recorded victo­ries in 11 events. 
Facing a field that included athletes from DePaul, Loyola Chicago, Central Michigan, Hillsdale College and Detroit Mercy College, the squad had to contend with poor weather conditions after previously competing in meets in California and Arizona. 
That weather significantly impacted the athletes-the Irish failed to produce any NCAA qualifying marks. 
"After the [Cal Poly Invitational]. it was pretty frustrating to have to deal 
with the 45-degree tempera­ture," said Austin Wechter, who won the men's 400-meter dash with a time of 49.52 sec­onds. 
Despite the sub-par condi­tions, some of the Irish ath­letes did produce outstanding performances. Shot-putter Mike Schubert won the men's competition with a throw of 
15.76 meters, the longest toss of his career. Schubert bet­tered his previous career-best by almost a full meter and won the event by nearly two meters. The runner-up, Adam Mayhew of Detroit Mercy College, posted a toss of 13.96 meters. 
Sophomore sprinter Domenique Manning also topped her previous career­best mark as she won the women's 100-meter hurdles with a time of 14.23 seconds. 
"I thought the weather was really going to impair my run­ning," Manning said. "I felt really good at the start of the race, though, and I just tried to run to the best of my ability in the conditions that we were in. 
"When I heard my time over the intercom, I was shocked." 
Other Notre Dame event winners included Laura Huarte in the javelin, Matt Plaska in the 800 meters, Mike Popejoy in the 5,000 meters, Nicole Yergler in the 400­meter hurdles, Garet Koxlien in the discus, Kate Mattoon in the pole vault and the women's 4x400-meter relay team. 
While no Irish athletes recorded NCAA qualifying fig­ures, many did improve upon their qualifying marks for the Big East Outdoor Championships. 
Notre Dame will send ath­letes to compete at the Miami (Ohio) Invitational in Oxford, Ohio next weekend. 
"Hopefully the weather will be a lot better for us [at Miami]," Manning said.

Team sweeps two doubleheaders over weekend 
By DAN MURPHY and JAY FITZPATRICK Spons Writers 
Notre Damn began Big East play Saturday by showing how dominant it can be on offense or defense, sweeping a double­header against Connecticut with a CJ-0 blowout and a 2-1 no-hitter. 
For the Irish, everything senmed to go their way in game one, nspeeially on ofTensn. Notre Dame lit up the Huskins' starting pitcher, Krista Mieakzyk. for nine runs on 11 hits in only thnw-and-one-third innings of work. Each of the rirst 11vn hittnrs scored in the lirst inning on Mkalczyk. 
Irish head coach Dnanna (;umpf said it was her team's ability to gnt ahead early that 
rnally  sparked  the  Irish  
ofTnnse.  
"Wn got into a  really good  

hitting rhythm," Gumpf said. "Thn fact that wn jumped out narly nmlly hnlpt~d us win." 
Although tlw Huskies quinted down the Irish bats in the sec­ond -allowing no runs and onn hit -Notre Damn refused to hn stoppnd, scoring two insurance runs in nach of the third and fourth innings. 
The top of thn Irish lineup co n t i n u n d to lw I p s t a r t t h n ofTnnse as it has all year. as the set:ond and third hitters-een­ter fielder i\lexnndra KotchnfT and Mallorie LPnn, respectively -each scored two runs while Kotelwf'f rnadwd safely in all throe of her at-bats. 
Second basmnan Katie Laing, batting fif'th for the Irish, also had a huge day at the plate, driving in three runs on a dou­ble and a triple. 
But it was not just the Irish lineup that beat the Huskies, but also the work of the pitch­ers -starter Heather Booth and reliever Kenya Fuernrneler -who combined for a five­inning shutout bt)fore the game was ealled due to the eight-run slaughter rule. 
Booth came out strong by striking out five in her four innings of work. tier perform­ance was especially impressive having just come off an 11­inning complete game against Bowling Green. 
"Heather did a great job com­ing in fresh and ready to go," Lnnn said. "She knew that she had to bn ready for this game, and she didn't let the othnr g1~~ne [agains~ Bowling, Green I afln1:t her performance. 
While the first game for the Irish proved their ability to hit wnll against Big East pitching, the socond game showed Notre Dame's potential dominance over Big East hitting wilh Brittney Bargar's eight-inning no-hitter. 
Bargar pitchnd well against the Huskies in the second game, something the Irish noedod as their bats were no longer dominant against the new Huskies piteher, Michelle Caouette. Bargar was perfeet through four-and-one-third innings, induding four strike­outs at that point. when an orror by third baseman Meagan Huthraul'f' allowed the first Husky runner of the game to reaeh base. Bargar did not let this faze her and moved on through the next two innings with no trouble. But going into the top of the 

sixth, staked to a tenuous one­run lead for the Irish ofT of a Stephanie Brown homerun in the third, Bargar began to have some serious trouble with her eontrol. 
An error by shortstop Sara Schoonaert allowed the leadotT runner on first. while a hit batsman and walk loaded the bases with no outs. Bargar buckled down, getting two outs, but then plunked the next hitter in the back to allow the only run of the game for the Huskies. 
"I was really frustrated with Bargar's control issues," Gumpf said of her freshman starter. "She is such a great pinpoint pitcher that she didn't have to hit those batters. They were crowding the plate, but she has to learn to avoid hitting peo­ple." 
Bargar's error sent the game into extra innings, where she reassertnd hor control and her dominance by finishing ofT the no-hitter after a Huthrauff sae­rif'ice fly scored right fielder Stephanie Mota for a 2-1 Irish win. 
For Bargar, this game markod the biggest win of her short Notre Dame career as well as the second no-hitter she eontributed to this week, the other being a combined no­hitter against Western Michigan with Fuemmeler March 26. 
"It feels good to have done this," Bargar said, "But the defense played very well too. There's no way I could have done it without them." 
Notre Dame eame into this game with a sense of purpose -to assert themselves as the dominant team in the Big East. 
"If we play well we can beat anybody, and if we don't any­body ean beat us," Gurnpf said. "We have to come out on fire, and we did that today." 
The Irish continued their suc­cessful start on Sunday against Providence, winning both games in convincing fashion. 
Notre Dame was able to jump out to an early lead, thanks to the consistent production in the top half of the batting order. The team went ahead 3-0 in the third inning when the one through four hitters strung together two doubles and two singles resulting in two runs and runners on second and third. Second baseman Katie Laing dropped a sacrifice bunt to scratch across the third run of the inning. 
Sara Schoonaert was able to sneak in another run in the fourth by catching the Friars' defensf) off guard and stealing home. 
"I am always extremely aggressive on the bases and love to use my instincts," Schoonaert said. 
The run gave the Irish a 4-1 lead which Booth was able to hold for the remainder of the game. 
Booth stayed hot Sunday, improving her record to 9-7 on the year. The only run for Providence in the game was due to a fielding error in the top of the fourth inning. 
The stingy defensive play eontinued in the second contest of the afternoon as freshman Brittany Bargar led the team to an R-0 victory. 
The top of the order contin­ued to dominate as the plate as both Mallorie Lenn and Brown finished the day going four-for­six. Brown's last hit was a walk-oil' home run in the sixth that gave the Irish the eight-run mercy rule win. 
The bulk of the scoring came in the fourth inning when the team sent nine batters to the plate and posted live runs on four hits and one error. The big blows came from Laing and Lenn, who each drove in two runs on long doubles. 
The duo struck again as they both drove in one run, each setting up Brown to deliver the knockout puneh in the sixth.

Senior tri-captains Scott Gustavson and Mark Baldwin shared 67th place as they fin­ished with identical scores of 
228. Mter shooting 78 in both his rounds on Saturday, Gustavson posted a 72 on Sunday, which was good enough for Notre Dame's low round of the day. Baldwin did not fare as well on Sunday, stumbling to a final round 78. Sunday's round was the first time in Baldwin's 21 rounds this season that his score was not counted towards the team's total. 
Sophomore Mike King round­ed out the scoring for Notre Dame, finishing 71st at 16-over par 232 (78-78-76). 
The team will be in action again next weekend at the Boilermaker Invitational in West Lafayette, Ind. The event will be hosted by Purdue, and it will take place at the Birck Boilermaker Golf Complex. 
Head coach Jim Kubinski could not be reached for com­ment Sunday.

Leading the way for the Irish was junior co-captain Cole lsban, who finished with a score of even par 216 (74-67­75). His round of 67 on Saturday was the low round for Notre Dame over the weekend, and it vaulted him all the way into a tie for fourth place on an individual basis going into Sunday. Isban 's round on Sunday of 75, however, dropped him back into a tie for

Hinkel told The Observer he could not comment on the par­ticulars of the decision but that Bender's contract was a ycar­by-year agreement, which the College has the option to renew after a review following each season. 
Such a contract structure is the norm for all Saint Mary's coaehes, Hinkel said. 
Bender was named MIAA coach of the year after leading the Belles to a 9-7 conference record -their first-ever win­ning record in league play ­and an 11-15 overall record.

It was unclear Sunday if any other members of the coaching staff would return to the team for the 2006-07 season. Members of the College's Public Helations office were unavail­able for comment.

Squad continues to rebound after falling against Vanderbilt

Notre Dame proved its strength and depth this week­end with a 4-3 win Sunday over Purdue. 
The No. 2 Irish (18-1) took a giant leap forward in confi­dence thanks to this weekend's victory. Freshman Katie Potts said the team needed to prove to itself that it can perform under pressure. 
"After losing to Vanderbilt 4­3, we had lost some of the momentum we had been carry­ing all season [to remain unde­feated after 16 matehes into the season]." Potl<; said. "When the match came down to a pressurn situation, we were able to pull through as a team. That really
