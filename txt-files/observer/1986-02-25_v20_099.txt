More emphasis must be put on accurate communication 
communication, n. the act of imparting, conferring or delivering, from one to another; as, the communica­tion of knowledge, opinion or facts. 
Webster's Dictionary gives this definition for a word we may not use frequently but a word that is im­portant and crucial to our everyday relationships. Ef­fective communication skills work to enhance rela­tionships with other students, parents, professors, boyfriends, girlfriends, roommates and every aspect of our lives. 
If something is communicated clearly and ar­ticulately there would not be any gray area of disagreement and all parties involved will be sure of their responsibilities. If rules and regulations are com­municated effectively students will know their boun­daries. 
Listening and hearing may be the most important part of communication. But when the idea is transmitted by writing it is difficult to say whether or not the material will be interpreted as the sender had intended. 
Some students at Saint Mary's may have experienc­ed the effects of a lack of communication earlier this semester when Saint Mary's Security broke the locks of 39 bicycles and impounded them because they were being stored in the tunnels. Thirty nine seems to be a significant number of bicycles and it is evident these students were not properly warned about removing their bicycles. 
Or were they? 
The student handbook, which each Saint Mary's student receives, includes a paragraph on bicycles and outlines briefly the storage procedure. It states that there will be a "$10 fine for bicycles stored in student rooms, hallways, ironing board rooms and stairwells." Because the bicycles would be a fire hazard in these areas, they are not permitted. The specific reference, however, to tunnels is not related in this listing; but instead hallways in interpreted by Security to mean tunnels. This interpretation may not be as evident for some students. 
Apparently, some students stored their bicycles in the tunnels last year and this year the number of bicycles increased, thus becoming a hazard, according to Security Director Richard Chlebek. Because of the excessive amount of bicycles this year, Security felt it was necessary to notify students to remove their bikes. On Dec. 16, every Saint Mary's student received a let­ter from Security explaining the proper storage of bicycles. It did not, however, state the it was man­datory for students to remove their bicycles from the tunnels and it did not state what would happen if students failed to remove their bikes. It stated that the College had prov ided storage for bicvcles in the base-

Assistant Saint Mary's Editor 

ment of Regina South. Provisions for storage were 
stated and it .said, "please remove your bicycle from post, tree, etc." A misinterpretation could have occur­red because the word tunnels' was not directly stated. 
Because many students did not take action after the initial letter was sent in December, Security sent a follow-up letter to the hall director of each dorm. It was sent on Jan. 14 and requested the hall director to inform each R.A., which would then inform her sec­tion, to remove the bicycles by Jan. 23 from the tun­nels or they would be "impounded by Security and a $10 impoundment fee will have to be paid beofre the bicycle will be released." Unfortunately, at least for Saint Mary's Holy Cross Hall residents, this informa­tion barely got past the hall director. Because of a misinterpretation, the hall director thought every stu­dent received a letter and the information was not stressed to the R.A.s and in turn, many students were not informed. Now, 30 Holy Cross residents are ex­pected to pay the $10 fine to have their bikes returned from Security. 
Because of a lack of communication, either with a misinterpretation of the student handbook or the let­ters written by Security, there was a problem with let­ting students know what would happen with their bikes. Because of this misunderstanding, the students should be allowed to receive their bikes back without charge and everyone will have learned a great lesson: to listen, read and write accurately and learn to com­municate effectivelv.

MIAMI -Racing strike deadlines from unions and default threats from creditors, Eastern Airlines an­nounced yesterday that it would be taken over by aggressive, cost­slashing entrepreneur Frank Loren­zo and his Houston-based Texas Air Corp. 
No details were disclosed im­mediately, but union officials said they understood that Lorenzo, whose company also operates Con­tinental Airlines and New York Air, would continue Eastern, the nation's third-largest carrier, as a separate airline.

The University Club will be the newest addition to campus con­struction projects as renovation will begin within the month, said Director of Physical Plant Donald Dedrick. 
Dedrick, who will attend a pre­construction meeting this week, said plans for the club include a walk-in refrigerator and kitchen remodeling. The refrigerator will be added on to the south end of the building, and it, plus the remodel­ing, carries a $190,000 price tag, he said.

Construction on the University Club will not interfere with the pre­sent work on LaFortune, the Law School, the Veterans' Memorial, or the summer hall renovations of Howard and Carroll, Dedrick said.

A union source and a New York-based airline analyst, both speaking on condition they not be identified, also pointed out that Lorenzo's effort to buy 51 per­cent of Eastern stock in an agree­ment reported to be for between $600 million and $700 million in cash and securities, could trigger a bidding war from other sources. 
Some union officials and Eastern employees were chagrined at the takeover, citing what one call Lorenzo's "anti-untion" reputation. Bryan, accused by Borman of being a major obstacle to resolve Eastern's crisis, said his union was studying "legal options" that could involve blocking the takeover.

The Reagan administration call­ed on Marcos to relinquish power peacefully. "Attempts to prolong the life of the present regime by violence are futile," it said in a statement yesterday. "A solution to this crisis can only be achieved through a peaceful transition to a new government." 
A Washington congressional source said the United States of­fered Marcos a U.S. aircraft to use in leaving the Phillipines. The State Department and Pentagon had no immediate comment. 
Marcos accused Juan Ponce Enrile and Fidel Ramos, directores of the rebellion, of being a "third force" who wanted power for themselves, and claimed Aquino was backed by communists. 
There was no evidence ot a com­munist role in events surrounding the effort to overthrow Marcos. 
Anti-Marco politicians went to Camp Crame on yesterday to discuss forming the provisional government, which Enrile had an­nounced.

Cabinet member Mike Jaeger said he favors the amendment. "This amendment itself seems like a really good amendment to the bylaws. It's really fair to everyone involved. I don't see anything in this amendment that would cause problems for anyone," he said. 
Any change in the bylaws must be proceeded by a two day notice to ensure that senate emebers have in­formation on it, said Holst. This was the first notice about the amendment and therefore no ac­tion could be taken. the senate will discuss the amendment at its next meeting.

The rewntten cnristian Life Commission Proposal was an­nounced to board members, calling for the replacement of the current ?Osition of CLC Commsisioner by a Campus Ministry Commissioner. 
The r~monale given t'or this change is, according to the pro­posal, "The present responsibilities of both leading the commission and maintaining a position within stu­dent government are too consum­ing for the CLC Commissioner. 
"In addition, the previous responsibility of the CLC Commis­sioner involved being a link between Campus Ministry and Stu­dent Government. This is a dif­ficult task for the leader of the CLC as CLC is not in direct link with Campus Ministry." 
This proposal will be submitted to Campus Minstry soon, said Stu­dent Body President Anne Marie Kollman.

Black alumni found need for real changes at Notre Dame 

Racial tension currently does exist at Notre Dame 
One of the primary goals of Minority Awareness Week, along with both pro­moting campus unity and recognizing the talents of and problems faced by minority students here at Notre Dame, is to make the Notre Dame community more aware. As such, I thought it appropriate to highlight a historical event that for one reason or another was overlooked. 
Marin Rogers 
guest column 
In a searing report to the Board of Trustees on Oct. 25, 1985, Terrence Keating, chairman of the Alumni Association Board of Directors, stated that "racism still exists at Notre Dame." Keating came to this conclu­sion as a result of his involvement in the first ever Black Alumni Conference the week 
For those who are yet unaware, there is an impending and ongoing racial tension cur­rently existing at Notre Dame. Recently, black students have commanded the atten­tion of the University's administration in a noteworthy attempt to address some rather pressing concerns. Statistics have revealed that Notre Dame is without a doubt inade­qute in some areas of minority concern, black admittance, of course being the most yjsjble problem. 
Lester Flemons 
guest column 
What is often overlooked, however, is the dissatisfaction black students have expressed in other areas such as social life and academics. Certainly it is no secret that blacks generally are not happy at Notre .Dame. Rather than participating in an enjoy­ing the traditional grandeur of college life, black students at Notre Dame find themselves trapped in a world of perpetual adjustment and plagued by feelings of inade­quacy and frustration. After four years, some black seniors are still trying to figure out where they fit in as far as the Notre Dame social life is concerned. Others are wondering why Notre Dame never seems to make consistent progress in the area of black admittance, or why there are so few black students in Notre Dame's colleges of science and engineering. What was viewed as "accep­table" by black students in 1965 is today stubbornly opposed and justifiably pro­
tested. 
In actuality, the problems experienced by the black community at Notre Dame may basically be attributed to two factors, the

From Oct. lO to 12, a representative group of approximately 20 black alumni (1955­1983) formed a mini-senate at the request of the Alumni Association to discuss the pro­blems facing minority students at Notre Dame, the role of black alumni in the Alum­ni Association and how to attract more black students and faculty to Notre Dame. Charg­ed by Father Theodore Hesburgh, University president, the mini-senate engaged in dialogue with members of the University community including Sister Jean Lenz of Student Affairs, Sister John Miriam Jones of the Provost's Office, Joseph Russo and Kevin Rooney from the offices of financial aid and admissions, respectively, Emil Hof­man from the Freshman Year of Studies Of­fice, Ed Blackwell, the director of minority affairs and several black leaders representing various organizations.

first of which is, quite simply, the homogeneousness of the student body. The University projects and overwhelming pro­Catholic, pro-upper class atmosphere which automatically adds up to a pro-caucasian en­vironment. Therefore, non-Catholics from middle class or lower middle class backgrounds are at an immediate disadvan­tage upon arrival to Notre Dame. Add the fact that the student is a minority and the question of racial discrimination ultimately comes into focus. Yes Virginia, discrimina­tion and prejudice do exist at Notre Dame. It is not the type of discrimination found in the Deep South during the late 19th century, but rather the type that is deviously hidden and secret, indeed the most dangerous kind. In short, the current situation for black students at Notre Dame is not a healthy one. In the past there has been very liitle effort on behalf of the administration to remedy the problem, which of course brings us to our se­cond factor. 
The apparent "blindness" of the Notre Dame administration has proven that if there is a problem in the black community at Notre Dame it is of little concern to them. It must be mentioned, however, that during the last two years certain departments and in­dividuals have taken some action to address the problem. For example, last semester the Alumni Assoication in conjunction with Ed Blackwell, director of Minority Student Af­fairs, organized and sponsored a "Black Alumni Visit" supposedly to address the black situation. As noteworthy as the project was, it ended amidst a noticeable cloud of confusion. Several black students complain­ed that the visit was not publicized properly and that they were not accurately informed as to its initial purpose. "It was a confusing event to say the least," stated Carlton West, 
Father Hesburgh and the Alumni Associa­tion entitled "Imperatives and Recommenda­tions," a report which was to be in turn wholeheartedly endorsed by the Alumni Association and presented by them to the Board of Trustees by Keating. In the report the black alumni found an extremely urgent need for the following: 
I. It is imperative that the trustees, of­ficers, faculty and administration of Notre Dame issue a formal written statement of commitment to increase black American stu­dent enrollment and develop a viable means of accomplishing this goal. 
2. 
In addition to the existing "need based" financial aid program, consideration should be given to the provision of merit scholar­ships to allow Notre Dame to compete for the most academically qualified black American students. 

3. 
The University should review and revise the existing academic counseling mechanism in the Freshman Year of Studies and the 


president of the Notre Dame NAACP col­
lege chapter. "Most of the students, in­
cluding myself, didn't really know what was 
going on." 
Blackwell, on the other hand, gave quite a 
different appraisal of the visit. "It was 
definitely a successful event," he stated. "It 
(the visit) will serve as a catalyst for other 
programs to benefit the black community at 
Notre Dame." 
Whether or not the "Black Alumni Visit" was a success is debatable. One thing the visit did accomplish however, was that it opened criticism of Blackwell and the Office of Minority Student Affairs. Some students are wondering exactly what Blackwell's job en­tails, and what has the office accomplished in the eight years that he has held the posi­tion as director of Minority Student Affairs. "I think we've made some progress," said Blackwell. "But I'm definitely not happy with the rate that we are making it." 
When asked what the specific purpose of the Office.of Minority Student Affairs was, Blackwell responded, "We are probably not as clearly defined as to the purpose of this office as we should be. It's clear in my mind that we should be an office that works to im­prove the quality of life for minority students." 
In another critical area of concern, Pro­vost Timothy O'Meara and Emil Hofman, dean of the Freshman Year of Studies, are jointly working on a project to increase the number of minority students who intend to enter these majors. Currently, O'Meara and Hofman, dean of the Freshman Year of Studies, are jointly working on a project to increase the number of minority students who intend to enter these majors. Currently, O'Meara and Hofman are studying various programs at different universities accross the

4. 
The University should implement a pre­orientation for black American students. 

5. 
It is imperative that the University review all publications portraying life at Notre Dame and modify them to reflect a friendly, integrated campus society. 

6. 
The University should establish pro­cedures for discerning the effectiveness of strategies for implementing the above. 

7. 
Subject to the implementation of the first stated imperative, the National Black Alumni Association should formalize a sub­committee of black alumni to assist the University in: increasing the black American student enrollment in both undergraduate and graduate programs, enhancing the ex­isting student support mechanism and Americans on the teaching/research faculty and administration.

country to get input on further projects of 
this nature. "It's a national problem," stated 
O'Meara. "It has only to come to our atten­
tion in the last year or two." 
Although O'Meara and Hofman should be 
commended for their efforts to improve this 
particular situation, they must realize, 
however, that the lack of minority students 
in these colleges is not merely a "national 
problem." In order to truly address the pro­
blem, we need to travel no further than the 
Notre Dame campus. Minority students cur­
rently enrolled in the Notre Dame College of 
Science have registered complaints concern­
ing a noticeable lack of support from various 
administrators. In one way or another, they 
have been discouraged in their efforts to 
pursue a degree in science. The administra­
tion, of course pays little attention to trivial 
incidences, reducing the students' complaints 
to idol gossip. Since it is the job of the 
NAACP to investigate such complaints, they 
will no longer be unattended, no matter how 
"trivial" they may appear. 
There will always be problems to confront the minority student at Notre Dame. In the future, hopefully, the administration will in­crease its efforts to address the situation. Projects such as the "Black Alumni Visit," and the work done by Hofman and O'Meara are desperately needed and graciously ap­preciated by the black community at Notre Dame. If such efforts continue with the sincere welfare of the minority in mind, the entire Notre Dame community will ultimate­ly benefit.

ND pioneers a new view of Halley's Comet 
JOE MURPHY 
/~!!!_lures writer 
While the world waits tor a 
repeat performance, Notre Dame 
scientists Terry Rettig, Barry 
Baumbaugh and Randy Ruchti 
busily are preparing to again cap­
ture live images of Halley's Comet 
as it orbits the solar system coming 
within 39 million miles of the earth. 
What makes the group of Notre Dame scientists the center of "universal" attention are recent pic­tures the team developed using an intensified CCD (charge-coupling detector) camera. The pictures are faster than anything ever before recorded and show a detailed glimpse of the comet in all its glory. 
ABC World News Tonight, Cable News Network, the Associated Press, more than 300 local television stations and several newspapers used the live ilnages ob­tained in January and wanr the group to get more and better pic­tures of Halley's Comet. 
Last month, Rettig lead the team of Notre Dame and Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory scientists, including AI Baumbaugh and Kelly Knickerbocker, to the U.S. Naval Observatory in South Dade, Fla. In March, the group is planning to go to Hawaii on its way to Sidings Spr­ing, an Australian observatory. 
By going to Hawaii, Rettig hopes to avoid the cloudy conditions which plagued his team in Florida. The observatory in Hawaii is one of the premiere observatories in the world. From there, the team, using the most advanced equipment available, should have optimal con­ditions under which to catch Comet Halley in motion. 
The Australian National Observatory has offered the group the opportunity to use its facilities in March and April. 
In fact, the stystem the group in­tends to use is even faster than the one they used in January. 
The pictures from January gave startling evidence that changes oc­cur in the coma and interior sec­tions of the tail over extremely short periods of time. Why such changes happen remains a mystery. Additional high-speed photographs and a new CID (charge-injected detector) spectrometer will help confirm the changes seen in the January pictures. 
"No one has ever been able to look at the comet on this 
timescale," said Rettig. "We're 
looking at the comet 30 times a se­
cond. That's faster than anyone has 
attempted before. From that, we 
produce a digitized image which 
can detect minute changes such as 
those in the plasma tail that we 
detected," Rettig continued. 
"So we actually see the comet changing brightness in the order of seconds or less," Rettig said. 
The process of attaining these photographs can be understood even from the non-scientifically in­clined. The equipment can be view­ed as a glorified ll-inch telescope with an awfully quick camera and processing capability. The image­intensified light brightens the in­coming light by as much as 50,000 times. 
In Rettig's more exact words, "the people from Fermilab developed this system which can digitize images faster than anyone I know. We currently can digitize 100 frames of data per minute, and we expect to be able to digitize 30 frames every 12 seconds." 
Thirty image frames contain roughly 3.6 million bits of informa­tion. 
For those who know something about computers, Rettig said, "One can fill up a floppy di using just 

several frames of information. 
Since we cannot digitize all of the 
data, much of the information is 
recorded on videotape." 
Rettig recalled, "The project began when several physicists from Fermilab were working with the high-level energy physics group at Notre Dame developing a new technique for looking at charm and beauty events. 
''The equipment they developed involves using an image intensifier and a CCD. By putting those two things together, one is able to look at very low-light level events. Ifone has ever looked at a telescope, one knows any astronomical object has a low light level. And so it was sug­gested that we might work together and devdop this technique for astronomical uses. 
"The comet was an obvious choice because of public interest. We decided to get live images of this once in a lifetime event." 
The Notre Dame astronomers, including Rettig and Baumbaugh, actually went to a local golf course to get away from the city lights and took live images of the comet which WNDU-TV used on its news pro­gram. This video was only in black and white though. 
"The people at Fermilab sug­gested they might be able to do col­or enhancement," Rettig said. "While all of this was going on, Television Broadcast Magazine, out of Kansas City, called saying the project was a great idea for na­tional distribution and sent press releases to every news director in the country advertising free satellite-comet coverage five times each night. 
"The broadcast magazine con­tacted a satellite company out of Minneapolis which then donated free satellite-transponder time. Various news agencies picked up the information," Rettig said. 
From there the project grew in comet-like proportions. 
Rettig's team has brought tremendous attention to the group and to Notre Dame. On the day the group arrived in Florida, more than 300 phone calls were received ac­cording to Phil Kruz, associate editor of Television Broadcast trade magazine which arranged the project. 
The project has sparked interest from several astronomical organizations including The Inter­national Halley's Watch, National Geographic and the Planetary Society and may even receive sup­oort from the National Science 
Foundation. Carl Sagen has voiced interest and written a letter of sup­port for the project. 
"Notre Dame has received a tremendous amount of publicity," Rettig said. And at the bottom of all photographs is the Notre Dame name. 
"While in Florida, we were do­ing numerous telephone interviews per day and usually were on televi­sion live most evenings. National news coverage was provided by ABC World News Tonight, CNN and NBC," Rettig noted. 
Conventional videotaping pro­duces a very poor quality picture of the comet. In the past, stations have relied on still photographs of it. With the new method, Notre Dame is attracting the attention of the scientific community. 
The pictures obtained in Florida gave millions of Americans an op­portunity to see the comet for the first time. The pictures brought scientific excitement into the homes of people who ordinarily would not have had an opportunity to watch the comet. 
The team behind the pictures: research engineer Barry Baumbaugh ofNotre Dame, Professor Terry Rettig of Notre Dame, Kelly Knickerbocker ofFermilab, Professor Randy Ruchti ofNotre Dame and AIBaumbaugh ofFermilab Picture ofHalley's Comet taken from a normal telescope

Wrestling team loses two matches over weekend, record drops to 7-8 
By GREG STOHR 
Sports Writer 
For the first time in five years, the Notre Dame wrestling team has finished its regular season with a losing record. Losses Saturday to Nebraska and Brigham Young dropped the Irish dual meet record to 7-8. 
Undaunted, though, is second­year head coach Fran McCann. McCann was quite content with his squad's final effort before the NCAA tournament, particularly in the 22-16 loss to 12th-ranked Nebraska. 
"I was extremely pleased," he said. "They're a good team. I felt pretty good that we stayed with them." 
An upset victory by either 142­pound Pat Boyd or 190-pound Dave Helmer could have given the Irish the win. Both faced top Cor­nhusker opponents, and both lost narrow decisions. 
''We needed an upset, and we just didn't get it." said McCann. 
The 24-13 defeat by BYU includ­ed the first dual meet loss in the young Notre Dame career of 134­pound Jerry Durso. Down 8-2 after the first period, the freshman suf­fered a 10-9 setback, snapping his 15-match win streak. Durso, however, still can boast of a 36-7 record, best on the Irish squad. 
"I think yau've had afew too many." "Yau kiddin, I can drive with my eyes closed." 
i

: 
Two highlights for McCann were double-winners John Krug and 

Chris Geneser. K.rug, now 16-16 , won a pair at 177 pounds, in-eluding a decision over Nebraska's highly-regarded Cody Olson. Thw two wins by 167-pound Geneser raised his season record to 26-13. 
McCann has little time to be discouraged by the losses. He must ready his young squad for the NCAA Western Regionals, which begin Saturday in Springfield, Mo. 
"We've had a meeting Saturday night, and we decided this was a new season for us," he says. "All the matches before this were preliminaries, but this is the main event. Our kids are motivated, and they believe they can win. This is the goal they've been shooting for all year, and now it's time to get it."

The Notre Dame men's tennis 
team lost a heartbreaking 5-4 deci­
sion to Indiana at the IU Tennis 
Center in Bloomington on Sunday, 
after more than five hours of match 
play. 
The slate of six singles matches went 4-2 in favor of Indiana, which meant that the Irish needed to come away with the three doubles mat­ches in order to take the overall win. Freshman Brian Kallbas and senior Joe Nelligan rallied to win at third doubles and Tim Carr and Dave Reiter knotted the team score at four with a decisive 6-3, 6-4 win at second doubles. 
"It all came down to our number­one doubles," said Head Coach Tom Fallon, speaking of sophomores Dan Walsh and Paul Daggs. "Unfortunately, it got away from us. I was really pleased with our play, though, considering our lack of experience. We played a 
tough team and went toe-to-toe with them." 
Notre Dame's top six players consist of one senior, two sophomores, and three freshmen, with Kalbas and Carr, both

"I'd have to say that it (inex­perience) was a factor," added Fallon. "We were in control of a few matches and couldn't put them

away. But I think that's something that will resolve itself as the year goes on." 
Kalbas, the Ohio and Penn­sylvania state singles champion in high school, was disappointed with the team's narrow loss and his 2-6, 7-6, 6-1 defeat at number-one singles, but said he felt the oppo­nent and not inexperience was the main reason behind indians's vic­tory. 
"Indiana was third in the Big Ten last year," said Kalbas. "They've got some players. I mean, before the match some of us might have been a little nervous, with it being our first real college match. But once you're into it, the inexperience factor is out the window. It's you against him, your style of play against his. 
"We (the freshmen) held our own in the doubles when we needed to. Sure, we should have won the mat­ch, but there wasn't an intimidation factor involved." 
Waish won for the Irish at third singles by a 7-6, 3-6, 7-6 score and Daggs took sixth singles, 6-4, 7-5. Carr and Reiter each lost,in three sets at numbers two and five respectively, and Nelligan was 
defeated 7-6, 6-2 at number four.

Underclassmen carry swim team to NSC crown 
By KATHLEEN McKERNAN Sports Writer The women's swim team won its third consecutive North Star Con­ference championship at the three­day meet this weekend, scoring 519 points to host and closest com­petitor Evansville's 467. "One good thing about this was that we were deep enough," Irish head coach Tim Welsh noted. "We had allowed all juniors who wanted to stay to stay for Junior Parents' Weekend. We hoped the underclassmen would carry the meet." And they did.  Last Thursday, sophomore Amy Darlington opened the individual events for the Irish with a win in the 500-yard freestyle. A medley team of freshmen Kelly Quinn, Tracy Johnson, sophomore Barbara Byrne, and senior co-captain Venette Cochiolo led off the com­petition, taking first in the 500­yardrelay. "Those first victories really set the tone for the rest of the week," said Welsh. "It was a very solid open­ing." The meet was divided into open­ing and championship heats. First, 12 entries competed in each event. Then the top six finishers advanced  to the championship where they swam another race in a fight for their place in the top six. Notre Dame's depth was apparent when its younger swimmers began to fill the places in the championship races. Sophomore Nancy O'Brien made the championship finals in her key events of the 100 and 200-yard backstroke. Monica Smith, accor­ding to Welsh, also made substanti'\l time drops. "Monica, Nancy and Holianne (Logan) were able to populate the big (championship) team for us," Welsh said. "Usually when a team  begins to do that, they begin to take the meet." Freshman Kelly Quinn also made important contributions. On Fri­day, she had four swims which she handles extremely well, according to Welsh. "She did a terrific job," Welsh noted. "If she had been unable to handle it we would have been in trouble. She really helped the pro­gram." On the second day, the Irish received further inspiration through the presence of former coach Dennis Stark. Before Welsh's arrival this year, Stark had coached  ihe women's team in its previous four years of existence. "It was wonderful," Welsh noted. "He came at a time when we were a little bit flat. The en­thusiasm he generated was just great." Other winners over the weekend were Andrea Bonny in the one and three-meter diving and Cochiolo in the 100 and 200-yard breaststroke. Anne Costello, a sophomore in her first year of collegiate swimming, also took first in the 1650-yard freestyle. Darlington established a new school record in the 400-yard individual relay with her time of 4:47.41.
