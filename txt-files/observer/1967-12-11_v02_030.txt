Circle Kicks Off Phillips--Xmas Fund Drive 
Until last July 26 Melvin Phillips, a young South Bend Negro, had a steady job, a wife expecting their first child, and two le_gs. It wasn't the best job in the world and they weren't the best legs. But his job as a punch press operator at the Bendix plant kept the family secure, if not wealthy; and, when Melvin Phillips had two legs, he could walk by himself. 
Last July 26 all of that changed. Mel­vin Phillips and some other young Negroes met with Mayor Allen and members of 
News In Brief: 
Tutor Future 
..The Notre Dame 1utoring program wil end December 14 unless the program re· ceives local or federal funds to carry on The Office of Economic Opportunity which had funded $80,000 for the pro· ject in 1966, has cut off funds.. 
According to tutoring activist Leo 
Welsh, "We will probably go on some­
how." Welsh said the government, faced 
with a necessary cutback in expendi­
tures, decided to give money only to 
programs funded in 1967. ' 


Rack, Frosh President 

c:) Carl Rack was elected President of the Freshman Class in class elections last Thursday. The elections, first of their kind in history, saw almost 75% of the Class of '71 go to the polls. 

Kelly Resigns 
..Senior Norm Jeddeloh, last year's off­campus commissioner of student govern-. ment, was elected Friday to the post of Chairman of the Notre Dame Honor Council. At the meeting, Senior Dick Kelly announced his resignation as Chair­
man, listing "personal reasons" for his quitting. Jeddeloh will hold the office until May I. 

No Assembly 
QThe Student Body Assembly originally 
scheduled for January 4 and 5 has been 
put off by more than a month. The 
move came in the wake of plans by some 
student senators to move to deny funds 
for the assembly if it had been held at the 
January date. The Assembly is now set 
for February 7 and 8. 
Student Union Hall Life Commissioner 
Tom Brislin hopes for attendance of up 
to 3501) at the Assembly. 


Free Un.iversity 
..An organizational meeting for those in­terested in the Free University drew a turnout of over 100 Thursday afternoon in the Library Lounge. Out of those in attendance came more than 90 applica­tions for courses. 
Meeting organizer Suzanne Smither, board member of the Free University, said the largest number of applications, 27, came for a course on radicalism to be organized and taught by Notre Dame Senior Lenny Joyce. 
the City Council at the LaSalle Park Neighborhood Center to discuss ways of alleviating the city's racial tensions. The meeting was sincere and productive. It continued after the Mayor and some Council members had to leave. 
At the same time and unknown to those at the meeting trouble broke out a block away. Moments before the distur­bance broke out Melvin Phillips left the meeting. The police ordered all those leaving the Center to return and Phillips received permission to return also. But as he crossed the street to enter the Center, several police officers attempted to re­strain him. He broke away and ran, pur­sued by a police dog until he fell, wound­ed in the groin and upper right thigh by a shot gun blast. The shot almost killed him . 
Melvin Phillips could no longer walk alone. 
Specialists in Indianapolis repaired 
much of the damage. Melvin Phillips 
would live but without his right leg and 
without his job. His wife was still expect­
ing. He lacked six days of qualifying for 
the Bendix employee insurance program 
and so had no medical resources. The 
bills, large ones, began to pile up, beating 
him down more than he already was. 
Before July 26 his existence wasn't the 
most pleasant but he could pay for it. 
But surgery and hospitalization, nine days 
of intensive life-or-death care as well as 
hours of physical therapy are more than 
Melvin Phillips can afford. At the same 
time, they are something he had to have. 
Still recuperating and without a job, 
without resources other than his own, 
Melvin Phillips has medical bills of more than $2000. 
During the past four months, he and his wife have lived with relatives, their only income a weekly $11.75 food allow­ance supplied by Portage Township. In a week his wife will give birth and Melvin Phillips will need an apartment he can't afford. 
The South Bend Rehabilitation Center is supplying him with an artificial leg and Bendix will rehire him when he is able to 
work. But before Melvin Phillips can walk alone, he needs help in getting to his feet. He still has a debt of over $2000 formed­ical expenses alone. 
A campaign is underway with the support of the Crux, Observer and Scho­lastic, WSND and the Blue Circle to raise the money Melvin Phillips needs. The Charity Chest has contributed $500 and pledges to match the first $1000 raised in the South Bend community. According to Professor Phillip Rathburn of the Notre Dame faculty, the organizer of the fund, the campaign takes no sides in the events of July 26. It is, he says, "an at­tempt to help an individual family whose needs are very real." 
Tonight every student will receive a letter from Professor Rathburn describing the fund. Wednesday night, December 13, members of the Blue Circle will conduct a door-to-door collection in every hall. A collection will also be taken on St. Mary's campus. 


Melvin Phillips used to walk by him­self, sufficient for his own needs. If the drive is successful, if Notre Dame and St. Mary's are generous, he will walk alone once more. But at the moment he needs help getting to his feet. 



Minton Pushes For Senior Cars 
Senior Class President Mike Minton has announced that he plans to speak to the Student Senate Wednesday in support ofa motion which would allow for second semester, on-campus Seniors to have au­tomobiles. The motion, introduced by Walsh Senator Pat Dowd. asks for unani­mous approval for ca.·s and coi1~<:ides with a statement presented D Fr. Hes"burgh by Minton calling for a change in the rule. 

Minton plans to outline to the Ser:ate at least four reasons for change in the rule. The first is improvement of social conditions for Seniors, expecially for thos':! seriously thinking of marriage and need­
ing a car to. visit fiances. A second reason is the need for Seniors to travel in order to secure jobs for when they graduate. 
Dowd, sponsor ot tile Senate motion, points to a third reason as well. He main­tains that with construction of the Athle­
tic and Convocation Center parking space for several thousand cars will be available. According to Dowd, the Administration 
objection of lack of parking space will be 
undermined with completion of the Cen­ter. 
Minton has already submitted a memo­randum to Hesburgh and expects to use passage of the Dowd motion as leverage in future negotiations over the issue.

'TIS THE SEASON TO BE JOLLY 

Yuletide is almost upon us. Let's stop wasting time in classes and get on with our Christmas shopping. Follow­ing are a number of gift suggestions, all easily obtainable at your nearest war surplus boutique. 
First, a most unusual gift idea, brand new this year and certain to please everyone on your list-a gift cer­tificate from the American Veterinary Medicine Associa­tion! Each certificate is accompanied by this charming poem: 
Merry Christmas, north and south, Does your cow have hoof and mouth? 
And your dog, fidele semper, Here's a cure for his distemper. 
Little kitten, cute and squirmy, Bring her in. I think she's wormy. 
7b bunnies, turtles, parrots green, Joyeux Noel! Heureux Vaccine! 


Are you wondering what to give that extra-special man on your list? Stop wondering. Give him that extra-special shaving combination, Personna Super Stainless Steel Blades and Burma Shave. Each gift is accompanied by this charming poem: 
Christmas merry, New Year bonny, 
From your friendly blade Personny. 
You will have the ladies fawning, 
If you're shaving with Persawning. 
Injector style or double edges, 
Both are made by good Persedges . 
And Burma-Shave in plain or menthol, 
Leaves your face as smooth as renthol. 

(NOTE: As everyone knows, renthol is the smoothest substance ever discovered. You may not know, however, that renthol is named after its inventor, Ralph Waldo Renthol, who developed it by crossing a swan with a ball bearing.) 
(Interestingly enough, Mr. Renthol did not start out to be an inventor. Until age 50 he was a Western Union boy. Then fate took a hand. One day while delivering a singing telegram to a girl named Claudia Sigafoos, Ralph noted to his surprise that the telegram was signed "Claudia Sigafoos!" She had sent herself a birthday greeting! 
(When pressed to explain, Claudia told Ralph a heart­rending tale. It seems that when she was only six weeks old, her parents were killed in an avalanche. The infant Claudia was found by a pair of kindly caribou who raised her as their own. They taught her all they knew-like how to rub bark off a tree and which lichens are better than other lichens-but in time they saw that this was not enough. When Claudia reached age 18, they entered her in Bennington. 
(Unused to people, Claudia lived a lonely life-so lonely, in fact, that she was reduced to sending herself birthday greetings, as we have seen. 
(Ralph, deeply touched, married Claudia and tried his best to make her mingle with people. It didn't work. They went nowhere, saw no one, except for an annual Christmas visit to Claudia's foster parents, Buck and Doe. To while away his long, lonely hours, Ralph finally built a work bench and started to futz around with inventions, as we have seen. 
(It is pleasant to report that the story of Ralph and Claudia ends happily. After the birth of their two chil­dren, Donder and Blitzen, Claudia joined the PTA and soon overcame her fear of people. Ralph joined the Elks.) 
But I digress. Merry Christmas to all and to all a good night! Ho-ho-ho!

~.. The success or failure of this
Dear Purveyors of the Purse Strings, 
I am interested in pursuing a course of study in American Litera­
ture at your eminent school of graduate studies. My intent is serious 
and my pursuit of the godly Ph.D. shall indeed be furious. I truly 
love academia and all its glory. Yet one thing bothers me deeply. 
Strangely enough it is not my lack of existential meaningfulness .. 
Neither is it the fact that as an academic I shall be cut off from 
the common man. Or again it is not the problem of my spatial 
existence with the infinity of eternity. The crucial point is that I 
shall be amongst you. It's not that I do not appreciate your pedan­
tic journals but it's the fact that I don't think the length of the 
dashes in Emily Dickinson's poetry is too important. 
Getting back to my qualifications I must admit that my grade 
point is not outstanding. However in order to supplement this de­fect, I have enclosed a recommendation from my golf team coach because he is the only one who really understands me. His analysis of my stance should be disregarded. 
At any rate you are my hope. Next September I hope to be with you, sitting around a seminar table with a beard and a pipe, discus­sing the new school of criticism under the tutorship of the eminent professor emeritus, I.M.A. Pedant. I would like to talk about things like values and beliefs and all that passe stuff, but I am indeed aware of the importance of groveling in the material, of reeli~g. about the world of commas, and of spurting forth the necessary trlVla. 
Oh another reason that I want to attend your university is that I hear 'you give a lot of money and also because you sponsor a daily coffee hour. Also I understand that you are in the vanguard of those schools who hope to actualize the essential freedom of man unchained and challenged in our crass world. And I like your ideas on no curfew and your student parking priviledges. 
A few last words before I leave you. These words I heard half an hour after sign off on our local TV station. Bzzz-B~zz. These a~e indeed brilliant. For as Hobbes said, "the crucible of existence de­pends on the manifold implications of the humming silence." or as Thomas Aquinas said,"there is no such thing as regional ontology" or as Melville said,"this is the indescribable glory of man in defmi­tion" or just to remember Geoffrey of Loviane who said with a 
brilliant poignance "Bzzz-Bzzz". 

Again one last word. I realize that my program shall be inter­disciplinary but I don't mind because I like discipline and because I'm not a communist or anything. Also excuse my impertinence for making an ink mark on the paper. Also I didn't make this con­sciously so please don't subject it to one of those long name psychological tests, fellas. 
We'll see you later. Remember I'm pretty smart and with little help I'm sure I'll know what all the great men said. Yet still sometimes I wonder what I'll say. Give my best to the wife(if you have one) and to anyone else in the Treasurer's office.

THE REPORTER·---­
Seasons Greetings 
BY DENNIS GALLAGHER 


It is only a week until vacation, just one more complete cycle 
in what has seemed an endless merry-go-round ride. You go tc 
Mass for the last time this year at the University. Next week, old 
Father Murphy will say the Mass you attend in your old parish 
church. And there won't be any talk about the love relationship 
between God and man. For the third Sunday in December, you 
fondly remember, is the Sunday that Father Murphy talks about 
St. Philomene's (the church, that is) financial condition. So much 
for the new theology. 
Now is the winter of your discontent banished by the light 
that moves inexorably towards Bethlehem. It has rained (here, not 
in Bethlehem, although perhaps there too) or snowed for the last 
six days in a row. And no doubt it will continue to do so for the 
rest of the pre-vacation period. But despite the sniffles and head­
ache you have contracted via the mythical flu epidemic, your 
spirits rise to the thought of home and Mother and hot apple pie 
at Christmas dinner. 
You consider yourself a serious student, and in a sense you are. 
But somehow the world of Oswego, New York or Titusville, Penn: 
(or wherever you're from) seems somehow almost more_ real than 
the gray fog of South Bend and the mental complex1ty of the 
academic routine. In a few days, you will be home, perhaps playing 
mailman or shoe clerk in order to make a little Christmas money. 
And does existential angst seem real in that secure and mercantile 
little world? Perhaps not, at least this year. 
At least this year, you can accept this little world, which 
exports its fears to ghettoes and tiny, out of the way countries. 
This year, coming home for Christmas means all sorts of wonderful 
things. It means reassuring your parents, and perhaps yourself, 
that you have not really become one of those hippies that the 
newpapers write about. It is really and truly an affirmation of all 
that America stands for. For you do love your country and your 
parents too. And sitting in your family living room, in an atmos­
phere suffused with a familial love that is not constant but is very 
real all the same, it would be hard not to say yes to it. 
'The moral questions are obscured as you become identified with 
the society which formed you. The anathemata, the vast collection 
of objects as sacred as the Bethlehem stable and as profane as Santa 
Claus' beard, become objects to be reverenced and protected. All 
sentimentality has a good ring to it, every note means something. 
The spirit of Christmas, the ritual good feelings towards your cous­
ins, your family, even all the townspeople, somehow hardens your 
determination that this beautiful culture should not pass away. 
Without hate, but with a fierce determination, we will protect 
ourselves from all threats, real or imagined. 
Father Hesburgh's annual Christmas message usually stresses the 
family side of Christmas. He asks that the students remember to 
spend some time with their farrilies in the course of the holiday 
activities. But it might be easier to do this, and to really feel 
close to our parents and the lives they lead, than to remember that 
Christmas, unlike Thanksgiving, is not purely an American holiday. 
If we nust be sentimental, we might at least try for a grand, trans­
cendent sentimentality, for the sake of a visionary God who came 
to save all men.

When Justice Comes, It Will Be Better 
BY RICHARD ROSSIE 
In Light in August Faulkner states "The curse of the 
black race is God's curse. But the curse of the white race 
is the black man who will be forever God's chosen own 
because He once cursed him." (p.222) David Cohn in his 
book Where I Was Born and Raised has portrayed that 
curse which resides not only on a people but also on the 
black earth of the Delta. Cohn's book has recently been 
issued by the Notre Dame Press and includes an introduc­
tion by Notre Dame history professor James W. Silver, 
author of Mississippi: The Closed Society. 
Where I Was Born and Raised is a simple, lucid book 
about a complex place and the peoples that inhabit that 
place. Divided into two parts, the first section written in 
1935 and the second section in 1948, Cohn's book is in 
need of a third section to bring it up to date. Unfortun­
ately Mr. Cohn died in 1960. This task remains for another to attempt. But Where I Was Born and Raised re­mains a classic and a must to anyone who would contem­plate and attempt to know and to understand the Delta and the people there. 
But what is the Delta? Cohn states in his "imperisable sentence" that "The Delta begins in the lobby of the Pea­body Hotel in Memphis and ends on Catfish Row in Vicksburg." The world is full of deltas, but to Mississi­ppians like David Cohn there is only one. Geographers call it the Yazoo-Mississippi Delta. It is a fertile wedge of land 200 miles long, sometimes as much as 85 miles wide, reaching down through 35 feet of alluvial soil de­posits. It is the product of the mingling of the waters of great Mississippi River and the samller Yazoo River and its many tributaries. But more importantly as Cohn shows it is the product of two races of human beings upon which, as Faulkner has said, a curse has been placed-a curse that only the people possessed by it can redeem themselves, can ultimately find salvation as creatures of God. 
Mr. Cohn tells "of the kindness and hospitality of the country, of the courtesy that manifests itself not only outwardly in form but also inwardly in the willingness of men to do you a favor without hope or thought of reward." He observes "the provincialism of a people geo­graphically remote from the great centers of the United States but free from the acrid arrogance of city provin­
cials, cotton and unending talk talk of cotton, the greaL river, and Negroes, Negroes everywhere." But the Delta remains a contradiction; it is full of paradoxes and irre­concilable contradictions. 
Here is a place which possesses racial customs and taboos as elaborate as any customs found in a primitive society and racial practices which are religously observed. The Delta is overwhelmingly Negro; even today the Negro constitutes over sixty per cent of the population. It is this huge presence of Negroes which evolved these codes 
and 
practices. The Delta's insistence on the dogma of 


Negro segregation, economically, politically, and spiritu­ally, is based-as Myrdal has pointed ou-on a refusal to accept racial amalgamation. 
In a chapter entitled "The White Man's Point of View," Mr. Cohn concerns himself at length with social equality and inter-racial marriages. His statements reveal the complexity of the whole situation. "There cannot be a mingling of peoples on terms of complete social equality free from condecension and studied tolerance, unless the persons concerned are willing to grant even theoretically the logical consequences which flow or may flow from the free meeting of social equals of both sexes -marriage. 
"That is a consequence which the upper class New Yorker is not willing to grant even theoretically. The men will not contemplate the possibilities of marrying Negro women, nor will the women consider marrying Negro men, save in the most extraordinary rare instances. This in tum precludes all those associations which occur between equals: dining and dancing in common in public places; attending theater together; going on journey's to­gether; or indulging in sports." 
The Delta has completely lagged behind the economic progress and industrial supremacy of other sections; this is the source of its tragedy and charm. As Mr. Cohn has pointed out, self-reliance or individualistic thrift -neither ofwhich can be actually made to apply to the conditions of the Deep South-are not to be found as an integral part of this region. Nor is it a region that one can attri­bute a consciousness of sin, original or acquired. It is rather "a region of pragmatic attempts at adjustment, of inertia and tolerance, of an attempt to encompass the good life under fantastically impossible conditions." 

Mr. Cohn discusses in a very literary and interesting manner the Negro-his life, his manners, his churches, his sexual life. Mr. Cohn notes that the poor Negroes insist on having an extraordinarily high number of churches, which certainly drains them economically. The church, it must be remembered, is the center of the Negro's life. 
This large number of churches among the Negros perplexes Cohn a great deal; he fails, I believe, to recog­nize the overbearing influence of a fundamentalist reli­gion, which is as much a cause for the large number of churches as the Negro's lack of education and sophisti­cation causes his attraction for the fundamentalism in his religious attitudes. This same pattern is seen to a lesser extent among poor whites of the Delta. 
Cohn also notes the lack of Negro leadership and is highly disparaging of Negro ministers in general. Negro leadership is not as lacking today as it was in 1935 and in 1948, but communication between the two races is not 
much better. Cohn's observation of Negroes is somewhat 
the same as Dollard's in Caste and Class in a Southern 
Town but is certainly not as complete as Dollard's. Cohn 
takes, as well, an entirely different approach from Dol­
lard, who is a social psychologist; Cohn uses stories and 
anecdotes which attempt to present the Negro's situa­
tion in a human con text. 
Cohn argues that cotton, which has brought a living to 

most in the Delta and an enslaving tradition, is the cause 
of the unanswered race problem there. In 1935 and in 
1948 cotton was king; today, it is only prince but still 
the dominating factor. Mechanization has changed the 
situation much, driving the Negroes into the few towns 
and then to the North where many have migrated and 
more hope to migrate. Neither race is fully responsible ­
for the situation as it exists-there are so many factors 
C()hn contends and I must agree. 
The explosive issue of segregation has been called into 

question and theoretically has been resolved by the na­
tional mandate that says it is to be destroyed. Integration 
has come to the Delta in a token fashion, but has come 
nevertheless with little violence and with much resistance. 
More subtle resistance is to follow, and whites will 
"fight" to preserve their idCial purity. People, places, 
things-they change. The Delta will too-it will have to. 
What it will be like I do not know--<.:ertainly when justice 
comes, it will be better.

Editor: 
In regard to your recent ed­itorial entitled "Filling the Gap", I agree that the conservatives of Notre Dame are too quiet and certainly they do have things to say. So I decided I'd say a few things. 
First of all, you stated in this editorial that in regard to Vietnam, "Where before the question was the war itself, now the question is how to remove ourselves from a place we had no right to enter." It didn't seem that way at General John­son's recent speech when about 80% of the sutdents present gave the general four standing ova­tions for his defense of our right and obligation in Vietnam. 
Concerning what you wrote about the members of the New Left becoming arrogant, Mr. Gal­lagher certainly verified your sta­tement by his comment that the students who gave the standing ovations were "eager to prove that their pro-war sentiments had nothing to do with any intellec­tual commitment." Do I detect a note ofarrogance here? However, what can you expect from Mr.

Hesburgh Says Catholic Univ. "Special" 
Rev. Theodore M. Hesburgh, C.S.C., President of Notre Dame, outlined his concepts of the role of the Catholic Uni­versity in an address to a convocation at Stepan Center Saturday afternoon. Hes­burgh, after conferring three honorary degrees, said the Catholic university has "something special" to offer. 
According to Hesburgh, any great uni­versity must be a "community of scho­lars." Hesburgh stated that such a com­munity must search for answers "in an atmosphere of freedom and responsible inquiry." He said, though, that a Catholic

great secular school "in a double sense." 
The Notre Dame President said that first there must be a centrality of philo­sophy and theology at a great Catholic university. He called the study of philoso­phy and theology "the highest level of university inquiry" and said that the great 
Catholic university must "continue and deepen" this area of study. 
"The presence of philosophy and theo­logy simply complete the whole field of university inquiry," he said. "In addition to technical training, the university must develop intellectual and moral values." 
Hesburgh defended at some length the very concept of a Catholic University, using Notre Dame as a counterexample to detractors. He quoted attacks on the Catholic university made by Harvard The­ologian Harvey Cox and Webster College President Jacqueline Grennan. In reply, Hesburgh maintained that with its Board of Trustees Notre Dame has a system "completely comparable to any other university in the nation." 

Hesburgh outlined the system at Notre 
Dame in He said Faculty respect to academic freedom. "Our official statement in the Manual is comparable to any 
other university in the country." Hes­burgh maintained, too, that "I cannot recall a single breach of academic freedom in my 22 years of teaching and Adminis­tration here at Notre Dame." Hesburgh gave a magazine quote from a Jewish professor at Notre Dame, the professor saying "The freedom here is frightening." 
Hesburgh admitted that "The reality of the university world will make the Church uneasy at times." However, ashe was about to conclude, he stated "In the Catholic university every sincere and thoughtful man is welcomed and listened to." 
Standing Ovation 
for Stassen 
A crowd of more than 200 gave former Minnesota Governor Harold Stassen a standing ovation following his library Auditor­ium speech Thursday night. Stas­sen, the first candidate to an­nounce for the 1968 GOP Pres­idential nomination, called for a de-escalation fo the Vietnam war and admission of both North and South Vietnam to the U­nited Nations. 
Stassen stated "I respect the sincerity of President Johnson, but he has made a tragic mistake in turning the Vietnam war into an American war." Aside from criticizing the President's war policies, Stassen said his fellow Republican Richard Nixon is making a "sad error" in calling for a military solution of the 
war. The former Minnesota Gov­
ernor maintained "You cannot 
achieve a military solution to 
problems in the nuclear age." 
At the same time, Stassen 
remarked that "Withdrawal from 
Vietnam would be as tragic a 
mistake as trying to get an A­
merican answer to the war." Stas­
sen called for the United States 
to "stop the killer drives in the 
far north and near the Cam­
bodian border." He said the U­
nited States should "Reserve its 
positions before Saigon and in 
the rice bowl." 
Stassen was optimistic con­cerning the feasibility of his proposed solution. Pointing to the Philippines and Malaya, he said "Guerilla movements tnrn into harmless movements when young men see that they can make progress in society." Stas­sen maintained that in the cur­rent struggle "We can appeal to the young men of Vietnam to calm this war down." 
In addition to proposing a solution to the Vietnam war, Stassen called for a revision and amending for the United Natiom Charter, saying "It is overdue in my judgement that Wf' re­vise and amend the United Na­tions. We must see a new U. 

N. emerge from the old." He said it is "imperative in your lifetime that such a 'new United " Nations' be established." At the same time, Stassen said that both 
Germanys, both Koreas, and both Chinas, in addition to both Viet­nams, mnst be lLN. members. 
Stassen called on free enter­

prise as a force of solution for 
America's urban problems. He 
said the federal government 
should "make a major contract with a major corporate entity, 100 major contracts in 100 ma­jor cities." In this way, Stassen forsees a solution coming out of the crisis of the cities. Also, ~ he called for establishment of interreligious and interracial co­operatives in major cities to pro­mote educational opportunities and humanitarian efforts.

No, No Dunk 

BY AL BERRYMAN 

What do you think about the no-dunk rule this year, anyway? I think it's lousy, too. There are about 100 college players this year that measure seven feet, and the other day I heard about a fresh­man at Houston who scales 7'6". The reasoning of the Rules Com­mittee seems to follow the line that because there are so many "big men", they should try to give the game back to the little guys. As if they ever had it in the first place. 
Why discriminate against an individual on the basis of his height? The ironic thing is that the rule takes the shot away from the short­er man who might not be able to shoot a jump or hook shot against a defender, but has enough spring to get up over him and dunk the ball. 
One of the attractions of college basketball is the "dunk line" during warmups. Anyone who was here two years ago saw St. John's hold up the start of the game by bending the rim down, and 
last year it looked like Elvin Hayes and Company weren't even going to leave the backboard up before the Houston game. 
The new rule includes a warning that prohibits the dunk during prelin1inaries. It is worth noting that the officials take charge of the game ten minutes before the tipoff. Legally, if a referee sees a player stuffing the ball less than ten minutes before a game, he could slap the team with a technical foul. This would lead to the ridiculous conclusion of a game starting by having a player shoot a tachnical. 
As usual, there are ways of beating the rule. Marquette Coach AI McGuire has his players stand about three feet from the basket, jump high enough to get the ball about a foot higher than the rim, and jam it from there. AI is perfectly legal; the rule only specifies that the player's hand cannot penetrate the imaginary cylinder over the hoop. And most teams have the leapers to perform .the feat. Personally, I hope the rule goes out after this year. The dunk is part of the game, perhaps the most exciting part. Seeing a layup this year that would have been stuffed last year takes just that little something out of it. It's kind of like watching a flat-chested go-go dancer.
