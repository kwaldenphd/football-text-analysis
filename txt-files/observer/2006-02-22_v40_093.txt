Bnngal Bouts, the annual amateur Notre Dame boxing tournament that raises tens of thousands of dollars for the lloly Cross Mission in Bangladesh, began Tuesday night as more than 50 eon­tenders met in the ring in the Joyce Center. 
Now in thoir 76th year, the Bengal Bouts are a staple of Notrn Dame athletie tradition. Proceeds from the Bengal Bouts have been donated to the lloly Cross Missions in Bangladesh formerly known as the East Bengal province of India-every year sinee 1931. 
The Bengal Bouts brought in $500 in 1931, a nurnbor that had grown to $100,000 by last year. The money raised has helped build several elemen­

tary and secondary schools in Bangladesh and also has launched several medical care and nutritional programs in the region. 
Senior Miehael Schmitt returned to the Bengal Bouts ring Tuesday night after a yearlong absence, since he spent a semester abroad. He won the 140-pound weight division two years ago. 
"I think the competition is much more challenging this time around," Schmitt said. "There are just a lot of really ta~ented .~ids in the program thts year. 
Most of the Bengal Bouts contenders enter the program without any prior experience in boxing, according to the Bouts' Web site.

After promising to visit my friend at school for four years, I finally made it to the Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs over the weekend.

Editor
Academy is 80 per­cent men, and after receiving many an e-mail about the miseries of hazing I half expected to be ordered to drop and give 20 as soon as I walked through the door. 
The mood of campus was very pro­fessional and the decor rather somber. Instead of a nice fountain or a beautiful bell tower, the Academy has retired fighter jets parked on its main quad. As my friend and I approached the library door, I suddenly realized every student around me had his or her hand raised to their forehead in a salute to some high-ranking officer who was walking by. 
Despite my general suspicion of the military, I decided I had to attend at least one military science class during my visit just for the experience of it. I sat in a room of cadets -decked out in fatigues and boots-in my jeans and sweater looking very conspicuous. The lesson of the day? Give a detailed brief­ing on how to invade North Korea, attack its defenses and destroy weapons of mass destruction. 
Anyone up for a nice Jane Austen novel? Anyone? 
The fourth years (freshmen) at the academy are easy to spot. They have the shortest haircuts and the most hag­gard look in their eyes. Fourth years are not allowed to carry their book bags over their shoulders but instead have to lug them around by hand. 
Exhaustion seems to be the norm at the Academy. Not anI-stayed-up-until­4-in-the-morning-writing-a-paper tired, but an I-stayed-up-until-4-in-the­morning-and-woke-up-at-6-and-failed­my-uniform-inspection-and-got­screamed-at-and-then-had-to-run-S miles type of tired. 
One cadet, looking like a zombie, lowered his cheek to the table in front of him. "No heads on the desks," the professor called out. 
While I myself would never choose to attend a military school, it was impossi­ble not to admire the work that was being done there. Everyone was very friendly and welcoming toward me. Even in the brief weekend I spent with cadets, it was clear they had a strong sense of duty and a desire to serve their country. 
Friday was "Hundreds" day at the Air Force Academy, the day on which lirsties (seniors) are handed an enve­lope with their base assignment at a fancy dinner. As they trickled back into the dorm after the ceremony chatting with friends and calling parents, I found myself excited for their futures and confident that those fighter jets are in good hands.

Bush defends port company sale 
Deal with United Arab Emirates shipping companies endorsed by President 
Associated Press 
WASIIINGTON­
Brushing aside objections 
from Hepublicans and 
Democrats alike, President 
Bush endorsed the takeover 
of shipping operations at six 
major U.S. seaports by a 
state-owned business in the 
United Arab Emirates. lie 
pledged to veto any bill 
Congress might approve to 
block the ahrreement. 
The president on Tuesday defended his administra­tion's earlier approval of the sale of London-based Peninsular and Oriental Stearn Navigation Co. to Dubai Ports World. dnspite eoncnrns in Congress it eould incroasn the possibility of terrorism at American ports. 
Thn saln -expnetnd to bn linaliznd in early March ­would put Dubai Ports in charge of major shipping operations in New York, New .Jersey, Baltimore, Nnw Orlnans, Miami and Philadelphia. "If' there was any chance that this trans­aetion would jeopardize the security of the United Statns, it would not go forward," Bush said. 
"It sends a terrible signal to friends around the world that it's OK for a company from one country to managn the port, but not a country that plays by the rules and has got a good track record from another part of the world," Bush said. 
To assuage concerns, the administration disclosed some assurances it had rwgotiatod with Dubai Ports. It requirod mandatory par­ticipation in U.S. security programs to stop smuggling and detect illegal shipmenl<> of nudear materials; rough­ly :n other port companies partieipate in these volun­tarily. The Coast Guard also said Tuesday it was nearly l'inishod inspecting Dubai l'orb' l'adlities in the Unitod States. 
A senior Homeland Socurity ol'l'icial. Stewart Baker, said this was the first­ever sale involving U.S. port operations to a state-ownod government. "In that sense 

RussiA 


this is a new layer of con­trols," he said. Baker added that U.S. intelligence agen­cies were consulted "very early on to actually look at vulnerabilities and throats." 
Bush sought to quiet a political storm that has unit­ed Hepublican governors and Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist of Tennessee with liberal Democral<>, inducting New York's two senators, llillary Hodham Clinton and Charles Schumer. 
Frist said Tuosday, before Bush's comments, that he would introduce legislation to put the sale on hold if the White House did not delay the takeover. lie said the deal raised "serious ques­tions regarding the safety and security of our home­land. 
!louse Speaker Dennis llastert, H-111., asked the president for a moratorium on the sale until it could be studied further. "We must not allow the possibility of compromising our national security due to lack of' review or oversight by the federal govornment," llastert said. 
Maryland's Hepublican Gov. Hobert Ehrlich, during a tour of Baltimore's port on Tuesday, called tho deal an "overly sneretive process at the federal level." 
Bush took the ram st11p of calling reporters to his con­ference room on Air Foree One after mturning from a speech in Colorado. IIe also stopped to talk bnli>re televi­sion cameras after he returned to the White llouso. 
"I can understand why some in Congress havn raised questions about whntlwr or not our country will be less seeuro as a rnsult of this transaction," the prnsidont said. "But tlwy rwod to know that our gov­ernnwnt has looknd at this issun and looknd at it earn­fully."

Iran says negotiations 'constructive' 
Associated Press 
MOSCOW -A top Iranian negotiator on Tuosday said "constructive" nudear talks in Moscow offered hopn of ending a diplomatic standoff, but some Hussians voieod concern that Iran was using the talks to slltll for time and avnrt interna­tional sanctions.

Semitism," had to stand throughout the presentation, as nearly 80 people attended the event expected to draw fewer than 50. 
Actors from the London Stage will perform "The Merchant of Venice" in the Decio Mainstage Theatre of !WAC Friday, Saturday and Sunday. 
The debate surrounding "The Merchant of Venice" focuses on Shylock, a wealthy Jewish moneyhmder who is often con­sidered Shakespeare's most controversial character. In the play, Shylock agrees to lend Antonio -the merchant of the play's title -money on condi­tion that Shylock may extract a pound of Antonio's !lesh if he defaults the loan. Despite offers to pay twice the price of the loan, Shylock is determined to take his revenge when Antonio defaults, until Shakespeare's heroine frustrates Shylock's plans and redeems Antonio in court. 
Diseussion grew heated as the topic transitiolll~d between anti-Semitism and academie freedom at the University. In a Jan. 23 address to the faeulty, University President Father John Jenkins said the blatantly anti-Semitic play "Oberammergau Passion" would bn hypothetically unac­eeptable for performanee at Notre Dame. Panelists drew parallels between that play and "The Merchant of Venice." 
The opening remarks from Henry Weinfield, Program of Liberal Studies department chair and English professor, were pointed jokes. 
'"The Merchant of Venice' was absent from Jenkins' speech -isn't Shakespeare good enough to be a problem?" he said.

Panelist Gareth Armstrong ofl"ered a point of view different from the five academics -that of an actor. Armstrong, who will play Shyloek in the week­end's productions, spoke from a unique perspective. 
"When you tour this play, there is a sense of isolation if you play Shylock," Armstrong said. "The truth is, it's Shylock -he's the essence of isolation. Shylock isn't a eharacter peo­ple speak to, they speak at him." 
Armstrong applied his expe­rience as Shylock to the broad­er issue present -not just anti-Semitism, but the ostraciz­ing of any member of society. 
"This is what happens when you marginalizing someone who is different," Armstrong said. "[Shylock] demands a pound of flesh. Is this grotesque? Yes -but he's pre­

Embattled Harvard president to resign 
Summers steps down amid debate 

AP Harvard University president Lawrence Summers addresses stu­dents who gathered to protest his resignation Tuesday. 
Associated Press 
CAMBHIDGE, Mass. Lawrence Summers ended his tumultuous stint as llarvard University president Tuesday, choosing to resign June 30 rather than fight with a faculty angered by his management style and comments that innate ability may explain why few women reach top science posts. 
"I have reluctantly eoncluded that the rifts between me and segments of the Arts and Sciences faculty make it infeasi­ble for me to advanee the agen­da of renewal that I see as cru­cial to Harvard's future," Summers wrote in a letter post­ed on the

Harvard president 
Effective at the end of the academic year, Summers' move brings to a close the briefest tenure of any Harvard president since 1862, when Cornelius Felton died after two years in office. Summers has led America's wealthiest univer­sity, with an endowment of more than $25 billion, sinee 2001. 
He became embroiled in sever­al controversies early in his tenure, among them the depar­ture of prominent black studies professors such as Cornel West -who left after a falling out with the university president. 
Last year's comments to an academic eonference on women in science grew into a broader debate of Summers' manage­ment style, whieh some consid­ered brusque and even bullying. 
He also was also eriiieized by some for his handling of plans to expand Harvard's eampus aeross the Charles River in Boston. 
The discontent prompted a 218-185 no confidence vote from Harvard's Faculty of Arts and Sciences last March -the only known instance of such an action in the 370-year history of the university. Faculty votes are symbolic because the seven­member Harvard Corporation has sole authority to fire the uni­versity's president. 
Another no confidence vote was seheduled for next Tuesday. It was called following the resig­nation of Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean William Kirby: Some faculty believe he was pushed out by Summers, though Kirby has said the decision was mutual. 
On Tuesday, Kirby issued a statement saying Summers had aecomplished a great deal dur­ing his tenure, and "he has set in motion important initiatives for the university's future." 
Derek Bok, Harvard's presi­dent from 1971 to 1991, will serve as interim president of the University from July 1 until the conclusion of the search for a new president. 
Board members said in a letter posted online that the past year has been difficult and "some­times wrenching," but they look baek on Summers' tenure with 
appreciation. 
"Larry

Clinton 
Administration, was a prominent economist when he became Harvard's 27th president after Neil L. Hudenstine announced his resig­nation in May 2001 after nearly a decade in ofliee. 
A former professor of econom­ics at Harvard, Summers said he'll return to teaching at the school after a year sabbatical. 
"These last years have not been without their strains and moments of raneor," the 51­year-old Summers acknowledged in his letter on the school Web site. 
Judith Ryan, the professor of German and comparative litera­ture who introduced the latest no-eonfidence resolution, said Summers' resignation was appropriate under the eircum­stances. 
''I'm eertainly glad we're not going to have to have that faculty meeting on Feb. 28th, which would have been agonizing for both sides," she said. 
On eampus Tuesday, about 80 students gathered outside Summers' office inte_rmittently chanting, "Stay, Summers, Stay" and "Five more years." 
"I don't think it's the worst tragedy to happen to Harvard, but it's a shame," said Jonathan Blazek, 21. "He's done a lot for this university." 
Summers eventually emerged from his office to address the students. 
"This is a bittersweet day," he said.

I am convinced that doing anything more than a single major is total folly. It distresses me to see students piling on the majors and minors. I have heard a variety of excuses for this excessive behavior. Not being able to get in a certain class is the biggest one. I have a single major, the most superior major offered of history, and have had no trouble taking the classes in political science, theology, peace studies, etc. I wanted. 
Sometimes, it involved something few are ready to do -go to the professor and ask to be in the class. I mostly take classes based on the teacher anyway. Books are books, but a great instructor is treas­ure. Also, instead of looking at classes like the live-dollar buffet, piling the plate only because it is there and available, be picky, get a good plate and enjoy. 
Others say they are trying to make their primary major more complete. cannot understand the need to do more than one major there either. Like roses cluttered with filler flow­ers, less is always more. Granted, people have different interests and may want to draw from other disci­ples to complement their primary interest. That is what guided reading, a thesis or independent study is for, in my mind. I wrote a history paper on Martin Luther King, Jr. for a peace studies conference to combine my var­ied interests. It shows more creativity and character to design and execute your own project than heaping on the majors for extra run around and grief. 
Next people say they have multiple majors because it's college and they want to study as much as they can. 

Kamaria Porter 
Black, Red and Catholic 

This is the worst rationalization to me. Students see college as the last chance power drive for learning, which is the opposite of what it should be. Here we can gain the praxis to be good thinkers, readers and writers for a lifetime of learning. Trust me, there are good libraries, bookstores and smart people outside of Notre Dame. Relax. Focus. Learn more through taking risks and doing projects that challenge you. 
Also, this attitude takes a short­sighted view of college. We should be developing all our faculties -the mind, the heart and the gut. The mind finds release through asking question upon question and digging deeper. The heart wants real friendships and mentorships with people. The gut wants to take risks, make mistakes and become a legend. 
Notre Dame is a treasure trove of resources and people to help us grow in faith, intellect, character, relation­ships and experience. The Notre Dame archives are stocked with pri­mary sources from distinguished peo­ple and important events. Spending time on the sixth floor of the library encountering history is better than bean-counting classes for your majors or burying yourself in secondary sources, regurgitating other people's ideas on the past. 
Try forming a real relationship with a great professor outside of regular classes. Either through an independ­ent project or more informal arrange­ment -find a mentor to really invest time with you and you with them. Yet, do not be a leech and pull on multiple people. Find your mentor and stick. 
Go to retreats, but do not become a retreat junkie. Reflection is important and better to integrate to you daily (or weekly) life than running off campus every other weekend. I recommend using Campus Ministry resources ­they know their stuff and that is a resource you will be hard pressed to find outside of Catholic strongholds like Notre Dame. 
Go to lectures, but do not make them your master. Try, instead of sit­ting in the audience, organizing your own panel or lecture. 
Last, do not simply run through the packing machine, but leave something behind for others to continue, enjoy and ponder. You can either be the per­son that does great things, or the per­son that hangs out with the great peo­ple. News flash, you cannot become accomplished and talented through osmosis-make your life extraordi­nary or stop leeching. 
The people we heroicize were not hand-picked beforehand by some prophecy, but wanted to live inten­tionally. When you enter a room or meet a new person, think about how you will change the energy of that space and make an impression on that person. How will your presence and talents revolutionize this campus? How will Notre Dame be better for having accepted you? Get a reputation and leave a legacy. 
Everything we are given in the end is not really for us. Our lives, girts, opportunities and abilities to love and take action -all are for the greater glory of God. With that as our goal, how can we distract ourselves with stockpiling classes and majors? We have such important work to do. Use Notre Dame to prepare you for this life long journey-glorifying the cre­ator and bringing about the Kingdom of God.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR 
Social justice and the living wage 
Amidst all the recent talk about academic freedom and Catholic integrity, I think that the true meaning of Catholic character has been lost on us. It seems that the proponents of "Catholic character" favor closed-minded­ness and exclusionism, while those in the academic free­dom camp choose love and acceptance. However, to this point, University President Father John Jenkins has not shown a willingness to go as far as possible to make this a true Catholic institution. So far, all that he has done is promote hard-lined conservatism on the issues that mat­ter the least. At the same time, he has repeatedly refused to answer the questions posed to him by Campus Labor Action Project. 
The heart of Catholic character lies in its social justice teachings. These teachings call for and demand a living wage and dignity for all workers, everywhere. Eight dif­ferent papal encyclicals talk about it, including Rerum Novarum, which says we have a, "great and principal obligation to give everyone that which is just, to exercise pressure for the sake of gain, upon the indigent and des­titute and to make one's profit out of the need of another, is condemned by all laws, human and divine. To defraud anyone of wages that are his due is a crime which cries to the avenging anger of heaven." And yet, on our cam­pus, a plethora of workers start between $6.45 and $10.17 an hour, well below the $12.10 called for by CLAP. 
As a university, we cannot complacently ignore these teachings out of convenience or practicality. We also can­not afford to let the market dictate our wages; they must be based on justice. No Notre Dame workers should live in need, and until their needs are met, any talk of this university having Catholic character is merely talk. It is time for Jenkins to form the taskforce that CLAP has called for and to meet this important issue head-on.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR 

Peace Week calls all to love 
Literary characters-from Vicky Austin to Aloysha Karamazov to Jean Valjnan -havtl been hallmarks in my intnllnctual and idnologieal dovnlop­nwnl. Jean Valjnan and tho whole story of' Lns Mist~rablos, in particular, has grnatly impacted my thoughts siru:e I f'irst saw tho musieal version in London in tlw summer or 2000. Tlwrn are many groat diehotomins that Victor llugo draws in his famous novel, ()f)P of' which is tho impact or .Jpan Valjnan's lil'o and tho non-impact of' the nwolutionarios. Despite their hnst el'forts to chango society to bo more just through violent. moans, tho rnvolutionarins of tho ABC cal'c\ end up bringing destruction to the streots of l'aris that leads only to their own deaths. On tho other hand, Jean Valjoan, al'tnr his conversion, brings tlw love that he encountered through tlw actions of tho Bishop to all those hn nuwts. This radical lovn is trans­l'ormativn in tho lives or others and, 

consequently, in the culture. This love, contrary to the emotional love espoused by our culture, is self-sacri­ficial action. It is a catalyst for change in a way that no violent revolution can even aspire to be. 
What is so powerful about Jean Valjean's self-giving love is that it is an echo of an ovnn greater love ­Christ's. Christ failed to live up to the Messianic hopes of many ancient Jews, who expected the Messiah to come and free them' from the political oppression thny nxporiencNI at the hands of tho Homans. This sort of' political oppression and worse stampod tho 20th century, marking it as om1 of tho most violnnt centuries in history. Many of those who longnd for pnace and freedom strived for it in the mode of Jean Valjean and Christ. Gandhi, Martin Luther King, Jr. and the Polish Solidarity Party are all well-known examples. Others, like the Chilean transition from dictator-

ship to democracy are less familiar. John Paul II traveled to Chile near the end of Augusto Pinochet's violent rngime, when many were tired of working non-violently towards dnmoeracy. In the Chilean national stadium, whore many Chileans wern taken and held in the early years of the dictatorship, John Paul II ended his speech with the bone-chilling words, "El amor es mas fuerte, paz es mas fuertc," (Love is stronger, poaco is stronger). Christ's love is truly stronger, stronger even than death. While the Chileans nonviolnntly over­throw an oppressive political regimn, Christ did much more-he l'rned us from death. As Christians, we are called to model our lives after Christ's -and this ineludes cultivating his peace and love in our hearts and lives, taking seriously his call to turn the other cheek. When Christ's love and peace arc at the heart of nonvio­lent resistance, we can truly hope for

STEPHEN KING 
Ho-w a horror auteur became a literary king 
By MARK BEMENDERFER Assisram Scene Editor 
Stephen King once wrote about human nature and why horror is appealing in his book "Danse Macabre." He wrote that it satiates a primal part in everyone, a part that cannot be ignored. King fulfills his own primal urge by watching horror movies. 
"I like to see the most aggressive of them ... as lifting a trapdoor in the civilized forebrain and throwing a basket of raw meat to the hungry alli­gators swimming around in that sub­terranean river beneath," King wrote. 
But that doesn't fully explain why 
King set a standard for the majority of his subsequent books.

Bachman is an oddity of King's. A pseudonym King developed, stories published under Bachman's name often go further and show more excess in vice. When King chose to write under this name, it gave him the chance to write about things he typi­cally would not, pushing beyond the boundaries of decency that King typi­cally skirted. 
The results were mixed, however. Under Bachman's name, King pub­lished six different stories. They were "Rage," ''The Long Walk," "Roadwork," "The Running Man," "Thinner" and · "The Regulators." The last

Hollywood. A self­professed lover of horror films, King's connection to Hollywood has been strong. At the front of his latest book, "Cell," King gives thanks to Richard Matheson and George Romero. 
Several of King's works have made their way into film, adding to the pre­existing connection. Some, such as "Carrie" and "The Shining," have received several treatments. 
The Early Years 
In 1967, King sold his first profes­sional short story to the magazine "Startling Mystery Stories." Titled "The Glass Floor," it stars a man des­perate to enter the room in which his sister died. Eventually he enters it, but to disastrous consequences. 
While it was short, and King was reportedly only paid around $35 for the publication, the themes of family, dementia and death paved the way for future works. During the early years of his marriage, King sold many short stories to various magazines long before he published his first book. 
In 1973, Doubleday & Co. agreed to publish King's "Carrie." This book was instrumental to King's future career as an author. It was wildly suc­cessful, eventually spawning both movies and plays, and the profits allowed King to quit his job as a teacher and write full time. 
"Carrie" starred a social outcast in an American high school with psychic abilities. As the book progressed, the tortures she had to endure, commit­ted by her mother and by her school­mates, worsened and eventually cul­minated in a disastrous school dance. By taking a standard setting and cor­rupting it into a nightmarish setting, 
however, and has even 

attacked the Bachman works for their violence and depravi­ty. 
"A nasty man," King once said in an interview. ''I'm glad he's dead." 
The Accident and The Dark Tower 
June 19, 1999. It was on this date that King was hit by a van while out on a walk. Sustaining several serious injuries, King was immediately rushed to a hospital. His condition was even­tually stabilized, but the memory of the accident remained. 
This event left a great impression on him and was incorporated into the concluding chapter of King's opus, "The Dark Tower." 
King is known for tying all of his works together through subtle hints and nods, but his overall arching sto­ryline "The Dark Tower" manages to tie them all together. Featuring multi­ple worlds with different levels of existence, it starred Holand of Gilead. 
Inspired by Hobert Browning's poem "Childe Roland to the Dark Tower Came," Roland's quest for the Dark Tower was a central focus that all of King's other works tied into in some form. The recurring villains, the Crimson King and Handall Flagg, also appear in many of King's other nov­els. 
Stephen King has been writing for nearly 40 years. His influence over American readers, and readers worldwide, is undeniable. His latest book, "Cell," continues in the tradition of its predecessors and helps King feed the horror urge of readers every­where.

'THE CELL' BooK REVIEW 
By MARK BEMENDERFER Assisram Scene Editor 
One of the greatest tricks an author can pull is to take something completely ordi­nary and twist it into a source of unimagin­able horror. 
Stephen King does this in his latest book, "Cell." King realizes that today's world is saturated in cellular technology and uses that abundance as fuel for his earth-shak­ing catalyst. While most King stories take place over a fairly limited radius, the events that unfold here are enough to shake the entire world and leave no individual untouched. 
At the beginning of the book, artist Clay Riddell has just sold his idea for a graphic novel to Dark Horse comics. Feeling a sense of accomplishment, he walks the streets of Boston with his artwork in hand and a spring in his step. Pausing to get ice cream, he glances around and notices an abun­dance of people using cell phones. 
Then instantly it happens. King corrupts this picturesque moment, and immediately anyone using a cell phone turns to violently attack the person standing next to them. Clay is shocked to find the world suddenly turning on itself, as mothers and daughters lose any semblance of humanity as they viciously maim each other. 
Clay survives the initial barrage of insani­ty due more to luck than any skills. Encountering several other survivors, they begin to trek across the East Coast in search of loved ones and shelter. In an iron­ic twist, the characters can only safely move at night, as the cell-phone-induced zombies only move by day. Clay has an estranged wife and a son, with whom he wishes to reunite. Unfortunately, his son was in pos­session of a cell phone at the time of the incident, and that thought remains with Clay the extent of the novel. 
Part of the effective nature of King's books is his ability to use recognizable names in the context of his story. Familiar locations are employed, and several of the organizations, such as Dark Horse comics, are non-fictitious. The brands of cell phones 
and other products stem from real life, 
adding their own dark awareness. 
Another thing for which King is known is 
inserting subtle, and some less-than-subtle, 
nods to his fans during the duration of his 
books. In "Cell," the graphic novel Clay has 
sold is titled "Dark Wanderer." This is a 
direct reference to King's own "Dark 
Tower" series of books. Several other refer­
ences can be found as well, so longtime 
King fans will find plenty to like here. 
A simple description of the book would be 
to call it King's "zombie book." Like 
"Salem's Lot" was his vampire novel and 
"Tommyknockers" was his aliens novel, 
"Cell" represents King's first major foray 
into the realm of zombies. 
King's influences while writing this book 
are fairly obvious, and the first half is fre­
netic. Inspired by llollywood, the first half 
reads in a highly visual fashion, packed 
with kinetic energy and a sense of over­
whelming despair. It's easy for the reader to 
mentally picture the events as they unfold, 
adding to the realism of the story. 
However, the complaint that arises with 
"Cell" happens in the second half. Unlike most of the movies in Hollywood, King takes . the story one step further by attempting to introduce an explanation for the zombies. As the story progresses, the zombies begin 
to evolve into a new, original creation. 
While these new monsters are powerful, 
they lack the visceral scares that their earli­
er incarnations incited in the reader. The 
main characters, through a twist halfway 
through the book, also become relatively 
untouchable, which removes the risk factor 
from the book. This creates a slower, less­
engaging second half. 
"Cell" is King's latest work and reflects 
upon his considerable expertise in the field 
of writing and horror. The first half is one of 
the most visceral, engaging stories one will 
find in the modern selection of horror. It's 
too bad the second half couldn't maintain 
the same intensity as the first. But at the 
very least, cell phones won't look so inno­
cent after a read.

SCENE fEATURE 

A retrospective look at the best CGI films 
By SEAN SWEANY 
Scene Writer 

Feature-length animation has come a long way since the era when Walt Disney created memorable, hand-drawn films like "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" (1937) and "Pinocchio" (1940). In this dig­ital age, movie studios have decided that computer generated imagery (CGI) is the way of the future when it comes to ani­mated films. Since 1995, when computers began to replace pencil and paper in mak­ing animated movies, CGI movies have flooded cineplexes every year. 
Monsters, Inc. (2001) 

This Pixar film explores life from the point of view of the monsters who hide under children's beds. In the city of Monstropolis, where energy is created from the screams of children, James P. Sullivan ("Sully") and Mike Wazowski are the top scarers for Monsters, Inc., the city's energy company. The main action occurs when a child runs loose in the city and the two must bring her home amidst various struggles. 
In addition to being a heart-warming story, "Monsters, Inc." stands as one of the most complex and imaginative CGI movies ever created. The textures and scenes cre­ated feature thousands of details almost unnoticeable to the human eye. The peo­ple at Pixar have imaginations that seem boundless, and this movie depicts that perfectly. The coupling of that imagination with their excellent talent makes "Monsters, Inc." a must see for audiences of all ages. 
Shrek (2001) 
Dubbed the "greatest fairy tale never told," "Shrek" is an irreverent comedy 

·from Dream works that follows the green ogre, Shrek, who teams up with a talking donkey to save a princess from an evil king. The voice talent of Mike Myers (Shrek), Eddie Murphy (Donkey) and Cameron Diaz (Princess Fiona) helped this movie draw in huge audiences. While "Shrek" has grown into a huge franchise, the original still stands out as a classic. The story is original and represents the best animated film from Dreamworks. This is because "Shrek" is as rooted in fairy tales as it is in popular culture. The sacrile~ous take on fairy tales is coupled with numerous references to modern cul­ture and results in a film that, while topi­cal, is easily enjoyed b:y kids and adults. 
Finding Nemo (2003) 
An intelligent CGI film that is able to delight, "Finding Nemo" also sends a posi­tive message. Marlin is a clownfish who is overprotective of his son Nemo. When Nemo disappears, his father journeys across the ocean in a touching father-son story. The most impressive aspect of "Finding Nemo" is the underwater world Pixar has created. There are a multitude of details in the CGI ocean that make it real, alive and believable. Most important­ly, the characters in this film are endear­ing and entertaining. Albert Brooks is excellent as Nemo's father and Ellen DeGeneres gives a funny performance as Dory, the fish with no short-term memory. Overall, the world of "Finding Nemo" is one an audience can dive into for first­rate entertainment. 


Toy Story (1995) 
Still, the first CGI movie, John Lasseter's "Toy Story," remains the best. Pixar's inaugural film was a labor of love for all involved. In the "Toy Story" universe, toys like Woody the cowboy (Tom Hanks) come alive when their owners leave the room. When Woody and his gang are joined by the new toy, Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen), friction develops until the toys can unite behind the common cause of outwitting the neighborhood bully. It appeals to the imagination thanks to its originality and heart. Famous for its lovable characters and Randy Newman's endearing sound­track, this is a timeless classic that has spawned sequels, television shows and theme park rides. While ancient by CGI terms, "Toy Story" set an impressively high bar for all successive films. 
The CGI genre is still young and it pro­gresses by leaps and bounds with each new film. These four movies are the cream of the crop and represent the best that CGI films have to offer -if future endeavors follow the path blazed by Pixar and Dreamworks, the medium is in good hands.

DPAC SPOTLIGHT 

Spring Arts Fest to screen uplifting Olympics film 
By BRIAN DOXTADER Assistant Scene Editor 

Hugh Hudson's "Chariots of Fire" is an oddity, a critically-acclaimed Best Picture winner that everyone's heard of, but few casual viewers have actual­ly seen. 
Perhaps best known for Vangelis' ingratiatingly pulse-heavy electronic score, the film was an under-

"Chariots of Fire" is a film of quiet brilliance, with an effective but low-key plot. Nothing about it is particularly flashy, which is surprising for what seems to be a feel-good sports flick. Even the Olympic sequences, ostensibly the climax of the film, arrive refresh­ingly devoid of melodrama. The picture is instead driven by the characters as it follows them in their their calm deter­
mination to win.

across the board, 

ting victory for a film about over­coming the odds. The film will be screened Friday in the Browning Cinema at the DeBartolo Center for the Performing Arts (DPAC) as part of the Spring Arts Fest. 
Though it might be lazily categorized as a sports film, "Chariots of Fire" ­like its Best-Picture predecessor "Rocky" -transcends its athletic ori­gins and becomes about characters and story rather than sport itself.. 
Based on a true story, it follows two runners as they prepare for the 1924 Paris Olympics. Eric Liddell (Ian Charleson) is a devout Christian who runs for the glory of God. By contrast, Harold Abrahams (Ben Cross) is a Jewish student who runs to prove that Jews are not an inferior race. The film follows the two as they train and pre­pare for the Olympics -balancing drama and character development with effective cross-cutting of the parallel 
particularly Ian 
Holm's ornery train­er, Sam. The film is extremely effective throughout, especially in its opening, which depicts runners on a beach to Vangelis' famous score, and in the Olympic sequences, which celebrate the purity of the event and the positive intentions of the amateur competitors. 
"Chariots of Fire" remains an anom­aly to this day, as it was directed by a little-known filmmaker in Hudson who had done nothing before and has done little since. It starred unknown actors in Charleson, who died of AIDS in 1990, and Cross, whose credits since have included such gems as "Exorcist: The Beginning" and the softcore thriller "Cold Sweat." Aside from the venerable Holm, who seems to be everywhere (he has been in everything from "Alien" to "Lord of the Rings" to "Garden State"), there is not a single immediately recognizable name involved in the entire project -every-one from the director to to the screen­writer (both of whom garnered Academy Award nominations for their work) have continued to toil in obscuri­ty. 


Yet something happened with "Chariots of Fire." The filmmakers came together and made a very special film. Almost everything about it is superior, from the screenplay to the acting to the score. It is old-fashioned, traditional filmmaking, but really, what's wrong with that? 
There was virtue in a good story 
well-told in 1981, and there is virtue in .the same today. Perhaps that's why "Chariots of Fire" holds up so well more than two decades later. It treads familiar ground, but it touches the heart and stirs the soul and does so with earnestness and touching sinceri­ty. 
A great film, to be sure, and an uplifting affirmation of the human spir­it.

TURIN 


Associated Press TURIN, Italy-Sassy Sasha Cohen saved the best for last. And boy was it good. With U.S. flags waving and chants of "USA! USA!" rocking the arena, the U.S. champion dazzled the judges with a sensational short program Tuesday night and slipped past 
world champion Irina Slutskaya of Hussia by a slim .03 points. 
Cohen's spectacular spi­rctls and crisp footwork had the crowd clapping to the beat of "Dark Eyes," a Hussian folk tune. She even Bashed some attitude as she concluded a solid evening of skating that will wrap up with Thursday night's free skate, snap­ping her lingers and dou­ble-pumping her fists as if to say, "Top that." 

"I just believed in myself," Cohen said. "To have something like this come out is really great. I am going to believe in myself and expect the best." 
She got the marks she felt she deserved -and the United States has yet another women's gold in sight. Americans have won three of the last four Olympic titles, and if Cohen, a two-time world silver medalist, is this dynamic in the finale, she could add another one. 
"When the numbers came up, I wasn't sure where I would be," Cohen said. "To be in first, it was like 'Wow, I did it, the judges did it. We did it together.' " 
A win for Cohen would break Hussia's strangle­hold on figure skating golds at these games. No country has swept all four events, and the Hussians already own three ­pairs, men's and danee. 
Japan's Shizuka Arakawa and Fumie Suguri were third and fourth, and American Kimmie Meissner was 
IN BRIEF 
Ramirez given permission 
to arrive at camp late 
FOHT MYEHS, Fla. -Manny Ramirez was given permission by the Boston Hed Sox to report to spring training on March 1, six days after the team's first full-squad workout and one day after Major League Baseball's mandatory reporting date. 
"Manny is in Florida completing an extensive training regimen and is prepared to have an exceptional sea­son," said a joint statement from Hamirez and the team that was releasod by the Hed Sox on Tuesday. 
"There are a lot of factors involved, some of them are personal, some are family related," general manager Theo Epstein said. "lie assured us that by staying in Miami and contin· uing to work with his personal train­er, continuing his regimen, that he wouldn't be behind. In the end, after talking to him, we were OK with accommodating him. It's not perfect, but we're going to support him through this." 

Former U.S. soldier medals 
CESANA, Italy -Shauna Hohbock shivered as she grabbed the American l1ag and draped it around her shoulders. 
This wasn't any U.S. athlete using the Stars and Stripes as a prop in some post-race celebration for TV. 
This, was a proud American sol­dier. And now, Olympic medalist. 
"It's an amazing thing to win a medal for your country," she said. "We have the most beautiful flag, and I wanted to be wrapped in it." 
Blasting down an Alpine slide in a shiny, dark American convertible, Rohbock won a silver medal in women's bobsled on Tuesday, finally ending an 0-for-Olympics stay for the 
U.S. sliding teams. 
With roommate Valerie Fl!lming providing the push and applying the brakes, Hohbock completed her four runs down the track faster than everyone but gold-medal winners Sandra Kiriasis and Anja Schneiderheinze of Germany.

Cohen and Slutskaya, the 2002 Olympie silver medalist, have been in contention before. All they have to do is rneall Salt Lake City, where, skating with the title within road1, both stumbled enough for Sarah lluglws to take tho gold.

Hackish rebounded at the end of' the round and landed a few shots to Barrett's head to dose the gap. In the third, Barrett threw a series of hard punches, ensuring his victory. 
Dan Rogers vs. Matt De Lucia 
Graduate student Dan B.ogers defoated junior Malt De Lucia by TKO in a bout that showed two very different lighting styles in action. 
De Lucia spent the lirst round ducking and weaving while Hognrs stood tall and connected on powerful punches, backing De Lucia in a corner where he con­tinued his assault. The referee stopped the light 40 seconds into the second round after Hogers eornernd De Lucia on the ropes. 
Robert "Golden Boy" Cimino vs. Mark Weber 
Hobert "Golden Boy" Cimino won by split decision over fresh­man Mark Weber in a frenetic light that saw a huge number of punches thrown. 
Weber's reckless lighting style got the senior Cimino against the ropes in the lirst round but left him open to hard jabs from Cimino. Cimino began the second round on the oll'ensive before slip­ping onto the canvas after being hit with a hard punch from Weber. In the third round, Cimino took advantage of Weber's aggressiveness by countering enough of Weber's wild punches to win. 
John "The Hlghllghter" O'Connell vs. Patrick Martin 
In the debut match of the 150­pound division, .John "The I-lighlighter" O'Connell beat fellow freshman Patrick Martin by unan­imous decision. 

O'Connell began the light with a flurry of punches that put Martin against the ropes. Martin was less tentative in the second, throwing more punches but still ending up with a bloody nose by the end of' the round. 
Kevin Garcia vs. Guillermo "Almost Done with Law School" Tijerina 
Freshman Kevin Garda lost by a split decision to third-year law student Guillermo "Almost Done with Law School" Tijerina. 
Tijerina began on the oll'ensivn, but Garcia sat back and landed a few counter-punches. In the sec­ond, Tijerina fought Garcia up against the ropes. In the third round, Garda knocked Tijerina to one knee, where he rmnained for a four-count before finishing the fight.

Aland slippod on tho canvas early on and nearly slid out of tlw ring. Lalor in the lirst, the lightors boeame intertwined and eollapsed in a piln on tho wnvas. Tim two wore clinching li1r most of tho sec­ond round, and any punchos landed were thrown as tho two grabbed at each otlwr's hnads and torsos.

The Bellos played tough del'nnso in the 11rst half after Bendnr deeided to add pressure on the passer to try and stop the high-low gamo for Alma. This added pressurn helped the Bolles immensely, leading to a slow ol' del'ensiv1~ stops for Saint Mary's al'tnr tho switch. 
But one major problem for the Belles in tho high-low game was tlw inability to cover the post player, Alma forward Darde Philp. Nnither Newsom nor ennter Nicole Beier were eompletnly efl'nctive in shutting down Philp, who contributed 14 points and l'ive boards in tho upset. 
The Bolles held Alma to just :n percent shooting for the game, but Saint Mary's as a team shot evnn wvrse from the floor at :n.6 percent, including 17.(J percent from behind the are. 
"II' you had told me that we would have hold Alma to 49 points, I would have been sure we would win that game," Bender said. "But we just weren't dieking on oll'ensn. We eouldn't make the easy shots." 
Bendor said one positive he can build on next year from Tuesday's game is the play of current junior Bridget Lipke. Lipke nxcellcd in against Alma, scoring 11 points with four rebounds and six assists -and the guard played the full 40 minutes. 
"I was really impressed by the play ol' the throe veterans -Lipko, BoycH, and Isophomore I Knssler," Bender said. "They started oil' a little slow, but onee they bought into the system, we really took oil" 
Bender said the season was a crucial one for the Belles, who started l-5 but finished third in the conl'erenee and are owners of the best reeord in sehool his­tory. 
Less than an hour after the loss, Bender said he was alroady looking forward to next season. 
"We arc going to be tougher than nails and we are going after it," he said. "Look for us in the IMIAAJ top two next sea­sorL"

"I thought Charel played well in the last five minutes [Sunday], when she had most of her points -I'd like to see her do that for an entire game," McGraw said.

presence, the key to West Virginia's offense has been the team's three-point shooting. The Mountaineers enter mak­ing a strong 35 percent of their shots from long rang£:, while Notre Dame is allowing a league-high 38 percent three-point defense. 
McGraw said she is upset with the team's perimeter defense as a whole but has seen some individual improve­ment, especially from guard Breona Gray.

Since West Virginia's All-American guard and leading scorer Meg Bulger (19.3 points per game) tore her anterior cruciate ligament during the team's loss to St. John's on Jan. 29, Sanni and Owens have stepped up to fill the void. Despite the 1-5 record since Bulger's injury, Owens has had two 20-point perform­ances and a 15-point outing in the six games, and Sanni has maintained her season aver­age of 13.1 points per game. 
"It's just like every other team we've played-you can't just shut down one person [to winl," McGraw said. "I think Sanni's playing really well for them. She's a tough matchup for us inside." 
While the Irish must worry about West Virginia's post 
defensive per­formance if they hope to win, McGraw said. 
"They're a lot more athletic than we are," she said. "Their guards are shooting the ball [well] from the perimeter." 
Notes: 

+ After the loss to the Huskies, Notre Dame's ratings percentage index (RPI) actual­ly jumped one spot from No. 40 to No. 39. McGraw said she believed the team needed an RPI under 40 to ensure itself of a bid to the NCAA Tournament. The selection committee chooses 31 teams for at-large bids to join the 34 conference winners in the tournament.

Biddle held the advantage in the first round as The Hurricane struggled to find a way inside his taller opponent. 
The Hurricane was more successful at landing punches in the second and third rounds, but Biddle scored points with a series of left­right hooks to secure the win. 
Anthony "The Desire" Steier 
vs. Glenn Gutierrez 
After an uneventful first round, Glenn Gutierrez set the tone in the second round of his match against senior Anthony "The Desire" Steier but was unable to hold on for the win. 
The speedy Gutierrez worked his way inside his opponent, landing a left jab and right hook that drew a gasp from the crowd. 
He ran out of gas in the third round, though, allowing the taller Steier to land sever­al left-right jab combinations that forced Gutierrez to wrap up. The Desire won on the comeback by a split decision. 
Sean Mallin vs. Pat 
"Homewrecker" Garrison 
In a battle of Keough Hall dormmates, sophomore Pat "Homewrecker" Garrison implemented a classic style to defeat freshman Sean Mallin by unanimous decision. 
Mallin used the height advantage, but Homewrecker danced around his opponent, finding and attacking the body whenever he could. After an even first, Homewrecker forced Mallin into the corner several times in the second round and delivered a right jab that nearly knocked him over in the third. 

Sean "Ooohs and Ahhs" McNichols vs. James Draths 
After freshman Sean "Ooohs and Ahhs" McNichols nearly fell in the second round, his opponent freshman James Draths went in for the kill. 
Sensing McNichols's vulner­ability, Draths backed him into the corner and delivered a series of right hooks that sent "Ooohs and Abhs" to the mat -the first time all night a fighter fell. 
McNichols tried to take back the advantage in the third but lowered his defenses midway through the round, allowing Draths to keep him at bay while the round ended. Draths won by unanimous decision. 
Jim Buffi vs. Lawrence "The Boston Massacre" Sullivan 
In the bloodiest match of the first session, sophomore Lawrence "The Boston Massacre" Sullivan beat soph­omore Jim Buffi by a technical knockout in the third round. 
The fight started poorly for Buffi, as he was knocked down in the first minute and lost his mouthguard after Sullivan landed a forcible left jab. The bout had to be stopped several times as Buffi required medical attention but kept getting back into the ring. 
One minute into the third round, The Boston Massacre landed a powerful right hook­left hook combination, causing the ref to stop the fight on a standing-eight count.

John "The Iceman" Cooney vs. Mike Batanian 
The first 145-pound division fight of the evening featured sophomore John "The Iceman" Cooney and freshman Mike Batanian. 
Both boxers were timid in the first round, but they came out firing in the second. Iceman opened with a series of jabs to the head, turning Batanian's face bright red. In the third round Batanian mixed up his style with high­low and left-right body shots, while Iceman kept punching Batanian in the head. 
Cooney won in a split deci­sion. 
Eddie "His Love" White vs. Calvin Evangelista 
In 140-pound division action, sophomore Eddie "His Love" White and freshman Calvin Evangelista competed in the most exciting fight of the first session. 
White began the first round on the attack, but left himself open to a series of big right jabs from Evangelista. Something must have been said about someone else's mother, because the boxers ran out in the second round and exchanged a rabid volley of left and right hooks that roused the audience to thun­derous applause. 
Neither boxer bothered to defend during the exchange, and Evangelista eventually gained the advantage. White came out aggressively in the third round, but Evangelista maintained control and won by unanimous decision. 
"Gentle" Ben Vincent vs. Mike "Just call me Merck" Henning 
Junior Mike "Just Call Me Merck" Henning was anything but easy on freshman "Gentle" Ben Vincent, as Henning forced a technical knockout 15 seconds into the second round. 
One of the fastest fighters of the night, Henning dodged most of "Gentle" Ben's punch­es, and then landed big hits on his out-of-position opponent. 
Andrew McGill vs. E.J. Alston 
In the 145-pound division, junior Andrew McGill forced another second round techni­cal knockout against freshman 
E.J. Alston. 
Alston had a slight height advantage, but McGill was too quick, landing left jabs at will and getting inside for some bodyshots. 
In the second round, a dev­astating right hook from McGill caused the ref to give Alston a standing-eight count. McGill continued his domi­nance, and after another standing-eight count, the ref called the bout 1:10 into the second round.

With time running out in the first round of the MIAA Tournament Tuesday, Belles guard Allison Kessler took a desperation three that bounced off the rim, gave No. 6 seed Alma College a 49-46 upset of the No. 3 seed Belles and ended one of the best seasons in Saint Mary's history. 
Kessler hit a three-pointer on the previous Belles possession to cut the Saint Mary's deficit to 47­46 with less than five seconds remaining in the game. 
The Belles fouled Alma senior Katey Peacock for the third time in the fmal minute, and the veteran made 6-of-6 from the free throw line to keep the Scots just out of

Not even a 25-2 Irish run in the second half was enough for Notre Dame, as the Irish dropped their ninth Big East game of the season Tuesday to No. 3/4 Connecticut in overtime, 75-74-the team's sev­enth league loss by three points or fewer this season. 
Connecticut guard Marcus Williams led the Huskies (24-2, 11-2 in the Big East) with the sixth triple-double in school history. He scored 18 points to go with his 13 assists and 10 rebounds. 
"We gave ourselves a chance to win a basketball game against a very good team," Brey told the Associated Press after the game. "For our group, there is no more resilient basketball team than my guys."

Irish travel to West Virginia for big game 
Team visits hostile WVU Coliseum after loss to No.6 UConn 
By KEN FOWLER Sports Writer 

Notre Dame can secure a spot in the Big East Tournament with a win over conference foe West Virginia tonight at 7 p.m. in Morganstown, W.Va. 
Both teams have struggled over the past few weeks. 
The Irish (14-10, 5-8 Big East) enter the WVU Coliseum on the heels of a 79-64 loss to No. 6 Connecticut. The Mountaineers (12-12, 4-9) lost their fifth straight contest Sunday, a 62-58 defeat at the hands of Pittsburgh. 
"I think we have similar problems," Irish coach Muffet McGraw said. "We are both scoring not as many points as we would like." 
Notre Dame has not scored 70 points since beating DePaul 78-75 at home on Jan. 17. West Virginia last accom­plished the feat against the Blue Demons as well, topping the then-No. 11 Demons 82­70. 
After dissecting the team's 15-point loss to Connecticut, McGraw said sophomore guard Charel Allen will be a key to improving the Irish offense.
