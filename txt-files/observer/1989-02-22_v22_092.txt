Kitty Dukakls is "terrific" after two weeks of treatment at an alcoholic rehabilitation center, said her husband, Gov. Michael S. Dukakis. "Kitty sends her best. She's doing very well. She'll be back in a couple weeks," said Dukakis Monday. Mrs. Dukakis, 52, entered Edgehill New­port in Rhode Island on Feb. 6. Dukakis attributed his wife's excessive drinking to "physical exhaustion, the stress of the campaign effort and the post-election let­down." -Associated Press 
A pig has allegedly been stolen by five city workers in Lake Station, Indiana. The five men have been charged with theft in the disappearance of a pig from a Lake County farm, authorities said Tuesday. The men allegedly stole the pig from a field while they were on duty, hauled it away in a city truck, then slaughtered it and divided the meat, according to Indiana State Police and city police investigators. One count of Class D felony theft was lodged against each of the five men on Friday. They were ex­pected to surrender to Lake County authorities on Tues­day, the police chief said. No trial date had been set.

INSIDE COLUMN 



Unfortunately, JPW was non-fun for non-juniors 
Junior Parents' Weekend has come and gone-­
Thank God. 
And now begins the official JPW Recovery 
Week. 
Take this scenario: 
"Hi John, how are you doing?" 
(Grumble, grumble) " ...exhausted." 
"Oh, you're not coming down with The 
Campus Cold, are you?" 
"No, I'm recovering from spending too much 
time with Mom and Dad, eating too much alien 
food, getting far too little sleep, and frantically 
searching for ties and socks that match not only 
each other but my jacket as well." 
"Poor baby." 
"And on top of it all, I have three exams and 
a paper due this week." 
When will the JPW Ordeal end? ... 
Granted, for many juniors JPW was probably 
one of the most memorable events in their three 
years at Notre Dame, but for the majority of 
the freshmen, sophomores and seniors stuck on 
campus, or in town at all, it was the weekend 
we'd most like to forget. 
I was one of those unfortunate many non­
juniors without a "plan for escape." 
I could have gone on the sophomore escape to Chicago, to the tune of $45. But why should I pay an extra $45 to get away from a campus, food, and my own bed, which are already paid for, to go to a place that I've visited many times, to spend even more money, doing things that I am completely apathetic about--all in the name of getting the heck out of here on that weekend? Spring break is right around the corner, and I'd rather throw my money away on beach passes than Marshall Field's argyles. 
This is not to say that there is absolutely noth­ing to do on campus JPW weekend--there's al­ways Theodore's, or even the Freshman Swim Party. Social alternatives abound. 
Of course, let's not forget the ever-popular ''spending-all-weekend-in-the-'Brare-so-that-I­can-destroy-the-curve-on-the-next-test-in-that­300-level-class-I -take-with-all-those-juniors'' 
option. 
I was tempted to try this one, but decided against it because it might leave me with noth­ing to do between 9 p.rn. and 3 a.m. for all of the rest of the week. Besides, why do today what you can put off until tomorrow? It just goes against nature. 
The only true option open for all of us non­juniors is to hang around the dorm, eat pizza, talk about all of the work we should be doing (the juniors aren't getting any homework done this weekend, so why should we?), and wallow in self-pity for our lack of motivation to do anything vaguely productive. 
Vicious rumors were even circulating to the effect that parietals were being cut to midnight in honor of JPW. Oh, wouldn't that have been just peachy? It would have been easier to send us all to bed without supper. Who knows what might happen between the witching hours of midnight and 2 a.m.? 

There's only so much a bunch of intelligent, (and bored-to-tears) students can discuss after solving the problems of world hunger, the na­tional debt, and the meaning of life. 
But don't we all look like such the studious little bunch gallivanting across campus with bright shining faces, carrying a packed nap­sack? My, all of the juniors' parents must have been heartily impressed with our apparent in­satiable thirst for knowledge, as they walked by all the packed study lounges Saturday on their way to pick up Junior for the epic JPW Mass. 
Mom is all too impressed: "It's so amazing how serene the campus is--even on Friday and Saturday nights. What an institution! This is the most amazing configuration of a student body ever concocted--everyone is so polite and controlled . " Then Dad pops into your decep­tively clean room, and together they cry when they say, "I'm so glad we're all part of the big, happy Notre Dame family." 
Now most of the juniors out there are prob­ably reading these as the words of a bitter and infantile sophomore. After all, I'll have my turn to inflict JPW on everyone else next year. 
That may be the case. 
All I know is that next year I will finally heed the advise of those who were wise enough to escape Junior Parents' Weekend. I'll escape the drudgery of JPW in London, and maybe think of all those 'non-juniors' as I drink my lager with friends in the Square.

N.A.A.C.P. to honor Dr. King 

By ANGELA MCDONALD News Staff 
The Notre Dame N.A.A.C.P. chapter will be holding a re­enactment of the march on Washington this Friday, February 24 at 6:00p.m. 
The march will begin at three different locations on the Notre Dame campus: North Dining Hall, South Dining Hall and the Main Circle. 
The march will consist of a candle light vigil and the sing­ing of "We Shall Overcome" and "Lift Every Voice and Sing." It will end at the steps of the Administration Building, where a special program will

The program will consist of a brief history of the actual march that took place August 28, 1963, dramatic readings in honor of black history month, a performance by the Notre Dame gospel choir and an ora­tion of Dr. Martin Luther King's "I Have a Dream" speech. 
"This is an attempt to make everyone aware of the plight of minority students," said Joseph Watson, vice-president of the N.A.A.C.P. "We hope that this march will further the awareness and help to elimi­nate the ignorance and insen­sitivity that has taken place in the past."

our own path at a cost," said Rafsanjani. 
The confrontation over Rushdie appeared to be eroding efforts by some Iranian officials, including Rafsanjani, to strengthen ties with more nations despite op­position by fundamentalist hard-liners. 
Although Rafsanjani was not quoted as endorsing the death sentence, his comments indi­cated Iranian leaders were closing ranks in the face of retaliation for Khomeini's death call. 
President Ali Khamenei, a Rafsanjani ally, said Friday that Rushdie might be par­doned if he repented and apologized. Rushdie, a Moslem himself, apologized the next day, but Khomeini ignored the overture and renewed the death threat. 
The 41-year-old Indian-born author has been in hiding with his wife in Britain, where he lives. 
The Common Market nations stopped short of breaking rela­tions with Iran but said that in addition to recalling top diplomats, they would suspend high-level visits to and from Iran. 
Britain, a market member, went a step further by recalling its entire embassy staff.

Freshman Adviisory Council gets underway 
Special to The Observer 
The Freshman Advisory Council (FAC) is a group of freshmen who plan activi­ties for their peers in an at­tempt to make adjusting to college life less traumatic. 
Each dorm has one repre­sentative to the council. The group meets once a week, usually at a host dorm, to plan activities and discuss problems that their con­stituency may be having, and try to come up with pos­sible solutions to those prob­lems. 
The council has adopted the Cardinal Meridean Nur­sing Home for the duration of their stay at Notre Dame. The Center for Social Con­cerns provides weekly trans­portation for those freshmen who would like to share a little time with those less for­tunate than they are. 

The FAC is led by Presi­dent: Mike Ferguson of Stan­ford Hall, Vice President Ted Stumpf of Fisher, Trea­surer Jrulie Robertson of Pasquerilla East and Secre­tary Megan Wyers of Pasquerilla West. 
Any freshman with ques­tions, problems or sugges­tions may call the F AC office in LaFortune at 239-6954. Of­fice hours are: 
Monday and Wednes­day: 2:30 to 5 p.m. 
Tuesday and Thursday:

INS to speedl up processing of aliens from S. America 
Associated Press 
BAYVIEW, Texas-The Im­migration and Naturalization Service (INS) on Tuesday began erecting tents inside the fence of a minimum-security prison under a plan to speed up the processing of aliens and to jail those denied political asylum. 
The Catholic Bishops of Texas charged that they foresaw "the creation of the largest concentration camp on 
U.S. soil since the incarcera­tion of Japanese-Americans during World War II, a shame­ful page in our history." 
State Department officials began making recommen­dations on asylum applications here under a plan announced Monday to deal with an influx of Central American im­
migrants  and  speed  up  the  
weeding  out  of  "frivolo us"  
claims.  

Under the plan, applicants will get an answer as early as the same day and will be sub­ject to immediate arrest and detention if denied asylum. 
Before Tuesday, applications could take weeks to process, and aliens were released on their own recognizance while they awaited appeals or deportation. 
INS began erecting tents at its rural Port Isabel Service Processing Center here in case the number of detainees at the facility exceeds bed space. As many as 5,000 could be detained in tents within the 315-acre facility, officials said.

"The students do not want to be stressed or bothered with making sure no one cheats on a test while they are in the process of taking a test them­selves. This institution is too academically competitive to have such a code applied," said a student. 
The students were also asked what they believed to be the biggest advantage of the honor code. Williams said that most students seem to understand what the University has in mind. "The biggest advantage of the honor code is a clear statement of the academic principles ofthe University and the students' individual knowl­edge of these principles," said one student.

why they thought the honor code should be continued, dis­continued or why they were not sure. 
A student who said that the honor code should be discon­tinued said, "It is unfair for the students to not only be respon­sible for the subject matter of the course during an exam, but to also have the responsibility ...to be looking around for other students possibly cheat­ing." 
One student thought the code should be continued, "With changes. More student input, suggestions from this survey." 
A student who would like to see the honor code modified said, "One way to make the honor code work would be to grant the accuser anonymity from the accused person. That would mean the person who is making the allegation would not have his identity known."

NEW YORK-Don't look for a sexy swimsuit issue from the latest offspring of Sports Il­lustrated. 
Sports Illustrated for Kids is aimed at the 8 to 13-year-old crowd, and publisher Ann Moore promises that the only people the magazine will show in bathing suits will be compet­ing in sports like swimming, water skiing or surfing, or will have "an Olympic gold medal around their neck." 
The magazine was launched in January after Moor secured quarter-million dollar commit­ments from 30 advertisers. Half of the 500,000 circulation is sold by subscription or, start­ing with the March issue, at newsstands. 
The other 250,000 copies are given free to third through sixth-graders in 1,000 of the poorest schools in the nation. 
They include places like Carter Elementary School on Chicago's south side, where the head of the reading resources program, Jessie Hamlet, says few students could afford a magazine subscription. 
"My teachers have been so grateful to have them," she said. "The kids love it. They say things like, 'You mean it's ours to keep?"' 
She hopes the magazine will encourge students to read. 
"It's something current, and the look of it is so nice that it makes them want to pick it up and read it. That's half the bat­
tle there," she said. 

Those are reassuring words 
to Moore, who says she worked 
more than 18 months develop­
ing and launching the maga­
zine. 

Improving literacy was one 
of the pitches she used in per­
suading companies such as In­
ternational Business Machines 
Corp. and American Telephone 
and Telegraph Co., as well as 
sneaker and snack makers to 
pay $250,000 each for a year's 
worth of advertising space. 
But the motivation isn't en­tirely altruistic. The magazine is expecting to make a profit eventually, Moore said.

And in the great Capitol Hill tradition-that for every economic problem there must be a solution in the federal treasury, I intend to go beyong mere murmurs of civic sympathy to a concrete legislative proposal. After all, I think it's only fair that we try earnestly to do for them what they are always so eager to do for us. First, though, let's stop for a moment of pity, mixed with irony. The irony, of course, is that the United States Congress in recent years has been a prinicpal exponent of what we might  ate executives, even though such plans augmented the nation's embarrassingly low savings rate. It wrote vindic­tive ex-post-facto laws on tax shelters. It itched even to take on private health plans, presumably in the belief that the folks who brought us Medicare could do it better. Never mind that congress­men's own salaries were supplemented quite beauti­fully with everything from ultra-lavish pension plans to taxpayer-sponsored health clubs to Senate bean soup. If you're a "public servant," the least the public can do is serve you, isn't it? But time did march on, to  at the current "modest" 4.5 percent, prices will double every 16 years-so what's a poor congressman to do if he wants to maintain the two­home standard of living which he, his wife, and his campaign manager are con­vinced he is entitled to? Here's where I am prepared, out of patriotic compassion, to come to the rescue of these deserving legislators. I am prepared to ignore such distracting trivialities as the report that more than two-thirds of the new House members are already getting an increase from what they earned in the private sector. I want them to have what every decent  live on that? But a more sat­isfying 100 percent pay raise. And let us say openly that it will go into effect in precisely four years. The only proviso is that the raise will be held in abeyance un­less, on that date, the federal budget has been balanced without increasing taxes. Taxes, plainly, are not the problem. Federal taxes last year grabbed 19.4 percent of national income, precisely the same portion as in 1980. The exploding deficit has been entirely the creation of unchecked federal spending. Check it, fellows, and you shall have your reward. The delayed, but high~r  might indeed get better con­gressmen. Short of earning what would then at last be a merit pay increase, members of Congress would then have to live with the present system. If this then induced them to return to private life, reviv­ing after long neglect the tradition of one-term public servants giving brief unsel­fish service to their govern­ment, that might not be the worst result, either. But I'd rather double their pay, in return only for their doing what both parties have been promising for a generation. What could be fairer that that?

Debate program should be varsity level 
There have been many positive reports of the Iceberg Debate series presently being conducted on campus. I myself had the occasion to attend one of the debates and came back thinking of the potential such a program has to foster discussion of ideas on campus. 
Rob Hennig 
ruby tuesday 

I do not believe, however, the Iceberg Debates are being placed in a proper perspective. While the issues being dis­cussed are important to us at Notre Dame, the style and ability present in the actual debates is somewhat limited. Like a good intramural basketball pro­gram, the Iceberg serves a valuable role in allowing participation by stu­dents not otherwise able to compete. 
While I applaud the effort on the part of those who brought the Iceberg Debates to fruition, I find it profoundly ironic that it comes at a time when the intercollegiate debate squad is being so sorely tested. While there has been such a new and vigorous emphasis placed on this intermural competition, there has also been an almost complete ab­dication of the varisty program here at Notre Dame. 
The administration at Notre Dame has decided to relegate the Notre Dame Debate and Speech Council to club status. Such a move threatens to kill a program already struggling for sur­vival. Presently, only a limited number of students compete for the program and the director is part-time. They are outmanned at debate tournaments by programs featuring many more teams, several graduate assistants and coaches whose full-time duty is to focus on the success of the debate program. It is the equivalent of Bethel College being asked to place Notre Dame in football. 
Surely the administration would never think to have an intramural bas­ketball program or the bookstore bas­ketball tournament without also field­ing a univeristy team. Why should debate be any different. 
Intercollegiate debate attracts some of the brightest and most promising stu­dents in the nation. In a recent poll, it was found over half of those individuals listed in Who's Who had some debate experience. Several presidential con­tenders, including Michael Dukakis and Walter Mondale, debated while they were in college. Intercollegiate debate serves as the premiere chal­lenge of the intellect available to stu­dents. David Zarefski, a well-known debate expert in the field and a former champion debater himself, compared the level of research in a year of debat­ing at the college level to that of a master's thesis. 
Some of the country's most respected universities have realized the potential of debate. Harvard, Dartmouth, Northwestern, and Michigan are peren­nial contenders to win the National Debate Tournament. The Universities of California at Los Angeles and Berkeley are powers in the Cross Ex­amination Debate Association national sweepstakes. Debate has brought ac­claim and prestige to these univer­sities. More than that, a large, well­supported debate community has invigorated the entire collegiate com­munity and fostered a broadening of communication. 
Perhaps what is the greatest irony of all is that Notre Dame used to have just such a program. In the early 1950s and 1960s, Notre Dame had one of the most repected debate programs in the country. Notre Dame regularly qualified to the National Debate Tourn­ament, reaching as far as the semifinal round. Notre Dame also was one of the founders of the CEDA value-oriented style of debate. 
Since that time, however, there has been a dangerous decline of emphasis upon the activity. The department of communications, the home of strong programs elsewhere, has seemed more content to produce plays than to promote speech. The department remains adamantly opposed to the pro­gram, wanting nothing to do with the debate team on campus in any way, shape, or form. The rationale behind such a position is, at best, a mystery. 
Pehaps the attitude of the communi­cations and theatre department toward debate is indicative of a larger disdain. I was shocked when I first came to Notre Dame to discover not a single speech course was offered. It would seem that a university so concerned with building tomorrow's leaders would provide at least one introductory speech course. Oral communication skills play a vital role in everyday life. For the department to ignore com­pletely this field is nothing short of in­credible. Perhaps the Department of Communication and Theatre should drop the word communications in its title to dramatize its true emphasis. 
The administration had been content to give the debate some small status by assigning it to the Office of Student Affairs. Yet with only a part-time direc­tor and no graduate assistants, there has been very little support staff. Fur­ther, after years of inflation and declin­ing priority, the Debate and Speech Council budget has been severely constrained. Even if the current squad could compete at the national level, there would be inadequate funding for more than the most skeletal program. 
Perhaps the attitude of Notre Dame toward its debate program is best shown by the office space allotted to the Debate and Speech Council. Before the renovation of Washington Hall, the squad had a room in the back, with the director having a private office as well. After the renovation, the Department of Theatre took over that space and now uses it exclusively for theatre activi­ties. The debate team was ordered to the basement of the Library, where no squad room was given and the director had to share his office with a graduate student. 
The program was subsequently evicted from even that humble residence. With the help of the Office of Student Affairs, the council was able to secure an office in the newly renovated LaFortune Student Center. Again, one room was given which the director had to share with another or­ganization. This past summer, the pro­gram was ordered out of that office and, again only with the intervention of the Office of Student Affairs, iven a small

cubbyhole in LaFortune. 
During these moves, the Department of Theatre has been uncooperative. While the administration has been help­ful, the powers that be have stripped the program of any remaining status within the University. To declare the debate team a club is to project a profound ignorance of the position debate holds compared with other in­tercollegiate activities. Debate is no more a club than the football or bas­ketball teams are clubs. A nationally respected debate team will compete in as many as twenty tournaments a year. Unlike any club, a debate team will be representing its university on a very high profile, directly competing against other universities. 
While the current situation is shame­ful, it is not without hope. The Iceberg Debate series presents an opportunity for many students and faculty to par­ticipate in the debating process. Such a move is a positive step. It is, however, foolish to claim this as being anything more than it really is: an intramural program. If this university is serious about debate, any by all indications it should be, a reversal of the administra­tion's decision to downgrade the inter­collegiate debate program is impera­tive. 
Notre Dame is too good a university not to have a top-flight debate program. It is time the administration and the department of communications and theatre put up the ante to make this a reality.

Christian music comes alive 
STEVE MEGARGEE accent writer 
A my Grant relied almost n exclusively on recent ma­terial during her concert Tuesday, but that did not seem to bother a near­capacity crowd at the Joyce ACC. 
The 28-year-old Christian singer performed 18 songs, 15 of which came from either her most recent album Lead Me On or the 1985 release Un­guarded. 
Michael W. Smith, a keyboardist in Grant's band who has co-written many of her songs ("Find a Way," "Lead Me On") and who has five successful contemporary Christian albums in his own right, opened the show. 
Grant is a three-time Grammy award winner who has dominated contemporary Christian music charts in the 1980s and became the first solo gospel artist to record a platinum album with 1982's Age to Age. 
During Tuesday's concert, she ignored several religious ballads from earlier in her career like "My Father's Eyes" and "I'm Gonna Fly." Instead, Grant sang seven songs from Lead Me On, a record released last summer that focuses almost as much on marriage and love as on religion, and six songs from Unguarded. 

The concert opened with "Love of Another Kind," the opening track on Unguarded. From there, Grant's band performed an assortment of songs from Unguarded and Lead Me On, with "Everywhere I Go" and "Saved By Love" highlighting the set. 
She followed with "Stay for Awhile," a single released on 1986's greatest-hits package The Collection, and "Em­manuel," from a Christmas album she released in 1983. 
Gary Chapman, Grant's wife of six years and a guitar player in her band, per­formed an inspired 20-minute set while his spouse took a break midway through the concert. 
Grant returned to the title track from her Lead Me On album and followed that with "Find a Way," a single from Unguarded which in 1985 be­came the first contemporary Christian single to hit the Top 40. 
"Find a Way" started a string of four consecutive songs from the Unguarded album, including "I Love You," "Wise Up" and "Fight." 
Grant left the stage follow­ing that stretch, then returned and sang "Angels" from the 1983 album Straight

Ahead and "Say Once More," the last song on the Lead Me On album, for her encore per­formances. 
"Say Once More" high­lighted the show, as did "Friends," a song written and recorded by Smith which never hit the pop charts but has become a favorite at high school retreats across the country. On both these songs, Grant was alone onstage with only a keyboard and Smith and Chapman's voices back­ing her up. 
The rest of Grant's band also was impressive. Backup singer Donna McElroy showed off her voice during a crowd-rousing solo perfor­mance early in Grant's show, and Terry McMillen switched between the percussion and harmonica during both Grant and Smith's concerts. 
Smith, a singer who comes out of the Kenny Loggins and Richard Marx mold, devoted most of his seven song perfor­mance to material from his recent release i 2 (Eye). His high-spirited set alternated between upbeat songs like "Hand of Providence" and "Pursuit of a Dream" and ballads such as "I Hear Leesha," a song he recorded after the death of a teenage friend and neighbor. 

PAIGE SMORON accent writer 

T 
here is an answer to the dim social life (or lack thereof) at Notre Dame; an opportunity to do something to spark a new flame of friendship, or even a roaring inferno of passion. This weekend, the Student Union Board is providing a chance at romance. By participating in the first campus computer dating service, students can insure themselves an evening of intrigue and, possibly, ten­derness at the Campus-Wide SYR Friday night. 
Face it, another Valentine's Day has come and gone, and the lovelorn spent it sniveling under a quilt in bed, comfort­ing themselves with the one Valentine they received, a Hallmark from their mother that was so warmly per­sonalized, "Most precious son or daughter ... " 
Bill Watterson 


Sure, everyone's looking for a thrill, but how much will this highly technical match­making process cost? For one time only, this opportunity is available at no extra cost. When students buy their ticket for $3 to the Campus­Wide SYR held in North Dining Hall, they can simulta­neously sign up for what just might turn out to be the ad­venture of their spring semes­ter. 
'"Whether you end up with the love of your life or a new friend, you'll have a great time at the SYR:" 
The idea of a computer dating service on campus is a result of a SUB survey asking the student body for their in­put. There was a tremendous response for any social activi­ties that would provide ways to meet new people outside of dorm life. "You can't lose," said Lisa Mackett, SUB Campus Entertainment Chair­person. "Whether you end up with the love of your life or a new friend, you'll have a great time at the SYR." 
Perhaps the thought of spending quality time with a mysterious stranger is allur­ing, but what about those questionnaires that have to be filled out? Those probing and confusing questions that ask, "If you could be a pasta noodle, what shape would you be?" and, "What is your sexual preference?" can be so intimidating. 

Fear no longer, because SUB's computer dating ques­tionnaire only contains five questions, and none of them are designed to be too confus­ing. 
The questionnaire asks basic questions, such as your favorite sport, music, subject, weekend activity, and ideal vacation spot. If anyone gets stumped on a question such as, "My favorite subject is ... " the important thing to re­member is, don't panic. As any good SAT tutor will ad­vise, skip it and come back to it later. For the most part, there shouldn't be any prob­lems, the answers are all multiple choice. 
It's a small price to pay, isn't it? One can only imagine what will happen Thursday night when the risk-takers get the momentous phone call telling them who their date will be. Picture the way they'll pick up the telephone and captivate their potential dream date with their sultry voices, much like the viva­cious actors and actresses on commercials for those teen talk lines do. 
It can happen. Take the chance.

Indiana, Dallas make trade 
Williams goes to Mavs for Schrempf, 2nd-round choice 
The Observer I E.G. Bailey

Herb Williams (with the ball) was traded to the Dallas Mavericks for Detlef Schrempf and a second-round draft pick yesterday. Williams is averaging 12 points and eight rebounds a game. 
Associated Press 
DALLAS--The Dallas Mavericks, still waiting for Adrian Dantley to end his hol­dout, traded forward Detlef Schremp£ and a second-round draft pick to the Indiana Pacers on Tuesday for forward Herb Williams. 
The Mavs own Indiana's first-round draft choice in 1990 if it's a lottery pick. If not, Dal­las will get the 1991 choice. In­diana's second-round pick from Dallas comes in the year the Mavs get a first-round se­lection. 
"Schremp£ has worked hard for us these past four years and we believe he will fit into In­diana's running offense in a positive way," said Dallas' chief operating officer and gen­
4 eral manager Norm Sonju. "This trade should benefit both teams. I've always respected Williams as a shot blocker and as a force who can play power forward as well as center." The 31-year-old, 6-foot-11 Wil­liams, a first-round draft pick in 1981, was averaging 12 points and eight rebounds a game.

The 26-year-old Schremp£, a first round draft pick in 1985, was averaging nine points and four rebounds per game. 
"It's a positive thing for me. I'm going somewhere else and I hope I have a chance to play well," Schremp£ told ABC radio. "I'm a little surprised. But it's a business and I'll just have to make the best of it." 
It was the second trade in a week for both Dallas and In­diana. The Mavs traded for­ward Mark Aguirre to Detroit for Dantley last week. On Mon­day, the Pacers traded Wayman Tisdale to Sacramento for LaSalle 
Thompson  and  Randy  Wit­ 
tman.  
Despite  a  face-to-face  

meeting with owner Donald Carter in Washington, Dantley has missed two games at the cost of $30,487.80 salary. 
The Mavericks have given Dantley until Wednesday to report without suspension. 
Schremp£, who suffered a stress fracture above his left ankle in the Western Confer­_ence finals last year, was shoot­ing only 43 percent from the field. He was averaging 22 minutes per game. 
Williams, who averages 34 minutes per game, was shoot­ing 45 percent from the field and had 80 blocked shots. 
He was the eighth-best shot blocker in the NBA last year. Williams also had one game this year in which he grabbed 29 rebounds. 
"We hope this trade fills a need in the areas of defensive rebounding and shot blocking," said Rick Sun, vice president of basketball operations. "Herb's an experienced vet­eran who has proven that he's a good shooter in the low post. He boards consistently, partic­ularly on the defensive end and he can block shots." 
Dallas isn't expect rebound­ing ace Roy Tarpley, who is in a drug rehabilitation center in California, to return this year. 
"In light of the tenuous sit­uation regarding Tarpley, the addition of a legitimate, bonafide power forward is ex­tremely reassuring to all of us," Sonju said.

Women's tennis faces Illinois State at home 
By CHRIS COONEY Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame women's tennis team resumes action today at 3:30 p.m. when they face Illinois State at the Eck Tennis Pavilion. 
The Irish are 0-2 in dual meets this season, but they were very impressive in their last outing, the Eck Doubles Classic (Feb 3-5). At that tourn­ament, the Irish won the num­ber one doubles flight and took second place in the third and fourth spots. 
Coach Michele Gelfman hopes that the winning will con­tinue today as Notre Dame begins a long stretch of matches after a 2 l!2-week break. 
"The attitude of the team is good right now,'' Gelfman said. "Our young players are realiz­ing how much their matches count. When they win, it's for each other instead of for them­selves. That is really unusual on a tennis team." 
Although the Irish have never played the Redbirds before, Gelfman knows her squad will have to be ready. 
"I know they are not as good

Lewis Hall's aggressive trap­ping defense helped it earn a 36-31 victory over Pasquerilla East Monday nightto advance in the winner's bracket of the Women's Interhall basketball playoffs. Breen-Phillips contin­ued its winning ways as well with a 46-22 romp over Badin. 
The Lewis victory was far from easy. Although the Chick­ens led 9-8 after the first quar­ter, P.E. used an aggressive man-to-man defense to forge a halftime tie. 
The score remained close in the second half. A full court zone press helped Lewis es­tablish a tenuous three point lead late in the fourth quarter, but a Colleen O'Connor layup with 1:40 left to play tied the game at 30 for P.E. 
Sue Lippa, whose scrappy in­side play and soft touch from the foul line were a big plus for Lewis, then hit a field goal to give Lewis a lead it would never relinquish at 32-30. 
A steal by point guard Ellen 'Mouch with 40 seconds left and some clutch free throw shoot­ing sealed the victory. Mouch finished with nine points for the Chickens, while center Molly Mahoney led P.E. with eight points despite some second half foul trouble. 
Lewis Coaches Tom Zidar and Mark Laboe said that in such a close game, their play in her position. She will be followed by Katie Clark, Kristy Doran, Kim Pacella, Tyler Musleh and Cathy Bradshaw. Natalie Illig will enter the line­up to play doubles. 
"Natalie has really been our team's leader this year," Gelfman said. "The younger players on our team are really impressionable and Natalie has taken on the responsibility of being there for them. She's had a lot of problems with in­juries this year, yet she's al­ways at practice and ready to help." 
as they used to be," Gelfman commented, "but we can never underestimate our opponents.''

The team's long lay-off usually would have left them rusty and unprepared. Instead it was a blessing in disguise, as the Irish spent the time recovering from illness and in­jury. 
"We've regained our strength," explained Gelfman. "At one point last week, I had only four girls here for prac­tice. We go from now straight through until May so we needed the rest."

players "showed a lot of poise, and we're happy about that. We played P.E. earlier in the season, and we think that helped us tonight." 
Zidar and Laboe also were very impressed with possible future opponent Breen­Phillips. They noted that, "B.P. is big, strong, and very aggressive on the boards. We will have real difficulty match­ing up with them if we meet them later in the tournament." 
Indeed, the Blitz appear to be the dominant team in the tourn­ament. If they can continue to play like they did in their 46-22 victory over Badin Monday night, B.P. will be tough to beat. 
On defense, B.P. freshman guards Colleen Burke and Kate McKenna forced passes out wide on the wings and prevented Badin from getting easy shots from the perimeter. The B .P. blitzkrieg continued on offense as freshman center Lora Mangan led the way with 13 points. Juniors Cynthia Guckien and Vicki Buth added 12 and 9 points respectively for 
B.P. Kristin Miller scored 11 points and Babs Broemmel chipped in 6 for Badin. 
Mangan said that her team's recent success doesn't put any extra pressure on the Blitz. "Defensively we feel that as long as we are aggressive, we can continue to be successful. Everybody on this team has a 
terrific attitude." 
Coach Jeff Heilert agreed. "The Interhall Playoffs are something new to the freshmen on the team, so I don't know that they feel any pressure. Our one point overtime loss to P.W. in the last game of the regular season was a good experience for us. It showed us that we will have to continue to work hard to have a chance in this tourn­ament.''

Indiana too much for Irish 
Upset-minded Irish can't keep 'dragon-slaying' ways 
By BOB MITCHELL Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame men's ten­nis team, coming off two of its biggest wins of the year, could not continue its dragon-slayer role against Indiana Univer­sity. Yesterday at the Eck Pavilion, the 8-4 Irish, playing its fourth match in five days, fell short to the Hoosiers, 5-4. 
"They are a good team and are in great shape," said Notre Dame head coach Bob Bayliss. "If there is justice, Indiana will be in the Top 15 in the next na­tional poll. There are no ex­cuses but there were definitely some sore legs out there in the beginning." 
Looking for its fourth upset of the season, the Irish dropped four matches in the singles competition for the second straight match. Against North Carolina on Sunday, the Irish were 4-2 after the singles but regrouped to stun the Tar Heels, 5-4. However, this time, Notre Dame could not over­come the top 20-bound Hoosiers. 
Already this season, IU has knocked off three Top 20 teams­-No. 14 Clemson, No. 10 Cal Berkeley and No. 15 Arkansas. Fifth-year Indiana head coach Ken Hydinger believed his team was not at its best yet nonetheless was glad about his team's tenth win of the season. 
"We worked hard and played in control," said Hydinger. "Notre Dame has definitelyimproved but we did what we were capable of doing." 
In order to win the Irish would have had to sweep the doubles contest-s. The No.1 and No. 2 duos came up on the win­ning end of their matches but the normally dependable No.3 duo of Ryan Wenger and Dave Reiter bowed in three sets, 3-6, 6-2, 6-2 to the Hoosiers' No.3 team of Charles Wright and David Russell. 
Irish skipper Bayliss summed up the situation of this up and down match. 
"In the third set, the No. 3 match slipped away," said Bayliss. "We lost control but give them (IU) credit for com­ing back well." 
In the other doubles matches, the No. 1 tandemn-Dave DiLucia and Mike Wallace snared a three set win. The freshman and junior combina­tion downed its foes 6-3, 4-6, 7-6 (13-11). In this contest, the No. 1 team held off ten match points while capitalizing on their third match point. 
Brian Kalbas and Walter Ool­hare, the No. 2 team, captured a two set victory, 6-2, 6-4. 

In singles play, No. 1 Dave DiLucia and No.3 Walter Dol­hare earned the two Irish vic­tories. DiLucia extended his winning streak to eight matches with a straight-set vic­tory over 59th ranked Gunmar Salumas, 6-2, 7-6 (7-4). 
No. 3 Walter Dolhare over­whelmed Chris Gambino in two sets, 6-2, 6-4. The 6-2 junior posted his second straight win. 
"That win was a big one for him," said Bayliss of Dolhare's second consecutive win. "He is on a roll. Walter showed pa­tience and did a great job of approaching the net." 
Senior captain Brian Kalbas does not believe the loss will have any ill effects on the team. 
"I though we could have played better," said Notre Dame's No.2 player. "We had o~r chances to win but I think today was a case of being too tired."

Associated Press 
COLUMBIA, MO--The 1988­89 basketball season had the prospects of being the best of Norm Stewart's 22 at Missouri. 
There would be his 500th vic­tory, a real chance at a seventh Big Eight title and even his first Final Four berth with a team loaded with veterans. 
Instead, it's been a profes­sional rollercoaster and a per­sonal disaster. 
With three weeks remaining in the regular season, Stewart is in a Columbia hospital having undergone surgery for bleeding ulcers, cancer of the colon and a diseased gall blad­der. 
His wife, the Missouri homecoming queen when Stewart was the star of the bas­ketball and baseball teams there, has had two major operations in the past months. 
And his program is under suspicion of having broken NCAA rules, a major event at the only school in the history of the Big Eight never to have been placed on probation. 
Even in a season when Stewart's behavior occasion­ally seemed erratic, no one around him seems to have de­tected specific signs he was having trouble with his health. 
"Coach Stewart is the type of guy who keeps things inside," said Rich Daly, who will coach the Tigers until Stewart returns, if he does this season. "His family is very closeknit and I admire him for that. He doesn't want them in the press." 
The spotlight was all Stewart's as 'the season started. 
The only starter not return­ing was Derrick Chievous, the school's all-time leading scorer but the kind of player whose cavalier attitude made his loss likely to be addition by subtrac­tion. 
Everyone else was back from last season's 19-11 team that finished fourth in the Big Eight,· which supplied half the field for the Final Four. Add in talented freshman Anthony Peeler and prospects looked extremely bright. 
The 54-year-old Stewart's tenure with the Tigers is im­pressive. 
There have been 26 coaches at the seven other conference schools in his years at Mis­

souri, the third longest stint at one Big Eight school behind only Phog Allen at Kansas and Hank Iba at Oklahoma State. When the season began, the other seven head coaches in the conference had a combined 24 years of service. 
Stewart got his 500th victory and his 403rd at Missouri with a semfinal victory over North Carolina in the Big Apple NIT in the third game of the season. 
That made him just the 24th Division I coach to reach the 500-victory plateau but Stewart's name certainly can't be considered a household name in a sport where coaches are the only constant.

Within the first three minutes

from junior Joe Fredrick, who 
finished with 20 points on the 
evening slammed the door on

"With Ellis out, we knew some guys would have to step in there and get the job done," said Irish head coach Digger Phelps. "People like Paddock and Tower did and that gave J a mere Jackson and Joe Fredrick time to get into the groove the second half."

Fencers take part in Junior Olympics 
By CHRIS FILLIO Sports Writer 
While the Notre Dame fen­cing teams were inactive this past weekend, a small contin­gency of fencers traveled to Colorado Springs for this year's Junior Olympics. 
Six members of the men's teams and four from the wo­men's competed in the annual event aimed at selecting can­didates to represent the United States at the upcoming Junior World Olympics, to be held this year in Athens, Greece. 
Freshman Rachel Haugh (Portland, OR.) garnered a spot on the U.S. team by win­ning the gold medal in the wo­men's epee competition. Her sister, Kelly Haugh, placed ninth while Tara Kelly finished seventh. Freshman Mary Westrick also competed in the epee division. 
The best showing for the men this weekend came from fresh­man Ed Baguer. In a rematch of last year's New Jersey State high school sabre champion­ship, Baguer was edged out by James Talioferro, a freshman currently at Holy Cross junior college. Talioferro secured a spot on this year's U.S. team while Baguer's silver medal finish earned him a place as an alternate. 
In addition, sabremen Henry Chou and Chris Baguer finished 13th and 14th, respec­tively. 
In the men's foil competition, sophomore Phil Leary placed 
13th overall while freshmen teammates Ed Lefevre and MikeTriskotookthe38thand 
40th spots. 


Irish head fencing coach Mi­chael A. DeCicco was pre­sented with the 1988 Jack Kelly Fair Play Award this weekend. 
The award, established in 1985 in honor of the former USOC President, is presented annually to an athlete, coach or official for an outstanding act of fair play and sportsman­ship displayed during the past year. 
At the 1988 Junior World Championships for fencing, hosted by Notre Dame, a poten­tially serious incident of inter­national proportions involving the Cuban team was averted through the actions and quick thinking of DeCicco. 
During the opening ceremonies, the Cuban team was not properly recognized with its national anthem upon marching onstage, due to a technical error. 
In response to this perceived insult, Cuban delegation leader Rafaela Gonzalez and her fen­cers decided to leave the stadium and to withdraw from the competition. 
DeCicco explained the prob­lem to Gonzalez and convinced her to reconsider. Then, in a gesture of supreme goodwill, he personally escorted the Cuban team into the stadium, himself carrying the team ban­ner.

Oklahoma controversy takes toll on children 
ND beats Dayton in 2nd-half surge 
By MOLLY MAHONEY Sports Writer 
DAYTON, Ohio--The Notre Dame men's basketball team rebounded from a lackadaisi­cal first half to roll over a hungry Dayton squad 83-66 Tuesday night and improve its record to 17-5. 
Notre Dame was without freshman LaPhonso Ellis, who sat out the game after taking an elbow to the eye during the Feb. 19 Houston game, but the Irish still owned the boards the entire game. 
The Irish finished with a 41-23 rebound advantage and used a powerful inside game to beat the 11-13 Flyers for the second time this season. 
The Irish controlled the opening tipoff, but little else in the first half as the Flyers worked a home crowd of 12,581 into a frenzy en route to taking a 35-32 lead into the locker room at halftime. 
Freshman Keith Tower drew first blood for the Irish with a power layup but it was the Flyers, led by an unlikely hero, 

Irish hockey ends long season 
By BRIAN MCMAHON Sports Writer 
The Notre Dame hockey team concluded its season with an 11-2 drubbing at the hands of the Western Michigan Broncos. The Broncos dominated every aspect of the game in ensuring themselves plenty of highlight film ma­terial in what for them has been a disappointing season. 
The Irish struggled in their own end early yet managed to jump to an early lead when freshman defenseman Kevin Patrick sent classmate Lou Zadra in alone at 3:23 of the first period. Zadra netted his fourth goal of the year with a low wrist shot from 15 feet. 
The Broncos tied the score 32 
seconds later when Paul Polillo 
beat Lance Madson with a 
wrist shot from the left wing. 
Polillo, last year's CCHA who took advantage of the home court hysteria. 

Dayton's Norm Grevey drew an unexpected start over guard Ray Springer and tallied seven points to help Dayton grab an early 11-4 lead and keep Notre Dame from getting on track. 
With a virtually nonexistent perimeter game, the Irish used their speed and size to do what it does best--run and rebound-­and prevented Dayton from running away with game in the first half. 
The tandem of Tower and 6-9, 225-pound junior Keith Robin­son, who finished the night with a game-high 25 points and 16 rebounds, kept the game tight, as the two combined for 16 of team's first half points. 
It was their presence on the front line that helped the Irish creep back from a seven point deficit and grab a 21-20 lead on a short jumper by junior Joe Fredrick with 7:01 left in the first half. 
The Irish advantage was short-lived though, as Dayton's

Bengals enter into semifinals

Marvelous Marvin would be 
bragging. Muhammad Ali's rhymes 
would be flowing. 
But over in the Joyce ACC boxing gym, as 55 fighters prepare for tonight's semi­finals of the 59th annual Bengal Bouts, (7:30, Stepan Center) modesty prevails. 
Take, for example, two of the pre-tourney favorites, return­ing champions Mike Noone and Doug Biolchini. Noone won a unanimous decision over James Dailey during Sunday's quarter-finals, while Biolchini stopped Hal Schmitt in the second round of their fight. 
Neither fighter can be ac­cused of intimidating the com­petition with psyche talk.

Irish clearing attempt and slapped the puck between Mad­son's legs from the left wingboards. 
The Broncos wasted little time once the second period was underway. At 1:25, Mike Ross skated in from the point and fed an uncovered Shane Redshaw to the left of Madson. Redshaw waited and waited until he beat a helpless Madson with a wrist shot off the post on the short side. 
A determined effort by Kuehl lead to Zadra's second goal of the game for the Irish. The junior winger's first shot hit the post. Following up on the play, his second shot was saved by Laurie only to have Zadra poke in the rebound.

Somewhere in Oklahoma there is a nine-year old kid scratching his head. 
Before another slap in the face to the University of Oklahoma football team last week, this little tyke was happy existing in a world of Pee Wee's Playhouse and dodgeball. 
That changed with Charles Thompson last week. 
Thanks to the Sooners' quarterback, third­graders were being quoted across the nation, telling the adult world that kids didn't know who to trust anymore. 
This is the sad result of one man saying one thing­-to the most believing, trusting ears iln the world--and then doing the exact opposite. 
Thompson was telling children to say no to drugs. A wonderful message from someone who held a lot of clout with Oklahomans--a Sooner football player. Then he turned around and not only was found to use drugs but to sell them as well. 
This is not the first time that role models have let down their adoring fans. Ben Johnson did it in Seoul; so did super-goalies Jim Craig and Pelle Lindbergh when they got behind the! wheel of a car after drinking. 
I remember standing in line for 45 minutes to get Carl Yastrzemski's autograph at the impres­sionable age of 11. I stepped up to the table to the sight of a future Hall-of-Farner lighting up a ciga­rette. It was hard to take that my hero was not perfect.

Charles Thompson is not perfect, and not even that famous. That doesn't really matter, though. 
What matters is that there was a person who was in position to be a positive influence on the minds of the future. Instead, he blew it. 
Sports play a major role in our society. Through the world of sports we can live out our competitive dreams--either as participants or fans. 
We tend to make heroes out of athletes. Twelve­year-old kids fight over who gets to be Magic Johnson in a pickup basketball game. Hundreds of Irish fans, young and old alike, wait up to an hour outside of Notre Dame's locker rooms to catch a glimpse or an autograph from Irish football and basketball players. And my grandmother, rest her soul, could name the Boston Red Sox starting lineup nearly to the day she died. 
In a world too often ravaged by violence, preju­dice, and poverty, finding heroes is a healthy way of keeping a positive perspective about our lives. 
Athletes are an obvious target of hero-worship and have been since the days of Babe Ruth and Knute Rockne. Given the right combination of tal­ent, luck and charm, athletes are in a prime position to feel the shining glory of the spotlight. 
That same spotlight can burn, though, as Charles Thompson learned last week. Unfortunately, he burned a lot of people with him--those who had been drawn close to him through his football deeds or otherwise. 
The warning to athletes as a result of last week's tragedy is out: You're on a pedestal, like it or not. You are being watched. So while you're up there, do whatever good you can. But don't mess up. There will always be a nine-year old kid ready to put his complete faith in your every word.
