Two St. Mary's students were raped last night-by a single, unidentified assailant brandishing a gun. 
According to James Roemer, Notre Dame dean of students, the two had just crossed State Road 31 at the light at St. Mary's Rd. at about 10 p.m. on their way to the Notre Dame campus. A car pulled over . on the highway and a man, carrying a gun, got out. Roemer said the assailant chased the women down the wooded path leading to the Notre Dame campus where he raped them. 
After the incident, the two students made their way to a Notre Dame men's residence hall, Roemer said. A friend then accompanied the two women to the Notre Dame Security Office. 
At Security, one of the victims requested to call her parents. Roemer said that the two were then taken by Security to the St. Joseph's Hospital Emergency Room. 
Kathleen Rice, St. M~_UY's dean of students, stated that the victims were raped, but emphasized that they were not otherwise physically harmed. She noted that, at the hospital, they were "under­standably shaken up." 
Rice said the students gave a good description of the rapist. Roemer added that a description of the attacker's car was out "within 12 to 15 minutes" after the rape was reported to Security. 
As of 1 a.m. today, a suspect had not been apprehended, Rice said. 
Roemer added that after the man raped the women, "he commented something about driving back to St. Joe, Michigan." The man may have been trying to throw investigators off, Roemer noted. 
A spokesman for the St. Joseph's County Police Department said that the investiga­tion has been handed over to Notre Dame Security. St. Mary's Security had no comment to make about the rape. 
At St. Joseph's Hospital with the students last night were Roemer, Rice, representatives from St. Mary's Health Services, representatives from Notre Dame and St. Mary's Security, and Bro. Just Paczesny, vice-president of Student Affairs. 
''They were walking down the lane toward Notre Dame which we've been telling people notto do," Rice said. "Even though they were in two's, it didn't help."

Police investigate WSND thefts 
by Frank JLaurino 

St. Joseph County Police will 
start an investigation into the 
recent WSND equipment theft, 
Station Manager Peter Goerner 
announced yesterday. The polic·e 
investigation was requested by 
Dean of Students James A. 
Roemer. 
According to Goerner, the 

recommendation stemmed from a 
Nov. 3 meeting between Roemer 
and WSND Sports Director Ted 
Robinson. That meeting specif­
ically dealt with the Oct. 28 theft in 
which approximately $1650 in elec­
tronic equipment was reported 
stolen from the station's production 
studio. Roemer determined that a 
police investigation was necessary. 

"We're letting Dean Roemer· have this case," said Goerner. "When the police come in, they'll! lbe able to take fingerprints in the' production studio." 
The studio has been locked since: · the discovery of the theft. According to Goerner, "nothing has been touched." 
Goerner stated that an unidenti­fied male was reported to have been seen in the station the night of" the robbet:y. Two staff members who were working that night will be asked to aid police in making a composite drawing of the suspect, explained Goerner. 
''Roemer will allow the staff members to look through the Rolodex file of student J.D. pictures as well," added Robinson. "The Dean has been very cooperative." 
In addition, photographs of tht:: stolen equipment will be distribtJI ted to maids and janitors. "Hope·· fully we'll be able to track down tht:: culprit and turn him over to tht:: proper authorities," said Roemer. 
In an emergency meeting follow·· ing the robbery, WSND depart··

Tickets for the November 18 Notre Dame basketball game with the Russian National squad wm be available to students starting today. The sales will be open to students only until Saturday, November 12. The cost will be $2 for lower arena and $1.50 for bleachers. 
Each student may present only his ID for a ticket. The tickets are available at the Gate 10 box office.

ment heads resolved to increase station security. According to Goerner, identification cards will soon be issued to all station personnel. "If someone doesn't have an J.D. card, they don't get past the door," he said. 
"Director of Production Engin­eering, John Foster is seriously looking into electronic security measures," added Goerner. "Our only problem, of course, is the cost." 
Robinson feels the Detex system provides the best security for the station. ''With the Detex, only station personnel can get inside the studio," he said. 
Goerner finds "no reason to believe a staff member is involved at the present time." However, the station manager added, "as far as we can see, there are no answers." 
"It's got to stop," said Robin­son. "We're losing too much equipment." 
Roemer explained that if any suspects are apprehended, the University will have "no course but to turn the individual over to the proper authorities for criminal prosecution." He added that if a student is involved, the individual will be "most probably separated from the Notre Dame community." 
"This is a very serious felony," said Roemer. "Hopefully we'll track down this criminal."

Why Do They Die? 
iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii~~iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii~~iiiiiiiiiiii~iiiiiiiiiiiiiii david cwik 
It was reported recently that three million unborn children were aborted in the United States last year. Three million. 
Amidst a flurry of self-congratu­lation it was reported on Oct. 10 that our Student Government would allocate $500 to the ND Right to Life group. Student Government officials at that time were quoted as saying: "Being a Catholic school, we should stand up for Christian principles. And though this will not be a popular decision, . . . we feel that it needs to be made." 
On Oct. 17, the Student Govern­ment stopped the money. 
The grant was rescinded because one student appealed the alloca­tion. The student reportedly said the allocation was an injustice to students. He said that the grant only presented one side, and asked, "Does the worth of any groups' goal justify it being the only group heard?" The student concluded, "Basically, the best thing to do is to keep public funds out of anything like this. But if you have to fund some group, it's incumbent to fund both sides." 
And it was reported that three million unborn children were killed in our abortion mills last year. Three million. 
In the summer of 1971 in a parking lot on the West Side of Chicago a friend of mine died. The two of us had belonged to a gang, like most kids from the West Side. And like most kids from there we got into gang fights. Most of the time they were just words and fists. 
But sometimes they were worse. In the last one, my friend died. 
I saw him die. Some who were there also saw him die. As he lay there in the parking lot, some there cried. Others just stood and stared. 
A few ran. All knew this death shouldn't have happened. All knew we had, somehow, lost something precious. And all who were there recognized their own frail humanity. Their own wretchedness. 
But when we hear of the number of abortions performed each year many of us do not cry. Many of us don't believe that their deaths shouldn't have happened. Many of us don't feel as though we have, somehow, lost something precious. 

And many of us don't recognize that their deaths were caused by our own wretchedness. 
We don't cry because we now disregard the sanctitiy of life. We will now even sacrifice the unborn for our comfort and convenience. We now talk about "funding both sides." 
And it was reported that there were three million unborn children killed in the abortion mills last year. Three million. 
I am told that there now be a fund drive for the ND Right to Life group. I will give to this fund drive. Unfortunately, it will not be very much. 
It does not matter that we may give materially only a little. What matters is why we are doing this. We are doing this to demonstrate that we have convinced ourselves that, like the killing of my friend, the killing of unborn children is wrong. Heartlessly wrong. That like the souls of those who saw my friend die, we are praying "Forgive us." That our hearts, like the hearts of those who saw my friend die, are crying out: "No more." 
No more. 





P.O. BOX Q 
N.D. 
overrated 
Dear Editor: 
I am deeply disturbed when I read or hear descriptions of Notre Dame such as that given by a subway alumnus in his letter concerning the USC game (The Observer, ll/4). Generalities such as "Notre Dame always stood for class" and "only at Notre Dame do the athletes attend class and ... find themselves subject to unbending disciplinary procedures". are at the very least questionable. But the searcy thing is not so much that some outsiders believe in this "pure image," but that so many here at Notre Dame are being misled.· 
Judgments of duLac approaching infallibility or perfection are unfounded. Too often we judge ourselves by the ideals we stand for and not by our actions. To cause hundreds of dollars worth of dam­age by throwing rocks is not class! Too often we generalize overall excellence from a specific quality. A great football team does not mean a great university! We must be careful where we set our priorities. Do we wish to judge ourselves in terms of character or as great fans? 
A great injustice is done to this . university by the administration in their endeavor to present Notre Dame as something it isn't. In attempting to maintain a pure image we often overestimate our­selves, resulting in a failure to recognize faults that do exist. In addition, worrying about our image is a major hinderance to the resolution of many problems. The groundskeeper issue has been unnecessarily complicated by the administration's overconcern with tarnishing our image. We must realize both our virtues and our shortcomings and deal with them honestly before we will begin to deserve the praise we have 
received. Bob EIUs 
Uniust criticism 
Dear Editor: 
I would like to reply to the comments made by Amy Hartzell, St. Mary's Sports Commissioner, criticizing The Observer's coverage of athletics at St. Mary's. 
I am currently women's sports editor for both the Notre Dame and St. Mary's campuses. Upon assuming this position last April, I promptly ran an ad on the sports page seeking people who would be interested and willing to cover women's sports, either Notre Dame's or St. Mary's. Response to this ad was nonexistent. 
Early this year, I repeated this same request. In addition, I put in a special plea at a St. Mary's staff meeting. I was especially interest­ed in having someone covering that campus for I realized how difficult it could be to keep abreast of all the functions going on in the athletic department there, and I did not want to slight any one group. 
The results of these efforts proved a bit more fruitful for I came up with the names of four people who had expressed a desire to write. However, upon contacting these four, I found that they either preferred to cover men's sports or would not give me a firm committ­ment to cover women's. 
I, too, am interested in having adequate coverage of St. Mary's sports. As an athlete, I know the importance of recognition for one's time and effort. But athletics have also taught me the importance of cooperation. I do not claim omniscience and therefore will again extend a request for writers. If there is anyone who wishes to cover women's sports on a depen­dable basis, please notify me. Or, if you know of an event deserving recognition in the paper, make sure the results of this event reach me. I have a staff box in The Observer office for this exact purpose. 
I do wish Ms. Hartzell had talked to me before making such com­ments. The Observer is a joint ND-SMC publication and therefore warrants participation from both sides. Until I see some real, committed interest coming from St. Mary's, I cannot find justification for Ms. Hartzell's criticism.

What next? 
Dear Editor: 
This letter IS m regard to the article on basketball tickets in Monday's paper. It is addressed to Ticket Manager Mike Busick, or 
.commentary 


Please, Let Us Know 
jean pow/ey 
Editor's Note: The following commentary Is based on a letter sent · by Jean Powley to every member of the SMC Board of Governance  The Observer editorial board endorses the comments of Its St. Mary's Editor. 
As St. Mary's Editor of The Observer, I feel I must respond to your complain.ts about t.ack of St. Mary's coverage in the paper. 
Let me begm by saymg that I agree wholeheartedly with your indignation over the senior trip article in Thursday's paper. The fact that no St. Mary's seniors were interviewed was a gross oversight that I cannot excuse. I have since spoken to my Notre Dame counterparts about it and we have decided that from now on they will read each day's Notre Dame story sheet to me over th; phone and if a story should apply to both campuses, I will give them the name of a St. Mary's person to contact. In addition, I plan to attend their next reporter's meeting to speak to the individual reporters about including St. Mary's in their articles. 
Another of your complaints, regarding the specification of SMC activities but not labeling ND activities, is also a valid point. In the future, we hope to rectify this, too. I will alert all copyreaders and reporters about this change. 
Your other grievances, however, I cannot agree with. In the 21 issues published since Sept. 30, 65 St. Mary's stories have appeared. That is an average of three every day. Granted, Notre Dame has a lot more than that, but there are two reasons for this. First, like it or not, ND is a much larger school with more activities. The second reason, however, is that St. Mary's Student Government does not actively seek publication as Notre Dame does. 
The example of the United Way campaign was given. ND campaign directors contacted The Observer with information every day -so they had many articles and graphs published. At SMC, however, no one from the campaign ever contacted me. All articles we ran were from chasing the directors around campus and making numerous phone calls. 
It is not humanly possible for me to keep abreast of every committee's, class' and dorm's activities. Whenever someone ~omes to me with a story request or idea, I go out of my way to put it m the paper. If you let me know, I'll do it. Just let me know what you're doing! We can't cover what we don't know about. 
Finally, complaints that SMC stories repeatedly get stuck in the back of the paper simply aren't true. Since September 30, eleven SMC stories have appeared on page one, nine on page two and eleven on page three. Almost half of the SMC stories appeared on the first three pages. That's abetter track record than ND has! The other articles were spread throughout the paper -with comparatively few on the back pages. 
Please understand that we are all students, who cannot spend every waking minute at The Observer. Instead of criticizing us, please work with us to give St. Mary's the coverage it deserves.

Gazelle 
Brigid Rafferty 

..I am a gazelle ... I can fly like a bird in the sky ... I am so perfect, so divine, so ethereal, so surreal I cannot be compre­hended except by my permission." 
Anyone flaunting a self-image like that might be sloughed off as a rambling egotist, but when actress Cicely Tyson recited these extravagant lines from a Nikki Giovanni poem last night, no one thought she was a bit pretentious: Her enormous dramatic talent revealed that she can very well be whoever she wishes. And right now she is the most prominent Black actress of our time. 
Walking briskly onto the stage of O'Laughlin Auditorium twenty minutes after she was scheduled to, the star of Sounder, Roots, and The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman flashed a wide, toothy smile to her audience and explained that her plane from LaGuardia Airport had been delayed. She brought no props to assist her in the dramatic readings which were to follow, and her clothes and makeup were simple and understated. 
Before launching into the readings of poetry which she had selected, Tyson devoted the first half of her program to a question-and-answer session, in which the many sides of her personality appeared. "If I wait until the end of the readings to entertain questions, I usually never get away," she told her listeners. She grinned slyly and continued, "So, I thought I'd get a little slick. I do my questions, then my readings, and then I spOt!" Her first show of humor was a surprise to the audience, which surprisingly, filled only half of the auditorium, but was repeated soon when she told photographers that they would have exactly five seconds to take pictures of her. 
"Alright," she smiled, "ready, set, go!" After giving the go-ahead, she proceeded to gracefully pose her slender figure ("I haven't eaten in three days--1 fast!") in melodramatic Garbo poses, and to make silly faces. The audience loved it. On stage, she was completely relaxed, and radiated her feelings of contentment with self to her audience. 
A sense of being at ease with herself was indicated by the skillful manner in which she handled the barrage of questions which followed her invitation to "ask me anything you want!" 
Her answers covered topics from the length of time she spent in being made-up for her role as a 110-year-old woman in Jane Pittman (six hours per day) to her strong feelings onthe presentation of Black culture in the film world: 
''One of my main concerns in the last five years has been getting Black actors and actresses out of their stereotypes, like "Oeopatra Jones" and "Superfly" types. People don't know anything about "other" 
Black  people,  or  that  we  have  made  
contributions to  the wor ld.  One of the  
things  I  tried  to  show  as  Rebecca  in  

SoiiDder was that Black women do have love--for their husbands,· friends, and family. If Black actors demanded better roles, and held out for them, Hollywood would write better roles!" Her quiet statement, "If we stopped paying five dollars to see "Blacksploitation" films, they would stop making them," drew a round of applause. 
Tyson gave thoughtful answers to most of her questions, often gesturing expres­sively. She alluded a few times to her great amount of "nervous energy". She spoke of her own evolution as an actress which, she admits with a big smile, "is still a source of amazement to me! But that's what's so marvelous about life--you don't know what you can do until you're put to the task. I was paralyzed for four solid . days after finding out that I had received the role as Jane Pittman. I couldn't believe that I had the nerve to think that I could do the role!" 
Tyson, who studied acting in her hometown New York City after deciding that "I'm sure God didn't put me on the face of this earth to bang on a typewriter fo 
the rest of my life,'' told her audience that she thinks of characters as ".second skin. When the skin doesn't fit, I know the part's not for me. My method deals more with absorption than just memorizng, as most actors do. When I do a role, I spend a great deal of time researching it. For a film in which I play Harriet Tubman, I went to her h home and talked to two of her descendents. 
The woman's life was just incredible." Het expressive face lightened into a reflective smile. · 
Tyson admitted that her research with the aged for the role of Jane Pittman has given her a deep feeling for older people. "They are our historians. I feel very conscious of getting the knowledge they have while they are here." Her reflective tone of voice became more direct as she advised the audience, "Get their know­ledge now, while they're here." 
Still, Tyson also showed a deep appreci­ation and fondness for youth. When one front-row spectator introduced his two adolescent daughters to the actress and asked for "a message for young black women," Tyson smiled nostalgically, "Stay that age." 
Tyson enthusiastically answered a ques­tion about the value of being an actress. "Itis the ability to express whatever I feel, to have an outlet. So often," she said in a hushed voice, "we have a tendency to say what we mean in the way we say it, rather than what we say. When I act, my emotions come through." When asked what was most difficult about being an actress, however, Tyson responded, "I can't answer that," and tactfully changed the subject. . 
During the question period, Tyson exhibited a bright, perceptive nature in her well-thought-on awareness of the contem­porary Black situation in America and her emphasis on revealing tru Black lifestyles ­and history. But her wide-eyed facial expressions, sense of humor, and casual, vivacious interaction with the audience also showed a warm, sensitive personality behind the widely-admired actress. 
At one point during the questions, when an infant in the back of the auditorium began to wail, Cicely put up her hands, assumed a fascinated expression, and asked, in awe, "Is there a baby in the house?" She turned the attention of the audience to a five-month-old girl when she urged her mother to bring her on stage. Cicely held the baby, coddled her, chanted to her, and appeared delighted to have a baby in her arms. The audience reacted with a loud chorus of "Awwww"s. 
The depth of Tyson's personality which she showed in her "interview session" reinforced the tremendous emotion she· displayed in her readings of poetry by Langston Hughes, Giovanni, and others which she selected by paging through a scrapbook on the podium in front of her. Occasionally she would scan a poem to herself, smile, but shake her head and choose a different reading . She confessed that she does write herself, but doesn't read any of her own poems. 
In onw poem, in which a Black woman imagines a chance to "dance and whirl, when the day is done," and "running space" for her son, Ciceyly's serious stare relaxed into a dreaming, placid expression. 
The effect was almost heartbreaking: experiencing the innocent wishes of a Black mother who would be so content with what, to others, would seem so little, and realizing that even this might be too much for her to expect. 
Although many of Tyson's readings dealt with the nature of racial prejudice and injustice, several were also presented which were humorous and light-hearted. All contained the same elements of force and strength in total identification with the speakerofthepoem, however, as shown in one very short verse. 
As Cicely was browsing through her scapbook midway through the readings, a devilish grin suddenly perked up her face and she raised her eyes to the audience. She proceeded to read, "In an envelope marked 'personal', God wrote me a letter; in a letter marked 'God', I wrote him back.'' She smirked as the audience laughed, then confided in a husky tone, "I wasn't sure if I could do that or not!" 
She recited some nonsensical poetry, 
and used trilled accentes, affected tones, 
and exaggerated faces to match their sing-song qualities, as evidenced in one simple poem: "Sometimes I feel like I neeeeever stop . . . 'till one day I reach out ·and touch a handful of stars . . . and then I look over and say to God, 'How 'bout that'?" 
Tyson's great ability to maneuver dra­matic switches in mood and tone of her readings reached its peak in her most moving reading, which traced a small Black girl's first exposure to hostile racism. As the young girl about to embark on her first day of school, Tyson spoke with naive, innocent excitement of getting ready for school. Her tone shifted to one of confused sadness, and feelings of being lost when she nears her school and sees that white people are barring her entrance to it. When a lady who looks friendly spit~/ on her, the little girls' voice increases jn rhythm, reflecting fear; it increases 1to panic as she runs away, trying to reach a bench where she. hopes she will be safe. 

Finally, she reaches her mother. at the school where her mother teaches--by now, her voice is trembling and nears breaking s as she tries to understand the ways of the · world which her mother has known all along. 
Cicely Tyson, ghetto-child-turned-star, refuses to accept any film roles which will detract from her proud identity as a Black woman. Her identity is an essential part of her, as well as a major factor in her talent as a dramatist--she has both insight, from her own experiences and perceptive aware­ness of true human nature, and profes­sional polish to convey this human emotion in its true essence, while maintaining a degree of dignity and control over the character. The chance to experience "An Evening with Cicely Tyson" can almost lead one to believe that she is "so ethereal, so surreal"--but her messages are ones which all persons can comprehend. 


With Every Performance,Another Memory 
Greg Solman 

It is perhaps ironic that Bob Hope, as he travels the globe, bringing with him the excitement that accompanies legends, should sing to his audiences, "Thanks for the memories." Certainly, it is those that see him, like the nearly 8,000 that were entertained at the ACC last Friday night, that are left with fond memories of an

""'"-""''" 
As the evening took its course, Hope's reportoire of repartee left hardly a stone unturned in his attempt to satirize the world around him. Among the items on the list of fair game on this particular occasion: 
ldi Amin, flying on airplanes, government and politics, Catholicism, bars and drink­ing, and polish people. Even homo­sexuality was ribbed until one had to wonder how Hope has managed to avoid having his own Bryant-like contingent of gay protesters at each performance ... but hehas marraged, perhaps by his institution of Joey Heatherton, who has been known to attract more than her fair share of adamant heterosexuals. 
Being at Notre Dame, Hope could not avoid making a few cracks about the institution. Hope has a long-standing relationship with the school, dating back to

"He turned to me after the fifth shank,"

Krause maintains that Hope has always

that he loves the spirit and enthusiasm that

Aerial attack takes off under Toman 
by Tony Pace Sports Writer 

49, 43 and 69. Those are the point totals which the Notre Dame offense hasaccumulated in their past three games. One of the men whose responsible for these offen­sive fireworks is assistant coach Ron Toman. 
Toman, who is now in his second. season at Notre Dame, is in charge of the quarterbacks and the re­ceivers. In a sense, he is the man responsible for the Irish passing attaack, an attack which has flour­ished in recent weeks. 
"We are very pleased with the way our whole offense, and our passing in particular, has devel­oped," said Toman. "We have moved from just the basic plays which we used during the first few weeks of the season to a more intri­cate offense. We have added a play ~~ two to our offense each week. 
This evolution of the offensive strategy, coupled with the develop­ment of individual players, has given the Notre Dame offense a more wide open look. "In some respects, " Toman noted, "one might say that we have opened up the.offensea little more. However, I think we are taking better advantage of the people who are on our offensive team. We are now using Joe Montana and our re­ceivers as we have always wanted to." 
The present quarterback sit­uation, to use Toman's own words, "is set pretty good." Montana, Rusty Lisch and Tim Koegel all have the size, speed, throwing ability and football knowledge which Toman feels is necessary to become solid signal callers. 
Toman also added the intangible quality of leadership to the repe­toire of a successful quarterback. He said, "Joe, Rusty, and Tim can all throw the football, it is just a matter of who can take the offen­sive unit by the horns and make the club move. These type of things are just something which you often fall into and I am very pleased with the way the team has rallied." 
One player whose development has contributed significantly to the production of the offense is wide receiver Kris Haines. The junior

The Irish Eye 
Clemson A waits 
The Notre Dame football team makes a return visit to the Deep South 
this Saturday to tackle Clemson. The Tigers have logged a 7-1-1 record 
thus far through their 1977 campaign. After losing their first outting 
against Maryland, 21-14, Clemson went on to win seven straight games. 
Then, last Saturday the Tigers had to settle for a tie with North 
Carolina. Obed Ariri handles the kicking chores for the Tigers. Until last 
weekend's game with the Tarheels, the Nigerian place kicker had hit on 17 
of 17 extra points. After Oemson's second touchdown against North 
Carolina, Ariri's point after total dropped below the 100 percent level. 
Because the extra point specialist missed his one-point try, the Tigers 
ended up tying the Tarheels, 13-13. 
However, Ariri was not the only one to aid Clemson in leaving Chapel 
Hill with a tie. The Tigers' punter funbled the snap from center at the five 
yard line to set up North Carolina's opening field goal. Aside from that 
error, the Tigers' gave the Tarheels another chance later in the contest. 
Oemson had driven down to the North Carolina 19 yard line and was 
moving well enough to score. At least they were in position for a field 
goal. But, the Tigers fumbled and the Tarheels proceeded to drive down 
the field into field goal range and kicked the tying three-pointer with just 
over a minute to play that ended the scoring at 13-13. 
So, Clemson had plenty of opportunities to capture their eight straight 
victory, but fell just short of that goal, even with all of their crucial 
mistakes. Maybe the Clemson gridders were anticipating the invasion of 
the Fighting Irish on Saturday. 

Clemson's stadium holds 43,451. All of those seats were sold out on 
September 2, the first game to sell out for the Tigers. Since that capacity 
was reached, the Tigers added 9,000 endzone seats for Saturday's clash. 
Thus, with 52,451 fans, over 11,000 of them being students, one can 
expect the atmosphere to be less than friendly. 
Because of last weekend's tie, Clemson dropped from thirteenth to 
fifteenth in the AP wire service poll. Meanwhile, the Irish, while still 
maintaining the fifth position, gained a lot of ground on number-four 
ranked Ohio State. 

Last week, the Irish trailed the Buckeyes by 216 points. This week, 
however, Notre Dame trails Ohio State by 110 points with 798 total 
markers, compared to 908 for the Buckeyes. Notre Dame also extended 
their margin over Michigan from 60 points to 110. 
The Irish have played extremely well in their last three contests. 
However, all of these battles have been at home. How well the Green 
Machine fairs on the road will be thoroughly tested in Greenville, South 
Carolina. The Tigers are ready for this game and have been waiting for it 
all season. 

Clemson Sports Information Director, Bob Bradley, was quoted in the 
November 8 Chicago Tribune as saying, "Everyone gets keyed up about 
playing Notre Dame, and th~ intensity has mounted because no expected 
our team to be 7-1-1 at this point." 
Well, the Tigers have a new coach this year by the name ofCharlie Pell. 
Pell has certainly turned last year's 3-6-2 squad completely around. This 
team has built up a tremendous amount of confidence over their last eight 
games and is ready todisplay its talents against the number-five ranked 
Irish. With a win over Notre Dame, the Tigers could receive a lot of 
national recognition. 

Notre Dame has proven that th..::y have the makings of a top-ranked 
team. However, each and every week, the Irish must continue to prove 
that they deserve the top spot. 

Clemson will be giving their all to prevent the Irish ffom leaving Greenville with a victory. Notre Dame's record in the South has not been overwhelming. Mississippi already gave the South one victory, this is not the time for number two. 
The Tigers have played one common Irish opponent, that teambeing Georgia Tech. Clemson soundly defeated the Ramblin' Wreck, 31-14 in Atlanta. The Irish should remember how difficult a time they had last year in Georgia. It's very hard to compare scores between different teams at different locations. However, one thing is for certain, Clemson did not attain their record by just putting on their uniforms. 
The Tigers boast a very stingy defense and the Irish must continue to vary their offense and use some wide open play selection. The confederate flags will be waving, so, the Irish better be ready for a challenge when they go to Greenville. 
The game will be difficult, especially since it's in the Tigers home arena. The Irish have the potential, but Clemson will not make it easy. If the Notre Dame gridders play like they have been the last few weeks, they can emerge victorious. But, they must do just that; play this game like they tiiV.e since :October )2 ll,nd not-just live on their past three performances; bceause Clemson will certainly be emotionally high and ready to play. 

AP-Texas, Alabama, Oklahoma, Colgate, Ohio State, Notre Dame and Michigan. 
Tiny Colgate might sound and look funny nestled among college football's elite teams, but the Red Raiders of the Chenango Valley are there-courtesy of the 9-0 record and their position as the No. 20 team in The Associated Press' poll. 
The little school in Hamilton, 
N.Y. with an enrollment of 2,500 gained entrance into the AP rank­ings for the first time ever, receiving eight points in the nation­wide balloting of sports writers and broadcasters. 
A more established football pow­erhouse, Texas, 8-0, must get by Texas Christian, Baylor and Texas A&M to remain undefeated. The 
Women~s &~ball······ 
Of course, the major cog in the Irish pasing attack is All-American tight end Ken MacAfee. The senior from Brockton, Mass­achusetts now has 42 receptions for the season and he is being men­tioned as a factor in the voting for the Heisman Trophy. "I don't think I can say anything about Ken which hasn't already been said," Toman indicated. "When I first came here, I detected a slight flaw in the way he postioned his hands as he was preparing to receive the ball. However, as I was going over to speak to him about it, a ball was thrown in his direction; he reached behind him, with only one hand, and made a catch which he by no means should have been able to make. I stopped in my tracks because he has some of those God­given abilities which a coach just can't teach." 
MacAfee's presence helps the offense not only because of his abilities, but also because of the defensive attention which he attracts. ''Because many teams are putting more than one man on Ken, other things open up for the rest ofthe offense. And, even with this coverage, he manages to get free." 
Although bowl speculation has been rampant during the recent days, Toman prefers to take one game at a time. He is particularly concerned with this week's Oemson encounter. "We have our hands full this week withOemson," 
said Toman, "they are really a good football team. We'll be concerned with the bowl game after the regular schedule is finished." 
speedster had his best game ever against Georgia Tech with four receptions for 73 yeards, including a 19 yard touchdown. 
"I am very pleased with Kris," said Toman. "In the past, his high suit has been blocking, but he worked very hard over the summer on his concentration and on his pass routes and it has shown this season. He is runing excellent routes and that was most evident last Saturday." 
Behind Haines at the wide receiver post are two sophomores, Ty Dickerson and Speedy Hart. Toman expects both Dickerson and Hart to play a lot of football for the Irish in the next few years. "For a young player to come in from high school and do well right away as a receiver, he must know how to read the different pass coverages and how to adjust his pass patterns to those coverages. Our younger players are now learning this and they are starting to pick it up.

make an ideal designated hitter for the Rangers and he must be looking 
ahead to hitting in Texas Stadium. Texas needed a productive power 
hitter and although the terms of the signing have not been released, I 
would bet that Zisk is about as rich as Reggie Jackson is right now. Who's 
Larry Hisle? 
Rumor: Tom Heinsohn's job on the line. The Boston Celtics can not seem to win a basketball game. So who gets the blame? Why, the coach of course. Never mind that Heinsohn has been one of the more succesful NBA coaches in recent years. NBA Owners and general managers have short memories. In this case, Red Auerback has always hovered like an old mother hen over Coach Heinsohn, watching his every move. Joe Hall of Kentucky knows the feeling. There have been reports that the Sidney Wicks holdout has caused dissension but the sloppy play of Dave Cowens and the injury to Jo Jo White have not helped matters any. And for the last time, .John Havliceck is not washed up. He's been playing as well as he's ever played in the last three years. But, NBA coaches are c:xpendable. Just ask Gene Shue. 
Observation: Right now, the Notre Dame football team is the best college team in the United States. Now for a look at Notre Dame football. . .49-l9 .. .43-10 ...69-l4. So what's Ole Miss done lately? Who 
ares? What's Texas done lately? I'd have to say that we care because we 
c1ight be seeing them sometime in January. When you think about it, Coach Dan Devine has molded a powerhouse as was expected by thf! prognosticators last summer. He inherited a team that had been decimated by graduating players three years ago and has gathered such a bevy of talent under him, that it's no wonder that the Irish are winning big now. It is a case of a sound coach with a sound coaching philosophy with a sound group of players. 
Lament: I was really sorry to see Monte Towe dropped by the Denver Nuggets. He was only 5'6" but an exciting player at that who just couldn't quite cut it in the NBA. Besides, it was like seeing my name as being the one dropped by the Nuggets and not some N.C.State alumnus. No, my first name isn't really Monte(it's Mike) and my last name isn't pronounced "towel," it's more like "toll." But even though I've never
