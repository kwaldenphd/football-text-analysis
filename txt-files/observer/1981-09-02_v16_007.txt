PSC panel decides Bailly's money-woes 
INDIANAPOUS (AP)-Investors 
may or may not be immediately. 
heartened by Northern Indiana 
Public Service Co.'s decision to 
scrap its Bailly nuclear power plant, 
but the crucial decision will be 
made by the Indiana Public Service 
Commission, industry analysts say. 
Tht.· utility announced last week it 
was abandoning the project, only I 
percent complete almost I I years 
after NIPSCO sought federal permis­
sion to build the 644-megawatt 
plant on the shore of Lake Michigan 
near Chesterton. 
Edmund A. Schroer, NIPSCO board chairman, said the utility spent about J20S million on the plant and would seck a rate incrC!asc to recover those expenditures. 
Estimated construction costs for the much delayed project had skyrocked from JIBS million to JI.8 billion. 
Because of those escalating costs, NIPSCO's move "was a good cconomiic decision at this point, but it all depends on whether the PSC and the courts, if they become In­volved, support the write-oft" through the rate structure, said An­thony D. Osbon, vice president and utility analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin, Jenrette. 
As other analysts, Osbon indi­cated he expects the PSC to support NIPSCO. "Indiana traditionally has been, a.o; far as regulation goes, a pret­ty reasonable state," he said. 
NIPSCO ha.'> not yet determined 
when it will file a rate request or for 
how much, a spokesman said Mon­
day. But when it does, consumer 
groups arc expected to argue 
strcnously that NIPSCO sharehol­
ders should bear the burden, not the 
consumers. 
"In many ways when it comes 
before the comm1ss1on, this case 
wiU break new ground in Indiana," 
said Commissioner William B. 
Powers. He predicted it may be a 
year or more before NIPSCO files its 
request. 
As for what the demise of Bailly 
means to NIPSCO stock and its costs 
of capital, early returns are mixed. 
The utility's common stock, trading 
at between JI0 and Jl 3 a share over 
the past year and just over Jll most 
of the summer on the New York 
Stock Exchange, closed at II 3/4, up 
a quarter, last Thursday, the day after 
Schroer's announcement. 
It rose another quarter Friday but 
dropped back to I 1 
Monday. 
"Clearing up the questions of whether they would build Bailly would in the longer term have a positive effect," said Arlene Barnes, vice president of research at First Boston Corp. 
Evan ). Silverstein, electric utility analyst with LF. Rothchild, Uterberg Towbin, agreed. 
"Investors were concerned the company was committed to a plan for which the costs of completion were virtually unknown," he said. 
Investors are cooling toward utiliies involved in huge construc­tion programs said an analyst at SaJomo Brothers, who asked not to be named. 
Osbon said ilfVestors like the lower cost and faster construction associated with coal-fired plants. He noted that since the accident at Three Mile Island and the dispute over the billion-dollar cleanup bill, "havinga nuclear plant seems to car­ry a great risk." 
Meeting Sunday 
CILA succeeds in community 
By BOB VONDERHEIDE 
News Staff 
It isn't really surprising that CIU., the Community for the lnternatlnaJ Lay Apostolate, Is not very concerned about members becoming apathetic. 
After all, CIU, a community ofstudents working on International issues and community service projects, offers so many ways to get involved that no one person could answer the door everytime CIU knocks with an­other opportunity. 
CILA holds Its first orientation meeting this Sunday at 6:4S p.m. in the Ubrary l.ounge, and all interested stu­dents are invited 
The organization Includes seven committees, with each involved in a different aim and focus. The

tee, for example, works in the South Bend area while the education committee tries to raise students' awareness on social justice issues. 
An Orientation Weekend is already planned for Sep­tember 18-20 at nearby Camp Tamarack. The weekend's primary purpose is to explain CIU, al­though there will be time for personal retlections.,Mon­signor John Egan and Ms. Peggy Roche, both from the Center for Social and Pastoral Ministry, will be guest speakers. The cost is J7.00 and all are welcome. 
Other scheduled events include a spiritual retreat on January 29-30 and an Education Workshop In February on a topic to be chosen later. 
Meanwhile, CILA's Education Committee will start its bi-monthly discussion sessions with the first meeting next Wednesday evening at the Bullashed. The discus­sion group delves into all sorts of political, economic, and social justice Issues. "But not all in one night," laughs Education Co-Chairperson Mary Ann Fenwick. In addition, she said, a faculty member is often invited to speak on a certain topic. 
The CILA Community Service Committee continual­ly provides help to several South Bend projects such as Corvilla House, for mentally handicapped children, Portage Manor, a residential facility for the elderly, and the inner city Justice and Peace Center. Several volun­teers also visit many elderly citizens through the com­mittee's Home Visitation Program. 
CILA's Social Committee plans a Halloween Party, Thanksgiving Dinner and Mass and a Christmas Party. To support these events and other projects, the Fundraising Committee will sponsor a concession stand for a football game and a Christmas card sale. 
Keeping all these groups informed, the Communica­tion Committee sends out a newsletter on CILA's ac­tivities twice a month. 
We pray together, we party together, said Fenwick. We just try to understand what our Christian values ~re all about. 
It's an outreach, said Community Service Chairman Beth Domnick. It's going beyond myself and my sometimes narrow perceptions. It's is so easy to get to­tally involved with school work. CILA helps to get a good perspective (on all the needs in the community). 
Furthermore CILA doesn't stop when school lets out. A Summer Projects Committee sends students to do volunteer work In such places as Appalachia, Tenncsee, Mexico, or Tijuana, while finishing in time for another ~ol year's activj~ies.

HPC approves resolutiOn 
By BOB VONDERHEIDE 
News Staff 
The Hall Presidents Council un­amimously approved last night's resolution calling for classes to start two days after Registration Day. Presently, classes start the day im­mediately after registration. 
Stanford Hall President Dave Loughlin brought the issue up at last week's HPC meeting, and presented the resolution last night. 
"The basic benefit to the stu­
dents," said Loughlin, "would be a 
much more positive attitude toward 
the school year. You're are so rushed 
(that first day). That one day extra 
would make a lot ofdifference." 
In his resolution,· Loughlin states that students don't have enough time to prepare their rooms, clear the hallways, buy books, and become accustomed to their new surroundings. Also, he states, stu­dents presently have little time to change their schedules before classes start. 
HPC will now take the approved resolution before the Student Senate to obtain its support. HPC President Mike Martin said he would also seek approval from the Faculty Senate. If 
all three bodies agree to the resolu­tion, Martin said, the administration would be more likely to approve the suggested change. 
In other HPC action last night: 
Pat Borchers, Housing Commis­sioner for Student Body President Don Murday, asked for an investiga­tion into rumors ofunrepaired dorm damages, for which students were biDed over the summer. 
The Freshmen Orientation Com· mittee asked each hall president to arrange some sort of event for the Freshmen Picnic this Friday from 
4:30 to 7 p.m. 
The HPC will also be looking into the possibility of kegs in hall party rooms. Further action is pending response from haJJ staffs. 
Finally, President Martin read a letter from Father John Van Wolvlear, Vice President for Student Affairs, acknowledging the change instigated by the HPC in the DuLac loft-height policy which now per­mits lofts of up to seven feet In

W alesa,s Solidarity vows social support 
WARSAW, Poland (AP) -Lcch 
Walesa said yesterday the Com­
munist authorities are losing "social 
acceptance." He vowed on 
nationwide TV his Solidarity union 
does not want to take power, but 
assumes responsibility for the na­
tion's fate. 
WaJesa's remarks were broadcast 
by the state-run TV and radio net­
works, in a special program. Talks on 
the media access issue are to resume 
today -the same day printers in 
Rzeszow threaten a strike. 
"If there are problems we should 
sit down and talk," the mustachioed 
union leader said during the 20­
minute program which included the 
union leaders who were less con­ciliatory. "There is no time for stupid polemics, no time for accusing us of 
wan-ting to take over power," Watesa said, "because we don't want power, we want to serve the community." 
The Solidarity TV program came hours after the state-run Polish news agency PAP distributed an interview with WaJesa. 
"Things have now reached a stage 
. when the authorities are losing so­cial acceptance and social support," Walesa was quoted as saying. "This situation forces us to take upon our­selves responsibility for the fate of the nation." 
On the evening radio-TV program, Walesa said: "we don't need the access to radio and televi· sion for polemics. We need it so as to come to an understanding. We want to explain things. We are not con·

arrived Monday in China, said the country has agreed to accept anoth­
er 10,000 Asian refugees. He said only about 1 percent ofthe refugees want to go to a third country. "It is very encouraging that China has such a humane attitude toward the.refugee problem," Hartling said. The commissioner will meet China's top leader Deng Xiaoping and Foreign Minister Huang Hua before visiting refugee resettlement 
areas in Guangxi and Guangdong provinces. -AP 

Nothing beats an understanding. This line effectively captures the current mood of the Frese vs. The Univer­sity ofNotre Dame settlement situation.

A group of 140 women who want to get more females into British politics sailed from Harwich England's east coastport yesterday for a seabound seminar and trip to Denmark to learn the secret of political success there. In Denmark, women hold I 7 percent ofthe parliamentary seats. But in Britain, there are only 19 women members ofParliament, or 2.9 percent ofthe total in the 635­seat House of Commons. Britain's prime minister -Margaret Thatcher -is a woman. The British party, which sailed on the ferry Dana Anglia, belongs to a body called the 300 Group. They are scheduled to meet with the Danish women on today. The 300 Group was formed last November with the eventual aim of getting at least 300 women elened as members of Parliament. -AP

The drill is an annual event in Japan, which has millions of tremors yearly. The 1923 quake killed 140,000 in Tokyo and its environs. The government has said its earthquake safety plan, mandated by law in 1978, would mean no more than 
36.000 deaths and 63,000 injuries during a severe quake. -AP

At there­quest of the Connecticut River Watershed Council of Hanover, N.H., Cousteau pledged just over Sl,OOO a year for 12 years. Thomas Blanchard, a spokesman for the Cousteau Society in Norfolk, Va., said the explorer, who grew up in New York City, learned to dive in Har­vey Lake during his childhood vacations in Vermont. The Vermont Fish and Game Department asked the council to buy seven acres to conserve a brook that runs through the land to Harvey Lake and provides smelt, a major source offood for salmon and trout. -AP 
Black Panther Party leader Huey Newton was ar­rested early yesterday in an Oakland restaurant after he allegedly became drunk, insulted customers and refused to leave, police said. A man identified as Newton's bodyguard, Larry Henson, 32, also was arrested at lvey's Restaurant for allegedly brandishing a firearm and carrying a concealed gun, said Sgt. Donald Cleaves. Cleaves said New­ton, like most prisoners picked up for public drunkenness, would be released after spending four hours in city jail.

Building ownersshould install smoke alarms voluntarily before they are forced to by the Indiana General Assembly, the chair-' 
man ofa study committee on fire safety said Tuesday. 
State Sen. Dan Burton, R-lndianapolis, said the average smoke alarm costs between S25 and S40 and most buildings could be outfitted for less than S2,000. 
"It's my feeling that that's a very small price to pay to protect against smok inhalation." he told reporters at a Statehouse news conference. Burton said the Legislature is likely to pass a law requiring the instal­lation ofsmoke detectors in public buildings. "What I'm saying to building owners is, we would sure appreciate it ifyou would start installing smoke alarms right away," Burton said. Manhattan Fire Chief]ohn T). Fogarty and Los Angeles Fire Chief]ohn 
C. Gerard, who appeared with Burton at the news conference, criticized architects for designing buildings without regard to fire safety. 
"What do architects do for fire safety? They do damn little," Gerard 
said. 
"The major problem we have in the fire community is with ar­
chitects and engineers," Fogarty added. "Consequently, the frre 
service has to live with disaster." 
Gerard said most architects are more concerned with aesthetics, 
building a beautiful structure with elaborate landscaping and plazas 
with no regard to how a hook and ladder truck is supposed to get near 
it in case ofa fire. 
"Architect~ are artists," he said. "They're interested in the feeling of 
the building. They're making a statement for posterity." 
But once a building is built, steps must be taken to make sure it is safe. And~he chiefS say installing smoke detectors is a relatively inex­pensive way to protect lives. -AP

shall offer Ms. Frese a full-time tenured position in the Department of English, retroactive to September J, 1980 and that this offer shall remain open until 15 days following final judicial approval of the settlement agreement. 
Ms. Frese interpreted this claim as indicating that if she accepted the tenure offer within that fifteen-day period, she would resume teaching at Notre Dame on August 25, 1981. 
After written acceptance of the tenure offer, Ms. Frese said that she contracted to buy a house in South Bend, with a closing date of August 28, J981. The mortgage company contacted the University for verification of Ms. Frese's employment, but the Univer­sity refused to verify that Ms. Frese was or would be employed by it. 
Ms. Frese claims that she then told the mortgage com­pany to contact Mr. Lawrence DiNardo, University 

Counsel, indicating that he would be able to verify her employment. She adds that the company later told her that Mr. DiNardo also refused such verification, and that on August 7, Mr. DiNardo directly told her that the defendant University was not going to do anything whatsoever promised in the settlement agreement until at least September 3, or until "all possible appeals have been exhausted." 
On August 9, Ms. Frese reportedly sent a mailgram to President Hesburgh and Provost O'Meara, reminding them of the University's promise to give her a contract upon final jru.licial approval, indicating her accep­tance of that contract, and requesting that the Univer­sity notify her a:s to what classesshe would be teaching. 
To date, Ms. Frese claims that she has received no reply from the President or from the Provost. The Ac­ting Dean of the College, she states, met with her on August 20. He agreed that it was too late for her to

Using bacteria 

Va<:cine discovery may stop flu 
NEW YORK (AP) -A British research t1eam has coaxed bacteria into making a ftu vaccine by tinker­ing with the bacteria's genes, according to a report in the current issue ofthe English scientific journal 
Nature. 

The vaccine is for a type offtu not now causing disease, but the resear­chers said their work "might be the basis for producing a vaccine against a current sltrain" ofinftuenza. 
The amount of flu vaccine being made by the bacteria is only about 10 percent of what the bacteria should eventually be able to make, the researchers said. That yield would have to be increased if the vaccine were to be produced in large quantities, they said. 
Dr. Pete1r Patriarca of the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta said it will probably be at least 10 years before the gene-splicing technique becomes cheaper than conventional means ofproducing vaccines. 
The work, done by Ingeborg Heiland and Mary-Jane Gething of the Imperital Cancer Reseach Fund in London, involved inserting anti­inftuenza ~~enes into the bacteria's genetic m~tterial. 
The technique, known as gene­splicing or genetic _engineering. has been used by others to make inter­feron, a possible anti-cancer weapon, and to make several biological substances that are dif­ficult to obtain by other means. 
A vaccine, an inert form ofa virus, sparks the body to build up its resis­tance to a disease without making the patient sick. 
It has been known that a patient's resistance to inftuenza viruses can be triggered by injecting the patient with a substance called hemag­glutinin, or HA, which is produced by ftu viruses. 
The British researchers isolated the ftu gene that controls the production of HA and inserted it in­to the bacteria's genes. The bacteria then produced HA as a byproduct of their normal growth and reproduc­tion. 
Flu vaccines are now made com­mercially by growing ftu viruses in eggs. The viruses are taken from the eggs, killed, and injected into patients. 
Between 10 and 30 days after the vaccine is given . the patient has built up a strong resistance to the viruses and will usually not get the ftu, or will get only mild case, according to Patriarca at the Centers for Disease ControL

Walesa said Poland's crippled economy and resultant shortages of food and consumer goods play a large part in the Polish crisis. 
"We have plenty on paper but in life we have less and less ... It (the population) has thousands of demands signed and nothing in the shops and life is becoming worse. We are not steering towards con­frontations but we want to dominate this disquiet." 
The union officials said the official media has painted a picture of the Soviet bloc's first independent labor union as one bent on silencing the press, closing the mines, felling the economy and seizing power. 
Garwood may receive backpay 
CHARLOTTTESVILLE, Va. (AP)­An attorney for Robert Garwood, the Marine private convicte~ ofcol­laboratin_g with the eneiny in Viet­nam, said yesterday Garwood could lose the appeal ofhis conviction and still be entitled to his back pay of ! some Sl47,000. 
"He's entitled to be paid," Char­lottesville attorney Lowe said. 
No decision on whether Garwood should get the back pay was made at the hearing at the Army Judge Adv­ocate General's School at the Uni­versity ofVirginia. 
The hearing officer's report will be considered by a Marine Corps review board and the Secretary of 
-the Navy before a final decision is made. 
Lowe said the process would take no less than eight weeks, adding "we're not at this point concerned with the timing ofthis thing." 
Lowe also said a hearing officer has been appointed to review Gar­wood's court-martial appeal, but the outcome of the appeal shouldn't af­fect the request for the back pay. 
"We have made a presentation and cetainly hope everybody along the waywill be as fair as can be ... and that Robert Garwood will obtain juStice," Lowe said 
Asked whether the back pay would be used to pay legal fees, Lowe said Garwood faces "a long course ofmedical rehabilitation that certainly can expect to be very ex­pensive." 
During the hearing. Marine Corps hearing officer Maj. Gary C. Allord submitted 426 pages of questions for Garwood to answer about things that were not clear in the trial record 
Garwood is on leave pending an appeal ofthe conviction and retains his rank and status until the appeal process is exhausted

Library facilities undergo changes 

By MARGARET FOSMOE 
News Staff 

The Notre Dame Memorial Library recently underwent a series of improvements designed to better accomodate students in their use of library facilities, according to Robert Miller, Director ofUniversity Libraries. 
The major improvement, accord­ing to Miller, was the elimination of the College Library on the second floor. Originally intended for under­graduate use, the College Library was incorporated into the Tower Library, located on the fourth to thir­teenth floors. 
Business, Art, and Music were then shifted to the second floor, where additional seating ac­comodates their wide usage. Their former place on the sixth floor

Women continue underpaid 


BACK TO SCHOOL 
WASHINGTON (AP) -Dis­
crimination does not necessarily ac­
count for the prevalent wage 
discrepancies between mc:n and 
women and there is no easy way to 
close the gap, a federal study con­
cluded yesterday. 
Working women continue to be 
paid less than working men 
"because of the subtle ways the job 
market and wage structures con­centrate women in low-paying jobs," said a 96 page report prepared for the Equal Employment Oppor­tunity Commission. 
The special National Research Council study committee that con­ducted the three-year study expressed bewilderment over how to deal with the dilemma of achiev­ing equal pay for equal worth, an issue union leaders say will dominate the labor scene in the 1980s. 
It suggested women may be partly to blame for wage discrepancies be­cause many married women enter tht. job market only temporarily to help make ends meet and then return to the home. 
Nonetheless, the panel said, "Job segregation exists only in part be­cause ofwomen's choices." 
Although the issue ofequal pay for equal value has been bandied about for years, it only recently became a hot item when the American Federa­tion ofState, County and Municipal Employees led women employees of San jose, Calif., on a strike over wage differentials. 
The union succeeded in getting 
the San Jose City Council, on which 
women have a majority, to revise

wage structures to compensate told during public hearings from

Thursday, September rd 

several minor additions were made. The copy machines arc now central­ly located on the second floor of the building. Also, a New Books display Is now present In the second floor foyer. 
The improvements at the library were the result of a year-long 1979­80 study. The study documented facts concerning undergraduate use of and difficulties with the library. These facts were then compiled and improvements were made accord­ingly. 
Miller said that he "anticipates materials will be much easier to find" because of the changes. "Because the materials arc now all together, the lihrary should work much better th;m in the past...which was, after all, the original purpose of the changes." 
The improvements at Memorial 
were completed by the library statf 
over this past summer. By the time 
the changes were complete, the stalf 
had relocated over a quarter ofa mil­
lion books. 
With the improvements now complete, the University plans no further primary changes.

Whither o-c critne? 

Still no ''missile gap'' in '80s 
The headline~ reappeared on The Observer's front page Monday, and those like "Two men rob students of money at gunpoint" doubtless will not be unusual in the coming months. And until the weather gets colder, students living off campus are going to get hit, and hit hard. Horror ~torieS will abound. What can be done? 
Last year was perhaps the worst intenns ofoff-campuscrime,and.tbC parties involved agonized over a solution for months. The cieyof Bend, the local police force, the stude.nts and the University ·· . ·.. fingers in different directions, but little pmgress was made,,Ast}le year begins, we start again at square. one.

On the other hand, there is no Jove lost betwe;en·the Bend and ND students. All students are: in the city for no more than two years, c·CJnstantly 'd¢~~(linirit; a shambles behind. For the most part, this is an unreali$tic Bend would do well to remember that Notre Dame is the largest employer, behind Bendix, and we bring a great deal of this area, whether theY like it or not.

The University could do even more to help, but its hesitancy to money into off-campus housing stems ftom a dearth of im~dia1 available profit. There is not money to be made here~ only !uuneltL«rn r protected.

The "window of vulnerability" is the "missile gap" of the '80s. John 
F. Kennedy campaigned in 1960 on the assertion that President Eisen­hower had allowed the Russians to surpass us in nuclear delivery sys­tems. Once Kennedy was in office, his secretary olf defense, Robert McNamara, learned there was no such Russian superiority -and, to the embarassment of the White House, openly admitted that fact. 
Twenty years later, Ronald Reagan campaigned on the as:;ertion that President Carter had allowed the Russians a lead that would give them a ''window'' ofopportunity to knock out our land-based missiles, sometime in the mid-1980s, before we could close the window with our Trident subs and MX missiles. 
The first question, of course, is this: What good would it do Russia to knock out our land missiles, so long as the airborne and submarine missiles were left to retaliate? The answer to this involves the kinds of 

hypotheses loved by war-garners. Suppose 1) that the Russians hit only our military installations with the first barrage of missiles, but 2) threatened to hit our cities if we should retaliate from airplanes or submarines, thus 3) forcing us to capitulate. 
These hypotheses themselves rest on a number of assumptions-that a first strike could be powerful and ac­curate enough to take out all our missiles, while leaving Russia an equally powerful stock of second­strike weapons. It assumes that the heavy first strike, spreading radiation from multiple points on our con­tinent, would be so accurate as to concentrate its effects, clearly marking it a "military" attack, not 
an urban one. 

It assumes that Americans, in the first shock of mass destruction, would be able to make the cool dis­tinction between kinds of nuclear at­tack and to resist the emotional urge to retaliate at whatever cost. It assumes that the Russians could make the distinction in terms clear to American leaders in this time of crisis, and that Americans would believe the Russians -believe they had the force for a second strike; believe our subs and planes could not cripple or counter that second strike; believe the Russians would refrain from the strike if we capitulated. 
Every one of these assumptions is faulty, yet every one of them must be maintained if a first -strike scenario is to make sense. Begin with the flfSt assumption, the certainty that a flfSt strike could take out our land-based missiles. A number of analysts have recently challenged the idea that missile accuracy, untested in war conditions, can be presumed great enough to knock out, in one attack, over a thousand of our hardened 

Outrider 

silos. Missiles crossing the North Pole would be subject to gravitation­al, wind and atmospheric conditions quite different from those undergone in test flights over Siberia or over the Pacific. 
Besides, even those who believe in the "window" theory say that it is opening because Russia has enough missiles, now, to throw two or three at one site. These are needed, accord­ing to tests under optimum condi­tions, to guarantee a close enough hit. But these missiles, even if launched at the same time and flying almost the same route, would under­go minute differences in pressure and in adjustments to their flight ir­regularities. Yet if they do not land simultaneously, the explosion of the first one would ward off or abort the second one's landing. Multiply these problems a thousand times, and the certitude of destroying our missile sites -and nothing else -disap­
pears. 
If that first certitude is unes­

tablished, nothing else matters in the 
chain of hypotheses; while, on the 
contrary, even if this assumption 
were granted, none of the others is 
secure. What, for instance, does 
"capitulate" mean in the war­garners' scenario? Give over our nuclear subs and airplanes? Promise never to use them? Abandon allies? Most of these acts would be con­sidered unacceptable, if not ir­relevant, even under the conditions presumed by the scenarists. 
The window of vulnerability is a myth then; just like the missile gap. Even the hard-line journal Strategic Review has admitted as much. But, so far, Secretary Weinberger ­unlike Secretary McNamara-has tried to maintain the fiction as a way of promoting ever more weaponry at ever higher costs.

Sports Illustrated -"...yet another Moeller alumnus at South Bend this year, and 46-year-old rookie coach Gerry Faust doesn't intend to see his .907 winning percentage drop so much as a point." 
Football News -"Say one thing for Dan Devine...he didn't leave a bare cupboard behind...that alone should make life considerably easier or Devine's successor, Gerry Faust." Crable makes the FN frrst team, Hun­ter the third, and the pair, along with Carter, Kramer and Krimm are on the all-midwest squad. 
The Sporting News -"Faust is targeting for ...a first-place national ranking for his team. And TSN's preseason voting panel (which 
ranked the Irish second) doesn't consider that such an impossible dream." TSN rates Crable and Krimm the country's best at their positions.

NFL teams cutdown rosters 
By LARRY SIDDONS 
Associated Press 
National Football League teams put their rosters Into final form yes­terday for the opening of the 1981 season, with Pittsburgh Steelers kicker Matt Bahr and Houston Oilers receiver Rich Caster topping the list ofcuts. 
Also cut were Mike Thomas, a 1 ,000-yard rusher In 1976, and Mike Fuller, starting safety for the ·past seven years, by the San Diego Char­gers. 
Meanwhile, the injured reserved ranks swelled as teams got down to the 45-player limit. Among the injured reserves were linebacker Ed Simonin! of the Baltimore Colts and quarterback Gi1ford Nielson of the Houston Oilers. 
Also cut by the Steelers was wide receiver Johnnie Dlrden, who went from driving a cement truck to a spot on the Houston roster three years ago. He had since been cut by the Oilers and Kansas City of the NFL, as well as Winnipeg of the Canadian Football League.

The other guard spot will be oc­cupied by Mike Shiner, a starting tackle on the left side last year. 
Shiner switched spots with Tom 
Thayer, who now moves to left 
tackle after starting six games at 
right guard a year ago. 

"The swit<:h has worked out 
wei~" says Shiner. "I'm a little quick­
er that Tom and can get out on 
sweeps. I'm not as strong as he is. 
He's a better base blocker which 
better suits him to tackle. 

"I was hesit:mt about the move in 
the spring," he continues, "but now I 
see that it was the best move to 
make. I love it. I'm glad I made the 
switch." 

Pozderac, meanwhile, will man 
the same right tackle spot he oc­
cupied a year ago. A starter in all 12 
games in 1980, Pozderac will join 
with Shiner to give the Irish offense a 
rather imposing set of blockers on 
the right side. 

Of the five starters, only Fischer has yet to earn a varsity monogram. Ellis, Thayer and Shiner each have one, while Pozderac has earned a pair. 
"It's true that our starters are inex­perienced at their positions," says Notre Dame offensive line coachJim Higgins. "It's also true that we put in a whole new offensive system, which requires more teaching time. But I think the switches we made will make us a stronger team. They suit the talents of the people we moved." 
According to head offensive line coach Tom Backhus, most offensive linemen are not exceptional ath­letes. "Exceptional athletes who are big enough are put on the defensive line," he says. 
Obviously, then, the moves were made to give the Irish offensive wall, as a whole, the combination of qualities it couldn't get from the in· dividuals which make it up. 
"Randy Ellis is extremely smart, and has good techniques," says Hig­

gins, coacb of guards and centers. "He needs to work on improving his strength. 
"Mike Shiner also needs to work on improving his strength," says Hig­gins, "but he is extremely mobile for a big man. He's very aggressive and he blocks well on the sweep. We do a lot ofpulling with our guards, and we need somebody who can get out and run, who can go find a lineback­er and block him in the open field. That's not as easy to do as it sounds." 
Mark Fischer, according to Hig­gins, the former offensive line coach at Moeller High School, has the body ofa center. 
"A center has to have a certain kind of body, a certain body mold. He has to be able to squat down with his feet paralle~ snap the ball and block. We felt Mark could do that. He has good, quick feet, he's ex­tremely hardworking, very tena­cious. Even when you beat him he doesn't quit." 
Fischer's current weight of 245­pounds is some 25-pounds heavier than his listed weight a year ago. The Irish coaches would like to see that weight up near 255-pounds next year, which would serve as an ad­vantage when trying to block generally lighter defensive linemen. 
The tackles -Pozderac and Thayer -both have "good tough­ness," says Backhus, something they will need when the Irish are in a ball control-type offense. 
"Tom Thayer likes to compete, he thinks tough," says Backhus. "He's a fme leader for our offensive line. He's solid and a hard worker. The reason we switched him to tackle is because he's stronger than Shiner, and Shiner is more mobile, can run faster." 
"Pozoerac also has good tough­ness," says Backhus, the frrst prep all­America Gerry Faust ever had at Moeller. "He has excellent natural strength and size, and a good under­standing of the game. He also is an excellent pass protector. Because of his size and range, he is a very solid tackle." 
The only senior among the five starters is Pozderac. Ellis, Fischer, Thayer and Shiner are all juniors, a fact that may be ofsome comfort to Irish fans already looking ahead to Gerry Faust's second season in 1982. 
As the elder statesman of the group, Pozderac has tried to occupy a leadership role, much had John Scully did a year ago. "It's been hard to accept it," says Pozderac of his seniority. "But I've tried to be a leader at times, mostly by keeping them working hard There are so many extra things that you can get away with not doing that we're trying to do, like staying on yourfeet and getting the second and third blocks.
