A doctorhas been lured to a rendezvous and stabbed for the second time sin.:e he reported what he thought was a high cancer rate in a little Florida town, his brother said yesterday. 
Dr. Frederick Boedy, who was slashed in the arm Sept. 1 5 and whose carport caught fire three days later, had already talked of leaving the area to protect his family. 
He was stabbed in the stomach late Sunday or early yesterday and 
was recovering at Jackson County Hospital in Marianna, Pete Boedy 
said by telephone from his home in Atlanta. Police said the doctor 
was stabbed at his office in Marianna, the seat of rural Jackson 
County. 

"The wounds were more serious this time," Pete Boedy said. "He 
required surgery." The 30-year-old family physician was listed in 
(lood condition, a hospital spokeswoman said. -AP 
A special staff of lawyers, auditors and inves­
tigators is helping Indiana crack down on Medicaid fraud, a crime 
that drains federal and state treasuries of millions of dollars every 
year. 

Instead of focusing on fraud by recipients of the health care program, the new unit in the Indiana attorney general's office will investigate illegal activities by people and institutions who provide care paid for by Medicaid dollars. 
Indiana's Medicaid fraud control unit, which was established in July, was dedicated yesterday at aceremony in Gov. Robert D. Orr's office. Richard P. Kusserow, the inspector general ofthe U.S. Depart­ment of Health and Human Services, represented President Reagan at the event. 
Kusserow, who presented a plaque to Attorney General Linley E. 
Pearson commemorating the ceremony, noted that 30 other states 
have set up similar operations to seek out fraudulent activity by doc­
tors, hospitals, nursing homes and other Medicaid providers. -AP 
The banana, the American public's favorite fruit and 
mainstay of several Central American economies, hasbeen taking a 
battering recently in a billion-dollar trade war that is causing pains 
for some big bananas in the import business. 
"Everybody's losing money in 'the banana field right now," la­
ments Sam Gordon, president ofthe Miami-based Del Monte Banana 
Co., America's third-largest seller of the golden-skinned tropical 
delicacy. "We're getting 50 cents now for every dollar we used to get 
last year." 

In 1981, the wholesale price of bananas averaged $7.28 for a 40­
pound box, the normal shipping container, and reached a high of 
$13.00, said Ben Huang, a spokesman for the Agriculture Depart­
ment in Washington. This year,_ the price has dropped to S5.54 per 
box. -AP 

Deep disappointtnentand reliefthat the waiting is 
over characterized the mood yesterday in Fort Wayne after Interna­
tional Harvester Co., the city's largest employer, announced it would 
close its Fort Wayne truck plant. 
"It's disappointing, but at least we got a decision finally," said Rex 
Bear, president of United Auto Workers Local 57 at Fort Wayne. 
"That's in itself a kind of a relief I said at the start of this there's not 
going to be any winners, just losers." 
The Chicago-based truck and farm machine maker will con­
solidate its U.S. truck manufacturing at Springfield, Ohio, in an 
economy move. The decision was announced by Harvester Presi­
dent Donald Lennox at a morning news conference with Fort Wayne 
Mayor Winfield Moses Jr. 

"We reached our decision to close the Fort Wayne assembly 
operation with deep regret," Lennox said. "But it was a necessary 
decision to protect the future ofthe company and the overwhelming 
majority of IH employees. We have been deeply moved by the ex­
pressions of support from the communities of Springfield and Fort 
Wayne." -AP

Despite the levity, the producers of the show are attempting to portray the seemingly casual attitude many police officers have towards danger. Each day their job brings them into contact with lik-theatening situations. However as any good cop will tell you, beneath the bravado, the calm exterior, is care and 
suspicion. A cop who wants to stay alive always has to be on guard. 
As students, danger in our daily lives is not something we face often. How many of us before leaving the safety ofour dorm rooms, or apartments, stop to wonder ifwe will return in the same condition in which we left' Nor­mally this wouldn't be a consideration, but events ofthe past few weeks should give qne pause.

shown this is false. When I was young. I remember watching ads on television urging people to drive defensively. In those days my idea ofdriving defensively was to chase small animals on my tricycle. Now in later life as a driver, I can see the reasoning behind that philosophy. 
A lot ofthe recent incidents might have been avoided ifthe students involved had been more careful. Not that the victims were at fault, but an extra show of caution might have made the ditference. For many, this is their tirst experience in fending ti.Jr themselves. Most of us come from neighborhoods that are fairly safe, so our tirst experience with crime may come when it hits us on the head -literally.

Things are different for those living offcampus. Many of the neighborhoods surrounding the campus are far from crime free. And the statistics of robberies of stu­dent apartments during semester breaks suggest local criminals are operating out ofmoving vans. Already this year, several students have been robbed by weapon 
wielding locals. Yet despite numerous warnings from 
officials, many people living off-campus regard the 
criminal element as part of"the adventure." Two years 
ago, off-campus students grumbled loudly about the 
level of law enforcement protection they were receiv­
ing. The result was a meeting that had present 
representatives from City and County police, as well as 
Administration officials and Notre Dame Set'urity per­

tions, and gave crime prevention tips to the students

I doubt many of us worry about our safety a lot. After all, we are ymtng and healthy, so the prospect ofsome­thing happening to us seems remote. Events have 
about alcohol's ellects. Be­cause ofthis, The Obseruer, starting today, is publishing a series ofalcohol information tests. Today's test covers general knowledge; students who have been in the Corby's Honors program may be dismayed at their results. The tests will be running through Friday. They were written by The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, an organization that's very name is a test ofsobriety. 
The tests that will run later in the week will deal specifically with driving and drinking. There has been a nationwide push by law enforcement agencies to get intoxicated drivers offthe road. Here in Indiana, anyone found with a blood/alcohol level of.1 0 percent or more is subject to arrest. The tlrst conviction is a mis­demeanor which can send you to jail for up to six months. Ifyou areever convicted ofdrunk driving again in Indiana, you can be put in jail for up to four years. Three mixed drinks can put you over the legal limit. 
I urge you to take the tests in the coming days. More importantly, I hope everyone will remember when they are out that disaster strikes without warning. Let's not have any tragic headlines on the front page ofnext Mon­day's Observer.

8.5percent 
Food strunp benefits increase 
WASHINGTON (AP) -The na­ti(,n·s 22 million food stamp recipients will get an average 8. 5 percent benefit increase -their first in two years -on Friday as the government begins a new fiscal year. 
But the start of fiscal 1983 will also usher in cutbacks and economy measures in other welfare programs and :\-tedicare, the health insurance program for 28 million elderly and disabled Americans. 
:\lany adults seeking Aid to 
St. Thomas More Society conference 
The first annual St. Thomas More Conference will be held Saturday, Oct. 2, at the Galvin Life Science Auditorium on the University of Notre Dame campus. The day-long · event is sponsored by the Thomas 
More Society of Notre Dame. 
The conference w;JI consist of a series of lectures and panel discus­sions involving such noted scholars as Joseph Berrigan, Professor of His­tory at the University of Georgia, 
John Gueguen, Professor ofpolitical science at Illinois State University and keynote speaker, Ralph Mcinerny of the Maritain Center, 
Notre  Dame  Profes~or  of  
Philosophy.  
In  addition, a tilm  and slide  

presentation on Thomas Mort: will be shown. 
The purpose of the conference is twofold, explains Society President Jerry Wegemer. To begin wii:h, we will examine Thomas More's impor­tance to the present, as well as the past. Equally important, though, will be the emphasis on the value of the liberal education ideal. 
The conference will begin at 1:00 p.r.-1. with a talk by Berrigan on St. Augustine and St. Thomas More: Two Catholic Rhetoricians. 
Thomas More: English Leader and European Statesman is the title of the second presentation, by Gueguen. 
Following the sessions there will be a pane! forum on liberal educa­tion featuring f:~culty and alumni of Notre Dame. 
The keynote speech will be delivered by Mcinerny on "The Wit and Wisdom ofThomas More." 
Families with dependent children will be required to look for work first. 
Medicare will no longer pay for private: rooms in hospitals or skilled nursing faciliics, unless the patient's condition requircs seclusion. The health insurance program will only pay for semi-private: rooms, saving S5-i million. 
Food stamp benefits have not risen since 1980. The boost on Fridav will raise the average month­ly be~efits for a family offour by 520 from S233 to S253. 
Congress skipped last year's nor­mal annual adjustment in the: so­called "thrifty food plan" for food stamp recipients as part of President Reagan's first round of budget cuts. 
The lawmakers also rejiggered the formula to hold down this year's in­crease in the S 11.3 billion program. They ordered S548 million in savings -including reduced pay­ments to states with high error rates -in a bid to keep the fiscal 1983 costs under S 1 1 million. 
As part of the s 1 00 billion tax boost that Congress enacted in Augu~t. Medicare is putting new limits on hospital reimbursements to save S480 million. 
It also will pay radiologists and 

pathologists only 80 percent oftheir 
"reasonable" cbsts, instead of the full cost, to save S 1 ~; million. 
Although these and other changes in reimbursement rates are directed at hospitals, physicians and other health care providers, s ome ad­vocacy groups kar the elderly will wind up paying a larger share of their medical bills out of their own pockets. 
The tax bill also allows states to charge adult :\ledicaid patients a small fee for all nonemcrgency services. Pregnant women and children are exempt. 
La.o;t Oct. I, the Rcagan administra­
tion and Congress instituted swcep­
ing eligibility changes in the: AFDC 
program, which costs s 1 5 billion 
and supports 1 1 million mothers 
and children and, in some states, un­
employed fathers. 
La.o;t year's changes made it hardcr 
for people to stay on the AFDC rolls 
if they worked. The new rule 
changes will allow states to require 
job searches for AFDC applicants; 
currently. states can only require 
job searches for those on the: rolls. 
AFDC payments will be barred to 
families where the only reason for 
the parent's absence i~ that he or she 
is on military duty. 
States also will be barred from 
making welfare payments 
retroactive to the tirst day of the 
month for new recipients.

Mexico program 


Exchange student chronicles trip 
Editor's Note: The following is part of a journal written by Fred McCarthy, a Notre Dame junior who participated in the Mexico program at the Universidad Iberoamerica last semester. The program is sponsored by the Center for Social Concerns. There will be an informational meeting for stu­dents interested in the Mexico program tomorrow at 7 p.m. in room 124 ofthe Hayes-Healy build­ing. 
Last year I began to wonder if I had made a mistake coming to Notre Dame. Like many other students, I was concerned about getting a quality education and, at th t e same time, being able to grow socially and personally. 
Last spring, I fulfilled this wish in a unique way by studying at the Uni­versidad lberoamericana in Mexico City. During that term, I encoun­tered the "other learning ex­perience." Some of these experiences included travel 
throughout the country and various 
social service projects that...have 
left a lasting impression on my per­
sonal education. 

Notre Dame and its confines have 
their proper place in the education 
of the student, but sometimes a stu­
dent such as myself, with different 
educational motives, feels that there 
is something else to be had in the 
process ofeducation. 

The "something else" that I found 
was the opportunity to educate 
myself without the traditional con­
straints of the system placed upon 
me. 

My motives for studying away 
from ND were not clear and exact 
before leaving, but I was determined 
to get a firm gra~p of the Spanish Ian-

KNOX, Ind. ( AP)-Sen. Katie Hall, D-Gary, is legally entitled to remain the candidate to replace the late l'.S. Rep. Adam Benjamin Jr. on the Democratic ballot in November's general election, a Starke Circuit Court judge ruled Monday.

Californiastorm. ruins crops.   
SA:'-< FRA:'IICISCO ( AP) -Torren­tial rains brought to California by tropical storm Olivia wiped out most of the new C.S. raisin crop and struck hard at canning tomatoes, according to industry tlgures quoted yesterday. "It is a disaster. We are approaching a point now that we can expect total losses for a lot ofin­dividual growers," Fresno County farm adviser Peter Christensen said. "There are going to be some huge losses." 
The unseasonal, harvest-time rains c taught about 90 percent ofthe raisin harvest as the grapes were drying in the fields, Fresno County Agriculture Commissioner Cosmo Insalaco said. 
Raisin growers had hoped for a bumper harvest of more than 260,000 tons following a relatively small harvest last year. 
Ron Kister, president ofthe Raisin Bargaining Association in Fresno, said it looked as if only 25 percent to 30 percent of the raisin crop would be saved. 
Kister said about 94,000 tons of raisins from previous years' harvests were in reserve when the storm:> hit. 
Larry Wharton, vice president of Sun-Maid Growers of California, es­timated the raisin losses at S200 mil­lion.

millions of dollars here, but I don't

Such automatic reviews have been par­ticularly numerous in the wake of the 19HO census that forced widespread redistricting.

Members of the Raisin Bargaining Association met yesterday and withdrew its offer price of s 1,19'> a ton. Kister said the group would meet again Oct. 5 and might set a new price then. 
The sun and breezes needed to dry the crops came out Sunday and stayed yesterday, but the National Weather Service reported that raisin drying conditions in the Fresno area would be slow. 
The rains also threatened the can­ning tomatoes with rot and mold. California produces most of the na­tion's crop and about 20 percent of that was in the fields when the rains came. 
"We're going to lose a significant amount of that 20 percent," Biggs said, and the loss "is going to mean the prices at least stay up where they are. 
Figs, alfalfa'hay, cotton and wine grapes also suffered damage, In­salaco said, although it was too early to determine how much. 
About half the state's wine grape crop had been harvested before the rain hit and most of the rest seemed to be free ofthe bunch rot and mold that growers had feared. 
"Just looking at the vineyards, we didn't see too much damage on them," said Harry McCracken, Sonoma County agriculture com­missioner, adding there might be a 10 to 20 percent loss ofthin-skinned white grapes such as chardonnay or riesling. 
But wine grapes in the northern San Joaquin Valley are displaying "a lot of rot, and the sugar is way down," Stanislaus County Agriculture Commissioner Hugh Sinclair said. "Some wineries aren't accepting some loads."

Inefficiency

plagues fed systellls 
BY TERENCE HUNT 
Associated Press Writer 

If you're still wondering if the 
federal government runs efficiently, 
the Reagan Administration suggests 
you consider this: 

The Navy spent s 1 50 million and 
12 years trying to improve its 
payroll system, and still has a 50 per­
cent error rate. 

Moreover, the bureaucracy has 
350 different payroll systems and 
j25 separate accounting systems, 
and they're all basically incom­
patible with each other. Only 60 
percent of the accounting systems 
meet federal standards for accuracy, 
reliability and security. 

The ratio of personnel specialists 
in governmer.t is three times as high 
as it is in private business. There is 
no accurate estimate how many con~ 
sultants the government has on the 
payroll. 

Treasury accounting clerks have 
to sift through :'>.000 pounds of ad­
ding machine tape and forms each 
month to pay the government's bills 
because the information isn't 
available on computerizedmagnetic 
tape. 

More than 2,:'>00 administrative 
payment centers are spread out 
across the country, processing more 
than 700 million documents, ill a 
rate of two to I H documents an 
hour. 

The administration cited those 
examples Wednesday as proof the 
government doesn't operate very 
well from a management standpoint, 
compared with private business. 
"We've reached the stage right now where management within the government is becoming extremely difficult, simply because of the fact the administrative systems haven't kept pace with just those that are available in the private sector," said Joseph R. Wright, deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget. 
Overall, he said, the government 
is weighed down by "a morass ofsys­
tems that arc frequently incom­
patible, redundant or obsolete." 
Martha Hesse, another OMB 
official, said the government's 
management systems "are so bad it's 
almost impossible for (agency 
chiefs) to manage." 

.To combat the problem, the ad~ 
ministration unveiled a new 
program to restructure manage­
ment and administrative systems 
throughout the government. 

Wright said the job of planning 
and implementing changes will take 
at least six years -thus the 
program's name "Reh>rrn 'HH."

The Business Advisory Council completed its annual meeting last friday after reviewing new graduate business programs and considering plans for the establishment ofa busi­ness research center. 
Unfamiliar to many students, the council is one of four groups which advise University President Father Theodore Hesburgh on matters dealing with respective colleges. The BAC consists of 60 executives from various companies who offer insight into what business organiza­tions would like to see in a business. school and its graduates. 
"Our focus is on improving and expanding the business school," BAC Chairman Thomas Grojean of Tiger International explained. "We try to ensure that the necessary resources are made available." 
The current emphasis is placed on the graduate program, Grojean said. "New enrollment is down to 60 this 
year  from  90. We  would  like  to  
reach  250  (for  the  two-y ear  
program.)"  

One major intluence of the coun~ cil has been on the new Executive MBA program, Assistant Dean Vin~ cent Raymond said. The new program is designed for veteran business executives who live in a 
I 00-to 120-mile radius of South Bend. Students attend day-long classes on alternating Fridays and Saturdays to fulfill course require­ments in two years. 

There will be an important meeting

Economic Update 
General Motors Corp. and Toyota Motor Co. ex­ecutives have ended four days of negotiations on a proposed joint venture in the United States, a Toyota spokesman said. The spokes­man refused to divulge any details of the talks between Jack Smith, GM's International production manager, and Toyota's Vice Presi­dent Toshio Morita. Kyodo News Agency said the talks centered on GM's idle plant at Fremont, Calif., a candidate site for the joint 'enture, and the degree of U.S.-made parts to be incorporated into what would be a jointly produced car. Kyodo said it was likely Toyota would come up with a decision on the partnership with GM by next month. -AP 
Oil imports are not likely to decline greatly by the year 2000 unless vigorous efforts are made toward conservation and use of alternate fuels, according to a study by the Office of Technology Assessment. The congressional agency said oil imports could be as high as 4 million to 5 million barrels a day at the end ofthe centuty, "unless imports are reduced by a stagnant U.S. economy or by a resumption of rapidly rising oil prices." U.S. petroleum imports averaged 5.4 million barrels a day in 19tH. The three options for cutting oil imports suggested by the study were: increased automobile efficiency, greater synthetic fuels production and reduc­tion ofoil use in utility and industrial boilers. -AP 


all Street Update 
A late rally in blue-chip issues helped turn a stock-market slide into a narrowly mixed performance Monday in the lightest trading in six weeks. The DowJones average of.30 industrials, which fell 15.27 points from its 13-month high over the three previous sessions, reversed course late in the day to post a gain of 1.38 points and finish at 920.90. Slightly more stocks fell in price than rose on the New York Stock Exchange, but 76 issues rose to 52-week highs and only three slid to new lows. Volume on the NYSE reached 44.84 
million shares, down from 54.60 million Friday, and the lowest since 
44.72 million shares changed hands on Aug. 1.~. -AP 


"We asked the council what they thought when we were designing the program, Raymond said. "Mostly, they responded to ideas we had already decided on. They were very helpful." 
The council was also presented with plans for the establishment ofa business research center. Cirojean stated that such a facility would as­sist faculty research and greatly en~ hance the quality and reputation of the graduate school. "The major aspect of business school research is a solid database," Raymond said. "This database, -the first prong of the plan, is already on its way here. We discussed with the council where additional resources would be obtained." 
Raymond emphasized the ad­visory nature ofthe council. "No im~ mediate decisions were expected," he said. "These things take a great deal oftime and planning. This is just the seed." Raymond added that plans for funding of the center were yet to be finalized. 
"It's a difficult position," one col­lege member commented. "On the one hand we want their input, on the other we don't want them to inter­fere too much in our work." 
At one point, BAC members met with a number ofstudents to discuss job opportunities and placement procedures. :Vtany of the executives were pessimistic about the job market f(>r prospective graduates. "We're hiring only replacements," Thomas Rolfs, chairman of Amnity Leather Products, said. "\1\'e're not really investing today in tomorrow. It may be shortsighted, but we feel we may be overinvested in today and want to reap some of the benetlts." 
The council members insisted 
that research into prospective 
employers and knowledge of com­
puters is essential for those seeking a 
job. "Know your company in the 
beginning," Council member John 
Ryan recommended. "You should 
spend two-thirds of your time doing 
research and one~third interview­
ing." 
Some students complained that 
they had expected to be asked about 
problems in the business college 
'llld were disappointed. "It was nice, 
friendly advice on getting a job but 
not much else," one said. "I thought 
we would at least be able to get in a 
couple ofcomments about the busi­
ness school." 
Raymond explained that no stu­
dent input was sought. "There were 
no items that really asked for student 
input," he said. "They were not 
perplexed by any issues where stu­
dent <:omme!'!~ ~·;;;_;needed."

Drunkards, fools 
The serious problem of drunk driving has once again struck home .as two Notre Dame students were suddenly struck from be­hind by a speeding car early Sunday. On September 18, another student was injured during a similar hit-and-run at the intersection ofCorby and Eddy. The driver ofthe vehicle was apprehended and charged with, among other counts, driving while intoxicated. If there is one consolation concerning these two tragedies it is that the students involved were not killed. This is little comfort, however, for who knows how soon these potential murderers be­hind the wheel will actually kill one of us. Because the three 
injured students are part ofthis community, we all share their pain and suffering and that of their families and friends. But an even more painful aspect is that these scenes occur throughout the country every minute of every day. Last year, drunk drivers killed over 30,000 Americans and maimed thousands more. We read about these sad incidents daily, about fathers and mothers, sons and daughters, about entire families being wiped out because of reckless, careless, drunken people. But because these tragedies happen so often, we tend to read these stories, shake our heads in 
disgust, and quickly turn to the comics page. 
Many ofus have suffered the griefofhaving the life ofa loved one ended by a drunken driver or causing their own death by getting behind the wheel ofa car while drunk. But what are we doing totry and prevent future deaths? 
How many times have you driven your car after downing six or seven beers? Too many ofus don't think twice about doing this. We feel in complete control ofour faculties and vehicle. We are so sure of ourselves that we pass off the possible consequences of our driving while intoxicated with a wonderful cliche, "It could never happen to me." The driver of the car that seriously injured Kerin Mannion and Elizabeth Mcinerny early Sunday morning probably thought the same thing. 
The responsibility lies with all ofus. The solution is as simple as 
not drinkmg that next beer or, more importantly, not serving it to some blithering drunk whom we know must drive or walk home. More likely, however, the eternal god alcohol will ultimately win. And we will all, once again, ultimately lose.

While overpopulation at Notre Dame has not )Tt r~:ached catastrophic proportions, we have all felt the uncomfortabk aftereffects ofa st~:adily increasing studt:nt enrollment. Pt:r­haps a few ~:xampks will prickle your memories. 
Upperclassmen, havt: you found yoursdf waiting in lines mort: often and for longer periods of time than a few years ago' Wheth~:r at tht: dining halls, in tht: Administration Building, or wht:rnTr wt: ~:njoy the latest Notre Dame pastime, lines seem to bt: one in­dicator ofcrowding. 
Perhaps you were on the waiting list ti>r a room on campus. As you all must know by now, freshmen (justifiably) have priority. They are all guaranteed a room, though some may have to make do with a study loung~:, kitcht:nettt:, bathtub, or closet for a week or tWo at the outset. As the number of freshmen 
want to mo\·e onto the campus must spend more time --on the nebulous waiting list, hoping that one day their number might pop up. Meanwhile, mo-rt: and more students art: ti>rced to tlnd oft--campus lodging in less and less desirable locales. Niles and Osceola may he nict: communities compared to certain places in South Bend, hut few students really 
want to live there. 
Tht: crowding probkm has ~:xtendt:d into tht: spht:rt: of studies as well. finding a desk in tht: library can, at times, be a task in itself. The classroom often takt:s on a sporting-t:vent at­mosphere, where t:yt:s strain to ge::t a glimpst: of what's going on. While tht: student/teacher ratio is not horrendous here at Notrt: Dame ( t:spt:cially if you havt: a st:minar or classics courst: in your scheduk ), it shouldn't bt: ignort:d in the fact: of a constantly increasing studt:nt population. 
Maybe you're a frt:shman who'd like to pur­chast: baskt:tball tickt:ts. Once upon a timt:, freshmt:n could buy t:ntirt: ticket packages, not having to worry about missing big games likt: liCLA, Indiana, Kentucky, or Dt: Paul. Thost: days art: long gone. Nowadays fresh­men are cont~:nt to get any package. 
Growth has het:n a continuous proct:ss her~: at Notre Dame ~:ver since the university ex­panded from Old Colkge and tht: Log Chapel in I H-t2. Of course, growth in tht: real st:nse is really a lksburghian phenomt:non. Evt:r since Notrt: Dame decidt:d to go coed in 19...,2, tht: school has ~:xpanded both acadt:mically and physically.

Hunter rebounds after nightmare 
By LOUIE SOMOGYI 
Sports Writer 
For many people, if Gerry Faust was the target to blame on the sideline for the disappointment of 1981, then junior Tony Hunter was a logical scapegoat to blame on the field ofplay. 
When Faust arrived last year with his ne~ unveiled wingback attack, Hunter was asked to forsake his split­end slot of the past two seasons for the honorary wingback position. It was a position that the best athlete on the team had to play since it demanded combined talents of run­ning, receiving and blocking. 
Indeed, Hunter was the perfect choice. His first two seasons at Notre Dame were merely the appetizers for the fans who had watched this talented athlete perform on the gridiron. 
Through his first two years he was on the receiving end of 50 passes for 993 yards. His speed (he had run a 
21.7 sec. 220-yard dash in high school) and fluid movements allowed him to average an amazing 
25.6 yards on 27 receptions his freshman year alone. Meanwhile, his statuesque 6-5, 21 5-pound frame was gaining notoriety for the level­ing hits he put on opposing defen­ders that dared to near his running-back teammates. 
Along the way, his versatile talents also led him to run end-around reverses for first downs and, yes, even throw a beautiful 31-yard pass to set up the tina! Notre Dame touchdown in the 1980 Michigan thriller. 
His talents would finally be utilized to perfection in 19H 1 as the coaches mentioned that most of the
 offensive scheme would revolve around the wingback. The mere thought of Hunter han­dling the ball 15-20 times a game, as the coaches said he would, created the forecasts for an awesome unit on offense. No one was more excited with the new system than Hunter himself. In the end, no one was more dis­appointed either. "Without a doubt that experience was the toughest point of my life," recalls Hunter. "Being at Notre Dame you have to learn to live with pressure; I just didn't come through when I had to. The pressure got to me and I became increasingly frustrated with what I was doing." 
His five game stint at the 
wingback posttton included a 2.5 rushing average on 27 carries. Meanwhile, his pass receiving became a major mystery as he began dropping well-thrown passes with alarming frequency (mishandling three in the Michigan game alone). 
The ones he did catch were few, and nothing close to resembling his close to 20-yard reception average that he ammased his previous two years. In his final three games at the wingback slot he caught four passes for only 1 1 yards. 
Even the pass he threw against Michigan was now intercepted. 
Mercifully, Hunter was moved to split end the next game. One game later he was moved to the tight-end spot which he currently holds. By that time, though, the Irish were 2-4, and the damage had been done to 
Hunter's spirit. Joyous days have returned for Hunter, though. Already he has latched onto 11 passes for 1 52 yards. His hands, more significantly, have no longer been butterfingers, but pure bread-and-butter in the clutch. Against Michigan, the last of his seven receptions on a fourth down play set up the eventual winning score. But his value in the clutch was even more evident in the Purdue game. On Notre Dame's first scoring drive, Hunter latches onto a Blair Kiel pass over the middle for 14 yards on third-and seven deep in Notre Dame territory to keep the drive alive. Hunter's third catch of the day 1 was a 25-yard reception on a third­and-eight situation. No score resulted from this series, hut it took the Irish out of poor tield position and set them up for better field posi­tion later. The fourth and final reception by Hunter on the afternoon was a 19­yard grab on a third-and-1 H situa­tion. A tremendous forward lunge with defenders hanging on to him got the first down. Seconds later, Phil Carter scored on a I 0-yard run to ice the Irish victory. After each of the receptions, the revived ebullience in Hunter showed as he led the cheerleading for his teammates on the tield, and coaxed for extra exuberence from the stands. ''I'm having fun out there," said a beaming Hunter after the contest. "I just love the blocking and the hit­ting; and the new offensive scheme that Coach Hudson has helped put in 
has just been super. 
"lfl feel like jumping up and down and leading cheers on that field, I will -no matter what others think. I'm having fun playing football for the first time in quite awhile." 

Irish baseball team wins one, drops pair

base too far, ending the rally. 
By NEAL SMITH 
Sports Writer 
Notre Dame won one out of three 
home games this weekend on Jake 
Kline Field, dropping its season 
record to 1-4. The Irish defeated Val­
paraiso University Saturday, 4-3, 
before dropping a pair to St. Francis 
College, 4-2 and 4-1, on Sunday. 
St. Francis, visiting from Joliet, Ill., scored early in the first game of the doubleheader. The first three bat­ters each singled, resulting in two runs. "They got one run, and we gave them one," said Coach Larry Gallo. On the second hit, the base runner went to third and the batter advanced to second on the throw to third. This enabled two run·s to score instead of one on the following single. 
· Notre Dame began its scoring in the third inning on three straight singles to center by Mike Doming, Jack Moran and Steve Passinault. However, Moran and Passinault were left in scoring position at the end of the inning. 
With two outs and no one on in 
the top ofthe fifth, St. Francis scored 
a run on back-to-back doubles by 
Kurt Miller and Jim Kelly, making 
the score 3-l. 
In the bottom half of the inning, Passinault walked and went to third on an errant pick-off attempt by the pitcher. Rick Chryst then singled to left, scoring Passinault. Phil Dingle followed with a single to right but 
St. Francis began the seventh with a double by Miller. Two outs later, he scored on an off-the-handle bloop single by Tom Baungarter, putting St. Francis up 4-2. 
Notre Dame had a potential rally going in the bottom of the seventh, but pinch-runner Phil Gilmore was picked off first base. The following two Irish hitters walked, but the game ended after Notre Dame could muster only one run on a sacrifice fly. 
"When you play the type of base­running we play, we beat ourselves," commented Coach Gallo. 
Steve Whitmyer was the losing pitcher. He pitched the entire game for the Irish. "I have no qualms about our pitching," remarked Coach Gal­lo. 
In the second game, which was shortened to five innings due to darkness, St. Francis scored three runs in the third inning. 
St. Francis added another run in the fifth on back-to-back doubles by Baumgarter and John Querio off Buster Lopes. 
Miller was St. Francis's biggest 
contributor of the day, going five-of­
seven at the plate. Centerfielder 
Scott Markley, who threw out run­
ners at third and the plate, was also a 
factor. 
In the 4-3 victory over the Val­
paraiso Crusaders Saturday, 
shortstopJason Schomer broke a 3-3 
tie in the eighth with a sacrifice fly to 
right field, scoring Vouna from third

TVrights suit raises old questions 
It has been difficult, to say the least, to decipher the confusing signals coming out of courtrooms in Ok­lahoma. First, a judge said that colleges could televise football games however they wanted. Oklahoma promptly sold the rights to last weekend's game with USC. Then, more judges said that colleges couldn't sell TV rights to their games. 
What's going on here? Is Notre Dame on the verge of 
a multi-million-dollar bonanza? How did all of this get 
started? 

In a nutshell, it started in the 1950's. Notre Dame was 
on TV every week, and the other colleges got jefl.lous. 
So, they voted to control TV rights through the NCAA. 
Nothing was said about basketball or other sports. Just 
football. 

Since then, the arguments on each side have changed very little. The big schools want control of their own games. The little schools, who stand to lose revenue on the deal, and who outnumber the football powers, keep voting to maintain control. 
How little ha~ the issue changed? Judge for yourself. The following are excerpts from speeches given before the National Association of Radio and Television Broad­casters convention in May, 1954. 
Walter Byers,Executir'e Secretary ofthe NCAA: 
"The important thing you have to come face to face 
with is that television hurts attendance ... The NCAA is 
an organization through which the universities and col­
leges speak on athletic matters at the national level ... 
The colleges have handed together for self-protection 
on this subject. "The University of Notre Dame has 
consistently voted against controlled telecasting in our 
organization and has presented forceful arguments for 
its position . . I assume the reason the University of 
Notre Dame takes that position is that they have seen no 
evidence of television's impact upon attendance at the 
University of Notre Dame, and quite rightly so, I think, 
and therefore they see no reason to control telecasting. They have no experience and hurt. 
"When the day comes that there is no damage to at· 
tendance or that there arc offsetting factors for such 
damage, the colleges will no longer control television." 
"We all sincerely hope ... that television will make new sports fans. However, to date we have not f()Und any appreciable evidence that television docs make new sports tans... 
Rev. Edmund P. Joyce, Executi1e Vice President, Uniuersi~}' ofNotre Dame: 
"We believe that the NCAA is highly presumptious in thinking that it can control the comings and goings. 

in and out of football stadiums. Banning television or 
restricting it will not insure that Starhigh College, for 
instance, will have the same attendance in 1960 that it 
had in 1947. There are too many other variable factors 
exclusive of television, that affect attendance. 
"It is ourcontention that television can and should he 
used as a great ally of intercollegiate football. True, we 
speak as a decided minority in the college ranks, but we 
are optimistic enough to feel that time will substantiate 
our position. 
''We found ourselves in the same minority position when radio came into prominence. The athletic direc­tor ofone our prominent Pacific Coast universities said that he was convinced that broadcasting "is hurting and will continue to hurt attendance." Knute Rockne had taken the opposite viewpoint. He had enough foresight to realize that radio could help dramatize college t(>ot­ball and bring countless new fans into the stadium. Sub­sequent experience-proved him right. 
"Now, another feature ofthe NCAA plan that disturbs 
us is that controls by their nature tend to become more 
and more restrictive. Permit the camel to warm his nose 
in your tent and it will not be long before he will take 
the whole tent ami you'll be sleeping outside. 
"However, the most ominous development of all. it 
seems to us, is the recurrent suggestion that a "share the 
wealth" plan might well be adopted whcrebv the 
proceeds from television would be divided betw~en all 
the colleges, whether their teams were on television or 
not. Besides being an insult to the integrity ofa college. 
such a suggestion is, to our mind, socialistic and dan­
gerous. 
"It is so easy for an opponent to sit back and sav. 'Yes. Notre Dame is opposed to the NCAA program b~cause they would stand to gain tinaciallv from a more liberal program. They have little concern.for the adverse effect on other colleges as long a.~ they enrich themselves.' However, mom~y has never governed the policies of 
our athletic program." 
I don't think anv comment on these is necessarv. While they may m;t speak well for the men involved, the comments are certainly representative of the relative intelligence of both sides.
