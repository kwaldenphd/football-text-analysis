The Notre Dame Alumni association will honor an outstanding senior in 1983 when it presents a citation based on both servic.e to the University and community and good academic standing. Officials of the 69,000-member organization say the second Distiguished Student Award will be presented at a national meeting in late April. Nomination forms are available to members of the university community and may be obtained in the Alumni Office, Student Government, and the offices of deans and rectors. The nomination deadline isJanuary 27, and a committee, coordinated by Father David Schlaver, director of campus ministry, will study the list of proposed honorees during February. The award has been described as equal in significance to the present Sorin and Armstrong Awards presented by the Alumni Association each year to an outstanding alumnus or staffmember, respectively, on the basis of service to Notre Dame and their community. The accolade's first recipient was joseph A. Regotti, a philosophy major from Mon­roeville, Pa. -The Observer 
Warren E. Burger,chief justice of the United States, will speak at the July dedication of Notre Dame's London Law Centre. Notre Dame Law Dean David T. Link said dedication ac­tivities would be the last week in July but no precise date has been set. The Centre is housed in Notre Dame's new London facility at 7 Albemarle Street in the Mayfair district. Tbe Law Centre is under­written by part ofa 1981 S4-million bequest from the estate of Dag­mar Concannon ofChicago, a gift that funds the Concannon Program on International Law at Notre Dame. Notre Dame's full-year London law program was established in 1968 and is the only opportunity available to American students to study law abroad on an academic year basis. There is also a summer program of legal studies at the London facility. -The Observer 
The Notre Dame Law School publication has changed its name from The Notre Dame Lawyer to The Notre Dame Law Review. The new name appears with the 58th volume of the magazine and is intended, according to its editors, "to reflect our continuing efforts to become a widely read and recognized legal journal." The journal, which is edited and staffed entirely by Law Students, was established in 1925. Each year, it publishes one volume in five separate issues appearing between October and june. In addition to material written by Notre Dame Law School students, the Review publishes articles and book reviews by law professors, judges and practicing lawyers. -The Observer 
Father Theodre M. Hesburgh,. university president, has been appointed by Popejohn Paul II to an internation­al council which is part of the Pontifical Council for Culture. The Pontifical Council for Culture was created by the Pope in May 1982 and is headed by Agostino Cardinal Casaroli, the Vatican's secretary of state. It will report to the Holy See on the major cultural aspira­tions oftoday's world, as well as do research on the expectations of contemporary civilizations and explore new ways of cultural dialogue. Its international council, which will meet at least once a year, was described by the Pope in a Jetter to Cardinal Casaroli as composed of"qualified representatives ofCatholic culture through­out the world." The international council will meet in Vatican City in January. -The Observer

Notre Dame security officials are investigat­ing the injury of two students involved in an auto ac..:ident Sunday (Dec. 19) at the intersection of Angela and)uniper Road. Stephen Busk and Maureen Goddard, both sophomores, were treated and released from St. joseph's Medical Center. Police said their auto departed the campus from a pedestrian walkway east of Pasquerilla East and was traveling at high speed when it rolled over south of the campus. The case has been referred to the office ofdean ofstudents. Two incidents ofindecent exposure or indecent liberties were also reported to the campus police. A resident of Pasquerilla East

It appears that something worthwhile actually may be happening in Southern California this week. No, they're not demolishing the television studios. The meritorious event is the NCAA Convention taking place in San Diego. And although the annual event has been noteworthy in the past only because of its irrelevance, this dubious reputation may be completely shed by week's end. The major issues being debated by the col­lege coaches and administrators of the NCAA involve upgrading academic standards for athletes entering col­leges on scholarships and swift, punitive action against coaches who violate NCAA regulations. 
The proposals are a welcome change which will at­tempt to overcome the criminal practices which have pervaded college sports tor years, all meant to entice the great high school athletes, regardless ofacademic or mental capabilities, to attend certain schools. The results ofsuch felonious acts have often been devastat­ing to the athlete involved. Completey unprepared for 
life after "college," many athletes turn to drugs, menial jobs or crime. The most shocking case is that of Billy Don Jackson who earned three varsity football letters at UCLA ( 1977·79 ). Last May he was sentenced for the stabbing death of a drug dealer. The judge found him to he illiterate and ordered remedial 
reading and writing courses for him. 
In an attempt to instill some meaning into the term "student-athlete," members of the NCAA have been · voting on a package of 12 academic proposals, any of which could drastically

Inside Thursday 

doubt many schools are honest and sincere when dealing with student-athletes. Notre Dames's untainted record was fully documented in last week's issue of Sports Illustrated. Penn State just won a national cham­pionship doing things by the book (hey Gerry, if Penn State can do it, why can't we?). 
But even with these stringent and necessary proposals, will college athletics really change for the better? Problems are already presenting themselves even as the delegates vote. Proposal --18 has been con­
demned by presidents of predominantly black univer· sities who claim that the academic requirements will make it more difficult for black players to attend large. predominantly white in­stitutions. And while it ap­pears that the NCAA is finally putting some bite be­hind its bark, what is going to be done to insure that the measures are followed? The NCAA's book of recruiting regulations has grown a lot of cobwebs in coaches' offices throughout the country. A few more rules are not going to miraculous­ly convert all the crooked coaches and administrators, 

hut enforcement might. And not the type of wimpy en­forcement practiced by the NCAA in years past. Cheat­ing has paid great dividends for many schools. Clemson, UCLA and USC are the most prominent examples. Before the relatively stringent penalties were levied against Clemson, colleges caught with their hands in the cookie jar received no more punishment than a trip to the woodshed. 
The NCAA is now on the right track. But for the new proposals to be as effective as they appear on paper, the organization must forge ahead with closer observation and greater enforcement. Otherwise, the Billy Don jacksons will continue to fall prey to the money and prestige hungry jackals ofcollege athletics.

change for the better the present corrupt nature ofcol­lege sports. 
Just yesterday, with the vigorous backing of joe Paterno and Fr. Edmund P. Joyce, the delegates passed Proposal 48 which requires a minimum number of math, English and science courses before a high school graduate can get an athletic scholarship. It also requires a ridiculously low SAT score of 700 (the national average is H93) and the athlete must maintain a GPA of 
2.0 while in college. 
If nothing else, this positive movement of a group whose previous preoccupation was pointing fingers at each other at least signals that changes are being at· tempted. Even before the vote, members of the Pac 10 and Big 10 conferences said they would impose the standards themselves even if the NCAA did not. Whether that was just meaningless rhetoric to neutralize the prying press and pacify an outraged public or genuine sincerity will never be known. No

PHOENIX, Ariz. (AP)-Awoman who says she was swindled and abandoned by an admitted bigamist says she married him despite his as­sertions that he was involved in or­ganized crime and was wanted for questioning in gangland slayings. 
Giovanni Vigliotto, 53, who ad­mits he has been married 82 times, is being tried on one count each of bigamy and fraud for allegedly bilking Patricia Gardiner out of S~6500 in cash and property when he disappeared two weeks after their marriage on Nov. 16. 1981

Operation Brainstorm winner 
Undergraduate club proposed 
By KATHLEEN DOYLE 
Assistant .Veu·s Editor 
Imagine a bar on the :'1/otre Dame campus! 
An undergraduate club. having all the characterisitics of a bar except alcohol. was the idea selected for first prize in the "Operation Brainstorm" contest sponsored by the Student Senate. 
The social club proposal was sub­mitted by Peter Ciotta, a junior American Studies major. 
The l'ndergraduate Club would serve non-alcoholic drinks. while placing emphasis on dancing, 
popular  music,  and  lighting.  The  
Chautauqua  Ballroom  is  the  sug­ 
gested location for the club.  

"Notre Dame students under 21 need an attractive place to relax, find entertainment. and to informal­ly socialize." said Ciotta. ''In Chautauqua there are already tables, chairs, lighting, a sound system, and more than sufficient space. Easily ac­cessible exits and decorative wall murals all currently exist," he said. "Through the positioning of tables. creative use of lighting, and the playing of contemporary dance music, the Undergraduate Club could easily be a reality at no cost to the administration or students." 
Ciotta also proposed that the non­alcoholic drinks be served from "two real bars," to enhance and complete the Undergraduate Club's 
Corby's 
commitment to providing an atmos· phere that would be similar to a real bar. 
These bars. possibly built by stu­dents. would be situated directly below the murals near the main stairway. Drink possibilities sug­gested by Ciotta include fruit juice drinks. club soda, tonic water. Pepsi, --up, and non-alcoholic daiquiris. 
The club proposal also includes possibilities for student employ­ment. Student disc jockeys, barten­ders. busboys, ·and bouncers could be employed. The College of Busi­ness might easily become involved in the operation of the club, giving students the opportunity to run an actual business. 
The Undergraduate Club would be open on a regular basis, maintain­ing regular hours on specific nights. 
Ciotta also suggested live band acts, dance contests, dorm party nights, and specialty nights, such as Rock and Roll or New Wave night, as one future possibility for the Under· graduate Club. Affiliation with such groups as the New Wave club was also proposed. 
"Considering the insignificant cost and major gains -responding to and relieving the need for new so­cial space and attacking the problem of alcohol abuse -the administra­tion, faculty, and students must sup­
port  the  institution  of  the  
Undergraduate  Club," Ciotta  em­ 
phasized.  

Ciotta believes that the best way to begin operation of the l'nder­graduate Club would be on a long term trial basis. ''The club can become reality with active support If the cause of taking action against alcohol abuse is emphasized, this club will succeed. because :'>Jotre Dame people respond to just causes,"Ciotta added.

Engineering Update 
Transit advances resulting from research at the Uni­versity of Notre D!!-me are being put to use in the transit systems of four U.S. cities to prevent costly cold weather shutdowns. Originally approved by Congress to recejve S5. 5 million of fiscal year I980 funds as the initial funding of a S20 million program, the cold weather transit technology program is a cooperative venture consisting of background research conducted at Notre Dame and design and engineering developments completed at Vought Corp. Model equipment from the project is being tested in buses and rail transit in Boston, Chicago, Lansing and Niles, Michigan. Directed by the Urban Mass Transportation Administration, the UMTA has recently called for the program to be re-oriented to produce more short-term results and has delayed further funding after having ad­vanced S I I million. -The Observer 
· EconomicUpdate 
u.s. business executives are planning to cut 
spending for expansion and modernization for the second straight year, a new government survey indicated yesterday. The cut, after discounting for spending due only to higher prices of materials and labor, would be a sharp 5.2 percent decline from the I982 level, according to the Commerce Department report. Government offi­cials and private economists had not expected spending for new plants and equipment to show much recovery before business in general starts to improve after the long recession. But the size of the newly estimated spending decline seemed to show business con­fidence at a lower level than many analysts had thought. -AP 
Wall Street Update 
The stock market finished mixed in heavy trading vesterdav. The Dow Jones' average of 30 industrials closed with a ~light Io~s at 1,083.61 after making a brief run at the 1,100 level. Analysts said some traders evidently had decided in advance to take some profits when the Dow reached 1,100 for the first time. They said hopes persisted for a broadening economic recovery. 3ut they added that there were no fresh news developments to account for today's midsession upsurge. Advances outpaced declines by almost 2 to I on the New York Stock Exchange. Big Board volume totaled 
109.85 million share, against 98.25 million in the previous session.

Marketing research suggests 
Youth change brand preferences 
By MILTON MOSKOWITZ 
.Special to the Observer 
Two marketplaces cigarettes and automobiles -will change dramatically if you project forward the current research findings on brand preferences ofyoung people. 
Marketing experts attach special importance to establishing brand preferences at an early age. People being what they are, creatures of habit, the theory is that if you get them to start using your brand when they are young, they will stick with it as adults. You can see this message repeated over and over again in the messages youth magazines beam at advertisers. 
In the old days the surest predic­tor of which brands people would select was the brands their parents bought. These days, when television and other media start zeroing in on children when they're very young, brand prcfen.·nces are not likely to be so predictable. Kids develop their own favorites. 
If you believe the studies that have been done in the cigarette market, Philip Morris will soon be king of the hill. The maker of Marlboro, Benson and Hedges, Vir­ginia Slims, Merit and Parliament, Philip Morris has been gaining steadily on the opposition for the past 2S years. It has come from last place in the field to second place, just a cigarette's width behind longtime leader R.J. Reynolds, maker of Winston, Salem, Camel, Vantage, Now, Dora! and More. 
Reynolds now has about 33 per­cent of the total market, Philip Mor­ris 32 percent. Marlboro has been the top-selling brand since 1976 when it edged ahead of Winston. 
But what the future may bring was indicated recently by Diana Temple, a security analyst at the big Wall Street house, Salomon Brothers. Temple reported that among young cigarette smokers, people between the ages of 18 and 22, the Philip Mor­ris brands hold more than SO per­cent of the market. 
That's bad news indeed for Reynolds. If these young smokers continue to hold their current brand preferences, Philip Morris will

decimate the opposition. 
The switch from Reynolds to 
Philip Morris has cultural and 
demographic overtones. Marlboro 
8 and other Philip Morris brands ­
have always been strong in uban 
areas, appealing to "urban cow­
boys." Camel and Winston are 
stronger in rural areas. Philip Morris 
is headquartered in New York, 
Reynolds in Winston-Salem, North 
Carolina. 
Equally foreboding for General 
Motors, Ford. and Chrysler are the 
results of market surveys in the 
automotive field. Here too brand 
preferences used to be tied strongly 
to family loyalty. If your father drove 
a Chevrolet, you would be likely to 
choose a General Motors product 
for your first car. Now it seems that 
young car buyers are in revolt 
against their parents. 
It's no secret that foreign cars 
have been taking bigger and bigger 
chunks of the U.S. market. Their 
share this year is over the 25 percent 
mark even though the Japanese 
companies are holding down their 
exports because ofour protests. 
Owning 2S percent ofthe U.S. car 
market is an impressive achieve­
ment. But this may be only the 
beginning. Researchers looking into 
who buys what report that among 
buyers under 30 years old, the im­
ports have SO percent of the total 
auto market. 
That's going to be a tough hold to 
shake. A buyer who's satisfied with 
his or her car tends to look for the 
same make again. Detroit has always 
stressed the importance of building 
this consumer loyalty. So if these 
young buyers of Toyotas, Datsuns 
and Hondas stay with their current 
brand preferences, the U.S. auto in­
dust!')' is going to be driven to the 
wall. 
:Sex aids ~:oro nary ,victims 
By ROBERT LOCKE 
AP Science Writer 
Sex, "one of nature's finest 
tonics," is not only possible after a 
heart attack but seems to help with 
recovery, a psychiatrist says. 
"People who return to a sexual life almost invariably have a better prognosis in terms of returning to work...and to socializing" after heart attacks, said Dr. Thomas P. Hackett, chief of psychiatry at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. 
It is a damaging myth, he said Tuesday, "that once you have a (heart attack), you're over the hill and there's no sense in even talking about sex because you can't have it anymore." 
Hackett said an unwarranted fear 
of death during intercourse is givtln 
as the main reason sexual activity 
decreases by an average of 50 p ~r­
cent among heart attack survivors. A 
quarter of all such survivors never 
resume sexual n:lations, he said. 
He told an American Heart As­sociation Science Writers Forum that sex after heart problems is em­phasized because "it seems to be a key to progress in rehabilitation...lt is one of nature's finest tonics." 
Hackett is co-author ofa Heart As­sociation booklet on sex and heart disease that will be published this year. He said research has shown that sex, at least within marriage, "is relatively safe insofar as its effect on the cardiovascular system."

Electronics toy with reality 
Christmas presents ofa few years ago quick­ly lost their luster as children, young and old either used up the batteries or grew tired of the whistling trains and erector sets. But the microelectronic toys of the past few years have survived the test of batteries and boredom with A/C rechargers and inter­changeable programs. With a subtle twist of the wrist, electronic toys have snatched bil­lions ofdollars from a docile public. 
Paul McGinn 
Roper Review 

While these new toys have made science 
more enjoyable, dots of light and periodic 
beeps have replaced reality. 
The boom in electronics is not totally new; radio primed Americans for the audio/visual revolution. All of us have heard the charming tales ofparents and grandparents who used to huddle around the house's only radio to hear FDR, Amos and Andy, and Fibber McGee and Molly. 
They tell of the family togetherness which now seems so lost among the television generation. They wonder how the young can spend five hours a day watching television in­stead of playing stickball in the street. 
But what so many of the past generation have forgotten is the massiveness of the media revolution. The changes in the media over the past decades are not inherent to the media or the messages, but spring from the numbers associated with this mass com­munication explosion. 
Just as we want the media i:o bring us everywhere, so too do we want to bring the media wherever we go. We think nothing of having a television in every room or an AM/FM stereo radio in every car. 
Christmas 1982 brought its usual share of electronic objects, but the most obviously proliferated product is the traveling cassette player, complete with headphones. The stereo revolution which sent the recording in­dustry reeling in the early sixties now appears on sidewalks and bikepaths. 
The great blooming of music which took sound from the recording studio to every home is now even challenging the birds, trees and plants. 
Our senses have become so dulled to our environment that we choose to titillate our ears while merely catching glimpses of the scenery. 
We no longer breathe, taste, smell, listen or see the sights which surround us. Our eardrums pound to the beat of music which invariably and offensively leaks from lightweight headphones. Walking no longer becomes an invigorating way to see our en­vironment, but a vector-like blindness which ends only once we arrive at our destination. 
Much as the video games tuck us into four walls, the audio toys lock us into one-sided 45-minute tracts. One wonders when com­pact audio/visual toys will strap themselves to the necks of the present Walkman wearers. These compact versions of M-TV might even include a device to signal the approach offel­low walkers, so that the audio/visual junkie might look up in time to avoid meeting a fel­low encapsuled addict. 
We no longer worry about the dangers of lack ofexercise when we use electronic toys, because we take our playthings to the very events which are socially incompatible with such toys. Monday Night Football cameras al­ways locate a crowd gathered around a televi­sion. Rarely do we go to a Notre Dame football game where someone is not plugged into a portable radio. 
We have become so lost in the mass mess of communications that we ignore the subtleties of a singular event. We instead seek a wide "knowledge" ofthe programs available on our dials. 
It seems so comical that the communica­tion boom which strives to bring the world closer to us only takes us away from ourselves. 

P.O. Box Q Tootsie reveals good risk of friendship 
DearStudents: 
Most of you saw a wise and delightful movie over Christmas break, Tootsie. You liked the warm, spontaneous, unselfish woman that Dustin Hoffman created in the movie. You almost felt she was a real person,
j. 
even though you saw with your own eyes how he did it. 
In an interview, Hoffman explained how much he had learned from transforming himself into Dorothy Michaels. He said that he was shocked to realize how much physi­cal appearance controlled the way this woman was treated by men. She was almost invisible to men because she was not young or conventionally pretty. (Her set director can't even remember her name.) Observing the way men related to him as Dorothy ­"having men meet me, say hello and im­mediately start looking over my shoulder trying to find an attractive woman" -made him very angry. "flut I also realized I wouldn't ask myself out: if 1 look the way 1 looked as Dorothy. I wouldn't come up to myselfat a party." 
"What a waste." he reflected, imagining all the people he might have passed up because they didn't fit a certain visual standard. He says he thinks most men don't feel attractive, and they want to get a good-looking girl next to them to enhance their image. Dustin Hot: fman didn't say it, but I suspect it works the other way too -a woman isn't sure of her attractiveness so ~he tries to get a handsome man beside her to confirm it. 
I fear that here at Notre Dame this kind ot emphasis on looks is spoiling the social life ofmany students, both good-looking and not so good-looking. The big crowded parties so characteristic of Notre Dame life promote the emphasis on appearance. Dense masses of people looking one another over, maneuvering, trading up, ditching a moderately handsome companion for some­body one point higher -this cannot be satisfying. 
But large-crowd parties are always like this, in the student world as in the adult world: maneuvering and trading up. Con­versation is brittle, shallow. hypocritical. No opening of hearts takes place: no exchange of real opinions or real personalities. Only the tin coinage of faddish slang and name­dropping passes back and forth. Who enjoys such parties? Who expects a churning crowd of two hundred to yield rewarding· encounters? 
If you think social life at Notre Dame is barren of rewarding encounters, it might be that you're detlning social life in a false way. A satisfying social occasion is not a hundred people; it's tlve or six people doing some­thing together that they all enjoy, such as having a picnic, going to a play, eating and drinking around a table. Or it's four people playing bridge; or three people hiking; or two people telling each other about their childhoods and getting to know each other. 
Getting to know each other does not take place at Corby's or at a hot noisy section party. At those events, social life con­centrates on the skin, the hair style, the bodi­ly contours, and the clothes. You put each other into computers; good hair, click; no pimples, click; streamlined figure, click; con­fidence, dimples, pedigree, the right accent, click, click, click, and out comes the rating. An utterly mechanical, superficial evalua­tion. 
What a waste, dear students. You're pas­sing up charming, original, funny, warm-hearted people that could make your life richer and help you grow. Look at the person sitting next to you in a class, or at a dining hall table. Say something. Open your­self. Take a risk. He or she might be as delightful as Dorothy Michaels in Tootsie.

''I've tried to put across (the idea) that pressure defense is more a psyche than anything else," said coach Mary DiStanislao. "We failed to execute against it, and just held on. It's one thing to win a game that's nip-and-tuck all the way; it's quite another to fritter away a nine-point lead in the la~t two minutes."

Dec. 30 -Notre Dame survived a furious second-half rally by East Carolina to gain their seventh con­secutive win, a S2-50 decision today at the ACC. 
The Irish, who had built a I 0­point lead, needed 1 2 points from Laura Doughety and 1 I from Shari Man·ey to hold on for the two-point win. 
Ruth Kaiser and Mary Beth Scheuth combined for I 5 rebounds in the ballgame, which provided a stiff test for a team about to embark upon a taxing three-game Eastern swing.

ND80, Wm.&Mary63 
Dec. 30 -Notre Dame con­
cluded its season opening nine­
game home stand tonight with an 
80-63 victory over the Indians of 
William & Mary. 
The triumph left the Irish with the 
6-3 mark that most predicted for the 
team to finish with in its opening 
home stand -losses to the "big 
three" of Kentucky, UCLA and In­
diana, and victories against the com­
petitive but outmatched teams from 
Stonehill, Saint Francis, Fairtleld, 
Dartmouth, Valparaiso and William 
& Mary. 
As in the Valparaiso game played 
eight days earlier, a fantastic field 
goal shooting effort of 6S percent 
( 36-for-SS) paced Notre Dame to its win. However, unlike the \'alpo game where the great majority of points came from tlte inside power game led hy Ken Barlow and Tim Kempton, the majority of baskets against the Indians came from pin­point outside shooting hy guards John Paxson and Joseph Price, and­
forward Billy Varner. 
"William & Mary packed it tight against Kempton and Barlow inside and that's why we went more to the outside shooting," explained Notre Dame coach Digger Phelps. 
The strategy worked well in the first half as Paxson scored 12 points, Price scored all f()ur of his tleld goals in that stanza. and Varner was a per­fect :'>-:'> from the field as the Irish pulled out to a :'>H-2S halftime lead. 
With the outside game es­
tablbhed, Notre Dame started 
hammering away more on the inside 
in the second half as Ken Badow 
scored 10 of his 12 points in the 
second l'eriod. Paxson, once again 
rook top scoring honors as he 
finished with 20 points. 
Two of the brightest perfor­
mances in the game for the Irish 
came from the bench as Varner and 
freshman guard Joe Buchanan 
helped establish a tempo that kept 
the Indians from ever really closely 
contesting Notre Dame. 
Varner was S-for-7 from the field 
as he finished with 12 points while 
Buchanan scored six points, handed 
out three. assists, set up another 
score after a mid-court steal, and 
most importantly, helped run the of­
fense well.

Dec. 22 -John Paxson's 1,000th career point, a dominating inside performance by the three freshman frontliners, and surpassing the cen­tury mark for the first time in three years highlighted Notre Dame's 108­70 romp over the Valparaiso Crusaders tonight at the ACC. 
While Notre Dame's 17 turnovers indicated some rustiness from an 11­day layoff, it was greatly over­shadowed by a scorching 6S percent shooting effort from the field (on 4S· for-69 field goals), and an amazing

Besides matching the :'>0-point career high he set last year in the :\lichigan tlnale, Paxson became on­ly the Z"'th player (out of -i :'>0 players) in :--;otre.

While the ghost of Paxson's past and present was the big news, it was the ghost of Notre Dame's basketball future which may have pleased Irish coach Digger Phelps lhe most as the ever-maturing freshmen frontliners. Ken Barlow, Tim Kempton and Jim Dolan combined tor S6 points and 27 rebounds. 
Barlow had the best scoring night of his young career as he fired home 25 points on 11-1 S shooting from the tleld. His nine rebounds, meanwhile, were second only to Kempton's season high of 12 this night. Kempton was also a scoring force inside with his 16 points.

WASHINGTON, Jan. 6 -The 
Notre Dame women's basketball 
team played possibly its best game 
to date, beating Georgetown, 78-68, 
tonight in McDonough Arena. The 
victory is the ninth in a row for 
Notre Dame-one short ofthe team

Some good shooting from the

rebounding allowed the Irish to 
overcome an earlv I 0-'l Hoy a ad­
