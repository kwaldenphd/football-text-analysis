Alllll1riifrom ND, SMC re-elected to Congress 
Graduates to serve new terms in House 
By MEGAN O'NEIL News Writer 
Notre Dame and Saint Mary's were well represented on ballots on Election Day with seven gradu­ates between the two institutions
i 
,. being re-elected to Congress. 
Four Notre Dame alumni and three Saint Mary's alumnae held onto their House seats and will return to Washington, D.C. as members of the 109th Congress. 
Among the vic­


torious Notre Souder Dame alumni were two of Indiana's nine congressional representatives. Represent-ative to Indiana's 1st district Peter Visclosky won a 10 term. A D e m o c r a t , Northup Visclosky gradu­ated from Notre Dame Law School in 1973. Republican Mark Souder, who earned an MBA from Notre Dame in 1974, was elected for a 



sixth time as Vlscloskyrepresentative to Indiana's 3rd Distriet. 
Another Notre Dame alumnus, 1968 Law Sehool graduate and Hepublican Peter King, was re­
elected to his eighth term in New York's 3rd District. Fellow Republican Michael Ferguson was voted into New Jersey's 7th dis­trict for a third time. Ferguson received a bachelor's degree in political science from Notre Dame in 1992. 
Among the Saint Mary's gradu­ates re-elected was Anne Meagher Northup of Kentucky's 3rd District. Northup earned degrees in business and economics from Saint Mary's in 1970. She was eas­ily re-elected over her democratic opponent for a sixth term. When elected for the first time in 1996, Northup WBS the first woman in Kentucky to have been elected to Congress since 1926. 
Nineteen sixty-six Saint Mary's graduate Donna Christensen was elected to her fifth term as con­gressional delegate from the U.S. Virgin Islands. The Democratic congresswoman is the first female physician in the history of the U.S. Congress, the first woman to rep­resent an offshore Territory and the first woman delegate from the Virgin Islands. Christensen chairs the Congressional Black Caucus' Health Braintrust, which oversees and advocatf~s minority health issues nationally and intPrnation­ally. 
Eddie Bernice Johnson, a Democrat from the 30th district of Texas, won re-election for a sev­enth term. Congresswoman Johnson received her nursing preparation degree from Saint Mary's in 1955. She became the first woman and the first black to ever represent the Dallas area in Congress when she was elected to

Talabani fights for Iraqi Women 
Women's Council member tells ofexperiences 
By JEANNINE PRIVAT 
News Writer 
Addressing issues rang­ing from her personal life to the United States' involvement in the Iraq reconstruction process to the role 
of women in Iraqi society, A l a Talabani of the I r a q i Women's II i g h 

Co u n c i I Tala bani 
a n d Women for a Free Iraq spoke at Notre Dame Friday. 
Talabani, on campus by 

invitation from the Kroc Institute for International Peace Studies in conjunc­tion with Women Waging Pe.ace, stressed the need for women to be involved in the reconstruction process and ultimately the new Iraqi state. In a society where women have tradi­tionally been oppressed, she emphasized the need for both genders to realize the importance of women. 
"Women need to believe they have a role to play in the society," she said. 
Talabani and other women decided "a real women's movement in the country" was needed, she said. They began the slow process of opening women's centers, applying for grants from USAID and nongovernmental organiza­tions and forming their own groups, like the Iraqi Women's High Council and Women for a Free Iraq. Talabani has also been involved with the hosting of women's conferences throughout Iraq, and in promoting the women's movement in Iraq across religious, ethnic and geo­graphic lines. 
"Violence against women is the same in Baghdad, Basra and Fallujah," she said. 
And with women making up a 60-percent majority of the population, their role in society is something that female activists think should be taken seriously,

Student CPAs work for charity 
By KATE ANTONACCI News Writer 
N(~arly 370 certified pub­lic aceountants, including 52 from Notre Dame, gath­Pred Friday to take part in the statewide CPA Day of Service. 
The event, planned by the Indiana CPA Soeiety (INCPAS), gathered CPAs at 39 locations in 18 cities throughout Indiana for a day of community serviee. 
"We believe it was very successful and we haven't even received mueh feed­back yet," said Dave Shatkowski of the Indiana CPA Society. "I'm sure we will get positive comments from our members who partieipated as well as some notes and letters of appreeiation from the organizations we served. That would just add to the success of the event." 

The number of volunteer CPAs nearly doubled from last year. 
"Our ultimate goal is 1,000 participants," said Shatkowski. "I don't know if that will be reached next year, but we hope to keep moving in that direction." 
The charity day was cre­ated in 2002 to recognize Indiana CPAs' dedication to charity. The Day of Service has also proven a good way for accounting students to network with local CPAs. 
"We thought that volun­teerism is a good activity for any profession to encourage, and we already knew that many of our CPA members individually par­ticipated in local volunteer projects," said Shatkowski.

wayside. 
Although my friends no longer notice my "accent," there are certain phrases I use that evoke a "huh'?" from even my closest friends. These phrases are unique and powerful. They define life moments, both simple and complex, spoken by good ol' Mom and Dad, and now spoken by me. These phrases have serious meanings and when used in the proper context, put sophisticated words into one's mouth when one is searching for the perfect expression. I will now defme and clarifY these complex axioms. 
Madder than a wet hen. A thoughtful­ly complex metaphor describing some­one who is raging mad. When hens are wet, they are mad. In fact, they are livid. Use this phrase to express the intensity of another's anger. For example, when "Drinker Dave" outfoxed Oflicer "Bob" at the Michigan tailgate, Officer "Bob" was madder than a wet hen. 
In a rabbit stew. Another clever metaphor describing someone who is in quite the predicament and quite worked up about it. If one were a rabbit and in a stew, or ifone were put in a boiling pot of rabbit stew, one would be in a stress­ful jam. For example, when Tennessee's head coach realized after Saturday's game that the Volunteers' ranking was about to go down the toilet, Coach Fulmer was in a rabbit stew. 
Making a mountain out of a molehill. This phrase means that one is overana­lyzing a situation. Mountains are bigger and more in1port.ant than molehills. When one makes a mountain out of a molehill, one is not looking at the triviali­ty of the situation. For example, when a few students made a fuss about some Saint Mary's T-shirts, they were making a mountain out of a molehill. 
Six of one, half dozen of another. My friends swear only my mom and I use this phrase. This is a very good phrase meaning that two different routes are the san1e in length and destination. For example, when walking from the 06 parking lot to SOH, one must choose which steps of the Rockne to take. Either the north steps or the south steps will get one to SOH in the same amount of time. Therefore, it is six of one, half dozen of another. 
Stinkin' thinkin'. Another term I have learned from my mom providing great self-esteem advice. Stinkin' thinkin' gets one nowhere. For example, ifyou believe that you have not been poked on The Facebook because you are not cool, that is stinkin' thinkin' because, come on, if you are on The Facebook, you are cool. 
And thus this portion of my philosophi­cal dictionary concludes. I have picked up from Mom and Dad many phrases that will continue to provide life lessons and eloquence. Try one of these phrases sometime. You will be surprised at how clearly and articulately you will be able to deseribe a situation.

Bank under construction sees robbery bid 
KENNESAW, Ga. -There is little money to be gained from attempting to rob a bank that is still under con­struction, police say a Marietta man learned on Wednesday. 
Michael Donald Marshall, 39, entered the Bank of America and demanded $500 from the tellers while threatening that he had a 
gun,  according  to  the  
Kennesaw  Police  
Department.  

The employees then told him the bank wasn't open for business and there was no money. Kennesaw Police arrived as Marshall exited the building empty-handed, officers said. 
The suspect is charged with armed robbery. 
Tanker spills liquid chocolate on highway 
GROVELAND, N.Y. -Part of a highway in the Finger Lakes region was closed for five hours Thursday evening after a tanker truck crashed, spilling 45,000 pounds of slippery liquid chocolate that hardened. 
State Police said there were no serious injuries in the crash shortly after 5 
p.m. A road grader was used to scrape the north­

bound lanes of Interstate 390. 
Truck driver Bert Nestlrode, 46, of Ephrata, Pa., swerved to avoid a deer, the truck rolled over and the tanker split, police said. He was treated at a hospital for cuts and bruis­es and no tickets were issued. 
The syrup also covered a bridge and a car on another road below. The truck, from M&M Mars. Co. in Elizabethtown, Pa., carried liquid used to make milk chocolate.

Catholic Charities meet at Notre Dame 
Special to The Observer 
Senior members of Catholic Charities offices nationwide will gathered starting Sunday and will meet until Wednesday for the first ses­sion of a new educational program designed to enhance the administration and strengthen the leadership of their organization. 
"From Mission to Service: A Program on Mission-based Leadership and Organization Development" is underwrit­ten by Notre Dame and designed by the Mendoza College of Business specifical­ly for officers and board members of Catholic Charities offices. The pro­gram's instructors include members. of Notre Dame's theology and business faculty as well as other national fig­ures. Among those teaching in the first session are Lawrence Cunningham, John 
A. O'Brien professor of theol­ogy, Joseph Holt, director of executive education program­ming for the executive MBA program, Gerard Baumbach, director of the Center for Catechetical Initiatives, and Rev. J. Bryan Hehir, president and treasurer of Catholic Charities for the Archdiocese of Boston and this year's recipient of Notre Dame's highest honor, the Laetare Medal. 
One of the designers of the program, father Hehir observed that Catholic Charities organizations are in transition. Forty years ago, nearly all of the Catholic Charities organizations were headed by priests, and 
now 75 percent of the execu­tive directors are laypeople. "This shift will require us to attend to Catholic identity in new ways," said Carolyn Woo, Martin J. Gillen -Dean of the Mendoza College of Business. 
"This program results from the collaboration of lay and clerical leaders, and between business faculty and theolo­gians. It is an innovation with spiritual and social signifi­cance." 
The program is intended to help those who work in Catholic Charities to "develop a leadership vision for their organization that reflects a faith-based mission, under­stand how the rich heritage of Catholic social teaching anchors their work today, incorporate the principle of faith-based mission as their. organization's strategic driv­er, develop awareness and skills regarding values-based decision-making, develop a framework for linking mis­sion-based values to organi­zational systems and prac­tices, and build a strong, national network of col­leagues with similar inter­ests." 
The second program ses­sion will take place in March. 
The Catholic Charities net­work consists of more than 1,400 local agencies and institutions nationwide. They annually assist nearly 7 mil­lion people in need of emer­gency aid, counseling, adop­tion assistance, housing, and numerous other services. They also coordinate the efforts of more than 220,000 volunteers. 
Voters desire stability in Iraq 
Poll shows top priority is a resolution as fighting intensifies 
Associated Press 
. 

WASHINGTON As President Bush mulls what to do after winning re-election, voters say his first priority should be resolving the situa­tion in Iraq, where the fight­ing is growing more intense. 
They also want Bush to cut the deficit, which ballooned under his watch, rather than pushing for more tax cuts, according to an Associated Press poll taken right after the election. 
The voters' concerns stood in contrast to the priorities Bush cited after he defeated Democrat John Kerry. Bush pledged to aggressively pur­sue major changes in Social Security, tax laws and med­ical malpractice awards. Terrorism was a chief con­cern both for Bush and many voters in the poll. 
"I earned capital in the campaign, political capital, and now I intend to spend it," Bush said a day after becoming the first president in 68 years to win re-election and gain seats in both the House and Senate. 
Some 27 percent of respon­dents named Iraq as the top priority for the president's second term, ahead of issues such as terrorism, the econo­my and health care. 
Only 2 percent named taxes as a priority. By more than a 2-1 margin, voters said they preferred that the president balance the budget rather than reduce taxes further. 
After a campaign dominat­ed by discussion of Iraq and terrorism, national security issues are at the top of vot­
ers' concerns along with the forces. economy. Voters were asked "There has got to be some to pick from a list of issues in kind of resolution in Iraq," the AP poll that included said Erwin Neighbors, a

Seven in 10 voters, includ­
ing a majority of Democrats, 
would prefer that U.S. troops 
to stay in Iraq until the coun­
try is stable, instead of hav­
ing them leave immediately. 
U.S. troops are preparing for assaults on insurgent strongholds used as havens for those mounting increased attacks against coalition 
nent. 

The nonparti­san Congressional Budget Office now sees $2.3 trillion in accumulated deficits over the next 10 years. That does not include the cost of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
Given the choice between balancing the budget and cutting taxes, voters chose balancing the budget by 66 percent to 31 percent. Just over half of Republicans as well as most Democrats and ind~pendents felt that way. 
When the choice is between balancing the budget and spending more on education, health care and economic development, voters were divided. Slightly more want­ed the additional domestic spending, 55 percent, than chose balancing the budget, 44 percent.

French and Ivory Coast troops clash 
ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast -French troops clashed with soldiers and angry mobs Saturday after Ivory Coast warplanes killed at least nine French peacekeepers and an American civilian in an airstrike _ mayhem that threatened to draw foreign troops deeper into the West African country's escalating civil war. 
Mob violence broke out in Ivory Coast's largest city after France retaliated for the airstrike by destroying two government warplanes at an airport outside the capital. 
Thousands of pro-government youths, some armed with machetes, axes or chunks of wood, took to the streets of the country's commercial capital, Abidjan. 
Crowds went door to door looking for French citizens and set fire to two French schools, sending a pall of smoke over the city.

The 26 Saudi scholars and preachers said in an open letter to the Iraqi people that their appeal was prompted by "the extraordinary situation through which the Iraqis are passing which calls for unity and exchange of views." The letter was posted on the Internet. 
"At no time in history has a whole peo­ple been violated ... by propaganda that's been proved false," Sheik Awad al-Qarni, one of the scholars, told Al-Arabiya TV.

IRAQ 






Government declares emergency 
Country is initiating all-out assault on guerrilla sanctuary, Fallujah 
Associated Press 
BAGHDAD -The Iraqi government declared a 60­day state of emergency throughout most of the coun­try Sunday, paving the way for an all-out assault on the guerrilla sanctuary Fallujah. Militants dramatically esca­lated attacks, killing at least 30 people, including two Americans. 
American troops began final preparations for battle in Fallujah as commanders warned them to expect the most brutal urban fighting since the Vietnam War. The 
U.S. command announced it had sealed off Fallujah and was "finishing fmal prepara­tions for an assault" on the city. 
Underscoring the country's instability, several heavy explosions thundered through the capital even as government spokesman Thair Hassan al-Naqeeb was announcing the state of emergency, which applies throughout the country except for Kurdish-ruled areas in the north. 
Interim Prime Minister Ayad Allawi, who called a meeting Sunday with his defense minister, interior minister and provincial police commanders, said the state of emergency is a ..very powerful message that we are serious" about reining in insurgents before elections set for late January. 
"We want to secure the country so elections can be done in a peaceful way and the Iraqi people can partici­pate in the elections freely, without the intimidation by terrorists and by forces who are trying to wreck the politi­cal process in Iraq," he told reporters. 

Insurgents waged a second day of multiple attacks across the restive Sunni Triangle north and west of Baghdad, storming police stations, assassinating gov­
' -3rnment officials and setting off deadly car bombs. About 60 people have been killed and 7 5 injured in the two days of attacks. 

At dawn, armed rebels stormed three police stations in the towns of Haditha and Haqlaniyah, 137 miles north­west of Baghdad, killing 22 policemen. Some were lined up and shot execution-style, police and hospital officials. 
Assassins gunned down a Diyala governor's aide and two provincial council mem­bers south of Baghdad as they were on their way to a funeral in Karbala for a fourth colleague assassinat­ed earlier this week. 
Three attacks on U.S. con­voys in and around Baghdad killed two American soldiers and wounded five others Sunday, the military said. Residents reported grenades setting police cars aflame on Haifa Street in the heart of the capital. 
A car bomb also exploded near the Baghdad home of Iraq's finance minister, Adil Abdel-Mahdi, a leading Shiite politician. Abdel­Mahdi and his family were not home at the time but the 
U.S. military said the bomb killed one Iraqi bystander and wounded another. A U.S. patrol came under small­arms fire as it responded, wounding one soldier, a statement said. 
Two British soldiers were seriously injured by a suicide car bomber southwest of Baghdad, while a British contractor was killed in a roadside bombing.

In Web postings, the al­Qaida affiliate group of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi claimed responsibility for the attacks in Samarra, Ramadi and Baghdad. The claims could not be verified, but U.S. offi­cials believe al-Zarqawi's group uses Fallujah as a base. 
The widespread insurgent attacks seemed aimed at relieving the pressure on Fallujah, where about 10,000 American _troops are massing for a major assault if Allawi gives the green light. 
Iraqi officials would not say whether the emergency law decree meant the deci­sion to storm Fallujah had been taken. 
Bush plans permanent tax cuts 
Associated Press 

WASHINGTON -Buoyed by a clear-cut election victory, President Bush is pledging to make permanent the sweeping tax cuts of his first term and to simply the nation's tax laws. 
The price tag on making the tax cuts permanent is more than $1 tril­lion, a daunting number in an age of record budget deficits. 
At the same time, efl"orts to enact ambitious proposals to overhaul the tax system often fall victim to a fero­cious assault from Washington lob­byists determined to protect special breaks for their clients. 
While not discounting the chal­lenges ahead, Bush's supporters are betting that the president will end up getting much of what he wants with the help of bigger Republican majorities in both the House and the Senate. 
"Tax reform is a politically danger­ous road to travel with a lot of corpses," said Stephen Moore, head of the Club for Growth, which sup­ports an aggressive tax-cutting agen­da. 
"But the president is very serious about this. lie wants to make a major push for overhauling the tax system," Moore said. 
Moore and others expect Bush's 
model will be Ronald Heagan's suc­cessful effort to enact the 1986 tax overhaul, one of the broadest rewrite of tax Jaw in history. It dra­matically lowered tax rates and paid for those reductions by eliminating or scaling back tax deductions. 
So far, Bush has disclosed little about how he wants to simplify the current system, which he has called a "complicated mess." 
He first stated his tax overhaul goal in his August acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention. He promised that if re­elected, he would create a bipartisan advisory panel to come up with a "simpler, fairer, pro-growth system."

IN BRIEF 
United Airlines seeking 725 million 
CHICAGO -United Airlines is moving to obtain another $725 million in labor conces­sions and eliminate employees' traditional pensions as it seeks the financing to come out of bankruptcy. 
A day after the troubled carrier notified employees that further steep reductions in pay and other benefits arc coming, union leaders met to analyze the proposed cuts and decide how to respond. United's largest unions declined comment until discussing the plan further. 
The nation's second-largest airline has been threatening to terminate its pensions since August. Last month, it said it would need to cut costs significantly more than anticipated because of the industry's deterio­rating financial outlook. 
Spokeswoman Jean Medina confirmed Friday that the carrier will ask a bankruptcy court judge to approve an extra $725 million in annual savings from workers, part of an effort to squeeze an additional $2 billion from the carrier's cost structure by next year. 
Indianapolis gains new tenant 
INDIANAPOLIS -Indianapolis Diversified Machining Inc. will become the second new tenant at the airport's Indianapolis Maintenance Center, city officials announced Thursday. 
The company plans to initially employ 50 mechanics, machinists and support staff at the facility, which was built to repair United Airlines' airplanes but closed last year. 
According to an airport news release, the company hopes to hire more people as busi­ness grows. IDM will lease the 216,000­square-foot shops area near the mainte­nance hangar bays. 
"Our announcement today marks another major step in our efforts to reactivate the Indianapolis Maintenance Center and pro­vide more job opportunities for our experi­enced work force," said Indianapolis Mayor Bart Peterson. 
IDM was formed in 2003 by a group of for­mer United Airlines employees and invest­ment banker Brent Waltz. 





Five executives convicted of ftaud 
Criminal trial finds Merrill Lynch and Enron employees guiltyfor company's collapse 
Associated Press 
JIOUSTON-A jury con­victed four one-time Merrill Lynch executives and a former midlevel Enron Corp. finance exec­utive of conspiracy and fraud Wednesday in the first criminal trial of Enron and Wall Street executives for their role in the energy company's 2001 collapse. 
The deal at the center of the charges involved a bogus sale of interest in power plants mounted on barges to the brokerage at the end of 1999 so the company could appear to have met earnings targets. 

The barge case marked the first time Wall Street bankers were charged with active participation in a criminal Enron scheme. While Enron's former auditor, Arthur Andersen LLP, was convicted more than two years ago of obstruction of justice for destroying Enron docu­ments before the collapse, the barge case was the first to involve former Enron employees as defendants. ..,

Politicians come and go, oftentimes leaving behind nothing more than wisps of what once were promising campaigns, but not football coaches. Football coaches leave so much more -an image, a record, a history, a legacy. Joey Falco Football coaches define who we as a Forty Ounces to society are, and Falco many loyalists go so far as to say that the coach at Notre Dame bears the distinguished second­ary title of leader of the free world. Certainly, then, this explains why such a commotion resulted from the recent football coach election that overtook the highly polarized Notre Dame cam­pus, engulfing the administration, alumni and student body in a civil war for gridiron supremacy. I remember it like it was yesterday. 
After finally becoming fed up with the mediocre record, disappointing losses, shaky secondary, poor special teams and fickle offense that had become characteristic of coach Ty Willingham, a group of angry alumni decided to nominate their own candidate to replace him. Although much delibera­tion ensued, this Alumni Party man­aged to narrow their choices for coach down to three individuals-Super Bowl champion and lifelong Notre Dame fan Jon Gruden, undefeated Utah coach and former Notre Dame wide receivers coach Urban Meyer; and sniveling Stanford coach Buddy Teevens, whose unimpressive career record and total lack of Notre Dame affiliation left many wondering how his name managed to sneak through the cracks. 
In order to select the best candidate for the job, the Alumni Party graciously permitted the student body to narrow down the field of three challengers through a primary election of sorts, in whieh various dorms voted in succes­sive weeks, allowing each candidate the opportunity to run a grassroots campaign in each residence hall. 
EDITORIAL CARTOON 

However, the poor decision to set aside the first two weeks of voting for small, uninformed girls dorms like Pangborn and Howard proved disastrous, because by foolishly refusing to cast their votes for two of the candidates based entirely on superficial things like a physical resemblance to the Chucky doll or an outlandish first name, the relatively unknown and unqualified Buddy Teevens ended up gaining a surge of momentum that carried him through victorious primaries in every dorm that followed. Sadly, Gruden and Meyer were forced to head home and resume their successful coaching careers elsewhere. 
Back on campus, the incumbent Administration Party immediately unleashed their attack dogs on the unsuspecting Stanford coach, leading one high ranking Willingham supporter to claim that voting for Teevens in the general campus election was equiva­lent to voting for allowing a rogue group of fundamentalist Michigan Wolverines to hijack an NDSP car and crash it into Notre Dame Stadium. In response, Teevens' team of Alumni shot back in defense that the heroic coach had once saved the lives of many of his Stanford players from drowning during a freak boating accident several years ago, and would therefore be able to protect Notre Dame from the terrors of opposing teams. 
This back and forth bickering contin­ued for months, with Administration­backing priests making claims that God had told them that He sided with Willingham, and Alumni-backing donors arguing that Teevens would not surround himself with an incompetent staff as Willingham had done. The most malignant attacks, though, did not emerge until the very end of the cam­paign season after Teevens had pum-· meled Willingham in a Blue-Gold game that tested the coaching expertise of the two men. In one statement, Willingham's top advisor attempted to spread fear throughout campus by referring to the Stanford coach as a heathen who, if elected coach, would replace Touchdown Jesus with a mural of George Michael. 
Finally, as election day rolled around and students turned out in droves to wait in line for hours to simultaneously cast their votes for coach and receive a limited number of basketball season tickets, exit poll surveys conducted by student-led group Hock the Coach dis­covered that a majority of students sharply disapproved of Willingham's past coaching record. However, despite these poll results, Teevens was over­whelmingly defeated, 15 dorms to 12 dorms, and the despondent Notre Dame students and Alumni Party were once again left with a coach who they had never really wanted in the first place. 
Thinking back, I still can't believe that we as a University willingly decid­ed to select our football coach and leader in such a silly, superficial, and corrupt manner. This so-called demo­cratic system really only served to leave the people angry, polarized and unwilling to provide the football team with the support that it desperately needed each weekend. Still, I guess we should just count our blessings and be happy that we don't make even more significant decisions that truly affect the way we live in such a foolish, juve­nile way. Actually, I don't think I would even want to live in a country that would force its citizens to choose between two relatively unpopular guys like Willingham and Teevens who come from the same school and divide the population more than they unite it. 
And that's why I'm proud to be an American.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Election ends, but the issues march on 
With Election 2004 winding down, we are left in the wake to consider what the next four years will hold. Will the worJd turn against America? Will the terrorists continue their acts of evil? Will Iraq con­sume countless lives and costs beyond control? Will tensions erupt between Islam and Christianity? Will we be jobless once we graduate from college? Will the economy boom again? 
To be honest, I don't know. 
President George W. Bush doesn't know. 
No one knows. 
Now, I've read and heard my fair share of delight and bitterness at the Election 2004 results. Bush won and Sen. John Kerry lost. In retrospect, both candidates were imperfect, each with various strengths and flaws. On Tuesday, America made a decision for whom to vote. And the people have spoken. 
To those who supported Bush, you made a decision that is anything but inconsequential. You have a duty to ensure that Bush carries out what you consider to be good for the sake of the American people. If he does something right, commend him. If he screws up, crit­icize him. A President is elected with the trust that he will do what is in the best interest of the people. 
To those who are still bitter and mad, put aside your feelings on the matter. I voted for Kerry and I can empathize with the feelings of loss and disappointment. But now is not the time to grieve. You can wallow and sulk away, or you can hold your head high and do what you can to bring about change. If you are dissatisfied with how the last four years went, then do what you can to ensure that the next four years won't become worse. Democracy is at its worst when citizens remain inactive and apathetic. 
Even though the election is over, our duty as American citizens is far from over. We must not allow partisanship to win over unity. We can still do our part. We can go out, plant a tree and keep our environment clean. We can protect all forms of life. We can support our armed forces and hope for their safe return. We can teach and educate ourselves and oth­ers on the world of today. We can help the poor, the needy and the less fortunate. We can treat all human beings with dignity, respect and love, regardless of their race, sexual orientation, or beliefs. 
But it isn't so much that we can do all this but we must. 
In the m~xt four years, at least three Supreme Court justices will retire. The choices to replace the outgoing justices 
will determine whether the "culture of 
death" lying under the "justice" of capital 
punishment and Roe v. Wade will contin­
ue to take the natural right to life of 
humans and a generation of our children. 
The next four years will require a moral leadership so desperately needed to hold off the cultural revolutionaries from elim­inating marriage and family by applying it to homosexual and heterosexual relation­ships outside marriage and using the power of the State to do such. 
The next four years demand an embrace of all peoples, regardless of race, sexual orientation and faith. We must extend a hand of friendship, dia­logue and embrace to our human neigh­bor, regardless if they are white, black, Hispanic, Asian, gay, lesbian, Catholic, Muslim, Jewish or anything else. Tolerance is inadequate; acceptance is needed. 
The next four years are an opportunity to solve the health care crisis, restore economic confidence and opportunity and open up the market as a vehicle for free­dom in the service ofthe person, the fam­ily, and the common good. We must embrace the poor, the unfortunate, the disenfranchised and others. 
The next four years desperately need a foreign policy that embraces reconcilia­tion and cooperation from all nations and peoples across the world. Prudence and justice must trump over all else. Humility and forgiveness are the bridges that must be crossed to achieve the greater good of a united world. The people of Iraq need help in their hour of need, and we have a duty to help them. It is not only America that needs healing but the world as well~ 
The next four years requires initiatives taken to preserve and restore the health of the environment. The Kyoto Treaty and wildlife preservation must take precedent before the needs of the present. If we continue to hack away the throat of Nature for our own needs, then will our world even continue to breathe for our children, their children and their descen­dants? The life that we live is inexorably linked with the world that we walk. 
That is why we must do what American citizenship demands of us. Nay, not only citizenship but whatever higher power we believe in wants us to do. 
Thien-An Nguyen-Vu freshman Morrissey Manor Nov. 5 


In the past week, I have heard numerous students stating that Americans who voted to re-elect President George W. Bush must be stupid. While this comment is offensive in itself, I am writing because of my concern with the fictitious intelligence chart of America that has been circulating among stu­dents online since the election. This chart purports to correlate the average IQ of Americans in various states to a tendency to vote Democrat or Republican in the 2004 election. According to the chart, Democrat voters from the East Coast are unequivocally the smartest people in America, while Republican voters south of the Mason-Dixon line are intellectually inferior. The point is, of course, to show that those states that voted to re­elect ,Bush are comprised of "stupid Americans" who interfered with the will of "smart Americans" to choose the best president. 
Aside from the fact that such sweeping categorizations of the southern and rural areas of our country are unfounded, I find this chart most offen­sive because of its implication that the less educated and the poor do not deserve to vote, since these voters obviously lack the capacity to make an "intelligent" choice. This idea reveals the discrimination against rural America and the less privileged that has divided America over the course of its history. The South and other parts of rural America hold a distinct set of values and political beliefs that have been shaped by their experience. Although one may disagree with these beliefs, they are nonetheless logical and rooted in conviction. Sadly, if the IQ chart can be said to have any valid­ity at all, it only reflects the reality that Americans from the East Coast often have been privileged with opportunities that others have not had. If an intelligence gap exists for Southern and rural areas, this should be seen as ref1ecting a legacy of discrimination and lack of opportunity instead of one of incompetence. 
I shouldn't have to remind anyone that many of the states that voted Republican in this year's election are also disproportionately home to the men and women of the U.S. armed forces that are risking their lives daily to protect this country. I would think that the people most directly affected by war in losing friends and relatives in Iraq deserve a voice in politics. My intent is not to argue the merits of voting Hepublican, but I hope that those who passed on this affensive IQ chart to friends will realize that the political choice of 59,424,292 Americans can be disagreed with, but must be respected. Degrading the strong base of Southern and rural support that has propelled Bush to the presidency will do nothing to unite our nation for the struggles ahead.

Is the American Dream becoming a nightmare? 
Individualism and the opportunities given to the American people and immigrants from other countries are the great assets of this nation. These opportunities are what helped the United States in the past to become. one of the greatest and most powerful nations in the world today. The dream, from dishwasher to millionaire, has been lived in this society because of individualism and the opportunities America provides not only to the rich and powerful, but to the everyday per­son. The shock that went through Europe with the re-election of President George W. Bush reflects to a great extent the incomprehensibility as to why the American people would vote for someone that so clearly is not in the interest of the American people, from a European perspective. 
So let's think about what, consider­ing what the majority of the American people voted for on Tuesday. is in the interest of the American people and what Europeans, like me, tend to think about it. 
Abortion: Tuesday the majority of people voted pro-life and against a woman's right to choose. Europeans tend to support pro-choice, and con­sidering the nice phrases the policies of "pro-life" and "pro-choice" are packed in, it really seems to be a hard decision to choose either one of them without considering the realities. Killing of innocent life is simply wrong, I agree. 
But criminalizing abortion will not make the phenomenon go away; rather push it in a sphere not seen by society, making control even harder. 
Security: On Tuesday, the majority of the people approved the war in Iraq and Bush's handling of the war on ter­ror. It is hard to believe that an esti­mated 100,000 killed Iraqis, over 1,000 killed U.S. soldiers and numer­ous wounded and crippled human beings on either side have made the United States or the world a safer place or is going to win the hearts of those opposing the United States. 
Economy: On Tuesday, the majority of the people approved the jobs lost in the last four years, the budget deficits and corporate giveaways. Most inter­esting to me are the budgPt deficits, because those will have to be financed by someone, and if it i~ not you or your parents today. it will be America's children tomorrow. 
Healthcare: On Tuesday, the majori­ty of the people approved rising health care costs and rejected government initiated health care. From a European perspective, the health of a nation is one of its greatest assets as future generations will grow up in either a healthy or a sick society. which will in part be responsible for their productivity, and the future of the country. 
Denying healthcare to people who can't afford it raises social costs and increases the healthcare costs of those who can -right now still -afford it. 
Moral Values: On Tuesday, the majority of the American people in 11 states voted to ban gay marriage on the state level, and in some cases even included civil unions. but at the same time, it is not okay to amend the con­stitution when it comes to the right to bear weapons. 
In these terms, I can see why a shock of incomprehensibility went, and is still going, through Europe. Considering the policies supported by the majority in this country, I ask myself, is the American dream becorn­ing a nightmare?

This hip-hop musical, pro­duced by 3rd Dimension Performance group based in Chicago, presents a story familiar to many twen­tysomethings. Protagonist Jay Alexander, played by triple-threat Ted Williams, is a successful young profes­sional who has just started a

face the painful realities of his pseudo-perfect existence. What follows is a quest to fjnd eternal fulfillment and a battle to hold onto the one thing most precious to him, his soul. 
Primarily structured around interpretive and hip­hop inspired choreography, "Torn" takes one on a ride through the fundamental meaning of life. Should we live for our jobs and making money to keep other peoplf~ happy through material things, or should we live for ourselves? After seeing this supposedly earthshaking performance, people are forced to think about their spiritual lives and their sig­nificance in this world. 
Th(~ story and message, while new and often over­looked, was not very well structured and at times was lost in the chaos of a dance or song. The first act pre­sented the audirnce with a question, and rather quickly spt'lled out thn answer. In a typically dramatic perform­ance, there is a large build­up of emotion that leads to a will blend and inter­weave time. 

The highlight of the per­formance was the play-with­in-a-play that concludes the story's action. Each of the five actors appeared as-a charac­ter playing a part in the play, "Pyramus and Thisbe," and at the same time played mem­bers of the audience watching the work. The smooth and clear transition from one group in the scene to the other revealed the talents of the actors, as well as showed the effectiveness that simple props can have. It proved to be the funniest scene in a play that ereated a great deal of laughter as a whole. 
"A Midsummer Night's Dream"~was an apt choiee for the AFTLS format, particular­ly because there were few scenes where one actor had to play more than one char­acter, which can cause some confusion. The work's light and fanciful humor can often get bogged down in elaborate sets and costumes, so the pared-down staging made the carefully constructed charac­ters and settings stand on their own. 
Overall, the AFTLS per­formance of "A Midsummer Night's Dream" was a won­derful interpretation of the famous work that allowed the play's merits shine forth, and it brought the jokes in the play to life in such a way that reminded the audience why it is put in the "comedy" genre.

'Fortinbras' lights up Philbin Theater 

By MOLLY GRIFFIN Assisram Scene Editor 
The Actors from the London Stage brought its interpreta­tion of Shakespeare's "A Midsummer Night's Dream" to the Leighton Concert Hall this weekend, and with mini­mal scenery, no real costumes and few props turned out an amazing performance of one of the Bard's great comedies.

dialogue with sung verses. "Torn" did not flow, but was fraught with frequent end­ings and beginnings to repet­itive and predictable scenes. The dialogue was lengthy and unwitty, but could be easily improved with some careful editing. 
The message was frequent­ly portrayed with Christian overtones, which to a larger audience felt more like a Sunday school program rather than a musical drama. Overall, the performance was well-done, minus a nag­ging microphone problem and random slide shows which only eonfused rather than clarify. The entirely blaek cast was refreshing and naturally talented, and many members could sing, dance and act. However, if this production wishes to take its message to a larger­scale audience, major restructuring of the plot line and preachy overtones need to be addressed.

Most of the characters in "Fortinbras" are ghosts that harass the title character, 
played by Mike Dolson, left. 
ByKC KENNEY Scene Wrirer 
It's been a big year for theater at Notre Dame. When it came time to christen the Regis Philbin Studio Theater, the depart­ment of film, television and theatre went a little beyond Shakespeare and found Lee Blessing's comedy "Fortinbras." 
Directed by visiting professor Jay Skelton and featuring the talent-; of FTT majors and non-majors alike, the show is an excellent display of the versatility and need for the Performing Arts Center on campus. The doorway was opened to a myriad of artistic possibilities that Skelton took advantage of fully exercising a great deal of the theater's potential. 
Lee Blessing's show about Fortinbras, a secondary character in "Hamlet," is a clever and hilarious comedy about the state of afl"airs in Denmark after almost ev~ryone dies at the end of "Hamlet." Being dead did­n't stop Hamlet's father from talking to him in "Hamlet," an excellent job of maintaining the fickle character of Fortinbras as he wavers and flip-flops all over the stage. While the char­aeter lacks the depth of Hamlet, Dolson is able to illustrate the pseudo-transformation of Fortinbras into a stronger individual then when he first received the crown. Though his rhythms are at time somewhat uneven, his energy and strength allow him .to be comical as well.as emotionally deep. 
T.J. McNally seems to make the show legitimate as a Shakespearean spin-off. While his IIoratio works to share the truth of what happened in Denmark with the world, McNally shows a desperation and sincerity that allows Shakespeare's pres­ence to be felt throughout the show. From the beginning to the end, he is an honest arid real voice in a clever haunted comedy. 
Conor Woods as the apple-shining servant Osric adds color and life to this comedy. As a dynamically flamboyant addition to this comedy, his boundless spirited attitude keeps the audience laughing. His acting,

Buck upsets No. 93-ranked player to end fall season 
Irish freshman finishes 10-3 with 
6-2, 6-3 victory 
Speical to The Observer Freshman Brook Buck reg­istered her second upset of a nationally-ranked player in three days to lead the Notre Dame women's tennis team on Sunday in the Indiana Invitational at the IU Tennis Center. The day, which saw the Irish win four of six sin­gles matches, marked the last of the fall portion of the 2004-05 schedule. Notre Dame will begin its spring dual-match slate on Saturday, Jan. 22 at Ohio State before opening at home on Sunday, Jan. 23 at Noon against Vanderbilt, which finished last season ranked No. 2 in the nation. The Irish won four of six against players from Purdue on the final day of the Indiana Invitational. Notre Dame. which was without its top two players this week, played hidden dual matches against the Boilermakers, DePaul, and the host school. In hidden dual action, no t~am scores are recorded, though the Irish would have beaten DePaul (6-1) and Purdue (4-3), while losing to Indiana (4-3). For the entire fall season, Notre Dame had the upper hand in nine of 10 hidden duals despite playing all but three without their top two competitors. The Irish also competed against Auburn, Colorado, Denver, Kansas, Michigan State, Ohio State and Virginia in hidden dual play this fall.

Junior Liz Donohue also was unbeaten in singles action in the tournament, as she ended up with a perfect 6-0, 6-0 win against Shawna Zuccarini. Donohue also notched a 10-3 record this fall, including 8-1 against the Midwest Region. The Irish junior, who already has three more singles victories than her previous career-best sea­son total, now sports a 20-3 career mark' when winning the opening set. 
Junior Kristina Stastny fol­lowed up her first career win over a nationally-ranked foe by beating Brooke Beier in a match tiebreaker, 6-2, 1-6, 1-0 (11-9). She posted a 9-3 mark during fall action, including an upset of No. 124 Gergana Ganeva of DePaul on Saturday.

McGahee leads Bills over Jets

ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. -The

formidable one-two punch. 
Negating the effects of 25­

Lake Erie, McGahee led 
Buffalo's ball-control offense 
with a career-high 132 yards 
rushing and a touchdown in the 
Bills 22-17 win over the New 
York Jets on Sunday. 
"He can run," left tackle 
Jonas Jennings said. "He's got 
vision. Our job is to get him 
past the first level. And he and 
the receivers do the rest." 
McGahee continued to down­play his string of ·strong per­formances, the starter in all three victories for Buffalo (3-5), ·in which he's had 100 or more 
yards each time. 
"We're all getting comfortable 
right now," said McGahee, who 
supplanted Travis Henry as the 
starter two weeks ago. "We 
know what it takes to win. And 
we know what we have to do." 
McGahee's 37 carries tied him 
for second most in a game in 
franchise history, and most 
since Thurman Thomas had 37 
on Nov. 8, 1992 against 
Pittsburgh; O.J. Simpson, with

Tampa Bay 34, Kansas City 
31 
All week long, Jon Gruden 
kept telling his offense it could 
keep pace with the high-scoring 
Kansas City Chiefs. 
It turns out the Tampa Bay 
coach was right. 
"Nobody was talking about us 
as an offense. lt was just 
Kansas City's offense vs. our 
defense," running back Michael 
Pittman said after the 
Buccaneers held off the potent 
Chiefs Sunday. 
Pittman scored three touch­
downs, including one on a 
team-record 78-yard run, to 
give the Bucs {3-5) consecutive 
victories for just the second 
time since they won the Super Bowl two years ago. 

"Coach told us to keep quiet and just go in there and do what we've got to do and show everybody we're for real, too," Pittman said. 
The Chiefs (3-5) totaled 101 points and 1,130 yards in victo­ries over Atlanta and Indianapolis the previous two weeks, and put up another big day statistically despite playing much of the second half without star running back Priest Holmes. 
Trent Green threw for 369 yards and three touchdowns, but was intercepted by Jermaine Phillips in the end zone with under six minutes to go. Green was sacked on con­secutive plays to end Kansas City's last threat near midfield. 
Washington 17, Detroit 10 
Clinton Portis has run for more than 100 yards three times this season. Those are the only games Washington has won. 
Coincidence? "No, I wouldn't think so," Redskins coach Joe Gibbs said. 
The star running back not only beat Detroit with his legs, he also put his right arm to use. 
Portis ran for 14 7 yards on 34 carries and threw a tiebreaking touchdown pass to lead the Redskins to a victory over the Lions on Sunday. 
Detroit rallied late, but its hopes for a tying drive ended at the Washington 20 as time expired. 
"Too little. Too late," Lions coach Steve Mariucci said. 
With back-to-hack 21-yard gains to open the second half, Portis became the first player to run for 100 yards against Detroit this season. Those pow­erful runs with sharp cutbacks set up his 15-yard pass to Laveranues Coles that gave Washington a 10-3 lead. 
"It was a dream of mine, it started when I was 8," Portis said of the first pass he's eyer thrown. "I was in (Gibbs') ear all week about it. We ran sweeps, we ran tosses and they were expecting one of those. 
"I told (Coles) I needed this for my quarterback rating."

Cooper both had successful returns to Carolina. Yet one left town satisfied, while the other was downright sad he had to go. 
Emotions aside, things are going so wrong for the Panthers that even their castoffs are making them look bad. 
Collins led the game-winning scoring drive and Cooper notched the first sack of his career to lead the Oakland Raiders to a 27-24 victory over Carolina on Sunday. 
Collins, the first-ever draft pick in Carolina history, was vilified when he left -quitting the team midway through the 1998 season. 
Even though he was just aver­age in his first game against the Panthers, the win snapped a five-game losing streak for the Raiders (3-6) and was sweet satisfaction for Collins. 
Cincinnati 26, Dallas 3 
The only thing bold about this offense was the jerseys. 
Playing it close to the vest in their new orange threads, the Cincinnati Bengals pulled off the game's only big play -a 7 6-yard to,uchdown pass to Matt Schobel -and beat the bumbling Dallas Cowboys . 
It was fitting that a tight end who spent most of the season blocking broke open the game. Neither team wanted to open it up with their quarterbacks ­one about to turn 41, the other still a novice. 
"With a young quarterback, we've been staying in a lot and protecting," said Schobel, who had only 11 catches in the first seven games. "We always say that when we have a chance, let's make the most of it." San Diego 43, New Orleans 17 
These clearly are not the San Diego Chargers of the recent gloomy past. 
They can pass. They can catch. They can play defense. And even with LaDainian Tomlinson hurting, they can win big. 
In routing the New Orleans Saints on Sunday, they even showed a bit of a swagger. 
"We go on the field and say, 'We can beat these guys,"' quarterback Drew Brees said. "That's our attitude. It's such a dramatic difference from last year. We're almost disappointed that the bye's coming because we just want to keep going."

NFL 
Dolphins fall just short 
Associated Press 
MIAMI -Eight seconds· into the game, the Arizona Cardinals lost a fumble. They sputtered on offense, com­mitted nine penalties and blew a late lead. 
The Miami Dolphins played even worse. 
Ending a 17-game road los­ing streak, the Cardinals met their match in ineptitud c. They benefited from two piv­otal second-half calls and drove 70 yards in the final 2 minutes for a touchdown to beat the Dolphins 24-23 Sunday. 
Larry Fitzgerald caught the winning score on a 2-yard pass from Josh McCown with 19 seconds left after a hold­ing penalty against Miami negated a sack and gave the. Cardinals first and goal. 
"That's how hard it is to win on the road," Cardinals first-year coach Dennis Green said. "You hope to have good fortune smile on you and catch lightning in a bottle, and today that hap­pened for us." 
The road win was the first since Oct. 6, 2002 for Arizona (3-5). Chicago 28, N.Y. Giants 21 
The Chicago Bears stole the New York Giants' early-sea­son formula for success ­again and again and ... 
The Bears forced five turnovers, including three consecutive plays in a 20­point explosion late in the first half, in beating the Giants on Sunday. 
Hookie Craig Krenzel threw a 35-yard touchdown pass to ignite the rally and Anthony Thomas scored on runs 4 and 41 yards as Chicago (3-5) won its second straight game and handed the Giants (5-3) their second straight embar­rassing home loss. 
What made the defeat more frustrating was NFC East leader Philadelphia (7 -1) lost earlier in the day. The Giants also have to worry about a pectoral injury to All-Pro defensive end Michael Strahan, who left in the third quarter. 
Seattle 42, San Francisco 
27 
Simplicity agrees with the Seattle Seahawks. Their stripped-down game plan was still too complicated for the San Francisco 49ers. 
Darrell Jackson caught two long touchdown passes from Matt Hasselbeck, and Shaun Alexander rushed for 160 yards and two scores in the Seahawks' victory. 
Jackson had five catches for 114 yards on a sprained ankle, and Koren Robinson also caught a TD pass for the Seahawks (5-3}, who stayed atop the NFC West with their second victory following three straight losses. 
Denver 31, Houston 13 
Rod Smith caught the histo­ry-making touchdown, turned to the stands and handed the ball to his sister. For the hard-working Broncos receiver, that was about as big as the celebra­tion would get. 
Smith became Denver's career leader in both recep­tions and touchdown catches Sunday and Jake Plummer threw for four scores to help the Broncos snap a two-game losing streak with a victory over the Houston Texans. 
"'It's a privilege to be on the same field as that guy," Plummer said of Smith, a 1 0­year veteran who started out as an undrafted rookie and spent his first year on Denver's practice squad. 
Smith, a man of few words who held a rare news confer­ence after. his landmark game, insisted the win was more important to him than the records, and maybe he was right. 
The Broncos (6-3) stayed tied with San Diego for the AFC West lead and, more importantly, they avoided heading into their bye next week on a three-game losing streak. 
New England 40, St. Louis 22 
Adam Vinatieri beat the St. Louis Rams with his leg in the 2002 Super Bowl. This time, he used his leg and his arm.· 
New England's placekicker hit a season-best four field goals, then threw his first career touchdown pass on a fake to Troy Brown to help the Patriots bounce back from their only loss with a victory Sunday. 
"You kind of hope to get these guys sleeping a little bit, and we did," Vinatieri said. "Troy kind of hid out on the side and we snapped the ball before they noticed him." 
Corey Dillon returned after a one-week absence with 112 yards rushing on 25 carries and a touchdown for the Patriots, whcse 21-game winning streak ended in a loss to Pittsburgh last week.

NBA 
Nuggets struggling to find their game 

Associated Press 
DENVER -In an elevator with his entourage just after halftime, Denver Broncos cornerback Champ Bailey was asked why he was leaving the Nuggets' game so early. 
"It's a bad show, man," he replied. Bailey isn't the only one who thinks so. 
The surprise of the NBA a year ago, the Denver Nuggets have been surprisingly bad this sea­son. With a stagnant offense and not much more movement on defense, the Nuggets arc 1-2 and hearing it from the hometown fans. 
"We're just not playing, plain and simple," point guard Earl Boykins said. 
The once-woeful Nuggets had a breakout season in 2003-04, fin­ishing 43-39 to reach the playoffs for the first time in nine years. This from a team that won 17 games the year before. The bar was raised even higher this sea­son because Denver added All­Star power forward Kenyon Martin and kept just about every­body else. 
But the Nuggets were woeful in an 11-point loss at the Los Angeles Lakers in the opener, eked out a sloppy victory against Minnesota on Thursday, then were booed off their home court following Saturday's 106-82 loss to Utah. 
And it doesn't get mu~h easier. Next up is another game against the Jazz, followed by Seattle, defending champion Detroit and a road game against Sacramento. 
Making matters worse, the Nuggets lost shooting guard Voshon Lenard for the season whnn he tore his Achilles' tnndon

against the Lakers. Outside shooting was already a weak point. 
Denver used DerMarr Johnson as Lenard's replacement against the Timberwolves, but he wasn't much of a factor, managing two points· in 15 minutes. The Nuggets switched to defensive­minded Greg Buckner against the Jazz and had similar results from him _four points in 17 minutes. 
With no one hitting shots from the perimeter for the Nuggets, opponents have been able to pack the paint against the Nugget.;;. 
One of the league's top-5 scor­ing teams a year ago, the Nuggets rank 27th at 84.6 points a game -13 fewer than last year. Denver also has failed to shoot 40 percent in all three games and is at 37.3 for the sea­son, third-worst in the league. 
"We've abandoned everything we worked on in the preseason in terms of sharing and moving. and playing together as a team with energy," coach Jeff Bzdelik said. 
Part of the problem is that the Nuggets have had a hard time getting into their offense, stand­ing around until someone is forced to create something one­on-one. 
Denver also hasn't been able to get out and run, a strong point last season, when it averaged 19 fast-break points. The Nuggets scored 28 against Minnesota but managed just 17 combined in the two losses. 
"Everyone understands this team is built to run, it's built to move," general manager Kiki Vandeweghe said. "It's a matter of 'OK, how do we get guys do that?"' 
Playing better defense might help.

NFL 

Associated Press 
PITTSBURGH --The Pittsburgh Steelers made certain there's nobody unbeaten now in the NFL, except for Ben Roethlis­berger. 
The Steelers combined their still-flawless new quarterback with a touch of the old -a Jerome Bettis of yesteryear and a defense that was Steel Curtain-tough -to domi­nate the Philadelphia Eagles 27-3 Sunday and leave the NFL without an undefeated team. 
The Steelers (7 -1) ended the Eagles' seven-game winning streak a week after halting New Eng­land's record 21-game win­ning streak with an equally impressive 34-20 victory. Pittsburgh is the only team in NFL history to stop unbeaten teams in consec­utive weeks after each had won at least six games. 
"Nobody ever thought we'd do this," said Hines Ward, who scored the first two touchdowns. "We're giving defensive coordina­tors heck trying to figure out what we're going to do, with weapons all over the field and a quarterback who just keeps getting bet­ter." 
How much better can Big Ben get than this? 
 

Roeth1isberger is 6-0 as a starter -the first rookie since the 1970 merger to do that since Pittsburgh's Mike Kruczek filled in for an injured Terry Bradshaw in 1976. 
Here's the difference: Kruczek didn't throw a TD pass all season on a team that won behind the Steel Curtain; Hoethlisberger (11 of 18, 183 yards, two touchdowns) has thrown for 11 touchdowns while playing with the polish and growing confidence of a much more experienced player. 
"He's remarkable," Eag­les linebacker Mark Simon­eau said. "Look at him on 
the field and he doesn't 
look like a rookie, he looks 
like a guy who's been 
around four or five years. 
Give the guy credit, he 
made plays all day long." 
Roethlisberger drove the 
Steelers to a 21-0 lead on 
their. first three possessions 
with the help of Bettis' 149 
yards, his 55th career 1 00­
yard game. The 1978 
Steelers were the only 
other team in franchise 
history to start 7-1, en . 
route to a 14-2 record and ..a Super Bowl title. 
Ward scored on the first 
two drives, a 16-yard 
reverse and a 20-yard 
reception, then playfully 
mocked the Eagles ( 7-1) . 

IN BRIEF 
Chang tops NCAA career passinf! list 
HON01.ULU -Timmy Chang remPmbers all too well when he was booed and benched at I lawaii. 
Now he has not only cemented his legac~ at the school, but he has left his mark on all of college football. He moved to the top of the NCAA career list for yards passing, breaking the record of 15,031 set by BYU's Ty Detmer from 1988-91. 
The milestone came on a 7-yard scoring pass in the first quarter of Hawaii's 34-23 victory over Louisiana Tech on Saturday. He received a standing ovation for sev­eral minutes and was presented with the ball. 
"It was very special," Chang said. "I can remember not too long ago, I got booed." 
He finished the game with four touchdowns and 285 yards. The fifth-year senior from Honolulu has 15,303 yards with at least four games remaining. 
Bills Williams driven off 
field in ambulance 
OHCHAHD PARK. N.Y.-Bills right tackle Mike Williams suffered a neck injury and was driven ofT the field in an ambulance during the third quar­ter of Buffalo's 22-17 victory over the New York Jets on Sunday. 
Williams was walking around with a neck brace following the game. He also had X-rays taken that were neg­ative, but the Bills remained cau­tious. 
"He'll be looked at again after 24 hours," coach Mike Mularkey said. 
Williams appeared to be knocked cold when he and left tackle Jonas Jennings were protecting quarter­back Drew Bledsoe, double-teaming Jets defensive end Shaun Ellis. As Bledsoe released the pass, Ellis bowled over Jennings, knocking him into Williams, who awkwardly fell backward. 
Williams lay face down and motionless at the Bills 10 as team trainers and emergency officials tended to him. He· was lifted onto a stretcher and had his helmet strapped in place. The Bills announced that trainers were taking precautionary measures to proteet Williams' neck. Goosen overtakes Woods in 
Tour Championship 
ATLANTA -Retief Goosen defied the odds at every turn Sunday in the Tour Championship. 
No one makes birdie on the 481­yard 16th hole, especially not from the rough. Goosen smoked a 5-iron from 195 yards that dropped in front of the flag and stopped 3 feet away. 
And no one comes from four shots behind Tiger Woods in the final round to win. 
"We all thought he was going to be the guy to beat," Goosen said. 
In a fitting finale to the PGA Tour season, Goosen was unflappable as ever in closing with a bogey-free 64 to win the Tour Championship by four shots and become only the third player to overtake Woods in the final.

ND dominates Iowa for first win ever against the Hawkeyes 
... 

By RAMA GOTTUMUKKALA Sports Writer 
This weekend, the Irish fin­ished the job. 
After coming one .relay win short on a bid to upset No. 22 Brigham Young last weekend, a team the Irish have never defeated, the Irish (3-1) domi­nated Iowa 176-118 Saturday. 
It was the first victory in a dual meet against a Big Ten opponent since 2002 and the its first ever against Iowa. Using commanding perform­ances in the freestyle events to set the tone, the Irish leapt to an early lead that they never relinquished. 


"It was a big win for us," Irish coach Tim Welsh said. "Our distance freestyle lracesJ still continued to lead the way, but the difference in the meet was that all our freestyle races were strong." 
Sophomore Ted Brown led the way for the Irish with vic­tories in both the 200 and 500­yard freestyle races. Brown won the 200-meter freestyle for the third meet in a row, with a time of 1 minute, 42.30 seconds, and he later led a 1­2-3 finish for the Irish in the 500-meter freestyle, winning with a time of 4:35.46. 
"Our depth has been a key to our succe.ss this season, and it really showed this past week­end as we were able to dis­tance ourselves from Iowa in the freestyle events," Brown said. "Each meet, we've had different swimmers step up and help us get the job done." 
Notre Dame outscored Iowa 82-30 in the freestyle events as the 50-yard freestyle was the only freestyle race in which the Hawkeyes managed to snatch away a first-place finish from the Irish. The team took 1-2-3 finishes in the 200-meter freestyle, the 500-meter freestyle and took all four top spots in the 100 free. 
Sophomore Louis Cavadini won the 100 free with a time of 46.68, while senior Frank Krakowski took second in 
47.04. Sophomore Nick Fanslau took third with a time of 47.29 and.junior Tim Randolph completed the sweep with a time of 47.90. 
"One important feature that's emerging is that we're able to sustain our consistency across the full program of events," Welsh said. "We've been talk­we like that balance.

Irish tie Bowling Green 4-4 
By JUSTIN SCHUVER Associate Sports Editor 
It's not every day that a team 
is upset about tying a game in 
the last three seconds, yet 
that's exactly how Notre Dame 
{1-5-3, 0-4-2 in the CCI lA) felt 
after its 4-4 tie with Bowling 
Green (4-1-1, 2-1-1) Friday 
night at the Joyce Center. 
"Normally you would be happy with a tie that close to the end of the game, but we were disappointed with how the game ended since we'd played so well," Irish coach Dave Poulin said. "I told our guys that when you're strug­gling as a team, sometimes you don't always win right away even when you're playing bet­ter." 
The Irish sent a season-high 54 shots on net Friday, but Falcon goalie Jordan Sigalet turned away 50 of them ­including 28 in the second peri­od. Notre Dame goalie Morgan Cey faced only 23 shots in the game. 
Notre Dame jumped out to a 3-0 lead, and then saw the Falcons come back to make the score 4-3 late in the game. Sophomore defenseman Wes O'Neill picked up the equalizer with just three seconds remain­ing in the game, with Cey pulled for an extra attacker. 
It was O'Neill's second goal of the game, and came on a deflection of a Chris Trick shot from the right point. 
"I thought Friday night might have been Wcs' best game in an Irish uniform," Poulin said. "Wes doesn't take a shift off, he plays hard the entire game." 
The four goals scored by the Irish were a season high, with Cory McLean and Evan Rankin picking up the other tallies. McLean also picked up assists on one of O'Neill's goals and on Rankin's marker, giving the senior captain three points in the game. 


"Cory McLean really stepped up his game in a big way for us Friday," Poulin said. 
The Falcons got goals from James Unger, Ben Geelan, John Mazzei and Derek Whitmore. 
McLean's goal put the Irish ahead 1-0 at 3:07 of the first period, as the forward received a crisp pass from Mike Walsh and took a shot from the slot that deflected past Sigalet. 
O'Neill gave the Irish a two­goal lead just a little more than six minutes later, sending a hard slapshot past Sigalet. Both of Notre Dame's first two goals came on the power play, making the first time all season the Irish have scored two or more power-play goals in a game. 
Rankin scored his second goal of the season at_ 4:11 of the second period off assists from Walsh and McLean. The goal only riled up the Falcons, who then came back to score four unanswered goals -two off the power play. 
The Irish avoided their sec­ond loss to the Falcons, only because of O'Neill's late-game heroics. 
"It was a disappointing out­come for us," Poulin said. "We did so many things well. We had guys in front of the net and tons of chances all over the ice. There were definitely a lot of positives we can take from this game." 
The Irish travel to Western Michigan this weekend to take on the Broncos in a two-game series.

"We were focused and knew they were a good team~" Buczkowski said. "We were ready to play." 
To open the second half, Notre Dame was able to break the deadlock after Jones scored her first goal of the season. 
Thorlakson kicked the ball to the left side of the box to set up Jones for the goal in the second minute of the second half. 
However, the Huskies were able to respond in the 73rd minute of the game to tie the score 1-1. 
"When the score was tied 1­1, we knew we had to keep playing and get the ball back 

and  move  it  around,"  
Buczkowski  said.  "But  we  
never did that."  

The Irish continued to strug­gle offensively and Connecticut took .advantage of this with three minutes left in regulation. The Huskies scored on Irish goalkeeper Erika Bohn for the 2-1 lead. 
"We were in shock that it happened at the end of the game back-to-hack," Jones said. "We didn't have enough time in the game to come back." 
Despite the loss, the Irish are aware of the challenges each team will bring in the NCAA tournament. Notre Dame is hoping this loss will give the team inspiration for the remained of the postseason. 
"We had respect for Connecticut and knew they could beat us on any given day," Jones said. "It will give us a little fire for the NCAA cham­pionship." Notre Dame 2, Boston College 0 
Friday, Notre Dame had an imprl~ssive win over Boston College in the semifinals. 
Heading into the conference championship weekend, the Irish were aware of the poten­tial challenges from their con­ference rivals. 

"We knew this was going to be a big weekend," midfielder Ashley Jones said. "We came out hard against Boston College and wanted to control the game just in case anything hap­pened." 
Seton Hall's Matt 
Salotti put the Pirates in front, 8-7, in the eighth round, Norman was unable to answer for the Irish, blasting his attempt over the crossbar. 
While Clark and the Irish obviously would have preferred to move on in the Big East Championships and defend the conference tournament title they earned last season, the upset isn't without a silver lin­ing. 
The Irish now have additional time to prepare for the NCAA tournament, scheduled to begin in two weeks. 
"To be perfectly honest, I would liked·to have won," Clark said. "It would have been nice if we had gone [to Piscataway, 
N.J. for the Big East Championships s~mifinals], but it lets us catch up with studies and hopefully get ready to make a run in the NCAA tournament." 
In the end, while important, the conference tournament is just a stepping stone to the national tournament. 
"If you said to me which tour­nament would you rather progress in -the Big East or the NCAA's -that question doesn't even need to be answered," Clark said. "We've just got to move on an.d use the time at hand to get ready for the tournament." 
In excellent position for a first-round bye, the Irish will now wait for the NCAA Division I men's soccer selection show, slated for Nov. 15 at 4:30 p.m.

Pirates send top-seeded Irish home in first round ofBig East Tournament 

By MATT PUGLISI Sports Writer 

They play the games for a reason. 
While all signs pointed to the Big East Championships with first-seeded Notre Dame (13-2-3) putting away vis­iting eighth-seeded Seton Hall (11-6-2} and moving onto the tournament's semifinals next weekend, the result didn't follow expectations as the Pirates upset No. 4 Notre Dame 8-7 on penalty kicks after battling to a 0-0 tie through regulation and a pair of over­times Saturday night at Alumni Field. 
"It's annoying when you tie a game but go out a game," Irish coach Bobby Clark said...It counts as a tie, but unfortunately you get eliminated with the penalty kicks." 
After having trouble generating scoring chances early -the Irish recorded only a single shot in the game's opening 20 minutes -mid­fielder Nate Norman nearly put Notre Dame in front with 16 minutes remaining in the first half, drilling the ball just over the crossbar from the top of the box.

Irish fall to Huskies in 
Eagles take conference win 
Notre Dame falls to Boston College in 3-0 defeat
championship finals 

By ANN LOUGHERY Sports Writer 

This weekend's Big East con­
ference matches proved to be 
bittersweet for Notre Dame. 

The Irish (14-7, 7-1} regis­
tered a key conference win · against Connecticut on Friday 3­1, but fell to Boston College 0-3 in a heartbreaking loss on 
Sunday. 

"It was a huge letdown fbr us, 
losing to (Boston College]," Irish 
coach Debbie Brown said. 
..There wasn't any aspect of the 
game we did well in." 

In contrast to Sunday's Boston 
College match, Friday's home 
crowd saw a team poised for 
victory take the courts against 
Connecticut (16-8, 5-2). The 
Irish dominated the net with a 
.345 hitting percentage. 

Ashley Tarutis totaled 44 
assists, five kills, and racked up 
a . 714 hitting percentage. But Tarutis's contributions were not limited to offensive plays. The freshman also chipped in 11 digs for her seventh double-dou­ble. 
Juniors Lauren Kelbley and Lauren Brewster, freshman Adrianna Stasiuk, and senior Emily Loomis each finished with more than 10 kills to lead the Irish offensive effort. Kelblcy had a match-high 16 kills on .387 hitting although she sat out the first 30 points of the third game when Notre Dame's advantage in the matchup was apparent.· 
The team's defense kept Connecticut in check, limiting their opponents .162 on attack percentage. Stasiuk added a season-best 18 digs, while junior captain Meg Henican finished with 17. Sophomore Danielle Herndon and Brewster also notched nine digs each. 
On defense, the Irish finished with 12 blocks for the match.

Defense steps up in hardfought 17-13 win over No.9 Volunteers 
By JUSTIN SCHUVER Associate Sports Editor 
KNOXVILLE, Tenn. Tennessee made only one big mistake against Notre Dame Saturday. But it proved costly. 
With 6:46 left in the third quarter, Irish linebacker Mike Goolsby intercepted Tenn­essee quarterback Rick Clausen's desperation pass and returned it 26 yards for a touchdown to give Notre Dame a 14-10 lead. 
Goolsby's first career touch­down would prove the game­winning score, helping the Irish to a 17-13 win over the No. 9 Volunteers. 
"Our offense was struggling a little bit, and we really felt like the defense was going to have to score," Goolsby said. "If it wasn't me, it was going to be someone else. The guys really stepped up and made plays when they had to today." 
Tennessee collected 327 yards of total offense, com­pared to 216 yards for the Irish, but it was Notre Dame who proved victorious -with an opportunistic defense prov­ing a major factor in that win. The victory makes the Irish bowl-eligible for this season. 
"I've always said there's no better time than now," Irish head coach Tyrone Willingham said abou·t his team's goal to make the Irish eligible for postseason play. "We really felt a sense of urgency and knew we needed to get it done. 
"Now we can start to estab­lish the level of play we want heading into the bowl game." 
Among the players who made big plays was Irish defensive end Justin Tuck, whose sack of Tennessee quarterback Eric Ainge in the second quarter gave Tuck the Irish career record for sacks with 23.5 -he would add a second sack later in the quar­ter to increase his mark to 
24.5 sacks. 
Irish linebacker Brandon Hoyte sacked Ainge during the final play of the second quar­ter, and the true freshman landed awkwardly on his shoulder and had to be helped off the field at halftime. 
Ainge proved unable to fin­ish the game, and Clausen, Tennessee's third-string quar­

terback, came in to replace the starter. Alternate quarter­back Brent Schaeffer was unavailable for the game, after breaking his collarbone in the third quarter of Tenneessee's game against South Carolina on Oct. 30. 
Ainge will miss at least the 
Notre Dame got off to a sluggish start, punting after just five plays on its opening drive and then allowing Tennessee to march 57 yards down the field for a 30-yard field goal by James Wilhoit ­giving the Volunteers an ini­

5:16 left in the first quarter. 
Notre Dame looked as if it 
would go into the half with a 
lead, but the Irish defense fell 
apart with 2:47 left in the sec­
ond quarter. 
Volunteer running back Cedric Houston caught a short screen pass from Ainge and then broke several tackles on his way to a 56-yard touch­down. 
"I was really disappointed in that screen play we allowed," Irish defensive coordinator Kent Baer said. "We missed about four or five tackles. We said at halftime that we were going to go back and stay with our game plan and it worked out for us." 
Clausen's interception to Goolsby proved costly, but the junior did not quit and came back two drives later to com­plete a 39-yard pass to Robert Meachem on the way to a 33­yard Wilhoit field goal -cut­ting the Irish lead to 14-13 with 1 : 2 8 Ieft in the third quarter. 
The Irish made some breathing room in the fourth quarter, putting together a 11-play, 43-yard drive that culminated with D.J. Fitzpatrick's 39-yard field goal with 7:23 left. 
The Irish defense held strong, stopping the Tennessee offense the rest of the game and forcing the Volunteers into a fourth-and­18 situation with 1 :22 left in the game. Clausen's pass failed, and the Irish were able to kneel out the clock. 
"Every win against a top team is big," Willingham said. "We have played hard enough to win every game this year, but we need to learn to be more consistent."

thought: if only. 
If only this team had not fallen apart against a mediocre-at­best Boston College team. If only the Irish were prepared for their season-opener against BYU. If only Notre Dame had come into Neyland Stadium with a 7-1 record to beat the red-hot Volunteers. 
Because if all of those hypotheti­cal situations were true, Saturday's win over Tennessee arguably would have been the biggest victo­ry for Notre Dame since Lou Holtz beat Florida State in 1993. And coachr,s, players and fans every­where would be talking about tak­ing care of Pittsburgh, knocking No.1 USC off its pedestal and going to a BCS bowl. 
Students would be dusting off their "Return to Glory" T-shirts. Notre Dame, in every way, would be back. 
There would be no more cries for a coaching change, no references 
to Irish futility like the one in a Rick Reilly "Sports Illustrated" col­umn: "Against Notre Dame, I'd take us and the points. But that's just me." . 
But inconsistency has cost Notre Dame dearly this season, and even a 17-13 statement win over Tennessee cannot elevate the 2004 Irish to their traditional goal­greatness. 
Yes, Notre Dame is only one of two teams to have beaten two top­1 0 teams this season along with Auburn. 
Yes, the win makes Notre Dame bowl eligible. And a who converted the mistake into six points. 
All the same, the 2004 Notre Dame football team remains an enigma. 
The run defense has been consis­tent and superb. But the pass defense has been woeful [see Purdue]. The passing game has made not only strides but leaps, yet the offense sputters. The run­ning game has been inconsistent, congruent with the play of the offensive line.

Goolsby leads defense by example 
By PAT LEONARD Associate Sports Editor 
KNOXVILLE, Tenn.-Mike Goolsby's 
third-quarter touchdown did more 
than a·dd points. 
The score gave Notre Dame a lead it 
would hold the rest of the game to 
upset No. 9 Tennessee. It was 
Goolsby's first career touchdown. 
And with these factors and the 
adrenaline created by a capacity 
107 ,000-plus crowd, Goolsby didn't 
even think to shuffle his feet in the 
end zone? 
"I can't dance," Goolsby said. He may not dance, but he changes games. 
Goolsby led all tacklers in Saturday's game with 14 tackles, eight solo. His interception proved to be the differ­ence in earning Notre Dame's first road win over a top-1 0 opponent in eight years. 
"We were talking in the hotel last night about how this was going to be one of those games where it was going to be a big-time game coming down to big-time players,'! Goolsby said: "It's just great to be a part of it." . 
Goolsby was one of those great play­ers Saturday. 
On Sunday, the Walter Camp Football Foundation named Goolsby its National Defensive Player of the Week. Along with his 14 tackles, Goolsby had two tackles for a loss and one sack as the Irish beat their first top-1 0 team on the road since a 27-24 victory at No. 6 Texas on Sept. 21, 1996. 
But the interception loomed largest. 
"That was a huge play, because with that we had a chance to start to gain control of the football game," head coach Tyrone Willingham said. "What was really spectacular was that the pressure on the quarterback came with a three-man rush, and Mike was there to step up and make the play." 
The defensive line played particular­ly well Saturday. Justin Tuck made eight tackles and recorded two sacks. Nose guard Derek Landri finished with four tackles and one for a loss, and also provided the primary quarterback pressure that led to Goolsby's inter­ception. 
But Goolsby-joined by the tandem of linebackers Brandon Hoyte (11 tackles Saturday) and Derek Curry (eight) -has been arguably the most productive player on the defense this season. 
Coming into the Tennessee game, 
Tuck sets career sack record at ND 
By JUSTIN SCHUVER Associate Sports Editor 
KNOXVILLE, Tenn. -With his sack of Erik Ainge in the second quarter of Notre Dame's 17-13 victory over Tennessee on Saturday, Irish defensive end Justin Tuck made his ·mark in the record books. 
Tuck's sack gave him 23.5 for his career, breaking Kory Minor's record of 22.5 sacks. 
"That was a fun matchup," Tuck said. "We knew that their strength was the offen­sive line and that one of our strengths was the defensive line." 
The Kellyton, Ala. native would add another sack later in the game, allowing him to increase the record in front of over 20 family members and friends who made the trip up to Knoxville to watch Tuck play. Something to prove 
Notre Dame's two wins over ranked opponerrts in the 2004 season have both come immediately after losses to unranked opponents. 
The Irish defeated then-No. 7 Michigan Sept. 11, after losing to BYU the week before. Notre Dame fell 24­2 3 to Boston Gellege two weeks ago, but was able to bounce back with a big win over the No. 9 Volunteers Saturday. 
"It's always against human nature to want to prove peo­ple wrong, and to do some­thing they don't expect," Irish head coach Tyrone Willingham said. "I hope we have the ability to go with the grain as well as against it." 
Stopping the run 
Notre Dame's defense held Tennessee to 58 net yards rushing and a 1.5-yard aver­age per carry for the game. 
The win Saturday marked the sixth time this season that the Irish have held an opponent to fewer than 100 yards in game. Notre Dame is 3-3 in those games. 
"Shutting down their run­ning game was the main thing we wanted to do," Irish defensive baek Dwight Ellick said. "When you shut down a team's rushing abilities you make them one-dimensional. 
"We wanted to come in here and dominate the line or scrimmage and shut down the run, and we feel like we did that." 
Making a stand 
The Irish did not allow Tennessee to convert any of its three fourth-down conver­sion attempts in Saturday's game, a fact that proved a major difference in Notre Dame's defeat of the Volunteers. 
Notre Dame's first fourth­down stop came with 7:37 in the second quarter and the ball on the Ir:ish 35-yard line. Tennessee quarterback Erik Ainge threw an incomplete pass on fourth-and-7 and the Irish took over possession of the ball. 
The team's biggest stop might have come in the fourth quarter, with the score 14-13 in favor of Notre Dame and the Volunteers driving. On fourth-and-one from the Irish 34-yard line, Tennessee quarterback Hick Clausen handled off the ball to run­ning back Gerald Riggs, Jr., who was hit immediately by linebacker Brandon Boyte and ended up short of the first-down marker. 
"That might have been the game," Irish defensive coor­dinator Kent Baer said. "We had a pretty good idea what they were doing and !Brandon] really stepped and made a big play right there." 
The Irish immediately took over and drove down the field for a 39-yard field goal by D.J. fitzpatrick, giving Notre Dame a 17-13 lead. Notre Dame's final fourth­down stop came on the final Tennessee drive of the game, when Clausen's pass to Jayson Swain on fourth-and­18 fell incomplete with 1 :22 remaining. Game captains 
Captains Saturday for the Irish were Tuck, running back Ryan Grant, lineback~r Mike Goolsby and offensive lineman Mark LeVoir.

Irish linebacker Mike Goolsby rumbles toward the endzone after picking off Tennessee's Rick Clausen in the third quarter Saturday. 
Goolsby led Notre Dame in tackles with 70. The closest Irish defender behind him, free safety Quentin Burrell, had 52. 
Goolsby's third-quarter interception, then, satisfied a team frustrated by dominant offenses. 
"It feels good to be more aggressive on defense and not just sit back and let them take your defense apart," Goolsby said. 
The senior gave credit to his defen­sive coaches' aggressive game plan, as well, while defensive coordinator Kent Baer understood his leader's contribu­tion. 
"Goolsby did a nice job," defensive coordinator Kent Baer said. "We were in man coverage there, and he did a nice job of jumping the [running] back. The quarterback probably shouldn't have thrown the ball, but that's part of football." 
Opponents now know they should find the number 41 before any play ­run or pass.

SOUTHERN COOKIN' 
Notre Dame's defense held strong Saturday, makin~ up for an offensive 
attack that only collected 216 total yards -with 141 of those yards coming in the first quarter. Brady Quinn's touchdown pass to Anthony Fasano in the first quarter was the only Irish offensive touchdown, but Mike Goolsby's 26­yard interception return for a touchdown gave the Irish much-needed breathing room against the No.9 Volunteers. Tennessee's rushing game was stopped in its tracks, and Irish defenders picked up five sacks in the victory. 



Clockwise from top left to bottom left, Anthony Fasano catches the ball for a touchdown. Irish defensive end Justin Tuck shakes hands with Tennessee running back Gerald Riggs, Jr., after the game. Mike Goolsby and Derek Curry sack Tennessee quarterback Erik Ainge. Irish running back Darius Walker breaks free of the Tennessee defense for a big gain. Brandon Hoyte, Preston Jackson and Mike Goolsby take down Riggs. Irish quarterback Brady Quinn is hurried by Tennessee's Robert Boulware.
