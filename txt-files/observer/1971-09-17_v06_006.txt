'Changing for tbe better' 
Reuss: Outlook good
by Mary Sue Horvat _ 
The ecological outlook is bright for the decade of the 70's according to Congressman Henry Reuss, speaking in the Library Auditorium last night on Ecology and Politics. 
Congressman Reuss, of the fifth Congressional District of Wisconsin, is the Chairman of the House Conservation and Natural Resources Committee. He is also a member of the Sub­Committee on Conservation. 
Congressman Reuss opened his lecture with the encouraging prediction that the decade of the 70's is "changing for the better." It is his belief that our environment is improving because "young people who care about the environment and demand that pollution be stopped. They do this by chiding politicians into passing laws and evolving new ways of living. They find out how to live in harmony with nature instead of fighting it." 
The House Sub-Committee works on enforcing pollution laws and "digging out laws previously passed" on pollution. One such law was uncovered last year by the committee; the Refuse Act of 1899. The law stated that "Whosoever discharges refuse into lakes or rivers shall be guilty of the crime and fined $2500 a day; and whoever informs the law of this person will receive a sum of half the fine." Congressman Reuss' Committee has been working on kits instructing how to use the Refuse Act. 12,000 of these have been distributed. These kits also inform about Industrial Pollution and procedures in court against offenders.

An attempt to clear the air 
between the Board of Trustees 
and the Student Life Council was 
m de Thursday when 
representatives of the SLC met 
with J.:dmund Stephan in the 
Center for Continuing Education. 
The discussion centered around 
St£>phan's letter to the SLC 
Chairman. Professor William 
J.:gan. 
"Parietals seem to be the big issue," Eagan said. He added that the SLC must come up with some sort of guidelines and sanctions concerning parietal and drinking rules.

position because they had to consider both the moral and public relations implications of the problem. 
Barkett said, "The Trustees are responsible for the Univer­sity. How they view their responsibilitites and how we view ours when visitation hours are the question results in two dif­ferent interpretations." 
Barkett also voiced his opinion that most of the Notre Dame students were responsible enough to handle themselves with regard to parietals. 
Both Stephan and Barkett agreed that the crux of the problem was a generation gap. f''urther talks are planned to discuss the problem.

The Hall Presideuts Council Thursday claimed the Trustee call for stricter enforcement of parietal and alcohol rules has slowed progress towards a campus spirit of hall community. 
"We feel that the recent action of the Board of Trustees has greatly impeded our progress towards a campus-wide spirit of hall community," the council wrote in a letter given Stephan yesterday. 
The letter given to Board Chairman Edmund Stephan, expressed the council's belief in student responsibility which could be enhanced by close cooperation between the SLC and the HPC. 
"We feel the implementation of our suggestions and closer· communication and cooperation between the Hall Presidents and the SLC would foster an attitude within the halls that would be more workable from both the Trustees' and the students' points of view," the HPC letter con­tinued. 

"For true community spirit to exist. .. students must have a significant role in the formulation of policy which most fun­damentally governs their lives," they added. 
First Meeting 

Stephan met with the HPC, the first such meeting between the two, in an afternoon session at the Center for Continuing Education. 
Earlier, the trustee met with several members of the Student Life Council. 
Nixon announces pro-Red China vote 
I(') 1!171 New York Times 

WASHINGTON, SEPT. 16-­President Nixon announced today that the United States will vote to seat Peking in the Security Council as well as the General Assembly of the United Nations because this policy "reflects the realities of the situation." 
But Nixon also told an un­scheduled news conference at his White House office this afternoon that "we will vote against the expulsion of the Republic of China and we will work as ef­fectively as we can to accomplish that goal." 
In discussing his intention to visit the People's Republic of China, Nixon said he thought his talks with Premier Chou En-Lai "may be productive," despite "the very great differences" between the two countries. 
He expected the Peking discussions to be productive, he said, because "Premier Chou En-Lai both publicly and and privately, doesn't take the usual naive sentimental idea, and neither do I. If we just get to know each other all of our dif­ferences are going to evaporate." 
"He recognizes and I recognize that there are very great dif­ferences between the People's 

President Nixon 

·Republic and the U.S. of America," Nixon said. "He recognizes and I recognize that at this point it might serve our mutual interest to discuss those differences." 
Nixon, who announced last July 15 that the visit would occur before next May, refused to say when his trip would take place. But he volunteered that the arrangements for it are being worked out in a "very satisfac­tory way." 
Responding to other questions of foreign policy, the president said the U.S. would not cut off 
(Continued on page B) 
The sessions were mainly question and discussion by each group to clarify their own positions and to understand the other's. 
Although no progress was made by either group, both were encouraged by the other's willingness to discuss the issue. 
According to Dave Fromm, 
Walsh Hall President, the 
meeting was good for everyone, 
"We got them thinking." 
He added that the meeting has 
"started to open lines of com­
munication." 
Buz Imhoff, HPC President, 
said they discussed each others 
letters and that "what happens 
now depends on the SLC." 
Stephan was particularly 
pleased, saying after _the 
meeting, "This is the first lime 
that group has impressed me as a 
body." 
Judicial Board Changes 
He also noted the Trustees' goal of stricter enforcement. "We want to shake this thing <parietal violations) up. What they (students) want is autonomous enforcement and their per­formance up to now doesn't justify this." 
The HPC, in its letter, said it is 
willing to change the hall judicial 
board structure "contingent upon 
the Board's acceptance of the 
SLC's future decisions regarding 
parietals." 
The change would place a faculty member on each board and impower the SLC to oversee and periodically evaluate and report the work of each judicial body. 

"We see no reason why violations within a hall could not be handled by these boards ... as opposed to being taken directly to the dean of Students. 
"In fact, we believe that true community spirit and a strong sense of student responsibility will develop from such a system." the presidents stated..

Fr. Charles Weiher, the rector of Carroll Hall, stated that the administration might be trying to avoid a decision because parking has become a problem for colleges across the country. He speculated that the ad­ministration may be trying to return to the policy of seniors­only parking. 
The proposal outlined and diagrammed the available parking space along with a possible parking area on a nearby abandoned tennis court. This provides parking for thirty cars. The students offered to paint the lots and maintain them during the winter. In the proposal room was provided for emergency vehicles to pass, and the students offered to pay $30 for parking privileges; undergrads pay only $25. 
The students need parking spaces for fifty cars. These ad­ditional autos could be ac­comodated on two vacant fields adjacent to the hall. If this could not be arranged the students proposed that they sst up a shuttle service among them­selves to the parking lots D-1 and C-3 near the stadium and Stepan Center. 
There are two gates located near the hall used only be university vehicles and delivery trucks which the students would be able to use..

Strong and effective 



MXon plans post -freeze restraints 
New York Times 

Washington -President Nixon declared today that he would substitute a program of "strong, effective" restraints on major industries after the 90-day freeze on wages and prices expires in November. 
The American people "don't want to have a freeze followed by a thaw where you can get stuck in the mud," the President told reporters at an impromptu news conference in the oval office this afternoon. 
Nixon declined to discuss specifics of the proposal being drawn up in consultation with business, labor, and agricultural leaders and government officals. But his comments left little doubt that he was in favor of a program of voluntary restraints backed up by legal authority to force rollbacks of price and wage in­creases the government would consider inflationary. 
"Phase two will be strong," the President said. "It will be ef­fective." And although he said it would require the cooperation of both labor and management, he called it "vitally important" that the follow-up program have teeth in it. "You cannot have jawboning that is effective without teeth," Nixon addded. 
There was no mention during the 40-minute news conference, Nixon's first since he announced the freeze of forthcoming restraints on corporate profits and stockholder dividends. 
Nor did the President affirm reports tha the administration leaned toward a government hoard, rather than a tripartite board representing business, labor and the public, to monitor the second phase of his anti­inflation program. 
Leaders of organized labor told the President at the White House last Friday that they would favor a tripartite hoard and reaffirmed their interest in controls on

They  have  thus  joined  the  

slowly coalescing opposition to President Thieu's government, along with a still largely unorganized group of an­tigovernment intellectuals, students, and army veterans. 
In another development, sporadic street violence broke out near the An Quang Pagoda in Saigon's Chinese section as police broke up a demonstration at which another opposition group burned their voter registration cards as a protest against the one-man elections. 
Police blanketed the area with tear gas while a handful of Buddhist students threw rocks and two molotov cocktails. About 10 voting cards were burned. 
The organizer of the voting card burning, Tran Ngoc Lieng, is a well-known French-trained lawyer and leader of anti­government intellectual groups.

"We believe that the 10 per cent -5 per cent approach is much the better one," Nixon said. "Because it will give the charge to the economy in the year we need it, which is now. On the other hand, 7 per cent would be 
better than nothing."

Nader's Raider stresses involvement in lnPRIG 
Stressing the importance of unity in success, Nader Raider Joe Highland urged his Grace Hall audience yesterday to join in a concerted effort to make the Indiana Public Interest Research Group On PRIG) a reality on this campus. 
The group, which acts basically as a consumer watch dog group, is solely funded and run by students. The money collected is used to finance research projects and to pay salaries of a number of professionals (lawyers, environmental scientists, etc.) which the group hires on a full time basis to in­vestigate and prosecute its fin­dings. 
Calling Public Interest Research Groups a "new aspect of education and simultaneously, a way to get necessary things done," Highland stated that many studnets are now receiving academic credit in Minnesota, Oregon and other states for consumer-related research projects. 
The former Student Coor­dinator of the Minesota Public Interest Research Group <MPRIG) cited as a reason for the necessity of PRIG, the failure of certain governmental agan­cies, such as the Food and Drug 
Administration. 
Highland believes that "People have too much faith in the government. They feel that when they buy hamburger, it is good 

ALSAC to collect 
The framework of a campus­wide organization to raise money for lukemia stricken children has been completed and will begin collecting funds tomorrrow morning. 
Aid to Lukemia Stricken American Children (ALSAC), wii1 receive all the funds collected in the ten week cam­
paign that will be directed by Ombudsman Paul Dziedzic and 
Jack Greeley. 
Lukemia afflicted children, 

who recommended by a physician, are eligible for free hospital care and medical at­tention under ALSAC. Since volunteers do most of the organizational work, fully ninty­five cents out of every dollar 
contributed goes directly to the hospital. 
The youths indicated that lukemia was seledd by the group because it is the number one killer of children and that ALSAC performs a vital role in caring for their needs. 
Funds will be collected on campus before each home football game. A special effort will be made out side the stadium prior to the Navy game on Oc­tober 30. 
Plans are also being for­mulated to collect donations during Mass that weekend. 
Volunteers are welcome to assist in the campaign. More information is available in room 507 of Grace Hall or 7638.

hamburger, otherwise the store wouldn't sell it." This type of reasoning, Highland feels, 
necessitates the Public Interest Research Group. 
Highland cited as examples of student effort the research done by Connecticut students in ~he property taxes in the city of Wallingford. Students found that "records were being kept in pencil, so they could be changed." The Nader's raider went on to point out that there was a vast difference in rates in the city between Industry and homeowners . 
Highland pointed out that 
Ralph Nader considers students 
"the backbone of his 
organization." He noted the 
pending sex discrimination case 
in Oregon which was totally 
student initaited. Women em­
ployees at Oregon State 
University, Highland revelaled, 
are earning up to $4000 less than 
men in the same positions. 
Highland ended hiS talk by 
citing InPRIG as a challenge to 
the studnets of Indiana. He 
assured his audience that the 
organizational road was a long 
one, but noted the perseverance 
of the students in Minnesota and 
Oregon as examples to follow. 
Science Quarterly takes on Prof Mead 
Notre Dame's Science Quar­
terly has a new moderator, Prof. 
Darwin Mead. This change in 
staff was announced by the 
magazine's new editor, Gene 
Molinelli earlier this week. 
Science Quarterly is a magazine 
published for the science majors 
of the university. 
Mead is replacing Dr. Emil T. 
Hoffman as moderator of the 
Science Quarterly, since Hoff­
man recently became dean of the 
Freshman Year of Studies. 
Darwin Mead is presently a 
physics instructor and the 
Assistant Dean of the College of 
Science. 
Molinelli also revealed several 
changes in the magazine's 
organization. Pat Wyant is the 
Associate Editor. For the first 
time, Science Quarterly has an 
office in Nieuwland Science Hall. 
Molinelli stated that under his 
leadership the magazine would 
try to place less emphasis on very 
technical papers. Along these 
lines he is starting a comments 
section. Molinelli described his 
philosophy towards the magazine 
as, "It's (Science Quarterly) not 
just going to be a research 
magazine, but sort of a place 
where science students can ex­
press their opinions about 
anything ... There will be less 
technical articles and more 
articles of general interest." 
Molinelli issued a plea for 
volunteers to assist the staff in 
printing out the magazine. He 
said, "Last year we had a 
problem --most of the students 
were kind of indifferent to the 
magazine."

goodbye pat 
It's difficult for me to start this column for a number of reasons. I don't know whether to try to be very clever. overly dramatic, ~r even te,rrifica_lly opinionated. I wonder, too, If you aren t rea?mg this simplybecause you didn't enjoy dinner, your fnend did and you're stuck waiting for him. Whatever the reason, I sincerely wish you'd make allowances for my poor writing style and try to understand the thought behind this little insight. 
Very often I could care less about an article written for a person I didn't know, by someone I cared less about and it always puzzles me as to why they were even written. It's apparent to me now, though, why it is. Every now and then, something, or in this case, someone comes along that you really care about; that sends you thinking, caring and doing. Too often, in your mind, this person maintains an anonymity that should be broken. Enough rambling. 
Pat Molinaro is a name that unless you frequented 
the student government offices, probably means 
nothing to you. I'll address myself then to those who 
have and to those who are simply interested. She's 
very much a woman in love with her word and the 
people she associates with. This feeling is returned by 
all who know her. She's far above the job of secretary 
she holds, and does in fact keep student government 
going. She imparts a spirit that is contagious and 
filling. She expects work from "her boys" ,and mak~s 
sure what needs to be done, gets done. It s very dif­
ficult to write about a feeling. 
The walls of the office have for years been covered 
with pictures of the guys associated with it. This week 
those pictures come down, as Pat leaves her desk for 
good. It isn't going to be a really happy day. If I can 
address this personally, Pat, that, to say it won't be_ the 
same, goes unsaid;that this is the end of somethmg, 
something to be gravely missed by those who~e 
privilege it is to know you. Itseems so weak to say thiS, 
but you'll know what it means by a sincere "thanks." 

soul incarnate by lenny kaye 
ike &tina -artist &audience 
never devOid ot movement; it is filled with any number of tee11-age dance variations, something always grinding, shaking, hurtling through the air with blindin:~ spet.·d. 
If you managed to catch the Rolling Stones on any of their cross-coJntry stops last Novenber, you probably know who I'm talking about. On that same show with them was the Ike and Tina Turner Revue, and their success was so cverpowering that in many cases, the Stones had to wait. patiently backstage in order to let the crowd cool down enough for them to make their entrance. In San Francisco, Ike and Tina left things in such an uproar that the show was delayed a full forty­five mmutes. In New York, the response was nearly as great. 
The reason behind all this excitement is not too hard to understand. Ike has taken a common formula--firls, music, almo~>t blatant sexuality--and organized all the piece!:-into a show that never lets up its assault on the audie11ce. When you're not being confronted with the aston· ghing depth, range, and power of Tina's ever-so­husky voice, you're being overwhelmed with the spectacle of four incredibly beautiful chicks slamming around the stage like pieces of quicksilver, almost in precision, but not quite enough to take away from the spontaneity of their performance. 
On record, as you might expect, a lot of this power has been lost. The Turners' best album to date is the partially Phil Spector-produced River Deep, Mountain High (A & M>, though it must be said that each of their other albums contains at least two or three cuts that amply demonstrate how Ike and Tina go about making music. In the title song of their latest release, The Hunter (Blue Thumb), they manage to get it on in fine shape: when Tina sings the line about getting "you in the sights of my lu-huve gun," stretching out that single word to unbelievable lengths, almost caressing it before she is finished, the effect is likely to send shivers down even the least likely of backbones. 
But if you care at all about seeing them in top form, 
the best place to catch Ike and Tina is live, where the 
visual dynamics of their stage show really have room 
to come across. Tina is one of those classic performers 
who is able to transform the meaning of words simply 
by saying them, bringing them all within her perssonal 
approach to music. For example, when John Lennor 
does the song "Come Together," he sings it in a way 
particualrly suited to John Lennon: walrus-like, 
relying on absurd syllable combinations, endowing it 
with his own vision and personality. But Tina takes the 
same song and gives it a whole double meaning--"Got 
to be good-lookin' 'cause he's so hard to see"--that 
never was remotely hinted at in the Lennon version. 
The effect is pure dynamite. · 
The Turners round out their show with a pair of songs 
featuring long recitations by Tina, and invariably, they 
never fail to provoke large-scale response from an 
audience. The first, Otis Redding's"! Been Loving You 
<A Little Too Long)," is soft, husned, Tina standing 
quietly in a dim spotlight talking about the man she 
loves. '"Cause you got what I want .... " Another 

prompt from Ike: "And you got what I need." "Yes, 
you got what I need .... " And after that, Tina is on her 
own: "Oooohh, baby, I want you so much ... please give 
it to me ... ahhhhh .... " The lights grow even dimmer; 
the band in back is just a whisper. "Mmmmmmm­
m .... "Tina groans, once, twice, again. Whistles from 
the crowd. "Oh, baby," she sighs, caressing the 
microphone, its stand, drawing it in closer to her, 
pushing against it with her hips. "Unnnnhhhhh .... " 
Finally, a last low shudder: woman in the final stages

and she chuckles a bit up on stage. She walks back, stands by Ike, the microphone in her hand. "Do you know what he has the nerve to tell me? He says 'baby ... how'm I supposed to know how to fully ap­preciate you if I can't test what's out there in the streets?"' Laughter, much applause. Ike flexes his arms for the crowd, a knowing smile on his face. Tina walks back to the front of the stage. "Well, girls, l think we're getting a little tired of the men always having their way. Now we're gonna start going out on  the streets, 'cause we figure that anything out there that's good enough for them...is good enough for us too!" A huge roar. The kid next to me falls out of his seat, flopping in the aisle screaming "too much! too much!" A 
A little spontaneous ovation has developed over to the right. I look around. Not a soul has his attention directed anywhere but the stage. Everybody is sitting up, slightly bouncing in time to the music, getting picked off and carried along by the sheer power con­fronting them on the stage. There's a strobe light going now, and Tina is dancing with the Ikettes, caught in single frames of motion: arms outstretched, head bent with hair falling; leaning back, punching at the air, left foot upraised; hand on hip, body all curves and angles, face profiled like some Indian Princess. 
"Too Much!" That kid rolling around in the aisle was still screaming, and of everybody there, he was the one who put his finger directly on the key.

not change our position one iota." 
Other conference participants 

had supported an initiative by 
Pierre-Paul Schweitzer, 
managing director of the in­
ternational monetary fund, and 
modified slightly by Anthony 
Barber, British Cgancellor of the 
Exchequer. 
This plan proposed to tackle as 

a group the issues of changing 
currency values, widening the 
margin in which fixed rates can fluctuate, increasing the price of gold (thereby directly devaluing · the dollar l and removing the· 
surcharge. 
Connally rejected this, and his 
spokesman later said: "We're 
interested in the whole package." 
This was a reference to 
Washington's insistence that 
currency changes, trade 
liberalization and sharing of 
American international aid and 
defense obligations should all be 
discussed in connection with 
lifting the surcharge. 
The Schweitzer-Barber plan 
would have singled out for a 
second round of negotiations 
these broader methods of 
correcting the balance of 
payments deficit, along with a 
discussion of restoring the link 
between the dollar and gold. 
The American argument is that other countries must help the United States achieve a $13­billion swing--from a projected payments deficit of $5-billion, in a full-employment economy, to a surplus of $8-billion wihch Washington says is required to sllst.tin American external defense, aid and investment obligations. The figures apply to the cnrrent account, that is trade in goods and financial services.

ex~t~o~fii.-~l~m~hoff letter 
Dear Mr. 5rephan: 
For the past three yec:rs, Notre Dame has placed a great deal of emphasis on the implementation of hall life. A sense of autonomy and community has been fostered by both students and administration. We feel that the recent action of the Board of Trustees has greatly impeded our progress toward a campus-wide spirit of hall community. Specifically, we feel that the letter sent by you to Dr. Eagan had an inherent disregard for the differences of the twenty unique communities on campus. These dif ferences are manifest not only in the physical structures, but also in the hall staffs and the communitY at­mospheres. 
We the hall presidents, as the elected heads of the twenty individual halls, bring to this letter the force of our personal experiences in the halls, especially those of the past two wc~ks. 
We present this letter from the 
students to you. 
Although we cannot overlook the repercussions the Board of Trustees' stand on drinking will have on com­munity life in the halls, we do un­derstand the legal motivation of this decisioli. However, we believe this to be a simplistic solution to a complex problem. A solution that increases the probability of those "terrible con­sequences" when the drinking student is linked to an automobile. 
However, the problem we would like to address ourselves to at this time is that of student responsibility in the halls. We feel the implementation of our suggestions and closer com­munication and cooperation between the Hall Presidents and the SLC would foster an attitude within the halls that would be more workable from both the Trustees' and the students' points of view. 
If the students have a voice in the

rules unuer which they are to live, we feel that subsequent student responsibility will be greatly enhanced. It was in this spirit that the Board of Trustees initiated the SLC three years ago. Siner that time thz Board has hindered this spirit by refusing to accept various recom­mendations on hal! autonomy and parietals as submitted by the SLC. 
Contingent on the Board's ac­ceptance of the SLC's future decisions regarding parietals, the twenty hall governments are prepared to restructure their hall Judicial Judicial Boards to include a faculty seat on each board. Secondly, we propose that the SLC standing com'mittee on Hall Life be duly impowered to oversee, and periodically evaluate to the Board of Trustees, all workings of the hall Judicial Boards. We see no reason why violations within a hall could not be handled by these boards in light of these r visions as opposed to being

taken direct\ y to the Dean of Students. In fact, we believe that true com­munity spirit and a stong sense of student responsibility will develop from such a system. We envision no major problems in either enforcement of, or com pi iance to, parietal pol icy as established by the SLC, the highest legislative body on campus. 

It is undeniable that the mutual cooperation of the Hall Presidents' Council and the SLC will greatly strengthen the structure of the SLC in responding to the feelings of the students to life on campus, and return the SLC to the purpose for which it was originally created. For true community spirit to exist at Notre Dame, students must have a significant role in the formulation of policy which most fundamentally governs their Iives. Of course, we 
realize that there are technicalities and mechanics to be discussed but we 
also realize and recognize that that is 
the function of the SLC, as you 
established it. 
In conclusion, we must impress upon you that this letter is not merely an outgrowth of the Hall Presidents' Council. More clearly, it is as in­dividual heads of each residence hall that we have been directed to ap­proach you. We hope that in this collective letter, therefore, that we have not disguiseq the personal responsibility each of us has, the responsibility to create a viable community spirit at Notre Dame.
