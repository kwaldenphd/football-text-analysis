A panel discussing the socio­logical implications of "The Vagina Monologues" followed the second production of Eve Ensler's controversial play Thursday in DeBartolo 101 and incorporated the views of Fort Wayne-South Bend Bishop John D'Arcy through a representative. 
Opponents continued to protest the play after 20 to 30 students walked out of Wednesday's performance, and greeted the attendees by handing them religious medals and a copy of D'Arcy's con­demnation of the show.

Panel exan1.ines local 
effects of immigration 
By BECKY HOGAN 
News Writer 
Panelists said deporting illegal immigrants had a negative effect on the South Bend com­munity Wednesday in DeBartolo !Iall. 
Panelists examined the issue examined from the perspectives of religion, healthcare, law, edu­cation and economics. 
Senior economics major Jamie Grebowski's summer research project, which examined the economic impact of undocu­mented workers in South Bend, started after immigrant parish­ioners of St. Adalbert's Parish were deported in immigration raids. 
Grebowski, along with other researchers, surveyed 62 immi­grants, 40 of whom were undoc­umented. Their survey was based on the transactions of adults in the community accord­ing to assets such as labor income, consumer goods pur­chased and taxes paid. The sur­vey also looked at benefits they receive from government pro­grams such as welfare. 
"On average, over $4,000 a month per individual is going into the community from undoc­umented workers," he said. 
The study ultimately conclud­ed that deportation of undocu­mented immigrants negatively effects South Bend's economy. 
"Deporting undocumented workers is economically harm­ful to South Bend. We estab­lished that, in total, the immi­grant population contributes between $2 million dollars and about $10.5 million to the com­munity," Grebowski said.

"Other activities at the event do not require dancing -live bands, computer access, video game competitions, sports tour­neys, socializing, listening to guests from the Center sharing their stories, and plenty of eat­ing," Kronk said. 
The event will also feature a "family hour" towards the end, when CFH staff and residents will share their experiences

with participants. 
Participants can sign up for the event at danceforthehome­less.com. In addition to paying a $15 fee, dancers must raise at least $250 in pledges. 
An easier option for students participating with friends is pur­chasing a "Miracl«:J Pass" for a cost of $50, which allows ten students to participate in events from 6 p.m. to 12 a.m. on Saturday.

ND-8 simulates poverty 
Group sponsors dinner to raise awareness on campus ofworld hunger 
By LINDSAY SENA 
News Writer 
World poverty awareness group ND-8 tried to simulate experiences of those living in extreme poverty by dividing stu­dents into different socioeconom­ic groups during the second annual Hunger Banquet Thursday in the Coleman-Morse Center. 
"We are here because 1.2 bil­lion people live in extreme pover­ty, surviving on less than $1 a day," freshman Coleen Halloran said. 
ND-8 oflicer Christie Hannon, who was the chief planner of the Hunger Banquet, said she hoped students left the banquet with a "better awareness of the reality of the people that live in poverty, and also an appreciation of what we have."

Wilders offers film critical of Islam 
AMSTERDAM -A Dutch lawmaker released a film highly critical of Islam on Thursday, setting verses of the Muslim holy book against a background of violent images from terrorist attacks. 
Geert Wilders posted his 15-minute film on a Web site. Shortly afterward, Dutch television channels showed segments of the film and broadcast discussions by analysts on the possible impact of its release. 
The Dutch government had warned Wilders that a film offensive to Muslims could spark violent protests in Islamic countries, like those two years ago after European newspapers published cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad. 
"The film equates Islam with violence. We reject this," Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende said in a televised reaction. "We ... regret that Mr. Wilders has released this film. We believe it serves no other purpose than to cause offense." 
Bush endorses Croatian NATO bid 
ZAGREB, Croatia -President Bush says he "strongly supports" Croatian membership in NATO, but has declined to say if the former Yugoslav country will be invited to join the alliance at a summit next week. 
In an interview with the state-run Croatian tel­evision broadcast Thursday, Bush said the deci­sion will be made by all NATO members. 
Bush has said that Croatia is in a "very good position" to be invited to join. Membership in NATO and European Union are among the coun­try's priorities. 
Bush spoke in Washington before his trip next week to Ukraine, a NATO summit in Homania and Croatia.

Unknown gunmen kill two motorists 
CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. -Gunfire that struck several vehicles and injured two people along a stretch of mountain highway had motorists and police on edge Thursday in a region where mem­ories of the deadly Beltway snipers still haven't faded. 
Authorities were seeking at least two people suspected of firing shots the night before that hit two cars, a van, a tractor-trailer and an unoccu­pied dump truck on Interstate 64 just west of Charlottesville. Two people were injured, but not seriously. 
Col. Steven Flaherty, the state police superin­tendent. would not characterize the shootings as the work of snipers, calling it "random firing." 
Court upholds murder conviction 
PHILADELPHIA -An appeals court Thursday upheld Mumia Abu-Jamal's convic­tion for murdering a police officer 27 years ago but rejected prosecutors' request to reinstate the death penalty for the former Black Panther. 
A three-judge panel of the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said that because the jury that sentenced Abu-Jamal to die was given flawed instructions in the penalty phase, he must either get a new sentencing hearing or be sen­tenced to life in prison.

Al-Maliki vows 'no retreaf in Basra 
Mobs protest against Prime Minister after he cracks down on Shiite militias 
Associated Press 

BAGHDAD Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki pledged "no retreat" Thursday in the fight against Shiite militias in the southern city of Basra, as thousands of protesters demanded he resign over the crackdown and extremists fired rockets into the U.S.-protected Green Zone. 
Shiite militia leader Muqtada al-Sadr called Thursday for a political solu­tion to the burgeoning crisis and an end to the "shedding of Iraqi blood." But the state­ment, released by a close aide, stopped short of order­ing his Mahdi Army militia to halt attacks on the Green Zone or stop fighting in Basra, Iraq's second-largest city. 
In a sign of the deteriorat­ing security, gunmen in Baghdad seized a high-profile government spokesman from his home in a Shiite neighbor­hood, killing thre·e of his bodyguards and torching his house. In a bid to curb the violence, Iraq's military ordered vehicles and pedes­trians off the streets of the capital until Sunday morning.

"pornographic and spiritually 
harmful." 
Everett said the Monologues 
undermine the point it claims 
to make because some of the 
sexual acts celebrated in the 
play desecrate women. 
"Several of the Monologues 
exalt sexual pleasure as an 
end in itself, severed from 
twin goods of love and life," 
she said. 
She pointed to the mono­
logue entitled "The Little 
Coochie Snorcher That 
Could," which detailed the 
positive experience of a 
teenager's seduction by an 
older woman. 
"Sexual snduction of a 
minor is portrayed positively 
as an act of salvation," she 
said. "You can't have it both 
ways." 
Collett spoke on the socio­
logical significance of the play. 
"I was shocked with some of 
the language and topics of the 
play but I also realized that 
that was exactly the point," 
she said. 
While many condemned this technique of shock, Collett said it was an effective way to capture attnntion and make a point. 
"!This exhibits thel power of language," she said. "To many of us, the word vagina evokes disgust and shame." 
According to Collett, the play makes an effort to over­come the negative connota­tions surrounding the word 'vagina' by saying it and shouting it. 
Nordstrom highlighted her experiences working in rape camps in Africa and Eastern Europe as a testament to the truth and importance of the "Monologues," because it can give a voice to the countless women who have been brutal­ly raped. 
"I have seen this in Yugoslavia and Africa," she said. "People tell stories about what hurts and what needs healing." 
Whether or not someone likes or agrees with the "Mon.ologues" is inconsequen­tial Nordstrom said. 
"If you don't like what is being said, say it better," she stated, "But you can't run away from the question." 
Nordstrom said the response the Monologues elicited and the full auditorium that came to see the play indicated that "obviously something is being said that is still important and still needs to be said." 
Wolbrecht related the Monologues to the second wave of feminism that occurred in the 1960s. She compared it to the tactic of "conscious-raising," a tech­nique of feminists to bring awareness of issues to the surface, to the often-criticized shock tactics used in the "Monologues." 
"The idea was that through sharing they could see the degree to which their own lives were shaped, con­strained, and dominated by gender," Wolbrecht said. 
Wolbrecht said she was moved by the play. 
"I forgot how moving it is to see 20-year-olds speak about things no one else is saying," Wolbrecht said. "I was so inspired by this play." 
The "Monologues" con­eludes its run tonight at 7p.m. in DeBartolo 101.

U.S. reports troop deaths 
Solidiers,families mourn as officials up the number ofcasualties to 4,000 
Associated Press 

FORT STEWART, Ga. ­Staff Sgt. Christopher M. Hake began his Army career in a ceremonial unit, serving as an escort during funerals at Arlington National Cemetery and marching in President Bush's 2001 inau­guration parade. 
But he wanted to do his part in Iraq. So Hake, of Enid, Okla., transferred in 2004 to the 3rd Infantry Division at Fort Stewart in southern Georgia, deployed to Iraq in 2005 and returned for a second combat tour late last year. 
"This deployment, he told me, 'You couldn't pay me to come home early,"' said Peter Hake, the soldier's father. "He was a squad leader and loved his guys that worked under him. He said they would die for each other, and they did." 
Hake, 26, and three Fort Stewart soldiers in his squad died Monday from wounds suffered when a roadside bomb exploded into their Bradley armored vehicle the day before. The Army announced the four deaths Sunday, pushing the mili­tary's count of U.S. service members killed in Iraq to 4,000, and released their identities Thursday. 
The military's count varies slightly from an independent tally kept by The Associated Press, which on Thursday counted 4,004 service mem­bers killed in Iraq. 
Also killed in. the explosion were Spc. Jose A. Rubio Hernandez, 24, of Mission, Texas; Pfc. Andrew J. llabsieger, 22, of Festus, Mo.; and Pvt. George Delgado, 21, of Palmdale, Calif. 
"He wanted to be known for something, and now he is," said Rubio's wife, Jennifer Guerra. 
The four men served in the 4th Battalion, 64th Armor Hegiment, which was among the first Army units to charge into Iraq during the March 2003 invasion.

Dinner 
continued from page 1 
When students arrived at the banquet, event organizers asked them to pull a card at random from a bag. Each card contained the name, socioeconomic status and life story of a character whose identity participants would assume for the evening. 
Organizers divided students into high, middle and low­income groups, according to the actual statistical divisions of the respective 15 percent, 25 per­cent and 60 percent of each class. 
After the student<> were seated -the high-income at tables and the low-income barefoot on the floor -Hannon said to illustrate the real-life scenario, the high­income would receive a catered dinner of salad, pasta and cheesecake while the middle­class would receive rice and beans and the lower-class would receive only rice. 
The men were asked to serve themselves first, based on the studenL<>' assigned identities. 
"Some people have the good fortune to change their lives for the better, but for most the cir­cumstances of life are deter­mined by factors outside their control," Boyle said. 
ND-8 ollicer Michael Ellerhorst emphasized the importance of spreading the word about hunger to students and faculty around campus. 
"You don't really think about it ... you go to the dining hall and there's more food than you could ever want ... a lot of people don't have access to [food] around the world," he said.

Wall Street sinks on tech concerns 
NEW YORK -Wall Street sank in volatile trading Thursday after the government con­firmed that the last quarter of 2007 did indeed suffer a sharp economic slowdown. For the second straight session, the Dow Jones industrial average fell more than 100 points. 
The technology sector was particularly weak after business software maker Oracle Corp. posted worse-than-expected fiscal third-quarter sales and issued a cautious forecast. Meanwhile, data suggesting that Google Inc.'s revenue from Internet users' clicks could slow also raised worries about tech stocks. 
Oracle fell $1. 51, or 7. 2 percent, to $19.43, and Google dropped $14.11, or 3.1 percent, to $444.08. 

Wiring inspections cancel more flights 
DALLAS -American Airlines and Delta Air Lines canceled hundreds more flights Thursday as they continued inspections of wiring bundles on some of their pl~mes. 
Although thousands of passengers were inconvenienced over the past two days, analysts downplayed any notion that the cancellations would hurt the airlines finan­cially. They said the costs would pale in comparison to high fuel prices. 
Delta expected to cancel about 275 flights, or about 3 percent of its schedule, before returning to normal operations early Friday, said spokeswoman Chris Kelly. 
American, the nation's largest airline, canceled 141 flights by mid-afternoon Thursday, or about 6 percent of its estimat­ed 2,300 flights, officials said. The Fort Worth-based airline canceled 318 flights Wednesday. 
At American, inspectors from the airline and the Federal Aviation Administration focused on fixing the spacing between cords used to secure bundles of wires in the auxiliary hydraulic systems of its MD­80 aircraft. 
"In no way was safety compromised, but the (FAA) directive said 'Do it this way,"' said American spokesman Tim Smith.

Girl dies after not 
receiving medicine 
Associated Press 
WESTON, Wis.-Police are investigating an 11-year-old girl's death from an undiag­nosed, treatable form of dia­betes after her parents chose to pray for her rather than take her to a doctor. 
An autopsy showed Madeline Neumann died Sunday of diabetic ketoacido­sis, a condition that left too little insulin in her body, Everest Metro Police Chief Dan Vergin said. 
She had probably been ill for about a month, suffering symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, excessive thirst, loss of appetite and weak­ness, the chief said Wednesday, noting that he expects to complete the investigation by Friday and forward the results to the dis­trict attorney. 
The girl's mother, Leilani Neumann, said that she

"We just noticed a tiredness within the past two weeks," she said Wednesday. "And then just the day before and that day (she died), it sudden­ly just went to a more serious situation.

The girl's father, Dale Neumann, a former police officer, said he started CPR "as soon as the breath of life left" his daughter's body. 
Family members elsewhere called authorities to seek help for the girl. 
"My sister-in-law, she's very religious, she believes in faith instead of doctors ... ," the girl's aunt told a sheriff's dis­patcher Sunday afternoon in a call from California. "And she called my mother-in-law today ... and she explained to us that she believes her daughter's in a coma now and she's relying on faith."

She is survived by her par­ents and three older siblings. 
"We are remaining strong for our children," Leilani Neumann said. "Only our faith in God is giving us strength at this time." 



Ex -officials criticize G uantanan1o 
Former secretaries ofstate say next administration should close base 
Associated Press 

ATHENS, Ga. -Five former 
U.S. secretaries of state on Thursday urged the next presi­dential administration to close the Guantanamo Bay prison camp and open a dialogue with Iran. 
The former chiefs of American diplomacy, who served in Democratic and Republican administrations, reached a consensus on the two issues at a conference in Athens aimed at giving the next president some bipartisan foreign policy advice. Each of them said shuttering the prison camp in Cuba would bolster America's image abroad. 
"It says to the world: 'We are now going back to our tradi­tional respective forms of deal­ing with people who potentially committed crimes,"' said Colin Powell, who served as President Bush's first secretary of state. 
Powell was joined by Henry Kissinger, James Baker III, Warren Christopher and Madeleine Albright, who sat in a round-table discussion spon­sored by the University of Georgia at a sold-out confer­ence center in downtown Athens. 
Kissinger called Guantanamo a "blot on us" and agreed it should be closed, but wondered aloud about the consequences of a closure. 
Baker, a lawyer who served in President George 1-I.W. Bush's Cabinet, said he has struggled with its legal implica­tions. 
"It gives us a very, very bad name, not just internationally," he said. "I have a great deal of difficulty understanding how we can hold someone, pick someone up, particularly some­one who might be an American citizen -even if they were caught somewhere abroad, acting against American inter­ests -and hold them without ever giving them an opportuni­ty to appear before a magis­trate." 
The former secretaries of state also urged that the U.S. open a line of dialogue with Iran, each saying it is impor­tant to maintain contact with adversaries and allies alike. 
Albright stressed the impor­tance of finding "common ground" and Christopher urged diplomats to explore opening contact with other "vectors of power," such as clerics and for­mer political leaders. Albright and Christopher served under President Clinton. 
Baker suggested the dialogue could center on a common dilemma, saying a "dysfunc­tional Iraq, a chaotic Iraq, is not something that's in the interest to Iran. There's every incentive on their part to help us, the same way they did in Afghanistan." 
Kissinger, who served the Nixon and Ford administra­tions, urged an open -if deli­cate -line of communication with Iran. 
"One has to talk with adver­saries," said Kissinger, who served the Nixon and Ford administrations. 
Powell compared the poten­tial talks to difficult visits he made to Syria while he served as America's chief diplomat. 
''They are not always pleas­ant visits," he said. "But you've got to do it."

Kissinger, who laid the groundwork for Nixon's his­toric 1972 visit to China that opened relations with that nation, had sharp words when the topic veered to America's perception of China. 
"We should not look at China as a military adversary," said Kissinger, adding that a mili­tary confrontation is unlikely. "We should see where we could cooperate." 
Powell said he agrees, argu­ing that the biggest threat to a peaceful relationship with China would be Taiwan declar­ing its independence. 
"And, frankly we can keep that from happening," said Powell. 
Some of the strongest words were reserved for the trade embargo against Cuba. 
"The 50-year-old embargo has not worked, not worked to our benefit or their benefit. This is one of those issues that is driven more by politics than foreign policy," said Christopher. 
"When policies don't work for 50 years," he said, "It's time to start thinking about some­thing else."

Arkansas homes devastated by flooding 
Nearly half of state affected as weather forecasters call for more storms and residents watch water levels rise 
Associated Press 
LITTLE ROCK -Empty grain elevators surrounded by a swollen White River await a har­vest that may never come as floodwaters drown wheat already planted this spring. 
Last year, Arkansas produced about 28.7 million bushels of wheat. Now, muddy waters have run through fields for days, tak­ing with it expensive fertilizer treatments already applied to the soil. 
Some of the wheat, green this time of year and looking like tall grass. has survived, wheat expert Jason Kelley, of the University of Arkansas Cooperative Extension Service, said Thursday. But grain under water for a week or more likely won't make it. 
"You could really tell the plant had been suffering," Kelley said. "They were actually wilted and looked like they were running out of water, but they had no oxygen." 
Any real estimate on the darn­age will have to wait until the floodwaters drain, Kelley said, a process that may take days. 
The flooding in Arkansas began with storms March 1 7 in the Midwest, and federal and state officials have been able to assess the damage only where the water has receded. Thirty­five counties -nearly half the state -have been declared fed­eral disaster areas. One person was killed in the storms in Arkansas, and another remains missing. 
Recent heavy rains also flooded parts of other states, including Ohio, Indiana, Illinois and Missouri. The weather has been linked to at least 17 deaths in the region. 
The National Weather Service issued a flash-flood warning Thursday for the White River downstream from the town Des Arc, northeast of little Rock, and forecasters said flooding at Clarendon in Monroe County could be the worst in 25 years. 

Residents along the White River National Wildlife Refuge near Clarendon will see water rise a foot a day, said weather service hydrologist Steve Bays. 
"One thing that we are trying to do around here is keep people concerned about what's going on but not inflict a panic, and it's a fme line. It certainly bears moni­toring by people along the river," Bays said. 
With waters still rising under sunny skies, forecasters called for a 50 percent chance of thun­derstorms Friday and a quarter­inch of rain or more. 
Jaysson Funkhouser, a surface water specialist with the U.S. Geological Survey, said prelimi­nary figures showed that the White River surge from last week's storms and flooding upstream could, in corning days, reach the 100-year flood stage­meaning it has a 1-in-100 chance of being flooded this badly in any given year. 

Remains of contractor found in Iraq 
Associated Press 
MINNEAPOLIS -Relatives of a U.S. security contractor held hostage in Iraq for more than a year said Thursday that they felt a mixture of sad­ness and relief when they learned his remains were found. 
Though it wasn't the news they prayed for, Paul Johnson­Reuben's loved ones said they know his suffering is over. 
"Today, we do get to feel better," said Kathy Reuben, Johnson-Reuben's first wife. "It's over. Paul's in heaven, he's a happy man today." 
Officials announced Thursday that they had identi­fied the remains of Johnson­Reuben of Minneapolis and Joshua Munns of Redding, Calif. The men were among six contractors kidnapped more than a year ago in two separate incidents in Iraq. 
The remains of two other contractors Ronald Withrow of Roaring Springs, Texas, and John Roy 
Stewart said. "He's not scared. He's not in pain. He's not being mutilated. He's not being tortured." 
At the same time, Stewart said, she will continue to press for answers about her son's abduction and the effort to track him down. 
"I think because he was ex-· military that they could have done a lot better job protect­ing him or looking for him than they did," she said. 
The other contractors still missing are Jonathon Cote, of Getzville, N.Y., and Bert Nussbaumer, of Vienna, Austria. 
Cote's family said on its blog Wednesday night that the body still awaiting identifica­tion is not Jonathon's. "Please remember to pray for Jon's safety and the loss of the other hostages and their families," the post said. ­
Reuben, Munns, Young, Cote and Nussbaumer worked in Iraq for Crescent Security Group, a Kuwait-based private security firm. They

Richard Kolko said authorities were awaiting forensic testing on the remains of a fifth body. 
The FBI said the men's remains have been returned to the U.S. 
"We're really sad that this has happened," Kathy Reuben said. "We've been waiting 16 months to hear something positive.... It's hard to imag­ine that he's gone." 
Munns' mother, Jackie Stewart of Ridgefield, Wash., said she had felt certain· that her son was dead since she learned Sunday that the bod­ies had been found. 
"When I first knew about it, it was relief. No. 1, that I finally know the answer and, No. 2, that he's not suffering," convoy they 
were escort­ing. Months later, the U.S. mil­itary reportedly stripped Crescent Security of its license to operate in Iraq over alleged weapons violations. 
Withrow was a contractor working for JPI Worldwide. He was abducted on Jan. 5, 2007. 
The cases of the missing contractors was back in the news earlier this month when the severed fingers of five of the men-including Johnson­Reuben -were sent to the 
U.S. military in Iraq. Some rel­atives initially took that as hopeful news their loved ones were still alive; others did not. 
"I had hope up until the last two weeks, when his finger (was) cut off. Then we knew it was going all downhill," said Johnson-Reuben's 17-year-old daughter, Bree Reuben. 

Johnson-Reuben's family has said he had been working in Iraq for about two years. The last time he was seen alive was on a video obtained by The Associated Press in January 2007 -he said he was being treated well. 
Bree Reuben and her twin sister, Casey, were among family members who spoke to the media Thursday. Bree brought along her 5-rnonth­old daughter, Ka'Leah -the granddaughter Johnson­Reuben never met. 
The sisters said they weren't surprised their dad was work­ing in Iraq because he loved to help people. In addition to providing security, he taught EMT classes. They said they last spoke to him about a week before he was kid­napped. 
"He said it was getting really dangerous out there and he was really scared for his life," said Casey Reuben. 
Bree said their father liked the work he was doing "up to the point where he started seeing people die in front of him. And he just got scared. He was shaking over the phone. I never heard my dad shake like that." 
Johnson-Reuben worked as a St. Louis Park police officer from 1994 to 2003. He was 39 years old when he was kid­napped. 
His twin brother, Patrick Reuben, said in a telephone in.terview that he and Johnson-Reuben had an inex­plicable connection and could sometimes sense how the other was doing. 
"It's just been really weird over the last month. I felt like something happened," he said. 
Patrick Reuben said the last 
16 months have been hard, 
and there have moments 
when he felt guilty about 
enjoying his own life. For now, 
he said he's trying to focus on 
the happy times with his 
brother, whom he followed 
first into the Marine Corps and 
then into law enforcement. 


California decreases green vehicle count 
State analysts criticize decision as negative move in development of low-emission cars 
Associated Press 
SACRAMENTO -California air regulators on Thursday slashed the number of battery-powered and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles that must be sold in the state, a setback for environmentalists and health advocates. 
The decision is expected to affect 12 other states that had adopted California's target for zero-emission vehicles. 
The California Air Resources 
Board voted to lower by 70 per­
cent the number of those vehicles 
that autornakers must sell here 
and in the states 
that intended to 
follow

hybrids. 
Environmentalists and health advocates criticized the lowering of the zero-emission goal for vehi­cles. They said the threats posed by global warming, combined with rising gasoline prices, lends urgency to greatly reducing vehi­cle emissions. 
"We are disappointed. We think this proposal doesn't take us on the road to meeting the state's long-term global warming goals," said Spencer Quong, a senior vehicles analyst at the Union of Concerned Scientist. 
Auto manufacturers said they could not meet the California stan­
dard and needed 
more time to 
make affordable 

they develop the more advanced technology that will allow mass production of pure zero-emission vehicles. 
Board chairwoman Mary Nichols described the move as a major step toward putting cleaner cars on the road. The plug-in hybrids envisioned by the air board have yet to be designed, she said. 
"We're introducing a whole new category of vehicles to the public," Nichols said. "I don't think it's a step backwards in the real world." 
In essence, the air board took two steps on Thursday: It cut the number of zero-emission vehicles it wants on the road by 2014, while at the same time offering an alternative -the gas-electric utilized by 
advancing core technologies," said Sara Rudy, an emissions'regulatory manager at Ford. "It is important at this stage to be nimble." 
The other manufacturers that must comply with the rules are General Motors Corp., Toyota Motor Corp., Honda Motor Co., Chrysler LLC and Nissan Motor Co. 
California adopted its zero-emis­sion vehicle mandate in 1990 as part of an attempt to reduce smog-forming emissions such as nitrogen oxide. 
The rule required that 10 per­cent of new cars sold in the state by the country's six leading auto manufacturers be completely non­polluting by 2003.

TSA disallows body piercing 
Woman asked to remove nipple ring before boarding airplane 
Associated Press 
LOS ANGELES -A Texas woman who said she was forced to remove a nipple ring with pliers in order to board an airplane called Thursday for an apology by federal security agents and a civil rights investigation. 
"I wouldn't wish this expe­rience upon anyone," Mandi Hamlin said at a news con­ference. "My experience with TSA was a nightmare I had to endure. No one deserves to be treated this way." 
Hamlin. 37, said she was trying to board a flight from Lubbock to Dallas on Feb. 24 when she was scanned by a Transportation Security Administration agent after passing through a larger metal detector without prob­lems. 
The female TSA agent used a handheld detector that beeped when it passed in front of Hamlin's chest, the Dallas-area resident said. 
Hamlin said she told the woman she was wearing nip­ple piercings. The women then called over her male colleagues, one of whom said she would have to remove the jewelry, Hamlin said. 
Hamlin said she could not remove them and asked whether she could instead display her pierced breasts in private to the female agent. But several other 
male officers told her she could not board her flight until the jewelry was out, she said. 
She was taken behind a curtain and managed to remove one bar-shaped piercing but had trouble with the second, a ring. 
"Still crying, she informed the TSA officer that she could not remove it without the help of pliers, and the officer gave a pair to her," said Hamlin's attorney, Gloria Allred, reading from a letter she sent Thursday to the director of the TSA's Office of Civil Rights and Liberties. 
Hamlirr said she heard male TSA agents snickering as she took out the ring. She was scanned again and was allowed to board even though she still was wearing a belly button ring. 
"After nipple rings are inserted, the skin can often heal around the piercing, and the rings can be extremely difficult and painful to remove," Allred said in the letter. 
Hamlin filed a complaint, but the TSA's customer serv­ice manager at the Lubbock airport concluded the screening was handled prop­erly, Allred said. 
Allred said she might con­sider legal action if the TSA does not apologize. 
On its Web site, the TSA 

warns that passengers "may be additionally screened because of hidden items such as body piercings, which alarmed the metal detector." 
"If you are selected for additional screening, you may ask to remove your body piercing in private as an alternative to a pat-down search," the site says. 
Hamlin would have accept­ed a "pat-down" had it been offered, Allred said. 
Hamlin was publicly humil­iated and has "undergone an enormous amount of physical pain to have the nipple rings reinserted" because of scar tissue, Allred said. 
"The conduct of TSA was cruel and unnecessary," Allred wrote. "The last time that I checked a nipple was not a dangerous weapon." 
TSA spokesman Dwayne Baird said he was unaware of the incident. There is no specific TSA policy on deal­ing with body piercings, he said, "as long as it doesn't sound the alarms." 
If an alarm does sound, "until that is resolved, we're not going to let them go through the checkpoint, no matter what they're wearing or where they're wearing it." 
People routinely pass through security wearing wedding rings without prob­lems, and it might take a larger bit of metal to trigger an alarm, Baird said. 
Shakespeare scholar to speak at DeBartolo

Jenkins balances 'Monologues,' 
Catholicism 
In 2006, University President Fr. John Jenkins outlined his criteria that must be met for "The Vagina Monologues" to be performed on eampus. Aeademie freedom, he said, must be maintained regardless of how the material meshes with teaehings of the Catholie Chureh. Allowing the play to be p1~rformed on campus is not the same as endorsing the eon­tent. of' the play. Jenkins, as the leader of a Catholic universi­ty, walked a line line between the "Catholic" and "university" characteristics of Notre Dame and found a delicate balance between 
OBSERVER
the two. 

In a replay of two years ago, amid mueh thought both inside and outside an actual class­
Editorial
debate on and off campus, Jenkins said the room. Studnnts at Notre Dame are smart enough 
"Monologues" could be performed on campus as long as the performances had an academic panel to discuss the play and its relation to Catholic teaching afterwards. 
Fort Wayne-South Bend Bishop John D'Arcy voiced his opposition to the play and Notre Dame's allowance of the play on campus while alumni and concerned Catholics also protested the play. D'Arcy has been the most prominent crit­ic of Jenkins' decision and has issued multiple statements condemning the "Monologues" and their performance on campus. The play, he said, portrays ideals, such as homo­sexuality, extramarital sex and sexual relations between adults and children that contradict Church teaching. By allowing the performance, he said Jenkins tacitly endorsed it, as well as the values contained in it. 
LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 

Observing Earth hour 
Students of Notre Dame, 
This Saturday, from 8:00 to 9:00p.m., is Earth Hour. an event created to raise awareness about energy usage and conservation and encourage people to reduce energy waste. Cities around the world will be participating (including world landmarks such as the Sears Tower in Chicago, Brighton Pier in England, Niagara Falls, the Sydney Opera House, the Golden Gate Bridge and Alcatraz in San Francisco, among others) by turning off the lights for a one-hour long period. 
Earth Hour is the highlight of a major campaign to encourage businesses, communities and individuals to take simple steps that will collectively make a dif'ference -from businesses turning off their lights when offices are empty, to households turning off appliances rather than leaving them on standby. It is important that the Notre Dame community join in this effort. We have asked that all rectors and rectresses switch off their dorm's hall lights. However, it is more important that the students do their part by turning off their room lights, TVs, computers, etc. This Earth Hour is intended to show that if each of us does our own little part, collectively, we will make a huge impact. 
This is not a political movement. This is a simple effort to reduce frivolous waste. So please join the millions of people around the world this Saturday and turn off your lights/electronic devices ... I'm sure you'll find that patty­cake (or whatever you do on Saturday evenings) can be just as fun in the dark, if not more so. 
Thank you for your support.

Jenkins said allowing the play on campus is nquivalent to discussing a philosopher or a writer whose views do not align with the Catholic Church. D'Arcy said watching a play is not the same as discussing it in a classroom setting because people are not required to participate in discussion of' the play and its relation to Catholic teaching as they would be in a classroom. 
I>'Arcy's criticism is legitimate and well-articu­lated, but it misses tlH~ mark. The entire University is a classroom meant to nnrich all areas of studnnts' lives and stimulate intelledual 
to realize that allowing the "Monologues" on 
campus does not mean the University endorses its content and realize its allowance on campus is meant to inspire dialogue and debate. 
Jenkins did not waiver in his decision to allow the "Monologues" to be performed on campus, which is a posi­tive thing for the University. Were he to cave to external pressure, he would confuse people as to the direction in which he was leading Notre Dame. lie would still receive criticism, but it would instead come from his faculty and stu­dent body, many of whom believe in promoting academic freedom. He was going to catch flak no matter what decision he made; and by allowing the play this year, he reaffirmed the University's commitment to academic freedom that will enable it to remain among the nation's elite univorsities.

Democratic dream team still viable 
To narrate the tale of the remaining two Democratic presidential candidates, modify the famous Charles Dickens opening phrase in "A Tale of Two Cities" to describe the current state of the race. 
"It is the best of times, it is the worst of times, the election of wisdom and the election of foolishness, it is the epoch of belief as well as that of incredulity, it is both the season of Light along with the season of Darkness, it is the spring of hope following the winter of despair. We have everything before us, but we may gain nothing. We were all going direct to heaven while campaigning in Iowa-we now seem to be going direct the other way." 
That passage written nearly 150 years ago tells the story of Charles Darnay and Sydney Carton, similar looking men who are, however, very different in their per­sonalities. Their particular doppelganger (a character who physically looks like another but with differing interests, beliefs, values, personalities, etc.) is that they both fall deeply in love with the same woman. Darnay is a romantic French aristocrat while Carton is a cyni­cal English barrister. In the end, Darnay marries the woman but is eventually convicted as an aristocrat and sentenced to be guillotined. Ultimately Carton visits Darnay in his prison cell, drugs him, swaps clothing and in an act of self-sac­rifice is executed in place of Darnay. 

Ironically, this tale could have been written as a metaphor to describe our modern-day campaigns of Democrats Hillary Clinton and Barrack Obama. It is indeed the best and worst of times for them as well as the Democratic Party. The volleys and returns about Clinton's inaccurate account of her 1996 visit to Bosnia and Obama's tepid distancing of himself from Reverend Wright's inflam­matory comments are natural elements of political campaigns. Yet both sides for­get that truth squads find each side lack­ing every day. 
For example, Clinton suggests that del­egates should act independently while Obama calls for delegates to follow vot­ing results. Yet when New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson chooses Obama despite his state voting for Clinton, Obama keeps him in silence while Clinton supporter James Carville calls him a Judas. Furthermore, it is disingen­uous for Obama to decry the campaign banter as distractions which he claims take away from the debate about war when in media interviews his own cam­paign manager continually accuses Clinton of saying anything to get elected -a famous 2000 tactic that Karl Rove used against Vice President AI Gore. Yet, despite complaints from both sides, cam­paigns are about making points and counterpoints. 
This week's NBC News/Wall Street Journal Poll found that Democrats are evenly split in support of both candidates at 45 percent. Both equally raised their negative ratings by 5 percent. Clinton's positive rating lost 8 points while 55 per­cent of Americans are disturbed about Obama's pastor, Reverend Wright. Interestingly, both Democrats poll at 44 percent against Republican John McCain, although McCain gains 4 points against Clinton. Regrettably, a fifth of both Clinton and Obama supporters say that they are open to voting for McCain. Moreover, this week's Gallop poll found that 28 percent of Clinton and 19 percent of Obama supporters could support McCain. 
Distressing as the political pundits may lament while responding to current polls, the Democratic Party and both candi­dates can unite for the fall election. But it will demand real courage from both candidates by joining as the dream team. Rather than the Obama camp taking offense when Clinton suggested that they could run together, Obama should have seen it as a signal from Clinton that she would accept the vice presidency. With the odds favoring Obama as the nomi­nee, he gambles that much of Clinton's supporters would actually vote against him if he does not ask Clinton to join the ticket. In the past, other candidates soothed more rancorous feelings with a unity ticket. 
Despite the delegate count, both Democrats have come so far in so many ways, and yet ironically their support remains evenly split. They must be as the Dickens characters and become a dream team to assure victory. To para­phrase the Dickens closing espousing Carton's thoughts before he faced the guillotine, "It is a far, far better thing that they must do, than they have ever done; it is a far, far better ticket that they go to than they (or we) have ever known."

'Monologues' debate continues 
A call for respect 
After seeing the opening night of the 'Vagina Monologues,' we were appalled. However, we were appalled not at the content of the play, but at the actions of certain members of the Notre Dame community. As we are all aware, there has been much controversy sur­rounding the staging of the Monologues at our Catholic university. Many people have been passing out flyers and writing letters in protest, however during the actual show, protesters scattered all over the auditorium promptly interrupted the show by getting up and leaving after the first monologue. 
We understand that many people hold different opin­ions surrounding this issue, yet disrespectful expressions of these varying attitudes should not be tolerated. All those involved in the Monologues have put in countless hours and effort towards this production. At the very least, your peers deserve your respect for all the time and energy they have put forth, even if you disagree with their message. 
Being at Notre Dame has taught many of us valuable life lessons. One that we think is most important and should not be missed is that of being open-minded and respectful to all. As part of this esteemed university, we are constantly presented with the challenge of under­standing complicated issues, and taking stances of our own accord entwined with personal thoughts, values, and beliefs. The mission of the University is to foster intellectual development through challenges to ourselves and one other. Students have the responsibility to active­ly engage in discussions about controversial issues, including social taboos, particularly in an academic set­ting. 
The point of going to college is not to be constantly bombarded with one-sided ideologies that are to be accepted without question. Rather, our minds should be stimulated with new and thought-provoking subject mat­ters. We then, as individuals, have been privileged with the intelligence to walk away from these experiences with our own opinions on any given topic. But to form your own opinion should always be done respectfully, especially when your peers are presenting the issue. 
After all. respect is something even Bishop D'Arcy advocates.

Allowance implies compliance 
I have seen the Vagina Monologues. Ever since I heard this play was going to be on the Notre Dame campus I have been doing research. I have read quotes, critiques, praises and parts of the play. I have talked to Holy Cross priests, Bishop D'Arcy himself, Fr. Jenkins, professors, alumni, my parents and my roommate. Yesterday my roommate and I went to the Vagina Monologues together. I didn't want to go. (I disagree with them being shown at a Catholic University, and have no desire whatsoever to see them.) But I went. I decided that I should go and see for myself. I am glad I went, for now I am absolutely certain they have no place on this campus. 
First let me say this is not an attack on the people who worked hard to put on this production, including two of my friends. This is simply pointing out what the Vagina Monologues are. 
The Vagina Monologues, excluding the "Introduction" and brief "Spotlight 2008," is com­posed of 15 monologues. Only three are actually about violence against woman, and the word vagina is only mentioned once. "Say It," "The Memory of Her Face" and "My Vagina was My Village," all touched my heart. They invoked empathy in me. However, including them with the other so called "humorous" monologues, made them just as much of a joke. The other monologues, especially "Because He Liked to Look at It." reduces women to their vaginas. 
Don't believe me? Read the script. The actress in this monologue speaks of a man's repeated request to "see her", and does not actually "see her" until he sees her vagina. Notre Dame, a Catholic university, has no business allowing this on campus. 
Two of the monologues were about lesbian sexuali­ty. In "The Little Coochi Snorcher That Could," the actress speaks about, even jokes about, her positive experience of being raped by an older woman. Imagine ifa Catholic priest wrote about molesting a young boy, and then Notre Dame allowed him on campus to speak about his enjoyment in this. This would never be allowed, and rightly so. 
The other monologue was about a lesbian prosti­tute who brags and jokes about dominating woman. Is this promoting awareness of violence against women? 
I have gone to see the Vagina Monologues to find out the truth. The truth is that they have nothing to do with academic freedom. Out of the approximately 350 people that went, less than 50 stayed for the dis­cussion. The Vagina.Monologues are a play, a form of grotesque entertainment, they scream of using your~ self and others for sexual pleasure. 
Notre Dame performs the Vagina Monologues three times every year. No other play comes to Notre Dame every year. Why are we allowing this? We need to stand up as a community to fight this. Too many are silent on the issue, not really caring either way. Notre Dame community, I beg you to no longer allow this on campus. It is hurting are community. 
Instead, Notre Dame should do more to promote awareness of sexual violence against women. Father Jenkins, you are a holy and gentle man. Please know that whoever told you this play was an academic event, whoever said it was to promote awareness of violence against women, lied to your face. Go see the play and you will know what I mean, that is ifyou can sit through it.

The talented cast deserves emdit for making the tilm successful.-Christina Hicci uses the perfect amount of anguish with9ut an excess of whininess. She evokes empathy from the audience and relates to them in a highly tangible way. Her mother, played by Cathnrine O'Hara, seems to recall every mother's inability to impose her will on her daughter. She embodies over­bearing parenthood with a comic talent that rails on the 
audience's nerves and makes them laugh. 
Additionally, James McAvoy artfully morphs "Prince charming" into a character that is realistic, flawed and soulful. Unlike the typical love interest, McAvoy is weighed by his own demons. He is incapable of rescu­ing himself, much less the damsel in distress. Hence his twist of fairytale love is offbeat, yet palpably appealing. Through his chemistry with Hicci, indie meets fairytale. 
The detail and craft put into every character makes the story rich and diverse. Even the supporting cast, which includes Heese Witherspoon, brings unique offerings that help reinvent an old story of romance and self-discovery. "Penelope" finally gets the modem fairytale right.

Its springtime and snow is falling in South Bend. Thankfully, Ryan Adams has provided a moody accompaniment to the melancholy. spaces outside our windows. His album "Love is Hell" carefully exposes the most dangerously emotive portions of the human heart and mind. Conceived in moments of heartbreak and ques­tioning of the authenticity of love, the record explores a vast range of experiences and ideas, eventually realizing love is indeed hell. 
Opening with the track "Political Scientist," Adams sings of a dysfunctional couple, both political scientists. Raddled by the passage of years and a hollow sense of love for each other, they exist with­in a world of uneasiness and bad memories. Adams sings, "Her husband's divorced but he treats her that way of course I Because he needs her just like he needs medicine I She forgets to write him anyway I What's red and white and nearly over I Political scientist." While the lyrics are somewhat
.-t.''ll..,,... unclear and vague, they highlight the confusion between the husband and wife, emotions the couple clearly cannot understand. 
Love is Hell 
Ryan Adams 

Label: Lost Highway Recommended Tracks: "Political Sdentisr "Please Do Not Let Me Go" and "Shadowlands'' 
c,;j.": 

A key element of the record is the intermixing of songs inspired by the stories and experi­ences of others amidst the hyper-personal, depressing songs inspired by Adams' own inti­mate experiences. One of the most delicate tracks on the record is the near-heartbreaking "Please Do Not Let Me Go." Without a doubt written at the end of a relationship, Adams sings "True love ain't that hard to find I Not that you will ever know I Would you leave for awhile? I Please do not let me go." It's simple, cutting and deeply poignant; one of the true gems on the record. 
One track likely inspired by the experiences of another, is "Shadowlands." A stirring por­trait of a decaying family thrust into the tor­ments of separation, drug addiction and broken love, the song subtly renders their saddest moments into the structure of the song with care and sympathy. In a tone that seems more rooted in lamentation than song, Adams sings "She's angry like a salesman I Who just couldn't make a sale I Threw the wedding ring in the sewer I And damned them all to hell I While the roaches climb the walls I From the hotel where he calls I Most peo­ple never find a love." Not straying from the obvious thesis of the album, Adams gives voice to a moment and a history understood by most 
everyone, yet rarely acknowledged with such honesty of tragic perspective. 
While Adams rarely features cover songs on his records, "Love is Hell" features a brilliant cover of the Oasis hit "Wonderwall." With a bluesy melody, the song seems fit to be heard in the back of a late night piano bar. 
Practically every song on the record is stel­lar. Yet it is not a record for sunny days and fresh romance. 
It's a record for the those late night hours staring through the window into the black­ness, just as it's a record for those late March days when you simply cannot believe that the daylight is still gray and the snow is still falling in South Bend.

of the week of the Great Western Lacrosse League for his six-point effort in the Dartmouth win. 
Head coach Kevin Corrigan said Thursday that Wharton and Swezey's collective suc­cess is mainly the result of experience. 
"The two of them have been playing together ever since [2005]," Corrigan said. "They came in this year and really started clicking. Both of them have been very aggressive but also smart with the ball, and they communicate really well. Playing together for a couple years now has definitely helped them." 
Between Wharton, Swezey, and senior midlielder Michael Podgajny, who tied his career high with four assists against Drexel, the Irish look set on the offensive end of the field. According to Corrigan, though, the team's main goal as it heads to Bellarmine will lie more on the defensive half of play. 

"The biggest thing for us is we need to establish ourselves in the way we have in our other games -defensively," Corrigan said. "That takes the pressure off of our offense. We can be a very defensive team when we're diligent and when we communicate. We've started off a number of our games very well and given up very few goals in the first quarter that's a really impor­tant thing because it relieves the pressure and allows us to play our game."

Louisville reaches Elite 8 with victory over UT 
Earl Clark nets 17 points in addition to 12 rebounds; Cardinals coach Rick Pitino now 8-0 in Sweet 16 play 
Associated Press 
CIIAHLOTTE, N.C. Tennessee's Wayne Chism tried to pick up the loose ball, only to be quickly outnumbered. Louisville's Earl Clark and Preston Knowles both dove to the floor, and the ball deflected 

.. oil" Chism out of bounds . It was what Hick Pitino loves: down and dirty defense, floor burns and hustle, and it's left the Cardinals' coach a victory away from a sixth trip to the Final Four. Clark scored 17 points and had 12 rebounds. and Pitino's mix of defenses made life miser­able for Tennessee in a 79-60 victory Thursday night that put third-seeded Louisville in the East Hegional final. Pitino, who has won an NCAA title and taken three schools to the Final Four, has l"ouisville playing its best basketball of the season when it counts most. After Louisville's two blowout wins last weekend, Pitino's sig­nature zone and pressure limit­ed the high-scoring Volunteers to 34-pereent shooting. The vet­eran coaeh improved to 8-0 in rngional semifinals and secured a date with top-seed North Carolina on Saturday night. "One of the keys on defense all year has been ehanging it up," Pitino said. "When you give any good team a steady diet of one 
defense, it's not quite as good. We extend our zone almost like a half-eourt trap, and we don't give the wings good looks." 
Terrenee Williams and Andre MeGee each added 13 points and David Padgett had 10 points and eight rebounds for Louisville ( 27 -8), which nearly blew all of a 16-point first half lead, only to take control mid­way through the second half. The Cardinals are vying for their second Final Four trip in six years under Pitino. lie also took them there in 2005. 
"The last three games, our offense and our defense have both been clicking," Pitino said. "There have been games where our offense has clicked or our defense has clicked, but our defense has stayed constant most of the year." 
Chris Lofton scored 15 points for No. 2 seed Tennessee, but was 3-for-15 in his final game with the Volunteers (31-5), who have never advanced beyond the round of 16. 
After a horrible start, Tennessee got within 37-36 early in the second half thanks to its own defensive pressure, which forced 20 turnovers. 
But then the springy Clark, who has come on in the NCAA tournament, had a driving layup, hit a baseline jumper and converted a three-point play in a 13-5 run. 

Louisville's defense didn't allow Tennessee to get back in it again, and the Cardinals hit all nine free throws over the final 5 minutes to keep Tennessee at bay. 
"I've been coaching a long time and never has the tempo of the game been dictated so much by an opponent," Tennessee coach Bruce Pearl said. "We usually dictate tempo. We attacked the pressure and we had opportunity to hurt the press, but we just didn't finish." 
JaJuan Smith added 12 point and Tyler Smith had 11, but the Volunteers continued their NCAA tournament shooting slump. 
Tennessee went 5-for-20 from 3-point range and finished 11­for-58 in three games. It was another disappointing end for Pearl, who has resurrected the program at Tennessee in his third season, but hasn't been able to get the Vols into the round of eight. 
The Volunteers, who were outrebounded 43-28, dropped to 0-5 in regional semifinals and finished with a school record for victories in a season. 
"This doesn't take much away from the finest season in the history of Tennessee basket­ball," Pearl said. "No team has accomplished the things these guys accomplished this year, and I'm awfully proud of them."

nated by a 3-0 defeat at the hands of Arizona. The Blue Demons ended up No. 6 in the final USA Today/NFCA poll of 2007. 
This weekend, DePaul is com­ing off of a special kind of warm­up to the Big East season. On Wednesday, the Blue Demons played an exhibition game against the USA National Team as part of its Bound for Beijing Tour. 
DePaul suffered a 23-0 loss at the hands of the soon-to-be Olympians, as starter Lindsay Dean gave up 13 runs on three home runs and four doubles in the opening frame. While the result of the exhibition game may not look pretty, playing against some of the best hitters, pitchers, and fielders in the world can only help with preparation for the Big East season. 
The most recent regular season game for the Blue Demons was a pard fought 1-0 loss to San Diego St.-a game that wasn't decided until the eighth inning. 
Conversely, Notre Dame's win over IUPUI was efficient, convinc­ing, and over after only five innings. Freshman pitcher Jody Valdivia earned her third shutout of the season, while senior Katie Laing and freshman Katie Fleury each posted two-RBI performanc­es. 
DePaul will offer a challenge for the Irish, but Bargar and her teammates are ready for Sunday. 
"[DePaul] has some great hit­ters and a great pitching staff," she said. "But I expect to win both games." 
The Irish and Blue Demons will square off twice Sunday with the first game set to begin at 12 p.m. at Cacciatore Stadium in Chicago.

Belles try to bounce back after hon1e loss 
By MEAGHAN VESELIK 
Sports Writer 
Saint Mary's heads off to Wheaton, Ill., this weekend to take on Olivet Nazarene and Wheaton College in the Wheaton Invitational Tournament. 
The Belles (4-6, 0-2 MIAA) lost their home opener Wednesday to conference rival Calvin (7-1, 1-0 MIAA), 6-3. 
"Calvin is a very good team, and we knew they were going to be very good coming in," Belles coach Chuck Rubino said. "But we had a good effort on our part. We had some good matches with our No. 2 in singles, Jillian Hurley, and in the No. 6 spot with Jessica Camp. In doubles, we let some slip away from us." 
In singles, the Belles went 2-4, with No. 2 Hurley and No. 6 Camp, both freshmen, the only two to come out on top for the Belles, winning in three sets each. Hurley defeated Calvin's Kaitlin Spoelhof6-7 (4-7), 6-1,6­4, bringing her singles record to 9-1. Camp went 6-1, 2-6, 7-6 (7­2), beating Calvin's Kelsey Bushhouse. Saint Mary's No.1 Camille Gebert fell 6-3, 6-0; No. 3 Betsy Reed lost 6-2, 7 -5; No. 4 Jessica Kosinski was swept 6-4, 6-0; No. 5 Lisa Rubino was defeated 7-5, 6-1. 
Saint Mary's fell in doubles competition on Wednesday as well. The No. 1 pair of sopho­more Camille Gebert and fresh­man Hurley won their fifth match together, bringing them to 5-5 as a pair with their 8-6 win over Calvin's Melissa Oosterhouse and Rachel Strikwerda. But the winning stopped there. The No. 2 duo of Reed and Rubino fell 8-6 by Calvin's Kaitlin Spoelhof and Jill Van Veen. The No. 3 team of Franca Peluso and Mary Therese Lee lost 8-0 to Calvin's Elisabeth Geenen and Rachel DeGroot. 
"I do think our doubles are improving," Rubino said. "Especially at No. 1 and No. 2 we are starting to learn how to play doubles. We're real close to winning sets and matches in the middle of our singles too." 
With a young team of two sophomores and eight freshmen, Saint Mary's has had to do some adjusting this season. 
"We need to learn to compete on the next level, and that's an ongoing process," Rubino said. "Our girls are learning that this is a new level, and it takes some adjustment, and we're working towards that." 
This weekend, Saint Mary's will take on Olivet Nazarene Friday morning at 11:30 a.m. and Wheaton College at 3 p.m. Saturday. Olivet Nazarene, ranked No. 18 in the NAIA, is 2­0 for their spring season, after winning the Tri-State Conference Championship in the fall. Wheaton is currently ranked No. 18 in the ITA for Division III schools. 
"This is going to be a very strong tournament," Rubino said. "Very stiff competition that will force us to try to improve. We'll give our best effort, and hopefully the strong competition will pay off towards the end of the season. Our goals are to win as many flights as we can and improve."

UNIVERSITY OF 
NOTRE DAME 
COLLEGE OF ARTS AND LETTERS 
Invites Nominations for the 
Sheedy Award 
Each year, the Sheedy Award, named for a former dean of the College of Arts and Letters, honors one member of the Arts and Letters faculty for outstanding teaching. 
Both students and faculty are invited to submit nomination letters for this year's award to: 
Stuart Greene Associate Dean for Undergraduate Studies 104 O'Shaughnessy Hall 
Deadline Monday, April 14, 2008 

Afflalo, starting in place of the injured Richard Hamilton, had a career-high 15 points as the Pistons clinched the Central Division title with a 85-69 vic­tory over the Miami Heat. 
''I'm out there with four All­

Star-caliber players, so they 
aren't going to be paying much 
attention to me," Affialo said. "I 
hit a couple shots early and 
that let me get comfortable." 
Afflalo talked to the media while watching his alma mater, UCLA, take on Western Kentucky in an NCAA tourna­ment game. 
"The best part about my situ­ation is that I've got a lot of veteran teammates that have all been through this before," he said. "They are able to calm me down and tell me what to do." 
Despite their constant teasing about his poor dunking ability -Rasheed Wallace told him after the game to shoot 3-point­ers on the fast break to avoid embarrassment -Afflalo has earned the respect of his team­mates. 
"He's done a great job all year," said Chauncey Billups. "He's worked hard in practice, he works hard before games, and when he gets an opportu­nity, he takes it. He's been big." 
The win ensured Detroit's fourth straight division title and sixth in the last seven years. 
"It means a lot," Billups said. "Every year, we're picked to finish second, third, maybe even fourth, but at the end, we're in first. That feels good." 
Detroit didn't clinch the title in stellar form, though. The Pistons came in having lost three of four, and struggled against the hapless Heat. 
"Those guys had nothing to lose, and they were going to try to prove some things -earn a roster spot or secure things for next year," Pistons coach Flip Saunders said. "We executed down the stretch. Any time you hold a team, I don't care who it is, to 24 points in the second half, you have a chance to win." 
Miami, which has lost 13 of 15, dressed nine players, including four rookies and two second-year players. 
"It's hard to evaluate young guys when you aren't playing them with your best players," said Miami coach Pat Riley. "We're asking them to do things we wouldn't normally expect them to do." 
Rookie Blake Ahearn, who came into the game with seven career points, led Miami with 15, but only two other players reached double figures. 
"The guys that are out there playing, we have a lot of pride," said Chris Quinn, who led Miami's starters with 11 points. "The only thing we can do is play as hard as possible. We've got 10 or 11 games left, and we've got to leave it all out there." 
Reserve Jason Maxiell had 15 points for Detroit, while Billups added 13 points and 11 assists. 
Miami led for most of the first half and had an eight-point advantage late in the second quarter, but Detroit narrowed the gap to 45-43 at intermis­sion. The Heat outrebounded the Pistons 20-15 in the half, including a 6-1 advantage on the offensive boards. 
The Pistons went ahead early in the third quarter, but wasted an opportunity to build a big lead. They missed seven free throws in the period, including five by Antonio McDyess. 
That let the Heat stay in the game, but Detroit had expand­ed the margin to 66-55 by quarter's end. Maxiell had 11 points and five rebounds in the period. 
Miami got within 70-65 with 

7:30 to go, but Rasheed Wallace answered with a 3­pointer. Afflalo's three-point play moved the lead to 80-69 with 2:39 left and the Pistons finally took control.

Squad opens spring season 
Captains will split time between Pac-10 Challenge and Lubber's Cup

The Notre Dame women's crew team, led by senior cap­tains Allison Marsh, Laura Pearson, and Amanda Polk, will open its 2008 spring season with two challenges -part of the team will head to Palo Alto, Cal. to compete in the Pac-1 0 Challenge presented by Windmere Real Estate, while the other will head to Grand Rapids, Mich. to compete in the Lubbers Cup. 

Notre Dame faces Stanford on Saturday morning, UCLA on Saturday afternoon, and UC Berkeley on Sunday morning. The team has won the women's trophy the past two years at the Lubber's Cup, and although they have a reduced squad this year, Coach Stone says they are up to the challenge. 
Coach Stone said the team had scrimmaged Northeastern over break, but has a more solid-line up at this point. The team has been training hard, and Stone is expecting a great performance from each mem­ber of his squad in its opening weekend.

Irish gear up for 3-gam_e series against Bearcats 
By LORENZO REYES Sports Writer 
About a week and a half ago, Notre Dame (12-7-1, 3-0) seemed to hit rock bottom after blowing a seven-run lead in the last two innings to Texas Pan­American. Talk about a turn­around. Headed into their three-game series against Big East rival Cincinnati (10-9, 2-1), the Irish have won five in a row since the Broncos' debacle. 
"We're much more confident now," Notre Dame coach Dave Schrage said. "We've been pitching a lot better and our offense has been explosive. It also helps when you have Evan Sharpley batting as well as he is. He's knocked six homeruns within the past couple of games and driven in a bunch of runs." 
After the sweep of Big East rival Georgetown, the junior was named the Big East player of the week for his offensive production, making him the first Irish player to gain the honor since Craig Cooper did so in April2006. 
With the win streak, Schrage said he can feel his younger players gaining confidence and starting to fit into their roles. 
"Oh, they're defmitely matur­ing," he said. "They're develop­ing as a group, and overall just playing with more confidence.· A lot of them are starting to understand where they fit in on the team. Sometimes when you come in as a freshman, you're not exactly sure what to expect, and since we play a lot of first­year kids, we had some early struggles." 
Notre Dame looks to stay undefeated in conference play against the Bearcats this week­end, while Cincinnati would love to gain some ground in the league standings. 
Despite the Irish momentum, Schrage does not want to take the Bearcats lightly, mainly because of their own recent bot streak. 
"They're playing real well," Schrage said. "They're coming in as a talented bunch on a four-game streak of their own. Their pitching is much improved from last season. [Cincinnati] also has a veteran lineup that features some speed. They're leadoff man, [senior] Tony Campana is the fastest guy in the league. They've got speed in the middle of the lineup, mixed in with some solid hit­ting." 
In the Irish five-game win streak, two factors have been constant -an offensive explo­sion, in addition to solid pitch­ing performances. In the five contests, the Irish have outscored their opponents by a margin of 58-9. 
At the heart of this offensive outburst have been a key num­ber of players, including sopho­more A.J. Pollock, who went 4­for-5 against Wisconsin­Milwaukee in the Irish 14-3 vic­tory Wednesday. He registered three singles, a triple, a stolen base, and RBI as well as scoring five runs in the contest. The sophomore even flashed some leather earlier this week, com­ing up with a pair of impressive diving catches in right field. Pollock leads the team in both hits (29) and batting average (.454). 
Pitching has also been strong for Notre Dame. Freshman Ryan Sharpley tossed five score­less innings, including a no-hit­ter through four against the Panthers. In addition to picking up his first career victory, the freshman also drastically cut his ERA in half, from 5.40 to 2.70. 
Taking the mound against Cincinnati in the series opener Friday will be junior right-han­der, David Phelps, who had three straight solid starts. Despite struggling in his opener, the right-hander has come back and frustrated opposing batters, going deep into games. In 20 of his past 21 starts, Phelps has lasted at least five innings. 
In the second game of the series, senior southpaw Wade Korpi will take the mound as he looks to improve on his 4-1 record. Korpi has allowed a team-high five home runs, although none have come over his past three starts. 
To finish off the series, the Bearcats will face sophomore Eric Maust whose 1.93 ERA is the team-low amongst the Notre Dame starters. One of the more encouraging aspects of Maust's pitching is that he has improved in each of his following starts. 
Coach Schrage does not shy away from his beliefs that his starters' play has been a major reasons for the hot streak. 
"It's definitely one of the main reasons behind the turn­around," Schrage said. "Maust gave us eight innings and Korpi gave us seven last week, and that's what we've been asking of them all season -the ability to go deeper into the games, and let Uunior] Kyle Weiland close out the games. We've been able to do that as of late and its turned into wins."

Sloppy UCLA ekes by WKU 
Associated Press 

UCLA can make a double-digit victory look difficult. 
With Kevin Love scoring a career-high 29 points, the Bruins nearly frittered away a 21-point halftime lead and hung on to defeat Western Kentucky 88-78 in the NCAA West Regional on Thursday night. 
Top-seeded UCLA (34-3) will play No. 3 seed Xavier on Saturday for a trip to its third consecutive Final Four. 
The Bruins were more relieved than happy to survive the Hilltoppers, who took advan­tage of UClA's sloppy play to pull within four points late in the game. 
"Unacceptable, unacceptable, unacceptable," Love said. "That's all I can say. 
"It was unacceptable the way we played in the second half. If we're going to keep playing like that, we're not going to be in this tournament very long." 
The Bruins routed over­matched Mississippi Valley State in the first round but haven't resembled a No. 1 seed since. They sweated out a two-point victory over Texas A&M in the second round. 
"That was another exciting game for all the Bruin fans out there," UCLA coach Ben Howland said. "We want to keep you guys awake and on the edge of your seat." 
Without Love, the Bruins would be in hibernation already. Love had 14 rebounds and hit 1 0-of-14 shots from the floor. 
Love had help from James Keefe, who had 18 points and 12 rebounds, both career highs. Russell Westbrook added 14 points and 11 rebounds. 
Keefe, a sophomore who has

battled back from shoulder sur­
gery last August, played sparing­
ly most of the season. 
"I mean, this is why I came back, you know?" Keefe said. 
Tyrone Brazelton scored 31 points -25 in the second half­and Courtney Lee added 18 for 12th-seeded Western Kentucky (29-7). 
"We just dug ourselves too big of a hole in the first half," Western Kentucky coach Darrin Horn said. ''I'm unbelievably proud of my team." 
Early on, the Bruins looked primed for a blowout, blitzing the Hilltoppers with a 23-4 run midway through the first half. 

UCLA led 41-20 at halftime, but Western Kentucky wouldn't go away. The Hilltoppers began pressing, and the Bruins started to unravel. They had 12 turnovers in the first 15 minutes of the second half and finished with 19, a season high. 
The Bruins appeared in trou­ble when point guard Darren Collison fouled out -for the first time this year -with 5:39 to play. Collison had four points and four turnovers. 
"They came out in some differ­ent angles," Collison said. "We didn't read the plays right. Everybodywas sped up." 
As the U.S. Airways Center crowd got behind them, the Hilltoppers went on a 19-6 run to whittle the lead to 61-57 with 
6:50 to play. Brazelton capped· the run by scoring eight unan­swered points in less than a minute, on back-to-back 3-point­ers and a layup. 
But A.J. Slaughter missed a 3­pointer that would have pulled Western Kentucky within one point, and then Love scored from close range. Josh Shipp, an erratic long-range shooter, hit a 3 to push UClA's lead to 68-59 with 4:30 to play. 
"That in a nutshell was the 

game," Horn said. "It changed 
all the momentum. We had spent 
so much energy to get back into 
it, played so hard to get back, if 
that three goes down and we cut 
it to one, it's a totally different 
situation down the finish." 
Howland was so desperate to stem the tide that he called his final timeout. Steadied, the Bruins did not let the Hilltoppers draw closer than six the rest of the way. 
Perhaps it was no surprise that UCLA let the scrappy Hilltoppers back in the game. The Bruins rolled into the desert on a 12­game winning streak, but they hadn't been dominant. Five of their last eight wins had been by three points or less, and another came after they forced overtime. 
The Hilltopper's had won eight straight games and reached the round of 16 for the first time since 1993, when Horn was a sophomore guard. At No. 12, Western Kentucky was the low­est remaining seed in the tour­ney, along with Villanova. 
Early on, Western Kentucky looked the part of a 12th seed. The Hilltoppers came out jittery, with four turnovers in the first three minutes. And they had more turnovers (nine) than field goals (six) in the first half. 
Lee made two of his lirst 13 shots from the floor. 
Things were no better at the other end, where Western Kentucky had no answer for Love. 
D.J. Magley and Jeremy Evans each fouled Love in a 5-second span in the first minute, and Evans went to the bench with his second foul three minutes into the game.

tion. 
"Competition always breeds excellence, as they always say. You look down the ice and you see Phii[lips] and [sophomore] Tommy [O'Brien] making big saves and playing well, and it makes you even better, makes you want to work even harder." 
While the favorite for the job was a mystery to the players, Jackson said he was confident Pearce would eventually be the one to emerge. 
"I told him going into the sea­son that it was his job to lose," Jackson said. "He was a junior, he had paid his due, he didn't mope, he didn't [complain]. He fought through the last two years, and I think that's a part of why he's having success now -he didn't let it impact him in a dramatically negative way." 
If anything, Pearce said, watching Brown, a Hobey Baker finalist last season, con­tributed positively to his play. 
"The one thing I admired most about David Brown was his eonsistency, especially last year," Pearce said. "He always was on top of his game, and our team was always in it -I don't think he ever had a bad game. and I remember one bad goal through the whole year, maybe." 
And Pearce, who boasts a eonference-best 1.95-goals­against average, has done just that. even through Notre Dame's second-half scoring drought that has seen the Irish score more than two goals just three times since the end of January. 
"The thing that has impressed me is that there's been a lot of pressure on him because we haven't been scor­ing," Jackson said. "Every game has been like if he gives up a goal, we might lose-1-0, 2-1, or whatever. He's dealt with that pressure very well, he hasn't broken down, and I think he played his best game as our goaltender 
-though the 
third-year Irish 

coach did have his initial questions about his net­minder. 
"I had the confidence to think he could be a good goaltender," Jackson said. "I was more con­cerned about his mental make­up, as far as his ability to over­come adversity, his mental toughness -because I didn't really know what it was. I'd challenge him all the time in practice, and I never got much of a response from him, so I didn't really know what to expect in that area. 
"Ability-wise, I thought he had it, and he's proved to me that he's ready to compete, battle, play tough when he needs to play tough. He has a great temperament in that he doesn't let things rattle him." 
That will be key for Pearce and the Irish tonight against a high-powered New Hampshire offense. Rest assured, though, that if Notre Dame extends it season, Pearce will have been a major factor. 
"No matter who wins Friday night or Saturday night or in the Frozen Four. a big part of it is going to be because of goal­tending," Jackson said. "You can't win a championship with­out great goaltending, at any level. It's just like winning a championship without a great pitcher or a great quarterback -you have to have that go-to­guy, that guy that can make the difference in goal."

many weapons that you really can't just go at one person and try to shut one person down." 
Because of that, McGraw said, she would look for a defense that could guard many people simultaneously. 
"The problem with Tennessee I think they're all going to get their points," she said. "So we've got to make a stand somewhere. That's what we'll have to decide." 
To combat Parker, Notre Dame has a senior class that isn't quite done yet. Gaines and guard Charel Allen, whose career-high 35 points put Notre Dame in the Sweet 16, continue to drive the team, McGraw said. 
"I think Tulyah and Charel have a great sense of urgency," McGraw said. "Tulyah has had that all year long. She has been the driving force of the team. She is the heart and soul of our group. She gives us energy and makes us go."

NO WOMEN'S TENNIS 
Irish try to stretch win streak to 6 
In-state rival No. 24 Indiana faces No. 19 Notre Dame at home 
By DAN MASTERTON Sports Writer 

No. 19 Notre Dame (12-7) will put its five-game win streak on the line against the No. 24 Indiana Hoosiers Sunday at 12 p.m. in the Eck Tennis Pavilion. 
Indiana (14-3) entered Friday with a seven-game win streak and has a chance to extend that streak to eight against Michigan State on Friday before the Hoosiers travel to South Bend for just their fourth road match of the year. 
Indiana is 2-1 in road matches but faces a tough test coming to Notre Dame as the Irish are 6-1 at home for the dual season. 
The Hoosiers' impressive overall record comes against an unimpressive schedule. Indiana has played just two ranked opponents and lost both matches whereas the Irish are battle-tested, going 2-6 against their eight ranked opponents. 
Indiana has also yet to face 

much individual competition. Over their 17 matches, the Hoosiers' singles players have faced only eight ranked singles players all season. The Irish have a 17-29 record in singles matches against ranked players. 
In their match-up with the Irish, the Hoosiers will face three ranked singles players in Notre Dame's No. 38 jun­ior Kelcy Tefft, No. 105 soph­omore Cosmina Ciobanu, and No. 114 sophomore Kali Krisik. 
The strength of Indiana's singles lineup is at the bot­tom. Brianna Williams, who has been playing No. 5 sin­gles, has won seven matches in a row and is 16-1 for the dual season. 
Myriam Sopel, who has been playing No. 6 singles in the Hoosier lineup, follows Williams. Sopel has tri­umphed all six times she has taken the court this dual sea­son. 
This dynamic pair teams up to comprise Indiana's most successful doubles duo. The pair of Sopel and Williams is 10-1 playing together, primarily as the No. 3 doubles team for the Hoosiers. 
The Irish doubles attack has dropped just two of 18 matches amidst a streak of six doubles points wins in a row. The pair of Tefft and senior Brook Buck remain No. 1 in the country while the No. 50 pair of Ciobanu and sophomore Colleen Rielley continue to quietly dominate with a 12-1 record. 
On the singles side, the Irish win stre-ak has been led by the strong play of Krisik. She is 16-3 on the dual sea­son and has won 14 of her last 15 matches. The domi­nance of Krisik and solid play and the bottom can often go overlooked in the lineup. 
The competition between Indiana and Notre Dame's strong bottom halves should be intense and could ulti­mately decide if the Irish streak will grow to six.

.Jackson, though, has plenty of experience on the larger rink during his time coaching the United States junior team. lie said some efl'ects of the rink, like the theory that the added open space leads to more offense, were nxaggnrated. 
"I think it actually hurts the game o!l'nnsively bneause there's so mueh additional space that you can kind of get lost in," .Jaekson said. "The biggest thing is that you have to learn to play mom inside the dots." 
"It's an ocean, so if you get trapped playing outside the areas that you normally do, you ean play a lot of perimeter hock­ey." 
However, .Jackson said the Wildcats like to spl'ead the puck out around the ice and this could work to their advantage on the bigger sheet. New Hampshire, like the rest of the IlEA. plays a much more open, free-flowing game. The eonfewnce is tradi­tionally smaller andl quiekcr than tho rough-and-tumble CCIIA.

If the Irish beat UNH on Friday afternoon, they will move on to faee the winner of the Miehigan State-Colorado College matehup. 
The Irish have plenty of expe­rience with the Spartans, having played them twice in CCI-lA play this season, falling 3-1 in East Lansing and tying 1-1 in the Joyce Center. Notre Dame hasn't faced the Tigers, though, since it lost 3-1 in the 2005 season. 
"That bracket is awesome," Van Guilder said. 'There's awe­some teams there." 
For now, though, Jackson and 

the Irish  are focused  on  New

"We're 120 minutes away from playing in the Frozen Four, and that's the way we have to look at it," Jackson said. "But we've got to tick off every minute with great play. We have to worry about the first minute before we worry about the first 20 or the first 60."

because they were good. From 1992 until the present, the Wildcats have missed the NCAA Tournament only three times (1993, 1996, 2001 ). They played for the national championship twice (1999, 2003), and tickets to see their games were hot commodities mostly gotten from friends who knew friends who had a eouple extra. 
UNH players came to skate and teach at our youth hockey practices, ·and we played a lot of our games on their massive Olympic ice surface at the Whittemore Center. During the winter that the Whit was being built, the Wildcats practiced at our local rink, a 30 second bike ride from my house. 
My teammates from the youth hockey league would line around the rink during their practices, hoping for a stray puck shot over the net or trying to snag a broken stick. 
The Wildcats were larger­than-life celebrities to kids and adults alike, regarded much in the same way that Notre Dame football players often are. 
Not much has changed since then. And that goes for the one stigma that sticks to UNI-I like wide right haunts Scott Norwood. 
The Wildcats choke in the NCAA Tournament. For a Notre Dame team that 
struggled the second half of the season and lost two games before backing into the Tournament as a No. 4 seed against No. 1 UNI-I today, the Wildcats' Tournament history is a bright spot. 
Last year, No. 1 seed UNH lost to No. 4 Miami in the first round regional game played in Manchester, N.H.-a 60­minute drive from their cam­pus. 
The Wildcats have lost by scores of 7-1 (as a No.3-seed to No.2-seed Harvard in 1994) and 9-2 (in the first round to No. 6-seed Denver in 1995 as a No. 3-seed). In 2000, auto­bid Niagara wiped them out of the first round with a 4-1 sur­prise. 
Overall, UNI-I has a 12-20 reeord in the NCAA Tournament, including losses in the championship game to Maine and Minnesota -the latter a 5-1 slaughter that was never close. 
Notre Dame has played a grand total of three Tournament games with a 1-2 record, two games of which came last year with a first­round win before a quarterfi­nal loss to Michigan State. 
The UNI-1 Tourney history book is a leather-bound Encyclopedia Britannica vol­ume to Notre Dame's Chinese food takeout menu. And that experience counts against a lot of teams. 
But maybe not the Irish. 
Notre Dame has an ace up its sleeve, the king of hearts that took the Irish from league bottom feeder to national con­tender. That man is Irish coach Jeff Jackson. 
Jackson already has won three national championships and seems destined to paek on a few more before he's done. He knows how to eoaeh his players for the biggest stage in college hockey, which has always been a criticism tossed around UNH coach Dick Umile. 
In hockey, the intangibles ­the ability to motivate, to instill eonfidence, to never under or overestimate an opponent-make a huge impact. The truth is any team can win a hockey game, no matter how bad they look on paper. It only takes a weird carom ofl' the corner boards to the front of the net or a lucky deflection to turn a game. 
UNI-I's Tournament futility could just be a case of bad luck repeated on an endless loop that is finally broken this year. Or Notre Dame's strug­gles in the second half of the season eould disappear behind a miraeulous playoff run. 

It could go either way. But if the Irish pull off the upset on Olympic ice and defeat No. 1­seeded New Hampshire in the Rockies tonight, don't be sur­prised. 
New Hampshire doesn't always do what it should, trust me on that one.

It's Tourney time 
Squad faces NH after nearly missing NCAAs 
By SAM WERNER Sports Writer 
Notre I>anw may be lucky to have made the NCAA tourna­ment, but now that it has, the Irish plan on making some seri­ous noise. 
"We have nothing to lose. It's one game or done," Irish head eoach Jeff Jackson said. "We might as well go out and empty the tank and play tho very best we can to see if we can't play again Saturday with an opportu­nity to get to the Frozen Four." 
Just making the Tournament was a challenge for the Irish, who qualified despite losing in tho CCIIA semifinals against Miami, and then falling to Northern Michigan in the eonso­lation game. Due to the eomplex nature of the seleet1ion proeess, if Notre Dame had tied NMU instead of lost, it probably would have bmm left out of the NCAA Tournament.

After playing backup, Pearce claims top spot, CCHA top goalie honor 
By MATT GAMBER 
Associate Sports Editor 
What a differenee a couple of months has made for Jordan Pearce. 

When the junior goalie took the net in the season opener on Oet. 12 against Wisconsin, he was still in the midst of a battle for his starting spot with high­ly-touted freshman Brad Phillips right on his heels. 
When Pearee skates into goal tonight with Notre Dame's sea­son on the line, however, he'll do it as Notre Dame's unques­tioned baekstop, the 2008 CCIlA goalie of the year. 
"If it wasn't for him, we prob­ably would have had a difficult time making the Tournament," eoaeh Jeff Jackson said. "He's played well throughout this whole !second-half] stretch. He's become the baekbone of our team, and he's gotten bet­ter as the season's progressed." 
But that doesn't mean he did­n't showcase his ability right from the get-go, right wing Mark Van Guilder said. 
"The first game of the season against Wiseonsin, he was amazing in that first period, right away," the senior captain said. "That was huge for his eonfidenee, and he's built on that and rode it all the way through the season." 
Though Pearee is in his third year with the Irish program, his action was rather limited for his first two as the back up to All-American David Brown.

Like someone who was born and raised in Tusealoosa on 'Barna football, there was no college team more important than UNII hoekey. OK, Alabama football and New Hampshire hoekey may differ more than their fans' aceents, but there was no denying that in rural New Hampshire, the Wildcats were king.

Pearee started six games as a freshman and just three a year ago, and while he was impres­sive in posting a 2.01 goals­against average as a sopho­more, he remained a relative unknown. 
"There were question marks," Van Guilder said. "We knew he was a good goalie coming into the snason, but everyone, with losing Brownie from last year, was saying 'I low are we going to replaee him?' Well, we'rn going to replace him with Jordan Pearec, that's what we're going to do. 
"There's a lot of people that were doubting that he eould have the year that he's having, and he's got so much confi­denee now after the snason he's had." 
Pearce agreed. though he still
