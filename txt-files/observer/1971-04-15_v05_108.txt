Muskie uvset with FBI move
... 

WASHINGTON (BPI) 
Sen. Edmund S. Muskie, D. Maine, accused the FBI yesterday of spying on Earth Day rallies held a year ago to glorify the environment. He said Congress should set up a board to monitor all government agencies who gather intelligence on civilians. 
In a Senate speech, Muskie said the FBI had no business eavesdropping on citizens protesting pollution where "no crime or threat of crime was involved nor ... any violence threatened." 
He inserted into the congressional record and released to reporters, copies of a document on FBI stationers describing the Earth Day rally held April 22, 1970 near the Washington Monument. The report listed the speakers at the demonstration, including Muskie himself. 
He said the FBI compiled between 40 to 60 reports on other Earth Day rallies held around the nation.

The marriage was kept a secret except from Father Duryea's close friends and parish staff until two months ago. 
Last week 200 parish families were informed and with few exceptions they supported their pastor, but Father Duryea was suspended by the archbishop Monday. 
In a special statement, the parish council said their pastor "has given us more than we can ever repay." The council said the churcl-t's celibacy rule should be

SMC meeting changed 
Sister Olivette Whelan, chairman of the St. Mary's board of trustees, cancelled its April 24th meeting, at which the decision for unification with Notre Dame was scheduled for confirmation. 
In cancelling the meeting, the mother-general of Midwest province of the Sisters of the Holy Cross said, "We are postponing the meeting so that it will better coincide with the meeting of the Notre Dame Trustees. The meeting will be held on May 14." 
She did not anticipate that the Board would have any problems approving the unification statement. 
As a result of the cancellation of the meeting, the Student Policy Committee. which usually meets the day before the Trustees to discuss the agenda, will not meet April 23. Their agenda was to include, not only unification policies, but also an evaluation of off-campus housing with the possibility of extending it to juniors and other students over 
21. 
Neither Student Body President Kathy Barlow nor Sr. Immaculata Driscoll, dean of students, could predict the future of off-campus housing for students planning to move off next year. 
Although the Board will not meet, Sister Olivette said that the executive committee, a group of eight Board members, will meet as planned on April 24 to discuss the college's plans for unification.

Any man's death diminishes me, because I am involved in Mankind; 
And therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for 
thee. 

John Donne 
FOUNDED NOVEMBER 3, 1966 NOTRE DAME, INDIANA 
The Last Chance 
It is sad to watch the death of a publication. The demise in some cases 
comes quickly, here today, gone tomorrow. For others though it is a slow , process. The quality of the magazine goes down, the number of issues are cut, expenses are watched carefully and anything that smacks of being 
extra or added is slashed. 
For a publication competing in the open market, the possibility of 
failure is one that stalks it constantly. Itis, essentially, selling itself to the 
public. If the public loses interest then the publication will die. 
Some publications though depend on a benefactor of sorts to finance 
their operation. Their situation is perhaps more a perilous one; for they 
depend on the whim and mood of the benefactor in addition to or instead 
of popular appeal. 

The latter case is true of many college publications. Newspapers and 
magazimes are often funded directly out of the school's budget. As such, 
they are subject to the whims and vagaries of ruling powers as well as the 
financial condition of the school. If the institution is running in the red, 
pubL.-:ations, usually the student ones, are prime candidates for the 
paring knives. 

In such a situation the students running the publication have little or no 
say over the fate of their vehicle. They are dependent upon the ad­
ministration for their money, their financial affairs are controlled by 
employees of the school and if the editors are paid, they, in a sense, are 
employees of the school. There is no sense of autonomy, and hence no 
sense of real freedom for them. 
The announcement that the Scholastic's budget has been sharply cut-­
cut enough to warrant a reduction of the number of issues by a third -­
demonstrates just how much that publication is open to those 
vicissitudes. 

But this cut, which appears so painful to the present Scholastic 
management, is in reality that magazine's last best chance to assert its 
independence. The rpocess by which the publication will be removed 
from the public's eye has begun, if it is accelerated by financial pressures 
next year the death knell will have sounded. 
At the beginning of the year the Observer offered to have the Scholastic 
published weekly through our facilities, for a savings of $15,000 per year. 
That offer still stands. For $25,000 the Scholastic could publish a 24 page 
magazine on paper better than the kind you're reading now. For $25,000 -­
part of which could be supplied by advertising revenue and part of which 
could be supplied by a student publications fee --the Scholastic would be 
able to publish a course evaluation book in addition to their weekly 
magazine. 

Editorial boards would, of course, be entirely distinct and none of the 
elements of "merger" that the Scholastic found so odious when this 
proposal was first raised can be construed. This is a business offer, pure 
and simplle. The Observer offers to act as publishing agent for the 
Scholastic. The savings should be enough to make the Scholastic 
autonomous. If that is what they're after, we suggest they accept the 
offer.

Progress and Efficiency 

The Student Life Council has been called many things since its in­ception in the spring semester of 1968 including the most potent legislative body in the history of Notre Dame. It came with the winds of spring and has been imitating those winds every since, blowing up a breeze strong enough to launch the sailing club on a cruise from here to eternity. 
Little progress has been made by the present body because it has 
wasted time in long debates over the minutes of a pervious meeting 
and in general over details that could be ironed out in committee 
meetings. This was illustrated during the seven months devoted to the 
sophomore car issue. 
A proposal first appeared at the September 24, 1970 meeting of the 
SLC,. It was finally approved on March 30, 1971. During this period, 
the council members argued over facts that no one bothered to check 
for accuracy. As John Barkett said during his campaign, no one did 
their homework. 
Finally a committee was appointed to research all areas of the 
proposal and to draft a proposal either for or against the idea. In the 
course of two months, the proposal was drafted, debated, revised and 
approved. 
At the last meeting of the SLC, Sophomore Floyd Kezele suggested 
that the body meet less frequently, perhaps once a month. This sounds 
absurd since the body can't accomplish anything during the four hours 
it now meets per month. However, Kezele wants to establish four 
standing committees to research, draft and present proposals to the 
steering committee for scheduling. Petty haggling would be long over 
with before any proposal reached the floor. 
When a proposal comes to the floor under Kezele's plan, debate will 
be limited to forty minutes and then a vote will be required unless two­
thirds of the body votes to prolong discussion. This format wokld allow 
at least two proposals, possibly three, to be fully debated at any given 
meeting if the time limit is strictly enforced. 
The steering committee will meet April 20 to discuss other methods 
to improve the SLC's efficiency. It is highly probable that Kezele's 
itiP!l u1ill ho rnnrlillo.M 
This meeting of the committee is very important because the future success of the SLC rides on its product. If the new council which is due to take office May 1, is left to solve the problems of efficiency by itself, more time will be senselessly wasted in debate over what the problems really are. The present body is in the best position to recommend a solution because they know the problems. 
Given the verbose history of the SLC, the steering committee probably will not be able to come up with a solution before the new council arrives. If things do go well, a proposal can be expected from the steering committee by up to May 1, thus eliminating any chance for ~he current body to unleash another gale that would produce nothmg but tired lungs. 
The new SLC must be progressive and imaginative, qualities that are sadly lacking in the current membership. It must also be non­partisan. If it is free from partisan windbags, who are more concerned with the vested interests of those they represent than the general good of the University, the SLC could have a new procedure within three meetings. This would allow for a period of adjustment for the new members. 
Already there are signs of a progressive council in ex officio member John Barkett. He has two proposals to his name, both in the interests of everyone. The first proposal, to reduce the current membership by one-half, had good intentions but was in the wrong direction. We don't need a smaller council, but we do need a council that knows what it is doing andsaying. Time is too valuable to waste on arguments such as whether a motion was voted on at the previous meeting. 
Barkett's second proposal passed and in quite surprisingly good time. The move to seat three representatives from St. Mary's is the most progressive action sicce graduate students were given speaking priviledges late last year. 
Campaigns for student seats begin April21. Faculty representatives have already been elected but the final results were not yet available. There has been no word on the administration, which will probably send the same spokesmen back to sit on still another council. 
. The faculty has elected, hopefully with wisdom. There is not much that can be added about the administration. It is now up to the students to prudently elect its representatives. 
It is time for change. The new SLC can take long strides towards progress if it follows this saying about turtles, "Behold the turtle! He never makes any progress unless he sticks his neck out." 
Elect a turtle for Notre Dame.

the conspiracy is ours 

that beautiful, courageous, exceptionally --------------------------------­
We live in strange times, all of us have stopped in the last couple of years to ask ourselves, "Just what are we doing?" "How did everything get so turned around?" The time for this wondering has now passed. Our hesitation in using the word "revolution" must also pass. We must admit to ourselves that each of us is called in some way to move from ordinary to extraordinary action in order to reclaim our society. It is no longer enough that we profess oneness with other men, we must act it out. 
This fall and winter, all over the country young people questioned their ef­fectiveness in ending the war---and "if we demonstrate, won't there be violence?" Commitment is worthy, only as the People felt unsure as to where to go and object of that commitment is worthy. I many became confused and defeated. have been fortuna.te in being reminded of Many went back to classrooms, dorm life, this at least once a year since coming to communities and hibernated. As we were Notre Dame. My freshman year it was going through the changes, the established 
open, totally humane and wholly un­pretentious man of our time, Dick Gregory. My sophomore year sharing the 1st Moratorium Day with Dave Darst and Mike Cullen enabled one to understand what their resistance was all about as best exemplified by Michael's words at Milwaukee, "I believe we can dance. By God we're going to dance." 
This year it was a little bit different. It was cold and dark, the wind bellowed above all that had transpired this night at Stepan Center. We stood out behind the Center now, the snow blasting in from all sides and as I try to explain what took place I can only think of a poem I once wrote to a friend: 
We two are breathless 
Standing close together 
Looking at the world flutter by 

You gently, firmly take my hand in 
yours 

My eyes gaze into yours, deeply they 
lock 
You touch my cheek 
And not speaking 
We say 
everything 
To each other 

I saw a small tear trickle down the cheek 
of William Moses Kuntsler as he told me to 
send his love to a friend of ours who he 
could not see. I knew then that he spoke 
from deep within his heart and that he was 
a man who grasped the meaning of that 
often used and abused word.

It is that time of year again when the Notre Dame cheerleaders abandon the grass of Notre Dame stadium and the front row seats in the ACC for the friendly confines of St. Angela Hall, and their third season, that of cheerleading tryouts. St. Angela, that antiquated edifice that reminds one of the "One-room school house that Grandpa went to" is the scene where every year the cheerleaders struggle to replace the retiring members of the squad with freshmen talented in gymnastics, porn porn routines, cheers etc. This year's group of seventy people was the most talented ever and the fC'ur people selected to the squad should help next year-s cheerleaders show ND fans some new innovations. 
The four selected were: 

Ann Cisle, a 19 year old business major from Hamilton, Ohio; Bob Benkendorf, also 19, and a pre-med major from Bushnell, Illinois; Mary Kraft, 18, a history major from Flint Michigan, and Charley Morrison, 19, a Business major from Columbus, Ohio. When asked a few of the usual pertinent questions about family, Notre Dame, and the world the following interesting facts were revealed. 
Charley Morrison was a Bengal Bouter and lost in the semifinals to eventual champion Tom Kress. 
Mary Kraft was selected last year as the USCA <United States Cheerleading Association) Grand National Champion Cheerleader. 
Ann Cisle says the most exciting time she ever had was attending the Cotton Bowl with her "Spirited" Dad (Dad graduated from du lac in 1946) 
Bob Benkendorf is a drag racer. 

Bob also thinks that "Cheerleading ought to be fun." 
Mary came to ND..SMC to get away from the cold Michigan weather. 
Ann Cisle is at Notre Dame because of its Academic advantages, expecially in the college of business. (Take heart business jocks) 
We have all coped with this mood for a year, to go beyond it requires a strange measure of those qualities which can only flourish when a people have become conscious of their own human losses and begun to create the tools of human gain. But one guesses we have not lost enough, or suffered enough or grown conscious enough of what is happending to our brothers. Because of this we lack com­munity, imagination, courage, com­passion and the hope and ingenuity that we so badly need. Is it true as Dan Berrigan has said, "in order to be healed; our illness must get worse?" 
After talking with members of the faculty and students about their feelings on the current situation I feel we may be moving above this. I believe that we do feel enough and now we have a choice and a chance to prove it. 
There is an inner requirement of the 

media sketched a picture of a dying movement, too frustrated and frightened to move. The media tried to tell us that American young people are "tired of rebelling." They have said that our committment is a shallow one and that we are slipping back into the tranquil 1950's of careers and classrooms. They have tried to convince us that we would rather shed our tears over "Love Story" than over the reality of our Vietnamese brothers and sisters and our high school classmates now dead in the fields of Vietnam, Cambodia 
and Laos.

ruin we have made of half

peace within and as we 
look at the future before

thought that there may be

human species that mankind has been conscious of through all the ages. When you look into the eyes of Thomas Merton, Dan Berrigan, Mike Cullen or William Kuntsler you can see that consciousness. It demands of life in at least some of its aspects and some of its moments that it be true, that it be good, and that it be beautiful.When we look out at the ruin we have made of half of the world, we can't feel peace within and as we look at the future before us we are chilled by the thought that there may be no peace ahead. During April, . the Notre Dame com­
munity will be offered a number of ac­tivities to participate in. Hopefully this will lead to some fruitful thought and action which will carry through the summer and into next fall. Mr. Kuntsler related in his speech the various complications, ab­surdities and stark realities which the Harrisburg Conspiracy Trial will have to contend with. A committee is being formed at Notre Dame for students and faculty who are interested in helping to provide information, raise funds, and working on other actions associated with the trial. A number of activities are being planned to coincide with the Refugee Aid Program. 
I started out by talking about William Kuntsler, who most of us heard speak Friday evening. The response we will give this event is an individual and a personal one which we must reflect on within ourselves. We would do well to remember the final sentence in Professor O'Malley's moving tribute to this man, "You are a man of law and of love." The noted psychologist, Eric Fromm has stated that the opposite of love is not hate but apathy. Now the choice is ours. 
Will we gain strength from each other and unite in helping with the task before us or will we allow the opportunity to slip by under the guise of "that's the mood." Perhaps we would do well to reflect on a line from Zorba the Greek: "To act as if death did not exist or to act thinking every minute of death is perhaps the same thing." Think of it not, the death still goes on and surrounds us in our actions or in­actions. The possibilities of life coming out of all this are ours and ours alone. 
The challenge which is ours was so amply put at a recent rally for the Harrisburg Six. Father Paul Mayer, a Jewish refugee from Nazi Germany, one of the co-conspirators currently teaching at New York's Theological Seminary, who also was a Benedictine monk for eighteen years and who worked in Latin America and the civil rights and peace movements in this country and who will be coming soon to address the Notre Dame com­munity issued the challenge we must all think about answering. Mayer told the students at a rally: "Don't say, 'Let Dan do it' or 'Let Phil do it,' or 'Let Kuntsler do it,'--or 'Let Che do it' or 'Let Jesus do it' If you don't do it, nobody will." The question is with the consciousness inn all of us. Let our actions now, and not our reactions later provide the answers. Indeed, how much longer can we afford to wait. 

On the left, Mary Kraft displays her form. Below, Bob and Ann, on the left, and Charley and Mary, on the right, take a brief moment's rest during practice.

Just as other large organizations, the armed ser­vices are constantly seeking top­quality leadership. The methods used to find good leaders are initiated at the high school level and applied again to college 
students, college graduates and also to students of graduate 'schools. 
One of the primary sources of competent leaders is the ROTC program. Every year, high schools throughout the country are visited by speakers from the various armed services hoping to inspire interest in senior and junior males through their recruiting lectures. These lec­tures are designed to acquaint students with the opportunities that are open to them if they should join one or another of the programs.

Every fall, the three men visit the local schools, usually as a team, and present their lecture. They also leave various pamphlets that further explain opportunities and enrollment procedures. 
Major Edward C. Redican, commanding officer of the Air Force unit here, says, "We simply wish to inform the seniors about ROTC. The average senior in high school has not made up his mind about college by the time vVe make our visit. We find that many are interested in what we hll-ve to offer."

The present hall ticket 
distribution policy for coex 
dinners will be changed as of April 
21 for all Notre Dame students, 
Bob Ohlemiller, chairman of the 
coex dinner program, announced 
yesterday. 
The new distribution process will be in effect until May 12, the first day of exams. Instead of each hall having one special night 
set aside for their coex dinner with tickets being distributed to halls, tickets will now be available to all students for the day on which they wish to eat at St. Mary's. 
Ohlemiller said that the new program will allow a "greater flexibility" for students. 
Students may pick up their coex dinner tickets starting Monday_,. AI>_ril 19, in the second floor LaFortune ballroom from 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. Tickets will be available during this period 
every Monday. The tickets, however, are only good for that day of the week designated on the ticket. Seventy-five tickets for each weekday will be distributed. 
After all the tickets are given out for a particular day of the week, ten remaining tickets will be available at the Student

Hesburgh was asked recently if he were con­sidering banning ROTC from the campus, he replied, "Not at alL I might remind you," he said, "that students here receive upwards of $600,000 in aid from the ROTC units. Many of our young men would not be able to attend the university if not for this aid." More than half of those involved in ROTC are not on scholarship.

ND's Buster Brown a shoo-in for success 
by E .J. Kinkopf Observer Sports Writer 

Tennis Coach "Tiger" Tom Fallon can thank fate, his lucky stars, or even his horoscope for his number one player on the 1971 Irish Tennis team. 
For unlike Mickey Mantle, who was probably born catching a baseball, or Bobby Orr, who learned to skate before he could walk, Buster Brown began his tennis career purely by accident. 
Buster broke his right arm at the age of ten playing Little League baseball. And while the right arm was rested in a sling, he put the left to use swinging a tennis racquet. 
After the arm had fully men­ded, he switched from southpaw to righty and promptly began making himself known in tennis 
Ranked eighth nationally in the boys twelve and under division, and sixteenth nationally in the sixteen and under, the blond­haired junior from Sarasote, Florida left the sunshine state and journeyed to the land of the Hoosier. 
Carrying the above creden­tials, along with varsity honors in football, baseball, and tennis, Buster was sought by Arizona State, Georgia Tech, Columbia, Florida University, and Notre Dame. 

And looking at the tanned Brown, you feel like asking him, "What's a fella like you doing at a place like this, when you could be soaking' up them rays in places like Florida, Arizona or GEORGIA?" 
" ..well I guess the educational facilities had a part in but I

The Graduate View 
:::::::::::::::::::;:;:=:=:=:=:::::::::::;:::::::::===============================Ireland Revisited 
What I thought was going to be a rather humorous narrative of the Rugby Club's Spring Trip to Ireland hasn't quite turned out that way. It seems my sources of information invented several episodes, distorted others, and generally mis-represented most of the trip. 
So let's set the record straight. The Rugby Club did not march through Ireland like General Sherman went through Georgia. They did not spend all their time drinking and carousing. They did not bust up any dances. Any trouble that arose was due to a few individuals who were punished accordingly. Any damage that was done was paid for and anything stolen was returned. 
The Ruggers spent their vacation just like any other touring group would have. They were well-treated by local people, they did lots of sight-seeing, the went to parties and dances given in their honor, and they played lots of damn good rugby. 
The Club got some lessons in the sport of rugby the way the experts play it. In Ireland, teams are ranked in three divisions. The club played two middle division(junior) teams and two upper division(senior) teams. 
The Ruggers defeated Abbey Feale 22-8 and tied Bandon 3-3 in the junior games. Had the latter game not been called at the half due to the weather it is likely that the Club would have won since they had the wind and field advantage for the second half. 
Against the senior teams, the Club was 0-3. These teams contain the best caliber players in Ireland. University College Dublin has a player on the All-Britain touring team this year. Against UCD, the Club was tied 3-3 before UCD broke the game open in the final minutes. University College Gallway beat the Club "A" team 19-Q, and the "B" squad 34-18. 
The Ruggers played well in these games despite the rigorous travel schedule and key injuries to Mike Morrison and John Zukaitis. Morrison told me yesterdaythat he felt the Club could play UC Dublin about even if the game was held in Sol,lth Bend. 
The Ruggers weren't chased out of Ireland. In fact, they've been invited to return next year and they have letters to prove it. 
really wanted to go to school in a 
different part of the country. I'd 
been living in Sarasota all my 

life ... and well ... the Notre Dame 
thing ... you know when you were a 
kid and all of that." 
Well, sun or no sun, Buster 

seems to keep that tan year 
round, and as a starter for the 
squad for three years now, he's 
become far more dependable 
than the Indiana sunshine. 
Dependable may be an un­derstatement. Buster who was elevated to the number one spot this year, returned from the team's trip to California with a very respectable split in eight matches. 
Since then he has compiled a three and one slate, the only loss coming at the hands of Indiana's Mark Bishop, who Buster describes as an "unspectacular player who does every thing well, and just keeps coming and dogging you." 
He is also very high on his teamates, the rest of the Irish "racqueteers" who also made a good showing in the land of bikinied babes and Disneyland attractions. 
Phil Krill-Irish infield bulwark 
rby Vic Dorr 
'Observer Sportswriter : 

When people talk about Phil Krill, they don't remember him as the guy who's been Notre Dame's regular shortstop--or close to it--for the past three seasons. They don't remember him as a member of the 1970 Cape Cod League All-Star team either, or even as the player who holds the Irish record for the most assists 007) in a single season. 
Krill is remembered, instead, as the cocky freshman who made a practice of handing out engraved calling cards to anyone who seemed interested. And, as most calling cards do, these bore a legend: 
"Have glove, will travel--Phil Krill of Erie." 
A senior now, Krill is the first to laugh at his undergraduate stunts, and insists that he still has plenty of cards left. 
"They were just a gimmick," he says. "I had them made up in high school, and brought them up here as kind of a joke. And I really didn't use them too much.. .I've still got loads left." 
But Krill has lived up to the 

publicity. As the ND shortstop 
he's been impressing people 
since his first year and is, ac­
cording to his coach, "an ex­
cellent pro prospect and the 
bulwark of the infield." 
At least one major league 

team, the Los Angeles Dodgers, 
considered Krill an "excellent 
pro prospect" when he graduated 
from high school. 
"The Dodgers wanted to sign 

me right after I'd graduated, but 
I'd already signed a letter of 
intent to Notre Dame, and had to 
turn them down. And, since the 
scouts can't approach a player 
until he graduates from college, I 
won't really know where I stand 
until the major league draft. 
"As far as playing pro ball 

goes, I think my major drawback 
will be my speed. I'm a little 
slower than a shortstop should 
be, but I think that my hitting and 
fielding should be able to make 
up for this. At least I hope it will. I 
think I can play in the majors, but 
I just won't know a thing until 
after the draft. I might go fairly 
high, or I might not be drafted at 
all." 
The draft will be held in early 

June, and until then Krill's at­
tention will be given to the for­
tunes of the Irish ball club. 
"This is the best team that I've 
played for--both in spirit and in 

"Our team is a lot stronger than last year's team. We have lots of depth, besides youth. Five out of our six starters are returning next year. There's lots of experience, four of our five singles players also played last year. And Brandon Walsh, who's only a freshman, should help greatly." 
As far as evaluating his own capabilities and potential, Btown will be the first to point out his strengths and weaknesses. 
Unlike teamate Mike Rielly who possesses a blistering serve, Buster feels that that part of his game is his weak point. 
"Yeah, Iguess my serve is my weakest point. It's off and on, but mainly I concentrate on my volley and net game. Mainly because the volley is probably the biggest part of the match." 
Buster is also looking forward to the NCAA's which will be hosted by Notre Dame this June. He doesn't forsee any of the court, but he thinks they will leave with a good impression of th Irish team. 
As for himself, Brown felt his chances depended mainly on the 
material--during my four years here. I know that our 5-8 record must make something like that sound pretty funny, but we're a much better team than we've 
shown. 
We've been losing because of mistakes--mental mistakes--that college-educated guys shouldn't make. But it'll only be a matter

Syrian armies which have been holstered by massive weapons shipments from the Soviet Union. Bar Lev, however, said his men were confident of victory with the help of new American arms shipments if hostilities are renewed. 
Diplomatic sources in Israel said Prime Minister Golda Meir's reply to Egyptian President Anwar Sadat's proposals for reop(;ning the Suez Canal called for an Israeli troop withdrawal of about six miles, with no Egyptian or Sovietv troons t.o rross thP waterway and American guarantees against such a crossing. 
The Israeli newspapers said Wednesday the content of the government proposals for reopening the canal, blocked .;mce the 1967 war, under an agreement with Egypt hinged on Washington's reply to Israel's safeguare questions. Thzy said the United States had not yet replied to the request for such assurance submitted by Israel two weeks ago. 

SPRINGFIELD, ILL. (UPI)­The Illinois House Judiciary Committee yesterday recom­mended House passage of a bill, termed an experiment by sup­porters, which would abolish the death penalty in lllinois for six years.

The bill, sponsored by Rep. Robert Mann, D. Chicago, was approved in a 9-5 vote. 
The approval took courage, Mann said, because Illinois residents last Dec. 15 voted by an almost 2-1 margin to keep the death penalty in the referendum on the state's new constitution. 
"I'm amused by this elite group who feel they know better than the people," House Majority Leader Henry Hyde, R. Chicago, said in reaction to the committee vote. 
Rep. Leland Rayson, D. Tinley Park, said the committee was not "really ignoring the public's wishes."

The bill would ban the death 
penalty until July 1, 1977 but 
would not apply to persons 
sentenced before its enactment. 
Mann said he was attempting a 
six year moratorium because 
"I'm sure there is no chance of 
passing an outright ban." 
The measure might run into a 
rough time in the House, which 
has defeated bills to ban capital 
punishment in four out of the five 
last legislative sessions. 
In 1965 when such a bill did pass 
the House i~ was defeated in the 
Senate. 
Alumni contn.bute 
Alumni rl the University of 
Notre Dame contributed 
$2,120,249 to the 1970 Annual 
Fund, a figure only $45,000 short 
of the record $2,165,700 reported 
in 1966. More than 46 per cent of 
the alumni pirticipited in the 
rrogram. 

Ten honorary alumni con­tributed an additional $522,647 during 1970 to bring the Annual Fund total to $2,642,896. 
James D. Cooney, executive director of the Alumni Association, credited the ex­cellend response during 1970 to the increased faith and con­fidence of alumni in the goals of the University. "Our graduates realize that this is a time when Notre Dame needs their en­couragement, their moral and material support, and their allegiance as never before," he said. 
The Class of 1954, with more than 58 per cent forwarding cash gifts, led all classes in par­ticipation in the 1970 campaign. The Class of 1965, with 565 par­ticipants, had the greatest number of contributors, and the Class of 1955 contributed $344,909 to lead all classes in dollar amounts. 
SCLC to organize poor against Nixon 
DETROIT <UPil-The Soutnern Christian Leadership Conference SCLC will conduct a "massive voter registration drive in black and poor communities" to bring about the defeat of President Nixon in 1972, the Rev. Ralph D. Abernathy said Wednesday. 
Abernathy told a news con­ference that the SCLC board of directors "feels very firmly that an administration that ap­propriates billions of dollars for the moon and pennies for the poor is an administration that should be replaced in 1972." 
The SCLC held its spring board meeting in Detroit to "plan our future program and our future thrust," said Abernathy, the SCLC president. 
The SCLC will give top priority, he said, to battling "racism, war, and poverty in addition to that 
deremployment, the lack of 
administration of justice in the 
country, the lack of quality 
education in our public c;chools 
and an unjust welfare system." 
"The conference has also rededicated itself to its program of politics 1971-72 in which we will engage in a massive voter registration program and voter education programs in which we hope to bring about a whole change in the political arena," Abernathy said. 
Asked if there was internal dissension within the SCLC over tactics and leadership Abernathy said: "If there is any tension within the SCLC it was created by the media." 

He said he doesn't "want to agree with Vice President Agnew ~n anything, but he was right when he spoke out against the 
unemployment and un-'news media." 
Brooke calls for deadline on Viet troop withdrawal 
WASHINGTON (UPI)-Sen. Edward W. Brooks, R. Mass., Wednesday challenged President Nixon to set and publicly an­nounce a final date for with­drawal of all U.S. troops from Indochina, preferably by the end of this year. 

In his strongest statement on the Vietnam War, Brooks said "the time has come . .in fact the time has long past" for Nixon to set a pullout date as the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong have demanded to begin negotiations on the return of war prisoners. 
At the same time, Chairman J. William Fulbright, D. Ark., of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee announced that his panel would begin hearings Tuesday on six proposals relating to the war in Southeast Asia-­including the Vietnam disengagement act. 
Fulbright said Secretary of State William P. Rogers had been invited to testify April 27 but had made no reply. Defense Secretary Melvin R. Laird declined a committee invitation to testify May 4. 
Nixo11 has. refused-in the face of mounting congressional pressure--to announce a troop withdrawal target, contending that to do so would remove whatever incentive the Com­munists had to reach a peace settlement. 
In a senate speech, Brooke urged that Nixon accept a Dec. 31 pullout date favored by a number of lawmakers--or any other date the President prefers--and an­nounce it immediately.
