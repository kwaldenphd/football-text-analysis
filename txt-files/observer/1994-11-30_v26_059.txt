nate we are to have 
avoided its nastiness for 
as long as we have. 
Although sub-zero temperatures and streets of ice are things no one likes, I find it difficult to label winter as "awful." I have had many great times during the winter, and as far as the seasons go it is my favorite. 
When I was younger, winter meant sledding and snowball wars. The typical sledding hill was only two doors down, but a larger and far more wavy mountain existed only a couple of blocks from my house. When the first thick snows covered the ground, all the kids in the neighborhood would rush to these two hills. At first, it would be just "normal" sledding. This would give way to making a ramp and sending ourselves over it. The kids with less patience would start jumping and sledding down the ramp with other sledders. Soon the entire hill became a chaotic zone of sled­ders-each running over the other, leaving only the wrecked bodies behind. 
Smash-em-up derbies would develop, with "teams" of sledders. All the sledders would start at once, and as each team tried to pre­vent the other from reaching the bottom of the hill all memory of mom's warnings would soon be forgotten. Kicks were delivered to opponents sleds, sending the victims careen­ing towards certain death with a chain link fence, a tree, or the ramp. Other brave souls would jump from a tandem sled, and attempt to land on a opposing sled-a favorite tactic of mine. This would hopefully knock ofT all the enemy riders and control of the sled would belong to the jumper. However, this usually ended up turning the sled and its riders into a spinning mess of humanity and plastic as it rolled uncontrollably down the hill-taking out other sledders as they climbed back up for more. 
The carnage would continue with snowball wars. While sledding required much prepara­tion, vast snowball wars could erupt at any time. On several occasions small skirmishes with junior and high school students would develop into mass battles ranging over to the nearest street. The two sides would hide behind the snow banks created by the passing plows, and the street in between would become a no-mans land of ice chunks and for­gotten gloves and hats. 
Even today, I look forward to winter. The call for snow football begins during the Thanksgiving season, with us playing on the frozen turf. Here, the lake-effect snows cre­ate a veritable snow football paradise, with a good six inch to foot layer covering the ground. Seeing the snow flurries on Monday brought back memories of my friend J.B. making "the catch"-leaping three feet for the ball then landing on a snow bank for the touchdown. I have yet to see better else­where.

10 die in Indian election violence, vote may be delayed 
NEW DELHI 
Land mines believed planted by a militant Maoist group killed at least eight policemen and two civilians today in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh. The explosion was the sec­ond in four days in Andhra Pradesh, where the Peoples War Group apparently is trying to disrupt Monday's state elections. On Saturday, land mines killed killed 19 Indian commandos sent to the state to maintain order during the elections. 
· · Elections officials said they may have to postpone the vote if the violence continues. Andhra Pradesh is one of the four states electing state assemblies. The results are seen as a bell­wether for India's parliamentary elections in 1996. Today's explosion occurred during a police patrol in Urugonda, 930 miles south of New Delhi, the United News of India news agency said. In addition to eight policemen, two unidentified men were with police at the time. Twelve people were injured, including five policemen hospitalized with serious injuries, the agency said. The Peoples War group has been leading a peas­ants' rebellion in Andhra Pradesh for several years. Peasants make up the majority of the poor in the predominantly rural

Mexican employment in need of change 
By DEBORAH SCHULTZ 
News Writer 
There is a need for a change in employment structures in Mexico, according to Enrique Dussel Peters, a professor from the University of California, San Diego and La Universidad Au­tonoma e Mexico. 
"From the period of 1982 to 1987, the economic system had high social costs. The distribu­tion of income deteriorated, and· there were low investments, so at the end of 1987 the govern­ment began a complete liberal­ization," said Peters, summariz­ing the economic policies of Mexico from 1982 to 1994. 
He said that with this, the government became the center of social structure, reducing inflation through real wages and an increase of trade. 
However, instead of liberal­ization working as it was sup­posed to, it produced an overkill of emplovment.

"A shift from an export ori­ented industrialization to an import oriented industrializa­tion occurred, producing a wide trade deficit," said Peters. Be­cause of this, a fall in domestic inputs followed, forcing em­ployment to suffer. 
Mexico's problems with un­employment are severe because "they have no unemployment insurance to support the unem­ployed; therefore, without a job people do not survive." 
Due to a growth rate of popu­lation and a drop in mortality rates, the number of jobs is lower than the increase of eeoc nomic rates, Peters said. 
"In order for the gap between the economically active popula­tion and the number of gener­ated jobs to decrease, the growth rate of employment

needs to increase by 5 percent annually to be able to accom­modate this change" Peters. "Since the economy can not handle this change, 900,000 people per year find themselves without a job." 
Part of the reason that this 
deficit occurs is that out of 
Mexico's 73 economic branch­
es, only 3 have generated 
enough jobs for the 5% in­
crease. 
"After the liberalization change in 1987, manufacturing was the only branch to recover 
significantly. The branches that generated the most em­ployment had the lowest recov­ery rates," said Peters. 
According to Peters, "There is not a solution in the short run due to the challenge of the problem, but that an export ori­ented industry will increase employment."

Holy Cross Sisters remembered 
By BETH VAN TIEM News Writer 
The Sisters of the Holy Cross made a significant contribution to the nursing field during the Spanish American War, accord­ing to Barbara Wall, associate professor of nursing at Saint Mary's College. 
"Let everything be clean, clean, clean," is what Wall humorously referred to as the first mission statement of the Sisters of the Holy Cross. 
The Sisters, who arrived at Camp Hamilton in Lexington, Ky. on Sept. 4, 1898, overcame many hardships. Living condi­tions were rough, and they were surrounded by more than 600 sick men. 
Sister Valentine Reid, C.S.C., present at Camp Hamilton, talked not about the war with Cuba, but the "war with typhoid cases." Unsanitary con­ditions and poor water and milk supplies led to serious illness, according to Wall. 
The Sisters of the Holy Cross, who were primarily in the teaching field, worked without formal training, to save the lives of American soldiers. 
"The Sisters' vow of disci­pline, self sacrifice, and obedi­ence fit the model of a trained nurse," said Wall. 
In addition to creating an atmosphere of cleanliness, their duties included applying anti­septic, treating wounds, com­forting patients, and fulfilling dietary needs. They were in contact with the patient's fami­lies and provided spiritual care. 
Often they worked twelve hour days tending to the sick. 
"This (Camp Hamilton) is not a place to send one that does not know how to do all that is required of a trained nurse," said Reid: 
Under the administration of Sister Lydia Clifford C.S.C., the Sisters of the Holy Cross worked as nurses at Camp Conrad, in Columbia, Ga. 
Clifford was under the scruti­ny of Dr. Williams, who believed she should be in charge of a dormitory, at most. Like many other Sisters, she proved male doctors and trained nurses wrong. She was a competent leader, a remark­able accomplishment for a female of the time, according to Wall. 
Some Sisters were even sent 
to Cuba for a brief period. 
As the United States became 
a world power and society 
began to recognize women as 
equals, women nurses won the 
respect from many people in 
the medical field, including the 
surgeon general. 
Three of the eight nurse 
training schools established in 
the early 1900s were founded 
by the Sisters of the Holy Cross 
who aided in the Spanish 
American War. 
Letters and diaries of their 
experiences can be found in 
Saint Mary's archives today.

Wheels 
continued from page 1 
weekends with an average rid­ership of 10 per night, Dix and Dennis McCarthy of Flanner Hall presented a resolution to the council on November 22 about the program. 
Dix and McCarthy proposed that the program be given six weeks when school was in ses­sion to achieve an average nightly ridership of 50 students. 
If this goal could not be achieved, then Dix and Mc­Carthy would suggest that the program be terminated. 
"The resolution was a com­promise to people who still wanted to give it a chance," Dix said. 
But while the council was dis­cussing the resolution, the members gradually came to a decision that they should decide the fate of Weekend Wheels at that meeting, according to Rich Palermo, co-chairperson of the council. 
"We've worked on the pro­gram as much as we could," Palermo said, "but due to con­straints from the University and the low ridership, we felt that nothing more could be done." 

According to Palermo and Dix, the University's policy that students could not use the ser­vice to go to the bars hindered the number of riders. 
"(If HPC allowed students to use the service to get to the bars,) the University would think of it as an endorsement of drinking," Dix said. 
"I don't think the administra­tion has a serious commitment to stopping drunk driving if that's their attitude," Dix con­tinued. "Their policy was the main impediment." 
The money saved from ending Weekend Wheels may be used to fund a new program to com­bat drunk driving, Dix and Palermo said. 
"We're going to look into al­ternatives," Palermo said, "but nothing will happen until next semester." 
No alternatives have been of­ficially presented, Palermo said. 
The council set aside about $12,000 for the Weekend Wheels program this year, and just over $5,000 has been spent so far. 
A clause in the contract be­tween HPC and United Limo al­lows the council to cancel at any time, thus letting the coun­cil save the remaining $7,000.

tween the two campuses. 
Noha El-Ganzouri, student body president, addressed the issue of renovation of Haggar College Center. 
"Students want a social space that will be theirs, not taken over by faculty," she said. 
Earlier this year, BOG dis­tributed a survey and the majority of students responded that Haggar was not currently used as a social space. According to El-Ganzouri, 75 percent of the students ex­pressed their wish for cable TV to be installed in Haggar. 
Other BOG activities this semester have included the 
continuing efforts of WVFI to gain an FM frequency. 
"Now it seems that WVFI will take more than two years to go FM so we are thinking about fixing our AM transmitter," said El-Ganzouri. A student survey on this may be distributed later in the year. 
El-Ganzouri mentioned that a representative from the Notre Dame Relations Committee is sitting in on the planning of the Keenan Revue. 
In the future, BOG may also look into updating the student government constitution. 
Robin Walsh commented on SURV 's effort to get more peo­ple to be committed to regular service projects. "It is hard because we send out bulletins but we don't get much of a response."

Quayle placed in hospital 
By LISA SHAPIRO 
Associated Press 
INDIANAPOLIS 
Former Vice President Dan Quayle underwent treatment Tuesday for a dangerous bloodl clot in his lung just weeks be·· fore he was expected to an·· 
nounce whether he will run for president in 1996. 
"The doc­tors are very optimistic about Mr. 

Quayle's condition right now. He's doing extremely well and he is progressing very nicely," said Pam Perry, a spokes­woman for Indiana University Medical Center. · 
The 4 7 -year-old Quayle was expected to make a full recov­ery, the spokeswoman said. 
He was being treated with anti-coagulants to prevent fur­ther clotting while natural en­zymes in Quayle's body dissolve the lodged clot, said the physi­cian treating him, Dr. Homer Twigg. 
The clot was considered life threatening because it could have interfered with his breathing, Perry said. 
Twigg said at a news confer­ence that Quayle is otherwise in excellent health. 
Twigg said it isn't known what causes such clots, called pulmonary embolisms. They of­ten occur in people who are sedentary for long stretches, such as truck drivers, and can be hereditary, but Quayle had no such predisposition, the doe­tor said. 
Quayle has been promoting his book "Standing Firm" and appearing frequently on behalf of Republican candidates over the last year. 
"Long term he'll be fine and 
this shouldn't affect his political 
future at all," said Ann 
Hathaway, executive director of 
his political action committee. 
Quayle went to the emer­
gency room for a chest X-ray 
Sunday because he wasn't feel­
ing well and was diagnosed 
with walking pneumonia, 
Hathaway said. 
He was sent home with a pre­
scription but returned to the 
hospital Monday after 
complaining of shortness of 
breath, and doctors found that 
a blood clot had traveled to his 
lung, Perry said. 
Pulmonary embolisms start in 
the ealf of a leg and work their 
way up the body, through the 
heart and become lodged in the 
pulmonary vein of one of the 
lungs. 
If Quayle's health is fine oth­
erwise, chances are "he would 
never have another one," Bates 
said. 
Quayle was deemed in excel­
lent condition after in physieal 
in 1989.

Speaker 
continued from page 1 
Balli said she was troubled by the choice of a second speaker from the Bush admin­istration in recent years. President Bush spoke at 1992 commencement. 
Off Campus resident Ryan Hallfrod said he was indifferent to the choice. 
''I'd just as soon have (eccen­tric Guns-n-Roses lead singer) Axl Rose speak," he said. "I just want to hurry up and grad­uate." 

Carroll Hall's Michael Angaiak said the lack of name recognition or celebrity status in a speaker is not something he finds necessarily bad. "Just because I don't know her doesn't mean she's going to be a bad speaker," he said. Angaiak said he hopes to hear a good speech. 
University President Rev. Edward Malloy says that's just what graduating seniors will hear. 
Malloy praised Rice as and excellent speaker and leader in her field. "I think Condoleezza Rice is a perfect fit for this speech," he said. 
Elise Wolfgram Editor in Chief at the Standford Daily, Stanford's student newspaper agrees. 
"I would give her high marks," Wolfgram said. "I think she'll give a great speech." 
Pataki commends Giuliani 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK 

After three weeks of unre­turned phone calls, rebuffed invitations and huffy exchanges through third par­ties, they've finally made up. 
Gov.-elect George Pataki fi­nally accepted congratulations today from Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who crossed party lines to endorse Pataki's oppo­nent. 
"The campaign is over, the politics is over. It's now policy and working together," Pataki said as he and Giuliani stood together after their hour-long meeting. 
"We both feel exactly the same way," Giuliani said. 
It was the first time they had spoken since Giuliani stunned GOP leaders by endorsing Democratic Gov. Mario Cuoml() in October. 
Pataki declined to accept Giuliani's congratulatory tele­phone calls on election night, and Giuliani declined Pataki's suggestion to call back during business hours. Then Giuliani refused to attend Monday's get-acquainted meetin,g between Pataki and top city officials, mostly Democrats, because he wanted a private meeting.

• LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Wo01en's soccer thanks ND 
Dear Editor: 
I am writing on behalf of our women's soccer team. We would like to thank the many memb~rs of the Notre Dame community who have supported us during our run for the hna~ game. Although we did not return with the championship trophy, we do return w1th a great amount of appreciation for everyone's support. Without the help of those in the bleachers during our regional games, I do not believe we would have made it to Portland. 
A special thanks goes to our Athletic Department for going out of its way to help us reach our goals. The work the stadium crew put in to prepare our field for the ~egionals will be forever appreciated. Also, the efforts made by our athletic admin­Istrators and Father Beauchamp to be with us in Portland have not gone unnoticed. We could not have done it without any of you. 
The tremendous coverage this season by Rian Akey and the Observer staff has also made a lasting impression on our team. Many of these articles and pictures will fill our scrap books and give us fond memories. 
Personally I would like to thank the 23 young women who have made this all possible. The~e young .ladies epitomize the Notr~ Dame spirit. Not once during this long season did they give up regardless of the situation. They have lived, breathed, and sweat soccer over the last three months and have done it with smiles on their faces.. No ":here _is there a group of people with more pride in their University or class m their actiOns. I feel honored to have had the opportunity to work with this special group. 
As we turn our _focus to next year, we will not forget the many exciting moments that took place this year. We are happy that we could share those moments with so many of our friends.

Media, liberals incorporate new political slant on Christianity 
Dear Editor: 

The mainstream media's criticism of the Republican agenda has generally taken the form of various concerns about the results of implementing Republican programs deemed by liber­als to be uncaring, selfish, and mean­spirited. 
These judgments assigned to the mo­tives of conservative voters, and to the politicians that represent them, inten­tionally omit the fact that the real issue in this debate is not whether or not there is a need for compassionate, sacri­ficial care for the needy, but how such care can, and should be, provided. 
The irony of this new slant in the news is that Christian ethics are being in­cluded in this discussion, not by the con­servatives, but by the liberals. Although liberal ideology asserts that one of the greatest threats to freedom in our nation is the blurring of the separation of Church and State, we now should understand that the State is in fact where true Christianity finds its home! The media questions where the Christ­like compassion and sacrifice on behalf of the needy is in a "Contract with America" that proposes to cut welfare payments, give tax breaks to the well­to-do, and diminish the size of the vehi­cle (government) through which com­passion and caring are delivered. 
In this way, conservative ideology is being painted by the mainstream media as brazenly unchristian. It is as­tonishing, while we as individuals find our religious liberties being eroded, that the government takes the liberty to impose what it considers to be Christian principles upon society at large. I submit that the State is attempting to take on the traditional role of the Church and family in society. 
Liberalism dictates that government power, government policy, and govern­ment programs are the avenues by which care and compassion should be delivered to the needy, but conservatism asserts that the power of personal rela­tionships, individual choice, and com­munity programs are the avenues through which care and compassion are best administered. Newt Gingrich stated that this past election was about some big ideas. I wholeheartedly agree. 
At issue is how we the people should implement Christian ethics in our soci­ety. Do we want greater government involvement, or is it time to try a differ­ent mode of distribution of care to the needy?

Winter Wear Warms Up 

Fashion flows into praticality: as these models demonstrate, a selection of winter coats exists, including wool capes, leather jackets, and pea coats. 
Think soft and extra warm for this winter's apparel. If you are new to the South Bend 
area this year ------­it will not 
take you very long to figure out why. Before you know it, tem­peratures 


will be falling and you will Veronica Torres n0 t want t0 Accent Columnist 
be caught ill------­prepared. This season's styles offer some very cozy solutions. 
Everything on your wish list for the upcoming cold, winter months should spell out p-r-a­c-t-i-c-a-1-i-t-y. Although sweaters and coats are repeat performances of former styles, the popularity of the different materials being used is the stirring excitement in winter dressing. Angora, cashmere, mohair, and even silk are mak­ing their way onto everything from sweaters to coats to dresses to hats. 
Sweaters, this season, are falling to all lengths. Some are worn cropped above the belly button while others are taking dives below the hips. For the latter, narrow, turtleneck sweaters and shapely V-necks are the most flattering. Similar to the fall wear, the look remains defined for winter. 
If you have been taken in by the revival of mohair, remem­ber that while thin versions of the material are pleasing to the eye, thicker styles can add unwanted inches. One major bonus for mohair, however, is that compared to cashmere (another seasonal favorite) it is relatively inexpensive because of its abundance. Plan on see­ing it around for some time to come. 
For those who wish to wear 
lighter materials or for those 
who simply cannot suffer the 
allergies that some knits can 
cause, an alternative is the silk, 

CLOCKWISE FROM TOP LEFT: Nicole Cioper shows that uniquesness in a wool cape can be most fash­ionable. Amy Mcintyre portrays a warm combination of a fisherman's cap and pea coat.

ribbed sweater. Nevertheless, whatever you prefer color is key. Winter clothing should be festive and the best way to show spirit is by indulging in bright, bordering on fluores­cent, colors. 
There are many options this season when it comes to select­ing a winter coat. For long, or short, natural or synthetic

go out on a limb, invest in one. 

Sports is a sure influence for winter gear these days. More and more, avid skiers are find­ing their barest essentials for a day on the slopes right on the fashion runways. Comfortable nylon ski jackets filled with duck down are racing to the stores everywhere. Paired with spandex leggings and ear warmers they are perfect for the season. 
If none of the above appeal to you, leather, as always, is a basic favorite. Whether it is motorcycle inspired with silver buckles and buttons, or the sophisticated jacket that ties at the waist, you cannot go wrong with leather. 
The great thing about coats and sweaters this season is that they can go with anything 

.. 
including jeans, wool-tweed mini-skirts or even your favorite dress. The materials are so neutral that they are appropriate for any occasion, dressy or casual. Coinciding with this year's desire for women's dress to be more glamorous, the materials offered also help to define and flatter. 
To top the outfit off, would you believe that six inch, open­toe heels are still the rage for snowy, wet winter months? Well, believe it. And with no end in sight, I see it my duty to offer something for those who cannot fathom the idea of walking around in a pair of stilettoes. My solution: to-the­knee, leather riding boots or your most comfortable pair of hiking boots. Happy Holidays! 
Editor's Note: This is the sec­ond in a series of fashion columns by Veronica Torres. Torres is a Spanish and English Writing major at Saint Mary's College. She has jour­nalism experience with Time Magazine Inc. Magazines, NBC and various campus publica­tions. Torres is pursuing a career in fashion editing. 

fibers are all up for grabs. However, pea coats are making a big comeback. They are shorter than most traditional coats and usually look best worn for casual occasions. This time though, navy blue is not your only choice. Just look around, different colored coats with a variety of buttons are everywhere. 
If you are in the market for something dressier, double­breasted coats in cashmere or mohair provide elegance for a night on the town. Long or short lengths are equally charming. Also, wool capes this holiday season add a dra­matic touch but have not yet received the attention they should. So, if you are willing to

• COLLEGE BASKETBALL 

Florida flattens B.C. 
By HARRY ATKINS 
Associated Press 

AUBURN HILLS, Mich. 
Dametri Hill, suspended from Florida's first game for disciplinary rea­sons, scored 15 of his 19 points in the first half Tuesday night as the eighth­ranked Gators beat Boston College 91­65 in the opening game of the Great Eight Basketball Festival. 
Boston College (1-1). which shot 55 percent in its season-opener, shot only 33 percent against the bigger, stronger Gators. Andrew DeClercq added 18 points for Florida (2-0) before fouling out with 5:01 remaining. 
Hill, who shed almost 25 pounds to get down to 290 pounds during the offsea­son, took command almost from the opening tip, scoring the first five points 
r for the Gators. The Eagles, who learned shortly before the game that highly recruited freshman Chris Herren would miss the season with a wrist injury, were out of contention early. They turned the ball over 11 times in the first 20 minutes 
and shot just 29 percent in the half. Antonio Granger led the Eagles with 12 points. 
The Gators, who defeated BC 74-66 last March in the NCAA East Regional to advance to the Final Four, got eight points from Hill and six from DeClercq in a 20-7 burst that gave them a 29-17 lead with 7:53 left in the half. They led 43-25 at halftime. 
Florida finished off the Eagles with a 17-4 spurt to open the second half, tak­ing a 60-29 lead with 14:00 remaining. Brian Thompson had five of his 11 points in the run. 
Seven regional finalists from last sea­son's NCAA tournament and Connecticut, a replacement for national champion Arkansas, were scheduled to play doubleheaders Tuesday and Wednesday nights. 
The inaugural event, contracted to run at least three years, continued Tuesday night with No. 6 Duke facing No. 16 Connecticut in the nightcap. 
On Wednesday night, it will be Purdue against Missouri and No. 9 Arizona fac­ing No. 17 Michigan. 
Carolina, Wallace waltz 
By TOM FOREMAN Jr. 
Associated Press 

CHAPEL HILL, N.C. 
Hasheed Wallace scored a career-high 30 points as No. 2 North Carolina took its game inside to beat Pittsburgh 90-67 Tuesday night. 
Wallace had little trouble maneuvering around the basket, leading to the first 30-point game by a Tar Heel since Hubert Davis had 35 points against Duke on March 8, 1992. 
Wallace hit 14 of 19 shots, and eight of his baskel'> were dunks. 
lie also grabbed 11 rebounds for his second double-double in as many games. 
In fact, much of the North Carolina offense was produced on the inside. It wasn't until Jerry Stackhouse's jumper at 17:07 and Donald Williams 3-pointer with 16:28 remaining that the Tar Heels (2-0) got baskets from beyond the lane, and only a few perimeter shots followed after that. 
Pittsburgh managed to beat North Carolina's defense early in the first half and moved to a 14-7 lead on a 3-pointer by Jason Maile at the 11:42 mark. 
The Panthers might have given the Tar Heels trouble, but with 6-foot-9 center Jaime Peterson trying to defend the more athletic Wallace, North Carolina went to the middle to mount its first comeback. 
A 17-3 run in which Wallace scored 10 points lifted the Tar Heels to a 24-17 lead with 6:40 left in the half. 
North Carolina's ballhandling and shooting went cold, and the Panthers came back on three straight 3-pointers and a backdoor basket by Sortis Aggelou for a 30-26 lead at 3:16. That was Pittsburgh's last basket of the peri­od. 
North Carolina got the last 12 points of the period for its halftime edge. 
Connecticut surprises young Duke, 90-86 
ByJIM O'CONNELL 
Associated Press 
AUBURN IJILLS, Mich. 

Connecticut showed its experience early and late Tuesday night and it meant a 90-86 victory for the 16th­ranked fluskies over No. 6 Duke in the inaugural Great Eight. 
The Huskies, who lost AU-American Donyell Marshall from last season's team that was ranked second in the rmal poll of the year, used their trap­ping defense to frazzle a young Duke team early and had a 13-point lead late in the first half. 
The young Blue Devils. got back in it, though,· and.were within two points with less than five minutes to play senior center Cherokee Parks lost his temper and Duke lost him. 
''We gofthe leadearly and then slowed down," Connecticut coach Jim Calhoun said. ''We were able to get the afterburners going but still did some things down the stretch we usually don't do like those turnovers and miss­ing some free throws.''· 
Sophomore Ray Allen, the player slot­ted to replace Marshall, scored 26 points, while seniors Kevin Ollie and Donny Marshall had 24 and 17, respec­tively. 
Connecticut (2·0) led 79-70 before Duke closed to 88-86 with five seconds to play. Ollie made two free throws with 2.2 seconds left for the final mar­gin. 
"I was· worded the whole way but I was nervous, very, very nervous down the end,'' Calhoun said, 
The victory was the first for Connecticut in five meetings with Duke. 
Duke (2·1) has had to replace gradu­ates Grant Hill. an AU-American. and Tony Lang as well as junior guard Chris Collins, out at least two more weeks with a broken bone in his foot. That's meant more of a burden on Parks and the three freshmen who are expected to see a lot of playing time. 
"The experience of Connecticut 
showed at different points of the game," Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski said. ''The first eight minutes of the game it was very evident. A veteran team will take advantage of a lack of communication in the fullcourt. At times we looked like a very inexperi­enced basketball team." 
Parks finished with 24 points, nine coming on 3-pointers as he continued to show his ability to shoot from the outside, but it was his temper that did him in. 
Steve Wojciechowski hit a 3-pointer with 4:52 left to bring the Blue Devils within 70-68. That's when the calls started going against Duke. 
Kenny Blakeney was called for an intentional foul as he grabbed Allen on the way to the basket. 
Allen made both free throws and the Huskies were awarded possession of the ball. 
On that possession, Parks lost his cool. 
He went up to block a drive by Marshall and was called for a foul. Replays showed it appeared to be a clean block, and Parks jumped and down when he was called for the foul. He was assessed a technical foul by official Jerry Petro, his fifth personal of the game. 
Marshall and Allen each made one of two free throws and Connecticut had a 7.4-68 lead with 4:40 to play. 
"I went up and blocked the shot and he called the foul." Parks said, being very careful not to criticize the call. "I jumped up in the air and got the tech­nical. It was tight game." 
Krzyzewski didn't criticize the call, either, but he did complain about the ru1e that charges a player with a per­sonal foul for an unsportsmanlike tech­nical foul. 
"Forget about the call. The rule is basically not a good rule," he said. "It's just an unbelievable, amazing penalty on a team. I've said that before and you'll see it affect other teams dur­ing the season."

Mental illness has warning signs, too. 
Withdrawal from social activities. Excessive anger. These could be the first warning signs of a mental illness. Unfortunately. most of us don't recognize the signs. Which is tragic. Because mental illness can be treated. In fact, 2 out of 3 people who get help. get better.

Eagles set to fly to Hawaii for Aloha 
By HOWARD ULMAN 
Associated Press 

BOSTON 
The trumpet players won't make the trip. Some loyal alumni might be left behind. The Boston College football team will be making the expen­sive journey to Hawaii for a bowl game that wasn't its first choice. 
Boston College ( 6-4-1) accept­ed on Tuesday a berth in the Aloha Bowl on Christmas Day against 11th-ranked Kansas State (9-2). Losses in their last two games cost the Eagles a good shot at the Fiesta Bowl. And the Carquest Bowl chose West Virginia (7-4). 
The Aloha Bowl pays $750,000 to each school. The prestigious Fiesta Bowl in Tempe, Ariz., has a $3 million payday and the Carquest Bowl remaining at his Ohio State contract, and athletics director Andy Geiger could not be reached for comment. 
Neither returned telephone calls Tuesday night. Another message was left for sports information director Steve Snapp. 
Ohio State and Cooper have discussed a contract extension, but no agreement has been reached. Geiger told WTVN radio in Columbus Tuesday that he expected the talks to end soon. 
''I'm very hopeful we'll come to closure very soon," Geiger told the station. 
Ohio State went 9-3 during the regular season, capped by a 22-6 victory over Michigan. It was Cooper's only victory over Ohio State's arch-rival in eight years. Cooper is 54-25-4 at Ohio State. 
The Buckeyes will play Jan. 2 in the Florida Citrus Bowl against the loser of Saturday's Florida-Alabama game. 
in Miami has a $1 million jack­pot. 
"Our preference was a post­season game," Boston College athletic director Chet Gladchuk said Tuesday, putting a positive spin on the situation. 
"That's what we have shot for, and it's mission accom­plished." 
He said the school wouldn't lose money on the trip. It has to cut corners, though.

such a win. Ever since the end of last season, the momentum suurounding this program has been growing. 
First, the announcement that the Irish would join the Big East was a tremendous shot in the arm for MacLeod's club. More recently, the recruiting class that MacLeod has put to­gether for next season added more positive energy. 
But all that was for the future. This win is for the pre­sent. Not only does it build on the momentum, it gives the Irish reason to believe for this 
season.

MacLeod noted. "It is a build­ing block for this team. We have the opportunity to make our move." 
Even in the past, the big wins the Irish did earn came pretty well after the season has been defined. This game can serve 
as a different defmtion point. 
"We haven't started off year like this," senior tri-captian Billy Taylor said. "We've been working for this and can keep building with it." 
That notion of building is an important one. The Irish know that they still have a long way to go on the road back to re­spectability. 
"We're making a move," said MacLeod. "We're just starting, trying to climb back and gain respect and credibilty."

we're digging." 
They tossed aside one big shovelful Tuesday, finally fin­ishing one of their familiar upset bids, which always seemed to fall short in the past. 
This time, the roles were re­versed. 
It was Indiana that frred an air ball on a shot that could have won the game at the end of reg­ulation. And it was the Hoosiers without a buck to buy a free throw in overtime. Familiar foibles for Irish fans. 
Meanwhile, Notre Dame did its best Indiana impersonation, draining clutch shots from long 
AUDITIONS 
for 
distance and sealing the victory from the free throw line. The Irish also had just five turnovers in the fmal 25 minutes. 
Keith Kurowski and Ryan Hoover each scored 16 points. Freshman Pat Garrity had his second straight strong outing, scoring 14 points and providing a potent physical presence. And Matt Gotsch and Marcus Young each showed marked improve­ment with their play in the post. 
"This shows we've got a good group of youngsters who have been working their tails off," MacLeod said. "It was a good gut-check for this group." 
Notre Dame had that sinking feeling in its gut at halftime, down 11 points and just a Hoosier bucket or two from oblivion. 
But the Irish tied the game in less than five minutes. Billy Taylor hit two of his three 3­point shots to spark the spurt, and Justice scored five points, including a layup off a steal to knot the game at 50 with 15:34 remaining .

"I've always said that the most important five minutes of any game are the frrst five minutes of the second half," Indiana coach Bobby Knight said. "In that time Notre Dame took a game we had fairly well con­trolled and turned it back into a basketball game." 
Hoosier center Alan Henderson was handcuffed in the second half, scoring just eight of his game-high 23 points before fouling out with 3:46 left. And Taylor tightened the clamps on perimeter threat Brian Evans, who scored just 10 points on 3-for-11 shooting from the field. 
Notre Dame's offense opened-and the gap closed­thanks to the Hoosiers' woes.. 
"Fortuntely, Indiana began to miss and we were able to pop it out defensively and get some good looks," MacLeod said. "The game changed early in the sec­ond half and from that point on it was just a great college bas­
ketball game."

The Notre Dame women's basketball team is looking for­ward to today's game for more reasons than one. 
The home opener for the 1994-95 squad will be against 12th ranked Purdue. The team is eagerly awaiting tip off not just because its the first home game of the regular season, but also because of an established rivalry bewteen the two teams. Last year, the Irish were lead­ing the then third ranked Boilermakers at the half, only to have their shooting percent­age slip in the second, missing pulling off the upset by less than two buckets. 
Now with the home court advantage, Notre Dame's team looks to break the trend as Purdue has won all five of their previous meetings. 
Letitia Bowen, the NO captain and only senior, expects a fast paced and physical game. 
"One of Purdue's greatest strengths as a team is that they are all very athletic," Bowen said, "I think they'll try and run us pretty hard." 
Notre Dame will have an

Bohman, and Kelly Heath. Both Gaither and Bohman have scored double digits coming off the bench this season. 
Although the Irish are young this year, they will not be easily intimidated. 
"We're going to try to control the tempo, play our game, and be aggressive," Bowen said. 
Coach Muffet McGraw was been working on execution on offense as well as denial de­fense in preparation for tonight's big game. With con­tinued intensity and impressive talent, the Irish hope to send Purdue back to Lafeyette with a broken trend and little to less to look forward to. 

extra punch of determination tonight after a disappointing loss on the road Saturday to Seton Hall'(#25). Although enjoying a fourteen point lead earlier in the game, the team lost 60-65 in overtime. 
Despite the loss, the team had continued strong performances off the bench. Depth may become the Irish's secret weapon this season. 
Purdue's player to watch is Leslie Johnson, a beefy center who will endure the continuous onslaught of Notre Dame's inside game. The Irish post position is notably deep, con­sisting of co-captain Carey Poor, Katryna Gaither, Rosanne Wednesday, November 30, 1994

Inspired Irish squeak past Indiana in OT 
By JASON KELLY Associate Spons Editor 

Senior captains Lamarr Justice, Billy Taylor and Jason Williams were wrapped in an exul­tant midcourt embrace, sharing a sweet sense of satisfaction after their improbable 80-79 overtime victory over Indiana. 
Soon they were swarmed by their teammates and a mob of finally-fulfilled fans. All the pent up frustration from recent seasons exploded in an impromptu celebration. 
"We've had big wins before, but usually later in the season when we didn't really have any­thing to play for," Taylor said. "But this is some­thing we can keep building on. It can be a springboard for our season." 
llumbled three times already this season, the lloosiers could only hang their heads as they trudged past the party toward their locker room. 
The Irish. unblemished after the Indiana game for the first time in six seasons, danced a jig toward theirs. 
"This was a great win for our program," Notre Dame coach John MacLeod said. "We've been trying like heck to climb out of this hole, to gain respect and credibility. It's a long road, but

Victory a huge step in the right direction 
By TIM SHERMAN Assistant Sports Editor 
For the Notre Dame basketball team, playing games like this is nothing new. Winning them is another story. 
In years past, the Irish battled perenial pow­ers like North Carolina, Louisville, and Kentucky to the end, yet always found them­selves wondering what went wrong in the end. That was the old Notre Dame. 
Last night, their 80-79 thrilling win over the Indiana Hoosiers was something different. The new Notre Dame basketball. 
"That was a great game for our program," said a proud John MacLeod. "It was great to finally get a win of that magnitude." 
Not only was the actual victory crucial for the team, the way in which it was won was key. 
They showed they could win against a big name school, and win it down the stretch. 
"Two years ago, we lost to them in a heart­breaker," senior tri-captain Billy taylor remembered. "I was thinking about that as we came down the stretch." 
But this time the stretch was friendly for the Irish and they picked a very good time to get
