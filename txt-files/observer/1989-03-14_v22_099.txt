Stonebreaker will face charges for driving intoxicated 
Observer Staff Report 
Notre Dame football player Michael Stonebreaker has been charged with driving while in­toxicated, a Class A mis­demeanor, according to St. Joseph County Prosecutor Mi­chael Barnes. 
The charge carries a maxi­mum sentence of one year in jail, a $5,000 fine and loss of driving privileges for one year. 
The charges were filed March 6, but no court date has been set, Barnes' office re­ported. 
Additionally, Stonebreaker was charged with failure to wear a seatbelt. 
Stonebreaker and his pas­senger, Saint Mary's student Ursula Garzia, both juniors, were released from Memorial Hospital last week and both have returned to school. 
"We reviewed the evidence, had conversations with Ms. Garzia and her family, reviewed all the attendant evidence in the circumstances and this is the appropriate charge," Barnes said. 
The Notre Dame policy on driving while intoxicated states that students who are cited for off-campus DUI offen­ses will have their driving and parking privileges on campus revoked. Second offenders will be suspended for at least one semester. 
No one was available in the 
Office  of  Student  Affairs  to  
comment  on  disciplinary  ac­ 
tion  to  be  taken  against  

Stonebreaker. 

In an unrelated hit-and-run accident Feb. 26, Tony Brooks, a sophomore football player, was charged Mar. 2 with driving with a suspended license and leaving the scene of an accident. · 
Satterfield's cause of death determined, linked to heart defects 
By KELLEY TUTHILL Staff Reporter· 
Robert Satterfield, the Notre Dame football player who died on Jan. 19, 1989, died as a result of subtle congenital heart defects which were previously unknown. 
The heart defects caused a cardiac arrest followed by a seizure, according to a report by the Berrien County Medical Examiner, F.M. Busse, M.D. 
"In lay terms ... an abnor­mality in the system which reg­ulates the heartbeat" explains why Satterfield died, as stated in the report. 
Examinations also showed that Satterfield had diplomyelia, a double spinal cord, which is uncommon, and would not be expected in a good athlete. This did not cause his death, according to the report. 
Toxicology specimens were examined by two separate forensic labs and neither lab found evidence of drug or steroid use. Niles Township Chief of Police John Street said that an investigation of the scene failed to show any evidence of illicit drugs, accor­ding to the report. 
Satterfield, 22, collapsed from a seizure at O'Tay's

Tentative pact reached before start of Teamsters' racketeering trial 
Associated Press 

NEW YORK-Teamsters of­ficials reached a tentative labor-reform settlement with federal prosecutors Monday, hours before the start of a trial on a lawsuit to oust the union's allegedly mobster-dominated leadership. 
Prosecutors declined to dis­cuss details of the tentative pact, but a lawyer for the Teamsters said the union agreed to introduce constitu­tional amendments for election reform at its 1991 convention. Also three watchdogs, jointly chosen by the union and the government, will investigate and arbitrate alleged union corruption and oversee elec­tions. 
The settlement, reached during the night after round­the-clock weekend negotia­tions, was subject to approval by U.S. Attorney General Dick Thornburgh. 
The lawsuit sought to oust the union's top leadership as the culmination of the govern­ment's decades-long battle to force reform on the 1.6 million­member union. 
Using federal racketeering laws, the Justice Department also sought a court-appointed trustee or committee to over­see the nation's largest union and impose a series of reforms. It was the first time the gov­ernment tried to seize control of an entire union. 
However, in exchange for the agreement, none of the union's ruling executive board mem­bers will have to resign, and no court-appointed trustee or ad­ministrator will be put in charge of the union, said James Grady, the Teamster's general counsel. 
"The members are assured there is a mechanism in place to remove those persons al­leged to be conducting im­proper activities," said Grady. "The goals of a clean and'dem­ocratic union are consistent with the goals of the current leadership.'' 
The lawsuit, filed last June, claimed the Teamsters' leader­ship had been dominated by or­ganized crime, which "deprived union members of their rights through a pattern of racketeering" and a "cam­paign of fear" that included 20 murders, dozens of bombings, beatings, bribes, extortion and theft. 
Twenty-five of 26 reputed mob figures originally named as defendants have been con­victed of Teamsters-related crimes such as extortion through threats of union prob­lems, embezzlement of union funds and illegal labor payoffs. 
Most, however, were dis­missed from the case when they either agreed, or were or­dered, to drop any involvement with the Teamsters. Five, in­cluding convicted Colombo crime family boss Carmine "Junior" Persico, have been severed from the case and will be tried later. 
Teamsters President William McCarthy was amongthe 11 remaimng individual defendants in the case.

INSIDE COLUMN 



N D football players are 'painfully human' 
The recent brushes with the law involving Notre Dame football players just goes to prove the old adage: ''The bigger they are, the harder they fall." 
The news about Mike Stonebreaker, Tony Brooks and their inability to follow the basic rules of the road spread far beyond the Notre Dame campus. When I went home over spring break, everyone seemed to know about our star players and their lackluster performances off of the playing field. 
All of this negative attention prompted me to ask myself, what if the students involved in these accidents were non-athletes? If the stu­dents who broke the law were just "ordinary" Notre Dame undergrads, would the Chicago Tribune be prompted to run a headline like, "Brooks joins Stonebreaker on police blotter"? Probably not. 
What Stonebreaker and Brooks did was ir­responsible, but not unique. Unfortunately, there are a lot of people out there who have fled from the scene of an accident with a yellow stripe down their back that's brighter than the one on the pavement, and there are also a lot of people who feel that as long as they can crawl into the driver's seat, and find the knob to turn on the stereo, they are sober enough to drive. 
What makes these recent incidents so newsworthy is that football players were in­volved. At our school and in society in general, we have a tendency to put athletes up on a pedestal, and when they do something wrong, we are shocked to find out that these athletic "gods" are painfully human. The higher our expectations are about our athletes, the greater our disappointment is when they goof up. 
But why do these athletes goof up in such a big way? Perhaps our hero worship has some­thing to do with this disturbing trend. For ex­ample, if you are a football player and enough people keep telling you how extraordinary you

are and large numbers of goo-goo eyed females are chasing )rou down the quad, you may start to believe that you are better than your fellow students. 
In fact, not only could such attention give an athlete the idea that he's somehow superior, but he might also believe that he could get away with more than the average guy. If we keep telling our star athletes that they're super­human, they're going to start believing that they can sideswipe cars without getting caught and drive drunk without getting killed. 
Our football players' athletic talents are ad­mirable, but does that make them better than the students who excel in music, acting, writing, or are just all-around good people? It seems to me that "We are ND" is in actuality "Varsity athletes are ND," and I'm afraid that such an exclusive group fails to encompass the diversity of this campus. 
I think it would be unfair to say that all foot­ball players get egos the size of hot air balloons, but when it does happen, it's usually because they've been encouraged by an overzealous public. I'll be the first to admit that I cheer as loud as anybody else in the stands during a Notre Dame football game and I'm proud of what they accomplished last season, but I don't watch the players on the field with stars in my eyes. Maybe if we stop beholding our athletes with such lofty expectations, we won't be so disillusioned when they drop the ball, on or off the field.

"We didn't get any (more) of those spurious signals," Springer said. 
Mission control confirmed that data on the ground showed that the computer was func­tioning normally. 
An hour after the deploy­ment, TDRS's powerful first­stage rocket was to fire and send the craft toward a new, higher orbit. A second-stage rocket, set to fire at 10:23 p.m., will carry the satellite toward its work station 22,300 miles over the Atlantic Ocean. 
After TDRS floated off, mis­sion commander Michael Coats gently moved Discovery away to protect the shuttle seaside launch pad and raced out of view across a clear Florida sky in a launch that marked a successful beginning to NASA's plan to fly seven shuttles this year. 
Discovery, its rockets firing flawlessly, charged smoothly into orbit with five astronauts, the communications satellite and a cargo of experiments that includes four rats with clipped bones, and 32 chicken eggs. 
"It's a great start to a long launch season," launch direc­tor Bob Sieck told a news con­ference at the Kennedy Space Center. 
The 9:57a.m. EST liftoff was an hour and 50 minutes later than planned. Early-morning fog-so dense it obscured the launch pad from just a short distance away-caused some delay, but the major problem was winds five miles overhead. 

missioners have paid attention to academic, spiritual, social and cultural needs of the stu­dents," Hill said. 
The events board members have brought to the Saint Mary's campus include movies and singing groups. Hill said the members have also been re­sponsible for organizing intra­mural sporting events and class masses. 
"I am thankful for this year's devoted student activities and programming board commis­sioners," Hill said, "but (I'm) also excited for next year's members to build on what we've established." 
Although Monday night's meeting was its last, the pro­gramming board will still be busy selling T -shirts for St. Patrick's Day at Saint Mary's. The shirts cost $7 and are being sold this week in the basement of Haggar Center. 
Kim and Reggie Harris, a musical duo, have also been scheduled to perform in O'Laughlin Auditorium on March 29 at 8 p.m. Tickets are free of charge.

Rector Father George Rozum. 
"He's a very caring and 
generous, pastoral person." 
"Notre Dame gives a won­

Leveille prepares about 50

The hard part of his job, however, comes as counselor and consoler. Leveille often is the first University official to meet students and parents when death or serious illness strikes. 
"I think the thing that makes me most credible as a priest is not the theory or the theology,'' he said. "When you speak from your own life experience, you become more credible as a priest." 
Senate plans 'Christmas in April'' project 
BY NATASHA WILSON Senior Staff Reporter 
The student senate discussed plans for its promotion of the upcoming service project Christmas in April at a brief meeting Monday night. 
To recruit volunteers for the April 8 project, senate repre­sentatives will hold student sign-ups Tuesday and Wednes­day nights in the dining halls. 
Christmas in April is a one day service project in which volunteers will renovate houses of needy and elderly South Bend residents on the northwest side of the city. 
Student Body President Tom Doyle stressed the importance of large student participation in the event. 
The senate also presented the scheduled campus events for St. Patrick's Day. The celebra­tion will run from Wednesday through Sunday and will in­clude bowling, a 4K run, the Irish king and queen contest, a block party, movies and a glee club concert. 
Doyle also announced that he and other senate members will meet with the South Bend mayor, police chief and city at­torney and Notre Dame admi­nistrators this Wedne..;day to discuss off-campus crime. 
The senate, Doyle said, is planning a program with the Intellecutual Life Council on racism in response to a recent report on race relations written by an American Catholic bis­hop. 
As a part of the Year of Cul­tural Diversity, Saint Mary's College will also host a reading by Pulitzer Prize winning writer Gwendolyn Brooks on March 22, said Katherine Kol­ler, Saint Mary's representa­tive. Brooks, Illinois' poet laureate, will read from her works 7:30 next Wednesday in O'Laughlin Auditorium at Saint Mary's.

Bush holds talks with Israeli foreign minister 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON-The Bush administration asked Israel on Monday to ease its grip on the occupied West Bank and Gaza while U.S. policy-makers ponder ways to promote Mideast peace talks. 
Secretary of State James Baker broached the proposal in a meeting with Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Arens. 
"We certainly want to reduce tension," Arens told reporters after meeting with Baker. But, Arens added, "It's not easy to do that considering the vio­lence in the area at the present time." 
However, the visiting Israeli official also commented, "I think we will find common ground on how to do this." 
Arens then met with Presi­dent Bush at the White House for a half-hour and also with Vice President Dan Quayle. 
"We didn't arrive at any finalized or defined positions," Arens said afterward. "I think it is probably premature to ex­pect that at this point." 
Baker described the actions he urged on Arens as "various reinforcing and reciprocal steps which might be taken to defuse the tension there." He was not specific. But even before Arens arrived, pub­lished reports said they in­cluded release of Palestinian prisoners and a general easing of Israeli control. 
Next week, Robert Pel­letreau, the U.S. ambassador to Tunisia, is expected to ask the Palestine Liberation Or­ganization to block guerrillas

The parallel appeals to Israel and the PLO seem designed to bring the two sides together eventually. The Israeli govern­ment refuses to deal with an organization it accuses of con­tinuing terrorism, while a PLO aide said Sunday in New York the U.S. approach was un­balanced and outdated. 
Nabil Shaath, who was granted a visa by the adminis­tration to attend a conference at Columbia University, said "We are the only occupied people in the world who are being asked to refrain from any expression against the occupa­tion. That's ridiculous." 
Baker said he had ''a produc­tive exchange of views" with Arens at the State Department. Returning the kind words, Arens said their talk "contributed to building a basis of understanding between us.'' 
At the same time, Baker stressed any settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict must "address the legitimate politi­cal rights of the Palestinian people." 
Baker reaffirmed the U.S. commitment to Israel's secur­ity and said, "We can and must find a way to move ahead" toward an overall settlement. 
Despite pressures from Arab and West European govern­ments, the Bush administra­tion is moving slowly in formu­lating a plan for Mideast peace talks. 
''It's just basically common sense that before you do anyth­ing that you could consider an initiative, you've got to change the conditions and lower the level of violence and confronta­tion," a U.S. official, speaking on grounds of anonymity, said Sunday. 
Bush has said he would not be rushed by a Soviet diplomatic initiative in the Middle East into offering wide­ranging new peace initiatives in his talks with Middle East leaders. Arens will be followed here by Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, King Hussein of Jordan and President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt. 
Bush has kept open the U.S. dialogue with the PLO that began last December despite a series of attacks by PLO guer­rillas on Israeli security posi­tions across the border in southern Lebanon. 


Authorities seeking cause of USAF helicopter crash which killed 15 
Associated Press 
TUCSON, Ariz.-Crew mem­bers on a military helicopter that crashed and burned in the desert were wearing night­vision goggles, but that was not a factor in the accident that killed 15 servicemen, Air Force officials said Monday. 
Use of the light-amplifying goggles has been questioned in a number of previous military crashes. 
Four Air Force Reserve crewmen and 11 Army Special Forces soldiers from Fort Bragg, N.C., were aboard the CH-3E "Jolly Green Giant" helicopter that went down Sun­day night in the desert 25 miles northwest of Davis-Monthan Air Force Base. 
Capt. Carlos Roque, a spokesman at Davis-Monthan, said he had no information on the sequence of events leading to the crash and didn't know if there had been any radio trans­missions. 
Sgt. Jill Archer quoted Air­man 1st Class John Klemack, a spokesman for the 71st Special Operations Squadron at Davis­Monthan, the crew's unit, as saying, "We don't know what height they were flying at when the crash occurred." 
The Vietnam-era helicopter, assigned to Davis-Monthan, was ferrying the soldiers from Fort Huachuca, 79 miles sout­heast of Tucson, to an Air Force gunnery range at Gila Bend, 124 miles northwest of Tucson. 
It went down in an uni­nhabited area adjacent to the Saguaro National Monument about 20 miles northwest of Tucson, after stopping at Davis-Monthan to refuel, Roque said. 
"I looked up and I seen a yel­low ball, like flames, coming out of the back," said Mike Skrekas, who lives a few miles from the crash site. "Five seconds later I saw it hit the ground, and then there was a red fireball." 
A second helicopter was ac­companying it but was a reasonable distance away and was not involved in the crash, Roque said. 
Air Force Lt. Col. Darrel Hayes said the helicopter that crashed had undergone a man­datory inspection just last Friday that resulted in replace­ment of its main rotor head shaft nut. It was flown safely

three times after that work. 
Roque said the flight crew was wearing night-vision goggles that amplify low light but that investigators had de­termined that the goggles "were not a factor in the acci­dent." 
Roque said previous helicop­ter crashes in which pilots were wearing such goggles "were flying low-level or in close proximity" with other aircraft and that the goggles, "when used in close proximity or low level, may have caused a vision problem." 
He said the flight from Tuc­son to Gila Bend was to be "a regular, straight, level flight." That is, "it didn't involve any capabilities other than flying in a straight line," as opposed to low-level "nap of the earth" flying, following the contour of the land, he explained. 
"They were not doing that on this flight," said Roque, "and as a result when they were using the night-vision goggles they were in open air space and not in proximity to anything." 
Identities of the victims were not immediately released. Roque said the bodies would have to be identified through medical and dental records.

Eastern Airlines could offer cut-rate strategy to strikers 
Associated Press 

MIAMI-Eastern Airlines im­posed a cut-rate pay package on Machinists workers Monday that gives them far less than the wages that prompted a 9­day-old strike, and makes the airline the lowest paying of all major carriers. 
"I think it's obvious they don't want anybody to come back to work," Wally Haber, a general chairman for the Mac­hinists union, said of the new pay scale, which applies to union workers who cross picket lines as well as new hires. 
But Eastern continued to dis­play its resolve to fly, renewing more routes as part of a gradual rebuilding that centers on Latin American service and 
cheap  Northeast  shuttle  
flights.  
Some  Wall  Street  analysts  

said Eastern appears likely to expand its off-price fare strat­egy, which was so successful last weekend that hundreds of people were stranded in air­ports when they couldn't get aboard packed Eastern shuttle flights. 
At Miami International Air­port, people lined up Monday to buy tickets instead of demand refunds, and the com­pany reported steadily increas­ing sales. The company has recalled about 100 employees, mostly reservations agents, who were laid off one week ago when Eastern cut back to 1,500 employees. 

Eastern, which on March 9 filed for federal bankruptcy re­organization, operated 75 flights Sunday and aimed for 85 Monday. 
The company resumed jet­liner service between Miami and New York, Montreal and San Juan, Puerto Rico. Eastern also has renewed service on 13 Latin American routes since the strike began March 4. 
Eastern had planned to resume jetliner service be­tween Boston and Washington on Monday but delayed that un­til Thursday. Company spokes­
man  Robin  Matell  said  the  
company  had  "to  call  an  
audible."  

The Air Line Pilots Associa­tion, meeting in Washington in national executive session to discuss strike benefits for Eas­tern members, ridiculed the company's credibility and its service plans. 
"We believe they will be sig­nificantly hampered in ever reaching these stated goals be­cause they don't have the pilots," Eastern pilots spokes­man Ron Cole said in Miami. 
The pilots union estimated that by Sunday, Eastern was flying only 3.5 percent of its pre-strike schedule of 1,040 daily flights. 
The pilots union also charged Eastern "betrayed its trust to the flying public" by leaving about 550 passengers at air­ports in Boston, New York and Washington over the weekend. Cole said the shuttle service previously has had backup flights available to guarantee a seat to every customer. 
Eastern spokesman James Ashlock said all those left in the airports overnight were moved out Monday morning. 
Eastern flew about 30,000 people during three days of $12 bargain fares, which Monday went up to $49, still less than half the normal $99 weekday fare.

EPA has proposed sanctions for Lake, Porter counties in Indiana 
Associated Press 
INDIANAPOLIS-The state's inability to enforce a vehicle in­spection and maintenance pro­gram in Lake and Porter counties has prompted the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to propose sanctions against Indiana, the agency an­nounced Monday. 
The proposed sanctions would include cutting the state's federal highway fun­ding and restricting grants for certain sewage treatment 
The EPA also would extend a construction moratorium im­posed on Lake and Porter counties last September. 
The EPA has complained that not enough motorists are complying with the state's ve­hicle testing program, which involves only motorists in four counties, including Lake and Porter near Chicago and Floyd

The EPA has scheduled an April 13 public hearing on the proposed sanctions. The hearing will begin at 10:30 a.m. in the County Commissioner's Courtroom in Crown Point.

No sanctions have been pro­posed against Floyd and Clark counties because county offi­cials have implemented an in­terim enforcement program, pending action by the state, the EPA said. 
The agency said, however, that if the Indiana General As­sembly does not enact ade­quate legislation, sanctions will be taken against the south­ern Indiana counties, as well. 
Under the current program, the registration of noncomply­ing vehicles is suspended. But the EPA, citing a 68 percent compliance rate, maintains the Indiana program is not· effec­tive.

CIA: An institution of terrorism 
-
On March 15, one of Notre Dame's most controversial alumni returns to this campus. Alternately vilified and praised, Philip Agee stands out in the annals of the University's history as a figure consistently willing to stand up to defend his beliefs and in doing so, to defy one of the most powerful and sinister organizations of the modern world. 
Karl Kronenberger Catherine Francis 
guest column 
Agee graduated in 1956 from Notre Dame as a member of the first class to graduate under the University's brand new president, Theodore Hesburgh. Secretly recruited during his senior year, he entered the CIA in 1957. 
In his twelve years as CIA officer working in Ecuador, Paraguay, and Mexico, Agee not only witnessed, but participated in the recruitment of spies, surveillance methods involving phone tapping and room bugging, mail tam­pering, the dissemination of propaganda, the interference in elec­tions of countries with long histories of democracy, torture, and the provoca­tion of military coups. 
By 1968, Agee had grown increasingly disillusioned and outraged by the CIA and its dealings around the world. Reflecting on the CIA as an institution, he saw how it systematically subverted true democracy and human rights by fomenting reactionary movements leading to the establishment of right­wing authoritarian regimes. These realizations prompted Agee to consider what no CIA officer had previously dared, putting his experiences into print. He began to work on a manu­script which would expose how the CIA had consistently worked against the ideals it professed to protect. His aim, in his own words, was "to limit the CIA's ability to undermine democratic institutions and to promote political repression such as torture and murder by death squads." 
When the CIA discovered that Agee had started researching his book, began to worry that intricate covert operations that had taken years to es­tablish would be placed in jeopardy. In­telligence officers contacted Agee's friends and acquaintances, including Father Hesburgh, in order to persuade them to talk Agee out of writing the book. 
Despite these efforts, Agee published the book in 1974; first in England to avoid American censorship laws, but then in the United States. The book, In­side the Company: CIA Diary, has been described as the most damaging book ever to CIA operations. Public opinion regarding the book was varied but in­tense. Many in this country and partic­ularly on this campus were outraged that Agee cited names--a 22 page ap­pendix blew the covers of over 250 un­dercover CIA agents and front organi­zations. 
Agee was in Europe when Inside the Company was first publised, unable to return to this country for fear of a long and costly trial. Pressure from Henry Kissinger resulted in his expulsion from five NATO countries, even though Agee was never charged with any crime, nor, despite popular believe, was any CIA officer or agent ever the object of at­tack of violence as a direct result of Agee's book. President Carter's Secre­tary of State Cyrus Vance revoked Agee's passport in 1979, accusing him of having "caused serious damage to the national security and foreign policy of the United States." Congress subse­quently passed the Anti-Agee Law, prohibiting CIA employees from leaving the agency and then exposing undercover agents by name. 

In 1987, against the advice of his lawyers, Agee ventured across the Niagara Falls bridge, returning to the United States for the first time in 15 years. Since then, he has been able to leave and reenter the country several times, speaking as an international au­thority on the CIA. 
It is in this capacity that he return to his alma mater, an organization which has not treated him well. Agee was an active and well-liked student at Notre Dame. He was in ROTC, involved in student government, and graduated cum laude in philosophy. Page 22 of the 1956 Dome shows Agee, as a member of the academic "Blue Circle," present­ing the Patriot of the Year award to General Curtis LeMay. 
When Inside the Company came out in 1974, there were many negative reac­tions within the Notre Dame commu­nity and alumni. According to John Manion, secretary of the Class of 1956, "for some 15 years, any mention of Phil Agee's name was prohibited in Notre Dame Magazine and its preceding jour­nal. His name was repeatedly cut from the '56 Class Column." Some held the sentiment that Agee was a traitor and an embarrassment to the University. At their 30th reunion the class of 1956 joined to pray together for two of their classmates: Agee and another mem­ber, at the time in Federal prison. 
We vehemently disagreed with the opinions and believe that Philip Agee should be numbered among the most honored of our Alumni. Agee was com­pelled under the Nuremberg Principles to expose the CIA for what it really is: an instrument of international covert terrorism. The CIA has worked directly against the ideals of true democracy in its subversion of the democratically elected governments of Iran (1953), Guatemala (1954), Chile (1973), and many others. The CIA consistently ig­nores domestic and international laws in its involvement in media disinforma­tion, actions to deceive Congress, drug trafficking, assassinations and acts of war such as the mining of Nicaraguan harbors in 1983. 
The CIA justifies its actions by declaring them to be in the interest of national security. In reality, these ac­tions reflect the interests of a very small sector of American society and multinational corporation by installing right-wing dictatorships in countries to keep them part of the "free world," or, in other words, the free market. The interests towards which the CIA works are not concepts such as national sovereignty, self-determination, the 
U.S. Constitution or Democracy but rather the preservation of multi-billion dollar markets and exploitation of Third World peoples and resources. 
The CIA continues to recruit on this campus with the University's blessing while Notre Dame fails to provide any education for its family on CIA atrocities. The hypocricy, deceit and corruption manifested by the CIA's ac­tions are an insult to the values of social justice and Christianity which we in the Notre Dame-Saint Mary's community espouse. We encourage all in this com­munity to attend Philip Agee's lecture on March 15, at 8 p.m. in Washington Hall. More importantly, we urge them to seriously consider the implications of the CIA's continuing presence here on our campus.

Agee not the martyr he claims to be 

Philip Agee, former Central Intelli­gence Agency officer turned virulent anti-CIA critic, is coming to Notre Dame. Many of us would have taken little notice of this event, but another publication here on campus has done its best to beat the publicity drums heralding Agee's return. Agee himself wrote an article for Common Sense; they returned the favor by printing an extremely favorable "profile" of Mr. Agee. They are a little defensive, 

Kevin Smant 
on politics 
though toward the end, the profile states that "Philip Agee has never been accused of any crime. No CIA officer or agent has ever been the object of attack or physical violence as a result of Agee's exposures. His purpose ... is to limit the CIA's ability to undermine democratic institutions and promote the political repression such as torture and murder by "death squads." 
Agee paints himself as somewhat of a martyr, as one who was horrified by the CIA's supposed role in continuing the "exploitation, injustice, repression, and imperial control" in Latin America. He wrote about this despite "intimidation and threats." He was 
merely exposing the Agency's actions 
as an independent citizen, in the name 
of humanity and justice--or so he im­
plies. In order to evaluate Agee's 
sweeping charges, however, we need to 
look at Agee himself. Have he and his 
friends told us the whole truth? Does it 
matter? 
Only you can decide the latter. But all the facts should be known--and there is much that Agee and his followers do not tell us. First of all, Agee's implica­tion that he is some kind of independent watchdog is false. In fact he left the Agency in 1968 not only because of ideological disillusionment--but be­cause he was in debt. He spent time immediately after this not only being "radicalized" by studying at a Mexican university, but also living in Cuba. In fact, historian John Ranelagh writes that Agee's first book, Inside the Com­pany, was published with the monetary help of the Cuban government. It is also 
-logical to assume that Cuba helped him repay his debts. In return Agee passed all secrets he knew to Cuban intelli­gence. 
Agee is widely believed to have kept his contacts with the Cubans in succeeding years. He also worked with Soviet intelligence. Hard to believe? Not if you read an article he wrote in the June 1975 issue of Esquire maga­zine. There Agee expresses admiration for the Soviet KGB. Oh, they are repres­sive at home, but they back the right "people's" movements abroad. Ap­parently Agee's "ends don't justify the means" philosophy only goes so far. 

Agee's notoriety, however, stems mainly from his public exposure of deep-cover agents and covert opera­tions. He and his friends claim that no agent has come to harm because of these exposures. This, too, is false. In November 1975 Agee published an ar­ticle in a European radical newsletter called CounterSpy. In it he revealed the name and home address of Richard Welch, CIA station chief in Athens, Greece. He went on to urge the local populace to "bring pressure on their so-often compromised governments to expel the CIA people." What if the gov­ernments refused? Then, said Agee, "the people themselves will have to decide what they must do to rid them­selves of CIA." 
Agee's exposure was printed in the general circulation newspaper Athens News; a few weeks later, on Dec. 23, 1975, Richard Welch was shot and killed by terrorists on his front doorstep. It is difficult to see how Agee can escape some measure of responsibility for this 
killing. True, rival intelligence 
agencies already knew Welch's loca­
tion; but the general public, and local 
terrorist groups, did not--until Agee told 
them. 
In short, Philip Agee is a fraud. He claims to be a lone prophet, preaching in the wilderness against the mighty CIA, while in actuality one of his books was bankrolled by Castro's Cuba. He claims to stand against oppression, while he tells the Soviet Union what he knows and speaks kindly of the KGB. He claims to be a humanitarian and a democrat, while he recklessly exposes agents to capture and death, and so un­dermines the U.S. foreign policy accor­ding to his own whims. 
I an not urging a boycott of Mr. Agee's talk, nor am I suggesting heck­ling or other kinds of harassment. I'll leave those tactics to liberals and leftists--they're much better at them. I am saying that what Agee says must be put in a wider context and under harsh scrutiny. Indeed, perhaps we shouldn't believe anything or every­thing our government tells us. But, based on the evidence, we surely must not accept everything Agee tells us.

Speaking on campus in February, after returning from a visit to South Africa, Associate Provost Oliver Wil­liams called, again, for continued in­vestment in American corporations that support the Sullivan Principles. According to The Observer's report (Feb. 24, 1989), Williams argued that the "withdrawal of foreign investment is not the best way to change the exist­ing racial hierarchy." However, he seems not to have made it clear that Father Leon Sullivan himself aban­doned the Principles in June 1987. They had failed, Sullivan delcared, to have any impact in undermining apartheid. I should point out that American cor­porations have been heavily invested in South Africa since the early sixties, and that repression of black South Africans has increased significantly, not declined, since then. These corpo­rations had three decades to undermine apartheid, yet failed to do so. In fact, their capital, technology and taxes ac­tually bolstered apartheid. 
At first sight, it is odd to find Williams pursuing a discredited policy. However, when one looks more closely it makes sense. After Father Sullivan discarded his Principles, an "Industry Support Unit" was set up to undertake damage control and manage public re­lations on behalf of corporations deter­mined to remain in South Africa. Mobil, Caltex, and Control Data, inter alia, were represented on the unit. It was this Industry Support Unit that initiated a three-man "National Advisory Coun­cil" to support continued investment and to maintain the fiction that corpo­rations could help to dismantle apar­theid in this way. 
William's visit to South Africa was not as an independent observer; he went there in his capacity as servant of corporate interests. This meshes with his role as a director of the Coal­ition on South Africa (COSA) which is headed by Bishop Richard Risher of the American Methodist Episcopal Zion Church. COSA claims, fraudulently, to represent seven million black U.S. Christians; it lobbies vigorously in Washington against South African sanctions. The evidence from the Interfaith Center for Corporate Re­sponsibility suggests that COSA was launched with the assistance of Pagan International--the public relations firm hired by Shell to thwart the anti­apartheid boycott of its products. 
Father Williams has become the ideal front-man for those American cor­porations determined to remain in South Africa. And, because of his posi­tion as an associate provost for the Uni­versity, he inevitably drags Notre Dame into deliberate opposition to the urgent pleas for tough economic sanc­tions against the apartheid regime coming from the liberation movement and key church groups. These organi­zations include: the African National Congress, the United Democratic Front, the Congress of South African Trade Unions, the South African Coun­cil of Churches, the U.S. Catholic Bis­hops' Conference and the U.S. National Council of Churches. 
I would also remind readers that Fa­ther Oliver Williams continues to dis­sent from the decision made by his own community. Holy Cross Priests of the Indiana Province voted to divest early last year; Holy Cross Sisters had decided even earlier that investment in South Africa was not consistent with a witness to the Gospel.

Spirit and joy of 
JPW acclaimed 
Dear Editor: 
A week has passed since we left Notre Dame and Junior Parents' Weekend. Though we are now at home and at work physically, our minds and hearts remain at Notre Dame. Mere words are inadequate to express how much we en­joyed our time spent there. 
Just as it is difficult to explain the mystique of Notre Dame, so it is hard to describe exactly what it is that made this weekend with our daughter so spe­cial. Certainly, it was the time spent with our daughter Keli and meeting her friends and their parents. Surely, it was attending all the carefully planned events. Most definitely, it was experi­encing the spirit that is Notre Dame. 
Thank you to all who had to do with bringing about this wonderful weekend, and to our daughter, without whom we could not have been a part of it.

Professor responds to accusations 
Dear Editor: 
It is amazing to me that Father Robert Griffin--in the course of his per­sonal attack on my character and reputation (The Observer, Mar. 2)-­claims that he and I were once "close." What a curious adjective to use since­-aside from one disastrous wedding--I have never visited with him, been in his room, heard him preach, had a meal with him or been to one of his masses. As a matter of fact, I don't believe I have even seem him ten times in twenty years; that's how "close" we have been. 
Now to the substance of his charges-­if they can be sorted out from the false compliments, backpedaling, and in­nuendos that surround them. 
1) Father Griffin accuses me of being an evil old man who, knowingly, does more harm than good to young in­nocents on our campus. 
2) He also accuses me of deliberately and dishonestly setting forth argu­ments in defense of gay people that even "hard-shelled gays" have aban­doned. He doesn't say which ones. 

A more accurate assessment of my situation is, I believe, the following: 
1) I am proud to be a public and old member of GLNMMC and to work, ac­cording to my limited capacities--by word and example--to encourage gay students to live integrated, happy, and successful lives on this, admittedly, un­welcoming campus. I do this almost ex­clusively at public meetings, lectures and rap groups where I express my opinions, share my insights and offer encouragement to the faint-hearted. 
2) My statements about homosexuality and in defense of gay people are my own and are set out with as much candor and honesty as I can muster. I do not pretend to speak for other gay people and frequently find myself in disagreement with many of them on a variety of matters. 
3) In keeping with our academic character, I believe in promoting open, rational discussion of gay issues at Notre Dame and Saint Mary's. From long personal experience I know how rampant homophobia is here and just how much damage this emotional dis­order does to students and their families. As persons and as an institu­tion we can do more to alleviate this sad condition of painful misunderstand­ing. 
4) I also believe in an emerging Notre Dame and Saint Mary's in which wo­men and men of every sexual persua­sion will live together amicably. None of us are all that terribly good at friendship, love and fidelity that we can afford to scorn each other or despise each other's gifts. 
Finally, I wonder why Father Griffin, after repeated attempts on my part to contact him, prefers to attack me in print rather than meet with me in private. Is he perhaps afraid that I will not turn out to be the ogre he has manufactured?

Discriminatory ban causes pain 
Dear Editor: 

While recently counseling a senior woman about law schools, we got to talking about discrimination. She brought up how hurt she was that mem­bers of her sex could not be ordained. She went on further to say how painful it was to think that no one at Notre Dame, except for a couple of women faculty, was concerned about this in­justice. 
To my recollection, Notre Dame has always gone to bat for its graduates when there was a discriminatory ban. I couldn't defend Notre Dame's reticence in this matter. It certainly is questionable that nearly forty percent of our graudates at this spring com­mencement can't hold an office in an organization we are affiliated with, and we do not formally say a word .

JPW does reveal a change in students 
Dear Editor: 
Junior Parents' Weekend. February at Notre Dame. We were here with our son at this special time in 1989 with still­vivid memories of our August 1986 par­ting after Freshman Orientation weekend. Our then 18-year-old had stood silhouetted against the dormitory building, alone and uncertain, watching and waving continuously at our car's retreating ·back. 
And now we were again at Notre Dame where the "phone" voices of roommates were attached to faces, the friendliness of parents was as expected and, unlike conditions at our August departure, the February snow beauti­fully blanketed buildings and walkways, casting its bittersweet aura over our anticipated leavetaking. The grotto still had the power to calm and inspire. We felt serene in our belief that nothing had changed. 
But as the weekend progressed and we participated in the Friday evening gala with its live music and con­viviality, in the Saturday mass with its Gospel message which proclaimed, "This is my Son, my Chosen One. Listen to Him," in the elegant Saturday eve­ning "Broadway Revue" presidential dinner, and in the emotional Sunday morning closing brunch, we listened to many messages. One portion of the Fa­ther Edward Malloy's address, however, returned to our minds again and again; he reminded us parents that we had left our children in the Univer­sity's care in 1986 but now were were spending this weekend in 1989 with our adult sons and daughters. He assured us that these young people were differ­ent from those freshmen we had brought to orientation. 
Different? Father Malloy may know about running universities, we reasoned, but he did riot know about our son. We knew our son, though. He looked no different; he sounded no dif­ferent; he was no different. Was the president wrong? 
This time as we prepared to leave we met for lunch on campus to savor the atmosphere and each other's company one last time. Then, as planned, our student would attend his next class and we would depart for the airport and our flight home. So, as the gently falling snow touched first the shoulders of stu­. dents scurrying to class and then settled on the already white grounds and paths, we parted. Our son joined classmates and strode away from us, forward to class and life, no longer alone and uncertain. He never looked back. But we emotion-filled parents remained riveted, silhouetted against the buildings, watching and waving continuously at our adult son's retreat­
ing back.

Except for Lon Kruger and Clem Haskins, almost every coach playing a mystery team in a first-round game in the NCAA basketball can sing the same refrain: "who are these guys?" 
It was stated most bluntly by Coach Ralph Miller of 21-7 Oregon State, for whom every game could be his last. Miller, whose Beavers are the sixth seed in the West regional, turned 70 last Thursday and is retiring after this season. 
"We absolutely know nothing about Evansville," he said 


Irish 
continued from page 20 
'"That's the kind of thing that happens in college basketball," Crum said when asked how El­lis' injury affected the outcome off the game. "It's frustrating when you can't go with your best kids." 
The game marked another quiet performance by Keith Robinson, who led the team with 18 points and 16 rebounds in Notre Dame's final home game of the season. 
The Irish took to the road in what Phelps described as Notre Dame's version of a con­ference tournament. On Mon­day, March 6, Notre Dame faced Butler in Indianapolis and scored its 19th win of the season with a 76-69 win despite a late surge by the Bulldogs. 
Playing without Ellis, the Irish were ahead by as many after finding ·out that his first­round opponent in Tucson Friday will be the 24-5 Purple Aces, champion of the Midwes­tern Collegiate Conference. 

"But we'll know something soon." 
The top seeds face the same problems, but should breeze through their games. Since the current 64-team format was es­tablished in 1985, the highest seeds to lose in the first round were Indiana to Cleveland State and Notre Dame to Arkansas-Little Rock in 1986. Indiana and Notre Dame were third seeds in their regions, the victors were 14th. 
This year's top four-­Georgetown in the East, Illi­
as 19 points in the second half and led 71-55 with two minutes to go, but Butler took advan­tage of Irish turnovers and missed free throws to make the game exciting, scoring 11 straight to pull to within six. 
Elmer Bennett and Jamere Jackson hit two free throws apiece to break the Bulldog streak and put the win in the books. 
Jackson led the Irish with 17 points, and Robinson again led the team in rebounds with 13. 
To ensure a sixth-straight 20­win season, the Irish had to travel to Milwaukee to face Marquette March 8. Backed by an inspired crowd, the War­riors were looking to avenge an earlier 83-68 loss at Notre Dame's Joyce ACC. 
That wasn't meant to be, as the Irish again had to scramble in the closing minutes but defeated Marquette 67-63. Al­though playing their second straight game without Ellis,

nois in the Midwest, Oklahoma in the Southeast and Arizona in the West--begin play as prohi­bitive favorites. 
Georgetown, whose domi­nant play in the Big East tourn­ament has made it the early favorite to win the overall title, meets Ivy League champion Princeton Friday in Provi­dence in a matchup that might have been more intriguing a year ago when Hoya Coach John Thompson's son played for the Tigers. 
Illinois will play in In­dianapolis Thursday against McNeese State, whose 16-13 record is the worst of any team in the tournament. 
Phelps' squad overcame the balanced Warrior attack and were led by Joe Fredrick's 20 points. 
In a game that saw the lead change hands numerous times, Jackson hit a baseline jumper with 2: 39 to play to tie the game at 61. Marquette's Trevor Powell answered with two of his 19 points to put the Warriors back on top, but Jackson again countered, this time hitting two foul shots to tie the game 63-63. 
Powell followed with a miss, and Jackson gave the Irish the lead for good with a penetrat­ing jump shot with 49 seconds to play. Robinson iced the vic­tory for the Irish with two free throws with three seconds to go. 
Notre Dame celebrated the return of Ellis against DePaul Saturday, but mourned the ab­sence of co-capitan Fredrick, who missed the trip to the Horizon with a sprained ankle suuffered late in Friday's prac­tice. The absence of their leading scorer was felt by the Irish, who fell to the Blue Demons 67-63. 
Terrence Greene and Stanley Brundy scored 21 and 20 points respectively for DePaul, which led by nine at the half, 40-31, and increased the lead to 54-38 with jst over five minutes gone in the second half. 
Over the next 10 minutes, the Irish battled their way back into the game, cutting the lead to 66-64 with 3: 53 to play. DePaul freshman Stephen Howard was the clutch per­former for the Demons, hitting five-of-six free throws in the final minutes to ensure that the Irish could get no closer. 
"We fought and scratched our way back and had a chance to win it," Phelps said. "That's what we have to do in the tourn­ament." 
The Irish players will have some time to heal, as they play at 9: 30 Friday night against the Commodores. A win in that game would pit the Irish against the winner of Sunday's Georgetown-Princeton contest. The Hoyas are the top seed in the East Regional.

Fredrick wins MVP at banquet 

Special to The Observer 
Junior guard Joe Fredrick earned the Notre Dame Monogram Club MVP Award at the annual Notre Dame bas­ketball banquet Monday. 
Fredrick earned two awards, as did LaPhonso Ellis, Keith Robinson and Tim Singleton. Jamere Jackson led the team with three awards. 
Jackson received the Best Defensive Player Award and the Father Tom Brennan Award for free-throw ac­curacy. He and Fredrick shared the Captain's Award. 
Ellis won the Most Accurate Shooter Award and shared the Rebounding Award with Rob­inson, who also won the Most Improved Player Award. 
Singleton captured the Assist Leader Award and also won the Role Player of the Year Award. 
Scott Paddock won the Notre 
Dame Club of St. Joseph Valley 
Student-Athlete Award for his 
3.03 cumulative grade point average. 
game. 
"It was a circus-like atmosh­pere, but a great atmosphere to be a part of. There was a lot of publicity for the game, and it was one of the largest mid­
week crowds they've had in a while." 
Grabe struck out 13 Irish bat­ters while giving up three runs in just over seven innings on the mound. Notre Dame starter Brian Piotrowicz overcame early control problems to allow one run in six innings and earn the win . 
"To be honest, I've got to say I did believe we could beat them," said Murphy. "They came at us with probably the number-one pitcher in the na­tion. We hung in there, had timely hitting and believed we could win." 
Irish shortstop Pat Pesavento broke a 1-1 tie in the eighth inning with a single that scored Eilers. Pesavento later scored to give Notre Dame a 3-1 advantage. 
"Pesavento is starting to for­get about his batting average and starting to think about just concentrating on his game, and when he does that, he plays really well," said Murphy. 
After Miami scored a run in the eighth, another Pesavento single drove in Ed Lund with the final run of the game in the ninth. 
Notre Dame stopper Mike Coffey came on in the ninth to record the save. Coffey has al­lowed just one run in six ap­pearances this season and has two wins and three saves to his credit. 
The Irish could not avoid a letdown the following day in an 11-2 loss to Vanderbilt. Fresh­man pitchers Brian Conway and Dan Marzec walked 10 Vanderbilt batters in the game. The Irish had as many errors (four) as they did hits. 
Notre Dame rebounded to win its final two games of the trip. Dan Peltier broke an 8-8 tie with seventh-inning two-run homer to spark the Irish to a 15-8 win over Pennsylvania, which reached the NCAA tournament last year. It was the third game-winning RBI of the year for Peltier, who also had a double and four RBI's. 
The Irish ended the trip with a 9-2 victory over Columbia.

Seniors lead All-Americans, but LSU frosh is the surprise 
Associated Press 
Seniors Sean Elliott, Danny Ferry, Stacey King and Sher­man Douglas. Make room for one more freshman All­American: Chris Jackson of Louisiana State. 
Jackson, college basketball's all-time freshman scoring leader, became only the second player of his class to make The Associated Press All-America team, announced Monday. 
He was joined by Arizona's Elliott, the only repeater on the first team, Duke's Ferry, Okla­homa's King and Syracuse's Douglas. 
The voting was done by the same national panel of sportwriters and broadcasters which selects the weekly Top Twenty. Each voter selected three teams with points dis­tributed on a 5-3-1 basis. 
Elliott, the 51st player to repeat as an All-America in the 41 years a team has been se­lected, was the top vote-getter with 324 points and was named on the first team by 63 voters, just edging Ferry, 318 and 61, and King, 316 and 60.

second-leading  scorer  at  30.1  

per game, a mark that will break the freshman standard of 29.4 set by Fly Williams of Austin Peay in 1973. Jackson's 932 points are already a fresh­man best and he has also managed 3.3 rebounds and 4.2 assists per game while facing a variety of defenses aimed at stopping LSU's most noted player since Pete Maravich. 
The 6-foot-8 Elliott, the Pac­lO's all-time leading scorer, leads the top-ranked Wildcats in scoring at 22.0 and assists at 
4.2 and is second in rebounding at 7.0. He is considered the per­fect swingman, switching easily from the forward to the guard position. 
"A year ago when he was playing with a veteran club, a great deal was required of Sean then but nothing like the load he's had this year," Wildcats coach Lute Olson said. "It's great to see this kind of recognition for a guy who in my opinion is the ultimate team player." 
Ferry has already been to Final Four with the Blue Devils and the 6-10 forward averaged a team-leading 22.7 points and 
7.4 rebounds while handing out 
3.0 assists per game. He is the only Atlantic Coast Conference player to ever amass 2,000 points, 900 rebounds and 480 as­sists. 
"Danny is probably the most high-profile player to come to Duke in the last decade," Blue Devils coach Mike Krzyzewski said. "He's exceeded my ex­pectations on the court and off the court I think he's probably been the most publicized Duke student in the past decade. I think he has earned the honors coming his way." 
King, a powerful inside player at 6-10, suffered a bro­ken index finger on his shooting hand midway through the season but it failed to deter from registering averages of 
26.3 points and 10.0 rebounds per game while blocking 70 shots and shooting 52.3 percent from the field.

second-year Irish coach. "Since we won the (MCC) tournament and the NCAA wasn't going to look at us anyway, that kind of ruled Loyola out. When they took us for the NIT, that pretty much eliminated them from conten­tion for the NIT. 
"We lost to Vanderbilt, Old Dominion, Tennessee and James Madison. They're all going to the tournament, so the NCAA looks at those as good losses." 
McGraw admitted that Notre Dame probably didn't deserve to go to the NCAA tournament this year, but she questioned the reasoning behind a couple of the selections, particularly those concerning Big East teams. 
"I didn't think we deserved to get an NCAA bid until I saw the field," she said. "The Big East is not a very strong con­ference for women, they don't have any teams in the Top 20 and yet the NCAA took three of their teams.

Lewis wins '89 lnterhall title behind second-half surge 

By KEN TYSIAC Sports Writer 
The Lewis Rebels used tena­cious defense and good outside shooting to defeat the Breen­Phillips Blitz and claim the Wo­men's Interhall Basketball crown before Spring Break. Mter a very tight first half in the championship game, the Rebels ran away from B.P. in the second half to win a 45-29 victory. 
In the opening minutes of the game, however, B.P. took con­trol, using their height advan­tage to dominate the boards and forge an 8-2 lead. The Rebels quickly struck back, however, and by the time the first quarter ended Lewis led 13-12. 
But as long as Lora Mangan, who had 10 points in the first quarter, stayed hot, B.P. stuck with the Rebels. A steal and layup by Lewis senior point guard Ellen Mouch at the buz­zer helped Lewis open up a 22­
17 lead after a tightly contested first half. The championship hopes of 
B.P. were doomed to fall just short, as Lewis turned on the afterburners in the second half. The Rebel fast break proved to be too much for Breen-Phillips to handle and a Lewis defensive adjustment held Mangan to just two points after halftime as the Rebels dominated the second half. 
A balanced attack was in­strumental in the Lewis vic­tory. Mouch and Lori Ciccone scored nine points each for the Rebels, while Sue Lippa pitched in eight. 
Lewis simply had too many weapons for B.P. to handle and the Blitz had trouble finding their offense after Lewis shut down Mangan in the second half. 
Mangan, who is only a fresh­man, led all scorers with 15 points, while Cynthia Guckien chipped in six for the Blitz. Mter the game, B .P. coach Jeff Heilert said, "We got beaten by a very well-disciplined team. We congratulate Lewis on their victory." 
Lewis coaches Tom Zidar and Mark Laboe said they were "very proud of our team. Our girls played with a lot of poise, and shot very well from the foul line." Indeed, the Rebels put on a foul shooting clinic, hitting 16 out of 17 from the charity stripe. 
"We had to make an adjust­ment on defense to stop Lora Mangan," said Zidar and Laboe. "We used a sagging man-to-man defense and tried to triple-team her in order to slow her down. 
"Ellen Mouch gave us great senior leadership," continued Laboe, "And we just meshed really well as a team at the end of the season. We worked well against the zone defense B.P. threw at us, and although we weren't the biggest team in the league, we were fortunate to come out on top." 

Lewis Hall won the 1989 women's interhall championship with a second half surge over Breen-Phillips. The Rebels continue to rack up the championships, having won the IH footbal title last fall.

Canadian drug trial continues 
Associated Press 
TORONTO --Canadian 
sprinter Angella Taylor Is­
sajenko confirmed testimony 
of Ben Johnson's track coach 
when she told a federal drug 
inquiry Monday that she got 
steroids from other athletes, in­
cluding former U.S. shotput 
champion Brian Oldfield. 
Issajenko testified that she 
started taking steroids 10 years 
ago ''to give me the extra edge 
I needed." 
Besides getting steroids from . Oldfield and others, Issajenko 
said she also got them from Los 
Angeles physician Robert 
Kerr, who wrote the book "The 
Practical Use of Anabolic 
Steroids with Athletes." 
Issajenko spoke of "hot 
shots" and "pyramids" of 
steroids and read from her 
diary in which she kept a 
detailed record of her training 
and use of banned substances. 
She was the first athlete to 
appear before the track and 
field hearings, called by the 
commission formed after 
Johnson was stripped of his 
Olympic gold medal for a pos­
itive steroid test last Septem­
ber. 
Charlie Francis, her coach as 
well as Johnson's, had named 
Issajenko during eight days of 
dramatic testimony on steroid 
use as the first of his athletes 
to try the banned substances. 
Issajenko, 30, said she dis­
cussed steroids with Francis 
and got a prescription in 1979 
for dianabol from the Canadian doctor they both went to. 
"Charlie and I went, and I expressed that I wanted to start a program of anabolics," Is­sajenko said. 
She said she made the deci­
sion after being soundly beaten 
by East German sprinters at a 
dual meet with Canada. 
"I saw these people and I 
wanted to be like them," she 
said. "I wanted to be just as 
fast as they were."

Irish finish season 20-8, face Vandy in 1st round 
Women's hoops wins MCC, earns NIT bid 

ND needs time to heal wounds 
By THERESA KELLY 
Sports Editor 
The ''Battle to Seattle" begins in earnest 
Friday as the Notre Dame men's basketball 
team travels to Providence, R.I., to play Van­
derbilt in the first round of the East Regional 
of the NCAA basketball tournement. 
The real post-season play comes on the heels 
of what Irish head coach Digger Phelps tabbed 
·'our conference tournement,'' made up of three 
road games to wrap up the regular season. 
Notre Dame battled injuries to key players as well as Butler, Marquette and DePaul to finish the regular season with 20 wins against eight losses, the sixth consecutive season the Irish have had at least 20 wins. 
The Irish started their spring break with an 87-77 loss to Louisville, which was coming off a home upset at the hands of Cincinnati. Kenny Payne led the Cardinals with 27 points, and clutch free throw shooting in the final minutes by LaBradford Smith (six-of-six from the stripe l kept any Irish comeback attempt at bay. 
"We needed to win," said Louisville head co­ach Denny Crum, whose team is also among the 64 in the NCAA Tournament. "We haven't been playing well, but we won on the road at Notre Dame." 
The difference in the game may have been the loss of Notre Dame freshman LaPhonso El­lis with a compound dislocation of his right in­dex finger. With just under three minutes gone in the first half, Ellis blocked a shot by Louis­ville star Pervis Ellison but came down with the injury and immediately left the court for treatment.

Notre Dame knew exactly where it stood Saturday night when it took to the court against Loyola in the champi­onship game of the inaugural Midwestern Collegiate Confer­ence women's basketball tournament in Dayton, Ohio. 
The winner would greatly en­hance its chances of obtaining a bid to a post-season tourna­ment while the loser would spend the off-season pondering what might have been. 
The Irish proved they were up to the challenge by soundly defeating the Lady Ramblers 75-53 to claim the MCC crown. It marked the second time in 



Irish defeat Miami, again

This time there were no ex­cuses. 
After hearing that Miami had not played particularly hard in Notre Dame's exhibition two­game sweep of the Hurricanes last fall, the Irish baseball team went out and did it again in a regular-season game on the road. 
Notre Dame (8-3) defeated the third-ranked Hurricanes 4­2 last Wednesday at Miami's Mark Light Stadium, highlight­ing a spring break trip to Florida that saw the Irish win four of their six games.

And while the NCAA tourna­ment selection committee wasn't willing to extend a bid to Notre Dame, the National In­vitational Tournament greeted the Irish with open arms. 
Notre Dame, which finished its regular season with a 20-9 mark, discovered Sunday it will face Toledo on March 23 in Amarillo, Texas in the opening round of the eight-team NIT. 
"We were excited," said Iri.sh coach Muffet McGraw of the prospect of extending the season a few more weeks: "We were hoping that we'd get an NIT bid because we won 20 games and we felt like we 


"What we did in the fall wasn't a fluke," said Notre Dame coach Pat Murphy. "Miami played its number-one team and played it for keeps. 
"The common adage is to win your games at home and be satisfied with it," continued Murphy. "We don't subscribe to that medicine. We beat them before, and we believed we could win again." 
This victory, coupled with an earlier win over Texas, has the Irish gaining national atten­tion. The ESPN-Collegiate Baseball Top 25 poll released Monday had Notre Dame ranked 25th. This is the first time that Lou Pavlovich, Jr.,

Texas is ranked second and Miami sixth in the new poll. 
"We· know we still have a long way to go," said Murphy. "We have a little added pres­sure now, and we just want to continue to improve and work hard."

"The first half was the best we played all year," said McGraw. "We shot 69 percent from the field, we only turned the ball over five times and just executed to perfection."
