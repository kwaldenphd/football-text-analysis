Irish Guard unit temporarily let go says band director . 
By JIM RILEY 
Assistant News Editor 
The Irish Guard has been temporarily dismissed, accor­ding to James Phillips, acting director of bands. 
"As of this time they are tem­porarily dismissed and <their dismissal l is under investiga­tion,'' said Phillips. "They are not disbanded." he said, adding that the Guard will continue as an institution. 
Phillips said not all of the Guard members were involved in the indiscretions. "Ap­parently it's not the entire Guard," he said. He declined to say which members or how many members were involved because he was still looking into the matter. 
Phillips declined to elaborate on the reasons why the Guard was dismissed. "It's a band problem, not a University prob­lem," he said. "It's no big deal." 
A notice appeared under glass on a bulletin board by the bandroom and band director's office in Washington Hall on 
Monday.  The  notice  said,  
"Because  of  severe  miscon­ 
duct  and  total  disregard  of  

band policy as regards alcohol consumption in uniform at the Penn State -ND game on Sat­urday, the Irish Guard have been dismissed from the band as of Monday, Nov. 17, 1986. 
The notice was written on a letterhead bearing the names of Phillips, Father George Wis­kirchen, assistant director of bands, and Nicholas Morrison, 
' 
also an assistant director of bands. 
Band members said that nothing was announced at practice Monday or Tuesday, but that the notice was visible to all in the hallway on both days. 
~·-'~..-,

Phillips said late Tuesday . . ·~ ~ '.~ that the notice was no longer posted. 
Guards who were contacted Tuesday refused to comment or referred comment to a guard they said would act as spokes­man. The spokesman returned a call and said, "We have no comment to say." 
Phillips said Monday he was not finished talking to the Guard, but he was unclear Tuesday as to whether or not a meeting between the Guard and himself had taken place. 
Band members said there is an appeal process for severed band members outlined in the band manual, but they said they were not sure if the process applies to Guard mem­bers. Appeals are usually made to the elected student band of­ficers who, after reviewing the case, make a recommendation to the directors, according to band members. The ultimate decision, however, rests with the directors, said band mem­bers. 

Band members said that ap­peals are often successful. The Observer;Suzanne Poch

North Korean president seen alive on television despite death reports 
Assorlatt>d J>rt>ss 
SEOUL, South Korea -North Korea showed its "great leader,'' President Kim II Sung, on television Tuesday while ignoring reports in rival South Korea that Kim died or was embroiled in a serious power struggle. 
A Defense Ministry spokes­man in Seoul acknowledged North Korean news media reports that Kim was alive and added: "we are closely watch­ing whether these develop­ments in the North have resulted from a serious inter­nal power struggle or its (the North's) high-level psychologi­cal warfare hiding a sinister plot for military provocation." 
An Asian diplomat in Pyon­gyang, reached by The Associ­ated Press by telephone from Peking, said he saw the 74­year-old Kim at Pyongyang Airport on Tuesday IIand he is in absolutely good health." 
The diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity, added: "Everything is all right in this country, the situation is ab­solutely normal. . . . There seems to be nothing correct about these reports (of an as­sassination or power seizure). . . . It is absolutely normal, there is nothing wrong. He is absolutely normal, he is in good health." 
Questions about Kim were raised Monday when the mini­stry said North Korean propaganda loudspeakers along the demilitarized zone between North·. and South Korea announced Kim was killed in a shooting incident. 

North Korean embassy offi­cials at various posts abroad denied Kim was dead, but offi­cial North Korean media kept silent through Monday. 
On Tuesda~. Pyongyang's of­ficial Korean Central News Agency said Kim had gone to Pyongyang Airport to welcome Mongolian President Jambyn Batmunkh and that cheers for Kim of "Long Jive the great leader!" burst forth from the thousands of peopk on hand. The report was monitored in Tokyo. 
Japanese television stations showed rare segments from North Korean television of Kim, in a dark overcoat and cap, walking up a gold­bordered red carpet to meet Batmunkh, shaking hands ami embracing him. The two walked together back down the carpet. Crowds lining one side cheered as soldiers stood at at­tention holding rifles with fixed bayonets.

Snow battle rages on quads 
By BUD LUEPKE 
Copy Editor 
A one-year armistice ended last night as snow prompted a band of north­quad guerillas to renew hos­tilities that rage during every first snow-fall of the school year. 
The north-quad contingent confronted Dillon Hall at 
10:37 p.m. Minutes later Alumni Hall residents ig­nited Roman-candles and smoke bombs while Dillon mobilized more than a hundred residents into the first battle behind the Sorin statue. 
The armies numbered into the thousands as residents from most halls answered cries issuing from the campus. 
However, casualities and property damage marred much of the fun and games. The Notre Dame Infirmary reported that "quite a few" students had come in with injuries from the snow-fight and were still coming in early this morning. 
Rector of Cavanaugh Hall Father Matthew Miceli said not much damage had been 
done  but  said  there  were  
"one  or  two  broken  win­ 
dows" in his hall.  

Father Joseph Carey, rec­tor of Dillon Hall, had no damage to report but said he expected some damage before the battle ended. "For the past ten years something has happened," he said. 
Rector of Sorin Hall Bro­ther Thomas O'Malley said nothing had been broken in his hall either. But he added, "This thing is so stupid." 




In Brief 

Theodore's will be closed until after Thanksgiving break according to Theodore's student manager Laurie Bink. Bink said the dance floor needs to be revarnished because it wasn't waxed right when first built and more people have been dancing on it than were originally expected. She also said damages from this past weekend still need to be repaired. -The Observer 
David Letterman is in trouble with his local police again. Letterman, fined $40 in May when caught using a radar detector in his car, was stopped last week for driving 57 mph in a 40 mph zone. He also received a ticket for not having a valid Connecticut driver's license, police said. Letterman has until Dec. 5 to contest his latest ticket, worth $147, or to plead guilty and mail in the fine. ­

Visit to Cornell reminds one of Notre Dame's blessings 
When I was deciding which college to attend, I flirted briefly with the idea of going to Cornell University. Cornell had a good government pro­gram and from the pictures in the catalog, seemed to be a beautiful campus. 
I came close to applying, but the cost of at­tending Cornell was way out of reach. Months later, I was accepted at Notre Dame. 
This past fall break, I had a lot of time on my hands, so I decided to take a trip Cornell and look at what I had passed up. I know a girl at Cornell that graduated from high school with me. While I was in the neighborhood, I thought I would drop in. 
When I got there, it took me over a half-hour to find a parking space on campus, parking being a precious commodity on the campus. After I parked, I'spent a good deal of the day wandering around the campus. 
I thought construction at Notre Dame had been bad, Cornell was swamped with new con­struction. They were even tearing down one building to make room for a new one. 
The campus store was interesting to visit since the whole building was underground (I almost missed it completely). The student cen­ter was very impressive, all six stories of it. 
Other than that, I was a little disappointed. Cornell didn't look as nice as it had in the cat­alog. Maybe I'm just too used to looking at Touchdown Jesus and the Grotto. 
In some places at Cornell there were overly­spacious quads and in others the buildings were jammed next to each other. The campus was right in the middle of the city of Ithaca; take one step off campus and you were in the city. There were cars going through the campus without any restrictions. 
Quite a change from Notre Dame. 

It was late in the afternoon when I visited Lorrie. We hadn't seen each other for close to a year-and-a-half, so needless to say she was quite surprised when I came into her off­campus house. ("Eric! What are you doing here?") 
We talked for over two hours. We talked about what we had been doing since the last time we had seen each other. Inevitably, we talked about our two schools; mine under the Golden Dome and her's high above Cayuga's waters. 
Cornell doesn't have parietals. Lorrie told me about a girl who lived with her boyfriend in her dorm freshman year. As long as you pay room and board, they don't care who you room and board with at Cornell. I had to repeatedly remind myself that I went to a Catholic univer­sity where such things are frowned upon. 
Unlike Notre Dame, dorm-life isn't as impor-

tant at Cornell. More students at Cornell live 
off campus and commute than at Notre Dame. 
The issue of divestment was definitely more heated at Cornell. Pro-divestment forces had built a number of "shanty towns" on one of the quads at Cornell. Each one torn down by secur­ity. The confrontations between the two were becoming increasingly violent while the majority of the student really didn't care about the issue. 
But some things never change when going to different colleges. Lorrie had a huge report due for a class the next day and she was going to start it after "Moonlighting." 
I don't think I would have been happy going to Cornell, and I don't think Lorrie would've been happy going to Notre Dame. Indeed, we both loved the schools we attended and would stay at our schools until we graduated, maybe even staying for graduate studies. 
I enjoy going to football games and watching Tim Brown run kickoffs back for scores. Lorrie enjoys going to Cornell hockey games and seeing the Big Red win a big one. I love the camaraderie and friendship of living in Zahm Hall while Lorrie likes the independence of living off-campus. 
I'm happy at Notre Dame and Lorrie is happy at Cornell. I've heard that being happy with what you have is the best thing. 
I don't think Lorrie and I would have it any other way.

Tuxedo-clad bomber arrested for booby-trapped bouquet of flowers 
Associated Press 
SAN FRANCISCO -A man identified by police as the tuxedo-clad bomber who delivered a booby-trapped bou­quet that injured two women was arrested Tuesday at a country house he reportedly shared with the estranged hus­band of one of the victims. 
Shaun Small, 27, was taken into custody in rural Lake County on a federal warrant charging him with detonation of an explosive device involv­ing personal injury. Bail was set at $100,000. 
The bomber allegedly tried to deliver a second flower ar­rangement to one of the vic­tims' parents a short time after Monday's explosion, but the woman's 78-year-old father turned him away. 
Lake County sheriff's Capt. Glen Perkins said Small was arrested without incident when he left a house and got into a car in Clearlake Park, about 75 miles northeast of San Fran­cisco. 
He said the FBI had asked officers to watch the house be­cause it was believed Small was sharing it with longtime friend Peter Pilaski. 
Pilaski is the estranged hus­band of one of the bombing vic­tims, Melanie Pilaski, 41. FBI Agent Robert Delinski said 


Korea 
continuedfrom page 1 
Earlier Tuesday, the South Korean Defense Ministry said North Korean loudspeakers were blaring that 0 jin U, North Korea's defense mini­ster, had seized power. There were no details. 
The South's defense mini­ster, Lee Ki-baek, said that as of 10:04 a.m. Tuesday, the loudspeakers were playing somber funeral music and saying "The nation's great star has fallen. Let us glorify his great achievements.'' 

That was about the same time first reports were coming from Pyongyang that Kim was at the airport. 
At noon, Lee added, the loudspeakers said Kim had delegated all power to his 44­year-old son, Kim Jong 11. 
U.S. military authorities said conditions were normal Tues­day around Panmunjom, the truce village in the DMZ. 
Tuesday authorities also were searching for Pilaski, but only to question him. 
Authorities said the bombing apparently stemmed from an ugly divorce proceeding be­tween the Pilaskis. Ms. Pilaski's father, Willard Swanstrom, said Small recently threatened his daughter because she had frozen the couple's bank ac­counts. 
Also injured was Ms. Pilaski's co-worker, Pamela Castro, 42, of San Bruno. 
An all-points bulletin for Small was issued less than an hour after the bomb exploded in the GSA office on the 33rd floor of the downtown Tishman Building, where Ms. Pilaski is a supervisor handling federal government supply surpluses, said San Francisco Police Of­ficer Dave Ambrose. 
He said Ms. Castro told offi­cers she heard the bouquet of dried flowers had been left at the GSA mailroom on the 32nd floor and she carried them up

to Ms. Pilaski's desk. 
"I placed the basket of flowers between Melanie and myself," she was quoted as saying in the police report. "Melanie reached into the bas­ket, grabbing a wallet-sized box in silver wrapping paper with pink ribbon. When Melanie lifted the small box, it exploded." 
Ambrose said a witness who knew Small said she saw him deliver the flowers to the GSA office. That witness and others told police the man was dressed in a white tuxedo and a derby and was wearing makeup, in­cluding eyeliner, and what ap­peared to be a fake beard and mustache, the officer said. 
He said officers also learned Small may have been headed for the El Cerrito home of Ms. Pilaski's parents. 
Taxi driver Peter Chandler told police he picked up a man, who he believed to be a florist, at the El Cerrito station of the BART subway system and drove him to the Swanstroms' home.

SMC collects $1,077 for United Way fund 
By KAREN WEBB 
Copy Editor 

The Saint Mary's United Way campaign came to a close Nov. 14 with a total of $1,077 col­lected, announced Sarah Cook, vice president for student af­fairs, at Tuesday night's Pro­gramming Board meeting. 
The total fell short of the original goal of $1,800, accor­ding to Cook, because halls and classes pledged only one-third of what they did last year. 
"You did a good job with it, though, because I know how hard it is to collect money from people," Cook said to members of the board. 
Cook announced a student subcommittee will be forming to study the ''Mission of the Col­lege" statement in the Saint Mary's Bulletin of Informa­tion. 
According to Cook, the sub­committee will also study the Holy Cross sisters' Philosophy of Education which is more detailed and specific than the bulletin's statement. 

The mission statement pres­ently in the bulletin was written in 1972. 
The purpose of the commit­tee is to update and rewrite the mission statement for the bul­letin, which is designed to out­line the school's approach to education as a Catholic liberal arts college for women, by in­corporating both the Philoso­phy statement and the Mission statement, Cook said. 
The subcommittee of 11 stu­dents, consisting partly of stu­dent government members, will be chaired by Rebecca Het­land, student member of the Board of Regents. 
Cook also announced the Ox­fam Fast will be this Thursday. 
This year's theme, "Feminization of Poverty," is the topic of a lecture to be given at Regina Hall, 7:30, Wednes­day night, before the fast begins at 9 p.m., according to Cook.

Society must cultivate a true attitude of peace 
In his talk with Notre Dame students, Jerry Falwell was questioned about his feelings toward the American bombing of Libya that occured in April, 1986. Simply put, he supported the action as most Americans do and putting it simp­ly, he justified the action as good people <Americans) defending themselves against a bad person ( Ghadafi). This letter is not addressing that specific opinion or incident. I'd like to question the attitude seemingly held by Falwell and many other Americans toward ac­hieving world peace and also to suggest a silly and idealistic, but a better and more realistic way of achieving world peace. 

Pete Morgan 
guest column 
I'd like to consider the idea of peace -a peace that is beyond merely the ab­sence of war. Such a peace cannot be American, just as history has proven that peace cannot be Roman, English, or German. True world peace cannot stem from the ideals of one nation or culture because these ideals inevitably clash with the peace ideals of another nation or culture. In the same way, peace cannot be made or kept by gov­ernments because governments exist only to protect and advance the inter­ests of their respective peoples. An ex­ample of a lack of peace exists in Nor­thern Ireland. Many people in the Republic of Ireland believe that if the British would simply go back to their own island, peace would be achieved. Many British people feel just as strongly that Northern Ireland is jus­tifiably theirs and that if the Irish would leave them alone, peace would be achieved. The ideas clash and conflict exists, but the governments are not at war. 
The situation is incredibly complex, involving factors from economics to educational systems. What it points out is that governments cannot establish peace, for even if one government or the other were to withdraw its claim, peace would not be achieved. Animosity toward the other side would still exist -and even increase-in the hearts of people on both sides. The con­flict exists between people on both sides and in their attitudes toward their op­position. Peace does not trickle down from governments that are not at war with each other; rather, true peace comes from the ground up, with gov­ernments being able to negotiate meaningful changes only after an atti-
Doonesbury 
tude of peace exists among the people of both sides. Until this attitude of peace exists, people cannot depend on government -any government-to negotiate anything more than a tempo­rary absence of war. 
So what is an attitude of peace? It is more than just the hope that there will be no more war, and it is not the idea that ours is the best way and that others should learn to conform to our beliefs and to play by our rules. These attitudes are held by every culture on earth, and obviously peace does not exist in the world. This "Us vs. Them" mentality is the source of every conflict on the face of the earth, bar none. It follows that an attitude of peace must tran­scend these "Us vs. Them" mental bar­riers. It means that all people must seek a simple "Us" mentality. It means that all must appreciate the differences between people and to seek to under­stand why we are different; it does not blame "Them" for being wrong in their thinking. 

People must realize that differences in history, culture, and religion make it impossible for, say, the Arab and the Israeli Jew to really understand each other. However, a common human na­ture can be understood by people of all races, and nothing stops anyone from being able to appreciate and accept dif­ferences, if he is willing to try. Such an attitude requires that we love our neighbor as much as we love ourselves which, by the way, is a value found af the core of all the world's great religions, not just Christianity. Such an attitude requires a great willingness to give. 
As a Christian, I believe that Christ challenges us to work to establish the Kingdom of God here on earth. I know that we live in a very human world, but I believe that a world in which this at­titude of peace was prevalent would be at least a giant step closer to the Kingdom. It is improbable that this peace will never exist, and if it ever should, it is a safe bet that you and I will never see it. However, anyone who has ever laughed with or made friends with a person from a different back­ground or nationality can agree that such a peace is not impossible. 
We can look also to the whole spec­trum of time and gain hope. We can look to the advances made by mankind through the centuries and see, for in­stance, how modern societies have evolved from essentially barbaric civilizations and how evolving technol­ogy now makes instantaneous commu­nication, sharing of information, and even contact between people separated

geographically possible. This gives us a great advantage over our forefathers in our attempt to understand others. We can look to the future and see that space exploration provides a perfect chance for separate nations to come to­gether and work toward a common goal. 
We must realize that to achieve a goal of peace or anything near it, the human race must advance at least as far as it has come to date. We don't know when our time will run out, and assuming that we don't end things ourselves, let us hope that since this universe was created with so much which has not yet been explored and that human society is blessed with so much unmanifested potential, the Creator will not choose to end things yet, thereby leaving so much of His work seemingly for naught. 
Most importantly, let us treat this ide.alism realistically. The attitudes of a society can change at the rate of only one individual at a time. It isn't easy to change, it isn't natural to change, and in our case, these attitudes won't make America number one in anything except maybe the quest for true peace. It will take uncountable individuals all over the world to adapt this attitude before any effects will ever be seen, and we will never live to see these ef­fects in all probability. However, we all know the alternatives and how dan­gerously close we are to them. Let peace begin with me-we've all said these few words before. If we are to advance toward the Kingdom on earth, someone must take the first step. If not us now, then who will and when?

P.O.BoxQ 
Attacking individuals is also close-minded 
Dear Editor: 
I am writing in response to Matthew Slaughter's guest column, "Fundamen­talists Resist Diversity of Thought,'' re­garding seven families who are suing their local schools over textbooks they consider offensive to their religious beliefs. The article stated that fun­damentalists "are now calling for the eradication of one of the basic tenets upon which our government and society are founded: diversity of thought." 
First of all, absolutely no one has the right to judge another religion. 
Second, the author is as narrow­minded as he claims fundamentalists to be. So some people in Tennessee do not want their children exposed to cer­tain material and they are fundamentalists-the only people who are pathologically over-protective of their children. Consider the person who wrote a letter to Father Hesburgh stating that the song "Louie, Louie" had sexual connotations and should not be played at football games. This per­son is certainly not encouraging diver­sity of thought, and she is not necessar­ily a fundamentalist. My point is that no parent, whether Catholic, Protes­tant, or Jewish, really wishes for his or her children to be exposed to ideas that are not in keeping with their religious

faith. That is precisely why parents send their children to private, religiously-affiliated schools. 
Furthermore, in stating that there is "a serious problem with the fundamen­talists," Slaughter is exhibiting the same elitist attitude for which he con­demns them. This is not to say that Slaughter and those who share his su­perior attitude "must be rounded up in a heretical witch hunt and burned at the stake." However, "we cannot per­mit any group in our society to attain the dangerous mentality of intellectual supremacy. Society possesses a duty to itself to prevent the development of such a population at all costs." 
Slaughter's article was nothing more than a slanted, cynical attack on a group of individuals.

Soviet tube stations are rather boring compared with the more familiar London Underground. They are probably, on the whole, more beautiful, with their stained glass and chan­deliers. They are certainly more efficient. Moscavites usually wait 60 seconds for a train while Londeners wait seven minutes. Being deeper underground and much roomier, they even make better bomb shelters. But they are boring; there are no punks, no huskers, and no advertising --especially no advertising.

Associated Press KATY, Tex. -Roger Clemens, who won 24 games in his first full season with the Boston Red Sox, capped a dream year yes­terday by becoming the first starting pitcher in 15 years to win the American League's Most Valuable Player Award. The 24-year-old right-hander captured 19 of 28 first place votes for 339 points in easily outdistancing Don Mattingly of the New York Yankees and Boston teammate Jim Rice in the balloting by the Baseball Writers Association of America.

"I thought I did have a pretty good chance even though I was a starting pitcher,'' said Clemens at his home in Katy. He conceded, though, that the news still was a bit of a shock. 
"I was going to come home tonight and see on TV if I finished second or third, but Debbie (his wife) wanted me to stay around the house." 
He learned of the award by telephone, and immediately called his wife, who was at an obstetrician's office. She is ex­pecting the couple's first child in five days. 
some of Notre Dame's current opponents should put the Irish out of the situation of becoming a Top-20 teams' punching bag. But it also takes some of the glitter off the schedule. 
Seeing SMU, Alabama, Miami, LSU, USC on your schedule can do a lot for en­thusiasm. Without those types of headliners, the Irish will have to generate almost all the interest for the games them­selves.

"I hope by winning this award I have put an exclama­tion mark in the minds of voters about starting pitchers winning it. If I was voting, I'd vote for my teammate Jim Rice. But I felt one of us should win it."

is quite surprising, but it seems like a reasonably good idea. As long as Corrigan doesn't go overboard in challenging the cream of academic institutions that are genuine cupcakes on the gridiron, the system should work out well. 
The Irish should stack up more victories, and possibly add another home game on their schedule. That's all fine, but if Notre Dame starts playing Ivy League schools, count me out.

'Aggressive' Bolcar aids Irish defense, special teams 
Hy MIKE CHMIEL Sports Writer 
Ned Bolcar has played linebacker on the defense, ful­lback on the offense and cap­tain on the special teams this year for the Irish. He may epitomize the versatile football player. 
Bolcar's future, however, rests behind the defensive line as an inside linebacker. 
"I'd like to play inside linebacker," Bolcar says. "My personality is on defense. I like to hit. I'm aggressive. I can get to the ball. I am more of a de­fensive player. 
For the Irish, new players will key the rebuilding as Lou Holtz and his system complete the transition to lead the Irish. While the young players on this year's roster will move into fill vacancies generated by graduating seniors next year, many are either already hel­ping the Irish or hoping to achieve greater responsibili­ties as the season concludes. 
Playing behind senior cap­tain Mike Kovaleski, Bolcar may not see much playing time this year. According to Irish de­fensive coordinator and inside linebacker coach Foge Fazio, however, Bolcar's aggressive­ness and positive attitude augur well for the future. 
"Ned is an energetic compet­itor," says Fazio. "He does everything a hundred miles an hour.... Ned has a lot of strong points about him. He's very agressive, he hits hard, he plays with a lot of emotion, he has real good quickness and real good speed." 
While Bolcar must wait for a starting assignment to arise, Bolcar contributes his leader­ship ability to the Irish on a part-time basis as a back-up at inside linebacker and on a full­time basis as the special teams captain. Following a strong ef­fort on the punt teams, Bolcar achieved a role on the kickoff teams and was subsequently delegated as a captain by Holtz. 
"To me, (to be named as a captain l is an honor," the soph­omore says. "All of the people on the special teams have the desire to play, and we play hard. 
"We've done a pretty good job of improving," Bolcar con­tinues. "Even though our goal is to be perfect, you can't ex­pect everyone to be perfect. You have to criticize (the spe­cial teams) when they're not doing well, because through criticism, we'll keep trying to improve and keep trying to get better. And someday, no one will be able to criticize us. 
"At times, our special teams have faltered -they haven't played up to the level that you 

Ned Bolcar 
have to in order to win a na­tional championship. I don't think our special teams have lost too many games because there's an offense and a defense involved also." 
While Bolcar's natural posi­tion is at inside linebacker, he is capable of playing at ful­lback. Following a rough out­ing against Michigan State, the Irish moved Bolcar to a reserve

role at fullback. He played on the offensive side until the Air Force game. 
"If I'm called to play another position, like fullback, I'm ca­pable of doing that, but that's not my natural position," Bol­car says. "Inside linebacker is a key position because you'reinvolved in every phase of the defensive game pass coverage, sweeps, up the middle runs -you name it and you're involved." 
In high school, Bolcar earned four letters in football while playing both ways as a fullback and inside linebacker. Bolcar also earned four letters as a basketball forward and three letters as a baseball centerfielder. As a high school linebacker, Bolcar totaled 181 solo tackles and 30 drops for a loss. He also rushed for over 470 yards and scored six touch­downs. 
"I'm three or four inches to short to play basketball, but I still may go back to play baseball someday," Bolcar says. "I like the competition and the team concept in foot­ball." 
As a top academic and ath­letic prospect, Bolcar chose to attend Notre Dame primarily because the Irish maintain a

rich tradition in football and the potential to rise to the top soon. 
"I always thought highly of Notre Dame," Bolcar says. "I came to Notre Dame to be part of a winning football program. I felt that if there was any place in this country that would be exciting to be a winner at, it would be Notre Dame. 
"When Notre Dame is a win­ner, and we will be very soon, everybody in the country will care. Notre Dame has a follow­ing everywhere, and I want to be a part of that -the Notre Dame winning tradition com­ing back." 
Moving to the collegiate ranks, Bolcar recognizes greater diligence and more dis­appointments as different from the high school ranks. 
"The biggest change ... the number of hours you put into both football and academics," Bolcar says. "Also ... I found more disappointment. With over 130 players on a team, not everyone is happy. The hardest about college football is the dis­appointment of friends and teammates. You have a lot of talented people vying for a few spots." 
Bolcar also believes that dis­
appointment characterizes the 
attitude among the Irish this 
season. However, he believes 
that once the Irish settle in un­
der their new head coach, they 
will achieve confidence and 
success. 
''Disappointment . . . the whole season has been 'so close,' but it's coming to the point where you can't say that anymore," Bolcar says. "For the seniors, I feel bad. They're on their way out. They deserve a lot of respect for what they've done for the last four years ­the turmoils and how they've hung in there. For the younger guys, we need to prepare for next year and not let a similar thing happen. 
"The transition in coaches is 
still in progress ... we're still 
not settled in. The players and 
the coaches, however, are 
gaining confidence." 
Flutie happy if he plays 
Associated Press 
LAKE FOREST, Ill. -Doug Flutie is not exactly treading through a mine field, but he prefers to step gingerly as a backup quarterback with the Chicago Bears. 
"I'm comfortable and relaxed," said the 1984 Heis­man Trophy winner from Bos­ton College. "But I won't feel like I belong until I get out on the field." 
The Bears acquired Flutie from the Los Angeles Rams for a sixth-round draft choice last month.

Nine returners to spur SMC basketball team 
By MARISA KOSLA Sports writer 
The Saint Mary's varsity basketball team, whose season begins next week, has set its goals. Besides trying to improve on last year's 8-13 record, the Belles hope to win tournaments and qualify for districts by relying on their strengths. 
"This is the strongest team I've seen in my three years at Saint Mary's," said Head Coach Marvin Wood. 
The team's strength lies in its nine returning players. Senior guard Kim Pantelleris will remain in the backcourt, and juniors Rachel Bir, Step­hanie Duke and Donna Wolf will be alternating at the foward position. Junior Tammye Radke will join Pan­telleris at the guard position. 
Sophomores Laura Danch, Jennifer Harte, Cathy Mansfield and Lisa McGrath are looking foward to a rewarding season. 
"We hope to have a winning team," said Wood. 
With the experience of re­turning players and the en­ergy of new team members, the Belles' chances look promising. 
Freshmen on the squad in­clude Amy Baranko, Mary Elaine Cassidy, Anne Gallag­her, Susan Leto and Julie Radke. 
The Belles have already taken steps to capture a win­ning season. By beginning an early conditioning program of running and weight training, the team has a head start on the competition. 
"Conditioning has been a big plus," said Wood. "Besides becoming a stronger team, we are definitely a quicker team." 
Aside from the advantages of being fit, the Belles hope height will work in their fa­vor. 
"Defensively, we should get more rebounds, while offen­sively we should get the second shot," said Wood. 
Along with size, skills will play a key role in the 1986 season. 

"We are hoping to see ag­gressive rebounding and con­sistant shooting from the wing-post position," ex­plained Wood." Also, we have players with good defensive skills. But it's not going to be easy." 
This year's competition will be tough. The Belles face St. Joseph's College and St. Francis College. 
"Women's basketball is hard to predict. Everyone im­proves every year," said Wood. 
Last week the Belles played a scrimmage against Lake Michigan College. The team used the game as a learning experience. "All fourteen players got into the game, and they all showed great potential," said Wood. 
The Saint Mary's varsity basketball team offically begins their season Novem­ber 22-23 by playing St. Francis' invitational in Joliet, Illinois.

Following a second-place finish in the nine-team Mic­higan State Invitational, an injury-riddled wrestling team opens its home season against Air Force tonight at 7 p.m. in the ACC Pit. 
"Traditionally, Air Force has a pretty good program. We're kind of in the dark right now because they're so far away and we don't com­pete with any of the teams they play. There'snowaywe can prepare specifically for them," said Head Coach Fran McCann. "I don't think they'll be that physical, but they'll be extremely well conditioned." 
The Irish will be without sophomore 126-pound starter Dave Carlin and freshman 190-pound starter Dan Mitchell, both of whom suffered injuries at Mic­higan State. Seniors Greg Fleming and Dave Helmer will take over their respec­tive positions tonight. 

While Carlin and Mitchell 
Fran McCann 
are the only ones missing tonight's action, several other Irish wrestlers are also bothered by injuries. 
"I've been coaching about 20 years and this is the worst I've seen it. It's like an epidemic," said McCann. 
"We're hoping to get the in­juries out of the way by Christmas, because the meat of our schedule is after then." 
McCanq is hoping that an enthusiastic home crowd can compensate for the in­juries and inexperience cur­rently plaguing the Irish. 
"We like it at the Pit be­cause it has a close-in atmo­sphere, and we need some fans to generate enthusiasm in that atmosphere." 
Starting for Notre Dame tonight will be 118-pound freshman Andy Raden­baugh, Fleming, 134-pound Jerry Durso, 142-pound soph­omore Pat Boyd, 150-pound junior Ron Wisniewski, 158­pound sophomore Dan Car­rigan, 167-pound senior Tom Ryan, 177-pound sophomore Chris Geneser, and Helmer. 
"Their attitude's really 
good,  and  the  kids  are  
working  hard,"  said  
McCann.

Miami of Ohio, Minnesota and Southwest Missouri State are all also in the running and are ranked ahead of the Irish in the recent NCAA Midwest poll. 
Notre Dame has faced Eas­tern Michigan only once before, in a home match last season. The Irish struggled to a come-from-behind, 4-15, 15­12, 15-6, 1-15, 15-4 victory. This Notre Dame team, however, has come a long way since then, as is evident by its im­pressive statistics. 
"We're surprised at the num­ber of matches we have won, but not that we're winning," said Assistant Coach Patty Hagemeyer, a 1980 graduate of the University of Minnesota. Hagemayer was inducted into Minnesota's Hall of Fame this October for her stellar volley­ball career with the Golden Gophers. 
The Irish have been led this season by the impressive play of sohomore Mary Kay Waller, who currently is ninth in the nation in kill percentage (.386) and blocks per game (1.6).

Akers resigns head coaching spot; teaching named as reason for move 
By JANE SHEA Sports Writer 

Saint Mary's soccer coach John Akers resigned last Wed­nesday after serving as head coach for five years. Akers' decision to step down was motivated by a desire to devote more time to teaching. 
Akers' decision to step down as head coach came as a surprise to the Saint Mary's team. 
"We were all very surprised. Coach Akers was always very commited and never gave us any reason to believe he might be resigning," said senior cap­tain Gloria Eleuteri. 
In Akers five years as head coach, he brought the team from club status to the varsity level in the last two years. AI-though Akers has resigned the top post with the Belles, he will remain with the Belles as an assistant coach. 
This winter he is also coach­ing the indoor soccer team, a tournament in February, and will be recruiting perspective players. 
''The soccer team took a lot of responsibility and time,"said Akers. "Although I enjoyed it, I want to put more time into teaching." 
Next year Akers will be up for tenure, which is more pres­sure for him. 
Akers will be there next season to help the new head coach adjust, since he knows all the players and the pre­ssures they have as students. 
"I believe the Belles should be a strong varsity team next year, since we have another strong freshmen class coming in," said Akers. 
The present team members are all in weight training this winter and are playing indoor soccer. 
After ending this season with a 7-9-1 record, Akers antici­pates the Belles will have a winning season next year. 
"We will be playing more varsity teams and dropping some of the clubs,"said Akers. "I feel very positive about the team for next year." 
"Although I have some regrets about leaving, I will still be there as an assistant coach. I appreciate all the sup­port I have received from the Saint Mary's atheletic depart­ment over the last five years." 
Weaker schedule hopefully won't include Ivies 
If you can't beat them, don't play them. 
A stance similar to this seems to be the latest word out of Athetic Director Gene Corrigan's of­fice. He was quoted last week as saying that the Irish were going to begin to play schools with which they had more in common. 
This means teams such as Miami, Alabama and LSU may make fewer appearances on the Irish schedule. To fill their void, teams such as Virginia, Stanford, Boston College and, yes, even Northwes­tern will be paying more visits. 
Obviously, Notre Dame is sick of playing the No.l-rated schedule in terms of difficulty, as they have again this year. We keep hearing that the record must suffer because of the list of heavyweights awaiting the Irish every year. 
But now it seems as though Corrigan is sick of throwing the Irish up against the giants of football week in and week out. He wants to arrange for Notre Dame to be Goliath every once in a while. 
Who can really blame him? Strength of schedule is a very important measure of a team's quality. The Irish are being mentioned for the Aloha Bowl despite their losing record just because of their schedule. But despite the respect a tough schedule commands, simple markers in the "W" column are a lot more noticeable. 
Yet while these moves seem to be in the right

direction, we have to keep in mind that by the time we see a schedule with only four teams ranked in the preseason Top-20, most of us will be in the depths of a mid-life crisis. 
Schedules are agreed upon far into the future, and they have to be. For instance, the current contract with Michigan calls for ten opening games between the Irish and the Wolverines. Many of the other contracts are made on a home­and-home basis, but for several years. 
With the large number of years involved, it is often hard to expect exactly how good an opponent is going to be five or six years down the road. But it isn't really all that difficult. After all, how often is Michigan going to be a weakling, or Northwes­tern a power? 
So the move to a different type of schedule is underway. Will this move lessen the excitement of a Notre Dame season? Increase it? It's hard to tell where the tradeoff point for wins as opposed to strength-of-opponent lies. Is it a bigger game to be playing the third-rated team when your team is 4-4, or is it more monumental to be 6-2 and battling it out with 1-7 Northwestern? Which is more exciting? 
The one area that Notre Dame figures to be hurt in view of such a switch is in television revenues. The current schedule put the Irish on ABC for four games, and CBS for one, not to mention the cable deals for the rest, excluding SMU. With a lineup featuring the schools Corrigan mentioned earlier, the television contracts will not be quite as lucra­tive. 
That could be why the athletic department sud­denly annonunced that the Irish need to play six home games a year to bring in enough revenue. 
But while Notre Dame's frustration at playing excellent games only to get another mark in the loss column contributes a great deal to the switch in future opponents, another major part of the idea is a purely idealistic belief that Notre Dame should find schools of similar standards to play. 
Although the committee has yet to find an op­ponent that shares our ethanol abundance, the other candidates do appear to be quite similar to Notre Dame in that academics are a major part
