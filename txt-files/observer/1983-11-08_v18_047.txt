newspaper. Ifwe don't have the sup­port ofthe students for an independ­ent newspaper, we might as well pack up and leave." Dziedzic said. 
Dziedzic recognized the need for a superior to the editor-in-chief, to insure continuity from year to year. He was uncertain, however, whether a publisher or a board would be most beneficial. 
Jim Ganther, Editor ofScholastic 

magazine, said that as far as "how the University budget system works, everyone seems to be operating un­der a faulty premise". Ganther said he believes it is "not the Univer­sity's intention to say how the 
money will be spent". Ganther said

that, "the University stands behind 
the Scholastic, and if we default, 
they've got to make it up". 
Callaghan proposed two commit­tees to handle the situation. One, made up ofthree people, most likely faculty, would decide any disagree­
ments between the administration and the newspaper. Callaghan sug­gested faculty because he thought they were neutral while retaining some degree ofinvolvement in labor relations. 
A second committee, of seven to nine students, having no connection with The Obsen,er, student govern­ment or any other organization that would cause them to be biased, would make a fiscal policy and give approval to the Obseruer budget. 
"Having students giving fiscal policy and budgetary approval keeps it a newspaper primarily of the stu­dents," Callaghan said. Dziedzic responded with, "It's a very good place to start, but we still dispute the University's budget control idea". 
Student government is concerned with the number of student tickets given to the student body for away football games. Student government has discussed this issue in the past, realizing that student complaints about the unfairness of the distribu­tion and the lack of tickets, arc true. For example, the student body received 40 tickets for the Penn St. game, but Penn St. gave Notre Dame 
5,000 tickets. "We received 0.8/ of all tickets, and I think that's a major problem." Callaghan said. "If it's our team, and they're our peers, I think we should get a justified number of tickets". 
Student government passed a resolution urging "that a simple ice rink be installed on the Stepan courts during the winter months," according to the resolution, Rob Bertino, Senator for District 1, said that the plan has been estimated as feasible, but the only problem is maintenance. "Right now, interhall hockey teams have to rent space at the ACC for S60 an hour," Callaghan said. 
There is an "interest in increased opportunities for ice-skating", the resolution says. The rink would con­sist of a wooden container and a polyethylene base, costing ap­proximately S200 and ranging 2 courts in length.

The scenario for war is that the CIA's ter­rorist altacks will eventually provoke the Nicaraguans to strike hack. possibly into Hon­duras where -1,000 l '.S. troops arc stationed li>r "mant·uvcrs." This will give Reagan all tht· justification ht· nct·ds to wage war. telling the Amt·rit:an pcopk that it is necessary to secure "peace ami freedom." and so hegins the Viet­nam oftht· HOs. 
Why docs Reagan want war with Nicaragua? Because Nicaragua serves as an example to otht·r Central American countries of the suc­n·ssful overthrow ofa i>.~Hhkss dictator.

As a mt·ans of justification. Reagan's myopic world vkw has placed Nicaragua in the con­tt·xt of East-\\'t·st hostilities, allowing him to ignore that the very popular Sandinista govcrnmt·nt has provided Nicaraguans with land, education. health care, and political lihnties they never knew under the l'.S.­hackcd Somoza dictatorship. 
Why is it that some of our "friends," like South Africa and Chile, arc two of the worst non-democratic abusers of human rights, while: our "enemy" (Nicaragua) is a popular government that docs not have to employ repression for its support? 
As supposed intelligent and informed stu­dents, we should he concerned about what our government is doing in Central America. l'nless we speak out in opposition to Reagan's policies nou•. we will have only oursdl't'S to blame for the war against Nicaragua. 
Students on this campus should he outraged over Reagan's Central American policies. If we fail to voice our dissent, we c_·an only blame ourselves for the cscal.ing violt·nce in Nicaragua.

"Tht.·rt.· 01rc: just so many inconsis­tt.·rKks," said Notre: D01me coach Sandy Vanslagc:r. "The passing is in­consistt.·nt. as well a.' tht.· movement around tht.· court. tht.· dc:fc:nse, the hlot.·king. !he hilling. and olhc:r lhings.

Againsl Evansville, Notre Dame did no! start the game with its bcSI play 01nd the Aces were able: 10 take early control of the match. They lOok advantage of Irish mistakes to win 1he first game: easily. Things got tougher in !he: second game a' the Irish hegan to play hellcr; however, the Aces still wok another win to put NOire: lhme deep in the hok. 
"We: just were not able to execute our skills properly," said Vanslager. "It was one of the key things we focused on going into the third game -just work on execution." 
The execution did improve: in that game: ao; the: Irish held off an Evansville: hid for a sweep. The momentum nmtinued early in the fourth g<~me a\ the Irish took an early lc:ad. llowever, the Aces fought hack to take: the lt:ad. Notre Dame then lost its serve when there wa' some confusion about who was supposed to serve. The Irish lost some momentum and the Aces won the gamt.· and match. 
"When we get oursc:lves under prc:ssure, we kind offreak out on the court," explained Vanslager. "E motions take control and the girls

Carew not selected 
Evans picked first in re-entry draft 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK -Darrell Evans, the San Francisco Giants free-agent in­fielder, was thc: No. I pick yesterday in baseball's re-emry draft. being 
couldn't capitalizt' when the Pamhers made thdr kw 
mistakes. Tht' Irish missed numerous tackles, droppt'd 
numerous ·passes, and playc:d likc: a very nervous, very 
hesilant team. (The players even admined a~ much.) 
Thc:y didn't dest'rve to win. 
In fact, when was tht' last lime Notre Dame made a 
successful goal-lint' stand in any game, or came from far 
behind to win a game. 
Thert' is only one way to describe how the the Irish 
pt:rformed against Pill and againsl lht' other teams I 
mentiont'd. 
They choked. 

The question is. "Why?" I mean, hasn't it been the 
mark of Notre Dame to win !he big ones? 
I wish I knew the answer, hut il seems 10 me thai the 
problem doesn't reflect the characters of the in­
dividuals on the team. Rather. the character oftht' tt"am 
a~ a whole is poor. The team cannot win a game wht'n it 
ha~ to -at leas! not yet, anyway. 
A lot of tht' blame ha~ 10 res! on the coach who is 
responsible for his squad's pcrformancc: on tht' field. 
There is some rea\on thai the team gets uptighl and 
loses confidc:nce on tht' field. The fact rhat the coach 
becomes uptight, c:motional, and indecisive on the 
sidelinc:s is probably the reason. Therefore, unlc:ss some 
player can come along and bring the: dc:cisivenc:ss and 
nmfidence on to !he field, there will cominue to be 
problems. Right now. thc:re is nobody who can do this.

Something ha~ gol to change. 
For the Ia'! lhrt·e years. we have been !Old by expc:rts 
!hal Notre Dame should he among the top teams in the 
nation. But il ha~n·t happened. l!'s not like: the team 
ha~n·r had the chance. Each year, there has been at lc:a~l 
one game thai could turn things around. Each time, the 
team has failc:d. 

One day Notre Dame will win !he game that turns things around. hut il's hard to say wht>n that will hap­pen. Maybe this week at Pc:nn State. Now that a Fiesta Bowl bid is allegedly riding on the: outcome, it is a "must-win" game. 
Most Notre Dame football history is marked by big wins and great respect. That is beginning to change. The students have bc:en disappointed many times and bounced back. One day, though, they will not rc:bound. Hopefully, it will not come to !hat point. 
chosen by I 7 teams in a selc:ction 
procc:ss that several dubs said was 
becoming less important to building 
a winner. 
"The Baltimore Orioles had a lol 
to do with !his," New York Yankc:es' 
Gc:neral Manager Murray Cook said. 
"Their winning lhc: American 
Lc:aguc: pennant had a profound ef. 
feet on the: approach of a lot of 
teams. Thc:y're going morc: wilh 
tht:ir farm syslem and away from 
free agency." 
The Yankees. a recelll big-dealer 
in the free-agenl market, made only 
one selection in the frc:c-agc:nt draft. 
Thai was Evans, whom they pickc:d 
in the second round. 
In fact, 29 of the 4 5 available: free: 
agents were pickc:d by fc:wc:r than 
four tc:ams, meaning they can 
negotiate with any team they wan!. 
"We arc: approaching !he free­
agent markt:l no differently than we 
have in the past," said General 
Managc:r Hank Pelers of the Orioles, 
who won the World Serit-s wilh 
their time-proven mix of 
homegrown talent and par­
simonious trade acquisitions. "We 
will adhc:re to our policy. which has 
heeq very consistent We have no 
magic formula." 
The Orioles selected negotiating 
rights to seven players, including 
Evans. 

The Nc:w York Mc:ts and Min­nesota Twins did not pkk anyone, passing in the first two rounds, which automatically eliminaled them from !he draft. 
"People: have had had ex­periences wilh frc:e agems," said Mets Gc:nc:ral Manager Frank Cas­hen. "I guess overall only !he Yankees have prospt:red. Our fans have suffered with us while: we were developing a team for yc:ars. I see no reason to make cosmetic changes now." 
After Evans, the next lwo most 
popular picks in the draft were: relief 

pitchers. Kem Tekulve of the Pins­
burgh Pirates was chosen by 12 
teams, and Rkh Gossage of the 

Yankees was selc:ctc:d II times. The 
Pirates and Yankees each retained 

the right to negotiate with Tekulve 
and Gossage, respectively, a!! did San 
Francisco with Evans. 

Agent Jerry Kapstein ofSan Diego represents 1wo of rhe t<Jf) three picks. Evans and Gossage. Kapstein said nt:ither player had expressed a dc:sirc: to he with a specific dub, and neither had rulc:d out the possibility ofreturning to his former dub. 
Kapstein and Cook each said reports that Gossage would not return to the Yankees unless owner George Steinbrenner fired Manager Billy Martin were untrue. 
"In our meeting a wec:k ago Mon­day in San Diego," Kapstc:in said. "the first thing Steinbrenner said before our discussion was, 'I want you to know that I have told everyone that at no time ha' either Gossagc: or Kapslc:in demanded tht.· firing of Martin and, as a matter of faa. at no time has Kapsrcin c:ver criticized Martin."' 
Cook said, "Sure they (Gossage and Martin) have had their disagree­mc:nts, hut we're hoping they can he resolvt'd. Neirhcr Goose (Gossage) nor his agent has ever asked !hat Hil­ly he fired." 

Two players, pitcher Dan Schat­zeder of Montreal and firs! haseman-outfidder Dennis Wallin~ of Houston, were chosen by eight teams. Six players --pitchers Jerry Koosman of the Chicago White Sox, Frank LaCorte of Houston, Lary Sorensen ofCleveland, and Milt Wil­cox of Detroit; outfielder Oscar Gamble of the Yankees, and utilityman Derrdl Thomas of Los Angeles -wc:rc chosen by seven teams. 
Thomas was one of only lwo players whose: nc:gotiating rights were not retained by his formc:r dub. The othn was outfidder Gene Rkhards ofSan Diego. 
In a move rhat might signal the breaking of anolher precedent, the California Angels retained the rights to !heir free agent, Rod Carew. And, il appeared, rhc Angels might be the only dub interested in the: .38-year­old seven-time American League hatting champion since he was not selected by any dub in thc: draft. 
Some other top names also rect:ivcd lillie attention. Infielder Manny Trillo of Montreal was selected only once. and outfielder Dave Parker of Pittsburgh and catcher Ted Simmons of Milwaukee were picked by only two teams each. 
"I think dubs arc getting more selectfve." San Diego General Mam..~T Jack McKeon said. "They'rc: look~ for players who fit spt:cific nc:eds. They're not drafting a Carew for Carew's sake. They're looking dec:per into tht:ir plans and finding !he one or two guys thai can make them a winner." 
"It's not a grab hag anymore."
