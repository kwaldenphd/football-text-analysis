HPC hears plans for student-faculty interaction 
By KRISTIN COLLIGAN 
News Staff 
Professor Tom Schwartz and Father David Tyson an­nounced plans to better in­tegrate the academic and res­idential lives of Notre Dame students at the Hall Presidents' Council meeting Tuesday night. 
Tyson, vice president of stu­dent affairs, explained that the administration would like to achieve the "goal of the better­ment of student life" through programs to develop residen­tial life. 
To help achieve this goal the College of Arts and Letters has appointed Schwartz to the newly-created position of Col­lege Fellow. This position is de­signed "to enrich the undergraduate life of the on-campus Notre Dame student" through student-faculty inter­action. 
Schwartz described a Hall Fellow's program which would involve each dorm working with six or seven faculty mem­bers from any of the colleges of the University on a regular basis. 
Activities would be up to the dorms, but Schwartz suggested that dorms could sponsor infor­mal discussions, seminars, lec­tures or social events with fac­ulty members. "The College would like to get the faculty and students in touch with each other," Schwartz said. 
Tyson urged participation in the Hall Fellow's program and expressed the intentions of the Office of Student Affairs to "ex­pand residentiality over the en­tire campus." 
Another effort to "bridge the gap between student and aca­demic life" is being undertaken by the Alcohol Task Force. Tyson said the task force is cur­rently investigating the effect of alcohol on the "wellness and health of the Notre Dame com­munity." 
Tyson emphasized that the Alcohol Task Force is not a

Appreciate the Mestrovic masterpieces in our midst 
I couldn't help but feel Ivan Mestrovic's ghost hovering over Notre Dame when I first visited Kim the campus some four years ago. 
I had listened to Mestrovic stories from as Vuratovac long as I could remember. The artist was born in my grandparents' Croatian homeland to par-Assistant Accent Editor ents who instilled within him a love of God and country that he translated into a lifetime of art, much of which he shared with Notre Dame. 

Mestrovic is an artist whom Rodin called "the greatest phenomenon amongst sculptors." He is honored and respected all over the world for his religious and nationalistic art. But there are Notre Dame students living in the midst of the largest American Mestrovic collection who  don't even know who Mestrovic is. 
.m-I~IW""l1~ 
"Maestro," as he was called during his tenure at Notre Dame, was a short but strong, bearded man with deep, black eyes. His Slavic work ethic kept him working long, intense days. "I long ago vowed that I would work up to my last day," Mestrovic had vowed. He was working in his Snite studio on the January day in 1962 when he died. 
"Maestro" was enticed by then Notre Dame President Father Theodore Hesburgh to leave Syracuse University and come to Notre Dame in 1955. 
Mestrovic had already been a legend in the international art scene. In 1915, he became the first living artist to be honored with an exhibiton at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, and in 1947, he repeated his success, breaking monly referred to as the fountains in front of a seventy-five year tradition by having his ex­O'Shaughnessy Hall, is one of the most visible hibition run at the Metropolitan Museum of Art of Mestrovic's Notre Dame works.

Candygrams and bazaar 
Stock prices make tentative rise 

planned by SMC board 
Associated Press of about 29 points shortly after remains a lack of confidence, 
both in the market itself after 
last week's $500 billion collapse 
and in the ability of the White 
House and Congress to trim the 
federal budget deficit. 
"Until we get something 
really concrete (on the 
budget), people are going to be 
doubtful," said Ralph Acam­
pora, an analyst with Kidder 
Peabody & Co. He warned, 
"The market will wait for no 
man." 
In Washington, President 
Reagan and congressional 
leaders were optimistic 
negotiations would result in a 
plan to cut the deficit. Reagan 
said Tuesday the stock market 
plunge "has alerted us of po­
tential dangers on the eco­
nomic horizon." 
It was a lack of trust that 
caused prices to slip from their 
early gains Tuesday, the 
analysts said. 
"There has to be some light at the end of the tunnel or some confidence that the markets will stabilize," said Hugh Johnson, a senior vice presi­dent with First Albany Corp. 
The shift from bonds to stocks caused bond prices to drop sharply, with the Trea­sury's 30-year issue off about $18.75 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction of its price, jumped to 9.07 percent, from

The Task Force will be hold­ing forums in several residen­tial halls the week of November 9th to the 15th. 
Student Body President Pat Cooke, a member of the Alcohol Task Fm·ce, encouraged stu­dents to attend these meetings, stating "we want to get input from a wide cross-section of people." 
The Student Union Board an­nounced plans for the upcom­ing Navy game. 
The students are all being asked to wear green for the game, and each room will receive a poster of the Leprec­haun for their window. The SUB asks that everyone dis­play the posters to show alumni the Notre Dame school spirit.

Stark mentioned that the in­cident was ironic when just the week before he had said in Blue and Gold Illustrated, "The Leprechaun this year has a profound respect for Notre Dame and NO ONE is going to embarass the Leprechaun in Notre Dame stadium or anywhere else. There is no sacrifice too great when Notre Dame pride is on the line." 
The Leprechaun believed that he sacrificed no quarter to the cadets and in doing so preserved the pride of The Fightin' Irish. 
Stark claimed, "The bottom line is that the cheerleaders and team lived up to the pride and spirit of Notre Dame. After all, we won."

Saint Mary's Board of 
Governance opened its 
meeting Tuesday night on a 
festive note, with the discus­
sion of Halloween can­
dygrams and the annual 
Christmas Bazaar. 
Vice-president Smith Has­
hagen said that Student Gov­
ernment will sponsor a can­
dygram sale today and 
Thursday. The candygrams 
cost fifty cents each and will 
be delivered on to students 
at both Saint Mary's and 
Notre Dame on Thursday 
and Friday. 
Hashagen added, "It's 
really a nice thing to do for 
your friends, for a small 
price. We hope you all take 
advantage of it, and encour­
age your friends as well." 
The annual Christmas Bazaar, chaired by Mary Carol Cahill, is still in the planning stages. The event is slated to run from Dec. 7 through Dec.ll, and will fea­ture the sale of a variety of holiday treats and gift ideas. 
The Board il! also planning a Pool Party which will take place in the Regina Hall Pool. Planned are kick­board races, diving for pennies, and a belly-flop contest. 
In other business, a Gripe Night is planned for Sunday, Nov. 1. This will give stu­dents an opportunity to ex­press their opinions and complaints to represen­tatives of the Board of Governance. 
A table will be set up at the sundae bar during the dinner hour. 

NEW YORK -Stock prices rose $37 billion on Wall Street Tuesday as earlier gains in Asian and European markets encouraged investors to shift some money back into the jit­tery stock market. 
The Dow Jones industrial average, which on Monday lost nearly 157 points in its second­worst point decline ever, reversed course and rose 52.56 points to 1,846.49. 
Nine stocks rose for every eight that fell in price. 
Euphoria from higher prices in Tokyo and Hong Kong sparked a quick rally in New York, sending the Dow average soaring nearly 90 points in early trading. 
But traders chipped away at the advance as the day wore on, selling stocks that had made gains during the mor­ning. The Dow slipped to a gain noon before regaining ground later. 
The rush of money out of stocks and into bonds slowed on Tuesday, with some money heading back into equities, breaking a trend that had helped depress stock prices since the devastating 508-point drop in the Dow on Oct. 19. 
Another factor pushing the Dow higher was an announce­ment by International Business Machines that it would spend an additional $1 billion to buy back its own stock. IBM, one of the 30 companies in the Dow average, rose $6.50 a share to $118.50. 
The market paid scant atten­tion to news from Washington that orders to factories for "big ticket" durable goods rose 1.1 percent in September, the first increase since June. 
The biggest problem facing Wall Street, analysts said,

Insurance bill to pass 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -The Senate worked toward passage Tues­day of a catastrophic health in­surance bill to protect America's elderly against the devastating costs of serious ill­ness. 
Debate leading to votes on a handful of amendments and the bill itself came after weeks of behind-the-scenes negotiations that gained White House sup­port for a compromise version that closely tracks basic provi­sions of House-passed legisla­tion, but contains important cost-containment provisions for a new prescription drug benefit. 
That administration support -coupled with the already wide bipartisan backing for the mea­sure -assured eventual pas­sage. 
However, Senate rules allow­ing unlimited debate left uncer­tain when the floor vote would come on the measure, which was approved unanimously by the Senate Finance Committee last summer. 
Moreover, differences be­tween the House and Senate versions made inevitable the need for a conference commit­tee to work out final details. 
But the eventual parameters of the basic benefit and financ­ing package that eventually will emerge from those House­Senate negotiations -as well as the virtual certainty that some legislation will be passed and signed by President Reagan ­came into focus with word that the administration supports the compromise.

Scientists promised freedom 
Associated Press 
BEIJING -Chinese leaders are determined to uphold intel­lectual freedom and increase financial rewards to scientists who are needed to modernize the nation, a government offi­cial said Tuesday. 
Song Jian, the minister for science and technology, spoke at a news conference for the approximately 400 foreign and Chinese reporters gathered to cover the first Chinese Commu­nist Party congress in five years. 
The beginning of the news conference was briefly dis­rupted by the arrival of a reporter from Taiwan, the fourth to defy his government's ban on travel to the mainland. 
Congress meetings have been closed since the opening session Sunday, and the official media issued only sketchy reports on the activities of the nearly 2,000 delegates inside the Great Hall of the People. 
The Xinhua News Agency said delegates began Tuesday to approve lists of candidates for the new 209-seat party Central Committee, which gen­erally meets annually to set policy. 
The congress and Central Committtee meeting are ex­pected to replace aging, con­servative officials with younger, development-minded technocrats who recognize the need to stabilize policies toward intellectuals. 
Song was asked repeatedly how China can expect its scien­tists to work for national devel-

MBA school forum I will be held today 
By JENNIFER GRONER News Staff 
Representatives from 46 MBA schools will be available to speak to students about the programs at their respective schools at the annual MBA Mini-Forum sponsored by Career and Placement Ser­vices. The forum is planned as an informal, informational day and will be held Thursday from 12 to 4 p.m. at the Center for Continuing Education, said Jeff Rice, assistant director of Career and Placement Ser­vices. 
Students of all majors who are considering MBA school or who want to get more informa­tion on this alternative are en­couraged to attend. 
"Most MBA schools are highly selective," said Rice, "however, they are looking for individuals with the talent to successfully complete their program, not a student of a spe­cific major."

Iraq: Iranian tanker raided 
Associated Press 
KUWAIT -Iraq said its warplanes raided a tanker in Iranian waters Tuesday night in the campaign to destroy the oil exports that finance its enemy's war effort. 
A brief military communique issued in Baghdad said the planes attacked a "large naval target off the Iranian coast," the customary reference to a tanker, shortly after 7 p.m. It did not identify the vessel and shipping sources in the Persian Gulf could not confirm the claim immediately. 
In Kuwait, which has been hit recently by three Iranian mis­siles and a terrorist bombing, an official was quoted as saying civilians will be trained to help defend the sheikdom. 
Preventing attacks by Iranian-trained saboteurs ap­pears to be the plan's main ob­jective. Iran, which has been at war with Iraq since Septem­ber 1980, accuses Kuwait of supporting its adversary. 
The 13th convoy of Navy ships and U.S.-registered Kuwaiti tankers moved up the gulf Tuesday to the home anchorage, where three Silkworm missiles fired in a week hit two tankers and a major oil-loading facility. 
Shipping officials in Kuwait said the convoy was in the central gulf but did not know its precise position. An official of the state-run Kuwait Oil Tanker Co. said: "we will not comment on tanker move­ments." 
Iraq said earlier in the day that its air force made a "suc­cessful and effective raid" on the Agha Jari oil field in south­western Iran. Iran said one plane was shot down. 
Reagan administration offi­cials in Washington said that, despite China's denial of arms deals with Iran, a shipload of Chinese-made artillery shells

Hussein Musavi, the Iranian prime minister, said in Tehran that his country's economy will not be affected by a ban on U.S. imports of Iranian goods that President Reagan ordered Monday. Reagan also prohibited some exports to Iran because of "continued and in­creasingly bellicose behavior of the Iranian government.". 
Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency, moni­tored in Cyprus, quoted Musavi as saying: "Reagan's act is an­other stunt and a futile bid to save his lost dignity both inside and outside the United States."

Riot police in downtown Seoul battled protesters who urged voters to boycott the ref­erendum. Police said about 40 demonstrators were arrested. 
In another political develop­
ment Wednesday, Kim Dae­
Jung formally split the South 
Korean opposition by announc­
ing his candidacy for president. 
Election officials declared 
the referendum approved early 
Wednesday. The approval rate 
was 93 percent with nearly all 
the ballots counted; only a 
simple majority was needed. 
Officials said 80 percent of 
the country's 25.6 million eligi­
ble voters cast ballots. 
The constitution reduces the 
power of the presidency and in­
creases the authority of the 
legislature and the judiciary. 
President Chun Doo-Hwan, who took power with military backing in 1980, bowed to oppo­sition demands for reforms in July and announced that he would step down when his term ends Feb. 25. 
In addition to Kim Dae-Jung, vying for the presidenc.'J b'tl! rival ~vusWIOn leader Kim ~~ oung-Sam, government can­didate Roh Tae-Woo and former prime minister Kim Jong-Pil are campaigning to succeed Chun. 
Kim Dae-Jung told reporters 
he had no choice but to run be­
cause of the expectations of his 
followers. "I have confirmed 
that the overwhelming 
majority of our people support 
me enthusiastically," he said. 
Opposition supporters had been trying to get Kim Dae­Jung and Kim Young-Sam, the RDP president, to keep their earlier promises that just one of them would run, but they both refused to abandon their presidential ambitions. 
The opposition fears the can­didacies of the two Kims will split the opposition vote during the mid-December election and boost the chances of Roh. 
South Korean newspapers announced the referendum results in banner headlines in Wednesday editions. News reports said the government would accept the constitution Friday after final vote tabula­tions.

Making economic sense of market chaos 

Almost everyone is thinking and won­dering about last week's stock market crash. Economists are supposed to have explanations. I am learning eco­nomics but my understanding comes mainly from gut feelings I've been car­rying around ever since the Reagan revolution began. We use a great deal of common sense in making economic decisions in our personal lives. Why can't we apply that same common sense to national economics? Let me attempt to draw a few parallels here. 
David Carrier 
guest column 
Consider for a minute personal 
finances. The most basic reality is that 
we never seem to have enough money. 
So we're forced to make some hard 
choices. We might spend it all on one 
thing. B!Jt we have many n~eds an~ 
wants, making it -mOTe St!nsibfe-to 
spread it around, satisfying as many of 
!hem as possi~le. If we put it all in one 
Item and that Item falls out the window, 
we won't be very happy. 
We can increase our limit by borrow­ing, if the banker is confident we can pay it back. If we can't, there will be a great deal more interest to pay, and that cuts into spending on other things we'd rather have. Whenyoucan'trepay right away, one good way is to pay tui­tion. It's making an investment, one that enhances competitiveness and pro­ductivity, and therefore the ability to pay back loans and otherwise make a contribution to society. However, if someone were to use an educational loan to buy beer or a car and could not pay for tuition, we'd think he or she made a serious error of judgement. In fact, we would predict a dim future for that individual when he or she had to drop out of school. 
Reaganomics has been a nightmarish combination of the above bad choices-­all for the sake of a good party. 
First, President Reagan refused to acknowledge there was a limit to what we could spend. A government has the option of printing money, but that's in­flationary. So he borrowed heavily while cutting taxes, figuring new in­vestment would carry the day. To top it off, he did this during a recovery, normally a time when one would pay old debts and stash a bit of a surplus. He l.fl-'adrqoled spending in six years, exceeding the amou1Tt d .debt incurred 
Doonesbury 

by all previous administrations com­bined. A substantial portion of it was financed by foreigners whose confi­dence or political sympathies could change at any time. They could take it all home again tomorrow. 
The budget and trade deficits are only part of the story. Like the prodigal student, once we had the money we made a serious error of judgement and spent it in a very ridiculous way. Huge segments of the population never saw any of it. Ask people in the middle or lower economic classes, or who are living in the geographical area between the two coasts whether or not they felt the Reagan recovery. Farmers, factory and service workers, women, and minorities hav~ an seen layoffs, declin­ing wages, imd nroken dreams. Who really recovered? 
Think about it. 

At the consumption end, wealth ended up in the hands of the already wealthv. They bought Mer -'~ ' (no~ 
--eacfifla""csfstockS~rier expensive real estate, stock~, overse~s bank ac­counts and vacation homes, trips to Paris, and still more stocks. Had we spread it around, it might have had a better multiplier effect, benefitting many more individuals and communit­ies here at home. But we spent it in large clumps on people who already had more than they could use effective­ly. Too much of it went overseas and into the stock market. Then one day a half-trillion dollars fell out of the win­dow. Whoops! How about the government part of the equation? Some spend their money on education, health, job creation, public transportation, infrastructure, research on foreign markets and new products, and facilitation of exports. In this way they cooperate with industry and people in a way that enhances pro­ductivity and therefore, their competi­tive edge in the world. The U.S., on the other hand, has seen an erosion of this type of support. In­stead, we've spent it all on what Pres­ident Eisenhower thought was the single greatest threat to our national security--the military-industrial com­plex. Nothing has a greater capacity for sucking wealth from the economy. The diversion of resources includes re­search, scientists, technology, and whole industries in addition to invest­ment. And it has a few very expensive toys to show for it all. Do you know anyone with an X-ray laser? Would you know how to use one? Star Wars doesn't

In contrast, infrastructure such as a subway system serves many people and businesses for many years. It employs many workers in its construc­tion, maintenance, and operations. We can dig miles of tunnels and lay as much track for what it costs to build a B-1 bomber. We can even use the sub­way and feel good about it! 
What about our ability to repay the debt that financed it all? The largest portion of that debt is interest pay­ments. As we curtail spending, that percentage will increase exponentially and little will remain for other things. Since we've made miniscule contribu­tions to productivity, our ability to make money hasn't increased along with the .debt.

When I look at what corpo~ons financial markets have an awareness of underlying weaknesses in the eco­nomy that they're responding to. They see overvalued stocks, uncompetitive­ness in the face of a huge trade deficit, and declining productivity concurrent with the largest budget deficit ever. They see an impending flight of for­eigner's dollar holdings if our currency devalues further. They'd like to see something done about it, and instead we have a president who denies anyth­ing is wrong and continues to spend on the most inefficient industry in America.

I see nothing but fattened executive salaries and mergers and takeovers.

They know they've neglected investments in tangible capital and human assets in favor of paper acquisitions. It's no wonder they've demonstrated such a lack of confidence in continued growth. 
Why did the stock market crash? In­flation, high interest rates, and the threat of war in the Middle East are merely triggers. We've seen them before and they did not produce a crash, much less a depression. We've even seen budget and trade deficits before. So I don't believe this "correction" nec­essarily signals impending doom. I hope it doesn't have to come to that.

Pap~-ealth has a very scary prop­erty. When you set a match to it, it goes up in flames. Last Monday the match was lit. We might be able to put it out 
with drastic reductions in spending and by making tangible contributions to our productive strength and competitive­ness. If we don't solve these problems, maybe we'll be able to borrow or hy­perinflate our way out, no one really knows. 
We do know what could happen if we go on as if nothing's wrong, as they did in 1929. History will very likely repeat itself--because we failed to learn from it.

statement and experimentation are woven throughout the lyrics of these twelve new tracks by the English trio. Unbelievably, the listener Is not completely lost as the songs unfold and run away and come back. 
Yes this album Is typical Love and Rockets, but It Is Important to understand that what Is typi­cal of this fantastic band Is atypical of the music world. Consider these lyrics: "When you're up, it's a long way down. When you're down, it's a long way up." 

MARK NEMEC accent writer 
D
ef Leppard's lead singer :.Joe Elliot stated last night. "In the Immortal words of Robert Plant. 'It's been a long time since we rocked and rolled."' Truer words were never spoken. 
When last seen, this band was riding high on their Pyromania album and tour. After the auto accident of drummer Rick Allen and the subsequent amputation of his left arm, however, the band fell on hard times. Now, after three years, Def Leppard Is back with their new album Hysteria, and the tour rocked and rolled Into the ACC last night. 
Hysteria, a one hour compila­tion of twelve new songs, has come under flre by some crit­Ics, including myself, as being too mellow and mainstream. During the entire 90-minute concert. however, they sang only five of their new songs. And the crowd did not mind one bit. 
Opening band Tesla took the stage at exactly 7:.30, a surprise to everyone, and started the night well. This band from northern California is one to watch for the future. They have a no glitz, ail guts style to their music; and for a

During this song, entitled "No New Tale To Tell," David J sings these words in such a way that their powerful meaning isn't stressed. In a unique move, the band leaves it to the listener to delve Into the nuances and shadowed depths of the song by himself. Thus, the meanings become very individual and personal for each listener. This is true artis­tic expression and It shows. 
For those who aren't fanatics already, here's a little history of Love and Rockets. In the begin­ning there was Bauhaus: four members, many albums, and much popularity and influence In England and worldwide. Then, in 198.3, there was a breakup, and from the debris of Bauhaus emerged Tones On Tali. 
The music of Tones On Tail was a little weirder than Bauhaus, but In the same dark and moody vein. In 1984 Tones On Tail produced The Album Pop, which was really a culmination for the band. It contained their huge club and cult hit "Gol". 

The Tones On Tail banoproject eventually drifted off, and in 1985 a new group released an import album strangely titled Seventh Dream of Teenage Heaven. This new group was Love and Rockets. Its members had been the core of Bauhaus and Tones On Tail all along, so another collabora­tion was almost guaranteed and certainly welcomed. 
David J on vocals and bass, Daniel Ash on vocals and guitar, and Kevin Haskins on drums produced a magnificent "debut" as Love and Rockets. Songs like "Haunted When the Minutes Drag," "A Private Fu­ture," and "Bali of Confusion" (available on the first press­ings) are virtual masterpieces of acoustics and vocals working together to create different moods. Calmness, frenzy, and crashes are all present on this first album. The lyrics are quite Incredible as well. 
The year 1986 brought a domestic contract with Big Time Records In the U.S., and Express, the second release for L&R. This album was more pop, and seemed a little un­seriously either, as the cut finished, but was still way "Lazy" shows. The first single ahead of most other bands that Is "No New Tale To Tell," and It year. "All In My Mind" was the rocks out. The video Is unique first single and was less acous­and a little bizarre, but so Is tic and more upbeat. Some this band. Other choice cuts to critics claimed that the band hear are "Mirror People" and had sold out. but now Earth­"Waiting For the Flood."

new band, they sounded sharp. This band has much potential, and with time and experience, they could be one of rock's top acts. They used the in-the­round format well for forty-five minutes straight and got the crowd rocking. 
After a thirty-five minute in­termission, the lights dimmed, and Clint Eastwood's famous "Do you feel lucky" speech boomed through the speakers. Def Leppard took the stage to "Stage Fright" and "Rock, Rock til You Drop", both from Pyromania. They slowed it down a bit with "Women" the first song off Hysteria, then went back to the old with "Hit and Run" and "Too Late for Love." 
The next song up was the title track "Hysteria," accompa­nied by an incredible laser show that looked awesome off the dome of the ACC. The lasers kept blazing through the next three songs, "Gods of War", "Die Hard the Hunter", and an extended version of their old classic "Bringing on

The last set started with "Foolin," continued with the new "Animal" and, for the food fanatic, "Pour Some Sugar on Me." It ended with "Let It Go" and an extended version of "Rock of Ages". 
The concert flowed very smoothly, and even after a three year hiatus, Def Leppard still has what it takes to bring a crowd to Its feet. Elliot can still belt out those high notes, and guitarists Phil Collen and Steve Clark. along with bassist Rick Savage, sounded Incredible. 
But the effort was most evi­dent In Allen, who, with only one arm. never missed a beat. He performed with three snare pedals at his left fool a bass pedal at his right fool and . cymbals and more drums for his right hand. 
The band ended with 'Photograph" and "Good Golly Miss Molly" as an encore. Here's hoping Def Leppard puts as much energy Into their next album as they did on stage last night.

Irish move to ninth; top six unchanged in AP Poll 
Associated Press 
The Notre Dame football team jumped one place in the Associated Press College Poll, moving from tenth to ninth after Saturday's victory over Southern Cal. 
The top six teams remained the same in this week's poll, while Michigan fell out for the second time in three weeks.

Notre Dame's two races over break, the Indiana Intercol­legiates and a dual meet against USC, served to in­\!rease the team's optimism en­tering the Districts. 
At the Intercollegiates on Saturday the 16th, the Irish finish ·d just 10 points behind Indiana for second place. Steady senior Dan Garrett once again paced the Irish with a second place finish. 
Notre Dame placed two other runners, Ron Markezich and votes and 1,176 of a possible 1,200 points from a nationwide panel of sports writers and sportscasters. 

Nebraska, a 56-3 winner over Kansas State, received 13 first­place votes and 1,134 points while the other seven first­place ballots went to Miami of Florida, which defeated Cin­cinnati 48-10 and totaled 1,108. 
Oklahoma, Nebraska and 
Miami are ranked 1-2-3 for the 
fifth week in a row. Last week, 
Mike O'Conner, in the top five, and were in a position to win the meet. But a large -too large -gap between the Irish fourth and fifth place finishers, however, allowed Indiana to slip through for the victory. 
"If our fifth man (Mike Smoron) could have stayed with our fourth man (Pat Kearns) , " said Irish Coach Joe Piane, "then we could have beaten Indiana, and that's en­couraging. We're improving every week."

"We ran really well," Ryan 
said. "It was a good team ef­
fort." 
Saying the Irish had· a good 
team effort was, perhaps, an 
understatement. With top run­
ner Theresa Rice having a 
somewhat off day, the rest of 
the team picked up the slack. 
Ryan had been looking for con­
sistency, and he got it at this 
meet. 
Senior co-captain Julia 
Merkel finished ninth with a 
time of 18:27, followed by Jenny 
Ledrick in the 13th spot at 
18:34. Rice came in 15th with a 
18:40 clocking, followed by Kathleen Lehman in 23rd and Linda Filar in 27th. Other Irish harriers were Wendy Murray in 40th place and Terese Lemanski in 47th. The top three Irish runners took second, third, and fourth in the small school division. 
"We only had 46 seconds be­
tween first and fifth place," 
Ryan said. "We came back and 
were able to beat Ball State 
(who beat the Irish at the Notre 
Dame Invitational earlier this 
season). The team is beginning 
to peak and are all running 
good times." 
The third-place finish 
showed just how far the cross 
country program has come in 
just two years of existence. The 
individual performances along 
with the team results continue 
to improve with each meet. 
"Our fifth-place time this 
year was as good as the first­
place time two years ago," 
Ryan said. "I think it was a 
good step for the program. A 
lot of teams are now beginning 
to take us seriously. We're 
coming on stronger than last 
year at this time." 
The harriers couldn't have 
picked a better time to peak 
with the North Star Conference 
Meet and the NCAA Districts 
looming on the horizon. The 
reasons for the improvement 
are simple. 
Rice has emerged as one of the top runners in the district, while the veteran Merkel con­tinues to improve on her times and finishes at a time when she could be looking to the future. Ledrick, only a freshman, has been a model of consistency at the No.2 spot. Lehman remams steady in the No. 4 position while Filar, Murray and Lemanski push each other to better times while fighting for the final spot.

Ryan thinks the Irish can make good showings in both upcom­ing meets. 
"I don't think we've had one week where we've had a solid performance from the top five," he said. "One of these meets all five will click. We've had minor injuries and nagging injuries here and there."

SMC tennis wins District tourney 
By HEATHER ATKINSON Sports Writer 
The Saint Mary's tennis team completed its fall season by winning the District Tourna­ment held in Anderson, IN last weekend. 
Thirteen teams competed, and for every match won, they received one point. The Belles finished with a score of 38 points, followed by DePauw with 30 and St. Francis with 18. As the champions, Saint Mary's will advance to the na­tional tournament, which will be held in Kansas City in May. 
"I'm really excited we won," said Head Coach Debbie Laverie. "I thought it would be really close between us and DePauw." 
In the singles finals, the Belles defeated all of the DePauw players whom they had never beaten before. These proved to be very big wins for the team. 
Freshman Sarah Mayer won the number two singles over her St. Francis opponent, 6-4, 4-6, 6-2. 
"As a freshman, she's done an outstanding job all year. We can always count on her," said Laverie. "She beat players this weekend who had a lot more collegiate experience than her, and she showed a lot of heart and desire to win." 


Sophomore Jane Schnell won 
the number six singles, defeat­
ing a DePauw player 6-2. 7-5. 
"Jane wasn't in the starting 
line-up last year, but has 
worked hard all summer and 
has won a lot of matches for 
us," said Laverie. "Her hard 
work has become a real contri­
buting factor for the team." 
Other Saint Mary's singles 
players who were victorious 
were Buffy Heinz winning (7-5, 
6-3) and Mary Turk (6-3, 6-2), 
both defeating players from 
DePauw. 
In doubles, Charlene Szajko 
and Mayer and teammates 
Turk and Schnell won their 
matches. 
"Both girls have had a lot of physical problems throughout the season but have showed a lot of determination and have never let themselves get down mentally," said Laverie. 
The duo of Heinz and Jennifer Block were defeated but gained points which helped the team to win the tournament.

The Sugar, Fiesta and Citrus bowl games each had represen­tatives at the Southern Cal game Saturday and are other possible New Year's Day sites. Scouts from the Gator, Liberty, Freedom, Hall of Fame, Peach, Sun and Bluebonnet bowls also were in the press box to observe the Irish. 
Absent from what Peach Bowl representative Harvey Robertson called 'the mecca' was a scout from the Aloha Bowl, site of Notre Dame's last postseason bowl game, and 27­20 loss to SMU, in 1984 under then-coach Gerry Faust. Rumor has it they were visiting the University of Akron.

The team tumbled off cloud nine two days later with a frustrating 2-0 loss to the Uni­versity of Maryland-Baltimore County. "Our only disappoint­ment over break was Maryland," said Lindenfeld. "We had 39 shots on goal and never scored." 
Back on their home turf Sat­urday, Notre Dame regained enough form to beat Calvin 1-0 and revenge an annoying loss from last year. 
Marshall scored the lone goal three minutes into the first half on a play off a penalty corner. The corner was taken by Janet Budnick and stopped dead for Marshall's shot by McGlinn. The Irish were unable to score again despite taking 30 shots on Calvin's goal and having 7 more penalty corners. 
"We outplayed them with some excellent execution, but we should have scored more and we had some problems defensively," said a somewhat disappointed Lindenfeld. 
Currently sporting a 7-5-2 record, the Irish have several chances left to perform with the momentum they displayed over fall break. They travel to Springfield, Missouri at the end of this week to play Southwest Missouri on Friday and South­ern Illinois-Carbondale on Sun­day.

Bowl reps have eyes for the Irish 
It's corning soon to a stadium near you. Real near you. Like at the corner of Dorr and Juniper Roads. 
It's called the Bowl Bid Derby and in fact it has already started. On Saturday no less than 18 rep­resentatives from 12 postseason Bowl games carne to Notre Dame Stadium to watch the lOth-ranked Irish run past Southern Cal and improve their record to 5-l. They'll be here again this Saturday, and the two weekends after that. 
In case the bright suitcoats don't give them away, the bowl emblem patch on the coat's pocket will. 
VVhile all of these representatives would tell you that it is much too early for any commitments, 'tis the season for the bowl bid derby to heat up. Auto­matic bids to conference champions will be decided in the next few weeks as conference rivals do battle, and major independents like Florida State, Miami, Notre Dame and Syracuse (yes, Syracuse) are all vying for their moment in the sun on January 1. 
Or January 2, like last year's "dream game" of Penn State and Miami for the national champion­ship in the Fiesta Bowl. This coup d'etat over the traditional Big Four bowl games (Rose, Sugar, Cot­ton and Orange) gave rnunchkin bowls a gleam of hope to nab top contenders for the national title, and thus large television market shares, but not without forking over millions of dollars. 
So where does this put Notre Dame, which did not play in bowl games from 1925 (when a Rose Bowl win brou ht the Irish their first-ever national championship) to 1970 (when Texas beat Notre Dame in the Cotton Bowl for the No. 1 ranking)? 

As evidenced by a premature No.4 ranking a few weeks ago, national pollsters and bowl officials ap­pear just as ready for Notre Dame to regain its spot among the football elite as the Irish fans are. VVith the national attention Notre Dame football garners, television ratings and fan interest would be high for a 10-1, or even 9-2, Irish squad in a New Year's Day bowl.

Irish Items 
Officials from the Cotton Bowl, where Notre Dame last secured a national championship in 1977, have said that they would even be interested if the Irish went 8-3, but probably would not invite any other team with a similiar mark. 
The 100th anniversary of Notre Dame football, leading Heisman candidate Tim Brown, and the charisma of head coach Lou Holtz all make the Irish a sought-after unit among bowl officials, as evidenced by the 18 men in bright coats and patches Saturday. 
So let's take a moment to peer into the crystal ball, which is anything but crystal clear. 
The Rose Bowl is out of course, reserved for the Big Ten and Pac-10, neither of which has a solid favorite to go to Pasadena, nor a true contender for the national title. 
The Orange Bowl could be this year's version of the Fiesta Bowl, bringing No. 1 and No.2 together for a championship clash. Oklahoma and Nebraska, which have both seemed peerless to date, are on course to crash head-on November 21, with the win­ner getting the Big 8's bid to the Orange Bowl and loser going to another major bowl. 
Should the Irish continue their winning ways against Navy, BC, Alabama and Penn State, the other spot in that Orange Bowl rnatchup would most likely be contingent on the winner of the Miami­Notre Dame game on November 28. Bowl bids will be officially extended November 21. 
VVith one bid committed to the winner of the South­west Conference, the Cotton Bowl could be looking at the Irish; it's just a matter if Notre Dame is looking back. The SVVC is struggling this year, and 3-3 Texas leads the conference thus far. Last week's AP Top 20 listed no teams from the most inves­tigated conference in football, the first time no Southwest Conference team appeared in the poll since 1967.
