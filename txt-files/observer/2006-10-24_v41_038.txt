Liquor law violations prompt action Saturday; police also uncover counterfeit football tickets 
By KATE ANTONACCI 
News Editor 
Police ejected 29 people from Notre Dame Stadium for alcohol related violations during Saturday's home football game against UClA 
Two people were also arrested at the stadium -an adult for public intoxication and a student "for allegedly punching another student in the face and causing an injury," Associate Director of Notre Dame Security/Police (NDSP) Phil Johnson said in an e­mail Monday. 
Twenty-three arrest tickets were issued to adults for viola­tions of liquor laws and four tick­ets were issued to juveniles for the same violation outside the stadium, Johnson said. 
Police made seven custodial arrests outside the stadium ­two for public intoxication, two for violation of liquor laws and public intoxication, two for liquor law violations, false informing and resisting law enforcement and one for liquor violation, false informing and possession of mar­ijuana and drug paraphernalia, Johnson said. 
One juvenile was arrested for selling counterfeit tickets and was brought to the county juvenile justice center. Three other warn­ings were issued for "re-selling tickets on campus," Johnson said. 
Arrested offenders were trans­ported to St. Joseph County Jail, Johnson said. 
Two people were sent to area hospitals by ambulance due to

pledged to the University. 
"The inspiration [for the dona­tion] was the school being in need," Naimoli said. "If it helps our programs in any small way, I'd be happy with that. ... If there's one thing we can do to honor [former Executive Vice President Father Ned Joyce's] memory, we wanted to do it." 
White said the Naimoli gift would be earmarked for the planned 16,000 square-foot sta­dium club and hospitality area, which will be tied to approxi­mately 800 seats at the south end of the arena.

Students positive 
after narrow Win 
By PATRICK CASSIDY 
News Writer 
Students who returned early from fall break for the Notre Dame-UCLA game Saturday witnessed a nail-biting win that brought the Fighting Irish record to 6-1. 
Even without their starting quarterback, the 4-2 UCLA Bruins still put a serious scare into the Irish and their fist­pumping fans. With just 27 sec­onds remaining, Notre Dame was down 17-13. 
"[UCLA's defense] was very impressive," junior Brian Camus said. "It's a little discon­certing after the last couple games that our offense hasn't been able to kick it into full gear." 
Despite the solid UCLA defense, the Irish were able to drive the ball inside the 35­yard line with 2:25 remaining. But the team's hopes seemed to be dashed when Notre Dame quarterback Brady Quinn failed to reach a first down on his fourth QB sneak of the drive. Many students, however,

Company improves service over fall break 
By EILEEN DUFFY 
Assistant News Editor 
Plagued by delays through­out the summer and fall, the University's plan to improve cellular telephone service was finally completed over fall break when Verizon opti­mized its service on campus. 
Both Cingular and Verizon entered into agreements with the University last spring to begin an antenna­installment project during the summer. 
The project's goal, said Gordon Wishon. chief infor­mation officer for the Office of Information Technologies, was to provide enhanced cell phone service on campus by the first home football game. Cingular achieved the goal in September, but because Verizon lacked the equip­ment to connect the campus antennas to its nationwide network, it lagged behind its rival, Wishon said. 
Verizon had 'Originally expected the equipment to arrive after football season, but the company made some changes, Wishon said. 
"They expedited the deliv­ery of that equipment, in order to get it in before the UCLA game," he said. "They were successful in getting it installed, in place, and oper­ational. So, in fact, the cus­tomers of Verizon on campus should now be enjoying much-improved service."

GuluWalk unites Uganda, ND 
By LAURA BODEIN 
News Writer 

About 30,000 people in more than 80 cities and 15 countries mobilized Sunday for GuluWalk Day, an event organized to sup­port the abandoned children in northern Uganda -and nearly 150 of those walkers hailed from Notre Dame and the South Bend community. 
Walkers braved the cold and rain to walk from the Potawatomi Zoo to the gymnasium of Indiana University of South Bend, a co­sponsor of the event, to promote peace in war-torn northern Uganda. 
"It is amazing that a group of individuals living in a fairly small part of northern Indiana could come together so eagerly in glob­al solidarity," said senior Nicole Steele, part of the event's organiz­ing committee. 
Part of the mission of senior Lindsay Hero and her GuluWalk committee was to raise aware­ness of the terrible human tragedy occurring in Northern Uganda, said senior Patrick Corrigan, president of Notre Dame's Uganda Conflict" Action Network. 
"The humanitarian conse­quences of the conflict between the rebel forces and the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) have been tragic," he said. 
Each day, as many as 40,000 children walk from villages and Internal Displaced Persons Camps (IDCP) into the town of Gulu, where they spend the night in safety and away from the threat of being abducted by the LRA. The GuluWalk, organizers said, is intended to be a symbolic effort showing worldwide solidar­ity and support for these children. 
The peace talks between the LRA and the Ugandan govern­ment are at a critical stage, and GuluWalk participants worldwide were encouraged to make a pub­lic statement in support of this process. 
"With 20 walks in Canada, 44 in the United States and events in Australia, Burkina Faso, China, England, France, Italy, Kenya, Netherlands, New Zealand, Serbia and Togo, it's clear that this is not a fringe issue but one that citizens from every corner of

Fantasy fix

I nave two papers to Greg Arbogast work on and 
a test to 
Sports Writer 

study for, and the study abroad deadline is approaching faster than I'd like to admit, yet I can't tear myself away from the television and my lap­top. Why? Two words: fantasy football. 
Who needs to study for Professor Brady's exam when Tom Brady is in the red zone against the Bills? 
The great thing is that I'm not the only one currently obsessed with fan­tasy football, and that's a good thing. Right? I mean, 18 million Americans can't be wrong. A couple more quick stats for you: the number of fantasy football participants is currently grow­ing at a rate of seven to 10 percent on top of the 18 million people who already enjoy spending their Sundays in front of 10 televisions at a sports bar. Even more impressively, fantasy football currently generates an eco­nomic impact of close to $4 billion dol­lars. That would make up about 1/5 of the GDP of Tanzania. 
Here's my question. Why does America love fantasy football so much? Is it the bragging rights you get to hold over your friends for an entire year? The fact that the typical sports fan thinks he knows more than most NFL coaches usually leads to some pretty heated debates, and fantasy football provides the perfect proving ground for inflated sports egos. 
Nothing gives quite the same satis­faction as watching your seventh round pick turn into your leading receiver followed by a well deserved "I told you so" to all those who jeered you on draft day. 
There's just something about being the GM of your own football team. For those who live vicariously through sports, it's the closest they'll ever get to sitting in a luxury suite during games and negotiating with multi-mil­lionares. 
Apparently, fantasy football leagues have picked ·up on this with the addi­tion of "keeper leagues." Keeper leagues span the course of multiple seasons, allowing you to hold on to a specified number of players from year to year followed by a draft for new players at the beginning of each sea­son. That's about as close to managing a real team as you can get. 
Plus, having your own fantasy foot­ball team allows you to watch games as never before. It's the 49ers versus the Raiders on an early December Sunday. I'm riveted. No seriously. I have Frank Gore and Randy Moss on my fantasy team. If nothing else, hav­ing a fantasy team increases the chance that you'll have a reason to watch the network games in your area. 
Whatever the reason, Americans ­myself included-are hooked on fan­tasy football. I think that you have to worry about the negative effects of this, like the aforementioned neglect of school work ... wait, hold on. The Jets are in the red zone. I got to go watch.

Fried Coke is a big hit 
CHICAGO -Fried Coke has become the latest artery-clogging hit at state fairs, local media reports. 
The gooey Coke-battered nuggets topped with cola syrup won the "most cre­ative" title at the Texas state fair in Dallas last month. Since then, the deep-fried phenomenon has spread to North Carolina and Arizona. 
"We've been getting calls from everywhere since we introduced it," Elizabeth Martin, a spokeswoman for the North Carolina fair, told the Dallas Morning News. "Everyone wants to know where they can get it." 
Fried treats are as big of a draw at state fairs as the rides and prize-winning farm animals. Twinkies, cookies and even pickles are stuck with a stick, dipped in batter and then seared in the deep fryer. 
Boston breaks pumpkin record 
BOSTON -Boston's nickname is Beantown, but Pumpkintown might also apply now. 
Bostonians on Saturday lit 30,128 pumpkins on Boston Common, shatter­ing the world record for the most jack-o'-lanterns lit in one place. 
"It's fantastic," said Jim Laughlin, a spokesman for Life is Good, the Boston clothing company that sponsored the event. "We've been going after this record for a long time." 
The old record of 28,952 lit pumpkins had been held since 2003 by Keene, 
N.H. That city tried to keep up with their own attempt Saturday, but lit only 24,682 pumpkins.

Protestant, Catholic meet in Belfast 
BELFAST, Northern Ireland -Northern Ireland's dominant Protestant leader, who has long denounced the Roman Catholic Church as corrupt and heretical, held talks Monday for the first time with the leader of the church in Ireland. 
Ian Paisley's meeting with Archbishop Sean Brady, leader of Ireland's 4 million Catholics, was timed to signal Paisley's willingness to work with Catholics on the eve of negotiations to revive power-sharing in Northern Ireland, the central goal of the Good Friday peace accord of 1998. 
Britain and Ireland, which are leading three days of multiparty negotiations starting Wednesday in Scotland, have given the Northern Ireland Assembly a Nov. 24 deadline to elect a Catholic-Protestant administration or be shut down.

KABUL, Afghanistan-A helicopter crash that killed 10 U.S. troops last May was caused by a series of mishaps, a new report concluded. Problems included a nighttime landing on a small mountaintop zone, trees that were too close to the runway and soldiers who lacked axes to cut them down. 
Maj. Matt Hackathorn, a military spokesman at the U.S. base at Bagram, north of Kabul, said on Monday that the May crash came "as a very hard lesson" in the difficulties of flying in Afghanistan. 
The CH-47 Chinook-a large transport heli­copter with two overhead rotors -had such a small landing zone that only its two rear wheels could touch down, while its front two wheels hovered off the mountain's side, the report from the Accident Investigation Division of the U.S. Army Combat Readiness Center found.

ANCHORAGE-In Alaska's native villages, the punishing winter cold is already coming through the walls of the lightly insulated ply­wood homes, many of the villagers are desper­ately poor, and heating-oil prices are among the highest in the nation. 
And yet a few villages are refusing free heat­ing oil from Venezuela, on the patriotic princi­ple that no foreigner has the right to call their president "the devil." 
The heating oil is being offered by the petro­leum company controlled by Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, President Bush's nemesis. While scores of Alaska's Eskimo and Indian villages say they have no choice but to accept, others would rather suffer.

"Please don't make me do this," he was quoted as telling administrators before police arrested him and thwarted what they called a "well thought-out plan" to terrorize his school.

Shiite militia hunts down police 
Anti-American cleric's loyals re-emerge in south; 4 killed in rival militia violence 
Associated Press 
BAGHDAD -Militiamen loyal to an anti-American cleric re-emerged Monday in the southern city of Amarah, hunting down and killing four policemen from a rival militia in a brutal Shiite-on­Shiite settling of scores. 
The Iraqi army set up a few roadblocks but did not interfere in the movement of Muqtada al-Sadr's Mahdi Army fighters after police fled the streets. The latest attacks came despite a pub­lic call by al-Sadr to halt the tribal vendetta, suggesting that splinter groups were developing within his militia.

IN BRIEF 
Stocks rise despite geopolitical termoil NEW YORK -Stocks rose slightly Monday, with the Dow Jones industrial average briefly touching a new intraday trading high, after the 
U.N. Security Council condemned North Korea over its claim of an underground nuclear test. 
Wall Street had opened the session lower after North Korea announced it had set off an atomic weapon underground. Reports that OPEC was near announcing its first output cut in two years sent oil prices higher. But stock prices turned mixed by midday and were high­er by early afternoon. 
"We are heartened by the fact the market seems to be shrugging off a major geopolitical event," said Jim Russell, director of core equity strategy for Fifth-Third Asset Management in Cincinnati. which manages $22 billion. 
But Russell added that because of the Columbus Day holiday, volume was too light to say the day's trading represented a trend or theme. 
Bond investors knock down rates 
NEW YOHK -The bond market's rally in recent months looks to be the work of a new generation of "vigilantes" who have turned the notion of holding the Federal Reserve's feet to the fire on its head. 
Back in the 1980s and early 1990s, these investors took matters into their own hands when they felt the Fed wasn't doing enough to fight inflation. By selling bonds, they pushed rates on things like 30-year Treasury bonds high enough to slow the economy in the hopes of warding off the stinging effect of higher prices. The Fed eventually followed suit by increasing overnight rates. 
This go-around, a new class of bond investors seem to be working the opposite way. They are knocking down rates of Treasury securities in what amounts to an audacious gamble that Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke and his col­leagues soon will have to reverse course and cut short-term borrowing rates to avoid a recession. 
As some on Wall Street have pointed out, this change in tactics may have something to do with who manages money these days: Hedge funds and other speculators play an ever-larg­er role in the bond market and the pressures they face to show outsized returns are intense. 

Google in deal to buy You Tube 
Internet leader dismissing copyright concerns to obtain video-sharing company 
Associated Press 

SAN FRANCISCO 
Internet search leader 
Google is snapping up 
YouTube for $1.65 billion, 
brushing aside copyright 
concerns to seize a starring 
role in the online video rev­
olution. 

The all-stock deal

came just a few hours after 
YouTube unveiled three 
separate agreements with 
media companies to count­

The price makes YouTube Inc., a still-unprofitable startup, by far the most expensive purchase made by Google during its eight­year histor_y. Last year, Google spent $130.5 million buying a total of 15 small companies. 
Although some cynics have questioned YouTube's staying power, Google is betting that the popular video-sharing site will pro­vide it an increasingly lucrative marketing hub as more viewers and advertis­ers migrate from television to the Internet.

Airbus chief resigns after short stint 
Associated Press 

PARIS -Airbus chief executive Christian Streiff resigned Monday after a little more than three months as head of the troubled European plane maker and parent company EADS named one of its own co-CEOs to replace him. 
European Aeronautic Defence and Space Co. said in a statement Louis Gallais will succeed Streiff in the top job at Airbus while continu­ing in his current role as joint head of the Franco-German defense group. 
Streif"s departure deals a fresh 
blow to crisis-hit Airbus. The planemaker, which stunned investors in June by doubling the A380's production delay to one year, doubled it again this month to two years and said the holdups would wipe $6.1 billion off EADS profits over four years. 
Streiff took over as Airbus CEO just over three months ago, replac­ing Gustav Humbert -who was ousted along with EADS co-CEO Noel Forgeard as a result of the A380 production crisis. 
EADS didn't say in the release announcing Streiff's resignation why he was leaving. 
In an interview for Tuesday's edi­tion of the French daily Le Figaro, Streiff said he had not been allowed the "necessary operational powers" to do the job effectively and welcomed as "a step in the right direction" the combination of the Airbus and EADS roles. 
Streiff, a 52-year-old former Saint-Gobain executive, drew up a cost-cutting turnaround plan for Airbus that enjoyed strong support from EADS directors, but he clashed repeatedly with the board over how the plan should be imple­mented and how much control he would personally exercise, accord­ing to three officials familiar with the discussions.

Donation

and former chief executive offi­cer of Morgan Stanley, who donated $12.5 million to the project. 
"By having an opportunity to kind of talk about [this donation] publicly, it may get other [poten­tial donors] to emulate, and it does build and create momen­tum," White said. "And there's no question that's occurring." 
While remaining optimistic, White once again noted that con..'ltruction -expected to take about one year -cannot begin until 100 percent of the needed donations have been pledged and the University has 75 per­cent of that cash on hand.

the globe want to see their govern­ments engage in," the GuluWalk Web site reads. 
Hero visited Uganda over the summer, and it was this visit, she said, that inspired her to take on the challenge of organizing the citywide walk. 
"The hard work paid ofT. It was really a community effort," Hero said. "The majority of walkers were from Penn High School and Marian High School, but we had people drive in from Michigan and students from Taylor University in southern Indiana a<; well as mem­bers of the South Bend corumuni­ty." 

Through donations and the sale of GuluWalk T-shirts, hats and wristbands, local participants raised nearly $2,500, I Iero said. 
Hero led a rally after the walk in the IUSB gymnasium. 
Steele spent the summer work­ing in Uganda and reealled a des­perate plea made to her by the director of an Internal Displaced Persons Camp (IDCP) in the dty of Gulu: "We are here. We are suf­fering. We arc suffering. We are dying, don't forget us." 
"Over 90 percent of the popula­tion lives in these eamps," Steele said. "There is little sanitation, lim­ited medical supplies, and they are 100 percent dependent on ouL'lide food. In one camp they have 26,000 people in a 50-meter radius." 
Organizers urged the walkers to take action and pressure the U.S. government to pay attention to the issues of Uganda. 
"One of the main goals of the Gulu Walk this year was to pro­mote the support of peace talks occurring right now and to walk in solidarity with the night com­muters," Steele said. 
Other speeches included the reading of testimonials written by aetual night commuters who walk eight to 10 miles from IDP camps to city centers to avoid kidnapping. If captured, the young men are generally forced to become sol­diers and are often forced to kill people in their own families or vil­lages, Corrigan said. The young women are often given to military officers for pleasure and may be tortured. 
Putting a l'aee to the stories 
about the struggles in Uganda, the event organizers brought in a 15­year-old Ugandan refugee named Evaline. 
"She helped realize the real human eonsequences," Corrigan said. 
Evaline, who now lives in Fort Wayne, Ind., was captured by the LRA and held captive for three years, suffering from inhumane forms of torture. Permanently dis­figured after breaking her lower jaw when hit by flying shrapnel in a firefight, she has already had three facial operations. 
The original GuluWalk began in July 2005 with just two people. Rapidly, it has grown into a world­wide peace movement.

The University officially announced its plan to renovate the Joyce Center in a press con­ference Oct. 5. White's announcement Friday did not elaborate on the plan.<; or fund­ing for the renovations, other than identifying the Naimoli family as the second largest donor for the project. 
"We're still trying to put together the last $3 million of funding, and we're working at that as we speak," White said. "[Associate athletic director] Bill Scholl and everyone else in development is working at that all the time." 
The plan to renovate the Joyce Center began in early 2001 when White started designing his "master plan" for athletic facilities on campus. 
At the time, he had architec­tural firm HNTB study the arena and begin developing plans for a renovation. Five years and $22 million later, HNTB is still the University's architect for the project. 
"The [Development Office has] been working on this since we had HNTB start the study back five years ago," White said. "These public disclosals are really important [for acquiring the final donors]." 
The new design is an attempt to update and revitalize an arena that hosts more than 350 events a year. Former Notre Dame athletic director and for­mer NCAA President Gene Corrigan said Friday that plans like this one can be successful. 
"My feeling is that the most important thing is that [facilities] are practical," Corrigan said. "If you look at Duke, they're one of the top five overall programs in the country ... and they're still playing on the same basketball court they were playing on when I was in the 40s, but they fixed it up. It's a lot nicer than it was." 
The project will be the first major renovation of the 38­year-old basketball arena. The last significant addition to the Joyce Center was the 1985 con­struction of the Rolfs Aquatic Center. 
The construction will reno­vate both the interior and exte­rior of the south side of the Joyce Center, benefiting both the basketball and volleyball pro­grams. 
Purcell Pavilion will replace the 5,500 bleacher seats in the upper bowl of the south dome with blue chair-back seats. That change will reduce the maxi­mum arena capacity from 11,418 to approximately 9,800. 
The new arena will also fea­ture an exterior extension -a "dramatic entrance" -at the south end of the stadium, cur­rently Gate 11. That addition will include a 4,500 square-foot ticket office and 3,000 square­foot retail store.

Officials continue to search for 9I 11 ren1ains 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK -As the city agency overseeing the removal of the World Trade Center rubble was wrapping up its work in 2002, several officials handling the painstaking recovery of human remains warned that things were moving too fast. 
They believed that more pieces of the 2,749 dead could be found, and that the city shouldn't be rushing such an important task. But they were overruled, two of those officials told The Associated Press this week. 
Over the past few days, dozens of bones have been discovered in underground passages at ground zero, more than five years after the tragedy. 
"I knew that this was going to happen -they really just wanted us out of there," said retired Lt. John McArdle, the Police Department's ground zero com­mander. "There was not a good exit strategy for some of these places, and if there was, it was poorly done." 
A utility crew stumbled upon body parts last week in an aban­doned manhole along the edge of the site, and forensic experts have since dug down and found more than 100 bones and fragments from skulls, ribs, arms, legs, feet and hands. 
The discoveries have angered and saddened relatives of the Sept:11 victims. Of the 2,7 49 peo­ple who were killed that day, the remains of some 1,150 have not been found. That means that families of 40 percent of the vic­tims have nothing -not a sliver of a bone -left of their loved ones. 
"The desire was driven by one thing, and that was, 'Get it done,"' said another official who protest­ed, speaking to the AP on condi­tion of anonymity because he is not authorized to discuss the work publicly. "Many a time the issue was raised about how fast it was going and things were being missed." · 
Deputy Mayor Ed Skyler, who is overseeing the renewed search, said a review of such issues would be premature, but noted that the Fire Department was designated as the lead agency for finding remains, and that the design department proceeded with its work only when the FDNY gave the go-ahead. 
After the twin 110-story towers collapsed, police and fire officials led the backbreaking search for bodies while the Department of Design and Construction was assigned to excavate the debris, which stood 10 stories high at the start. The agency, staffed by engi­neers, architects and construction professionals, specializes in engi­neering and construction proj­ects, including emergency debris removal. 
Each day, the design depart­ment convened planning meet­ings with all the parties involved, including engineers, emergency responders and a range of other city agencies. 
The project finished months ahead of city officials' yearlong prediction, and cost about $750 million -just a fraction of the initial multibillion-dollar estimate. But the design department was sometimes at odds with the res­cue workers, who frequently needed to shut down or pause the operation as they recovered bod­ies. 
"It went from a rescue to a recovery to a construction proj­ect," McArdle said. "There came a point in time when they said, 'We gotta try to wrap this up,' and they tried to expedite it as much as possible, and they jumped the gun, and now you have all of these families hurt and they're finding all these body parts." 
Particular disagreements arose as the design department was preparing to turn over the site _ which belongs to the bistate agency known as the Port Authority. According to people involved in the process, the design department had created a grid map and asked those leading the remains recovery to walk through each area, and sign off, square by square. 
Matthew Monahan, department spokesman, said the intent of that correspondence did not deal with human remains specifically, but rather the agency's overall effort to clean up the site and eliminate safety hazards in preparation for turning it over the Port Authority. 
A powerwashing would not necessarily have reached the 12 subterranean cavities now being opened and picked through this week by teams of forensic anthro­pologists. But Skyler said there may be many more underground areas to examine. 
All involved agencies have also been asked to go back and recall how and when they inspected the buildings on the site's outskirts. Hundreds of bone fragments were recently found on the roof of a skyscraper that had been closed since the attack. 
None of the newly unearthed bones has been identified, but the medical examiner's office has DNA profiles of the victims on file and is working to match the remains. Thousands of the 20,000 pieces recovered during the main excavation still have not yielded matches. 
Mayor Michael Bloomberg said Monday that the cleanup was "a heroic job ... by people who really dedicated themselves -firefight­ers who had lost sons and broth­ers, construction workers who worked in difficult conditions where they had lots of heavy machinery and there was a lot of pressure to do things quickly." 
He added: "And I think, on bal­ance, they did a magnificent job." 
CNN criticized for airing video 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -A leading Republican lawmaker on defense issues has asked the Pentagon to bar CNN reporters from traveling with military units in Iraq because the net­work showed insurgent snipers shooting at U.S. troops. 
"Does CNN want America to win this thing?" Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., asked in an interview Monday on the net­work. In past wars, he said, the press was more pro-American. 
CNN issued a statement say­ing the decision to air the insur­gents' video was "a difficult one, but for a news organiza­tion, the right one. Our respon­sibility is to report the news." 
In a letter released Monday, Hunter asked Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld to yank CNN from the military embedding program, in which journalists spend time with combat units in Iraq. 
Hunter, a staunch defender of the Bush administration and its handling of the war in Iraq, said the decision was irrespon­sible because it could encour­age more attacks on U.S. troops. 
"CNN has now served as the publicist for an enemy propa­ganda film featuring the killing of an American soldier," wrote Hunter, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee. California Republican Reps. Darrell Issa and Brian Bilbray also signed the letter. 
CNN last week aired the footage, which was delivered through a contact with an insurgent leader. 
The footage does not show the actual death or wounding of any service member. In one instance, the tape shows a serv­ice member milling around a public area. A shot rings out, and the tape fades to black.

Hastert aide testifies before panel 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -The House ethics committee questioned Speaker Dennis Hastert's top aide for more than six hours Monday, as investigators tried to deter­mine whether Hastert's office knew at least three years ago of Rep. Mark Foley's come-ons to male pages. 
The closed-door testimony by Hastert chief of staff Scott Palmer could help determine who is telling the truth about when the speaker's office first learned of Foley's conduct. Hastert has said it was in the fall of 2005. 
Campaigning for a Republican candidate in Tennessee, Hastert said he plans to testify before the committee this week. 
"What Mark Foley did was wrong. It was ethically wrong. It's a shame. It's actually disgust­ing," Hastert told reporters after a campaign rally. 
In Washington, Palmer's lawyer, Scott Fredericksen, said his client hasn't changed his ver­sion of events. The Hastert aide has disputed one account that he personally was notified about Foley in 2002 or 2003. 
Fredericksen said the testimo­ny was "consistent with the posi­tion he's taken all along." 
Palmer spent the longest time in the committee oflices than any other witness, entering at 1:57 
p.m. and leaving at 8:18 p.m. This is the third week of testimo­ny, as the committee tries to learn how the Republican leader­ship handled Foley's inappropri­ate conduct. 
The speaker has a lot riding on the outcome. He has fended off calls for his resignation with statements that his staff acted properly after the 2005 notifica­tion, and quickly had a lawmaker and the House chief clerk con­front the Florida Republican. 

Hastert said he didn't learn about Foley until late September, when the scandal became public and Foley resigned. 
The speaker's timeline could be shattered if the committee believes former Foley chief of staff Kirk Fordham, who already has testified before the ethics panel. Fordham has said publicly that he told Palmer about Foley in 2002 or 2003, and subsequent­ly learned that Palmer spoke with Foley on the subject. 
"What Kirk Fordham said did not happen," Palmer said weeks ago in his lone public statement on the matter. 
Hastert's version, issued as an internal report, said his staff learned in the fall of 2005 that Foley had sent overly friendly e­mails to a former Louisiana page. The report said the staff did not see the texts of thee-mails, which asked about the 16-year-old's birthday a11d requested a picture. 
The report said the speaker's oflice contacted then-chief clerk Jeff Trandahl, who went to con­front Foley with Hep. John Shimkus, H-Ill. and chairman of the board that oversees the page program. They ordered Foley to immediately stop communicating with the youngster. 
The report added that nobody in Hastert's ollice knew, until the messages became public, that Foley also had sent sexually explicit instant messages to other former pages. 
Ironically, the internal report did not mention any role played by Palmer, despite his status as Hastert's top assistant. 
The speaker has left himself one major escape route, publicly pledging to lire any or his staff members who were found to have covered up knowledge of Foley's conduct. 
Hastert also has said he doesn't recall discussing Foley's conduct with Hep. Tom Heynolds, R-N.Y., the House Hepublican campaign chairman; or Majority Leader John Boehner, H-Ohio, both of whom said they told 1-Iastert about Foley earlier this year. 
Boehner testified before the committee last week and Heynolds was expected to be questioned Tuesday. 
Before Palmer testified, Reynolds' top politieal aide, Sally Vastola, appeared before the committee as it began a third week of closed-door testimony. Vastola is executive director of the National Hepublican Congressional Committee and a longtime top aide to Heynolds. 
Vastola's testimony could touch on how Heynolds reaeted when learning of problems with Foley's behavior toward pages and with whom Heynolds may have shared the inf{Jrmation. 
Testimony from I Iastert's aides would go a long way toward wrapping up the interviews niquired for the panel to make its findings, though it's unclear whether the panel will have enough time to issue a report befom Election Day.The commit­tee, evenly divided between the parties, could issue an interim report 'by Election Day.

Accident kills 1 1n eastern Pa. coalinine 
Associated Press 
TREMONT, Pa. -A coal mine accident, possibly an explosion, killed a miner Monday, but five others escaped, authorities said. 
The incident happened 2,300 feet underground at the H&D Coal Co. anthraeite mine in Schuylkill County, about 80 
miles  northwest  of  
Philadelphia.  
The  victim  was  Dale  

Heightl'er, 43, of Donaldson, according to his brother-in-law Charles Kimmel. Heightler, who had worked the mines since age 16, had a wife and four children, and dreamed of set­ting up an auto repair business, Kimmel said. 
"He was gonna give it up and go into auto repair full time," Kimmel said. "I guess that ain't gonna happnn." 
State and federal investiga­tors were trying to determine the eause of the aeeident, the state Department of Environmental Protection said. Regulators ordered the mine closed until an investigation is complete. 
State police initially said the accident was an explosion. However, other state officials were more cautious, saying it was too dangerous to go down into the mine shaft to investi­gate because the incident knocked out t.he mine's ventila­tion system. They hoped to have it restored Tuesday. 
"Right now, it's a mining acci­dent, a fatal mine accident, and that's what we're terming it until the investigation con­cludes," said Mark Carmon, a DEP spokesman. 
The five miners who escaped were being interviewed, Carmon said. 
The mine is in a remote, mountainous region in eastern Pennsylvania. A June inspec­tion turned up no violations, while an August inspection found brush surrounding an exhaust fan that was cleared while the inspeetor was on site, according to state officials. 
Four workers at the mine were injured Dec. 1, 2004, by debris from an explosion caused by a pipe with a faulty gauge, state ollicials said. The mine reopened after installing safety equipment, and two inspections this year turned up no signifieant violations, the­state agency said. 
The area has the nation's only deposits of anthracite, a type of hard, relatively clean­burning coal that once heated millions of homes but now rep­resents a tiny sliver of the U.S. coal industry. The mines still operating are typically small, with only a few miners. 
So far this year, there have been 41 other deaths in U.S. coal-mine accidents, none in Pennsylvania. In the deadliest accident, 12 men were killed at the Sago Mine in northern West Virginia in January.

Wis. college to-wn struggles -with student dro-wnings 
After 8 deaths in La Crosse in 9 years, concerns grow about intoxicated partiers falling into three local rivers 

Associated Press 
LA CROSSE, Wis. -Searchers combing the Mississippi River this month pulled out the body of University of Wisconsin-La Crosse basketball player Luke Homan -the eighth college-age man in nine years to disappear from a city tavern and turn up dead in a river. 
La Crosse officials have debat­ed for years how to keep drunk­en students safe, but some say there may be no answer for a town with three colleges, three rivers and $3 pitchers of beer. 
''I'm not sure anything we do can prevent a future tragedy," Mayor Mark Johnsrud said. 
Some officials want to rein in the binge drinking culture. Others have proposed fencing off the scenic waterfront. 
But solutions have so far elud­ed this community where drownings and drinking have claimed lives for years. The city's first recorded alcohol­related drowning was in 1867, according to the mayor. 
The more recent string of 
deaths began in July 1997, when searchers pulled 19-year­old Richard Hlavaty's body from the Mississippi River near a park. College wrestler Jared Dion became the seventh drowning victim in 2004 when his body turned up in the same park. 
The community is saturated with thousands of students attending the University of Wisconsin's La Crosse campus, as well as Viterbo University and Western Wisconsin Technical College. Downtown bars cater to young drinkers, offering booze at dirt-cheap prices. 
The Vibe, where Homan was last seen alive, offers an all-you­can-drink special for $5. Shots are just $1. A sign in the bar's window proclaims: "You're not drunk if you can lie on the floor without holding on." 
Down the street, Brothers offers bottles of beer for a buck on Wednesdays. The Helm boasts 50-cent schnapps and $3 pitchers from midnight to 1:30 a.m.

The community has a long tradition of drinking. Thousands of people converge on La Crosse every fall for its Oktoberfest, a day-long party with abundant beer. And on days when the wind blows just right, the smells of City Brewery waft through downtown. 
"The problem is the culture is already up on a pedestal in this town," said University of Wisconsin-La Crosse senior Cathy Long. 
The city also lies where the Black and La Crosse rivers empty into the Mississippi. Hemmed in by rugged bluffs, LaCrosse is well-known for its scenery. 
But the waterfront can be deadly. Investigators believe Dion fell off a levee that doubles as a pedestrian walkway and a dock for visiting paddlewheel boats. The levee had no railing, allowing him to tumble 10 feet into the frigid Mississippi. 
His death brought to a head years of fears that a serial killer was stalking drunks. Police held a town meeting to reassure peo­ple, explaining that none of the victims was attacked. Investigators said the students had been drinking heavily and noted that Riverside Park is just two blocks from downtown bars. 
A task force appointed to investigate the drownings made 19 recommendations ranging from building gates to the levee to creating alternative forms of entertainment and limiting Oktoberfest to one weekend. 
But only a handful of those suggestions were adopted, including police patrols of house parties and an extra police shift to patrol bars. 
Over time, the focus on drownings faded, Alderwoman Andrea Richmond said. 
"Everybody kind of let it drop," she said. "We've done nothing." 
Searchers found Homan's body Oct. 2, not far from where Dion was discovered. Preliminary toxicology reports put Homan's blood-alcohol level at 0.32 percent, four times the legal limit in Wisconsin. 
Joe Werner, 22, a senior on the University of Wisconsin­Lacrosse basketball team, com­pared Homan's death to losing a brother. 
"They need to do something more down by the river," Werner said. "If enough would have been done, it wouldn't have happened again." 
Students have taken it upon themselves to patrol the park since Homan's death, but resi­dents are calling for some kind of barrier. 
But the mayor does not want fences or gates to mar Riverside Park's natural beauty or send a message that La Crosse is a "playground" for binge drinkers. 
His solution: Spend $60,000 on motion-activated lights in the park to startle drunks and alert them they are close to the water. The City Council is set to consid­er the lights in November. 
Meanwhile, the mayor said, community groups need to keep warning students about the dan­gers of binge drinking, he said. 
"It's a behavior issue," he said. "People are going to do what they want to do." 
Mary Torstveit, assistant director of prevention services at the University of Wisconsin­La Crosse, said students living off-campus are largely on their own.

As college students, most of us have taken classes or participated in activities which open our eyes to previously unknown issues. Notre Dame students are very blessed to have the opportunity to go to school here and have been given tremendous advan­tages as we start our lives. The combination of education and resources (particularly time) that college stu­dents possess leads many to commit them­selves to rectifying the widespread injustices which we find in the world around us. There is a definite temptation, which I have experienced myself and witnessed in others, to view a social/political agenda as the path towards renewal, but the Christian faith which is integral to Notre Dame points instead to individual change as the surest method of improving our world. 
Progressives and conservatives hold two very different blueprints for the con­struction of a better, brighter society. As far as I understand it, progressives believe that people are, for the most part, good and can be relied upon to do the right thing in the absence of overwhelm­ing external pressures. Progressivism's objective is to restructure the institutions and culture of our society in order to remove those ancient obstacles which hinder the flowering of mankind's natural goodness. 
In general, conservatives believe that we cannot be counted on to make the right choices all the time, and that we are all capable of, and prone to, committing evil acts. Based on this belief, the goal of conservatism is to encourage spiritual transformation and virtue and build and preserve social institutions and traditions which help foster individual enlighten­ment. 

Conservatism and progressivism have great numbers of followers, and barring mass deception or blind adherence, there must be elements of both which are true and yet not contradictory. At a university like Notre Dame, it is particularly useful to look to our faith for insight in finding the truth in all things. As the living Truth, Christ cannot be pigeonholed as an ideo­logue of any stripe, and on the question of the nature of mankind He is quite clear. 
In Mark 10:18, Jesus says to the rich young ruler, "Why do you call Me good? No one is good except God alone." Christ builds on this in Mark 7:20, when he states, "Far from within, out of the heart of men, proceed the evil thoughts, forni­cations, thefts, murders, adulteries, deeds of coveting and wickedness, as well as deceit, sensuality, envy, pride and foolish­ness. All these evil things proceed from within a,nd defile the man." These two passages show that according to Christ, no person is good, and that evil proceeds from within men and is not imposed on men from the outside. 
We need to work tirelessly to reform institutions which tempt and pressure individuals to act unjustly, but this is not enough. Those who follow Christ's word as truth must accept His assertions on the fallen nature of mankind. This revelation is extremely important to the approach we take in righting the wrongs we see in the world. On the subject of human nature, conservatives-not progressives -are truer to the words of Christ, and the strength of this view of human nature is buttressed by the horrors caused by utopian regimes which have ignored this truth at their peril. 
If men cannot be counted on to act just­ly, rearranging our society through gov­ernment, activity or revolution is at best a formal endorsement of previous individ­ual enlightenment, or at worst, danger­ous window dressing. As long as there are people who seek to commit injustice, those people will find a way to do so. This principle has been demonstrated in our nation's failed attempts at campaign finance reform, efforts to regulate the lobbying industry and the countless num­bers of communal settlements which have failed. 
Any lasting and true revolution must be one of the heart, a transformation within every human being which recognizes the inherent dignity which lies within each one of us as an image of our Creator. When men attempt to resolve the com­plex problems of the human condition with inhuman institutions and bureaucra­cies, the result is a progression of oppres­sive systems, each more brutal than the last. Any political or social revolution will fail if it is not preceded by a greater transformation of individual minds, with­out which the bold designs of leaders will collapse under the weight of fallen men. 
We are all called upon to participate in such a revolution in our own lives. Our efl'orts in fighting poverty, violence, racism and numerous other evils will only be effective when we take responsibility for the struggle in every action we take during every moment of the day. The opposite side of this coin is that all of us must work to lift each other up in the struggle against human weakness and temptation. When this is accomplished, enlightened business owners will treat workers with dignity, enlightened parents will refrain from domestic violence, and enlightened servicemen will act as agents of justice. Together, we can accomplish the radical change we all so desire by first altering our own behavior and then edifying our neighbors. The revolution begins with you.

Joining the team, fighting the global health crisis 
Editor's note: This is the first of3 columns calling for greater attention to the global health crisis as discussed in the academic forum earlier this semes­ter. The second will appear tomorrow.

soccer game. There is something funny about a large mob of Guest children chasing the Columnists ball around, each child vying for a chance to kick the ball. There are no positions and only a vague sense of a team. As they mature, chil­dren learn that there is more to the game than simply getting their kicks in. Team members must work together. Ultimately, the team shares both the joy of victory and the agony of defeat. These lessons are applicable even on a global scale. 
At the Notre Dame Forum "The Global Health Crisis: Forging Solutions, Effecting Change" held at the Joyce Center on Sept. 14, a panel discussed the dire conditions of global health. Panelists included Professor of Health Policy and Management at Columbia University and Director of the UN Millennium Project Jeffrey Sachs, native Ugandan and coor­dinator of clinical trials at Makerere University Miriam Laker Opwonya, and medical anthropologist and physician Paul Farmer, along with current and for­mer Notre Dame students. We felt that throughout the discussion, several prin­ciples emerged reminiscent of lessons learned on the soccer field. The pan­elists' primary message was one of teamwork on a global scale. They argued that wealthy nations share a moral imperative to play their part on an inter­national team. Rather than viewing the economy as a zero-sum competition where one country's advancement comes at another's expense, wealthy nations must recognize that aid to poor countries will eventually benefit everyone through the growth of larger global markets. 
All citizens, including students like us, have roles on the team, and should par­ticipate. Donations are desperately need­ed to save more than 40 million people who will suffer and die this year from tuberculosis, HIV and various treatable water-borne illnesses. These people are impoverished and unable to support themselves, and the underdeveloped nations in which they live cannot assist them either. Nevertheless, more affiuent individuals often fail to donate money, believing the excuse that their limited contributions cannot possibly elicit glob­al change. While a five dollar donation to charity may not seem very significant, it is enough to provide treatment for two adult malaria victims who would other­wise die. Children, who are even more vulnerable, cost less to treat than adults. The change from one individual's pock­ets could save two or more lives! If the entire Notre Dame community made similar donations, we could raise thou­sands of dollars, which could purchase medicines and other supplies that could directly save upwards of 20,000 lives in a single year. Clearly, a team effort can make quite an impact. 

Furthermore, our imperative is not merely to keep people from starving now, but to offer enough assistance to provide the foundation for future eco­nomic growth. To borrow from the imagery of Sachs, the wealthy nations of the world must help lesser developed nations onto the first rung of the ladder of ecological development before they will be able to begin pulling themselves upward. However, this process takes time, so we must act as soon as possible. 
Indeed, now is the time for Notre Dame students to join the team against global poverty. As representatives of the student body, the Council of Representatives and the remainder of our Student Government should organize this effort. We encourage our readers to let their representatives know that they support a campus-wide fundraiser for global health. More importantly, when the time comes, we implore our fellow students to donate generously. Even if you have no money to spare, your time supporting the fundraiser can be just as valuable. Everyone has individual talents to contribute to global efforts. In the meantime, opportunities exist to join and support student organizations with char­itable causes such as Circle K and Lead­NO. The Center for Social Concerns also provides opportunities for students to contribute their time and talents to char­itable efforts. If everyone cooperates and we combine our individual contributions, collectively we can and will make a dif­ference. Rally, sons and daughters of Notre Dame, against the global health crisis.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
Ignorance surfaces in classroom 

On the last day of classes before break, I met my roommate in physics. She seemed distraught, not last-day-of-mid-terms distraught, but more I'm-not-sure-whether-to-laugh-or-cry distraught. She then recounted the events of her philosophy class that day. In a discussion on communism, my roommate made a contribution. She was then opposed by the next student who prefaced his comment by insulting her, stating that he would have expected such a simplistic view from an athlete. For my roommate, who is already economic in her contri­butions to discussions, this student's power trip effectively hushed her. It is unfortunate that not all Notre Dame students are as self-assured in discussion as the young man who silenced my roommate. I do not care what his point was exactly because his self-assurance was negated by his blatant ignorance. Clearly, this man was quite the inter-disciplinary scholar to have established such a correlation between physical ability and intellect -a correlation which he was unable to argue his point on communism without. I sincerely hope that this young man's preface is not one frequently faced by student­athletes, and I am disappointed by his arrogance. By insulting some of the most industrious students on campus to bolster his ego, he per­petuated his own futile attitude. There is no space for that type of atti­tude here. He should be appreciative of his victim's tact.

Spirit aids in victory 
I have attended untold Irish home games over the years and had the pleasure of being at the recent UCLA game. More than any game I can recall, I was very impressed with the cheers emanating from the student section. At several critical junc­tures in the game, the noise starting from the northwest corner of the stands spread throughout the stadium and affected play on the field to Notre Dame's advantage. The student body is to be commended for its enthusiasm and for the team's positive reaction to it. Keep up the good work. Go Irish!

Homosexuality + GOP -­hypocrisy 
As the Mark Foley scandal continues to unfold, it would seem that this might be a step back for the gay rights movement in America. Not so fast. The Foley scandal-as gross and disturbing as it is -may Matt Stone in fact be a paradoxical step forward for the status of gays, University of especially within Republican Arizona ranks. Daily 
Of course, it does not seem Wildcat like it at first blush. Eight states are considering anti-gay marriage meas­ures in the upcoming election, including Arizona's notorious Proposition 107. Republican leaders continue to pander to a closed-minded base by bashing gays in advertisements. 
Newt Gingrich, former speaker of the house, even conflated homosexuality with pedophilia on national television, as if all gays are also pedophiles. According to Gingrich, the GOP failed to address Foley's misconduct years ago because they didn't want to be "accused of gay bashing." 
Needless to say, some straight people are pedophiles too, which must mean that all straight people find gratification in sex with children, right, Newt? 
But something else is afoot here. The Foley scandal may engender a witch-hunt within the Republican ranks, but behind the scenes, gay Republicans are finding new levels of acceptance. 
Take Andrew Sullivan. The well-known conser­vative columnist is openly gay. He recently wrote that the Republican leadership is "tolerant of gay people but they have to keep quiet about it because their base would go crazy ifthey ever express it." 
He continues: "They have this acute cognitive dissonance, which is a polite way of saying hypocrisy." 
A striking dichotomy is evident within the Republican Party. While certain Republican politicians have friends who are gay, support those friends, and indeed, are even comfortable with them (gasp!), to turn out the conservative vote-the so-called "values voters"-those same politicians must pander to a doltish stereotype about gays. This is not leadership; this is cow­ardice. 
Sullivan describes it as a GOP riding two horses by counting on gays "to staff and support" Republican candidates "while relying on gay­baiting" to turn out the conservative vote. The two horses won't ride in tandem forever, and the Republicans will have to pick which one is a bet­ter long-term strategy. Needless to say, Sullivan urges his fellow conservatives to get off the gay­baiting horse -quickly. 
But there are other fissures developing in the Republican ranks as well. While some Republicans privately have no qualms with homosexuality-evidently this includes Sen. Rick "Family Values" Santorum -other Republican politicians are still openly hostile toward gays. 
Sen. Sam Brownback of Kansas is holding up one of President Bush's judicial nominees, Janet Neff, because Neff once attended a commitment ceremony for two lesbian partners. Sen. James lnbofe of Oklahoma will not hire gays onto his staff, although some of his staffers have anony­mously admitted to being gay in the press. 
Bashing gays was an effective get-out-the-vote strategy in 2004, but it appears that such a strat­egy is now dividing the Republican Party in novel ways. 
The backlash against gay Republicans follow­ing the Foley scandal may be short-lived, but it is forcing Republicans to deal very publicly with a profound absurdity. Some GOP soul-searching is in order. The "closet-tolerant" Republican leader­ship (Vice President Dick Cheney's daughter is a die-hard conservative lesbian, after all) needs to voice a message of hope and openness to its fam­ily-values base and persuade the moralists on the right that gays are people too -and should be treated as such. 
Leadership is about doing things that may be unpopular but are right. A very public Republican acceptance of gays would be a laud­able first step. If the Foley scandal could engen­der that kind of change, an otherwise depressing affair might become the catalyst for real progress.

MOVIE REVIEWS 

'Grudge 2' instills little fear in audiences 
By ERIN McGINN Assistant Scene Editor 
A good horror film is most simply judged by whether or not it achieves its ultimate goal of scaring the audience. The audience response should then consist of such words as "scary," "frightening" or "spooky." "Laughable," on the otbflr hand, should not be one of those words. 
Laughable is one of the few words to describe the travesty that is "The Grudge 2." 
The first mistake of the film is writer­director Takashi Shimizu's decision to incorporate three separate storylines into the movie. The first storyline is the conclu­sion to "The Grudge" 


(2004). After learning that her sister Karen The Grudge 2 ing flaw of this movie (Sarah Michelle Gellar)

friend Eason (Edison Chen). 
The second Tokyo-based storyline follows the unpopular Allison (Arielle Kebbel, "John Tucker Must Die") who is studying at an international high school. On a dare, she accompanies two other girls to the house where the grudge originated. Consequently, her two companions, Vanessa (Teresa Palmer, "Wolf Creek") and Miyuki (Misako Uno), are systematically haunted and attacked by the little grudgn children. 
The third, and the most unnecessary and confusing, storyline is set far from Japan in Chicago. Trish (Jennifer Beals, "The L Word") moves in with her boyfriPnd and his two children. The parents begin acting strangely, and the son thinks that it's due to the weird neighboring girl that he sees at 
night in the hallway.

seems unlikely that Karen's absence would go unnoticed for the two years that have lapsed between "The Grudge 2" and its predecessor. 
Why was Karen's family only finding out about her situation now? The movie disre­gards this completely (as it disregards most logic in the film as a whole). Aubrey doesn't believe in the supernatural forces that are after her sister, until Karen dies shortly into the film. She spends the rest of the movie investigating in Tokyo with her journalist 
leaves the movie with a very disjointed and empty feel. The origi­nal movie, despite lacking a strong plot, was still unified by the single point of Karen discovering what was going on inside the house. 
This film has no sense of discovery -or even a point. It doesn't add to the original mythos of "The Grudge." Aside from one minor point, nothing new is learned to war­rant the creation of a whole new movie.

New 'Beginning' enlivens old horror series 
By ERIN McGINN Assistant Scene Editor 
"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning" keeps up the tradition of pre­vious "Chainsaw" films with its high quo­tient of slasher-flick techniques. Serving as an origin story for the Leatherface leg­end, 'The Beginning" is a good founda­tion for an off-kilter film series. 
The movie follows siblings Eric (Matthew Bomer, "Flightplan") and Dean (Taylor Handley, "The OC") who are trav­eling through Texas with their girlfriends Chrissie (Jordana Brewster, "The Fast and the Furious") and Bailey (Diora Baird, "Accepted") before the brothers ship off to Vietnam. Eric is returning to Vietnam for his second tour, with Dean supposedly joining him. Unbeknownst

Sheriff Hoyt (R. Lee social commentary
and R. Lee Ermey
Ermey) takes Eric, Dean and Bailey back to the Hewitt house of horrors to become their first victims. In the mean­time, Chrissie makes the standard hor­ror-movie decision to locate and rescue her friends. 

The basic premise of the film is similar to that of most other slasher flicks -a group of young travelers are systemati­cally captun~d. tortured and killed -but there are some differences in the formula that stray from initial expectations. 
For starters, the protagonists are already facing horror in their own lives with the Vietnam War before entering a wholly different realm of horror. Secondly, even before Leatherface enters the picture, the teenagers are already placed in a frightening situation when they total their car and are then taken prisoner by the Sheriff. 
Additional creepiness is comes simply from knowing this is a prequel to the other "Chainsaw" flicks -in this film, the Hewitt family is just beginning their murderous careers, leaving the audienee to witness the transformation of the fam­ily from human to monster. 
Similar to the recent retelling of "The 
Hills Have Eyes" 
(2006), there is a 
has often been lost in the quest to be the goriest or scariest display. 
This film is once again joining the sens­es of horror and reflection together. Besides the conflicting feelings of the teenagers towards the Vietnam War, Sheriff Hoyt reflects on his time spent as a P.O.W. while he served in the Korean War. Like "The Hills Have Eyes," the frightening and highly predictable "scares." Shimizu, who also created the original Japanese "Ju-on" films, relies heavily on his now-cliched freaky-looking children. Unfortunately for Shimizu, his key ele­ments of the long-haired girl, blue screech­ing boy and dirty murky water have been overexposed to American ftlmgoers due to the rise in "J-horror" films, a genre of Asian horror movies like "The Ring" that have found new audiences through remakes made in the United States. 
Their parody counterparts in the last two "Scary Movie" installments also contribute to the audience's inability to take the film's conventions seriously. They've simply lost their ability in instill fright in the audience. 
"The Grudge 2" could still have been a redeemable movie even with Shimizu's tricks no longer eliciting screams from moviegoers. But that would have required having a plot at the core of the film. 
With no coherent storyline, and nothing in the film that comes remotely close to scary, there is quite simply no reason to endure the torture that constitutes "The Grudge 2."

movie's villains aren't portrayed sympa­thetically, but there is attention paid to their initial plight as slaughtnrhouse workers who have lost both their jobs and their livelihood. 
Director Jonathan Liebesman ("Darkness Falls") does an excellent job of maintaining both a suspenseful atmos­phere and tight pacing throughout the lilm. The movie also returns to its roots by retaining the grimy and almost docu­mentary-like style of the original film. 
Brewster is successful as the strong­willed heroine who keeps fighting until the film's final moments. Bomer and Handley play the brothers well, and do a good job of demonstrating the inherent conflict of the Vietnam War. R. Lee Ermey arguably steals the show as the mean-spirited and funny Sheriff Hoyt. 
Because "The Beginning" is a prequel, the audience already knows that the Hewitts and Leatherface won't be defeat­ed. The big question of the film is the fate of Chrissie, the only uncaptured teenag­er, and Liebesman maintains the sus­penseful nature of her story for the film's entirety. 
With numerous genuinely frightening moments, "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning" is as good as a slasher film can get and a great fit for the Halloween horror season.

Charlie Weis isn't a fan of style points. 
He places no high value on blowout victories, running up the score and embarrassing oppo­nents. 
Good thing. Because he did­n't even have to think about any of those Saturday as Notre Dame won a game in which a team with much less talent -and a backup · quarterback ­played better than the Irish. 
"Good teams win games like that," Weis said. "Good teams at the end of the game somehow, good teams make a play at the end of the game to win." 
In those two sentences, Weis described precisely what's wrong with Notre Dame right now. It's a good team, not a great one. The offense is sputtering, the defense is as vulnerable as ever to big plays and the team cannot-or at least has not -soundly defeated teams it should. 
And for a squad that came into the year ranked in the top-3 in most polls and top-S in all others, being a good team and barely beating lesser opponents should not be enough. 
"Let me tell you something," Weis said. ''I'm not going to feel miserable about this win, I prom­ise you. You want to be miserable, fine. I'm going to be happy." 
Weis can be happy about the win, but Notre Dame's performances this year should give him pause. 
But there's a lot of room for hope and happiness.

Notre Dame played a bad game offensively for more than three and a half quarters, yet in the final 62 seconds showed why so many peo­ple are afraid of its offense. The Irish demonstrated a resiliency and belief in their ability to come back in the toughest of situations. Most of all, they sent a message to the world: Don't count us out just yet.

There's a reason so many people -on campus and on air -are upset with Notre Dame's perform­ance so far. They should be better than this! That's why Notre Dame keeps bouncing around in the polls. 
With a rare talent at quarter­back, an offensive line with four seniors (though it didn't show Saturday), another four on the defensive line and two more in the secondary, how much more experi­ence could a team have?

With his eye black dripping from his face after the win, Quinn put his head down on Irish quarter­back coach Pete Vaas' shoulder. 
"Heck of a game," Vaas said. Hopefully that will be the last one that nerve-racking for a while.

Sarnardzija keeps cool, saves game 
Laws rubs receiver's calves for luck; Weis calls play product ofpreparation 
By KEN FOWLER Sports Editor 

As UCLA punter Aaron Perez booted 
his two booming kicks with just over a 
minute remaining in the game, Notre 
Dame defensive tackle Trevor Laws was 
on the sideline, rubbing down the calves 
of Irish receiver Jeff Samardzija. 

"Just trying to keep it loose," 
Samardzija said. "Me and Trevor are 
pretty loose guys out there. You won't 
see us yelling or anything too much. 
They came up with a good, little defen­
sive stop. And I figured I'd use a little 
luck and see if he could rub up my 
calves a little bit before I went out 
there." 

Samardzija found that luck and put 
the massage to good use, contorting his 
long legs around Bruins safety Dennis 
Keyes and galloping into the end zone 
for the game-winning score. 

"(Samardzija] knows he owes me something for that," Laws quipped. "I swear of it. I rubbed those calves down and told him to [do it]." Irish receiver Jeff Samardzija jumps across the goal line with 27 seconds left

Quinn's 4th-down pass goes for 10,000 
West, Samardzija handle punt return duties; Wooden recovers from lingering concussion 
By CHRIS KHOREY Associate Sporrs Editor 
Brady Quinn's 25-yard completion on fourth-and­one to tight end John Carlson in the first quarter Saturday gave him exactly 10,000 passing yards for his colle­giate career. Quinn became the 32nd quarterback in Division 1-A history to reach that milestone. 
Third time Irish charm 
Saturday's comeback marked the third time in school history that the Irish scored a go-ahead touch­down with less than 30 sec­onds remaining. 
The first time was in the 1979 Cotton Bowl when Joe Montana's touchdown pass to Kris Haines lifted Notre Dame to a 35-34 victory over Houston. 
The second time came in the "Snow Bowl" against 

Penn State in 1992. Rick Mirer threw a three-yard TO to Jerome Bettis to pull the Irish within one. Mirer then found Reggie Brooks in the corner of the end zone on a two-point conversion to give the Irish a 17-16 win. 
Lambert earns starting nod 
Charlie Weis said Ambrose Wooden had fully recovered from a concussion suffered against Michigan before the game, but junior Terrail Lambert started at the field cornerback position. Lambert intercepted UCLA quarterback Patrick Cowan in the first quarter for his third interception of the sea­son. 
"After he made that pick they pretty much stopped going over there," Irish safe­ty Tom Zbikowski said. 
Zbikowski absent on returns 
Zbikowski did not return punts for the second straight game. Jeff Samardzija and George West split return duties on Saturday. Zbikowski has not returned a punt since suffering an injury to his shoulder against Purdue. 
"I wasn't going to risk him," Irish coach Charlie Weis said. "Zbikowski is our punt returner. I just didn't want to waste him on a punt return." 
Fourth down dominance 
Notre Dame went 4-for-5 on fourth down conversions Saturday. On the season, the Irish are 13-for-17, while the defense has stopped 7 -of-1 0 fourth down attempts by Irish opponents. 
Healthy Thomas returns 
Linebacker Joe Brockington still saw significant time in Saturday's game even though a healthy Travis Thomas returned to the lineup. 
"Travis was ready to come back and Joe played really well the last couple of games," Weis said. "So we just didn't feel that taking Joe out of the lineup was the right thing to do, and we did­n't feel that keeping Travis out of the lineup was the right thing to do. We just felt that we [should play] both of them." 
Hornung honored at game 
Notre Dame honored 1956 Heisman Trophy winner Paul Hornung before the game. Hornung flipped the coin at the beginning of Saturday's game. UCLA won the coin toss and deferred the option to the second half. Notre Dame received, and the Bruins defended the north end zone. Notre Dame is now 5-2 this season in coin flips, but has received the ball to start each game.

COMEBACK KIDS 
Notre Dame clawed from behind to steal a 20-17 victory from UCLA Saturday when Quinn found 
Samardzija in the game's waning seconds. Quinn finished 27 -for-45 for 345 yards with two touchdowns, both to Samardzija. The Irish 
defense allowed only 243 yards -its lowest total this season-and forced a three-and-out Bruin punt in the last minutes to set up the 
final Irish charge.

MOVIE REVIEWS 

Unfunny satire overwhelms new comedy 
By BRIAN DOXTADER Scene Editor 

"Man of the Year" is a film that starts out promisingly, but gradually loses steam and ends as an unsatisfying mish­mash of aborted ideas and unfulfilled potential. Failing to take a real stab at the American political system and its farcical nature, "Man of the Year" instead gets lost over the course of its running time, pushing the real issues out of the way in favor of traditional llollywood trappings. 
Tom Dobbs (Robin Williams) is the host of a late-night comedy news pro­gram (not unlike "The Daily Show" or "The Colbert Report") who, on a whim, decides to run for president. Helped by both his manager Jack Mencken (Christopher Walken) and his aide Eddie Langston (comedian Lewis Black), he sets off to run his 
recalled in time for the election. 
Unfortunately, the second half of the film gets bogged down in this heavy­handed plotting. There's a romance, there's some action, there's a conspira­cy, the typical Hollywood stuff. This wouldn't be so problematic if the char­acters had been developed more fully or if the plotting itself weren't so laugh­able. 
"Man of the Year" loses focus as it pro­gresses, and while it never completely derails, its departure from its original premise detracts from any possibility of success. Despite its full 115-minute run­ning time, "Man of the Year" feels underdeveloped --the filmmakers clearly didn't trust its single premise to carry the film over two hours, and instead padded it with unnecessary plot­ting. 
The acting is problematic. Strangely enough, the entirety of the cast is com­prised of actors

Black has proven time and again that he's simply not an actor, and though he tries to stay under control here, his stand-up tendencies and sensibilities show through. Both he and Linney are mired in histrionics, which gives parts of the film a more frantic feel than neces­sary. In a strange twist of fate, Williams is really the only actor who holds him­self in check, making Dobbs surprisingly subdued. 
"Man of the Year" is the kind of film that would work better as a mockumen­tary. It's an interesting concept, but the execution is so run-of-the-mill and its sensibilities so mixed that the picture ultimately falls flat. It feels as if director Barry Levinson doesn't trust his audi­ence, which leads to a rather uninterest­ing and, worst of all, unfunny picture. 
The best comedies are pointed satires, which is part of what makes them so appealing --while "Man of the Year" claims to be a topical comedy, it's nei­ther topical enough nor comic enough. There's not a single memorable joke, gag or line in the entire film. It's not that "Man of the Year" goes for cheap laugh, but that it goes for no laughs at all, and in that in succeeds.

Opulent 'Marie Antoinette' fails to connect 
By LAURA MILLER 
Scene Critic 

"Marie Antoinette," written and direct­ed by Sofia Coppola, is both a success and failure at once. It is absolutely heart­wrenching to watch --and not because of the plot line. When Kirsten Dunst bursts onto the screen, she completely embodies the decadence and sensuality of the former queen of France. 
As the minutes tick by, however, and the film continues to move at the pace of Ferris Bueller's history teacher, a gut­wrenching sadness remains. How can a movie with such marvelous music, cos­tumes and casting fail to be moving? 
The problem is that the plot line does not progress very quickly. There is some­thing to be said for slowly taking in the artistic beauty of a 
life. 

A few minor adjustments in the telling were made, but only to simplify the story, making it more accessible for audiences with little knowledge of eighteenth-cen­tury French politics. 
Dunst was excellent as Marie Antoinette --one of the more redeeming aspects of the film. Not only does she seem to relish playing the spoiled aristo­crat, but she wins the audience's sympa­thy. 
This is a significant accomplishment given the mixed reports on the historical character of Marie Antoinette. There were few familiar faces in the cast --the acting was good on the whole, but the majority of roles weren't very demand­ing. 
The varied soundtrack is by far one of the most interesting aspects of the film. It blends more famil­

its emotional strength acts as an unfortunate reminder that the entirety of "Marie Antoinette" could have been well written and, unfortunately, was not. 
Despite these failings, "Marie Antoinette" is quite historically accurate. Many of the images seen in the movies are replicas of real artifacts, paintings and buildings from Marie Antoinette's music bore any pop­
culture-savvy viewer. Both genres are combined with cine­matographically unique imagery, making these sequences enjoyable to watch. 
The costumes undoubtedly add to the beauty created by the music and cine­matography. Marie Antoinette's cos­tumes are incredibly ornate and vast in number, a fitting tribute to the legend of the historical figure herself. 

The other costumes are equally beauti­ful, contributing to an aura of over­whelming wealth most typical of European royalty. 
The only downside to such fantastic costuming is that it is frequently distraet­ing, seemingly apparently to even the director. The film loses its emotional power due to the overwhelming empha­sis on Marie's attire. 
Dialogue frequently becomes obsolete, with the film devolving into shot after shot of shoes, dresses and textiles. While this film certainly is up to Academy Award standards for costume design, it seems that the only reason for the movie's creation was to win this sort of acclaim. 
While the beginning of the film drags due to this obsession with costuming, the end of the film is beautiful, leaving audi­ences with a feeling of validation for see­ing the entire picture. 
It is a notable flaw, however, that Coppola's film lacks the ability to draw any significant amount of emotional power until the last 30 minutes. Sadly, "Marie Antoinette" could have easily been shortened to an hour without losing any ofits dramatic aspects.

Irish overcome bad first round, place seventh 
Sandman shoots career-best 67 to lead Notre Dame 
By FRAN TOLAN 
Sports Writer 
After a first round that Notre Dame coach Jim Kubinski called "terrible," the Irish stormed back in the final two rounds to place seventh in a strong 15-team field at the Prestige in La Quinta, California Oct. 16 and 17. 
The Irish carded an open­ing-round 302 and were stuck in thirteenth place before a strong comeback, culminating in a third-round 282 that matched Notre Dame's sixth-best 18-hole team score ever. 
"I was proud of the way we fought back," Kubinski said. "I think it says a lot about our guys." 
Co-host Stanford won the event with a team score of 849, 30 shots better than Notre Dame. 
The Irish were led by soph­omore Josh Sandman and senior co-captain Cole lsban, who both finished with scores under par. 
Sandman shot a personal­best 67 (-5) in the final round and ended up in a tie for tenth place with a three­under par 213. 
"I honestly think Josh is as talented as anyone in college golf," Kubinski said of his budding star. "This is a glimpse of what's to come, not an exception to the rule." 
Sandman, meanwhile, is simply happy to be healthy and playing well after strug­gling through back injuries last year.

Belles vvin tvvo, lose one rna tch over break

Spons Writer 
Saint Mary's had a roller­coaster ride of a fall break. 
The Belles started it off play­ing Alma on Oct. 14, the sec­ond time Saint Mary's met the tough conference foe that week. Alma came out strong, beating the Belles 30-19 in game one. 
While the Belles took the sec­ond match with a 30-25 win, they couldn't keep up the fight. Alma took game three 30-22

Belles drop to fourth in MIAA vvith losses 
Saint Mary's shutout three times in three games over fall break 
By DAN MURPHY Sports Writer 
Saint Mary's was held scoreless in three games dur­ing fall break as it dropped to 4-8-1 (3-3-1 in the confer­ence) on the year. 
The small skid drops the Belles into a tie for fourth in the MIAA with one game remaining this week before the conference tournament gets underway Oct. 28. 
The team started the break with a 1-0 loss to Hope College in Holland, Mich. Sophomore Sonya Masghati scored with nine minutes left in the second half to break the scoreless tie and secure a win for the Flying Dutch. 
In the game, Saint Mary's was held to just five shots ­only one of which was on net -allowing Hope goalkeeper Holly Nestle to collect an easy shutout victory. 
The Belles also dropped a 1-0 decision to No. 5 Calvin the following Saturday. Senior Jill Capel was the hero for the Knights as her sev­enth goal in conference play brought the team's unbeaten streak to 16 games. Capel beat goalie Laura Reline as she drove a high shot into the corner from 18 yards away. 
Belles' coach Caryn Mackenzie opted to play a defensive-minded game to slow down the quick, veteran offense of the Knights, a unit 

that put up six goals against Saint Mary's earlier in the season. 
The plan worked but kept the team from registering a single shot on net and very few opportunities on the offensive side of the ball. 
Calvin got off 20 shots in the game, and Reline was able to stop six of the seven that made it on goal. 
The senior goalkeeper cap­tured her second shutout of the season as the Belles played to a 0-0 draw with Adrian College. She saved all eight shots she faced in the contest. 
Senior Ashley Hinton and sophomore Mandy Thomson had two shots each on net for Saint Mary's, but once again the team was unable to find the back of the net against the Bulldogs. 
The tie gives Adrian and Saint Mary's identical records in the conference, but the Bulldogs' overall record of 6­10-1 gives them the current edge in the standings. 
Adrian will face Kalamazoo this afternoon at 4 p.m. and Saint Mary's needs a Kalamazoo victory in order to have a chance to finish in the top half of the conference. 
The Belles conclude their regular season at home against Tri-State tomorrow afternoon. The Thunder has been outscored 31-1 in 2006 and is still in search of its first conference win. 
Saint Mary's players were unavailable for comment fol­lowing the games.

Sophomorefinishes 31st as Irish take fifth at Taylormade Classic 
By CHRIS HINE Sports Writer 
Notre Dame sophomore Lisa Maunu couldn't even walk to the plane. 
Maunu, who contracted a throat infection and spent the night of Oct. 12 at Health Services, still managed to play the entire Taylormade Aztec Fall Classic at San Diego State University Oct. 16-17 and fin­ished 31st, helping her team­mates to a fifth-place finish. 
"They did an athletic blitz on me, hooking me up to an IV and pumping me with drugs," Maunu said. "My teammates had to literally carry me to the plane on Friday because I was so sick." 
Maunu had

Notre Dame responded, !iring a season-best 299 to climb into a tie for fifth place overall last Tuesday. In that second round, the team's highest score was a 
76. The Irish linished 22 strokes behind tournament winner Denver. 

"I was very pleased with what happened on day two," Holt said. "We were a little disap­pointed with fifth. but it could've been a lot worse." 
Nakazaki (71-74, +1) led the way for the Irish. Notre Dame's overall stroke average leader had struggled in her last few tournaments before the Aztec Fall Classic, but rebounded last week to finish tied for fifth over­all -her best of the fall season. 
"I played OK," she said. "The first day went well. I've been

Despite Maunu's illness, the Irish expected to finish well in San Diego, where they were one of the highest ranked teams going in. 
"We were the third highest ranked team of the field coming in, so finishing fifth was a little disappointing," senior Noriko Nakazaki said. 
The Irish faltered on day one, Oct. 16, firing a 22-over par 311 to place eleventh after 18 holes. Three Irish golfers posted scores above 80. 
Notre Dame coach Susan Holt met with the squad after day one to light a fire under her team to fmish off their rounds as strong as they started them.

for 35th overall while junior Jane Lee (80-76, +12) tied for 41st. Kristen Wetzel rounded out the team scoring for the Irish by finishing tied for 49th with a 13-over par per­formance. Senior Stacy Brown played as an individual entrant whose scores did not count to the overall team performance. 
Denver (278-303) took the tournament title while BYU (296-293) placed second. Denver's Stephanie Sherlock (69-72, -3) and Emily Hoepner (66-75, -3} tied for first overall, with Sherlock winning a playoff to take the title. Hoepner's 66 in the first round was the low round for the tournament. 
Next on the Irish schedule is the Edwin Watts/Palmetto Intercollegiate Invitational on Oct. 30-31 in Kiawah Island, S. Car.

Parbhu advances to semis 
By DEIRDRE KRASULA Sports Writer 
For Sheeva Parbhu, taking on Ohio State's Devin Mullings in the semifinals may seem like a case of deja vu. 
The two faced off in the semifi­nals of the 2005 ITA Midwest Championships and are scheduled to do so again today. Parbhu, this year's No. 2 seed, defeated Mullings, this year's No. 8 seed, 6­1, 1-6, 7-5 in 2005. 
Parbhu knocked off Ohio State's Drew Eberly in a tiebreaker Monday, winning 1-6, 7-6, 6-1 on his way to securing a place in the semifinals. 
Senior Stephen Bass-who won the event last year -fell to Ohio State's Steven Moneke 7-6, 3-6, 6-4 in the quarterfinals. 

"He needs to step it up, to be more offensive," head coach Bobby Bayliss said of Bass. "At whatever level he plays he needs to do it instinctively, to strike first." 
The rest of the Irish team also had a strong showing at the tour­nament. Senior Barry King dropped a close match to Minnesota's Raoul Schwark, falling 7-6,6-4. 
"[King] had chances to win it and played very well, but could not quite pull it out," Bayliss said. "I think he could have gone far in the tournament." 
Bayliss also praised the efforts of sophomore Brett Helgeson. Helgeson advanced to the main draw with a No. 17 seed only to fall to Louisville's David Simon 4-6, 6-3, 6-4. 
"Brett has had a great fall and is hitting the ball very well," Bayliss said. "He's hitting better than any­one on the team right now." 
Parbhu has thrived not only in singles but also in doubles, advanc­ing with senior partner Ryan Keckley to the semifinals of the Doubles Championship. 
The Irish have been working on their doubles game all season and Bayliss is pleased with the results the team is seeing. The duo tri­umphed over Illinois' Brendan Davis and GD Jones 8-2 in the quarterfinals. On their way to earning a spot in the semifinals, the two also eliminated Michigan's Matko Maravic and George Navas. 
Parbhu and Keckley are sched­uled to take on Ohio State's Drew Eberly and Justin Kronauge today at2p.m.

Young team finishes fourth at conference championship tourney 
By REBECCA SLINGER Sports Writer 
Saint Mary's wanted to win the conference title this year, but after a season filled with disappointment, illness and injury, the Belles came up short of their goal.

Irish finish fourth at ISU 
Kurt Benninger and Patrick Smyth lead team with top-20 finishes 
By JAY FITZPATRICK 
Sports Writer 
For the second race in a row, the No. 12 Irish men were able to shock higher ranked teams in a big-time national meet, finishing fourth out of 36 in the Pre-National Meet Oct. 14 at Indiana State. 
Notre Dame accumulated just 255 points in the race, better than five teams ranked ahead of the then-No. 21 Irish before the race -No. 9 BYU, No. 14 Michigan, No. 16 Virginia, No. 19 William and Mary and No. 20 Arizona State. The Irish finished behind only No. 5 Iona (100 points), No. 3 Stanford (106) and No. 25 Florida (217). 
Senior Kurt Benninger 
(23:40) and sophomore Patrick Smyth (23:49) led Notre Dame across the line, finishing seventh and twelfth, respectively. 
"It was good we ran togeth­er for about three-quarters of the race and went with a group," Smyth said. "I kind of fell off a little bit, but we were both pretty high." 
Joining Notre Dame's top two runners were juniors 
Jake Watson (24:23) and Brett Adams 
(24:50) and freshman Jake Walker (24:51). Of the Irish qualifiers, four set career-highs for an eight kilometer race while Smyth was

Forest's Michelle Sikes took 
a mere three seconds off his personal best set at the Notre Dame Invitational run Sept. 30. 
Walker's finish was espe­cially impressive as it was the freshman's first time in the team's top-five lineup in his Notre Dame career. 
"As a freshman stepping into that role, I think he's going to be great and I think he's going keep it moving," Smyth said. 
Despite the high finish, Smyth feels Notre Dame has the capability to do even bet­ter as the season continues. 
"We have the Big East this Friday -we're just going to keep rolling," he said. "We had a real good training over fall break and we just keep rolling with it and hopefully the Big East goes well." 
The race was an important stepping stone for Notre Dame's hunt for a national title because the NCAA cham­pionship next month will be run at the same course in Terre Haute. 
The Irish women also com­peted in the Pre-National Meet, finishing tied with Indiana for 15th out of 36 teams in the six kilometer race with 441 points.

currently one point behind Seton Hall for the 10th and final slot in the conference tournament, which begins Wednesday. Because the Bearcats lost to the Pirates on Sunday, they need to beat the Irish tonight to qualify for the tournament. 
Notre Dame has clinched both a berth in the tournament and a first round bye, but Waldrum said he is not con­cerned about Cincinnati's emo­tion in what could be the last game of the Bearcats' season because Connecticut, Georgetown and Villanova were in similar situations when the Irish played them. 
"The last two or three games, we've run into teams that desperately need wins," he said. "When we played UConn, we were playing a des­perate team. They were on the verge of missing the confer­ence tournament, which is unheard of for them." 
Waldrum also said the Irish have motivation of their own. 
"We've reminded our kids that we need to win as many games as we can to get home field advantage in the NCAA tournament," he said. 
Notre Dame 0, Connecticut 0 
The Irish and Huskies tied Oct. 13 in Storrs, Conn., giving Notre Dame the first blemish on its record and Connecticut a berth in the Big East Tournament. 
"We ran into a UConn team that was ready to play, but we also ran into a little bit of the fatigue from midterms, from staying up late and studying," Waldrum said. 

Waldrum said his players were upset immediately follow­ing the tie, but by their next game against Georgetown, the emotion had subsided. 
"They were upset about it and they hope to get to play Connecticut down the road, but its not something that's going to be in their minds the rest of the season," he said. 
Irish junior forward Amanda Cinalli had Notre Dame's best scoring chance, a header on a cross from sophomore Brittany Bock with only nine minutes left in the game, but the ball sailed just over the crossbar. 
Notre Dame 5, Providence 0 
The Irish bounced back from their tie against UConn with a drubbing of the Friars on the road Oct. 15. 
Sophomore Kerri Hanks became the youngest player in Irish history to reach 100 career points and 40 career goals with her score and two assists while Bock and Cinalli added goals of their own. 
Notre Dame held Providence without a shot on goal or a corner kick in earning its 12th shutout of the season. 
Notre Dame 4, Villanova 2 
The Irish allowed multiple goals for the first time this sea­son but managed a 4-2 win over the Wildcats in Philadelphia Friday. 
The initial Villanova goal, the first allowed by Notre Dame in six games, came four minutes into the second half by fresh­men Erin Byrnes and tied the game at one. 
"We had a little bit of a break down in the flank area," Waldrum said. "We turned the ball over and didn't over quick enough and then the kid made a really good shot." 
Byrnes also scored Villanova's second goal, a shot with less than a minute remaining. It was the first goal the Irish have allowed in the second half of a game this year. 
"I thought we went to sleep instead of finishing the game off," Waldrum said. 
Notre Dame 1, Georgetown 0 
The Irish shut out their 13th opponent of the season Sunday with a 1-0 victory over the Hoyas in Washington, D.C. 
Sophomore Carrie Dew head­ed in a cross from Hanks early in the second half for the game's only goal. 
Georgetown (5-9-5, 2-7-2 Big East) needed a win to have any chance to qualify for the Big East tournament but didn't get it. 
Notes: 
+Waldrum said he will give the team Wednesday and pos­sibly Thursday off from prac­tice in preparation for a Big East tournament game Saturday or Sunday. 
"They need the rest and a chance to catch up on school work," Waldrum said. Notre Dame will have played three games in five days after today.

the last two games) was named Defensive Player of the Week, while senior Dave Brown (48 saves in two games) was award­ed Goaltender of the Week and freshman Kevin Deeth (one goal, two assists) Rookie of the Week. 
"It's great that our guys get attention for what they aceom­plished," Jackson said. "But the weekend's over, everything we accomplished last weekend could be blown out of propor­tion next weekend if we play Army and lose." 
Notre Dame beat Boston College 3-2 with a last-second goal by T.J. Jindra Oct. 22, 2004 at the Joyce Center and shut out the Eagles 1-0 at Kelley Rink the year before. 
"We have to prove the most important part of excellence is consisteney," Jaekson said. "We proved that we ean be a good team this weekend, but we have to prove we can be a great team." 
Notre Dame 7, Boston College 1 
Junior Mark Van Guilder scored his second career hat triek in the Eagles' worst home loss in 12 years. 
Boston College goaltender Cory Schneider made 24 saves and surrendered six goals 

before he was replaced by Joe Pearce. Brown made 26 saves for the Irish, allowing a short­handed goal to Dan Bertram :48 seeonds into the third period to cut the Irish lead to 4-1. 
Notre Dame responded with three third-period goals, one each by Van Guilder -his third of the game -sophomore Erik Condra and freshman Ryan Thang (two goals) to seal the win over the speedy Eagles. 
"I think they had to worry about our speed," Jaekson said. "Our transition game was as good as I've seen it. When we forced one of their turnovers, we countered very quickly. They had a hard time adjusting to our speed sometimes." 
Jackson said the Irish defense was the most important faetor in the blowout vietory, creating numerous turnovers that led to droves of scoring chances. 
The Irish opened up a 4-0 lead by the second intermission on f1rst-period goals by Van Guilder and Thang and second-period tallies by Van Guilder and Deeth. 
Notre Dame was 2-for-11 on the power play, while the penal­ty-kill unit shut down 9-of-10 Boston College power plays. 
Notre Dame 6, Providence 1 
Freshman Dan Kissel pack­aged his first three collegiate goals into a tidy hat trick for the Irish in the Saturday win over Providence. 
The Irish struggled in the first period, scoring a lone goal by Kissel on the power play, but rebounded with a three-goal second period. 
"It's hard to say if we played down to their level," Jackson said. "Hight now, we're not good enough to do that stuff." 
Kissel scored his second goal 
1:15 into the second period and was followed :4 7 later by a rebound put-away from senior Jason Paige, his first goal of the year. Deeth scored later in the period for a 4-1 lead. 
The lone Friars goal came in the second from Colin McDonald, assisted by Niek Mazzolini. Brown had 22 saves. 
Senior Michael Bartlett scored his first of the year and Kissel added his third in the third peri­od for the 6-1 1inal. 
Minnesota State-Mankato 3, Notre Dame 2 (OT) 
The Maverieks defeated the Irish with 14.2 seconds remain­ing in overtime on the power play to take the second game of a series in which Notre Dame took the opener 6-1. 
Irish sophomore Garrett Regan was called for a phantom tripping penalty with 2:02 left in the overtime. Minnesota State forward Jon Kalinski shoveled home the game-winning goal on a down-low backhander over Brown.

tributed one of his two assists for the night on Martin's goal, ran his team-leading assist count to seven. 
Junior forward Joseph Lapira increased his nation­leading goal count to 19 by scoring the team's opening goal in the 32nd minute. It was the seventh consecutive game in which Lapira had scored a goal. 
Sophomore midfielder Cory Rellas. who has seen vastly increased playing time since senior midfielder Ian Etherington injured his leg on Sept. 23, picked up the first of his two assists for the evening on Lapira's goal. Despite his limited playing time, Rellas now has five assists on the season, second only to Norman's seven. 
"Since [getting more playing time]. Cory has come on and really established himself as a very solid player," Clark said. "He's getting better every week as his confidence has grown, and that's the exciting thing." 
West Virginia 2, Notre Dame 1 
By defeating then-No. 6 Notre Dame 2-1 Wednesday evening at Dirk Dlesk Soccer Stadium in Morgantown, No. 4 West Virginia not only snapped Notre Dame's seven game winning streak, but they also ended the Irish's run for the No. 1 seed in the Big East tournament. 
The loss left Notre Dame four points behind the Mountaineers -a difference the team could not make up with only one game remaining on the regular season sched­ule. 
The Irish started the game positively as Rellas tallied his first career goal for Notre Dame, scoring in the 4th minute. Freshman midfielder Michael Thomas slipped the Lapira to an open Thomas ball through the defense to who deposited the ball at the Rellas to pick up his second back post. The goal was assist on the season. Thomas's third of the season,

Notre Dame 1, Connecticut 
0 

Notre Dame closed out its regular season with a 1-0 win over No. 14 Connecticut in front of 3,831 fans at Joseph 
J. Morrone Stadium Saturday evening. 
It was Notre Dame's second ever win at Connecticut and its first win in Storrs since 1986. With the victory, Notre Dame locked up the No. 3 seed in the Big East tourna­ment as the Irish finished with 24 points in Big East play one behind Connecticut and four behind West Virginia. 
The only goal of the game was scored in the 65th minute by Thomas. Senior defender Ryan Miller sent a cross into the box that was flicked on by played well 
all year, 

but the niee thing is that now he's been rewarded with some goals." 
With the shutout, Cahill held an opponent scoreless for the ninth time on the season, and he improved his record to 11­3-1. 
Notre Dame now will begin preparing for post-season play which begins Wednesday night when the Irish take on DePaul in the first round of the Big East tournament, and Notre Dame will draw on their past three games to aid their preparation. 
"All three games were like NCAA tournament games," Clark said. "They were hard, competitive, tough games. They were fun experiences for the boys to wrap up the sea­son." 
Note: 
+By failing to score against West Virginia, Lapira was held without a goal for the first time in seven games, but he held onto his national lead in both goals (19) and points (41).

Notre Dame 3, DePaul 0 
The lrL<>h defeated DePaul 30-22, 30-16, :~0-1 0 at home behind nine­kill performances from freshmen Christina Kaelin and Serinity Phillips. 
Junior captain Adrianna Stasiuk led the team in digs with 11. 
The Irish dominated the first game and never relinquished the lead, ending the game on a 3-0 run. 
A kill from Kaelin put DePaul down two games, and a 10-point stretch on the serve by freshman Jamel Nicholas ended the third game and completed the sweep. 
"I felt like we had a good start to fhll break and played at a high level to takH us into Hawaii," Brown said. 
Hawaii 3, Notre Dame 0 
Sophomore Mallorie Croalled the IrL<>h in a losing ellort with 11 kill<> in the 27-30, 26-30, 27-30 loss. 
Stasiuk had nine kill<> and fresh­man Kim Kristoff had six blocks while the Rainbow Wahine snapped a six-game Irish win streak. Junior Ashley Tarutis led the team in assist<> with 22. 
Hawaii sophomore Jamie Houston had 18 kills and put an end to Irish comeback<> in each of the games with timely kills. Houston rallied the Wahine from a three-point deficit with three kill<> in a 6-0 run to take the match with a sweep. 
"We got better," Brown said. "I do think we learned a lot. I don't think we played great, it was a little bit more high error than what we needed to be to win." 
Hawaii 3, Notre Dame 1 
The Irish took one game against the Rainbow Wahine 28-30, 25-30, 30-22, 23-30 and were led by soph­omore Justine Stremick, who had 14 kills. 
After dropping two close games, the Irish rallied in the third game to tied 2-2. Joel Hanson and Kael Mouilllierat put the Mavericks up 2-1 with goals in the second period, before Deeth knotted it. 
Brown had 13 saves in the loss.

take their first lead, on a kill from Kristoff, and eventually the game. The team went on a 10-2 run after the scored was tied at 20-20 to make the seore 2-1. 
The Irish opened up a 13-11 lead in the fourth game, but Hawaii ral­lied back for the lead and put the game away with a 7-2 game-win­ning streteh. 
Notre Dame 3, Connecticut 0 
Phillips led the Irish in kills with 16 and the tnam won at home 30­12, 30-24, 30-27 Friday. 
The lrL'ih were helped in the first game by four attack errors from the Huskies and kill<> from Stremick and Croat. Kristoff finished the match with a five-serve stretch. 
"We came out and played a really good game one, really steady and played a good match overall," Brown said. 
Stasiuk ended the second game with a kill and the Irish took the match in the third game off a Huskies attack error. 
St. John's 3, Notre Dame 0 
Stasiuk left the match in the first game with an ankle sprain and the Irish fell to the undefeated Red Storm 30-32, 24-30, 22-30. 
"Losing Adrianna is huge for us," Brown said. "She is a primary pass­er and takes a huge offensive load, and it's not that Megan [Fesl] can't or didn't do a great job -she did a good job. We're just not used to having that leadership off the court." 
The Irish dropped a close first game after several kills from the Red Storm's Latoya Blunt squashed a late rally. 
"One of the things we talked about before playing this team is that every match that they've won -which is a whole bunch -they win the first game," Brown said. "I think we felt like it was really important to come out with a really good start and win the first game and put them in a position they're not used to being in." 
The Red Storm never trailed in the second game and trailed only briefly in the third game as it com­pleted the sweep and took control of first place.

HOCKEY 
Irish jump to No. 11 with victory over BC 
By KYLE CASSILY Sporrs Writer 
Notre Dame played the David to Boston College's Goliath ­again -and upset the No. 1 Eagles 7-1 Friday in Chestnut Hill, Mass., the third time in three straight games the Irish have knocked off a top-ranked Eagles squad. 
"It's a big step for us," Irish coach Jeff Jackson said. ''I'm happy with what we did this weekend -it's a sign of where we can be, what we can be." 
The Irish (3 -1-0) defeated Providence College 6-1 Saturday to sweep their two­game tour of the Hockey East, but lost 3-2 with seconds remaining in overtime Oct. 14 

Giant killers 
at Minnesota State-Mankato to split that two-game series. 
With the Boston College blowout -the ninth time in its history that Notre Dame has beaten a No. 1-ranked team ­and the Providence win, the Irish went from unranked to No. 11 in Monday's USA Today/American Hockey Magazine Top 15. It is the high­est the team has been ranked since it finished the 2003-04 season at No. 12 after a NCAA Tournament loss to Minnesota. 
"Let's be realistic about that," Jackson said. "It's October and there's still 12-15 teams today ahead of us, and that doesn't mean there won't be more tomorrow."

Notre Dame fell out of first place in the Big East with a 3-0 loss to St. John's at home Sunday in a battle of the league unbeaten.'>. 
It was the final match of five games Notre Dame played over fall break. The Irish (13-8, 7-1 Big East) went 2-3, sweeping DePaul and Connecticut but suffering back-to-hack losses to No. 16 Ilawaii.

Offense gears up for battle against DePaul 
Team wins 2 offinal 3 regular season games 
By GREG ARBOGAST Sports Writer 
Playing possibly its toughest three games of the season in a span of eight days, No. 6 Notre Dame more than held its own last week, picking up wins over Providence and No. 14 Connecticut while falling to No. 4 West Virginia. 
"We could have won all three games," Irish coach Bobby Clark said. "We played well at West Virginia, but we didn't follow through with our chances." 
The results leave Notre Dame's record at 12-4-2 (8-3-0 Big East) at the conclusion of the regular season. 
With its 24 points, Notre Dame locked up the No. 3 seed in the Big East tournament, which begins Wednesday night when the Irish take on DePaul at Alumni Field. Notre Dame defeated the Blue Demons 3-0 in South Bend Sept. 10 in the teams' only meeting this sea­son. 
Notre Dame 3, Providence 0 
The Irish started the week with a decisive victory over Providence Oct. 14, running their winning streak to a sea­son-high seven games -the program's longest since an eight-game streak in 2003. 
The victory left Notre Dame, who entered the game tied with Providence in the confer­ence standings, in sole posses­sion of second place in the Big East's Blue Division one point behind both Connecticut and West Virginia. 
With their shutout of the Friars, the Irish held their opponent scoreless for the fifth time in six games and ninth time for the season. Despite the impressive statistics, Clark downplayed the result. 
"It was not an easy 3-0 game," Clark said. "Until we scored in the final minute, we felt we were still in a game. It was a good clear win, but it wasn't a blowout." 
Junior forward Kurt Martin scored the pivotal goal on a blistering shot with only 26 seconds remaining in the game. It was Martin's first goal on the season. Senior midfield­er Nate Norman, who con-

Irish prepare for playoffs 

Team looks to finish regular season strong 
By CHRIS KHOREY Associate Spores Editor 

Notre Dame is one game away from an unbeaten regu­lar season. 
After going 3-0-1 during fall break, the Irish take on Cincinnati tonight on the road in a makeup of Sept. 22's game that was cancelled due to lightning. 
No. 1 Notre Dame (16-0-1, 9-0-1 Big East) won three road contests last week, beat­ing Providence 5-0 Oct. 15, Villanova 4-2 Friday and Georgetown 1-0 Sunday. The Irish also tied Connecticut 0-0 Oct. 13.
