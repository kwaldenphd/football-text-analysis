Tongsun Park details payments 
WASHINGTON (AP] -Tongsun Park said yesterday he paid a total of !750,000 to U.S. congressmen ­!300,000 to !400,000 in political contributions and the rest in busi­ness deals 
Park told reporters after com­pleting initial questioning by House ethics committee investi­gators that he told probers of no new names of congressmen who got some of his money. 
Park was questioned for the 
committee's investigation into G h 
alleged South Korean influence 
buying but he reportedly insisted to 
the end that he paid all the money 
as a foreign rice dealer and not as 
an agent to buy influence in 
Congress for Seoul. 
He told U.S. prosecutors in Seoul 
in January that he made payments 
to about 30 congressmen. His 
lawyer, William Hundley, said his 
testimony to the House investi­
gators was the same as that in 
Seoul. 
Park told a news conference that 
he paid "about !300,000 to 
!400,000" in campaign and other 
types of contributions to congress­
men. He said his total payments 
were !750,000, saying "that's 
including payments I possibly 
made to certain business relation­
ships I had with the congressmen." 
Park allegedly told House investigators of payments approaching !200,000 to former Rep. Otto E. Passman, D-La., and about 1100,000 to former Rep.. Richard T. Hanna, D-Calif., reliable sources said. 
He told U.S. prosecutors in Seoul that he considered the payment to

are important because they must

behind the candidates are impor­
tant also." It is those people "I 
wou[d like to thank," he stated. 
Schlageter wished McKenna and Roohan the "best of luck" and stated he thought they would "do a good job." He noted that it was a "clean election, with capable people running, and it showed the student body that there are things which need to be done." 
"Knowing that I would lose before the campaign began, I would still do it again," Schlageter reflected. "It takes a certain person to run for SBP, and you have to believe in yourself and put your heart in and go all the way." 
"The experience gave me the opportunity to grow in a way which I wouldn't have been able to grow. You learn alot about yourself,'' he said. 
McKenna pointed out that he is the second McKenna to be Student Body President at Notre Dame. Phil McKenna, his uncle, became Student Body President on March 14, 1969. McKenna's cousin was vice-President in 1966.

Painter and educator James Gahagan will discuss current art trends during a lecture at 2 p.m. Sunday in the Notre Dame Art Gallery. The program is sponsored by the Gallery and the Art Depart­ment and is open to the public without charge. 
A member of the faculty at Pratt Institute, Columbia University and Goddard College, Gahagan's abstract expressionist art works have been exhibited in the Museum of Modern Art, the Whit­ney, the Guggenheim and other major museums. 
Notre Dame's Gallery is cur­rently exhibiting photographs of 
W. Eugene Smith, masterworks from the permanent collection, African traditional art and Amer­ican Indian art. The O'Shaugh­nesssy Hall facility is open until 5 
p.m. daily and from 7 to 9 pm 
A knowledgeable source said earlier that Park told the investi­gators he gave campaign contri­butions totaling nearly !100,000 to former Rep. Cornelius Gallagh«<r, D-N.J., in 1970 and 1971. Galla­gher chaired the House Far East subcommittee at that time. 
Gallagher, who has been men­tioned in previous stories, has refused to make any public com­ment but his lawyer has said he did nothing wrong. 
Special Counsel Leon Jaworski told reporters as Park's closed door questioning drew to a close that it "by and large has been revealing." 
Jaworski said he could not estimate how many congressmen might be recommended for disci­plinary action as a result of Park's testimony.

Student cracks computer security system

On the weekend of February 25, a student was able to bypass the computer security system at the Computing Center by feeding false credentials from a master text into an IBM 370-158 computer, accord­ing to R. Brian Walsh, director of the Computing Center.

"But," he added, "if others with less capabilities were to do so, the system would be badly abused."

Carter orders miners to work 
WASHINGTON [AP) -President Carter appealed to striking coal miners yesterday to obey a back-to­work court order and said a crisi could be .averted if a "moderate number" go back to the mines. 
He said he has absolutely no plans to seek authority for the federal government to seize the struck mines, which h~~os been urged by many strikers in.the hope that the government will give them better terms than those offered by the mine owners. 
Carter said he has ordered Attorney General Griffin Bell to direct enforcement of the order, which was expected to prohibit picketing or interference with deli­veries of coal or with miners who want to return to work. 
And he said it is his firm belief that miners will obey the law and return to work. 
A federal judge later ordered the 
striking miners back to work, .----------------------------­

About the same time, it was

"I believe the coal miners to be partiotic and law~abiding citizens; and I believe that a substantial portion, an adequate proportion of them will comply with the law," Carter said. 
In his fifth news conference this year, Carter also said he has no intention of trying to pressure Israeli Prime Minister Menachem

The authority to pull the plug on violators was contained in the ct· 'ailment plan announced last rr nth by the Public Service Com­m ssion. In addition, the Commis­si n authorized a ten percent -per-kilowat-hour surcharge for co­mercia! customers who exceeded their power allotment.

even though the overall coopera­tion has \been good," said Robert Norris, a spokesman for PSI, which implemented the cutbacks Feb. 20. There are several hundred throughout the PSI system who haven't reached the 25 percent reduction set for businesses, he said. 
"We try to work with them to achieve the reductions. Some of them haven't wanted '\o do their part," Norris said. "We don't want to shut anyone off until everything has been done. But in most cases, I think it is a case\of being unwilling." . \ 
So far, PSI -which serves 498,000 customers in 69 counties -­has not imposed the surcharge on excessive energy users.

of them  were  very  close  to  full  
compliance."  
Widenhofer  said  those  firms  

represented just a fraction of the 
1

utility's 100,000 commercial and industrial users who generally have 
managed to reach the curtailments. 
The I&M letter warned that those firms will have one week to cut back or face disconnection. It read, in part, "In monitoring your account, we have found you were not in compliance. We certainly don't want to subject you to monetary penalties or disconnec­tion. But if you are not in compliance within seven days, we will have no other choice than disconnection.'' 
"We are very pleased with the way that people are responding, " Widenhofer added, pointing to an overall 20-25 percent reduction in consumption. 
Hoosier Energy, the third utility under the PSC cutback order, has not experienced any problems with non-compliance, said operations manager Robert Ross. 
"We don't serve any reatil customers, so the penalties would be imposed by the distribution cooperatives," he said. 
Hoosier Energy provides elctrici­ty to 17 rural power cooperatives in 22 southern Indiana counties.

Chaplin coffin still missing 
CORSIER SUR VEVEY, Swltzer­lanci [AP] -A Europe-wide search fot the body of Charlie Chaplin has turned up nothing and Swiss investigators said yesterday they are mystified over the theft of the coffirl from the village cemetery here a week ago. 
Initial theories that the theft of the oak coffin and body might have been the work of extortionists seem less likely now because no ransom demand has been received, inves­tigators said. ·  'No one has contacted the family or the authorities up to now," said Magistrate Jean-Daniel Tenthorey, who is beading the inquiry. "I suppose one must be surprised that nothing has yet developed after exactly one week. 
"We had one specific piece of information which was followed up in Italy but without results," Tenthorey said, declining to elabo­rate. He said the probe also has extended to Chaplin's native Eng­land following speculation that some fans had taken the body there in a perverse gesture of admira-. 
tion. "But there is nothing new," he ' said. 
Chaplin, who died Christmas morning at the age of 88, moved to this small village overlooking Lake Geneva in 1952. He starred in many American silent films and early "talkies," portraying the cane-twirling "Little Tramp." He left an estate which has been estimated at as much as $100 million. Local reports said royalties are still coming in at a rate of $13.3 million a year. 
Investigators theorize that at least three strong men must have sneaked into the walled cemetery sometime during the night of March 1 and March 2 and used picks nd1 shovels to dig up the grave. The thieves apparently dragged the 325-pound coffin and body to a waiting vehicle. 
Police continue to receive about 50 telephone calls a day from people with tips and suggestions. Several callers reported strange odors emanating from abandoned houses. And one man said he found, with the aid of a divining rod, pieces of earth from the Chaplin grave near a 6,000-foot high Alpine peak. The man's proposal to launch an extensive search of the area was not followed up. 
"I am not superstitious," said Tenthorey. "I have been in this business for 20 years and I think I know what and what not to believe." 
Corsier, a wine-growing village of 2,000 with a breath-taking view of Lake Geneva and the Alps, continues to buzz. Most residents still cling to the belief that the robbers eventually will make a demand for ransom. 
Chaplin's widow, Ona, daughter of playwright Eugene O'Neill, has declined to speak to the press and statements attributed to her in newspapers have been described as "complete fabrication" by family lawyer Jean-Felix Paschoud. 
A security guard has been posted at the entrance to the sprawling, 37-acre estate to keep out univited visitors. 
Soviets propose bomb treaty 
. GENEVA, Switzerland [AP] -The. '·-oviet Union proposed an interna­dt\nali treaty yesterday to outlaw ttle ~tron bomb and was prompt­ly accused of hypocrisy by the Cnited States in one of the sharpest East-West confrontations in recent years at the Geneva disarmament conference. 
Introducing the draft treaty to the 35-nation conference, Soviet chief delegate Victor I. !Likhachev said Moscow might take "retaliatory measures" if the "barbaric" weap­on is introduced into the Western arsenal. 
Likhachev said the neutron bomb would pose a threat to detente and "seriously undermine the belief of the peoples . . . in the success of ongoing disarmament negotia tions."

WHC Workshop 


to feature 
Timothy Smith 
Timothy Smith, director of the Interfaith Center for Corporate Responsibility, National Council of Churches, will be the featured speaker at the World Hunger Coalition's workshop this Sunday at 1 p.m. in the Library Auditor-· ium. The theme of Smith's lecture is  'Corporate Investments, South African Apartheid, and ND". 
The purpose of Sunday's work­shop is to educate the ND-SMC community to the suggestions of several developmental economists that certain multinational . corpor­ations have operated in less developed countries to the detri­ment of these countries. Included in the format for the workshop is a. film on racism in South Africa, "There is No Crisis," and a panel discussion on the effects of corporate multinationalism in South Africa. 
Professor Jlllmes Stewart will provide a short bacqround on South Africa and ProCessor Van Esterit. will do a case study of nestle in the Third World. 
"some plain talk which will not be pleasant talk." 
He said the months-long Soviet campaign against the neutron wea­pon focused only on one aspect of the arms race, and he challenged the Soviets to discuss their new . SS-20 multi-warhead missile, which is capable of striking any target in Europe "and which is now being deployed·in large numbers." 
"We have heard the Soviet re­presentative .. . speak of the in­humanity and barbarity of the neutron bomb," Fisher said. "But I fear that we would wait in vain to hear them speak of the humanity and barbarity of the nuclear wea­pons in the Soviet arsenal, some of which are as much as 20,000 times more powerful." 
He called the Soviet move a "one-sided propaganda excer­cise." 
The confrontation reflected a -"markedly frostier atmosphere" in· the 16-year-old Geneva conference, noted one Western diplomatic sou­rce. But he said it would not necessarily have an impact on the slow-moving Soviet-American stra­
tegic arms limitation negotiations ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~::: 
or other East-West arms control talks. 
The neutron bomb is becoming an increasingly vulnerable point in America's defense plans, however, because some of its European allies are uneasy about possible deploy­ment of the weapon on their soil. 
The controversy has shaken West Germany's ruling Social Demo­cratic Party and led to the resigna­tion of the Dutch defense minister, who opposes the bomb and was subsequently supported by a ma­jority in the Dutch Parliament. 
President Carter has not yet decided whether to deploy the weapon and says his decision will be made in consultation with the NATO allies. 
The neutron bomb is a small warhead that would be place on Lance missiles and artiiiery shells. It produces twice the deadly radia­tion of a conventional nuclear bomb but less than a tenth as much explosive power, heat and fallout. This means the bomb can kiii people while causing little damage to buildings.

Six hijackers free 
NEW YORK [AP] -Six fugi­tives wanted for hijacking airliners to Cuba between 1969 and 1971 were supposed to be returned to the United States yesterday; but Air Canada officials refused to allow them on board a flight from Havana to Montreal, airline officials said. 
The FBI had siad the six would be flown to Montreal, where U.S. marshals would join them for a flight to New York's Kennedy Airport. FBI agents were stationed at Ken­nedy to arrest the six. 
But when the Air Canada flight touched down at Mon­treal last night, the six men were not aboard. 
Airline officials, Canadian police and the FBI said they did not know where the men were. 
Later, however, Air Can­ada's security chief at Mirabel Airport, Ed Johnson, said the airline was not satisfied with the security measures and refused to allow the fugitives to board in Havana. 
"The company was asked to carry the six from Havana to Montreal," Johnson said from the airport, 35 miles northwest of Montreal. ··'The airline was not given any more informa­tion except that they were called expatriates. You can call them what you like. We're caught in the middle of this one." 
He said Air Canada repre­sentatives went to Cuba to evaluate the situation earlier yesterday and concluded that security measures were inade­quate. 
The FBI, which had pre­pared a news conference near Kennedy Airport to herald the voluntary return of the six accused men, said the plan had not been "perfected for all partie» concerned." An FBI spokesman said the State Department had handled arrangements. 
However, a State Depart­ment spokesman, Ken Brown, said the department's only part in the plan was to obtain travel documents for the six. He would not comment on Air Canada's refusal to allow the men aboard the Havana to Montreal flight.

Arsonists purge· Balboa Park Weekend marriages 

SAN DIEGO [AP]  Police on foot 
and on bicycles patrolled the lush

renee after the famous Old Globe Theater, home of an annual Shakes peare festival, was destroyed Wednesday by fire. Two weeks ago, the Aero-Space Museum and its collection of flying machines, many of the irreplaceable antiques, was burned down. 
Mayor Pete Wilson annonunce a $5,000 reward for capture of the arsonists. The city's two news­papers, the Union and the Evening Tribune, each posted rewards of $2,500. 
"This whole town is grieving and plenty mad," said one of the hundreds of residents who came to the park Wednesday after word of the Old Globe fire spread. 
Yesterday another tenant of the park, the world-famed San Diego Zoo, which tumbles over 100 acres of semitropical terrain, ordered its workers to take special security precautions. So did administrators of other park museums and thea­ters, all crowded daily by tourists. 
Balboa Park is the second oldest major park in America, having 
been  established  in  1868,  three  
years  after  New  York's  Central

that plagued New York during that city's latest blackout, and most residents here were goo-natured about the inconvenience. 
Capt. Art Robertson, an arson investigator, said the arsonists who set fire to the theater were not the same ones who started the Aero-Space fire. Both fires were said to be started by teen-age youths, but descriptions of them by passersby differed in the two incidents, he said. 
He said the ''Aero-Space Museum fire may have been set just to do malicious mischief," but in the case of the Globe, "They meant to get the building in this one." 
Meanwhile, plans were under · way to rebuild the Aero-Space Museum in the park's Ford Build­ing. Contributions were already pledged from airplane collections throughout the nation. 
A spokesman for the Old Globe said it would be rebuilt and this summer's festival would go on. 
Falling dollar hurts Gls 
Americans receive aid 
AUGSBURG, West Germany [AP)-Hundreds of West Germans have sent money to a fund for low-ranking Gls strapped by the fall of the dollar following a nationwide TV' program that reported their plight, an Army chaplain said yesterday. 
Col. Frank E. Deese, a Baptist chaplain at this post in south Germany, told The Associated Press he set up the fund Feb. 23 at a German bank to solicit contribu­tions from German civilians and 
U.S. military families. 
With the money, Deese plans to buy a van to provide free transpor­tation to low-cost military commis­saries, PXs and hospitals for GI families who cannot afford cars. 
A local newspaper published a story on the fund, and last Tuesday a national TV network broadcast a report on Deese's project. After the film report, the announcer said the station had been flooded with calls from people asking where they could send contributions. 
"That night I had to keep an interpretc;_r by the telephone until midnight," Deese said. "The next

day we had to take on another German-speaking girl to help handle the calls. Cats came in from all over Germany.'' 
As of yesterday the account had grown to $2,067 and other calls had promised more donations, Deese said. 
"Most of the callers say they are distressed at where the dollar is in relation to the mark, and they want to help," he said. "I have a great deal of respect and admiration for the German people, but I must say they came through more I had expected. I haven't received a single negative call." 
Emmi Schaller, the chaplain's German secretary, said some callers offered to sponsor American families by sending monthly dona­tions. Other offered to donate old cars. 
"One elderly lady offered to send $25 a month to a needy family 
for  as  long  as  they  were  in  
Germany," she said.

AMHERST, Mass. [AP] -The weekend marriage, once an arrangement limited mostly to movie stars and traveling sales­men, is now a challenge faced by a growing number of professional couples. 
John and Adelle Simmons, for example, have been married 12 years. They have good jobs and two children. 
But for the past five years they have lived in different cities, seeing each other only on weekends. 
She is president of Hampshire College, a progressive liberal arts institution in western Massachu­setts. He is an economist for the World Bank in Washington, D.C. 
"When we started this I felt as if I were embarking on a grand experiment," said Simmons, 39. 
The Simmonses meet almost every weekend -occasionally in Washington, but usually at their home in Amherst. 
"If you only have weekends together, you don't let the little

things bother you," said Mrs. 
Simmons, 35. 
When there are children in the 
family, having both spouses at 
home can become almost a mini­
vacation. 
"Last night, for instance, our 1-year-old daughter was sick,'' said Mrs. Simmons. "So John spent half the night up with her, and I spent the other half." 
The weekend couple lifestyle is tied in with the American dream of career advancement. 
"Mobility is a fact of life," shrugged Howard Garrison, a pro­fessor at Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond. 
Last year Garrison and his wife Dana split up their wordly goods, loaded a trailer and moved Mrs. Garrison to Chapel Hill, N.C., where she was enrolled at the University of North Carolina. 
"There was a lot of driving in between each weekend," he said. "But when we got together it was very exciting, very intense." 
families?' I tell them to please trust me as the chaplain and just send the money to the account," he said. "I'll make sure it gets to the people who need it." 
Since the beginning of 1976, the dollar has plummeted from about 
2.60 marks to about 2.03 marks, although private individuals receive less than that in exchang­ing their money at the banks. The dollar's slide in value against most of the world's major currencies is a reflection of the United States economic problems -inflation, high unemployment and a trade deficit of $26.7 billion in 1977, experts say. 
The dollar's fall hits hardest on low-ranking Gls with families, who do not qualify for free government housing and must live in German apartments.

Sewell criticizes modern society 
by Kate Flynn Staff Reporter 

"The modem world is dying for lack of magic," claimed visiting professor Elizabeth Sewell during a series of public lectures Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday even­ings. "Present-day psuedo­scientific, techno-analytic, manipu­lative methods of education have nothing to do with thinking or imagining. Is this deliberate or accidental?" she asked. 
Sewell presented three lectures sponsored by the English Depart­ment on the theme of "Oculus Imagionatis: The Way of High Magic" to capacity crowds in Hayes Healey Auditorium. She is presently teaching at Notre Dame after a brief term at the University of North Carolina. 
Sewe .. 's three lectures focused on the Platonic and Pythagorean tradition of cosmology, memory systems and the image of the theatre, and literary imagination as an alternative to the present linear or strictly rational methods of empiricism might have extraordin-

Elizabeth Sewell discussed the place of imagination and magic in society before a capacity crowd. 
Play recalls town's musician 
WELLS, Mlnn.[AP]-No black 
people live in Wells anymore, so a professional actor has been hired to help celebrate the turn-of-the-cen­tury life and times of Harry L. 1Gillam, this prarie town's one man 
music man. 
The play, slated for a three night run through Saturday in the higli school auditorium, features a cast of 80 of the town's 2,800 residents, ranging in age from 8 to 85. 
Children dressed as chickens and cows prance through a farmers on stage dream, while farm boys with, pitch forks sing the praises of farm fragrances: 
"Manure! Manure!" they sing. ''Oh in the air you get a sniff of it, a definite whiff of it. Manure is just a fancy name for something we call .... " Loud music drowns out the final word. 
The play, called "A Common Feeling" is loosely based on the life of Gillam, who moved to this southern Minnesota town from Detroit in 1899 and lived there until his death in 1929 at the age of 57. He and his wife were Wells' only black residents. 
Gillam is being played by Danny Clark of Minneapolis, the only professional actor in the cast. 
Some peope still remember Gil­lam's candy store and his "panito­rium" where he sponged and pressed suits. But they especially remember his music. He gave lessons to children on all instru­ments, $10 for 24 lessons, and set up bands in several nearby towns.

ary powers of healing for an ailing society. 
''Society is in an appalling situation. We have become atomized , we have ruined our institutions. Our twentieth century snobbery tells us we know more 
'than the poets, the alchemists. Actually we know a great deal less. We are trained so silently and sedulously that there are great gulfs of ignorance withing our­selves," she said. 
Sewell termed "high magic", the theme of her lectures, as having nothing to do with black art, sorcery, witchcraft or the occult. Instead, she explained it as a power or catalyst illiciting the "genius" or daimon which exists in the individual. She urged that one should tum inward to the universe of his mind -to the reservoir of inherently powerful images which have something to say to us. 
"The Renaissance went forward by going backwards. Somehow I feel that a treasury has been lost to us -you might feel it too," Sewell suggested in pointing out the merits of "high magic" disciplines which modern education ignores. 
The Eye of the Imagination, the eye that looks without and within, she characterized as having power to reach the real universe -the world of "ET EST NON" -it is and it is not. Sewell relied on the

Sewell said she was apprenticed before Blake and the Renaissance mystic Gordono Bruno, she said, 'The first aim of education is to excite power.' She cited Circe, the goddess who could turn men into beasts, as the most notable exam­ple of an image that has the power to stir great imaginings. 


She expressed pleasure at being able to use the woman image, Circe, as most mega-images are men, and continued, "The Sund woman's transformational powers affect not only dreams, the individ­uals mind and the mids of others, but also have powere over things, matter ... the natural world." 
''The power of transformation, magic, is operative in its aims and intentions. There's no question about it. This is its original and close connections with science ­that it is operative in the actual world. This is the great doctrine of metamorphosise," she said. 
Sewell added that the whole alchemical tradition, which has been lost by the moderns, is another aspect of the transforma­tion of the universe. She claimed that alchemy not only represents what happens in the soul, but what happens in the world. Even Isaac newton, a practicing alchemist, speaks of the universe as transfor­mational when he wrote that bodies transform light and light into bodies, she pointed out.

In short, Sewell said she beleives that mind does affect matter, and cited psychokinesis as proof. She said, although science is aware of this, it has chosen to ignore the phenomenon, as it is incapable of dealing with it at the present time. 
Sewell urged that modern methods of education should expunge all conceptions of the universe which view it as one of rigid linear courses, rivalry, comp­etition, random atoms and hostil. ity. 
"Think of the universe which is harmonious, correspondant -one in which everything resonates into everything else, the universe of the rnonchord, the universe of love which moves the sun, the universe of music without and within. The poets are aware of this. The images of the mind can move out to have universal meaning," she stressed. 
Professor Sewell received her doctorate from Cambridge Univer­sity and holds honorary degrees from St. Peter's College in New jersey and Fordham University. The author of three novels and three volumes of poetry, she has also published numerous works of criticiam, including The Structure of Poetry, Paul Valery: The Mind In the Mirror, The field of Nonsense, The Orphic Voice:Poetry and Natural IDstory, and The Haman Metaphor.

iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii_. art buchwald 
Washington--President Carter's 
long-awaited civil service reforms 
have finally been unveiled and, like 
most of Mr. Carter's plans, they 
sound swell on paper. The 
President wants to get the govern­
ment on a more businesslike foot­
ing by rewarding those who do a 
good job with merit raises and by 
punishing those who do a bad job 
with dismissal. He would also 
protect whistle blowers who, by 
going public, embarrass their 
bosses and find themselves booted 
out in the street. 
All well and good. So what's the 
problem? The problem is that no 
one, including the President, Con­
gress and the Supreme Court, has 
ever defined exactly what a govern­
ment employee should do. There 
are job descriptions in the civil 
service regulations, but since the 
government is not a profit-making 
organization it is almost impossible 
to accurately measure a civil ser­
vant's productivity. 
For example, I work in a building 
on Pennsylvania Ave. in which six 
of the 13 floors are rented to a 
government agency. Since I am 
located on the thirteenth floor I 
come into contact with government 
employees every day. Some are 
going from the sinh floor to the 
seventh. Others from the second to 
the tenth and still others from the 
fifth to the ninth. They are always 
carrying official-looking papers in 
their hands so I have to assume 
they are doing something very 
important. 
The question is, are government employees who move up and down in the elevator and whiz to and fro more productive than those who sit in their offices reading The Washington Post funnies? 
The elevator rider, you may say, is giving us a bigger bang for our buck. He or she is engaged in the nation's business of writing new regulations, interpreting old ones, sending out memoranda, stamping classified material, setting up com­mittees, turning out reports and doing all the things expected from a servant of the people. 
So surely he or she should be given a raise and a promotion. 
Perhaps. But the elevator rider is also the person making the government more unwiedly and 
impossible to control. By going 
from the second floor to the tenth ·he or she may be responsible for a 
new regulation putting 10,000 
people out of work, making a 
national park into a coal mine or 
giving the go-ahead on a new 
missile that will never fly. 
A short trip from the fifth to the 
sixth floor by an innocent-looking 
chap with a pipe clamped in his 
mouth could cost every man, 
woman and child in this country 
$165. 
After traveling up and down the 
capital's elevators for 16 years, I 
have come to the sad conclusion 
that those government employees 
doing the most work in Washington 
are also doing the most damage. 
Therefore, before I go along with 
Carter's reform package he's going 
to have to spell out exactly what he 
expects government employees to 
do for--their salaries. My fear is 
that, by instituting a merit system 
and causing government emplo­
yees to compete against each other, 
the President will not reduce but 
add to all the red tape he said he 
was going to eliminate when he 
became President. 
If employee Brown submits a 
10-page regulation on the amount 
of whipped cream permitted in an 
Amaretto liqueur, will employee 
Guggenheim write a 20-page regu­
lation to outdo him? 
Compared to other countries, the bureaucrats in the United States have been like a sleeping giant. But if you threaten them with demotion and dangle financial incentives in front of them, they could become an aroused beast, prepared to regulate anything that gets in their way. 
Before it approves the Carter Administration's reform package I believe Congress should ask itself the following questions: 
l--Is a government employee who puts in an honest day's work making any worthwhile contribu­tion to society? 
2--By taking an elevator from one floor to another is a bureaucrat saving us money or merely wasting the country's energy? 
3--If you fire all the drones in the government and keep only the overachievers, who will be left to blame when a giant federal pro­gram fails and goes down the tube? 






SMC Candidates Comment 
Darragh-Pope-Carden 
We would like to contest the validity of 
the editorial board's endorsement on the 
basis of its ambiguous and unqualified 
assessment of our assumed capabilities. 
The value judgements made in the 
article seem superfluous and self-contra­
dictory. Formulation of a "comprehensive 
platform" should be the major respecter of 
candidate qualification. Lack of experience 
need not be a detrimental factor and should 
not be assumed as such. It has not in any 
way impaired the effectiveness of the previous administration. Coupled with this is the ensured experience that will be gained during an extensive initiation period with the current officers. This assumed liability was further qualified as a "serious" one, hindering our campaign on the basis of magnified and ungrounded assumptions. 
The only -two areas cited as nebulous concerned "realization of the potential we see in the student body'' and the 21 Oub developments. ''Realization...student body" is an intended abstraction expressly set forth to incorporate the overall ideal of the campaign. It is a concept articulated to set the tone for our administration. It was never meant to be a manifesto expressing specific solid action. We felt that our intended concrete activities were suffi­ciently contained within our stipulated platform. 
As for the statement concerning the 21 Oub, we based our "uncertainty" on lack of data. Due to the novelty of the 21 Club, conclusive results concerning its success will not be available for some time. In addition, as candidates, we have no jurisdiction to wield concerning the policies of the Oub. Therefore, we could not effectively speculate on the future of the 21 Oub. 
We feel that the coverage given us by the editorial board was neither conclusive nor valid. As a result of the editorial, we feel 1 our campaign has been hindered without due cause. We hope that any possible damage wrought by these faulty assumptions can be thwarted by our enthusiasm and hard work. 

Tuohy-Wixted-Mullaney 
This is not our final statement; there is nothing final about the needs of the Saint Mary's students. On the contrary, an active Student Body always has needs. 
We only begin to work: for and represent Saint Mary's students with a statement of our platform. In action next year, our platform will match the activities of the students it promises to represent. 
Already implemented are such activities and issues as the SMC 21-Club, continued expansion of SMC Career Development Office, and the Rape Awareness Seminars. We support these issues and ·activities and accept the challenge to maintain them. 
Our platform seeks to discover and work: for the needs of the Saint Mary's students. We want Saint Mary's students to know and appreciate the power and the duties of the Student Assembly; it is a powerful Student Government body that is under­played. We will encourage and implement interaction between SMC and ND Student Governments; cooperative ventures tend to be very successful. We want our students to know about and join Saint Mary's clubs and organizations not because they are forced to, but because they know what opportunities are available for them. We want to research and compile an inform­ative guide for Saint Mary's students who want to know more about the college they attend. We plan to appoint an R.A. who will represent the R.A. Staff at Board of Governance meetings. The presence of and R.A. at these meetings will open communication between dormitory resi­dents and Student Government. 
Again, this is not our final statement. It will take your vote to activate not only our platform but our efforts for you, the Saint Mary's students.

~iiiiiiiiiiiiiii P..0. BOX Q 
Another side 
of the Grace 
eviction 

Dear Editor: 
I would like to respond to the 
letter in Wednesday's Observer 
wherein Stephen M. Dane and 
John J. Talbot adress the recent 
removal of two students from Grace 
Hall. Misters Dane and Talbot 
argue that: 
1. 
"They were never charged with committing any Hall or Uni­versity offenses." 

2. 
"They were never warned that their behavior during the semester would result in discipli­nary action." 

3. 
"The Hall Judicial Board was never called together." 


Concerning the first point, there was a serious offense involved. If it had occurred elsewhere, the par­tieswould have beenarrested. The two students in this case were told the reasons for our action, they were confronted with the evidence, they admitted the act. There were no formal "charges" because such action would constitute stricter disciplinary procedure. 
2. They were warned that their behavior would result in discipli­nary action. J'he laws are clearly stated in Du Lac and the civil code. The norms are obvious in terms of even the most primitive ethics. Both studenst have been confron­ted by RA 's and head staff on several occasions this year and last. To argue that a normal probation is an absolute and necessary step in all cases is to say that all criminals can get away with a crime the first time, or that people cannot tell right from wrong. Notre Dame students are not stupid. 
3. The Hall Judicial Board was not called together because there was no hall J-Boanl at that time. If there had been a J-Board, I would have used it. I'm glad we have one now. I believe that Grace Hall was the first hall on campus to imple­ment the new judicial board pro­cess. I've gone on record strongly several times in support of J­Boards. (Cf. the fall Observer article interviewing rectors in res­ponse to new j-board procedures.) 
I am not writing to defend my 
actions. My hope is that the 
disciplinary process at Notre Dame 
may be defended by more intelli­
gent criticism than yesterday's 
letter evinces.

... a year abroad 
Dear Editor: 
Letters seem to crop up periodi­cally during the school year in The Observer praising the benefits of foreign study--and this letter is no exception. Thinking back to myself as a freshman last year, undecided upon a lot of things in my life, not only to a major but to what I really wanted to do in the future, I can remember my doubts .as to the . 
benefits of the year abroad--in my 
case, Mexico. 
At times I stilt think my ques­tions about my future are unan­swered, but in tl.is time abroad I have experienced many things that have come to shape my life. Besides all the fantastic stories each of us 18 from Notre Dame can tell, from sunny days spent on the beaches of Acapulco to climbing around on the thousand-and-one pyramids here in Mexico, there is also a lot of time spent discovering oneself. 
The challenges of adjusting to a new culture, let alone the problems of the language, are immense. Thrown into the midst of this new environment one learns that it takes more than a smile to get by, although a smile sure can help. Things that seem so elementary-­like asking for the time--take on new dimensions. 
And coupled with these cultural and language barriers there is always the yearning to have things as we know then--like having a McDonalds down the block. The biggest advantage to the foreign year abroad is precisely this: one learns to accept the differences. Here, surrounded by a city of who-knows-how-many million people and away from the friendly camp-like confines CJf Notre Dame, one gets a taste of life, but more importantly one realizes a lot about himself.

~etters to a lonely God 
Hank and I have been in love for three years now. We learned a lot about each other in those three years. We're finishing growing up together. We've been ready for marriage for some time now, but we're both in school and don't have the money. Unless we find a pot of gold somewhere, it will probably be two and one-half years before we can get married... Well, we've been especially close lately, shar­ing everything, at peace with each other and just great, with total sharing and caring for each other, and it seemed like the right moment and we had intercourse. No, we made love. It sounds so strange on paper....It doesn't seem it was wrong to me, it seemed right. Yet, it seems for some reason I'm seeking approval, not by people, but by God .... 
--excerpt from a letter My dear, full of love as you are, and so trusting of a stranger, I don't doubt how much you care for Hank, or how much he cares for you; or that both of you, at the ripe old age of twenty, want very much to get married. If I were you, as much in love as you are, I would want to get married too. I will not pretend to be able to remember whether love, at the age of renty is already merely comfortable, like warm mitten sheltering a baby's fist; or 
rhether it is as heady as a gracious wine hat flutters the heart until it soars like a 
inging lark. Love, at the age of twenty, is ' dl of touches, hugs, and embraces. :)ometimes, lovers at the age of twenty couldn't be closer if they were Siamese twins; moving around arm in arm, sharing private ecstasies, discovering heaven in the other's face. Love at twenty is precious to behold. It is the theme of sonnets, the mood of love songs; younger than spring­time, gayer than laughter. Clocks lose the time, the earth stops spinning when the moonlight plays tricks with your young love's face. Love at forty doesn't need the moonlight. At forty, passion is more gentle and reverent. At eighty, it is mostly a matter of partners, with great tenderness, looking after each other. 
In the best love stories, do the lovers always have to be touching each other, 
America and special guest Michael Murphey put on a short but entertaining musical show last night at the ACC. Not only did the "tin men" perform their usual favorites, they did so with an added amount of guitar work. Solo and jam pieces were added to various songs throughout the evening toadd luster to an otherwise ordinary performance. 
One could have mistaken opening act 
Michael Murphey for Steve Miller. He was 
on stage for less than one half hour when 
he "took the money and ran." Murphey 
played his best number, "Wildfire", 
before he departed. It did, however, take 
two trys to get "wildfire" started. 
America opened by mixing their well known material such as "Muskrat Love", "I Need You" and "Daisy Jane", with their lesser known music. This tact seemed to keep the audience from really getting into the flow of the concert. 
These other songs were, however, very good. Two of those which come to mind are "Norman", a song about a close friend of the band members, and "Hollywood", which describes the party scene on the coast. A line from this song which typifies its content is "Come to the party and drink on me." Tom Walsh, who's percussion was good all night, did a fine job of playing the vibes for this number. 
The band members joked to the crowd about their transition to the next number "Sandman" but they were in the midst of the best part of their performance. While guitar jams were interspersed in many songs, those included in "Sandman" were both the longest and the best of the night. All the members of the band seemed to really enjoy their performance of this song. 
They closed the one and one half hour set with "Sister Golden Hair," the song which met with the most audience reaction of the evening. Overall, the reaction of the

finding contentment in the true love's flesh? Cannot restraint from touching-­when needed for reasons of health or a partner's weariness--be as loving a gesture as the honeymoon ecstasies at Acapulco? 
My dear friend, beloved of Hank, sometimes being a husband or wife means living for months or years together without ever becoming more physical than a tender embrace. I don't know, in the lives of my friends, how frequently sexual abstinence occurs; almost never, I would hope. But there are accounts I have heard that tell me marriage has its heroes and heroines called to the sacrifice of the most delicate pleasures. In plain words, sometimes the most loving kindness you can offer an adored spouse is not to have sex with him or her, because there are circumstances (physical or psychological health, for example) that would make sex harmful for the time being. 
It was indeed very loving for you and Hank to have sex together, but wouldn't it have been more loving not to have had sex, because at this moment ofyourlife--young and unmarried--you fear the harm that sex can cause you? Both of you are in college; education and a career, it seems, must come before marriage. Hank can't take care of you as a wife; as a matter of fact, as a student, he can't take care of himself. Not to belittle your education, there are term papers to be written, and chem labs to be finished with; your future awaits the growth of your mind. Hard though it is for you to hear, in some ways society still looks on you as children. You are not children, of course; you are young adults. Neverthe­less, don't be in too much of a hurry to

crowd was typical for an ACC concert. The crowd sits on its hands for most of the performance, stands for "Sister Golden Hair", which seems like the logical closing number, and then induces the band to

grow up, or you'll spend more years tftan you can bear wishing you were young again. 
For a number of years, you have been biologically ready for marriage. You could make physical love, no doubt, when you were fifteen. Flesh can be more wistful with yearning at sixteen or seventeen than it will be at twenty-five. If you are otherwise as ready for marriage as you feel you are, why don't you visit the preacher? By God, if I loved a girl, and I felt that she and I were married in every way but legal fact, I would make the trip to the priest's house before the ink was dry on my homework. If I hesitated for practical reasons like money, I would ask myself if it is a boy or a man who invites a young woman to take the risks of marriage without being able to furnish her with a single one of its safeguards? 
My dear, I will_!!ot tell you that you are 
very young for marriage. As a sophomore in college, you are much too young and too vulnerable to be taking the risks involved in sex. No matter how intensely you may love Hank, you cannot be sure that age or the college experience will not change him or you. The next three years can be full of surprises; you could completely outgrow one another. The sexual relationship--in the tradition that you and I, as Catholics, are fond of--is intended to contribute to the making of a bond that lasts for a lifetime. It is not convenient for you and Hank to establish that bond in any form that gives it permanence. Then why play at marriage in a game that can leave you feeling shabby? Why take risks that can leave you scarred

My dear, I am a very old-fashioned man. I believe in God and in the rules for getting to heaven. As beautiful as I think you are, there is no way I can give my approval to sexual intimacies between you and Hank. I think you risk too much. You love God, you say, and you love Hank. I think you can love Hank best by doing, with God's help, exactly what your conscience tells you to do. There is no easier advice I have to give you. 
I thank you for writing, so full of trust, to a stranger. Italmost makes me wish I were twenty again, so that I could fall in love myself. I really wish I hadn't forgotten whether love, at twenty, is already as comfortable as a warm mitten on a baby's fist.

Somalia withdraws troops 




Somalia said yesterday it is withdrawing its regular army troops from Ethiopia's dispute<4 Ogaden Desert, where they have· been helping ethnic Somali tribes­men in their war against Ethiopianrule. 
In Washington, President Carter praised the Somali decision and called on The Soviet Union and Cuba to leave the area as well. 
"The United States looks for­ward to the withdrawal of all foreign forces at an early date," Carter said at a news conference. 
Ethiopian forces, with Cuban and Soviet support, appear to have been routing the outnumbered Somali regular army forces and the insurgents in the northern part of the Ogaden recently. The ethnic Somalis have been fighting to take the area from Ethiopia since last July. 
The government said the decision to withcraw regular troops was made to help bring about a peaceful solution to the conflict and because of pressure from the ''bigpowPrs." 
"In view of the proposals of the big powers to settle the crisis in the Horn of Africa peacefully and to withdraw all foreign forces from the region...the central committee of the Somali Socialist Revolu­tionary Party has approved a resolution that the S.D.R. (Somali Democratic Republic) should recall its units from the front," the announcement said. ''In light of this, the Somali Democratic Repub­lic calls upon the, big powers to insure: 


''1. The withdrawal of all foreign forces from the Horn of Africa. 
2. 
The recognition by the parties concerned and the exercise of the right of self-determination by the people of western Somalia and Ogaden. 

3. 
Urgently initiate the powers for bringing about a peaceful, just and lasting negotiated settlement to the conflict in the Horn of Africa." 


The Somali announcement was the first admission by the govern­ment that its troops were taking part in the conflict. 
The statement, claiming the people of the Ogaden are fighting for self-determination said Somali~ sent regular army units to the regton to support insurgents of the Western Somali Liberation Front, which at one time claimed it controlled about 90 percent of the desert. 

oflrnl~~ 


The statement said Somalia sent troops into the Ogaden after Ethi­opia's Cuban and Soviet-backed forces lauched air raids on Somali territory, causing "the death of numerous innocent civilians and a heavy economic 1loss to the country.'' 
Somalia's announcement of the withdrawal fulfills conditions repeatedly made by Ethiopia to implement a cease-fire in the war and may pave the way for Western countries to supply Somalia with defensive weapons. 
Last July, President Carter agn~ed "in principle" to supply Somalia with defensive arms. The Somalis at that time had broken thei:r defense relationship with the Soviets.

Shot paralyzes Flynt 
Hustler magazine owner Larry Flynt is paralyzed from the hips down with less than a SO-SO chance of ever walking again, according to the surgeon who removed a bullet from Flynt's lower back yesterday. 
Flynt, 34, who was shot Monday outside a Georgia courthouse where he was being tried on obscenity charges, cannot move his lower extremities, Dr. George Tin­dall, Emory University Hospital's chief neurosurgeon, told reporters after the 2V2-hour operation. 
Dr. Scott McCloskey, a medical resident who assissted in the operation, said Flynt probably will remain here for several weeks and is scheduled to begin physical ~~j ~ ·~~Jana leatl¢t~ ilf..'~he· ;~~It definitely have coal on line United, Foal Miners were dthernot and in transJ?Ortation at least the 'l?~rt'J,et.fiU or l>eing c;:arefm with second, day that we're back at tJb~it w9rds yesterday when work/' he added.

which was performed with guards 
at both doors to the operating 
room. 
"There is less than a SO percent

said. 
Flynt and one of his attorneys, GeneReeves Jr., 47, were shot as they walked along a street in Lawrenceville. Reeves was in satisfactory condition Thursday in the intensive care unit of Button Gwinnett Hospital in Lawrence­ville, according to hospital admin­istrator John Hughes. 
It will take six months to a year to know the extent of permanent damage, Tindall said.

Wholesale food prices rise 
WASHINGTON [AP] -Whole­sale food prices soared in February by the biggest margin in three years and the Labor Department 
said  there  is  no  evidence  that  
March  will  bring  any  relief  to  
consumers.  

The higher prices should start showing up soon at the retail level ­the supermarket -particularly in the meat section, Labor Depart­ment analysts said yesterday. 
The department said the prices that manufacturers c~arge super­markets and other retailers for consumer food rose 2.9 percent in February, the largest increase since a 4.1 percent gain in Novem­ber, 1974. 
The higher wholesale food prices caused the wholesale prices for all finished goods to jump by 1.1 percent, also the largest gain since November, 1974. If food is removed, the overall increase for February is 0.4 percent. 
The 1.1 percent pverall hike in finished goods is a 13.2 percent rate of inflation if figured on an annual basis. 
The sharp jump resulted in Agriculture Department officials saying they were reassessing their prediction that retail food prices will rise only four to six percent over the entire year. 
Much of the increase in whole­sale food prices was attributed to short supplies caused by delivery trouble during severe winter weather. But the department said there was no evidence that the prices will abate this month. 
Prices turned up sharply for pork, eggs and dairy products after declining the previous month, the department said. Beef and veal prices rose much more than in January. 
Beef prices have been rising for several months, the Agriculture Department siad. One factor in this rise is that cattlemen three years ago started cutting back on the size of their herds because a surplus of cattle had sharply lowered the price they received for their cattle. 
Prices of roasted coffee -declined in February, and price increases were not as big for fruit, vegetables and poultry. 
Grocery stores already had begun raising their prices on many foods t>e<\ause of higher prices at earlier sta~s of production. In January, the cost of food and beverages at the supermarket level rose 1.2 percent, contributing to a 
0.3 percent increase in all con­sumer prices. 
Department economists said further increases in final food prices were likely because of the 
2.9 percent rise in February in finished food -or wholesale prod­ucts, a 0.9 percent rise at the. intermediate stage of production and a 4. 7 percent increase at the farm level and other early stages. 
The report was described as discouraging by G. William Miller, who testified at a congressional hearing for the first time as Federal Reserve chairman. 
"One of the great disappoint­ments of the past year has been the lack of progress in reducing the pace of inflation," Miller told the House Banking Committee. 
He said the administration and Congress should explore new ways to restrain wage and price increases. 
The Labor Department report said wholesale iron and steel prices rose 2.5 percent, indicatin~ price increases might be expected for such items as autos and refrigera­tors. The total increase in goods halfway through production was 
0.9 percent. 
On a brighter note, the depart­ment said producer;;' prices deClined in February for jewelry, gasoline and home heating oil after increases in January. 
Price increases were smaller in February for autos, furniture and mobile homes. 
The entire index for finished goods prices, the stage before they reach the consumer, was 188.3 That meant they were 88.3 percent higher than in the 1967 base period. 
The department is emphasizing this index, instead of the old Wholesale Price Index on grounds that it resembles consumer .prices more closely. The old Wholesale Price Index, covering all stages of production, rose one percent in February, the largest increase since a one percent increase in April.

SooJc.on human clone causes controversy 
[AP]  David 1\.1. Rorvik, whose upcoming book '.!.lieges the first creation of human11ife by cloning, emerged yesterday as a man of contradiction. --The serious, intelligent author involved with far-out scientific ideas. --The nonfiction writer working on a pornographic novel called "The Clone." --The top student in trouble for writing sex-flavored editorials for the college newspaper. Rorvik's book, "In His Image: The Cloning of a Man,'' will be published, as nonfiction, by the J .B. Lippincott Co. on March 31, two months ahead of schedule. 
Controversy over the book began after Lippincott ran promotional advertisement in a trade publica­tion. Several scientists said that cloning -the process of duplicating living things from an individual cell -was virtually impossible for a human being today. 
Rorvil himself has been unavail­able for comment. A statement attributed to Rorvik and issued by Lippincott on Wednesday said the the 14-month-old baby allegedly created by cloning, the offspring of a wealthy, unidentified man, was "alive, healthy and loved today." 
Information pieced together from interviews and from a artide yesterday in the great Falls Mont. Tribune showed Rorvik was born Nov. 1, 1943 in Circle, Mont., the youngest of five children of Frances Eleanor and Allen "Whey" Rorvik. His father, an auto mechanic, died in 1%1; his mother lives in Ronan, Mont. He is not married. 
Rorvik's articles have appeared in numerous magazines, including Esqalre, Reader's Dlgestand the New York Times Magazine. He is the author of five nonfiction books and a satirical novel. 
The Tribune said Rorvik was interviewed in 1970 when he was working as a free-lance writer. "Rorvik says he finds fiction writ­ing more difficult than nonfiction, but is determined to complete his novel, 'The Clone' and perhaps get it made into a movie," said the 1970 story, continuing: "'The Clone is a pornographic science fiction thriller based on current medical possibility, he said." 
Rorvik is a 1966 graduate of the University of Montana School of Journalism and received a master's degree from the Columbia Univer­sity School of Journalism in 1967. Bryna Taubman, one of Rorvik's classmates at Columbia, said he was "Very quiet and shy and kept to himself. He was a very goo4 journalist, a very good writer. always very accurate with his facts." Ma. Taubman, a writer flk WCBS radio in New York, said, " "He always had the information to back up his writing. I haven't read 
the book, butiknowDavid Rorvik 
and if he's written a book that's 
this easily disproved, he must have 
the information to back it up." 
A contrasting view came from Leon 
Jaroff, a senior editor at Time 
magazine with responsibility fdr 
the science and medicine section. 
Jaroff, who was Rorvik's boss when 
he worked at Time in 1968 and 
1%9, said: "David is intelligent. 
David is a good writer. David is af little strange." ·' Jaroff said that when Rorvik quit llme "he was becoming enamored of UFO's. I think he may have beleived in them." He said he followed Rorvik's career. "What I noticed by his writings . . . he started to get into really strange 
subjects .... " 
Jaroff criticized Rorvik for his articles in recent years on subjects such as purported cancer cures and psychic phenomena. He said he could not be objective about Rorvik because of the articles on cancer cures. "He preys on the hopes and fears of people who have cancer," 
Jaroff said. 
Another who worked with Rorvik at llme, Fred Golden, said he was "very smart," but added, "He's an explorer of the fringe areas of 
science." 
Rorvik was named outstanding student in journalism in his Mon­tana graduating class and, last fall, received one of two "Distinguished Young Alumnus" awards from the school. He graduated fourth in a 
class of 800. 
While in college, he was drama · freedom even, or especially, for the authored with Dr. O.S.

The Irish Eye 


November seems so long ago when all of the nation's basketball teams tipped off their season. Finally, the NCAA has narrowed all the college cage squads to the "32 best" in the country. 
The season has been a long one for everyone involved and these 32 teams will have to give it one more shot. They'll all have to play their best for five straight games if they expect to emerge on top. Winning that clash on March 27 in St. Louis has been a goal of many of the country's teams, but only these 32 have a chance to claim the nation's top honors. 
So, with 16 games scheduled to be played tomorrow and Sunday, here are the Irish Eye's picks for this NCAA tournament weekend. Notre Dame vs. Houston: The Irish have faired well in the opening round of the NCAA's, haveing won in their last six attempts. However, the Notre Dame cagers have lost to Houston twice in the NCAA tournament. On Sunday, the key will be ifthe Irish can prevent turning the ball over against the Cougar's pressure defense. In addition, Notre Dame will have to slow down Houston's run and gun game and try to control the tempo. This contest will definitely be a test for the Irish, but hopefully Notre Dame's depth will carry them through the opening round. So, give the game to Notre Dame by three points. Mlssourrl vs. Utah: the Tigers are the only team in the tournament with a sub .500 record, having a 14-15 ledger. However, having won the Big Eight tournament, they are definitely a "hot" team. But, Utah will be too much for them to handle in this clash as the Tigers will fall by nine points. Crelgbton vs DePaul: Are the Blue Demons for real? Well, the people in chicago seem to think so. Chicago Trfb1111e sports columnist Rick Tally seems to believe the Demons can go all the way to the finals. DePaul boasts the best record of anyone in the tournament and emotion seems to have carried them through the season. I really don't think they're as good as some feel, but they've built up a lot of confidence and momentum throughout the year. Ray Meyer seems to think this is his best team ever, and he ought to know. Thus, give this matchup to the Demons by ten points. LoulsvWe vs. St. John's: St. John's had to win their tourney to make the playoffs and although they amay have some talent, including ex-Irish recruit Bernard Rencher, Darrell Griffith and the rest of the Louisville squad should be too much to handle. So, with the Doctor of Dunk leading the way, give this encounter to Louisville by seven. UCLA vs. Kansas: This West division is by far the toughest one in the tournament. Thank goodness for the Irish that the Jayhawks were downed in their conference tournament. Because, if the Irish advance to the regional semi-finals, they would have had to play on Kansas' home court. But, the Bruins have the luck of playing this 24-4 Kansas ballclub. UCLA is currently ranked second in the country, having suffered only two defeats, both to Notre Dame. This game will rank among the best in the opening round and should be a battle from beginning to end. The contest will be close, but give this one to the Bruins by two. Weber State vs. Arkansas: The Razorbacks made quite a name for themselves this season, mating it to the number-one ranking for one week. That marked the first time ever a Southwest Conference team has ever made the top spot. But, their first season is behind them and the second one ready to start. Weber State should not stand in the way of Arkansas' attempt for win number 29. Thus, the Razorbacks 
will capture this game by ten. San Francisco vs. North Carolina: When the Tarheels eliminated the Irish last season, they kept the Thursday night jinx alive. At least they won't have the opportunity to repeat that performance. The Dons lost five games early in the season and since Bill Cartwright returned to the lineup, they have yet to lose a game. Even without James Hardy, San Francisco will make it a game. But, the experience of a tougher schedule may prove beneficial to North Carolina. So, give this confrontation to the Tarheels by four. New Mexico vs Cal State Fullerton: New Mexico and their 24-3 ledger has drawn a lot of national recognition. Meanwhile, who ever heard of Cal State Fullerton. I'll probably be proven wrong, but New Mexico should breeze into the second round by 15. Duke vs. Rhode Island: The Blue Devils are probably the best team in the East Regional, with the possible exception of Indiana. URI will be a respectable test, but Duke should capture this one easily by 13. 
Penn vs. St. Bonaventure: Bonnie Head Coach Jim Satalin is glad to be in the tournament, but very unhappy that they have to face Penn in the Palestra, their home court. St. Bonaventure gave the Irish a scare earlier this season as Notre Dame won by one point. The Bonnies will be able to capture this one but it should be a tough battle to the end. Thus, give this matchup to St. Bonaventure by three. 
Furman vslndlana: Southern Conference winner Furman showed bow well they can play in the big game against both North Carolina and North Carolina State earlier this year. However, Big Ten runnerup Indiana has won their last ten games, enabling them to earn a position in the tourney. The game will be close, but when the final buzzer sounds, the Hoosiers should be on top by five.-
Villanova vs LaSalle: The Explorers and the Wildcats were both opponents of the Irish this season. Villanova .fell to Notre. Dame ~n the ACC by one point while LaSalle lost to the Irish by five pomts. thts contest will be hard-fought, but look for the Wildcats to end up on top 
by four. Michigan State vs Providence: The Spartans won the Big Ten title for the first time in almost 20 years. Providence will have their hands full in this opener and Coach Dave Gavitt is not too thrilled about haveing such a tough game in the opening round. This contest will be another 
highlight of the first 16 tournament games. Look for tht: Spartans to win by six. Western Kentucky vs. Syracuse: The Orange has not played as well as 
expected in the preseason. However, Western Kentucky should not stand in the way of a scrappy Syracuse squad that should make it to round number two. Thus, give this battle to the Orange by nine. 
Miami of Ohlo vs. Marquette: How did Miami of Ohio get so lucky as 
to play the defending National Champs? Well, Hank Raymonds is so 
won-ied about his "second" game with Kentucky, he's not even 
thinking about this one. The Redskins don't have the club to compete 
with the Warriors, but if Marquette is looking too far ahead, the game 
will be fairly close. However, give the game to the Warriors by seven. 
Kentucky vs. Florida State: Florida State had to go and lose their final game and be sent to the Mideast Regional to face this currently number-one ranked squad. Both teams are very talented, unfortunately only one can continue in the tourney. So, give this clash to the Wildcats by five points. 
Tourneyhistory 
by Tim Bourret Sports Writer 

Of the 245 teams in the top 
division .of the NCAA only Ken­
tucky and UCLA have played in 
more NCAA tournaments than 
Notre Dame. Despite having 14 
previous chances, the Irish have 
never reached the prestigious final 
four and have only three appear­
ances in regional championships. 
The Irish made their first appear­
ance in the NCAA tournament in 
1953 under John Jordan. Dick 
Rosenthal and Jack Stephens led 
the Irish to victories over Eastern 
Kentucky and Pennsylvania in the 
first two rounds, setting up a 
confrontation with Indiana for the 
Midwest Regional championship. 
Notre Dame had already defeated 
the Hoosiers at Notre Dame, 71-70, 
on a Jack Stephens driving layup 
with six seconds remaining. But in 
the post season battle in the 
Chicago Stadium, Don Schlundt's 41 points, 30 of which were registered before halftime, enabled the Hoosiers to fain revenge, 79-66. It must have been especially grat­ifying for Indiana's all-time leading scorer, as he was a star at South , Bend's Clay High School a few years earlier. Schlundt continued his fine play in the national finals leading the Hoosiers to the Nat­ional Championship in Kansas 
City. 
The following season the tables 
were turned. This time Indiana 
defeated the Irish in the regular 
season meeting at Bloomington. 
But in the NCAA tournament Notre 
Dame pulled off the upset of the 
year. In the semifinals of the 
Midwest Regional held at Iowa City 
the Irish downed the defending 
National Champions, 65-64. Rich­
ard Rosenthal, Notre Dame's 6-4 
center, led the Irish with 25 points 
and held the 6-10 Schlundt to one 
field goal and 11 points. Stephens 
again scored some clutch baskets 
and held Bob Leonard, Indiana's 
All-American guard and present 
coach of the Indiana Pacers, to 11 
points. The victory allowed the 
Irish to advance to the regional 
final, where Notre Dame lost by 
eight to Penn State. 
In 1957 and 1958 the Irish again 
qualified for post-season play. In 
1957 Notre Dame lost in the second 
round to Michigan State, as Johnny 
Green, a long time NBA player 
grabbed 27 rebounds in the Spart­
ans' 85-83 victory. In 1958, even­
tual National Champion Kentucky 
and "Rupp's Runts" drubbed 
Notre Dame, 89-56. 
Between 1960 and 1969 Notre 
Dame made four NCAA tslurna­
ment appearances and never got 
past the first round. In 1960 Ohio 
University belted the Irish 74-66 
while a Nate Thurmond led Bowl­
ing Breen team eliminated Notre 
Dame 77-72 in 1963. Two years 
later the Irish first met Houston in 
the NCAA classic. Notre Dame had 
beaten the Cougers by 30 points at 
Houston during the regular season, 
but lost in the NCAA tournament 
99-98 in overtime. Six Irish, includ­
ing professional baseball's Ron 
Reed, scored in double figures for 
Notre Dame, who grabbed 19 more 
rebounds and attempted 18 more 
shots but still lost. But a 34 percent 
shooting accuracy in the second 
half killed Notre Dame's chances. 
In 1969 a third Mid-American 
Conference team eliminated Notre 
Dame from national championship 
contention the initial round. Notre 
Dame's 1969 team was led by Bob 
Arnzen, Bob Whitmore, Collis 
Jones and Austin Carr, four· of 
Notre Dame's top five all-time 
leading scorers. But, a first half 
injury to Carr and cold shooting by 
Arnzen and Whitmore helped 
Miami of Ohio to a 63-60 triumph at 
Carbondale, Illinios. 
Austin Carr began his legendary
