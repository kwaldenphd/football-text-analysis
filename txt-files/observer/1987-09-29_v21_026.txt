Mudslide kills 175 in Colombia 


Associated Press 
MEDELLIN, Colombia -An avalanche of red mud and rock killed at least 175 people, in­cluding 43 children, when it thundered down a mountain­side and onto a slum area, officials said Monday. 
Some residents estimated up to 500 people were missing in the scores of buried shacks. 
At least seven of the children killed were attending first Holy Communion parties when buried under the landslide Sun­day in Villa Tina, an im­poverished area of the indus­trial city of Medellin. 
"We heard the noise that sounded like an explosion and soon afterward a huge mass of rocks and mud descended upon us," said Mary Mosquera, who lost three daughters in the av­alanche. "They were trapped by huge rocks and we couldn't do anything to rescue them." 
Mayor William Jaramillo Gomez told the radio chain Todelar that about 200 people were injured. 
A few survivors were pulled from the mud Sunday after­noon, but no one was found alive in the mud Sunday night or Monday morning, he said. 
Exhausted workers dug through 20 feet of mud Monday but found no survivors -just bodies. Slum dwellers wan­dered through the area search­ing for dead or missing rela­tives. Other residents tried to find belongings lost in the mudslide. 
Rescues workers said they were guided in recovering many bodies by dogs howling at the spots where their owners were buried. 
By nightfall, 175 bodies had been recovered, some buried under more than 36 feet of mud, the Fire Department said. 
Jaramillo Gomez suspended work later Monday as torren­tial rains for the fourth con­secutive day threatened to send more mud tumbling on top of workers, according to Caracol, Colombia's largest radio net­work. 
There were several small mudslides during the night on Sugar Loaf Mountain, over­looking Villa Tina, but they caused no new casualties and little damage, he said. 
Jaramillo Gomez told Caracol he had ordered that all victims, many of them uniden­tified, be interred immediately to prevent any outbreak of dis­ease. 
At least 50 people were buried in a mass grave, while the remaining bodies were to be buried Tuesday, he said. 
A funeral service was held in a sports coliseum in Medellin, Caracol reported.

Students urged to 'take the Plunge': register tomorrow 
By CATHY STACY Assistant News Editor 
Approximately 250 Notre Dame and Saint Mary's stu­dents are expected to partici­pate in this year's Urban Plunge -a 48 hour immersion into the kind of life that most students have never seen before, said Urban Plunge Co­ordinator Dan Keusal. 
The Plunge, sponsored by the Center for Social Concerns, is not meant to be a service proj­ect, but an eye-opening experi­ence to the questions of inner­city poverty and injustice, he said. 
Participants also receive a one-hour credit for the plunge. "Prior to the Plunge," wrote

ND Office one of 90 to receive new grant 
By KENDRA MORRILL Senior Staff Reporter 
The Office of Student Affairs was one of 90 recipients nation­wide of a special $94,000 grant from the U.S. Department of Education to establish an Of­fice of Alcohol and Drug Edu­cation, according to Ann Firth, director of Residence Life. 
The grant proposal was a joint effort between the Office of Student Affairs and the Uni­versity Counseling Center, Firth said. It was co-authored by Firth and Christine Conway and Sally Coleman, both of the University Counseling Center, she said. 
Firth said over 500 grant proposals were submitted to the Department of Education. 
"The proposals are designed to be models for other colleges and universities," Firth said. 
The new office intends to promote a deepened awareness of the problems associated with the use of alcohol and drugs, according to a press release. 
The office will also sponsor a variety of programs and activ­ities designed to change the at­titudes of the Notre Dame com­munity regarding the use of these substances, the press release stated. 
The office will be dedicated to the memory of the members

David Lucke after his experi­ence in Milwaukee, "poverty was something I read about, and I was aware of its sig­nificance...but I did not really know what it was or how it felt to be poor." 
"<The) Urban Plunge made me question 'Why,'" Cathleen Crinieri wrote about her plunge in Columbus. "Why do so few people really care enough to do anything about it?" 
Registration for the upcom­ing Urban Plunge begins to­morrow and runs until Oct. 9 at the CSC and Saint Mary's Office of Justice Education. 
Students who register will receive Plunge Learning Agreements which contain a sample schedule of the two-day experience and list more than 40 possible plunge sites.

A preliminary draft of a 50 question student survey was presented to the Senate last night by student senator Brian Holst. 
According to Holst, the sur­vey will be sent to approxi­mately 2,000 random students in the next few weeks. Holst said that he hopes to receive responses from at least 1,500. 
The first part of the survey is for demographic purposes abuse and birth control. 
The goal is to use the same demographic questions year after year to construct a way of measuring the evolution in the moral practices and beliefs of the student body, Holst said. He added that responses will be completely anonymous. 
The second portion of the sur­vey contains questions about current issues of controversy. 
This section of the survey will said Holst. 

Members of the Senate each completed a copy of the survey and discussed its general effec­tiveness and improvements that could be made in specific questions. 
Senate members, who were able to complete the questions in approximately seven minutes, said they felt the sur­

U.S.-Iran relations might have been bettered before 

Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -U.S. offi­cials passed up a chance in 1985 to talk directly to a high Iranian official eager to im­prove relations, instead strengthening the hand of Iranian radicals through arms sales, a former White House consultant contended in Iran­Contra testimony released Monday. 
Michael Ledeen, a former 

Gorbachev unseen lately; absence puzzles Soviets 
Associated Press 
MOSCOW -The Soviet capital is puzzling over the seven-week absence of Communist Party leader Mikhail Gorbachev. 
The energetic, 56-year-old leader has constantly been in the public eye since he took charge of the Kremlin in March 1985 following the deaths in the previous 2 years of Leonid Brezhnev, Yuri Andropov and Konstantin Chernenko. 
Soviet officials insist nothing is wrong. 

His absence is a main topic of conversation among foreig­ners and their Soviet contacts, and journalists who live along a major route often used by Kremlin leaders keep watch for Gorbachev's motorcade. 
Pyotr Starchik, one of the publishers of the Express­Chronicle, an unofficial journal of dissident activities, said consultant on terrorism who took part in early discussions with Israel about the Iran arms sales, said the Iranian official "believed it possible to, in es­sence, change the nature of the Iranian regime through peace­ful, parliamentary methods." 
In his testimony, given privately in March, June and September to House and Senate investigators, Ledeen said the official believed the changes could lead to Iran's abandon-
Monday that if Gorbachev's ab­sence meant a change of lead­ership, it would mean trouble for dissidents. 
"If (Yegor) Ligachev takes over, everything will be differ­ent," he said, referring to the Politburo member who gener­ally is regarded as the Krem­lin's No. 2 man. 
But there has been no evidence of a power struggle in the Kremlin. 
Foreign news reports have offered possible explanations including an attack of food poisoning and complications from appendix surgery for Gor­bachev's wife, Raisa. 
Foreign Ministry spokesman Boris Pyadyshev told reporters last week that the Soviet leader "is on vacation and that he is in good health -excellent health." 

ment of terrorism and to better relations with the West. 
The official, who is not named, is said to have been eager to cooperate with the United States, asking only for small arms to protect himself and his allies inside Iran and for secure communications equipment to stay privately in touch with the United States, Ledeen said. 
He said the official strongly opposed large-scale sales of U.S.-made weapons to Iran be­cause that strengthened his powerful opponents who were resisting any tendency towar.ds moderation. 
Ledeen said that after talking to the official he briefed then-National Security Adviser Robert McFarlane and later William Casey, then-director of the Central Intelligence Agency. 
At one point, he said, he urged Casey to tell President Reagan "that pursuing the hostages was backwards and it was permitting the tail to wag 
the dog and that we should in­stead pursue the political mat­ter." 
On the other hand, some in the administration have criticized Ledeen, saying his terrorism expertise was mini­mal and that he could not be trusted to keep secrets.

University president Father Edward Malloy meets with Renee Gau on coordinating a Crop walk with the South Bend community. Gau, the services

Special to The Observer 

Organizers of the CROP walk have begun recruiting participants for this year's event. 
As many as 200 Notre Dame students are expected to participate in this year's CROP walk. 
The fifth annual event, a 10 kilometer, or approxi­mately 6 mile walk, will take place Oct. 11. 
More than 1,000 people are expected to participate in the walk which benefits overseas and local commu­nity service projects. 
"Our goal is to get at least 200 students to walk," said Renee Gau, services con­cerns commissioner of stu­dent government. 
She said 100 students from Notre Dame's ROTC pro­gram will participate, and she hopes to enlist at least 10 students from each dorm on campus. 
The walk is "one way in which the community rallies together to deal with the problem of world hunger," said University President Father Edward Malloy, who is helping to publicize this year's event. 
The event is primarily a 
community event, rather 
than a Notre Dame-initiated 
project. "We want to show 
Notre Dame's support for 
the community," Gau said. 
The walk will begin at 2 
p.m. and end at 5 p.m. at St. Joseph High School. Mem­bers of more than 75 local organizations are expected to participate. 
The walk's organizers said · they hope to raise $30,000 for a variety of global and local concerns. 
Last year, $18,000 was raised. 
Eighty percent of this year's proceeds will be donated to overseas proj­ects, and 20 percent will be devoted to two local relief projects, the Michiana Food Bank and the United Religi­ous Community's winter shelter at the Maranatha Temple. 
Members of Notre Dame Glee Club will sing during the registration period at St. Joseph High School begin­ning at 1 p.m. Sunday. 
CROP is an acronym for the Christian Rural Over­seas Project of the Church World Service Community Appeals organization.

rience with justice and an awareness for social concerns," said Keusal. "The Plunge is also raising the awareness of alums who have helped set up plunge sites in their cities." 
Keusal attributes his current 
interest in social justice and 
poverty to the Plunge he made 
in 1982. "I don't believe every­
one will become a theology and 
justice major after the experi­
ence, but it is a real eye-opener 
and inspires others to go on to 
do more," he said. 
The Urban Plunge is des­cribed in an information pamphlet as one way that Notre Dame seeks to address the issues of Catholic social teaching and sensitize students to the need for social action in the world. 


Revolt 
continued from page 1 
"Undoubtedly, our officers encountered a situation where if it got out of hand, some people would have been hurt," said Metro-Dade police spokes­man Rey Valdes. 
But passengers said people were merely complaining and that there was no excuse for the violent encounter with the police officers. 
Passengers said police beat some people, pushed others around and were verbally abusive. 
Smythe said the passengers hadn't done anything when police jumped on one man and started choking him. 
"He was turning blue in the face," he said. "His wife started screaming. Everyone started screaming. The police were beating this guy." 
Smythe called the officers "very inflammatory and very violent," and said one officer attacked an elderly man who 
said "Boo!" 

"Students are faced with the 
contrast between the lifestyles 
they have known and those they 
see on their Plunges, and they 
are challenged to analyze the 
causes of the conditions they 
see," the pamphlet explains. 
In the late 1960's, Father Don 
McNeill and John Egan, an 
inner-city pastor, began the 
first Plunge experience in 
Chicago with two groups of 24 
students. 

In 1977, members of the stu­
dent group CILA (Community 
for the International Lay 
Apostolate) took on the Urban 
Plunge as a group project. 

The project has continued to 
grow, and contacts in new 
cities emerge each year. 

"The difference between ·(before taking the Plunge) and 
now," wrote Lucke, "is that I 
can connect poverty and other 
social problems with the people 
they touch."

Diane Fitzgibbon, senior class president, said she thought the personal and direct nature of some of the questions might tend to put students on the defensive when responding. 
In other business, Laurie Bink, student body vice presi­dent, presented models and diagrams of the renovations currently underway on North Dining Hall. 
Major changes will include an upper and lower level of seating by the windows looking out on North Quad. 
According to Pat Cooke, stu­dent body president, the con­struction, which is slated for completion by October of 1988, should increase the dining capacity by 500 seats.

that William Hickey, director of food services, has been responsive to the Senate and Hall President's Council's offer to volunteer to work a shift in the dining hall as a good will gesture to the recent food riot. 
"Hickey's real concern is that students don't respect the workers," said Holst. 
The Senate agreed to work the dinner shift on Thursday, Oct. 8. The Senate members will identify themselves by wearing T -shirts durring their shift. 
"We have to identify our­selves as student leaders," said Cooke. 
The Senate also followed up on a discussion from last week regarding off campus crime. 
Cooke said that he and his committee decided that draft­ing a letter to Charles Hurley, South Bend's chief of police, would not serve to create a pos­itive interaction between stu­dent government and the South Bend police. 
Cooke said that he hoped to get Hurley to contribute to an informational packet that is being sent to all off campus stu­dents, and participate in an or­ientation program for inter­ested students.

New B-1 B long-range bomber crashes in Colorado 
Associated Press 
LA JUNTA, Colo. -A B-lB bomber with six people aboard crashed Monday in a ball of or­ange flame in the Colorado prairie, but three crew mem­bers parachuted to safety, aut­horities said. 
The fate of the other crew members was not immediately disclosed. It was the first crash of a regular production model of the B-lB, the nation's newest long-range strategic bomber. 
The survivors were flown to a hospital at Peterson Air Force Base east of Colorado Springs, said base spokesman Sgt. Warren Wright. Aut­horities withheld information on them pending notification of relatives. 
The bomber, attached to the 96th Bombardment Wing, left Dyess Air Force Base in Abilene, Texas, early Monday. 
It was headed for the Strate­gic Training Range Complex near La Junta, about 60 miles southeast of Pueblo, the Stra­tegic Air Command said. 
The plane went down two miles south of La Junta at 9:34 a.m., said Capt. Dave Thurston of SAC command headquarters in Omaha, Neb. 
Greg Rieken, who lives on a dairy farm 20 miles east of La Junta, said he watched the plane come out of the northeast and "I knew something was wrong -it was in trouble."

Indy frat serves up alcohol at parties but tests for drunks 
Associated Press 
INDIANAPOLIS -People who attend parties sponsored by Delta Sigma Pi have to pass Breathalyzer tests before they can drive home, according to the fraternity's president. 
Jim Spencer, who heads the professional fraternity at In­diana University-Purdue Uni­versity at Indianapolis, said his group decided to impose the policy after a few members were charged with driving while intoxicated after leaving parties. A few also had been involved in alcohol-related traffic accidents. 
"We thought it's just a mat­ter of time before something else happens, and we wanted to avoid it," said Spencer. "We've been talking about it for a couple of months." 
Although Delta Sigma Pi is not a social fraternity, it has many social events where alco­hol is served, Spencer said. 
"It was just a general agree­ment by everyone that it was a good idea," he said. 
The fraternity bought a Breathalyzer device for $119 earlier this month, and have already used it at one party. 

"No one really seemed to ob­ject to it," Spencer said. "They didn't give too much resis­tance. I think they understood what we were doing was for their protection and for the protection of others on the road." 
Under the fraternity's new policy, partygoers are asked to give up their car keys when they arrive. To get the keys back, they must pass the breath tests when they are ready to leave. 
Those whose alcohol level exceeds the legal limit are given the option of riding home with a sober driver or of staying overnight at the frater­nity. 
Under Indiana law, a person can be charged with drunken driving if his blood-alcohol level measures 0.10 percent or higher. 
Lane Dunagin was one of three fraternity members who flunked the test at the first party. He ended up staying overnight. 
"Without the Breathalyzer, some people may not realize exactly how drunk they are," said Dunagin. "I realized I should have stayed." 
"I watched it burn and &moke came out the back end of it until it dipped a little bit to the right and went over the horizon and just crashed. And I just saw a big fireball plume up after that," Rieken said. 
"It sounded like a sonic boom," he said. "It was really bright. It hung up in the air for a long time. It was brilliant or­ange." 
Bud Quick of La Junta said he "felt a thud," saw a ball of fire behind some hills and saw three parachutes floating to the ground. 
The plane was not carrying any bombs, the Air Force said. 
The cause of the crash was to be investigated by a board of officers. 
At the training range near La Junta, crew members simulate bomb drops and are scored electronically by personnel on the ground. In October 1981, a B-52 crashed at the range, kil­ling all eight crew members. 
Wright said the B-lB is de­signed to carry four crew mem­bers, but there were six on board because it was a training mission. Two people on board probably were "evaluators," Wright said. 
The Air Force said Monday it was unclear at what altitude the bomber was flying when trouble developed. Rieken esti­mated the plane was flying at 1,500 to 2,000 feet when he saw it. 

A prototype of the bomber crashed in August 1984 in Cal­ifornia's Mojave Desert, killing one man and injuring two others seriously. 
The B-lB, a strategic bomber and missile platform, is manufactured by Rockwell In­ternational's North American Aerospace Operations in El Segundo, Calif. It has a maxi­mum speed of about 1,000 mph and a range of more than 7,000 miles when fully fueled. 
It is the first new long-range strategic bomber produced in the United States in more than 25 years. 
The first of the 100 B-IB's being purchased by the Air Force were activated in Octo­ber 1986 at Dyess. 

Number of collegians increases 
Associated Press 
INDIANAPOLIS -Indiana college and university officials are puzzled by increased en­rollments this fall from what was expected to be a smaller pool of college-bound students. 
"It's an odd phenomenon ... It wouldn't be so mysterious if it were happening in one or two schools, but there has been this across-the-board, across­geography increase," said Polly Coddington, associate director of admissions at DePauw University, where en­rollment is up this semester. 
Six of Indiana's seven public institutions of higher education also have experienced in­creased enrollments this fall, with record highs at Purdue and Indiana universities. 
Only Indiana State Univer­sity showed a decrease and that was only by about 50 students. 
No one is sure why this has happened, but there are theories. 
National annual projections by the U.S. Department of Edu­cation predicted a slight decline in enrollments this fall due to an expected decrease in college-age students, said Rosa Fernandez, a statistician at the department's Center for Edu­cation Statistics. 
A smaller study by the cen­ter, however, showed a 1 per­cent increase in enrollments based on a sample, she added. 
Indiana University's total full-and part-time enrollment reached 82,627 students this fall -2,511 more than last fall, registrar Sara McNabb said. 
Purdue's record high is 931 more full-and part-time stu­dents than last year, with the preliminary figure totalling 32,243, said Dr. Barbara Stahura, Purdue research as­sistant. 
Stephen Bushouse, Butler University's dean of admis­sions and financial aid, sugges­ted national studies indicating 

the next school year, 1988-89, might have been one year off. "Maybe we got the blip a year earlier," he said. 
If census figures correctly in­dicate a shrinking pool of college-age adults this fall, the rise in enrollments could indi­cate that a greater percentage of that pool is pursuing higher education, said William Dubois, executive director of the State Student Assistance Commission of Indiana. 
Clyde Ingle, the state's higher education commission­er, said labeling the increase as a trend would be premature. 
Some of the increase could be attributed to efforts by state government, business and educators working toward greater emphasis on higher education in Indiana, said William Osmon, associate vice president for academic affairs for Indiana State.

Appalling realities in Nicaragua 
Time and time again, Communism has been called "The god that failed." Why? Just take a look at the basket-case economies and complete repression in every Communist country. Yet, every few years or so, a n~ · "revolution" seems to capture the imaginations of the system's admirers, who sing a chorus of, "This revolution won't be like all the others. It's new and im­proved Communism!" Fidel Castro was a darling of the U.S. Media for his first two years in power, a time in which he was still denying any "Communist leanings" (while simultaneously proving them back in Cuba.) The VC and Ho Chi Minh were pretty popular among 60's "peace" demonstrators as well. So, in the 1980's, along comes Nicaragua, with another "new and im­proved" brand of Communism, one which today's trendy "liberation" theologians like to say promotes, in a twisted usage of the term, "Social Jus­tice.'' The Sandinista Communists have effectively hoodwinked the whole U.S. liberal spectrum into believing that Nicaragua actually has a sweet and humane government and system. The reality is quite different. 
Glenn Fogarty 
guest column 
Like any Communist government, the Sandinistas have systematically wrecked their nation's economy within 7 years of power. Inflation now stands at 600%, and the state-controlled "food" agency provides little to no food for the starving populace (Most of the food is allocated to the Sandinista Popular Army, which, by the way, is larger than all the armies of Central American combined.) Most businesses have been forced to shut down, and by and large, property confiscation has forced the middle class to flee. Labor unions are practically outlawed, and their leaders are in Sandinista prisons. In addition, Nicaragua's once fairly productive agriculture system is now floundering, thanks to mandatory col­lectivization a few years back; peasants' farms were confiscated, and the peasants were forced to migrate to the cities. In and around Managua, over 100,000 of these former farmers now reside in cardboard shacks as squatters (due to the government's commitment to social justice, I guess.) Former San­dinistas say that the government's plan 
Doonesbury 

is to "let the city deteriorate to the point" where the squatters will decide to move back to the countryside. Con­sequently, Managua's public works, public health, and transportation sys­tems are now in ruins. 
In consolidating their revolution, the Sandinistas have treated their people with the type of tender 1Qv1ng care nor­mally associated with Communists. The Puebla Institute, an inter­American human rights organization, reports that Sandinista troops have reg­ularly attacked villagers, their homes, and farms "indiscriminately and with­out warning", dropping grenades and shooting rockets out of helicopters and airplanes. In the past year and a half, Sandinista troops have also raided 50 Miskito Indian villages, with subse­quent hanging, burning, shooting, and live burial of the inhabitants. 
To counter what one Sandinista sol­dier described as "much support for the Contras among the people," since 1984 the Sandinistas have largely depopulated northern Nicaragua, removing more than 70,000 peasants, razing their villages and placing them in "reeducation camps", fenced in with little shelter and food. According to the 
N.Y. Times, in the past few months the Sandinista army has rounded up more than 6,000 civilians living in southern Nicaragua: as well, forcibly removing them to the same crowded detention centers, with reports that a Sandinista Colonel raped a 15-year old girl in the process. 
There has been a complete suspen­sion of civil rights for several years. The State Department's '87 report on Nicaragua states, "churchmen, businessmen, dissident writers, and former Sandinistas are routinely harassed, arrested, interrogated, tor­tured, and occasionally killed." There is mass conscription into the army, and most soldiers are forced to take in­doctrination courses. One test used on occasion is as Atheism Quotient. Recruits are given 3 chanced to relin­quish their faith, and are subjected to further indoctrination, torture, or im­prisonment. Some refusers have been killed. 
The Church has been hard-hit. The Catholic press and radio station have been forcibly closed, and Masses are frequently interrupted by Sandinista­backed mobs. The Cardinal and his priests are regularly harassed, and a good number of priests and bishops have been deported. A farmer and lay Protestant preacher, Prudencio Bal­todano, was tied to a tree, bludgeoned with rifle butts, stabbed with bayonets, and had his ears cut off by a cadre of Sandinista troops mocking his faith. Similar stories occasionally leak out of Nicaragua. 
The Sandinistas' PR blitz in the U.S. and deliberate deception have prevented much of this information from being exposed here. A secret Spe­cial Investigations Commission set up by Interior Minister Tomas Borge, os­tensibly to investigate missing-persons claims was really designed to create plausible-sounding denials of atrocities, illegal arrests, and political murder. The Commission's director, Alvaro Baldizon, who defected to the U.S., admitted to the systematic slaughter of the Miskito Indians and numerous other villagers, incidents which were staged by Sandinista troops to look like "Contra" atrocities. Many "peace" groups swallowed this com­mission's reports whole. 
All of this socail Justice is supported by Catholic "Peace" groups across the 
U.S. Quixote Center, a Catholic relief agency, has channeled $40 million in aid to Nicaragua in the past year. Mis­guided "Peace Witness" groups unwit­tingly spread Sandinista propaganda as well. 
In a Gallup Poll, 71% of Hondurans and 85% of Costa Ricans said that the Sandinistas treated their own people with little to no justice. (These people hear about reality from the 200,000 refugees that have fled Nicaragua already.) Reality is the fact that the only thing about Social Justice that exists in Nicaragua is the flagrant lack of it.

P.O. Box Q 
AIDS policy needs to be extended 
Dear Editor: 

We were delighted to read the article in last Monday's Observer concerning the AIDS policy which has been adopted at St. Mary's. As described in the arti­cle, the policy shows a tremendous sen­sitivity to students who develop the dis­ease and also to the entire university community. The administration of St. Mary's is to be commended for its han­dling of this concern in such a forthright, unbiased and caring man­ner. 
We are concerned, however, that the policy seems to apply only to students. What about faculty or staff members who may contract AIDS? Would the same services be available to them, and would they have job security? We urge the administration of St. Mary's to address the needs of these members of the university community as well. 
We also wonder what steps are being taken at Notre Dame to address this same concern. St. Mary's has shown us the sensitive, just and caring manner in which this can be handled. We hope that the administration of Notre Dame will take notice and begin steps to develop an AIDS policy which applies to the students, faculty and staff of Notre Dame.

Rugby Club improving, takes third in tourney 
The Rugby Club prepared for Saturday's show­down with Marquette by placing third in the Indiana-Kentucky Union tourney in Indianapolis last weekend. 
The Irish defeated Indiana State, 19-0, in the first round before losing to Purdue, 7-6, in the semifinals. They came back to down Indiana, 3-0, in the con­solation game to improve their season record to 
4-1. 
"I was pleased with the way the team played," Club President Tim O'Connell said. "Defensively, we played really well. We had a couple of opportu­nities to win against Purdue. It was our second game of the day, and they had a bye into the second round. I think we played well considering the cir­cumstances." 
Notre Dame placed five players on the all-tourney team. O'Connell, Sean Evers, Bill Young, Jack McLaughlin and Francis Camillo received that honor. O'Connell also credited Andy Shea, Matt Senecal and Jim Lammers with contributing to the third-place finish. 
In earlier games this season, the Irish downed Michigan, 20-12, and Western Illinois, 19-3. "The season is going great so far," O'Connell said. "A lot of the younger guys are catching on to 

a basically unfamiliar game, and they're pretty dedicated to it." The game against Marquette will begin Saturday at 1:30 on the rugby field behind Stepan Center.

One big handicap that hurt the Irish was that all of the other teams compete on the varsity level, while they sail on the club level. 
"They had all of the best sailors," racing captain Pete Wall said. "We sailed pretty well. We didn't do anything wrong. They know more about making a boat go.

Twins clinch 

Blue Jays, Tigers both lose 
Associated Press 
TORONTO -Dale Sveum's three-run double capped a four­run fifth inning that lifted the Milwaukee Brewers to a 6-4 vic­tory over the first-place Toronto Blue Jays Monday night. 
Despite the loss, the Blue Jays remained two-and-a-half games ahead of second-place Detroit in the American League East race because the Tigers lost to Baltimore 3-0. 
Milwaukee sent 10 batters to the plate in the fifth, chasing starter Mike Flanagan and reliever Duane Ward before Mark Eichhorn ended the rally. 
Bill Wegman, 11-11, allowed four hits and two runs in 6 1-3 innings before giving way to Paul Mirabella, who allowed one hit in two innings. Mark Clear got the last two outs for his sixth save despite his throw­ing error that allowed two runs to score. 
Flanagan, 6-8, was the loser, allowing four runs on seven hits in 4 1-3 innings. 
Orioles 3, Tigers 0 
DETROIT -John Habyan pitched a five-hitter for 8 1-3 innings and Pete Stanicek had an RBI single and scored two runs Monday night as the Bal­timore Orioles beat the Detroit Tigers 3-0. 

Jack Morris, 18-11, gave up eight hits in eight innings and lost his third straight start. He walked five and struck out 10. 
Twice the Tigers bailed Mor­ris out with inning-ending double plays, but he allowed the leadoff man to reach base five times in the first seven in­nings. 
Yankees 9, Red Sox 7 
NEW YORK -Pinch-hitter Mike Easler's two-run homer capped a six-run, ninth-inning rally Monday night that gave the New York Yankees a 9-7 victory over the Boston Red Sox. 
Easler's fourth homer of the season came off Calvin Schiraldi, the fourth Red Sox reliever in the ninth, after pinch-hitter Jerry Royster hit a two-run single off loser Joe Sambito, 2-6.

"Everything possible did go wrong," said Grace. "But I felt good about the way we played. We did everything we needed to do to win. " 
Everything clicked for the Irish in the 5-0 drubbing of Bos­ton College. McCourt and midfielder Joe Sternberg each recorded two goals, and Paul LaVigne, playing forward for the first time, scored his first goal of the season with less than a minute to play. Morris had two of the assists.

The Irish will travel to the University of Michigan to compete in the Cary-Price Regatta this weekend. 


After a 2-0 loss to Saint Mary's earlier in the week, the Women's Soccer Club rebounded for a 1-0 victory over Purdue Saturday. 
Teresa Sheppard scored the lone goal on a penalty shot in the first half, while goalie Helen Gilboy re­corded the shutout. 
"The defensive play was very good," Club Pres­ident Kate Titterton said. "Helen Gilboy played a fantastic game; she was very impressive. We really played well together." The Irish, now 2-3-1, play at Saint Mary's today at 4:30. They host Hope Col­lege Thursday at 4 p.m. and then travel to Miami of Ohio Saturday for a 2 p.m. contest. 


The Women's Golf Club did not compete in its scheduled tourney at Purdue last week. The team will be back in action next Monday with a match at Evansville.

The Saint Mary's soccer team combined strong offense and sharp defense to hold the Boilermakers to a 1-1 tie Sat­urday at Purdue. 
Head Coach Tom Van Meter said he felt his team passed up some promising opportunities. 
"Early in the game, K.C. Chandler had a strong kick from outside that just missed, hitting the left post," he said. 
Van Meter was pleased with his team's consistent pressure on the Boilers and felt his defense was key. 
The visitors put the first point on the scoreboard. Five minutes into the second half, Mollie Meehan scored an unas­sisted goal from the corner. 

The Belles posed another threat later in the half when three SMC forwards suwonded the goal, only to have the ball blocked by a Boiler defender. 
With a mere three minutes left in the game, the Boilers caught the Belles off guard and evened the score at one apiece. 
"We played well at times," said Van Meter, "but it was our sloppy play at the end of the game that hurt us." 
The Belles take on Notre Dame at home today at 4:30 p.m.

SMC tennis takes fourth place, gains experience in tourney 
By HEATHER ATKINSON Sports Writer 
The Saint Mary's tennis team placed fourth this weekend in the tournament held at Leeper Park. The tournament did not affect the regular season stand­ings so the Belles remain unde­feated with a record of 9-0. 
There were eight teams in the competition, which was an individually-flighted tourna­ment with a feed-in consola­tion, meaning that all equally seeded players were in a draw together and must be defeated twice to be out. 
Each player played four or five matches each day. This tested the endurance and ten­nis ability of the players. 
"The tournament is a really good opportunity to play the NCAA division I schools in preparation for the district tournament in October," said coach Debbie Lauverie. "All of the schools we played were NCAA, except for Saint Frances, and I think to finish fourth as the only non­scholarship school is excel­lent." 
Dr. Jo-Ann Nester, who isba­sically administrative, ran the tournament for Saint Mary's allowing Lauverie to devote her total concentration on the coaching of the team. 
Many Saint Mary's players turned in outstanding perfor­mances. 
Freshman Sarah Mayer finished in third place with im­pressive wins. Mayer beat a Saint Frances College player, the Belles biggest rival, and also a Butler player. 
"I was very impressed with Sarah's performance," said Lauverie. "She showed a lot of heart as well as talent." 
Mary Turk, also a freshman, finished in third place as well. She beat a senior player from Toledo University. 
''At the beginning of the year, I knew she (Turk) had a lot of talent but her improvement has really impressed me," Lauverie said. "She's become a major contributing factor for our team." 
Turk also teamed up with Jane Schnell to defeat Toledo in the final consolation for third place in the doubles competi­tion. 
Also victorious in the doubles category were Charlene Szajko and Mayer who defeated 

/ 

Xavier University in a long match. 
The tournament provided an excellent opportunity to deter­mine the full potential of each girls' tennis talent. 
"We've been playing a lot of schools our size up until now and I knew going into the tourn­ament that it would be a real telltale sign of how good we really were," said coach Lauverie. "I was very happy with how they played against the NCAA schools." 
Toward the end of the tourn­ament the Belles won three im­portant matches because of their strong endurance that outlasted the opponents'. Some players' confidence levels were low, however, and they were defeated. 
"A few players lost really close matches. I feel they were just as good as the big schools' players but our girls didn't believe they were," said Lauverie. "But all in all, after three years of coaching, this year's team is by far the best team I've ever coached. I'm very impressed with them." 
The next match for the Belles will be October 2 against Taylor University.

The Belles served 10 aces to aid them in their victory. Mar­garet Feldman had 19 kills and Mary McCarthy chipped in 39 setting assists for the kills that were taken. 
The Belles will travel to Bet­hel College for a match today.
