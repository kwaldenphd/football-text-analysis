Loss of aid causes student to rethink bias against women 
Everywhere, on TV, in magazines, or in the classroom, there is the endless impassioned litany from an admittedly small, yet vocal fac­tion of women (and interestingly a greater num­ber of men, statistics indicate) about how bad women have it. 
Read Ellen Goodman and see what I mean. "Women are so oppressed in this paternalistic society," "Men are responsible for all the evils in the world like fascism,, capitalism and the Catholic Church," etc., etc., etc. One hears this proclaimed so vehemently that one starts to get the impression that whitt~ females have had things as bad as black males. 
When it comes down to dollars and cents at least, however, things are not so simple. I learned this during break when my sisters and I got our FAF estimates giving our expected total family contributions for school. 
Consider this: My sisters and I filled out F AF forms that were virtually copied from each other with the exception olf names and gender. Each of us are Notre Dame Scholars, so each of us are fully entitled to seholarships as solely a function of our financial need. 
Nevertheless, when I opened my FAF state­ment, I read that I or my family is expected to pay $2,259-$2,759 for next year. When one of my sisters opened her statement, however, she found that she or the family was expected to pay half this amount. 
Not only this, but with r·egard to federal aid my statement said: "Based on your answers to FAF questions 19, 20, 21, and 22, you are con­sidered to be a dependent student for the pur­poses of this estimate." 
Contrast this with my sister's statement: "Based on the information you gave, you ap­pear to be eligible for a PE!ll Grant." 
Now I don't want to overreact. A few thousand dollars may seem a lot to me now, but I am sure when I am 50 years old I will barely notice the difference and will probably just laugh at the fact that I could have taken such a frivolous worldly thing so seriously Jttow (Ha!). 
At the moment, howeve.r, this bewildering discrepancy does not seem very funny. As a matter of principle I am sympathetic with any group that is an underdog. But can one really count women among the minorities like blacks and Hispanics as groups that are disadvan­taged? 
Some sociology books wm tell you that the entire female gender undergoes devious socialization pressures in, for example, the family and in school, supposedly leading to fear of success and low self-esteem. Yet in my high school at least, the overwhelming majority of the top graduates were women, even though three of the four SAT National Finalists were men. 
Furthermore, although some women say they felt left out with regard to certain student ac-

tivities, such as sports, I question whether everything is such a one-way street as the media would have us believe. During my high­school education, for example, my English teacher once harped at me for not getting in­volved in some "program for gifted students." After I finally agreed to participate, however, he learned with some embarrassment that in this case "gifted students" could only be female. 
Still, we have Phil Donahue, Gloria Steinem and all of the Virginia Slims advertisements telling us how incredibly short-changed an en­tire 50 percent of the human species is. But isn't this all a bit melodramatic? Who are the people who write all of these books, host all of these shows, produce all of these commercials and give all of these lectures but members of the Establishment itself? 
Someone is probably playing amateur psy­chologist and saying that I am only showing my insecurities by saying this. Maybe so. 
But tell me how secure you would feel if you were gipped out of several grand, and then on top of this told that the people who got your 
several grand are being discriminated against.

Soviets deploying new missiles, says Pentagon 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -The Soviet Union continues to deploy new models of nuclear missiles with an eye toward achieving mili­tary superiority while conduct­ing laser experiments against 
U.S. airplanes, the Pentagon said Tuesday. 
Russia is also devoting al­most three times as much of its gross national product to weap­ons purchases compared to the United States. And it shows no signs of slowing that build-up, "no matter who is general sec­retary; no matter what proposals are made, no matter what public relations activities are undertaken," said Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger. 
. The Soviet weapons drive also extends to its conventional arsenal, with dozens of new MiG-29 Fulcrum jet fighters along with tanks, artillery pieces and ships having been produced over the past year. 
This grim assessment of Moscow's military might was released by Weinberger in the form of the Pentagon's annual publication, "Soviet Military Power." Now in its sixth edi-

"We must realize that we are competing with a dynamic, and an expanding, Soviet military threat," Weinberger said. 
Overall, the booklet con­cludes that Soviet military ex­penditures are consuming be­tween 15 percent and 17 percent of Russia's gross national prod­uct. By comparison, Pentagon spending consumes about 6 percent of America's GNP. 
The report was released hours before Weinberger went to Capitol Hill to push for the administration's request for a 3 percent increase after infla­tion in the defense budget for the next fiscal year. 
Weinberger referred to the booklet on several occasions, telling the House Armed Ser­vices Committee that it outlined the "very real threat, the growing threat" presented by the Soviet military machine.

Magic Kingdom to come to Franc~e 
Associated Press 
PARIS -Mickey Mouse and the Magic Kingdom are coming to Europe, under a contract Premier Jacques Chirac signed Tuesday for a $2 billion Disney theme park outside Paris. 
The world's fourth Disney park is to open in 1992 on a 4,400­acre site in rural Marne-la­Vallee, 20 miles east of Paris. 
French officials say it will create 30,000 new jobs and should draw about 10 million visitors a year. 
"We think France is the ideal country to welcome Eurodis­neyland," Michael Eisner, president of the Walt Disney Co., said at the signing cere­mony. 
Speaking in French, he told reporters, "It is difficult to im-

agine a country richer in artis­tic traditions. It is as respectful beneficiaries of this cultural richness that we come to France." 
Chirac told a news confer­ence the venture marked the first time France signed a con­tract with a private foreign company for a project on French soil, "but I'm sure it will be a great success because it's Disney Co. and France." The French negotiators, sensi­tive to inroads on their culture, won what they consider impor­tant concessions from the Walt Disney company aimed at guaranteeing a French and European flavor to the theme park. 
Negotiations took nearly two years. Jean-Rene Bernard, negotiator for the French gov-

for the dignity and welfare of the majority of the population (of Central America) olther than armed revolution." 
In addition Jerez argued Mar­xism is no less compatible with Catholicism than with the nationalism of the Nicaraguan patriot Sandino. Many Sandi­nistas do not regard religion as the "opiate of the people" as Marx did, but as a "sea of 
liberation," Jerez said. 
The Nicaraguan Jesuit said that although the current Cath­olic University in Managua is not totally subservient to the 
ernment, said he estimates Eurodisneyland will contribute $500 million a year to Franee's gross domestic product. 
Eurodisneyland is to include 13,500 hotel rooms, camping grounds, sports facilities ailld a large commercial complex spread through five villages. Total cost could go as high as $7.5 billion, with the first phase to be completed in 1992 and other themes to be completed in 1995, officials said. 
Like the world's three otlher Disneyland theme parks, the centerpiece of Eurodisneyland will be the Magic Kingdom dominated by a huge Cin­derella castle and populated by familiar Disney characters. 
But Eurodisneyland will dif­fer from the parks in Anaheim, Calif.; Orlando, Fla., and Tokyo. 
Vatican, it is still "Christian in­spired." Under Somoza there was not even a Catholic Uni­versity of Nicaragua, Jerez said, because of Somoza's desire to prevent foreign intru­sions from the Vatican. This concern continues in fact to be legitimate, Jerez said.

This week marks the rebirth of the long lost Voice of the Fighting Irish. 
From its new LaFortune studio and with a much stronger signal, WVFI-AM 64 once again offers a much-needed alternative to the programming of South Bend radio stations. 
For a long time, the efforts of the WVFI staff were not fully appreciated, as the station could not be heard by many students. Fortunately, this has changed. WVFI has moved from its old offices in O'Shaughnessy Hall and has purchased new equipment. 
Much of WVFI's progress was made possible by the University, which made a financial commitment to the radio station. This support must be continued. Improvements still must be made at WVFI, as not all students can hear the station clearly in their dorms. 
But WVFI should be proud of the improvements it has made so far. The station plans to combine its progressive music with hourly updates of campus events. With new equipment and a fresh outlook, WVFI should once again be an avenue for cultural expression on a campus often cited for a lack of diversity. 
Welcome back, WVFI. Best of luck, and may you never leave the airwaves again.

Tuesday's cartoon found close-minded 
Dear Editor: 

In response to the sexist propaganda 
found in the "Beer Nuts" comic strip 
on Tuesday, March 24, I offer this con­
tinuation of the vignette: 
" ... and in Mark Williams' apparently 
distraught and disgruntled beer-nut­
boy-abroad the European 'girls' noted 
nothing wonderful or sexy or open­
minded or liberal. In fact, they would 
have overlooked him completely had 
he not choked on, and subsequently 
thrown up, a hairball right there in the 
airport lobby."

Charity Ball ushered in by Special Events Week 
Dear Editor: 

In 1984, two concerned Notre Dame students decided that they wanted to do something to help to end world hunger. The result of their vision, dedication and hard-work was the first Notre Dame-Saint Mary's College Charity Ball. This year marks the third annual Charity Ball, with each succes­sive one raising more money for Cath­olic Relief Services, and the working toward elimination of the hungry of this world. 
This year the Charity Ball Committee has decided to enlarge the scope of the event by instituting a Special Events Week prior to the Ball itself. The pur­pose of this week would be to provide revenue through additional fundraisers. For these reasons a spe­cial Charity Night at Theodore's has been arranged, and the Student Activ­ities Board has graciously agreed to donate the profits from its usual Friday night movie. 
More importantly, though, the com­mittee decided that it would be benefi­cial to the Charity Ball and to Catholic Relief Services if events aimed at raising awareness of the world hunger problem were also planned. This year the committee acquired two very spe­cial movies highlighting the issue of hunger and also has been fortunate to have a lecture given by one of Notre Dame's own professors, Denis Goulet, on his experiences in the Third World. These two events were planned in hopes that the Notre Dame community would become intimately involved with the hungry of our world. 
The Special Events Week will be a special time for all students and faculty at Notre Dame and Saint Mary's to unite together to work to end the suf­fering of other human beings. But it will also be a time to give a little and enjoy a lot. We hope you attend as many of the planned activities as you can. 
Michelle LaRose Special Events Coordinator 
Dancin' Irish members deserved second chance 
Dear Editor: 
Why was the action of the university's ad hoc committee, which discussed the future of the Dancin' Irish, interpreted as a negative step? Our squad is quite excited that positive action has been taken by the administration to modify and better our organization. One such modification allows for an advisor within the Athletic Department. The advisor is simply going to act as a con­stant communication link between us and the Athletic Department. We have viewed and do view the addition of said advisor as a necessary step to further our credibility within the Department of Athletics. 
As captains, we will also be selecting a second person, a coach, who will ob­jectively evaluate our administrative decisions and dance performances. 
Confirming Fr. Rocca's quoted state­ments, our group was not able to reach our potential effectiveness on the foot­ball field due to the inaudibility of the band music coming from the opposite corner. 
It is a shame that it required a nega­tive decision on the part of the Faculty Board in Control of Athletics in order to prompt the administration's recogni­
tion  of  our organization's justifiable  
existence.

A Fair Shake 
Durgens Aims to Unify ND 
KATHY SCARBECK features writer 

A 
glance across the dining hall or a walk down the quad makes one realize just how small six percent really is. Comprising this narrow percentage of the population, Notre Dame's minority students face special problems associ· ated with life on a predominantly white campus. Kenneth Durgens, director of Minority Affairs at P'lotre Dame, has been trying to help foster a "sense of belonging" in these students. 
"The racial climate is turning colder on campus," says Our­gens, quoting the headline from a recent article in The Chicago Tribune. "I think it's probably safe to say that's also happening here, a more subtle type, probably an isolation. What I do to combat that is basically try to build self­esteem and develop programs they can rally around and help them understand who they are." 
With these interests in mind, Durgens has adopted the plan of building the self-esteem of minority students in order to help them adjust to Notre Dame. An increase in self­esteem helps students to bet­tter understand themselves. "Understanding who they are means they are going to be a stronger organization, and being a stronger organization means they are going to be more secure," Durgens said. 
Durgens has plenty of experi­
ence in helping minority stu­
dents adjust to college life. 
Prior to starting work at Notre 
Dame in October 1986, Our­
gens earned masters degrees 
in counselling and college stu­
dent personel and held the 
positions of residential direc­
tor, admissions counselor, and 
coordinator of minority affairs 
at various Institutions.

Durgens describes his job as having an "ali-purpose" role in dealing with the Black. Hispanic, and Native American students at Notre Dame. Our­gens serves as advisor to the Black Cultural Arts Council and the Black Cultural Arts Festival, and also works with student leaders in developing and Im­plementing their programs. He is a liaison between students and the administration and staff. 
Durgens fills the position vacated by the former director, Ed Blackwell. "I think my style is a little bit different," said Durgens In reference to his predecessor. "''m probably more of a hands-on type of person, whlh means I will at­tend organizational meetings and events. I'll do that little extra." 
Senior Esther Ivory, chairper­son of the Black Cultural Arts Festival, approves of Durgens' manner of handling his role. "He's very approachable, which I think the students like. He's not a straight-collar type of person," she said. "He is a lot different than Blackwell but in a positive way. Two people can't be the same. They each have a different perspective on what the office is. Mr. Durgens is more personable, and he feels the need to be with stu­dents." 
Junior Lisa Boykin, who has also worked closely with Our­gens, cites his "down-to-earth" character as being a positive attribute in carrying out his duties. "He asks everyone to call him Ken, and you can just go talk to him as a friend and not an administrator," Boykin said. "If more administrators here were as approachable as Ken, every aspect of life here would improve. He genuinely has our interests at heart." 
Self-understanding is also fundamental to being able to cope with the problem of rae­ism. "A lot of today's students aren't even exactly sure what racism is when it smacks them. When they finally figure oUJt what it Is, they are really mad and don't know how to cope with it," he said. "If you dE!al with who you are, then you deal from a position of strength, and you will not be reactive. You will be pro­active." 

Commitment on the part of the whole university Is neces­sary to help attract more minority students to Notre Dame. "I think the university is committed, but sometimes the word 'commitment' doesn't get carried out. Mr. Rooney, (director of undergraduate ad­missions), is doing a great. job, but I think other areas of the university could be involved. I'm not sure commitment Is being given over a long pE::riod of time, and I don't just mean saying you are going to give it." 
Once minority students are admitted, particular attention needs to be given to retaining these students. Durgens com­pares minorities to any other special interest group on campus; they receive added attention and things are pro­vided for them. "We're not as­king for special concessions. We are trying to seek things every student here is seeking, and that is a feeling of belong­ing." Durgens said. 
In order to help increase this sense of belonging. Durgens suggests that more people at­tend events sponsored by minority groups. They can serve as learning tools and provide more information about various minority com­munities and their cultures. "If one segment of Notre Dame isn't happy, then we can't ali be happy," Boykin said. "''m thankful that we have Ken, be­cause things are going to con­tinue to Improve and change."

Erin Go Bragh! 
A day of green away from the golden dome 
SEAN HICKEY features writer 

T 
he parties and holiday festivities of the Feast of St. Patrick rarely occur anymore under the Dome. Due to the alcohol policy and the arbitrary dating of Spring Break. St. Patrick's Day on Notre Dame turf has quieted down In recent years. Neverthe­less, age-old traditions of corned beef and cabbage, green grog and Irish dance and song thrive in other parts of the country. 
As a newcomer to the N.D. scene, I heard about St. Patrick's Day under the Dome and anticipated Mar. 17. Dlsappoinment struck when I learned that Spring Break was scheduled during the week of St. Patty's. 
However, my father saved the day with an invititation to join him for lunch and some pub crawling on Mar. 17. 
Our rendezvous point was at The Maple, which was a favorite gathering place for Hartford, Conn. area Irishmen. There the atmosphere was crowded, boisterous and redolent of seasoned corned beef and cabbage. Lawyers, politicians, judges, neighbor­hood characters. and other assorted types mingled and soon found themselves caught up in the festivity of the day. Everyone's an Irishman on St. Patrick's Day. 
Not surprisingly, conversation was full of the same wit and sharp, bantering humor found in Irish pubs from Dublin to Galway. Where else could one hear such characterizations of Catholic schools as: "Holy Cross--a school founded on a bluff(Pakachoag Hill) and getting by on one ever since," or "Manhattan--the only college In America named after a cocktail." 
The St. Patrick's Pipe Band fllled the pub with tunes of Irish folksongs and ballads. The band spent the week prior to the Holiday parading and performing concerts in bars and convales­cent homes. When one piper was asked the whereabouts of another, we learned that the pace had been too much for him-­"We buried him last night." But pipers are a notoriously sturdy lot and most of them survive the annual ordeal. 
An outstanding citizen nicknamed "The Leprachaun" sputtered remarks that typified the old, parochial New England Irish philosophy: "When my children were to pick a partner, I said to be sure they are Irish, Catholic, Democrat, a Red Sox fan, and an 
N.D. fan." 
Several old-timers reminisced about the good old days when a former political leader in Hartford ran an after-hours establish­ment, or speakeasy, In defiance of the then 12 a.m. closing laws on Saturday nights--"The place was as dark as a graveyard on the outside, but once Inside--it was lit up like Times Square on New Year's Eve, "said one Irishman. Another recalled giving "political speeches for $5 a night for Tammany Hall in the Bronx In 1933 during the depression when (he) would have accepted a contract on someone's throat for $1.50." 
Moving into another pub, I was introduced to the former State's Attorney, who was noted for his satirical essays on the past misfortunes and future lack of prospects of the Ill-fated Boston Red Sox. particularly one entitled "In the End They'll Break Your Heart." Who can forget his apt description of the Bosox Manager in 1978--"Who else but Don Zimmer could have snatched defeat from the jaws of victory?" 
As the afternoon drew to a close, we withdrew from a day bathed In Irish culture and returned to the sight of the Irish Tricolor flapping in the wind on the flagpole in our front yard. The Irish in America may be a vanishing group and quickly­blending Into the general population, but in Connecticut, at least for a week each year, they are still a group easily recognized.

goal outburst to put the game out of reach. 
"We controlled the game," observed O'Leary. "The out­come was never really in doubt." 
Unfortunately, victory was not so certain on the rest of the trip, as Irish scoring decreased while the opposition's in­creased. 
Against Washington and Lee, Notre Dame was outscored 7-2 in the third quarter, erasing a 6-2 Irish lead. That run proved to be decisive, as the Irish never regained the lead. 
The Villanova game, mean­while, was one that the Irish felt they should have won. The sloppy conditions of the field resulted in a low-scoring game, 
...
which is not the type of game Notre Dame wants to play. 
"I was disappointed with our play," said O'Leary. "We are a better team than we showed against Villanova, but we're also relatively young. It was something to learn from." 
The Irish will try to even their slate this weekend against Colgate, a school which O'Leary feels will give his team a real challenge. 
"We'll have to be more ag­gressive against Colgate, and we need to increase our scoring," O'Leary noted. "The key will be to try and gain some consistency, because the poten­tial is definitely there."

The Notre Dame men's ten­nis team completed a success­ful seven-meet swing through California over spring break, going 6-1 and playing its best tennis of the year. 
The Irish are hoping to ride that wave of momentum to an­other victory this afternoon at Courtney Courts, this time against the University of Illinois-Chicago. 
Notre Dame head coach Tom Fallon felt that the results of the West Coast trip, mean­while, were indicative of good things ahead for his squad. Fal­lon's Irish had been beset by injuries over the early part of the season, but now appear to have gelled into a solid unit. 
"I really feel that this is as 
well as I can expect us to play 
at this point," said Fallon, in 
his 31st and final year as the 
Irish mentor. "The nice wea­
ther and constant play gave me 
a good chance to evaluate what 
we had this year and I liked 
what I saw. Both singles and 
doubles play was consistent 
and that's the kind of thing I'd 
like to see us maintain."

NEW YORK -La Salle used the 3-point shooting of Tim Legler and Rich Tarr in the first half and the inside play of freshman Lionel Simmons in the second to defeat Arkansas­Little Rock 92-73 in a semifinal game of the National Invitation Tournament. 
La Salle, 20-12, advanced to Thursday's championship game against Southern Missis­sippi, which defeated Ne­braska in the night's other semifinal. 
Legler finished with 26 points, Tarr had 23 and Sim­mons 21 for La Salle. James Dawn led UALR with 19 points and Paul Springer had 12.

The Irish opened their road swing with an 8-1 win on Satur­day, March 14 against LoyolaMarymount, and the following day they drubbed Cal State (Los Angeles), 6-0, with no doubles played because the meet was already decided after the singles matches. 
On Monday, Notre Dame swamped Pierce College 8-1, again sweeping all six singles spots. 
Wednesday afternoon's meet with Whittier College proved to be the most lopsided meet of the trip, with the Irish surren­dering only six total games as a team on their way to a 9-0 rout. On Thursday, the Irish tasted defeat for the only time during break, bowing 5-4 to the University of California at Riverside. In the hotly­contested battle, nine sets went to tiebreakers and five of the nine matches went the full three sets, with the Irish win­ning only two. 
The Irish rounded out the trip with a 7-2 win over Cal State (Bakersfield) and a 6-3 pasting of Claremont.

NEW YORK-Randolph Keys and John White scored all of Southern Mississippi's points during a 15-2 second-half spurt that broke open a close game and gave the Golden Eagles an 82-75 victory over Nebraska perfect 7-0, and sophomore Brian Kalbas, who went 6-1 for the trip, feels that things are starting to click as the team's confidence increases. 
''We beat some quality teams in California, and we had plenty of chances to beat River­side and finish th'e trip unde­feated," said Kalbas, who has seen action at number two, three, and four singles this year. "We started out the year a little bit erratic, lbut now that a lot of people are playing some of their best tennis, we're really coming into our own." 
The Irish, now 13-8 on the year, host the University of Illinois-Chicago today at the Courtney Tennis Center at 3 
p.m.. As Fallon explains, the Irish already hav«~ an advan­tage going in. 
"Chicago has had a problem with a couple of its starters, and they won't be able to play against us," said Fallon. "That means we've alrealdy won two out of nine matches, and that's a tough hole for any visiting team to climb out of, especially the way we're playing.

SAN ANTONIO -A solid per­formance in all areas led the Notre Dame baseball team to win an impressive six out of 10 games over spring break in Texas. 
With this momentum behind them, the Irish now will open their home schedule by facing Lewis this afternoon at 2 on Jake Kline field. The game has been designated Poster Day, and every fan in attendence will receive a free Irish baseball poster, complete with the spring schedule. 
In Texas, the pitching contin­ued to be consistently strong, as hurlers Mike Passilla, John Gleeson, Brian Piotrowicz, Kevin Chenail, Robert Fitz and Mike Harmon all registered victories. Piotrowicz and Chenail combined to allow only 10 hits over the final two games of the 10-game series. 
But the Irish also came alive at the plate. In the team's six wins, 36 runs were scored be­hind the powerful hitting of shortstop Pat Pesavento, out­fielder Dan Peltier and first baseman Tim Hutson. 
"The team gained a lot of confidence when it came to hit­ting," said Irish head coach Larry Gallo. "We also found that we were coming back to win games and that we had con­sistent pitching." 
Notre Dame improved to a 6-7 record on the season during

Observer Staff Rt~port 

Spring workouts have offi­cially begun for the Notre Dame football team, but five members of the squad will not be taking part because of dis­ciplinary reasons, the South Bend Tribune reported Tues­day. 
Suspended for the entire spring season are junior linebacker Cedric Figaro, sophomore linebacker Dan Quinn, and freshman offensive linemen Jeff Pearson, John Zaleski, and Jason Cegielski. 
Irish head coach Lou Holtz declined to comment on any specific reasons for the suspen­sions, but hinted that the players may be able to return in August for fall workouts before the opening of the 1987 season. 
Figaro, a 6-3, 232-pound out­side linebacker, started all 11 games for the Irish last season, making 59 tackles to put him third on the team in that cate­gory. Figaro also set a Notre Dame record for fumble recoveries with se,ven.

3-point long shot took longshots a long way 
Like it, love it, or hate it, you just can't ignore it. 
The three-point basket has made quite an impact in its initial year as part of the NCAA Tournament. The Runnin' Rebels of UNLV have enjoyed outside shooting's new twist all season, but never were they as glad to see that stripe of paint before their feet as last Sunday when the Rebels beat Iowa. 
Rick Rietbrock 
Irish Items 
UNLV hit 10-of-19 three-pointers in the second half to overcome a 19-point Iowa lead. Of course, the Rebels' 1-of-11 shooting from long distance in the first half had a little to do with their 19-point deficit in the first place. 
Another team to utilize the home-run shot with a great deal of success is Providence. Billy Donovan and Delray Brooks have made a practice of launching bombs fre­quently. And it got them to the Final Four. 
The other Final Four teams, Indiana and Syracuse, use the shot a bit differently. Steve Alford is one of the best in the business at hitting it, and Syracuse's Carl Monroe can shoot it with some consistency, but the other players on those squads rarely fire from the boonies. 
Notre Dame also used the three-point shot uncharac­teristically often against TCU. David Rivers made five from long range after hitting only 14 all season, and they provided the difference in the one-point victory. 
There are still a lot of questions surrounding the three­point shot. Some say if you're going to award three points for the long shots, you should make dunks and layups worth one, half-court shots worth five and maybe give 25 for a desperation heave from the opposite foul line. 
Others think its the greatest thing invented since caffeine-free soft drinks. While the line will probably inch back a couple of feet, the· rule appears to have made a few points with the NCAA. 
And without it, the Final Four may have had quite a different lineup.

One of the sadder stories to come out during the tourn­ament was the Gary McLain article in Sports Illustrated. In the midst of the tournament hoopla, McLain's revela­tions about his drug use reminded everyone that the world of sports still has many dark sides that even the incredible upsets, thrilling finishes and great performances can't cover up. 
McLain's story puts a cloud over one of college basket­ball's most fabled tournaments. Villanova's unlikely vic­tory over the dominating Georgetown Hoyas of the Patrick Ewing era was one of the great Cinderalla stories that the sport had witnessed, and now even that has a black eye. 
While McLain has tarnished the Villanova reputation with his story, head coach Rollie Massimino and the ad­mininistration should share some of the blame. And it would be a shame to see McLain turned into a hero for "bravely" giving us his story of how he used drugs during his years at Villanova, a story he reportedly received $40,000 for telling. 
At the time, the miracle victory seemed too good to be true. Now we see that it was.
