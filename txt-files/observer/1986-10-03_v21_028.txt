Hesburgh forms business grants committee 
By PEGGY PROSSER Staff Reporter 
A national committee of busi­ness executives has been formed by University President Father Theodore Hesburgh to assist the University in soliciting grants from major corporations. 
Michael Kenahan, director of foundation and corporate rela­tions for the University, said the National Corporate Grants Com­mittee will not meet as a whole, but will endorse proposals made by the University. 
"We do the ground work in terms of contacting the corpora­tions and submitting the proposals, and they (the commit· tee) are there to back us up," said Kenahan. 
"They will serve to help us in our fundraising with major cor­porations around the country," he said. 
The specific amount of money sought has not been deter· mined, but Kenahan quoted a starting figure of "about $1 0 mil­lion." 
The committee members are geographically distributed across the nation in the hope that each member's corporation will attract other nearby corporations to the University's projects, said Kenahan. 
Kenahan said many of the cor­porations would be giving only 

· for the sake of helping Notre 
Dame. 
"It is a good investment on 

their part in helping Notre Dame 
to become a better school and 
improving Notre Dame pro­
grams," said Kenahan. 
Citing national competition for 

grants, Kenahan said many uni­
versities, such as Purdue and In­
diana, attract large corporate 
sponsorships by supplying the 
companies with their graduates. 
He said one company, General 
Motors, contributes heavily to 
Purdue and then hires many of 
the university's engineering 
graduates.

Buzz bus carries buzzed students 
By KATHY ROE Staff Reporter 
Knowing that nothing is worse than the hassle of finding a ride home after a night off-campus, the Hall Presidents' Council has come up with a new idea: the Buzz Bus. 
The bus service operates every weekend on Friday and Saturday nights between midnight and 3:00a.m. Running on half hour cycles, the Buzz Bus stops first at Senior Bar and then travels on to the Five Points' area.. 
From there, the route runs past the corner of Howard and St. Louis streets and Notre Dame apartments. Stops on campus in­clude the Main Circle, St. Mary's in front of Holy Cross, and the Library Circle. The bus' final stop is along Ivy Road near Campus View and Turtle Creek apart­ments. 
Students can get on at any point along the route for the cost of twenty five cents, said HPC Co­chairman Joanie Cahill. 
She said, however, that stu­dents cannot get off at either Senior Bar or the Five Points' area because the service is not meant to support the bar scene. 
The idea for Buzz Bus was in­troduced to the Hall Presidents' Council last spring in response to increased concern about stu­dents driving after drinking, said Cahill. 
She said similar services spon­sored at other universities pro­vided the basic model. 

Cahill said the program's aim is to assure students a safe ride home. Cahill also noted that when students get separated from their friends during an eve' ning out, they do not have to worry about being stranded. 
Having been in progress for the past two weekends, the Buzz Bus program has had consider· able success, serving over 200 students, said Cahill. 
But Cahill hopes for increased ridership as student awareness of the program develops. If its success continues, she said the service will be extended to Thursday nights. 
Plans are also in the works for the sale of passes that grant stu­dents a specified number ofrides aboard the Buzz Bus. 
viding improved computer facilities, endowed professor­ships, and Memorial Library im· provements through the assis­tance of the committee, said Kenahan. 
All of these improvements, Kenahan said, would benefit stu­dents and the corporations for

Reagan veto of sanctions overridden 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON The Senate voted 78-21 Thursday to over­ride President Reagan's veto of tough new sanctions against South Africa, joining the House in enacting measures designed to force Pretoria's white-minority government to abandon apar­theid. 
In dealing Reagan one of the most dramatic foreign policy set­backs of his presidency, and the first substantive override of a Reagan veto, the Senate rebuffed administration pleas that the punitive economic sanctions would prove most harmful to South Africa's blacks. Five previ­ous Reagan vetos, on lesser .is­sues, had been reversed. 
Despite fierce lobbying by Reagan and other White House officials, and members of the Senate supportive of the qllmin· istration's policy, the final vote showed the president falling 13 votes short of the 34 needed to sustain the veto. 
Forty-seven Democrats and 31 Republicans voted to override Reagan, while 21 GOP law­makers voted to back Reagan. Sen. Jake Gam, R-Utah, who recently donated one of his kid­neys to a daughter, was absent. 
In a statement issued from the White House, Reagan said that despite his objections to the measure, "Our administration will, nevertheless implement the law. It must be recognized, however, that this will not solve the serious problems that plague that country." 
Vice-President George Bush, presiding over the Senate, an­nounced that the Senate's sanc­tions measure had passed, "the

Senior Father /Daughter Weekend more than just th~ events planned 
Senior FathelJDaughter weekend. What does it 
mean? For me it is a time to reflect on the past 
and share a lifetime of memories with my father. 
I look back on the past four years and I can't 
believe it has gone so fast. I remember my senior 
year of high school like it was yesterday. I was 
confused about the future and I remember looking 
to my father for advice.about where to go to col­
lege, and basically what to do with my life. I re­
member some of the guidelines he set for me; l 
hi'ld to attend a Catholic college and I had to take 
a year of accounting. As it ended up l spent my 
freshman year at Iowa State University --much to 
my father's dismay. After that year. I realized I 
had to "get serious" about my education. I wanted 
to learn and not just get by. I then turned to my' 
father for more advice, which he willingly gave to 
me. I transferred to Saint Mary's. He never said, 
"I told you so," but only encouraged me to excel 
in my new school. 
Senior FathelJDaughter Weekend is not only going to senior bar for a dance contest. or watch­ing the Alabama-Notre Dame game, or even going to Casino Night. It is also a time of reflection. I reflect on the first dance I had with my father; when he attempted to teach me the waltz, while impatiently shouting. "Don't lead!" I also remem­ber the first Notre Dame game I watched with him --1 quickly learned the Notre Dame Victory March. 
I also remember my experiences in a casino. My first was when I was 14 and walked "on the carpet" in Las Vegas with my father. I also re­member gambling in Monte Carlo where he en­couraged me to double my bet each time in black 
jack; I was content betting the same amount each time. He's taught me to always strive to do the best I can do. I reflect upon these experiences and realize how much my father has given me and how much he has sacrificed on my behalf. He has taught me by his example and given me invaluable experiences. 
Now let's face it. We've all had fights, disagree­ments and completely different philosphies about life with our fathers. My father and I are no dif­ferent. He is 40 years my senior and I often feel the effects of the generation gap between us. Yet there is always a bond, because he is my father. This weekend will allow us to re-define that bond in our own words. Now, as a senior in college, I still look to my father for advice. What to do after graduation: graduate school? or a job? I feel 1am more mature and confident than I was as a senior in high school and through my father's examples and the education he has given me, I am able to realize more clearly, what I want to 
.achieve. My father has always been there for 
words of encouragement. Especially before final 
exams. I always receive a survival package -the · 
kind with apples, oranges, Trident Gum and other 
various kinds of food that is supposed to keep 
you sane during the long rigorous testing. In-

eluded in the packet is a note from my dad that reads, "If you don't pass, don't come home." He is also good about sending me letters --well semi­letters --more like a two-line note on the paper that says, "From the desk of... " He's always there to say, "Of course you can do it. what do you mean, you can't?" And of course, my friends and I always anxiously await the monthly box of candy he sends to me. 
This weekend gives me the opportunity to say thank you. Thank you for sacrificing. giving and being patient through my four different majors, my indesciveness about which college to attend and my inability to budget as well as I should. 
I look forward to the memories we will create this weekend. I realize being a senior not only means graduating and making my own life, but it also means finally cutting the rope; I will never live at home again. It will take an effort on both of our parts to keep in touch because it won't just happen by itself. This weekend can help start this effort and allow me to say I love you.

University receives gift for business studies 
Special to the Observer 
The University of Notre Dame has received a $250,000 gift from the Donnelly Corporation of Holland, Mich., toward the es­tablishment of a special aca­demic program in participatory management studies within the University's College of Business Administration. 
The Mr. and Mrs. John Donnel­ly, Sr. Program in Participatory Management memorializes John Donnelly, Sr., chairman of the board of Donnelly Corp, who died last June, and his wife Kat­herine. Born May 16, 191 2 in Holland, Mich., Donnelly studied chemical engineering at Notre Dame and completed work on his B.S. degree at Catholic Uni­versity of America. 
In 1932, he began to work for Donnelly Corporation, a manu­facturer of automobile acces­sories which had been founded by his father, Bernard. He be­came president of the Corpora­tion in 1960 and chairman of the board a few years later. He and Mrs. Donnelly have three chil­dren. 
"John Donnelly's frequent em­phasis on the crucial role of respect for the dignity of all people in management makes it particularly appropriate that a Notre Dame program will be named after him," said Father Theodore Hesburgh, president of the University. 
A frequent lecturer on man­agement and organizational themes, Donnelly was also active in several trade, civic, and church organizations. At various times he served as president of the Na­tional Council of Catholic Men, the Holland Chamber of Com­merce, and the Holland Hospital board.

WASHINGTON -Administration officials acknowledge the White House plotted to deceive Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi into thinking he faced a new round of U.S. bombing and a possible coup, but President Reagan in­sisted Thursday there was "not any plan of ours" to mislead the American people and the press. 
The aim of the secret plan was to convince Gadhafi that an American raid -such as the April 
15 attack by U.S. bombers against Tripoli and Benghazi ­was being planned against him, said administration sources who spoke on condition they not be identified. 
At the United Nations, Secre­tary of State George P. Shultz told a news conference Thursday night he sees nothing wrong with the use of disinformation cam­paigns to disorient opponents. 
"If I were a private citizen McMahon. 


The Washington Post reported in Thursday's editions that an elaborate White House campaign included "a disinformation pro­gram with the basic goal of making Gadhafi think that there is a high degree of internal op­position against him within Libya, that his key trusted aides are disloyal, that the U.S. is about to move against him militarily." 
The plan was described in a three-page memorandum sent to Reagan by John Poindexter, the president's national security adviser, and was adopted at a White House meeting Aug. 14, the Post said. 
The newspaper said the plan, as described in the memo, in­volved "a series of closely coor­dinated events involving covert, diplomatic, military and public actions." 
"Those (allegations) I chal­lenge," Reagan said in the inter­view, a partial transcript ofwhich was released by the White House. "They were not a part of any meeting I've ever attended. . .. This was not any plan of ours."

At another point, he said he knows of no decision "to have people go out and tell lies to the media." 
Meanwhile, the Senate Intelli­gence Committee staff con­ducted an immediate inquiry into whether the CIA had violated presidential prohibitions against planting phony stories with U.S. news organizations and reached a preliminary conclusion that no regulations were broken either in letter or spirit, said the commit­tee's staff director, Bernie

"The record growth in poverty among children has not been ac­companied by increased availability of key safety net pro­grams," said the report by the Democratic-run House Select Committee on Children, Youth and Families. 
"To the contrary, support pro­grams are not reaching the majority of those in need, are not most available where child poverty is greatest." 
But the report. entitled "Safety Net Programs: are They Reaching Poor Children?." drew blistering dissents from the panel's 10 Re­publican members. 
"By ignoring important facts and using faulty methodology (the report) disqualifies itself from serious consideration by those interested in improving our welfare programs," said a 33-page dissent signed by seven GOP members.

Associated Press 
NEW DELHI, india -A man in an army uniform fired a homemade pistol Thursday at Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and President Zail Singh, missing them but slightly wounding six other people. Authorities said the captured assailant did not belong to a terror group. 
The shooting triggered an in­vestigation into protection given the prime minister, who has been threatened repeatedly by Sikh separatists. Police said the gunman was not a Sikh. 
The government said several police assigned to protect Gandhi were suspended after the 
attack,  which  occurred  as  
Gandhi,  42, and the president  
left  a  prayer  service  com­ 

memorating the I 17th anniver­sary of the birth of Mohandas Gandhi. who led India's struggle for independence from Britain. 

Police said the attacker hid in heavy vines that covered a gazebo on the grounds of the Rajghat, or State Memorial, where the Mahatma was cremated. He fired a homemade pistol several times, they said. 
Two of the injured said they were standing next to Gandhi when the gunman fired, and were hit by pellets intended for the prime minister. 
Indian news agencies said the shots were fired as Singh was getting into a car and Gandhi and his wife, Sonia, stood nearby. Reporters who later surveyed the scene said the gazebo was about 50 yards from where the prime minister stood. 
Gandhi's security guards fired in the air around the gazebo and flushed out the attacker. Police said he was in his early 20s and wore an olive army uniform. 
The Home Ministry said he "changed his name several times" during questioning. 
The suspect was questioned by police but his motive was not clear. Police and government of­ficials said he did not belong to any terrorist groups. 
After the shooting, Gandhi ap­peared on government television and said smiling, "Everything is okay. There is nothing to tell." 
He then closeted himself with Home Minister Buta Singh, who is responsible for internal secur­ity, and other officials. Indian news agencies said they dis­cussed the security lapse and tightening protection for Gandhi. 
Gandhi is guarded by an elite sharpshooter unit, the National Security Guard, formed after Sikh bodyguards assassinated his mother, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, in October 1984. 
Three civilians and three police officers were hit by pellets and suffered "minor and superficial" injuries, the Home Ministry said.

Students show apathy 

toward police actions 
As I walked to the science building last Wednesday night, even the steady drizzle couldn't dampen my spirits. I was on my way to the second meeting on students' rights at off-campus parties. The county prosecutor was scheduled to be present with answers to questions on legal rights. I had attended the first meeting the week before and, while it was informative, I was a little disappointed by the size of the crowd. But this meeting will be dif­ferent, I told myself. People are really get­ting involved and interested. As I went in the door and rushed down the hall to the lecture room, I feared that I wouldn't get a seat. I entered the room and my fear was discharged. I could find a seat. In fact, I could find a lot ofseats. There were only I 7 people in the audience. 
Christy Wolfe 
guest column 
We've all heard it-the Notre Dame-Saint Mary's community is apathetic. We care more about football than foreign policy. We grumble more about parietals than apartheid. And we always say the same thing -football and parietals are part of "our" world; foreign policy and apartheid aren't. Yet, over the past few weeks, we have been enraged by the treatment of NOOMC students at off-campus parties. From party raids to citations to the firing of two resident assistants, The Observer has kept us informed. We feel violated, harassed and we want action. 
Student Senator John Gardiner knew that and organized a legal forum with the co-directors of Legal Aid at the Notre Dame Law School and with the judicial coordinator of Notre Dame. The meeting was scheduled for Wednesday, Sept. I 7, and was mentioned on the front page of The Observer on Monday, Sept. 15. "All students who had gotten in trouble in one way or another" were encouraged to at­tend, as well as any student concerned with his or her rights "when confronted by law officers." 
Now, I assumed that this meeting would draw a large crowd. At least the people who had been issued citations or arrested would be there. When I reached the library auditorium, I was disappointed by the size of the crowd: less than ISO people. I was glad I went because I found out things' that I didn't know: for instance, a citation is similar to an arrest on your record and will stay on it permanently. The crowd was interested and the ques­tions were good questions but the answers just weren't that easy. 
On Wednesday, Sept. 24, again on the front page of the newspaper, was men­tion of the second meeting on students' rights off-campus. This time, the county prosecutor was coming to speak and an­swer questions. The next day's Observer told all inquiring minds what had transpired -the prosecutor's "real world view". How does it make you feel to know that those dogs that are trained to attack are at those parties as "a show of force"? Or that your fate relies totally on "the police officer's discretion"? The message was clear: it boils down to you versus a South Bend police officer. If he or she says you appeared to have been drinking or out of line, there is little you can say or do in your defense. But the article in the paper failed to mention what I con­sider the most critical thing apparent by this meeting. There were only I 7 people in the audience. 
The excuses are gone. We are all af­fected by treatment of ourselves or our fellow students, be it off-campus or on. Both meetings were mentioned on the front page of The Observer. Would they have been better seen on the sports page? Why are the incidents of citations and party raids making the front page of the paper? Obviously, very few people care -very few. Why are people like Stu­dent Senator John Gardiner and others in student government working to get answers for us? Relax, guys, you might as well do your homework, or work on "important" issues. Besides, we gave the county prosecutor a message to take back to the courthouse with him. By having I 7 people at that meeting. we let him know that we can and will continue to put up with the abuse of our rights when it comes to off-campus parties. If even I 0 percent of the Notre Dame-Saint Mary's student body had shown up, he might have "felt the heat". Instead, we left him cold. 
As you read this, you may be thinking ahead to your plans for the weekend. If you plan to be off-campus, bring your checkbook and make sure your insurance covers dog bites. Because we have run out of excuses.

Off-campus partying can be expensive night 
Editor's note: This is the first column of a regular series on the trials and tribula­tions of off-campus life. 
Who are those people sleeping in our Lafortune Student Center? Where do those guys come from who play that hacky-sack game in front of O'Shaughnessy all the time? And why do they always eat so much when they get into the dining halls? Look no further, students of Notre Dame, for I bring you the answer. These are members of the Notre Dame off-campus community. 
Tracy Thoman 
off-campus 
The most recent Registrar figures indi­cate that we, the undergraduate off­campus students, number just under 1400; the senior class alone has 40 per­cent of its population (or 750 students) living beyond the confines of the Golden Dome. Many reasons have been cited as to why the relatively sudden increase in off-campus migration has occurred. I can speak for most in saying it certainly isn't the lack of theft that lured us here. Yes, theft can be avoided. Although much has already been written in this paper on the topic, none has addressed the subject of Darners stealing from other Darners. "What?" you say, surprised. Yes -it hap­pens all the time and takes many forms. I'll explain in a brief scenario. 
An off-campus student decides to have 
a party. The night of the party, his friends come and everyone starts having a good time; his "donations" jar even has a few bills in it. As the party progresses, so does the number of bodies in the house/apartment. The party host is too busy talking to friends and watching out for the police to notice much else. After the party gets busted and the host receives a $50 fine for noise ordinance violation, only a few close friends and roommates remain. Someone wants to hear that Peter Gabriel tape that Pete just bought. "Where is it? I know I left it right here a couple hours ago," he asserts. Then, as more in the room become in­volved, other items of interest turn up missing. The beer tap, the donation money, more tapes, even money from 
the bedrooms. This list is by no means 
complete. 
We all agree that parties are a good time. But sometimes intoxicated Darners can become obnoxious. What needs to be stressed is that the renter of the abode has every right to ask certain things of his visitors. These include where to park, which rooms not to infiltrate in the house, to keep the noise to a dull roar, to let the host handle his own music and not to spill beer everywhere. Of course, off­campus etiquette varies from house to house. I just ask that you keep these in mind the next time you venture into the off-campus world.

Hottest way to strike up some mid-week 
fun 

ROBIN SQUYRES 
features writer 

Clubs, bars, parties-that's all out these days. With poliCe crackdowns, the tradi­tional forms of entertainment are getting 
risky for Notre Dame and  Saint Mary's  
students.  But  there  is  an  alternative  - 
bowling.  

Don't laugh. Bowling is becoming a for­midable presence in the social scene. 
Many dorms and university organiza­tions have regular bowling events, and some even have official bowling clubs. A "-club" includes all the good things: a presiding bowling comm1ss1oner, trophies, prizes and the ever important social advantages. 
"Chicks dig Morrissey guys who bowl," claims B(ad Edmonds, a sophomore par­tial to the sport.. 
Edmonds bowls regularly with the Mor­rissey club, which is one of the oldest on campus. 
"It's a tradition in Morrissey," says Ted Erbrecht, the 1orm's esteemed bowling commissioner. "It started with Brother Ed. He always went. He was a very big supporter." 
Brother Edward Luther, Morrissey's former rector, apparently enjoys a game or two. He was moved to Fisher Hall only this year, and there are rumors of a new bowling club already in progress. 
The Morrissey men head to the Beacon Bowl every Wednesday night. "Morrissey bowling is the place to be," according to Jared Desrosiers. "The weekend starts on Wednesday for us, and this kind of gets things rolling." No pun intended? 
"People are blowing off tests to go bowling," said Patrick Brisbane. He defines bowling as "more fun than the average human being should have at Notre Dame." 
It certainly sounds serious. 
In fact, bowling's increasing momen­tum has rolled it right off campus. Ralph Mastrangelo and his housemates make it to the bowling alley up to two times a week. "We go during the week, when there's nothing else to do. It's pretty in­expensive," says Mastrangelo. They usually head to Shu Ia's 31 Bowl, just into Michigan. 
These -guys are really hard-core; they compete for blood. "We gamble amongst ourselves; we bet things like dish nights

ND/SMC theater 
season begins 
Special to The Observer 
Three plays and one dance concert will comprise the 1986-87 season for Notre Dame--Saint Mary's Theatre ac­cording to Notre Dame and Saint Mary's Communication and Theatre Department Chairmen Mark Pilkinton and Clayton Henderson. 
Selections range from clas­sic tragedy to contemporary comedy. Two of the shows will be performed at O'Laughlin Auditorium on the campus of Saint Mary's College and two plays will be presented at Washington Hall at Notre Dame. 
The season begins with the Pulitzer Prize-winning "Crimes of the Heart" by Beth Henley. This off-beat comedy recounts a reunion of three 
sisters in Hazlehurst  Missis­ 
sippi.  The  occasion  of  the  
reunion  is  that  one  of  the  

sisters, Babe, has shot her husband. The other two have returned home to lend her support. 
Lenny, the oldest is brood­ing about turning thirty and her painful lack of romantic prospects while Meg, a failed nightclub singer, is trying to find the best lawyer in town to represent Babe. Hen ley's sense of humor has been characterized as Southern Gothic and will be performed at O'Laughlin Auditorium in October. Saint Mary's Theatre professor Julie Jen.sen will direct "Crimes of the Heart." 
Jensen has recently returned from Washington, 
D.C. where she won a playwrit­ing competition sponsored by the Arena Stage. Her play was selected above I, 200 others and was produced at the Arena Stage. Jensen also received a cash award of $5000. 
Mark Pilkinton will direct the second offering in Washing­ton Hall in December. "Good" by C. P. Taylor is an intelligent and light treatment ofa rather sensitive subject. Taylor, a Jew, wrote a play probing how a good person could become involved in the Nazi move­

ment in Germany. 
Taylor's challenge was to create a character with whom the average audience mem­ber could identify rather than portraying a Nazi as the stereotypic psychopath. His main character Halder, is hardly the stereotypic Nazi ter­rorist. 
A liberal professor, Halder is a devoted family man whose best friend is a Jewish psychiatrist. Through a suc­cession of events Taylor shows the transformation of Halder into a top official in the Nazi party, who is instumental in developing the "final solu­tion." "Good" played in Lon­don in 1982 and on Broadway in 1984. 
In March an eclectic evening ofmusic and dance is planned for O'Laughlin Auditorium called "To Dance!" lndi Dieck­graefe, Pro fessor of Dance at Saint Mary's College, will cho­reograph a number oforiginal works for her dancers and also perform a solo work. Dieckgraefe will also invite a professional dancer and 
choreographer to be guest artist. The guest artist will choreograph a piece for the student dancers and will also perform. 
The final play of the season will be Shakespeare's classic tragedy "Macbeth," directed by Reg Bain, professor of Theatre at Notre Dame. Mac­beth's lust for power has made his name synonymous with evil. One of Shake­speare's most popular plays, "Macbeth" is a study of the corroding effects produced when Macbeth chooses Evil as his master. 
There are two types of sub­
. scriptions this season from which to choose. Subscribers will see all four shows for $18 or $ 15 depending upon seat location. Student and Senior Citizen discounts are avail­able.

The nt-.""-"''"«: 

Senior manager Joe Puetz and his staff are Lou Holtz' right hand men when it comes to game and practice preparation 
Managers play big role in game preparations 
By TERRY LYNCH Sports Writer 
"We're the roadies of the football team," said junior Brian Moffitt as he tried to sum up the experience of being a student manager. For the amount oftime, dedication and attention to detail that the student managers put into the team, nothing could be closer to the truth. 
The student managers organization at Notre Dame has a long and tradition-filled history that dates back to the days when Knute Rockne coached the Fighting Irish. The managers are a completely student­run organization that extends their membership to all freshmen men, and managers who stay with the program until their senior 
j 

year are automatically entitled to at least a 65 percent scholarship. 
"When you get to your senior year, all of a sudden you find out 
where you stand, and that's where the fun really, really begins," said Head Football Manager Joe Puetz, who is one of three seniors who devote their managing efforts exclusively to football. Puetz has a' full scholarship, while co-seniors Bryan Fenton and Don EI-Etr have 75 percent scholarships. 
Until senior year, however, the "fun" of managing looks a lot like pure drudgery. The managers cover all practices, making sure the players are properly eqipped for each day, regulating the gates to the practice field, making sure practice runs smoothly and arranging training table schedules. And that has nothing to do with the dreaded "Game Prep."

juniors and seniors against the freshmen and sop­homores, is then filmed by the football staff as material for a meeting in the future that has as much to do with camaraderie as it does uncon­trolable laughter. 
"I love the managers' football game," said Puetz. "It's like fulfilling a childhood dream. 
"The players really get a kick out of it. Steve Beuerlein was one of the referees in last year's game, and a couple of players have asked me when the game this year is. They look at it as a kind of pee-wee league. 
"It's an intense game," con­tinued Puetz. "But you can really tell who's played before and who hasn't." 
The managers have a good working relationship with the players and coaches, while the latter has come to depend a great deal on the hard work of the managing group. There is no looking-down upon the managers by the players, as is usually the custom in high schools. 
"There's a mutual respect be­tween the players and the managers," said Keough. "We realize that we're there to prepare them for the game, and they realize that our job is necessary."

Crimson and White 
Starting guard Bill Condon remembered how his palms sweated as the seconds ticked away. But leading Alabama back from the brink of dis­aster was no sweat for quar­terback Mike Shula. 
No sweat to lead the Crimson Tide on a 71-yead scoring march in 35 seconds. No sweat to perform a miracle be­tween the hedges of Georgia's Stanford stadium, a magic moment that brought Ala­bama a shocking 20-16 vic­tory and ignited a surprising 9-2-I season. No sweat to take the tools ofan average college quarterback fine tune them to near perfection, add a dose of football smarts and come out a big winner. 
On that warm September night in 1985, Mike Shula ­not Don Shu Ia's son, but just plain Mike Shula -came of age. "It was a moment I'll never for­get" says Shula. "That gave me a lot of confidence, I think it gave the team confidence too, you hope to have the chance to challenge yourself like that. It's exciting to find out what you can do in that kind of situation." 
The excitement has continued for Shula, who has lead Ala­bama to a 4-0 start and a No. 2 national ranking in this week's national wire service polls. The Crimson Tide plays host to Notre Dame tomorrow at Birmingham's Legion Field. 
Before the season began, some were clamoring about a Heisman Trophy for Shula, which is unlikely. Others spoke routinely of all-America honors, which is a distinct possibility. But Shula just wants to talk about winning. 
"With the schedule we have, we have the chance to do some great things this year," Shula says. "I don't consider it a burden I consider it a chal­lenge to have the opportunity to play Ohio State, Penn State, Notre Dame and all the tough SEC schools. If you want to be the best. you have to play the best, and we have that challenge." 
Shula loves a challenge. He remember those first few months on the Alabama campus, when he was not re­garded as just another rookie quareterback, but as a man in a fishbowl, always being asked how it felt to be Don Shula's son, the kid who grew up on the Dolphins sideline. Did he learn his work habits from Griese? Did Marino give him any pointers? How active an interest did dad take in his football career? 
It probably got more than a little old for the youngest of Don Shula's children. 
"It's great to be Don Shula's son," he would say, "but I want to make a name for myself." 
That in itself would be some challenge. All the while, he was considered the number­three horse in a three-horse race. After fleetfooted Walter Lewis finished his eligibility in 1983, the chase would match two tough all-America quar­terbacks with impressive credentials and one all-state signal barker with a famous name. Flashy Georgian Vince Sutton, with a rifle for an arm, was considered the favorite. Shula was a decided longshot. 
On the front stretch, the dis­astrous 5-6 season of 1984, neither one looked impres­sive. Both had chances at the reins. Both won, both lost. 
"''d realized I wasn't perform­ing," Shula says in hindsight. "I had no gripes sharing time with Vince." 
But the complexion of the race changed dramatically in the spring of 1985. Shula the hard worker with limited tools, pulled ahead of Sutton, the flashy kid with all the right moves. The long-shot won the race. 
So on that night in question, Shula stepped on to the giant stage just before the curtain was to fall, and he put on a performance that made jaws droop in awe. He showed a talent few knew he had, dis­playing a coolhanded nature in the clutch, and a tou~;:h that was good enough to get the job done. For that, he was Ray Perkin's quarterback. For that, he was the undisputed leader on a team that cried out for a pied piper. 
"I remember when I first got here," says battery mate AI Bell. "People said all Shula could throw was a wobble ball. They must not have been talking about the same Mike Shula that's been throwing for me." 
Perhaps it wasn't the same Shula. Sure, it was the same kid with the average tools. But if it was a wobble ball he was tossing, he was learning to toss it with increasing ac­curacy. 
The guy with the weak arm lead the nation in passing effi­ciency for much of the 1985 season, finishing fifth. He threw for 16 touchdowns and set a new school record for single season completion percentage (60.3). He di­rected a late rally againstarch­rival Auburn, allowing Van Tif­fin to kick the wining points. 
While all the experts were talking about Shula's weak­nesses, he was charting his own limits and learning to live within his own God-given means. 
"I realize my limitations," he says. "I don't have the tools of a Vince Sutton, no way. But all that means is that I have to make up for it with a lot of hard work."

Prep-

Game Prep takes place the Thursday or Friday night before each game, and noth­ing is overlooked by the managing crew. Every shoe, jersey, pad and cleat is checked if it is to be used in the upcoming game. But per­haps the most painstaking and time-honored tradition of the student managers is painting the helmets the tradi­tional gold of Notre Dame. Game Prep can go until as late as 2 a.m., which wouldn't be bad if the managers didn't have to be back at the stadium at 7 a.m. 
"You have to have a lot of pa­tience and be a big fan of Notre Dame," said junior manager George Keough. "If you put up with the menial tasks, you'll do as a manager. It's not that what we do is uni­mportant, they're just not noticed." 
But tradition runs a little deeper than merely painting helmets and being indisposed to the wishes of Irish players and coaches both home and away. The managers as­semble once a year in Novem­ber on a Sunday morning to play their annual intra­manager football game.

The Game 
vs. 


By MARTY BURNS 
Assistant Sports Editor 
Birmingham, Ala. -North against South. Catholics versus Baptists. Clash of the Titans. 
No, it's not another ABC mini-series. al­though it will be televised nationally by that network. What it is is a classic matchup involving the two greatest tradi­tions in college football. Tomorrow after­noon on Birmingham's Legion Field, second-ranked Alabama (4-0) will do battle with a 1-2 Notre Dame team that is running out of chances to prove it merits post-season bowl consideration. 
The Irish, who are comingoffa 41-9 shell­ing of Purdue, must play a near-perfect game, however, ifthey are to upend head coach Ray Perkins' Crimson Tide squad. Seventeen starters return from last season's 'Barna team, which rolled up a 9-2-1 slate and put the Tide back at the forefront of college football after a brief hiatus from the Top I 0. This year, in fact. the talk around Tuscaloosa is of a na­tional championship. 
"I don't think there's any question we know we're playing a great football team this week in Alabama," said Irish head coach Lou Holtz. "Just like against Mic­higan (a 24-2.3 Irish loss), we can't expect to have a chance unless we go down there and play with great intensity and keep our mistakes to a minimum. 
"It's tough enough to play a team like Alabama anyway. But when they've had an open date to get healthy and get ready for usand when we're playing on the road, it's that much harder. Ray Perkins was here personally to see us play Purdue, so you know he'll be ready for us." 
There is little doubt that this game means a great deal to Perkins, who succeeded Alabama's legendary Paul 'Bear' Bryant as head coach four years ago. Although Bryant's .32.3 coaching victories made his act a tough one to follow for Perkins, the Bear lost all four of his games against Notre Dame -and two of the losses cost Alabama sure national championships. It has been said in Tuscaloosa, in fact, that on Bryant's death bed someone asked him if there was anything he didn't ac­complish in his .38 years of coaching. Reportedly, the Bear mumbled, "yeah, I never could beat Notre Dame." 
Alabama's offense vs. Notre Dame's defense 
Start with an intelligent and versatile quarterback, add in a pair of lean tail­backs and a bruising fullback. throw in an all-America split end, finish it with an offensive line led by a guy named 'Hoss', and you have the recipe for a typical Al­abama offense. 
And in the tradition of 'Barna §feats like Ken Stabler, Joe Namath and Bart Starr, the quarterback is the one who will cook up the Crimson Tide offensive show. Senior Mike Shula, son ofMiami Dolphins' head coach Don Shula, is at the controls of the Tide offense and will be the key to 'Barna's offensive performance. The 6-2, 198-pound southpaw asserted himself into the 1986 Heisman Trophy race by finishing fifth in NCAA passing efficiency 
(150.0) last season, throwing for 2009 yards and a 60-percent completion rate. While Shula (47-of-77, 502 yards so far this season) has been victimized by in­terceptions six times already this year, Holtz sees very few weaknesses in Ala­bama's best clutch-performer. 

Mike Shula 
"Mike Shula just makes the big play all the time," said Holtz. "He's smart. checks off at the line very well, doesn't make mistakes and he does the things neces­sary to win football games." 
Alabama, however, always has been a running team and this one is no different. Four or five different backs carry the brunt of the 'Barna running attack which has averaged 250.5 yards per game (13th in NCAA). Sophomore tandem Gene Jelks (32 carries for 24.3 yards) and Bobby Humphrey (59 for 298) lead the charge while fullback Kerry Goode has returned nicely from injury problems to pose an­other serious threat to Tide opponents. The Irish may dodge one bullet. though, as Jelks is still questionable for the game because of a mild ankle i'l.iury. 

When Shula goes to the air, he always looks first to third-team all-America receiverAlbert Bell. Bell made a first down or touchdown on .36 of his 4 I catches last year and always draws enough coverage to free up teammates like Greg Richardson (eight catches, two touch­downs this season). In addition, the of­fensive line, Jed by 6-2, 250-pound senior center Wes Neighbors and senior tackle Hoss Johnson, protect Shula even better than they block for Jelks and company. It is projected that at least four of the current linemen will be drafted by the NFL when their collegiate days are finished. 
The biggest concern for the Irish defen­sive coaches, therefore, will be to generate a heavy pass rush to keep Shula from burning the defense on third-down situations. The Notre Dame pass rush, while certainly better than last season's, has still been a disappointment as op­posing quarterbacks have gone down only four times. The return of tackle Robert Banks, who missed the Purdue game with an injury, should help in this regard. 
If Notre Dame is to upset Alabama, Holtz knows his team will do it with defense. So far, the Irish rushing defense has received high marks, and that will have to be the case again. The secondary, which has proved to be vulnerable, may get support in the form of veteran free safety Mike Haywood, who is trying to come back after sitting out the last two games with calfstrains. 'Eagle' end Cedric Figaro, meanwhile, suffered a knee sprain against Purdue and is listed as questionable. 
Notre Dame's offense vs. Alabama's defense 
The Notre Dame offense, with its multiple sets and a surprisingly-good front line, has managed to outgain every opponent this season en route to its 16th-place cur­rent standing on the NCAA total-offense chart at 424.7 yards a game. The fact the Irish lost two-of-the three games, however, can be attributed to silly turn­overs and inconsistencies in the running game. Both of these problem areas must be held in control if Notre Dame is going to move the ball against an awesome Crimson Tide defense that yields only I I points a game on average (seventh in NCAA in scoring defense). 
"Good things will happen if we execute and don't turn the ball over," said Holtz. "We ran the ball better last week (276 net rushing yards), and that's something we've got to continue to do if we're going to be successful. Alabama has been so tough to run against. so we've got our work cut out for us there." 
Tailback Mark Green (42 carries for 160 yards on the season) found a groove last week and will have to maintain it as Notre Dame's primary ground weapon. Four­teen other players, though, have carried the ball this year for Holtz' attack. among the more prominent being fullback Per­nell Taylor, tailback AnthonyJohnson and flanker Tim Brown. 
At quarterback, the Irish will go with both regular starter Steve Beuerlein and top­reserve Terry Andrysiak. Both signal­callers have been effective this season moving the baiL but both have also ex­perienced difficulty getting the ball in the end zone. The Irish receivers, meanwhile, have been a consistent threat with fine targets Brown, Milt Jackson, Alvin Miller and Joel Williams each having caught at least five passes this year. 
All of this could be meaningless, however, if 'Barna's all-everything linebacker Cornelius Bennett decides to have one of his better games. The 6-4, 2.35-pound Outland-Trophy candidate has been likened by Perkins to current NFL star Lawrence Taylor, who Perkins coached during his stint as head coach of the New York Giants. Bennett. along with three other returning starters, makes the Tide's linebacking corps one of the top two or three in the country and causes nightmares for opponents' running games. 
The front line of 'Barna's multiple defen­sive look is also led by one star player, 6-2, 266-pound noseguard Curt Jarvis. Jarvis, an all-SEC performer, will be flanked by two talented but inexperienced tackles in sophomore Anthony Smith and senior Derrick Slaughter. If this line can put the pressure on Beuerlein and Andrysiak. an experienced secondary, led by all-SEC cornerback Freddie Robinson, will be ready to make the big play. 
As ifAlabama didn't already have enough big-play performers, there is one more. Senior placekicker Van Tiffin holds al­most every Crimson Tide kicking mark. including the seven longest field goals in Tide history and is automatic with PAT's and short field-goals.

Walker dealt to Nuggets 
Associated Press 
NEW YORK -The New York Knicks traded guard Darrell Walker, their No. I pick in the 1983 NBA draft, to Denver yes­terday for the Nuggets' first­round pick next year. 
"The opportunity to obtain a first-round draft choice existed, which is an asset we can imme­diately utilize in a trade if a deal arises, or save for the 1987 col­lege draft," Knicks General Manager Scotty Stirling said of the deal. 
Walker, from the University of Arkansas, averaged I 0.6 points in his three seasons with the Knicks, during which he missed just one game. After making the NBA all-rookie team in 1984, he had his best season in 1984-85, averaging 13.5 points.

The Observer Friday, October .3, 1986, -page 8 
CFA 
continued from page 12 
The same thing with the faculty 
representatives and athletic 
directors. 
"At the same time, we try to think of things in terms of the things that will enable you to keep your program alive finan­cially. Things keep getting more expensive, and we're in a period now where there's not inflation so adding a lot of money to the cost of your ticket becomes a problem. People resent it be­cause the inflation figures are not that high." 
But the split between the schools playing Division 1-A foot­ball means that the CFA's goal of a unified arena for discussing the issues confronting college football has never been realized, and the organization is now known more for its television negotiations. Corrigan, however, indicates that something else for achieving that goal is on the horizon. 
"The fact that the university presidents of the Big Ten and Pac 10 would not allow their schools to be members of the CFA in many ways has dampened some of the enthusiasm for what the CFA is all about." Corrigan says. "Some people felt in the begin­ning that what they wanted to do was add more coaches, add more scholarships and add more money. That's not the case at all. The case is to make football bet­ter in every way. Again, the fact that those two conferences haven't joined really has been unfortunate because over and over I've had athletic directors from both those conferences say, 'Gee I wish we were in the CFA because we do need to meet and talk.' 
"This summer we had a meet­ing of all the athletic directors of the Division 1-A schools, which was what the CFA was intended to be the first time around. We're going to have another meeting (at the end of this month), and we're going to see how it goes from there. That may be some­thing good. 
"The thing I'm interested in the most is getting all the schools together that have the same problems," Corrigan continues. "I don't think one group should be over here and another group over there. That doesn't make any sense to me. The NFL and AFL were wasting a lot of talent, time and energy. Now they're to­gether and it's a powerful thing. I think we should be the same. I'm not blaming the CFA for where we are. This new thing of having (the athletic directors meet) could be very influential in the future." 
Still, the CFA has at least kept its smaller members in the television-revenue picture. Cor­rigan points out that Notre Dame could go it alone and do better financially than it does with the CFA, but that wouldn't be good for college football. 
"I'd like to see all of the big schools together on the same page moving in the same direc­tion for the good of college ath­letics, and I think that's the cri­tical thing." says Corrigan. "I don't want to get into the Big Ten, Pac I 0 and CFA. Hey, we're all in this thing together. The sooner we bring ourselves to­gether, the better off we're going to be."

Mattingly sets Yankee hit mark; Mets pound Expos behind Gooden 
Associated Press 
BOSTON -Don Mattingly set the New York Yankees' single­season hit record with a double and single last night in a 6-I vic· tory over the Boston Red Sox. · 
Mattingly singled in the seventh inning for his 232nd hit breaking the club record of 231 set by Hall of Farner Earle Combs in 1927. During a four-run fifth, Mattingly hit his 52nd double of the year, tying the team mark set by Hall of Farner Lou Gehrig in 
1927. 
Mattingly, bidding to overtake Boston's Wade Boggs for the American League batting cham­pionship, went 2-for-4 and his average stayed at .350. Boggs, hitting .357, sat out the game with a hamstring injury.

Saturday, Oct. 4, will begin the end for Notre Dame's winningest coach. 
For the 3oth and final time, Head Coach Tom Fallon will be at the helm of the Notre Dame men's tennis team. 
For Fallon, though this season "in many ways is just like the first, you always try to do the best job you can." 
Fallon will showcase the 1986 
Irish in the Notre Dame Invita­
tional which takes place this 
weekend. The man whose name 
has become synonymous with 
tennis and winning at Notre 
Dame will be looking to add to 
And rightly so. 
The Irish return six of seven 
starters from last year's Eastern 
Collegiate Championship team. 
In addition, last year's team 
placed second in a hard-fought 
bid for the Midwestern Cities 
Championship and complied 26 
wins against only nine losses. 
What is even more impressive is 
that the Irish accomplished this 
with four freshmen. 
Dave Reitter feels, as a soph­
omore, he has "more cofidence 
going into the season having a 
year of experience behind me." 
Reitter commeneted that as a 
freshman, "I often felt in­
timidated playing against more 
experienced college players." 
Reitter will be joined by sop­
homores Brian Kalibas, Tony 
Cahill and Tim Carr, occupying 
the top four slots for the Irish. 
Kalibas, who has played tough 
all fall, will play No. I for the 
Irish. Playing both first and 
second last year, Kalibas com­
piled a record of 28-I I . 
"He knows how to win," says 
Fallon of Kalibas. "He doesn't 
have what you would call classic 
strokes but he is a smart player 
who has good control and the 
attitude and willingness to stay 
out there and gut out points." 
"We all have different playing 
styles but we are all competitors 
and we all want to do well," 
Kalibas says. 
Sophomore Tony Cahill, who 
plays fourth singles, was key to 
the success of the Irish last year, 
and will move up to No. 2 this 
season. Fallon believes thejump 
"will be a good challenge for 
Tony" and thinks he "is up to it, 
he has been working hard and is 
the kind of kid who thrives on a 
challenge." 
Sophomores Carr and Reitter 

will represent the Irish at third and fourth singles, respectively. Carr, who has had a shoulder in­jury, returns after putting in a strong season last year playing both second and third singles. Carr, who Fallon feels is the best doubles player on the team, combines with Reitter in 
doubles. 
Reitter, the harderst worker on 
the team according to Fallon, 
moves up to the fourth-singles 
position from the fifth spot he 
played last year. 
Either junior Paul Daggs or 
freshman Mike Wallace will play 
I
fifth, and the other sixth, for the 
Irish. 
~ 
Daggs. who played sixth part j of the season last year, has "returned determined to play," 
l 
says Fallon. Wallace, from Ft. Lauderdale, 
l 
Fla., is the lone newcomer for ~ 
the Irish. Fallon admits to being 
"very impressived with Wallace." 
"He has good variety," Fallon 
says. "He has a good serve, good 
forehand, backhand, moves 
well, knows what to do with the 
ball and doesn't just try to knock 
the cover off the ball." 
Do not count out junior Dan 
Walsh, who played No. I for the 
for the Irish a year ago. Walsh 
currently fits in as the seventh 
man in the lineup. Right behind 
Walsh is the only senior on the 
team, Tom Greir, who will most 
likely see doubles action this 
weekend. 
Playing doubles for the Irish 
will most likely be Wallace and 
Cahill, Carr and Reitter, Walsh 
and Daggs, and Kalibas and 
Greir. But the challenges 
matches have yet to be com­
pleted so the lineup is only tena­
tive. 
Opening the season in the in­
vitational, the Irish will face 
Evansville at 9 a.m. and Western 
Mighigan at I p.m. on Saturday, 
and Oral Roberts on Sunday at 
I p.m. 
The Irish will most likely find 
Oral Roberts to be the biggest 
obstacle standing in the way of 
capturing their third-consecutive 
title. It was Oral Roberts which 
the Irish nipped, 5-4, on Carr and 
Reiter's doubles victory, in last 
year's final. However, it was the 
same Oral Roberts team that 
deprieved the Irish of the Mid­
Western Cities Championship in 
another 5-4 match. But Western 
Mighigan, a strong Mid-America 
team, and Evansville, a fairly 
strong school from the southern 
part of the state, will also be 
tough, according to Fallon. 
Fallon enters his final season 
with a team that he feels is "a 
good bunch of players, who are 
anxious to play and eager to 
work." 
"''ve been through this long 
enough to know that a lot of 
things you don't anticipate. like 
an injury or bad break, can hap­pen and throw off your whole schedule."

The veteran Garrett also is im­pressed with O'Connor's atti­tude. 
"He's a very talented runner," says Garrett. "And he pushes both himself and us during prac­tice. No one can stay with him." 
Even though O'Connor seems to be out in front the rest of the Irish squad is steadily improving. Both Mulvey and Garrett. as well as Markezich, have run well of late, and Piane will need their best performances today against opponents from University of Southern Florida, East Michigan, last year's winner Edinboro, and last week's winner in the Catholic Invitational.

"This is going to be a harder meet than last week's," said Piane. "It will definitely be inter­esting." 
With such a strong team run­ning for him, however, Piane agrees with O'Connor's preview of the season. 
"Mike is I 00-percent cor­rect, "said Piane. "We can't look to the future." 
Instead Piane will look to today's meet and get a look at his team's potential and deter­mination in its last home meet of the year. 
Today's race will start at 2 p.m. on the 16th fairway of the Burke Memorial Golf Course and will end on the 2nd fairway.
