Board discusses HPC proposal 
By MARY MciNERNEY 
News Staff 
The Saint Mary's Board of Governance met last night to dis­cuss a proposal for a new Hall President's Council. 
Julia Trimarchi, Augusta Hall President proposed to the Board the formulation ofa new Council, which will auempt to unify stu­dent government. 
Trimarchi stared, "It is my in­tention that the new Hall President's Council will convene hi-monthly with certain selected section reps and operate specifi­cally as a policy-making group. Student Government should ideally provide a force on campus which stimulates and in­fluences the whole student body to come to a more dynamic awareness ofitselfand ofits place in the rest ofsociety. Our present student government structure ul­timately seems to undermine our efforts." 
Kim Kentra, LeMans Hall Presi­dent agreed that, "the Council would be important in making more progress for the Board of Governance and in uniting the opinion of the Student Body." 

Off-Campus Commissioner Kathleen Engler stated, "I don't see what is wrong with the structure of Board of Gover­nance. We are here as a meeting ground for different groups, not exclusively as a planning board." 
As a policy-making body, the 
Hall President's Council would

CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. ( AP) ­The space shuttle Columbia's launch pad was closed to all but essential workers yesterday while the power units that caused last week's scrub were refueled for anolher attempt at Launch II on Thursday. 
The hazardous nature of the 

hydrazinc fuel dictated closing the 
pad. It will remain shut down until 
the fueling and other servicing ofthe 
units is completed this afternoon. 
The space agency rescheduled the launch Saturday· after certifying that the two contaminated units arc now clean and ready to fly. If re­placement had been necessal)·, the flight would have been put off until next week. 
The renewed countdown is to start at 8 a.m. EST tomorrow aiming for liftoff at 7:30a.m. Thursday. 
Officials also kept an eye on the weather. The long-range prediction for launch time Thursday was very good, except for the possibility ofin­termittent light rain in the area. Air Force weathermoo. forecast scat­tered douds, visibility 7 miles, winds at 11 miles per hour and tem­perature in the low 60s. 

The two astronauts who will fly the mission, Joe Engle and Richard Truly, spent Sunday with their families at their homes in Houston. Truly reportedly was elated that the new launch date coincides with his 44th birthday. 
They will 'fly here tomorrow, ready once again to board Columbia for the planned five-day mission, the shuttle's second. They came within 31 seconds of blastoff Wednesday only to be stopped by clogged filters in the auxiliary power units.

fn a book publishedthis month by the Notre Dame Press, Fredrick Crosson, the John Cardinal O'Hara Professor of Philosophy at Notre Dame, has collected six originals essays which concern the meaning and truth ofreligious language. The Autonomy of Religious Belief A Critical lnguiry addresses the question of whether religion can be understood as what Ludwig Wittgei1stein called a form of life. To imagine a language, he said, is to imagine a 
'orm oflife. Language, for Wittgenstein, is 'inseparable from the way oflife ofa specific community. But each community contains a mul­tiplicity of language-games, different modes of discourse for dif­ferent modes ofexperience, each mode having its own rules ofwhat can meaningfully be said. The essays, by Professors JM. Cameron, Louis Mackey, D.Z. Phillips, Kai Nielsen, William P. Alston, and Ken­neth Sayre, a philosopher from Notre Dame, assess the impact ofthis situation on religious belief. The Autonomy of Religious Belief is the second volume of the Notre Dame Studies in the Philosophy of Religion. -The Observer

A sales tax on illegal drugs? that's what two 
state employees are proposing, and the idea has caught the attention ofCalifornia Controller Ken Cory, who would like to see it put into effect immediately; The Los Angeles Times reported yesterday The Board of Equalization, which administers sales taxes, would follow up on police reports of drug arrests, estimate the dealer's annual volume of sales, and send him a bill for the tax. Proponents say the idea, submitted by Board of Equalization workers John Adamo and John Albu to the California Merit Award Board, which pays civil ser­vants for profitable ideas, could net the state 521 million a year. They said a dealer with an estimated annual volume of $250,000 would owe S 1 5,000. State Franchise Tax Board administrator Jerry Mountjoy said state income tax collectors have been doing some­
\thing similar for the past decade. Mountjoy said between 60 and 70 percent of the bills they send to drug dealers are paid, although he conceded much of the money comes from funds seized by police during an arrest. Mountjoy said the income tax board makes be­tween S2.5 million and $3 million annually from 300 to 400 such actions -stemming from only a few of the total number of drug dealer arrests. _:_ AP

Death Be Not Proud 
Death be not proud, tbough some have called thee Migh~y and dreadful, for thou art not so... -john Donne 
I've been wanting to write about my father for"some time. Nut to proclaim to the world what a wonderful man he was (a fact I don't have to prove to anyone), but rather to agree with poetJohn Donne; to say that death, as powerful as it is, cannot destroy a survivor's spirit to return from the fear, anger, and depression death 
causes. 

It's been a little over seven months since Dad died. I knew the arterial sclerosis was killing him, but I didn't know the call announcing his passing would come in the middle of my 21st birthday celebration. It's been a while since then and for as much pain as I've been through, the most important thing I've learned (we al­ways have to learn something from every experience, don't we?) is that I'm living with the grief, continuing my life, remaining in school and planningfor the future. 
Getting here from there hasn't been easy. There were lots of times I'd wonder if I'd think about anything else besides the wake, funeral and burial when I awoke every morning. I wanted to stop crying so badly, stop thinking, stop wishing for past times to come back; the secret to the end of my misery. 1 was so often told, was time. Seven months have helped, but the pain still comes in waves sometimes and probably always will. 
Watching two commencements was difficult, espe­cially when administrators suggested that students stand up and express thanks for the two people respon­sible for graduation day -their parents. I just sat there, watching groups of two arise all over the scenes, knowing that there would only be one at my com­mencement. Others, I realize, are in (and will-continue to be) in the same situation, but it's still a difficult thought. 
'... what has changed, I think, is our society, which has become jncreasingly a 
death-denying society . .. ' 
"Why is dying different now?" questions psychologist Elisabeth Kubler-Ross in her book, On Death and Dying, as she reflects upon society's changing view of death. "People have the same kind of unconscious thoughts and fantasies that they had years ago," she con­tinues. "What has changed, I think, is our society, which has become increasingly a death-denying society." 
Kubler-Ross states that both dying patients and their families expet:ience denial, anger, bargaining, depres: sicin and acceptance during and after the death. Denial, which can "last from a few seconds to a few months,'' is also accompanied by shock and a wondering why it ever happened. When one cannot maintain denial any· longer, anger enters. Both the dying patient and close famijy members "will become difficult, nasty, demanding (and) criticizing," before attempting to bargain themselves out of the situation. Those affected by the death "promise some­thing in exchange for the extension oflife." Kubler-Ross explains, that when they "drop the 'but,"' and realize that the situation cannot be changed, facing the depres­

sion stage. Gradually, both the patient and family (often 
at different times) evolve into acceptance ofthe death. 
"Rage, terror profound sadness, helplessness, acute loneliness, and despondency," Norman L. Paul, M.D., explains in "The Uses of Empathy in the Resolution of Grief," "are among those feelings that both children and adults find most difficult to bear; all are associated with the state of grief" Grief, which Paul feels American society has "such strong aversion to," "usually consists of such feelings as helplessness, anger, despair, and be­wilderment, which overlays and vary in intensity from person to person as well as within any one person during the mourning process." 
As helpful and patient as one's friends and other fami­ly members may be, listening at any moment and offer­ing advice, a personal, inner acceptance must occur. 
"Bold on to the things that make you happy," a good friend told me shortly after the death ofmy father when I was in a severe depression, complicated by a week of missed schoolwork and a new editorial board position on The Observer, "and let them fill your life now. When the bad days come, feel lousy, but when the good days come, enjoy them and remember why they made you happy." 
The sorrow of losing a loved one doesn't ever disap­pear, though it does diminish enough to allow life to continue. Death, Donne continues, is "slave to fate, chance, kings, and desperate men," unable to over­power mankind. "One short sleep past," Donne ends his powerful sonnet, "we wake eternally,/And death shall be no more; death, thou shalt die."

In the meantime, key White House aides are meeting with Rl·puhlicans in Congress to discuss spcnding and tax proposals. 
"Wc'rc in very significant accord on almost everything except revenues," Sen. Pete V. Domenici, R· N.M., said Friday after Reagan met with Senate and House GOP leaders at thc White House. "And on that ( therc has bcen) very significant movl·mcnt toward what we've been talking about." 
Sources in Congress indicated af· tcr the meeting that Reagan would l'mhrat·e tax inneascs of up to $4'; hillion over thrn· years -double: the S.2.2 billion he called for on Sept. 2~ but far hclow Domenici's call for SH·i hillion. Very little:, if any of the tax increasl· would come in I ':)82.

But at the White House, spokes· man Larry Speakes said Reagan still "does nut look with favor on tax in· creases in 1983 and 1984." 
He quoted Reagan as saying, "I do not wish to see any change" in the tax cuts voted earlier this year, "Nor do I wish to see any tax increases." 
Speakes, however, said Reagan would entertain proposals later for higher taxes ifthey prove necessary. 
Congress also is awaiting final word from Reagan on proposed cuts in benefit programs such as Medicare and food stamps, the defense budget, non-defense programs and certain credit programs like loan guarantees. 
White House chiefofstaffjames A. Baker III said Sunday that the package of benefit and entitlement cuts Reagan called for on Sept. 24 will be sent to Congress in the next scveral weeks. 
"They arc basically cuts at the margin in these programs, rounding off to the nearest dollar on benefits and entitlement checks," Baker said on NBC's "Meet the Press." 
Domenici told ABC news the White House had agreed to cuts of " S4 hi! lion in appropriations and an· other 2 to 3 billion in defense." White House Spokesman Peter Roussel said, "The tlgurcs arc still under review." 
Rt.·agan said in Septt·mher he wanted a s2 billion cut in defense and $1 I billion in other areas. 
While economic matters arc tern· porarily on hold, Congress is going ahead with another important Reagan program, buildup of the na· tion's military. 
The defense subcommittee of the Senate Appropriations Committee is scheduled to begin work this week on Reagan's call for 5200.9 billion in spending authority for the current tlscal year.

Trimarchi stated, "The Hall President's Council will strive to address issues other than social activities, such as cultural aware­ness and social justice policy." 
Mary Anne O'Donnell, Direc­
tor of Student Activities added, 
"The HPC is a good Idea because 
there is a lot of flexibility in the 
administration's policy. A sup­
port system concerning policy 
issues such as alchohol aware­
ness and social justice has to 
come from the student govetn­
ment." 

Student Body President, Eileen days. 
Q: What benefits does a Peace Corps experience give to students especially? 
A: The benefits gained are not al­ways tangible. In general, most people don't ever get the chance to live overseas, and a Peace Corps program offers that chance. A stu· dent can get another view of the United States, away from the states, and thus enhance whatever learning he/she has already gained. The Peace Corps teaches volunteers to be. innovative and patient, and sometimes the rewards arc so fulfill­ing that returning to the U.S. can be a difficult task. In fact, there is a pos­sibility that the Peace Corps might someday include a training program for those returning from overseas, as well, to help them readjust to the vast differences in lifestyles found here. 
Q: What type ofperson, do you feel, might benefit most from such an experience? 
A: For anyone with a sense of ad­venture, who would like to ex­perience another culture and actually have a positive impact on the lives of other people, Peace Corps may be the answer. I en­courage all Notre Dame and St. Mary's students to consider this op­portunity.

'Odd Couple' draws acclaim 
I
'm sure everybody is familiar with the story ofThe Odd Couple. A dejected Felix Unger, having been thrown out by his wife, appears at 
By Bill Kracklauer 
the apartment ofhis friend, Oscar Madison. With nowhere else to go, Felix moves in with his poker-pal. 
Unlike the popular TV series, 
though, Felix and Oscar cannot put 
up with each other's different 
lifestyles, and Felix moves out to 
find a place ofhis own. 
Although the story is familiar, the Student Players performed The Odd Couple very well. DirectorJeny Jacob) and Vinnie (Bill Hennessey) were very funny indeed. Poker buddies of Felix and Oscar, each of these characters reminded me of somebody I know. One ofthe big­gest assets of this play is its ability to make the audience relate to the characters. People laugh all the harder when they see an amusing situation acted out by characters they can identify with. 

The lead roles ofOscar Madison and Felix Unger were played very well by Tom Kannin and Mike Doyen, respectively. I enjoyed watching them argue over such things as ncamcss and punctuality and, although the dialogue itselfwas superb, the actors imparted their

Everyone knows that Oscar is a slob and the Felix is a prim and proper busybody, but Kannin and Doyen play these characters in their own way -true to the story lirie, but dif­ferent from the portrayal byJack Klugman and Tony Randall. 
The Odd Couple is not without its 

flaws, though. The Pigeon sisters, neighbors ofOscar and Felix, were a bit overdone. British divorcees Gwendolyn (Kimberly Blaesan) and Cecily (Mariana Karam) Pigeon were too silly for this play and would have done better in a slapstick com­edy. Still, I could not help laughing at 
them, as the actresses played their 
roles well. The problem lies within 
the script, not the players. 
Also, the second floor of LaFortune is not the greatest place to watch a play. The lighting is poor; the players suffer from the lack ofa back stage; and the acoustics are not as good as they should be. However, the Student Players overcame all these difficulties and did a fine job. 
I liked The Odd Couple quite a bit and recommend it highly. It is an amateur production put on in a casual setting, but I guarantee that no one will leave without having chuckled at least a few times. I think the best test ofa play's successis the audience's reaction to it. Last weekend, audiences roared at The Odd Couple. Give it a try; I promise that you will laugh. and laugh, and laugh some more. 
The Odd Couple will be playing again this weekend, Nov. 13 and 14. Believe me, you could not get much more entertainment for the admis­sion price of S2.

Keeping a diary leads to difficulties 
T
he diary ofH.L. Mencken is being opened to scholarsfor the first time 25 years after his death, according to newspaper stories. 
Mencken is one ofmy heroes, and inasmuch as we all try to fashion 
ourselves after the people we admire, the idea ofkeeping a diary 
myselfflashed through my mind. Somehow, I just don't feel my diary 
would be worth opening 25 years after I'm gone. Fqr instance, here 
would have been the entry in my diary for yesterday. 
Dear Diary: Got up 5:35. Meant to get up at quarter ofsix. Radio 
alarm set 10 minutes too early. Damn!

Much mail. President of small college in Pennsylvania said ifI'd speak at graduation, college would give me honorary degree. Wrote backand told him thanks but I'd rather have the money than the honor. 
Glue getting thick, so added solvent. They call it rubber cement for paper sticking. I call it glue. Must remember to change typewriter ribbon tomorrow. Getting too light to read. 

Heat turned on first time at office today. Got too hot. Called en­gineers downstairs to say I was hot but they told me Louise, down the hall, had just called to say she was cold. Damn! 
Notice carpet in office beginning to wear. Be good to get new car­pet but they'll never do that. Probably be easier to start walking on unworn parts. 
Ate lunch in company cafeteria. Food terrible but at least it's inex­pensive. Eating in cafeteria wouldn't be so bad ifyou could sit there and eat alone, but someone always feels sorry for you and joins you. 
Went to bank and cashed check for !50 for walking around money. Used to get $1 5. 
Must clean automatic coffee maker in office. Mineral deposits clogging pipes. Someone said to put quart ofvinegar through it. Hard to believe coffee will ever taste same. 
Can't find nail clipper. Damn! 
Jud called to say Ralph had been to California and saw Helen and Fred while he was there. He didn't bring up Grace, so I didn't say any­thing about her either. Check didn't come today. 
Damn! 
I don't think keeping a diary would be worthwhile for me. Half a dozen times in my life I've started one and now, when I look back at the few pages I filled in, it reads like drivel. It brings back memories that aren't worth remembering and recalls days of my life that are forgettable. 
The, implication when you keep a diary is that you are keeping it for your eyes only. A diary is considered a ~ecret place in which you can write down your innermost thoughts but keep them shielded from the rest ofthe world. The fact is, ofcourse, a diary keeper can pretend he doesn't want anyone else to read it, but if the diary keeper knew for certain no one else would ever read it, he or she would never keep it.

61-14 shellacking 

Northwestern sets record 

• • • leers 

Falls, Minnesota, the 5-4 loss would have been a lot worse. He posted 41 saves on the night, most of them coming at the end of one of many two-on-one Bronco breaks. 
In the first period alone, which saw Notre Dame take a 3-1 lead on the goals of Parsons, Logan and Per­ry, the Broncos outshot the Irish 18­
8. In addition, ofLaurion's final game total of 41 saves, more than half came on shots from within 20 feet of the net. 
So frustrating was it for Western Michigan that Bronco coach Glen Weller wondered aloud if his team might not be jinxed. 
"We seem to have a knack for bringing out the best in goalies, " said Weller. " I'm just glad we were able to overcome it tonight." 
Overcome it they did. With their backs to the wall, Western came out and took the play to the Irish. Start­ing at the 4: 19 mark, the Broncos tallied four unanswered goals to take a 5· 3 lead, and for the fifth straight game, the Irish found themselves trailing after two periods. 
Yet, as they did against both Ohio St. and Northern Michigan, Notre Dame came back from the deficit. Bellomy moved the Irish within two at the 16:18 mark when he knocked in a rebound past Healy. Three minutes later, with Laurion pulled in favor of the extra skater, Rothstein almost knotted the 'score with a ddlection. but Healy made the kick save. Logan and Perry also had good opportunities, but to no avail. As was the case last weekend at the ACC, it was simply a matter of too little, too late.

EVANSTON, Ill. (AP) Northwestern's Wildcats, respond­ing to chants of "We're the worst; we're the worst," absorbed their 29th straight football loss Saturday, setting an NCAA record for major college teams. 
They did it in the style of a loser, getting blasted by Michigan State 61­14 in a game in which the Spartans led 41-0 at halftime. 
When it was over, the fans did what any other fans would do for a team setting a record -they tore down the south goal post, carried it to the east bleachers and tossed it over the top. 
"I don't feel very good," said first­year Coach Dennis Green. "We were 

outmatched the entire game." 
Green, insisting that the Wildcats should remain in the Big Ten Con­ference, said, "There are three parts to a football game." 
"Emotional -I thoughtwe were ready despite all the distractions and the national coverage; mental ~ it's hard to be perfect and there were a few letdowns; physical -they were just stronger than us." 
The 29 straight losses since a 27­22 victory over Wyoming in the second game of the 1979 season 
erased the record of28 set by Kansas 
State in 1948 and equalled by Vir­
ginia in 1960. 
Northwestern also has lost 33 straight in the Big Ten. The Wildcats

finish the season against Ohio State and Illinois, and there appears little hope they will break the streak this year. 
·'Every now and then something mystical happens," said Green, ob­viously wishing for an upset. "But it didn't happen Saturday." 
With representatives from the three major television networks covering the game in addition to a number of newspapers and Time Magazine and Sports Illustrated, Northwestern was well prepared with hoopla. 
The cry was "Stop State at 28," and the message was printed on 25,000 buttons and 20,000 helium-filled balloons which were to be released as soon as Northwestern scored. 
Northwestern scored inthe third quarter on a 14-yard pass from Mike Kerrigan to Dave Bahoric. But that was long aftr Bryan Clark had thrown three touchdown passes and Morten Andersen had kicked field goals of 46 and 43 yards for Michi­gan State. 
One sign on the sidelines read, "Hey Mom, keep the money, send a team." 
"I knew how tough the job was when I took it," said Green. ''I'm ready to stick in there and fight it out. I know Northwestern is going to be a lot better next year."

with 'the big saves just when we need thum, so we couldn't be more pleased with his performance." 
Smith found out three very impor­tant facts about his squad in Friday night's game, the first of which is that Laurion is beginning to realize his potential as an outstanding col­legiate goaltender. Secondly, he figured out that ifyou trail by two in the third period of most games, you're going to lose more often than you'll win. Finally, he learned that despite a poor overall performance, his team is never really out of a game. 
"Defensively, we were very poor again Friday," lamented a frustrated Smith. "David was outstanding in goal for us, but our forwards did a lousy job of backchecking. In fact, the last three goals were the result of bad backchecking. We were stand­ing. alongside a guy and we wouldn't get in his way. We just let them walk on by." 
Which brings us back t~esson number one. Indeed, had it not been for Laurion, a native of International

Bermuda Triangle found in Dallas 
IRVNG, Texas (AP)-The Dallas Cowboys' public relations depart­ment likes to call Texas Stadium "The Bermuda Triangle of the Na­tional Football League."

Dallas is 69-1 "i in the stadium since its opcning in 1971, including some wild last-minute victories. Al­ready this year, tht· Cowboys scored two touchdowns in a 31-second span late in the fourth period to beat Miami 2H-27. 
Dallas has w<Jn 14 consecutive regular season games in the stadium.

Buffalo comes to Texas Stadium tonight having lost in its only foray into "The Triangle." 0.). Simpson was aboard and the Bills went down 17-10 in 1976 on a Monday night special. 
The Bills will be missing a mem­ber of their "Bermuda Triangle" defense, which has had 13 quarter' back sacks in the last two games and 
31 traps for the year. 
Linebacker Shane Nelson is out 
because ofa knee injury.

The only other time the two teams have played was in War Memorial Stadium in 1972 when· Dallas outlastnl the Bills 49-37. 
"We're pumped up about playing the Cowboys," said Buffalo quarter­back joe Ferguson. It's like going to play the Yankees in Yankee Stadium or basketball in Madison Square Gar­den, especially because it's on Mon­day night and it's rare that we play Dallas." 
Ferguson has thrown 19 touch­down passes this year as the Bills continue to make excellent usc of the Shotgun offense. 
Buffalo is the most efficient third­down team in the NFL. 
The Bills borrowed films from the Cowboys two years ago before Coach Chuck Knox installed the Shotgun. 
"The Bills probably use it more now than we do," said Dallas assis­tant Erma! Allen. "Any time they have more than seven yards to go they jump into it. They'.ve been very effective with it. Ferguson has only been sacked six times." 
The Cowboys also have been deadly in the Shotgun, coming from behind in the fourth quarter the last two weeks to win out of the forma­tion.

Montana leads 49ers to victory 
joe Montana threw a pair of touchdown passes, and an intercep­tion by Dwight Hicks thwarted a late Atlanta drive, enabling the San Fran­cisco 49ers to win their seventh straight game, 17-14, over the Fal­cons yesterday.

Home season ends for Irish seniors 
By KELLY SULLIVAN 
Sports Writer 
Saturday's game marked the end of the current series between Geor­gia Tech and Notre Dame, and Tech tailback Rob Lavette left something for the Irish to remember his team by. His 14 receptions set a Notre 
Dame opponents record, but the 
freshman wasn't real thrilled by that 
statistic. 
"They mostly were short passes 

and I didn~t get a lot ofyardage out of 
them," he noted. "Crable was there 
every time I turned around. He'~e 
of the best. I just wish I could have 
broken one." 
It would have been nice if Crable could have broken the Irish all-time tackling record during his final home appearance. He left the game just four shy of Bob Golic's mark. 
"I didn't know how close I was," said Crable. "I know I missed a few .tackles here and there -if I would've made them, I might have done it. I'm disappoin.ted I didn't ge.t 
i.t in from of the home crowd, the people who've bt:en watching me for the past four years. But just having the opportunity to be so close -that's enough. 

"I think our biggest goal is to get to a bowl game," Crable continued. "The only way we are going to do that is to win the rest ofour games." 
But the underclassmen had just 

one goal Saturday -to win, and win big for their older teammates. "We wanted to win it big for the seniors," said wingback John Mosley, who aided the cause with two touch­downs. "They're not going to get a national championship, but we wanted to get ahead so that all the seniors would play." 
And e\leryone of them -walk­ons and all -got that chance. "They (the walk-ons) work hard every day during the week," Crable pointed out, "and they get no recognition on Saturdays. It's great we were able to get everyone on the whole team in­volved. It's really special." 
Quarterback Tim Koegel's last pass in Notre Dame Stadium was pretty special. The fifth-year senior closed out his home career with a touchdown strike to Tim Tripp, an­other senior, who capped his stint in the Stadium with his first Notre Dame score. 
"There were a lot of tears in my eyes before the game," Koegel ad­mitted. "But I couldn't have asked for a better way to go out. The one you remember most is your last home game, so it felt great to con­tribute." 
"You want tot go out with a good performance, both as a team and in­diviudally," offered senior corner­backJohn Krimm, who did just that with another solid effort highlighted 
by an interception before the half. "But that's something you think about before and after the game. Once your're in there, it doesn't really enter your mind." 
But once the clock ran out, there was no ignoring reality. "I didn't want to leave the field," said tackle Phil Pozderac. "It's hard to accept the fact that I'll never walk off it again as a member of a Notre Dame football team. It's been ~ great four 
years, though, and I'll always ·.1 remember them." 1 ~

After Scurfield's powerplay goal with only 1:291eft in the period, the Broncos looked as if they were about to continue their recent domination ofthe Irish. 
However, in the second period, a change in the play of the Irish for­wards was clearly evident, and Smith explained why. 
"We started to play a good physi­cal game both offensively and defensively, while we still continued to skate well," he said. "The key to good forechecking and backcheck­ing is contact, and we weren't afraid to use the body." 
Defenseman John Schmidt broke fine fashion. 
Bill Rothstein got into the act at the 12:34 mark by taking a Poulin pass and finalizing the Irish effort with a breakaway goal. 
The play ofthe first line is turning heads already this season, and Poulin can't be happier with their progress. 
"The big effort Saturday was really needed, and we· obviously are pleased with the way things worked out," he says. "Playing with Bill and Jeff makes the game a lot easier, especially now that we are starting to click."
