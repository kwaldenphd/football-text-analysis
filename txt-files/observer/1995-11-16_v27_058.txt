Facing_ 
the rink of 
stress 

I have discovered the Maureen Hurley perfect spectator sport. Saint Mary's News Ediwr 
Forget baseball. Forget soccer. Forget volleyball. Heck, even *gasp!* just for a few minutes, forget Notre Dame football. Grab a sweater, go to the JACC, and experience a college hockey game. 
I remember when I was in kindergarten, my dad took me and my little brothers to a MIT hockey game. Granted, these engineers­to-be weren't the most impressive team, but for some reason, that game sticks out in my mind. A fight broke out and blood was shed on the ice. At age five, I just couldn't under­stand how a sport could possibly be so vio­lent. 
The entire perspective changes when you're a college student. My philosophy pro­fessor would call it suppressed Freudian blood-lust. I think it's the best stress reliever in the world. 
Forget sleeping, drinking, or whatever it is you normally do on the weekend to relieve tension. Go to a hockey game and be com­pletely, totally obnoxious. It's allowed by the rink. And almost encouraged. 
Don't get me wrong, I'm a very peaceful person, usually described as rather quiet. But I have to admit, I did join in the crowd's chants that started as "Hit him! Hit him!" then eventually escalated into "Kill! Kill! Kill!" 
Anything in the name of school spirit. 

Picture it. The Ohio State game. The big rivalry. The big game. The goalie with the last name, "Askey," which conveniently allowed the use of numerous variations of obscenities that just aren't fit to print. 
The pitiful heavy metal organ player ... the Zamboni driver ... the referees that foolishly have their names on the back of their jer­seys ... it'all combined for a hilarious night. 
And, oh, there's the game too. 

I couldn't count the number of minor fights that broke out. A brawl ensued, and it took the referees at least 10 minutes to figure out how to distribute all the penalties. By the end of the whole ordeal, the penalty box was so packed that they could hardly close the door. 
During this time, did the fans sit patiently? No. Did they feel a sudden urge to break out in the wave to alleviate their boredom? No. Did they go to grab a snack? No. Did they look to a mascot for entertainment? Not a chance. 
Throughout the long lull in the action, as all the players argued over who punched who, and who instigated what, one lone Ohio State player stood near his goal, dangerously close to the student section. 
It was Askey. I think the student section made the poor guy cry. Imagine if NBC Sports was televising the games... just think of the station breaks ... 
And the evident enthusiasm wasn't present simply because of the deep-seated rivalry against the Buckeyes. Friday night's game against Illinois-Chicago was just as eventful. 
So go. Go and release all the stress of your 

classes on the opposing team. 
You'll thank me for it.

Three restaurant employees killed during robbery 

NAPLES, Fla. 
The bodies of three people, vic­tims of an apparent robbery, were found in a walk-in freezer just before dawn Wednesday at a Cracker Barrel restaurant where they worked. 
The establishment had been ran­sacked, but it was not immediately clear whether anything had been taken and there was no sign of forced entry, according to Collier County Sheriff's Spokesman Damian Housman. He added that they were not sure as to whether the victims had taken the robbers by surprise. 

The three day-shift employees, two women and a man, were believed to have reported for work sometime between 4:30 a.m. and 5 a.m.; their bodies were found by another worker around 5:15 a.m. Housman said they had not ascertained exactly how the employees were killed. "There is blood. But we just don't know what the cause of death is." The employee who called the police, Donna Howell, said officers told her 
Barry diagnosed with cancer 
WASHINGTON 
Mayor Marion Barry has prostate cancer and is deciding whether to fight it with radiation or surgery. Either way, the mayor said he was confident of a speedy recovery. Barry, 59, said Wednesday the cancer was diagnosed during his annual physical exam Oct. 13 at George Washington University Hospital. He said he would decide on a 

treatment after more tests next week. "It will not impair his ability to perform his job and functions as the mayor," said Dr. Albert Goldson of Howard University Hospital. "I feel great. In fact, I look good, too," Barry said, drawing a laugh.''I'm confident that whatever treat­ment we choose, be it radiology or surgery, that I will have a total and speedy recovery." After the announce­ment, Howard University's Cancer Center announced it would offer free prostate cancer screening next month to Washington residents. According to the American Cancer Society, 244,000 men are diagnosed with prostate cancer each year. It is the second-biggest cancer killer in men, claiming more than 40,000 lives yearly. 
Hooters won't be hiring guys 
ATLANTA 
Imagine sliding into a booth at Hooters, skimming the menu, then giving your order to a scantily clad man. No way, said the restaurant chain that built its reputation on its perky Hooters Girls. The company will ignore an Equal Employment Opportunity Commission recommen­dation that it hire men to work alongside the women. Mostly male customers are taking Hooters' side. At the Hooters at Underground Atlanta, waitresses wore orange pins saying "Save Our Jobs." The draw at Hooters isn't the burgers or the chicken wings -it's the lively wait­resses in skimpy uniforms. The recommendation from the EEOC isn't binding, but it allows the agency to file a complaint if ignored. Hooters of America Inc., based in Atlanta, said Wednesday that's exactly what it will do. "A lot of places serve good burgers. The Hooters Girls, with their charm and all-American sex appeal, are what our customers come for," said Mike McNeil, a Hooters vice president, at a conference in Washington. In Atlanta, the mostly male clientele during the busy lunch hour scoffed at the idea of being served by men in bright orange hot pants and tight, white T -shirts or tank tops, the standard 
uniform for Hooters waitresses.

that the three had been "brutally

The robber or robbers apparent­
ly got away without being seen by 
patrons or employees at nearby 
businesses. Housman said it 
appeared that the criminals fled 
on foot about 200 yards across a 
field to where they may have left a 
car. Detectives reportedly un­
covered some bills and rolled coins 
at the edge of a field behind the 
restaurant. 
"If they wanted the money, they 
should just have taken the 

money," employee Doreen AP Pagnatto said. "Why did they have to kill them?" 
The restaurant is located near an exit of Interstate 75, the main highway known as Alligator Alley that links South Florida's east and west coasts. Cracker Barrel, based in Lebanon, Tenn., is a chain of 231 family-style restaurants in 26 states in the Southeast, Midwest and Southwest. 
Prostitute mistaken for a man 
DENVER 

A woman arrested on prostitution charges spent 15 hours in the men's jail and had sex with two prisoners before deputies discovered she was no man. The officer who arrested Jimmie Joe McGee thought she was a man, and so did jail guards, said sheriffs Capt. Carlos Jackson. McGee, 5-foot-7 and 145 pounds, was frisked by a deputy, "but it was just a pat search for weapons." "We've had very effeminate-looking males come into the jail ... including transsexuals and transvestites," Jackson said. "Those are things that contributed to the mistake." McGee, 38, spent Friday night in a individual cell at the jail, which had 60 male prisoners. She told guards she willingly had sex with two prisoners, one of whom was a friend, in an empty cell during a half-hour when the pris­oners were released into a common room to await court hearings. There was no indication she charged the men. The mix-up wasn't discovered until other prisoners tipped the deputies Saturday; her attitude toward being locked up with the men was "nonchalant," according to Jackson. No disciplinary action is planned. "There was absolutely no indication in this that the staff behaved improperly," Jackson said. 
The crossbow: Weapon of choice? 
BOSTON 

Donald Graham saw Michael Blodgett flash his high beams at another car, \lnd Graham didn't like it. Graham chased Blodgett's car for seven miles on Interstate 95 be­fore both men pulled over. As Blodgett approached Gra­ham's car, the 56-year-old retired autoworker and church deacon reached into his trunk for his weapon and shot Blodgett-with a crossbow. The arrow hit Blodgett in the shoulder, and its expanding head scissored his in­sides. Within six hours, the 42-year-old had bled to death, another victim of a fearsome weapon that dates from the Middle Ages. Louis Mizell, a Washington securi­ty consultant who compiles crime statistics, says his com­pany has recorded 92 cases since 1987 in which cross­bows have been used to commit crimes in the United States. "Most people think of a crossbow as basically a gun, but it's not. Except for the trigger, the similarities end there," said Scott Thompson, customer service man­ager for Horton Crossbows of Ohio. Though lighter and more high-tech these days, the weapon is still a high-ten­sion bow set on a wooden stock. Crossbow bolts don't fly much farther than arrows from a regular bow -about 250 yards at most. They are accurate to about 50 yards.

Abortion after rape 'not the right decision' 
By DEREK BETCHER 
News Writer 
Should we allow abortions for 
·women who have become preg­nant as a result of sexual assault? This question has troubled many pro-life activists, but not Julie Makimaa. 
Makimaa is the president and founder of Fortress, an Illi­nois-based organization dedi­cated to promoting and defend­ing the true interests of victims of sexual assault and of chil­dren conceived as a result of those crimes. She discussed this issue last evening in her lecture, sponsored by the ND/SMC chapter of Feminists For Life, entitled 'Conceived In Rape.' 
"I share my story in an effort to speak to people and say 'If we are pro-life, we need to be consistent,"' Makimaa opened. She went on to retell her life's experiences, in the hope that she would serve as an example promoting both the right to life and the positive value of reunit­ing adopted children with natu­ral parents. 
The story that unfolded be­fore the audience began with Makimaa's mother. In 1963, Lee Kinney was an eighteen­year-old secretary in Southern California. After working late one night, Kinney accepted an invitation to a co-worker's house where she was raped. Shamed into leaving her family, Kinney gave birth alone. She never saw the child because she delivered under anesthesia; the baby was immediately turned over to adoption agency officials. 
It was twenty years later when Julie Makimaa began the search for her biological moth­er. After nearly four years of hunting, the anxiety ended when Kinney and Makimaa fi­nally met face-to-face in early 1985. It was that evening that Makimaa learned the circum­stances surrounding her con­ception. 
''I'm not ashamed at all, bP­
cause if it hadn't happnned, 
then I wouldn't be here at all, " 
Makimaa said. 
Many anti-abortion a<~tivists 
will concede that in cases of 
rape or incest abortion is a 
considerable alternative. 
Makimaa views herself as an 
example of why that position 
should be unacceptable. 
"Most of us weren't born at 
the right time or in the right 
place. You don't have to be 
planned to be loved, you don't 
have to be expected to be 
loved," she asserts. Makimaa 
cautioned against lowering the 
value of a child's, life based 
upon its background by noting 
that this is the same evil rea­
soning that Adolf Hitler used 
fifty years ago. 
"Look at my life, how can I be 
anything but strictly pro-life?" 
Makimaa asked her audience. 
Since their reunion ten years ago, Makimaa and her mother have spent much of their time trying to raise awareness of their situation in order to show others that, in Makimaa's words, "Two wrongs don't make a right." 
"We've had the privilege of national exposure. In addition to appearing in coast to coast newspapers, we were able to share our story on "Donahue", "Geraldo", and "Sally .Jesse Haphael". Phil Donahue, an ac­tive pro-choicer, even admitted to me after the show that there would be a lot of people saved by that episode." 
Drawing from her experi­ences with Portress, Makirnaa proceeded to say that the pub­lic's negative perception of the issue is often different from that of the women with which she has worked. Makimaa said women who have carried their pregnancies to term will often make statements as strong as "I would gladly go through the assault again to have this child." In contrast, Makimaa's experience has shown that vio­lated women who have chosen to have abortions will com­monly claim, years after the event, to have healed from the assault, but not the self-initiat­ed abortion. Makimaa does admit, though, that the decision is not an easy one. 
"My mother confided in me 'I don't know what I would've done if abortion had been legal back then,"' she said. In a thinly veiled challenged to pro­choice advocates, Makimaa noted that it was the former il­legality of the act, as much as anything, that kept her mother from making what they believe could have been the wrong de­cision. 
"When I look in the mirror, when I look at my two chil­dren-1 realize that all of this would have been lost if some­one at Planned Parenthood had told my mother 'Don't worry, this isn't your fault, we'll take care of it for you.' Sure, it's crazy having to buy two Mothers' Day cards and gifts, but I realize that my situation is a blessing," Makimaa said.

very different attitude on cam­pus when I was here. There was no gay and lesbian student group, and I didn't come out until graduation. 
"I was very moved by the whole experience, it was very exciting," he said. "This is the last place in the world that I thought this could happen." 
Ignacio said that both Moore and Coli were helpful. 
"Moore couldn't really give us the reasons why the admin­istration declined to comment for the program," Ignacio said. "He just explained the official University policy describing the reasons why they felt they couldn't recognize the group." 
"However, he didn't rule out the possibility that a different gay and lesbian group with a different mission statement might eventually be recog­nized," he said. "We felt that was both encouraging and sur­prising." 
"Sister Regina Coil pointed out that the Notre Dame family doesn't only include the admin­istration," he said. "There are faculty, students, and staff who all seem to support the student group. I find that very encour­aging." 
Ignacio admitted that he had mixed feelings about the con­troversy. 
"I am disappointed and dis­couraged by the University's position, but I'm also proud of what the student group is doing and the large amount of sup­port for them," he said. "I think that things are going to change eventually." 
Ignacio admitted that the controversy also provided the impetus for a reconciliation of sorts with the University. 
"I had previously felt very isolated and hac,ln't kept in touch with the Alumni Associa­tion," he said. 'Tm going to rekindle my connection with the school because of this ex­perience." 
''I'm looking forward to working with the group and joining the Gay and Lesbian Alumni Association," he said.

PBS Wars, persecution force out millions

By ALEXANDER HIGGINS number uprooted is up 6 mil­news conference today that the thought, many conflicts would 
be resolved.... Almost precisely the opposite has happened." 
But with the end of the Cold War, the world's view of na­tional sovereignty changed, and the United Nations has increas­ingly been able to help dis­placed people in their own countries. 
The picture also has bright­ened since 1990, with the re­turn of 9 million refugees to their homes in places like Mozambique, Central America and Cambodia. 
Among the major problem countries cited are: 
• 
The republics of former Yu­goslavia, where 3.7 million peo­ple have been displaced or oth­erwise affected by war. 

• 
Rwanda and Burundi, where more than 2 million refugees are part of the largest concentration of displaced peo­ple in the world. 

• 
Caucasian states of the for­mer Soviet Union, including Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia, with 1.5 million people displaced. 

• 
Some 2.5 million refugees remain in Pakistan and Iran even though 3 million have gone home in as many years.

Adams sees need for boost Bishops encourage 
lay Catholics to lead
By LAWRENCE KNUTSON 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON 

The peace process in North­ern Ireland is at a "very critical impasse" and urgent steps are needed to restore momentum, the head of the political party allied with the outlawed Irish Republican Army said Wednes­day. 
After meeting with senior administration aides just days before President Clinton's scheduled trip to London and Belfast, Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams told reporters: "The sit­uation is tremendously fragile and it is now at its most serious than at any time since we've tried to put forward sensible proposals .... " 
"We now need to salvage and reestablish the process," Adams said as he emerged from an hour-long meeting at the White House with national security adviser Anthony Lake. 
But White House spokesman Mike McCurry said the planned visit by Clinton to Britain and Ireland at the end of the month to try to reinvigorate the pro­cess has been placed at some risk by the continuing budget crisis between the White House and Congress. 
That crisis prompted Clinton to cancel his weekend trip to Japan. where he was to attend an Asian-Pacific economic con­ference. 
He said he was needed in Washington to deal with the budget crisis. 
McCurry said the trip to Britain, the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland is still on and has not been canceled as of now. 
"But he said the budget impasse could be prolonged and added, "We'll have to take it day by day." 
The White House said Lake used the meeting with Adams to underscore the U.S. view that momentum can be restored to the stalled peace process by opening simultane­ous "twin-track" negotiations on both a general peace settle­ment and on the issue of dis­arming Catholic and Protestant militias. 
The issue of "decommission­ing " weapons in the hands of underground armies has proved a major stumbling block in the search for a wider peace settlement. 
Adams contended that blame for the snag in the process rests squarely with British Prime Minister John Major, who has refused to open all-party talks until the IRA and other armed groups empty their arsenals. 

"I think the real difficulties which have been placed in the road toward a peace settlement have not been placed by the administration, not by me, or indeed even the Unionists" who support keeping Northern Ire­land a part of Britain, Adams said. 
"They've been placed there by John Major," he said. "It is he who has taken an unreason­able position. 
"It is beyond, I think, most sensible people why a British government is making excuses for not talking." 
He called on the administra­tion to draw on the close rela­tionships it has with Britain and Ireland "in order to move us out of this current very criti­cal impasse and to a more posi­tive (situation) and indeed actu­ally salvage the process." 
But he added, "I can't declare in any detail how that can be done .... " 
Clinton is scheduled to arrive in London on Nov. 28 and to travel to Belfast on Nov. 30.

WASHINGTON 

The nation's 60 million Catholics, who have long sought a greater role in running their church, should be given the opportunity, U.S. bishops declared Wednesday. 
In a major new statement on the role of non-ordained Catholics, the bishops stopped short of meeting the desires of laypeople to be involved in set­ting church policies on issues from divorce and remarriage to selecting parish priests. 
But they did say Catholics should be encouraged to get out of their pews and into small faith communities, parish coun­cils, theology schools and other places where they can take new leadership roles alongside cler­gy. 
The bishops addressed what is becoming an increasing :;ource of conflict as a well-edu­cated, independent laity chafes at the restrictions of a tradi­tionally hierarchical church, 
The church needs to encour­age and subsidize lay ministries and establish groups on the parish, regional and national levels to receive the "wisdom of the laity," they said. 
"We consider lay participa­tion in church life at all levels a gift of the Holy Spirit, given for the common good," the bishops said in their statement, "Called and Gifted for the Third Millennium." 
On the third day of their. an­nual fall meeting, the bishops also: 
• 
Issued a warning not to take the faith of Hispanic Catholics for granted. 

• 
Approved a vocation strat­egy that enlists groups from the Knights of Columbus to Catholic Scouts and Campfire Girls to recruit future priests and nuns. 


The bishops' statement on the laity comes 30 years after the Second Vatican Council's Decree on the Apostolate of the Laity that paved the way for dramatic changes giving non­ordained Catholics a greater role in the church. 
Today, at least half of the ap­proximately 20,000 parishes in the country have laypeople or nuns in pastoral staff positions.

Wednesday's offer "with a heavy heart, in light of the cir­cumstances." 
"The death of a great prime minister, the late Yitzhak Ba­bin, has left the nation shocked and pained," he said. "I will make every effort to form a government that will broaden peace with our neighbors and within us." 
Meanwhile, police arrested an eighth student suspected of aiding Babin's assassination, and charged two others for attempting to desecrate the slain prime minister's grave. 
Peres, 72, has been a fixture of Israeli politics since the 1950s.

The Chinese report also sug­gests that one member of Homo, called Homo erectus, evolved in Asia rather than immigrating from Africa. 
Both studies appear in Thursday's issue of the journal Nature. 
Before the Chad finding, aus­tralopithecines had been known from sites in South Africa and the Rift Valley in the east African nations of Ethiopia, Kenya and Tanzania. The Chad site lies some 1,500 miles west of the valley. 
The finding suggests aus­tralopithecine reJUains may also be found even farther west, because the deposits that held the new fossils extend into Cameroon, said researcher Michel Brunet of the University of Poitiers in France. He re­ported the finding with col­leagues in France and at Har­vard University.

Opposition leaders say Peres' slim majority is inappropriate for making decisions as critical as giving up strategic and his­torically significant land. 
Those expecting to be pro­moted in the new Cabinet in­clude Economics Minister Yossi Beilin, 4 7, Peres' closest aide, and Interior Minister Ehud Barak, 53, a popular former army chief. 
Haim Ramon, 4 7, a leading Labor Party member, is also expected to get a post. 
Peres also met Wednesday with Rabbi Yehuda Amital, who heads a moderate religious movement but is not a Knesset member, and Israel Radio said Amital may be offered a Cabinet position. 
Beilin indicated the new gov­ernment will continue and even accelerate the peace process in the 12 months remaining be­fore scheduled Israeli elections.

NEWYOBK Scientists have discovered a ·partial jaw some 3 million to 
3.5 million years old that sug­gests early human ancestors roamed over much more of Africa than previously thought. 
The remains were found in 
Chad in central Africa, far from 
previously known fossil sites on 
the continent's east coast and 
southern tip. 
The find greatly extends the 
known range of australop­
ithecines, human predecessors 
that appeared after the evolu­
tionary split away from the an­
cestors of modern apes. Aus­
tralopithecines gave rise to the 
group called Homo, which in­
cludes modern people. 
In a second report, scientists presented new evidence for the relatively recent idea that Homo had left Africa and reached Asia by around 2 mil­lion years ago. Researchers reported that a partial jaw, a tooth and some stone tools found in a Chinese cave are 
1. 7 8 million to 1.96 million years old, making them the old­est known remains of human

Rules oflife to follow 
"Buckle your Birks." 
Every time I see my father or, better, every time he sees me with my sandal straps flapping, that's what I hear. I get tired of repeat­ing the explanation that, when I get pebbles caught -which hap­
pens a lot on campus ­
it's easier to kick a 
Birkenstock off if it's 
not buckled. 
Jull·e Ferraro 
The relationship
between child (sorry, 
should have said 
"young adult") and par­
ent has been the sub­
ject of books, articles, lectures' and debates. One popular focal point is just how far does "Honor thy father and mother" go? A rule of thumb might be: if they're paying, follow their rules. 
Taking a step up the list of Ten Commandments, just how far does "I am the Lord thy God... " go? The same rule of thumb given for parents could apply, slightly altered: God gave us life, follow His rules. But, which ones? 
Since the days of Adam and Eve, God has Iaid down rules, most notably the ten He gave to Moses. Jesus came along and shed new light on the old and added a few new rules. Confusing, isn't it? 
Jews follow the kosher laws, the Sabbath laws. Christians don't. Why? It's the topic of ongoing dialogue between the churches. Each church claims their road will win believers salvation, and they each follow a slightly different set of rules. Individuals, too, interpret these rules differently, escalating the confusion. 
Too bad God doesn't just pop in on us and say, "Okay, do this." Wouldn't it be nice? It sure would be a lot simpler. SJill. we are humans, above all other creatures; Americans, with the guts to go where angels fear to tread; and Domers, which is pretty darn close to being God's own "green berets" (blue and gold berets?). Being so special, we must personally accept the challenge to follow God's rules. But, we've still got to figure them out. 
The Big 10 (not the athletic conference) are equal to our parents' house rules: be home by midnight, no smoking in the house, get passing grades or lose your car -whatever. Those are easy. We automatically know that if we break one, we're in deep trouble. 
Then, there are the other ones. Where does God specifically say that we can't tell our roommate's sweetie a fib because he's out partying when he should have picked her up at Badin? I wouldn't want to end up in the middle of a war like that, for sure. Is it wrong, or is it excusable? Even experienced businessmen don't know the answer to that. 
And there's not always a priest around to ask. 
Just like our parents have to "let go" when we're old enough to do for ourselves, so too we reach a point when we must decide for ourselves about following God's rules. The wild thing is: we may never know all the rules (because people keep changing them around), but we'll keep on our toes trying.

T
ry as I may to be cheerful and to maintain a positive attitude, lately I've been focusing much more on the negatives in my life than the positive things. I've been complaining to friends and family about aspects of my life, a bit personal to detail here, that seem to bother me around the clock. Some of my confidants have told me that my problems are really not all that major, and that I have so many good things goirig for me that was so refreshing to see it in Mandy as well. I hope, especially in light of this tragedy, that other women on the two campuses will reflect on Mandy's positive attitude and adopt it as a goal to be reached for themselves. 
I
know, too, that Mandy has close friends ­

positively overwhelming. Or so I thought until the other night. when I learned of a tragedy which profoundly affected the life of a member of the Notre Dame family. 
As many of you probably know, senior Mandy Abdo was involved in a severe car accident this past weekend. I don't know much about her condition, other than that it is serious, so I can't say much on this issue. Nor do I really know her as a person, and for that reason I feel I should leave this topic to one of her friends. But I do feel that I must comment on the little that I do know about this situation, for none can doubt that it is important for the Notre Dame-Saint Mary's family to remain aware of Mandy's plight and to support her during this difficult time. 
I had the pleasure of meeting Mandy bri~y. when she was cast in a play with my sister Melissa last spring. She performed superbly, and was friendly, upbeat and a joy to speak to. Perhaps most importantly, though, was the fact that she and my sister -who attends Saint Mary's -were friends at all. Melissa is rare in that she has several female friends at Notre Dame, but overall I sense that tension between the women on the campuses runs rampant. 
Where stereotypes exist, it is easy -indeed, natural -to succumb to them and the behav­ior they evoke. It takes a strong individual to rise above them and to discover the truth for themselves. I have always known that my sister is such a person, but this is a rare trait, and it

Mandy's friends have stuck with her thus far, and I can­not but think that they will continue to do so. Moreover, I know that friends like this are not easily acquired; they are earned. The devotion Mandy's friends are currently showing is not only proof of what types of people they them­selves are, it is a reflection of Mandy, too-of what a special person she must be. ast but not least, I think that situations like this should cause us to re-examine our own attitudes and perhaps to change them. The "your problems seem bad until you look at those of someone else" theme has been used to the point where it is trite and annoying. But when someone else's problems strike as severely and as close to home as they have done in this instance, I do not think the accura­cy of the point can be denied. My own prob­lems have not disappeared, but I would feel guilty were I to dwell on them too much right now, and I know that when I say my nightly prayer tonight, Mandy, and not myself, will be my primary focus. 
I hope that other members of the Notre Dame-Saint Mary's community will likewise keep her in their thoughts and prayers.

• LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 
In defense of folk music as part of the Mass 
Music as ministry ~.~d~g with talent 
Perhaps this is not the proper forum for this letter but I would like to use it to respond to Benjamin Evans' arti­eln whieh appeared in the inaugural issue of Right Heason. It is an article which addresses the question of "folk" musk and the Mass. I must first preface this by telling you that I am a member of Notre Dame Folk Choir and that my comments here do not necessarily reflect those of the choir or the director. They are completely my own. 
I eommend Evans on his extensive knowledge of the history of Liturgical Music and respect his admiration of the traditional music so beautifully done by my brothers and sistnrs in the musie ministry of this campus, the liturgical choir. I. too, have been moved by their music and fen! that they have enhanced my worship of God and my spiritual refleetion during Mass. 
But the music at the 10 a.m. Mass is not the only music that has moved me. The music at the 11:45 Mass has dorw all that the traditional music has done, and per­haps more for me. It is not because of the catchy tune or cool lwat. but rather the simplidty and, yes, tlw lyrical contnnt. I don't know. I think 'F.rst, nothing is sorn1~ of tlwse songs ever a perfor­really talk to people

And do not have the temerity to suggest what you think the Saints would think about liturgical music; you simply have no idea and no right to make this claim. I have seen first hand what our musie means to poople both here and elsewhere, twtm overseas. It is indeed something special and mean­ingful to then and to mn. 
I fetd I must defend my fellow choir members who you rder to as "lloly Hollers" who "perform extremely bad music as wnll." First. nothing is ever a performance for us, it is ministry and it is ministry by an exceptional group of individuals. I can't say enough good things about them. I am extremely proud to be in that loft with tlwm Sunday morning. Perhaps we do not meet the cri­tnria you have in mind for what should be at the Mass, hut my gut and the gut of others tells me it is right just as "Ave Verum Corpus" is right, just as "0 Sifuni Mungu" is right. For you to say that the choir's talent is being used to detract from the Mass is the height of insult to tlwsn wonderful people, and I feel sorry for you that your )wart and mind am so small they cannot see this. 
Evans. I am a humble person, certainly not as sophisti­eatl~d as you. But when I go to the 11:45 Mass, I am lift­ed up thanks to those "holy rollers" in the loft and I do not apologize for it; I rejoice in it.

Dear Editor: 

In response to the recent publication, Right Reason, and more specifically to Benjamin Evans' article on why folk music should be "confined to the wastebas­ket of history," several issues are raised that cannot be brushed aside. First of all, I acknowledge the fact that this sort of publication is an extremist view writ­ten for the sole purpose of raising the ire of most members of the community and nothing else. Evans fits this description as well. However, he elicited this response from me because I feel strongly about music and the use of music in praise of our God, and I don't want his opinions (and they are simply his opinions) to be the only ones available in print. 
Let me begin by explaining the nature of folk music as it stands today, not as Evans believes it to be. Folk groups are not, as Evans contends, a bunch of smiley, pot smoking, leftover hippies who want to "drown the mind in a sea of passions," but rather they are hard working, sophisticated, and educated people who are dedicated to celebrating the Mysteries of the Eucharist in a way that is desirable to the mass of people who make up the Catholic Church. Many of the people composing folk music today have studied theology and Church history, and are much more well informed about the liturgy than Evans. The com­positions are not simple three chord progressions, but they consist of highly developed four-part vocal harmonies with an ensemble backing; an ensemble made up of guitar, flute, violin, harp, and, oh by the way, organ. The music is not complex, allowing quick entrance into both the spirit of the prayer and the words of the prayer by the congregation. Also, the words have not been altered from their original text in Scripture. 
The Folk Choir sings at the 11:45 Mass at the Basilica of the Sacred Heart. That statement is a tes­tament to the fact that the music is liturgically cor­rect. We are Notre Dame, one of the best known Catholic institutions in the world. We are not perfect. But one thing is certain: We maintain the standards of liturgical correctness with scientific precision, especially at the Basilica. It is an insult to Father Malloy, to Father Richard Warner (head of Campus Ministry), and to the entire Congregation of Holy Cross to say that they don't know enough about the history of Sacred Music or of the Church herself. that they consistently allow such transgressions against the acceptability of what should occur during Mass. It is simply not possible that folk music is not an acceptable way of praising God. 
However, notice that the 11:45 Mass is not the only Mass at the Basilica every Sunday. We, as Catholics, have the opportunity to worship God in many differ­ent ways. The day they eliminate that freedom is the day I will stop being Catholic. Therefore, it is impor­
"\r--ei'---)'

tant to note that the Choirs of this campus are not in competition with each other. The Liturgical Choir is an excellent group of people who bring Sacred Scripture into the world through song in a different way than the Folk Choir docs. Nor is there a competi­tion between the music at the Mass and the Paschal Sacrifice present in the Eucharist. This applies to both choirs, and in fact, all choirs here at the University. 
We are a Church of people: many parts, but we are consistently unified through the Sacrifice Jesus made for us. To eliminate folk from our idea of Church leaves us with an empty building, devoid of the peo­ple Christ came to love and to save. For this reason, folk music is essential. Not everyone enters into prayer as Evans does, through contemplation with the assistance of a beautiful piece of classical music. Limiting the Church to works of music composed hundreds of years ago would wipe out the face of the Catholic Church. Are we to eliminate the celebratory rhythms of African Catholics? Arc we to ignore the soothing melodies of our French brethren in the expressive Taize tradition? Or the joyful sounds of Spanish percussion? It is simple ethnocentricity that allows Evans to conjure up images of a Catholic Church only accompanied by an organ, only playing songs by dead European men. Our Churcl) is bigger than that. 
As for the invective remarks Evans makes about those people who not only like folk music, but actual­ly find it helpful in contemplating the mysteries of the Divine, I can only say one thing: Get off your high horse. Comments like the ones Evans makes through­out his diatribe illustrate the true nature and mean­ing of the author and the artiele: not to have an open discussion of the liturgical correctness of folk music at Mass, but simply to convey incendiary opinions for the purpose of tearing down rather than building up the Church. I can lind no true desire to discuss music at the Mass, simply a thinly veiled railing of folk music and the people who make it. 
We are a Church rich with tradition. Uniquely, the American Catholic Church is able to draw from a variety of cultural traditions in addition to the European Catholic viewpoint. We are foolish to ignore these traditions and isolate ourselves in the workings of dead composers, and we are foolish to cut ourselves off from the same. Folk music, thank­fully, is a part of the fabric of musie that makes up our contemporary Sacred Song. We cannot deny its importance in today's worship, but at the same time, we are not demanding everyone worship in the same way. We are many parts, but we are all one body.

Hecently, there has been a lot of nostalgic talk about the last game played at Notre Dame Stadium, before the renovations begin. Some may say it was ND vs. Navy; others may say it was the Women's lntcrhall Championship; but die-hard ND trivia buffs should note that the "true" final game was played by a group of graduate students on Sunday, Nov. 5. 
Under a cold, grey, November sky, not long after the erowds of undergrads had left ND Stadium after watehing the Women's Interhall Championship Game, there was still one final game left to be played in the I louse that Rockne built. In a fierce (but not highly publicized) gamo, the EE-agles defeated the X-Men 12-6 to claim the Graduate/Faculty/Staff Football Championship. 
The Grad/Fac/Staff League is almost always overlooked by The Observer Sports Department and usually given second-class status by RecSports. This is unfortunate, since some of the players in this league played Division I, II, or Ill Varsity Athletics during their undergraduate

years, and thus, the quality of play and level of competition for most of these sports is usually quite high. It is even harder to understand tlw lack of coverage sincn the Grari/MBNI.aw pro­grams account for almost 2300 members of the Notre Dame community. Hopefully, the amount of coverage given to graduate sports at ND will increase in the future. 
Many of us graduate students are double (or even triple) dorners, having spent our undergrad years here as well, and after 8-10 seasons of Notre Dame Football. it was quite a thrill to be able to say goodbye to the old stadium in style. In spite of the scheduling and other hassles over the season. it was a tl~rrilie finish and we'd like to take this opportunity to thank Hich O'Leary and RecSports, and referees Kevin Kuwik and Catherine llill for helping to make this memo­rable oceasion possible.

• THEATRE REVIEW 
Six Degrees o:f Separation 
By JIM DOWD 
Accent Theatre Critic 
T
he lights go up in Washington Hall to reveal a piece of modern art. The stage is painted blue and cov­ered with various colored blocks carved with different shapes and sizes. A two sided, revolving painting is positioned above the stage. The neo-classical music is dramatic and disturbing. The actors ease onto the stage from every imag­inable direction. They pause and freeze while the abstract painting revolves exhibiting its brighter side. Friends, this is not Moliere! 
When asked about his controversial, challenging play, "Six Degrees of Separation, John Guare responded, "For me, the play is all about Kandinsky." The Kandinsky is an exceptional paint­ing, painted on both sides, one curva­ceous and vivid, the other angular and subdued. Indeed, the fast-paced, ener­getic play about those who seem to have everything, but really have nothing, is all about contrasts. The play suggests that life-like the Kandinsky-has a lot of color, but not much structure. 
The play relates the story of Ouisa and Flan Kittredge, very rich New York art dealers. As they are leaving for a busi­ness dinner, prepared to sell their ideas and dreams, the doorman presents a well-dressed, African-American youth with a stomach wound. He claims to have been mugged and has asked to see the couple because he supposedly knows their children, who are classmates of his at Harvard. 
Paul, the young con-man, claims to be the son of Sidney Poitier, and draws the Kittredges in by promising them movie roles in his father's film version of the musical "Cats." The Kittredges are drawn to the exceptional young man who cooks for them and then treats them to an oral treatise on the role of the imagination in today's society. The action takes off from here as the play turns into a psychological mystery I comedy of manners. 
The title refers to the statistical theory that claims we are all related to each other by six degrees: two people any­where on the planet would only have to go through six acquaintances for them to be related. While this may be true, Guare satirizes the concept of unity and closeness through the disunity of his play and through the utter contempt he displays between parent and child. Ironically, he shows us how distant peo­ple can be from their spouse, family, or friends. 
This notion comes across humorously on stage, but we must take his social cri­tique to heart. Are we all really this fake and self-indulgent? Have we lost tradi­tional family values? Can we be duped this easily by eloquence and flattery? 
Most importantly, however, this play deals with two essential but controver­sial issues: racism and homosexuality. Bravo to the Communication and Theatre department for taking this risk! The con-artist Paul is African-American and that fact makes him automatically suspect according to the rich parents in the play. Surprise, surprise, Paul is also homosexual! 
Guare depicts male homo-erotic desire with no holds barred. He treats homo­sexuals as average, sexually active peo-pie. The ease and nonchalance with which he presents male lust in this play is amazing. Guare simply portrays humanity: black, white, rich, poor, homosexual, or heterosexual. 


This production cannot be discussed without mention of Reginald Bain's crisp and ereative direetion, Marielle Boneau's truly visionary, breathtaking set, Kristy Zloch's thoroughly accom­plished, whimsical but compassionate Ouisa, Drew Rausch's anxious, preten­tious, self-absorbed Flan, and several impressive supporting performances led by the brilliant Willie Lajoie, who gar­nered the most laughs of the evening as an angst-ridden, bitter college student. 
Run, don't walk, to Washington Hall, Thursday through Sunday for evening performances at 8 p.m. amd the Sunday matinee at 2:30 p.m. Tickets are $6 for students, $8 for the general public. I guarantee that you will have much to discuss after the performance. Remember, as Paul tells us, "Imagination helps us face ourselves. It makes the act of self examination bear­able."

I 
could not continue writing reviews for this newspa­per in good conscience without reviewing Air Miami's latest. If you are a fan of mid-eighties pop in the vein of INXS or bands like Unrest, then this is a must-have album. Playful, gentle grooves, and many mid-eighties effects make this album a winner. The songs range from the bass-oriented, very Unrest-like "World Cup Fever," to the gentler ramblings of "Special Angel." Bridget Cross and Marc Robinson combine their voices in an outstanding example of harmonious bliss on "Special Angel." Among the album's other out­standing tracks is the bizarre, spacey "Sweet as A Candy Bar," which sounds much like a lost Dee-Light track. Without a doubt, though, one of the album's best tracks is "I hate milk," which cruises rhythmically, bouncing around on its own reverberations. This song is fast, good. eighties pop --in the nineties. This is very good, accessible material that makes me want to dance every time I throw in "World Cup Fever" or "Neely." Even the CD design has the luscious feel of mid-eighties glossy fashion that we Americans share as a semi-com­mon cultural memory. Enjoy.

he Beatles, the Stones, Led Zeppelin. Pioneering rock acts and trendsetters all, but they were all legaeies of a great American art form: the blues. 
Most of us under the Dome know that a blues mecca lies just an hour and change up the toll road, but for most, the Chicago Blues scene exists either on NPR or in the imagination. This weekend, however, Chicago blues will come to South Bend, courtesy of two of its legends and one of its standard-bearers at ND. 
Thursday night at Acoustic Cafe, the show will open with the Off-the-Wall Blues Band, featuring sociology professor Gene llalton on harmonica. Their perfor­mance will be followed by David Myers, one of the pioneering bassists of the Chicago blues seene. 
Friday night, blues drummer Sam Lay will be in town. Lay, who has drummed with blues legends like Muddy Waters, llowlin' Wolf and John Lee Hooker, will be showing his own home movies at Montgomery Theater (in Lafortune) on Friday night at 7 p.m., fea­turing footage of almost the entire Chicago blues community. Following the show, Lay, guitarist Rockin' .Johnny, and Halton will alight for the Midway Tavern for a 10-o'clock set of blues. 
While Myers and Lay are legends in their own right, Halton's own band has an impressive resume as well. llalton, singer Michael Phillips and Rockin' Johnny played together in a local combo, the Mighty Hurricanes. The Hurricanes once had the privilege of opening for Bobby Bland and, later, Son Seals. 
The other Off-the-Wall members are bassman John Baker and guitarist Hiro Kinoshi. Baker has toured with Eddie Burks and Alamo guitarist Hubert Fumlin. Konishi hails from Kobe, Japan. an unlikely home­town for a bluesman, which prompted his relocation to Chieago "specifically to play the blues," as Halton noted. 
Halton is pleased that the blues is making its return to Notre Dame. As recently as 1979, Notre Dame hosted a blues festival yearly. Son House, Son Seals, Buddy Guy and other legends would make the trip to South Bend for a weekend of blues in Stepan. Now, one mus't board the South Shore to get the real thing, but it's worth the trip, with legends like Otis Rush still playing in Chicago clubs. 
Myers himself is still active at the ripe old age of 69. He was the first guitarist in Chicago to play an elec­tric bass. Prior to that, he had been playing "hard guitar bass" style, which involved plucking basslines on a six-string electric guitar. He popularized the electric bass through his work with the Aces, featur­ing his brother Louis on harmonica, and with the Muddy Waters band.

Chicago blues bassist David Meyers plays tonight at Acoustic Cafe. 
As Halton noted. Myers is far from the only blues­man whose career extends back into the '40s. Halton and Myers toured with Pine Top Perkins recently. The band members' ages ranged from Roekin' Johnny, 25, to Perkins, 82. Halton reealled one occasion where, on the morning of a particularly grueling roadtrip, Perkins and Myers were "the first ones awake" and were raring to go. 
Indeed, that experience may well summarize the essence of the blues lifestyle. Many of today's living legends of blues made the arduous trip from the Delta region, through Memphis, St. Louis and finally on to the promised land of Chicago. !Ialton noted that along the way, they fought poverty, racism and hard luck all for the pleasure of playing their music every night. 
Their Jives have influenced their art, whieh is, at its core, one of live performance and grueling schedules. A reporter asked Myers why Perkins, at 82, still played and toured. Myers replied incredulously, "Are you kidding? ... Why keep living when you can die? Answer me that." 
That sums it up. Tonight and Friday, a piece of this storied art will graee our own community. After all these years, and countless musical trends, Notre Dame ean see where it all began.

Bringing 'em an 


'tnr 1<JIJ:~·s nixed Dream 
lardf!r, fans of tho Wall~ rboys w,rre hoping that Mike Scott's debut Bring 'f:'m !Ill In would bn a mortl consistent offer­ing. Alas, it isn't. At limns Scott snems to capturn tlw raw sen­sual nnergy that cllllirwd the WatNboys as one ol' the most exc:iting bands of the nighties, hut for the most part the absmH:e ol' the ollwr 'boys is all too nolie~mbln. 
At its ht~st /Jriny 'Em All In reinforces Scott's rnputation as orw of the more sensi­tivt~ and compelling songwritnrs of today. At its worst thn album lotlP.rs precariously on tlw brink of weak­knned sentimentalism and self-indulgence. 
The Waterboys always were a spiritu­al band, hut Scott's re­eent "born-again expmience" pervades this album, infusing it 
with a more intense spirituality than his work has prnviously exemplified. 
In tlw titlP. track Scott adopts the Divine standpoint ("Bring the unforgiven, Bring the unredeemed, Bring 'mn all into my heart") while in "lona Song" he utters the prayer, "Lord God fit me to be your hands and feel." 
Furtlwr evidence for thinking Scott has joined the flock is found in the wonderfully moving and very Dylannsque "What do you want me to do?" But --as orw might expect--Scott's God is not the God of Abraham. Isaac, and Jacob. 
Walling 
that the sound tlw hand delivers is nothing less than prototypical roots rock with blues and folk blended in for a stunning 
nfl'l~ct. 
"llold On To Midnight" is a mellow, eandlelit affair with swnnping harmonies and haunting acoustic gui­tar. whit:h provides a sweet eontrast to the rhythmi­cally challenging "Old /\ngels" which precedes it. l'owf~rtHI by great sensitivity for the dynamics of today's music, tlw slow tunes are soulful enough to makn you pay attention to the lyries, while tho rock­ms do more than just get the foot tapping. 
I.ml by a trio of great guitarists --Wayne Healy on searing lead, Marty Lloyd on aeoustic, and Rob Bonaeeorsi adding powerful slide work in addition to showing his prowess on banjo and mandolin--The 
He intersperses bib­lical allusions with references to the New Age community of Findhorn lin which Scott lived for a while and in which the al­bum was recorded), and he mentions "Mrs Caddy's book," an ode to Pan and his elfin Queen. Go figure. 
But is the music any good? Apart from the sublime love song "She is so Beautiful," most of Bring 'Em All In consists of overworked narrative set to under­inspired melody. It's not that the songs are awful, it's just that too many of them have that unmistakable "written-by-numbers" feel about them.

the electric guitar out of its case, the sound definitely fills out, but that only makes the absence of any bass and drums all the more noticeable. A more consistently unplugged approach might have produced a more satisfying album than the semi-plugged product Scott delivers. 
Viewed against the backdrop of Scott's CV, Bring 'Em Allin rates only a "pass, could do better." Perhaps he'll get together with his old mate Karl Wallinger of World Party and together they'll be able to recapture the Big Music. One can only hope.

Hasek brilliant for Sabres 
Associated Press 
Dominik Hasek had 29 saves and Randy Burridge and Pat LaFontaine each scored a goal to give Buffalo a 2-1 win Wednesday night over the Dallas Stars. 
Neither team found an offensive rhythm throughout the game, with the Stars generating 30 shots compared to the Sabres' 19. 
Andy Moog had 17 saves for the Stars, who have gone winless in their last seven games (0-4-3). 
Todd Harvey's goal 2:20 into the first period opened scoring for the Stars. Guy Carbonneau dug the puck off the boards and found Harvey. who skated in unmo­lested after a Sabres' defensive lapse and beat Hasek with a quick wrist shot. 
Burridge evened the score at 10:13. Burridge intercepted a Dallas pass, took the puck down the wing, beat Grant Ledyard and put a hard shot past Moog. His seven goals leads the Sabres. 
Moog's kick-save robbed Buffalo of a goal with about five minutes left in the period. 
Buffalo took the lead at 12:32 of the second period on Pat LaFontaine's goal. Brad May sent a blind pass from behind the goal to Donald Audette, who one­timed his pass to LaFontaine. 
The Sabres were unable to score with a two-man advantage late in the period. missing several goal opportunities. 
Both teams' penalty-killing units looked strong in the game. Buffalo and Dallas each stopped six power-play chances. 
Whalers 3, Senators 2 
Frantisek Kucera scored his first goal of the season with 1:06 remaining Wednesday night to give the Hartford Whalers a 3-2 victory over the Ottawa Senators. 
Kucera took a cross-ice pass from Geoff Sanderson and lifted the puck past Senators goaltender Don Beaupre for the Whalers' third victory in 12 games. 

Andrew Cassels and Nelson Emerson each had a goal and an assist for the Whalers. Rookie Daniel Alfredsson and Antti Tormanen scored for Ottawa. 
Despite playing for the second night in a row. Hartford was the stronger club in the third period. Cassels tied the game 2­2 with a power-play goal midway through the third period. With Radek Bonk off for hooking, Cassels set up in front and took a pass from Emerson to score his seventh goal. With 2:21 left, Hartford had a chance to take the lead, but Mark Janssens' backhand shot hit the left goal post. 
Don Beaupre stopped 27 shots for the Senators. Sean Burke made 34 saves. 
After a scoreless first period, Alfredsson put Ottawa on top with his eighth goal of the season. 
Alexander Godynyuk was in the Hartford penalty box when Alfredsson scored on a pass from Steve Duchesne with 12:27 remaining in the second. 
For Alfredsson the goal also moved him ahead of Los Angeles' Vitali Yachmenev in the NHL rookie scoring lead with 18 points. 
It also was his fourth goal against Hartford this season. Alfredsson scored three goals against the Whalers on Nov. 2, the only hat trick by a rookie this sea­son. 
But less than three minutes later, Emerson tied the game when he took a pass from Andrew Cassels behind the net and fired it over Beaupre's right shoulder for his seventh goal. 
It marked the first time in three games that the Whalers scored a power-play goal. Hartford captain Brendan Shanahan missed his third consecutive games with a torn ligament in his left wrist. 
The game marked the returned of Ottawa left wing Phil Borque, who missed all of training camp and the Senators' first 15 games recovering from knee surgery.

Oilers close to move 
By KARIN MILLER Associated Press 
NASHVILLE, Tenn. 
The final roadblocks were cleared Wednesday for the Houston Oilers to move to Nashville. 
"We have a deal," Nashville Mayor Phil Bredesen said. 
He flew to Houston on Wednesday to meet with Oilers owner Bud Adams. Bredesen said the two made only "lawyerly" changes in the 50­page agreement. 
Adams followed Bredesen to Nashville in his own jet. The two are to sign the deal Thursday in the lobby of the Metro Nashville Courthouse. Bredesen said provi­sions were added regarding luxury suites and seat license sales. 
The Nashville mayor said the deal will include a 30-year lease on the stadium with an option for 10 more years. 
"It's not a done deal until it's signed off on, but there's nothing other than the lawyering that needs to be done before we're ready to move forward," Mike McClure, Oilers executive vice president, said. "Now it's in the lawyers' hands." 
In a meeting that lasted more than three hours, Adams and Bredesen hashed out details of the city's $292 million plan to bring the Oilers to Tennessee. 
Neither Oilers nor Nashville offi­cials would release details. Bredesen said copies of the 50-page agreement would be released Thursday. 
It was not immediately known if the non-binding aspect of the agree­ment would remain in the contract. 
"We'll discuss any of those in the future when we get to that point," McClure said. 
The deal before Adams last 
Monday gave either side options to break the deal until a final lease on a new stadium is agreed to in early March. 
Adams also has to work out his current lease at the Astrodome, which ends after the 1997 season. 
Houston Mayor Bob Lanier said Wednesday he would not force tax­payers to pay for a stadium to keep the Oilers in town. 
"You have to consider whether or not you think it's wise to spend tax­payer money ... for that particular form of entertainment," said Lanier, who was overwhelmingly re-elected last week. "I wouldn't do it without the taxpayers voting for it. I haven't seen a deal yet that I would vote for myself." 
Lanier opposes building a new sta­dium, which is Adams' main demand to stay in Houston. The Nashville proposal includes a new stadium. 
When asked if he and County Judge Robert Eckels would be talk­ing to the Oilers about their plans, Lanier said: "I would say at this stage that any contact we would have (with the Oilers) would be best off not made through the press and you can read that any way you want to." 
Adams postponed Monday's sched­uled signing of the document, which extends the two parties' exclusive negotiating contract until March. 
The Nashville stadium would be paid for primarily through a bond issue and the sale of luxury seats and the rights to buy season tickets. The city council in Nashville and the state Legislature also must approve the deal. 
The Oilers have been in Houston since 1959 as a charter member of the old American Football League, which later merged with the NFL.

Irish

opened a rather gaping hole in this team. albeit one on the on·ensive side of the ball. 
Def(msively. the Irish are fac­ing a diiTerent sort of quarter­back problem. 
"Om~ of the reasons for Air Force's success this year has been their quarterback," said Davie. "He is the total pack­age. The kid reminds me of (1984 lleisrnan Trophy winner) Doug Flutie. He can run, he can throw, he can do it all." 
This total package goes by thll name of Beau Morgan, and he has done more than enough this season to warrant such 
. praise from the architect of the Irish defense. The 5'11", 187 pound junior has aeeounted for over 2,000 yards of total offense this sea­son, having aceumulated 1,039 yards and t 5 touchdowns on tlw ground while amassing 999 yards and 9 touchdowns through the air. To complicate matters for the 
Irish, they have been unable to 
effectively prepare for the 
wishbone attacks which have 
proven so problematic for them 
this season. 
"With Jarious having to learn the offense, we haven't have someone to give us a good look at it on the scout team," ex­plained Holtz. "If it's executed correctly, there is really no way to defend it. 
In the end, the outcome of this game will boil down to the execution. Much as they did against Navy, the Irish will have to snap the wishbone by capitalizing on the Falcons' mistakes. As Dan Patrick might say, they can't stop the Falcons, so they can only hope to contain them. 
"We're not going to just shut them down-nobody has so far," mused Davie. "We need to be opportunistic and create some turnovers. That will be the bottom line." 
The Irish hope to take advan­tage of such situations on Sat­urday, putting a rest to the Fal­con's upset hopes. Maybe then their 'wish' of a big-time bowl game will come true.

NEW YORK 
NBA referees, locked out since Oct. 1, could reach an agreement with the league by Friday, said Mike Mathis, the union's lead negotiator. 
Mathis and other union rep­resentatives met for about three hours Wednesday with NBA officials, including com­missioner David Stern. Negotia­tions were to continue Thurs­day. 
"We're encouraged," said Mathis, a 19-year veteran ref. "The dialogue is open. We feel good about what went on to­day." 
The talks were the first face­to-face negotiations since Oct. 28, and for the first time, the NBA's contingent included Stern. 
"We agreed not to go into any specilics about our meeting," said Jeffrey Mishkin, the league's chief legal officer. "It's 
Mathis, however, was more optimistic. He said it was pos­sible a deal eould be concluded by the end of the week, indicat­ing the two sides have moved closer together on salary lig­ures. 
"We'll be able to tell more tomorrow," he said. "Once we get past the bottleneck issues, it would go pretty quick." 
Once an agreement is reached, the 54 regular refs could be back on the court in about a week after completing a brief training camp. 
On Tuesday, the NBA sweet­ened its offer to the referees, proposing a five-year deal with an average annual increase of 
8.7 percent. The proposal pro­vides for an immediate 17 per­cent increase this year, the NBA said. 
However, the union said be­fore Wednesday's meeting that the new offer falls short of the referees' goal of being paid as much as officials in major league baseball and the NHL. 
NBA refs and NIIL referees, the 
union said. 
"The salary scale once again would pay NBA referees well below hockey officials," said Fred Slaughter, the union's general counsel. 
Last season, referees' pay ranged from $68,000 to $177,000, depending on se­niority. On Wednesday night in Toronto, a three-man crew of regular referees was to work the Raptors' game with the Houston Rockets to comply with a ruling from an Ontario labor board. 
The board held the league must allow its regulars to work games in Toronto until the two sides spend a specified amount of time trying to work out their differences. 
Two-man crews of substitute officials have worked all pre­season and regular-season games so far, although Stern said Tuesday night he hoped to have enough replacements trained to increase the crews to

Pippen leads Bulls past winless Cavaliers 
Associated Press 
Scottie Pippen scored 27 points and Michael Jordan 20 as the Chicago Bulls led all the way in beating the winless Cleveland Cavaliers 113-94 Wednesday night. 
The Bulls, who suffered their first loss of the season the pre­vious night at Orlando, tied the Magic for the NBA's best record at 6-1. 
Terrell Brandon scored 22 points for the Cavaliers, who tied a club record with eight 3­pointers in a half. Cleveland's 10 treys in the game tied the most ever against the Bulls, who were 8-of-12 from 3-point range. 
On Feb. 26 of last season,
-Cleveland was 33-20, a half­game out of first place in the NBA Central Division and eight games ahead of Chicago (26­29). But the Bulls went 21-6 the rest of the season, including 13­4 after Jordan came out of retirement. The Cavaliers, meanwhile, lost 19 of 29 games. The teams continued to go in opposite directions this season -with Chicago building around Jordan and Pippen for another championship run and Cleveland dumping high­salaried Mark Price and John Williams. But their 0-7 start is the club's worst since 1984-85, when the Cavaliers also lost their first seven. The Cavaliers knew it wasn't going to be their game early. Going for the first rebound of the game, Chris Mills had his 
nose bloodied by teammate Danny Ferry's elbow. 
It didn't get better for Cleve­land as the Bulls scored the first eight points, including a long 3-pointer by Jordan. 
About six minutes in, Bob Schoewe, one of the replace­ments for the locked-out refer­ees, called the Bulls for illegal defense. But after coach Phil Jackson and a few Chicago players protested, Schoewe re­versed his call. That upset Cleveland coach Mike Fratello, who later in the first half was assessed a technical foul by Schoewe. 
The Cavaliers trailed 25-15 before the Bulls put the game away with a 22-7 run that in­cluded five straight points by rookie Jason Caffey. 
Even seven 3-pointers in the third quarter couldn't get Cleveland closer than 12 points. Pippen's 35-footer just before the buzzer gave the Bulls a 91­66 lead heading into the fourth. 
Pacers 103, Heat 97 
Outshot, outrebounded and 
outnumbered, the Indiana Pac­
ers still beat the Miami Heat, 
thanks to Reggie Miller. 
The All-Star guard scored 10 
consecutive Indiana points in 
the final 6:10 Wednesday, and 
the Pacers won with only eight 
players in uniform, 103-97. 
Indiana was without injured 
center Rik Smits and four play­
ers suspended following a 
bench-clearing fight with 
Sacramento last Friday -Dale 
Davis, Adrian Caldwell, Duane 
Ferrell and Travis Best. 

But Miller, who has led the Pacers in scoring in all six games, scored 13 of his 24 points in the fourth quarter against the NBA's top-ranked defense. 
His 10-point run gave Indiana a 96-94 lead with 3:05 left. Teammate Ricky Pierce then hit a 3-pointer, and Miami was never again closer than three. 
The manpower shortage robbed the Pacers of height, and at one point their lineup averaged under 6-foot.-5. They were outrebounded 59-38 and shot just 43 percent, but stayed in the game by hitting 36 of 39 free throws. 
Miami hit 25 of 39 from the line. Indiana became the first team to score 100 points against the Heat, who were allowing an NBA-low 82 per game. Miami's Alonzo Mourning had 21 points and 12 rebounds. Rookie Sasha Danilovic scored a season-high 21 for the Heat, who lost for the first time in four games at home. 
Eddie Johnson had 23 and 
Pierce 22 for the Pacers. 
Trailing 68-56, Indiana scored 10 consecutive points to get back in the game. Miami's Keith Askins tied the game at 84-84 with a 3-pointer, then hit two more 3-pointers for a 92-87 lead before Miller took over. 
Bullets 127, 76ers 95 
This time, the Washington Bullets were the ones laughing on the bench as the clock wound down during a mean­ingless fourth quarter. 

The Bullets, who have been on the losing end of quite a few blowouts over the past few years, enjoyed one of their own Wednesday night. Robert Pack had 26 points, 10 assists and six ste-als as Washington cruised to a 127-95 rout of the Philadelphia 76ers. 
It was the Bullets' most lop­sided victory since a 42-point win over Boston in April 1994. Washington won just three games by more than 10 points last season, none by more than 16. 
"This the first real blowout I've had since I've been here," said third-year guard Calbert Cheaney, who evidently forgot about that Boston game. "It was definitely a lot of fun." 
Juwan Howard scored 21 points for the Bullets, who had five days to think about their previous game -an agonizing one-point loss to the. The Bullets came out eager to play, and the 76ers were unable to get out of the way.

Larkin surprise MVP choice 
By BEN WALKER 
Associated Press 

NEW YORK 
Barry Larkin was the surprise choice as NL Most Valuable Player on Wednesday, beating out Dante Bichette and Greg Maddux to become the first shortstop to win the award in 33 years. 
Maddux, who won his fourth straight Cy Young Award this week, and Bichette, who led the league in home runs and RBis, were considered the leading candidates. 
But rather than pitching or power, voters clearly looked at the all-around contributions Larkin made on and off the field to the NL Central cham­pion Cincinnati Reds, and made him a convincing choice. 
Larkin hit .319 with 66 RBis and 51 steals, is likely to win his second straight Gold Glove next week and was the team's clubhouse leader. He was also the Reds' best player in the postseason, although that per­formance is not considered in the selection. 
Larkin, who was on a cruise in Mexico when the award was announced, received 11 first­place votes and finished with 281 points. 
Bichette, whose 40 homers and 128 RBis led Colorado to a wild-card playoff spot, got six first-place votes and had 251 points. 
Maddux, 19-2 with a 1.63 ERA for the World Series cham­pion Atlanta Braves, got seven first-place votes and 249 points. He is the first pitcher to finish as high as third in the NL MVP voting since Los Angeles reliev­er Mike Marshall in 197 4. 
"If you look at sheer num­bers, there are guys who have more homers and RBis," Reds second baseman Bret Boone said. 
"But it's nice to see people look at 'most valuable.' He was really great on our team. He was our leader." 
Dodgers catcher Mike Piazza was fourth, getting three first­place votes and 214 points. The top four finishers were named on every ballot by members of the Baseball Writers Associa­tion of America. Ron Gant, Larkin's teammate, received the only other first-place vote. 
Larkin is the first NL short­stop to win the award since Maury Wills in 1962, the season he stole a then-record 102 bases. He is the sixth shortstop to win the honor, joining Ernie Banks (1958-59), Dick Groat (1960) and Marty Marion (1944). 
Larkin is the first Reds player to be named MVP since George Foster in 1977 and 11th over­all. Joe Morgan, Pete Rose and Johnny Bench also won in the 1970s. 
Along with leading the league in homers and RB!s, Bichette was third in batting at .340. Some voters, however, may have discounted his big num­bers because he played in hit­ter-friendly Coors Field. 
Larkin was the catalyst to the Reds' early-season turnaround. 
During a 1-8 start, Larkin called a team meeting that many players credited toward the push that made them divi­sion champions. 
Late in the season, when the Reds were struggling, another team meeting called by Larkin spurred them on.

that Gary is the armpit of the nation. ll has as mueh business being the home of an NFL team as the Arena football League moving outdoors. 
But that's what football is turning into these days. It's another business. Who earns about the fans, as long as there's morwy in owners' pockets. 
But who eould blame Cleveland owner Art Modell. who cited linaneial losses with his current Cleveland deal in his decision to movo his team to Baltimore. 
And rnalistieally, you can't blame Bears owner Mike McCaskey either. An attractive offer is looking him in the face. It's shiny and new, and a fresh change could do some people good, at least in his mind. 
But Cary'? Papa Bear Halas is rolling over in his grave. 
A definite compromise can be made twtwtHHl the Chicago Park District, which leases out the Bears' current stadium. Soldier Field. and the Bears' Board of l>irnctors. If not, Chicago should build them a rww stadium. Hegardless of if McCaskey is a grnmly businessman with no football knowlndgn. lie has a point if he's losing money. 
At the same time, a tradition such as the Bears is not one with which to be trifled. The Packers will never leave Wisconsin. Tlw Bears should never leave Chicago. Or worse. the Bears should never ever cross the stalll linn. move to a slum, and then have the audadty to eall itself a team from the Windy City. Traditions should be left alone. But then again. the Browns weren't supposnd to hlUVIl nither. 
Needless to say, Bears fans will be on pins and needles while they wait for a deci­sion from McCaskey. It's supposed to be made before December. 
A disturbing trend has started thanks to the Hams, who no one really gives two shakes about. the always-fickle Raiders and the once considered untouchable Browns. 
The trend can be stopped if a team like the Bears accepts an offer from the city and rnspm~ts its heritage.

Oklahoma opens up NIT with romp over Jackson State 
Associated Press 

Hyan Minor and Ernie Abercrombie scored 18 points apiece Wednesday night, helping lead Oklahoma past Jackson State 99-68 in the first round of the Preseason NIT. 
The Sooners (23-9 last year) will play their second­round game Friday against Georgia Tech, which beat Manhattan 87-67. 
Oklahoma controlled the offensive backboard and took advantage of poor first-half shooting by Jackson State to put the Tigers in a deep hole. Jackson State (12-19) only made 9 of its 42 shots in falling behind by 25 at halftime. 
Minor, named to the Associated Press preseason All­America team Tuesday, was not particularly sharp. The Big Eight's player of the year last season hit just six of his 15 shots and fouled out with 5:33 left. 
Abercrombie had nine rebounds to go with his points. lie and Jason Yanish, who had a career-high 17 points and 14 rebounds, helped the Sooners con­trol the Tigers inside from the start. 
Jackson State was outrebounded 56-30 and finished the night shooting 34 percent. Titue Hooten scored 27 for the Tigers, who are members of the Southwestern Athletic Conference. 
After shooting so poorly in the first half, the Tigers made seven of their first eight shots in the second half to get within 58-43. But then Dion Barnes scored eight points during a 14-2 run that erased any doubt about the outcome. The Sooners used a 17-3 run to move out to a 32-14 lead midway through the first half. Yanish came off the bench to score six during that time, and Minor added four. 
Jackson State only made three field goals in the final 7 1/2 minutes, all of them 3-pointers. The last of the three was by Trent Pulliam with 3:42 to play. That made the score 40-25, and Oklahoma closed out the half with 10 straight points, eight from Abercrombie. 
No. 17 Michigan 73, DePaul 65 Maurice Taylor scored 16 points and freshman Robert Traylor scored five of his eight points down the

stretch Wednesday night, leading No. 17 Michigan to a 73-65 win over DePaul in the first round of the Preseason NIT. 
The Wolverines, who held DePaul to 33 percent shooting, will play host Friday night to the winner of the game between Weber State and Fresno State. Jermaine Watts scored 30 points ­including five 3-pointers -for the Blue Demons, a 17-11 team last season with a first-round loss to Iowa in the postseason NIT. 
A 3-pointer by Dugan Fife broke a 57-57 tie with 6:34 re­maining and the Wolverines Jed the rest of the way as Traylor, a 6-foot-8, 300-pounder, hit a free throw, a dunk and a show-stop­ping driving layup. 
It was the first time the two schools had ever met in basketball. 
It was painfully evident in the early going that this was the first game for both teams. The Bl¥e Demons went 6:02 before making their first basket, while the Wolverines missed their first eight free throws. 
Traylor and Maceo Baston each drew first-half technicals for hanging on the rim. Michigan led 24-14 with 7:06 left in the half, but the shooting of Watts, who had three 3-pointers and nine free throws among his 20 first-half points, helped DePaul cut the deficit to 39-36 by halftime.

Yellow Jackets cruise to victory over Jaspers 

Associated Press 
Matt Harpring scored 24 points and Stephon Marbury added 16 while playing despite having tonsilitis as Georgia Tech beat Manhattan 87-67 in the opening round of the Pre­season NIT Wednesday night. 
The Yellow Jackets will meet the winner of the Jackson State-Oklahoma game in a sec­ond-round game in the Georgia Dome Friday night. 
Tech surged to a 12-point lead late in the first half, saw the Jaspers rally to cut the lead to 48-45 early in the second half on a dunk by Heshimu Evans, then began steadily pulling away after that. 
Manhattan had 27 turnovers in the season opener for both teams. Georgia Tech had 16. 
Harpring scored 17 of his points while leading Tech to a 46-36 halftime lead. 
Marbury, getting frequent breaks because of his illness that had him listed as doubtful right up to game time, also had 4 rebounds, 5 assists and 4 steals in his college debut. The Brooklyn, N.Y., native was one of the nation's top recruits last year. 

Evans and Jason Hoover led the Jaspers with 13 points each and Justin Phoenix added 11. 
Drew Barry added 15 and 11 assists for the Jackets, one of those an alley oop pass to Mar­bury on a dunk that gave the Jackets a 61-51 lead with 11:14 to play. 
Tech led by more than 10 points for the final 8:24 when Barry hit a 3-pointer from the left corner, followed a half­minute later by Marbury's dri­ving layup for a 70-56 ad­vantage. 
Tech biggest lead came with 
1:57 left, 83-61, when Barry converted a steal into a back­over-the-head dunk.

Arkansas led by as many as 19 points midway through the second half, but it was 68-62 with 2:19 to play. Pate made two free throws for a 70-62 lead with 2:09 left, two more for 72-65 edge and another pair for 7 4-67 lead with 28 sec­onds to play. 
Pate's next free throw set the final score. Pate, who scored 23, added another, but team­mate Darnell Robinson was in the lane too soon. 
The Razorbacks will play Ari­zona. in the tournament's sec­ond round Friday night. Ari­zona beat Long Beach State 91­
57. Northeast Louisiana never led and the last tie was 4-4. 
Arkansas led by 11 or more for the final 9 1/2 minutes of the first half and it was 42-25 at the half. Arkansas led by 17 with slightly more than six min­utes to play. 
Alvin Edwards' three-point play narrowed the lead to 68­58 with 2:46 left, and Jo Jo Jones beat Kareem Reid down the court for a layup that cut it to 68-60. 
Jones made another steal and blew the layup, but Dennis Newton was there to stuff home the rebound, narrowing it to 68-62. 
The Razorbacks held a com­fortable edge through much of the second half, leading by as many as 19 points. 
Jones blew past Arkansas for a left-handed layup that cut the lead to 49-38 with 13:52 to play. Newton blocked Hood's shot and the Indians had a chance to get within single dig­its, but Newton missed and Robinson had an easy put-back. 
Lee Wilson blocked a shot by Paul Marshall and Reid made a spin move down the lane for a 55-38 lead. Reid spotted Nicky Davis on the baseline and his bounce pass produced an easy basket. Reid then fed Wilson for a layup and a 19-point lead. 
Nick Dillon led Northeast with 17 points and Marshall added 
16. Northeast Louisiana had trouble getting inside against the much taller Razorbacks and shot only 33 percent in the first half, including 1-of-10 from 3­point range.

Gary makes sales pitch to Bears 
ByNANCYARMOUR 
Associated Press 
GARY, Ind. 
The Chicago Bears would move to a new $205 million open-air stadium in Gary under a proposal presented Wednes­day by a group of Indiana in­vestors who want to lure the team across the state line. 
The stadium would seat 75,000 people and have 135 luxury skyboxes at a site just west of the Gary Regional Air­port, according to the $482 mil­lion plan unveiled by Northwest Indiana/Chicagoland Entertainment Inc., or NICE. 
The Bears have a lease to continue playing at Chicago's Soldier Field through the 1999 season. 
If Bears President Mike McCaskey accepts NICE's offer, the Gary stadium would be ready for the 2000 season. 
The Gary stadium would be about a half hour from down­town Chicago, officials said. The team would continue to be called the Chicago Bears. 
"This plan is a winner for all Bears fans because it assures that the Chicago Bears will stay in the Chicagoland area," said Bill Wellman, chairman of the NICE board. 
Gary Neale, chairman of util­ity holding company NIPSCO Industries and a spokesman for the investor group, said the project has two phases. The first, which would cost nearly $312 million, would include the stadium, an entertainment mid­way, a Chicago Bears hall of fame and parking for 25,000 cars. 
The second phase, which 
would cost $170 million, would have a nine-hole golf course, a landscape park, hotels and a 500,000-square foot retail shopping area. 
The project would generate nearly 14,000 construction jobs as well as nearly 3,000 perma­nent jobs, said Neale, chairman of NIPSCO Industries, a power and gas utility holding com­pany. 
Funding for the project, which is to be called Planet Park, would come mostly from private funds. NICE would issue taxable bonds to cover the costs of building the stadium and the rest of the phase one. Once the park were built, NICE would lease it to Lake County, which would sublease it to the Bears and other users. 
NICE would recoup its costs through lease rentals, which would come from a combina­tion of public and private funds. NICE expects proceeds from personal seat licenses, club seats, parking and concessions to help pay for the loans. 
A new .5 percent economic development income tax in Lake County would be used to build roads, sidewalks and sew­ers for the project. 
Chicago has proposed re­modeling the Bears' current home, Soldier Field, for $156 million, adding 4,000 seats and 64 skyboxes and generating about $20 million in new rev­enue. 
Chicago Mayor Richard Daley believes the Bears will opt to stay in Chicago because it would maintain the team's long ties to the city and a new lease arrangement would let the team make at least $5 million a 


year more in concession deals, State officials have said that spokesman Jim Williams said. until a deal is reached they will The Bears expect to make a not comment publicly on the decision by December. negotiations. 
A game of musical franchises 
This game of musical foot­ball teams has to end. 
Los Angeles has been left team-less with the Rams moving to 
~--------. St. Louis and the Haiders to Oakland. T h e Cleveland Browns are moving to Baltimore, Mike Norbut while the Sports Editor Houston Oilers will soon have the pre­fix of Nashville. 
What's next? The (Chicago) Bears? 
One of the original profes­sional teams in the nation might seriously consider a move to Gary, Ind., if the city's offer, which looks attractive on paper, can so persuade them. 
The plan goes to the tune of a $482 million project, which would be enough to build a 75,000-seat stadium. includ­ing 135 luxury boxes. 
While the team would still be called Chicago, it would be about a half hour from the downtown Chicago area. It would be like the New York Giants/Jets. The only differ­ence would be that you can see Manhattan from The Meadowlands. All you can see from Gary is dirt and smog.
