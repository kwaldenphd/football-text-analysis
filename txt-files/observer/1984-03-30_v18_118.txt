Looking back on Chemistry 

Dear Dr. Hofman: 

So you are very upset to hear that there are cheaters in your class. Depending on how you define cheating, a case could be made that everyone there has cheated. The environment of your class makes it nearly impos­sible not to do so. But you should not consider this a personal affront. Few on this campus would argue that you are not a very honorable man who has done more for the freshmen at Notre Dame than any other in­dividual. 
It is the environment, not you, which enables cheat­ing. It is reasonable that your class was the one most frequently mentioned for cheating. Chemistry II 5-116 is probably the largest single class on campus, and there is probably no class in which it would be easier to cheat. 
Five hundred or more students in a close-packed ar­rangement taking a computer multiple-choice quiz! It requires effort to avoid glimpsing at least one answer on someone else's quiz, a least for those who prefer not to stare directly at a problem while thinking about it. Looking straight up at the ceiling is not much more comfortable. 
So suppose a student hap­pens to accidentally glimpse an answer to a problem. And yes, it happens accidentally. Very often it's irrevelevant because he can find the answer on his own. But what does a student do ifhe's torn between Band C, and knows that Mark has chosen B? It is not possible to forget that in­formation once it's known. So is the student cheating if he marks B? Or should he he stupid and refuse to mark H? Traditional Catholic schools say the question is moot: they'd trash the quiz for just having seen the answer, accidentally or not. 
Even ifyou don't consider that cheating, some cheat­ing goes on. It is easy to look at someone else's paper, much easier than in a liberal arts essay exam or in a technical course where some work must be shown. Some probably do depend on that ability to cheat in order to pass your course. 
But that should not disgrace your character. Are you really so vain as to believe that you alone could change the lives of these people who have so little personal contact with you, when they may have been cheating for years? Or that you alone have corrupted them? 
No, freshmen are under a lot of pressure from them­selves, parents, and others to succeed. Your class is the easiest one in which to relieve some academic pressure by cheating on occasion. That doesn't make it right, but it isn't your fault. 
One unusual thing you consider cheating is the

review of old final exams. Very few classes forbid this; yours is the only one which comes to mind. It is an accepted, intelligent method of studying. Your rationale is obvious: you use many of the same ques­tions year-to-year. Well, that is in your power to change -either try harder to stop the leak of exams or, more reasonably, conform to the rest of the University and change the questions. 
Your course was not without value, although few 
would say it was their favorite. You taught rhe value of studying in groups, of using old quizzes which, paradoxically, you recom­mend -and of establjshing a study routine.  
You also taught -some things which you didn't say you intended: how and when to cram for quizzes and then relearn for the final, and to accept bad grades with good without worrying about terrible con­sequences. 
Most students have a good opinion of you as a person. Hut your reaction to this ar­ticle, as reported by your current students, risks that goodwill. You seem to he taking this far too personal­
ly. The reaction by upperclassmen to the print-if-you­cheat, sign-if-you-don't honor policy is, quite honestly, that it's silly. No one who would cheat would have qualms about signing; it is downright stupid to admit to cheating in writing, anyway. 
Surely none of this is really news to you. Perhaps you had forgotten the faults of your class while you were upset. You care about freshmen, and they seem to be very devoted ro you. It is not your fault that srudents cheat. Some changes could be made in your class, but the most effective -splitting the class into smaller sec­tions -would also take away the main value of your class: it provided a degree ofunity for much oftht-fresh­man class.

Student Senate renews compensation debate 
By MIKE MILLEN 
News Staff 
The ongoing controversy regard­ing compensation for student government members surfaced again at last night's Student Senate meeting. Once again, however, no decision was reached. 

The issue, which was first raised a year ago, has been debated through­out the tenure of Student Body President Brian Callaghan. Last night, Callaghan once again stated that "academic credit for certain positions will be possible" and stated that the program would be "like an internship." 
In its last meeting, however, the Senate did not pass any particular proposal, choosing to leave the deci­sion to the incoming body. 
In other business, a resolution ur­
ging graduating seniors to donate their room deposits to F .inancial Aid was unanimously passed. 
The proposal was frrst tried last year, and according to Callaghan, it raised over 513,000. Callaghan sees this as not only a chance for new alumni to make their frrst donation to Notre Dame, but also as a way to insure that "more students will get aid." 
Callaghan hopes to have a 50 per­cent participation rate, which would raise almost $25,000. A form will be sent out, and any senior who signs and returns it will automatically have the 550 deposit routed to Financial Aid; otherwise, it will be returned in the mail. 
Five-hundred dollars was donated to the Women's Care Center by a unanimous vote. The money was left over from the year's Social Concerns Budget, and will help the center pay for its 24-hour phone counseling.

Alumni Association Florida van receives favorable reaction 
By ROBERT SIENKIEWICZ 
News Staff 
Nothing but positive reactions have been received concerning the Alumni Association van stationed in Fort Lauderdale over spring break. 
"The whole student body greatly benefited from the hard work of the Alumni Association," said Mark Rolfes, Service Commissioner of the Student Activities Programming Board. 
The van provided for vacationing Notre Dame and Saint Mary's stu­dents a variety ofservices, such as a Mass, message board, free phone 
calls, free information, parties.  and  two

munity? We decided to stick with the precedent, so we took Harry out of the running." 
Both James and Kraemer agree that Augustine should receive some kind of recognition from the senior class. "Have him come out and be with the senior class at graduation," said James. "Then they could make their statement without using the SeQ.i.or.Fe!lpw as the medium." 
Augustine recognizes the political significance of his nomination but

doesn't believe that it is· relevant. "If it's a student activity and a student vote, the students have the right to do their thing ....This appears to be the case of a minority trying to impose their will on the majority. That's not supposed to happen in this country." 
Augustine also rejected the idea of accepting any kind of alternative recognition. "That would be a cop out," he said. ''I'm not for any kind of cop out. I would be doing these stu­dents a disservice by allowing them to cop out. I would be contributing to the delinquency ofyoung adults." 
James claims he has no desire to take the decision away from the senior class. "I do want to put the ball in the hands ofthe senior class," James said, "but I also want to clear up the ambiguity about Harry being a joke. And I think they have to prove this to the senior class. If they can prove that he's not just some ig­norant statement about alcohol and that he has done something for the senior class, I'll put him back on the ballot."

Eight people have been nominated for Senior Fellow, excluding Harold B. Augustine who was disqualified by the Senior Fel­low Committee. (Story, page 1)

Seniors deserve chance to vote for Augustine 
ll is an outrage that the name of Harold B. Augustine, who once declared that "a wet campus is a happy campus," has been dropped from the list ofSenior Fellow nominees. 
While there may be more deserving persons for the high honor, the senior class has nonethell:ss been betrayed hy a committee of four students who alone decided that Augustine failed to meet the second of three qualifications necessary to he named Senior Fellow. 
The pitfall? The committee said Augustine has not directly affected the lives of the senior class and has not provided inspiration to reach for higher ideals. 
The seniors seem to disagn:c. When nominations were first taken, 60 of the 90 received were for Augustine; the next highest vote-getter received two. Apparently that was not enough for Senior Fellow Committee Chairman Mike james. Nominations were reopened. This time, Augustine received H9 of 252 nominations; the second place nominee got five. 
James and his committee are not f(>oling anyone. The real reason Augustine's name has been droppt·d is ht·cause the committee docs not want the award to become a political state­ment about the University's proposed change in the alcohol policy. But that is not the committee's prerogative, and it has acted irresponsibly in convincing it­self that it is. 
The logic seems painfully obvious. The Senior Fellow is -and always has been -determined hy the entire senior class. And if the seniors want a 46-year­old engineer who graduated from Notre 
Dame in 1959 as their Senior Fellow, then james and his committee should accept the mandate. 
One might indeed wonder why the seniors have embraced as their Fellow a person who, by chance, had his rather lively quote on the possibility of a dry campus printed in The Obseroer. Whether or not he has influenced the lives of the seniors is still a good ques­tion. But the situation is not as black and white as james would like.to think. 
james must realize that his commit­tee is the grand jury, not the judge. As long as there is evidence that some seniors are serious about nominating Augustine, fairness demands that james put Augustine's name on the ballot. 
After the first nominations, james called Augustine and asked if he felt the nomination was demeaning. Augustine called it an honor. Last night, Augustine called the removal of his name "an in­sult." We agree. Seniors should be given the opportunity to vote for Augustine. 
Harold B. Augustine has had an im­pact on the campus, and he is far more than just a quotation in a newspaper. Students met and. talked with him during Spring Break in Ft. Lauderdale where Augustine works. 
In Augustine, seniors have found the right mix of flippancy and disdain they have been trying to launch at the ad­ministration for four years. Long ago, the seniors lost hope with a University that wouldn't listen. Harold B. Augustine is the irreverent answer. Harold B. Augustine is a statement worth making.

Many students took advantage of the WATS line, enabling tht·m to call home for free. Likewise, the messagt· hoard also appeared to he quite well received. lkyond that, however, little was provided to keep students from using the bars as the center of their socializ­ing. 
Part of the problem was the location of tht· van. While it was in a convenient area -ht·tween the two buildings of tlw Sheraton Yankee Trader Hotel ­thl· van was perched quite close to a rather putrid smelling dumpster. 
Other disadvantages included the lack of refreshments or food on the site and the very nature of the van which made it unattractive to students from other univcrsitil's.

We also question the tastefulness of advertising a Mass by towing a banner behind an airplane, one of the same airplanes that encourage at­tendance at wet T-shirt contests and all­you-can-drink happy hours. 
The van should make its pilgrimmage next year. But we hope in the future that its presence will not be ~ssociated with a crackdown and that a better site is found. The association also should look to expanding its services, such as providing emergency check-cashing and snacks. The van will never he an at­tcrnative to the bar scene, but it has proven its potential as a surrogate stu­dent center.

Now that we are safely beyond the ob­sessive "Super Tuesday" expectancy there are the usual questions about the front-running Gary Hart. Can he win the nomination and

The Lerner column 
election? But the more important one is ­
can he govern? 

At ftrst I welcomed Hart's breakthrough be­cause I like political inventiveness. But I found Icouldn't take the TV huckstering, nor could I take Hart's eager, almost rdolW-Iike response to Pat Cadell's Grand Design for a quick, if im­probable TV victory. 
Then, leaning backward to be open minded, I damaged my eyes by reading all the magazine print on Hart I could find since 1981, when he could no longer conceal his Oval Office dream, and I glued myself to the fleeting images on a TV set that keeps me from . more frivilous pursuits. 
The results were mixed. There is some ap­peal in Hart's avoidance of both the knee-jerk hard conservatives and the knee-jerk tender liberals, and his effort to break the mold, and create a kind of Third Force which will pick the brains of intellectuals and come up with untried approaches. 
For a time the standard criticism in the early Hart interviews was that he was a lofty statemans-like thinker, but that as a politician he had a disabling "chill factor" which kept him from warming up to people and discover­ing how they live and think. 
But events have turned this topsy-turvey. He has shown, with Caddell, a wizadry at TV politicking and showmanship, mastering the new art of image-making as he once mastered what a dissidenr Pentagon group was saying about defense technology. 
Caddell and Hart discovered a vacuum in the public's perception of the candidates, and moved into it with a history-making swiftness. Maybe that will go down as the most success­ful of Hart's "new ideas." 
But has he mastered what counts in presidential governing? For me ftve things count -experience reflected on, self knowledge, judgment in decision making, 
spine, and character. 

Alas, I don't see much evidence of them in 
Hart, especially of the last three. Robert Kaus, 
who did the now classic piece on Hart in the 
Washington Monthly for October 1981, has a 
follow up piece in the current New Republic 
on "Gary Hart's idea collection." With one 
"idea" of Hart's after another he documents 
how skillful Hart has been in basing them on 
tax incentives and relocation allowances, and 
thus evading -and even hiding -their real 
costs to the public. 

I don't feel that Hart's skills in whatever is 
trendy, faddist and gimmicky are enough to 
prepare him to be president. In the end it is a 
matter of character, which sets the large~ 
frame within which to study Hart. 

1
There was the lost second syllable of his 
. 1
family name, Hartpence. There was the lust year of his age, which made him 46 not 47. 
. I1
There was the lost Hart mtellectual detach-f 
ment, as the hot TV cameras grew more 
caressing. There was the corner trimming that 
caught him up as the groupies and star-seekers 
clustered around him. 

It is thus that one must evaluate his almost 
incredible response to john Chancellor's 
question about the hostile Czech plane invad­
ing American airspace at 2 a.m. What would 
each candidate, as president, do about it? 
Hart's answer: ··If the people in the airplane 
had uniforms I'd shout it down. If they were 
civilians I'd let them go." It was a ghastly gaffe, 
worthy ofJerry Ford's "Poland" bit, or Jimmy 
Carter invoking Amy on nuclear war. No won­
der John Glenn, who had some pilot ex­
perience in his career. had a delighted laugh. 
"You don't go peeking into the windows," he 
said. 

What made it worse was Hart telling repor· ters later he was only joking, and then refusing to answer further questions on it. What a time and place and subject for a joke! 
!like the Pericles idea that the art ofgovern­
ing consists in the development of character. 
In Hart's political fortunes the character fac­
tor may yet overtake the image-making factor.

The Ratings Game and Notre Dame 
Colleges and numerical rankings go togeth­er like butter and bread. It seems1that we al­ways want to know if our sports te~ are in the top twenty, the number of volumes we 
RandyFahs 
Friday analysis 
have in the library, or how much money we have in the endowment fund. 
These are numerical statistics which we use to compare our progress against other col­leges and universities. But still, one might be led to ask, "How good is Notre Dame?'' 
Before I tread further on this delicate topic, I must qualify my statements by saying that I am no expert and that they are my personal opinions. But there is some validity to them since I have had the chance to visit more than 30 institutions of higher learning through my travels and my quest to choose a law school. 
Almost any college handbook will list Notre Dame in the "most competitive" category of admissions standards. These guides will speak of the size of our library, the faculty-student ratio, and our national reputation to name just 
a few. These are ambiguous and in some in­stances mislesading descriptions. 
The students that come to Notre Dame are highly motivated and intelligent individuals. They tend to be fairly well-rounded and in­volved in a multitude of extra-curricular ac­tivities. Prospective employers and graduate school admissions committees have been highly impressed with the "Notre Dame Product." 
One criticism is that our student body tends to be relatively homogeneous in its back­grounds. Also, while the average Domer may grumble from time to time, he or she is slow to question or act against established authority and norms. 
The Notre Dame faculty is not listed among the most prominent in the nation. This finding is misleading because faculty quality ratings are based upon their volume of publications. It is difficult to rate teaching ability and acces­sability to students, but these are far more im­portant than the number of books or articles that a professor has published. I believe that our faculty is one of our greatest assets and that they are amongst the finest in the nation. 
The campus itself is a beautiful and very comfortable place to study. The atmosphere is conducive to learning and growth. Too many college campuses are sterile and uninviting. If one is to evaluate the actual facilities then I must say we get mixed reviews. 
Academic buildings, especially the newer ones, seem to define the term "functional". They have very little architectural creativity. A building like O'Shaughnessy is ludicrous with its long, narrow classrooms and doors which open outward into the hallway. 
The Memorial Library is one of the largest private library buildings in the world, but barely half of its floors have books on them. While strong in certain areas, the library tends to be weak in the diversity ofits collection and the rate at which new publications are ac­quired. 
Much has been said and written about a Notre Dame student center (or the lack there­of). I will say that in all of my visits that "NO" other college or university of moderate to large size has a student center which is as poor as ours. LaFortune is grossly inadequate in its size and variety ofofferings for a place that has nearly 10,000 students. 
Notre Dame has one plague which at many universities is a beneficial guiding force. I am speaking none other than our overabundance of Administration interference. Most college students will voice some complaints about the way that their school is run, that is normal. 
But very few college administrations are so unwilling to listen to the views of their stu­dents. Students at other coJieges often laugh and wonder if I am kidding when I explain such things as the fact that an all-nigt.t parie­tals violation results in separation from the university. 
Reputations tend to lag behind the actual quality of a college at any point in time. The most important thing to examine is the quality of the specific program one is pursuing. A na­tionally renowned college can still offer sub­par programs. Also, if a student is not comfortable or happy, then no matter how good the program, the person is not likely to get excellent training. 
We should not get too hung up on the fact that Notre Dame is a fine university. There are many areas for improvement and we must critically examine the good and bad things which we have to offer. It is easy for improve­ments to be filed away in things like the PACE report. 
Notre Dame has never opened itself up for public critique and this may be the key thing which is preventing Notre Dame from becom­ing a truly great university. 


P. 0. BoxQ 
Goodbye McGinn 
DearEditor: 
One should thank the Lord that Paul 
McGinn, The Obseroer's former Executive 
Editor, is graduating in May. His long history if 
inaccurate and improper columns has only 
brought considerable frustration to the sen­
sible reader. 
A case in point is his last column 
(hopefully) of March 16. In it his bitterness 
against the world, which has blinded him from 
reality, reared its ugly head again in the fury of 
charges he made against Father Hesburgh. 
Sadly, at least one such accusation is starkly 
untrue. McGinn writes that Hesburgh "does 
not 1want to lose control of a university he 
built from literally nothing." 
This premise stated, McGinn goes on to say that instead ofaccepting a position ofchancel­lor, Hesburgh "decided (prompted by fawning trustees) three years ago that he did not want to hand over his title to someone else." According to McGinn, in other words, Hesburgh was glad to accept the job of presi­dent for five more years. 
To set the record straight for the unknow­
ing and unaware, Hesburgh felt exactly the 
opposite: he appeared a tired and depressed 
man at the press conference announcing the 
extension ofhis presidency. While no one can 
say positively how Hesburgh truly felt except 
he himself, one can in any case reasonably 
presume that a leader of any institution for 
over a quarter century who expresses his 
desire to step down may be actually speaking 
sincerely. 
One need not prove this, however; the bur­
den ofproofproperly rests on he who accuses 
another of deception. The accuser here 
though, McGinn, does not even attempt to 
substantiate his reckless charge. Instead he 
resumes his column of condemnation. I can 
only say in reaction that disillusionment is no 
excuse for publicly maligning anyone. 
McGinn owes Father Hesburgh a great apol­
ogy.

Stupid squabbling 
DearEditor: 
The past few months in The Obseroer have been disappointing ones for me. It seems that every gripe, large or small has been prominately displayed on the Viewpoint/P.O. Box Q page. Sometimes I agreed with the authors (yes, even you Randy Fahs ), but usual­ly I didn't. 
I'm afraid that many people here at Notre Dame fail to think before they write. I could cite endless examples, but I think I'll stick to one of our latest "dilemmas": cheating in Dr. 
Hofman's Chemistry class. 
Yes, people do cheat in Dr. Hofman's class; perhaps not a vast majority, but certainly a vast number. From my freshman year ex­perience, I knew people who exclusively cheated and others who merely "confirmed" their answers with a neighbor's. 
Is this a cause for Dr. Hofman to feel dis­graced? Only if he is as naive as some of our letter writers seem to be. Is it a reason to make some constructive changes in the class? Per­haps. Students, even at Notre Dame, do cheat. Signing, printing or using hierglyphics won't change that. Sorry kids, Notre Dame is not paradise -it does baw its warts. 
People at Notre Dame are told so often that they are elite that they soon begin to believe it. How about reality, huh? The Obseroer could really reach great levels and do the com­munity a great service if we were more ob­jective and thoughtful in our writing. The moralizing, crying over hurt feelings and in­significant squabbles that fill the paper are making it more of a rag than an intelligent forum for the Notre Dame community. 
Philip Carmichael Senior 


A common problem 

DearEditor: 
The current issue of academic honesty has been bothering me. I don't want to believe that a majority of students cheat in Dr. Hof­man's class or in any class, but I am shocked by the naivete of Nanette Penz, Anne LaFlamme, and Stephen O'Neill. In their letters, they all expressed an idealistic view that the estimates of cheating were exaggerated. I would dis­agree. 
We live in a society where cheating is al­most accepted. Indeed, cheating, and its companion, lying, have reached epidemic proportions in America. Through Orwellian doublespeak and doublethink and lax morals, we've convinced ourselves that we've done nothing wrong. 
On the contrary, how many of us have ac­cepted money under the table for a job? How many of us have cut in line either at the movies orat the dining hall orfor concert tick­ets? How many of us have lied to our parents about where we've been or what time we got in?. And most importantly, how many of us have gotten into a bar under-aged by using a fake ID? 
Notre Dame is not immune. We may be ahead of many other universities, but we're not the paradise that Joe Murphy describes in his column ofMarch 27. Ask the students who 
go ouf,!q,fR,C()?.¥~.!ln.<l return with slM~J~.eer mugs. Ask anyone at WSND how many records are stolen each week (As a OJ, I can speak from experience. It is not uncommon to play a record one week and have it disappear by the next.). 
This dishonesty is a national disease that does touch academics. In my private, Catholic high school, I was considered strange because I didn't cheat. I don't cheat; I never have. 
I'm, sure there are many people like me in Dr. Hofman's class, but I cannot make an ac­curate statement about the situation because I do not take Chemistry 115-116; however, my roommate and many ofmy friends do, and I've been told by more than one of them that scoping does occur. 
I'm sorry that Dr. Hofman was hurt; however, to me, the situation does not dis­grace his reputation. As Stephen O'Neill points out in his letter of March 28, Dr. Hof­man "distributes a single version to each class and urges his students to conduct themselves ethically during the examination period." 
Stopping scoping among 500 students is a difficult task for one professor and two teach­ing assistants. The students.are-.the ones dis­graced, not Dr. Hofman. They have a teacher who trusts them, yet they stab h im in the back. 
I am an optimistic person by nature, but, at the moment, the words ofBillyJoel echo con­tinuously in my mind: "Honesty is such a lone­ly word. Everyone is so untrue." 
If we here at Notre Dame are the hope of the future, I need some reassurance, some proof, that we are who we claim to be: brothers and sisters of Christ. The cheating and lying must stop not only in academics, but also in our lives.

Where is the evil? 

DearEditor: 
I write in response to an article which claims that the U.S. is the evil empire in this world. This is not the ·case. Unlike the US, which has not annexed any country since World War II, the Soviet Union since World War II has annexted Latvia, Esthonia, Lit­huania, Western Poland, Bessarabia (Romania), Ruthenia (Czechoslovakia), Mol­davia (Romania), Bukovina (Romania), East­ern Finland, Northern Finland, the Kurile Islands Qapan), Sakalin Island Qapan), and Eastern Prussia (Germany). 
Besides these countries and territories an­nexed outright, the Soviets also exercise con­trol over many countries in Eastern Europe, Asia, Africa, and even in the Americas only ninety miles from our shore. 
Thus, to the question ofwhich power is the evil empire on this globe, there is only one answer: The communist Soviet Union which is incessantly exporting revolution, hate, and tyranny to countries which Moscow eventual­ly makes part ofits "Evil Empire."

Guarino mistaken 

DearEditor: 
I have just read Theresa Guarino's editorial about the inappropriateness of the name "Belles" for the Saint Mary's athletic teams. I am inclined to agree, especially in light of the emphasis on women's issues and oppor­tunities at Saint Mary's. 
This "archaic idea," however, dates only to the mid-1970's, when I was a student at St. Mary's. I have to point out what present stu­dents do not know: what Miss Guarino calls an "obsolete custom" was chosen by students in a name contest in 1975. 

I doubt many will disagree; the name is not the best. But a halfhour's research-a phone call to Saint Mary's Archives -would have eliminated the assumption that the name is a holdover from "archaic" history. In news writing (even editorials), accuracy breeds credibility. 
Ellen Bussing Pugh SaintMary's Class of1979 


How much longer? 

DearEditor: 
As a senior approaching my final weeks 
here at the dome, I would like to leave one 
thought behind. I leave this thought to my fel­
low domers so that they may perhaps better 
the situation which I am about to discuss. 
For 4 years I have been a great hockey fan. I 
have had many. acquaintances with past as 
well as present players and I have shared many 
of their wins and losses. Notre Dame always 
has been able to recruit some ofthe top hock­
ey players from the U.S. and Canada 

Yet, with all this talent, I have seen them lose many games which they should have easi­ly have won. This year was probably the most disasterous as we saw a highly talented team lose a club level league championship. 
The problem here does not appear to be with the players but with the coaching. Since the program ftrst started at N.D., there has not been a change in head coach. That is quite a long time to keep a coach whose winning per­centage wasn't over .500 until this years club season. Notre Dame does not have a reputa­tion of keeping losing coaches around that long -not 16 years. 
Why now? They have let a Division I power­house get ruined and the players and the fans have been victims of this chaos and I am one fan who is tired ofit. WAKE UP NOTRE DAME. IT'S TIME FOR A CHANGE. Let's not ruin this next opportunity for Division I hockey again.

Litt·rally. 
Ammonia Ar'enue, the group's 
latt'M effort, will not bt· long remem­bered ti>r its originality. The sound is purt· Alan Parsons Project, but it's not twu Alan Parsons Project. For t·xamplc:, tht· score to tht· title track could he taken almost directly from tht· group's prc:vious studio album,

All of this is not meant to imply that Ammonia Ar,enue is without mt·rit. Far from it. Evt·n when he's not being orignal. Alan Parsons is still one of the great masters of the mixing board. The results he ac­hieves with the saxophone line can leave you wondering ifMd Collins is rc:ally playing a saxophone and not a 

synthc:sizc:r. But he does this with­
out making album sound over­
producc:d. In the same way, Eric

richc:r and more: texturc:d than

The: bc:st fc:aturc: ofAmmonia Avenue is without a doubt the lyrics.

Ammonia Ar,enue usc:s the anal­Ob'Y ofa male-fc:malc: relationship to c:xamine the impact of technology on modem society. The: entire first sidt· dc:scribes a step-by-step deterioration ofa good relationship with such lines as:

Gimme onegood reason why I should listen to you 
and finally: 

Run away and bidefrom everyone Can you change tbe things we've said and done? 
It isn't until the second side ofthc album that a reference to technol­ogy is made: The silverplated beru Meets the golden hearted whore 
The rc:st ofthe ofthe album dcvolops the thc:mc, climaxing with the optimistic title cut, "Ammonia Avenue." 
The: brightest feature ofthe album is that Alan Parsons can carry the theme with a subtlety that allows any song to stand by itselfwith no explanations necessary. To fully ap­preciate this, one nc:ed only comparc.Xmmo#id"Avenue with Styx'Kilroy was Here. The themes are comparable, but songs like "Mr. Roboto" seem somewhat ridiculous when taken out ofcontext. 



who deserves to be famous 
asks Schroeder what he's going to do in school for "Show and Tell." Schroeder, in answer, plays a flaw­less Beethoven sonata on his piano, and then asks, "What are you going 
to do, Charlie Brown?" Charlie 
Brown's round face stares out of the 
page, embarrassed to be upstaged by 
brilliance: "Actually, what can you 
say about a little red truck?" Once, 
when).B. and I were visiting In­
nsbruck on the same day, I played 
Charlie Brown to his Schroeder. 
Standing on a street corner, I 
nooded "ja" to a string ofquestions 
put to me in Austrian by a local priest, as jim listened. When the 
native cleric left, Jim told me I had 
informed the priest that I was a country pastor in a Bavarian village 
famous for its wood carvings. Be­cause it seemed so funny, my little 
red truck didn't mind being out­
classed by the tinkle ofSchroeder's 
piano, capable, incidentally, ofan in­1
ternational medley oflanguages. 
"Let us now praise famous men." 
One of them who has a birthday 
coming up represents a religious 
community I am proud of. Jim 
Burtchaell stories belong to the 
tradition ofour Holy Cross scholars 
who are also pastoral. Once, a stu­
dent, faced with the death ofhis 
father, asked Burtchaell at his 1 l p.m. Mass to come by and pray with him. Sleep overtookJim before he left his room. Waking in the middle ofthe night, he walked the length of 
he campus to the student's room, to apologize for coming so late. In the deep, dark night of the soul, Scott Fitzgerald says, it is always three o'clock in the morning. The story may or may not be true in the form I heard it, but it is typical ofpriests and brothers available for ministry at hours when time goes slowest. 
Coming back to Notre Dame the 
week my mother died, I wanted 
some sign that somebody else cared 
about a grieftoo private and per­
sonal to be easy to talk about. Arriv­
ing at Pasquerilla West, I found Jim 
Burtchaell had left a Mass vestment 
made out ofraw silk in my room 
which he asked me to accept in 
memory of my mother. It is so per­
fectly Burtchaellian, I shall probably 
wear it next to my winding sheet, 
when the Lord God will appreciate 
the elegance for which the silk 
worms ofChina gave their lives, and 
not judge that I have come to Him in 
borrowed robes. 
"Let us now praise famous men." 
The work which is one ofJim's chief 
credentials as a thoroughbred is his 
book "Rachel Weeping." WhenJiht­
my Carter came to Notre Dame as a 
presidential candidate, Father Hes­
burgh made the.1?r?m}s'i,f~~-t..~9V~-11,r Dame would sponsor a study of· abortion by scholarly experts, away from the angry polemics ofstreet 
demonstrations. Jim Burtchaell, ac­ting on behalfofFather Hesburgh, arranged for an abortion con­ference, for which he received great criticism by traditionalists, who felt 
that pro-abortion proponents 
shouldn't have been invited. Later, 
he had all the papers printed as a 
book. Then, after the other opinions 
were available,Jim wrote the 
definitive study ofabortion himself, 
taking a year off so that in his book, 
halfa million words long, he could 
explore all the myths and present his 
conclusions in an informed way. The 
reviews praised "Rachel Weeping" 
in its service to truth. I love the professionalism supportive ofFather 
Hesburgh's promise on the dayJim­
my Carter came. I love the courage 
that could put up with being mis­
judged. Bitter criticism can make life 
seem very lonely. 

"Let us now praise famous men," before the dying oftheir light. Jim Burtchaell once complained to me: "You have canonized me without due process." Happy birthday, Jim. It's only halfas bad as it's going to be when you're a hundred, and we know the whole story. Community legends are notoriously imaginative; that's what makes them such fun. I would rather unknowingly exag­gerate to a man's face, than do it deliberatel~ind his back, at the wake where he can'tdefend himself. Praising one ofour own is an act of love for the Holy Cross community.

Coaches

previously spent one year as the NFL New England Patriots' linebacker coach in 19!H. For the three seasons before that, he served as defensive coordinator and linebacker coach at Miami -working the first two years under Lou Saban and the last two un­der current Hurricane coach Howard Schnellenberger. He also put in six seasons on the Navy staff, coaching the line and serving as defensive coordinator. In 1975, Navy ranked third nationally in total defense and sixth in pass defense. Lantz has also coached at Boston University, Rhode Island, and the University of Buffalo. In 1969, the Bulls finished third nationally in to­tal defense, sixth in scoring defense, 
and eighth in rushing defense. 
"We're happy to be able to add a coach of Rick's caliber to our staff," said Faust. "He's coached all three levels of defense and has con­siderable experience as a coor­dinator, so we feel he'll 1 be well-versed in every aspect·· of defensive football. He helped t<T in­stall many of the things Miaml is 
doing  defensively  now,  and  
everyone knows the  success  they  
had this season."  

Lantz, who has coached against the Irish ten times during his years with Navy and Miami, agrees with Harris that this Irish coaching staff is the most experienced he has ever worked with. 
"I've seen a lot ofpositive signs so far," said Lantz. "We four defensive coaches agree philosophically on how we want to do things. We all have pretty much the same style of coaching. Our goal is to be relaxed and play a team game. If we play to our potential, we should be a very competitive team defensively. 
"The defensive line could be our deepest position. We have at least two dependable players at every spot, which is good because the players won't have to pace them­selves too much. We're also going to have a lot ofcompetition for playing time up front, which is good. The players have positive attitudes jind they've been practicing hard." .,

Chernoff, Kush pleased 

Colts moving to Indianapolis 
Associated Press 
INDIANAPOLIS Baltimore 
Coach Frank Kush and Michael 
Chernoff, general counsel of the 
Colts, confirmed reports yesterday 
that the National Football League 
team would move to Indianapolis 
and play in the new Hoosier Dome. 
Asked on arrival at Indianapolis International Airport whether the move was certain, Chernoff answered, "Yes! and we're very excited about it." 
Kush said he had enjoyed an ear­lier visit to Indianapolis while negotiations for the move · were being held. 
"It's great (coming to In­dianapolis). It's something we're doing with a lot ofanticipation. It's a new experience," he said. 
Anews conference was scheduled by Mayor William Hudnut for 3:30 p.m., EST. 
Kush and Chernoff arrived about 
1 p.m. Ol) a flight from Baltimore in 
the private jet ofteam owner Robert 
lrsay. Irsay was not on the aircraft 
and his whereabouts were not 
known. 
Meanwhile, Indianapolis officials scheduled a meeting tomorrow of the Capital Improvement Board, which must approve any agreement involving use of the 60,000-seat Hoosier Dome. 
Barbara Neilan, a spokeswoman for the board, said she had been aut­horized by board president P.E. MacAllister to announce that "an agreement has been negotiated with the Baltimore Football Club subject to approval of the board at its meeting in special session on Satur­day." 
Irsay was not available for com­ment yesterday morning, when the cities of Baltimore and Indianapolis were buzzing with word of the pos­sible move. 
Irsay has been talking about moving the Colts for about eight years with several cities mentioned as possible sites. In January, it was reported a deal was made to bring he team to Phoenix but Irsay later denied the report. 
Phoenix officials announced Wednesday they had withdrawn their offer. 
Baltimore officials and busines­smen offered Irsay a S1 5 million loan at 8 percent interest, and a California developer offered to build a domed stadium in Baltimore for the Colts and baseball's Baltimore Orioles ifboth teams agreed to long­term leases. 
Phoenix officials said their offer also included a Sl5 million loan at discounted rate, rent-free use of the 70,021-seat Sun Devil Stadium and a guaranteed $3 million in ticket sales. 
The NFL has said it will do nothing to block a move by the Colts, noting it is powerless because ofa court or­der to stop an owner from moving a franchise. That ruling came when the Oakland Raiders moved to Los Angeles and has been upheld by the 
U.S. Court ofAppeals. 

Hang on toyourbats -the Baltimore Colts havefinally decided where they are going. The franchise willplay itsgames nextseason in the 60,000-seat Hoosier Dome in Indianapolis. The move was made only one day after Phoenix officials announced they were withdrawing their bidfor the team. Story at left. 

Irish 
continuedfrom page 12 
Boston College. A third round NIT game was something talked about only in the basketball office at the ACC. 
It was with much pride, then, that 
the Notre Dame players left Madison 
Square Garden Wednesday night, 
even after they had been pounded 
by Michigan. They really had no­
thing to be ashamed o[ It had not 
been a case of the Irish beating 
themselves as in games past but more a case of a better and hotter Michigan team beating them. Still, there was much about this season to be proud of. 
And if the endless determination that the Notre Dame players showed against the Wolverines, even when 20 points down, is any indication of their cha!racter make-up, which it probably' is, you can bet there will be much mbre to be proud of in the coming !#easons. 
The one shame ofthis is that Sluby will not 8e around·to share in what this tearrl should accomplish in the next few years simply because if it were not for him this year, there is no way that Notre Dame would have been where it was Wednesday night. 
The only thing this team might lack next year is the solid senior leadership that Sluby provided during the second halfofthis year. It is uncertain as to how much a role Dan Duff will play come Oct. 15 when the team begins workouts again and who knows ifJoe Howard will want to, or be allowed to, play again after football season. Not to say Phelps doesn't want the sparkplug Howard around. The 13th-year coach has already indicated that "Small Wonder" is more than welcome back. 
Who will provide the leadership? Jim Dolan is a good guess. The soph­omore did much of the leading this year when Sluby wasn't and his con­sistent play is something that will keep him in the line-up game after game. Really, though, anyone could emerge as a leader. 
With one of Phelps' best recruit­ing classes coming in, the '84-'85 squad should be deep -real deep.

Next year's opponents will get bet­ter, too. Syracuse is scheduled to come to South Bend and the Irish are slated to head to Houston to face Akeem "The Dream" and mates. BYU and now Michigan are other possible good matchups, and the Irish will again try to end their Meadowlands jinx, this time facing Duke in East Rutherford, N.J. 
South Bend will probably look pretty good to the players today when they arrive back at the circle 
around 3 p.m. (they are going to try to take the same flight they passed 
· up yesterday), as they have been on the road for much of the last couple weeks. The one thing which shouldn't worry them is getting snowed into New York again next March. In fact, it's unlikely they will be stranded anywhere since the site of next year's Final Four is Lexi· ngton, Ky. -and I'm told that it never snows in Lexington come late March-early April.

Irish lacrosse 
Disappointment sign of progress 
By MIKE SULLIVAN 
Sports Editor 

When the Notre Dame lacrosse team left for the East Coast to play three: games ovc:r spring break, Coach Rich O'Leary would have considered a 1-2 record and a near­win over Duke a succc:ssful trip. Howc:ver, aftt:r set:ing his tt:am beat Georgetown and lose: to Duke: and William and Mary, O'Lt:ary actually was disappointt:d. 
"We thought that a 1-2 trip was the probablt: result," said O'Leary. "Howevc:r, we thought we had a chance ofbeating William and Mary. Also, it was disappointing that we lost to Duke after we were ahead be­cause of mistakes we never should have: made. We just haven't put to­gether a consistent performance for a whole game." 
O'Leary's disappointment is a good sign of his team's progress. In past years, just getting close to East­ern tc:ams like Duke would be cause for celebration. However, teams like Duke, which are a step or two below the rc:al lacrosse powers like Johns Hopkins and Syracuse, are no longer out ofreach. 
Notre Dame's second-half perfor­mance against the Blue Demons was the difference, though, as the Irish dropped tht:ir regular season opener at Durham, N.C. 
Riding the momentum they pickt:d up in a scrimmage with Rich­mond Lacrosse Club and an exhibi­tion game: against Randolph-Macon, the Irish took a 4-3 lead into halftime. However, four costly mistakes in the second half allowed 

Track

sc:ason, usually placing wt:ll in tht 
short sprints and hurdlc:s. 
"Losing Alvin hurts an awful lot," says Plane:. "Maybe if he: goes through spring ball and has a good fall, thc:y'll be more inclined to let him compete outdoors next season." 
Nevertheless, Pianc has quite a bit of talent returning. Once again, he will have the services ofan outstand­ing group of middle-distance and distance runners. Jim Tyler, Jim Moyar, Tim Cannon, john McNelis, JefiVan Wie, Ralph Caron, Andy Dil­lon, and Ed Juba should do well in the HOO meters, ISOO, 3000, SOOO and 10,000. 
In the t1cld events, the hopes of the Irish rest primarily with jumper jamt·s Patterson. Patterson, who set tht· school indoor long jump record with a leap of 2·l-H and who is also the team's best triple jumper an<l high jumper, should score a good deal of points. The rest of the tkld events -shot put, discus, javelin, and pole vault -will be put in the hands of inexperienced performers. 
The sprints will be handled by Phil Gilmore, Greg Bell, Van Pearcy (if he docs not participate: in spring foothall ). and Patterson, while Mike Brt·nnan will try to make up for Mil­ler's absence in the hurdles. 
The Notre Dame Invitational will prt·pare the Irish for very com· pc:titive mec:ts in places like Texas, Illinois, Tt·nnessee, and Iowa. As in the indoor season, most runners will be trying to qualify for the IC4A'~ which will bt: held at Villanova Uni­versity on Ma)l 19-20. 
The: Invitational will be run tomorrow and the other teams. competing are Alma College, Wes­tern Michigan, St. Aquinas College, Southwestern Michigan, and Val­paraiso. It is a non-scoring meet and many runners will be using the com­petition to work out the kinks from the past month. 
Duke to squeak by with an 8-S vic­tory. Three times Notre Dame made bad passes while clearing the ball out of its end of the field and, once, the Notre Dame goalkeeper, Rob Simpson, inadvertently scored into his own net when the ball got stuck in the netting of his stick. 
"It was just one of those things," said O'Leary about the mistake-t1lled second half. "It was Duke's sixth game of the year, too, which meant they had much more game ex­perience than we had. Still, we could've and should've beaten them that day." 
While Duke was not quite as good as O'Leary anticipated, William and Mary put up a much tougher fight than originally thought and won handily, 14-6. 
"William and Mary is a lot better than we expected," said O'Leary. "The school is dropping the sport af­ter this season, and so they're very motivated to do welL They certainly had more talent than we did, too. I just don't think we should have lost by as much as we did. We looked bad in the end." 
Fortunately, the team's poor play did not carry into the final game of the trip against Georgetown as the Irish jumped all over the Hoyas in the t1rst half, taking a 10-3 lead en route to an easy 11-5 win. 
Whether the trip was disappoint­ing or not, it did allow the Irish to work out some of the kinks before the conference schedule begins this 
weekend. It also allowed O'Leary to get a reading on his team. 
"I can make a much better evalua­tion of the team now," O'Leary ex­plained. "We took four freshmen and two players who weren't on the team last year, so player evaluation was a big thing. 
"Right now, we're just not ag­gressive enough. Whether it's defense or ground balls, we have to challenge more. About halfthe start­ers are aggressive, so we need to find the right combination. It could be a while before we settle on a certain lineup." 
O'Leary will get another chance to try out different lineups as his team travels to Kenyon College in Ohio for its Midwest Lacrosse As­sociation opener. Last year, the Irish defeated Kenyon, 1 5-5, on Cartier Field. 
"Kenyon should be about like they were last year," predicts O'Leary. "They won't have much depth, but their starters should be about as good as ours. We'll probab­ly try to run and be aggressive." 
Notre Dame will also be looking for more performances like those of junior attackman Bob Trocchi and junior goalie Simpson. Trocchi had eight goals and two assists in the three games to lead all scorers, while Simpson had 39 saves. Tom Grote (three goals, two assists), Joe Franklin (three goals, one assist), andjoe Hart (three goals, one assist) also made big contributions.
